Background\n\nTrichoscopy is a very useful tool to diagnose hair disorders, and increase the diagnosis accuracy, it can also guide the biopsy site on the scalp in the most active area of the disease.\n\n2. Aims and Objectives\n\nWe suggest to perform an interactive session in which we will correlate the clinical and the trichoscopy findings of hair disorders presenting with the same clinical presentation in order to point out the utility of Trichoscopy in differentiating hair disorders that looks the same based on the clinical examination.\n\n3. Methods\n\nIn this session, a panoramic of clinical images (two or more in each time) of different diseases that look the same (same localization and clinical presentation) will be shown to the audience, and we will ask them to give their diagnosis for the two images (for example: two similar images of hair line recession, one patient present a frontal fibrosing alopecia and the other trichotilomania). Then we will correct and show them the trichoscopic images of the patients, and we will point out the trichoscopic signs together with a brief review of the literature of every hair disorder.\n\n4. Results\n\nNone\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThis proposed interactive session will enable participants to test their knowledge in trichoscopy, and to be vigilant and eager to use trichoscopy even if the clinical presentation is typical of a hair disorder\n\n7(6): 8.\n\nCLINICAL ANALYSIS OF NON-CICATRICIAL FORMS OF ALOPECIA\n\nZ.S.

Jetpisbayeva1\n\nBackground\n\nnon-cicatricial alopecia, which includes androgenetic and diffuse forms, accompany patients throughout their lives and significantly affect the quality of life.\n\nObjectives\n\nclinical analysis of patients with non-cicatricial alopecia.\n\nMethods\n\nWe examined 115 patients with non-cicatricial alopecia throughout the period 2013–2018. There were 94 patients with androgenetic alopecia (AHA), 21 women were with chronic diffuse telogen alopecia (CDTA), and 11 patients had a combination of AHA and CDTA.\n\nResults\n\nDuring trichoscopy, changes were detected in the parietal and occipital zones, although they were characterized by a predominance of changes in the AH-dependent zone. In the AH-dependent zone, the ratio of terminal and vellus-like hair in the parietal zone increased favoring vellus-like hair. The average number of single units in the parietal zone was greater than in the occipital one. Analysis of the redistribution and calculation of the average hair diameter showed pronounced anisotrichosis in the AHdependent zone.\n\nMinoxidil 5% 2 times a day for 6 months was used as topical therapy. With positive dynamics and patient consent, therapy was continued according to supportive regimens.\n\nAfter 6 months positive dynamics was observed in all cases. Growth of denser, thicker hair was observed. The hair tension test was negative in all areas.\n\nWhen conducting trichoscopy, an improvement was observed, more positive dynamics revealed in the occipital region.\n\nConclusion\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia has typical clinical features that develop against the background of a genetic predisposition with particular changes in androgenetic hormones that have tissue adherence in androgen-dependent areas of the scalp.\n\n7(6): 9.\n\nTRICHOTILLOMANIA MASKED BY DIFFUSE ALOPECIA AREATA: A CASE REPORT\n\n, 1 ,* F.P.J.

Background\n\nHair loss in pediatric patients comprises a range of congenital and acquired conditions that can either be cicatricial or non-cicatricial. Etiology may stem from disorders of the hair shaft or hair follicle to infectious and autoimmune. A thorough history provides information regarding acuity and pattern of hair loss, associated comorbidities and nutritional status. Physical examination may reveal signs of inflammation and the extent of hair-bearing regions involved while maneuvers such as the tug test and hair pull test provide a measure of hair fragility and disease activity, respectively. Trichoscopy allows for a non-invasive analysis of several follicular patterns as well as hair signs and shaft features that can help narrow down differentials among hair disorders that present similarly. Furthermore, it can be utilized to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response. The utility of trichoscopy is highlighted in this case where co-existence of alopecia areata and trichotillomania was uncovered after correlating clinical and histologic findings with the trichoscopic patterns.\n\n2. Observation\n\nAn 11-year old female previously treated for tinea capitis presented a 3-month history of continuous decrease in hair density on the vertex, frontal and parieto-temporal areas of the scalp. Hair pull test was negative. Thyroid function tests and hematologic work-up were unremarkable. Trichoscopic findings showed black dots, micro-exclamation point hairs, regrowing vellus hair and zigzag hairs. Histopathology showed CD3+ peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrates and occasional eosinophils around the anagen hair follicle consistent with a non-scarring alopecia. A diagnosis of diffuse alopecia areata was made. Patient was given methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg.day) for 2 weeks and noted marked increase in hair density except on focal areas of the scalp. Patient eventually admitted to occasional hair pulling. Trichoscopy revealed trichoptilosis on short hair strands, V-sign, tulip hairs and multiple broken hairs of varying length while a second biopsy on the focal alopecic area of the scalp showed trichomalacia and pigment casts consistent with trichotillomania. Patient was then referred to psychiatry for behavioral management. However, while tapering her methylprednisolone dose, she was lost to follow-up.\n\n3. Key Message\n\nIn cases like this where co-existence of alopecia areata and trichotillomania is considered to be uncommon, trichoscopy proves to be an important tool in differentiating hair disorders with similar presentation. Knowing key features of hair diseases can help elucidate the diagnosis when presented with an atypical case.\n\n7(6): 10.\n\nTO THE ISSUE OF TIMELY DIAGNOSIS OF CICATRICIAL ALOPECIA\n\n, 1 , 1 and 1 ,*\n\nZ.S.

Aimoldina\n\nBackground\n\ncicatricial alopecia can often be take place in the practice of a dermatologist and cosmetologist, in connection with which it is necessary to conduct a thorough examination of the entire skin surface, including the scalp; carefully study the anamnesis of the disease, the features of scalp care and protection from sun and other types of damage.\n\nObservation\n\nA 56-year-old patient received an appointment due to the prolonged absence of the effect of the therapy of dermatocosmetologist. Patient had complained about a pronounced thinning of hair that occurred more than five years ago.\n\nObjectively\n\nmarked receding frontal hairline. Diffusely spreading foci are revealed on the parietal region. In some areas they well-marked and have curve shape, in some areas they gradually turn into healthy skin. The skin in the lesions is smooth, shiny, demonstrates waxy to yellowish-brown color with the absence of follicular pattern and follicular orifices. Signs of photodamage, post-inflammatory hypo- and hyperpigmentation, follicular hyperkeratosis, and horn plugs are noted.\n\nDermatoscopic picture - areas of healthy skin alternate with areas of post-inflammatory hypo-and hyperpigmentation, skin atrophy, single location of preserved hair follicles with perifollicular hyperkeratosis, disappearance of hair follicle holes.\n\nPrimary cicatricial frontal alopecia was diagnosed.\n\nKey message\n\nthe case of late-diagnosed cicatricial alopecia in a woman in the postmenopausal period allows us to conclude that the diagnosis is complex and often late when significant fibrotic changes develop.\n\n7(6): 11–12.\n\nEVALUATION OF TRICHOSCOPIC PATTERNS IN ALOPECIA AREATA, TINEA CAPITIS AND TRICHOTILLOMANIA: A CASE SERIES STUDY IN SKIN OF COLOR\n\n1 and 2\n\nBalachandra S Ankad\n\n1Department of Dermatology, S Nijalingappa Medical College, Bagalkot-587103, India\n\nFind articles by Balachandra S Ankad\n\nPriyanka S Jaju\n\n2Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Nizamabad− 503002, India\n\nFind articles by Priyanka S Jaju\n\n1Department of Dermatology, S Nijalingappa Medical College, Bagalkot-587103, India\n\n2Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Nizamabad− 503002, India\n\n*Balachandra S Ankad, drbsankad@gmail.com\n\n1 Background\n\nTrichoscopy, dermoscopy of scalp and hair, is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that allows the recognition of morphologic structures not visible by the naked eye. It is a novel diagnostic technique, both simple and non-invasive, can be used as a handy bed side tool for diagnosing common hair and scalp disorder. Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, chronic, inflammatory disease that causes non-scarring hair loss. The severity ranges from small patches of hair loss, which usually recover spontaneously, to complete alopecia where the prognosis for hair regrowth is poor. Tinea capitis (TC) is a common condition, of superficial fungal infection of the scalp, which is seen in children. The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes, namely the Trichophyton and Microsporum genera that invade the hair shaft. Trichotillomania (TTM) is a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling resulting in alopecia. The diagnosis of TTM is often difficult as other hair loss diseases appear similar in clinical manifestations. This difficulty is encountered especially with alopecia areata. As TTM often coexists with AA, the methodology enabling reliable detection of TT in AA needs to be developed.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\ni. To evaluate the trichoscopic patterns of alopecia areata, tinea capitis and trichotillomania.\n\nii. To evaluate adverse effects of the procedure.\n\n3 Methods\n\nThe study was conducted in Dermatology department at S.Nijalingappa medical college from January 2017 to January 2018. Informed consent was taken from the patients and ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethical committee. It was a hospital based case series study. Patients with patchy hair loss were included and were evaluated by trichoscopy using Dermlite 3 dermoscope (10 × magnifications) with polarized and non-polarized light. Sony camera (Digital, 14 Mega pixels) was attached to save the images. Ultrasound gel was applied either on the skin lesion or on the foot plate and then lesions were observed through the eyepiece of dermoscopy. From the trichoscopic photographs obtained, hair shafts, hair follicle openings, perifollicular epidermis, cutaneous vasculature etc. were studied. Sample size calculation was done using open Epi software version 2.3.1 at 95% confidence level and 8% absolute precision. Results have been presented as proportions and percentages.\n\n4. Results\n\nA total of 150 patients with patchy hair loss were included in the study. Trichoscopically, patchy hair loss was featured by follicular and perifollicular findings. The most common features in alopecia areata were tapered hair 55(91.7%) (p<0.05) followed by micro exclamation mark hair 48(80%)(p<0.05), black dots 41(68.3%)(p<0.05) and yellow dots 35(58.3%)(p<0.05) while the most specific finding was regrowing pig tail hairs(p<0.05) and hypopigmented short vellus hairs (p<0.05) which were not seen in tinea capitis and trichotillomania.\n\nThe most common findings in tinea capitis were comma shaped hairs 30 (52.6%)(p<0.05), zigzag shaped hairs 13 (22.8%)(p<0.05) and corkscrew hairs 15 (26.3%)(p<0.05) which are although not commonly seen, considered to be characteristic features and can be used to differentiate from alopecia areata and trichotillomania.\n\nThe most common diagnostic findings in trichotillomania were broken hairs in 29 (87.9%) (p<0.05), V-sign in 19 (57.6%) (p<0.05), and short hair with trichoptilosis in 11 (33.3%) (p<0.05), patients whereas the most diagnostic findings were flame hairs in 7 (21.2%) (p<0.05), hook hairs in 19 (57.6%) (p<0.05), hair powder in 3(9.1%)(p=0.010) patients.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, our findings illustrate the value of a polarized-light handheld dermatoscope in the evaluation of trichoscopic findings in patchy hair loss. It provides insights into the pathogenesis and also helps to differentiate AA, TTM and TC providing an excellent first line method of assessment in clinics obviating the need for hair specimens or biopsy. A handheld dermoscope attached to a digital camera or a smart phone is a new tool of substantial help for diagnosis and management of patchy hair loss.\n\n7(6): 13.\n\nTRICHOSCOPY.NET: A NEW ONLINE PLATFORM FOR TRICHOSCOPY EDUCATION\n\n1 and , MD PhD 1 ,*\n\nA.

Sukhdeo\n\nBackground\n\nDiagnosis of hair and scalp disease requires visualization of hair-bearing areas. Trichoscopy provides additional diagnostic information not available when a physician uses the naked eye. However, trichoscopy implementation remains poor - due in large part to limited education of providers on this subject.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nWe constructed Trichoscopy.Net, a public website and mobile application educational platform to provide a) high quality visual content and text on the basics of trichoscopy, b) examples of normal hair/scalp from multiple ethnicities, and c) diagnosis of common and rare hair disorders.\n\nMethods\n\nTrichoscopic images were collected with patient consent from our specialty hair practice as well as user-submitted images. Images were annotated to facilitate identification of diagnostic features described in the accompanying text.\n\nResults\n\nTrichoscopy.Net is a novel online educational resource accessible online and features a mobile app. New images continue to be added to the platform.\n\nConclusions\n\nWhen trichoscopy is not utilized, patients with scalp and hair disorders are more likely to receive inappropriate care due to misdiagnosis. Lack of accessible teaching resources led us to develop Trichoscopy.Net. It fills a much-needed void in healthcare: a free comprehensive resource for practitioners across various specialties and levels of training.\n\n7(6): 14–15.\n\nTRICHOSCOPY OF CICATRICIAL ALOPECIA: WHAT IS NEW IN THE SKIN OF COLOR?\n\n1 and 2\n\nBalachandra S Ankad\n\n1Department of Dermatology, S Nijalingappa Medical College, Bagalkot-587103, India\n\nFind articles by Balachandra S Ankad\n\nBalkrishna P Nikam\n\n2Department of Dermatology, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, Karad-415110, India\n\nFind articles by Balkrishna P Nikam\n\n1Department of Dermatology, S Nijalingappa Medical College, Bagalkot-587103, India\n\n2Department of Dermatology, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, Karad-415110, India\n\n1 Background: (11-point boldface)\n\nTrichoscopy, the dermoscopy of hair and scalp, has gained an important diagnostic tool due to its non-invasive nature. In cicatricial alopecia, hair follicle is the primary target for the pathogenesis and destruction. Trichoscopy demonstrates different trichoscopic patterns in various primary cicatricial alopecias. Since clinical and histopathological features are overlapping in cicatricial alopecia, the diagnosis is very challenging. Trichoscopy assist to distinguish among different cicatricial alopecia. Here we document the trichoscopic patterns in cicatricial alopecia in skin of color.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nTo evaluate the trichoscopic patterns in cicatricial alopecia in skin of color\n\n3 Methods\n\nThis study was conducted between January 2019 and July 2019 in a tertiary hospital attached to S. Nijalingappa Medical College in South India. Ethical clearance from the institute and informed consent from the patients was obtained. Patients presenting with cicatricial alopecia were selected. Demographic data in respect with age, sex, occupation and skin type was noted. Dermoscopic examination was done with DermLite DL 4 with 10x magnification. Skin biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis. Results have been presented as proportions and percentages.\n\n4 Results\n\nA total of 72 patients with 42 males and 30 females were included in the study. Age ranged from 14 years to 50 years. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) was most common and seen in 35 (48. 6%) patients with lichen planopilaris in 20 (27.7 %) patients. Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), folliculitis decalvans (FD) and pseudopelade of Brocq were observed in 10 (13.8%), 5 (6.9%), and 10 (13.8%) of patients respectively. Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) was seen in 2 (2.7%) patients. Follicular plugs (white and yellow color), yellow dots, black dots, absent follicular openings, follicular red dots, arborizing vessels and blue gray globules were in noted in 15 (42.8%), 5 (14.2%), 2 (5.7%), 20(57.1%), 15 (42.8%), 10 (28.5%) and 20(57.1%) of DLE patients respectively. Peripilar cast, perifollicular scaling, white dots, blue gray globules were seen in 8 (40%), 10 (50%), 8 (40%) and 12 (60%) of LPP patients respectively. Honey comb pigment pattern and absent follicular openings was seen all the patients 10 (100%) of pseudopelade of Brocq. Perifollicular pustules, fibrosis and tufting of hairs are seen in all 5(100%) the cases of FD. Perifollicular blue-gray halo was specifically seen in CCCA. FFA showed lone hairs, erythema, and perifollicular scaling in all the cases (100%). Interestingly, distinctive patterns were noted because of skin of color. Perifollicular erythema in LPP was not noted in this study. Thick arborizing vessels in DLE were not prominent.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nTrichoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia by demonstrating characteristic and specific patterns in follicles and perifollicular structures. We observed few distinctive patterns because of skin of color. Thus trichoscopic patterns differ in skin prototypes. This knowledge is critical in reading the trichoscopic patterns\n\n7(6): 16.\n\nPRESSURE-INDUCED ALOPECIA: PRESENCE OF THIN HAIRS AS A TRICHOSCOPIC CLUE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS\n\n, a , b , a , b , a , c , a and a\n\nDaniel Fernandes Melo\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nbDepartment of Dermatology, Pedro Ernesto University Hospital, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Daniel Fernandes Melo\n\nVioleta Duarte Tortelly\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nbDepartment of Dermatology, Pedro Ernesto University Hospital, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Violeta Duarte Tortelly\n\nBeatriz Serafim Ghedin\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Beatriz Serafim Ghedin\n\nCaren dos Santos Lima\n\ncDepartment of Dermatology, State University of Pará, Belém, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Caren dos Santos Lima\n\nThais Ura Garcia\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Thais Ura Garcia\n\nTaynara de Mattos Barreto\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nFind articles by Taynara de Mattos Barreto\n\naDepartment of Dermatology, Marcílio Dias Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nbDepartment of Dermatology, Pedro Ernesto University Hospital, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\ncDepartment of Dermatology, State University of Pará, Belém, Brazil\n\n*Daniel Fernandes Melo rb.moc.oohay@olemsednanrefleinad\n\n1 Background\n\nPressure-induced alopecia (PA) is a term used to describe a group of scarring and nonscarring alopecias that usually occur following prolonged immobilization.\n\nTrichoscopic findings described in the literature are scarce, nonspecific, and include black dots, broken. hairs, circle hairs, erythema, and ulcerations.\n\nHair loss happens because of tissue ischemia caused by prolonged pressure on the scalp, which results in compression of the vessels surrounding hair follicles with the cessation of their activity.\n\n2 Observation\n\nWe report 3 cases of PA in which vellus hairs and residual thin hairs were preserved. Since vellus and thin hair bulbs are located more superficially than the terminal ones, they will experience less injury and hypoxia, leading to preservation of those hair shafts.\n\nA possible reason would be that the pressure distribution occurs in a conical shape, similar to what happens in pressure ulcers, so it exposes deeper tissues to a higher pressure, leading these areas to suffer more from ischemia.\n\nWe suggest that the presence of thin and vellus hairs should be considered as a trichoscopic clue for PA diagnosis in doubtful cases.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nWe reported 3 cases of PA in which clinical and trichoscopic features led to a correct diagnosis. Many vellus hairs and residual thin hairs were observed in all cases, and their presence may be explained by their lower metabolic rates and/or the more superficial insertion of their bulbs. These trichoscopic features have not yet been reported in the literature. Although more studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to confirm our observations, we suggest that they should be considered as trichoscopic clues for PA diagnosis in doubtful cases.\n\n1 Background\n\nTinea capitis (TC) is a superficial fungal infection of the scalp which diagnosis relies on mycological examination. Dermoscopy is a technique that has been suggested to facilitate the diagnosis of TC. Some dermoscopic features have been associated with the diagnosis of TC including comma hair (CH), corkscrew hair (CSH) and zigzag hair (ZH).\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 7-year-old girl presented with a one-month history of an asymptomatic patch on her face. Clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated, desquamative, erythematous patch on her forehead which extended to her left eyebrow. The rest of physical examination was normal. Dermoscopy revealed the presence of CH, CSH, ZZH, black dots and scales. Direct examination showed an ectothrix invasion and the fungal culture showed the presence of Microsporum canis. The patient was treated with griseofulvin 20mg/Kg/day for six weeks with complete resolution. All dermoscopic features also disappeared after the treatment.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nIn TC, many dermoscopic aspects have been described including BCH, CH and ZH. CH and CSH are the most frequently observed hair shaft abnormalities. CH represent broken hairs resulting from cracking and bending of a hair shaft filled with hyphae while CSH seems to be a variation of CH, manifesting mostly in black patients. Our observation is original by the atypical localization of TC. It also emphasizes the importance of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of TC and follow up in the daily routine of dermatologists.\n\n7(6): 18.\n\nTITLE: “CLUSTER OF STAR APPEARANCE” A NEW TRICHOSCOPY MARKER FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ATRICHIA CONGENITA WITH PAPULAR LESION.\n\nA. Deep Jarsania1\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nFind articles by A. Deep Jarsania1\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nCategory: Trichoscopy\n\n1 Background\n\nAtrichia congenita with papular lesions(APL) represents a complex and heterogenous group of genodermatoses with unclear etiopathogenesis. It is characterized by hair loss soon after birth and is associated with development of keratin filled cysts over the body. Ahmed et al was the first who referred to this condition as congenital atrichia. Homozygous mutations in the hairless gene (HR) have been implicated. We herein report a child with congenital atrichia with papular lesion, which is very rarely reported in the literature and its characteristic dermoscopic findings.\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 5 year old female child was brought to the outpatient department for decreased hair growth over the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes since birth with no significant family history. On clinical examination, 10-15 sparse discrete, lusterless hairs with rough texture were present over scalp. She also had complete absence of hair over eyebrows, eyelashes since birth. On closer cutaneous examination tiny monomorphic keratinous papules were seen over the scalp. Dermoscopy of the scalp revealed cluster of white dots distributed across the entire scalp.\n\nOn trichoscopy, we noted a characterised pattern of cluster of white dots on the scalp, which has been described as a “cluster of stars” appearance. On the basis of dermoscopy and clinical findings congenital atrichia with papular lesion was diagnosed.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nThis case highlights the trichoscopy findings that appears to be a characteristic finding for the disease. Thus we present this case as it is rare and giving a characteristic clinical and new trichoscopy finding in the era. Dermoscopy forms a noninvasive diagnostic tool and it may obviated the need of scalp biopsy especially in pediatric age group.\n\n7(6): 19.\n\nA CLINICAL CASE OF COMEDO NAEVUS OF THE SCALP IN A 6-YEARS OLD MALE CHILD\n\nBackground\n\nComedo naevus (nevus comedonicus, NC) is a type of an epidermal nevus, a pilosebaceous hamartoma. It is characterized by linear lesions comprising dilated follicular openings with keratinous plugs resembling classical comedones. They may be present at birth or appear later. (Ripudaman Arora et al., 2016).\n\nObservation\n\nA 6-year-old boy presented with asymptomatic comedo-like lesion on the occipital region of the scalp since birth. There was no history of irritation or a familial history of similar lesions. Cutaneous examination revealed groups of dilated follicular openings filled with yellowish and light brown, hard plugs distributed on the occipital region in 4 cm × 2 cm area. Comedo extraction is not easily achieved. Single terminal hair was visualized in the lesion. General physical and systemic examination, routine laboratory investigations were normal. Trichoscopy (nonpolarized × 60, × 200) showing multiple ostia containg yellowish keratinous material and well-defined, structure-less, light brown homogenous circular areas around it.\n\nKey Message\n\nDiagnosis of NC is based on clinical examination and trichoscopy. Dermatologists should be aware of potential association of NC with skin tumors and extracutaneous manifestations (NC syndrome).

Presence of scattered discrete circle hairs have been reported in androgenetic alopecia (AGA); but no significance has yet been associated.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine association of circle hairs in AGA with biochemical markers of autoimmunity.\n\nMethods\n\n30 AGA patients aged between 25-50 years, with and without trichoscopic presence of circle hairs were included as cases and controls respectively. Biochemical markers of autoimmunity including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TGA) were performed in all patients. Histopathological correlation was done in 6 consenting cases.\n\nResults\n\nTrichoscopy revealed discrete presence of circle hairs in more than 3 out of 10 pre-determined fields examined in 30 cases, in addition to hair diameter diversity, numerous vellus hairs, yellow dots and peripilar sign seen in all cases and age/sexmatched controls. Personal and/ or family history of hypothyroidism, AA or vitiligo was noted in 11 cases and 6 controls. TPO and/ or TGA were significantly higher in cases (56.7%) than in controls (13.3%) with p value <0.01. ANA was positive in 6 cases and 1 control. Histopathological correlation of circle hairs showed lymphocytic microfolliculitis at the level of isthmus and/or bulb of occasional vellus hair.\n\nConclusions\n\nTrichoscopic finding of circle hairs in AGA seems to correlate with biochemical markers of autoimmunity. Such cases could point towards presence of immunologically driven trigger in AGA. Cases with a positive autoimmune profile responded well to topical steroids given in addition to AGA specific treatment. Further studies need to be done to elucidate this hypothesis.\n\n7(6): 21.\n\nTRICHOTILLOMANIA: THE IMPORTANCE OF DERMOSCOPIC FEATURES\n\n, 1 ,* , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5\n\nNatália Andressa Buss Venier1\n\n1Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Natália Andressa Buss Venier1\n\nIsadora da Luz\n\n2Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Isadora da Luz\n\nAna Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\n3Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Ana Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\nLeandro Damiani\n\n4Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Leandro Damiani\n\nRenan Minotto\n\n4Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Renan Minotto\n\n1Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n2Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n3Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n4Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n5Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n1 Background\n\nTricoscopy is a noninvasive exam and has specific findings of trichotillomania and assist in the differentiation of alopecia. We report a digital dermatoscopy of a case of trichotillomania where the patient presented scalp rarefaction and no characteristic plaque of the lesion.\n\n2 Observation\n\nDigital dermatoscopy performed on a 56-year-old female patient complaining of hair loss. Macroscopy presence of mild midline rarefaction. In the dermatoscopy of the vertex presence of broken wires, hook wires, black and yellow dots and bizarre wires. Suggestive diagnosis of trichotillomania.\n\nExamination of the scalp of patients with trichotillomania generally reveals asymmetrical alopecia plaque, mainly in the frontal region and vertex. Hair with different lengths and short vellus. The tensile test is negative in periphery of them. Other disorders is observed like compulsive disorders such as onychophagy and onicotylomania\n\nTrichoscopy shows decreased hair density, short vellus hair, broken hairs with different shaft lengths, coiled hairs, short vellus hair, trichoptilosis, sparse yellow dots, which may or may not contain black dots and no exclamation mark hairs.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as dermoscopy, since histopathological study may be inconclusive is essential because allopecia have different prognoses and treatments.\n\n7(6): 22.\n\nOVERSIZED BLACK DOTS: A UNIQUE TRICHOSCOPIC FINDING SUPPORTING THE DIAGNOSIS OF TRICHOTILLOMANIA BUT NOT OF ALOPECIA AREATA\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nM.

Ohyama\n\n+81-422-47-5511\n\nBackground\n\nTrichotillomania (TTM) clinically mimics alopecia areata (AA) and differential diagnosis can be challenging. Relatively-specific signs of TMM, including follicular microhemorrhage (FMH) and V-sign, have been reported and used in daily practice; however, they are not frequently observed. Therefore, more specific and easilydetectable signs of TTM are still needed.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nWe have noticed TTM often demonstrates unique black dots characterized by wider and more irregular endings than typical black dots. We named this sign “oversized black dots (OBD)” and evaluated its diagnostic significance in TTM.\n\nMethods\n\nTrichoscopic images of 25 TTM cases and 25 AA controls were analyzed. First, the frequency of OBD was assessed in TTM and AA respectively. Then black dots/hair shaft (BD/HS) Index, defined as the value of area of black dots/putative cross-sectional area of hair shafts was calculated utilizing Image J software.\n\nResults\n\nOBD was detected in 13 out of 25 TTM but undetectable in any AA cases. The frequency of OBD was remarkably higher than those of other TTM signs, such as FMH and V-sign. BD/HS index was significantly higher in TTM than in AA.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results suggest that combination of OBD with other TTM signs might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of TTM. The mechanism of OBD remains elusive; however, we speculate that destruction of hair shafts by mechanical pulling and subsequent breakage of elastic fiber might contribute to OBD formation.\n\n7(6): 23.\n\nINTERESTING SIGNS IN TRICHOSCOPY- “THE NEW KIDS IN THE BLOCK”\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nSradda Naidu Kona\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nFind articles by Sradda Naidu Kona\n\nRachita Dhurat\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nFind articles by Rachita Dhurat\n\nAseem Sharma\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nFind articles by Aseem Sharma\n\nSandip Agrawal\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nFind articles by Sandip Agrawal\n\n1Department of Dermatology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nCategory: Trichoscopy\n\n1 Background\n\nThe world of trichology keeps unfolding with new secrets with every new invention. With the aid of a simple tool like trichoscopy we have put together a few new signs which help us broden our horizons.\n\n2 Observation\n\na. The ‘halo’ and ‘wipeout’ signs to differentiate black dots from hair dust on trichoscopy”- These are 2 simple novale signs which differentiates black dots from hair dust on simple epilumiscence microscopy. Due to the presence of the hair shaft below the black dots, they appear to have a grayish halo around (Halo sign) unlike the hair dust which can be wiped out with a cotton bud or Q- tip.(Wipeout sign)\n\nb. Broom Hair sign on trichoscopy and Hamburger sign and Gear Wheel appearance on histhopathology seen in a case of lichen simplex chronicus of the scalp where multiple hairs arise from a single folicular opening.\n\nc. Flame sign seen in Trichotillomania –\n\nFlame hair is a type of proximal hair residue, whichremains attached to the scalp after pulling anagen hair.\n\nd. Pigtail hairs seen in Telogen effluvium-\n\nTelogen effluvium is one of the most common type of nonscarring hair loss. Although trichoscopic features of TE are not characteristic but upright short regrowing hair have been decsribed most commonly. Some of these hair may take the shape of Pigtail hair.\n\ne. Chrysalis sign in Angiolymphoid Hyperplasia with Eosinophilia (ALHE) of the scalp-\n\nA 35 yr old female, came with a complaint of multiple asymptomatic lesion over scalp since 2 years. On trichoscopy, small areas of white criss cross pattern was seen similar to hard outer case of a chrysalis- Chrysalis sign\n\n3 Key Message\n\nThis report brings into light the use of trichoscopy as a quick non-invasive diagnostic aid that can help delinéate specific signs in trichology from the common differentials\n\n7(6): 24.\n\nTRICHOSCOPY OF PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS IN REMISSION.

Chaidemenos. rg.teneto@sogroigc\n\nBackground\n\nOne of the controversies in the treatment of Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV), is the time of treatment cessation. Scalp involvement is often the most stubborn to treatment body site and may reflect disease activity. Trichoscopy (Dermoscopy of scalp) features have not been studied in clinically “healthy-looking” skin of patients in full remission.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nTo find out if there are any trichoscopy features in PV patients in clinical and immunologic remission, and accommodate treatment decision\n\nMethods\n\nThe age and disease duration of the 3 women with PV were correspondingly 62, 63, 55 and 5, 6, 15 years. Treatment at examination was 2,5 mg prednisone(Pr), for the last 22, 5 and 7 months. The 2nd patient also required 1 mg/kg/d Azathioprine. Anti Desmoglein antibodies turned to negative since Oct/2017, Feb/2017, Sept/2015. Contact dermoscopy and hand lens X10 magnifier for clinical evaluation, were used.\n\nResults\n\nA red hue background, peripillar scales and tubular casts were observed by trichoscopy in the first 2 patients. Only peripilar scales on a small brown roundish area were the features in the 3rd patient. Treatment cessation was decided only in this patient, since casts are considered as a consequence of outer root sheath acantholysis and a sign of disease activity\n\nConclusions\n\nAreas of red hue skin background and movable cylindical scales (casts) around hair shafts may be observed, even in the absence of apparent scalp clinical involvement, in PV patients in remission. Since these features may drive physicians to treatment continuation, Dermoscopy of the scalp is required in clinically “healthy-looking” PV patients, before a decision of treatment cessation is made. Future studies with greater number of patients, furtherly validated by long term disease course outcome, are needed\n\n7(6): 25.\n\nTHE ROLE OF ULTRAVIOLET-ENHANCED TRICHOSCOPY ON THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF TINEA CAPITIS\n\n, 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 ,*\n\nIsadora da Luz Silva\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Isadora da Luz Silva\n\nAline Alves Domingues\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Aline Alves Domingues\n\nAna Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Ana Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\nNatália Andressa Buss Venier\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Natália Andressa Buss Venier\n\nLeonardo Albarello\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Leonardo Albarello\n\nLeandro Damiani\n\n1Dermatology Department of Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Leandro Damiani\n\n1 Background\n\nA 67-year-old woman with a one-year history of multiple plaques covering her scalp, based on erythematous and meliceric crusts was referred to our Department of Dermatology to evaluation. Trichoscopy showed comma, corkscrew, zigzag and broken hairs, as well as black dots and white sheaths. We performed ultraviolet-enhanced trichoscopy, which showed a characteristic fluorescence of yellow-green color, suggesting Microsporum colonization. The scalp biopsy and direct mycological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Tinea capitis.\n\n2 Observation\n\nTinea capitis is a common scalp infection in children and could happen rarely in adults. It's caused by a range of dermatophyte species. The diagnosis include characteristic dermoscopy, direct mycological examination, culture and, sometimes, scalp biopsy. However, we can also perform ultraviolet-enhanced trichoscopy to earlier diagnosis and subsequent initiation of treatment. UV-enhanced trichoscopy is a method that combines trichoscopy with the effect of a Wood's lamp examination. The Wood's light induces different types of fluorescence by the infectious agent or its metabolites. When colonizing the hair with Microsporum canis and another species of Microsporum we can observe a bright yellow-green to whitish-green fluorescence.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nThe ultraviolet-enhanced trichoscopy is a non-invasive and easy to use instrument. This feature antecipates and enhances the diagnostic potential of trichoscopy in Tinea capitis.\n\n7(6): 26.\n\nCLINICAL AND TRICHOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF ISOTRETINOIN EFFICACY IN LICHEN PLANOPILARIS\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 and 1\n\nM.

Rudnicka\n\n1Warsaw Medical University, Poland\n\nFind articles by L. Rudnicka\n\nBackground\n\nLichen planopilaris is the most frequent cause of primary lymphocytic scarring alopecia. Several treatment strategies have been proposed in classic lichen planopilaris (LPP), although there is no gold standard of therapeutic approach.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of our study was evaluation of isotretinoin efficacy in lichen planopilaris on a basis of clinical picture and trichoscopy examination.\n\nMethods\n\nA retrospective review of medical records of twenty four patients with histological diagnosis of lichen planopilaris were made. Trichoscopy was performed after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment and then every 3 months for a year.\n\nResults\n\nAll patients were treated with isotretinoin at a dose of 20 mg per day. Initially trichoscopic examination of all patients showed perifollicular scaling, perifollicular erythema and elongated parallel oriented blood vessels close to the hair follicle. After 12 weeks of treatment the trichoscopic feature of active LPP were absent in 79.2% (19/24) of patients, although some clinical signs of LPP were still present.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis retrospective study demonstrate the beneficial effects of isotretinoin in lichen planopilaris. Trichoscopy is an effective method for assessing the effectiveness of treatment of lichen planopilaris.\n\n7(6): 27.\n\nHOW IMPORTANT IS TRICHOSCOPY IN DIAGNOSTICS OF LOOSE ANAGEN SYNDROME?\n\n, 1 , 1 and 1\n\nE.

Khobzei\n\n1Euroderm medical centre, Ukraine\n\nFind articles by K. Khobzei\n\nBackground\n\nLoose anagen syndrome (LAS) is a rare form of hair loss which is usually diagnosed within young girls with blond hair and complaints regarding the lack of hair growth. In some cases clinical picture of LAS may be atypical.\n\nObservation\n\nThree cases were included in the study. All patients were 4 to 6 y.o. girls. Two patients (67%) had a typical clinical presentation: blond, thin and sparse hair, inability to grow long hair, and highly positive pull test. One patient (33%) had atypical clinical picture presentation: darker blond long hair, no complaints on excessive hair shedding and slightly positive pull test.\n\nOn trichoscopy at 20x magnification major predominance of single hair follicular units was observed in all patients (100%). Rectangular black granular structures and solitary yellow dots were found in 33%. At 70x magnification typical for LAS changes of hair roots were noticed in 100% cases: a hairy cuticle resembling a crumpled sock, hair bulb was at an acute angle to the shaft resembling a «mouse tail».\n\nKey Message\n\nTrichoscopy is non-invasive method which is of great value in the diagnosing of LAS especially within patients with atypical clinical presentation. Thus, high magnification trichoscopy of hair roots is recommended for routine examination of patients complaining for hair loss in order not to overlook LAS.\n\n1 Background\n\nWhite Piedra (WP) is a rare, asymptomatic, superficial fungal infection caused by yeastlike organisms of the Trichosporon genus. It commonly affects beard hairs' shafts, moustache, genitals, axilla and scalp.\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 10-year-old girl presented for asymptomatic whitish particles in the scalp hair evolving since 6 months. It was encircling almost the entirety of the scalp hairs' shafts, easily detachable and measuring 1 to 1.5 mm. Dermoscopy examination showed whitish peripilar casts attached to distal parts of the hair with normal aspect of scalp skin. A detailed interrogation revealed the history of tying wet hairs after washing. The diagnosis of white piedra was suggested then confirmed by a mycological examination which revealed a trichosporon asahii. The patient was advised to keep the hair dry, and was treated with 2% ketoconazole shampoo topically daily for 2 months with oral fluconazole for 3 months. We noted a good evolution and disappearance of the casts after the treatment.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nWe described the clinical and dermoscopic features of a rare case of scalp white piedra caused by an infrequent species of trichosporon «Trichosporon Asahii». Human hair colonization may occur as a result of poor personal hygiene, persistence of warmth and moist on the scalp, and excessive use of hair oils. Dermoscopy guide the diagnosis by eliminating other defects such as traction hair cast, trichorrhexis nodosa and monilethrix.\n\n7(6): 29.\n\nANALYSES OF 29 CASES OF TRICHOTILLOMANIA: TRICHOSCOPIC FEATURES\n\nState Research Center of Dermatovenereology and Cosmetology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Russian Federation\n\n1 Background\n\nDiagnosis of trichotillomania is often difficult in clinical practice.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of the study was to detect the main trichoscopic features of trichotillomania. This study included 29 patients with trichotillomania (female − 24, male − 5; between 7 and 52 years of age; сhildren − 27, adults − 2).\n\n3 Methods\n\nThe diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of hair loss problem included a detailed history, examination of the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes and trichoscopy.\n\n4 Results\n\nExamination of the scalp revealed assymetrical areas with low overall density and varying hair lengths mainly located in parietal and temporal regions in 22 patients; total process in 4 patients, trichotillomania without visible patches of alopecia − 3 patients, eyebrows − 4, eyelashes − 3 patients. Trichoscopy of trichotillomania showed hair with fraying of ends, breakage at different lengths, black dots, short and coiled hairs, tulip hairs, v – hairs, trichoptilosis and amorphous hair residues.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nIt is important to consider various trichoscopic findings together to establish the diagnosis of trichotillomania. Thus, the most frequent trichoscopic features of trichotillomania in our study: black dots and broken at varying length hairs.\n\n7(6): 30.\n\nCLINICAL AND TRICHOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF ISOTRETINOIN EFFICACY IN DISSECTING CELLULITIS\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 and 1\n\nM.

Rudnicka\n\n1Warsaw Medical University, Poland\n\nFind articles by L. Rudnicka\n\nBackground\n\nDissecting cellulitis is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease starting with occlusion of follicular openings on the vertex or in the occipital area of the scalp. Afterwards it manifest as perifollicular pustules, nodules, abscesses and sinuses with interconnecting sinus tracts leading to scarring alopecia. Treatment generally fails to obtain a permanently successful result, therefore, many therapeutic options have been proposed. There are case reports in the literature showing successful treatment of dissecting cellulitis with isotretinoin.\n\nObservation\n\nWe report patient with dissecting cellulitis treated with oral isotretinoin at a dose of 30 mg per day for 12 months. The diagnosis was made on a basis of clinical picture, trichoscopy and histopathological examination. Initially before treatment trichosopy shows yellow structureless areas and yellow dots with a “three-dimensional (3D)” structure imposed over dystrophic hair shafts. Also black dots and pinpoint-like vessels with a whitish halo were present. After a year of treatment, all trichosopic features of the active phase of the disease resolved, and only confluent ivory-white areas lacking follicular openingswas were visible.\n\nKey message\n\nThis case report demonstrate the beneficial effects of isotretinoin in dissecting cellulitis and shows that trichoscopy is an excellent method for assessing the efficacy of treatment of scaring alopecia.\n\n7(6): 31.\n\nTHE EFFICACY OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH INTRADERMAL CORTICOSTEROID INJECTIONS IN ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA\n\n, 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 1 ,*\n\nN.

Karazin Kharkiv National University, Kharkiv, Ukraine\n\n4Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nBackground\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of alopecia in women and men. The recently described nonandrogenic cofactors of the etiology of AGA are focused on the study of microinflammation associated with the appearance of perifollicular lymphocytic infiltration. Trichoscopically, microinflammation is represented by perifollicular discoloration or perifollicular hyperpigmentation. This phenomenon is observed in 20-66% of patients and affects 32.4 ± 4.7% of hair follicles and correlates with a low response to topical minoxidil therapy. This has lead to the search for antiinflammatory therapy for patients with AGA.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment of patients with AGA with topical minoxidil and intradermal injections of corticosteroids compared with monotherapy with topical minoxidil.\n\nMethods\n\n46 patients: men (Norwood-Hamilton Stage I–IV) and women (Ludwig I-II) with AGA manifesting perifollicular microinflammation and with no previously recommended hair growth stimulants were included in a comparative study. The first group (23 patients) received topical minoxidil (5% concentration,1ml b.i.d) and intradermal injections of corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide 5 mg / ml once every 4 weeks), the second group (23 patients) received topical minoxidil monotherapy (5% concentration, 1 ml b.i.d). After 12 weeks of therapy, a comparative assessment of the total density of the hair was made using the phototrichogram method.\n\nResults\n\nProvisional results of the therapy efficacy in two groups shows a positive trend in both groups with a predominant response to treatment in patients in the first group of 82.6% and 52.1% respectively.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn our opinion, the provisional results of the study on the comparative efficacy of monotherapy with topical minoxidil and minoxidil in combination with intradermal corticosteroids require a longer observation period and further study of the comparative dynamics of other parameters of hair growth.\n\n7(6): 32.\n\nCOMPULSIVE TRICHOSES: СLINICAL CASES, TRICHOSCOPIC FEATURES\n\nState Research Center of Dermatovenereology and Cosmetology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Russian Federation\n\n1 Background\n\nDiagnosis of trichotillomania is often difficult in clinical practice.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of the study was to detect the main trichoscopic features of compulsive trichoses. This study included 29 patients with trichotillomania, 2 – trichoteiromania, 1 – trichotillomania in combination with trichotemnomania.\n\n3 Methods\n\nThe diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of hair loss problem included a detailed history, examination of the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes and trichoscopy.\n\n4 Results\n\nExamination of the scalp revealed assymetrical areas with low overall density and varying hair lengths mainly located in parietal and temporal regions in 22 patients; diffuse hair shedding in 4 patients, eyebrows − 4, eyelashes − 3 patients. Trichoscopy of trichotillomania showed hair with fraying of ends, breakage at different lengths, black dots, short and coiled hairs, tulip hairs, v – hairs, trichoptilosis and amorphous hair residues; trichoteiromania – trichoptilosis and scaling.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nIt is important to consider various trichoscopic findings together to establish the diagnosis of compulsive trichoses. Thus, the most frequent trichoscopic features in our study: black dots and broken at varying length hairs, trichoptiloses.\n\n7(6): 33.\n\nSCALP DYSESTHESIA IN A 9 YEAR OLD DIAGNOSED ON TRICHOSCOPY\n\n1 ,*\n\nDR.

SAMIPA SAMIR MUKHERJEE\n\n1MBBS, DDV, DDVL, FRGUHS (Pediatric Dermatology), Consultant Pediatric\n\nDermatologist and Dermatologist, Cloudnine Hospitals, Bengaluru, India\n\n1 Background\n\nDysesthesia is used as a generic term for cutaneous symptoms such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain—without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location. It is often described as a condition with symptoms without any objective finding. The symptoms are often triggered by physical or psychological stress.\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 9 year old male child, first born of non consanguineous marriage with an insignificant birth history was brought to the dermatology outpatient department with complaints of burning sensation and pain localised to the vertex area of the scalp of about 3months duration. The mother gave history of significant sibling rivalry and por scholastic performance. He was treated with local application of topical steroid for three weeks elsewhere with no response. The mother had applied turmeric to the affected zone as a traditional home remedy for providing soothening effect with no response. Scalp examination revealed multiple broken and short hair on the vertex area with no obvious patchy hair loss. Trichoscopic examination revealed multiple broom hair with trichorrhexis nodosa in one of the hair. A provisional diagnosis of scalp dysesthesia was made and the child was referred for psychiatric evaluation where the diagnosis was confirmed and the child treated accordingly.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nTrichoscopy serves as an important aid in the rapid diagnosis of common to rare disorders even when cutaneous clues are not obvious to the naked eye.\n\n7(6): 34.\n\nTRICHOSCOPIC FINDINGS IN 29 MEN WITH FRONTAL FIBROSING ALOPECIA.

The last 10 years there has been a large worldwide increase in the incidence of FFA, as well as occurrence in both premenopausal women and men. Trichoscopy is a valuable noninvasive method to differentiate clinically hair diseases.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe main aim of this study was to research and document the trichoscopic findings of 29 male patients with a diagnosis of FFA attending the Department of Physiology-Hair Disorders at “Andreas Sygros” Hospital in Athens, Greece.\n\nMethods\n\nThe studying process included a questionnaire for collecting demographic data and information on the patient's personal medical record as well as information on their family's record. The examination was carried out using a polarized and a non-polarized dermatoscope and pictures of the examined areas were taken as well.\n\nA statistical analysis of the findings was conducted and once completed the study's final conclusions were drawn.\n\nResults\n\nThe trichoscopic findings were similar with those that have been observed in women FFA patients. Differences in the severity of the disease were observed clinically and trichoscopicaly.\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough FFA was considered a female disease, it is also observed in men. Trichoscopy is a reliable and helpful method to diagnose most of hair diseases, especially FFA.\n\n7(6): 35.\n\nTRICHOSCOPY CLINCHES THE DIAGNOSIS OF NEONATAL SCURVY\n\n, 1 ,* , 2 , 3 and 3\n\nDR.

It is a condition characterized by general weakness, anemia, gum disease, and skin hemorrhages caused by a prolonged deficiency of vitamin C. Since the body is unable to synthesize vitamin C it predominantly relies on dietary sources for the same. Even though the number of people suffering from Scurvy has largely come down, poor diet or eating habits can lead to Scurvy. Literature suggests that children who suffer from autism spectrum disorders are more likely to suffer from scurvy. Although easy to diagnose when the signs and symptoms are obvious it may pose a diagnostic challenge in a neonate owing to the lack of classical symptoms and signs.\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 3 day old male child born of normal delivery to nonconsanguineous parents was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit as a floppy baby. Dermatological consultation was sought for the skin lesions on bilateral shin of lower limbs. Parents gave history of the lesions being present since birth. On cutaneous examination multiple grouped coiled and circle hair were noted over bilateral shins. Dermoscopic examination revealed multiple corkscrew and coiled hair with follicular and peri follicular purpura. The pale orange perifollicular halo described in literatura was not seen in our case which could be due to the skin of color. Based on trichoscopic evaluation a provisional diagnosis of scurvy was considered. Serum testing revealed low plasma vitamin C level (less than 0.2mg/dl), which was consistent with the diagnosis of scurvy. Further investigation of the mother revealed low plasma vitamin C level although she was asymptomatic.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nTrichoscopy serves not only as a rapid bedside investigative tool but also proves diagnostic in common to rare disorders which evades the naked eye examination.\n\n7(6): 36.\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF 300 FRONTAL FIBROSING ALOPECIA PATIENTS.

(moc.liamg@hcraeseripasahc)\n\nBackground\n\nFrontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA) is a cicatricial alopecia. In recent years there has been a worldwide increase in the incidence FFA.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nThe purpose of this study was to record the epidemiological data of patients with FFA examined at “Α. Sygros “ hospital, as well as investigating the possible factors that may affect the disease, as there is no such study in Greece so far.\n\nMethods\n\n300 patients with FFA were enrolled in the hospital, and a special questionnaire based on their socio-demographic and medical information was used in order to collect the data and to investigate the factors likely to be associated with the disease.\n\nThe Kolmogorov test for the regularity of distributions, the X2-test, the Mann-Whitney Test, the variance analysis was used as statistical analysis methods and the statistical program SPSS 22.0 for the analysis.\n\nResults\n\n300 patients were studied, of whom 284 (94.7%) were women and 16 men (5.3%). Their age ranged from 26 to 92 years with an average of 61.7. The duration of the disease ranged from 0.5-32 years with an average of 6.6 years. 159 patients (53%) had a less than 1 cm recession, 93 (31%) had 1-2.99 cm, 35 (11.7%) 3-4.99, and 13 (4.3%) had 5-6.99cm. 12.7% of women had ovariectomy with an average ovariectomy age of 47 years (21-74). 56.3% of the patients were suffering from thyroid disease, 34% from hyperlipidemia, 22.7% from anemia, 15.7% from hypertension, 8% from osteoporosis, 7.7% from depression and 5.7% from allergies. 40.3% of them had a family history of androgenetic alopecia, and 13.3% FFA.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe completion of the study highlighted the epidemiological data of the patients and the findings are consistent with the results of relevant studies from the international literature.\n\n7(6): 37.\n\nCOSMETIC COLOR PRODUCTS CAN MIMIC PATHOLOGICAL TRICHOSCOPIC FINDINGS: A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS AND REPRODUCING TEST USING LEMON'S SKIN\n\n, 1 , 2 , 3 ,* and 1 , 2\n\nM.

However, deposition of cosmetic color products used for filling spaces, dyeing or volumnising hair can mimic concerning findings and confuse practitioners during observation. No previous studies has systematically analyzed the artificial trichoscopic signs due to hair dye usage.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo identify artificial trichoscoping findings from cosmetic hair dye use and analyze the mechanism of their depotision.\n\nMethods\n\nTrichoscopic images, taken from patients who visited our hair clinic, were retrospectively reviewed to detected artificial findings. Additionally, currently-available over-the counter color products were applied to the skin surface of lemons to reproduce these artifacts.\n\nResults\n\nColor products applied to scalps were categorized into three types based on texture differences: fiber, liquid, and powder type. These findings were successfully reproduced on lemon skin, thus illuminating the putative mechanism of artificial staining. Dents stained by liquid-type resembled black dots and scattered artifacts by fibre-type mimicked broken hairs. Powder-type diffusely destributed over intra- and inter-dents spaces and developed irregular stains.\n\nConclusion\n\nArtefactual trichoscopic can mislead practitioners especially when diagnosing major hair disorders including alopecia areata, trichotillomania, and tinea capitis. Thus, signs due to hair dye usage should be considered in the differentials.\n\n7(6): 38.\n\nPERMANENT CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED ALOPECIA: A COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT THROUGH TRICHOSCOPY, CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY AND HISTOLOGY\n\n, 1 , 1 ,* , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 and 1\n\nM.

CIA is usually non-scarring, temporary and reversible and defined as permanent (pCIA) when lasts more than 6 months after stopping chemotherapy. No data exists on trichoscopic and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) features in pCIA patients, as well as the histopathologic criteria for this particular subset population are scant and not entirely defined.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nOur aim was to elucidate pCIA diagnostic profile through the use of three techniques: trichoscopy, RCM and histology.\n\nMethods\n\nAn observational study was conducted among patients suffering from pCIA. Acquisition of clinical images and trichoscopy were carried out using Fotofinder Medicam 800 HD. In the same areas where the trichoscopic images had been acquired, RCM was carried out via Vivascope 3000. A 4.0-mm punch biopsy was taken from each patient for histological sections.\n\nResults\n\nMost of the patients showed a shedding pattern characterized by diffuse alopecia with accentuation on the vertex. A pattern similar to AGA and alopecia areata could be considered as the trichoscopic expression of pCIA. Such data has been confirmed by both RCM and histology.\n\nConclusions\n\npCIA is probably an underestimated entity and still little investigated. More studies are needed to clarify the differences or the similarities between CIA and pCIA, with the aim to avoid the onset of such irreversible and psychologically devastating form of alopecia.\n\n7(6): 39.\n\nLICHEN PLANOPILARIS OVERLAP WITH FEMALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS: TRICHOSCOPY FINDINGS\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nM Recoder\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by M Recoder\n\nF Mariotto\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by F Mariotto\n\nA Mariotto\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by A Mariotto\n\nB Drumond\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by B Drumond\n\nBackground\n\nFemale androgenetic alopecia is an asymptomatic disease with slow and progressive evolution presenting diffuse hair thinning most pronounced in the midline part of the scalp.\n\nThe pathogenesis is based on the miniaturization of dihydrotestosterone-mediated follicles in androgen-dependent areas of the scalp.\n\nAnamnesis and physical examination including trichoscopy are enough to diagnose most of the cases.\n\nLichen planopilaris is the most common cause of primary immune-mediated cicatricial alopecia and it is part of the spectrum of lymphocytic scarring alopecias.\n\nObservation\n\nWe present a case of a 43 years old female patient with both diseases coexisting.\n\nHer prior complaint was hair thinning and decrease of hair density. During trichoscopy using a manual dermoscope device we detected thickness heterogeneity of hair shafts and increased proportion of vellus hair on frontal scalp but we also found a patch of alopecia on the occipital area with absence of follicular openings in a milk-red area, perifollicular erythema and concentric scaling around the follicles on the periphery of the patch.\n\nThe absence of follicular openings indicates cicatricial alopecia therefore we followed with a dermoscopy guided punch biopsy witch confirmed both diagnoses: androgenetic alopecia and lichen planopilaris.\n\nKey message\n\nWhole scalp trichoscopy must be performed during consultation even though the patient has specific complaint. It is important to remember that different diseases can coexist.\n\n7(6): 40.\n\nPATTERNED TRICHOTILLOMANIA IN ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA\n\n1 ,* and 2\n\nL.E.

Rudnicka\n\n1Hair Restoration Center, Dermika Dermatologic Laser Center, Guadalajara, Mexico\n\n2Department of Dermatology, CSK MSWiA, Warsaw, Poland\n\n1 Background\n\nTrichotillomania is a common disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of pulling hair from different parts of the body. The estimated prevalence for this form of traction alopecia is 0.5–2% in the general population that contrasts with prevalence of other types of hair loss as androgenetic alopecia that is up to 80% of men and 50% of women in the course of their life.\n\n2 Observation\n\nWe described three cases of adult men of 29, 37 and 42 years-old with Hamilton-Norwood II to V androgenetic alopecia under treatment with 5% topical minoxidil, oral finasteride 1 mg or oral dutasteride 0.5 mg. They were evaluated in follow-up appointments and concerned for worsening or non clinical response in most affected areas of the patterned hair loss. On trichoscopic evaluation irregularly broken hairs, vsign and flame hairs were identified on vertex or sagittal areas. When interrogated patients accepted that pulling out the hair when increasing sense of tension, a constant touching on the most affected hair loss areas to corroborate hair regrowth or repetitive manipulation was a common behavior difficult to resist.\n\nOver the last years trichoscopy has become an important technique that offers the proper diagnosis of trichotillomania by analyzing the hair shaft structure and size. Flame hairs, vsign, tulip hairs and hair powder and in general irregularly broken hairs are the most important features. All these type of abnormal hair shafts were broken by the patient by traumatic pulling and this is particularly important in the correlation with disease pathogenesis. The psychosocial aspects of trichotillomania must not be underestimated. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case series report of compulsive traction alopecia in specific areas affected with androgenetic hair loss.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nThese three cases expose the importance of the use of trichoscopy in follow up consultations even in apparently well know patients because stress about the treatment outcomes and anxiety may lead to obsessive compulsive disorders in androgenetic alopecia patients where trichotillomania may coexist.\n\n7(6): 41.\n\nPRESSURE-INDUCED ALOPECIA: TRICHOSCOPY FINDINGS\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nM Recoder\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by M Recoder\n\nF Mariotto\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by F Mariotto\n\nA Mariotto\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by A Mariotto\n\nB Drumond\n\n1Instituto Mariotto Recoder, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nFind articles by B Drumond\n\nBackground\n\nPressure-induced alopecia (PIA) was first described in 1959 by Abel and Lewis and it is an unusual cause of hair loss.\n\nIt has been reported after long periods of immobilization during surgeries or prolonged hospitalization in Intensive Care Units and it is caused by localized ischemia leading to vascular congestion, pathophysiology is similar to pressure ulcers.\n\nIt typically presents with a discrete patch of hair loss within 3-28 days after procedure.\n\nObservation\n\nWe report a case of PIA in a 38 year old male patient who had a nose job with total anesthesia. Total duration of the procedure was three hours.\n\nOne week after surgery a patch of alopecia was noticed on the occipital area. Patient reported a discrete paresthesia on the area right after surgery.\n\nTrichoscopy revealed black dots, broken and dystrophic hairs and discrete erythema, all findings were permeated by normal hair shafts. Spontaneous hair regrowth was observed at follow-up one month later.\n\nKey message\n\nTrichoscopy and histopathological features of PIA can overlap with those described for alopecia areata.\n\nEven though in all cases of PIA there is a clear history of surgery or prolonged immobilization preceding hair loss, the causality may not be promptly established by the patient or physician.\n\nBut once the relation with head immobilization is established, the diagnosis becomes obvious.\n\n7(6): 42.\n\nMIDLINE DENSITY PROFILE – TRICHOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF HAIRLINE AREA.

Kasprzak\n\n2 TrichoLAB, Poland\n\nFind articles by M. Kasprzak\n\n1 Background\n\nFrontal hairline has always been a beauty hallmark of a face. The architecture of hairline has not been thoroughly studied with trichoscopy. Two common hair diseases, androgenetic alopecia and frontal fibrosing alopecia, cause easily noticable hairline abnormalies.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nThe aim of our study was to schematically depict distribution of hairs of given thickness within a certain area by creating Midline Density Profile.\n\n3 Methods\n\nTrichoscopic examination was conducted on a linear area (1 cm × 7 cm), parallel to frontal medial line), starting 1 cm below hairline and moving upwards. Videodermoscope with a field of view of 6×18 mm was used and images were compounded „side to side” to form one image.\n\nImaging was performed in 15 patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia, 20 individuals with androgenetic alopecia (I, II and III Norwood Hamilton) and 30 healthy controls. Individuals with blond hair were not included to sustain optimal visibility.\n\nObtained images were analyzed: hair count and thickness of individual shafts were assessed.\n\n4 Results\n\nIn frontal fibrosing alopecia, the frontal hairline comprizes solely thick hairs with appearance of mid-thickness hairs in the middle and upper segments of studied area. Additionally, density within anterior aspect of frontal line was lower than in controls and absence of vellus hairs was noticed.\n\nIn androgenetic alopecia, total hair density is generally preserved, with increased percentage of vellus hairs and lower density of terminal hair. In healthy controls, a significant variability of Midline Density Profile with varied percentage of mid-thickness hairs.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nMidline Density Profile is a simple way to present normal and abnormal hairline in a quantitative fashion. Monitoring of frontal fibrosing alopecia as well as advanced planning of hair restoration may be improved with this approach.\n\n7(6): 43.\n\nSECONDARY SYPHILIS IN SCALP – REPORT OF CASE AND MAIN FINDINGS IN TRICHOSCOPY\n\n, 1 ,* , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 , 2\n\nAna Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Ana Cristina Schmidt Dorneles\n\nIsadora da Luz Silva\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Isadora da Luz Silva\n\nNatália Andressa Buss Venier\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Natália Andressa Buss Venier\n\nCamila Vargas Garcia\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Camila Vargas Garcia\n\nLeandro Damiani\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Leandro Damiani\n\nLaura Luzatto\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\nFind articles by Laura Luzatto\n\nRenan Minotto\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n2Coordinator and Prof of The hair and nail unit of the service\n\nFind articles by Renan Minotto\n\n1 Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Brasil\n\n2Coordinator and Prof of The hair and nail unit of the service\n\n1 Background\n\nA 38-year woman, 2 months ago with infiltrated, erithematous and itchy plaques on the scalp and with eyebrow and eyelash rarefaction. No other changes in clinical examination. On trichoscopy presented reddned areas, yellow dots, black dots, with rods sketching elbow shape and some repilation wires with pull test positive for anagen. Serologies were performed and treponemal and non-treponemal test were positive. The histopathology showed folicular miniaturization, perivascular and perifollicular lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate, with negative fungal research. The diagnosis of syphilitic alopecia was confirmed.\n\n2 Observation\n\nAlopecia may be an important sign to guide clinical diagnosis in relation to secondary syphilis. The Treponema pallidum has tropism by the proituberance epithelium capillary and peribulbar capillaries, the pathogenesis of syphilitic alopecia includes a peribulbar capillary vasculitis, which may cause perifollicular lymphocytic infiltration with dispersed plasma cells that disrupt the hair cycle. Thus, when syphilitic alopecia is the only manifestation of the disease, the differential diagnosis with other hair disorders may be more complex and therefore trichoscopy is so important and few publications describe the patterns of trichoscopy.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nWe describe this case of syphilitic alopecia with the findings of trichoscopy to aid in the diagnosis when alopecia is the only manifestation of the pathology.\n\n7(6): 44.\n\nTITLE -INEXPENSIVE MODIFIED CROSS-POLARIZED TECHNIQUE TO EVALUATE TRICHOGRAM.\n\n, 1 , 1 , 1 ,* , 1 , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nRachita Dhurat\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Rachita Dhurat\n\nSandip Agrawal\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Sandip Agrawal\n\nBurzin Daruwalla\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Burzin Daruwalla\n\nSanober Aseem Sharma\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Sanober Aseem Sharma\n\nRavina Surve\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Ravina Surve\n\nSmita Ghate\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Smita Ghate\n\nMithali Jage\n\n1-L.T.M.M.C and G.H SION\n\nFind articles by Mithali Jage\n\n1 Background\n\n-Polarized microscopy involves the placement of two disc in microscope such that vibrating light falls perpendicular to each other and hence does not allow light to pass through eyepiece which makes the background appear black. Only doubly refractile objects like hair, crystals, amyloid, foreign body etc will illuminate against black background. Hair shaft anomalies like trichothiodystrophy, trichorrhexis nodosa will be better visualized in polarized microscopy also melanin clump deposition in hair shaft can be noted. However polarized microscopy is expensive and not easily available.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nTo device an easy method of doing polarized microscopy with minimal resources.\n\n3 Methods\n\nWe have deviced a modified polarized microscope which requires minimal and easily available material. A trichogram slide is taken and a mirror is kept under the slide. The slide is then examined with a hand held or video-dermatoscope under polarization mode. Polarized light that is reflected by the mirror passes through the shaft of hair and the hair appear refractile. The hair shaft can be visualized more clearly and different findings like melanin deposition, tiger tail appearance etc can be better visualized.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nModified cross polarized microscope is indeed a very useful, cost effective, easy to use and beneficial method which will help in making diagnosis of hair shaft related disorders easier.\n\n7(6): 45.\n\nHAIRLOSS AS A MANIFESTATION OF MALIGNANCY\n\n, 1 , 2 ,* , 2 , 3 and 1\n\nJ.

There is scarce data in literature regarding trichoscopic findings in patients treated with this group of medications.\n\n2 Observation\n\nA 55-year-old Caucasian woman was referred due to extensive lesions on the scalp and skin rash, gradually increasing for two months. She has been treated with afatinib (EGFR inhibitor) for lung cancer (T4N2M0) for the last two years. Physical examination revealed pronounced erythema with extensive serous and purulent crusts tightly attached to the scalp, disseminated pustules and erosions with a predilection for the face, pubis and armpits and pyogenic granuloma-like lesions of the nailfolds. After removal of the crusts using detreomycin oil, scalp trichoscopy revealed numerous perifollicular pustules, tapering and distorted hair, single black dots, perifollicular scaling with perifollicular casts and extensive milky-red areas without hair follicles but with irregularly distributed pustules. Trichoscopy of the eyebrows showed several perifollicular pustules, perifollicular scaling and irregular pink areas.\n\n3 Key message\n\nEGFR inhibitors can lead to permanent hair loss and trichoscopy may help in early recognition of patients at risk of developing scarring alopecia. Further studies of trichoscopic findings are needed in order to better understand the course and prognosis of alopecia due to EGFR inhibitors.\n\n7(6): 47.\n\nLASH COMPARATIVE TRICHOSCOPY IN MONITORING LID MARGIN LESION GROWTH\n\n1 , 2 ,* and 1\n\nJ.

Mokni\n\n1 Background\n\nSarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that may involve various tissues and organs. It often includes cutaneous manifestations. Rarely, involvement of the scalp can occur, which might lead to cicatricial alopecia. We describe a case of sarcoidosis of the scalp and its trichoscopic features.\n\n2 Observation: A 40-year-old woman presented with a two-year history of patchy alopecia. Clinical examination showed erythematous, annular, infiltrated alopecic patch in the frontal area of the scalp. Dermoscopy of the plaque showed the absence of follicular ostia, orange round spots, telangiectasias and multiple dystrophic hairs. The patient had histopathological evidence of sarcoidosis.\n\n3 Key Message: Sarcoidal alopecia is rare, mainly described in African American women. Alopecia in scalp sarcoidosis is a result of the destruction of the hair follicles by the granulomatous formation and is often associated with a high incidence of systemic sarcoidosis. Dermoscopy shows orange spots corresponding to the round, well-formed granulomas in the superficial dermis. These spots differ from the yellow dots of alopecia areata as they are larger and do not correspond to follicular openings. Telangiectasias, as seen in our patient, correspond to vasodilatation in the papillary dermis. The presence of dystrophic hairs probably indicates the activity of the disease.\n\n7(6): 49.\n\nTHE RARE CASE OF BREAST CANCER METASTASIS LOCATED ON THE SCALP DIAGNOSED BY TRICHOSCOPY EXAMINATION.\n\n, MD, 1 , MD, PhD, 1 ,* , MD, 2 , MD, 1 , MD, 1 and , MD, PhD 1\n\nAgnieszka Szmurło\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Agnieszka Szmurło\n\nElżbieta Kowalska-Olędzka\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Elżbieta Kowalska-Olędzka\n\nŁukasz Grzęda\n\n2Magodent, Department of Clinical Oncology in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Łukasz Grzęda\n\nPiotr Ciechanowicz\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Piotr Ciechanowicz\n\nKlaudia Dopytalska\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Klaudia Dopytalska\n\nIrena Walecka-Herniczek\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\nFind articles by Irena Walecka-Herniczek\n\n1Department of Dermatology, CMKP/ Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA in Warsaw, Poland\n\n2Magodent, Department of Clinical Oncology in Warsaw, Poland\n\nBackground\n\nBreast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Cutaneous metastasis are uncommon and often mean advanced stage of cancer. We present a rare case of breast cancer metastasis located on the scalp which was diagnosed very quickly thanks to trichoscopy examination.\n\n2 Observation\n\nThe case study patient is a 61-year-old woman with a pale, painless node on the scalp, noticed 3 months ago. The patient had a history of a breast cancer 4 years ago, successfully treated with chemotherapy. Laboratory tests as well as lymph nodes' USG, mammography, abdominal USG and chest CT scan showed complete remission. The observed node was pale pink and had 7 mm in diameter. In trichoscopic examination the singular, irregular vessels on pale background were present. The following histopathological examination revealed the metastatic lobular carcinoma, later confirmed with the immunohistochemical technique, which shown CK 7(+in single cells), Ecadherin(−), estrogen receptors (100% cells), progesterone receptors(−). The malignant meninges infiltration was discovered in the CT scan and MRI examination.\n\n3. Key Message\n\nIn group of patients with oncology history every single abnormal skin lesion should be considered as a metastases even in the cases without any abnormalities in laboratory and imaging tests. Trichoscopy examination is helpful and can be used in diagnostic process although the final diagnosis is proven in the histopathology examination.\n\n7(6): 50.\n\nVASCULAR PATTERN- A NOVEL TRICHOSCOPY PARAMETER IN ALOPECIA NEOPLASTICA\n\n1 ,* and 1\n\nG.

Šafárik and University Hospital of Louis Pasteur, Košice, Slovakia\n\n1 Background\n\nScalp tumors are rare neoplasms accounting for 2% of all skin tumors.\n\nCutaneous metastasis from primary visceral malignancy is a relatively uncommon clinical entity, with a reported incidence of 0.22%–10% among various series. Alopecia neoplastica represents a rare form of cutaneous meatastasis, in which underlying cancer spreads to the scalp, while replacing normal adnexal structures and hair follicles. We present a case of scalp metastases where trichoscopy revealed novel characteristic features that can help a clinician in earlier diagnosis even the primary tumor has not been diagnosed yet.\n\n2 Observation\n\nThe current report presents a case of a 63-year-old female with advanced invasive ductal breast carcinoma (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive subtype) in her right breast from february 2010 who developed scalp metastasis during the period of systemic hormonal treatment. In january 2019 the patient noticed sympthomatic patchy hair loss initially presented as scalp dysesthesia or a painful sensation on the scalp. Clinically, the lesions (measured from 8 to 10 cm) were presented as indurated erythematous plaques with overlying teleangiectasias on the vertex and temporal scalp. Trichoscopy revealed an atypical vascular pattern and diffuse erythema, different from the already reported case. It suggests, than the scalp mestastasis from the same type of carcinoma, can be presented by different clinical and trichoscopic features. Peripheral black dots were not revealed. Higher magnification highlighted the already mentioned vascular pattern, with dilated, serpentine, and polymorphic vessels and absent follicular openings and epidermal atrophy. The clinical examination resembled the diagnosis of scarring alopecia, most likely pseudopelade of Brocq. The diagnosis of scarring alopecia is challenging because of overlapping features clinically and histopathologically. Atypical vascular pattern was however suspicious for neovascularization, which is not the pattern seen in pseudopelade of Brocq. Histologic examination of a punch biopsy revealed a carcinoma compatible with a mammary origin, so confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer.\n\n3 Key Message\n\nAlopecia neoplastica must be differentiated from several benign conditions, as cutaneous metastases often mimic other skin lesions. Trichoscopy represents a valuable, noninvasive technique for the evaluation of different types of alopecias. The diagnosis of alopecia neoplastica may be very challenging and in case of scarring localized alopecia, a differential diagnosis with metastasis should always be considered. Further consideration of the scalp lesions among patient with breast cancer is recommended and it is necessary to establish a full evaluation of any cutaneous lesion in patients with internal malignancies. Occurrence after years of follow-up is possible. Trichoscopy may provide quick and reliable diagnosis and obviate the necessity of scalp biopsy.\n\n7(6): 51.\n\nLICHEN PLANOPILARIS NON-POLARIZED DERMOSCOPY FEATURES\n\n, 1 , 1 , 1 and 1\n\nA.R Zhelonkin\n\n1Saint-Petersburg State University, Medical Faculty, Department of Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Dermatovenerology, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nFind articles by A.R Zhelonkin\n\nM.V Oganesian\n\n1Saint-Petersburg State University, Medical Faculty, Department of Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Dermatovenerology, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nFind articles by M.V Oganesian\n\nI.O Smirnova\n\n1Saint-Petersburg State University, Medical Faculty, Department of Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Dermatovenerology, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nFind articles by I.O Smirnova\n\nE.E Pakhomova\n\n1Saint-Petersburg State University, Medical Faculty, Department of Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Dermatovenerology, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nFind articles by E.E Pakhomova\n\n1Saint-Petersburg State University, Medical Faculty, Department of Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Dermatovenerology, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\n*A.R. Zhelonkin, ur.xednay@r.a.niknolehz\n\n1 Background\n\nLichen planopilaris (LPP) and frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) dermoscopy is described in detail. We assume that possible findings might depend on the dermoscope used.\n\n2 Aims and Objectives\n\nThe purpose of the study is to see whether handheld dermoscope findings align with publications where high magnification dermoscopes prevails.\n\n3 Methods\n\nFor examination of our patients we used non-polarised HEINE delta 20 dermoscope with a maximum magnification of 10x. A total of 18 patients with LPP and 5 patients with FFA were examined.\n\n4 Results\n\nThe most common signs in both LPP and FFA are white dots (18/18, 100%; 5/5, 100%) and the absence of hair follicles (18/18, 100%; 5/5, 100%). Other signs are perifollicular scaling (LPP − 9/18, 50%, FFA − 2/5, 40%); perifollicular brown pigmentation (LPP − 10/18, 58%; FFA − 3/5, 60%). Elongated linear vessels and concentrical peripheral vessels were found in 1/18 LPP(5%) and in 1/5 (20%) FFA patients.\n\nWe observed several dermoscopy features exclusively in LPP cases. For example perifollicular erythema (5/18, 29%) and yellow dots (5/18, 29%) were encounterd. In 2/18 LPP patients (11%) we found brown reticular pigmentation, purple zones, vellus hair, dystrophy of the hair shafts and broken hairs. Only 1 LPP patient had Wickham striae.\n\nHyperkeratotic plugs were observed in 1/5 (20%) FFA patients\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nWe conclude that the most common dermoscopy signs in LPP and FFA were white dots, lack of hair follicles, perifollicular scaling and brown pigmentation. Certain discrepancy with existing literature can be seen in the prevalence of observed signs, which can be the result of the dermoscope specificities or disease process. The subject needs further investigation\n\n7(6): 52.\n\nLICHEN PLANOPILARIS TRICHOSCOPY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 8 CASES\n\nBackground\n\nLichen planopilaris (LPP) is a common form of primary cicatriciel alopecia.
