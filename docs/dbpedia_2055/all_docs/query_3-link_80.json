        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Sh-Sl\n\nShaabi, Faysal (Abdul Latif) al-, also spelled Faysal (`Abd al-Latif) al-Sha`bi (b. 1935? - d. [shot while attempting to escape from a detention camp] April 1970), foreign minister (1969) and prime minister (1969) of South Yemen; brother-in-law of Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi. He was also minister of economy, commerce, and planning (1967-68).\n\nN.Q. al-Shaabi\n\nShaabi, Najeeb Qahtan al-, also spelled Najib Qahtan ash-Sha`bi (b. 1953, Sha`b village, Lahj, Western Aden Protectorate [now in Yemen] - d. May 24, 2021, Aden, Yemen), Yemeni presidential candidate (1999); son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi.\n\nShaabi, Qahtan Muhammad al-, al-Shaabi also spelled ash-Sha`bi (b. 1920, Lahj, Western Aden Protectorate [now in Yemen] - d. July 7, 1981), president of South Yemen (1967-69). While serving as an agricultural inspector, he defected with government funds in the late 1950s and joined the South Arabian League. In January 1963, he became the leader of the National Liberation Front (NLF) of South Yemen. The front, which initially had the backing of Egypt's president Gamal Abdel Nasser, had been created to oppose the establishment of a British-backed Federation of South Arabia. The NLF was responsible for many acts of violence, including grenade attacks on Aden in 1964. In January 1966 he was placed under house arrest in Cairo after a disagreement with Nasser over the unification of the NLF with Abdul-Qawi Makkawi's Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY), another nationalist group which had gained the backing of Nasser. Shaabi was released the following year. The British then began negotiations with the NLF, which had gained control of most of South Yemen. Shaabi headed the NLF delegation at the final negotiations in Geneva. Immediate independence was granted on Nov. 30, 1967, and Shaabi served as the first president of the People's Republic of South Yemen. His administration was beset by several leftist rebellions in its first year. He conducted a purge of the leftists on March 10, 1968, and reformed his cabinet the following month, removing Ali Salim al-Baidh as minister of defense. On April 6, 1969, he attempted a reconciliation with the leftists. In June he dismissed the popular interior minister, Muhammad Ali Haitham, after a quarrel during a cabinet meeting. Haitham, who had strong support in the Yemeni army, denounced Shaabi, who was subsequently deposed as president during a bloodless coup on June 22. He was replaced by a five-man Presidential Council which included Haitham. Shaabi was arrested, and in November he was expelled from the NLF. He was later released and lived in Aden in relative obscurity.\n\nShaali, Muhammad Hussein al- (b. 1950, Ajman, Trucial States [now United Arab Emirates]), United Arab Emirates diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1985-92) and ambassador to Canada (1986-87) and the United States (1992-99).\n\nShaath\n\nShaath, Nabil, Arabic Nabil Sha`th (b. 1938, Safed, Palestine [now in Israel]), foreign minister (2003-05) and acting prime minister (2005) of the Palestinian Authority. He was also minister of planning and international cooperation (1994-2003) and deputy prime minister and minister of information (2005).\n\nShabangu, Paul (Mshwepheletane) (b. 1943?), acting prime minister of Swaziland (2003).\n\nShabanov, Ivan (Mikhailovich) (b. Oct. 18, 1939, Nizhnyaya Baygora, Voronezh oblast, Russian S.F.S.R.), first secretary of the party committee (1990-91) and head of the administration (1996-2000) of Voronezh oblast.\n\nShabib, Talib (Hussein) (b. March 22, 1934, Hilla, Iraq - d. Oct. 12, 1997, London, England), foreign minister of Iraq (1963). He was ambassador to Turkey (1969-70) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1970-72) and served from 1974 as ambassador to West Germany. But he fell out with Saddam Hussein, then a vice president who later seized power in 1979. He resigned from the West German post in 1976 and went into exile and worked for the United Arab Emirates as a diplomatic adviser.

Dec. 12, 2006, Meadville, Pa.), governor of Pennsylvania (1967-71). A Republican, he was lieutenant governor in 1963-67. As governor, he led an overhaul of the state constitution, which had grown outdated, winning several changes from the Republican-controlled legislature and voters. Spending grew under his watch as the state government began giving more to education and public assistance. Many state taxes increased: the sales tax went from 5 to 6% in 1968, the highest in the nation at the time; the cigarette tax was raised; and numerous business taxes went up. Shafer's popularity sank in 1969 when he proposed a state income tax, an idea so disliked that he was hanged in effigy by 250 protesters in Boston, who said they were holding a \"second Boston Tea Party.\" In 1967 he called out the National Guard to try to halt a bitter strike by 15,000 steel-hauling truck drivers, later brokering a deal to end the strike. He also reluctantly signed legislation in 1970 making Pennsylvania the first state in the nation to permit its public employees to join unions and strike. By the time his term ended (he was the last of the state's governors limited to a single term), the state's finances were in shambles; it was estimated that the state was spending $2 million more per day than it brought in. In 1971 Pres. Richard Nixon appointed Shafer chairman of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Shafer Commission, as it was known, in 1972 recommended that state and federal governments decriminalize the personal use of marijuana but continue to declare it an illegal substance. Nixon rejected the report.\n\nShaffer, J(ohn) Wilson (b. July 5, 1827, Lewisburg, Pa. - d.

He was made federal minister of economic development (1959-60), pensions (1960-62), internal affairs (1962-65), and works (1965-66). After the 1966 military takeover he retired for a time. In 1970 he became federal commissioner for economic development, agriculture, and natural resources, with special responsibility for rehabilitating those parts of the country affected by the civil war. He was made federal commissioner for finance in 1971 and became a governor of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He retired again in 1975, but in 1978 he helped to form the National Party of Nigeria, which he led to victory in the 1979 elections. He was elected president, defeating his major rival, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, by a narrow margin. His inauguration marked an end of 13 years of military rule. A strong believer in consensus and compromise rather than confrontation politics, he tried to persuade the four opposition parties to join his party in a coalition government. He was reelected in August 1983, but disenchantment over high-level corruption and economic austerity measures clouded the future, and on December 31 he was ousted in a coup by military officers who accused him of turning Nigeria into a \"debtor and beggar.\" He was detained until July 1986 and then banned for life from holding public office or taking part in any political activities.\n\nShagdarsüren, Puntsagiyn (b. 1918), foreign minister of Mongolia (1958-63).

She won landmark legislative battles for health care reform, passing legislation to stabilize health insurance rates and eliminate discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions; to guarantee adequate hospital stays for women after childbirth; and to limit managed care organizations' practice of forcing health care providers into exclusive contracts that deny individuals access to their physician of choice. Shaheen was also one of the leaders in the fight to open up the electric utility industry to competition, in an effort to lower New Hampshire's highest-in-the-nation electric rates. Recognizing the importance of higher education and of research and development to the creation of good-paying jobs in New Hampshire, Shaheen was a strong supporter of the state university and community-technical college system, and fought to create the first state-sponsored industrial research centre.

He organized a permanent army of some 40,000, conquered the Nguni peoples of modern KwaZulu-Natal, exterminating many smaller clans, and built up a centralized, militaristic Zulu kingdom. Marauding clans fleeing the Zulu in turn brought about the mfecane (\"crushing\") that devastated the inland plateau in the early 1820s and thereby allowed the Great Trek of the Boers to succeed in the 1830s. He became increasingly autocratic, to the point of insanity after the death (1827) of his mother Nandi, leading to the slaughter of thousands.

Serving until the end of the Clinton administration, she was the longest-serving health secretary in U.S. history. In 2001-15 she was president of the University of Miami.

He became known for his efforts at economic revitalization as well as for his headstrong personality. He was himself dismissed on corruption charges in April 1993. In the October 1993 elections Bhutto regained power, but she was ousted again in November 1996. It was Sharif's turn as prime minister again when his PML won a landslide victory in the elections of Feb. 3, 1997. He soon set out to trim the powers of the president and the military. His attempt to block the appointment of five additional judges to the Supreme Court late in the year sparked a constitutional crisis. After Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, one of Sharif's rivals, was suspended from the court on a technicality, Pres. Farooq Ahmed Leghari, rather than appointing a replacement, resigned from his post, bitterly accusing Sharif of attempting to grab sole power. In May 1998, despite international condemnation, Sharif responded to India's testings of nuclear weapons by sanctioning Pakistan's first-ever tests. In October 1999 he was overthrown in a coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf. In April 2000 he was given a life sentence in jail on two charges of hijacking and terrorism; the prosecution said that on the day of the coup Sharif attempted to prevent an aircraft carrying Musharraf from landing when it was running short of fuel. In December 2000 he was taken from prison and exiled to Saudi Arabia. The Supreme Court ruled in August 2007 that he had a right to return, but when he did so in September he was immediately deported again. He returned successfully in November. In February 2009 the Supreme Court disqualified him from public office because of his 2000 conviction, but the ruling was \"set aside\" in May. In 2013 his party again won elections and he became prime minister once more. Following the 2016 \"Panama Papers\" leak, in April 2017 the Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that there was insufficient evidence to remove him from office but ordered an investigation into offshore wealth held by his family; as a result, the court removed him in July 2017. In July 2018 he was sentenced to 10 years and in December to 7 years in prison on separate corruption charges.\n\nS. Sharif\n\nSharif, (Mian) Shahbaz, also spelled Shehbaz (b. Sept. 23, 1951, Lahore, Pakistan), chief minister of Punjab (1997-99, 2008-09, 2009-13, 2013-18) and prime minister of Pakistan (2022-23, 2024- ). He replaced his brother Nawaz Sharif as president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on Aug. 3, 2002, but continued to live with the Sharif family in Saudi Arabia. In May 2004 he made an attempt to return to Pakistan, but after landing at Lahore airport he was deported back to Saudi Arabia. He returned with his brother in November 2007. In June 2008 he returned to head a coalition government in Punjab, with the Pakistan People's Party as the junior partner - a reversal of the roles played by the two parties in the federal government. A February 2009 Supreme Court decision disqualified and unseated him as chief minister, but another ruling by the court in March restored him.\n\nSharif-Emami\n\nSharif-Emami, Jaafar (b. Sept. 8, 1910, Tehran, Iran - d. June 16, 1998, New York City), prime minister (1960-61, 1978) and foreign minister (1960-61) of Iran. A close confidant of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, he became minister of roads and communications (1950-51) and industries and mines (1957-60). During his first term as prime minister, he attempted to institute economic reforms, but his unpopularity led to his replacement after 8 months. He was president of the Senate in 1963-78. During his second term as prime minister, he tried to quell growing civil unrest and mollify the increasingly powerful Islamic fundamentalists, but the situation continued to deteriorate and he resigned (November 1978) after some 3 months in office. After the shah's downfall in early 1979, Sharif-Emami fled to New York.\n\nSharipov, Ady (Sharipovich) (b. Dec. 19, 1912, Marinovka, Russia [now in Vostochno-Kazakhstan oblast, Kazakhstan] - d.

Around 1940 he became actively involved in India's freedom struggle. For his role in the independence movement in Bhopal, he was imprisoned for eight months. After India gained independence (1947), his political career developed through a long association with the Indian National Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family in particular. He was a member of the All-India Congress Committee for 32 years beginning in 1950, and in 1950-52 he was president of the Bhopal State Congress Committee. He also served as chief minister of Bhopal (1952-56). He was a member of the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly in 1956-71, and during that period he held a cabinet post for some 11 years.

Jan. 11, 2014, Ramat Gan, Israel), prime minister of Israel (2001-06). He received military training early in life and took his new name when Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion insisted that all Israeli officers have Hebrew names. In the wars of 1956 and 1967, he both times captured the strategic Mitla pass in the Sinai Peninsula. Resigning from the army in July 1973, he was recalled for the October 1973 Yom Kippur war. That same year he was instrumental in the formation of the Likud party and became a member of the Knesset (parliament). He joined the government in 1977 as minister of agriculture in charge of settlements and remained in that post until becoming defense minister in 1981. In 1982 he was the chief architect of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The revelation that Israeli-allied Christian Lebanese militiamen had massacred Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatila caused worldwide condemnation. In response, Israel set up a judicial commission which found him indirectly responsible. He resigned as defense minister in 1983, but became minister of industry and trade (1984-90) and of construction and housing (1990-92). In 1996 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created for Sharon the cabinet post of minister of national infrastructure. In 1998 he became foreign minister. He succeeded Netanyahu as Likud leader in 1999 and in 2001 defeated Ehud Barak in prime ministerial elections. He also held the portfolios of immigrant absorption (2001-03), health (2002), labour and social welfare (2002), interior (2002, 2004-05, 2005-06), industry and trade (2002-03), transport (2002-03), communications (2003), and religious affairs (2003). In 2005, after having withdrawn Israeli settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip, which was controversial within Likud, he founded the Kadima party. In 2006 a stroke left him in a coma; after 100 days he was considered permanently incapacitated, officially losing the position of prime minister.\n\nSharp\n\nSharp, Mitchell (William) (b.

He held various posts in the Trade Department, but left the civil service in 1958 shortly after the Conservatives swept to power under John Diefenbaker. Sharp's political career began soon afterward when Lester Pearson asked him to help create the Liberal Party's election platform in the early 1960s. He represented Toronto's Eglinton riding in the House of Commons from 1963 to 1978. He was one of the most outspoken foreign affairs ministers in Canadian history; during his tenure, the government established relations with China, shifted its policies regarding the United States, halved its military commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and began new dialogues with Europe and Japan. He left politics for an appointment as commissioner for the Northern Pipeline Agency and also served (1984) as co-chairman of a task force on conflict of interest, which published a report on ethical conduct in the public service. He was a deputy chairman of the Trilateral Commission, a private global policy discussion group, from 1976 to 1986. Later, at the age of 82, he signed on as a $1-a-year personal adviser to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien - and kept at it into his 90s.\n\nA. Sharpe\n\nSharpe, Sir Alfred (b. May 19, 1853, Lancaster, Lancashire, England - d. Dec. 10, 1935, London, England), British colonial administrator. He resolved to go to Africa to shoot elephant and trade in ivory. Arriving in the Shire Highlands, south of Lake Nyasa, in 1887, he immediately became involved in a struggle with \"Arab\" slave traders. In 1889 H.H. Johnston came out to Nyasaland (now Malawi) with commissions from the British government and Cecil Rhodes. The British settlements were now threatened not only by the slavers but by the designs of other colonial powers. To Sharpe fell the task of winning the natives west of Nyasa to the British side, and he brought a large part of what became Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) into treaty relations with the Chartered Company and almost succeeded in adding Katanga (now in Congo [Kinshasa]) to the British sphere. Long struggles with turbulent tribes followed, but finally peace was established, Sharpe being one of the principal instruments in the extinction of the slave trade in that part of Central Africa. During 1889-95 he also explored and mapped Lake Mweru (in Zambia), the northern parts of Zambia, and Katanga. He was appointed vice-consul of Nyasaland protectorate in 1891, commissioner in 1896, and governor in 1908. He retired from the colonial service in 1910. In 1919 he explored the interior of Liberia.

He earned the title Shastri (\"scholar\") in 1926 and it became part of his name. He joined Mohandas Gandhi's Non-cooperation Movement against British rule in India and was imprisoned for a short time in 1921 and several times later. He attained influential positions in the Congress Party of the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh) and was elected to the legislature of the United Provinces in 1937 and again in 1946. After independence, he became minister for home affairs and transport in Uttar Pradesh, then in 1952 he was elected to the Indian legislature and became union minister for railways and transport. He resigned in 1956 because he felt that he was constitutionally responsible for a serious railway accident, but returned to the cabinet in 1957, first as minister of transport and communications, then (1958) of commerce and industry. He was appointed to the influential post of minister for home affairs in 1961, but resigned in 1963 under a plan whereby ministers should voluntarily leave office to devote themselves to the reform of the Congress Party. In January 1964, on Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's illness, he was recalled to the cabinet as minister without portfolio, and after Nehru's death he became prime minister in June. Rising prices, food shortages, and other disappointments at home lowered his reputation temporarily, but his firmness on the outbreak of hostilities with neighbouring Pakistan in 1965 restored his popularity. He died of a heart attack hours after signing an agreement with Pres. Mohammad Ayub Khan of Pakistan to seek a peaceful solution to the Kashmir dispute.\n\nV.K.

Then in April 2002 he became president of Southwestern Somalia, a newly-proclaimed state with Baidoa as capital. The city changed hands numerous times between July and December 2002. Shatigadud was opposed to the troops loyal to the faction of his former deputies (and then vice-chairmen of the RRA) Sheikh Aden Madobe and Mohamed Ibrahim Habsade who took control of the city.

He escaped to Albania in 1942 and joined a partisan unit supported by Tito. After World War II he went to the Voroshilov Military Academy in Moscow and in 1946 was appointed chief of staff of the Albanian Army. A member of the Albanian (Communist) Party of Labour Politburo from 1948, he was party leader Enver Hoxha's trusted aide.

He was a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house) in 1962-77 and of the Lok Sabha (lower house) in 1977-84 and 1989-2007. He fell out with Congress Party leader Indira Gandhi in 1975 and was jailed for 21 months during the national emergency declared by her. In 1977 he was one of the founders of the Janata Party which defeated Gandhi, but the prime minister's post went to Morarji Desai, while Shekhar became party president. He undertook a cross-country marathon walk from Kanyakumari to Delhi in 1983 to highlight the problems of rural India and establish a rapport with the masses. In 1988 the Janata Party merged with several other opposition parties to form the Janata Dal under the leadership of V.P. Singh, who became prime minister in 1989. Shekhar broke with Janata Dal on Nov. 5, 1990, and formed the Janata Dal-Socialist faction (later renamed the Samajwadi Janata Party). Backed by Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) party, he replaced Singh as prime minister on November 10 to head a weak minority government in which he also held the defense, home, and several other portfolios. After Congress (I) withdrew its support he resigned on March 6, 1991, remaining in office as a caretaker until new elections were held in May and June, in which his Samajwadi Janata Party won only 5 seats.\n\nShekhawat\n\nShekhawat, Bhairon Singh (b.

Oct. 24, 1994, Moscow, Russia), Soviet government official. He served with the Red Army during the war with Finland (1939-40). In 1940 he joined the Communist Party. As first secretary of the Komsomol's central committee in 1952-58, he directed the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of youths for Nikita Khrushchev's Virgin Lands Program for the economic development of Central Asia. Long regarded as an ally of Khrushchev, Shelepin became a member of the party's Central Committee in 1957 and was chairman of the Committee for State Security (KGB) in 1958-61. As he was not originally from the security branches, his appointment was seen as an attempt by Khrushchev to bring the police apparatus more firmly under party control. He is thought to have ordered the assassination of Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera in Germany in 1959. In 1962 he was appointed chairman of the new Committee of Party and State Control, a powerful agency that supervised the economy and local administration. It was speculated that he played a major role in Khrushchev's ouster in 1964. Later that year he joined the party Presidium (later called Politburo). But he was apparently seen as a rival by the new party leader Leonid Brezhnev and was gradually removed from the political scene. His control committee was dissolved in 1965; he subsequently headed the national trade union organization, but after a 1975 trip to Britain in this capacity, which provoked huge protest demonstrations because of his KGB background, he was dropped from the Politburo and lost the trade union post. He was not reelected to the Central Committee at the 25th party congress in 1976.\n\nShelest, Pyotr (Yefimovich), Ukrainian Petro (Yukhymovych) Shelest (b.

He joined the Communist Party in 1928 and rose through different party and administrative jobs, including first secretary of the party committee of Kiev oblast (1957-62), to become the Ukrainian Communist chief. In 1964, he also joined the Soviet Communist Party's Presidium, later renamed to Politburo. His policies promoting the use of the Ukrainian language over Russian and defending Ukrainian culture allowed him to preside over a brief cultural renaissance. In 1972, the Soviet leadership ousted him for encouraging Ukrainian nationalism and ordered a crackdown on Ukrainian intellectuals. After his removal, he served as Soviet deputy prime minister for one year, but owing to poor relations with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, he was dismissed, lost his Politburo seat, and was appointed director of a military enterprise outside Moscow, where he remained until his retirement.\n\nShelley, Malcolm Bond (b.
