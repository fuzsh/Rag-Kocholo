The history of the last name Domingues

The surname Domingues originates from Portugal and Spain, derived from the personal name Domingo, which itself comes from the Latin "Dies Dominicus" meaning "Lord's Day" or Sunday. The name emerged during the Middle Ages, likely as a way to identify individuals born or baptized on a Sunday.

In Portugal, the earliest recorded instances of the Domingues surname can be traced back to the 13th century. One notable bearer was Domingos Domingues, a 14th-century Portuguese poet and troubadour known for his contributions to the development of courtly love poetry.

The surname also has a long history in Spain, where it was often spelled as "Domínguez." One of the earliest recorded instances is Domingo Domínguez, a 13th-century Spanish nobleman and military leader who played a pivotal role in the Reconquista, the centuries-long campaign to reclaim the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish rule.

In the 16th century, the Portuguese explorer and navigator Francisco Domingues made significant contributions to the expansion of Portugal's maritime empire. He led expeditions to India and the Far East, establishing trade routes and fortified outposts along the way.

Another notable figure was Gaspar Domingues, a 17th-century Portuguese painter and architect who helped shape the Baroque style in his native country. His works can be found adorning churches and palaces throughout Portugal.

In the 19th century, José Domingues dos Santos, a Brazilian abolitionist and journalist, played a crucial role in the fight against slavery in Brazil. His writings and activism helped raise awareness of the inhumane conditions endured by enslaved people and contributed to the eventual abolition of slavery in 1888.
