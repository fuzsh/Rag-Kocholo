        "text": "Kristine Marie Amorose unexpectedly passed away on May 2, 2024, at St. Mary’s Hospital, Madison, WI. Kristine was the second oldest child and daughter of Joanne (Eddy) Amorose (deceased) and John Amorose Sr. (deceased). She was born in Joliet, Illinois on October 20, 1963.\n\nKristine graduated from Argyle High School in 1981. She was very active in band (Flute, Piccolo) and competed at many schools’ solo ensembles. One solo ensemble in particular that Kristine (and her dad) were proud of was when she won the highest honor in high school band, the John Philip Sousa Award, which recognizes superior musicianship and outstanding dedication. She was so proud of this achievement and told everyone who would listen.\n\nAfter graduation Kristine attended Edgewood College in Madison, WI. She would eventually receive her CNA license and pursue a career in nursing. Kristine worked at the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Monroe from 1980 to 1994, she loved what she did and made many long-lasting friends while working there. As time passed and new opportunities arose, Kristine would start to work at MiTek, assembling speakers in Monroe with her sister Tracey, eventually becoming assistant line leader before the company closed its doors. Following her passion of cooking, she took the position of Head Chef at the Yellowstone Golf Course in Argyle/Blanchardville. She prided herself in the food that she would cook, and it was very much noticed by all who enjoyed a meal prepared by her. From there, Kristine would move on to the Klondike Cheese Company in Monroe. She worked in the Feta cheese pack lines cutting and weighing Feta cheese into buckets for customers. She once again took pride in her job and spoke highly of the cheese products and company. She worked at Klondike for about 8 years, until she retired due to complications with her Rheumatoid arthritis.

Probably one of the biggest Bears fans second to her father, Kristine cheered, cried, and prayed for Chicago football. Always looking her best (full makeup and jewelry) and dressed in her Bears gear she would sit in “her chair” and sing “Chicago Bears, we’re on our way to victory” and when we were down and out, she’d pray to Walter Payton! BEAR DOWN KRISTINE!! (get the pillow to squeeze lol) (get in the kitchen Kristine)\n\nKristine enjoyed cooking and baking and shared many delicious dishes and recipes with family and friends. She loved having family and friends come over to grill or make food and have drinks on the “veranda” during the summer. There were many summers where you could drive past her house and see her sitting in the sun enjoying a drink and maybe a book. And if you couldn’t find her on the veranda, she was out and about ready to socialize and have a good time. She was always up for a party!\n\nWith a natural green thumb, she had many plants inside and out. She kept hydrangeas, fuchsias, Christmas cactuses and hibiscuses. One plant in particular she loved and tended to which she called “Beauty”, a pink geranium that was very large and lush. Kristine had acquired an orchid from her late mother and continued to collect many afterward(+5). Every time her orchids flowered, she shared her jubilation with family and friends or on social media. She was excited the year the rose bush at her dads house finally flourished and she could see the elegance of the flower.\n\nShe loved music, you could often hear her listening to Rick Springfield, Simon & Garfunkel, The Damn Yankees, Def Leppard, The Outfield, Garth Brooks, and Bob Seger. There wasn’t a day she didn’t have her own personal soundtrack playing in the background. Her specific tastes of music were passed down to siblings and eventually her sons.\n\nKristine’s main purpose and what lit her life up the most were having her two boys, Christopher and Matthew. She loved being a mother and she would do anything for her boys. She raised them from babies to fine young gentlemen. She was so proud of both of them. She loved seeing them excel in life, whether it be through jobs or raising a family.\n\nKristine also shared a special bond with her brother John, having been born 13 months from each other, she referred to them as Irish twins. Kristine would exclaim love and joy telling everyone that she and John were Irish twins.\n\nKristine’s family has many memories of her, and we will keep her in our hearts. Her family affectionately called her Teeny Weeny, and we will miss you Teeny. Look into my eyes! Teeny Weeny I love you!\n\nKristine is survived by her sons Christopher Severson (Peanut & Zara) of Orange, CA, and Matthew (Tara) Amorose of Argyle, brother John Amorose Jr. of Eagle River, sister Tracey Amorose-Kamps of Argyle, brother Jeff (Alison) Amorose of Fredericksburg VA, and brother Sean (Tara Wire) Amorose of Argyle. Nephews Nicholas Amorose of Eagle River, Zachory Amorose of Monroe, Jacob Amorose of Philadelphia PA, and Samuel Amorose of Fredericksburg VA, Niece Caitlynn Kamps of Madison and her grandchildren Vera Rae and Kane John Amorose of Argyle.\n\nKristine is preceded in death by her father John “Jack” Amorose Sr., sister Kathryn “Katy” (Amorose) Hess, mother Joanne (Eddy) Amorose, maternal grandparents Maurice and Anne (Teodorowicz) Eddy, sister Karen Amorose, and paternal grandparents Angelo and Madelyn (Urbanec) Amorose. As well as her dear friend, Jennifer Heiser York, may you finally be reunited.\n\nA Fallen Limb\n\nA limb has fallen from the family tree. I keep hearing a voice that says, “Grieve not for me”. Remember the best times, the laughter, the song. The good life I lived while I was strong. Continue my heritage, I’m counting on you. Keep smiling and surely the sun will shine through. My mind is at ease, my soul is at rest.\n\nRemembering all, how I truly was blessed. Continue traditions, no matter how small. Go on with your life, don’t worry about falls. I miss you all dearly, so keep up your chin. Until the day comes we’re together again.” – Author Unknown\n\nA Celebration of Kristine’s Life will be held at a later date.\n\nShriner Hager Gohlke Funeral Home is assisting the family.
