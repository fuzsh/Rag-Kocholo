Recent developments in plant molecular signaling and crosstalk between nutritional, hormonal and environmental stress cues are however revealing a more complex picture of inclusive toxicity. Herbicides induce large-scale metabolic and gene-expression effects that go far beyond the expected consequences of unilinear herbicide-target-damage mechanisms. Moreover, groundbreaking studies have revealed that herbicide action and responses strongly interact with hormone signaling pathways, with numerous regulatory protein-kinases and -phosphatases, with metabolic and circadian clock regulators and with oxidative stress signaling pathways. These interactions are likely to result in mechanisms of adjustment that can determine the level of sensitivity or tolerance to a given herbicide or to a mixture of herbicides depending on the environmental and developmental status of the plant. Such regulations can be described as rheostatic and their importance is discussed in relation with herbicide use strategies, environmental risk assessment and global change assessment challenges.

Many teachers changed their methods of assessment from paper-and-pencil (P&P) to online systems. In this study we analyse the influence that using an online system for knowledge assessment has on students' knowledge. Based on both a literature study and our own research we designed and built an online system for knowledge assessment. The system is evaluated using two groups of primary school teachers and students (N = 686) in Slovenia: an experimental and a control group. Students solved P&P exams on several occasions. The experimental group was allowed to access the system either at school or at home for a limited period during the presentation of a selected school topic. Students in the experimental group were able to solve tasks and compare their own achievements with those of their coevals. A comparison of the P&P school exams results achieved by both groups revealed a positive effect on subject topic comprehension for those with access to the online self-assessment system.\n\nICT-Based Dynamic Assessment to Reveal Special Education Students' Potential in Mathematics\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPeltenburg, Marjolijn; van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, Marja; Robitzsch, Alexander\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper reports on a research project on information and communication technology (ICT)-based dynamic assessment. The project aims to reveal the mathematical potential of students in special education. The focus is on a topic that is generally recognised as rather difficult for weak students: subtraction up to 100 with crossing the ten.

The Medical Experiment reported on in this paper was part of the complex payload consisting of 11 different experiments. Its general purpose was to develop a technology, possibly flown on board of Spacelab, and enabling the assessment of workload through evaluating changes of circadian rhythmicity, sleep disturbances and episodical or cumulative stress. As parameters the following variables were measured: Rectal temperature, ECG, sleep-EEG and -EOG, the urinary excretion of hormones and electrolytes. The results revealed evidence that a Spacelab environment, as simulated in ASSESS II, will lead to internal dissociation of circadian rhythms, to sleep disturbances and to highly stressful working conditions. Altogether these effects will impose considerable workload upon Payload Specialists. It is suggested that an intensive pre-mission system simulation will reduce these impairments to a reasonable degree. The bioinstrumentation applied in this experiment proved to be a practical and reliable tool in assessing the objectives of the study.\n\nSpatial Thinking Ability Assessment in Rwandan Secondary Schools: Baseline Results\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTomaszewski, Brian; Vodacek, Anthony; Parody, Robert; Holt, Nicholas\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article discusses use and modification of Lee and Bednarz's (2012) Spatial Thinking Ability Test (STAT) as a spatial thinking assessment device in Rwandan secondary schools.

A national training program for general practitioners (GPs) was launched by the Ministry of Health in 2003. GPs were encouraged to collect data on risk factors and risk assessment and to contribute to the CUORE Project Cardiovascular Risk Observatory (CRO). The aim of this analysis is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of risk assessment in primary care. The cuore.exe software, free of charge for GPs and easily downloadable from the CUORE Project web site (www.cuore.iss.it), is the frame for the GP data collection. The CRO provides a platform to analyze data collected on risk assessment and risk factors, and compare results at regional and national level in order to support health policy makers in their decision process. From January 2007 to April 2009, 2858 GPs have downloaded the cuore.exe software; 102,113 risk assessments were sent to the CRO based on risk factors profile of 87,556 persons (3617 persons had more than 1 risk assessment). Mean level of CR was 3.1% in women and 8.4% in men; 30% of men and 65% of women were at low risk (CR < 3%), 9% of men and 0.4% of women were found at high risk (CR > or = 20%). Among those with at least 2 risk assessments, 8% shifted to a lower class of risk after 1 year. Mean level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by about 1% in 1 year; total cholesterol more than 2%, and prevalence of smokers decreased by about 3% in the second risk assessment. These data demonstrate that risk assessment can be included as a first step of prevention in primary care. The CUORE Project individual score is expected to become an important tool for GPs to assess their patients' CR, to promote primary prevention, and to focus attention to healthy lifestyle adoption.\n\n40 CFR 194.34 - Results of performance assessments.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n... 40 Protection of Environment 26 2013-07-01 2013-07-01 false Results of performance assessments. 194.34 Section 194.34 Protection of Environment ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (CONTINUED) RADIATION...

Another important element of the Save Energy Now assessment process is the follow-up process used to identify how many of the recommended savings opportunities from individual assessments have been implemented in the industrial plants. Plant personnel involved with the Save Energy Now assessments are contacted 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after individual assessments are completed to determine implementation results. A total of 260 Save Energy Now assessments were successfully completed in calendar year 2008. This means that a total of 718 assessments were completed in 2006, 2007, and 2008. As of July 2009, we have received a total of 239 summary reports from the ESAs that were conducted in year 2008. Hence, at the time that this report was prepared, 680 final assessment reports were completed (200 from year 2006, 241 from year 2007, and 239 from year 2008). The total identified potential cost savings from these 680 assessments ismoreÂ Â» $$1.1 billion per year, including natural gas savings of about 98 TBtu per year. These results, if fully implemented, could reduce CO{sub 2} emissions by about 8.9 million metric tons annually. When this report was prepared, data on implementation of recommended energy and cost savings measures from 488 Save Energy Now assessments were available. For these 488 plants, measures saving a total of $$147 million per year have been implemented, measures that will save $169 million per year are in the process of being implemented, and plants are planning implementation of measures that will save another $239 million per year.

Assessing such spatial overlap patterns of functional networks (SOPFNs) based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has thus received increasing interest for brain function studies. However, there are still two crucial issues to be addressed. First, the SOPFNs are assessed over the entire fMRI scan assuming the temporal stationarity, while possibly time-dependent dynamics of the SOPFNs is not sufficiently explored. Second, the SOPFNs are assessed within individual subjects, while group-wise consistency of the SOPFNs is largely unknown. To address the two issues, we propose a novel computational framework of group-wise sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI temporal segments to assess the temporal dynamic spatial patterns of SOPFNs that are consistent across different subjects. Experimental results based on the recently publicly released Human Connectome Project grayordinate task fMRI data demonstrate that meaningful SOPFNs exhibiting dynamic spatial patterns across different time periods are effectively and robustly identified based on the reconstructed concurrent functional networks via the proposed framework. Specifically, those SOPFNs locate significantly more on gyral regions than on sulcal regions across different time periods. These results reveal novel functional architecture of cortical gyri and sulci. Moreover, these results help better understand functional dynamics mechanisms of cerebral cortex in the future.\n\nRevealing and acknowledging value judgments in health technology assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nHofmann, BjÃ¸rn; Cleemput, Irina; Bond, Kenneth; Krones, Tanja; Droste, Sigrid; Sacchini, Dario; Oortwijn, Wija\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAlthough value issues are increasingly addressed in health technology assessment (HTA) reports, HTA is still seen as a scientific endeavor and sometimes contrasted with value judgments, which are considered arbitrary and unscientific. This article aims at illustrating how numerous value judgments are at play in the HTA process, and why it is important to acknowledge and address value judgments. A panel of experts involved in HTA, including ethicists, scrutinized the HTA process with regard to implicit value judgments. It was analyzed whether these value judgments undermine the accountability of HTA results. The final results were obtained after several rounds of deliberation. Value judgments are identified before the assessment when identifying and selecting health technologies to assess, and as part of assessment. They are at play in the processes of deciding on how to select, frame, present, summarize or synthesize information in systematic reviews. Also, in economic analysis, value judgments are ubiquitous. Addressing the ethical, legal, and social issues of a given health technology involves moral, legal, and social value judgments by definition. So do the appraisal and the decision-making process. HTA by and large is a process of value judgments. However, the preponderance of value judgments does not render HTA biased or flawed. On the contrary they are basic elements of the HTA process. Acknowledging and explicitly addressing value judgments may improve the accountability of HTA.\n\nCommunicating Performance Assessments Results - 13609\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLayton, Mark\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThe F-Area Tank Farms (FTF) and H-Area Tank Farm (HTF) are owned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and operated by Savannah River Remediation LLC (SRR), Liquid Waste Operations contractor at DOE's Savannah River Site (SRS). The FTF and HTF are active radioactive waste storage and treatment facilities consisting of 51 carbon steel waste tanks and ancillary equipment such as transfer lines, evaporators and pump tanks. Performance Assessments (PAs) for each Tank Farm have been prepared to support the eventual closure of the underground radioactive waste tanks and ancillary equipment. PAs provide the technical bases and results to bemoreÂ Â» used in subsequent documents to demonstrate compliance with the pertinent requirements for final closure of the Tank Farms. The Tank Farms are subject to a number of regulatory requirements. The State regulates Tank Farm operations through an industrial waste water permit and through a Federal Facility Agreement approved by the State, DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Closure documentation will include State-approved Tank Farm Closure Plans and tank-specific closure modules utilizing information from the PAs. For this reason, the State of South Carolina and the EPA must be involved in the performance assessment review process. The residual material remaining after tank cleaning is also subject to reclassification prior to closure via a waste determination pursuant to Section 3116 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2005. PAs are performance-based, risk-informed analyses of the fate and transport of FTF and HTF residual wastes following final closure of the Tank Farms. Since the PAs serve as the primary risk assessment tools in evaluating readiness for closure, it is vital that PA conclusions be communicated effectively. In the course of developing the FTF and HTF PAs, several lessons learned have emerged regarding communicating PA results. When communicating PA results it\n\nAssessing and Understanding Trail Degradation: Results from Big South Fork National River and Recreational Area\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMarion, J.L.; Olive, N.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis report describes results from a comprehensive assessment of resource conditions on a large (24%) sample of the trail system within Big South Fork National River and Recreational Area (BSF). Components include research to develop state-of-knowledge trail impact assessment and monitoring methods, application of survey methods to BSF trails, analysis and summary of results, and recommendations for trail management decision making and future monitoring. Findings reveal a trail system with some substantial degradation, particularly soil erosion, which additionally threatens water quality in areas adjacent to streams and rivers. Factors that contribute to or influence these problems are analyzed and described. Principal among these are trail design factors (trail topographic position, soil texture, grade and slope alignment angle), use-related factors (type and amount of use), and maintenance factors (water drainage). Recommendations are offered to assist managers in improving the sustainability of the trails system to accommodate visitation while enhancing natural resource protection.\n\nResults from the Fourth Mathematics Assessment of the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLindquist, Mary Montgomery, Ed.\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) completed its fourth mathematics assessment during the 1985-86 school year and finished the analyses of the results in 1988.

Occupational exposure assessment reveals RF harmonics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGourzoulidis, G.; Karabetsos, E.; Skamnakis, N.; Kappas, C.; Theodorou, K.; Tsougos, I.; Maris, T. G.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems played a crucial role in the postponement of the former occupational electromagnetic fields (EMF) European Directive (2004/40/EC) and in the formation of the latest exposure limits adopted in the new one (2013/35/EU). Moreover, the complex MRI environment will be finally excluded from the implementation of the new occupational limits, leading to an increased demand for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) surveillance. The gradient function of MRI systems and the application of the RF excitation frequency result in low and high frequency exposures, respectively. This electromagnetic field exposure, in combination with the increased static magnetic field exposure, makes the MRI environment a unique case of combined EMF exposure. The electromagnetic field levels in close proximity of different MRI systems have been assessed at various frequencies. Quality Assurance (QA) & safety issues were also faced. Preliminary results show initial compliance with the forthcoming limits in each different frequency band, but also revealed peculiar RF harmonic components, of no safety concern, to the whole range detected (20-1000MHz). Further work is needed in order to clarify their origin and characteristics.\n\n[Assessment of invalidity as aÂ result of infectious diseases].\n\nPubMed\n\nÄeledovÃ¡, L; Äevela, R; BosÃ¡k, M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe article features the new medical assessment paradigm for invalidity as a result of infectious disease which is applied as of 1 January 2010. The invalidity assessment criteria are regulated specifically by Regulation No. 359/2009. Chapter I of the Annexe to the invalidity assessment regulation addresses the area of infectious diseases with respect to functional impairment and its impact on the quality of life. Since 2010, the invalidity has also been newly categorized into three groups. The new assessment approach makes it possible to evaluate a persons functional capacity, type of disability, and eligibility for compensation for reduced capacity for work. In 2010, a total of 170 375 invalidity cases were assessed, and in 2014, 147 121 invalidity assessments were made. Invalidity as a result of infectious disease was assessed in 177 persons in 2010, and 128 invalidity assessments were made in 2014. The most common causes of invalidity as a result of infectious disease are chronic viral hepatitis, other spirochetal infections, tuberculosis of the respiratory tract, tick-borne viral encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS. The number of assessments of invalidity as a result of infectious disease showed a declining trend between 2010 and 2014, similarly to the total of invalidity assessments. In spite of this fact, the cases of invalidity as a result of infectious disease account for approximately half percent of all invalidity assessments made in the above-mentioned period of time.\n\nResults of rapid needs assessments in rural and urban Iowa following large-scale flooding events in 2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuinlisk, Patricia; Jones, Mary J; Bostick, Nathan A; Walsh, Lauren E; Curtiss, Rebecca; Walker, Robert; Mercer, Steve; Subbarao, Italo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nOn June 8 and 9, 2008, more than 4 inches of rain fell in the Iowa-Cedars River Basin causing widespread flooding along the Cedar River in Benton, Linn, Johnson, and Cedar Counties. As a result of the flooding, there were 18 deaths, 106 injuries, and over 38,000 people displaced from their homes; this made it necessary for the Iowa Department of Health to conduct a rapid needs assessment to quantify the scope and effect of the floods on human health. In response, the Iowa Department of Public Health mobilized interview teams to conduct rapid needs assessments using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based cluster sampling techniques. The information gathered was subsequently employed to estimate the public health impact and significant human needs that resulted from the flooding. While these assessments did not reveal significant levels of acute injuries resulting from the flood, they did show that many households had been temporarily displaced and that future health risks may emerge as the result of inadequate access to prescription medications or the presence of environmental health hazards. This exercise highlights the need for improved risk communication measures and ongoing surveillance and relief measures. It also demonstrates the utility of rapid needs assessment survey tools and suggests that increasing use of such surveys can have significant public health benefits.\n\nTissue Preservation Assessment Preliminary Results\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGlobus, Ruth; Costes, Sylvain\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPre-flight groundbased testing done to prepare for the first Rodent Research mission validation flight, RR1 (Choi et al, 2016 PlosOne).

Angiogenesis appears to be a promising target for lung cancer therapy; however, the clinical significance of vascular changes are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the types and morphology of blood vessels in various lung carcinomas. Using double immunostaining, we investigated 39 biopsies from patients admitted with various histological types of lung carcinoma. Tumor blood vessels were quantified separately for CD34/smooth muscle actin and described as either immature, intermediate or mature. Double immunostaining evaluation of the type of blood vessels in lung carcinomas revealed a marked heterogeneity. The immature and intermediate type of vessels were more common in adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung. Small cell lung carcinomas revealed a significant correlation between pathological and immature types of blood vessels. Therefore, quantifying the types of tumor vessels in lung carcinomas may be an important element to improve the results of anti-vascular therapy.

A mixed-methods design was used to perform the needs assessment. A pre-and postsurvey was administered to workshop participants. Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School (HMS), Department of Ophthalmology. HMS ophthalmology residents from postgraduate years 2-4 participated in the needs assessment and the workshop. Ophthalmology residency program directors in the United States participated in national needs assessment. Ophthalmology program directors across the United States were queried on their perception of resident communication skills training through an online survey. A targeted needs assessment in the form of a narrative exercise captured resident perspectives on communication in ophthalmology from HMS residents. A group of HMS residents participated in the pilot workshop and a pre- and postsurvey was administered to participants to assess its effectiveness. The survey of program directors yielded a response rate of 40%. Ninety percent of respondents agreed that the communication skills training in their programs could be improved. Fifteen of 24 residents (62%) completed the needs assessment. Qualitative analysis of the narrative material revealed four themes; (1) differing expectations, (2) work role and environment, (3) challenges specific to ophthalmology, and (4) successful strategies adopted. Nine residents participated in the workshop. There was a significant improvement post-workshop in resident reported scores on their ability to manage their emotions during difficult conversations (p = 0.03). There is an opportunity to improve communication skills training in ophthalmology residency through formalized curriculum. Copyright Â© 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Its development was motivated by the possibility that multiple sites in the nuclear weapons states of the former Soviet Union might be opened to such monitoring under the provisions of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The assessment was performed at three levels. One level evaluated how well the planned approach addressed the target application, and which involved tracking sensitive items moving into and around a site being monitoredmoreÂ Â» as part of an international treaty or other agreement. The second level examined the overall design and development approach, while the third focused on individual subsystems within the total package. Unfortunately, the system was delivered as disassembled parts and pieces, with very poor documentation. Thus, the assessment was based on fragmentary operating data coupled with an analysis of what documents were provided with the system. The system design seemed to be a reasonable match to the requirements of the target application; however, important questions about site manning and top level administrative control were left unanswered. Four weaknesses in the overall design and development approach were detected: (1) poor configuration control and management, (2) inadequate adherence to a well defined architectural standard, (3) no apparent provision for improving top level error tolerance, and (4) weaknesses in the object oriented programming approach. The individual subsystems were found to offer few features or capabilities that were new or unique, even at the conceptual level. The CMS might possibly have offered a unique combination of features, but this level of integration was never realized, and it had no unique capabilities that could be readily extracted for use in another system.Â«Â less\n\nNational Lakes Assessment 2007 Results\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThe National Lakes Assessment samples over 1,000 lakes, ponds and reservoirs across the country.

A total of 120 participants enrolled in a 'Fundamentals of Biochemistry' course contributed to this mixed-methodological study. The population of interest consisted primarily of pre-nursing and sport and exercise science majors. This course is typically associated with a high (<30%) combined drop/failure rate, thus the course provided the researcher with an ideal context in which to apply novel transfer assessment strategies. In the past, students within this population have reported very little chemistry background. In the following study, student-generated diagrammatic representations and written explanations were coded thematically using a highly objective rubric that was designed specifically for this study. Responses provided by the students were characterized on the macroscopic, microscopic, molecular-level, and integrated scales. Recall knowledge gain (i.e., knowledge that was gained through multiple-choice questioning techniques) was quantitatively correlated to learning style preferences (i.e., high-object, low-object, and non-object). Quantitative measures revealed that participants tended toward an object (i.e., snapshot) -based visualization preference, a potentially limiting factor in their desire to consider dynamic properties of fundamental biochemical contexts such as heat-induced protein denaturation. When knowledge transfer was carefully assessed within the predefined context, numerous misconceptions pertaining to the fundamental and dynamic nature of protein structure were revealed. Misconceptions tended to increase as the transfer model shifted away from the context presented in the original learning material. Ultimately, a fundamentally new, novel, and unique measure of\n\n24 CFR 50.33 - Action resulting from the assessment.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 24 Housing and Urban Development 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Action resulting from the... and Related Reviews Â§ 50.33 Action resulting from the assessment.

Most information available to conduct security risk assessments for these malevolent acts is obtained from subject matter experts as subjective judgements. Qualitative reasoning approaches such as approximate reasoning and evidential reasoning are useful for modeling the predicted risk from information provided by subject matter experts. Absent from these approaches is a consistent means to compare the security risk assessment results. Associated with each predicted risk reasoning result is a quantifiable amount of information uncertainty which canmoreÂ Â» be measured and used to compare the results. This paper explores using entropy measures to quantify the information uncertainty associated with conflict and non-specificity in the predicted reasoning results. The measured quantities of conflict and non-specificity can ultimately be used to compare qualitative reasoning results which are important in triage studies and ultimately resource allocation. Straight forward extensions of previous entropy measures are presented here to quantify the non-specificity and conflict associated with security risk assessment results obtained from qualitative reasoning models.Â«Â less\n\nAssessing cosmetic results after breast conserving surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nCardoso, Maria JoÃ£o; Oliveira, Helder; Cardoso, Jaime\n\n2014-07-01\n\n\"Taking less treating better\" has been one of the major improvements of breast cancer surgery in the last four decades. The application of this principle translates into equivalent survival of breast cancer conserving treatment (BCT) when compared to mastectomy, with a better cosmetic outcome. While it is relatively easy to evaluate the oncological results of BCT, the cosmetic outcome is more difficult to measure due to the lack of an effective and consensual procedure. The assessment of cosmetic outcome has been mainly subjective, undertaken by a panel of expert observers or/and by patient self-assessment. Unfortunately, the reproducibility of these methods is low. Objective methods have higher values of reproducibility but still lack the inclusion of several features considered by specialists in BCT to be fundamental for cosmetic outcome. The recent addition of volume information obtained with 3D images seems promising. Until now, unfortunately, no method is considered to be the standard of care. This paper revises the history of cosmetic evaluation and guides us into the future aiming at a method that can easily be used and accepted by all, caregivers and caretakers, allowing not only the comparison of results but the improvement of performance.

Observation of these encounters could reveal important information on the students' clinical reasoning abilities, especially during history taking. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze what expert physicians apply as indicators in their assessment of medical students' diagnostic reasoning abilities during history taking. Twelve randomly selected clinical encounter recordings of students at the end of the internal medicine clerkships were observed by six expert assessors, who were prompted to formulate their assessment criteria in a think-aloud procedure. These formulations were then analyzed to identify the common denominators and leading principles. The main indicators of clinical reasoning ability were abstracted from students' observable acts during history taking in the encounter. These were: taking control, recognizing and responding to relevant information, specifying symptoms, asking specific questions that point to pathophysiological thinking, placing questions in a logical order, checking agreement with patients, summarizing and body language. In addition, patients' acts and the course, result and efficiency of the conversation were identified as indicators of clinical reasoning, whereas context, using self as a reference, and emotion/feelings were identified by the clinicians as variables in their assessment of clinical reasoning. In observing and assessing clinical reasoning during history taking by medical students, general and specific phenomena to be used as indicators for this process could be identified. These phenomena can be traced back to theories on the development and the process of clinical reasoning.\n\nCommunication Is Key: Unpacking \"Use of Assessment Results to Improve Student Learning\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSmith, Kristen L.; Good, Megan Rodgers; Sanchez, Elizabeth Hawk; Fulcher, Keston H.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough higher education institutions often engage in assessment practices, use of assessment results to improve student learning is rare (Blaich & Wise, 2011).

Early diagnosis of these disorders is one of the main methods for preventing serious diseases. The goal of this study was to assess the correlations between main physical indicators and the activity of certain acupuncture channels using the thermal Akabane test based on ancient Chinese diagnostic methods. This test measures the pain thresholds' temperature sensitivity when a point source of heat is applied to the \"entrance-exit\" points of each channel. The skin temperature sensitivity in our bodies is a basic reactive system; it is as significant as such important indicators as body temperature and provides a very clear representation of functional and psychophysiological profiles. On the basis of our statistical study, we revealed reliable correspondence between the activity of certain acupuncture channels and main anthropometric and biometric data. Copyright Â© 2018.

To determine the value of the ultrasound in the assessment of the result of the endoscopic treatment of the RVU and in the detection of its complications. From 2001-2002 we have carried out the endoscopic treatment to an overall of 261 ureteral units of all degree and etiology. 246 were assessed post-operation with an ultrasound per month and all of them were evaluated with a cistography after 3 months. In a random sample of 92 units, the result of the isotopic cistography has been compared with the visualization of the implanted material in the bladder; and in a random sample of 56 units, the result of the isotopic cistography has been compared with the presence of ureteral jet in the study with ecodoppler-color after moisturizing of the patient. In order to do, we have done two corresponding comparative charts 2 x 2 and we have calculated the Sensibility and Specificity of the tests, as well as their predictive positive and negative values, the degree of similarity of both tests with the Kappa index, and the degree of statistical relevance with Chi squared. The ultrasound did not show significant changes if compared to previous studies in 213 units (86,58 %) although in 5 patients an ectasia has been identified as attributed to the treatment. 3 of this patients have developed renoureteral pain, and in 2 pain has spontaneously disappeared as shown in later tests.

It is widely known that the meteorological conditions can significantly influence the outcomes of such assessment, since it determines the results of the calculation of the radionuclide environmental transport. This study aims to assess the impacts of the meteorological conditions to the results of the consequence assessment. The consequence assessment code, OSCAAR, of Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is used for the assessment. The results of the consequence assessment using Thai meteorological data are compared with those using Japanese meteorological data. The Thai case has following characteristics. Low wind speed made the radionuclides concentrate at the center comparing to the Japanese case. The squalls induced the peaks in the ground concentration distribution. The evacuated land is larger than the Japanese case though the relocated land is smaller, which is attributed to the concentration of the radionuclides near the release point.\n\nOne- and multi-segment foot models lead to opposite results on ankle joint kinematics during gait: Implications for clinical assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nPothrat, Claude; Authier, Guillaume; Viehweger, Elke; Berton, Eric; Rao, Guillaume\n\n2015-06-01\n\nBiomechanical models representing the foot as a single rigid segment are commonly used in clinical or sport evaluations. However, neglecting internal foot movements could lead to significant inaccuracies on ankle joint kinematics. The present study proposed an assessment of 3D ankle kinematic outputs using two distinct biomechanical models and their application in the clinical flat foot case. Results of the Plug in Gait (one segment foot model) and the Oxford Foot Model (multisegment foot model) were compared for normal children (9 participants) and flat feet children (9 participants). Repeated measures of Analysis of Variance have been performed to assess the Foot model and Group effects on ankle joint kinematics. Significant differences were observed between the two models for each group all along the gait cycle. In particular for the flat feet group, opposite results between the Oxford Foot Model and the Plug in Gait were revealed at heelstrike, with the Plug in Gait showing a 4.7Â° ankle dorsal flexion and 2.7Â° varus where the Oxford Foot Model showed a 4.8Â° ankle plantar flexion and 1.6Â° valgus. Ankle joint kinematics of the flat feet group was more affected by foot modeling than normal group. Foot modeling appeared to have a strong influence on resulting ankle kinematics. Moreover, our findings showed that this influence could vary depending on the population. Studies involving ankle joint kinematic assessment should take foot modeling with caution.

This paper presents the results of a ten-year spot sampling programme (2005-2014) of the commercially most important pelagic fish species harvested in Norway. Fish-, surface-, and storage water samples were collected from fishing vessels and processing factories. Totally 1,181 samples were assessed with respect to microbiological quality, hygiene and food safety. We introduce a quality and safety assessment scheme for fresh pelagic fish recommending limits for heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), thermos tolerant coliforms, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes. According to the scheme, in 25 of 41 samplings, sub-optimal conditions were found with respect to quality, whereas in 21 and 9 samplings, samples were not in compliance concerning hygiene and food safety, respectively. The present study has revealed that the quality of pelagic fish can be optimised by improving the hygiene conditions at some critical points at an early phase of the production chain. Thus, the proposed assessment scheme may provide a useful tool for the industry to optimise quality and maintain consumer safety of pelagic fishery products. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.

E.; Reth, A. D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - R Series (GOES-R) was launched on November 19, 2016, and was designated GOESR-16 upon reaching geostationary orbit ten days later. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is the primary instrument on the GOES-R series for imaging Earth's surface and atmosphere to aid in weather prediction and climate monitoring. We developed algorithms and software for independent verification of the ABI Image Navigation and Registration (INR). Since late January 2017, four INR metrics have been continuously generated to monitor the ABI INR performance: navigation (NAV) error, channel-to-channel registration (CCR) error, frame-to-frame registration (FFR) error, and within-frame registration (WIFR) error. In this paper, we will describe the fundamental algorithm used for the image registration and briefly discuss the processing flow of INR Performance Assessment Tool Set (IPATS) developed for ABI INR. The assessment of the accuracy shows that IPATS measurements error is about 1/20 of the size of a pixel. Then the GOES-16 NAV assessments results, the primary metric, from January to August 2017, will be presented. The INR has improved over time as post-launch tests were performed and corrections were applied. The mean NAV error of the visible and near infrared (VNIR) channels dropped from 20 Î¼rad in January to around 5 Î¼rad (+/-4 Î¼rad, 1 Ï) in June, while the mean NAV error of long wave infrared (LWIR) channels dropped from around 70 Î¼rad in January to around 5 Î¼rad (+/-15 Î¼rad, 1 Ï) in June. A full global ABI image is composed with 22 east-west direction swaths. The swath-wise NAV error analysis shows that there was some variation in the mean swath-wise NAV errors. The variations are about as much as 20% of the scene NAV mean errors. As expected, the swaths over the tropical area have far fewer valid assessments (matchups) than those in mid-latitude region due to cloud coverage.

In this study, tree-core samples were collected at a Superfund site to determine if the sample-collection location around a particular tree could reveal the subsurface location, or direction, of soil and soil-gas contaminant plumes. Contaminant-centroid vectors were calculated from tree-core data to reveal contaminant distributions in directional tree samples at a higher resolution, and vectors were correlated with soil-gas characterization collected using conventional methods. Results clearly demonstrated that directional tree coring around tree trunks can indicate gradients in soil and soil-gas contaminant plumes, and the strength of the correlations were directly proportionate to the magnitude of tree-core concentration gradients (spearmanâs coefficient of -0.61 and -0.55 in soil and tree-core gradients, respectively). Linear regression indicates agreement between the concentration-centroid vectors is significantly affected by in-planta and soil concentration gradients and when concentration centroids in soil are closer to trees. Given the existing link between soil-gas and vapor intrusion, this study also indicates that directional tree coring might be applicable in vapor intrusion assessment.\n\nContaminant Gradients in Trees: Directional Tree Coring Reveals Boundaries of Soil and Soil-Gas Contamination with Potential Applications in Vapor Intrusion Assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Jordan L; Samaranayake, V A; Limmer, Matthew A; Schumacher, John G; Burken, Joel G\n\n2017-12-19\n\nContaminated sites pose ecological and human-health risks through exposure to contaminated soil and groundwater.

When the workers began the job, choices were provided between more and less preferred tasks (determined by previous assessment). Results supported the assessment for identifying single task preferences, but did not reveal preferences of 2 workers for alternate tasks. Results are discussed in terms of evaluating other prework assessments that may reveal task-alternation preferences.\n\nSelf-harming behavior of a parent with borderline personality disorder assessed using revealed preference and attributional approaches: a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTustin, R Don\n\n2002-08-01\n\nThis article discusses a case study involving a parent with Borderline Personality Disorder who exhibited self-harming behaviors. Assessment and intervention were based both on a review of the client's attributions about causes of her own behavior as being either internalizing or externalizing, and on a review of motivation of the behaviors using functional analysis. Antecedent situations for self-harming behaviors were identified to provide a basis for reviewing the client's attributions of reasons for disordered behavior. A new technique of functional analysis was applied using the principle of revealed preference arising from behavioral economics. Revealed preference identified outcomes that were valued by the client, enabling new responses to be identified to attain these reinforcers. Attribution re-training was provided. Significant reductions in self-harming behaviors were achieved during brief therapy and were maintained during follow-up.\n\nAn overview of results from the GEWEX radiation flux assessment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRaschke, E.; Stackhouse, P.; Kinne, S.; Contributors from Europe; the USA\n\n2013-05-01\n\nMulti-annual radiative flux averages of the International Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), of the GEWEX - Surface Radiation Budget Project (SRB) and of the Clouds and Earth Radiative Energy System (CERES) are compared and analyzed to characterize the Earth's radiative budget, assess differences and identify possible causes. These satellite based data-sets are also compared to results of a median model, which represents 20 climate models, that participated in the 4th IPCC assessment. Consistent distribution patterns and seasonal variations among the satellite data-sets demonstrate their scientific value, which would further increase if the datasets would be reanalyzed with more accurate and consistent ancillary data.\n\nLessons from a Large-Scale Assessment: Results from Conceptual Inventories\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThacker, Beth; Dulli, Hani; Pattillo, Dave; West, Keith\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe report conceptual inventory results of a large-scale assessment project at a large university.

M.; Glennie, P.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP) was initiated by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to create the first baseline assessment of all of the planet's transboundary water resources. The TWAP River Basin component consists of a baseline comparative assessment of 270 transboundary river basins, including all but the smallest basins, to enable the identification of priority issues and hotspots at risk from a variety of stressors. The assessment is indicator based and it is intended to provide a relative analysis of basins based on risks to societies and ecosystems. Models and observational data have been used to create 14 indicators covering environmental, human and agricultural water stress; nutrient and wastewater pollution; extinction risk; governance and institutions; economic dependence on water resources; societal wellbeing at sub-basin scales; and societal risks from climate extremes. The methodology is not limited to transboundary basins, but can be applied to all river basins. This presentation will provide a summary of the methods and results of the TWAP River Basin component. It will also briefly discuss preliminary results of the TWAP lakes and aquifer components.\n\nAutomated interpretation of home blood pressure assessment (Hy-Result software) versus physician's assessment: a validation study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPostel-Vinay, Nicolas; Bobrie, Guillaume; Ruelland, Alan; Oufkir, Majida; Savard, Sebastien; Persu, Alexandre; Katsahian, Sandrine; Plouin, Pierre F\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHy-Result is the first software for self-interpretation of home blood pressure measurement results, taking into account both the recommended thresholds for normal values and patient characteristics. We compare the software-generated classification with the physician's evaluation. The primary assessment criterion was whether algorithm classification of the blood pressure (BP) status concurred with the physician's advice (blinded to the software's results) following a consultation (n=195 patients). Secondary assessment was the reliability of text messages. In the 58 untreated patients, the agreement between classification of the BP status generated by the software and the physician's classification was 87.9%. In the 137 treated patients, the agreement was 91.9%. The Îº-test applied for all the patients was 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.73-0.89). After correction of errors identified in the algorithm during the study, agreement increased to 95.4% [Îº=0.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-0.97)]. For 100% of the patients with comorbidities (n=46), specific text messages were generated, indicating that a physician might recommend a target BP lower than 135/85âmmHg. Specific text messages were also generated for 100% of the patients for whom global cardiovascular risks markedly exceeded norms. Classification by Hy-Result is at least as accurate as that of a specialist in current practice (http://www.hy-result.com).\n\nAssessing Internet energy intensity: A review of methods and results\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCoroama, Vlad C., E-mail: vcoroama@gmail.com; Hilty, Lorenz M.; Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Lerchenfeldstr. 5, 9014 St. Gallen\n\nAssessing the average energy intensity of Internet transmissions is a complex task that has been a controversial subject of discussion. Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of magnitude â from 0.0064 kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches used so far in such assessments: i) topâdown analyses based on estimates of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches that model all componentsmoreÂ Â» needed to sustain an amount of Internet traffic, and iii) bottomâup approaches based on case studies and generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors: a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b) whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task, while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year. Separating the Internet as a data transmission system from the end devices leads to more accurate models and to results that are more informative for decision makers, because end devices and the networking equipment of the Internet usually belong to different spheres of control. -- Highlights: â¢ Assessments of the energy intensity of the Internet differ by a factor of 20,000. â¢ We review topâdown, model-based, and bottomâup estimates from literature. â¢ Main divergence factors are the year studied and the inclusion of end\n\nMining the National Career Assessment Examination Result Using Clustering Algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPagudpud, M. V.; Palaoag, T. T.; Padirayon, L. M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEducation is an essential process today which elicits authorities to discover and establish innovative strategies for educational improvement. This study applied data mining using clustering technique for knowledge extraction from the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) result in the Division of Quirino. The NCAE is an examination given to all grade 9 students in the Philippines to assess their aptitudes in the different domains. Clustering the students is helpful in identifying studentsâ learning considerations. With the use of the RapidMiner tool, clustering algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), k-means, k-medoid, expectation maximization clustering, and support vector clustering algorithms were analyzed. The silhouette indexes of the said clustering algorithms were compared, and the result showed that the k-means algorithm with k = 3 and silhouette index equal to 0.196 is the most appropriate clustering algorithm to group the students. Three groups were formed having 477 students in the determined group (cluster 0), 310 proficient students (cluster 1) and 396 developing students (cluster 2). The data mining technique used in this study is essential in extracting useful information from the NCAE result to better understand the abilities of students which in turn is a good basis for adopting teaching strategies.\n\nComprehensive Red List Assessment Reveals Exceptionally High Extinction Risk to Madagascar Palms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRakotoarinivo, Mijoro; Dransfield, John; Bachman, Steven P.; Moat, Justin; Baker, William J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe establishment of baseline IUCN Red List assessments for plants is a crucial step in conservation planning. Nowhere is this more important than in biodiversity hotspots that are subject to significant anthropogenic pressures, such as Madagascar. Here, all Madagascar palm species are assessed using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, version 3.1. Our results indicate that 83% of the 192 endemic species are threatened, nearly four times the proportion estimated for plants globally and exceeding estimates for all other comprehensively evaluated plant groups in Madagascar. Compared with a previous assessment in 1995, the number of Endangered and Critically Endangered species has substantially increased, due to the discovery of 28 new species since 1995, most of which are highly threatened. The conservation status of most species included in both the 1995 and the current assessments has not changed. Where change occurred, more species have moved to lower threat categories than to higher categories, because of improved knowledge of species and their distributions, rather than a decrease in extinction risk. However, some cases of genuine deterioration in conservation status were also identified. Palms in Madagascar are primarily threatened by habitat loss due to agriculture and biological resource use through direct exploitation or collateral damage. The recent extension of Madagascarâs protected area network is highly beneficial for palms, substantially increasing the number of threatened species populations included within reserves. Notably, three of the eight most important protected areas for palms are newly designated. However, 28 threatened and data deficient species are not protected by the expanded network, including some Critically Endangered species. Moreover, many species occurring in protected areas are still threatened, indicating that threatening processes persist even in reserves.

To investigate the long-term (ie, 6-year) impact of a required remake vs an optional remake on student performance in a compounding laboratory course in which studentsâ compounded preparations were analyzed. Methods. The analysis data for several preparations made by students were compared for differences in the analyzed content of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the number of students who successfully compounded the preparation on the first attempt. Results. There was a consistent statistical difference in the API amount or concentration in 4 of the preparations (diphenhydramine, ketoprofen, metoprolol, and progesterone) in each optional remake year compared to the required remake year. As the analysis requirement was continued, the outcome for each preparation approached and/or attained the expected API result. Two preparations required more than 1 year to demonstrate a statistical difference. Conclusion. The analytical assessment resulted in a consistent, long-term improvement in student performance during the 5-year period after the optional remake policy was instituted. Our assumption is that investment in such an assessment would result in a similar benefits at other colleges and schools of pharmacy.

The PSAR (preliminary safety assessment report) was subject to an initial regulatory review during mid-1992. The regulatory authority provided comments on many aspects of the safety assessment documentation including a number of questions on specific PA (Performance Assessment) modelling assumptions. As a result of these comments as well as a separate detailed review of the IRUS disposal concept, changes were made to the conceptual and mathematical models. The original disposal concept included a non-sorbing vault backfill, with a strong reliance on the wasteformmoreÂ Â» as a barrier. This concept was altered to decrease reliance on the wasteform by replacing the original backfill with a sand/clinoptilolite mix, which is a better sorber of metal cations. This change lead to changes in the PA models which in turn altered the safety case for the facility. This, and other changes that impacted performance assessment modelling are the subject of this paper.Â«Â less\n\nLong-term Results of an Analytical Assessment of Student Compounded Preparations.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoark, Angie M; Anksorus, Heidi N; Shrewsbury, Robert P\n\n2014-11-15\n\nTo investigate the long-term (ie, 6-year) impact of a required remake vs an optional remake on student performance in a compounding laboratory course in which students' compounded preparations were analyzed.

Although early screening and intervention may help prevent or reduce the damaging health and productivity effects of problem drinking, barriers to behavioral change may render broad-based prevention efforts ineffectual. This study examined the correlates of two potential barriers to changes in drinking behavior--underestimation of drinking and lack of knowledge of helping resources--using data from web-based employee alcohol screenings. Anonymous screening data from 1185 employees of ten companies participating in the 2003 National Alcohol Screening Day were analyzed. The AUDIT, a 10-item screening instrument developed by the World Health Organization, was used to measure drinking behavior; employees' subjective assessments of their drinking were also obtained. Over 53% of participants subjectively underestimated their drinking relative to their AUDIT results, and 58% of respondents did not know whether their medical insurance included benefits for alcohol treatment. Logistic regression analysis revealed that younger and male respondents tended to have the highest AUDIT scores and also (along with married respondents) were most likely to underestimate their drinking. Younger, unmarried respondents were least likely to be aware of their alcohol treatment insurance benefits. Current corporate efforts to curtail problem drinking among employees may not adequately address barriers to change. Targeting at-risk employee groups for alcohol screening and dissemination of information about health insurance benefits and treatment options is recommended, as is providing personalized feedback based on screening results to raise awareness of at-risk drinking and available helping resources.\n\nPredictors and assessment of cognitive dysfunction resulting from ischaemic stroke\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGottesman, Rebecca F; Hillis, Argye E\n\n2013-01-01\n\nStroke remains a primary cause of morbidity throughout the world mainly because of its effect on cognition. Individuals can recover from physical disability resulting from stroke, but might be unable to return to their previous occupations or independent life because of cognitive impairments. Cognitive dysfunction ranges from focal deficits, resulting directly from an area of infarction or from hypoperfusion in adjacent tissue, to more global cognitive dysfunction. Global dysfunction is likely to be related to other underlying subclinical cerebrovascular disease, such as white-matter disease or subclinical infarcts. Study of cognitive dysfunction after stroke is complicated by varying definitions and lack of measurement of cognition before stroke. Additionally, stroke can affect white-matter connectivity, so newer imaging techniques, such as diffusion-tensor imaging and magnetisation transfer imaging, that can be used to assess this subclinical injury are important tools in the assessment of cognitive dysfunction after stroke. As research is increasingly focused on the role of preventable risk factors in the development of dementia, the role of stroke in the development of cognitive impairment and dementia could be another target for prevention.

A total of 108 patients were evaluated at the beginning of their CR, at 6 and 12âmonths after discharge. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess depression, anxiety, illness perception and work stress at each time stage. Results showed reports of depressive symptoms significantly decreased (pâ<â0.05) and subjective mental (pâ=â0.001) and physical health (pâ<â0.001) improved over time. Patients revealed a decrease in Type A behaviour pattern (pâ<â0.001) and in job satisfaction levels (pâ=â0.01), greater internal locus of control (pâ<â0.01) and increased use of the coping strategy 'Involvement' (pâ<â0.01). Major findings are that cardiac patients had an improvement in subjective psychological health and did not perceive increased work stress after their RTW. Patients' psychological health and work stress need to be assessed during the CR and should be also carefully monitored after the RTW in order to identify patients' psychological and work-related barriers and facilitate a safe and successful work reintegration.

Although certain key molecules have been identified, the molecular interactions of the healing progress are not completely understood. Moreover, a clinical routine for predicting the quality of bone healing after a fracture in an early phase is missing. This is mainly due to a lack of techniques to comprehensively screen for cytokines, growth factors and metabolites at their local site of action. Since all soluble molecules of interest are present in the fracture hematoma, its in-depth assessment could reveal potential markers for the monitoring of bone healing. Here, we describe an approach for sampling and quantification of cytokines and metabolites by using microdialysis, combined with solid phase extractions of proteins from wound fluids. By using a control group with an isolated soft tissue wound, we could reveal several bone defect-specific molecular features. In bone defect dialysates the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL3 were quantified with either a higher or earlier response compared to dialysate from soft tissue wound. Moreover, by analyzing downstream adaptions of the cells on protein level and focusing on early immune response, several proteins involved in the immune cell migration and activity could be identified to be specific for the bone defect group, e.g. immune modulators, proteases and their corresponding inhibitors. Additionally, the metabolite screening revealed different profiles between the bone defect group and the control group. In summary, we identified potential biomarkers to indicate imbalanced healing progress on all levels of analysis.\n\nMicrodialysis Sampling from Wound Fluids Enables Quantitative Assessment of Cytokines, Proteins, and Metabolites Reveals Bone Defect-Specific Molecular Profiles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWissenbach, Dirk K.; Pfeiffer, Susanne E.
