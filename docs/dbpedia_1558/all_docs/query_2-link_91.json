A blues shouter, Jimmy Witherspoon enjoyed a strong hit run in the Forties. A native of Arkansas, Witherspoon left the world of gospel music and moved to Los Angeles at age 16. After a stint in the merchant marines, Witherspoon returned to California in 1944. Auditioning for bandleader Jay McShann during a stop in Vallejo, California, the deep-voiced Witherspoon replaced vocalist Walter Brown in 1944. Remaining in the shadows of McShann's band, Witherspoon was little known until the release of the chart-topping R&B smash 'Ain't Nobody's Business', the track featuring the bluesy piano of Jay McShann. Amicably parting with McShann in 1947, Witherspoon landed a major hit with a cover of the blues standard 'Ain't Nobody's Business' (1949) and followed up with 'In The Evening When The Sun Goes Down' (1949), 'No Rollin' Blues' (1949), and 'Wind Is Blowing'. His career hampered by the rise of doo-... groups, Witherspoon declared bankruptcy in 1953.\n\nRediscovered after an appearance at the 1959 Monterey Jazz Festival, Witherspoon took a stylistic turn toward jazz. During the next decade, he would record with leading jazzmen such as Gerry Mulligan, Jack McDuff, and Richard \"Grooves\" Holmes. Also an actor, Witherspoon appeared in several feature films including To Sleep With Anger, and in the Seventies gave up touring for DJ work at KMET in Los Angeles. Lured back to the stage by Eric Burdon, Witherspoon landed a surprise R&B chart hit in 1975 with 'Love Is A Five Letter Word'. Although diagnosed with throat cancer in the 1984, and told by doctors he would never again sing, Witherspoon was back on the road within a year. Performing until shortly before his death, he earned a Grammy nomination for the album Live At The Mint (1995). Succumbing to throat cancer, he died in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles. - Died September 18, 1997.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1924 - (Samuel) Thomas Beversdorf, composer and teacher is born at Yoakum, Tex.

(B.M., 1945), Rogers and Hanson at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. (M.M., 1946; D.M.A., 1957), Honegger and Copland at the Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood (summer, 1947), and privately with Fuleihan. He was a trombonist in the Rochester (N.Y.) Philharmonic (1945-6), the Houston Symphony Orchestra (1946-48), and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (1948-49).

University School of Music in Bloomington (1951-77). - Died at Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 15, 1981.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1925 - Sonny Til (EARLINGTON CARL TILGHMAN) is born. The lead vocalist of the early R&B group The Orioles, the charismatic Sonny Til influenced a generation of doo-... singers with his stellar delivery. A native of Baltimore, Til sang in his high school choir. Drafted during World War II, he sang in the USO. Upon his return to Baltimore, Til was convinced by his girlfriend to enter a talent contest as a solo vocalist. Tall, thin, confident and possessing a strong high tenor voice, he won first prize. There he met and then teamed up with three other contestants to form a Ravens-like four-part harmony group called The Vibranairs. Fronted by Til, and soon managed by fledgling songwriter Deborah Chessler, the group auditioned for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scout radio programme in 1948.\n\nLosing to George Shearing but impressing Godfrey, the group landed a spot on Godfrey's more popular daytime show. There they met record label owner Jerry Blain who renamed the group The Orioles, after Maryland's official state bird. Beginning with the Chessler composition and crossover hit 'It's Too Soon To Know' (1948), The Orioles enjoyed a string of pioneering doo-... hits which included '(It's Gonna Be A) Lonely Christmas' (1948), 'Tell Me So' (1949), and the double-sided entry, 'What Are You Doing New Year's Eve'/'Lonely Christmas' (1949). Tragedy struck the group in 1950 just outside Baltimore when one of the band's vehicles was involved in a serious auto accident, killing Tommy Gaither and injuring two others. Severely curtailing their touring schedule, The Orioles saw their career decline. After a two-year absence from the charts, The Orioles returned with 'Baby, Please Don't Go' (1952).\n\nDuring this period, Til also released a number of solo singles and duets with Edna McGriff. Featuring Til's emotionally charged lead vocal, The Orioles scored their second crossover hit with a cover of the gospel-rooted, Darrell Glenn-penned standard, 'Crying In The Chapel'. Hoping to repeat their success, The Orioles managed one final hit with another gospel-styled number, 'In The Mission Of St. Augustine' (1953) but disintegrated after the release of the single, 'If You Believe'. Attempting to salvage the group, Til hired The Regals as the new Orioles. Signing with Vee-Jay, they managed a minor R&B hit with 'Happy Till The Letter' (1956). After disbanding The Orioles in 1958, Til pursued an ill-fated solo career at Jubilee, and then Roulette Records. Forming several incarnations of The Orioles beginning in the early Sixties, Til performed until shortly before his death in 1981. Heart failure complicated by diabetes. He died at Veteran's Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. - Died December 9, 1981.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1926 - Jazz trombonist Urbie Green is born in Mobile, Alabama.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1927 - Frank Traynor (Australian trombonist) is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1928 - Lubor Barta, Czech composer, is born at Lubna.

Founding keyboardist and harmonica player for The Grateful Dead, Ron \"Pig Pen\" McKernan was the group's blues anchor. McKernan was born in San Bruno, California, but raised in Palo Alto, his father a white R&B musician and San Francisco deejay. Dropping out of school, McKernan taught himself to play harmonica. Then while working in a music store, McKernan teamed with drummer Bill Kreutzmann to form The Zodiacs. McKernan then joined Bob Weir, Jerry Garcia, and others to form an acoustic jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions; switching to electric blues at McKernan's insistence, the renamed Warlocks were expanded with the additions of Phil Lesh and McKernan's earlier bandmate Bill Kreutzmann; in the group, McKernan was now playing Vox Continental and Hammond B-3 organs.\n\nSettling into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, the group was at the forefront of the psychedelic era. Soon garnering attention as the house-band for Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters' \"acid tests\" parties, The Warlocks embraced the then-legal hallucinogenic drug, LSD. Renamed The Grateful Dead, the group gained a sizable local fanbase via a series of free, outdoor concerts. Signed to Warner Brothers Records in 1967, Bob Weir would emerge as the chief vocalist, with McKernan providing an occasional lead. Very overweight, and sporting long black whiskers and dishevelled, tie-dyed garb, the raspy-voiced McKernan would pace and structure the group's songs, which were punctuated by his long, improvised keyboard or harmonica solos.\n\nAfter adding Mickey Hart, Tom Constanten, and lyricist Robert Hunter, the group performed at both Woodstock and Altamont, and had commercial success with psychedelic-styled albums such as Aoxomoxoa and American Beauty, the latter containing their first radio hit, 'Truckin''. But suffering from liver damage and close to death, McKernan left the group in 1972, and was replaced by Merle Saunders, and then, Keith Godchaux. Garcia would emerge as the group's clear-cut leader, with Weir assuming greater lead-vocal duties.\n\nAn exceptionally heavy drinker much of his adult life, he suffered with liver disease and had undergone a series of stomach operations. With his health failing, he dropped out of the band and waited to die. He was found dead in a friend's backyard in Corte Madera, California. McKernan was the only Grateful Dead member who did not use drugs in the group's post Acid-Test period. - Died March 8, 1973.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1947 - John Kirkpatrick, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]accordionist and songwriter[/FONT][FONT=&quot]is born in Chiswick, a suburb of London, England. He began performing as an accompanist for traditional English Morris dancing— a form of ritual dance that has enjoyed a revival of interest since the turn of the 20th century. Playing ACCORDION and concertina, Kirkpatrick attracted the attention of producer/ bandleader ASHLEY HUTCHINGS, who asked him to participate in an album of FOLK-ROCK arrangements of Morris dance tunes called [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Morris On, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]which was released in 1971; at the same time, Kirkpatrick's first solo album was released on the Trailer label. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hutchings and Kirkpatrick then collaborated on [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Rattlebone and Ploughjack, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]a recording focusing on a variety of English dance music. The two would work together on various projects through the early 1980s, including theatrical productions and performances with Hutching's Albion Band. Kirkpatrick also formed a duo with his then wife, oboe/hammer dulcimer player Sue Harris, and the two recorded and toured together. In the late 1970s through mid-1980s, Kirkpatrick often performed in a trio with MARTIN CARTHY and trumpeter Howard Evans; this led to the formation of a band, Brass Monkey, which was active in the mid-to-late 1980s (and revived in the late 1990s). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Kirkpatrick also toured with folk-rock guitarist Richard Thompson, playing on many of his 1980s and early 1990s recordings. All the while, he pursued a solo career as a performer. In the mid-1990s he formed his own folk-rock group, the John Kirkpatrick Band, featuring guitarist Graeme Taylor and other musicians who had been associated with the Albion Band in the past. Kirkpatrick has also composed a number of tunes and songs in a traditional style, many of which have become favorites among folk revivalists.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1949 - Airrion Love (US baritone singer; Stylistics) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1949 - Actor/singer Keith Carradine is born in San Mateo, California.

He is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of the Soviet Symphony\". Myaskovsky was awarded the Stalin Prize five times, more than any other composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky was born in Modlin Fortress (Polish: Modlin Fortress), near Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, the son of an engineer officer in the Russian army. After the death of his mother the family was brought up by his father's sister, Yelikonida Konstantinovna Myaskovskaya, who had been a singer at the Saint Petersburg Opera. The family moved to Saint Petersburg in his teens.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Though he learned piano and violin, he was discouraged from pursuing a musical career, and entered the military. However, a performance of Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony conducted by Arthur Nikisch in 1896 inspired him to become a composer. In 1902 he completed his training as an engineer, like his father. As a young subaltern with a Sappers Battalion in Moscow, he took some private lessons with Reinhold Glière and when he was posted to St Petersburg he studied with Ivan Krizhanovsky as preparation for entry into the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he enrolled in 1906 and became a student of Anatoly Lyadov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A late starter, Myaskovsky was the oldest student in his class but soon became firm friends with the youngest, Sergei Prokofiev, and they remained friends throughout the older man's life. At the Conservatory, they shared a dislike of their professor Anatoly Lyadov, which, since Lyadov disliked the music of Edvard Grieg, led to Myaskovsky's choice of a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his String Quartet No. 3.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Prokofiev and Myaskovsky worked together at the conservatory on at least one work, a lost symphony, parts of which were later scavenged to provide material for the slow movement of Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 4. They both later produced works using materials from this period—in Prokofiev's case the Third and Fourth piano sonatas; in Myaskovsky's, other works, such as his Tenth string quartet and what are now the Fifth and Sixth piano sonatas, all revisions of works he wrote at this time.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Early influences on Myaskovsky's emerging personal style were Tchaikovsky, strongly echoed in the first of his surviving symphonies (in C minor, Op. 3, 1908/1921), which was his Conservatory graduation piece, and Alexander Scriabin, whose influence comes more to the fore in Myaskovsky's First Piano Sonata in D minor, Op. 6 (1907–10), described by Glenn Gould as \"perhaps one of the most remarkable pieces of its time\", and his Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 15 of 1914, a turbulent and lugubrious work in two large movements.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky graduated in 1911 and afterwards taught in Saint Petersburg, where he also developed a supplementary career as a penetrating musical critic. (He was one of the most intelligent and supportive advocates in Russia for the music of Igor Stravinsky, though the story that Stravinsky dedicated The Rite of Spring to Myaskovsky is untrue.)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Called up during World War I, he was wounded and suffered shell-shock on the Austrian front, then worked on the naval fortifications at Tallinn. During this period he produced two diametrically opposed works, his Symphony No. 4 (Op. 17, in E minor) and his Symphony No. 5 (Op. 18, in D major). The next few years saw the violent death of his father, who as an ex-Tsarist general was murdered by Red Army soldiers while waiting for a train in the winter of 1918–19, and the death of his aunt, to whom he was closely attached, in the winter of 1919–20. His brother-in-law, the husband of his sister Valentina Yakovlevna, had committed suicide before the War because of financial troubles. Myaskovsky himself served in the Red Army from 1917 to 1921; in the latter year he was appointed to the teaching staff of the Moscow Conservatory and membership of the Composers' Union. Thereafter he lived in Moscow, sharing an apartment with his widowed sister Valentina and her daughter. (He also had a married sister, Vera.)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1920s and 1930s Myaskovsky was the leading composer in the USSR dedicated to developing basically traditional, sonata-based forms. He wrote no operas—though in 1918 he planned one based on Dostoyevsky's novel The ....., with a libretto by Pierre Souvtchinsky; but he would eventually write a total of 27 symphonies (plus three sinfoniettas, three concertos and works in other orchestral genres), 13 string quartets, 9 piano sonatas as well as many miniatures and vocal works. Through his devotion to these forms, and the fact that he always maintained a high standard of craftsmanship, he was sometimes referred to as 'the musical conscience of Moscow'. His continuing commitment to musical modernism was shown by the fact that along with Alexander Mosolov, Gavriil Popov and Nikolai Roslavets, Myaskovsky was one of the leaders of the Association for Contemporary Music. While he remained in close contact with Prokofiev during the latter's years of exile from the USSR, he never followed him there.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky's reaction to the events of 1917–21 inspired his Symphony No. 6 (1921–1923, rev. 1947—this is the version that is almost always played or recorded) his only choral symphony and the longest of his 27 symphonies, sets a brief poem (in Russian though the score allows Latin alternatively—see the American Symphony Orchestra page below on the origins of the poem—the soul looking at the body it has abandoned.) The finale contains quite a few quotes—the Dies Irae theme, as well as French revolutionary tunes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The years 1921–1933, the first years of his teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, were the years in which he experimented most, producing works such as the Tenth and Thirteenth symphonies, the fourth piano sonata and his first string quartet. Perhaps the best example of this experimentative phase is the Thirteenth symphony, which was the only one of his works to be premiered in the United States.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1920s and 1930s Myaskovsky's symphonies were quite frequently played in Western Europe and the USA. His works were issued by Universal Edition, one of Europe's most prestigious publishers. In 1935, a survey made by CBS of its radio audience asking the question \"Who, in your opinion, of contemporary composers will remain among the world's great in 100 years?\" placed Myaskovsky in the top ten along with Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Sibelius, Ravel, de Falla and Fritz Kreisler.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The next few years after 1933 are characterized mostly by his apparent discontinuation of his experimental trend, though with no general decrease in craftsmanship. The Violin Concerto dates from these years, the first of two or three concerti, depending on what one counts, the second being for cello, and a third if one counts the Lyric Concertino, Op. 32 as a concerto work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another work from the period up to 1940, besides the Violin Concerto, is the one-movement Symphony No. 21 in F-sharp minor, Op. 51, a compact and mostly lyrical work, very different in harmonic language from the Thirteenth.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Despite his personal feelings about the Stalinist regime, Myaskovsky did his best not to engage in overt confrontation with the Soviet state. While some of his works refer to contemporary themes, they do not do so in a programmatic or propagandistic way. The Symphony No. 12 was inspired by a poem about the collectivization of farming, while No. 16 was prompted by the crash of the huge airliner Maxim Gorky and was known under the Soviets as the Aviation Symphony. This symphony, sketched immediately after the disaster and premiered in Moscow on 24 October 1936, includes a big funeral march as its slow movement, and the finale is built on Myaskovsky's own song for the Red Air Force, 'The Aeroplanes are Flying'. The Salutation Overture was dedicated to Stalin on his sixtieth birthday.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The year 1941 saw Myaskovsky evacuated, along with Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian among others, to what were then the Kabardino-Balkar regions. Here he completed the Symphony-Ballade (Symphony No. 22) in B minor, inspired in part by the first few months of the war. Prokofiev's Second String Quartet and Myaskovsky's Symphony No. 23 and Seventh String Quartet contain themes in common—they are Kabardinian folk-tunes the composers took down during their sojourn in the region. The sonata-works (symphonies, quartets, etc.) written after this period and into the post-war years (especially starting with the Symphony No. 24, the piano sonatina, the Ninth Quartet) while Romantic in tone and style, are direct in harmony and development. He does not deny himself a teasingly neurotic scherzo, as in his last two string quartets (that in the Thirteenth Quartet, his last published work, is frantic, and almost chiaroscuro but certainly contrasted) and the general paring down of means usually allows for direct and reasonably intense expression, as with the Cello Concerto (dedicated to and premiered by Sviatoslav Knushevitsky) and Cello Sonata No. 2 (dedicated to Mstislav Rostropovich).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While not particularly experimental, there is no suggestion—as with some earlier works—that Scriabin or Arnold Schoenberg might still be an influence. Some things may work better and some worse in a late style like this. This may have been an attempt to dodge condemnation by the authorities, especially after the Zhdanov Decree. There was no dodging possible, and in 1947 Myaskovsky was singled out, with Shostakovich, Khachaturian and Prokofiev, as one of the principal offenders in writing music of anti-Soviet, 'anti-proletarian' and formalist tendencies. Myaskovsky refused to take part in the proceedings, despite a visit from Tikhon Khrennikov pointedly inviting him to deliver a speech of repentance at the next meeting of the Composers' Union. He was only rehabilitated after his death from cancer in 1950, leaving an output of eighty-seven published opus numbers spanning some forty years and students with recollections. (There is also a recollection in the Volkov book Testimony.)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky was long recognized as an individualist even by the Soviet establishment. In the 1920s the critic Boris Asafyev commented that he was \"not the kind of composer the Revolution would like; he reflects life not through the feelings and spirit of the masses, but through the prism of his personal feelings. He is a sincere and sensible artist, far from 'life's enemy', as he has been portrayed occasionally. He speaks not only for himself, but for many others\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky never married and was shy, sensitive and retiring; Pierre Souvtchinsky believed that a \"brutal youth (in military school and service in the war)\" left him \"a fragile, secretive, introverted man, hiding some mystery within. It was as if his numerous symphonies provide a convenient if not necessary refuge in which he could hide and transpose his soul into sonorities\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Stung by the many accusations in the Soviet press of \"individualism, decadence, pessimism, formalism and complexity\", Myaskovsky wrote to Asafiev in 1940, \"Can it be that the psychological world is so foreign to these people?\" When somebody described Zhdanov's decree against \"formalism\" to him as \"historic\", he is reported to have retorted \"Not historic – hysterical\". Shostakovich, who visited Myaskovsky on his deathbed, described him afterwards to the musicologist Marina Sabinina as \"the most noble, the most modest of men\". Mstislav Rostropovich, for whom Myaskovsky wrote his Second Cello Sonata late in life, described him as \"a humorous man, a sort of real Russian intellectual, who in some ways resembled Turgenev\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As professor of composition at Moscow Conservatory from 1921 until his death, Myaskovsky exercised an important influence on his many pupils. The young Shostakovich considered leaving Leningrad to study with him, and those who did become his students were eventually to include such composers as Aram Khachaturian, Dmitri Kabalevsky, Vissarion Shebalin, Rodion Shchedrin, German Galynin, Andrei Eshpai, Alexei Fedorovich Kozlovsky, Alexander Lokshin, Boris Tchaikovsky, and Evgeny Golubev, a teacher and prolific composer whose students included Alfred Schnittke. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The degree and nature of his influence on his students is difficult to measure. What is lacking is an account of his teaching methods, what and how he taught, or more than brief accounts of his teaching; Shchedrin makes a mention in an interview he did for the American music magazine Fanfare, and that section in Testimony, if authentic, is another. It has been said that the earlier music of Khachaturian, Kabalevsky and other of his students has a Myaskovsky flavor, with this quality decreasing as the composer's own voice emerges (since Myaskovsky's own output is internally diverse such a statement needs further clarification). —while some composers, for instance the little-heard Evgeny Golubev, kept something of his teacher's characteristics well into their later music. The latter's sixth piano sonata is dedicated to Myaskovsky's memory and the early \"Symphony No. 0\" of Golubev's pupil Alfred Schnittke, released on CD in 2007, has striking reminiscences of Myaskovsky's symphonic style and procedures.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Myaskovsky has not been as popular on recordings as have Shostakovich and Prokofiev. Nonetheless, most of his works have been recorded, many of them more than once, including the Cello Concerto, the Violin Concerto, many of the Symphonies, and much of his chamber and solo music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Between 1991 and 1993 the conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov realized a massive project to record Myaskovsky's entire symphonic output and most of his other orchestral works on 16 CDs, with the Symphony Orchestra of the USSR and the State Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation. In the chaotic conditions prevailing at the breakup of the USSR, Svetlanov is rumoured to have had to pay the orchestral musicians himself in order to undertake the sessions. The recordings began to be issued in the West by Olympia Records in 2001, but ceased after volume 10; the remaining volumes were issued by Alto Records starting in the first half of 2008. To complicate matters, in July 2008, Warner Music France issued the entire 16-CD set, boxed, as volume 35 of their 'Édition officielle Evgeny Svetlanov'.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a testimony printed in French and English in the accompanying booklet, Svetlanov describes Myaskovsky as \"the founder of Soviet symphonism, the creator of the Soviet school of composition, the composer whose work has become the bridge between Russian classics and Soviet music ... Myaskovsky entered the history of music as a great toiler like Haydn, Mozart and Schubert. ... He invented his own style, his own intonations and manner while enriching and developing the glorious tradition of Russian music\". Svetlanov also likens the current neglect of Myaskovsky's symphonies to the neglect formerly suffered by the symphonies of Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One of Myaskovsky's strongest early advocates was the conductor Konstantin Saradzhev. He conducted the premieres of Myaskovsky's 8th, 9th and 11th symphonies and the symphonic poem Silence, Op. 9 (which was dedicated to Saradzhev). The 10th Symphony was also dedicated to Saradzhev. In 1934 Myaskovsky wrote a Preludium and Fughetta on the name Saradzhev (for orchestra, Op. 31H; he also arranged it for piano 4-hands, Op. 31J).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1930s, Myaskovsky was also one of two Russian composers championed by Frederick Stock, the conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The other was Reinhold Glière, whom he met in 1940 and commissioned to write his \"Feast in Fergana\", Op. 75, a large-scale orchestral fantasia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Stock met Myaskovsky in March 1938 at the invitation of the Composers Union. He commissioned Myaskovsky's 21st Symphony (Symphony-Fantasy in F-sharp minor) for the Chicago Symphony's Fiftieth Anniversary. The first performance was in Moscow on November 6, 1940 (conducted by Gauk); Stock conducted the Chicago premiere on December 26, 1940.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1950 - Vocalist/guitarist Andy Fairweather Low (of Amen Corner) is born in Ystrad Mynach, Wales, United Kingdom.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mei Lan[/FONT][FONT=&quot] better known by his stage name Mei Lanfang, was one of the most famous Peking opera artists in modern Chinese theater. He was exclusively known for his female lead roles (dan) and particularly his \"verdant-robed .....\" (qingyi), young or middle-aged women of grace and refinement. He was considered one of the \"Four Great Dan\", along with Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xun Huisheng.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mei was born in Beijing in 1894 into a family of Peking opera and Kunqu performers (performers of a traditional Chinese theatre composed of drama, ballet, opera, poetry, and music) of Taizhou, Jiangsu ancestry. He made his stage debut at the Guanghe Theatre in 1905 when he was 11 years old. In his 50-year stage career, he maintained strong continuity while always working on new techniques. His most famous roles were those of female characters; skillful portrayal of women won him international acclaim, and his smooth, perfectly timed, poised style has come to be known in opera circles as the \"Mei School.\" He also played an important part in continuing the performance tradition of Kunqu, noted particularly for his interpretations of Du Liniang ([/FONT]杜丽[FONT=&quot]娘[/FONT][FONT=&quot]; in The Peony Pavilion) and Bái Sùzhēn ([/FONT]白素贞[FONT=&quot]; in Legend of the White Snake) . Mei's famous portrayal of Beauty Yu was so historically moving that Wenting Song say he is one of the greatest vocal artists in modern China.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mei was the first artist to spread Beijing Opera to foreign countries, participating in cultural exchanges with Japan, the United States, and other regions. He toured the world, forming friendships with the western contemporaries of his day, including Charlie Chaplin. In 1930 he toured North America, visiting Hollywood, where he was welcomed by Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. In 1935, Mei toured Europe, playing to appreciative audiences in Berlin and Moscow. Seeing Mei perform especially impressed the German playwright Bertold Brecht and influenced his concept of the alienation effect. He served as one of the mentors and guardians of the actress Li Yuru as she began her career.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and the Imperial Japanese Army soon occupied Beijing. The commander of the Japanese Army ordered Mei to perform for them and appointed Mei to a high rank official position. But Mei refused to sing throughout the duration of the war and endured an impoverished lifestyle until the war ended in 1945.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bust of Méi Lánfāng in Mei Lanfang Memorial Museum in Beijing[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After 1949 he served as director of China Beijing Opera Theater, director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, and vice-chairman of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Besides his autobiography, Forty Years of Life on the Stage, several of his articles and essays have been published in The Collected Works of Mei Lanfang. Recordings of his best-known performances have been published in A Selection of Beijing Operas Performed by Mei Lanfang. In 2000, the story of his life was filmed in a documentary entitled The Worlds of Mei Lanfang.

From 1913 to 1915 Jemnitz lived in Berlin and studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg and began writing articles on music, several of which were published in Die Musik in 1914 and 1915.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Jemnitz returned to Hungary in 1916 and wrote for various newspapers and periodicals. From 1924 to 1950 he was regular music critic of the Népszava newspaper, in which post he established himself as one of the most respected Hungarian critics of the period.

He heard Czech folksongs from time spent at his grandparents' farm as a youth. He started playing the piano aged 5, and composing and conducting aged 10. He began musical studies with Jaroslav Křička, and later teachers included Václav Talich and Rudolf Karel. He became a student at the Prague Conservatory at age 14, as a second-year student, where he studied composition with Vítězslav Novák and Karel Hoffmeister. Later, at Leipzig, he studied with Max Reger, who influenced Weinberger on the use of counterpoint. In September 1922, Weinberger moved to the United States where he took up a position as an instructor at Cornell University. Between 1922 and 1926 he was professor of composition at the Ithaca Conservatory (now the music school of Ithaca College), New York.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When he returned to Czechoslovakia he was appointed director of the National Theater in Bratislava, and later received appointments in Eger, Hungary, and Prague. In 1926 Weinberger completed Schwanda the Bagpiper (Švanda Dudák), which became highly successful, with thousands of performances in hundreds of theatres including the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. His operetta Frühlingsstürme was first performed at the Theatre in Admiralspalast in Berlin on January 19, 1933 with Jarmila Novotná and Richard Tauber in the leading roles. Mary Losseff took over from Novotná in February, but the show was closed down by the Nazi government in March. His subsequent European works include the Passacaglia for orchestra and organ, Six Bohemian Dances for violin and piano, the opera The Outcasts of Poker Flat and a grand oratorio Christmas, though none of them matched the success of Schwanda the Bagpiper.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1939, after extensive travels to the United States, Bratislava and Vienna, he left Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis and settled in New York state, teaching there and in Ohio. He wrote a number of works on commission from American orchestras. He became an American citizen in 1948.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During the 1950s, Weinberger moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. In later life, he developed cancer of the brain. This, together with money worries and the neglect of his music, prompted him to take a lethal sedative overdose in August 1967. His wife, Hansi Lemberger Weinberger (also known as Jane), died on July 31, 1968.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2004 Czech pianist Tomáš Víšek and cellist František Brikcius organized a tour celebrating Weinberger's work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weinberger composed over 100 works, including operas, operettas, choral works, and works for orchestra. However, the only one which is still performed is the opera Schwanda the Bagpiper (Švanda dudák), a worldwide success after its première in 1927. The opera is still performed occasionally, and the Polka and Fugue from it is often heard in a concert version. The artists of the Walt Disney studio considered making it into a segment for Fantasia 2000, but instead chose Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F major, in the form of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Weinberger used a varied musical language. His studies in Prague and Leipzig stressed formal control and contrapuntal mastery; following the example of his teachers, Křička, Novák and Reger, Weinberger's works exhibit control, but are also playful. This combination received both praise and criticism.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1968 - Huey Morgan (US singer, guitarist; Fun Lovin' Criminals) is born.\n\nin 1969 - Faye Wong (Hong Kong singer, actress) is born.\n\nin 1969 - The photo session for the cover of The Beatles 'Abbey Road' album took place on the crossing outside Abbey Road studios.

Johnson and, for the last half-century, by Ralph Sutton. Stride playing, as titles like \"Fingerbuster\" might suggest, requires such rare skill that its practitioners are few and their work much savoured.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The development of the \"stride\" style came from the earlier and mechanical sound of ragtime. Stride, much more sophisticated, added that intangible jazz element swing, and was notable for rocking and driving bass figures from the left hand. Because of an early misconception, Swift unwittingly drove himself to a unique accomplishment.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The original stride pianists recorded on to metal cylinders from which piano rolls were made. Disciples learnt by playing the rolls on a player piano. The production of the original cylinders involved powdering the hammers of the piano. When the pianist played the cylinder revolved and was hit by the hammers, each leaving an accurate powdered mark. Afterwards a hole was drilled on each mark leaving a replica of what had been played. From this the final parchment rolls could be made for distribution.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]What Swift and his contemporaries didn't know was that the mechanics who made the cylinders embellished them by drilling in extra holes afterwards, thus adding more notes and making an already complex performance potentially impossible to emulate. Somehow Swift managed to overcome this with an awe-inspiring accuracy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Most of the giant stride players had died by the time Swift was born in 1943. He had a classical training that brought him two diplomas and a degree at the Birmingham School of Music. He began playing jazz early, and by the time he was 14 was already working on jobs with local bands. He joined the Jazz Hounds in Rotherham and then took up trombone so that he could play with Mike Taylor's Jazz Band. He moved with his family to the Midlands in 1960 and played with the trumpeter Jim Simpson's band from 1961 to 1962.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Simpson, later editor of a jazz magazine, a concert promoter and organiser of the Birmingham Jazz Festival, was able to play a potent part in Swift's career. He provided the pianist with a multitude of concert opportunities and, in 1988 and 1991, recorded recitals by him which appeared as compact discs on Simpson's Big Bear label. These, respectively called Out Looking for the Lion and The Broadwood Concert, caused an admiring stir in both the jazz and national press.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After he left Simpson's band, Swift played in the Bill Niles Jazz Band. He kept his jazz career going while teaching music in schools from 1968 until 1978. He formed his own band, the New Delta Jazzmen, in 1974 until, after having worked in the band led by the trumpeter Kenny Ball on many occasions, he finally joined it in 1977 and stayed for six years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Tired of life on the road, he bought a pub at Bewdley in Worcestershire in 1983 and ran it until 1987, when he returned to music full-time. He joined the Pete Allen band and stayed there until he left in September 1989 to become exclusively a solo pianist. In this role he played at many concerts and festivals, occasionally working as a featured player with Paul Munnery's Harlem and with the Harlem Hot Five. Surgery on his back forced him away from music for a year from 1990 to late 1991.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He made a rare appearance on trombone with King Pleasure's band and from December 1993, despite declining health, he was featured in touring shows with the John Patters band. He introduced his own compact disc label to issue his final album in 1993 under the title The Key of D is Daffodil Yellow. It was a skilled mixture of original tunes and standards with some of his notable interpretations of the music of Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His eloquent and spectacular playing led to his being much featured in the various media and he made about 70 radio and 130 television broadcasts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1998 - The Spice ..... had the UK No.1 single with 'Viva Forever', their 7th UK chart topper.

Before embarking on a career in music, he served in the United States Marines. In 1953, he made his first record for Sheraton Records in Boston, Massachusetts, but he did not immediately pursue a full-time career in music, instead choosing to study at Memphis State University from 1953 to 1955.

In 1956 he was part of one of the seminal events in rock and roll history when he went to work as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. There, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash.

She had appeared in many sangeet nataks (musical play) where she played various roles. Along with singing for the roles she played, she had also composed music for some. In the career span of over 50 years, she has appeared in more than 4500 shows. She was married to co-actor singer Jayram Shiledar along with whom she had established a production banner of \"Marathi Rangabhoomi\". The pair together is credited for revamping the Marathi music industry. She was presented with Padma Shri award in 2013. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shiledar started her acting and musical career with her first stage performance in 1942 in the Marathi play Veshantar. In 1945, she played the lead title role of Sharada in the sangeet natak Sangeet Sharada alongside Bal Gandharva. Gandharva had himself played the role before, when female roles were also played by men. A protege of Bal Gandharva, Shiledar was a renowned performer and drew a packed house for her performances. Jaymala had made her debut in Marathi theatre at the age of 16 and later acted in over 50 plays. She performed over 52 different roles in 46 dramas in a career. She had presided over the 83rd Marathi Natya Sammelan.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2006, she was presented with the Lata Mangeshkar Award, instituted by Government of Maharashtra. She was conferred with the Padma Shri in 2013. At the time, she had said of the honour: \"It is was not an individual recognition, but that of Marathi musical theatre. I am overwhelmed by the honour. It is the acknowledgment of my contribution to theatre and I feel happy because the recognition has come from the Union Government. I consider this a national recognition of Marathi theatre.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Personal life[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shiledar was born Pramila Jadhav on 21 August 1926 at Indore, then part of Central India Agency but now in the Madhya Pradesh state of India.

Post these operations, it was not possible for her to sing or even speak for long duration. She suffered renal failure as well as symptoms of cardiac failure in Pune after a prolonged illness and died on 8 August 2013. A large number of people who are associated with theatre and other fields paid tributes to her at Bharat Natya Mandir and Tilak Smarak Mandir where her mortal remains were kept.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 &#8211; Regina Resnik, a Bronx-born opera star who sang more than 300 performances at the Metropolitan Opera and who made the shift from soprano to mezzo-soprano in the middle of her career, dies in Manhattan. She was 90.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The cause was complications of a stroke, said her son, Michael Philip Davis.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Resnik made her Met debut in 1944 as Leonora in &#8220;Il Trovatore&#8221; and over the years performed many of opera&#8217;s most important roles on its most prominent stages, including those of the New York City Opera, the San Francisco Opera, Covent Garden and other European houses.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her best-known roles include Ellen Orford in Britten&#8217;s &#8220;Peter Grimes,&#8221; Donna Anna and Donna Elvira in Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Don Giovanni&#8221; and the title role in Bizet&#8217;s &#8220;Carmen.&#8221; Later in her career she performed in musical theater and became a sought-after instructor and opera director.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She was known for her strong dramatic skills and impeccable musicianship onstage and for her bold personality offstage. She displayed fearlessness from the beginning.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1942, she made her debut at the New Opera Company of New York after being given 24 hours&#8217; notice that she was needed to substitute. Two years later, she made a similar last-minute substitution in her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Leonora, the starring role in &#8220;Il Trovatore.&#8221; Each time she impressed.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;All things considered, Miss Resnik&#8217;s debut was an auspicious one,&#8221; a review of her Metropolitan debut in The New York Times said. &#8220;She has a strong, clear soprano, which, though occasionally marred by a tremolo, is both agile enough for the florid passages allotted to Leonora and forceful enough for the dramatic ones.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Resnik became a much-admired soprano and toured widely through the mid-1950s, when she and others began to notice that her voice was darkening. A friend, the baritone Giuseppe Danise, helped persuade her to change, telling her he believed she had always been a mezzo.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;It was the biggest gamble of my life, when I decided over two tumultuous years that perhaps I was not a soprano after all,&#8221; she told The Times in 1967. &#8220;There were many opinions: I was a soprano with low notes, or mezzo with high notes.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The gamble paid off, she said, and it ultimately provided her with better roles, including some of her most notable, as Carmen, Klytemnestra in &#8220;Elektra,&#8221; Mistress Quickly in &#8220;Falstaff&#8221; and the Countess in &#8220;Queen of Spades.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;I have really run the gamut,&#8221; she added, emphatic that she had not lost her upper register. &#8220;And my range is exactly the same today. Not one note higher or lower. But I was happier in the depth of my voice than in its height.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Regina Resnick was born on Aug. 30, 1922. Her parents, Sam and Ruth Resnick, emigrated from Russia. Ms. Resnik, who dropped the c in her surname before she began performing, recalled her father as having a sweet tenor &#8212; he liked to sing Italian arias and songs in Russian &#8212; but said she was unsure where or why she knew she could sing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In junior high school, when a teacher once asked if someone could sing &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#8221; Ms. Resnik volunteered. Then as later, critics were impressed.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ms. Resnik graduated from James Monroe High School in the Bronx and studied music education at Hunter College, graduating in 1942.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In addition to her son, she is survived by a brother, Jack H. Resnick. Her first marriage, to Harry W. Davis, a lawyer and judge, ended in divorce. Her second husband, the artist and designer Arbit Blatas, with whom she collaborated on several opera productions, died in 1999.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;She was a totally American original,&#8221; said F. Paul Driscoll, the editor in chief of Opera News. &#8220;She was always very proud of being educated in the United States and beginning her career in the United States.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr. Driscoll emphasized Ms. Resnik&#8217;s resilience, particularly under Rudolf Bing, the sometimes autocratic general manager of the Met, for much of her career.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;She embraced the opportunities she was given, and whether or not Mr. Bing thought they were star parts, she made them star parts,&#8221; Mr. Driscoll said. &#8220;Directors loved her, conductors loved her, and the audience loved her.&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On at least one occasion, however, she boldly took an unruly section of an audience to task.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]&#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; Ms. Resnik shouted from the stage in French as hecklers interrupted a performance of &#8220;Carmen&#8221; in Marseilles in 1962.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]They had hooted and howled and hurled vegetables toward her and her co-star, Richard Martell, who, in the role of Don Jose, had just finishing professing his love for her. Ms. Resnik&#8217;s defiance prompted cheers from the rest of the audience, and a clarification from the hecklers that Mr. Martell was their target.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Yet when they proceeded to heckle more, Ms. Resnik glared long and hard toward their place in the balcony and then erupted with a single powerful &#8220;Silence!&#8221;[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Silence is what largely ensued, at least until the performance was over, when bunches of radishes struck the drawn red curtain.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 &#8211; Albert Eli \"Al\" Coury, Arab-American 1970s vice-president of American record label Capitol Records. He joined the label in 1957 and rose to the position of vice-president of marketing, sales and promotion, dies at the age of 78 in Thousand Oaks, California, from complications of a stroke.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Coury helped develop the careers of many recording artists, including The Beatles, Nat King Cole, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, Glen Campbell, Bob Seger, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Don Henley, Cher and Linda Ronstadt.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Coury was important to several solo Beatles releases in the 1970s, particularly Paul McCartney's 1973 album Band On The Run, and John Lennon's 1974 album Walls and Bridges, both of which reached the top of the charts and yielded #1 singles. It was Coury who persuaded McCartney to include the successful single \"Helen Wheels\" on the US version of Band On The Run (because it was last-minute, the lyrics to the song were not included on the lyric sheet). He then chose the song \"Jet\" as the second single, which helped make the album the most successful of McCartney's solo efforts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The following year, Lennon invited Coury to \"work his magic\" promoting Lennon's Walls and Bridges album. It was Coury who chose the first single, \"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\", which became Lennon's first #1 solo hit (and the only one in his lifetime). Coury was also instrumental in the long-awaited release of Lennon's 1975 album Rock 'n' Roll, bartering with producer Phil Spector to retrieve the master tapes from their abandoned 1973 recording sessions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Coury's last signing to Capitol Records was the group Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart, made up of former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, and songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, who'd written several Monkees hits. He then left Capitol to become president and co-founder of RSO Records, with Robert Stigwood. At RSO, Coury marketed such hits as the Saturday Night Fever and Grease soundtrack albums, and Eric Clapton's Slowhand. Coury worked extensively with the Bee Gees, RSO's flagship group.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1980, Coury created a new record label, Network Records. One of the label's initial successes was the soundtrack to the movie Flashdance. The song \"What a Feeling\" won a Grammy Award and an Oscar for Song of the Year in 1984. Another was Del Shannon's Drop Down And Get Me album produced by Tom Petty and featuring the hit single Sea Of Love.In 1985, Network Records merged with Geffen Records, and Coury became Geffen's general manager, launching hit records for Guns & Roses, Aerosmith, Peter Gabriel and Don Henley.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Coury was married to children's book author and artist Tina Nichols Coury and had two children, Kacy and Albert Coury, Jr. He retired from the record business in 1994.

In 1953, he made his first record for the Sheraton label in Boston, Massachusetts, but did not immediately pursue a full-time career in music, instead choosing to study at Memphis State University from 1953 to 1955. Nicknamed \"Cowboy\" Jack Clement, during his student days he played steel guitar with a local band. In 1956 became part of one of the seminal events in rock and roll history when he went to work as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. There, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. But most importantly, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida (one of those recordings, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\", was selected in 2005 for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1957, Clement wrote the song \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\", which became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included \"Guess Things Happen That Way\", which was #1 country and #11 pop in 1958, and the humorous \"The One on the Right Is on the Left\", which was a #2 country and #46 pop hit in 1966. He produced Cash's #1 hit \"Ring of Fire\" in 1963.[1] Clement performed \"Guess Things Happen That Way\" on the Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute show on CMT in November 2003.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1958 Clement released the single \"Ten Years\", which was covered by Johnny Western (1959) Rex Allen (1962) and Roger Mews.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1959, Clement accepted an offer to work as a producer at RCA in Nashville, then the most important label in the industry. In 1961, he moved to Beaumont, Texas, joining producer and publisher Bill Hall in opening Gulf Coast Recording Studio and the Hall-Clement publishing company. He returned to Nashville permanently in 1965, becoming a significant figure in the country music business, establishing a publishing business, and his own recording studio, making records for stars such as Charley Pride and Ray Stevens. In 1971, he co-founded the J-M-I Record Company.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Clement wrote a number of highly successful songs that have been recorded by singing stars such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, Bobby Bare, Elvis Presley, Jim Reeves, Jerry Lee Lewis, Cliff Richard (\"It'll Be Me\"), Charley Pride, Tom Jones, Dickey Lee and Hank Snow. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1973. He also produced albums by Townes Van Zandt and Waylon Jennings.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Clement was involved in a few film projects as a singer or songwriter on soundtracks, and he produced the 1975 horror film Dear Dead Delilah, the last film performance by actress Agnes Moorehead.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1987, Clement was approached by U2 to record at Sun Studio in Memphis. He had never heard of U2 but took the session based on the urging of someone else in his office. The result was a portion of the U2 album Rattle and Hum (\"When Love Comes to Town\", with BB King; \"Angel of Harlem\", a tribute to Billie Holiday; and \"Love Rescue Me\", with backing vocals by Bob Dylan), as well as the Woody Guthrie song \"Jesus Christ\", which was included on the 1988 album Folkways: A Vision Shared&#8212;A Tribute to Woody Guthrie & Leadbelly. Portions of the two sessions also appear in the film Rattle and Hum.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2005, a documentary about Clement, Shakespeare Was a Big George Jones Fan, was created by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville, pieced together from Clement's home videos and interviews with peers, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Bono. Clement hosted a weekly program on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. Clement was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Music City Walk of Fame.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On June 25, 2011, a fire destroyed his home and studio on Belmont Boulevard in Nashville.

Much of his music resulted from an interest in the music of Australia's neighbours as well as from the impulse to bring together aspects of native Australian music with that of the heritage of the West. He was known primarily for his orchestral and chamber music, such as Kakadu (1988) and Earth Cry (1986), which evoke the sounds and feeling of the Australian bushland and outback. He also wrote 18 string quartets, using unusual timbral effects, works for piano, and two operas. He stated that he wanted his music to make people feel better and happier for having listened to it. He typically avoided the dense, atonal techniques of many of his contemporary composers. His work was often distinguished by its distinctive use of percussion.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sculthorpe was born and raised in Launceston, Tasmania. His mother, Edna, was passionate about English literature and was the first woman to hold a driver's licence in Tasmania; and his father, Joshua, loved fishing and nature. He was educated at the Launceston Church Grammar School.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He began writing music at the age of seven or eight, after having his first piano lesson, continuing in secret when his piano teacher punished him for this activity. By the age of 14, he had decided to make a career of music, despite many (especially his father) encouraging him to enter different fields, because he felt the music he wrote was the only thing that was his own. In his early teens he attempted to learn composition through studying Ernst Krenek's Studies in Counterpoint &#8211; \"a pretty dreadful book\" as he later described it. He studied at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music from 1946 to 1950, then returned to Tasmania. Unable to make any money as a composer, he went into business, running a hunting, shooting and fishing store in Launceston (Sculthorpe's) with h"
