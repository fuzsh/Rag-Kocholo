Dr. Johnson hit off his situation once for all with the disdainful remark, \"Sir, he is one of the many who have made them- selves public without making themselves known.\" Kendrick was in fact a nuisance, a sort of Grub Street porcupine whose quills tormented Fielding, Goldsmith, John- son, and Garrick in turn. (It is, indeed, amusingly apt that for some time he was identified with a pamphleteer who wrote under the name of \"Porcupine Pelagius.\") Yet, while his feuds with the great make up his chief claim to attention, his career is not without interest for its own sake. For six years He was leading writer on the Monthly Review, one of the important periodicals of the day ; and he later edited his own, the London Review. He was an able Shakespeare student, and unusually well versed in languages. He knew a good deal about mathematics and natural philosophy, had two university doctorates, and might have be- come a figure noted, not notorious, if he could have kept his temper. The Library, which already possessed two Kenrick manuscripts and a number of his varied publications, has now received from Mr. George E. Brewer, Jr., of Ipswich, Massachusetts, eight of the rarer items, together with a penetrating study of Kenrick by Mr. Brewer himself. This essay, still in typescript, is the first full-length portrait of the journalist. Based on thorough research in both English and American collections, the paper throws much light on the group of pamphlets which the author has given to the Library. The earliest of these is a youthful Monody on the death of Frederick, prince of Wales, written in 1751, followed the next year by Fun: A Parodi-tragi-comical Satire. Then comes a series of reflective poems, Epistles Philosophical and Moral (1759). There are also three plays, The Widow'd Wife (1767), The Duellist (1773), and the first and third editions of The Lady of the Manor (iyyS). The list closes with Love in the Suds and A Letter to Mr. David Garrick, the outstand- ing documents in Kenrick's famous encounter with \"the English Roscius\" in 1772. Kenrick was born near Watford about 1730, and was apprenticed early in life to a maker of brass rules — a trade too nearly akin to the critic's art to escape his enemies' notice later. But he was far too clever to be kept long at such humdrum employment. Already at eighteen he was trying his hand at verses — verses which show that the venom of his after years was not entirely |t, 39, :3i j«\".t73 3 4 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN due to a hostile fate. For instance, the following epigram appears in the Gentleman's Magazine for May 1748, written \"at the desire of Mr. Thompson, on the Death of his Monkey\" : What, tho' no marble bears dead Mackey's name, Nor gilded characters his worth proclaim ; His witness still (if witness monkeys have) May long survive, nor find with him a grave ; His master yet his monument we see, For Mackey lives, O Thompson ! lives in thee. This sort of thing was not calculated to endear the author to Mr. Thompson or anyone else. An equally caustic vein was apparent in a rhymed satire, The Town, which he published about the same time. But for the next decade he managed to support himself by various literary odd jobs. From August to December 1750 he edited a miscellany of prose and verse called The Kapelion, or Poetical Ordinary. The following year, being in dire need of patronage, he produced his Monody on the death of the prince of Wales. It is only a string of platitudes ; the most servile poet must have struggled to find an honest com- pliment for the prince's unamiable character. But the book was dedicated to the Countess of Middlesex, and probably brought Kenrick some favor at court. Besides this, he found relaxation in writing for private performance a comedy called Falstaff's Wedding. At twenty-one he was still, as he confessed afterward, \"young and giddy enough to amuse himself in a stuffed doublet . . . with an attempt at personal representation of the humors of Sir John Falstaff.\" Of course he took the star part ; nevertheless, he must have done it with some ?kill, for many years afterward, when he lectured on Henry IV, the London Chronicle remarked that the stage had suffered a loss. But though this little comedy was to have some important consequences, it was not published until years later; meanwhile Kenrick could not live on the proceeds of private theatricals. About April 1751, Mr. Brewer believes, he became editor of a newspaper called Old England, formerly supported by Chesterfield. Taking the pseudonym of \"Jonathan Free,\" he pranced forth in search of a target, and soon found one in Henry Fielding, who was conducting the Covent Garden Journal under the name of Sir Alexander Drawcansir. Un- fortunately Fielding — like most of Kenrick's adversaries — refused to be drawn, and Kenrick had to work out his malice in Fun, a burlesque on the so called \"paper warfare\" which had recently been going on between Fielding, Smollett, and others. Fielding (who had the unfair advantage of being a magistrate) had the performance broken up by the police, but Kenrick pub- lished the script. Almost simultaneously — so checkered is the life of a hack writer — he produced a little volume entitled The Whole Duty of Woman, one of those manuals for the improvement of the female mind which enjoyed such popularity at the time. The Library has several editions of this work. For sheer smugness it would be hard to match even in that pious generation. \"Behold the child of innocence ! how lovely is the mildness of her countenance ! how charming the diffidence of her manners ! She is fair as the lily,\" runs the chapter on Modesty. And this from William Kenrick! After this publication Kenrick drops out of sight for a while. Mr. Brewer DOCTOR KENRICK OF GRUB STREET 5 conjectures that he spent some of the time in prison for debt, and the rest (about three years) in seclusion on the Continent. His Epistles to Lorenzo came out anonymously in 1756, later to be expanded into the Epistles Philosophi- cal and Moral. It was in 1759 that he really embarked on his career. When, in January, he succeeded Goldsmith cn Ralph Griffiths' Monthly Review, he had the makings of a good editor, for he had read widely, and was well acquainted with French, Dutch, and German as a result of his stay on the Continent. Commenting on Griffiths' marked copy of the magazine, now in the Bodleian Library, Mr. Brewer remarks, \"The general accuracy with which Kenrick wrote is clearly at- tested by the fact that Griffiths has made almost no corrections in the articles for which Kenrick is responsible.\" The appendices of Volumes XXVIII-XXX- III, devoted to foreign books, were almost entirely his; after his departure from the office the appendix was written by not one man but six. Kenrick was perfectly aware of his own talents. It is not surprising that, overwhelmed by this mountain of work and chained to his desk by ab- solute need, he took out his spleen on the more fortunate writers whose books he was given to criticize. Within the year he printed a blistering review of Goldsmith's Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe. It was not the last article of his for which Griffiths, the editor, had to make amends. But Kenrick's major offense was one of lese-majestc against the great Doctor Johnson. IN 1761 Kenrick had published an anonymous translation of Rousseau's Nouvelle Hcloise, so universally praised that he soon followed it with an English edition of Emile. Seeing his way to an independent name as a scholar, he drafted some proposals for a critical edition of Shakespeare. The manuscript draft is now in the Boston Public Library. He planned a completely new text, \"illustrated by a critical review of each play, with remarks on the most beautiful and explanations of the most difficult passages; to which will be prefixed an enquiry into the life and writings of that incomparable Bard ; also an essay on the laws of the drama; in which his neglect of the artificial unities is defended against the objections of Voltaire and other critics . . . To be embellished with a head of Shakespeare, after the manner of Rembrandt by Worlidge, together with a frontispiece to each volume, exhibiting some favorite scenes as represented by capital performers: taken from the designs of eminent artists.\" Considering Kenrick's turn of mind, it is a little hard to credit his assertion that \"the endeavours of the present editor will be solely directed to ascertain and elucidate the genuine text of the author, without troubling the reader with tedious detections of the mistakes and prolix con- futations of the conjectures of preceding commentators.\" But his mood may have been softened by the generous reception of Eloisa and Entile. At any rate, he had got so far as to plan die publication of his first volume, price a quarter guinea, \"at Chrismas next,\" when die blow fell which ruined his whole undertaking. It is possible that, had events been otherwise, Kenrick might have become a respectable member of society, perhaps even hobnohbed at \"The Club\" with Gar- rick and Goldsmith. Unfortunately for him, Samuel Johnson chose the year 1765, after long delay, to issue his own edition of Shakespeare. The disappointment was too much. Kenrick promptly published A Reviezv of Doctor Johnson's New 6 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN Edition of Shakespeare: in which the ignorance, or inattention, of that editor is ex- posed, and the poet defended from the persecution of his commentators. The first half (the second was never completed) contains 138 detailed pages, condemn- ing at once Dr. Johnson's editing, emendations, and critical comments. From the academic viewpoint, much of the criticism is sound ; but Kenrick made the attack a personal one, and included an insulting caricature of Johnson : \"Gradu- ated by universities, pensioned by his prince, and surrounded by pedagogues and poetasters, he finds a grateful odour in the incense of adulation, while admiring booksellers stand at a distance, and look up to him with awful reverence, bow- ing the knee to Baal.\" He signed the review openly, and literary London became one uproar. An Oxford student named Barclay wrote an unsigned essay in Johnson's de- fense, and Griffiths, with whom Kenrick speedily parted, assailed his own underling's work in the Monthly Revie7v, advising him to \"humanely condescend to lay by his tomahawk.\" Johnson himself affected to ignore the hurly-burly, but his lofty scorn was evidently a little overdone, for on April 12, 1766, we find Garrick writing to George Colma-n from Bath, \"Who wrote the answer to Kenrick's Review? Johnson sent it me, through Steevens, last week; but mum, it is not quite the thing; by Johnson's fondness for it, he must have felt Kenrick. What things we are! and how little are we known!\" Kenrick was now well on the way to being \"the enemy of every decent and successful person,\" as the Dictionary of National Biography unkindly de- scribes him. For a few months he planned to continue his Shakespeare edi- tion, but was again forestalled, this time by George Stevens, who had a prior agreement both with Tonson, the publisher, and with Garrick. That Kenrick was furious with the latter is obvious enough from comments he made eight years later. But in 1766 he was obliged to remain on good terms with him, for Drury Lane had undertaken to produce Falstaff's Wedding. The Library has several editions of this play. The first version, published in January 1766, bears the imprint of 1760, but according to Kenrick's preface remained six years in the warehouse. It is preceded by a dedication to the distinguished actor James Quin, \"in return for the frequent pleasure received by his repre- sentation of the character of Sir John Falstaff.\" Quin died on January 21, and the dedication is lacking in later editions. The play was given on April 12, for James Love's benefit night, Love taking the part of Falstaff. The acting version, which is also in the Library, is much altered. The parts of the king and courtiers have been omitted, and the scenes are somewhat rearranged. Dr. Caius has been resurrected from the Merry Wives — perhaps for the sake of Mr. Baddeley, an actor who was re- puted to play foreign footmen well, having begun his career as a cook! The early plot, in which Falstaff saves the king from assassination, is abandoned in favor of a comic disguise motif, in which Nym plans to marry Dame Quickly and Dol Tear- sheet to Shallow and Slender, and Falstaff instead contrives to marry the two to Pistol and Nym. The play is genuinely amusing, and was well received; but it ran only one night, and was not revived, in spite of Kenrick's efforts, until 1803. On December 5, 1767, Kenrick made another attempt at Drury Lane with a fashionable comedy, The Widow'd Wife. This did better than Falstaff, for Falstaff's Wedding : A COMEDY.

Titls-fage from Original in the Boston Public Library Facsimile in the Same Size 7 DOCTOR KENRICK OF GRUB STREET 9 it ran fourteen nights, and was repeated once the following season. Its plot is fairly ingenious, with a good deal of satire on Bath society, and its success was well merited. But poor Kenrick never achieved success without un- pleasantness. The difficulties which he had already had with Garrick over Falstaff's Wedding were renewed on this occasion, and a disagreement over money matters laid the foundation for a much more serious quarrel. In the next five years Kenrick tried his hand at nearly everything — lectures on perpetual motion, translations, and an original pamphlet, Free Thoughts on Seduction, Adultery, and Divorce. About this time, too, he tried to sell an opera, probably The Lady of the Manor, to his old foe George Colman, manager at Covent Garden. The Library has one of Kenrick's letters on the subject, published in Peake's Memoirs of the Colman Family (1841). It is a rather amusing combination of contempt for such trivial ventures and a poorly-concealed desire to sell the piece at almost any price. Colman's courte- ously vague but discouraging reply, dated March 25, 1771, appears on the reverse of the sheet. The opera had been tentatively scheduled for per- formance in 1773, but Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer was presented in- stead, and Kenrick's piece appeared only in 1778, with scant applause. Be- sides the two editions of the libretto given by Mr. Brewer, the Library has the complete score, with Kenrick's words and the music composed by James Hook. This was apparently also published in 1778, though the title-page bears no date. BY 1772 Kenrick was thoroughly bitter and disillusioned. It must have been like wine to his wounded egotism when, on February 27, he re- ceived the degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Aberdeen. But, sad to relate, it went to his head. Back in March 1770 he had approached Garrick with a new play, but had been put off, as happened again in the following spring. Then he sug- gested a revival of Falstaff's Wedding. In June 1772 he asked for \"a speedy and explicit\" answer. Garrick lost his temper with the importunate play- wright and demanded a personal interview ; but Kenrick, who somehow got the notion that Garrick intended to give him a thrashing, failed to appear. Garrick then wrote him as follows : \"I am really sorry for the figure you have made in the late transaction with me. Could you not have finished a little better for the sake of that honour which so readily drops from your pen? . . . No, Sir; I would have honoured you by giving the satisfaction of a gentleman, if you could (as Shakspeare says) have screwed your courage to the sticking place, to have taken it . . . I am, Sir, with a proper contempt for all you can scribble, D. Garrick.\" Having thus haughtily wiped his pen, he seized it again for a postscript: \"May every enemy I have, whether open or. secret, be- have as you have done ! There can be but one answer given to your falsehood and malignity, which may be as speedy as you please : I will take care that it is explicit.\" Fortunately for his dignity, the irate Roscius thought better of it. The letter is endorsed, \"N.B. This not sent to the scoundrel Dr. Kenrick.\" Kenrick retaliated by publishing Love in the Suds, being the Lamentation of Roscius for the Loss of his Nyky. It ran through five editions in a month ; the Library has both the fourth and the fifth. The poem, written in heroic 10 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN couplets, is a satire on Garrick's patronage of Isaac Bickerstaffe, a playwright who had formerly been dismissed from the marines on scandalous charges. The work involved no direct accusation of Garrick, but it made him ridiculous. The method, however, was a costly one for Kenrick. The papers were full of Garrick's side of the affair, and the public bitterly resented the slur on its idol. In self-defense, Kenrick published A Letter to David Garrick, charging him with snobbery and avarice, and continuing: \"It is indeed a kind of insolence and impertinence in the modern great, many of whom have risen from the dregs of the people and more of whom are as void of literature as urbanity, to expect the gratuitous attendance of either a man of genius, or science, or erudition.\" In the following pages, he went into the whole history of his relations with Garrick : the delays over Falstaff's Wedding, the fees for The Widow'd Wife, and the prolonged wrangle of the last two years. Kenrick was damned socially and professionally. Under threat of a libel suit, he swallowed his words in a letter to the .S7. James Chronicle; but the damage to himself was past repair. The rest of his life consisted of a series of attempts to achieve literary eminence, all more or less failures. In March I773- f°r instance, he published A New Dictionary of the English Language, prefaced by an original \"Rhetorical Grammar\" on the elements of speech and English pronunciation. He set himself up for a philologist, and indeed his dictionary was the first to indicate pronunciation; otherwise it was by no means remarkable. In November The Duellist was staged for one night at Covent Garden; but the announcement of its repetition caused a near-riot — whether because of its quality or because of a quarrel between Colman and Macklin, one of the actors, is still uncertain. In January 1774 Kenrick started a series of fifteen lectures under the title \"The School of Shakespeare.\" In these his knowledge of Shakespeare came profitably into play, and he added a novel ingredient by his lively recitation of various disputed passages, thus affording his audience both instruction and entertainment. He abandoned this scheme abruptly, and on August 20 advertised his proposals for a sub- scription academy \"for the Investigation of the English Language, and the illustration of British Literature.\" That too evaporated. In 1775 he fulfilled his life's ambition by founding a magazine of his own, the London Review. It was a moderate success, in spite of the enemies made by its harshness. But Kenrick was not to enjoy independence for long. He was grieveously beset by that affliction of most eighteenth-century gentlemen, the gout, aggravated by heavy drinking and probably also by overwork. He died on June 10, 1779, at the age of forty-nine. \"Few persons,\" wrote the dramatic critic Isaac Reed, \"dropped into the grave so little regretted by their contemporaries.\" It is a melancholy epitaph ; but nevertheless William Ken- rick made an indelible mark on his time. HONOR McCUSKER Letters by T. W. Parsons (Continued from the October, November, and December issues) The Good of Intellect ONE of the finest friendships Parsons had was that with Professor Ben- jamin Peirce. He had a warm affection for the scientist, ten years his senior. In a letter of May 6, 1877, he was writing to his wife: \"I purpose to come to town the day after you return, that is to say on Thursday, and I should like to have Professor Peirce dine with us on FYiday or Saturday. Shall you see him? If so please to find out if such an arrangement may suit with his convenience. I have been somewhat dull today, and fancy that I need the stimulus of his talk and delightful companionship to decorticate myself of dulness . . .\" That the sentiment was not one-sided may be seen from a letter by Peirce, now in Mr. Goodspeed's possession. \"My very dear friend and darling poet,\" the letter begins, and closes with \"Your devoted friend.\" It is worth quoting here in full : Do you know that by a stroke of your pen, you rejoiced two hearts, one of your friend and ever devoted loving geometer, and the other that of a sweet admirer of all your poetry. She has not yet written, be- cause I suppose she cannot command a large, enough army of words to write anything fit to be sent to a poet. I send all my epistles to you in fear and trembling, notwithstanding I am fully alive to the greatness of your generosity which is so ready to overlook my awkward phrases. I have not written you for a very long time — and have been daily pro- posing to write — tomorrow morning — in the evening — but old age has paralysed me, and all the doctors in the world can never cure me. Inwards ill of old age! You will never know that disease. You have dipped in the fountain of perpetual youth and must sing like the nightin- gale till your last swan song, I wish I could see you again, and go with you to the gentle butter fingered woman, who seems to be sharing the public admiration with Wagner and Sankey. There is no more Italy in the capital of New England — we are all sputtering German — and raving over discords and greasing the hub of the wheel with the nicest Vermont butter. You must let your beard grow before you venture to Boston and talk as thick as a Dutchman's skull — and accent your Shakespeare — so that you may be mistaken for one of the sublime objective idealities of the Kingdom of Bismarck. - The letter is dated October 17, 1877. It was in the spring of that year that the great Wagner Festival was held in the Boston Theatre ; while in the Tabernacle built between Tremont Street and Warren Avenue, Moody and Sankey were conducting their revivalist meetings. Ira D. Sankey, with his strong emotional baritone, had his full share of appreciation on these memor- able occasions. The further allusion to \"the gentle butter fingered woman,\" 11 12 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN to whom Professor Peirce unfortunately could not go, was in all probability Miss Heller. According to the advertisements, she was then nightly ap- pearing at Horticultural Hall in \"seemingly miraculous performances, in- cluding the Second Sight Mystery and startling Spiritualistic Illustrations.\" It was to Peirce that Parsons addressed his poem \"Ben Dell* Intelletto.\" Taking his motto from the XVth Canto of the Purgatorio, \"E stupor m'eran le cose non conte,\" he wrote : Whenever Good of Intellect comes in, Then peace is with us, and a soft control Of all harsh thinking; and but one desire Fills every boso:/'., — to forget the din Of outside things, and render up the soul To friendship's banquet by an evening fire. Then is the season in this world of sin That brings new strength, and keepeth us heart-whole Amid the changes that distress and tire; And when from wisdom we have wanderers been, So that a stupor on the spirit stole From things unknown, with visions dark and dire, In this high presence we restore ourselves More than by all the volumes on our shelves. Deeply touched, Peirce thanked him for the tribute in this note of March 26, 1879: Between two such delicious fruits how is it possible to choose? A luscious peach and a delicious pear are both equally acceptable to me, each at its season. But just now, I must say that my heart is peculiarly open to the sweetness of the Ben Intelletto — and that of all the com- pliments which I have ever received this is the most grateful to me, and none the less so because I feel it to rise so high above my poor deserts. It is an earthly geometer raised to the skies by an angelic poet. Benjamin Peirce died in 1880, at the age of seventy-one. In the following vear a small memorial volume was published in Cambridge which contains the \"Ben dell' Intelletto*' as well as another sonnet by Parsons. A Frank Letter that Was Never Sent LUIGI MONTI, whose lectures are mentioned in Parsons's letter of February 4, 1877, returned to America after his dismissal from the Ameri- can consulate at Palermo. The lectures in cmestion — on \"Modern Italian Literature\"' — were delivered during the season of 1876-77 at the Lowell In- stitute. Four years later he gave another series on \"Dante and his Times and Works.\" When in Boston, Monti lived at 1 Beacon Street; it seems, however, that he did not abandon his residence at Palermo, hoping that he might be rein- stated in his position. It is with this problem that Parsons's letter to his sister Fanny- — Monti's wife — deals. It was written on August 27, 1882: LETTERS BY T. W. PARSONS It rejoices my heart to feel, what I gather from the tone of your letter, that in your own heart, you still cherish some longings for your country, for America you know is our country — and is Nellie Parsons Monti's birthplace — and as for Luigi he is a downright double-distilled Cape-Cod Yankee! You say in your letter, \"I hope you approve of my continuing to stay in Palermo\" and of your arguments on that matter. For the present I do, dear Fanny. But since my free talk with Mr. Hamilton Fish at his place on the Hudson— 6 or 7 years ago? — I have had little hope of Luigi's restoration to the Consulate. Mr. Fish privately told me many things, and said afterwards many more to Mrs. Parsons, that compelled me to doubt Luigi's chance. Still I have deferred to advise, [because of] the solicitations of others imagining that something I did not foresee in the vague cloud-rack of political interests might loom up in the future to make capital for Monti. But I am growing too aged to hope easily, or to hope longer, against all the indications which I have carelessly watched hitherto but am now closely watching . . . Besides Mr. Monti in making himself a literary man has in some degree unmade himself for an official position. Uncle Sam does not want \"literati\" to contend with mutinous crews and ignorant sea-captains. A scholar like Hawthorne might indeed be sent to Liverpool in remunera- tion for electioneering services to a Democratic President ; a lofty com- pliment from a genius like Hawthorne to a boon-companion and so forth. But Hawthorne was not a good Consul like Luigi Monti; in fact, ap- peared on most occasions of business the booby that he really was, out of his own department, which was purely of imaginative literature, for which he was gifted and cultivated to an extraordinary degree. After thus giving his opinion about Hawthorne, Parsons spoke his mind with equal frankness about his own brother-in-law: Nevertheless your husband is — to be candid with you, my dear Fanny — not much of a literary man and very little of a scholar in the high sense of scholarship. Because he gives in Boston, under a certain influence, and with a not uncertain prestige, a course or two of Lowell Lectures which my friend James Lowell must have been remotely in- strumental in obtaining, you must not fancy that he is to be reckoned among the sacred band whom the vulgar designate as \"literary fellows.\" From your long residence abroad, my dear Fanny — and I am writing very freely, with apologetic advances — you might easily, from Luigi's talk, overrate his position. Mr. Monti is industriously using his talents to secure a permanent position of tutor — not Professor, for which he is by no means qualified. I dwell on this distinction because you so frequently have spoken of a Professorship at Cambridge and ignorant people often talk to me of Profe ssor Monti. If you come back to Boston, you must at once and forever disabuse your mind of this rubbish. It is more than Luigi Monti can do to understand fully a single Canto of the Paradiso. Is he then qualified to succeed Mr, Longfellow, who was himself in many passages i4 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN wholly astray? A higher tone of scholarship is now exacted in our part of New England than that which might content Palermo. I will not speak of Chicago or any of those newly sprung and pretentious places. But I wish you to know that in the state of Massachusetts there are plenty of people dwelling in obscurity — farmer's daughters and mothers of hard-working children — who can easily distinguish between mental qualities and know the genuine from the . . . Twice Parsons remarks, \"They are calling me to dinner\"; but although determined \"not to descend to the table d'hote,\" he seems to have succumbed to the summons. This may be the reason that the letter was abruptly broken off — and apparently never sent. The Progress of the Purgatorio AT Wayland or at Scituate, Parsons was continuously at work on his translation of the Purgatorio. On March 24, 1878, he sent six lines, en- titled \"The Origin of the Human Soul,\" to his wife: Forth from His hand (before its birth who smiled On his new offspring) into being goes Even like a weeping, laughing, prattling child The simple infant soul that nothing knows Save that by pleasure willingly beguiled He follows that, as his glad Maker chose. \"There, my dear Annie,\" he wrote, \"is my afternoon's work from the XlVth Canto and I cannot tell whether it reads plain to the sense or not — to the understanding, I mean. Dante says that all the little simple new-born soul knows is that it wants to be happy and have a good time, and that God meant him to do so being himself a glad being. Can you comprehend it?\" Since 1876 Lowell had been in Madrid as American Minister, to be transferred four years later to London. Thus Parsons could not ask his help. But Norton was in Cambridge — or at his summer place in Ashfield — and to him he sent regu- larly the proof sheets of his translation. On August 10, 1881, he congratulated the Professor on his address given at Hingham, for the two hundredth anni- versary of the old Meeting-House: \"It has given me very great pleasure not only to receive and renew so much local instruction in so elegant and scholarly a form, but also to find that you have not lost your interest in the scenes and the people of this most interesting shore . . .\" At the same time he an- nounced the mailing of the proofs of the XXIst Canto. From another letter we learn that the translation of the new cantos was usually set up at the press of the local newspaper. In 1881, in the twenty-fourth year of their married life, Parsons's wife died. The grieved poet had printed a four-page pamphlet for private distribu- tion to relatives and friends, containing the poems \"O rest of God that endeth every pain,\" \"Bright soul ! beloved best of best and wise,\" \"Into the noiseless country Annie went,\" and \"She never came.\" This last, adapted from the Paradiso, is printed here : LETTERS BY T. W. PARSONS i5 She never came. That shadow fell, to last, Until the blessed Sabbath of release, When, out of martyrdom, her spirit passed From this 7vorld's exile to the promised peace. The Death of Longfellow and Emerson THE spring- of 1882 saw the death of two of the greatest figures of that great generation — Longfellow and Emerson. Parsons's letter of March 29, written to Norton, contains this melancholy reflection : Your kind note gave me sincere pleasure, although the touch of sorrow at its close made me remember with pain that I was writing to you my own light strain at the moment when your friend and my friend and everybody's friend was lying: in his shroud at Cambridge. The next morning's mail brought the news of Longfellow's death and the dreary sea looked sadder than before. He composed a Latin verse on the poet, which however does not seem to have been printed. There is only a trace of it in a letter to Mary Heard : \"I have thought of a change in the first line of my Epigraph on Longfellow. 'Tale tuum nobis carmen mansuete poeta !' 'Mansuete' instead of 'praeclare.' Please look out mansuetus in Leverett's Lexicon.\" Longfellow died on March 24, and Emerson on April 27. Parsons — no Transcendentalist — published in the Boston Advertiser of May 30 his poem \"Emer- son.\" Together with deep reverence for the philosopher, he voiced also his critical attitude: A certain space our Master zvent astray From the known pith to wander with the rest Of those who, dazzled by some sun-dog's ray, Sincerely fancying they beheld the day Dawn against nature's order in the West, Could couple Christ with Gautama and bound The Rock of Ages zvith a dial's round. There are minor differences between the first printed version and the text as it appeared in the collected Poems. The line in the latter, \"And part a priest- one errant from his sphere\" is unintelligible; the hyphen connecting priest and one should be a dash. \"And send back Simon to his nets again\" originally read \"And bring Saint Peter to his nets again\"; and so on. The poem elicited the following note from Holmes : I am very glad to see you in print again, for you are like one of those rare birds that now and then lights on one of our New England trees, gives us a short sweet song and then takes to his wings. It is a beautiful tribute you pay to our New England prophet and poet. My version of him (which I gave at a meeting of the Historical Society) may differ in some points from yours, but it agrees in many, and I am glad that you have found your sweet voice again on such a noble subject MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN The Writing of the \"Martial Ode\" IN sending a poem — probably a copy of \"The Pennyroyal\" — to Francis Parkman, Parsons hinted that this was perhaps \"the last utterance\" of his muse. However, he was to compose yet a number of poems of youthful fresh- ness, such as \"The Lily of Strath Farrar\" and \"The Rose and the Oriole.\" In May 18S8 he was asked to write a Martial Ode for the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Right Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, which was to be celebrated on June 4. The year before, for the Queen's Jubilee, a delegation from the Company went to England, where they were received with great ceremony. A similar delegation from the London Company was expected for the occasion in Boston. Parsons wrote this \"dreadful note of preparation\" to Mary Heard on May 13: Now this is no mean occasion, and I feel duly sensible of the honour I receive in being nominated for service in however humble a way. I wish to do my best and I should like to come up to Wayland and be shut up with Melpomene or Mary Heard until I shall have completed the verses for the which I must seek inspiration in the vicinity of those his- toric meadows which Bnrgoyne's men once trampled when — as old Aunt Margy often has told me — \"the red-coats were all over the pastur' and the tail eend on 'em was down to Sudbury Causey!\" I at first declined this office as out of my province, but the Colonel who represented his Corps would not hear of any \"backing out,\" and I must obey. They are expecting to have an extraordinary gathering. General Sheridan is coming out and they believe at least twenty or twenty-five Governors of various states. Now when I come, can I go right to my room and if stormy have a fire lighted? And is your carpet down? And when could I come to cause least inconvenience, and what must I bring? Is there any ale? or shall I send some claret? Have you plenty of milk? Moreover — are you all in condition to receive Erato? Is your Mother well as usual, and Aunt Lorey, and Ellen? Is it too muddy to walk in the woods? Is the pump in order? Coffee all right? Please, dear Mary, write to me soon after receival of this, because time presses. June draws near and already I seem to sniff gun-powder! \"My soul's in arms and eager for the f f f f fray!\" The writing of the poem did not take much time, for on May 25 Robert C. Winthrop already commented upon it. Winthrop was scheduled to speak at the dinner at Faneuil Hall that evening, and obviously Parsons sent him the draft of his poem. The historian wrote: Your \"Martial Ode\" has lin gered in my thoughts, and I even ven- tured to jot down two lines to supplant your Eagle: Our best and bravest shed their blood For U nion, Peace, and Liberty. The lines are commonplace and prosaic, and altogether wanting in your poetic fire. But perchance, they may help to suggest something to you, if you decide to mitigate your own paraphrase of Job . . . LETTERS BY T. W. PARSONS The Ode was delivered at the exercises held at the New Old South Church. It seems from the printed version that Parsons accepted Winthrop's advice in regard to the Job paraphrase, but happily did not avail himself of his poetry. The Joy of Spring FOR Holmes, also adept at writing light verse, Parsons felt both esteem and love. He was at ease with the Autocrat. His poem \"Spring Begins\" — published in the March 19, 1890, issue of the Boston Post — is a graceful and spontaneous expression of his emotion. Holmes was then eighty-one years old. Yet the octogenarian appears to the younger man, himself past seventy, as the symbol of Spring. The poem, which is not in the collected edition, may fittingly be reprinted here. The second stanza is an example of genuine New England poetry : One who for three-score years hath been Our teacher in the tuneful art — / could not feel the Spring begin Without a szvelling of the heart Tow'rds him whose melody and mirth Have struck such largess from our stony earth. New England's air blows often harsh O'er fields zvith rocks and boulders rolled ; Huge ribs of ice along the marsh Declare how dreadful was the cold When Winter's wihl and tyrannous reign Bound all our coast with one continuous cliain. But what with friends, and what with books, And fireside faces beaming bright, And neighbors round with pleasant looks, And music on the stormiest night, And thy companionship, bestowed Oft in gay banter or inspiring ode, We did not find December dull Nor March a misery with his blasts, Nor thought of hour-glass, bones and skull; And while our English language lasts And Wendell Holmes remains with men, The poet's physic and the doctor s pen Shall both be honored for and wide In many a land beyond the sea; But most of all, our hearths beside. Dear Oliver shall counted be Whether he only chat or sing, A charm for Winter, and the joy of Spring. 2 i8 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN A week later Parsons received from Holmes this gracious note from Beverly Farms: You must not think because you have not heard from me that I overlooked your pleasant reference to me in the lines I cut from my newspaper a week or ten days ago. I thank you for your generous tribute — to be lauded by the laudati is indeed an honor. I leave with you a copy of an edition de luxe of a book of mine, with a pretty title-page by Mrs. Whitman. T hope you will like it well enough to give it a place on your shelves. Lowell's Last Act of Friendship FROM 1876 until 1885 James Russell Lowell was in Europe, the first four years as American Minister to Spain and the last five as American Minis- ter to the Court of St. James. Even after his return to America he paid several visits to England. No letters from Parsons to him. if any were written during that time, have been preserved. In Anril i860 Parsons had sent him that desperate appeal to help Luigi Monti ; and then after twenty-one years he wrote again in the interest of his worthy brother-in-law. Lowell's answer, dated October 7, t8qo — perhaps his last letter to Parsons — is characteristic of the man: Your note would have given me unqualified pleasure, but for the ''Mr.\" with which it began. In future let there be no misteries between us. Of course I shall be glad to do anything I can for Monti. How much I can, is another affair. I write to my cousin by the same post that car- ries this, but how much good it will do I cannot say. as he is a person who doesn't like (I think) to have his management of the Institute med- dled with. But we are on excellent terms — for near relatives — and I shall try. Many thanks for your kind interest in my health. After a summer of helpless inertia, I suddenly found myself another man about a fort- night ago and really feel now as if I had never been ill. How long it may last I cannot say. I don't venture to go about much as yet. But Lowell was sicker than he himself knew. After a deceptive recovery, he fell ill again, and died on August 12, t8qt. In October of that year there is a note from Parsons to Charles Eliot Norton, acknowledging the receipt of a gift book sent by the latter : Coming up from the sea-shore yesterday I for the first time dis- covered the treasure, of which I had so many days been the unconscious possessor and I now beg you to accept my slow word of gratitude. It was a great consolation to see your handwriting again and to read your touching tribute of friendship to the remembrance of Lowell, whom we both alike have reason to remember with lasting love. The note ends, \"I am also glad that you do not forget me and I am always sincerely your friend and servant\" -- and that simple line expresses far more LETTERS BY T. W. PARSONS 19 than conventional courtesy. Parsons valued Norton's friendship very highly. On February 7, 1892, he jotted down in pencil the epigram intended for the Cambridge professor: De lecto, ut potui, mando tibi verba dolentis, Si trepidante manu, at cor mihi non trepidat. These were really \"verba dolentis.\" Parsons was now much of the time con- fined to his bed. \"Circum Praecordia\" ABOUT this time Parsons's last volume, Circum Praecordia, was published. The book contains \"The Collects of the Holy Catholic Church as thev are set forth by the Church of England in her Book of Common Prayer for every Sunday in the year.\" Parsons worked upon these poems through many years. They ap- peared, one at a time, in various newspapers. His task was extremely difficult; for great prose has its own poetry, which is seldom improved by versification. Parsons adhered closely to the text, sometimes transposing only one word or two. His poems are seldom \"padded.\" They have strength and sinuousness, and are imbued with a true religious feeling, a deep and manly piety. Any one can be quoted. Here is, for instance, the collect for Ash Wednesday. First the text from the Prayer Book : \"Almighty and everlasting God. who hatest nothing that thou hast made, and dost forgive the sins of all them that are penitent; create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we worthily lamenting our sins, and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\" And this is Parsons's transcription: Father Almighty! everlasting God! Who hatest nothing which Thy hands have made, And whose forgiveness is on all bestowed Who have in penitence devoutly prayed Sincerely sorrozving, in us create Nezv hearts and contrite, that while we lament Our sins, acknowledging our wretched state, Of Thee, whose mercy grozvs as zve repent, Perfect remission we may all obtain And so, forgiven, in Thy peace remain, Through Jesus Christ our Sozran Lord, Amen! From the congratulatory letters two have been preserved in Mr. Goodspeed's collection. One was written by Phillips Brooks to Franccsca Lunt: I am very grateful to you for your kind recollection of our con- versation and for sending me Dr. Parsons's Book of Sonnets on the Col- lects. I shall value them very much indeed both for your kindness and 20 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN for their own beauty which I have felt constantly as I have read them in the papers. The other was sent by Oliver Wendell Holmes directly to Parsons: I thank you most cordially for the beautiful little volume \"Circum Prascordia.\" I have read many of the versified Collects as they came out in the paper and have been struck, as all must have been, with their reverential sweetness and humility. They will be acceptable everywhere, but to the ad- herents of the Episcopal Church they will be a priceless offering to lay on their altar. You will take a place in their love and esteem by the side of George Herbert and of Keble. From his sick-bed at Scituate Parsons was taken to the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he spent several weeks. But he never recovered from his illness. He lingered through the summer, and died on September 12, 1892. A collected edition of his Poems, in one volume, and his translations of Dante, in another, were published in the fall of 1893. Upon receiving a copy of the Poems, on December 19 Holmes sent this acknowledgment to Mrs. Lunt — a fine tribute to the departed fellow-poet : Many of these poems I have long known and admired, but others of them are new to me, and all are most welcome, not the least so my old acquaintances among them. Dr. Parsons was as true a poet as we had among us. His fondness for Dante and the admirable version he has given of the Divina Commedia showed the lofty range of his affinities; the reverence, the tenderness, which characterized his own verse will give it and keep for it a high place in the poetical record of our country and our time. I felt a deep sympathy for him in his sickness when I found him lonely and suffering at the Massachusetts General Hospital. I do not believe he would have been as well situated in all respects elsewhere, for I have always thought that a haven of rest for the sufferer, who was sure of the best skill and the kindest treatment under its roof. I remembered visiting Mr. George Sumner (Charles's brother) when he was under treatment there, and thinking how fortunate he was to be so well cared for in his time of ill- ness. Still when I found Dr. Parsons on his bed in the ward where he must pass many weary hours and days, I felt drawn to him by his need of a friendly look and word and tried to cheer him so far as I could hope to do it. I only wish I had been oftener to see him and done more to en- courage and enliven him. Let me assure you and all who are nearest to him that I, in com- mon with all who knew him, feel his loss, and sympathize with those who mourn for him as a cherished relative. Parsons was buried in the family lot, by the side of his wife, in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. There is a single stone over their grave with the Christian symbols XP and Alpha and Omega, and this line from Dante : E da csilio venue a questa pace. zoltAn haraszti A Norman Manuscript of the Old Testament OUTSTANDING among recent ad- ditions to the Rare Book Depart- ment is a beautiful manuscript, written about 1430, and containing the histori- cal portions of the Old Testament in Norman French. The narrative is of an unusual type, evidently meant for an audience not too skilled in theo- logy; for reigns and battles make up the greater part of the book, and the story reads more like a chronicle than like an abridged Bible. The manuscript has 340 vellum leaves, written in two columns in a fine rounded gothic book hand. There are over five hundred large and a great number of smaller initials, illuminated with burnished gold, and decorated with graceful leaf designs. The blank lines at the ends of chapters are filled out with flourishes in gold and blue, so that every page is bright with color. Sixteen large historiated initi- als, marking the different books, con- tain finely-executed portraits of the kings and prophets, among them Moses, David, Joshua, and Jonah. Though, the book is written entirely in French, its origin is clearly English. Not only is the style of decoration similar to that of the English manuscripts of the period, but there are several unusual words and spellings which indicate an English scribe. Most characteristic is a fre- quent use of the Anglo-Norman -on where a Frenchman would have written —eu, as in the endings of vigucrons and leprous and in the spelling flour for flew. Another word which may point to English influence is hoege (the mod- ern huge), which in England seems to have replaced the Old French ahuge. The book begins with a brief but ceremonious prologue: \"Au Roy de gloire dieu tout puissant que sanz de- finement permalt soit honneur et puis- sance en non de pere et des fitz. et de saint esperit trois personnes en un seul dieu commence lystoire de la Bible que lomme list en sainte eglise de an en an translattee en franceis hors de latin de la faisance Saint Jerome . . .\" After the prologue comes the table of contents from Genesis to Ruth, con- taining the chapter headings which appear as rubrics in the text. This is abridged, and the arrangement there- after is peculiar. For instance, Exodus has nine chapters, which correspond to the first and part of the second chapter of Exodus in the English Bible, ending with the rescue of Moses by Pharaoh's daughter, who in the French narrative has the name of Tremuth. The five books of Moses which follow correspond to parts of Exodus, Num- bers, and Deuteronomy ; the omitted portions deal mostly with details of the law. After the Book of Ruth is another table of contents for the rest of the text. This consists of four books of Kings, which we know as Samuel I and II and two books of Kings. The books of Chronicles do not appear as such, but parts of them are incorpo- rated in the history. The prophets are also omitted, except for five chapters of Jonah. The last section, entitled \"The Desolation of Jerusalem,\" is an account of the reigns of the Kings of Judah, from Uzziah on, leaving out the period from Hezekiah to the Captivity and ending with Herod. The ink on the last page is faded, but it is possible to read the words, \"Car en son temps nasquist Jhesu crist de la virgine sainte Marie que est Roy sur Roys . . .\" The story was apparently not continued after the birth of Christ. The author of this \"edition\" of the Old Testament must have had some sense of drama — or else he felt that even in those days the Bible needed \"popularization.\" Much of his narra- tive has the vivid directness of the fables with which preachers of the same period used to enliven their ser- mons. This is how he tells the story of David, to paraphrase a chapter. He de- scribes Goliath standing forth from the Philistine host, \"tall and huge and hideous,\" and David, then only \"un petit enfant,\" pleading with- King Saul to be allowed to attack. When Saul tries to dissuade the boy, the latter re- plies, \"If he be killed by such a child as I am, the more shame to him ! I shall kill him in your presence, within a little while.\" In the English Bible, David kills Goliath with one stone ; but here, since the story is told for men who loved a fight, a sort of magic ele- 21 22 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN ment enters in, and David, like the youngest son in the fairy tales, demol- ishes the giant with three shots. At the first, Goliath totters ; at the second, which hits him in exactly the same place, he staggers worse than before ; at the third, he falls dead on the ground. And Saul, like a good Norman baron, makes David his \"seneschal.\" Though the scribe who copied this text was apparently an Englishman, the manuscript must have been drawn from some French source. An inter- esting series of coincidences makes it possible to identify this source with at least moderate certainty. In his study of French verse translations of the Bible, M. Jean Bonnard describes an Anglo-Norman poetical version of the Old Testament, dating from about the end of the thirteenth century. A prose translation of this poem is preserved in two manuscripts in the Bibliotheque Nationale, and one line is a particularly garbled rendering of the original. In prose, the sixth commandment runs, \"Le sime que horn jugge droiturele- ment (The sixth, that man judge righteously),\" while the poem reads, \"Le sist nul home occire ne a tort juger (The sixth, to kill no man nor to judge wrongly).\" In short, the prose translator merely Left out the murder! Allowing for differences in spelling, the ten commandments of this prose version correspond word for word with the text of the Library's manu- script. Moreover, another critic, M. Samuel Berger, considers one of the two prose manuscripts mentioned above to be of English origin. The prologue of the latter, he writes, begins, \"Al roi de glorie Deu tut puissant, qe sanz definement parmaint.\" This rhyming in- troduction is very close to the opening words of the Library's manuscript. It seems very likely, therefore, that the latter is also a prose version of the thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman poem described by M. Bonnard. To American readers, reference to the Bible in the vernacular brings to mind first the various stages of the Eng- lish Bible before the King James Ver- sion. But the history of French Bible translation also had an early beginning and is not without interest. Trans- lation in French can be traced back to the version of the Psalter made by Norman monks in the south of England at the beginning of the twelfth century. Half a century later appeared a trans- lation of the Apocalypse and a rhymed version of the four books of Kings. About 1250, scholars at the University of Paris made the first complete French version of the Bible. This was at the peak of Paris's supremacy, when Al- bertus Magnus was lecturing, soon to be followed by his brilliant pupil Thomas Aquinas. This version, also called \"the Bible of St. Louis,\" reappeared in part in a work exceedingly popular through- out the Middle Ages — the Bible His- toriale of Guyart des Moulins, a curi- ous composition taken from Peter Comestor's Historia Scholastica and in- corporating the second part of the Bible of St. Louis. The same text, revised, became also the first French printed Bible, which left the press of Antoine Verard about 1496. Bible reading flourished at the French court in the fourteenth century — as even the royal nicknames seem to testify. An independent version, un- finished but of high scholarly repute, was made lor King John the Good by a group of Dominicans. And his suc- cessor, Charles the Wise, sponsored another incomplete translation, this time based on the Bible of 1250, and probably prepared by Raoul de Presles. The Library's manuscript belonged formerly to Henry Hucks Gibbs, better known to collectors as Lord Aldenham. Aldenham was a versatile student who managed to combine philology with finance, endowed Keble College, Ox- ford, and was at one time Governor of the Bank of England. He was a skilled bibliographer as well, and has inserted in this volume his own colla- tion and analysis of the text, comparing it with the King James Version. M. M. Ten Books A Puritan in Babylon. By William Allen White. Macmillan. 1938. 460 pp. [E792.W576.] The title of the book tells the whole story — the story of Calvin Coolidge as well as the attitude of his biographer. Mr. William Allen White, the editor of the Kansas Emporia Gazette, is one of the most talented veteran journalists in the country. The racy old liberal looks upon Calvin Coolidge almost with the eyes of an alien ; yet in his fundamental Americanism he is not so very far from the Yankee President. Mr. White, although himself born several years before Coolidge, regards the latter as the embodiment of a re- mote age, \"a perfect throwback to the more primitive days of the Republic.\" Through Coolidge he intended to paint also a picture of the entire period. Ac- cording to his own summary: \" The reaction of this obviously limited but honest, shrewd, sentimental, resolute American primitive to those gorgeous and sophisticated times — his White House years — furnished material for a study of American life as re- flected in American business and American politics. . .\" The chapter headings, like the title of the volume, are in perfect harmony with the nar- rative. The first, describing the back- ground of Coolidge's childhood, is \"The Museum That Was Vermont.\" In the same vein the biographer traces his college years at Amherst: the beginning of his law practice and that of his political career at Northampton ; and his rise by successive stages to the governorship of Massachusetts. Then comes the account of the Convention which elected him Vice-President; and that of his succession to the presi- dency upon Harding's death. The portrait is by no means of the conven- tional flattering type. It is not in the grand manner; on the contrary Mr. White delights in accumulating small but revealing details. The very accent, voice, looks, and movements of the President are faithfully reproduced. \"He quacked,\" \"he rasped dryly,\" \"he grinned\" introduce Coolidge's none too voluble pronouncements. \"He opened his eyes widely. . . \" sounds almost like the climax of a chapter. Mr. White knew Coolidge personally, and he has drawn, in addition, on the more intimate knowledge possessed by men like Mr. Frank W. Stearns, the late Dwight Morrow, and Mr. Frank W. Buxton. He has also studied a number of works dealing with the economic and financial aspects of the period. A scholar would probably have written a more learned book, quoting many documents ; but nobody could have written one more compact and brilliant. Young Longfellow. By Lawrance Thompson. Macmillan. 1938. 443 pp. [PS2282.T45.] The three-volume biography of Long- fellow by his brother Samuel has been regarded for over fifty years as the most authoritative source of informa- tion regarding the poet. Yet Samuel Longfellow, in accordance with the standards of his time, took great lib- erties with the letters and journals, leaving out passages and emending others, thus giving an appearance of uninterrupted serenity to the poet's whole life. Suspicious of Samuel Long- fellow's methods, the author of the present biography went to the original manuscripts, and at Craigie House in Cambridge — as also at other places, among them the Boston Public Li- brary — he found plenty of material. Instead of avoiding them, he concen- trated, as he says, on the conflicting\" problems of young Longfellow, for he believes that the traits of the poet's character were molded \"by the repeated inner struggle between his inherent Yankee opportunism and his domi- nantly romantic attitude toward life.\" According to his narrative, Longfellow's life at Bowdoin College, first as a student and later as a teacher of modern lan- guages, was anything but happy. Yet the poet at least escaped from practising law ; and, having spent several years in Europe perfecting himself in languages, he finally succeeded George Ticknor as professor of belles-lettres at Harvard. But, since he aspired to purely literary work, teaching remained a drudgery for him. The 23 ^4 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN deeper reason for his sufferings was his unhappy love for Frances Apple- ton, whom he met abroad after the loss of his first wife. The poem A Psalm of Life and the romance of Hyperion Mr. Thompson links closely with this disappointment, to which he ascribes also the poet's meager pro- ductiveness in that period. In 1843 Longfellow won Miss Appleton, and in the peaceful years after their mar- riage his talents blossomed out. Un- doubtedly, Mr. Thompson's story of the youth and early manhood of Long- fellow is much more plastic, under- standable, and human than was the one hitherto accepted. It is written with honesty and industry; that it is not more exciting is not the author's fault. It is Later Than You Think. By Max Lerner. Viking. 1938. 260 pp. [JC423.L45.] Quoting a familiar and ominous motto, Mr. Lerner exhorts America to mili- tant democracy. Like Thomas Mann, he insists on the need for an affirma- tive attitude in place of the timorous liberalism which is now playing di- rectly into the hands of the reaction- aries. His own definition of democracy is probably the accepted one — assur- ance of political, civil, and economic liberty for both the majority and the minority. Militancy, he is careful to explain, means neither militarism nor ruthlessness. He emphasizes more than other writers, however, the fact that democracy means majority rule. Minority rights are not the only ones to be protected ; fascism itself is, at first, a minority movement. His list of agenda for a \"democratic collecti- vism\" is based on expansion of the national income, by stepping up produc- tion in all basic industries according to consumption schedules worked out by disinterested experts. Socialization of banking and government control of investment and foreign trade would be necessary elements in this scheme. This planned capitalism would be, he hopes, only a transition to a planned socialism in which private ownership would be the exception rather than the rule. Hence would arise \"a hu- manism for the millions.\" Mr. Lerner's conception presents a strongly inte- grated appearance to the eye ; but he does not explain how it is to be created in fact. (H. McC.) The Ramparts We Watch. By George Fielding Eliot. Reynal & Hitchcock. I938- 370 PP- [UA23.E45.] This admirable exposition by Major Eliot lays before the average citizen an abundance of information about the organization, coordination, and avail- ability of the navy, army, and air forces in time of war. The strategic position of the country is much like that of Great Britain in the past century, that is, before the development of aviation. Protected by the oceans from the danger of large air attacks, the United States does not need a drastic change of military policy. The Fascist powers of Europe are poten- tial enemies in South America, and there is also the possibility of friction with Mexico and Japan about immigra- tion, and of the latter's eventual seizure of the Philippines. Major Eliot in- sists that \"offensive action is the all- important principle of American strate- gy.\" The offensive is, of course, the duty of the navy, which, to insure victory, must be a \"fleet superior in fighting power to any fleet or combi- nation of fleets which can be assumed as our possible antagonists in either ocean.\" The author regards the mod- ern battleship as \"the most formidable concentration of fighting-power yet created by man.\" The Decline and Fall of the British Empire. By Robert Briffault. Simon and Schuster. 1938. 264 pp. [DA30.B75.I Mr. Briffault's own choice of title for this indictment of England was \"The English Myth,\" which would have been far better than the publisher's ambitious title with its reminiscence of Gibbon. The English Myth, accord- ing to the author, consists in ignoring the fact that England's power has rested entirely upon her superior wealth and representing that it has rested in- stead upon the superior moral sense and wisdom of her people. He argues with stinging invective, often exaggerated, that the moral sense is a hypocritical veil for trickery, and that the wisdom is the shrewdness of the dominant class TEN BOOKS 25 in preserving its prerogatives. Mr. Brirrault's analysis of English snobbery, the public school system, and Vic- torian sentimentality has in it little that is new except its epigrammatic intensity. He is convinced — and this is his real \"reason for anger\" — that Britain has consistently been a champion of reactionary forces and is now the promoter of Fascism. Whereas pre- viously she fought her wars or main- tained the balance of power wholly from self-interest, she is now system- atically sacrificing those nationalist interests for the support of reaction. The \"Rosenberg front,\" as the author calls the opposition of the Fascist and \"Fascist-democratic\" countries to Soviet Russia, has made Britain, with France following her lead, support the Spanish insurgents, fraternize with Japan, tole- rate Mussolini in Abyssinia, and ally herself with the Nazis. He even be- lieves that Chamberlain \"closely re- sembles\" the Nazi Fiihrer. (M. M.) This Man La Guardia. By Lowell M. Limpus and Burr W. Leyson. Dutton. 1938. 429 pp. [E748.L23L5.] The authors of this breezy biography of a \"human dynamo\" have evidently been fired by Mayor La Guardia's own enthusiasm. The tale is rapid, direct, shot through with snappy metaphors straight from the front-page headlines. But then, Mr. La Guardia is \"news.\" From the time when he served simul- taneously as Representative from New York and Major in the United States air forces on the Italian front, until now, when he rules the second largest city in the world, he has constantly attempted more work than seems pos- sible for a human being. Nominally a Republican, he waged a relentless campaign against Secretary Mellon's tax plan, and defeated President Coolidge himself over the Muscle Shoals bill. He defended all the issues that seemed most radical to his colleagues . — the Child Labor bill, Senator LaFollette's Progressive ticket, the repeal of the 1 8th Amendment. In 1934 he became Mayor of New York, the goal he had set for himself fourteen years before. His first term was a stormy one. Fiery as he was, he made mistakes and he made enemies. But in last year's campaign Fiorello La Guardia, the first reform mayor ever re-elected in New York, polled more votes than any other man who had ever held the office. (H. McC.) Lillian Wald, Neighbor and Crusader. By R. L. Duffus. Macmillan. 1938. 371 pp. [HV28.W3D8.] Lillian Wald's pioneering began in 1893, when, the daughter of a cultured German-Jewish family, she established herself as a nurse with her co-worker Mary Brewster in a tenement in the lower East Side and began to dispense medical aid — and friendly advice. That same year the two nurses moved into 165 Henry Street, the center which soon became known as the Henry Street Settlement. It expanded continuously, so that by 1932 its Nursing Service ministered to nearly a hundred thou- sand cases a year. Yet with its im- mense growth — country houses, more than a hundred clubs, classes and kindergartens — the Settlement has kept the spirit of spontaneous neigh- borliness. Free from racial or social prejudice, Miss WaM had the faculty of identifying herself with any one of her numberless friends and visitors. Among the many reforms which the country owes largely to her ceaseless activity are the sanitary control of working quarters, the institution of the municipal school nurse, the Federal Children's Bureau, and the opening of playgrounds tor city children. (M. M.) The March of Literature. By Ford Madox Ford. Dial. 1938. 878 pp. [PN524.F6.] Olivet College in Michigan is a curi- ous institution inasmuch as the pro- fessorate there consists solely of practising artists. Mr. Ford, the En- glish essayist and novelist, has been on the teaching staff tor some time, his subject being the lost art of reading. In writing his present book, he seems to have had in mind, first, of all, his students ; it is probable, indeed, that the book grew out of his lectures. At any rate, the style has the simplicity of direct talk ; it has also its diffusiveness, which however does not detract from its interest, as much of the value of Mr. Ford's work has always been in his asides. The task of writing a history 26 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN of all literatures is of course enormous, and one which would require severe discipline — a virtue for which Mr. Ford has never been conspicuous. But he has a very reliable measure in his selection of material: he has written only about the books which- he himself has enjoyed. \"If I lead my reader up to unreadable books,\" he comments wisely, \"I risk giving him a distaste for all literature.\" And that, above all, he wants to avoid. There is a joyousness on every page, whether he discusses the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, or any one else. By way of better per- suading his readers, he often refers to his own delight in a particular book in the days of his adolescence. His distaste for the \"dry bones\" of scholar- ship is very acute, but his irritation, may be understood on the ground that, as he writes, \"in Anglo-Saxondom the tendency has always been to regard instructional writing as being on a higher plane and creative literature as being, at any rate, frivolous.\" Chateaubriand. By Andre Maurois. Harper. 1938. 322 pp. [DC255.C4M33.] Andre Maurois's capacity for present- ing romantics in their most romantic light has not diminished in his latest biography. With all the brilliant rhetoric at his command, he pictures the gulf between the real and the imaginary Chateaubriand. Rene ex- alted his lonely youth and adolescence in the Castle of Combourg. The \"noble savage\" in Atala crystallized his im- pressions when at twenty-three, steeped in the philosophy of Rousseau, he journeyed through the untravelled forests of America. His best-known work, Le Genie du Christianisme, ex- pressed his emotional reactions to the Christian religion as the most poetical and most aesthetic of ail creeds. The tremendous influence of this book changed his conception of his own personality until he regarded himself as one of the leading figures of Christen- dom, even as a statesman. Under the Restoration, indeed, he did achieve some political fame. Louis XVIII made him one of his ministers during the Hundred Days, and later he became ambassador to Berlin, London, and Rome in turn; but in the end his am- bition and vanity proved his down- fall. Disillusioned and weary, he retired to spend his remaining talent on the Memoires d'Outre-Tombe. His last years were lightened by the com- panionship of Madame Recamier. But M. Maurois believes that he found peace and unity only in the picture of his life which he drew for posterity in the Memoires. Leonardo da Vinci. By Antonina Val- lentin. Viking. 561pp. [4104.05-1 16.] Mademoiselle Vallentin's biography is filled with a sort of amazement at the daring genius of Leonardo da Vinci ; but it is also the portrait of a magnifi- cent failure. In spite of such triumphs as the Last Supper and Mona Lisa, the atmosphere of her account is one of frustration. As the world knows, Leonardo was centuries ahead of his time in scientific imagination. His notebooks are full of designs for flying machines, valiant and beautiful, if futile. He discovered the basic laws of friction and inertia, though they were more precisely formulated by later students ; invented a method of screw cutting which is used to this day ; and was the first to envisage the power of steam. Yet, as the present author portrays the artist, he appears pathetically isolated in that gregarious age. He took no pains to conciliate either his patrons or his pupils — did his work when it suited him, and when he was absorbed pursued his studies regardless of engagements. While a genius is perhaps not answer- able to ordinary conventions, it is still not altogether surprising that only one person, his assistant Francesco Melzi, seems to have felt genuine affection for Leonardo. All these aspects the biographer brings out with sympathy. Her only weakness is a tendency to indulge in too subjective criticism of the paintings. (LI. McC.) Library Notes War and Peace with the Ohio Indians AMONG the Americana acquired by the Library at the Shea Sale in December 1937 is a first-edition copy of An Historical Account of the Ex- pedition against the Ohio Indians in 1764 under the Command of Henry Bouquet, Esq. [*\"20th\" 3.95] by William Smith, printed in Philadelphia in 1765. The original folding map by Thomas Hut- chins is missing and has been replaced by one from the French edition of 1769 printed in Amsterdam. The copy is extra-illustrated by two plates engraved after paintings by Benjamin West for the London edition of 1766. The book begins with a narrative ot Colonel Bouquet's campaign in August 1763, culminating in the battle of Bushy Run, which the Colonel won by luring the attacking Indians into a trap. The main \"Historical Account,\" that of Bouquet's expedition against the Ohio Indians in 1764, is concerned not with fighting, but with peace-making. It describes picturesquely the Colonel's reception of the chiefs of the Senecas, Delawares, and Shawnees, the stern conditions he imposed upon them, and the Indians' acceptance of these terms in poetic speeches. \"With this string of wampum we wipe the tears from your eyes. . .\" was their general senti- ment. The return of the captives, .some of whom were reluctant to leave their hosts and even ran back to the Indian settlements, makes a quaint story. The Appendices contain data on forts and Indian towns. The author of the book, Dr. William Smith, was the first provost of the \"College, Academy and Charitable School\" of Philadelphia, later merged with the University of Pennsylvania. A clergyman of the Established Church and a Loyalist during the Revolution, he was a versatile gentleman, and his activity in ecclesiastical and domestic politics kept him going at a lively pace until his death in 1803. He was wise enough to appreciate the talent of Benjamin West at the beginning of the latter's career, and to encourage such young Philadelphia poets as Francis Hopkinson and James Sterling. But he was also arrogant, irritable, and, at the end of his life, an habitual drunkard. The latter indulgence cost him a coveted appointment to the bishopric of the Protestant Episcopal Church. M. M. Antidote Against Melancholy THE Library has recently acquired a rare little book, which has the highly ambitious purpose of chasing away that deadliest of all the humors — the doldrums. The title is, quite properly, An Antidote against Melan- choly [A.2098.1]. It is compounded of \"Witty Ballads, Jovial Songs, and Merry Catches\" — that is, ditties and old ballads. The volume was published in 1661, at a time when few had set themselves the task of preserving folk- lore and the current popular literature. The compiler, who must have enjoyed himself greatly in the gathering of these bits, is unknown. His poetical powers, however, may be conjectured from the two lines which he added to his title page: These witty Poems though sometime may seem to halt on crutches. Yet they'l all merrily please you for your charge, which not much is. But these \"witty Poems\" do more than \"merrily please.\" Aside from their rollicking sense of humor, they are grouped in such a way as to pro- vide a cross section of early Restora- tion and Stuart times. There are satires on fashion ; on schools and theaters such as Brasenose College and the Swan ; on religious and poli- tical differences ; and on literary fig- ures. J. P. Collier was the first to point out various Shakespearean in- terests, among them an allusion to Faistaff, in the catches. But he did not record this disparaging reference to Jonson's head and habits: Fetch me Ben. Johnsons scull, and fill 1 with Sack Rich as the same he drank, when the whole pack 27 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN Of jolly sisters pledg'd, and did agree, It was no sin to be as drunk as he; If there be any weakness in the wine, There's vertue in the Cup to mak't divine. The stanza was concocted by Dr. Henry Edwards, one of the four known contributors. Ben Jonson's \"Song of Cook Lawrel,\" also included in the volume, is based on the character of an often named rascal of the sixteenth century, subject of other ballads, and more generally known as Cocke Lo- relle. Thomas Randolph's \"Combate of the Cocks\" is another of the signed pieces. The most famous of the latter, perhaps, is that by Sir John Suckling on a wedding, beginning \"I tell thee Dick where I have been.\" Its music was used for still another ballad called the \"Cavaleer's Complaint,\" which is a political outburst against Charles's neglect of his old supporters. Although given anonymously, it is much in the tone of Thomas Jordan. The controversies over religious and political questions have not one half the interest of less weighty disputes — such as the virtues of sack as against beer; the devilish origin of tobacco, in contrast to the pleasure derived therefrom ; or the periwig in its relation to other head coverings. Old proverbs appear in the \"Black- smith,\" which was parodied in another poem of obscure political import, the \"Brewer.\" Even the style of the old metrical romances did not escape the satirist, as is shown in the long bur- lesqued version of \"St. George for England,\" the refrain of which runs: St. George he was for England, St. Denis was for France, Sing Hony soitt qui mal y pense. The book was printed by \"Mer. Melancholicus\" — a man who evi- dently failed to profit by his own \"Pills.\" The title page is embellished with an engraving of remarkable workmanship, which depicts an upper and lower stratum of society, each en- joying its own Epicurean pleasures. E. S. The Children's Quadrille — a Primer LE QUADRILLE des Enfans, by one Monsieur Berthaud whose Christian name is now unknown, is a pleasant primer by which, through the use of eighty-four pictures, infants of four or five might learn to read in a few months — at least, if they were dis- posed to docility. The little volume, printed at Paris in 1783, is the fifth edition. First published in 1744, the book had \"a prodigious success,\" but was forgotten after the author's death until the present editor, M. Alexandre, revived its use for the children of the Due de Chartres. It is hard to say whether \"quad- rille\" refers in this case to the card- game or to the dance ; but it suggests a playful and happy way of learning to read, more attractive than some of the other educational systems which, under Rousseau's influence, were be- coming popular in France. The chil- dren are to associate the pictures with the sounds of the words they repre- sent, gradually learning to combine syllables. The pictures too are interesting, showing the familiar objects of the ancicn regime: a curtained bed, a peruke, a solemn lawyer in cap and bands. To prove the success of the method, the editor cites actual results. Thus Made- moiselle de Chartres, five years old, began to read fluently after fifteen lessons, and Monseigneur the Due de Montpensier, not quite four years of age, could read in less than three months. This little prodigy was probably the younger brother of the future King Louis Philippe. At the end, the pupils are rewarded with a moral fairy tale about a prince who is taught to amend his cruel des- potism. It is a pity that the lesson did not come earlier ; before they were grown, these well-brought-up children of the nobility had to face the terrors of the Revolution. Luther on Purgatory THE Library has added one more tract to its collection of Luther's polemical writings: Ein Widderruff vom Fcgcfeur [ **G. 409.1 50] , a small pamphlet, printed by Hans Lufft at Wittenberg in 1530. Two other printers issued this work in the same year, namely Jorg Rhaw at Wittenberg and George Wachter at Nuremberg. Luther wrote this tract in June and LIBRARY NOTES 29 J tily 1530 at Koburg in Saxony, the friendly city from which he followed eagerly the proceedings at the Diet of Augsburg. On June 25th the Prot- estants presented to the Emperor their articles of faith, known as the Augs- burg Confession. Melanchthon, the author of the Confession, had sent the draft to Luther, who approved of it. Later, however, he remarked the ab- sence of certain controversial points, notably the belief in purgatory, and so felt impelled to send out the tract in which he discussed this question in his own pugnacious way. The reformer divided the opening chapters into sections called the first, second, third, etc. \"lies.\" With biting sarcasm he reproved his adversaries first for basing the idea of purgatory on the text of the apocryphal book of Maccabees, then for misinterpreting the text of the 65th Psalm, the 14th chapter of Revelations, and a passage in Saint Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians. Incidentally he attacked the doctrine of salvation through good works, and directed abusive epithets at Thomas Aquinas. M. M. Sir Thomas Browne on Vulgar Errors SIR Thomas Browne, that learned doctor of Stuart times whose Reiigio Medici is one of the most stately books in English literature, published in 1646 another work equally famous in his own day — Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or \"Enquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors.\" The first edition of this, simply bound in brown calf by Riviere, has just now been added to the Library. Sir Thomas had a wide practice, and must have picked up a good many of these hoary fables in the course of his professional visits. In spite of long experience, he never ceased to wonder at the ordinary multitude, which he described on one occasion as \"that numerous piece of monstrosity, which, taken asunder, seem men and the reasonable creatures of God, but, con- fused together, make but one great beast.\" Out of pure compassion, doubt- less, he resolved to write his encyclo- pedia of marvels, in order to disabuse a few of his countrymen — especially the \"ingenuous Gentry\" — of their superstitions. But he was no real reformer. He loved the curious for its own sake, and was always \"faine to wander in the America and untravelled parts of truth.\" Even while he scorns these old wives' tales, he delights in them, and recounts with relish all the grisly legends about the mandrake ; the an- cient belief that goat's blood softens a diamond ; the mysterious virtues as- cribed to mistletoe; the common opinion that the ostrich or \"sparrow camel\" digests iron; and the medicinal properties of powdered unicorn's horn. The savor of his discourse is only heightened by the fact that he him- self believed firmly in astrology and witchcraft. The richness of Browne's gorgeous style, heavy with Latinisms, has be- come proverbial. Pseudodoxia Epidemica lacks the sheer beauty of some shorter works like Urn Burial or The Garden of Cyras; but though it exacts a little patience on the part of the reader, this fascinating lore is well worth it.
