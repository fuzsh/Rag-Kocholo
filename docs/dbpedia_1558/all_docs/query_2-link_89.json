        "text": "Inner Wheel is an international organisation closely linked to Rotary that was founded in 1924 by Margarette Golding, a nurse, business woman and the wife of a Manchester Rotarian, to unite wives and daughters of Rotarians.\n\nBefore 1989, Rotary generally prohibited women as members. Therefore another organisation was established for the wives and daughters of Rotarians, known as Inner Wheel. Despite women now being able to join Rotary, Inner Wheel Clubs continue in many countries.\n\nThe International Inner Wheel objectives are (a) promoting true friendship, (b) encouraging the ideals of personal service, and (c) fostering international understanding."
