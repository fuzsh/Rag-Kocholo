        "text": "Last season was an anti-climax for SC Freiburg who were keen to build on their Europa League qualifying campaign to emerge as a serious contender in the top end of the table. Freiburg spent much of the season in the relegation zone and only a timely return to form that saw them win five of their last 10 games helped them avoid the drop. Much of the blame could be placed on a heavy turnover in the previous summer, with Freiburg selling off a number of their first choice players, including all of their central midfielders, while new signings took some time to gel together. However the team has enough quality to overcome a poor season and coach Christian Streich will be hoping for a far better season this time around. Streich though will be hoping for some movement in the final weeks of the transfer window with the squad being further weakened this summer. Freiburg's brightest hope Matthias Ginter has been sold to Borussia Dortmund while first choice keeper Oliver Baumann has also left the club for Hoffenheim. Gelson Fernandes has been sold after just one season at the club while Freiburg decided let end the loans of Vaclav Pilar and Francis Coquelin who have returned back to their respective clubs and Mike Hanke and Marco Terrazzino have been released. Freiburg though will be boosted by Admir Mehmedi's decision to turn his loan into a permanent move while Streich has also signed two new keepers, Werder Bremen's Sebastian Mielitz and Roman Burki from Grasshoppers. Freiburg have also boosted their defensive options by signing Marc-Oliver Kempf from Eintracht Frankfurt and Fulham's Sascha Riether though Stefan Mitrovic will be the one player to watch with the Serbian defender seen as an able alternative to Ginter. Streich has managed to keep his midfield together this season with Felix Klaus, Julian Schuster, Vladimir Darida and Jonathan Schmid expected to be the first choice midfielders. Darida will prove to be crucial for Freiburg's hopes for a good season, with the midfielder triggering an improvement in form following the winter break after having missed the first half of last season due to injury. Freiburg have been patchy in the pre-season but injuries permitting, Freiburg should enjoy a more successful season compared to last time around with a mid-table finish seen as a realistic expectation."
