He noted that starting teachers are offered $50,000 salaries in Plano, Texas, while the top salary is $46,000 for teachers with doctorates in the Oklahoma state schedule. He reminded us that teaching is a profession, not a service; and that communities are going to have to supplement state funding to keep teachers, must like local towns did a hundred years ago with one-room schoolhouses. Several options are proving successful elsewhere. Often the solutions are tied to keeping teachers in a community for a certain period of time so they are established and less likely to leave, Garn said.\n\nOne option is to set up a program to cover the education loans of teachers who teach a defined amount of years in the local school district. (Learn more at OU Debt-Free Teachers Program.)\n\nAnother is merit pay for teachers who invest in additional training and education. Several years ago Oklahoma agreed to pay teachers who achieved National Board Certification a $5,000 a year bonus, a promise it no longer keeps.\n\nGarn said one of the major problems facing teachers and schools is the basic needs of students are not being met when they arrive at school, so they are unable to learn from even the best teachers. He talked about a Tulsa study that shows \"community schools\" bring professionals to students and their families to close this gap to learning and benefit the community as a whole. He recommends a community start at the elementary level in lower income areas, and then once they gain traction, move to middle or high schools.\n\nAnother option is a program Garn said he is coordinating with Norman's Republic Bank so that teachers receive a down payment match to be able to afford a house in the community where they teach. This builds roots and wealth for full-time teachers, some of whom receive such low pay that they cannot afford to buy a house and their families participate in government assistance programs to make ends meet.\n\nAccording to Garn about 100 schools in Oklahoma have gone to a four-day school week which doesn't bode well for preparing our youth for work, post-secondary education and citizenship. He noted that South Dakota and Mississippi are behind Oklahoma on total compensation for teachers, but that Oklahoma ranks last in the nation for teacher salaries. He's particularly worried about smaller communities in the state that don't have the community leadership and resources like Norman to implement programs to retain teachers and strengthen education in their schools. He left the club with a strong statement that zip codes shouldn't determine destiny.\n\nStrengthening Schools and Communities 2017-02-09 06:00:00Z 0\n\n4-Way Speech\n\nRachel Maddy and Yannick Davidson presented their version of the 4-Way Speech on Tuesday.\n\nAfter serious deliberations by our judges, Yannick was declared the winner.

Principals Dr. Scott Beck and Dr.Peter Liesenfeld shared what Norman schools are doing to maximize the education experience for Norman students and the community at large.\n\nThe pair said it is not just about test scores. Under the direction of Dr. Siano, the they looked at a variety of factors including how kids feel when they come to school. They look at trust factors and they look at school process and community outreach. These and other non-tangible skills determine how students will flourish beyond school. They are teaching delayed gratification, tenacity, perseverance and grit. These are the skills students need when they go to college or join the workforce.\n\nDr. Beck explained how when more space was needed, school leaders seized the opportunity to do more than just add classroom space. Two of the most publicized areas have been Freshman Academies and College and Career Centers which should be complete by next yearâs term.\n\nDr. Beck said that Normanâs high schools are unique. They share a remarkable unity and yet each school can still maintain a unique identity. Each school designed their new spaces to fit the needs and personality of their school. At Norman High, they took what was formerly the library and made it into a space called the Learning Commons, which provided more of a collaborative space than before. This is a world class facility where students and teachers can come from all over campus and engage in collaborative work.\n\nDr. Liesenfeld said Norman Northâs College and Career Center offers a new media wing as well as lot of area for independent learning and growth, much like what students may experience after high school. He said the intent is not just to focus on those going to college, but also the business world. He added that both high schools are working on a mentorship program to connect students to specific individuals in the community.\n\nThe Freshman Academies extend the middle school philosophy and feel into the first year of high school. He said the purpose of the academy is to insulate 9th graders while still exposing them to all the offerings of high school. Dr. Liesenfeld said Normanâs high schools have a lot of offerings not often available in other communities.\n\nDr. Beck said the one-size-fits all instructional and supportive approach just doesnât work. Their goal is tailor the instructional needs to each individual student. That is what they each love about their district and what is being done in Norman schools.\n\nNorman's high school principals--A Dynamic Duo 2017-01-24 06:00:00Z 0\n\nChristi Moore and Sandy Tedder Receive their Paul Harris Plus Two Pins\n\nBob Dill presented Christi Moore and Sandy Tedder with their Paul Harris Plus Two Pins during our club meeting last Tuesday.\n\nChristi Moore and Sandy Tedder Receive their Paul Harris Plus Two Pins 2017-01-17 06:00:00Z 0\n\nOklahoma Sports Report\n\nDiane Murphree introduced this weekâs speaker as a âlocal treasure, an award-winning sports writer and just a good person.â Berry Tramel, entertained Sooner Rotarians during the January 17th meeting answering questions and sharing his comments on Oklahomaâs sports programs, individual players and the fans that follow them.\n\nTramel told Rotarians that the winning Oklahoma teams have experienced is not normal. He suggested fans have become spoiled by so much success. He said fans shouldnât gripe when things donât go our way but rather simply enjoy it when it does. He said the sports industry was created to entertain and enjoy and not to drag us down.\n\nNext Tramel answered questions from the audience in an insightful and candid manner. He was asked about personalities, Big 12 politics and even performance enhancing drugs.\n\nWhen asked about Russell Westbrook, Tramel called him âthe greatest show on earth,â and when asked if he thinks he would leave OKC, he quipped that maybe more people should tell Westbrook to leave, because he usually does the opposite of what people tell him to do.\n\nWhen quizzed about Brent Venablesâ head coach prospects, Tramel said some people wait for the right thing to come along and sometimes it never does. He also emphasized that sometimes âyou donât mess with happy.â He said too many people sacrifice happiness by chasing money or fame. He suggested maybe Venables is in a comfortable place right now.\n\nWhen asked, he gave his take on the problems faced by the Texas football program as well as his thoughts on the likeliness of attracting other great ball players to the Thunder. He told the group he didnât think performance enhancing drugs were as prevalent in the NBA because the season is too demanding. He brought laughter as he qualified the statement saying he couldnât make the same claim about marijuana.\n\nFinally, when asked about his opinion on whether OU or OSU would win the conference championship next year, he said he thinks OU will win. He said they usually play well against OSU; He laughed and said âthereâs no point spitting in the wind.â\n\nTramel wrapped things up telling the group that he attributes his love of writing and sports to his father who subscribed to four newspapers while he was growing up. He said he developed an aptitude for reading and writing early in life. âI literally have the best job in the stateâand that is something I donât take lightlyâ. He said âI love what I do, Iâm good at what I do and I think I was born to do what I do.â\n\nOklahoma Sports Report 2017-01-17 06:00:00Z 0\n\nStacy Bruce - New Bridges Director\n\nThank you Jonna Buck for writing this article for our website!\n\nStacy Bruce, the new Executive Director of Bridges was our guest speaker Tuesday, January 10th. Stacy left her position at the Cleveland County YMCA after almost 20 years to pursue a new goal, to serve the students at Bridges. Stacy loved everything about her job at the YMCA, but after the retirement of Debra Krittenbrink, Stacy felt a new calling.\n\nShe began researching the Bridges program and after much soul searching, she decided to leave the security of her career for the opportunity to help fulfill the Bridgesâ missionâ¦..âEmpowering high school students in family crisis to pursue education without obstacles.â\n\nStacy told us about reflecting on her school years and thinking she never had the challenges these students face. There are many scenarios that leave these students homeless through no fault of their own. One of the most common challenges they see is having no identification or birth certificateâ¦ things most teens take for granted. Bridges helps obtain these things and so much more, helping them live, continue school and learn to function as an adult.\n\nBridges students pay their own electric bills and pay rent on a sliding scale. They are required to have a job of up to 20 hours per week, because students must attend school and maintain passing grades. Students meet weekly for life skills classes that help them succeed living on their own. They also receive mentoring from adults in the community. Stacy said even though these kids come from a lot of sadness, there is a lot of laughter and happiness at Bridges.\n\nStacy thanked Sooner Rotary for all their support through the years and challenged us to âRise Upâ with her to provide continued support from the community. She reminded us there are many opportunities to help through donations, volunteering and financial contributions. She asked us to consider attending one of their biggest fundraisers of the year, the Bridges Prom February 11th.\n\nStacy brings a lot of passion to the Bridges program and helps provide love and compassion to students often overlooked by others.

Thirty students at Adams Elementary and another thirty students at Reagan Elementary participated.\n\nVolunteers from Sooner Rotary provided their time and reading materials, while the Reading Specialists at each school identified students that could benefit from the program. The books were purchased using a generous grant from Rotary District #5770. The grant provided each student participant with seven “forever” books. These books were read at school with the volunteers, and then given to the students for them to take home and share with family and friends.\n\nSooner Rotary purchased reading materials through Scholastic Corporation. Scholastic has a literary initiative designed for young readers. The third grade program is a mentoring partnership to urge young students to Read, Excel, Achieve, Lead (REAL). Volunteers from the Sooner Rotary conducted the program twice per month from October 2015 - March 2016.\n\nGretchen Slate the Reading Specialist at Adams spoke of the project’s impact. “The third graders have thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the Rotary Book Club. The enthusiasm that the students gained and showed for reading was amazing. The students couldn't wait until our next book club meeting to see what new book they were going to receive. So many students don't have a home library to enjoy so this was a wonderful experience for students to be able to start that essential tool. Students loved having Mr. O'Hare and the other Rotary volunteers visit and discuss literature with them. It is always nice to see community members in our school. It reminds not only the teachers, but the students as well, that people care about them and want to see them achieve. I can only hope that this is a new tradition for Adams All-Stars!”\n\nThe Sooner Rotary volunteers for this program were: Polly Christian, Denise Kueny, Fred Benenati, Dave Mason, Ryan Veirs, Lucinda Francis, Jeanine Baker, Glenda Thomas, Harry Smith, Marles Bradley, Mary Sallee, Michelle Hohlier, Sandra Longcrier, and Jack & Sue O’Hare.\n\nSooner Rotary Completes the REAL Program in Two Norman Elementary Schools Michelle Hohlier 2016-03-24 05:00:00Z 0\n\nLoveworks Leadership\n\nThis morning, our club had a hands on opportunity to learn about the Loveworks Leadership program. Daniel Smith and Carolyn Le of Loveworks kicked off our meeting with a ten minute challenge - Build the tallest structure we can out of spaghetti sticks, yarn, tape and a marshmallow, the kicker was that the marshmallow had to be at the top. We worked in small groups of five and communicated how to build the structure! It was fun, and collaborative and only a few tables were successful in their build.\n\nLater in the discussion, we learned that Loveworks is an organization that helps people discover their potential and live into their dreams. They offer an afterschool program, leadership training, community initiatives and summer camps - their goal is to transform lives.

Today more than ever, I am extremely proud to be a Sooner Rotarian. It is one of my “foundation” activities, that I chose not because of my vocation but because of my commitment to community and service, to be part of for the remainder of my life time.\n\n\"The (Washington Post) article focused on the “fumbling of our country” to accept this unpopular position that was never voted for by the people of this country. It is a topic about which people have very strong feelings. For many, it is uncomfortable. Just as it is in our small community, it is for our nation. Thank you again for the opportunity to breathe energy into the topic with hopes that even though we may never agree, we can at least exercise civility, love, and respect. I am proud to be a Sooner Rotarian, perhaps today more than ever.\"\n\nEXPERIENCE WITH WASHINGTON POST 2015-03-06 00:00:00Z 0\n\nBUTTERFIELD SPEAKS\n\nThis morning, following an amazing preview by The Sooner Theater's Addams Family cast, OU's Dr. Kevin Butterfield shared an impressive, condensed account of the impact of early American \"joiners\" on our Republic.

The club was reminded of the Membership Drive and the drawing for an IPAD for those who bring guests.\n\nOpportunities to sign up for the dinner honoring the incoming Rotary International President, Ron Burton on March 3 were given. Everyone was encouraged to participate in the once in a lifetime event.\n\nWe also had the honor and privilege of celebrating the introduction of Norman’s Philharmonic Orchestra Director, Richard Zielinski.

Lynn Droescher 2012-01-28 00:00:00Z 0\n\nJanuary Catch-Up\n\nIt has been a busy two weeks for Norman Sooner Rotary. Meetings on Tuesday morning have been informative regarding the many service projects being sponsored within the club. A mini- support drive for our soldiers, a book drive for our Norman Seniors and Lunch Buddies Fellowships have given members great opportunities to fellowship and provide support to those in need. For those who have not been able to attend our Tuesday morning meetings, these activities would be a great time to âmake-upâ.\n\nJanuary Catch-Up Lynn Droescher 2012-01-24 00:00:00Z 0\n\nFocus: Committees Meeting\n\nNorman Sooner Rotary started the New Year with committees meeting to evaluate their activities to date and plan for the coming months.

I could give excuses, but basically it boils down to not making time to get it done.\n\nThe last two meetings of December were all time favorites of the club. Our annual \"Joe Grizzell\" meeting was again a thought provoker. Joe's list for Christmas reminded us of the need to give thanks in everything, even if we have to look for what is worthy of our thanks. The reminder that our expectations can limit what we see as blessings explained through Joe's life story was touching. Wonder how our lists (and our attitudes) were changed while listening?\n\nOnce more Norman Sooner Rotary made good on reaching our goal of learning more about our fellow club members on the December 27th meeting. Everyone joined a group and related personal experiences and thoughts of Christmas' past. Exploring the hearts and minds of such an ecclectic group is surely entertaining. I am sure everyone had unique stories of one sort or another to relate.
