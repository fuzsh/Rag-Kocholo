Sydney Technical High School; joined NSW police force 1941; detective 1950; officer-in-charge CIB Drug Squad 1963-77; aware of NSW police secret telephone tapping and taping procedures from their initiation 1967; Inspector 1974; Superintendent 1978; Assistant Commissioner (Crime) 1979; investigated roles of Magistrate Murray Frederick Farquhar, solicitor Morgan John Ryan, and Police Commissioner Mervyn Thomas Wood in Cessna-Milner drug case but apparently did not inquire whether any secret taped material on the case was available, 1979; in August 1980, following recommendations by Homicide chief Inspector Harry Tupman and CIB chief Superintendent Ray Goldsworthy that police question Albert Jaime Grassby, Federal Commissioner for Community Relations, and State (Labor) MP Michael Maher about a 'scurrillous' document (inferring that Mrs Barbara Mackay, her son Paul, and her solicitor lan Salmon had conspired to kill Donald Bruce Mackay) that Grassby had asked Maher to read out under privilege in Parliament, advised that he saw no reason to pursue recommendations, according to evidence given (September 1986) at Special Commission of Inquiry into NSW police investigation of murder of Mackay; Deputy Police Commissioner William Allan Ruthven Allen having fallen by wayside, succeeded James Travers Lees as Police Commissioner 29 December 1981; said no action would be taken on recommendation of Magistrate Bruce Brown that aspects of Enmore conspiracy case be further investigated, June 1982; reduced size of Internal Affairs Branch June 1982; declared his complete opposition Justice Edwin Augustus Lusher's recommendation (April 1981) for a partly civilian three-man Police Board to run force, 24 January 1983; Premier Neville Kenneth Wran said no further action would be taken following Abbott's investigation of role of Cabinet Minister Rex Frederick Jackson in prisoner early release scheme and his recommendation that no criminal action be taken, and that Royal Commission or judicial inquiry was not warranted, 11 October 1983; described by Wran as a man with 'a reputation as a fearless investigator', 16 October 1983; tipped to take early retirement when Wran announced Lusher's recommendation on Police Board would be implemented, November 1983; instructed Superintendent R.C. Shepherd to investigate allegations in National Times of 25 November 1983 relating to unlawful interception of telephone conversations; Shepherd's report (9 December 1983) that only telephone intercepts, in which NSW police were involved were those in which Federal Police had taken out a warrant described (April 1986) as 'blatantly untrue, both to the knowledge of Shepherd and Abbott' by Justice Donald Gerard Stewart; invoked his powers to suppress report of police investigation for Ombudsman of complaints by Edgar John Azzopardi, April 1984; joined other Police Board members Sir Maurice Hearne Byers and Sir Ronald Gordon Jackson in recommending he be succeeded by Superintendent John Keith Avery, July 1984; retired 6 August 1984.\n\nABELES, Sir Emil Herbert Peter , b. 24 April, 1924; ed. Budapest; founded Alltrans Pty Ltd 1950; managing director Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd since 1967; Knighted 1972; joint chief executive (with K.R. Murdoch) Ansett Transport Industries 1979-82; and joint chairman with Murdoch since 1982.\n\nABOOD, Camelle , clerk to Chief Stipendiary Magistrate Murray Frederick Farquhar at time of committal hearing of fraud charges against Kevin Emery Humphreys, August 11-12, 1977; handled Farquhar's betting transactions, and observed that horserace tips supplied to him by George David Freeman were for winners 98 to 99 per cent of the time.\n\nALEXANDER, Brian William , b. 5 April 1939; an only child, his parents separated when he was 10; he was then reared by his paternal aunt; ed. St Anne's Marist Brothers' School, Bondi, but did not matriculate; became a law clerk and protege of Phil Roach, a solicitor with a large criminal, including prostitution, practice at magistrates courts level, mostly at the Central Court of Petty Sessions; worked for Roach for nearly 20 years, to 1975; February 1983 report of the Stewart Royal Commission on Drug Trafficking (Mr Asia heroin syndicate] states: 'Through (the Roach connection), Alexander became well known to and by a large number of Sydney criminals, both convicted and un-convicted, and consequently by a large number of New South Wales Police officers. As drug-related crimes began to increase he also became professionally associated with this class of criminal, and with police engaged in drug enforcement, including members of State police drug squads, members of the then Federal Narcotics Bureau, and Customs officers'; left Roach 1975 and went to work as a law clerk for another solicitor, John Lawrence Aston, taking with him part of the 'good will' of the Roach practice, including a large number of clients who were petty criminals, along with matters relating to drug offences. Stewart reported: 'Any large organisation requires the assistance of lawyers in order to operate successfully. This assistance may be legitimate but if often involves unlawful or unethical practices. The Clark [Mr Asia heroin syndicate, operating in Australia 1976-1979] organisation was no different from other criminal syndicates in that part of its method of operation was the employment of experienced criminal lawyers ... The lawyers in Sydney generally used by the Clark organisation were Aston and his law clerk Brian Alexander ... There are three main areas in which lawyers assisted the organisation: representation, financial dealings, and (as) purveyors of information'; along with narcotics agents Richard John Spencer and Wayne John Brindle, Alexander appeared before C.A. Gilmore SM at the Phillip Street Court of Petty Sessions on 27 March 1980, charged with having conspired during 1978 and 1979 with each other and with Terrence John Clark and others to pervert the course of justice by unlawfully disclosing to Clark information received by Spencer and Brindle in connection with the importation of drugs; counsel for Alexander were Michael Grove QC and Ian Strathdee, instructed by Messrs Howard Hilton and Keddie; counsel for Spencer were Kevin Murray QC and M.A. Coleman, instructed by Aston; counsel for Brindle was Strathdee, instructed by Aston; David Bennett QC, with F.V. Fletcher, for the Crown, produced 81 witnesses; Gilmore SM said he had not come to the opinion that a prima facie case had been established against any of Alexander, Spencer or Brindle, and they were discharged, 7 May 1980; Stewart reported that the proceedings had 'severely discredited (Alexander's) integrity and, through him, that of the firm of Aston. It was one of the reasons Alexander subsequently left that employment and it presented an insurmountable barrier to his obtaining similar employment in Sydney. It also placed a great strain on his failing (second) marriage and his general health and did not assist an already well established drinking habit'; last job at a hotel; in period before December 1981, did not appear to have the use of large sums of money, and had recently received a demand from the Tax Office for a sum in excess of $60,000; last seen 22 December 1981; anonymous telephone call to Vaucluse police said a car [Alexander's] had been 'dumped' at Military Road, Watsons Bay some 'two weeks previously', 14 January 1982; a cliff known as The Gap, scene of several suicides, in the area led to suggestions of suicide; Stewart considered four possibilities: Alexander had disappeared voluntarily; he had disappeared under duress and may be alive or dead; he had been murdered and his body secreted; he had suicided. He reported: '...opinion evidence supports the contention that Alexander has voluntarily disappeared. His close relatives and associates dismiss the suggestion of suicide as being completely out of character for him even taking into account his marital situation, his employment and social prospects, his drinking, his financial situation, and his knowledge of his probable appearance before this Commission. Certainly they are of the opinion that if he were to suicide it would not be by violent means but rather by way of something painless and comfortable like the ingestion of sleeping pills ... A person who sufficiently feared disclosures by Alexander to this Commission would have a motive to murder him. Those feared disclosures might of course not even relate to Clark of his associates ... On the other hand ... he could as -easily be paid to stay out of touch...'\n\nALISTER, Paul Shaun , b. 1956; member of Ananda Marga; sentenced by Justice Jack Austell Lee to 16 years for conspiring to murder National Front leader Robert Cameron in June 1978; pardoned May 1985.\n\nALLAN, Norman Thomas William , b.

You can get things done here. It is easier than Perth', 2 April 1979; political contacts reported to have included former NSW ALP secretary Graham Richardson, former Minister for Planning and Environment Eric Bedford, president (1979-83) of NSW Labor Party Paul Keating, and former prisons minister Rex Jackson; employed Thomas Christopher Domican 1981-82; began a connection with Japanese construction group Kumagai Gumi 1985; largest single investor Sydney central business district 1986.\n\nARANTZ, Philip , b. 1929; Sergeant in police computer section; dismissed without pension from NSW police force 1972 for informing The Sydney Morning Herald that Commissioner Norman Allan falsified crime clear-up rates; Wran Government reported to be looking at his case November 1976; accepted compensation said to be $250,000 on condition that he was not re-instated in the force, and that he promised not to engage in further public debate on the issue, January 1985; the Arantz affair described as a 'prismatic case' by law lecturer Gill Boehringer, who was writing a book on it, 'When you look through a prism, you see a lot of things you don't always see', January 1985.\n\nASKIN, Hon. Sir Robert William , b. Robin William Askin, April 4, 1909 Glebe; son of tram driver, lived Lyndhurst Street, Glebe until 1931; bank clerk; married Mollie Underhill 5 February 1937; bookmaker 2nd 31st battalion World War II; MLA (Lib) Collaroy 1950-1975; deputy leader NSW Opposition. 1954-1959; leader 1959-1965; Premier and Treasurer 30 April 1965-3 January 1975; KCMO 1972, GCMG 1975; instructed Superintendent to 'drive over the bastards' when his car was halted by Vietnam war demonstrators during US President Lyndon Johnson's procession in Sydney, July 1966; veteran Labor politician Patrick Darcy Hills later (March 1986) told Parliament that in 1967 senior police were found being entertained in Chinese gambling club, also alleged to be drug distribution centre, in Dixon Street, said Askin promoted one of the policemen [identified by Sun-Herald reporter Graham Gambie as late George Barnes) from Chief Superintendent to Assistant Commissioner a few days before he retired so he could go out with much greater superannuation payment; Gambie identified the other policeman as Frederick John Hanson, Police Commissioner 1972-76; his private account in name Robin W. Askin at Rural Bank reported (by David Hickie, 1985) to have received cheque for $20,000 signed by Elton Reginald Griffin, managing director Boral Ltd, at time Griffin knighted (Kt.), at recommendation of Askin Government, 'for services to commerce and industry' in Her Majesty's birthday honours list, June 1970; former newspaper publisher Maxwell Newton later (26 March 1984) stated that in 1970 he delivered $15,000 in brown paper bag to Askin's office on behalf of Filipino businessman who hoped Askin would approve plan to build jai lai stadium; Newton said, 'I told him who it was from and I've never seen $15,000 disappear so quickly in my life. He took the money and whipped it into the top drawer of his desk, and said, \"That's very kind of him; I'm deeply grateful\" (but, Newton said, 'I'm afraid Bob didn't deliver'); joined Sir Peter Abeles and Sir Arthur George on board of Thomas Nationwide Transport (TNT) 16 February 1976; Labor MLA Heathcoate Clifford Mallam, calling in Parliament on Wran Government to appoint select committee to investigate operations of a 'Mafia' comprised of crooked company directors, many of them close to Askin, which he said had been operating for many years, said: 'I refer to that organisation known as Askin's Knights or the Hungarian Mafia. Many of these crooked company directors use every loophole in the law to see that investigations into their affairs take as long as possible and hopefully are forgotten ... Many of them travelled overseas with him. He even took some of them behind the Iron Curtain', 24 March 1977; Attorney-General Francis Walker, asked whether 'Sir Paul Strasser's knighthood [Kt., 1973] by the Askin Government was for services to the building industry, and did those services include obtaining huge sums of money from the NSW State Superannuation Fund for investment in the Police headquarters and CAGA House?' replied that the citation was for services to building industry and in mineral and oil exploration field, 26 March 1977; otherwise reported that the fund had advanced $6 million to Strasser's Parkes Developments as a first mortgage on building projects; Askin denied he had anything to do with Parkes; Independent MLA John Hatton said in Parliament, '...under the Askin Government in the 1960s and particularly the late 1960s the real penetration of organised crime by overseas gangsters, mobsters and Mafia took place. Shopfront gambling and rackets came of age. Large corporate frauds, consumer cheating, securities frauds and prostitution became rife, and in some ways have continued. I have no doubt that ex-Premier Askin and [former Police Commissioner Frederick John] Hanson knew and may have even encouraged these activities', 16 August 1979; Askin replied that he was free of any involvement in criminal activity, had been right throughout his political career, and said, 'When I first took office as Premier, Police Commissioner [Norman] Allan saw me and asked what my policy was about organised crime. I asked him what the policy had been under the previous [Labor] Government. He said: \"We have no chance of eliminating these illegal activities and we do our best to keep them under control.\" So I said that seemed to be the best course to follow'; died 9 September 1981; cremated 14 September; under headline: ASKIN: FRIEND TO ORGANISED CRIME, David Hickie reported in The National Times 13 September 1981, 'According to a very reliable source in the old [Percival John] Galea empire, Askin and Hanson were paid approximately $100,000 each in bribes a year from the end of the Sydney gang wars in 1967-68 until Askin's retirement. The source is impeccable'; reaction mixed: some said bad taste; others that truth often in bad taste; Premier Wran said report 'tasteless in the extreme', agreed that the allegations may have been well known to many Sydney people for many years, but the substance had not been, and he [Wran] himself had never been slow to investigate allegations of corruption, even if they were to detriment of his own party, but 'I am certainly not going to dig up corpses and engage in that sort of thing'; the Most Reverend Sir Marcus Lawrence Loane, Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, delivering occasional address at Askin's funeral service 14 September at St Andrew's cathedral, said Askin had a strict code of right and wrong, and integrity as a statesman; Opposition leader Bruce John McDonald said it was disgraceful and despicable; Police Minister William Frederick Farrar Crabtree said he thought it was out of taste of all Australians; after the cremation, former Liberal Premier Sir Eric Archibald Willis said it was disgusting to print such a thing about a man not even cold in his grave; Labor MHR Dr Richard Emanuel Klugman said, '-there ought to be laws to protect the dead, perhaps allowing the estate to sue'; Labor Senator Nick Bolkus asked, 'In the light of these allegations, will the Tax Commissioner be looking into the affairs of the late Sir Robert Askin's estate?' Lady (Mollie) Askin said National Times people were 'utter curs', and, 'it is a rehash of everything that has been said before, and all of it has been proved totally incorrect'; advertising person John Singleton said, 'I hope that some time I get a chance to have a little yarn with that man from The National Times, that little cowardly person who wrote that attack on Bob Askin yesterday, free of facts, just the smears and innuendoes of a petty mind, and to think the once great Fairfax empire could stoop to such gutter, gutless journalism is to me sickening, and I'm sure that's a sentiment that will be shared by every fair-thinking person'; Peter Gannon, of Goulburn, noted, 'none of the accusations has been denied'; The Herald [Melbourne] said, '...the bigger question remains: is the report accurate?... If the charges are true, the public has a right to know what has been done in their name'; Paul Lynch, editor of Uniting Church newspaper Forward, said the de mortuis nil nisi bonum [(say) nothing but good of the dead] argument 'would apply in such cases as the publication of name-blackening stories on matters of little substance. The grip that organised crime has gained on NSW over the past 15 years is no small matter'; revealed that Askin had left an estate of $1,957,995, mostly to his widow, 24 February 1982; retired US Admiral Earl (Buddy) Yates, former president of Nugan Hand Bank, said he accepted the position on advice of Askin and senior Sydney bank officer, said he trusted Askin's opinion about bank's principals, Frank Nugan and Michael Hand, because Askin knew them well and shared an office with them in Macquarie Street, September 1982; Premier Wran supported claims that corrupt practices were allowed to flourish under Askin Government, said almost everything his Government had done - establishing a Police Board, cracking down on drugs, setting up internal security unit to deal with corrupt police should have been done years before, 25 March 1984; his widow died, leaving estate of $3,724,879 (bequests including $100,000 to an executor and trustee of the estate, John Ivan Charody), 26 March 1984; Askin home at 86 Dower Street, Manly, in which he and Lady Askin had lived for 11 years, sold at auction for $465,000, 30 October 1984; Abraham Gilbert Saffron stood behind a pillar at the auction, but David Harris, of L.J. Hooker, Manly, said Saffron was not buyer; when Hickie's book on Askin, The Prince and the Premier, was published, Liberal Opposition leader Nicholas Greiner said coalition would support Royal Commission on Askin Government provided it achieved something substantial, and that he suspected at least some allegations of corruption during Askin era were true; Federal Director of Public Prosecutions Ian Douglas Temby QC confirmed that legal teams had been established in five States to co-ordinate seizure of millions of dollars of property from known or suspected criminals, including Askin, Robert Trimbole, Bruce Richard (Snapper) Cornwall, and Brian Maher, 19 February 1986; in Askin's case, TNT shares worth more than $300,000 and his house at Manly were believed to have been sold to go towards outstanding tax bill of $2 million; Brian Watt, of Permanent Trustee Co Ltd, co-executor of Lady Askin's will, denied reports that house was sold to meet tax debt, said it was owned by Lady Askin and was thus not subject to claims based on Askin's tax debts; Premier Wran, asked if he believed Askin was a crook, replied, 'Yes', 1 May, 1986.\n\nASTON, John Lawrence , b. 9 November 1933 as Lawrence J. Reid; adopted 1947; solicitor March 1957; partner in firm of solicitors Barkell & Peacock until July 1976 when he began a practice under his own name at 54 Park Street Sydney; solicitor for Kevin Emery Humphreys 1976-77; Stewart Royal Commission on Drug Trafficking [Mr Asia] reported, 'When [Mr Asia head Terrence John] Clark arrived in Australia early in 1976 ... there is evidence before the Commission that Clark and others of his group asked Australian criminals with whom they associated the name of the best lawyer for them to use in Sydney. Many of these criminals recommended John Lawrence Aston ... Clark became a client of Aston's firm ... Three allegations have been levelled at Aston. One, that he was involved with the Clark [Mr Asia] organisation; two, that he was involved with the Nugan Hand organisation which he used to transfer or 'launder' funds for the Clark organisation; and three, that he is or was closely and improperly associated with members of the New South Wales Police Force and the now disbanded Federal Narcotics Bureau. Research by the Commission has shown that in many instances Aston was implicated in the above matters through the activities of [Brian William] Alexander ... Aston appears to be well known to several narcotics agents and members of the New South Wales Police and he has acted as solicitor for ex-narcotics officer Richard John Spencer, among others. Both Aston and Alexander were mentioned by Douglas and Isabel Wilson on the tape-recorded interviews taken in Brisbane in June 1978. James William Duff, a Detective Sergeant of police attached to the Sydney Homicide Squad, is a close personal friend of Aston and was also friendly with Alexander. From 24 April 1981 until 5 May 1981 Duff and his wife stayed at Aston's holiday home in Honolulu. He [Duff] also confirmed in evidence to the Commission that he had incorrectly referred to himself as a company director when leaving for New Guinea in October 1980, even though he was in fact a police officer. Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Mr J.R. Hall and his investigators told the Commission they had been frustrated in their dealing in 1979 with matters concerning Aston and Alexander. They said the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department in Canberra had refused to allow them to search Aston's office or to arrest Alexander and that Alexander and Aston appeared to receive favourable treatment from some members of the New South Wales Police.' Stewart recommended, 'the evidence concerning the use of fictitious names in (Aston's) trust account should be made available to the Law Society of New South Wales to allow it to take such action thereon as it may he advised...'; Aston not struck off the rolls of solicitors, but did not renew his practising certificate; in Port Moresby, at a Commission of Inquiry investigating multi-million aircraft deals involving the Australian aviation company, Peldale, and alleged political intervention in a search for drugs in one of its planes, the then Prime Minister of Papua and New Guinea, Michael Somare, examined on his association with two men connected with Peldale, Aston and John Johnson, said he had been introduced to Johnson in 1979, and had subsequently discussed proposal for joint international freight service and seafood export, but plans did not work out; that in 1984 he talked with Aston and Johnson in Sydney about the PNG Government's wish to sell a luxury jet aircraft bought by the previous government; Aston and Johnson had subsequently gone to PNG to introduce representatives of Israeli Aircraft Industries, manufacturers of an Arava aircraft that PNG bought in 1985 for $A6.62 million; asked if he knew Aston had been adversely mentioned at the Stewart Commission, Somare said: 'If I had known that I would not have been talking to him'; said he had taken Aston and Johnson on good faith because they were associated with the reputable Australian company, TNT, and that his attitude to Peldale would have been different had he known that its predecessor, Wings Australia, had gone into liquidation in 1984 with reported debts of $15 million, 9 October 1985.\n\nAVERY, John Keith , b. Hornsby 7 August 1927; joined NSW police force 12 April 1948; never a member of the Criminal Investigation Branch; country police stations, Currabubula, Port Macquarie, Tenterfield 1949-1967; station sergeant Chatswood 1967; officer in charge of Police Training, Development and Examination Branch, May 1978; author of Police - Force or Service? 1981 ; gave evidence to Police Tribunal that in 1981 Sergeant Warren Molloy told him that Deputy Commissioner Bill Allen had tried to give him money, presumably to try to improperly influence his work as a licensing sergeant, 1982; appointed Police Commissioner on recommendation of Police Board, 6 August 1984; asked in December 1984: 'Will you go after crooked police of the past, like Fred Krahe, who was alleged to have murdered Shirley Brifman?' he replied: 'If there is no legal statute of limitation, there'll be no police statute.

She was a wholly unsatisfactory witness. She feigned an attitude of contrived candour in the witness box. She was deeply involved emotionally with Mr Farquhar but, even making every allowance for this, she was unusually reckless in her handling of the truth. Her evidence was plainly, both in its content and in her demeanour, consistent only with a determination on her part to say nothing at all that she believed might be harmful to Mr Farquhar and, on the other hand, to say what she thought would assist him.
