        "text": "When this group of 11 and 12 year olds practiced their skills in the summer of 1975, the possibility of claiming a national title was something for them to dream about. The first step along their way to making that dream a reality was claiming the District Three title which they did in a seven team playoff, defeating the Current River Americans 1-0 in a sudden death final.\n\nNext up was the All Ontario Major Little League Championships. Winning their opening game in Brockville with a decisive 8-1 score against Windsor, their 3-1 defeat of Toronto earned them entry into the final against Ottawa. A nail biting, 5-4, extra inning game saw Port Arthur emerge as Ontario Champions.\n\nTraveling straight to Calgary to compete in the Canadian championships, the team finished round robin play with a record of 2 and 2. Defeating Lethbridge in a high scoring 17-9 semi final, they were one step away from reaching their dream, with the hometown favourites standing between them and the title. Entering the 6th and final inning with a 6 run advantage, Calgary's attempt to rally back fell short, with Port Arthur claiming a 6-2 victory to become the first and only team to date, from northwestern Ontario ever to claim a Canadian Major Little League title. With no trip to the World Series available for a Canadian team that year this group of young athletes had proudly reached the highest level possible in their sport.\n\nBack (L R): Doug Cameron (Manager), Terry Tuomaala (Coach).\n\nMiddle(L R): Barry Niemi, Ian Tetley, Rob McCracken, Tom Baxter, John Reid,\n\nDanny Mauro, Gordon Malcolm, Dennis Mounk, Steven Dick.\n\nFront (L R): Glen Wilson, Jeff Backen, Dallas Allaire, David Perger, Jeff Beitz.\n\nInducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, September 24, 2005"
