        "text": "Gary L. Jenson, age 69 of rural South Wayne, WI, passed away on Friday, August 2, 2024, at the SSM Health Hospice Home in Monroe, WI after a brief, but courageous battle with cancer. The son of Lewis and Naomi (Chapman) Jenson, Gary was born on June 25, 1955, in Darlington, WI. He grew up in a family of 22 children on a dairy farm, where he developed his work ethic and love of the outdoors. He graduated from Darlington High School in 1973. Gary went on to have a long career with Ruf's Farm Service for over 37 years until his retirement in 2017. The Rufs became a second family to Gary, and he enjoyed spending time with them.\n\nGary was united in marriage to Eunice Olsen on July 3, 1976, at the East Wiota Church. Together they had two sons, Matthew and Justin. Gary was a proud father and grandfather and enjoyed spending time with his family. An avid outdoorsman, you could always find Gary hunting, fishing, golfing, or cultivating the land around his home. Gary always had an impressive garden, sharing his produce with many. He was a dedicated Green Bay Packer fan and enjoyed sharing hunting stories with his friends and family. Gary was a member of the Wiota Lutheran Church.\n\nGary is survived by his wife, Eunice, of 48 years; son, Matthew (Rachel) Jenson of Monroe, WI, and son, Justin (Kelsey) Jenson of Monticello, WI; grandchildren Caleb, Callee, and Carrah of Monroe, WI and Juliette, Jett, and Jolie of Monticello, WI. He is also survived by 5 sisters and 15 brothers, many brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, nieces, nephews, and extended family members. Gary was preceded in death by his parents, Eunice's parents Lewis and Wilma, his sister Lorrie Jenson and one brother-in-law Dave Cowell.\n\nGary was a great friend who was always willing to lend a hand. He never shied away from hard work and instilled those same values in his sons and family. His final years of retirement were spent visiting with friends, building a new home with Eunice, and planning future adventures.\n\nA funeral service will be held Saturday, August 10, 2024, at 11:00 A.M. at Wiota Lutheran Church in rural Wiota with Pastor Dennis Perger officiating.
