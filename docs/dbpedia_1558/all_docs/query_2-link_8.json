        "text": "Brandon A. Suthers, age 25, of Monroe passed away on Sunday, July 28, 2024 at his home surrounded by his family. He was born on January 2, 1999 the son of Kevin and Nancy (Jacobson) Suthers.\n\nBrandon loved football and was an avid Chicago Bears fan. He had a love for speed whether it was riding the ranger with his step-dad, zooming around in his motorized wheelchair, or simply enjoying a ride in the car. Brandon also enjoyed music and fishing. Above all, his greatest moments were those spent surrounded by his family.
