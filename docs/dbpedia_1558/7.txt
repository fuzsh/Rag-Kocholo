In this winter’s transfer window, several Slovenian footballers have temporarily moved to work in Austria. Among them is Miha Kancilija, a former member of Bravo in Ljubljana, who has played 51 matches in the Prva liga Telemach. The 22-year-old winger bid farewell to the second-league team Krka after the autumn part of the current season and will now play for the Austrian fourth-league club SV Wildon.

The club from the smaller town near Lipnica in southern Austria is currently in a high second place in the Landesliga Steiermark, with the leader Fehring having only two points more. SV Wildon will be competing for promotion to the third league in the spring, and interestingly, Miha Kancilija, a former youth national team player, will not be the only Slovenian helping them towards their goal.

Playing for SV Wildon are already veteran Jure Travner (who has played 290 matches in the 1. SNL), Denis Perger (who was also a member of Drava and Koper, as well as Parma and Freiburg), Fran Šlamberger (who developed his skills at Maribor in his younger years), Robert Pušaver (a two-time national champion with Maribor), and Gal Zorko (who was nurtured in Celje).
