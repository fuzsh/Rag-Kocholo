        "text": "In case you missed it, the Danish royal family is about to get a glow-up. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark surprised the world by announcing in her New Year's Eve address her abdication from the throne on January 14, 2024. After an impressive 52-year reign, the 83-year-old monarch is passing the royal baton to her son, Crown Prince Frederik, who will ascend to the throne as King.\n\nJoining him in this new chapter is his Australian-born wife, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, marking the beginning of an exciting era for the Danish monarchy.\n\nBut who else is part of this royal family? Get ready for a royal rundown as we introduce you to the Danish royals, from seasoned rulers to the youngest heirs.\n\nQueen Margrethe II: A Reign to Remember\n\nDenmark's royal lineage, tracing back to Gorm the Old in 958, is one of the oldest monarchies globally, with Queen Margrethe II at its helm. Born in 1940, she holds the record as Denmark's longest-reigning monarch.\n\nHowever, her journey wasn't without its quirksâ€”her early years earned her the moniker 'Ashtray Queen' due to her fondness for cigarettes.\n\nRELATED:\n\nRoyal insiders say Princess Mary and Prince Frederik at 'freezing point' amid Queen's abdication\n\nMary, Crown Princess of Denmark: Australia celebrates an unexpected queen\n\nDanish Royal House Announces New Titles amid Queen Margrethe's Shock Abdication\n\nQueen Margrethe and her husband, Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark, shared a marriage that spanned over 50 years, however, a notable point of contention arose due to his title. Before passing in 2018, he reportedly harboured significant resentment over being designated Prince Consort instead of the more traditional title of King Consort.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary: A Global Love Story\n\nCrown Prince Frederik, set to ascend the throne, is the son of Queen Margrethe and the late Prince Consort Henrik.\n\nBorn in 1968, he became the Crown Prince of Denmark at the tender age of 4. Prince Frederik has put his hand to various fields over the years, from UN service to military training. His passion for environmentalism shines through, co-authoring a book on climate change politics.\n\nThe royal's chance meeting with Tasmania's Mary Donaldson during the 2000 Sydney Olympics blossomed into a love story, culminating in their marriage on May 14, 2004.\n\nThe Next Generation\n\nPrince Christian, oldest son of Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik, represents a new era, recently turning 18 and shouldering increasing royal responsibilities.\n\nThe young Prince will assume the title of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Christian following his father's coronation.\n\nHis sister, Princess Isabella, born in 2007, follows closely as the third in line for the throne.\n\nShe is the second child and elder daughter of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary and the fourth grandchild and oldest granddaughter of Queen Margrethe II and the late Prince Henrik.\n\nThe youngest siblings, twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, born in 2011, are the fourth and fifth in line to the throne.\n\nThe 12-year-old twins reside with their family at two Danish royal residences: Amalienborg in Copenhagen and the Chancellery House at Fredensborg Palace, located on the eastern shore of Lake Esrum.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie\n\nPrince Joachim, the younger son of Queen Margrethe, has had a lengthy and successful military career. After his first marriage to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, with whom he shares two children, ended, he found love again with Marie Cavallier.\n\nTogether, they share two children: Henrik and Athena. However, the decision to strip all four children of their royal titles, as requested by Queen Margrethe, stirred controversy in 2023.\n\nIndeed, Nikolai, 23, Felix, 20, Henrik, 13, and Athena, 10 lost their prince or princess titles and \"His/Her Highness\" styling, which they inherited at birth as Queen Margrethe II's grandchildren. According to the updated Danish Royal House website, the siblings are now known as His Excellency Count of Monpezat or Her Excellency Countess of Monpezat.\n\nDespite the changes, Nikolai, Felix, Henrik, and Athena maintain their positions in the order of succession, currently ranking seventh through tenth in line to the throne behind their father.\n\nCount Nikolai\n\n23-year-old Count Nikolai chose a different path than his royal relatives, entering the world of fashion. After initially starting training at the Royal Danish Army's Sergeant School, Nikolai left within a few months, before he signed with Scoop Models. The young Count, who was stripped of his royal title along with his siblings in 2023, has since graced runways for prestigious fashion houses like Burberry and Dior.\n\nIn 2023, he took a leap and moved to Australia to pursue studies at UTS.\n\nCount Felix\n\nCount Felix of Monpezat, Joachim's younger son with ex-wife Alexandra, was born Prince Felix on July 22, 2002. Graduating from Gammel Hellerup Gymnasium High School in June 2021, he shared, \"It was obviously a very big moment. Just the fact that [my dad] is here, I am very happy.\"\n\nCurrently eighth in line to the throne, Felix initiated Army's Lieutenant Training in August 2021 but withdrew after one month. As per the palace's website, he is pursuing studies in international shipping and trade at Copenhagen Business School.\n\nCount Henrik and Countess Athena: The Young Royals\n\nCount Henrik and Countess Athena represent the youngest members of the Danish royal family.\n\nCount Henrik shares the same name of his famous paternal grandfather, the late Prince Consort Henrik, and just celebrated his 13th birthday in Denmark.\n\nAs the youngest and only girl among her four siblings, Athena Marguerite FranÃ§oise Marie is the daughter of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie. She shares the role of a half-sibling with Nikolai and Felix, along with her brother Henrik.\n\nOn her birth, Prince Joachim playfully suggested various names, ranging from Jo to Scheherazade, as reported by People. Fortunately, her parents settled on the name Athena, drawing inspiration from the Greek goddess, with middle names derived from her grandmothers and mother.\n\nDespite being stripped of their royal titles along with the rest of his siblings in 2023, Henrik and Athena still hold their places as ninth and tenth in the line of succession, respectively.\n\nNever miss a thing.
