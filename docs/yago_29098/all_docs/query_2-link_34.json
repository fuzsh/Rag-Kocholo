        "text": "Summary of a Q&A in Billed Bladet #41, 2013.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between the DRF and the Rosenborgs?\n\nA: Their relationship is fine but they don't associate much and never have.\n\nDuring the debate leading up to the change in the Law of Succession in 1953, the later Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid did what they could to protect their children from being affected family-wise.\n\nAs has been pointed out elsewhere, the change in the Law of Succession was the will of the people and the politicians with the DRF being somewhat relegated to the role of spectators.\n\n- It is however no secret that there was a considerable bitterness in Prince Knud towards the rest of the DRF.\n\nAnd that it was Count Ingolf of Rosenborg who, despite being cursed with a looks like a village idiot is no fool at all, was instrumental in reconceiling the two branches of the family. - But they still don't associate much.\n\nYes. and Mary is godmother to little Prince Henrik\n\nAnd Marie is one of Josephine's godmothers.\n\nI think Mary and Marie get along nicely. Athena has clearly got hand-me-downs from Josephine (the pink snowsuit) and these pictures of the two of them trying to work the opera glasses were so lovely. But as I recall that one of them (M, F, J or M) said, there's a long way from Schackenborg to Amalienborg, so they don't see each other a lot.\n\nI was asked a question today that I simply couldn't answer, so now I turn to the highest authority on royal matters, the TRF members.\n\nThe question was basically: What do Mary and our Marie call QMII when they are together, alone or in a family setting, when the show is not on?\n\nAs you know family members call her Daisy, and Joachim and Frederik call her \"mor\". And her grandchildren call her \"farmor\".\n\nBut would Mary and Marie also call her Daisy?\n\nMargrethe?\n\nSo my question to you is:\n\nYou are a well-bred Australian or Frenchwoman, you have a very formidable mother-in-law, with whom you have a good relationship (by all accounts), but she is still a very formidable woman! And in charge!\n\nSo what would feel natural for you to call her?\n\nThe DRF is inclusive enough to accept, I'm sure, English and French expressions as well.\n\nBTW the Danish word for mother-in-law is \"svigermor\". In a normal Danish family you call your mother-in-law by her first name, but this is not a normal Danish family...\n\nOr do anyone actually happen to know the answer?\n\nI was asked a question today that I simply couldn't answer, so now I turn to the highest authority on royal matters, the TRF members.\n\nThe question was basically: What do Mary and our Marie call QMII when they are together, alone or in a family setting, when the show is not on?\n\nAs you know family members call her Daisy, and Joachim and Frederik call her \"mor\".

In a normal Danish family you call your mother-in-law by her first name, but this is not a normal Danish family...\n\nOr do anyone actually happen to know the answer?\n\nI have no idea what they call her, but if I had a mother-in-law who happened to be the Queen, I would call her 'Madam', and if I had a father-in-law who was the King, I would call him 'Sire'.\n\nFrom watching interactions between the people in this family, I don't think any of them would be formal with each other when in private so I'm going to take a guess at what Mary and Marie may call their mother-in-law.\n\nFor Mary: The endearment common to the UK and Australia which would be \"Mum\".\n\nFor Marie: Being French and also along the same lines as Mary using a term she most likely grew up with, I think Marie may use \"Maman\"\n\nBoth terms mean \"Mom\".\n\nI agree with Osipi that they would call her something that is informal and endearing.\n\nThey may indeed call her Daisy now. However QMII don't strike me as someone who is on familiar footing from day one with just everyone.\n\nAnd both Mary and our Marie really only got to know their future mother-in-law when they got engaged. That's pretty daunting for anyone, not least when you marry into a royal family!\n\n- After all it took a couple of years until I began to use the endearing name for my own mother-in-law that I use today.\n\nSo in the beginning, would it be too much so to speak, to call QMII Daisy or Margrethe?\n\nPerhaps Marie is the key?\n\nIf you were a future French daughter-in-law about to marry into a French family, with a conservative-traditional father-in-law, who at least within the family is the patriarch, what would be natural to call him from day one?\n\nEven if he is a very supportive and loving father-in-law as he evidently was.\n\nFrom that we may better deduce what QMII is likely to be called by Mary and Marie?\n\nI'm not familiar with how you do it in Australian and French families, but to me at least maman and mum sounds pretty plausible.\n\nExcept that Mary's mother is dead, and was when Mary got engaged. She reportedly adored her mother. She might not have felt comfortable calling Daisy 'mum' after the engagement. Perhaps they had a conversation on what Mary was to call her, perhaps in a household which frequently spoke French Margrethe and Henrik were Maman and Papa to both Mary and Marie at the beginning. Maybe Mary thought that was the best solution. However, after a year or so QM could well have asked her to call her by her first name. I guess unless somebody says something we'll never know!\n\nMy guess would be either svigermor or Margrethe. Can't imagine they'd call her mor – that sounds very clunky if you're not addressing your own mum – and I think it's more likely that they call her Margrethe than Daisy.\n\nDaisy just seems very informal to me and while I don't doubt QMII adores both of her daughters-in-law, I very much doubt she has introduced herself as Daisy when they first met. Seems a bit too chummy for QMII's liking (they aren't school mates, you know ). And by the time she'd known them long enough for them to get to call her Daisy, I would guess it would be weird for them to start calling her by an entirely different name. I could definitely imagine they'd call her svigermor though.\n\nMy guess is Mor or Daisy. Is there a more formal term for mother in Danish?\n\nI know that they are different royal houses but I think that British married in-s call their parents-in-law Mama and Papa. Chris O'Neill, son-in-law of Carl-Gustaf of Sweden says he calls his father-in-law sir.\n\nYes, and Queen Silvia is 'Mom'. Maybe Mary, being a non-danish, uses the same address.\n\nI read that King Juan Carlos is being addressed as 'Senor' or 'Patron', Queen Sofia as 'Senora'.\n\nI'd never calll my mother in law 'Mum' since it's not what she is, I call her by her first name.\n\nAnd so you should. ?\n\nThere is no such thing as stupid questions, only stupid replies.\n\nWell, it depends on where you read it. Some of the press can be pretty sensational, and, shall we say, imaginative, in their articles. According to the press M&F should have been on the brink of divorce many times. They should also have at least 15 children!\n\nAnd we all know QMII and Mary absolutely love and hate each other every alternate week. ?\n\nThere is of course also the distance to take into account. Some thing said an written about the Spanish royals up here, may be, shall we say misinterpreted...\n\nAnd then there are those who would very much like to see, in this case, Mary fall flat on her nose, for whatever reason they may have for wishing that.\n\nAs you know that doesn't only apply to Mary. Letizia, Kate, Meghan Maxima and so on have their detractors as well.\n\nI am trying to understand the \"in the past\" part, is that referring to the dating years and the early years of their marriage? It is hard to make goo goo eyes at each other when you have four kids in tow. Having said that one of the nicest parts of being a Crown Prince Couple watcher is those unexpected displays of affection between Fred and Mary or even something that is not necessarily PDA but just something that shows a connection like a glance. I guess it can be debated as to whether it is healthy or not, but it seems to me that Fred seems to sometimes use Mary as a soothie where he will go over to her and take her hand or try and get her attention, these gestures tend to be fleeting. I think that it is a good reflection on Mary, who (to me) seems to have a very professional demeanor in public is often sought out by her husband and children for comfort and support.\n\nCan someone please confirm if Prince Henrik actually did state that, by marrying a commoner, the crown prince was cheapening the monarchy? I would be surprised if he had expressed this opinion publickly.\n\nI have never heard that one.\n\nI think that statement is so strong that it would have been quoted often in connection with PH.\n\nPH, like all people, had his flaws, but he wasn't a snob.\n\nCan someone please confirm if Prince Henrik actually did state that, by marrying a commoner, the crown prince was cheapening the monarchy?

I'll be prepared to eat crow if that turned out to be true. Prince Henrik was many things but he was never a snob. As we've seen before his death and heard even more after he passed away he was genuinely interested and happy to connect with people from all walks of life and that he cared deeply about everyone around him. Added to that he was visibly devoted to his three daughters-in-laws who, as we all know, were all born as commoners.\n\nWasn’t Henrik’s title in dispute at some point anyways? I thought I read somewhere he wasn’t actually an aristocrat.\n\nThere are different interpretations regarding if the family of Laborde de Monpezat fullfilled the stipulations of their Letter of ennoblement in 1655. Given that they probably didn´t the question is if they can be considered as noble anyway having lived as nobles on noble lands and having paid noble poll tax several times during the 18th century. The verdict is still out on that but the general view, shared by Prince Henrik himself when faced with the information, is that they weren´t official members of the nobility. Whats definitely sure is that the comital title is not an official one. It´s worth pointing out that there are many families who assumed these \"titres de courtoisie\" during the 19th century and that the use of them are carefully accepted.\n\nA footnote is that I remember reading old French articles from the early years of the marriage betweeen Daisy and Henri where already then real French aristocrats are outright puzzled over who this supposed Comte de Monpezat is."
