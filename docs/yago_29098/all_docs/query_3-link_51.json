        "text": "Today it was announced that Queen Margrethe II plans to abdicate after 52 years and hand over the throne to her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nAs of January 14, 2024, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary will step up as Queen and King of Denmark.\n\nHowever, there has not yet been any update as to whether or not it will affect the decision made by Queen Margrethe to remove the titles of four of her eight grandchildren.\n\nThe Danish royal family was thrown into turmoil when the Queen announced her decision in late 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: Everything you need to know about the Danish royal family\n\nAlthough it did not impact Prince Frederik and Princess Mary's children, the monarch's decision was met with shock and anger from those it affected the most: her youngest son, his children and their mothers.\n\nIn an extraordinary turn of events, the 83-year-old Queen later issued an apology for causing her family any distress, admitting she \"underestimated\" how much they would \"feel affected\".\n\nBut the Queen stood by the move, saying it was \"a necessary safeguard for the future of the monarchy\".\n\nHere's how the events played out at the time.\n\nQueen Margrethe's decision\n\nOn September 28, 2022, the Danish royal household issued a statement revealing the changes to the titles of the four children of Prince Joachim and any future descendants.\n\n\"Her Majesty has decided that, as of 1 January 2023, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim's descendants can only use their titles as counts and countess of Monpezat, as the titles of prince and princess that they have held up until now will be discontinued.\n\n\"Prince Joachim's descendants will thus have to be addressed as excellencies in the future.\n\n\"The Queen's decision is in line with similar adjustments that other royal houses have made in various ways in recent years.\"\n\n\"With her decision, Her Majesty The Queen wishes to create the framework for the four grandchildren to be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited by the special considerations and duties that a formal affiliation with the Royal House of Denmark as an institution involves.\n\n\"All four grandchildren maintain their place in the succession.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Shoe left at Prince Christian's birthday party sparks Cinderella search\n\nIt meant they are no longer able to use their titles of prince and princess. The children also don't have the status of His/Her Royal Highness.\n\nBut they have been allowed to keep their aristocratic titles of count and countess of Monpezat, given in 2008, and are known as His Excellency Count of Monpezat or Her Excellency Countess of Monpezat.\n\nWho is affected\n\nPrince Joachim, 53, is the youngest son of Queen Margrethe and the late Prince Henrik.\n\nHe is sixth-in-line to the Danish throne after his brother Crown Prince Frederik and his nieces and nephews, Prince Christian, 16, Princess Isabella, 15, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, both 11.\n\nHe is the brother-in-law of Australian-born Crown Princess Mary.\n\nThe Queen's decision affected only the children of Prince Joachim and not those of Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nREAD MORE: New drama about Queen MÃ¡xima's rise to royalty to rival The Crown\n\nJoachim's children are Prince Nikolai, 23, Prince Felix, 20, Prince Henrik, 13 and Princess Athena, 10.\n\nPrince Nikolai and Prince Felix are from Joachim's first marriage to Alexandra Countess of Frederiksborg.\n\nHis youngest children, Prince Henrik and Princess Athena, are from his current marriage to Princess Marie.\n\nThe model princes\n\nThere was speculation in Danish media that the Queen's decision was hastily announced, possibly because of the advancing careers of Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix.\n\nPreviously, Prince Joachim said he had been presented with a plan for the change in May and the Queen said the titles would remain with his children until they turned 25.\n\nHe later said he had just five days to tell his children of the changes.\n\nA possible concern was that Nikolai and Felix were using their titles for financial gain and therefore monetising the royal family.\n\nThe two elder brothers work as fashion models\n\nIn February, Prince Felix made his debut with luxury Danish jeweller Georg Jensen.\n\nHe is following in the footsteps of his older brother who has been modelling for years, having worked with brands such as Dior.\n\nIn October, 2022, Felix quit his Army's Lieutenant Training, which he had begun just two months earlier at the prestigious Gardehus Barracks in Slagelse, south-west of Copenhagen.\n\nREAD MORE: Denmark's Queen Margrethe II to step down from throne\n\nNikolai also dropped out of his military training soon after starting.\n\nHe left the Royal Danish Army's Sergeant School in October 2018 but quickly found a new career as a model.\n\nIn 2018, Nikolai signed with modelling agency Scoop Models in Denmark and has walked the catwalk for Burberry and Dior.\n\nHe has also graced the cover of Vogue Scandinavia wearing Dior and took part in a runway show for Danish label Rains at Paris Fashion Week.\n\nIn January, 2023, Nikolai moved back to Denmark to continue his studies at the Copenhagen Business School. He had moved to Paris in September to complete a semester there and further his fashion career.\n\nHe later moved to Sydney to complete a semester at the University of Technology (UTS) in Ultimo.\n\nSpeaking about his decision to move into modelling, Prince Nikolai told Vogue Scandinavia: \"Nobody had anything against it. But of course I had to explain it to my family. But I always have to, no matter what I do.\"\n\nThe Queen herself said the loss of royal titles would allow the children to \"shape their own lives to a much greater extent\" than if they were \"limited\" by what being a member of the royal household involves.\n\nThat means they will be able to earn their own money and pursue their own careers â something impossible to do as a 'prince' or 'princess'.\n\nThe family speak out\n\nThe Queen's decree was swiftly met with anger and shock from Prince Joachim and his family, who all claimed to have been surprised by the move.\n\nPrince Joachim said they were all \"very sad\", adding, \"It's never fun to see your children being harmed. They have been put in a situation they do not understand\".\n\nPrincess Marie said their daughter, Athena, has been \"bullied at school\": \"They come and say: 'Is it you who is no longer a princess?' \"\n\nJoachim and Marie were asked by BT journalist Jacob Heinel Jensen if they had spoken to the Queen after the announcement.\n\n\"Unfortunately not,\" Prince Joachim said, adding, \"It's also family. Or whatever we want to call it\".\n\n\"We would have liked to have had time to talk about it,\" Princess Marie said.\n\nREAD MORE: A look inside one of Europe's oldest monarchies, Denmark's royal family\n\nThey gave the interview three days after the palace statement, from outside their apartment in Paris where they have been living for the past three years.\n\nPrince Nikolai said he was \"very confused as to why it has to happen like this\".\n\n\"My whole family and I are of course very sad. We are, as my parents have also stated, in shock at this decision and at how quickly it has actually gone,\" he told Ekstra Bladet.\n\nHis mother, and Joachim's ex-wife, Countess Alexandra said the family was \"saddened and in shock\", adding the children \"cannot understand why their identity is being taken away\".\n\n\"This comes like a bolt from the blue. The children feel ostracised.\"\n\nStrained relations\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie's role in the Danish royal family has been cut back in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, they moved to France where Joachim began training at the Ãcole Militaire in Paris, the country's highest-ranking military course focused on strategic leadership and international relations.\n\nIn November 2020, he began a role as a diplomat at the Danish Embassy in Paris while Princess Marie later became a Special Representative at the Culture department of the Danish Embassy.\n\nIn early 2022, they gave an interview to Danish magazine Berlingske about their new roles.\n\nJoachim spoke about representing the monarchy abroad, acknowledging he had \"greater freedom\" to pursue his own interests than his older brother, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\n\"If you are from a royal family, it is somewhat more framed,\" Joachim said.\n\n\"This is one of the things I have emphasised to the elders of my sons: You are free to do as you please, as long as you behave properly.\n\nREAD MORE: A closer look at Prince Joachim, Princess Mary's brother-in-law\n\n\"I have far greater freedom than the Crown Prince to do what I want, but at the same time I am limited in my unfoldment. It was just in that context that I said it.\"\n\nHowever, in 2020, in a separate interview Princess Marie said it was not their own choice to move to France.\n\nShe was asked about this shortly after the Queen's announcement and whether she viewed it as \"a winding down\" of her family's role in the monarchy.\n\n\"Yes of course,\" Princess Marie told BT.\n\n\"But we have an active role in the royal House, and I think that you should remember that. But we have always told our children that they must be independent and that they will not get appanage, but it is something else to take away a name.\"\n\n\"How do you proceed from here?\" the journalist asked.\n\n\"I do not know. We'll have to see,\" she answered.\n\nThey also stressed they had no intention of leaving the Danish royal family altogether.\n\n\"We have never had any doubts about it. I hope no one doubts that,\" Princess Marie said.\n\nJournalist Jacob Heinel Jensen said relations between Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim has been \"complicated for several years\".\n\n\"It is probably unthinkable that they will be together in the next few months, because no one believes that they have a good mutual relationship,\" Jensen said.\n\n\"It is also unthinkable that they are together at Christmas. In recent years, the Queen has already had a tradition of taking turns celebrating Christmas there with her two sons.\n\n\"And it is also, in one way or another, proof that their relationship has been complicated for several years.\"\n\nCrown Princess Mary dragged in\n\nShortly after the announcement, Crown Princess Mary became the first member of the royal family to voice her support for the Queen.\n\n\"Change can be difficult and can really hurt, but this does not mean that the decision is not the right one,\" Crown Princess Mary told reporters, adding she and Crown Frederik would \"look at our own children's titles when the time comes\".\n\nBut Princess Marie's decision to talk about her daughter being bullied is being seen as \"an attack\" on her sister-in-law, who has been advocating against bullying for at least a decade through her work with The Mary Foundation.\n\nJensen said the comments had been carefully chosen.\n\n\"I cannot interpret it as anything other than an attack on Crown Princess Mary, it was a direct message,\" Jensen said.\n\n\"Marie has had several days to think about what she wanted to say after it emerged that the titles had been taken from the children. So it is probably carefully selected.\n\nREAD MORE: Mary to become Queen of Denmark after Margrethe's shock abdication\n\n\"It is clear that when she takes something as bullying and deliberately uses the expression 'children's conditions', it cannot be interpreted differently than that she wants to draw attention to the fact that the Royal House â and therefore the Crown Princess â must be aware of what is for some values ââthat you stand for on the outside.\"\n\nThe sisters-in-law have reportedly had a rocky relationship for years.\n\nDanish tabloid media claimed Joachim had a crush on Mary and married Marie in 2008 because of her physical similarities to his brother's wife.\n\nA photo of Joachim appearing to try and kiss Mary at a palace gala in 2006 was splashed across one tabloid, fueling the speculation of a romance between them â a crisis the palace was swift to nip in the bud.\n\nMary and Marie later appeared together at a number of engagements in what seemed to be an attempt to show unity amongst the discord.\n\nQueen Margrethe's apology\n\nLess than a week after the palace statement, the Queen issued an extraordinary apology to her four grandchildren.\n\n\"In recent days, there have been strong reactions to my decision on the future use of titles for Prince Joachim's four children,\" Queen Margrethe said.\n\n\"It obviously affects me. My decision has been a long time coming. With my 50 years on the throne, it is natural both to look back and to look forward.\n\n\"It is my duty and my wish as Queen to ensure that the monarchy continues to shape itself in keeping with the times.\n\n\"It sometimes requires difficult decisions to be made, and it will always be difficult to find the right moment.\"\n\n\"Carrying a royal title entails a number of obligations and duties, which will in future be the responsibility of fewer members of the royal family,\" she said.\n\n\"This adaptation, which I see as a necessary safeguard for the future of the monarchy, I want to make in my time.\n\n\"I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but as a mother and grandmother I have underestimated how much my youngest son and his family feel affected.\n\n\"It makes a big impression, and I'm sorry for that.\n\n\"No one should be in doubt that my children, children-in-law and grandchildren are my great joy and pride.\n\n\"I now hope that we as a family can find the peace to find our way through this situation ourselves.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Why Crown Princess Mary won't have a coronation\n\nOther 'slimmed-down' royal houses\n\nThe royal family of Denmark's neighbour and close ally Sweden made similar changes to its monarchy in October 2019.\n\nThen, King Carl XVI Gustaf revoked the royal status of five of his grandchildren, stripping them of the titles of 'royal highness' and freeing them from royal duties.\n\nThe decision affected the two children of Prince Carl and Princess Sofia and Princess Madeleine's three children, but not those of Crown Princess Victoria.\n\nHowever, all of King Carl XVI Gustaf's grandchildren are considered part of the royal house and have been allowed to keep their princely titles.\n\nNorway could be the next royal house to cut down its royal representatives.\n\nA poll conducted by research firm Norstat for Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) found a majority of Norwegians no longer think Princess MÃ¤rtha Louise should represent the royal family in official duties.\n\nJust 13 per cent think she should.\n\nThe main reason given was her engagement to American author and 'spiritual advisor' shaman Durek Verrett.\n\nRoyals around the world who have lost their titles\n\nIn 2019, she agreed to stop using her royal title for commercial purposes, putting an end to a long-running row with her family, headed by King Harald.\n\nMÃ¤rtha's association with the shaman, and her claimed ability to heal and communicate with angels, had created a \"catastrophe\" and credibility issues for the royal family.\n\nWhat it could mean for King Charles\n\nThe decision to slim down Denmark's monarchy, which is one of Europe's oldest, was in line with changes \"other royal houses have made\" and came amid speculation King Charles III of Britain had plans to do the same.\n\nIn the days after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted the reign of King Charles would \"be more like a Scandinavian monarchy in the future\".\n\n\"Not in a bad way, but more informal,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAnother former British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed.\n\n\"If you look at the royal family, they have been steadily evolving a different approach, a different way of doing things over time and I am sure King Charles will continue to take that forward,\" she said.\n\nQueen Margrethe's announcement was likely to spark interest in the UK where questions remained over the royal titles of two of King Charles's grandchildren.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were said to be concerned that no announcement had been made on whether their children will be given the titles of prince and princess.\n\nArchie, three, and Lilibet, one, automatically became a prince and princess upon Queen Elizabeth II's death and are entitled to be styled His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness.\n\nThe House of Windsor and the House of GlÃ¼cksburg are close, with Queen Margrethe a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\nThat made her a third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMargrethe's great-great-grandfather was Christian IX. His daughter, Alexandra, married Edward VII, King Charles III's great-great-grandfather.\n\nLike Elizabeth II, Queen Margrethe celebrated a Jubilee in 2022. January 14 in 2021 saw Margrethe mark 50 years on the Danish throne with celebrations for her Golden Jubilee held in mid-September after coronavirus delays.\n\nQueen Margrethe and Crown Prince Frederik were among the foreign royals at the late monarch's state funeral on September 19.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
