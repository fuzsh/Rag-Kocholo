        "text": "The Danish royal court has announced a big move and a new job for Queen Margrethe's youngest son, Prince Joachim, and his family.\n\nJoachim, 53, and his wife, Princess Marie, 47, have been living in Paris for the past four years but will join the list of royals no longer living in their native countries when they relocate to the US this summer.\n\nIn a statement, the palace announced that Joachim will \"take up a new position under the Ministry of Defense as defense industry attaché at the Danish Embassy in Washington DC, where the Prince, as Denmark's representative, will in the coming years help to strengthen the defense industry cooperation with the USA and Canada\".\n\nJoachim has been working as Defense Attaché at the Danish Embassy in Paris since 2020 after completing France's highest ranking military training course.\n\nSEE: Meghan Markle's cute nursery transformation complete with a fluffy toy lamb\n\nThe prince and princess will be joined in Washington by their two children – Count Henrik, 13, and Countess Athena, 11.\n\nJoachim also has two sons from his previous marriage to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg – Count Nikolai, 23, and Count Felix, 20.\n\nJoachim and Marie will move to Washington from Paris this summer\n\nIn September, Queen Margrethe announced the decision to strip four of her grandchildren of their royal titles.\n\nIn an effort to slim down the monarchy, the Danish queen removed the HRH styling from Prince Joachim's children.\n\nThe decree, which came into effect on 1 January, meant that Nikolai, Felix, Henrik and Athena are now titled Count of Countess of Monpezat.\n\nThe decision caused major controversy within the family at the time – with Margrethe later taking the unprecedented step of apologising to Joachim and his children.\n\nRoyals who have relocated to the US\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are the most famous royals to have moved stateside, settling into their family home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, after stepping back from royal duties in 2020.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan provided a fascinating glimpse into their California lifestyle when their Netflix docuseries aired back in December. Meanwhile, the Duke revealed how he feels about working and raising his two children, Archie and Lilibet, in the US, in an interview with Hoda Kotb last April. See what he had to say...\n\nMeanwhile, one of Harry and Meghan's Montecito neighbours, Sandro Monetti, a royal expert in LA, revealed to HELLO!'s A Right Royal Podcast, why he thinks Lilibet will be the most famous person in the US when she's older.\n\nLISTEN: What the future holds for Archie and Lilibet in California\n\nCrown Prince Pavlos and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece divide their time between lavish properties around the world with their five children, including a New York residence, as well as a London townhouse, Cotswolds estate, and a property in Harbour Island in the Bahamas.\n\nSweden's Princess Madeleine has lived in Florida since 2018 with her husband, financier Christopher O'Neill, and their three children - Princess Leonore, nine, Prince Nicolas, seven, and five-year-old Princess Adrienne.\n\nEarlier this month, the palace announced that the family-of-five will be moving back to Stockholm this August."
