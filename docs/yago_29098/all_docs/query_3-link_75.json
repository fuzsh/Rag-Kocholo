        "text": "When Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marked her Golden Jubilee last year, one of her daughters-in-law made a sparkling diamond-studded appearance at a glittering gala celebration.\n\nQueen Margrethe was joined by her sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, and their wives, Crown Princess Mary and Princess Marie, as she greeted guests ahead of a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace to celebrate her Golden Jubilee in September 2022.\n\nPrincess Marie arrived for the gala dinner in Copenhagen wearing a festive evening gown in a bright shade of light yellow. The dress, made by Danish designer Rikke Gudnitz, features feather detailing on the sleeves and a beaded buckle embellishment at the waist.\n\nThe jubilee banquet was a rare “collar day” for members of the Order of the Elephant. Accordingly, Marie wore the order’s collar and star with her evening gown for the dinner.\n\nThe tiara that Marie chose for the gala is perhaps her signature royal jewel: Princess Dagmar’s Floral Tiara. The antique diamond diadem, on long-term loan to Marie from Queen Margrethe, was Marie’s wedding tiara in 2008. It’s been her most-worn tiara ever since.\n\nWith the tiara, Marie also wore a pair of much-loved earrings from her collection, featuring large diamonds in a knife-edge setting, as well as a tennis-style bracelet on her left wrist and a ring with a blue gemstone on her right hand.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Court Jeweller Newsletter\n\nEnter your name and email address below to subscribe to our weekly newsletter!"
