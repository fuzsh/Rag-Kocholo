        "text": "I thought the wedding was beautiful (much more appropriet than the Peter and Autumn Phillips wedding of last week). I loved every second of it.\n\nYes, that's an interesting point you raise here: Joachim and Marie have given lots of interviews pre-wedding, invited TV-cameras into Schackenborg, posed for numerous pictures, allowed TV to make documentaries. We know about lots and lots of details about past, present and the future they wish for themselves. The wedding was televised and TV reported from morning till night.\n\nStill I as well have the feeling that they didn't cross that small line between allowing the public to celebrate with them and selling out. I hope we will be able to see one day in a officially recognised book some pics from the private part of the wedding and of the honeymoon, maybe they even release a short video of the wedding waltz, but I guess they will very fiercely protect the privacy of their guests on celebrating their nuptials.\n\nDo you have a link to a picture where she looks 'cheesed off' - still assuming that you were watching the same as everybody here have been watching\n\nPastel blue almost white? You better lay down some new ground rules for colours allowed for wedding guests - if pastel colours are now off limit - or is it only off limit for certain persons perhaps?\n\nGosh, sorry Mary fans, my comments were sarcastic at the worst... Do you think that the CPss would come frowning?! I just think she isn't as radiant as when she is at the center of attention. As for the colour of the dress, other people in the forum also had question marks about it, I personally had to look at pictures from different agencies to verify the colour...\n\nI think the oficial photos were taken in a strange place, a room with only a fire place. It looks like it is Prince Joaquim sitting room with no furniture, maybe Marie is remodeling the house so son!!!! Do you think, gosh I hope not! I think the oficial photos could be taken in a more beautiful place like a landscape in the garden or so, bu inside a room with no furniture that was really awful and not appropiate at all for such an ocassion!!!\n\nI also think that it was very strange that Marie didn't know any Danish and all her wedding was in Danish, to me that is very peculiar.\n\nYes many mistakes have been made, they were all avoidable..... and to me that was unpardonable, this was a Royal wedding and even if not, everything should had ben in order and plan and it wasn't, what a shame...\n\nI think the oficial photos were taken in a strange place, a room with only a fire place. It looks like it is Prince Joaquim sitting room with no furniture, maybe Marie is remodeling the house so son!!!! Do you think, gosh I hope not! I think the oficial photos could be taken in a more beautiful place like a landscape in the garden or so, bu inside a room with no furniture that was really awful and not appropiate at all for such an ocassion!!!\n\nI also think that it was very strange that Marie didn't know any Danish and all her wedding was in Danish, to me that is very peculiar.\n\nYes many mistakes have been made, they were all avoidable..... and to me that was unpardonable, this was a Royal wedding and even if not, everything should had ben in order and plan and it wasn't, what a shame...\n\nActually in one of the pre-wedding interviews (the English one, the only one I understood ) Marie said she had no plans to redecorate the house as she liked it exactly the way it was. I personally don't think the room wa a strange place to take official pictures, most official royal pics I've seen so far are taken in a room. The only thing I thought of was that they should have closed the door on one of the pics. But, there again, it's not really about the room is it, it's about the people on it, and that was perfect\n\nAs for Marie's Danish, isn't it so that she doesn't master the language well enough, but surely she understands most of it, so I have no doubt she did understand everything that was said at her own wedding\n\nGosh, sorry Mary fans, my comments were sarcastic at the worst... Do you think that the CPss would come frowning?! I just think she isn't as radiant as when she is at the center of attention. As for the colour of the dress, other people in the forum also had question marks about it, I personally had to look at pictures from different agencies to verify the colour...\n\nNo, I expected her to come exactly as she did - smiling and seemingly happy on behalf of J&M. I think she looked better than ever actually.\n\nPity you didn't see the wedding directly on TV. Even in the sunlight it was clearly pastel blue.\n\nYes many mistakes have been made, they were all avoidable..... and to me that was unpardonable, this was a Royal wedding and even if not, everything should had ben in order and plan and it wasn't, what a shame...\n\nIMHO these mishaps all gave the wedding a feeling of being a \"country\"-wedding where not strict protocoll reigns, where only guest are invited that have a real personal connection to the couple and where nothings is sooo important one has to get overly serious over it. A wedding full of joy and sunshine - and I bet Mary would have preferred such a wedding, too as it seems bride and groom really amused themselves with their guests, dancing till the early hours of the morning, spent their wedding night in their own bed and had breakfast with their family before leaving for their honeymoon.\n\nMy first wedding was exactly such a family wedding in the countryside and we enjoyed meeting with our guest the next morning over brunch before leaving...\n\nWell don, IMHo, Joachim and Marie.\n\nI think the oficial photos were taken in a strange place, a room with only a fire place. It looks like it is Prince Joaquim sitting room with no furniture, maybe Marie is remodeling the house so son!!!! Do you think, gosh I hope not! I think the oficial photos could be taken in a more beautiful place like a landscape in the garden or so, bu inside a room with no furniture that was really awful and not appropiate at all for such an ocassion!!!\n\n.\n\nNot at all, it looked usual to me - it's very standard in a big house to have such a bare space, a hall with a big fireplace and whitewashed walls. It's actually much more elegant spartan than 'overstuffed'! I'm not sure what the function of the space would have been, but there's such a room even in a big old farmhouse I know in New South Wales. In a country dwelling, the rooms with hangings on the walls etc would have been the upstairs rooms perhaps. Anyone know more about this topic?\n\nquote:\"I think the oficial photos were taken in a strange place, a room with only a fire place.
