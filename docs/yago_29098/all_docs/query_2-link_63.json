The abdication will take place on the 52nd anniversary of the queen's succession.\n\nMargrethe said she received back surgery in February which influenced her decision to abdicate.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Everything went well, thanks to the competent health personnel, who took care of me. Inevitably, the operation gave cause to thoughts about the future — whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation,\" the monarch said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe queen's announcement came as a shock to many since abdication is not common in Denmark. The last monarch to abdicate was King Erik in 1146, who gave up the throne and went to a monastery, according to the Danish royal website.\n\nThe news likely surprised Margrethe's family, who were reportedly only informed of her decision just a few days before the public.\n\nLene Balleby, the director of communications for the Danish royal house, told local outlet Berlingske that the queen's sons, Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, were informed of Margrethe's abdication on December 28 — three days before she made the public announcement — according to an English translation by People. The Danish royal house did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nThis comes during a tumultuous period for the Danish royals. In September 2022, the queen announced her intention to remove the royal titles of four of her grandchildren — a decision that received backlash from several family members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore recently, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary's relationship faced scrutiny after a Spanish tabloid reported that Frederik was having an affair with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova.\n\nGenoveva Casanova publicly denied the rumors, while the couple refused to comment.\n\nHere's a complete timeline of the recent family drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2022, Queen Margrethe announced plans to strip four of her grandchildren of their royal titles.\n\nQueen Margrethe has two sons: Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark (the eldest and heir to the throne, born in 1968) and Prince Joachim of Denmark (born in 1969).\n\nIn a press release issued by the Danish royal house on September 28, 2022, it was announced that Prince Joachim's four children would be stripped of their titles in 2023.\n\nThe decision affected Count Nikolai, born in 1999; Count Felix, born in 2002; Count Henrik, born in 2009; and Countess Athena, born in 2012.\n\nJoachim shares Nikolai and Felix with his first wife, Countess Alexandra, whom he was married to from 1995 until 2005, according to Royal Central. He shares Henrik and Athena with his current wife, Princess Marie, who he has been wed to since 2008.\n\nThe children, who were formerly known as princes and princesses, would instead be able to use the titles count and countess of Monpezat from January 1, 2023, the press release stated. The four young royals would \"be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent\" without being tied to the royal house, the press release said.\n\nThe decision did not affect Crown Prince Frederik's four children: Prince Christian, born in 2005; Princess Isabella, born in 2007; and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, born in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Joachim appeared to be blindsided by the news.\n\nSeveral members of the royal family, including Prince Joachim, spoke to the press in the aftermath of the announcement.\n\n\"We are all very sad. It's never fun to see your children being mistreated like that,\" Joachim told the Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet on September 28, 2022.\n\n\"They find themselves in a situation they do not understand,\" he added.\n\nJoachim told the outlet he was only given five days' notice before the queen's decision was made public. He added that it came as a surprise since he had previously been told that his children's titles would be removed when they turned 25.\n\nAccording to Danish outlet B.T., royal communications secretary Lene Balleby said in a statement that Joachim had known about the decision since May 2022. Joachim and Marie denied Balleby's comments when speaking to the outlet on October 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoachim's ex-wife Countess Alexandra told local media that the family were \"confused\" and \"saddened\" by the announcement.\n\n\"We are all confused by the decision. We are saddened and in shock. This comes like a bolt from the blue,\" Alexandra told B.T. on September 28, 2022.\n\n\"The children feel ostracized. They cannot understand why their identity is being taken away from them,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoachim and Marie said their relationship with other family members had become complicated.\n\nSpeaking to B.T. on October 1, Joachim and Marie said they hadn't had any communication with Margrethe or Crown Prince Frederick and Crown Princess Mary since the announcement was made.\n\nWhen asked what their relationship was like with Frederick and Mary, Marie responded that it was \"complicated.\"\n\nLater in the interview, Marie said that her youngest child, Athena, was being bullied at school because of the decision.\n\n\"Athena is bullied at school. They come and say: Is it you who is no longer a princess?\" Marie told the outlet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe queen issued a public apology in October 2022.\n\nQueen Margrethe addressed her family's comments in a public statement shared to the Danish royal website on October 3.\n\n\"I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected,\" the monarch said.\n\n\"That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry,\" she continued.\n\nHer Majesty concluded the statement by saying she hoped her family would \"find the peace to find our way through this situation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe queen's eldest son, Frederik, publicly supported his mother.\n\nSince Frederik is first in line to the throne, his children were not affected by Margrethe's decision to remove some of her grandchildren's titles.\n\nFrederik didn't publicly comment when the announcement was made in September 2022, according to People. However, speaking to B.T. before a royal engagement on October 27, 2022, Frederik said he supported his mother's decision.\n\nHe added that he and Joachim had been in \"constant contact\" since the news broke, which appeared to contradict Joachim and Marie's previous comments about their relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoachim, Marie, and their two youngest children relocated to the US in September 2023.\n\nIt was announced that Prince Joachim and his family would relocate from Europe to Washington, DC, in a statement shared to the Danish royal website on March 17.\n\n\"On 1 September 2023, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim will take up a new position under the Ministry of Defense as defense industry attaché at the Danish Embassy in Washington D.C., where the Prince, as Denmark's representative, will in the coming years help to strengthen the defense industry cooperation with the USA and Canada,\" the statement read.\n\nThe family relocated on September 1, just under one year since the queen's announcement.\n\nThe family previously lived in France, where Joachim undertook the country's highest-ranking military education course before working for the Danish Embassy in Paris, according to the royal website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Joachim's eldest son, Count Nikolai, moved to Australia for university.\n\nCount Nikolai moved to Australia in August 2023 for an exchange semester at the University of Technology in Ultimo, Sydney.\n\nSpeaking to Australian outlet 9Honey shortly after the move, Nikolai spoke about what it was like to loose his title.\n\n\"It's still quite a touchy subject but, I mean, I am the same person as I've always been,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he was hurt by his grandmother's decision, Nikolai said: \"I wouldn't say hurt, and it's not my intention to stir the pot in any way. I think it's just a bit weird still, I still have to get used to it.\"\n\nHe added that he is on good terms with his grandmother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, socialite Genoveva Casanova denied rumors that she was having an affair with Prince Frederik.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Princess Mary's relationship came under public scrutiny in November 2023 after a tabloid reported that Frederik was having an affair with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova.\n\nThe Spanish outlet Lecturas published photos of Casanova and the prince walking alone in El Retiro Park, Madrid. The publication also alleged that they had spent the evening together at Casanova's apartment.\n\n\"I categorically deny claims suggesting a romantic relationship between Prince Frederik and myself. Any such statement is not only completely untrue but also misrepresents the facts in a malicious manner,\" Casanova said in a statement published by Hola on November 7 that was translated to English by BI.\n\n\"This is already in the hands of my lawyers, who will take the necessary steps to protect my right to honor, truth, and privacy,\" she added.\n\n\"We do not comment on rumors and insinuations,\" a spokesperson for the royal house of Denmark previously told BI of the allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, it's been business as usual for Frederik and Mary.\n\nMary and Frederik have been photographed together on several occasions since Casanova's statement was issued. They joined the King and Queen of Spain at engagements in Copenhagen in November, and more recently they attended a New Year's reception hosted by the queen at Amalienborg Palace on January 1.\n\nThe pair were reunited with Joachim and Marie, who were photographed arriving at the same reception.\n\nFrederik and Mary are due to become King and Queen of Copenhagen at an accession ceremony when Margrethe steps down on Sunday. Their eldest son, Prince Christian, will become heir to the throne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Joachim reportedly plans to attend Frederik's accession without his wife or children.\n\nPrince Joachim will travel from Washington, DC, to Denmark to attend Frederik's accession on Sunday, but he will do so without Princess Marie or their children, according to Hello Magazine.\n\nThe outlet reported on Thursday that the royal palace has confirmed Marie's plans to stay at home with the children. Meanwhile, the publication added that Joachim will travel back to the US the day after the accession.\n\nRepresentatives for the Danish royal house did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment regarding Joachim's attendance.\n\nRead next\n\nRoyals\n\nAdvertisement"
