        "text": "A Spanish magazine has made a bombshell allegation about the real reason behind the Danish royal family’s current feud.\n\nThe family appears to be splintered down the middle after Queen Margrethe stripped her younger son Joachim’s children of their royal titles, leaving that side of the family fuming.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Princess Mary and Prince Frederik have a romantic moment\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nMeanwhile, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary’s children remain unaffected.\n\nFor now, Christian, 16, Isabella, 15, and twins Josephine and Vincent, 11, retain their titles as direct descendants of the future King.\n\nPrince Joachim lashed out at the decision, telling Danish media he was given five days’ notice that his children Nikolai, 23, Felix, 20, Henrik, 13, and Athena, 10, would have their prince and princess titles removed.\n\nJoachim, 53, and his second wife Princess Marie, 46, have previously admitted that their relationship with Frederick, 54, and Mary, 50, is “complicated.”\n\nNow, a Spanish magazine, Vanitatis Elconfidencial, has made a startling claim that the family is splintered because Joachim was “deeply in love with his sister-in-law Mary”,\n\nA Swedish magazine, Svensk Damtidning, also published a photograph which allegedly showed Joachim trying to kiss Mary at a gala party.\n\nReferring to that photograph, Vanitatas Elconfidencial wrote: “With obvious signs of drunkenness, it seems that the youngest son of Queen Margrethe tried to stamp his lips of his sister-in-law’s mouth, but she got out of the way as she could with an unperturbed smile, while Marie witnessed the embarrassing moment.”\n\nThe magazine claimed that Danish media outlets had begun speculating shortly after Mary and Frederik’s marriage that Joachim was “deeply in love” with Mary.\n\n“In fact, it didn’t help that in 2007 he announced his engagement to a French girl (Marie) with the same name and a striking physical resemblance,” the magazine added.\n\nIt then claimed Queen Margrethe called them all “to order” after Danish media began circulating the claim that Joachim was in love with Mary, and “started a campaign to show that there were no problems between the two women.”\n\nAfter stripping four of her grandchildren of their titles, Margrethe took the rare step of commenting publicly on her move, describing it as a “difficult decision.”\n\n“It is a consideration I have had for quite a long time and I think it will be good for them in their future,” she said.\n\nDanish royal expert Lars Hovbakke told Danish media outlet Ekstra Bladet that it was “a completely unusual situation” for Margrethe to release a statement on the family feud.\n\n“It is historic, and it shows something about the seriousness that the Queen feels called to make such a personal announcement in a press release,” Hovbakke said.\n\n“It is quite unusual and she has never done this before. It shows that there is a huge conflict.”\n\nPrincess Mary was also put on the spot by the Danish media, telling Ekstra Bladet: “Change can be extremely difficult and can really hurt.”\n\n“But this does not mean that the decision is not the right one,” she added.\n\n“I can understand that it is a very difficult decision to have to make, and also a very difficult decision to receive.”\n\nFor more engaging royal content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
