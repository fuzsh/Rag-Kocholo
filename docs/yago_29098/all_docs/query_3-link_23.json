        "text": "There's been a lot of movement regarding royal titles in some of Europe's oldest monarchies of late.\n\nMost recently, Norway's King and Queen put an end to frenzied speculation about their daughter Princess Martha Louise and her controversial fiancé, confirming she would no longer carry out royal duties and represent the monarchy.\n\nWeeks earlier, Denmark's Queen Margrethe II announced four of her eight grandchildren would be stripped of their 'prince and princess' titles in a move that immediately prompted furious backlash from the parties directly involved.\n\nREAD MORE: Royals left off Remembrance Sunday guest list\n\nThe changes could soon spread across to Britain where questions still remain about the royal titles of King Charles' two grandchildren Archie and Lilibet.\n\nTwo years ago their parents Prince Harry and Meghan dramatically stepped down from their places as senior working royals to pursue a life of financial independence from the monarchy yet still appear to want to retain their royal connections.\n\nRoyal author Angela Levin recently told 9Honey that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were seeking clarity from both the new monarch and Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"The day after the Queen died Harry and Meghan were asking Charles again and again and again whether he was going to give their children titles,\" Levin said.\n\n\"I don't quite know what they want, they want total independence yet they want the titles.\"\n\nThe trajectory of Prince Harry and Meghan's new life got off to a shaky start with the coronavirus pandemic slowing down their plans for philanthropic domination, but with Harry's memoir and two projects with Netflix coming out, they finally appear on track.\n\nSimilarities to the Danish 'spare'\n\nAnd their distant relations in Demark could one day follow suit after a recent shakeup to the country's centuries-old monarchy.\n\nPrince Joachim is related to Prince Harry via Queen Margrethe who is a cousin to the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary's brother-in-law at centre of new royal feud\n\nOn September 28, the 84-year-old announced the children of her youngest son Prince Joachim would no longer have their princely titles nor would they be able to styled as His/Her Royal Highness.\n\nMargrethe II said the decision was \"a necessary safeguard for the future of the monarchy\" and one that would allow her grandchildren to \"shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited\" by the restrictions that come with being a royal.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, that's because Prince Harry and Meghan used the same reasons when announcing their exit. They had previously sought a half-in, half-out approach which would allow them to earn money and occasionally represent the sovereign but that model was swiftly rejected by Elizabeth II.\n\nNow they are free to do what they want without being accused of breaking any so-called royal protocol, even if some of their decisions may seem to be lacking in judgement.\n\nTheir brief time in the royal family had initially brought so much promise of working alongside Prince William and Catherine and the two couples were quickly dubbed the Fab Four.\n\nBut relations soon soured amid claims Meghan and her sister-in-law did not get on, while Prince William's warning to his brother about rushing into marriage still lingered a deep hurt.\n\nSimilar sentiments have surrounded Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie and Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.\n\nREAD MORE: Meghan 'wasn't the least bit interested' in Camilla's welcome attempts\n\nRelations between the two couples have been thrown into the spotlight ever since Queen Margrethe made her shock move.\n\nThe dynamic between Crown Prince Frederik and and brother Prince Joachim have long been said to be strained.\n\nBut this latest twist has exposed a bigger family issue after Princess Marie told reporters the relationship between the couples was \"complicated\".\n\nHer comments to a Danish magazine decision were seen as \"an attack\" on her sister-in-law while Prince Joachim said \"it's never fun to see your children being harmed\", referring to his mother's decision.\n\nTheir choice to speak to the media, instead of issuing a statement via the palace, revealed the depth of the hurt and was the latest example of an already strained situation. It even had echoes of Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah.\n\nThe similarities don't stop there.\n\nUntil recently, the Crown Prince couple, and Joachim and Marie, appeared to get on well even though they rarely attend royal events together anymore.\n\nThe other 'Fab Four'?\n\nThey had seemed to move on from past claims of tensions including a report in 2008 in which Danish tabloid media claimed Joachim had a crush on Mary and only married Marie because of her physical similarities.\n\nA photo of Joachim appearing to try and kiss Mary at a palace gala in 2006 was splashed across one tabloid, fuelling the speculation of a romance between them – a crisis the palace was swift to nip in the bud.\n\nMary and Marie later appeared together at a number of engagements in what seemed to be an attempt to show unity amongst the discord.\n\nThe sisters-in-law attended a night at the opera, with photos emerging of them playing around with their binoculars and sharing a laugh.\n\nSimilar scenes were seen at Wimbledon when Catherine and Meghan sat front row in the Royal Box, talking and laughing amid claims they weren't getting along.\n\nMuch like Prince Harry and Meghan, who didn't like taking secondary place to William and Catherine, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie's role in the Danish royal family has been cut back in recent years.\n\nMoving countries again\n\nThis week, Prince Joachim confirmed he and his family were leaving France just three years after relocating from Denmark for jobs at the Danish embassy in Paris.\n\nJoachim hinted a job in the military was his next step but refused to elaborate further.\n\nBut royal experts in Denmark believe he won't be returning to the Scandinavian country because of the issues with his family.\n\nIn 2019, Joachim and Marie gave an interview to Danish magazine Berlingske about their work in Paris.\n\nJoachim spoke about representing the monarchy abroad, acknowledging he had \"greater freedom\" to pursue his own interests than his older brother, Crown Prince Frederik who is next in line to be King.\n\n\"If you are from a royal family, it is somewhat more framed,\" Joachim said.\n\n\"This is one of the things I have emphasised to the elders of my sons: You are free to do as you please, as long as you behave properly.\n\n\"I have far greater freedom than the Crown Prince to do what I want, but at the same time I am limited in my unfoldment. It was just in that context that I said it.\"\n\nHowever, in 2020, in a separate interview Princess Marie said it was not their own choice to move to France.\n\nIn October, she was asked about those previous comments and whether she viewed it as \"a winding down\" of her family's role in the monarchy.\n\n\"Yes of course,\" Princess Marie told BT.\n\nBut, Marie added, while encouraging their children to be independent and not reliant on a royal allowance it was \"something else to take away a name\", referring to the loss of titles.\n\nThey did, however, stress they had no intention of leaving the Danish royal family altogether.\n\n\"We have never had any doubts about it. I hope no one doubts that,\" Princess Marie said.\n\nLocal journalist Jacob Heinel Jensen later claimed Joachim and Marie \"feel mistreated\" at the hands of the monarchy.\n\nWhatever their future holds, it will be one free from the rules Princess Mary's four children will have to abide by.\n\nPrince Joachim's two elder sons Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix have been working as models for some time now, jobs that could previously have been seen as being at odds with their titles.\n\nPrincess steps down\n\nJust this week, Norway's Princess Martha Louise agreed to step down from all royal duties moving forward, putting an end to a long-running controversy about her financial endeavours and choice of fiancé.\n\nThe 50-year-old princess said the decision was made in consultation with her parents \"to create peace around the royal household\" and allow her to pursue other interests.\n\nAt least one foundation for which Martha Louise served as a patron subsequently ended its connection with the princess.\n\n\"The princess is taking this step to create a clearer dividing line between her business activities and her role as a member of the royal family,\" the palace said.\n\nKing Harald V and Queen Sonja thanked their daughter \"for the important work she has carried out in her official capacity for several decades\".\n\n\"She has performed her duties with warmth, care and deep commitment,\" the statement said.\n\nThe monarch and his wife held a media conference at the palace where they were asked about their daughter's fiancé, American Shaman Durek Verrett – a self-described \"spiritual healer\".\n\nPrincess Martha is preparing to move permanently to the US where she and Verrett will live.\n\n\"The Americans don't understand the significance of this here,\" the King and Queen said.\n\n\"They have no idea what a monarchy is. So it's no wonder he doesn't understand it.\"\n\nBut they were quick to denounce any racist comments towards their soon-to-be son-in-law.\n\n\"The racist attitudes Durek Verrett has been subjected to, especially on social media, we strongly oppose,\" they said.\n\n\"It is a strength that the royal family reflects the ethnic diversity that exists in Norway. \"\n\nNorwegian media have accused Martha Louise and Verrett of using her royal title for commercial gain along with promoting alternative health care methods.\n\nAmerica has become a haven of sorts for Europe's self-exiled royals.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan now call California home, along with Sweden's Princess Madeleine and her American-born husband, Christopher O'Neill who refused a royal title upon their marriage in 2013.\n\nAnd Diana, Princess of Wales, was rumoured to have been planning a move there before her tragic and untimely death in 1997.\n\nBut Princess Madeleine regularly commutes between her home in Miami and the royal family's official residence in Stockholm as she continues to represent the monarchy occasionally.\n\nEurope's royal families appear to be moving with the times by slimming down the number of taxpayer-funded working royals, these 'spares' to the heirs carving out new roles for themselves outside of their former home countries.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nOther 'spares' from royal families across the world"
