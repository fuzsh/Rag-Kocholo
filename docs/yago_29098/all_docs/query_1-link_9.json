        "text": "The Danish royal family saga continues. Prince Joachim of Denmark and his wife, Princess Marie, will move to Washington D.C. later this year, it has been announced, months after his four children were stripped of their prince and princess titles by their grandmother, Queen Margrethe II, in a move that sparked family fury and made headlines around the world. Joachim, Marie and their two young children, who currently live in Paris, will make the move to the US this summer, in time for Prince Joachim to begin a new diplomatic role in September. The announcement on Friday confirms long-rumbling rumours that suggested Prince Joachim would be seeking to leave Denmark in the wake of the title drama.\n\nRead More\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark puts on show of unity with all eight grandchildren as she returns to public duties after surgery\n\nAfter an operation on her back in February, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark made her return at Christian IX’s Palace at Amalienborg on Sunday\n\nAn announcement on the official Danish royal family website, also posted on social media, reveals: ‘On 1 September 2023, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim begins a new position under the Ministry of Defence as defence industry attaché at the Embassy of Denmark in Washington, D.C., where The Prince, as Denmark’s representative, will take part in strengthening the defence industrial cooperation with the USA and Canada in the coming years.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n‘Four years ago, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie, together with the couple’s two children, moved to France. The reason was that Prince Joachim began France’s highest-ranking military education course as a supplement to The Prince’s longtime engagement in The Defence. After the education concluded, both The Prince and The Princess were affiliated with the Embassy of Denmark in Paris as defence attaché and Special Cultural Representative, respectively. Prince Joachim and the family will move to Washington, D.C. during the summer of 2023.’\n\nWhile the statement stresses Joachim’s ongoing role in the Royal Household and his function as an official representative for his country overseas, it comes in the wake of the prince openly speaking of the ‘hurt’ caused by his mother’s decision.\n\nIn September last year, Margrethe II announced her intention to strip Prince Joachim’s four children, Nikolai, 23, Felix, 20, Henrik, 13, and Athena, 11, of the prince and princess titles they had held since birth. The Royal Household stressed in a statement that the decision was taken in line with ‘the Queen’s wish to future-proof’ the monarchy.\n\nRead More\n\nHow this photo of Prince Philip connects Poppy Delevingne and her new beau, Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark\n\nDecades before the stylish pair met, their relatives were rubbing shoulders in Venice\n\nYet the move caused upset among the siblings and their parents. Princess Marie, Joachim’s second wife and the mother of his two younger children, told a Danish tabloid that ‘there’s nothing modern about hurting children’s feelings’; while her husband lamented that such changes should ‘be done in a decent way’. Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, Joachim’s first wife, told Tatler via a spokesperson in the February issue that her two sons ‘can’t start living private lives now – it’s too late.’\n\nQueen Margrethe later added that she was ‘sorry’ for having ‘underestimated how much my youngest son and his family feel affected.’ As of January, the four siblings lost their royal statuses, instead becoming known as the Counts and Countess of Monpezat.\n\nRead More\n\nCount Nikolai of Monpezat makes his Instagram debut to mark new chapter after being stripped of prince title by his grandmother, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nNikolai and his siblings were stripped of their prince and princess titles by their grandmother, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, in a move that caused ‘shock’ and ‘hurt’\n\nPrince Joachim of Denmark currently lives in Paris with Marie and their two children, while Count Nikolai and Count Felix of Monpezat reside in Copenhagen. Given their age and more independent lives, it is likely the two older brothers will not move fully to the US, but will no doubt spend more time in Washington D.C. visiting their father and half siblings.\n\nJoachim’s decision will no doubt spark comparisons with another royal second son, the Duke of Sussex, who also decided to build a new life with his family in the US. Joachim previously commented on Prince Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey, calling it ‘brave’. Princess Madeleine of Sweden, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, and Princess Martha-Louise of Norway also live in the US.\n\nRead More\n\nQueen Margrethe of Denmark apologises for stripping ‘shocked’ grandchildren of HRH status\n\nThe Danish monarch announced the decision to remove the prince and princess titles of her second son’s children, in order to ‘allow the siblings to shape their own lives’\n\nJoachim’s older brother, Crown Prince Frederick (whose four children have retained their prince and princess titles), is currently serving as regent in their mother’s place, while Queen Margrethe recovers from ‘extensive’ back surgery."
