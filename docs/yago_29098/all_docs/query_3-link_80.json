        "text": "So it's happened. Denmark's Queen Margrethe II has \"downgraded\" her four grandchildren from princes and princess after announcing last year that she intended to trim down the upper ranks of the monarchy.\n\nThe four are the children of Prince Joachim: Nikolai (23) and Felix (20) from his first marriage to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg; and Henrik (13) and Athena (10) from his current marriage to Princess Marie. All the kids will now be known as the Counts and Countess of Monpezat and will retain their places in the line of succession.\n\nREAD MORE| Ciggies, dogs and plenty of family drama: the colourful reign of Denmark's feisty Queen Margrethe\n\nQueen Margrethe said in September she would be removing their titles so they could live normal lives without having to carry out royal duties.\n\n“The queen wishes to create the framework for the four grandchildren to be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent,” a statement from the palace said.\n\nHowever, the announcement caused a rift in the family.\n\nJoachim (53) said he was sad his children were being \"mistreated,\" adding that they were also upset by the queen's seemingly out-of-the-blue decision.\n\n“I was given five days' notice to tell them,\" Joachim said. \"I was presented with a plan which was that when the children each turned 25, it would happen.\n\nNikolai told a local newspaper he was \"shocked and confused\" by his grandmother's decision, while Joachim said he'd been left feeling \"bewildered\".\n\nIn response, the queen admitted she'd overlooked the shock her decision would have on the family, but she said it was essential for it to be done to future-proof the monarchy.\n\n\"My decision has been a long time coming. With my 50 years on the throne, it is natural both to look back and to look ahead,\" the queen said.\n\n\"It is my duty and my desire as queen to ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times. Sometimes, this means that difficult decisions must be made, and it will always be difficult to find the right moment.\"\n\nWhile she made her \"decision as queen, mother and grandmother\", the Danish monarch admitted that \"as a mother and grandmother\" she \"underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry.\n\n\"No one should be in doubt that my children, daughters-in-law and grandchildren are my great joy and pride. I now hope that we as a family can find the peace to find our way through this situation.\"\n\nJoachim and Marie spent Christmas with the four children in Vietnam, where his late father, Prince Henrik, grew up.\n\nIn the queen's new year address, she said, “I always feel great love for my entire family. Difficulties and misunderstandings may arise in any family, also in mine. The whole country has witnessed that.\n\n“We have now had a quieter period and time for reflection, and I am sure that our family can embark on the new year together with confidence, understanding, and new courage.”"
