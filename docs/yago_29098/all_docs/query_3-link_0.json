        "text": "Princess Marie of Denmark has said she and her husband Prince Joachim were ‘not happy about the way’ their children were stripped of their titles by Queen Margrethe II.\n\nQueen Margrethe made the decision to strip the children of their titles in late 2022; thereafter, from the beginning of 2023 they were known as Counts and Countesses of Monpezat, rather than HRH. These changes affected Joachim’s two older children, whom he shares with his first wife, Alexandra (Nikolai, 24 and Felix, 21) and his two younger children, with whom he lives in Washington (Henrik, 14 and Athena, 11.)\n\nRead More\n\nHostages to Fortune: How J Paul Getty set the tone for a gilded dynasty like no other\n\nWhen the world’s richest private citizen Jean Paul Getty died, he left his descendants colossal wealth and a streak of wildness in their DNA. But are the many scions creative or cursed? James Reginato finds out in his gripping book, extracted in Tatler’s August 2022 issue\n\nAfter the news was made public, Prince Joachim of Denmark relocated to the United States with his family. Now, the couple have spoken to the Washington Post about the Queen's decision, confessing it had been a challenging time for the family.\n\nMarie said it was about more than ‘just a title’, saying, ‘We weren’t happy about the way it happened. But it’s a family thing. It’s complicated. It’s also their name. It’s their identity since they were born. So it’s more than just what people see as a title.’ Joachim went on to add that the family have since tried to put the row behind them, saying, ‘We’ve moved on.’\n\nThe decision to strip Joachim’s children of their royal titles seems to be a decision Margrethe took without much consultation with the remainder of the family. Following the announcement in September 2022 of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark’s decision, her second son, Prince Joachim, expressed his dismay at the move, saying that the family were ‘very sad’ and had been ‘put in a situation they do not understand’, adding: ‘It’s never fun to see your children being harmed.’\n\nJoachim’s former wife said in the autumn that her two sons were ‘saddened and in shock’, with a spokesman telling Se og Hør magazine: ‘The children feel ostracised. They cannot understand why their identity is being taken away from them.’ The Telegraph adds that Joachim’s current wife, Princess Marie of Denmark, told the press that their youngest child, Athena, had been bullied at school. The oldest of Joachim’s children, meanwhile, Nikolai, told Ekstra Bladet: ‘We are… in shock at this decision and at how quickly it has actually gone… I am very confused as to why it has to happen like this.’\n\nThe decision caused a significant rift - the family spent Christmas in 2022 apart, breaking with a time-honoured tradition. His mother made a public apology for having ‘underestimated’ the hurt caused to Joachim’s four children – Nikolai, Felix, Henrik and Athena – and their parents, but stressed that she took the action ‘to ensure that the monarchy continues to shape itself in keeping with the times’.\n\nTensions appeared to heal, with time. Both Prince Joachim and Prince Frederik, along with their children, joined the Queen at Marselisborg Palace, the customary Christmas venue for Danish royals, in 2023.\n\nHowever, Princess Marie and the children did not join Prince Joachim or the rest of the royal family at King Frederik's accession. Their absence from the major family event was read by some as a sign of tension. Others contended that this was precisely Queen Margrethe’s intention when she stripped the titles from Joachim’s children: intending to relieve them of their royal obligations in favour of a normal life. A palace spokesperson was certainly at pains to suggest this: ‘Prince Joachim will be there, but the children go to school, there is no special reason.’"
