        "text": "Guidelines for receipt of gifts\n\nAs a general rule, The Royal House of Denmark and the members of The Royal House of Denmark solely receive gifts in connection with official arrangements, trips and visits as well as the marking of special events such as, for example, birthdays and anniversaries. Gifts received on such special occasions will be disclosed publicly together with The Royal House of Denmark’s annual report with a description of the gift and with information about the giver of the gift and the occasion on which the gift was given, unless the gifts are made public in connection with the promise of a gift or the handing over of a gift, or unless the gifts have a modest (if any) economic value.\n\nHowever, as a general rule, gifts from private companies will not be received. In the instances when a gift is accepted, for example because the gift was made especially for The Royal House of Denmark, or because the gift is given during an official company visit, the gift will be made public together with The Royal House of Denmark’s annual report with a description of the gift and with information about the giver of the gift. Gifts which have a modest (if any) value will, however, not be disclosed publicly.\n\nGifts of personal nature which members of The Royal Family receive from family and friends are considered by The Royal House of Denmark as a private matter, and such gifts will not be made public.\n\nPublication of gifts will take place for the first time in August 2024, with effect for the first six months of 2024. Afterwards, publication will take place yearly together with The Royal House of Denmark’s annual report."
