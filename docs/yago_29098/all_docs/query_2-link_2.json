        "text": "After the surprise abdication of Queen Margrethe II on new year’s eve, anticipation has been hot for 14th January, the day on which her son will accede the throne as Frederik X, along with his consort, Queen Mary. However, news has broken that several members of the Danish royal family will not be in attendance at the momentous occasion. Prince Joachim, Frederik’s brother, will be in Copenhagen to support him, but Joachim will be without any members of his family. His wife Princess Marie, and his children will all be absent.\n\nHaving enjoyed a long career in Denmark’s military, Prince Joachim now works as an attaché to the Danish embassy in Washington – this would mean a long journey home for his two younger children, whom he shares with his second wife, Princess Marie. However, after the recent row concerning Queen Margrethe’s decision to strip Joachim’s children of their titles, their absence may also be read as a sign of tension. Others might well contend that this was precisely Queen Margrethe’s intention when she stripped the titles from Joachim’s children: intending to relieve them of their royal obligations in favour of a normal life. A palace spokesperson was certainly at pains to suggest this: ‘Prince Joachim will be there, but the children go to school, there is no special reason.’\n\nRead More\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark visited her Scottish cousins for a wee dram before her wedding to Frederik\n\nAfter the shock abdication of Queen Margrethe II, Crown Princess Mary is set to become queen on 14th January – she maintains a strong affinity with Scotland, as her pre-wedding Tia Maria with ‘Tantie Margaret’ shows\n\nQueen Margrethe made the decision to strip the children of their titles in late 2022; thereafter, from the beginning of 2023 they were known as Counts and Countesses of Monpezat, rather than HRH. These changes affected Joachim’s two older children, whom he shares with his first wife, Alexandra (Nikolai, 24 and Felix, 21) and his two younger children, with whom he lives in Washington (Henrik, 14 and Athena, 11.)\n\nOn Sunday, as Frederik becomes King, there will be no special fanfare – it is not coronation as we know it in Britain. Rather, the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, will simply proclaim the new King from the balcony of Christianborg Palace, after which announcement, he will greet crowds. Queen Margrethe is renowned for having modernised the Danish monarchy, completely reversing its fortunes and restoring it to an overwhelming popularity in the small country. Margrethe’s abdication came after 52 years on the throne – and Frederik’s accession will take place on the same day as Margrethe’s own, 52 years ago.\n\nRead More\n\nHow Queen Margrethe ‘refashioned’ the Danish monarchy – both in its modernity but also in its scope for regal style which she has reimagined with artistic verve\n\nOpalescent jewel-tones are the go-to for Queen Margrethe, but this Scandinavian sovereign’s style is far from stereotypical tiara-wearing royal. On her 84th birthday, Tatler revisits her most daring fashion moments\n\nIn her abdication announcement on New Year’s eve, Margrethe said: ‘Thank you for the overwhelming warmth and support which I have received during all these years. Thank you to the changing governments with whom the collaboration always has been rewarding, and thank you to The Parliament, who have always vested their confidence in me.\n\n‘It is my hope that the new King and Queen will be met with the same trust and devotion which have fallen to my lot. They deserve it! Denmark deserves it! I will conclude my new year's address in my usual manner: God bless Denmark, God bless you all’.\n\nThe decision to strip Joachim’s children of their royal titles seems to be a decision Margrethe took without much consultation with the remainder of the family. It caused a significant rift which led to Joachim publicly expressing his upset – the family spent Christmas that year apart, breaking with a time-honoured tradition. Margrethe later apologised and tensions seem to have healed. Fans of the Danish royal family will hope that the absence of Joachim’s family from the coronation will simply represent an attempt to put Margrehte’s idea into practice: to remove the pressures of royalty from Joachim’s young family. As the Queen said at the time, ‘To wear a royal title entails a number of obligations and tasks, which will in the future restrain fewer members of the royal family’."
