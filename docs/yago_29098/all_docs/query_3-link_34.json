        "text": "The Danish Royal House has released a new portrait of the royal family to mark the 50th anniversary of Queen Margrethe II’s accession to the throne. The 81-year-old monarch was photographed sitting in the green salon of Christian VII’s Palace surrounded by her family.\n\nThe image features the Queen’s sister Princess Benedikte, sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, daughters-in-law, Crown Princess Mary and Princess Marie, and her eight grandchildren, Prince Christian, 16, Princess Isabella, 14, Prince Vincent, 11 Princess Josephine, 11, Prince Nikolai, 22, Prince Felix, 19, Prince Henrik, 12, and Princess Athena, nine. Margrethe’s sister Queen Anne-Marie of Greece was unable to travel to Denmark because her husband King Constantine had COVID-19.\n\nThe royal family’s portrait was taken at Christian VII’s Palace at Amalienborg prior to a private dinner hosted by the Crown Prince Couple. The Queen’s family surprised her with the “secretly-arranged dinner” on Friday, Jan. 14.\n\nThe table for the dinner was set with the Flora Danica service, which according to the royal house is the most precious Danish dinner service. Friday’s dinner was the first time the service had been used in the Royal House of Denmark since Queen Ingrid’s 80th birthday back in 1990."
