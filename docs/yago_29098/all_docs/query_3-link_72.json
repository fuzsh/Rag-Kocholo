        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDenmark Queen Margrethe II is the commander-in-chief of the Danish Defence. She is Europe's longest-serving current head of state, having reigned as Denmark's monarch for over 50 years and the world's only current Queen regnant\n\nDenmark's Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has declared that her grandchildren of royal titles - Prince Felix, Prince Nikolai, Princess Athena, and Prince Henrik -- can no longer be addressed as princes and princesses\n\nDenmark Queen Margrethe II is the commander-in-chief of the Danish Defence. She is Europe's longest-serving current head of state, having reigned as Denmark's monarch for over 50 years and the world's only current Queen regnant\n\nThe Danish royal family has revealed that Queen Margrethe has denied her four grandchildren their royal titles. The Queen, 82, has denied the titles of prince and princess, as well as 'His/Her Highness', from her second son, Prince Nikolai, Joachim, Felix, Athena, and Henrik.\n\nAccording to a statement released on Wednesday, Queen Margrethe II believes that the move would allow the siblings to \"create their own lives without being bound by the unique considerations and obligations\" that a formal affiliation with the Danish Royal Family entails.\n\nLater that day, Queen Margrethe II stated that it was her long-held vision, and she believed it would benefit them in the future. The siblings, who are presently seventh through tenth in the line of succession, will retain their positions. Their new titles, His Excellency Count of Monpezat or Her Excellency Countess of Monpezat, will become effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nFelix and Nikolai are sons of Prince Joachim and Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, his first wife.\n\nIn 2008, Prince Joachim married his second wife, Princess Marie, and the couple had two children, Athena and Henrik. The couple and youngest children live in Paris.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho is Margrethe II?\n\nMargrethe II is Queen of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defense.\n\nHow did the Queen ascend to the throne?\n\nMargrethe took over after her father died on January 14, 1972.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
