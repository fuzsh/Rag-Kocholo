        "text": "Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, better known as Prince Joachim of Denmark is the youngest son of Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik of Denmark (d. 2018).\n\nHis brother, Prince Frederik, was the first-born son and therefore, in light of the Queen’s abdication, will be the son who takes to the throne and becomes King of Denmark.\n\nWATCH NOW: THE Danish Royals, 2016. Article continues after video.\n\nJoachim, Prince of Denmark, Count of Monzepat, was born June 7, 1969 in Copenhagen. His mother tongue is Danish however Prince Joachim also speaks French, English, and German.\n\nHis education began at Krebs’ Skole during the years 1974 to 1982. Between 1982 and 1983 he was a boarder at Ecole des Roches in Normandy, France.\n\nPrince Joachim had an extensive career and education working and studying across the globe in places such as Denmark, France, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about Prince Joachim…\n\nWho is Prince Joachim’s first wife?\n\nPrince Joachim’s first marriage was with Alexandra Christina Manley. The two married on November 18, 1995, at Frederiksborg Palace Church in Hillerod, near Copenhagen. Alexandra was born in Hong Kong on June 30, 1964… she met Prince Joachim in Hong Kong at a party in the city where Prince Joachim was working for a Danish shipping company. Alexandra became HRH Princess Alexandra of Denmark after their wedding. They had two children together: HE Count Nikolai and HE Count Felix. In 2004, Joachim and Alexandra announced their divorce… it was the first split in the royal family since 1846.\n\nWho is Prince Joachim married to now?\n\nPrince Joachim married his now-wife, Marie Agathe Odile Cavallier (becoming HRH Princess Marie of Denmark, Countess of Monzepat) on May 24, 2008. The couple had their wedding ceremony in Mongeltonder Church and had the wedding banquet at Schackenborg Castle. Princess Marie was born in Paris, France on February 6, 1976. In an interview with HELLO! in 2016, Prince Joachim revealed that “it was pure coincidence that [they] met.”\n\n“I was married at the time. But because we happened to be the only two French-speaking people at the dinner, our host seated us next to each other. And as Marie had never been to Denmark it was fun to talk to her. Our romance, however, started much later,” he said. The couple now have two children together: HE Count Henrik and HE Countess Athena. Prince Joachim and Princess Marie reside in Washington with their two children Henrik and Athena.\n\nWho are the children of Prince Joachim of Denmark?\n\nPrince Joachim has four children: HE Count Nikolai born August 28, 1999, HE Count Felix born July 22, 2002, HE Count Henrik born May 4, 2009, and HE Countess Athena born January 24, 2012. His two first-born sons, Nikolai and Felix, are the children Prince Joachim has with his first wife, Alexandra, and his two youngest, Henrik and Athena are the children of his second wife, Marie.\n\nWhat does Prince Joachim do for a living?\n\nPrince Joachim works as an army officer working as a military industry attaché at the Danish Embassy in Washington. He began his work as a military attaché in September 2020 at the Danish Embassy in Paris however he then obtained the permanent rank of brigadier general and in 2023, left Paris to join the Danish Embassy in Washington where he remains now. His extensive military background began in 1987 when he began his military education as a recruit in the Queen’s Own Regiment. The following year he was appointed as a sergeant and then the year after that he was appoitned as a lieutenant of the reserve. Prince Joachim continued to work his way up and was continuously appointed to higher ranks over the years until reaching his current rank of brigadier general."
