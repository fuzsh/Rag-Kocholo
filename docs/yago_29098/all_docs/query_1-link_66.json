        "text": "Prince Joachim of Denmark opens medical centre in 2019\n\nThe Denmark Palace announced on Friday that Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie of Denmark will move to the US later this year. The couple and their children — 11-year-old Countess Athena of Denmark and 13-year-old Henrik, Count of Monpezat — will relocate to Washington this summer. It comes after several reports of unrest within the Danish royal family, exacerbated by a recent title cull which saw Joachim’s children lose their prince and princess titles. Now, a royal commentator has claimed there is “clear bitterness” between the Prince and his family, namely his mother Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who stripped her four grandchildren of their princely styles.\n\nBrittani Barger, deputy editor at Royal Central, explained that tensions between the royals have remained since Queen Margrethe announced her decision back in September.\n\nShe told Express.co.uk: “There’s clear bitterness after his children were stripped of their Highness styles and Prince/Princess titles. Joachim has made his opinions on that clear.”\n\nJoachim immediately expressed his displeasure with his mother’s decision, telling B.T.: “I can say that my children are sad. My kids don’t know which leg to stand on. What they should believe. Why should their identity be removed? Why must they be punished in that way?”\n\nHe claimed he was given five days’ notice, but the Royal Household disputed the assertion, saying the Prince was informed in May.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince and Princess of Denmark to leave for US after upset over titles\n\nMeghan and Harry losing titles a 'very real possibility' as King considers nuclear option\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have been warned there is a \"very real possibility\" they could be stripped of their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe couple have fuelled speculation about the King reconsidering their positions in light of their repeated attacks on the Royal Family.\n\nRead more HERE.\n\nJoachim's four children — Prince Nikolai, 23, Prince Felix, 20, Prince Henrik, 13, and Princess Athena, 11, — were impacted by the change, which came into effect on January 1.\n\nQueen Margrethe decided that “His Royal Highness Prince Joachim’s descendants can only use their titles as counts and countess of Monpezat, as the titles of prince and princess that they have held up until now will be discontinued. Prince Joachim’s descendants will thus have to be addressed as excellencies in the future. The Queen’s decision is in line with similar adjustments that other royal houses have made in various ways in recent years,” per the Danish Royal House.\n\n“With her decision, Her Majesty The Queen wishes to create the framework for the four grandchildren to be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited by the special considerations and duties that a formal affiliation with the Royal House of Denmark as an institution involves,” the statement added.\n\nJoachim’s first wife and eldest son also made their unhappiness with the decision known.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nHelle von Wildenrath Løvgreen, press secretary to Countess Alexandra, who is the mother of Nikolai and Felix, told CNN: “She can’t believe why and why now, because there’s no good reason.\n\n“They would lose their titles anyway when they get married one day. Her sons are young men so maybe they might get married in the near future so why shouldn’t it wait until that day so that the titles would disappear on a happy day?”\n\n“It’s just their loss of identity and it’s very hard for little children and young men. As Prince Nikolai said to me: ‘What will they write in my passport now?’” Ms Løvgreen added.\n\nNikolai also spoke with the press, saying: “We are, as my parents have also stated, in shock at this decision and at how quickly it has actually gone. I don’t understand why it had to happen this way.”\n\nFollowing the fallout, Margrethe weighed in once more, writing in a statement: “In recent days, there have been strong reactions to my decision about the future use of titles for Prince Joachim’s four children. That affects me, of course.\n\n“My decision has been a long time coming. With my 50 years on the throne, it is natural both to look back and to look ahead. It is my duty and my desire as Queen to ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times. Sometimes, this means that difficult decisions must be made, and it will always be difficult to find the right moment.\n\nThe Queen wrote of “future-proofing,” and ensuring the continuation of the monarchy, saying: “Holding a royal title involves a number of commitments and duties that, in the future, will lie with fewer members of the royal family. This adjustment, which I view as a necessary future-proofing of the monarchy, I want to take in my own time.\n\nShe added: “I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry.”\n\nDon't miss...\n\nPOLL: Should Prince Andrew write a memoir to boost finances? [POLL]\n\nKate and William 'carefully' making 'sure they never put a foot wrong' [LATEST]\n\nHarry and Meghan 'want rift healed on their terms' [EXCLUSIVE]\n\nMargrethe’s eldest son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, shares four children with his wife Crown Princess Mary, who were not affected by the change.\n\nAs Ms Barger explained: “The Danish line of succession is secured, and Prince Christian (Frederik and Mary’s eldest son) will soon be 18.”\n\nThe commentator argued that Joachim and Marie’s decision to relocate to the US is unsurprising. She said: “Prince Joachim and his family haven’t lived in Denmark in a few years as he was stationed in Paris as a military attaché…Remaining outside Denmark doesn’t come as a shock…Joachim and his family don’t have to be in Denmark.”\n\nReports of their move first surfaced in November, but last month, Marie seemed to indicate they weren’t true, telling Paris Match Magazine that “nothing has been confirmed, nothing has been announced, so [the rumours] don’t come from us”.\n\nHowever, an announcement on the official Kongehuset website, which was also posted on social media, confirmed the speculation.\n\nIt revealed: “On 1 September 2023, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim begins a new position under the Ministry of Defence as defence industry attaché at the Embassy of Denmark in Washington, D.C., where The Prince, as Denmark’s representative, will take part in strengthening the defence industrial cooperation with the USA and Canada in the coming years.\n\n“Four years ago, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie, together with the couple’s two children, moved to France. The reason was that Prince Joachim began France’s highest-ranking military education course as a supplement to The Prince’s longtime engagement in The Defence.”\n\nIt continued: “After the education concluded, both The Prince and The Princess were affiliated with the Embassy of Denmark in Paris as defence attaché and Special Cultural Representative, respectively. Prince Joachim and the family will move to Washington, D.C. during the summer of 2023.”"
