        "text": "Queen Margrethe of Denmark strips grandchildren of royal titles\n\nPrince Joachim of Denmark will see his older brother Crown Prince Frederik ascend to the throne without his family by his side, as his wife and children will remain at home in Washington.\n\nA spokesperson from Christiansborg Palace confirmed the news, saying: \"Prince Joachim will be there, but the children go to school, there is no special reason.\"\n\nThey added that the Prince would return to the US the following day, where he and his family are currently living while he works as an attaché to the Ministry of Defence.\n\nOn New Year's Eve Queen Margrethe announced to the world that after 52 years of the throne she had chosen to abdicate and leave the throne to her son and heir.\n\nIt was the second shock announcement from the Danish Queen, as the previous year she revealed that her younger son Joachim's children would lose their HRH titles, and would instead be known as Counts and Countesses of Monpezat.\n\nREAD MORE: Get 75% off annual subscription to Emily Ferguson's exclusive royal newsletter\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Royal news\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

It's never fun to see your children being mistreated like that. They themselves find themselves in a situation they do not understand.\n\nMargrethe later apologised for any misunderstanding or distress caused, as her grandchildren continue to hold their places in the line of succession despite the title change.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

To wear a royal title entails a number of obligations and tasks, which will in the future restrain fewer members of the Royal Family.\"\n\nThis Sunday, January 14, will see the new King Frederik X be proclaimed monarch by the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace.\n\nHis wife Crown Princess Mary and their four children, Prince Christian, 18, Princess Isabella, 16 and 13-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Isabella will be accompanying him.\n\nIn her New Year's Eve speech Queen Margrethe stated: \"I have decided that now is the right time. The 14th January 2024 – 52 years after I followed my beloved father – I will step back as the Queen of Denmark. I leave the throne to my son the Crown Prince Frederik.\n\n\"Thank you for the overwhelming warmth and support which I have received during all these years. Thank you to the changing governments with whom the collaboration always has been rewarding, and thank you to The Parliament, who have always vested their confidence in me.\n\n\"It is my hope that the new King and Queen will be met with the same trust and devotion which have fallen to my lot. They deserve it! Denmark deserves it! I will conclude my new year's address in my usual manner: GOD BLESS DENMARK, GOD BLESS YOU ALL.\""
