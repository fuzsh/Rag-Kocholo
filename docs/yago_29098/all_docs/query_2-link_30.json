        "text": "The Royal family of Denmark is the dynastic family of the monarch of Denmark. Some members of the Danish royal family hold the title of \"Prince/Princess of Denmark\", and descendants of Queen Margrethe II also bear the title \"Count/Countess of Monpezat\". The King and Queen are styled His/Her Majesty, while their children are accorded the style His/Her Royal Highness.\n\nMargrethe, her siblings, and her descendants belong to the House of Glücksburg, which is a branch of the House of Oldenburg. Margrethe's children and male-line descendants also belong agnatically to the House of Monpezat, and were given the concurrent title \"Count/Countess of Monpezat\" by royal decree on 30 April 2008.\n\nThe Danish royal family receives remarkably high approval ratings in Denmark, ranging between 82% and 92%.\n\nMain members[]\n\nThe Danish Royal Family includes:\n\nTM The King and The Queen\n\nHRH The Crown Prince\n\nHRH Princess Isabella\n\nHRH Prince Vincent\n\nHRH Princess Josephine\n\nHM Queen Margrethe II\n\nTRH Prince Joachim and Princess Marie\n\nHE Count Nikolai\n\nHE Count Felix\n\nHE Count Henrik\n\nHE Countess Athena\n\nHRH Princess Benedikte\n\nHM Queen Anne-Marie of Greece\n\nMembers of the extended royal family[]\n\nRoyal family of Greece[]\n\nMain article: Royal family of Greece\n\nMost of the members of the deposed royal family of Greece hold the title of \"Prince/Princess of Greece and Denmark\" with the qualification of His/Her Highness, pursuant to the Royal Cabinet Order of 1974 and as agnatic descendants of George I of Greece, who, as the son of Christian IX of Denmark, was a \"Prince of Denmark\" prior to his accession to the throne of Greece in 1863. Until 1953, George's dynastic male-line descendants remained in Denmark's order of succession. However, no Danish act has revoked usage of the princely title for these descendants, neither for those living in 1953, nor for those born subsequently or who have since married into the dynasty.\n\nThere are three members of the Greek royal family who are not known to bear the title of \"Prince/Princess of Denmark\" with the qualification of His/Her Highness.\n\nMarina, Consort of Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Greece\n\nPrincess Olga, Duchess of Apulia\n\nThe following, consorts of royal monarchs today, were born with the titles of \"Prince/Princess of Greece and Denmark\", although they are not descended from Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie:\n\nHM Queen Sofía of Spain\n\nRoyal family of Norway[]\n\nMain article: Royal family of Norway\n\nThe royal family of Norway descends in the legitimate male line from Frederick VIII of Denmark. Haakon VII of Norway, Frederick VIII's younger son, like his uncle George I of Greece, was invited to reign over another nation.\n\nAs with the Greek branch's descendants, members of the Norwegian line no longer have succession rights to the Danish crown. However, unlike the Greek dynasts, they discontinued the use of Danish royal titles upon ascending to their foreign throne in 1905.\n\nCounts and countesses of Monpezat[]\n\nOn 30 April 2008, Margrethe II granted to her two sons, then-Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, and their legitimate patrilineal descendants of both sexes the hereditary title \"Count of Monpezat\". The title is based on the French title \"Comte de Laborde de Monpezat,\" which was used by their father Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark.\n\nOn 29 September 2022, it was announced that from 1 January 2023, the titles of \"Prince and Princess of Denmark\", and style of Highness of Prince Joachim's four children, would be discontinued. They are now titled His/Her Excellency \"Count/Countess of Monpezat\". All four children maintain their places in the order of succession to the throne.\n\nCounts and countesses of Rosenborg[]\n\nDanish princes who marry without the consent of the Danish monarch lose their succession rights, as do their descendants. They are then usually accorded the hereditary title \"Count of Rosenborg\". They are entitled to the style His/Her Excellency. They and their legitimate male-line descendants are:\n\nTE Count Ingolf and Countess Sussie\n\nHE Countess Josephine\n\nHE Countess Camilla\n\nHE Countess Feodora\n\nTE Count Ulrik and Countess Judi\n\nHE Count Philip\n\nHE Countess Katharina\n\nHE Countess Charlotte\n\nTE Count Axel and Countess Jutta\n\nHE Countess Julie\n\nHE Count Carl Johan\n\nHE Countess Désirée\n\nHE Count Alexander\n\nTE Count Birger and Countess Lynne\n\nHE Countess Benedikte\n\nTE Count Carl Johan and Countess Lisa Jeanne\n\nHE Countess Caroline\n\nHE Countess Josephine\n\nHE Countess Désirée\n\nHE Countess Karin\n\nHE Count Valdemar\n\nHE Count Nicolai\n\nHE Countess Marie\n\nHE Countess Marina\n\nCounts and countesses of Samsøe[]\n\nMembers of the House of Danneskiold-Samsøe are descendants of the eldest son of Christian V and his mistress Sofie Amalie Moth, whom the king elevated to be the first Lensgrevinde til Samsø (\"Countess of Samsø\"). By royal statutory regulation, the Counts of Danneskiold-Samsøe and their male-line descendants are ranked as the second-highest nobles in Denmark, second only to the Counts of Rosenborg, whom also descend from the Danish kings. With a place in the 1st Class No. 13, they are entitled to the style His/Her Excellency.\n\nLine of Succession[]\n\nMain article: Succession to the Danish throne\n\nThe first law governing the succession to the Danish throne as a hereditary monarchy was Kongeloven (Lex Regia), enacted on 14 November 1665, and published in 1709. It declared that the crown of Denmark descends by heredity to the legitimate descendants of Frederick III, and that the order of succession follows semi-Salic primogeniture, according to which the crown is inherited by an heir, with preference among the monarch's children to men over women; among siblings to the elder over the younger; and among Frederick III's remoter descendants by substitution, senior branches over junior branches. Female descendants were eligible to inherit the throne in the event there were no eligible surviving male dynasts born in the male line.\n\nAs for the duchies, Holstein and Lauenburg where the King ruled as duke, these lands adhered to Salic law, in which only men could inherit the ducal throne, and by mutual agreement, were permanently conjoined. The duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief), Holstein and Lauenburg (German fiefs) were joined in personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nThis difference caused problems when Frederick VII didn't produce any children, making a change in dynasty imminent, and causing the lines of succession for the duchies on one hand and for Denmark on the other to diverge. To ensure that future Kings of Denmark would continue also being Dukes of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg, the line of succession to the duchies was modified in the London Protocol of 1852, which designated Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, as the new heir apparent, although he was, strictly, the heir neither to the Kingdom of Denmark nor to the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein, or Lauenburg by primogeniture. Originally, the Danish prime minister Christian Albrecht Bluhme wanted to keep the separate hereditary principles, but in the end, the government decided on a uniform agnatic primogeniture, which was accepted by the Parliament. Even after the loss of the duchies in the Second Schleswig War of 1864, the style of the Danish monarchs included references to the duchies until the style was shortened in 1972 on the accession of Margrethe II.\n\nProblems emerged again when Frederik IX became king in 1947. He had only daughters, and it seemed unlikely that he would have a son, leaving his brother Prince Knud as heir presumptive. As part of the 1953 constitutional referendum, a new Act of Succession introduced male-preference primogeniture, allowing women with no brothers to inherit. In 2009, the succession law was amended after the Act of Succession referendum, this time to introduce absolute primogeniture. This had no immediate effect on the line of succession, and the first person affected by the 2009 amendment was Prince Vincent, who at his birth in 2011 would have otherwise been ahead of his older sister Princess Isabella in the line of succession.\n\nThe current line of succession is:\n\nThe Crown Prince\n\nPrincess Isabella\n\nPrince Vincent\n\nPrincess Josephine\n\nPrince Joachim\n\nCount Nikolai\n\nCount Felix\n\nCount Henrik\n\nCountess Athena\n\nPrincess Benedikte1\n\n1Princess Benedikte's children have no succession rights. The marriage consent given to her had very specific provisions; if Benedikte ever became the heir presumptive, she and her husband would have to take permanent residence in Denmark and her children would only have succession rights if they had applied for naturalization upon reaching adulthood and had taken up residence in Denmark (a) at the time of becoming the immediate heir to the throne and (b) no later than when they reached the age of mandatory schooling under Danish law. Since her children continued to be educated in Germany well past the mandatory schooling age, they are deemed to no longer have succession rights.\n\nPrivileges and restrictions[]\n\nFollowing the transformation of Denmark's monarchy from elective (at least theoretically, although it had generally descended to the eldest son of the House of Oldenburg since 1448) to hereditary in 1660, the so-called Kongelov established reign \"by the grace of God\" to Frederick III and his posterity. Of the articles of this law, all except Article 21 and Article 25 have since been repealed by amendments to the Constitution in 1849, 1853, 1953, and 2009.\n\nArticle 21 states \"No Prince of the Blood, who resides here in the Realm and in Our territory, shall marry, or leave the Country, or take service under foreign Masters, unless he receives Permission from the King\". Under this provision, princes of Denmark who permanently reside in other realms by express permission of the Danish Crown (i.e. members of the dynasties of Greece, Norway and the United Kingdom) do not thereby forfeit their royalty in Denmark, nor are they bound to obtain prior permission to travel abroad or to marry from its sovereign, although since 1953 those not descended in male-line from Christian X are no longer in the line of succession to the Danish throne. However, those who do reside in Denmark or its territories require the monarch's prior permission to travel abroad and to marry.\n\nArticle 25 stipulates, with respect to blood members of the royal dynasty, \"They should answer to no Magistrate Judges, but their first and last Judge shall be the King, or to whomsoever He decrees.\" The wording excludes those whose blood cannot be traced to a Danish monarch (e.g. the present Queen).\n\n[]\n\nKongehuset.dk Official site of the Danish Monarchy.\n\nTemplate:European Royal Families"
