        "text": "Prince Joachim of Denmark is making headlines alongside his wife after their children were stripped of their royal titles.\n\nQueen Margrethe II announced the changes on September 28, in what is the biggest shakeup to the Danish royal family\n\nBut the monarch's decision has started a war-of-words of sorts among the royal family's key players, including Crown Princess Mary.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen says 'sorry' for stripping grandchildren of royal titles\n\nWho is Prince Joachim?\n\nPrince Joachim, 53, is the youngest son of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and the late Prince Henrik.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Joachim accuses Queen of harming her grandchildren\n\nHe is sixth-in-line to the Danish throne after his brother Crown Prince Frederik and his nieces and nephews, Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nHe is the brother-in-law of Australian-born Crown Princess Mary.\n\nPrince Joachim's two eldest sons Prince Nikolai, 23, and Prince Felix, 20, are from his first marriage to Alexandra Countess of Frederiksborg.\n\nJoachim later married Princess Marie in 2008 and had Prince Henrik, 13, and Princess Athena, 10.\n\nChildren stripped of royal titles\n\nFrom January 1, 2023, Prince Joachim's four children will no longer will no longer be able to use their titles of prince and princess.\n\nThey also won't have the status of His/Her Royal Highness.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary's sister-in-law says relationship is 'complicated'\n\nAll four children will be allowed to keep their aristocratic titles of count and countess of Monpezat and will be known as His Excellency Count of Monpezat or Her Excellency Countess of Monpezat.\n\nThe line of succession remains unchanged.\n\nTheir grandmother Queen Margrethe, 84, said the move would allow the children \"to shape their own lives\" into the future.\n\n\"The Queen's decision is in line with similar adjustments that other royal houses have made in various ways in recent years,\" the palace said.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary defends Queen over changes to royal title\n\nLess than a week later, the Queen issued an extraordinary apology to her four grandchildren.\n\nBut the monarch is standing by her \"difficult\" decision saying was \"a long time coming\" and her \"duty\" as Queen.\n\nMargrethe said she was \"sorry\" after she \"underestimated\" how much the children, and her youngest son Prince Joachim, would \"feel affected\".\n\nThe decision, she said, was taken as a \"Queen, mother and grandmother\" and was a \"necessary safeguard for the future of the monarchy\".\n\nHer extraordinary statement came after her original decree had been met with anger and shock from Prince Joachim and his family, who all claim to have been surprised by the move.\n\nPrince Joachim said they were all \"very sad\", adding, \"It's never fun to see your children being harmed. They have been put in a situation they do not understand\".\n\nPrincess Marie said their daughter, Athena, has been \"bullied at school\": \"They come and say: 'Is it you who is no longer a princess?' \"\n\nPrince Nikolai said he was \"very confused as to why it has to happen like this\".\n\nREAD MORE: Family 'saddened, in shock' after Danish Queen strips royal titles\n\nHis mother, and Joachim's ex-wife, Countess Alexandra said the family was \"saddened and in shock\", adding the children \"cannot understand why their identity is being taken away\".\n\nBut Crown Princess Mary defended her mother-in-law's decision, saying, \"Change can be difficult and can really hurt\".\n\n\"But this does not mean that the decision is not the right one,\" she said, adding she and Crown Frederik would \"look at our own children's titles when the time comes\".\n\nThe move follows a tough two years for Prince Joachim and his family, who now live in Paris.\n\nJoachim's near-death experience\n\nOn July 24, 2020, Prince Joachim underwent emergency surgery for a blood clot.\n\nThen 51, he was operated on by doctors at the Toulouse University Hospital in southern France, after being diagnosed with a blood clot to his brain.\n\nHe remained in intensive care for nearly a week before he was discharged.\n\nJoachim was on holidays with his wife Princess Marie and their children when he fell ill, staying at the Danish royal family's private residence, Chateau de Cayx near Cahors.\n\nMonths later in November, Joachim spoke about his near-death experience.\n\n\"My health and mood is good, but I must say that it is still something I work with and it will be so for a long time to come,\" Prince Joachim told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, DR.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary's niece, nephews lose royal titles palace shakeup\n\n\"It is not only me and my physical health that were affected. My wife, my children and the immediate family, we have all been affected by it.\n\n\"That is why the family is also a part of this healing, and we thank our Creator for every single day.\"\n\nThe health scare has forced Joachim to put his \"dream job\" on hold indefinitely, a role he had been in preparation for since his childhood.\n\nBut eventually, in September 2021, the royal started his new role as defence attaché at the Danish embassy in Paris delaying it by a few weeks due to his surgery.\n\nOn his first day, Joachim told reporters he felt \"fine\" and was \"eager to get started\".\n\nPrince Joachim's early years\n\nHe grew up with his brother, Crown Prince Frederik inside Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.\n\nLike many Danish royals before him, Prince Joachim went to school at the prestigious Krebs' Skole in Copenhagen, where his two sons Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix later attended.\n\nHe then moved to Normandy, in France, where he spent his teenage years at boarding school.\n\nHis Australian connection\n\nAfter his graduation, Prince Joachim travelled to Australia, where he lived for six months. As a 17-year-old the prince worked on a farm at Wagga Wagga in the New South Wales Riverina.\n\nLiving in Australia changed his outlook on life, he said.\n\nREAD MORE: A look inside one of Europe's oldest monarchies\n\nHe spoke about the experience to Danish students at a Youth Goodwill Conference in 2013.\n\n\"That whole process of jumping out of your protected shell is important, whether it is during your academic studies or collecting work experience, it opens your mind and broadens your horizon, physically and also in spiritual terms,\" Prince Joachim said.\n\n\"You have to let go of a lot of things that you thought were given. You have to adapt to a new environment, and once you return to your home, you will benefit from these experiences.\"\n\nREAD MORE: A look at the fascinating life of Queen Margrethe of Denmark\n\nThe stay made a lasting impact on Prince Joachim, who decided to further his studies in agrarian economics on his return to Denmark, before pursuing a military career.\n\nHis agricultural background saw Prince Joachim work for shipping company Maersk in Hong Kong and France.\n\nHe now owns and runs farming and forestry operations, including his own farm.\n\nHis first marriage\n\nWhile abroad, Prince Joachim met his future wife Alexandra Manley, who was born in Hong Kong. They married in 1995 at Frederikborg Palace Church, near Copenhagen.\n\nJoachim and Alexandra had two sons, Prince Nikolai, 20, and Prince Felix, 18.\n\nBut the marriage was not to last, and they divorced in 2005 – the first in the Danish royal family since 1846.\n\nAlexandra remains close with her ex-husband and is frequently invited to official royal events and private celebrations.\n\nShe was pictured on holidays with their sons, Prince Joachim and his current wife, Princess Marie, in the south of France. The family had been celebrating Prince Felix's 18th birthday days before Joachim was rushed to hospital.\n\nFinding love again\n\nOn May 24, 2008, Prince Joachim married French-born Marie Agathe Odile Cavallier.\n\nThey are believed to have met at a dinner party with friends in Denmark when Joachim was still married to Alexandra, but they didn't start dating until several years later.\n\n\"We met co-incidentally, we found out that we were the only French around, and that's actually how we got talking, and that's how it stayed for many years,\" Prince Joachim explained in an interview with his fiancée, which aired the night before their wedding.\n\n\"You go very often to Paris, and I knew that, so one day I took a chance when I was in Paris and I called Marie and asked if she would be in Paris at the same time as I and, if that would be the case, if I could invite her out.\n\n\"And I supposed that's how those emotions started.\"\n\n\"Paris, it's a romantic city,\" Marie added.\n\nThe wedding took place in the small Danish town of Moegeltoender, in southern Jutland, and was attended by about 300 guests including James Bond actor Sir Roger Moore.\n\nBut the ceremony proved too much for Prince Joachim's youngest son, Prince Felix – aged just five at the time – who fell asleep halfway through.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie went on to have two children, Prince Henrik, 11, and Princess Athena, eight.\n\nPrince Henrik was named after Prince Joachim's French-born father, who passed away in February 2018.\n\nRelationship with Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary\n\nRelations between Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim have long been said to be strained.\n\nThis latest twist has exposed a bigger family issue, Danish royal experts say, with Crown Princess Mary and Princess Marie now drawn into the saga.\n\nPrincess Marie's comments to a Danish magazine about the Queen's decision were seen as \"an attack\" on her sister-in-law.\n\nPrior to Queen Margrethe stripping four of her eight grandchildren of their royal titles, the Crown Prince Couple, and Joachim and Marie, appeared to get on well.\n\nWhen Princess Marie married into the Danish royal family in 2008, many comparisons were made over how much the two women look alike – including similarities with their names – but there are no signs of any tension here.\n\nIn October, 2019, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie joined Prince Frederik and Princess Mary for a dinner at the Paris Town Hall during the Crown Prince couple's tour of France.\n\nThe Danish royals frequently holiday together, too.\n\nTheir destination of choice is Gråsten Palace, in southern Denmark, the official summer residence of the Danish royals.\n\nThey also spend time together at Château de Cayx, near Cahors, in southern France. The estate has been owned by Queen Margrethe since 1974, who bought it because it's close to where Prince Henrik grew up.\n\nThe castle – and its attached vineyard – is now the official French residence of the Danish royals.\n\nIn their early years, and even in the decades since, Prince Joachim was close with his older brother, who will one day succeed their mother to become king of Denmark.\n\nHe is authorised to act as Regent when the Queen and Crown Prince Frederik are abroad, an honour bestowed on Crown Princess Mary .\n\nPrince Joachim's military career\n\nPrince Joachim's military education began in 1987 when he became a recruit in the Queen's Own Regiment.\n\nIn November, 2020, he began a role as a diplomat at the Danish Embassy in Paris following the completion of training at the École Militaire in Paris, France's highest-ranking military course focused on strategic leadership and international relations.\n\nThe course went hand-in-hand with Prince Joachim's current post in the Danish Defence Force, where he has been special advisor to the chief of defence since 2015.\n\nJoachim said living in France felt normal, as he has previously lived there while working for Danish shipping company Maersk.\n\n\"Remember that I am half-French, and here I can cultivate the French side of my personality and blend into the French everyday life whenever I want,\" Joachim said.\n\n\"Similarly, within the four walls of the home we can be Danish, we can be French, we can be Danish-French, we can mix it as crazy as we want.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
