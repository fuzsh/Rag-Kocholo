        "text": "During his career at Michigan, Ron Kramer was a nine-time letterwinner, earning three letters in football, basketball and track. While many fans remember Kramer as one of the all-time great Wolverine football players, it is astonishing to note that Kramer garnered MVP honors for three straight seasons on the hardwood, became the team captain and then set the all-time Michigan scoring mark with 1,124 points. On the football field, Kramer made his name as a hard-nosed, fierce multi-dimensional two-way player. He played offensive and defensive end, running back, quarterback, placekicker and wide receiver -- often in the same game. Kramer's phenomenal abilities were recognized by coaches and media around the country, who named him a consensus All-American in 1955 and 1956. The university retired his number 87 after his senior season. In 1957, Kramer joined the Green Bay Packers, playing tight end under coaching great Vince Lombardi. He was a member of the Packers' 1961 and 1962 world championship teams, earning All-Pro honors both of those years. Kramer finished his pro career with the Detroit Lions from 1964 until 1968. He stayed in the Metro Detroit area working his way to become a Vice President at Paragon Steel. He has also worked as a football color analyst for Michigan football on radio stations WAAM and WWJ. Kramer was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1971, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1974 and the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame in 1978 and received the NCAA's 1981 Silver Anniversary Award. Kramer represents manufacturers in the steel business as the President of Ron Kramer Industries, founded in 1981. He resides in Fenton, Michigan."
