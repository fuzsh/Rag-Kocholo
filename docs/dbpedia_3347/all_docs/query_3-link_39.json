        "text": "In mid-November, Fenton High welcomed new bowling coach Ron Little. Little was hired within the first week of the season starting.\n\n“Hiring a new coach can take up to two-four weeks,” Athletic Director Michael Bakker said. “The full process of posting, interviewing, screening and ultimately hiring a new coach is a long process. In this case, it took about three-four weeks.”\n\nLittle was hired for numerous reasons including his experience, qualifications and personality.\n\n“Little stood out in his interview,” Bakker said. “He stood out as a person who has a genuine love for the sport and someone who wants to share his knowledge with students of all abilities to continue to build our program at FHS.”\n\nLittle started bowling when he was 19 years old and used to work at Cherry Hill Lanes in Clarkston MI. Employees would often come into work early or stay late to bowl, but Little never did. After a while, he decided to give bowling a try and ended up hooked. As far as coaching experience, Little previously coached a local youth league for bowling and was also asked to coach his daughter’s soccer team; however, bowling was the better fit for him.\n\nAfter he decided to coach the Fenton High bowling teams, Little started watching videos and began to plan out practices and games.\n\n“I am still learning how things are done,” Little said. “My goal for this season consists of three things: to have fun, help the team be confident in their abilities and to improve our skills. I think a big key to success is being confident and comfortable. I really want our student-athletes to feel like they did the best they could at the end of the season.”\n\nWith Little being the new coach, this season may be different from previous years as he and the team adjust and changes are made.\n\n“The team is still getting used to him,” senior Bree Soule said. “We are still trying to figure out what’s changing, but I think that we are going to change the way we practice slightly. Coach Ron seems to be very focused on the fundamentals and doing more drills. We’re excited to see what he’s going to provide the team with as we get a different perspective with a new coach. He seems to be settling in well so far and everyone seems to like him. I think he’ll be a great coach for us.”\n\nAlthough Little is still getting used to how things are done, he is excited to be able to share his love of bowling with the team. The team’s next match is at Grand Blanc Lanes on Jan.13 at 6 p.m. against Goodrich."
