        "text": "Hi, and welcome to another edition of Prep Rally. My name is Eric Sondheimer. Football pads come on this week, so let’s take a look at defensive backs and kickers as the summer comes to a close.\n\nTop defensive backs\n\nMater Dei’s secondary was impressive during summer seven on seven competitions, and that came as no surprise, because the Monarchs return cornerbacks Chuck McDonald (Alabama commit) and Daryus Dixson (Penn State).\n\nSierra Canyon has USC commit Madden Riordan and California commit Jae’on Young. Gardena Serra has the duo of sophomore Duvay Williams and senior CJ McBean.\n\nDijon Lee of Mission Viejo is a 6-foot-4 cornerback committed to Alabama. Legend Lyons of Charter Oak is a Minnesota commit. The versatile Dylan Robinson of Bonita is 6-3 and committed to Washington.\n\nRodney Sermons of Rancho Cucamonga and Brandon Lockhart of Loyola are top juniors. Trestin Castro of Upland and Adonyss Currie of Quartz Hill are committed to USC and Texas A&M, respectively. Junior Joshua Holland of St. John Bosco is a USC commit.\n\nBanning safety Steven Perez returns as one of the best in the City Section. Jake Minter of Edison had an impressive summer. Kameryn Hurst of Carson has outstanding speed.\n\nKuron Jabari of Corona Centennial is a UCLA commit. Jayden Gray of Moorpark is a cornerback committed to Air Force.\n\nTop kickers/punters\n\nThere will be no shortage of major contributors in the kicking department this fall.\n\nDylan Freebury of Palos Verdes and Ashton Zamani of Sierra Canyon were standouts in summer camps.\n\nJacob Kreinbring of Loyola is a junior who had two game-winning kicks when he was a freshman at South Pasadena.\n\nNoah LaBerge of Oaks Christian was seven of seven on field goals last season. Kyler Peters of Oak Hills has been booming kicks since he was a freshman at Apple Valley. CJ Wallace takes over at St. John Bosco with high expectations.\n\nMauricio Aguilar of Norco had a 46-yard field goal last season. Andrew Ayon of L.A. Lincoln averaged 39 yards on punts.\n\nSeries begins Aug. 12\n\nA nine-part series previewing top high school football players in Southern California begins Aug. 12 in the Los Angeles Times. Every day for nine straight days there will be a story looking at a top player by position along with a list of 10 players to watch.\n\nThe series begins with a profile of Palos Verdes sophomore quarterback Ryan Rakowski.\n\nHere’s the complete schedule\n\nAug. 12: Quarterback Ryan Rakowski of Palos Verdes\n\nAug. 13: Running back Karson Cox of Oak Hills.\n\nAug. 14: Receiver Shane Rosenthal of Newbury Park\n\nAug. 15: Tight end Mark Bowman of Mater Dei.\n\nAug. 16: Offensive lineman Jake Flores of JSerra\n\nAug. 17: Defensive lineman Khary Wilder of Gardena Serra\n\nAug. 18: Linebacker Samu Moala of Leuzinger\n\nAug. 19: Defensive back Steven Perez of Banning\n\nAug. 20: Kicker Jacob Kreinbring of Loyola.\n\nFootball practice began Monday, and few were as excited as receiver Nathan Santa Cruz of Venice. His life was threatened in 2022 by a head injury suffered in the first game of the season. He’s back again, healthy and ready to go.\n\nHere’s his story.\n\nDefending City champion Birmingham will go with a freshman at quarterback. Here’s the report.\n\nThe Conejo Coast League, featuring Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park, held a media gathering. Here’s a report.\n\nHamilton first-year coach Elijah Asante still doesn’t have all the keys he needs to open locked gates and locked doors, but he’s getting his team organized after not coaching since 2015.\n\nHe’s already identified an outstanding freshman slated to start at left offensive tackle in 6-foot-2, 240-pound Richard Dunn. Dunn, however, won’t be able to play in the Yankees’ season opener against St. Monica on Aug. 23 because he doesn’t turn 14 until the next day. Players under 14 years old aren’t allowed to play. Birmingham had to deal with the same issue when Mason White was a 13-year-old freshman for the Patriots.\n\nLos Angeles has a pair of senior linebackers ready to make an impact. Here’s the report.\n\nJoshua Holland from St. John Bosco became the latest defensive back from the class of 2026 to commit to USC, joining Brandon Lockhart from Loyola and Madden Riordan of Sierra Canyon.\n\nOffensive lineman Nehemiah Johnson from Orange Lutheran has committed to UCLA.\n\nBrian Hildebrand of Rancho Cucamonga has stepped down as football coach after having a health issue.\n\nLoyola has 131 freshmen going out to play football.\n\nSanta Margarita has switched its home games from Saddleback College to Trabuco Hills High.\n\nNotes . . .\n\nFive Southern California products are playing for the USA 18U national baseball team in Panama.
