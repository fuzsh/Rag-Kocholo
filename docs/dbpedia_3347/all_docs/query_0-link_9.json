        "text": "All at Brentford Football Club were saddened to hear of the death of former player and Caretaker Manager Ron Fenton.\n\nRon died yesterday, Wednesday September 25, just days after his 73rd birthday after a battle with cancer.\n\nThe former inside forward played for Burnley, West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City before joining Brentford in 1968.\n\nHe was appointed as captain by Manager Jimmy Sirrel and scored 19 goals in 91 Football League games – 21 in 97 appearances in all competitions.\n\nHe took over as Caretaker Manager when Jimmy Sirrel left to take over as Notts County boss and followed him to Meadow Lane to become Youth Team Coach in 1970, retiring at the age of just 29.\n\nHe was on the coaching staff at Notts County as the rose from Division Four to Division Two and was Manager from 1975 to 1977.\n\nHe was part of Brian Clough’s coaching staff at Nottingham Forest and replaced the legendary Peter Taylor as Assistant Manager.\n\nHe was at Forest during their 1980s heyday when they won the Division One title and two European Cups.\n\nEveryone at Brentford FC passes on their condolences to Ron’s family."
