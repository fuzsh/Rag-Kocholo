        "text": "The post-retirement business dealings of future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady are continuing after the quarterback announced his purchase of an ownership stake in Birmingham City FC.\n\nBrady announced the move in a video on his social media accounts.\n\n“So here’s the deal. I’m officially coming on board at Birmingham City Football Club,” Brady said in the video. “And maybe you’re asking, ‘What do you know about English football, Tom?’ Well let’s just say I’ve got a lot to learn. But I do know a few things about winning, and I think they might translate pretty well. I know success starts with the work put in when the world isn’t watching. I know that a team is nothing without the city that shows up and stands behind it. And most importantly, I like being the underdog,” Brady said as clips from the club played in the background.\n\nAs a minority investor in the club, Brady will also become the chairman of the team’s advisory board, Birmingham FC announced.\n\nBrady's stake in Birmingham City FC is his fifth in the sports world, including minority ownership in the WNBA's Aces and the NFL's Raiders. He's also part of an ownership group for a 2023 Major League Pickleball expansion team and is the team owner of an inaugural '24 team in the E1 World Championship."
