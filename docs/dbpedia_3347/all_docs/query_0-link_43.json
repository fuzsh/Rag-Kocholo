        "text": "Born: 4 June 1949\n\nWest Ham Manager: 1989-1990\n\nLou Macari was appointed in July 1989 but remained in charge of West Ham United for just seven months and 28 matches – the shortest reign of any of the Club’s full-time managers.\n\nThe Scot became the first man to be given the role who had not worked for the Hammers in another capacity prior to his appointment, which came in July 1989.\n\nMacari, who replaced the long-serving and popular John Lyall, played as a striker at the highest level with Celtic, Manchester United and Scotland before embarking on a managerial career with Swindon Town in 1984.\n\nWest Ham had been relegated to Division Two just prior to Macari’s arrival, but it was events elsewhere that ultimately brought a premature end to his tenure in February 1990.\n\nAllegations made by a Sunday newspaper regarding betting and illegal payments made to players at Swindon ultimately led Macari to resign on the morning of West Ham’s Division Two fixture at his former club – with the manager reportedly not wishing to bring bad publicity to his new employers.\n\nWhile Macari’s reign was short and not overly successful – his Hammers reached the League Cup semi-finals but were thrashed 6-0 in the first leg by Oldham Athletic in his final game in charge – his legacy in the transfer market was more impressive.\n\nThe likes of Ludek Miklosko, Trevor Morley, Martin Allen and Ian Bishop all joined the Club during Macari’s reign and went on to enjoy great success in a Claret and Blue shirt.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Boleyn Ground, Macari went on to manage Birmingham City, Stoke City (twice), Celtic and Huddersfield Town before retiring in 2002. He later worked as a broadcaster and pundit."
