        "text": "The Naked City podcast will take a journey into the dark depths of the Australian criminal underworld. In this series you will hear recordings of some of Australia's most dangerous criminals, all of whom have been remarkably frank in their recollections.\n\nAs a young cop Ron Fenton was a star, dux of the Police Academy, the youngest recruit to join Search and Rescue and dux of the sub officers’ course. He could have reasonably expected to become an officer and to retire with a comfortable superannuation package.\n\n“Then I got popped,” he says.\n\nIn 1984, Ron was shot in the head and left unconscious next to his shattered police car. Fellow police couldn’t rescue him as the sniper was active. That is until Sergeant Mick Romeril radioed in declaring: “We’re in a plain car and we might head up to the injured member and put him in the car.”\n\nFenton was not expected to survive but he did and then clawed his way back to work, first as a law instructor and later as an operational officer.\n\nBut it came at a cost – he would suffer PTSD and leave the force to battle his demons alone.\n\nDepression, flash backs, mood swings and vicious night terrors had led him to attempt to take his own life.\n\nThat is, until he met Yogi, a companion dog trained by Benni, an inmate in Bathurst prison.\n\nIn one way, Yogi saved them both. Ron was able to deal with his PTSD and Benni left prison to run a successful, plumbing business.\n\nWhen Ron was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Benni came to Melbourne to see him. Yogi treated his trainer as a long-lost friend and Benni agreed to take the dog home when Ron died.\n\n“It is important that I know Yogi will go to someone who loves him. He is taken care of me and he deserves to have someone to look after him.”\n\nWhen Ron applied to have Yogi’s expenses paid under Workcover, he was knocked back, even though the companion dog saved money as Ron no longer needed drugs to survive."
