        "text": "Birmingham City have released 13 players at the end of the 2022/23 season including captain Troy Deeney.\n\nDeeney, 34, heads a long list of players who are now free agents. Deeney joined Blues two years ago after a decade with Watford and scored 11 times in his 54 Championship outings.\n\nEx-Blues captain Harlee Dean exits St Andrew's after six years with the club. Dean made his 200th Blues appearance in the defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season.\n\nFellow defenders Kevin Long and George Friend are also in line to depart. Long made 17 appearances for Blues after joining on a short-term deal from Burnley in January. Friend, meanwhile, only made six league outings last term and recently told BirminghamLive that he intends to play on next season.\n\nREAD: Inside Birmingham City - The academy ‘USP’ as chief names two areas for Tom Wagner to invest\n\nREAD: Retained lists give Birmingham City options as transfer window date set\n\nMaxime Colin is also on the list. The French full-back is among the club's biggest earners and will need to reduce his salary in order to stay at St Andrew's.\n\nThe final senior player in the departure lounge is Jordan Graham. Blues opted not to take up an option to extend his contract into a third year.\n\nThe club is, however, still negotiating with some of the aforementioned players. \"It must be noted that talks remain ongoing with a number of released players,\" a club statement said.\n\nYoungsters Alfie Brooks, Lewis Cunningham, Adan George, Mitchell Roberts, Keyendrah Simmonds, Ryan Stirk and Remi Walker have all been released. Josh Andrews, Rico Patterson, Callum Sullivan and Josh Williams have been offered professional terms for next season.\n\nBlues have taken up their option to extend Nico Gordon's contract, and options have also been exercised to keep Oliver Basey, Rico Browne, Tate Campbell, Tommy Fogarty, Marcel Oakley and Kieran Wakefield at the club.\n\nDo you agree with the club's decisions? Have your say in the comments section below...\n\nREAD MORE"
