        "text": "In the big book of Brian Clough maxims, you’ll struggle to find many quotes that are self-deprecating. He was, as you’ll know, rather fond of himself, but perhaps his most telling quote came about his relationship with Peter Taylor, his trusted and brilliant deputy with whom he would enjoy his biggest successes. “I’m not equipped to manage successfully without Peter Taylor,” he said. “I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back.”\n\nIf that was true, then it’s perhaps also accurate to say Jimmy Gordon, the trainer who joined Clough when he and Taylor had taken Derby into the First Division in 1969 and remained more or less continuously until he retired in 1982, was the shop walls and ceiling, the sturdy masonry that held the whole thing together. The man described by Clough as “the fair-minded old pro whom I could trust with my life and my wallet if I carried one”.\n\nWhen you look at pictures of Clough during his brief and spectacularly ill-advised move to Leeds, he looks alone, isolated without Taylor, who shrewdly didn’t join him at Elland Road. But he wasn’t totally unaccompanied; in many pictures you’ll see him flanked by a tough-looking military type wearing a tracksuit and a determined expression. Clough called Gordon “the only friend I had” at Leeds, which admittedly was largely his own fault, but it spoke to the bond that had grown between the two men that Gordon was there at all.\n\n“It was out of respect,” says John McGovern, who played under Clough at Hartlepool, Derby, Leeds and Nottingham Forest, when asked why Gordon answered the call to dive headlong into the chaos that was Leeds. “Clough couldn’t walk into Leeds without bringing somebody with him ... he asked Jimmy to be there so he had somebody he could trust.”\n\nAs a player, Gordon stood out as a rather robust wing-half in an era when most wing-halves were already pretty robust, a professional scarer of attackers and ball-winner who made around 400 appearance for Newcastle and Middlesbrough either side of the second world war. While the conflict would rob him of what should have been his peak years, his time in the army perhaps informed his later demeanour.\n\nHis job on the pitch, to paraphrase his future boss, was to get the ball and give it to someone who could play; that someone for much of his career being Boro’s brilliant inside-forward Wilf Mannion. “If you had to play against Jimmy every week you would never sleep at night,” said Bill Shankly of his fellow Scot.\n\nAfter retirement he became a coach at Middlesbrough, which is where he would encounter a pair of young players rarely seen out of each other’s company: the goalkeeper Taylor constantly bending the striker Clough’s ear about all things football. But a fond and career-long relationship wasn’t forged there, as Gordon and Clough more or less constantly argued at Boro, the older man infuriated and frustrated by the forward’s selfishness. “As a coach, I used to pull him apart for getting caught offside and only thinking about scoring goals himself,” Gordon told Tony Francis for his biography of Clough (straightforwardly-titled Clough: A Biography). “But he had an incredible eye for putting the ball in the back of the net.”\n\nIt was therefore perhaps something of a surprise when, after Clough and Taylor took over at Hartlepool, Gordon was one of the first people they called (or, to be more accurate, Clough turned up unannounced at his house with his eldest son Simon in a carry cot), but it was a moment of self-awareness from the mercurial pair, as they knew such a flamboyant duo would need someone a little more sensible to curb their excesses. Gordon was by then a coach at top-flight Blackburn and therefore couldn’t justify dropping down to the Fourth Division, but they weren’t deterred and went back for Gordon after taking Derby into the First Division in 1969.\n\nClough employed a tactic he would later use when trying to sign players: arriving at his house and not leaving until Gordon had agreed to join them, wearing the older man down over five hours. “It was against all my principles to join him. I didn’t like him, neither was I a fan of Peter Taylor,” Gordon said, and admitted the clinching factor wasn’t the Clough charm, but rather a £1,000 interest-free deposit that Derby stumped up for his new house. The pair displayed remarkable persistence to recruit someone who, to the layman, was a fitness trainer, a man to keep things ticking over, but McGovern knew they saw more in Gordon than just that.\n\n“They saw honesty, to start with,” he says. “They saw experience, wisdom, and they knew that if he passed that on to the players it was all going to be good stuff. They knew he would never criticise anyone behind their backs, and if you find someone that honest to work with you, who is going to credit you with all the success and even take some of the pressure off if you weren’t successful, then you can’t go far wrong. It’s about employing people that you trust.”\n\nIndeed, it’s rare to find anyone with a bad word to say about Gordon, although he had a reputation as a hard taskmaster (Frank Clark called him a “real old-style trainer”), whipping Clough’s players into physical shape before the manager could work on their brains. “Everything was spot on,” said former Middlesbrough winger Billy Day, quoted in Jonathan Wilson’s biography of Clough, Nobody Ever Says Thank You. “You could trust him with everything and what he said stood, with international players and everyone.”\n\nAmid Clough and Taylor’s unpredictability, Gordon seemed to be the rock at the heart of everything they did. “He told you everything that he should tell you,” said Brian Phillips, another former charge at Middlesbrough. “If you were a bit slow, or not doing this or that. He watched while you were training and he could see if there was anything wrong with you. He’s one bloke I would never criticise. He was a man.”\n\nGordon was there to pick up the pieces when Clough and Taylor’s bluff of a resignation letter (they didn’t actually want to leave) was called by Derby in 1973, the pair having one disagreement too far with the largely disagreeable chairman Sam Longson. Gordon firstly persuaded the mutinous Derby squad not to go on strike, advising the senior players that it could ruin the careers of some youngsters, then took charge of the game straight after their departure, at which Clough appeared, giving a chairman-baiting wave to the crowd who chanted for his return. Gordon urged the team to “win it for Brian and Peter”, which they duly did, beating Leicester 2-1.\n\nGordon stayed at the Baseball Ground under the new manager Dave Mackay, but his remarkable loyalty was displayed when Clough made one of the most ill-advised moments of his, or anyone else’s, career by taking over from Don Revie. Taylor didn’t go to Leeds, quite possibly on the basis that he knew Clough was making a huge mistake, but Gordon did answer his call – for exactly the same reason.\n\n“Going there was suicidal but I had to do it,” he said years later, and told Mackay after deciding to leave Derby that Clough “could be in trouble and I could help him”. This wasn’t so much an act of prescience as a recognition of the blindingly obvious: Clough was almost inevitably doomed at Elland Road, something that seemingly everyone but he and the Leeds chairman Manny Cussins could see. Gordon thought he could help curb Clough’s excesses but, while it was a noble idea, there was nothing anyone could do and both men were forced out seven weeks later.\n\nGordon went on the dole then took a job at Rolls Royce in Derby after leaving Leeds, but it wouldn’t be long before he received the inevitable call. Clough initially couldn’t talk Taylor into joining him at Nottingham Forest in 1975, but Gordon was more easily persuaded.\n\nClough described Gordon as “the character I needed most at Forest”, and in the early days without Taylor his role was even more important, acting as a buffer between the manager and players – without the poisonous atmosphere that prevailed at Leeds his powers of conciliation were more readily accepted. “Pretty soon they were terrified of him,” Gordon told Francis, after Clough routinely laid into his new charges to the point of bullying. “I warned them that he’d be playing hell with them if they didn’t give two hundred per cent. I acted as the go-between, trying to calm some of their shattered nerves.”\n\nIt was a job he continued to do throughout his time at Forest. When Clough was in one of his “moods” he would usually go after the biggest man in the dressing room, and at the City Ground that was Larry Lloyd, the giant and brutal centre-half who looked more like a slightly-scaled down version of Andre the Giant than a footballer, and whom Clough sought to make an example of at every possible opportunity. “Hey, better be on your best behaviour this morning. He’s on the warpath,” Gordon would say to Lloyd, perfectly exemplifying his calming influence on a player/manager relationship that was already combustible, but could have been toxic.\n\nClough’s success is often put down to his psychological talents – to him knowing what made players tick and therefore how to get the best from them – but Gordon played a big role in that too. McGovern recalls Gordon saying, when the young midfielder was at Derby, that he was “very, very fortunate to be playing with players of this quality, like Dave Mackay, Willie Carlin, Roy McFarland, Kevin Hector, Alan Hinton – he always reminded me how lucky I was, and helped keep my feet on the ground.” Of course, when McGovern was established, and was one of those senior players himself, Gordon revisited the theme: “When we were at Forest, after the Leeds debacle, he actually turned the tables on me and said: ‘These lads are lucky to have you playing here.’ That was an unbelievable compliment, and one you wouldn’t readily forget.”\n\nHe was a constant, a steadying figure that was essential with a manager like Clough. Players would often never know what would be coming from the boss, ready with a compliment one minute and a put-down the next, seemingly at random, but Gordon was consistent: if he praised you, you knew you’d done something to earn it.\n\nAbove all he was there to help the players, whatever that took, as illustrated in a story from Peter Shilton, who was concerned about practising on the hard training pitches in Madrid before the 1980 European Cup final, so instead they trained on a traffic island near the team hotel. Shilton wrote in his autobiography: “Jimmy and I dodged the cars and climbed on to the roundabout. He put down two tracksuit tops as makeshift goalposts and I set to work, against a background of tooting horns from passing cars.”\n\nDespite arguing so much when Clough was a player, they rarely did as coaches. McGovern recalls the only disagreement they would regularly have was about the length of training sessions: Clough would be happy after 15 minutes work, but Gordon would want to keep them running. “They’ll do it on a Saturday,” was Clough’s mantra. Gordon only remembers one occasion when they seriously quarrelled and, as was often the case with Clough, it was about money. Gordon was given a benefit match, against their east Midlands rivals Derby, but Clough told him half of the money would go to the club. “After the game the ticket office manager gave me £4,000 and said £3,000 had gone towards the club,” Gordon told Francis. “It was better than nothing, but I thought it was unforgivable of Brian considering the service I’d put in.” Their relationship deteriorated further after Gordon’s comments in Francis’s book, even though nothing particularly untoward was said, but Clough’s cruel streak was notorious: he infamously said of Taylor, after his former assistant left to take charge of Derby and signed John Robertson behind his back, that “if his car broke down and I saw him thumbing a lift, I wouldn’t pick him up, I’d run him over”.\n\nAs with Taylor, the breakdown of their relationship was a terrible pity, since the pair seemed to be close; Gordon would babysit for Clough’s children (including young Nigel) while at Derby, and when Forest reached the 1980 League Cup final against Wolves, Gordon led the team out. He was even asked to intervene when concerns were raised about Clough’s drinking in the late 1980s, but he thought there was little use. “The boss wouldn’t listen to me,” he said. “That’s the trouble. He won’t take anyone’s advice. He thinks he’s indestructible. I know he likes a drink to help with the pressures of the job, but it’s never interfered with his work that I know and I’ve never seen him drunk.”\n\nGordon retired at the same time as Taylor left, which coincided with a time usually characterised as Forest’s relative wilderness years under Clough in the early and mid-80s, even though this is often overplayed. After all, in the two seasons following the two men leaving, Forest finished fifth and third and were beaten in the Uefa Cup semi-final by an Anderlecht team who were later discovered to have bribed the referee. Still, the European Cup-winning sides, including McGovern, Robertson et al were dismantled too early, as both Clough and Taylor would later admit, but perhaps more importantly for Clough his two lieutenants were gone – Taylor the man who could spot players, Gordon keeping everything moving. In the men such as Ron Fenton, Archie Gemmill and Alan Hill, Clough had a solid set of deputies for his remaining years, but they couldn’t match the perfect blend he had before.\n\nGordon died, after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease for two years, in 1996, and was described by an obituary in the Independent as “a man of unimpeachable integrity”. It’s tough to find anyone who would say otherwise.\n\n“Jimmy Gordon would come into training on a January morning,” says McGovern. “About three degrees below freezing, and he’d have a tracksuit top, pair of shorts, no tracksuit bottoms, and he’d just [take a deep breath] and say: ‘It’s a good to be alive day.’ And then he’d try to run the balls off you. That was Jimmy. He made you appreciate the job you were doing.”"
