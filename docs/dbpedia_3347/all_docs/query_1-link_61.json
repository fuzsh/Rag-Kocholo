        "text": "EFL League One club Birmingham City FC “mooted the idea” of playing a fixture against Wrexham AFC in the U.S. in an “attempt to seize upon growing American interest in the English domestic game,” according to Tom Morgan of the London TELEGRAPH. The club’s American consortium ownership, which includes former NFLer Tom Brady, saw “obvious commercial appeal in facing Hollywood-backed Wrexham.” No official request was made to the EFL, however, after the club was told \"informally\" in recent weeks that “such an idea would be flatly turned down.” Morgan noted U.S.-based dealmakers and administrators have “spoken repeatedly of their hopes of eventually luring a Premier League fixture to America.” However, despite unprecedented viewing numbers in America, both the EPL and the EFL “remain opposed to the idea of either domestic competitions being played overseas.” Sources close to talks maintain that the EFL “never received a formal request and would not have seriously considered the prospect of Birmingham being allowed to play in America.” World Cup organizers in the U.S. last year said that they “would ‘die’” for the opportunity to stage a EPL fixture because the American market is “buying into English football like never before” (London TELEGRAPH, 6/24)."
