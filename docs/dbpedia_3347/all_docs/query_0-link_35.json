The venue was Hamilton Crescent, Partick, Glasgow.\n\nGame 2:England 4-2 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\nThe scorer of the first international goal for England was the Right Honourable William Kenyon-Slaney. He eventually scored twice in the 4-2 win over Scotland, at Kennington Oval on 8 March 1873 thus becoming the first scorer of a brace for England.\n\nGame 3: Scotland 2-1 England\n\nInternational\n\n7 March 1874 - Hamilton Cres, Partick\n\nGame 4: England 2-2 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\nIn England`s fourth international on 6 March 1875, C W Alcock ( Charles William) became the first England captain to score a goal when England drew with Scotland at Kennington Oval. It was Alcock`s one and only cap.\n\nGame 5: Scotland 3-0 England\n\nInternational\n\n4 March 1876 - Hamilton Cres, Partick\n\nGame 6: England 1-3 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\n4 March 1877 - Kennington Oval, London\n\nGame 7: Scotland 7-2 England\n\nInternational\n\n2 March 1878 - First Hampden, Glasgow\n\nGame 8: England 2-1 Wales\n\nInternational\n\nEngland`s first international against Wales took place at Kennington Oval on 18 January 1879.\n\nGame 9: England 5-4 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\n5 April 1879. At 17 years and 252 days, James Prinsep was the youngest England international. It was a record that stood until Wayne Rooney was first capped, in 2003, 124 years later. The match-deciding goal was the first time England benefited from an own-goal when Scotland goalkeeper Robert Parlane helped a Norman Bailey throw-in into his own net and 1879 was the first time England played two internationals in one calendar year.\n\nGame 10: Scotland 5-4 England\n\nInternational\n\n13 March 1880 - First Hampden, Glasgow\n\nGame 11: Wales 2-3 England\n\nInternational\n\n15 March 1880 - Racecourse Ground, Wrexham\n\nGame 12: England 0-1 Wales\n\nInternational\n\n26 February 1881 - Alexandra Meadows, Blackburn\n\nGame 13: England 1-6 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\n12 March 1881 - Kennington Oval, London\n\nGame 14: Ireland 0-13 England\n\nInternational\n\nEngland achieved a record scoreline, one that still stands, when they met Ireland for the first time on 18 February 1882 at Knock Ground, Belfast. The visitors scored 13 times without reply and the game also saw the first hat-trick, two in fact, in an England international. Howard Vaughton scored five times and Arthur `Digger` Brown netted four. Unfortunately, match reports are rare and so it is almost impossible to decide who has the distinction of being England`s first hat-trick hero. Vaughton scored in the third minute but times of the goals do not exist beyond, ironically, the 13th minute.\n\nGame 15: Scotland 5-1 England\n\nInternational\n\n11 March 1882 - First Hampden, Glasgow\n\nGame 16: Wales 5-3 England\n\nInternational\n\n13 March 1882 - Racecourse Ground, Wrexham\n\nGame 17: England 5-0 Wales\n\nInternational\n\n3 February 1883 - Kennington Oval, London\n\nGame 18: England 7-0 Ireland\n\nInternational\n\n24 February 1883 - Aigburth CC, Liverpool\n\nGame 19: England 2-3 Scotland\n\nInternational\n\n10 March 1883 - Bramall Lane, Sheffield\n\nGame 20: Ireland 1-8 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\nIn 1884, the Home International Championship was staged for the first time. England were the first champions beating Ireland 8-1, in Belfast on 23 February 1884\n\nGame 21: Scotland 1-0 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n15 March 1884 - First Cathkin, Glasgow\n\nGame 22: Wales 0-4 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n17 March 1884 - Racecourse Ground, Wrexham\n\nGame 23: England 4-0 Ireland\n\nHome International Championship\n\n28 February 1885 - Whalley Range, Manchester\n\nGame 24: England 1-1 Wales\n\nHome International Championship\n\nAfter 13 years and 23 games, England played out their first 1-1 draw when Wales were the visitors to Leamington Road, Blackburn on 14 March 1885.\n\nGame 25: England 1-1 Scotland\n\nHome International Championship\n\n21 March 1885 - England hosted Scotland at Kennington Oval and history was made by James Forrest, the Blackburn half-back, as the first professional footballer to play for England. Scotland protested, regarding his status, and so Forrest had to play in a different jersey to the rest of the England players, to differentiate from them, amateurs all. At his club Forrest earned £1 a week. He got £1 playing for England so Blackburn didn`t pay him that week.\n\nGame 26: Ireland 1-6 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n13 March 1886 - Ballynafeigh Park, Belfast\n\nGame 27: Scotland 1-1 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n27 March 1886 - Second Hampden, Glasgow\n\nGame 28: Wales 1-3 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n29 March 1886 - Racecourse Ground, Wrexham\n\nGame 29: England 7-0 Ireland\n\nHome International Championship\n\n5 February 1887 - Bramall Lane, Sheffield\n\nGame 30: England 4-0 Wales\n\nHome International Championship\n\n26 February 1887 - Kennington Oval, London\n\nGame 31: England 2-3 Scotland\n\nHome International Championship\n\n19 March 1887 - Leamington Road, Blackburn\n\nGame 32: England 5-1 Wales\n\nHome International Championship\n\nOn 4 February 1888, England beat Wales 5-1 at Nantwich Road, Crewe. George Woodhall scored England`s third goal. It was the 100th England international goal and took just 16 years and less than 32 games.\n\nGame 33: Scotland 0-5 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\n17 March 1888 - Hampden Park, Glasgow\n\nGame 34: Ireland 1-5 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\nTinsley Lindley set a new record for scoring in consecutive internationals. On 7 April 1888 he scored in the 5-1 win over Ireland at Ballynafeigh Park in Belfast, his sixth consecutive scoring game for England.\n\nGame 35: England 4-1 Wales\n\nHome International Championship\n\n23 February 1889 - Victoria Ground, Stoke\n\nGame 36: England 6-1 Ireland\n\nHome International Championship\n\nWhen England beat Ireland 6-1 at Anfield Road, Liverpool on 2 March 1889 skipper John Brodie, making his debut and captaining the side, scored his only international goal.\n\nGame 37: England 2-3 Scotland\n\nHome International Championship\n\n13 April 1889 - Kennington Oval, London\n\nGames 38 and 39: Wales 1-3 England & Ireland 1-9 England\n\nHome International Championship\n\nHistory was made in 1890 when England fielded two separate teams on the same day.
