        "text": "While promoting his home state’s troubled racing product, a prominent horse owner warned industry leaders Thursday that California has reached a fork in the road where it could be in danger of splitting its “brand to one mediocre and one bush-league circuit.”\n\nGary Fenton, who chairs the Thoroughbred Owners of California, spoke from Del Mar to The Jockey Club’s annual round table in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on matters pertaining to racing.\n\nAn entertainment lawyer by trade who has run Little Red Feather Racing for nearly 20 years, Fenton said “it isn’t always rosy out here” in California. The state witnessed The Stronach Group’s closing of Golden Gate Fields two months ago amid questions about the future of Northern California racing.\n\nFenton paid lip service to the ongoing debate about whether California should maintain separate colonies to the north and south or, instead, have one big circuit.\n\n“Transitioning from an all-weather and turf surface (at Golden Gate) to dirt only will be challenging for the north,” Fenton said, referring to a California Association of Racing Fairs plan to run a fall meet at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton.\n\n“The California Horse Racing Board agreed to the opportunity,” Fenton said. “This prevented the shifting of most of the $25 million (in annual purse money) in the north to the south region. But thanks again to the California leadership, this opportunity is not without guard rails. Objective benchmarks have been approved. The north must achieve viable numbers that support all of California. There is no doubt we want two circuits exported to the rest of the country. Two viable circuits generate the most revenue.”\n\nThat was when Fenton warned that failure to keep both circuits at a high level would result in a “mediocre” south and a “bush-league” north.\n\nFenton extolled the most tangible virtues of California racing, including its settings, weather, tradition and star power from stables to studios. He also followed the money.\n\n“Economically, California is a major engine in the U.S. ecosystem,” he said. “Nearly 25 percent of all U.S. handle is derived from California horse players or bet on California product. Up to 20 percent of the Keeneland yearling sales is derived from California buyers, and equally, we carry a big stick with Fasig-Tipton.”\n\nIn nearly the same breath, Fenton pointed out that is California is a long way from the next nearest state running races at the same level year-round.\n\n“Out here we maintain a 3,500 (racehorse) population,” Fenton said, “and we do it on our own island. And with just income derived from wagering. California receives no ancillary subsidy from (historic horse-racing machines) or slots, and we divide that income in two. Whatever is bet in the north stays in the north, which up until (June) consisted of Golden Gate Fields and the CARF summer circuit. This amounts to $25 million in purses. The south generates about $85 million in purses.”\n\nPunctuating that point, Fenton said, “We are all connected.”\n\nHe underscored how the state came together five years ago, when Santa Anita was in the midst of a 12-month period when 37 racehorses died in races or in training.\n\n“What I’m most proud of was the response of the leaders, stakeholders and our horsemen and women after 2019,” Fenton said. After praising veterinarian Dionne Benson and The Stronach Group for their leadership during the crisis, he said, “The California response to the 2019 incidents at Santa Anita created more effective safety reforms than any other stretch in American horse-racing history. ... Here we are five years later with historic declines in fatalities. It has never been safer to race in California, and we did it with dirt tracks.”\n\nAs so many of California’s racing community has said for years, there is an immediate need for more revenue such as slots, HHR, sports betting that remains illegal there or even a share of fantasy-sports revenue, which has been proposed this year.\n\n“California is actively seeking ancillary revenue streams within and outside our state to increase purses and lead to the economic growth for both California and the rest of the country,” Fenton said. “It is priority no. 1.”\n\nSaying, though, it is not all or nothing, Fenton added the challenge of making the public more aware of horse racing and its attractiveness as a recreational activity let alone a place to gamble. He channels his entertainment background for an example.\n\n“I’m reminded of something the great actor Ted Danson once said when his biggest show ‘Cheers’ ended,” Fenton said. “He felt years later his relevancy had waned. He said everyone used to recognize him, but now kids said things like, ‘You’re my dad’s favorite actor.’ Then it became, ‘You’re my grandfather’s favorite actor.’ He was forced to reinvent himself with roles that opened his world to new audiences.\n\n“Like ‘Cheers,’ we were once at the top of the sports world. And like Ted Danson I now get stories from newbies telling me how their parent or grandparent used to love going to the races. With the safety reforms in place, this is a pivotal moment for us to reinvent ourselves in the eyes of so many Americans who have never been to the racetrack. Only heard stories from a parent or a grandparent. If there is a call to action today regarding California, it isn’t to just send us money or horses. It’s far deeper and more nuanced.”"
