        "text": "Born: 7 November 1914\n\nDied: 12 July 1992\n\nWest Ham Manager: 1950-1961\n\nTed Fenton became West Ham United’s third manager in the summer of 1950.\n\nA wing-half for the Hammers between 1932 and 1946, Fenton had previously enjoyed a prolific schoolboy career with West Ham and England.\n\nFenton played regularly in the Second Division in the seasons leading up to the outbreak of the Second World War, when he joined the Army and served as a physical training instructor in North Africa and Burma.\n\nIn all, Fenton had played 179 senior competitive matches and 204 War-time fixtures for the Hammers – the last of which came at Arsenal in May 1946.\n\nOn hanging up his boots, Fenton left the Boleyn Ground to become player/manager at Colchester United in 1946, before returning to assist Charlie Paynter two years later.\n\nIn the summer of 1950, Fenton was appointed manager and set about building what has since become known the world over as ‘The Academy of Football’ – the scouting and development of outstanding players.\n\nWorking with his captain Malcolm Allison, Fenton instilled new tactics and philosophies on and off the pitch, resulting in an attractive ‘West Ham Way’ of both living and playing the game of football.\n\nContinental ideas were introduced, with new training methods taking inspiration from other clubs and the famous Hungarian national team of the period.\n\nUnder Fenton’s watch, the Club unearthed and produced some of its finest-ever players, most notably future England stars Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst. Seven of the side who won the FA Cup in 1964 had either been developed or signed by Fenton.\n\nWest Ham won the Division Two title in 1957/58, returning to the top flight after a 26-year absence, before achieving an outstanding sixth-place finish in Division One the following season.\n\nFenton was sacked in March 1961 after taking charge of 468 first-team matches over eleven years, winning 183, losing 173 and drawing 102.\n\nThe long-time Hammer took charge at Southend United, where he spent four seasons before departing in 1965.\n\nIn retirement, Fenton opened a popular sports shot in Brentwood, Essex, which is still trading today.\n\nHe passed away in July 1992, shortly after being seriously injured in a car accident in Leicestershire.\n\nHonours Football League Division Two (1957/58)"
