        "text": "FOXBORO – The first five years of his NFL career were spent with the Buffalo Bills where media attention was hardly overwhelming.\n\nThen, in 2017, cornerback Stephon Gilmore signed a five-year, $65 million contract with the Patriots, who are constantly in the media spotlight.\n\n“Yeah, it was a tough adjustment,’’ Gilmore said at a press conference last week. “Just from where I came from, there were probably like five media people in the locker room, maybe six, seven.\n\n“Then I come here and it’s like 20. So it was a big adjustment, but it’s good. Everybody wants to know what we’re doing and have much respect for our team because of the hard work we put in each and every year. It was a big adjustment, but I think now I’m used to it.’’\n\nThe 29-year-old Gilmore has adjusted very well to the scrutiny, and his cooperation with the media earned him some recognition this season.\n\nOn Thursday, Gilmore received the fourth annual Ron Hobson Good Guy Media Award for being the “most helpful, available and accommodating’’ Patriots player this season.\n\nThe award is named in honor of former Patriot Ledger sports writer Ron Hobson, who covered the Patriots from 1961 until his retirement in January 2010. Hobson, a.k.a. The Humble One, covered the Patriots from Day One. He quickly became a reader favorite, picking NFL winners in his weekly column for more than three decades while challenging Ledger readers to try to outdo him.\n\nPrevious winners of the Hobson award include Matthew Slater in 2016, Devin McCourty in 2017 and James White last season.\n\nGilmore is among the leading contenders for the defensive player of the year award, which has gone the past two seasons to Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe University of South Carolina product intercepted a career-high six passes and returned two for touchdowns for the Patriots while tying a career-high with 20 passes defended.\n\nGilmore and the Patriots opened the playoffs Saturday night by hosting the Tennessee Titans in the wild-card round.\n\n“I try to be a good guy,’’ said Gilmore while accepting the media award. “No matter what, win or loss, I try to be respectful and give the most accurate information I can. That’s just the way I was raised. That’s the way I am as a player, on and off the field.’’\n\nGilmore was answering a lot of questions last week after he was victimized time and again by DeVante Parker of the Miami Dolphins in the regular-season finale.\n\nHe made eight catches for 137 yards in an upset win that moved the Patriots out of a bye and into the wild-card round for the first time in a decade.\n\n“It’s a new week and I know the things I have to do in order for us to win,’’ said Gilmore. “I’ll take full responsibility for everything that I do and I know what I have to do to help my team, so I’m always hard on myself no matter what.\n\n“Good or bad, I put it behind me and get ready for the next play or the next game.’’\n\nOn Friday, Gilmore was named as a unanimous selection on The Associated Press’ All-Pro team, the second year in a row he made the first team.\n\nSlater was chosen as a special teamer for the fifth time in his career while offensive lineman Joe Thuney made the second team.\n\nJim Fenton may be reached at jfenton@enterprisenews.com.
