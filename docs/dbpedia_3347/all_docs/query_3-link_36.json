        "text": "Ron Ertle is Headed to the Football Hall of…\n\nRon Ertle is Headed to the Football Hall of Fame\n\nThe Massillon Tiger Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2023 will be inducted this August during the Massillon Football Booster Club’s Reverse Raffle event. Included this year is new member Ron Ertle, who played linebacker for the Tigers in 1965-67. During the event he will receive a distinctive plaque commemorating his achievements. A second plaque will be mounted in the WHS sports hall in the space reserved for past Hall of Fame inductees. In addition, Ertle will be recognized on the field prior to the opening football game against Valdosta, Georgia.\n\n“Ruby” Ertle played both linebacker and lineman under Head Coach Bob Seaman. As a starter during his junior year he instantly became a force on defense, giving a hundred percent on every play. One could describe him as just a “really tough player.” Against Canton McKinley he had a pass interception to quell a drive, and also during the season recovered two fumbles. Unfortunately, the Tigers’ record that year was 4-5-1.\n\nIn his 1967 senior year Ertle was named a team co-captain along with Trevor Young and was once again a dominating force on the field. That led to a much more successful campaign than the previous year, with the team finishing 9-1 and earning 2nd place in the Associated Press state sportswriters poll. Massillon’s only loss that year came at the hand of the eventual No. 1 team, Upper Arlington, by the score of 7-6. But the Tigers did defeat both McKinley 20-15 and undefeated Steubenville 26-16 on the way to a 4-0 mark in the All-American Conference.\n\nErtle finished the year as the leading tackler. He also scored four extra points from his tight end position. After that the awards flowed in. First, he received the Touchdown Club’s Hardnose Award, well-representing the attributes associated with this Bob Commings accolade, the Reese’s Raiders “E” Award for effort, efficiency and endeavor, and was named Massillon’s Most Valuable Player. After that came Massillon Independent All-County linebacker and WHBC Player of the Year. All of that culminated in him being named 1st Team All-Ohio linebacker and Ohio Football News Magazine All-Ohio linebacker. The following summer he participated in the Ohio North-South All-Star Game.\n\nCongratulations to Ron Ertle.\n\n1967: Massillon 20, Canton McKinley 15\n\nOne Play Away From Perfect Year\n\nBy CHUCK HESS, JR.\n\n“Only one play away from an undefeated season.”\n\nAs one looks back today on the 10 games which the Washington high grid team played this year and also contemplates the final Associated Press poll due Tuesday, Tiger Coach Bob Seaman’s words sum it up pretty well.\n\n* * *\n\nEVEN WITH the Tigers’ 20-15 victory over Canton McKinley at rain-pelted Fawcett stadium last Saturday afternoon before a full house of 20,500 to write a 9-1 finish to the 1967 season, it’s not likely to be enough to bring the Bengals a state championship.\n\nUndefeated Upper Arlington (10-0) will probably be the King-pin come Tuesday as the result of that fourth and 7 counter play recalled by Seaman after the victory over McKinley. It was that strategy which led to Arlington’s 7-6 win over the Tigers.\n\nBut “Operation Comeback ‘67” can still be rated a success in the minds of the fans of the Orange and Black. For their team has bounced back from a 4-5-1 season to probably second place in the state and the championship of the All-American Football Conference.\n\nThe last win came every way but easy. The Tigers shot out to a 12-0 first period lead but barely got out of the game alive against an outstanding Bulldog eleven coached by Ron Chismar. Only a last-minute pass interception by junior Halfback Bert Dampier staved off disaster.\n\nThe Pups had the ball on the Massillon 14-yard line, third and 7 after a 51-yard pass-run play from Quarterback Ted Bowersox, who had previously scored twice, to Wingback Gerald Davidson. His 33-yard run after the catch found him going out of bounds on the 17. Bowersox tried to hit Davidson again in the end zone but Dampier came down with the pigskin for a touchback and Massillon ran out the clock.\n\n* * *\n\nIT WAS THE Bengals defense which did the job as the offense never really got going after the first quarter. One drive in the second quarter got as far as the McKinley 35 but Bowersox intercepted a pass on the 30 to stop the threat.\n\nThe Tigers had the ball for 6 series in the second half, not counting the final one when they ran the clock out. The WHS eleven got only one first down and that was via a personal foul penalty.\n\nThe Bulldogs outstanding job of pursuing led by Middle Guard Gaylord Sweat, effectively throttled the Seaman-men. Seaman said McKinley did a “good job of getting to the ball.” Chismar said his charges did a “great job. It’s a shame they couldn’t have won.”\n\nThe Tigers were paced by a superlative defensive secondary, which allowed the Bulldogs to complete only 6 of 24 passes. Dampier, besides his game saving interception, also aborted a McKinley drive with an interception on his 15 in the third period.\n\nManson was in the game due to a first quarter ankle injury suffered by Co-Captain and Quarterback Trevor Young. Junior Marc Malinowski was forced to vacate his safety spot to do the signal calling and showed promise for next year. However, Young’s absence affected the offensive timing.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BENGALS’ other co-captain, Linebacker Ron Ertle, was all over the field again. Both ends, Tim Richards, and Russ Fenton, did a good job of containing Bowersox.\n\nLinebacker Hoyt Skelton recovered a fumble on the Bulldog 38 in the third quarter. But the Tigers couldn’t move the ball.\n\nShortly thereafter, Tom Houser downed a Malinowski punt on the 3 to put McKinley into a\n\ndeep hole. On the third down in the ensuing series, Bowersox faded to the end zone from the 5, and hit End Jim Iams in the flat. But “Monster” Larry Shumar, weighing only 152 pounds, decked the 175-pound end for a safety, one of several nifty plays by the diminutive junior during the afternoon.\n\nJunior Tailback Jim Smith led the offense by scoring one of the first period touchdowns and collecting 99 net yards in 18 tries for a season’s total of 1,011. Art Hastings’ 1,274 in 1969 marked the last time a Tiger had over 1,000 yards.\n\nMalinowski got the other welcome frame tally.\n\nBut the most spectacular score was Mark McDew’s 90-yard runback of the second half kickoff for the Tigers’ third touchdown behind some fine blocking. Only 10 seconds ticked off the clock. Smith missed on the conversion run.\n\n* * *\n\nSMITH’S SCORE came over left guard on first down from the one with 6:05 left in the first quarter. The 75-yard drive took only 5 plays. Smith set up his own score with a\n\n54-yard blast through the center which put the ball on the one. McKinley Co-Captain Ron Martin made the tackle.\n\nThen came the conversion keeper on which Young got hurt.\n\nMcKinley fumbled on its 40 while driving after the kickoff McDew recovered and the Orange and Black had its second TD 6 plays later with 2:40 left. Malinowski ran off left tackle on a keeper on third and 4 from the 10 after bobbling the ball and crossed into pay dirt. Twelve and 14-yard runs by Malinowski and Smith had set up the score.\n\nA pass fell incomplete on the conversion try.\n\nJunior Tackle Jon Brandyberry recovered a fumble on the Tiger 44 and 11 plays later the Pups were on the scoreboard with 4:35 remaining in the second quarter. An 8-yard run by Bowersox, a 10-yarder by Martin and 6 and 9-yard passes for Bowersox to Davidson and Iams set up the 6-pointer, the latter coming on fourth down from the 14 and giving the Bulldogs a first down on the Bengal 5.\n\nBowersox scored through the center on third down from the one and then kicked the conversion. On the Tigers’ first try after the kickoff, Bowersox recorded his interception on the McKinley 30 to stop a drive highlighted by sophomore Darnell Streeter’s 23-yard kick return and Smith’s 18-yard romp off right tackle.\n\nMcKinley’s other score came with 4:45 left in the game. The Bulldogs drove 78-yards following a Tiger punt in the dying seconds of the third quarter. The push took 17 plays.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BIG maneuvers were a 21-yard pass-run combination from Bowersox to Davidson’s 4-yarder which netted a first down on the one by a gnat’s eyelash.\n\nBowersox scored on the next play through the center and passed to Davidson to make it 20-15.\n\nMASSILLON – 20\n\nEnds – Dampier, Houser, Richards, Twiggs.\n\nTackles – Snowball, Ricker, Laase, Snyder.\n\nGuards – D.

He put forth the strongest side of his twany, battle worn hide at monsoon like Harding stadium in Steubenville.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE WASHINGTON high gridiron aggregation rode into the “Valley of Death,” marches on through it and right out the other side with a hard-fought 26-16 victory over the state’s previously top-ranked and undefeated Big Red, apparently stifling the River City’s title hopes 2 years in a row.\n\nThe estimated standing room only crowd of 13,000 got the word that the Tigers believe they still have a right to the Buckeye throne even though showing an 8-1 record. The Stubbers, likewise 8-1, also hung out the message ensigns in a formation which read, “We still deserve second spot.”\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BIG HERO had to be junior Tailback Jim Smith. The “Tiger Turbine” was at his best power wise, unstoppable outside, off tackle, up the middle and probably anywhere else Quarterback Trevor Young had directed him to go. He scored all 4 of his team’s touchdowns – may have had a fifth but slipped on the wet turf – and gained 184 yards in 39 carries for a 4.7 average.\n\nSmitty’s effort got him a new team number for number of carries. The late Bob Glass had the previous mark at 31 when Massillon beat Steubenville 13-0 in 1937.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE WIN ALSO put the Tigers into first place in the All-American Football conference with a 3-0 mark. The Big Red, the strongest and most versatile team Massillon has played to date, dropped to second at 2-1. They do not play Niles.\n\nAnother thing which the contest served to point out is what sound, conservative football will do for you – like hatching valuable time, which the opposition would like to use, off the clock, thereby limiting the foe’s potential scoring opportunities.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE GAME also served to show that when the Tigers are at full strength offensively – which they weren’t when Upper Arlington handed them their only defeat – that Bob Seaman’s crew is hard to beat.\n\nTight End Tom Houser and Fullback Reggie Moore, both seniors and both out with injuries since the Altoona game 3 weeks ago, were back at their bruising best. Houser hacked away at defenders on his end of the line. Moore mangled them out of Smith’s path off tackle and added some timely running. Neither he nor Smith suffered any losses.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BENGAL Landers stepped out to a 14-0 lead at the beginning of the second period but the tough Stubbers were in front 16-14 at halftime. The toast of Tigertown roared in front again to stay with 12 points in the goodbye canto.\n\nThree of the 4 TDs by the Tigers came on long drives, the last after a fumble recovery close in. The Tigers moved 69 yards on 14 plays after the opening kickoff for a tally with 4:38 remaining in the first quarter.\n\n* * *\n\nSMITH SCORED over left tackle on third down from the one-yard line after charging\n\n20 yards around end on third down to the Steubenville 30 minutes earlier to keep the drive going. He might have also scored the conversion on a pitchout but slipped on the muddy turf and fell short of his target.\n\nA 10-play, 51-yard drive after Russ Fenton’s 19-yard runback of the Stubbers’ next punt put Tiger fans into ecstasy again and took the game into the second period. As in the first drive, Smith picked up most of the yardage and tallied on second down from the one-foot line off right tackle with 11:12 left in the half. Young helped with a beautiful 33-yard scamper around end to the 3.\n\nYoung’s pass to Ertle made it 14-0.\n\n* * *\n\nSTEUBENVILLE took over a Massillon punt on the Tigers’ 49 midway to the second period. Six plays later junior Fullback Bob Sims, a great runner even though hobbled by a leg injury, slipped off right tackle on first down from the 25 and got the Big Red’s first 6 points with the clock showing 6:49 left.\n\nHalfback Keith Burke got a lateral from Quarterback Dave Corsi and hit End Jim Smith for the conversion.\n\nSims, who picked up 65 yards on 10 carries without a loss during the night, scored the other Big Red TD. After Burke had recovered Young’s fumble on the Massillon 39, the Stubbers got their deadly passing game into high gear and scored after 10 plays.\n\n* * *\n\nCORSI BEGAN hitting flanker Don Osby, connecting for 4, 14 and 16 yards. The crucial sky counter was a 4-yard fourth down pass from the 5 to Burke for a first down on the one. Smith scored over left tackle on the next play 27 seconds left in the half.\n\nCorsi threw Bob Young for the conversion. Young making the catch on the one and going on in to put the Stubbers in the lead.\n\nIt began to look like the Big Red’s passing warfare might be too much for the Tigers, but secondarymen Mark McDew, Bert Dampier and Marc Malinowski, all juniors, were equal to the task in the second half.\n\n* * *\n\nANOTHER JUNIOR, Larry Shumar, starting at “monster” back for the first time as senior Bill Simon was lost to the team for the remainder of the season with fractured neck vertebra put a lot of pressure on to dent the Big Red’s running hopes. Simon’s injury showed up in X-rays taken Friday after he had complained of neck pain all week.\n\nSteubenville failed to get past the Massillon 46 in the second half as the Tigers put on a great defensive show to go with their offensive masterpiece.\n\n* * *\n\nTAKING OVER ON their 21 after a Steubenville punt near the end of the third quarter, the Obies opened up their ground attack still more by utilizing Wingback McDew on short, sliding pass pattern to the right, the first time the locals attempted to pass during the night.\n\nEleven plays later Smith had his third score with 10:41 left in the last quarter. Big plays were on Young-to-McDew connections on the aforementioned slides – 32 yards to the Big Red 48 and 16 yards to the Stubber 28, both setting up first downs on third down strategy.\n\nSmith scored through the middle on first down from the 3. Burke knocked down a conversion aerial headed for McDew.\n\n* * *\n\nDAMPIER INTERCEPTED a pass intended for Burke on the Steubenville 47 with 3:04 left in the game. Massillon was unable to get the first down, Malinowski’s punt traveled only about 20 yards but Steubenville was offside, giving Malinowski another try.\n\nBurke muffed the catch attempt on his 15, senior Tackle Bill Ricker, replacing the injured Ernie McGeorge, hopped on the ball and the Tigers continued in business. Three plays and 2 penalties later, Smith went off tackle from the 3 for the clincher with 30 seconds remaining in the contest.\n\nCorsi grounded Young’s conversion pass to Ertle.\n\nMASSILLON – 26\n\nEnds – Houser, Dampier, Richards, Ertle, Twiggs.\n\nTackles – Snowball, Ricker, Laase, M.

Harding Friday night before 11,051 paid customers at Tiger stadium.\n\nThe out manned Panthers gave the Tigers all they wanted in the scoreless first half, but Bengal Coach Bob Seaman gave Young the “automatic sign” and the Tigers ran wild in the second half.\n\nYoung was something else. He scored 2 touchdowns on runs of 21 and one yards and heaved a 21-yard pass to Wingback Mark McDew for the other Tiger score.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE WIN RAISES the Obies’ All-American Football conference record to 2-0 and 7-1 overall. It also sets the stage for Friday night’s invasion of 8-0 Steubenville, ranked No. 1 this past week in the Associated Press poll. Warren is 3-5 overall and 0-3 in AAFC play. Steubenville also is 2-0 in the league. The Big Red defeated Weirton, W. Va., 32-19 Friday evening.\n\nThe game was mostly defense by both teams in the first half. Warren was stopped on the Massillon 5-yard line in the first period and again on the Tiger 21 in the second quarter. Poor field position put unwanted pressure on the Tigers’ offense during most of the first half, although the Orange and Black did manage to sputter to the Warren 14 behind rollouts by Young and off tackle and pitch out plays by Smith.\n\nTwo plays after the Black Panthers received the second half kickoff, Warren’s Greg Williams tried to pitchout to Fullback Robert Stewart. The ball missed its target and Tiger Greg Manson recovered at the Warren 25-yard line.\n\nThat’s the play that broke our back,” Warren Coach Bill Shunkwiler said after the game outside the Panther locker room.\n\nSmith blasted through left tackle for 4-yards and on the next play, Young rolled left and followed the downfield blocking of Blaine Moore, Bill Snowball and Dave Gipp.\n\n* * *\n\nTREVOR, who stands 5-8 and weights 165-pounds, shook off Warren’s Chuck O’Donnell at the 9 and went untouched the rest of the way. Young then rolled to his right for the PAT and an 8-0 lead at 10:53.\n\nLinebacker Ron Ertle put the pressure on Warren’s punter, Andrew Tenekedes, late in the third period. It resulted in a busted play as Bengal junior Richard Laase pounced on Tenekedes at the Warren 35.\n\nYoung rolled for 11 yards, Smith added 7 on 2 carries, Darrell Streeter sliced for 8 more and Smith again picked up 15 yards on 2 plays to move the ball to the Warren 5.\n\nStreeter hit the right side on a quick opener to the 1 and Young sneaked through left guard for his second TD at 11:23 in the fourth period.\n\nYoung rolled and passed to Tight-End Ertle, who ran a pattern to the deep right corner of the end zone, for the 2-point conversion and a 16-0 lead.\n\n* * *\n\nWARREN then gained a first down before the Bengal defense again forced the Panthers to punt. The Obies took over on their own 15 and traveled 85 yards in 12 plays for their final TD.\n\nOn second and 19 at the Warren 29 and after a 5-yard penalty for taking too much time, Young dropped back and hit McDew over the middle at the 9-yard line. The junior wingback shook off 2 Warren defensive backs and cut to his right for the final TD at 2:52. Streeter’s run for the extra points failed.\n\nSmith totaled 136 yards rushing for the night, and Young 79. Gerald Wesley, the AAFC rushing leader, was held to 54-yards. Smith now has gained 732 for the season and Wesley 705.\n\nMASSILLON – 22\n\nEnds – Ertle, Robinson, Dampier, Richards.\n\nTackles – McGeorge, Ricker, Laase, Snowball.\n\nGuards – Whitfield, Doll, D.

Those who would seek to criticize Coach Bob Seaman for daring to suggest the Obies should have a “breather” now and then found out what happens when you don’t have one.\n\nPlaying without two-thirds of their power blocking because of injuries last week to Reggie Moore, 200-pound fullback, and Tom Houser, 224-pound tight end and sometimes front man in the I, the Bengals were clawless. The absence of 220-pound senior Linebacker Hoyt Skelton didn’t help matters either as Upper Arlington edged the Orange and Black 7-6 before the season’s biggest crowd, 19,017, on Homecoming night.\n\n* * *\n\nIN BEATING Massillon, the Bears ended a 6-game winning streak and extended their skein to 7. Tiger chances for a state title have dimmed but the lights haven’t been turned out yet.\n\nTo make the situation even worse, Friday Tom Robinson, 174-pound junior who practiced all week as Houser’s replacement, injured a knee in practice Thursday night. Mike Snyder, 192-pound senior, was switched from strong tackle at the last minute to fill in for Robbie and did the best he could under the circumstances.\n\nHad the Obiemen had a “breather” Friday night instead of a continuation of their killer slate, those on the injury list would have had a week to recuperate.\n\nCo-Captain Trevor Young, near tears after the game said, “We let the fans down.” But the Tigers didn’t let anybody down. They had about as much chance of winning as an\n\n8-cylinder car has of moving with the wires off 5 of its spark plugs.\n\nExcept for the beginning of the game when the Bengals moved well outside, they couldn’t get any kind of continuity of attack going. Without Moore, to work inside, junior tailback Jim Smith couldn’t move at all on the outside, averaging his lowest rushing figure of the season, 2.9 yards.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BENGALS got out of their own territory only twice all night – in the first and second quarters. The last half was played mainly in the shadow of the Obies’ goal post, as Massillon got only 2 first downs.\n\n“Did the injuries hurt us?” Seaman asked and then just as quickly answered. “I guess they did! They stopped our offense purely and simply. We missed Houser. When he double teams down, he double teams down!”\n\n“There are not many teams who can lose 3 first stringers, one a 2-wayer (Houser) and have subs fill in and do the job they did tonight. I’m not pleased, of course, but I’m proud of our boys.”\n\nHouser was in for only 4 plays while Moore did some kicking off. Skelton saw very limited action.\n\nIn an obvious reference to Arlington’s schedule, Seaman said, “I wish I had to get ready for only one game a year instead of 10. We play too darn many tough ones.”\n\n* * *\n\nWITH JUNIOR fullback Geoff Schmidt, showing the way as he did last year, with 108 net yards in 31 tries, for a 3.5 average, the Bears beat the Tigers at their own game – control football. The Bruins ran 83 plays to the Obies’ 51. Without their power attack, the Orange and Black couldn’t hang on for any length of time.\n\nMarv Moorehead, who has seen his charges win here 2 years in a row, watched the Bears total 144 more yards and 11 more first downs than Massillon.\n\n“Our defense won the game,” Moorehead said. “It was great in the second half. The whole interior was a thing to behold.”\n\nThen Moorehead spat out names like a machine gun, mentioning linebacker and\n\nCo-Captain Carl Compton, tackle Jim Merrell and ends Steve Sikora and Bruce Johnson as his big guns.\n\nActually, the game boiled down to 2 plays – one to Massillon’s credit in the second stanza and another in Arlington’s plus column in the goodbye canto. The former was Marc Malinowski’s 75-yard interception return for a touchdown helped by Russ Fenton’s key block with 6:41 left. A pass to Smith for the conversion was incomplete.\n\nThe latter came on fourth and 7 on the Obiemen’s 29. Senior Co-Captain and halfback Gary Moore scampered 22 yards on a counter play, one of the few calls made by Moorehead all night. An offside penalty put the ball on the one and after Schmidt missed on a dive play, he drilled off tackle for the equalizer at 4:46 with Scott Hustson’s kick the clincher.\n\nIt appeared the Bengals were going to be off to the races in the first quarter. Mark McDew, junior halfback, pilfered a pass on Massillon’s 39 as Arlington went on the move after the opening kickoff.\n\nSmith raced 20 yards on an option left on the first play. Two plays later Young charged through the center for 16 yards to the 14.\n\nYoung and Smith moved the ball to the 4-yard line but the Tigers were hit with a procedure penalty. Smith and Young again combined to get to the 2 but someone in the line missed a faking maneuver and Young was tossed to the 7 ending the invasion.\n\nThe Tigertowners’ only other drive came at the beginning of the second quarter after a punt. They moved 40 yards to the Arlington 44 with McDew running 17, 10 and 8 yards.\n\nHowever, with fourth down on the Bears’ 43 and the ball short of a first down on what must have been one of the closest measurements in Bengal football history, Smith couldn’t get the necessary yardage with the Obies’ blocking short circuited.\n\nArlington made repeated drives into Bengal land and almost scored in the third period but ran into a clipping penalty on the Massillon 6. Holder Ted McNulty ran with the ball on a fake field goal attempt on fourth down but was felled 9 yards short of the mark.\n\nThe Tigers return to All-American conference warfare next week by ending the home season against Warren Harding.\n\nARLINGTON – 7\n\nEnds – Ball, McKenzie, Johnson.\n\nTackles – Carter, Merrell, Harding, Sikora.\n\nGuards – Scovanneri, Loewel, Miely.\n\nCenter – Condit.\n\nQuarterbacks – Stanley, McNulty, Reiter.\n\nHalfbacks – Moore, Gilbert, Dicke, Huston, Lloyd.\n\nFullbacks – Schmidt, Compton, Crim.\n\nMASSILLON – 6\n\nEnds – Houser, Dampier, Snyder, Richards.\n\nTackles – Snowball, Ricker, Laase, McGeorge.\n\nGuards – D.

Massillon and Niles McKinley spent 48 excruciating minutes banging away at each other on the ground with sheer brute force.\n\nBy the time the Tigers had won 14-6, the season’s largest crowd walked away with praise for both teams and the feeling that a horde of Draculas had been working on them.\n\nIn beating the Red Dragons, the Bengals got over a big hurdle and perhaps gained a big push for the last half of the season, wherein the Tigers will have to go against “5 of the toughest football teams any high school in the country will have to face, including 4 undefeated teams and 3 in the top 10 in the state,” as Coach Bob Seaman put it.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE VICTORY gave the Bengals revenge for a 20-12 defeat last year at Niles and a 1-0 record in the tough All-American Football conference. The Orange and Black are tied with Steubenville, also 1-0, for second place one-half game behind Canton McKinley (2-0).\n\nWarren and Niles are both 0-2 with Niles’ overall record 3-2 under rookie Coach Fred Conti.\n\nMassillon, undefeated in 5 games, has now won one more than in all of last season. The game ended a 5-game home stand for the Obiemen who will travel to Altoona, Pa., for a game against the Mountain Lions (4-0) who are idle this week.\n\nNiles beat the Bengals in the statistical department but not on the scoreboard as the Bengals had it in the clutch, calling on that great Tiger tradition as they have so many times in the past.\n\n“We beat a very good football team with a fine backfield tonight,” Seaman said, “we won a helluva lot of games on statistics last year, but not on the scoreboard. This time we won where it counted.”\n\n* * *\n\nCONTI, by no means dejected in defeat, said, “A couple of breaks killed us. I’m real proud of these boys. They’re a young bunch but we fought them down to the wire.”\n\nHe added, “We have only one regular returning back. When your team gives a performance like ours did in Tiger stadium, you’ve got to be proud. Massillon has a good team, but we did everything but beat them, gave them everything they wanted.”\n\nThe key to the Tigers’ success was a shift in thinking at halftime.\n\n“We ran outside the first half but couldn’t break away,” Seaman explained. “We came back and played football in the second half, running at them. We brought Mark McDew back into the formation.”\n\nMarvelous Mark, junior right half or wingback, ran only once in the first half, picking up 5 yards, but carried 10 times in the second, netting 42 yards and a touchdown, while running to the right where his ability is at its best.\n\n* * *\n\nQUARTERBACK Trevor Young did some good work on the keeper to pick up key yardage. Tailback Jim Smith did his usual bull-like job from the tailback slot with the aid of some good holes.\n\nOn the other side, junior fullback Lou Tabor, senior halfback Roger Jones led the way behind some fine blocking.\n\nThe Tigers mounted the first offensive, a 26-yard first quarter affair which ended when senior halfback Joe Gayonski intercepted a Young-to-McDew sky shot from the Dragons’ 34 on second down. Gayonski landed in the end zone for a touchback.\n\nNiles got going in the second period, moving 71 yards to the Tigers 7 before fumbling with Russ Fenton, Bengal end, diving on the ball at the 20. Tabor combined 14 and 15-yard runs with 2 personal foul penalties to spearhead the drive.\n\nThe Bengals monopolized play for almost the entire first half of the third quarter, taking the kickoff and moving 71 yards with the help of a 23-yard jaunt by Smith, a 10-yard run by McDew and an 8-yarder by Reggie Moore but lost the ball on downs at the Niles 26.\n\n* * *\n\nTWO PLAYS LATER, tackle Tom Houser batted a pass into a fly ball. Moore intercepted and the Obiemen had a first down on the 26. After Young had scampered 13 yards for a first down on the 12, Smith cut back against the grain off left tackle for a touchdown with 5:02 left. Moore dove over right tackle for an 8-0 lead.\n\nThen it was the Dragons’ turn roaring back 74 yards with Jones, Tabor and Gayonski taking turns blasting away at the Tigers’ line. Gayonski’s 21-yard runback started the trouble while Jones added to the Bengals’ misery with a 14-yard run for a first down at the Massillon 40.\n\nGayonski finished things by catching a 9-yard fourth down pass from quarterback Lou Lukz on the one and falling into the end zone with 9:50 showing on the clock in the fourth quarter. McDew intercepted a pass intended for John Ziegler to thwart the conversion try.\n\nThe Obiemen then drove 55 yards in short bursts with McDew and Young toting the pigskin and getting a personal foul penalty thrown in. Smith picked up a key first down on the 25 by vaulting over a steep pile in the middle of the line. McDew ran around end for 18 yards to the one and then off right tackle for the score with 5:17 left.\n\nYoung tried to run for 2 more points but failed to skirt the right end.\n\nHouser uncorked a 60-yard punt into the end zone for a touchback with 1:49 seconds left to cap a good night of kicking by himself and Moore but Niles still wasn’t through. With Ziegler switching to quarterback and doing some fancy running in bursts of 11 and\n\n15 yards and Tabor adding 14, the Dragons had second and 13 from the Tigers’ 41.\n\nBut Young, inserted at safety, picked off a pass at the Bengals’ 10 and ran back 19 yards as the game was about to end.\n\nNILES – 6\n\nEnds – Ziegler, Joseph, Campbell, Kay, Reigle.\n\nTackles – Goodhart, Limongi, Klenoviv, Bohach.\n\nGuards – R.
