        "text": "Hey Ben! Good question. Manchester City are definitely not hard-coded in to the Champions League in season one. I don’t know how they coded the algorithm, so I can’t say whether it was purely random or if they used a weighting, but I ran a couple of test saves before doing this for real and in one Manchester United were in the CL (I can’t recall who was in it the third time – Liverpool, maybe). You’re right, it should have been Leeds. On the scale of programming oddities, I’d say having the wrong number of teams in each division ranked slightly higher in my mind - ha ha.\n\nOche, this is the last season on the CM1 engine. After this one, we move to the “original” CM2. I mentioned this in the preamble but there are a few noticeable differences between the two engines. I’ll address one of them in this post, the other couple I’ll speak to in more depth as the game ports forward.\n\n============\n\nThe Summer of 1994\n\nEngland isn’t in the World Cup but never mind that, we have a couple of meaningless friendlies to report on! Up first it’s Greece, followed by Norway five days later.\n\nEngland vs Greece\n\nFriendly\n\nWembley Stadium, London\n\nLineups:\n\nEngland: Chris Woods; Gavin Johnson (Tony Dorigo 82), Terry Phelan, Gary Pallister, Paul Lake; Nigel Clough, David Platt ©, Paul Gascoigne, Kevin Watson (Alan Wright 63); Alan Shearer, David Hirst (Ian Wright 70)\n\nGreece: Karkamanis, Apostolakis, Kolitsidaikis (Karataidis 46), Kalitzakis, Karagiannis, Kofidis (Kostis 70), Nioplias, Tsalouchidis ©, Tsiantakis, Hantzikis (Mitropoulos 46), Machlas (Saravakos 46)\n\nThe one thing you have to say about England under Terry Venables so far: they are entertainers. Again led by David Platt, England racked up a dominating 5-0 win over a hapless Greek side. Given the quality of the opposition you might question why Venables wouldn’t have selected a younger starting keeper, such as Tim Flowers of Southampton or David Seaman of Chelsea, either of whom might be ready to wear the #1 at Euro 96.\n\nThe rout started in the 24th minute when Kevin Watson scored his first international goal. David Hirst made it two in the 37th. Just before half time, a Platt penalty made it 3-0 heading back to the dressing rooms. Seemingly realizing that they were out of their depth, the Greeks made three substitutions at half time, but it didn’t stop the flood of goals – Platt grabbed his second in the 55th minute and Alan Shearer rounded out the scoring in the 65th. Alan Wright came on just before Shearer’s goal to make his England debut and the Blackburn left-sided player appeared to settle in well. Ian Wright and Tony Dorigo also made late cameo appearances. Stiffer competition awaits in a few days’ time.\n\nFinal Score; England 5-0 Greece (Watson 24, Hirst 37, Platt 45 (pen) 55, Shearer 65)\n\nEngland vs Norway\n\nFriendly\n\nWembley Stadium, London\n\nLineups:\n\nEngland: Tony Coton; Gavin Johnson, Terry Phelan, Gary Pallister, Paul Lake; Nigel Clough (Scott Thomas 76), David Platt ©, David Batty, Kevin Watson (Ian Wright 76); Alan Shearer, David Hirst\n\nNorway: Erik Thorstvedt (By Rise 86); Henning Berg, Ronny Johnsen, Rune Bratseth ©, Roger Nilsen (Sorloth HT), Jostein Flo, Orjan Berg (Ingebrigsten 66), Lars Bohinen, Jan Age Fjortoft (Haland 46), Kjetil Rekdal, Mini Jakobson\n\nBoth teams will be off to Orlando after this one, the difference is that Norway will be going to play in the World Cup while England will be going to work on their tan. A game devoid of creativity and inspiration was a tale of two teams looking to get very different things out of this fixture: for England coach Terry Venables, it was to continue to look at a younger core of players he hopes will help guide him to Euro 96. For Norway, it was a case of avoiding injury. Mission accomplished. For the 79,000 fans who paid for tickets, I’m sorry.\n\nFinal Score: England 0-0 Norway\n\n***\n\nAfter the friendlies it’s time for soccer! World Cup 94 happened!\n\nTo knock down a fourth wall for a second, I’ll remind you that the CM1 engine did not have playable internationals so there’s nothing to report on that would be different from our history. If you don’t know what happened in real life, Wikipedia is a wonderful website. So’s YouTube.\n\nWhile the eyes of the footballing world were firmly fixed on the USA, both UEFA and the FA decided to make some announcements on upcoming changes to their competitions, all of which will take effect next year.\n\nIn Europe, as was previously rumoured, this will be the last year of the two-legged UEFA Cup Final. In 1995/96, we’ll move to a one-off game held at a neutral venue. There are also extensive changes to the format of the Champions League, whereby the group stage is moved to the start of the competition and a knock-out competition follows. We believe this format will prove to be more exciting so we’re all for it.\n\nIn England, big changes are coming. The FA approves a plan to expand the league from 80 to 92 teams. The Premier League will remain at 20 teams; however, as part of a new sponsorship arrangement with Endsleigh, Divisions One, Two and Three will be expanded to 24 teams. This means 12 teams will be promoted from the Conference to Division Three at the end of the year. Although we’re convinced the true motivation is money, there is a faint story offered which says expanded divisions are good for the competitiveness of the game. No one buys it.\n\n***\n\nThe Transfer Market\n\nThe summer begins with the expected annual exodus of top domestic talent for opportunities abroad. As the departures are announced we can’t help but wonder whether there will come a time in which the world’s top talent will want to come to the Premier League rather than wanting to leave it. The hardest hit team is champions Leeds who lose Tony Dorigo to AC Milan, Gary McAllister to Juventus and Gary Speed to Napoli. Manchester United are hit with the departures of Gary Pallister to Lazio and Eric Cantona, who heads back to France, rejoining Marseille. On the other side of town, Manchester City lose defender Paul Lake to Roma, while midfielder Fitzroy Simpson joins Cologne in Germany. The other big name on the move is Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, who moves to Genoa. An impressive summer for Serie A.\n\nWithin England, there are several big transfers through the summer, the most noteworthy of which is Teddy Sheringham moving from Tottenham to Everton for 1.7m. That unites two of the Premier League’s most prolific strikers in Sheringham and Tony Cottee, so we’ll be curious to see how they work as a pair. Tottenham replaces Sheringham with World Cup Golden Boot winner Oleg Salenko, which is a fantastically intriguing signing.\n\nManchester United bring in England international Alan Wright from Blackburn for a fee of 1.5m. This deal strikes us as odd, given United already have Lee Sharpe and Ryan Giggs capable of playing left wing, while Denis Irwin holds down the left back spot. We'll see how the diminutive Wright fits in to Fergie's plans, especially considering he is rumoured to have a bumper crop of youngsters a year away from breaking into the first team.\n\nChampions Leeds begin replenishing their team by signing Newcastle midfielder Robert Lee for 900k and QPR defender Darren Peacock for 1.4 million. We like both moves. The biggest transfer from a fee perspective is newly-promoted Norwich selling Mark Robins to Liverpool for 2.1 million. In a separate deal, Liverpool also sign Norwich’s number one keeper, Mark Walton, for 500k. Norwich then use the proceeds to sign Jon Hallworth, who was Oldham’s number one last year, for 300k. We'll dive deeper in to this during the season preview but we feel as though Liverpool have lost their way and are likely to regress this year.\n\nThe last purchase that catches our eye is Nick Barmby’s move from Arsenal to Sheffield Wednesday for 1.6 million. The Gunners also sell Jimmy Carter and Pal Lyderson in the summer, which leads me to believe a major asset stripping might take place this year. Bruce Rioch’s side still have Steve Bould, Lee Dixon, John Jensen, Paul Merson, Pat Nevin, Ray Parlour, Alan Smith, Nigel Winterburn and Ian Wright on their books so they will be a very intriguing team to keep an eye on, although maybe not for the reasons Arsenal fans would be hoping for.\n\nUp next: The Season Preview\n\nHello and welcome to our preview of the 1994/95 Premier League season. Can Leeds win their third title in four years? Will Brian Clough ride off into the sunset a champion? Will Alex Ferguson finally be able to guide Manchester United to a Premier League crown? Can any of the newly-promoted teams avoid the drop?\n\nHere’s our thoughts.\n\nPre-season Preview – Part One: The Relegation Battle\n\n20th – Millwall\n\nManager: Mick McCarthy – you'll have to excuse our bias, but we believe the Premier League is a better place with Slick Mick in it. Rough around the edges, very quotable, and generally disliked by everyone, he's a pundit's delight.\n\nLast Season: 1st in Division One, and out in front for a majority of the season.\n\nTransfers in: None\n\nTransfers out: Ian Bogie, Aston Villa 950k\n\nProjected XI: Ben Roberts / Colin Cooper, Andy Melville, David Thompson, Keith Stevens / Phil Barber, Owen Archdeacon, Darron Wilkinson, Malcolm Allen / Dean Holdsworth, Etienne Verver\n\nKey Man: Malcolm Allen. The Welsh winger has been one of Division One’s best players the past three years. He’ll need a big year if Millwall are to have any chance of staying up.\n\nPrediction: 20th. Even though they won Division One last year, the Lions’ squad looks most likely to struggle with the step up. We'd expect their time in the top-flight to be short.\n\n19th – Sunderland\n\nManager: Terry Butcher – the former England captain is back in the top flight for the first time since being sacked by Coventry in January of 1992. He has yet to really prove his managerial chops at the highest level.\n\nLast Season: 3rd in Division One and Playoff Winners. Rode the back of Lee Glover's 33 goals to get into the Premier League. Beat a strong Crystal Palace side in the Playoff Final to secure their spot.\n\nTransfers in: Martyn Margetson, Man City 250k; Louie Donowa, Birmingham 150k; Geraint Williams, Ipswich 40k\n\nTransfers out: Kieron Brady, Sheff Wed 850k; John Colquhoun, Hull 100k\n\nKey Man: Lee Glover. While big things are expected from young Ugo Ehiogu, Sunderland’s ability to survive will be based on whether last year’s 33-goal man can do the job at Premier League level.\n\nPrediction: 19th. Another newly-promoted team that looks like it is in for a real battle to stay up. There are a couple of good pieces there but they need investment to secure their survival.\n\n18th – Barnsley\n\nManager: Mel Machin – did a very good job steering the Tykes to safety last year. This is his sixth season as the Barnsley boss and he seems to be as secure in his role as any manager could be.\n\nLast Season: 17th. Mission accomplished. The signing of Lee Chapman from Leeds at the transfer deadline, and the seven goals he provided afterward, was the difference between going down and staying up.\n\nTransfers in: Gary Penrice, QPR 600k; Marcus Ebdon, Birmingham 450k\n\nTransfers out:\n\nProjected XI: Lee Butler / Gary Fleming, Michael Johnson, Charlie Bishop, Brian Statham / Simon Sturridge, Neil Redfearn, Marcus Ebdon, Brendan O'Connell / Andy Liddell, Gary Penrice\n\nKey Man: Gary Penrice. Barnsley smashed their previous transfer record when bringing in the former QPR striker. They will need his goals to avoid the drop.\n\nPrediction: 18th. Just got across the line last year but look destined to be in tough again this year. With Norwich looking very likely to stay up, they’ll need at least one other team to falter.\n\n17th – Coventry\n\nManager: Bobby Gould – built up a lot of cache with the Coventry fans by winning the League Cup in 1993. Now in his third season with the Sky Blues.\n\nLast Season: 15th. Benefited greatly from the fact that the bottom four teams were dreadful.\n\nTransfers in: Chris Billy, Stockport 200k; Carl Muggleton, Leeds 750k; Mike Evans, Fulham 400k\n\nTransfers out: None\n\nProjected XI: Carl Muggleton / Phil Babb, Peter Billing, Richard Jobson, Kevin Ashley / Istvan Kozma, Stewart Robson, Lloyd McGrath, Sean Flynn / Peter Ndlovu, Martin Curruthers\n\nKey Man: Peter Ndlovu. Started to show his potential last year by grabbing ten league goals. Will need to do more this year.\n\nPrediction: 17th. We expect more of the same this year. They'll hover just above the relegation zone and ultimately secure their survival with a couple of games to spare. Having said that, an injury to their prime goal threat, Peter Ndlovu, could leave them in a world of trouble.\n\n16th – Norwich\n\nManager: Mike Walker – Norwich kept faith in their man after they were relegated two years ago, and he repaid their faith by guiding them right back up. Now in his third year as Canaries boss and hoping his second kick at the Premier League can will work out better than the first attempt.\n\nLast Season: 2nd in Division One. Secured automatic promotion on the last day of the season after managing to keep together the nucleus of the team which went down the year before.\n\nTransfers in: Jon Hallworth, Oldham 300k; Stuart Barlow, Man City 600k\n\nTransfers out: Mark Walton, Liverpool 500k; Mark Robins, Liverpool 2.1m\n\nProjected XI: Jon Hallworth / Mark Bowen, Ian Butterworth, Darren Wassall, Ian Culverhouse / Ian Crook, Daryl Sutch, David Phillips, David Smith / Stuart Barlow, Lee Power\n\nKey Man: Stuart Barlow. With the sale of Mark Robins to Liverpool, a lot of pressure will be on the former Manchester City man to get in the goals.\n\nPrediction: 16th. If they hadn't sold Mark Robins we would have felt very confident that the Canaries would survive. Now we're quite not as sure, but we still think they'll be okay. A bad start would be deadly, though.\n\nThis is part two of our season preview, profiling the squishy middle – the teams that are probably just going to be happy knowing they’re likely to survive another year in the top flight but might need to look over their shoulder if it doesn’t go to plan. As is the norm, our third part will focus on the ‘second tier’ of teams, which might be able to contend if all goes well, while our last preview focuses on the teams we think have a legitimate shot at a title.\n\nPre-season Preview – Part Two: The Mid-Table Scrappers\n\n15th – QPR\n\nManager: Gerry Francis – has done well in his time as Rs boss, navigating the team to mid-table finishes the past two years, but fans might be expecting more from him soon.\n\nLast Season: 9th. Spent most of the first half of last year in the top four but fell away with the enforced sale of Les Ferdinand.\n\nTransfers in: Robert Edwards, Crewe 150k\n\nTransfers out: Gary Penrice, Barnsley 600k; Mark Bright, Sheff Wed 70k; Darren Peacock, 1.4m\n\nProjected XI: Jan Stejskal / Rufus Brevett, Alan McDonald, Brian Law, Danny Maddix / Andy Sinton, Simon Barker, Steve Claridge, Andy Impey / David Howells, Bradley Allen\n\nKey Man: David Howells. Even though his biggest offensive output in a year is five goals, he’s become the team’s number one man. He’ll need to step up in a big way.\n\nPrediction: 15th. Worrying signs here. The sale of Les Ferdinand last year was a surprise, but are the sales of Gary Penrice and Darren Peacock signs that QPR is a team with a real financial problem? They might end up getting sucked into a relegation dog-fight if they have to sell anyone else.\n\n14th – Derby\n\nManager: Arthur Cox – a well respected veteran manager who steered Derby to safety in their first season at the Premier League level. Cox has over 20 years of managerial experience, including time in the top flight with both Newcastle and Derby.\n\nLast Season: 14th. Got off to a great start, on the backs of their two young strikers, Paul Kitson and Tommy Johnson. That was enough to secure them safety.\n\nTransfers in: None\n\nTransfers out: None\n\nProjected XI: Martin Taylor / Colin Woodthorpe, Craig Short, Chris Coleman, Ian Nolan / Craig Ramage, Mark Pembridge, Martin Kuhl, Tommy Johnson / Paul Simpson, Paul Kitson\n\nKey Man: Tommy Johnson. Had no difficulty making the step up to Premier League level last year – will now look to take the next step towards becoming an elite player.\n\nPrediction: 14th. A number of teams struggle in their second season in the top-flight. We think Derby have enough to survive but big clubs will start circling in on some of their young guns and they could end up in trouble if they're forced to sell.\n\n13th – Liverpool\n\nManager: Graeme Souness - Hasn't achieved as manager what he did as captain. We called last year his make-or-break year, but they slid from 5th to 10th. Might be short on time.\n\nLast Season: 10th - Were among the top pack early on but the lack of goals and squad depth ended up costing them.\n\nTransfers in: Tommy Watson, Tranmere 450k; Mark Walton, Norwich 500k; Mark Robins, Norwich 2.1m; Deion Vernon, Bristol City 100k\n\nTransfers out:\n\nProjected XI: Mark Walton / David Burrows, Marin Keown, Toben Piechnik, Rob Jones / Scott Sellars, Steve Harkness, Jamie Redknapp, Russell Beardsmore / Don Hutchison, Paul Stewart\n\nKey man: Don Hutchison – we’re confident this will be his breakout year. If It’s not, look out, this could go very wrong.\n\nPrediction: 13th. An ageing, thin squad which might be short on goals and a manager who is making questionable decisions in the transfer market is not a good combination. We think they're taking steps backward.\n\n12th – Chelsea\n\nManager: Dave Webb - In his third season as Blues boss, Webb is a club legend who hasn't quite worked out as a manager. The Stamford Bridge support will be looking for improvement, quickly.\n\nLast Season: 16th. Underachieved again, but never really seemed to be in danger of the drop.\n\nTransfers in: Jamie Murphy, Stockport 100k\n\nTransfers out: Damian Matthew, Blackburn 1.2m\n\nProjected XI: David Seaman / Frank Sinclair, Gareth Hall, David Lee, Steve Clarke / Dennis Wise, Andy Townsend, Craig Burley, Scott Houghton / Graham Stuart, Roy Wegerle\n\nKey Man: Roy Wegerle – signed last year from Coventry and banged in ten goals in 25 appearances. Provides Chelsea a real goal threat, something a number of other teams lack.\n\nPrediction: 12th. There are a number of teams in the league who look like they're going to take a step backward and Chelsea might benefit from this. The sale of Damian Matthew was a surprise, but we think there’s enough in the midfield and up front to push closer to mid-table this year. A slow start will surely cost Dave Webb his job.\n\n11th – Southampton\n\nManager: Ian Branfoot – Entering his fourth year as Saints boss, the former Reading man has established Southampton as a comfortable mid-table team.\n\nLast Season: 7th. Continued to outperform expectations in Matt Le Tissier's breakout season.\n\nTransfers in: Mark Patterson, Birmingham 200k\n\nTransfers out:\n\nProjected XI: Tim Flowers / Francis Benali, Richard Hall, Ken Monkou, Jason Dodd / Alan Stubbs, Perry Groves / Chris Sutton, Iain Dowie, Matt Le Tissier, Simon Ireland\n\nKey Man: Matt Le Tissier – will be an England regular by the end of the year. Last year he broke through in a big way with 15 goals, some of which were absolute class. We think this is just the start.\n\nPrediction: 11th. Every year we look at this team and think they're likely to be fighting relegation. Not this time- with Matt Le Tissier proving himself to be one of the Premier League's real stars, and the man up front alongside him, Chris Sutton, looking like another potential star, we think the Saints will be fine. Mid-table awaits.\n\n10th – Wimbledon\n\nManager: Joe Kinnear - abrasive and difficult to like but finds a way to get the most out of his team. Came to Selhurst Park without much of a resume but has done very well in his two years in charge\n\nLast Season: 8th. Another year of safe, mid-table results.\n\nTransfers in: Kevin Gage, Sheff Utd 200k\n\nTransfers out: Scott Fitzgerald, Man City 800k; Steve Thompson, Man City 100k\n\nProjected XI: Neil Sullivan / Brian McAllister, John Scales, Dean Blackwell, Roger Joseph / Andy Clarke, Robbie Earle, Paul Cook, Neal Ardley / Ian Olney, Paul Miller\n\nKey Man: Dean Blackwell – unlike most of the other teams at this level, Wimbledon has built a strong defence first. Where they lack in attacking skill and flair, they’re rock solid in defence and that should ensure they’re one of the division’s toughest teams to score against.\n\nPrediction: 10th. With no real star players but a solid back four, they are a stronger team than the sum of their parts. Wimbledon defies the odds to finish mid-pack every year and with the division looking pretty thin on a whole, we expect more of the same this year.\n\nPre-season Preview – Part Three: The Wannabes\n\n9th – Blackburn\n\nManager: Kenny Dalglish – the man who could do no wrong in charge of Liverpool just hasn’t seemed to have the same magic touch at Blackburn. Call it a hunch but we wouldn’t be surprised if this was his last year in charge at Ewood Park.\n\nLast Season: 12th. A team from which much was hoped, they never came close to meeting expectations. Alan Shearer has yet to develop into the goal scorer Dalglish would have hoped.\n\nTransfers in: Jon Moncur, Swindon 200k; Pal Lyderson, Arsenal 250k; Damian Matthew, Chelsea 1.2m\n\nTransfers out: Alan Wright, Manchester United 1.5m\n\nProjected XI: Bobby Mimms / Henning Berg, Eddie McGoldrick, Patrik Andersson, Mark Atkins / Jason Wilcox, Graham Hyde, Steve Palmer, Jamie Pollock / Alan Shearer, Mike Newell\n\nKey Man: Alan Shearer. One of England’s best if he can stay healthy. If he can, this might be the year he begins to fulfill his promise.\n\nPrediction: 9th. If Shearer stays healthy we think they have the potential to finish in the top eight, but something seems off at Ewood Park. While we’re predicting another year of mid-table security, we wouldn’t be surprised if they shot the lights out and became legitimate title threats or if it all went horribly wrong.\n\n8th – Tottenham\n\nManager: Doug Livermore - starting his third season in charge of Spurs; however, given the way the second half of the season went for him, he'll likely be on a very short leash to start the season and a poor start could see him winning the sack race.\n\nLast Season: 13th. Last year, “doing a Spurs” became synonymous with finding ridiculous ways to lose. Runaway leaders in the first half of the season, managed only eight points from their last 19 games.\n\nTransfers in: Dean Williams, Luton 150k; Ian Hamilton, Huddersfield 80k; Oleg Salenko, Spain 1.4m\n\nTransfers out: Andy Turner, Man City 250k; Teddy Sheringham, Everton 1.7m\n\nProjected XI: Ian Walker / Andy Hinchcliffe, Gary Mabbutt, Neil Ruddock, Gundi Bergsson / Kevin Watson, Ian Woan, Vinny Samways, Darren Anderton / Gordon Durie, Oleg Salenko\n\nKey Man: Oleg Salenko – it was a tremendous gamble to bring in the World Cup Golden Boot winner to replace a proven Premier League striker like Teddy Sheringham. Sure, the Russian striker could do it in the USA over the summer, but could he manage to replicate the same types of performances on a wet, windy Tuesday night in Sunderland? We’ll see.\n\nPrediction: 8th. Last year we said we felt like Tottenham was building a solid core and was 1-2 years away from competing. This year, we’re not so sure. It would be nice to think that the way they finished last year is all in the past and will be forgotten about, but you know that the Spurs players and supporters will all be on tenterhooks and a slow start could see the knives come out. If Salenko doesn’t hit the ground running, it could mark the last throw of the dice for Doug Livermore’s run as manager.\n\n7th – Sheffield Wednesday\n\nManager: Trevor Francis – has adapted to the challenges of managerial life well so far, guiding Wednesday to three top-half finishes during his time in charge.\n\nLast Season: 3rd. Overachieved yet again, led by the veteran leadership of Chris Waddle and the now-departed David Hirst.\n\nTransfers in: Kieron Brady, Sunderland 850k; Marvin Johnson, Luton 150k; Nick Barmby, Arsenal 1.6m; Mark Bright, QPR 70k\n\nTransfers out: David Hirst, Genoa 1.7m\n\nProjected XI: Chris Woods / Phil King, Ian Marshall, Carlton Palmer, Julian Watts / Paul Bernard, John Sheridan, Nick Barmby, Chris Waddle / Paul Warhurst, Chris Bart-Williams\n\nKey Man: Paul Warhurst -with his striking partner gone, it’s time for the big man to step up and take over as the lead offensive threat.\n\nPrediction: 7th. The loss of David Hirst leaves some concerns about who will provide the goals, but we think Paul Warhurst and Chris Bart-Williams can help fill the void. The squad is ageing, though, and they'll need an influx of younger talent to continue to hang with the real title contenders.\n\n6th – Manchester City\n\nManager: Peter Reid – proving to be a manager of real quality in his first role as a boss. In four years, he claimed a Premier League, League Cup and FA Cup title, as well as a hat-full of managerial awards. Next in line to be England manager?\n\nLast Season: 11th. Overextended by competing on four fronts. League Cup and FA Cup winners and Champions League finalists, the squad just ran out of gas in the league and slid down the table.\n\nTransfers in: Scott Fitzgerald, Wimbledon 800k; Matthew Bound, Bristol City 80k; Andy Walker, Charlton 200k; Andy Turner, Tottenham 250k; Steve Thompson, Wimbledon 100k\n\nTransfers Out: Martyn Margetson, Sunderland 250k; Stuart Barlow, Norwich 600k; Lee Jones, Leeds 500k; Paul Lake, Roma 1.7m; Fitzroy Simpson, Cologne 1.2m\n\nProjected XI: Tony Coton / Terry Phelan, Michael Vonk, Scott Fitzgerald, Gavin Johnson / Andy Turner, Gary Flitcroft, David Brightwell, Scott Thomas / Mike Sheron, David White\n\nKey Man: Gary Flitcroft – with the departure of Fitzroy Simpson, he’ll need to take over the role of midfield general for what appears to be a very young, very thin group.\n\nPrediction: 6th. The squad looks too thin to compete for a title, and they’ll be asked to compete on four fronts again, but with the guidance of one of the division’s best managers, they should be safe in the second tier. We’d like to see at least one experienced midfielder arrive, though.\n\n5th Aston Villa\n\nManager: Ron Atkinson – One of the leading personalities in the Premier League, Big Ron's got over 20 years of experience. He's established Villa as an upper-mid table team and is maybe one or two pieces away from being a real contender.\n\nLast Season: 6th – the inspired signing of Tony Adams made Villa rock solid at the back, while Dean Saudners’ goals counted for a lion’s share of the offense.\n\nTransfers in: Ian Taylor, Brentford 150k; Ian Bogie, Millwall 950k\n\nTransfers out: Nigel Spink, Bradford 10k\n\nProjected XI: Mark Bosnich / Steve Staunton, Tony Adams, Steve Redmond, Earl Barrett / Dwight Yorke, Scot Gemmill, Mark Blake, Garry Parker / Dalian Atkinson, Dean Saunders\n\nKey Man: Dean Saunders – his goals keep Villa in the top half of the table. If that production line dries up, they’ll take a big step backward.\n\nPrediction: 5th. There's a lot to like here but they depend too much on Dean Saunders. If they can find someone to help carry the load (and to date Dalian Atkinson hasn't proven he can be the one to do that) they'll be right in the title hunt. If not, it'll be another year in the second tier.\n\nUp next – a look at the Contenders\n\nPre-Season Preview – Part Four: The Contenders\n\nThis is it – a look at the four teams which we think have the best chance of lifting the championship trophy at the end of the season.\n\n4th – Leeds\n\nManager: Howard Wilkinson - Has finished 1st, 4th and 1st in the past three years. One of England's top managers, leading one of its most famous clubs. In his eighth season with Leeds.\n\nLast season: 1st. Won the league for the second time in three years, by being the least worst in a terribly mediocre league.\n\nTransfers in: Philip Jones, Luton 150k; Robert Lee, Newcastle 900k; Paul Jones, Wigan 100k; Darren Peacock, QPR 1.4m; Lee Jones, Man City 500k\n\nTransfers out: Carl Muggleton, Coventry 750k; Tony Dorigo, AC Milan 1.7m; Gary McAllister, Juventus 2.2m; Gary Speed, Napoli 1.2m\n\nProjected XI: Nigel Martyn / Mark Stimson, Jon Newsome, Chris Fairclough, David Kerslake / Steve Hodge, David Batty, Jason Rees, Robert Lee / Rod Wallace, Paul Williams\n\nKey Man: David Batty – with three influential players moving to the continent, this is now Batty’s team. Can he fill the gap that Gary McAllister leaves behind?\n\nPrediction: 4th. The Champions have lost their best defender, best midfielder and a young starlet to moves to the continent. While we like the moves they've started making to fill the gaps, we still think they're likely to take a step back this year.\n\n3rd – Everton\n\nManager: Howard Kendall – guided Everton to glory in the 80s and although he hasn’t achieved the same levels of success in his second stint as boss, it’s tough to argue with two consecutive top-five finishes.\n\nLast season: 5th. Carried to another top-five finish in the league thanks to Tony Cottee’s goals\n\nTransfers in: Teddy Sheringham, Tottenham 1.7m; Paul Mardon, Ipswich 600k\n\nTransfers out: none\n\nProjected XI: Mike Hooper / David Unsworth, Paul Mardon, Stig Inge Bjornbye, Matt Jackson / Peter Beagrie, John Ebbrell, Billy Kenny, Stuart Ripley / Tony Cottee, Teddy Sheringham\n\nKey man: Teddy Sheringham. A bold pickup by Everton, he is an elite goal scorer at this level. How he links up with Tony Cottee will determine whether they’re legitimate title contenders.\n\nPrediction: 3rd. They should more than enough going forward to be among the leaders again. We have questions about their midfield, though, and that might be the difference between first and third.\n\n2nd – Manchester United\n\nManager: Alex Ferguson - Came into England announcing that his goal was knock Liverpool off their perch. Has yet to be able to lead United to an elusive title but the pieces are all there for the team to be a contender for years to come.\n\nLast Season: 4th. Continued to knock at the door, as part of the second tier of teams, but can't seem to crack the group of top teams. Their final position flatters them slightly, given they were never really in contention.\n\nTransfers in: Alan Wright, Blackburn 1.5m\n\nTransfers out: Gary Pallister, Lazio 1.2m; Eric Cantona, Marseille 1.3m\n\nProjected XI: Peter Schmeichel / Alan Wright, Colin Hendry, Paul Parker, Denis Irwin / Lee Sharpe, Paul Ince, Clayton Blackmore, Ryan Giggs / Gavin Peacock, Guy Whittingham\n\nPrediction: 2nd. Every year we look at United on paper and think this is the year they'll break through. Every year they prove us wrong. We think they'll be in the hunt again.\n\n1st – Nottingham Forest\n\nManager: Brian Clough – Rumoured to be retiring for the past couple of seasons, this marks 20 years in charge of Forest and Cloughie is back for one more shot at a title. The man who has done it all as boss is a true legend – just ask him.\n\nLast Season: A slow start, revitalized by the signing of Les Ferdinand. If the season ran 42 games instead of 38, probably would have ended up winning the league.\n\nTransfers in: None\n\nTransfers out: None\n\nProjected XI: Mark Crossley / Stuart Pearce, Steve Chettle, Carl Tiler, Gary Charles / Kingsley Black, Roy Keane, Nigel Clough, Gary Crosby / Les Ferdinand, Stan Collymore\n\nPrediction: 1st. We called them a dark horse pick for the title last year and they came very close. A full year with Les Ferdinand in the squad should be what pushes them over the top.\n\nUp next: the season kicks off\n\nThe magic of the first day of a new season is upon us!\n\nFrom a logistics perspective, Cardiff return to the Football League after one year in the Conference, so that is my new team for the year. It's the last year on the CM1 engine, but my 20-odd years of experience playing this game and the practice saves I ran prepping this story tell me that we should expect to see a couple of differences in the world this year.\n\n1)Some managerial movement. Teams are pretty static the first couple of years, but I've found that things start to happen in year three.\n\n2)More money being spent. In real life this was the year of Klinsmann joining from Monaco, Keegan splashing cash with Newcastle, and big money moves for Andy Cole, Romanian World Cup stars, Yeboah signing for Leeds, et al. We won't see 7m moves but more of the 1-2 million type transfers should take place.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, let's get going!\n\n==============\n\nRound 1\n\nThe fixture computer throws up a glamour tie in the first week of the year when Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to take on United. With both teams hoping to be among the lead pack this is a great measuring stick for the two sides. A good sign for Alex Ferguson, then, is that the game is all United. Goals from Ryan Giggs and Gavin Peacock give them a 2-0 victory.\n\nIn Birmingham, the defending champions Leeds kick off their season with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. Mark Stimson, debutant Lee Jones, and Welsh midfielder Jason Rees score for the visitors, while Dean Saunders (who else) replies for Villa. We flagged that his strike partner Dalian Atkinson would need to have a big year if Villa are to be a legitimate contender but rather than find the net, Atkinson saw red in this one.\n\nWe picked Nottingham Forest to win the title this year and they opened their season with a trip to Roker Park to face newly-promoted Sunderland. Forest batter the Mackems racking up chance after chance but poor finishing leads to the inevitable goal completely against the run of play: Richard Ord climbs the highest from a corner to head past Mark Crossley and give Terry Butcher's men the 1-0 win.\n\nFellow newly-promoted side Millwall started their life in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Blackburn. Colin Cooper grabs the goal for Mick McCarthy's side. It's a much less happy return for Norwich, though: they are well beaten by Tottenham, 3-0. Gordon Durie, Kevin Watson and Mike Marsh all score for Spurs, while new signing Oleg Salenko is taken off injured in the first half.\n\nElsewhere, the combination of Teddy Sheringham and Tony Cottee looks good as both men score in a 3-1 win for Everton over Southampton, and Chelsea beat Sheffield Wednesday by the same score, and Liverpool grab a 2-0 away win over QPR.\n\nRound 2\n\nWe'll start at Maine Road where there might be two stories developing. The first is Chelsea potentially starting to get their act together after years of underachievement under Dave Webb. The second is Manchester City slumping to their second straight defeat. Irish midfielder Andy Townsend scores twice in the Blues win, sending Chelsea to the top of the table, while City are in the basement.\n\nJoining Chelsea atop the league is Tottenham who pick up their second consecutive win with a 1-0 win over Derby at the Baseball Ground. Gordon Durie scores for the second straight game in the victory. Champions Leeds are held by Wimbledon in their first home game of the year. Rob Lee gets his first Leeds goal in the game and Howard Wilkinson's men have four points from two games, while Joe Kinnear's Dons have started with two straight draws. Liverpool and Manchester United are also both on four points from two games after they each drew this round: Liverpool were held 1-1 by Aston Villa at Anfield while United struggled to a scoreless draw against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.\n\nWe had fears about QPR this year and already there are worrying signs for Gerry Francis's team. They slump to their second straight 2-0 defeat, going down to Blackburn at Ewood Park. They sit alongside Manchester City with no points from their first two games.\n\nElsewhere, Gary Penrice scores twice in his home debut for Barnsley as they beat Everton 2-1, and Matt Le Tissier and Iain Dowie each score twice in Southampton's wild 4-2 victory over Terry Butcher's Sunderland.\n\nRound 2 Table: Tottenham, Chelsea 6; Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester United 4\n\nDerby, Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday 1; Manchester City, QPR 0\n\nRound 3\n\nNormally we start weekly round-ups with a look at what's happening at the top or bottom of the table, but there is only one place to start this recap: Roker Park, where we see a new record high-scoring game. Terry Butcher's Sunderland side have already been involved in a couple of noteworthy games, but they mark their arrival in the Premier League in style by hammering Norwich 7-2. The seven goals is a new record, as is the nine total goals in the game. 38-year-old Viv Anderson scores one, Gordon Armstrong gets two, and Green gets four from the bench. In doing so, he becomes only the second player in Premier League history to hit four in a game. Lee Power scores twice for the Canaries in a night to forget.\n\nAt the top of the table, Chelsea remain joint-top of the league, after a 1-1 draw with Blackburn at Stamford Bridge. Kevin Gallacher gave Kenny Dalglish's team the lead before substitute Robert Fleck grabs the Blues' equalizer. Moving alongside Chelsea on seven points is Leeds, who beat Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park. Young Welsh striker Lee Jones, who was signed from Manchester City in the summer, scores his second goal in three league games for the champions. Jones barely got a look-in at City last season but famously scored the FA Cup-winning goal in last year's final, in what proved to be his last appearance in a City lineup.\n\nAs you may have inferred, Tottenham were beaten this week, going down 2-1 at home against Sheffield Wednesday. Oleg Salenko scored his first goal in a Spurs uniform to give them the lead but a Chris Bart-Williams equalizer and a winner from Carlton Palmer gave the Owls the three points.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, it's more misery for Manchester City who lose 2-1 to Aston Villa at Villa Park. Tony Adams and Mark Blake score for Villa, while young Andy Turner scores his first City goal. QPR are off the mark, though: they beat Barnsley 2-0 with goals through Andy Impey and Bradley Allen. We suspect it will be a long season for both teams.\n\nRound 3 Table: Chelsea, Leeds 7; Sunderland, Tottenham, Coventry, Nottingham Forest 6\n\nEverton, Southampton, Millwall, Barnsley, QPR, Norwich 3; Man City 0\n\nIndeed! Chelsea's lack of progress has been frustrating for me to watch; they have way more talent than they have shown in the first couple of years. So far, so good, though!\n\n================================\n\nWith the preparations for Euro 96 in full swing, there is a revolving door of teams coming to play at Wembley over the next 12 months. In the summer of 1995 England will welcome Japan, Sweden and Brazil in the Umbro International Trophy. Additionally, throughout the year, there are planned home friendlies with Nigeria, Romania, and Uruguay, along with a trip to Lansdowne Road to take on the Irish. But first is a home-game against the USA.\n\nTerry Venables' squad for the USA game has a distinctly European flavor, containing several Italian-based players. The squad in full is:\n\nGoalkeepers: Tony Coton, Manchester City (1 cap); Nigel Martyn, Leeds (no caps)\n\nDefenders: Gavin Johnson, Manchester City (3 caps); John Scales, Wimbledon (1 cap); Terry Phelan, Manchester City (3 caps); Paul Lake, Roma (2 caps); Paul Parker, Manchester United (25 caps); Paul Warhurst, Sheffield Wednesday (2 caps); Des Walker, Sampdoria (53 caps); Gary Pallister, Lazio (15 caps, 1 goal)\n\nMidfielders: Chris Bart-Williams, Sheffield Wednesday (2 caps); Garry Parker, Aston Villa (no caps); Lee Sharpe, Manchester United (1 cap); Tony Dorigo, AC Milan (16 caps, 1 goal); David Platt, Sampdoria (38 caps, 15 goals); Nigel Clough, Nottingham Forest (17 caps, 2 goals); Paul Gascoigne, Lazio (31 caps, 5 goals); Fitzroy Simpson, Cologne (no caps)\n\nAttackers: Alan Shearer, Blackburn (9 caps, 3 goals); Les Ferdinand, Nottingham Forest (4 caps, 2 goals); Dalian Atkinson, Aston Villa (no caps); Mike Sheron, Manchester City (2 caps, 1 goal)\n\n***\n\nI know it's very early in the season but already the question needs to be asked: are Chelsea for real? They win again this week, and do so in fine form, beating Barnsley 3-1 at Oakwell. Charlie Hartfield, Scott Houghton and Craig Burley all score for Dave Webb's men. Marcus Ebdon got the lone goal for the hosts.\n\nLeeds' strong start to the season was derailed by terrible discipline in their game against Millwall at Elland Road. David Batty and Steve Hodge are both sent off for the hosts, and Darren Wilkinson and Owen Archdeacon capitalized with goals in a 2-0 Lions victory. Sunderland hit seven in their last game but still had room for one more in their trip to Blackburn—Jeff Kenna grabbed the goal while the defense kept a clean sheet in their 1-0 win.\n\nAt Anfield, Manchester United humiliated Liverpool in a day that will be long remembered. Steve Harkness saw red for the Reds while Gavin Peacock hit a hat-trick in a 3-0 United victory. Fergie's men are up to seven points, three points back of the leaders. Also on seven are Tottenham, who are held to a 0-0 draw by Southampton, Nottingham Forest, who are also held to a draw by QPR, and Sheffield Wednesday who beat Coventry 1-0 at Hillsborough.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Manchester City finally open their account with a 1-0 win over Wimbledon. Their tally of three points puts them level with Barnsley and Norwich who lose 1-0 at home to Everton. Don Goodman, Everton's third striker, proves he's no pushover, either, with the lone goal.\n\nRound 4 Table: Chelsea 10; Sunderland 9; Man Utd, Tottenham, Leeds, Nottm Forest, Sheff Wed 7\n\nBlackburn, Southampton, Liverpool, QPR 4; Man City, Barnsley, Norwich 3\n\nDuring the week, Tottenham are active in the transfer market, selling Gudni Bergsson to Coventry for 1.2 million. They replace him with Craig Fleming, picked up from Arsenal for 350k. Down in the Football League, you know that I always keep an eye out for former stars plying their trade at lower leagues – here's another one: former England international Clive Allen leaves West Ham to join Division Three club Wigan for 30k.\n\nRound 5\n\nPinch yourself, people, because otherwise you might not believe it: Sunderland are top of the Premier League. Terry Butcher's side, which have proven to be free-flowing and entertaining going forward, while surprisingly stingy at the back, rack up another big result in a 3-0 win over Barnsley. Lee Glover scores twice for Sunderland and Peter Davenport grabs the third in the win.\n\nSunderland claimed the top spot in the table at Chelsea's expense, after they were kept to a single point in their 1-1 draw at home against Leeds. Chelsea are one point back of Sunderland, while Leeds are part of a big group on eight points. In that pack are Manchester United who draw 0-0 against Norwich, Nottingham Forest who have the same result against Everton, Sheffield Wednesday, who draw 0-0 at Millwall, and Aston Villa, who win 1-0 at home against Southampton.\n\nElsewhere in the division, QPR picked up three big points in their game against fellow strugglers Derby. Gerry Francis's men jump to the top half of the table with seven points, while Derby are on five. Manchester City also pick up a point in their second straight game, thanks to a 0-0 draw at Coventry. They might be starting to turn the corner.\n\nRound 5 Table: Sunderland 12; Chelsea 11; Man Utd, Leeds, Nottm Forest, Aston Villa, Sheff Wed 8\n\nSouthampton, Man City, Norwich 4; Barnsley 3\n\nIn Division One, Ipswich and Burnley are the early pace-setters, each with 13 points from their first five games. Watford, Arsenal, Tranmere and Oxford are in the playoff spots. Down at the bottom, it's Newcastle and Southend occupying the two relegation places. With the re-jigging of the pyramid at the end of the year, only two teams will go down into Division Two.\n\nWith August coming to a close, Sunderland's Terry Butcher is deservedly named Manager of the Month. Aston Villa defender Earl Barrett is chosen as Player of the Month.\n\n***\n\nRound 6\n\nAt the start of the day, we were all wondering how Sunderland would be able to handle the pressure of being Premier League leaders. The answer is not very well. Terry Butcher knew there would be days like this in the first year in the top flight, but Aston Villa tear apart the leaders and grab goals from Steve Staunton, Mark Blake and Scot Gemmill in a 3-1 Villa win. That gave Chelsea the opportunity to go back to the top of the pile, but they were held to a 1-1 draw by Everton, and as a result, Chelsea and Sunderland now sit level on points.\n\nThere was a large group of teams four points back of Sunderland at the start of the day. One of those teams, Manchester United, travelled to The Den to take on Millwall. United took the lead through a Guy Whittingham goal but a double from Dean Holdsworth gave Mick McCarthy's side a famous 2-1 win. Up at Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday took on Leeds and Trevor Francis's side made a real statement in a 3-1 victory. Carlton Palmer, Chris Waddle and Chris Bart-Williams all score for the Owls, while Lee Jones replies for Leeds. Nottingham Forest seem to be righting their course, as well, beating Blackburn 2-1 at home: Mark Wright and Gary Crosby score for Forest in the win.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley fall 1-0 to Manchester City at Oakwell. England winger Scott Thomas scores the only goal and is sent off later in the game for Peter Reid's side. Norwich look impressive in a 3-1 win over Derby. Lee Power scores twice for the Canaries in the win. The win pulls Mike Walker's team out of the bottom three. Replacing them in the drop zone is Southampton who put in a good effort at Liverpool but fall 3-2. Russell Beardsmore, Paul Stewart and Scott Sellars all score for the Reds, while Perry Groves and Matt Le Tissier get goals in reply.\n\nElsewhere in the league, Paul Miller scores twice for Wimbledon in their 3-0 win over Coventry, and Tottenham split the points with QPR in a 1-1 draw.\n\nRound 6 Table: Sunderland, Chelsea 12; Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest 11\n\nBlackburn, Man City, Coventry, Norwich 7 / Derby 5; Southampton 4; Barnsley 3\n\nAlthough movement in the transfer market has been slow so far, heading in to the first international break, Sunderland break their club transfer record with the £1.2 million signing of Kingsley Black from Nottingham Forest. Forest replace Black with Paul Mortimer, signed from Crystal Palace for 650k.\n\n***\n\nEngland vs USA\n\nInternational Friendly\n\nWembley Stadium\n\nEngland: Tony Coton / Terry Phelan, Paul Parker, Gary Pallister, Gavin Johnson / Lee Sharpe, David Platt, Nigel Clough, Chris Bart-Williams / Alan Shearer (Dalian Atkinson 81), Les Ferdinand (Mike Sheron 81)\n\nUSA: Brad Friedel (Juergen Sommer 81); Jeff Agoos (Mike Lapper 70), Marcelo Balboa, Alexi Lalas, Paul Caliguri, Thomas Dooley, Mike Sorber, Claudio Reyna (Frank Klopas 81), Cobi Jones, Earnie Stewart (Joe-Max Moore 81), Hugo Perez (Eric Wynalda HT)\n\nHe might be struggling to do it consistently at club level but there's no doubt that Alan Shearer is turning into a legitimate goal threat at international level. A pair of centre-forward's goals from the Blackburn man: the first made by himself, the second finished clinically, were the difference in a 2-0 win for England.\n\nFor England fans, it must be a case of wondering what-if: the difference in quality between the Taylor and Venables era is marked, the home side playing with confidence and freedom since El Tel took over earlier this year. Sure, this wasn't the best of competition, but there will be an increased sense of optimism heading into the remainder of the year's friendlies.\n\nFinal Score: England 2 – 0 USA (Shearer 33, 40)\n\n***\n\nRound 7\n\nAfter a blazing start, it might be a dose of reality for Sunderland. They were second best by a clear distance against Manchester United at Old Trafford, and United should have won by more than a one-goal margin. The lone goal came from Darren Ferguson, given a rare start by his father in United's midfield.\n\nChelsea had no such problems this week. They come out against Coventry guns blazing, and get goals from Scott Houghton, Andy Townsend and Roy Wegerle in a 3-0 win at Highfield Road. Sheffield Wednesday keep pace with the leaders, staying one point back after they pick up a big 2-1 win over Manchester City at Maine road. Chris Waddle and Paul Bernard score for the Owls while Ian Brightwell grabs City's goal.\n\nWith Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa both being held to draws this week, Millwall jump out of the pack and up in to third place, following their 2-1 win at QPR. Equal with the Lions on points are Liverpool who beat Alan Shearer's Blackburn 1-0 thanks to a Don Hutchison goal. Shearer just hasn't produced consistently at the club level since signing for Rovers.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley lose again, going down 1-0 to Norwich. We picked Barnsley to go down before the season started and we're getting close to considering that a banker. The other two teams in the bottom three, Derby and Southampton played out a 1-1 draw at The Dell—Iain Dowie scored for the hosts while Martin Kuhl got Derby's goal.\n\nRound 7 Table: Chelsea 15; Sheff Wed 14; Millwall, Liverpool 13\n\nBlackburn, Man City, Coventry 7 / Derby 6; Southampton 5; Barnsley 3\n\nChelsea clearly have their tails up now and are looking at adding to their squad in hopes of strengthening their title chances. In comes Lee Sinnott, signed from Crystal Palace for 800k.\n\nMeanwhile, we say goodbye to one of my personal favourites, Carlton Fairweather. The 33-year-old striker leaves Millwall to join Division Two Crewe for 40k. Sadly, Fairweather didn't get the chance to feature for Mick McCarthy's side this year.\n\n***\n\nAlso midweek, we get this year's first dose of UEFA Cup action. This year's English representatives are Everton, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday. I will be diplomatic and say that English sides have found European competition \"challenging\" but three of the four teams have drawn favourable ties: United face Israeli side Qesari, Wednesday will face Svendborg of Denmark, and Forest play Veszprem of Hungary. Everton look to be in tough against Sporting Lisbon, though.\n\nTrue to form, Everton end up losing their first leg fixture 1-0 at home against the Portuguese. We expect their dismissal from Europe will be academic now. Sheffield Wednesday will be left ruing missed chances in their tie as it ends 0-0 against Svendborg at Hillsborough. With the match heading back to Denmark, both sides will consider themselves in with a shot.\n\nThe most disappointing effort comes in Hungary where Forest lose 1-0 at Veszprem. Brian Clough, who knows a thing or two about winning in Europe, was left furious as his team missed a bag full of chances and then got hit on the break. They'll still consider themselves in with a decent chance of winning the tie back in Nottingham.\n\nOne English representative has a very good chance of qualifying for the next round and that is Manchester United. United cruise to a 3-0 win at home over Qesari and will just have to avoid a big defeat in Israel to book their spot in the next round.\n\nRound 8\n\nA good omen for the Stamford Bridge faithful is that Chelsea are finding different ways to win every week. So it continued in their victory over Sunderland this round. The Blues got a brace from Roy Wegerle, who hasn’t contributed much in terms of goals so far this season, as well as a goal from his strike partner Graham Stuart in the 3-2 win. Sunderland benefited from a Frank Sinclair own goal, as well as one from Lee Glover in the loss. Jeff Kenna also saw red in the lost.\n\nSheffield Wednesday are another team that seems to have goals throughout the lineup. This week it is left-back Phil King who opens the scoring before a more usual suspect, Chris Bart-Williams, scores a second in their 2-0 win over Liverpool.\n\nMillwall remain tied for third after the weekend’s action through picking up a 1-1 draw against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Neil Ruddock scored first for Spurs, who were by far the better side, but a late equalizer by Etienne Verver keeps Mick McCarthy’s men in a great spot. As for Tottenham, they’ve been sliding down the table and now sit one point outside of the relegation spots.\n\nWith Liverpool losing and Millwall picking up a draw, Everton jump up into a third-place tie, following their 2-0 victory over Wimbledon. Tony Cottee scored his first goal since the opening weekend in the win and winger Stuart Ripley grabbed the second for the Toffees.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, it’s bad news for Barnsley. While every other team is picking up points with some degree of regularity, Barnsley are stuck on just three points and have already been cut adrift from the rest of the division. This weekend they lose a relegation six-pointer at Derby 1-0. Mark Pembridge scores his second goal of the season to pull the Rams out of the bottom three.\n\nThe team which started the day in 19th, Southampton also picked up three points, with a 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest. Perhaps Forest were suffering from a bit of a let-down after their foray in the UEFA Cup but they were never in this one – Neil Webb got sent off, Perry Groves got the goal and Southampton picked up a precious three points. They’re still in the drop zone, though. QPR is there with them, following their 2-0 loss at Coventry-Martin Carruthers has been a decent performer for Coventry since signing from Aston Villa last year. He scores his third of the season and Darren Rowbotham scores his second of the year in the win.\n\nRound 8: Chelsea 18; Sheff Wed 17; Everton, Millwall 14\n\nTottenham, Wimbledon, Leeds, Derby 9 / Southampton, QPR 8; Barnsley 3\n\n***\n\nMidweek, Leeds add a much-needed veteran midfielder, although we doubt this is the right choice of player. 31-year-old Australian midfielder, Vlado Bozinovski joins from Aston Villa for 150k. Bozinovski signed from Ipswich last year but never made an appearance for Ron Atkinson’s side. We’re not sure his time at Leeds will end up going much differently.\n\nThe midweek fixtures also allow us to welcome back the Coca-Cola Cup. Defending champions Manchester City beat Division Three side Rochdale in the first leg of their 2nd round tie. There are also wins for Derby, Sunderland, Barnsley, Leeds, Everton, Liverpool, Sheffield Wednesday, and Wimbledon. The potential upsets come at York City, where the Division Three club beats Aston Villa 2-1 in the first leg of their tie. You’d still make Villa the favourites, though. More noteworthy is Crystal Palace hammering Blackburn 4-1 at Selhurst Park, and Manchester United getting beat 1-0 by Division One Oxford at Old Trafford. We’ll see how the second leg of those ties play out.\n\nRound 9\n\nIt’s taken nine games, but Chelsea have finally been beaten. Dennis Wise sees red in a 1-0 loss to Wimbledon at Selhurst Park – Paul Miller, who is having a fine season for the Dons, scores the lone goal in the game. Unsurprisingly, Sheffield Wednesday aren’t able to take advantage – they are held to a 1-1 draw by Barnsley at Oakwell. That’s a huge result for Mel Machin’s side, who already look dead and buried. Barnsley’s goal came from Zimbabwean defender Brian Statham, while Chris Bart-Williams scored for the Owls.\n\nMillwall and Everton started the day tied for third, but the two teams played out a scoreless draw at The Den and that meant it was almost a certainty someone would jump over them in the standings. Sure enough, Everton’s crosstown rival, Liverpool, seized their opportunity when Don Hutchison scored the only goal in a 1-0 win over Derby. That result moves the Reds on to 16 points, alone in third, two points behind the leading duo. Manchester United and Nottingham Forest also both fight their way back into contention with 1-0 victories. United beats QPR at Loftus Road, Colin Hendry grabbing the goal, while Forest topple Manchester City at the City Ground, thanks to a Nigel Clough goal.\n\nNearer the bottom of the table Southampton escape the bottom three by beating Blackburn 3-2 at Ewood Park. Much of the Saints’ production this year has come from Matt Le Tissier, who currently leads the division in scoring, and Perry Groves. Both men score today, as does Alan Stubbs. Damian Matthew and Mike Newell score for Rovers in the loss. Blackburn are sitting on 10 points, in a crowd of teams just above the drop zone. Also in that mix are Leeds and Tottenham– both clubs played out 0-0 draws this week, with Norwich and Sunderland, respectively.\n\nRound 9 Table; Chelsea, Sheff Wed 18; Liverpool 16; Man Utd, Everton, Millwall, Nottm Forest 15\n\nTottenham, Blackburn, Leeds, Man City 10 / Derby 9; QPR 8; Barnsley 4\n\n***\n\nMidweek we head back to Europe and there were two UEFA Cup ties in which the results seemed to be locked up: Manchester United beating Qesari and Everton losing to Sporting Lisbon. Both ties went as expected – United beat their Israeli opponent 2-0 to win 5-0 on aggregate, while Sporting beat Everton 3-0 in Portugal to claim the tie 4-0 overall. In Nottingham, it’s anger and frustration for Forest fans after they are bounced by Hungarian outfit Vaszprom with a stoppage time equalizer that puts them through 2-1 on aggregate. Brian Clough’s men were by far the better side but that didn’t matter. Meanwhile, out in Denmark, Sheffield Wednesday suffer an equally embarrassing elimination at the hands of Danish side Svendborg. The Danes get a 1-0 win in the second leg to advance 1-0 on aggregate.\n\n😐 I hope that's a good thing!\n\nFull transparency: I just finished my second novel a couple of weeks ago and while the manuscript is with my editor, I have more capacity to peck away at \"fun\" writing. The draft is due back to me next week, so I'll probably be AWOL for a couple of weeks working on revisions.\n\nAiming for a late September release, so expect a bit of shameless self-promotion in this thread at some point. *ahem* Buy my first book. *ahem*\n\nAs you were.\n\n=========\n\nRound 10\n\nGenerally speaking, we start each session recap with what's happening at the top of the table, but we think the big story this week is what happened at the bottom of the table. There are two storylines here: first, we are going to go on record and say that Barnsley will be relegated this year. They're clearly a mile off the rest of the division. That prediction isn't based on their 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest, just an honest assessment of all of their performances to date. Four points from 10 games just isn't going to cut it.\n\nThe other major story is the champions Leeds dropping in to the bottom three. Yes, it's early, and yes, their squad had a lot of turnover in the summer, but the level of their struggles has been a major surprise. This time out, Leeds fall to Liverpool 1-0 at Elland Road with Steve Harkness getting the game's only goal.\n\nLeeds fall into the relegation zone because QPR pull out a stunning victory against league leaders Chelsea at Loftus Road. Chelsea were beaten for the first time last week and most skeptics would have been curious to see how they responded to their first bit of adversity. The answer is not well. Frank Sinclair, who has been one of the weak links in the Chelsea lineup this year, gets sent off, and goals from Danny Maddix, Andy Impey and Bradley Allen give the Rs a convincing 3-0 win.\n\nWith Chelsea losing, who would be able to take advantage of the slip up and take top spot? The obvious choice would have been Sheffield Wednesday who were tied with Chelsea at the top of the table, and in Chris Bart-Williams they have one of the league's star performers. Bart-Williams scores in Wednesday's game against Blackburn but goals from Mike Newell and Alan Shearer, his first of the year, give Kenny Dalglish's men a big three points. That meant it was Liverpool who snuck into the lead with 19 points, one point up on Wednesday and Chelsea. Everton join the group of teams one point back after they absolutely batter Manchester United at Old Trafford – Teddy Sheringham hits a hat trick and Don Goodman adds a fourth in a 4-1 victory. We can't help but wonder whether there will be any pressure on Alex Ferguson this year given United's inability to fulfill their potential.\n\nRound 10 Table: Liverpool 19; Everton, Chelsea, Sheff Wed, Nottm Forest 18\n\nQPR, Coventry, Norwich 11 / Leeds 10; Derby 9; Barnsley 4\n\nTop Scorers\n\n6 – Matt Le Tissier, Southampton\n\n5 – Teddy Sheringham, Everton\n\n4 – Gavin Peacock, Man Utd; Lee Power, Norwich; Scott Green, Sunderland\n\n3 – 8 players\n\nIn Division One, Ipswich continue to lead the way with 24 points from their opening ten games. They might be following the path Norwich is on this year; they were very poor in the Premier League last year but if they come back up they might come back stronger. Second place right now is Watford, who are on 19 points. Then in the playoff places you have Oxford and Charlton tied with 18, Sheffield United on 17, and four teams equal with 15: Oldham, Crystal Palace, Wolves and Burnley. In the relegation spots right now are Southend and Grimsby.\n\nTo wrap up September, Everton boss Howard Kendall is named Manager of the Month, while Sheffield Wednesday youngster Chris Bart-Williams is named Player of the Month.\n\n***\n\nFollowing the first leg of the Coca-Cola Cup 2nd Round ties, we flagged two matches in which there was the potential for an upset. The first was Aston Villa vs York, where the Division Three side won the first leg, and the second was Blackburn vs Crystal Palace, which looked like a done deal after Palace dominated the first leg. In the second leg, Palace play it smart and are able to contain Blackburn and secure their passage into the next round. 1-1 is the final on the night, 5-2 the Division One side wins on aggregate. At Villa Park, York's dreams of moving on to the next round are dashed when Villa get the 1-0 victory they needed to advance on away goals. Surprisingly, Oxford United are able to grab a 1-1 draw in their tie against Manchester United and secure their spot in the next round, winning 2-1 on aggregate. There are also wins for Arsenal over Barnsley, Ipswich over QPR and Fulham over Millwall.\n\nRound 11\n\nThe biggest tie of this round of fixtures took place when Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest, each one point back of the league leaders, met at Hillsborough. Both of these teams would have fancied themselves real contenders at the start of the year but if today's result is anything to go by then Wednesday are streets ahead of Brian Clough's men. The Owls are rampant and again it's Chris Bart-Williams who plays the role of catalyst. He scores one and sets up another in a 3-1 win. Last year's Young Player of the Year, this season is really Bart-Williams' coming out party and we can't help but wonder if a big money move to the continent awaits.\n\nLiverpool started the weekend as league leaders but as we have so many times over the past couple of years, as soon as someone gets their noses in front it all goes wrong. This time it's Norwich who play the role of spoilers, going to Anfield and grabbing an unlikely winner from an unlikely source: defender Ian Culverhouse. 1-0 to the Canaries is the final.\n\nEverton looked to capitalize on Liverpool's slip-up and again their high-powered offense made the difference. Teddy Sheringham has been the main man so far this year for Everton, and he is in the goals again today against QPR. Central midfield duo Billy Kenny and John Ebbrell each find the back of the net, as well, in a 3-2 win. One of the bright spots for QPR this year has been the play of Bradley Allen and he scores his fourth of the season in defeat. With QPR selling off their starting strike pairing of Les Ferdinand and Gary Penrice over the past year, they will need Allen to continue his good form if they are to secure survival in the Premiership.\n\nIn other action near the top of the table, Chelsea's wobble continues, and we wonder if they are now starting the process of reverting to their expected mean. They are outplayed by Aston Villa and fall behind to a Dean Saunders goal but claw back a draw thanks to an Andy Myers equalizer.\n\nDown at the bottom, the pack gets farther and farther away from Barnsley. They lose 1-0 to Leeds, who jump out of the bottom three with the victory. The Tykes are now six points adrift of 19th-place Derby following the Rams' 1-1 draw against Blackburn, and seven points off safety. QPR and Coventry sit equal on 11 points tied for 17th. Bobby Gould's team is another one that we pegged as likely to struggle this year and they're beaten 2-0 by Terry Butcher's Sunderland, who seem to be adapting to life in the Premier League quite well. Gordon Armstrong, who has been one of the Mackems' best players this year, is in the goals, as is Scott Green who grabs his fifth of the season.\n\nRound 11 Table: Everton, Sheff Wed 21; Chelsea, Liverpool 19\n\nQPR, Coventry 11; Derby 10; Barnsley 4\n\nUp next -- a stunning piece of news rocks the Premiership.\n\nQuote\n\nClough Says Goodbye – Managerial Legend's Retirement Stuns the Footballing World\n\nBrian Clough is a man who has never been lost for words but as he drove away from the City Ground yesterday, he could only manage to say one thing to the assembled crowd: \"Goodbye.\"\n\nWith Clough Senior not offering comment, it was his son Nigel who ended up talking to the BBC. \"I think age has caught up with him. 40 years in this business has taken its toll and over the past 18 months it has caught up. I just think he has run out of energy.\"\n\nNigel Clough would not comment on questions about his father's health, although sitting on the touchline in his final game against Sheffield Wednesday, Brian Clough's face looked reddened and blotchy, and there have been continued rumours about his heavy drinking which has damaged his relationship with the club's directors.\n\nHe leaves a Forest side that many pundits had picked to win the league this year, but there will be myriad questions about what Forest's future looks like.\n\nAs for Cloughie, surely this marks the end of a remarkable career which started at Hartlepools, then included First Division titles at Derby and Nottingham Forest, two European Cups, and an infamous 44-day stretch as Leeds United boss.\n\nBreaking down the fourth wall – This does represent the end of Brian Clough's career in our Premier League, as he is not in the CM2 database. His resignation in the game stunned me, because it doesn't really make any sense (although the CM1 engine is prone to strange happenings like this), so I felt like the only way to tell the story in a way that did make sense was to leverage some of the coverage from Clough's real-life retirement (including having Nigel Clough face reporters) and blame the burnout – the alcoholism was a bit of an elephant in the room. If you're curious, there's a really interesting retrospective of Clough's retirement located on the Daily Mail website (something I would normally suggest people visit). Back to the story...\n\n***\n\nWe're not sure when Forest would have found out about Brian Clough's decision to retire but it doesn't take long for the pundits to assemble a list of possible replacements. The bookies' favourite is Charlton Manager Alan Curbishley, while George Graham, Hull boss Terry Dolan and Kenny Hibbitt of Walsall are also mentioned as options.\n\nWhile most headlines focus on the happenings in Nottingham, in Leeds and Manchester people are thinking about European football. Leeds kick off their Champions League campaign with a tie against Yugoslavian side Red Star Belgrade. Meanwhile, in the Cup Winners' Cup, Manchester City face Aarhus. In Leeds, it's very much as you were – the game ends in a scoreless draw and you'd have to give Red Star the edge heading back to Yugoslavia. However, in Denmark, Manchester City put in a respectable performance and battle to a 2-2 draw. All things being equal, you'd consider City the more likely side to advance now.\n\nRound 12\n\nRon Fenton is in charge of Nottingham Forest as they take on Derby in the first game of the post-Clough era. The crowd at the City Ground was definitely subdued and perhaps the players of both sides were, too – the game ends in a 0-0 draw. Afterward, Fenton talked about the team needing to rally around each other and push onward if they wanted to claim the Premier League title. He had no news on the appointment of a permanent manager.\n\nAt the top of the table, Sheffield Wednesday are your new league leaders. Inspired by Chris Bart-Williams (who else), Trevor Francis's side get goals from the young winger and from Eddie Newton in a 2-1 win over Norwich. Everton, who started the day tied with Wednesday at the top of the table, slip back to second after they are held to a 1-1 draw by Aston Villa. Garry Parker scores for Villa before substitute Don Goodman pulls the Toffees level late on.\n\nChelsea are back to their winning ways after picking up a 2-1 victory over Millwall at Stamford Bridge. David Lee and Scott Houghton score for the Blues in the win, while Colin Cooper scores in defeat.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley pick up a rare point in a 0-0 draw at home against Liverpool. Because Derby grabbed a draw at Forest they're still six points back of 19th. 18th-place QPR also draw, finishing 1-1 at Sunderland. Goal Machine Scott Green finds the back of the net again for Terry Butcher's side, while Andy Impey scores for QPR. Coventry escape the bottom three for now by beating Manchester United 2-1. Peter Ndlovu opened the scoring and a Colin Hendry own goal was the difference. Alan Wright was sent off for the second time this season for United in the loss.\n\nElsewhere in the league, David White scores twice to give Manchester City a 2-0 win over Blackburn. That loss pulls Rovers back into the relegation dogfight.\n\nRound 12 Table: Sheffield Wednesday 24; Everton, Chelsea 22; Liverpool 20\n\nBlackburn, Norwich, Coventry 14 / QPR 12; Derby 11; Barnsley 5\n\n***\n\nWith the games coming thick and fast, we turn our attention to the Coca-Cola Cup Third Round. We might see a couple of lesser-light teams make a deep cup run this year, after Sheffield Wednesday, Chelsea and Everton have all been bounced from the competition. Defending champions Manchester City are still alive, though; they move into the fourth round after beating Bristol Rovers 3-1. They'll be joined by Aston Villa, Derby, Liverpool, Tottenham, Norwich and Wimbledon. Also, for those on the Clough replacement watch, you might be curious to know that Alan Curbishley's Charlton bounced Leeds from the Cup after beating them 2-1 at The Valley. We'll see whether that moves the odds on his appointment even closer in.\n\nWe close with Terry Venables' announcement of the England squad to face Romania and Nigeria in friendlies over the next month.\n\nGoalkeepers: Tony Coton, Manchester City (2 caps); Nigel Martyn, Leeds (no caps)\n\nDefenders: Gavin Johnson, Manchester City (4 caps); John Scales, Wimbledon (1 cap); Terry Phelan, Manchester City (4 caps); Paul Lake, Roma (2 caps); Paul Warhurst, Sheffield Wednesday (2 caps); Paul Parker, Manchester United (26 caps); Des Walker, Sampdoria (53 caps); Tony Adams, Aston Villa (25 caps)\n\nMidfielders: Chris Bart-Williams, Sheffield Wednesday (3 caps); Garry Parker, Aston Villa (no caps); Lee Sharpe, Manchester United (2 caps); Kevin Watson, Tottenham (8 caps, 1 goal); Nigel Clough, Nottingham Forest (18 caps, 2 goals); David Platt, Sampdoria (39 caps, 15 goals); Fitzroy Simpson, Cologne (no caps); David Batty, Leeds (12 caps)\n\nAttackers: Alan Shearer, Blackburn (10 caps, 5 goals); Dalian Atkinson, Aston Villa (1 cap); David Hirst, Genoa (13 caps, 6 goals); Mike Sheron, Manchester City (3 caps, 1 goal)\n\nHeading into the international break and the news breaks over the wires that Glenn Hoddle has been sacked as manager by Swindon Town. It was Hoddle’s first managerial role, and during his time at Town, he saw the team relegated from Division One and now sitting just above the relegation zone in Division Two. Hoddle becomes the latest in a long, long line of great players who just weren’t able to find the same level of success as a manager although we have no doubt he’ll resurface at some point.\n\nIn other managerial news, Nottingham Forest have found their man to replace the now retired Brian Clough: George Graham makes his return to the Premier League and takes over a team from which much is expected. Of course, Graham had a lot of success during his time at Highbury but it all went wrong in the end and finished with a relegation. Forest will be hoping that history doesn’t quite repeat itself. Charlton fans everywhere breath a sigh of relief with the news.\n\n***\n\nEngland vs Romania\n\nInternational Friendly\n\nWembley Stadium\n\nEngland: Tony Coton; Gavin Johnson (Paul Lake 58), Terry Phelan, Tony Adams ©, Paul Warhurst; Lee Sharpe, Nigel Clough, David Platt, Chris Bart-Williams (Garry Parker 71); Alan Shearer, Dalian Atkinson (David Hirst 71)\n\nRomania: Bogdan Stelea (Florin Prunea 87); Dan Petrescu, Daniel Prodan, Miodrag Belodedici, Ioan Lupescu, Gheorghe Popescu, Marius Lacatus (Florin Carstea), Ilie Dumitrescu, Florin Raducioiu (Daniel Timofte 77), Gheorghe Hagi © (Tibor Selymes HT), Dorniel Munteanu\n\nEngland’s supporters saw first hand how much farther they will need to progress if they are to be legitimate contenders at the European Championships in the summer of 96. Romania, World Cup quarter finalists in the past summer, showed themselves to be a class above and left England playing without confidence.\n\nStriker Ilie Dumitrescu, who has caught the eye of several Premiership clubs, will have done his chances of a big-money move no harm when he scored a fine opener on 36 minutes. An overmatched England fought back and got an equalizer through young Chris Bart-Williams just before half-time. Sheffield Wednesday youngster Bart-Williams has caught the eye with his performances at club level over the past two seasons and looks to be on the verge of becoming an England regular.\n\nAlthough being outplayed, England had the best chance of winning it in the second half when Shearer could have done better from close range, but his scuffed shot hit a defender’s leg and bounced harmlessly wide. Onward, then: Up next is a friendly with African side Nigeria in four weeks’ time.\n\nFinal Score: England 1-1 Romania (Bart-Williams 45’; Dumitrescu 36’)\n\n***\n\nRound 13\n\nWe start off the weekly recap by highlighting Chris Bart-Williams, who just can’t stop scoring goals for club or country. He finds the net for the sixth straight Premier League game, a new competition record, in Sheffield Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Derby County. The win keeps Trevor Francis’s team at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nAnd what price could you have received for Sunderland’s Scott Green to be the Premier League Golden Boot winner? You probably would have been able to name your price, given his previous high goal tally was six, and that was when he was playing in Division Three back in 1990. He remarkably becomes the first man in Premier League history to score multiple hat-tricks. He hit four past Norwich earlier in the year and grabs another three against Everton at Goodison Park. That takes him up to nine league goals for the year, three more than Le Tissier, Sheringham and Bart-Williams.\n\nChelsea come back from the international break well with a 1-0 win over Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Scott Houghton has been Chelsea’s best player so far this year and he hits the only goal of the game in the win. Dave Webb’s men continue to sit two points back of the leaders. Fourth-placed Liverpool are turned over at home by Manchester City, thanks to a David White brace. City’s win brings them up to 20 points, level with Liverpool, Sunderland, Aston Villa, who drew 1-1 with QPR, and Wimbledon, who also drew 1-1 against Manchester United.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley are easily beaten by Southampton, 2-0, and they remain nine points off safety. Coventry are easily turned over by Millwall, 4-2, who benefited from a Dean Holdsworth hat trick, and Blackburn remain tied for 17th after losing 2-1 to Leeds. Norwich who were level on points with Coventry and Blackburn heading in to play beat Nottingham Forest in George Graham’s first game in charge as boss. Ex-Forest man Darren Wassall scores the lone goal in the win.\n\nRound 13 Table: Sheff Wed 27; Chelsea 25; Everton 22; Sunderland, Wimbledon, Aston Villa, Man City, Liverpool 20\n\nBlackburn, Coventry 14 / QPR 13; Derby 11; Barnsley 5\n\n***\n\nIn the transfer market, Sunderland are active on both the buy and sell side. They bring in defender Lee Martin from Manchester United for 590k, while heading out of Roker Park is veteran midfielder Steve McMahon, who moves to Millwall for 60k. Also on the move during the week is Lawrie Sanchez, who leaves Wimbledon after 11 years to join Division Two Bristol Rovers, and Alan Pardew, whose time at Swansea ends with a 20k move to Brentford.\n\nAlso midweek we head back to Europe, and witness the end of Leeds’ run in the Champions League. It isn’t much of a surprise to see them go down 1-0 to Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia. However, Manchester City’s time in the Cup Winners Cup will go on – they beat Aarhus 3-1 at Maine Road to take their tie 5-3. They draw a favourable match up with Cypriot side Onomia in the next round of the competition.\n\nRound 14\n\nEverything seems to be coming along nicely for Sheffield Wednesday these days. Top of the Premiership, a star player who is barely 21 years old and tearing up the league, and now winners of four on the bounce. Chris Bart-Williams' goalscoring streak ends at six games, but Chris Waddle grabs a first and substitute Peter Ward claims his first Premier League goal to give Wednesday a 2-0 victory over QPR.\n\nThe gap between first and second widens slightly to four points after Chelsea drop points in their 1-1 draw against Southampton. American striker Roy Wegerle scores for the Blues while Matt Le Tissier continues his great year by scoring for Ian Branfoot's side in the draw. Manchester City have flown under the radar since their abysmal start to the year but they're suddenly up to third in the league after beating Everton 2-1 at Maine Road. Defender Michael Vonk and young striker Mike Sheron score for City, while Teddy Sheringham grabs Everton's goal. Joining City in third place is Liverpool, who beat Sunderland 2-1 at Roker Park. Midfielder Gordon Armstrong grabbed the goal for Terry Butcher's men while Martin Keown and Scott Sellars score for the Reds.\n\nDown at the bottom of the table, the big game comes between Derby and Coventry. If Coventry were to win this, they would go a long way to relegating the Rams, and sure enough, Bobby Gould's side do get a 1-0 win at Highfield Road. Frustrating Rams fans will be that the goal they conceded was an own goal, last touched by Jason Kavanagh. That pulls the Sky Blues six points ahead of Derby and four points ahead of QPR who are in 18th. Barnsley remain well back, they're now 11 points off of safety, although they pick up a point in their 0-0 draw at home against Millwall. Mel Machin has built a lot of equity through getting Barnsley promoted and then keeping them up in their first season in the top flight, but the club directors might start getting an itchy trigger finger soon.\n\nA quick note about parity – even now, nearly halfway in to the season, just six points separate the teams in third from the teams in 17th. Don't count anyone out yet… (except Barnsley).\n\nRound 14 Table: Sheffield Wednesday 30; Chelsea 26; Manchester City, Liverpool 23\n\nTottenham, Blackburn, Coventry 17 / QPR 13; Derby 11; Barnsley 6\n\n***\n\nRound 15\n\nLast round we observed how well everything seemed to be going for Sheffield Wednesday. Naturally, that was the cue for their winning streak to end – Southampton run out 2-1 winners at The Dell, beating Wednesday thanks to goals from Alan Stubbs and Simon Ireland. Phil King scores for Wednesday in the defeat.\n\nChelsea are able to close the gap to just one point after they squash Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Blues get goals from Charlie Hartfield, Roy Wegerle and Robert Fleck, while Lee Sharpe sees red in the loss. At what point do Manchester United fans start to get fed up with the types of performances they've been seeing from their team over the past three years? United are now in the bottom half, just two points above 17th.\n\nLiverpool started the weekend tied for third place with Manchester City but The Reds end the round alone in third after they play to a 2-2 draw at home against George Graham's Nottingham Forest (still getting used to writing that – ed.) Liverpool grab goals from Michael Thomas and Don Hutchison, while Robert Rosario scores twice for Forest. It is interesting to note that Les Ferdinand has fallen out of favour at Forest, being pulled from the starting lineup since Graham came into charge. We'll monitor that situation, as he is rumoured to be considering submitting a transfer request if he is not getting first-team football.\n\nFor Manchester City, as you may have gleamed, they ended up getting beat this week, falling 2-0 to Norwich at Carrow Road. Daryl Sutch and Ian Crook score for Mike Walker's side, who pull level with City following the victory. Also on 23, tied for fourth, is Wimbledon who beat QPR 1-0 at Loftus Road thanks to a Nigel Jemson goal, and Leeds who draw 0-0 at Derby.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley pick up their second straight draw with a 2-2 result against Blackburn at Ewood Park. As much as Barnsley have struggled picking up points, they've also had challenges just finding the net, so this is a big step. Defender Michael Johnson and forward Andy Liddell score for the Tykes, while Eddie McGoldrick and Mike Newell get Blackburn's goals.\n\nHeading into the round, Coventry were in 17th place, four points up on 18th-place QPR. However, Bobby Gould's team picks up a huge 2-0 win at Goodison Park and in doing so, jump several spots in the league table. Peter Ndlovu scores a brace in the win.\n\nElsewhere in the division, Steve McMahon marks his Millwall debut with a goal in The Lions' 2-0 victory over Sunderland.\n\nRound 15 Table: Sheffield Wednesday 30; Chelsea 29; Liverpool 24; Wimbledon, Man City, Leeds, Norwich 23\n\nTottenham, Blackburn 18; QPR 13; Derby 12; Barnsley 7\n\nIn Division One, it continues to be Ipswich at the front of the pack. They've picked up 30 points from their first 15 games and have a five-point cushion on Sheffield United and Oxford. Watford, Crystal Palace and Leicester round out the top six. At the bottom of the table, West Ham and Grimsby are in the two relegation spots. Southend, who started the year so poorly, sit one point above from the drop zone, but are starting to string together results.\n\n***\n\nWith West Ham facing relegation to Division Two in the face, the club directors at Upton Park swing the axe and fire Billy Bonds. First-team coach Harry Redknapp, who couldn't help but tell the media he thinks the club is full of t'rrifc players, is the favourite to take the reins full-time.\n\nWe end the month of October with the announcement that Peter Reid wins Manager of the Month for an unrivalled 10th time. Chris Bart-Williams is an obvious choice as Player of the Month for the second month in a row.\n\nRound 16\n\nOkay, maybe we wrote off Barnsley a bit too soon. The Tykes pick up their third straight draw with a 1-1 result at Oakwell against Manchester United. We still have concerns about Barnsley's goalscoring possibilities, but they get a marker from Andy Rammell to take a first half lead before United's main man up front, Gavin Peacock, scores the equalizer. We've already seen Arsenal go down to Division One – is Manchester United the next one of the Big Five to go? They're now tied for 17th place, although there is a bit of a buffer to the bottom three.\n\nUp at the top, Sheffield Wednesday grab a 1-1 draw at Hillsborough against an Everton side that's now going backward. Chris Bart-Williams is back in the goals, and so is Teddy Sheringham for the Toffees. The lead that was down to one point after the last round of games is back up to two points after Chelsea are beaten by third-place Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. We didn't have high expectations for the Reds at the start of the year but they've proven us wrong and are real contenders. Graeme Souness's side get goals from influential midfielder Russell Beardsmore and Paul Stewart, while Scott Houghton scores in defeat. Liverpool are four points behind the leaders.\n\nThere was a four-way tie for fourth heading into action, with Wimbledon, Manchester City, Leeds and Norwich all level. Four became two after Leeds beat QPR 2-1 and Norwich beat Aston Villa 1-0. On the other side of the coin, Manchester City and Wimbledon were both dealt 3-0 defeats—City losing to Millwall and Wimbledon being beat by Blackburn.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Derby continue to limp along—they are another team beaten 3-0, losing to Sunderland at Roker Park. Terry Butcher's men, who are by far the highest scoring outfit in the division, get goals from Gordon Armstrong, Lee Glover and David Rush in the win. Just outside the drop zone, Tottenham get a rare double from winger Paul Allen as they beat Nottingham Forest 2-0. The win sees Spurs leapfrog ahead of Forest and Manchester United in the table. It's a long way back to the bottom three, though.\n\nRound 16 Table: Sheffield Wednesday 31; Chelsea 29; Liverpool 27; Leeds, Norwich 26\n\nManchester United, Nottingham Forest 20 / QPR 13; Derby 12; Barnsley 8\n\n***\n\nMidweek and it's Manchester United flying the flag as England's last contender in European football. They travel to Sweden and put in a strong performance in the first leg of their UEFA Cup tie beating AIK Stockholm 1-0.\n\nIn the transfer market, the league leaders are active, selling Micky Adams to Division One Newcastle for 60k. Adams hasn't played all year so it's not a major loss for Sheffield Wednesday. Down in London, David Preece swaps locker rooms at Selhurst Park moving from Wimbledon to Crystal Palace for 250k.\n\nRound 17\n\nBarnsley win, Barnsley win! Their sudden reversal in form sees a team that we considered dead and buried now unbeaten in four and within nine points of avoiding the drop. Their victim is Wimbledon, who are beaten 2-1 at Oakwell. Both goals come from central defenders – Charlie Bishop and Phil Gridelet score for Mel Machin's men.\n\nTwo points ahead of Barnsley are QPR and Derby, who are both level on 13 points. Derby pick up a single point through a scoreless draw with Millwall at the Baseball Ground while QPR are beaten 2-0 by Norwich at Carrow Road. Jason Minett scores his first professional goal in the win and John McGinlay chips in a second for Mike Walker's men who are remarkably still in the top five in the league.\n\nWith an England friendly on tap for next week, Dalian Atkinson was looking to impress Terry Venables and earn a spot in the starting lineup against Nigeria. He did himself no harm by scoring the game's only goal in Aston Villa's 1-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. That result, combined with Chelsea's 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground, means that the Blues are back at the top of the league. It's amazing to me that Dave Webb has not been recognized for what his team has done so far this year.\n\nLiverpool and Leeds keep pace with Chelsea after they both win 1-0. Leeds beat a Coventry team which was in a rich vein of form thanks to a David Batty goal, while at Anfield Torben Piechnik scores Liverpool's winner over Tottenham.\n\nRound 17 Table: Chelsea 32; Sheffield Wednesday 31; Liverpool 30; Leeds, Norwich 29\n\nNottingham Forest 20 / QPR, Derby 13; Barnsley 11\n\nHeading into the international break, there is a bit of transfer activity as Tottenham bring in utility man Mark Atkins from Blackburn for 950k. Atkins can play on both sides of the pitch and is equally comfortable in defense and midfield, so we like this signing. Also heading to London is Australian goalkeeper Jason Kearton, who leaves Everton to join Millwall for 600k. The last transfer deal of the week is former Coventry captain Brian Borrows leaving the Sky Blues to join Division Two Bournemouth for 50k.\n\n***\n\nEngland vs Nigeria\n\nInternational Friendly\n\nWembley Stadium\n\nEngland: Nigel Martyn; Gavin Johnson, Terry Phelan, Des Walker, Paul Parker; Lee Sharpe, Chris Bart-Williams (Nigel Clough 25), David Platt ©, Garry Parker; Alan Shearer (David Hirst 78), Dalian Atkinson (Mike Sheron 78)\n\nNigeria: Peter Rufai, Augustine Eguavoen, Benedict Iroha, Mutiu Adeoju (Nwankwo Kanu 85), Uche Okechuwku, Uche Okafor, Finidi George, Daniel Amokachi (Victor Ikpeba 60), Rashidi Yekini (Efan Ekoku 60), Jay-Jay Okocha, Emmanuel Amunike\n\nA veteran backline and some midfield steel from captain David Platt gave England a 1-0 win over Nigeria at Wembley Stadium. England boss Terry Venables used the opportunity to hand Leeds keeper Nigel Martyn his first ever cap in goal but protected him with an experienced pairing of Des Walker and Paul Parker in defense.\n\nSheffield Wednesday fans will be holding their breath tonight after Chris Bart-Williams, who started the game in the centre of midfield rather than on the wing, hobbled off after only 25 minutes with a muscle strain. The word from the England camp was that he should be fine to rejoin his club side within a week. England took the lead in the 41st minute when captain David Platt found the back of the net.\n\nUp front, Shearer and Atkinson were ineffective and their replacements, Hirst and Sheron, didn't get enough time to really make an impact. This performance won't lessen the cries for an alternative option up front, such as Everton's Teddy Sheringham, Southampton's Matt Le Tissier or even Manchester United's Gavin Peacock.\n\nEngland end the year unbeaten in six, next up is the Irish at Lansdowne Road in February.\n\nOf course! The Ossie Ardiles-led Baggies are currently in 6th place in Division Two. With the expansion of the Football League pyramid at the end of the year, that would be good enough to claim the last promotion spot into Division One. The star man at The Hawthorns so far this year has been Czech goalkeeper, Pavel Srnicek. Midfielder Jason Watkins, signed from Plymouth last year, leads the team with 4 goals so far. Considering my memories of Ardiles’ teams is that they couldn’t defend and only attack, they’ll need to upgrade their attack to ensure promotion.\n\n=========================\n\nManchester United knew they held the upper hand in the second leg of their UEFA Cup tie against AIK Stockholm. A draw would be sufficient to ensure their passage to the next round. At half-time at Old Trafford, fans were not overly impressed with the quality of the game they were observing but they knew the 0-0 scoreline would have been job done. In the second half, it became a bit more comfortable as Lee Sharpe scored for United. In truth, AIK offered little and United cruised into the next round. Up next is a tie against Estoril of Portugal.\n\nRound 18\n\nChelsea will lead the pack at the half-way point of the Premier League after they pick up a 2-0 win over Norwich at Stamford Bridge. The Blues now have a four-point advantage over Sheffield Wednesday who were beaten 2-1 by Sunderland at Roker Park. I don’t need to remind you that the team which was leading the division at the half-way point last year ended up completely imploding and finishing the season in 13th place. Chelsea fans will be looking for something better.\n\nTied for third place are Leeds, who managed a 1-1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford, and Liverpool, who were beaten 3-1 by Millwall at The Den.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, it has not been an easy transition into the George Graham era for Nottingham Forest; they lose 2-0 to Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. Neal Ardley and Ian Olney get the goals for Joe Kinnear’s men. Forest’s lead over the bottom three is cut to just four points now, after Derby picked up a big win over Everton at Goodison Park. Marco Gabbiadini’s first goal of the year was the difference in the 1-0 win. QPR and Barnsley both inch one point closer to survival, as well, as bot teams picked up draws during the week. QPR drew 2-2 at home against Southampton, with Simon Barker and Andy Sinton scoring for Rangers, and Barnsley’s run of form continues with a 1-1 draw at Villa Park. Scot Gemmill scored for Villa, while Andy Rammell scored Barnsley’s equalizer. Mel Machin’s men are now unbeaten in five and there is a sense of belief around Oakwell that Barnsley just might be able to survive. We’ll see.\n\nRound 18 Table: Chelsea 35; Sheff Wed 31; Leeds 30; Liverpool 30\n\nNottingham Forest 20 / Derby 16; QPR 14; Barnsley 12\n\n***\n\nNeal Ardley scored a goal for Wimbledon at the weekend in their 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest. That turned out to be his last game in a Dons uniform as he’s sold to Liverpool for 450k during the week. It’s not the only deal of the week as Southampton bring in David Whyte (not to be confused with Manchester City’s David White) from Crystal Palace for 600k. It seems like a big fee to pay for a 23-year-old striker with just five senior goals to his name and no goals from five appearances for Palace this season.\n\nAlso in Division One, promotion contenders Sheffield United sign Arsenal’s Scottish winger Pat Nevin for 150k. Lastly, former England international and AC Milan legend Luther Blissett is on the move again. He leaves Division Three Wigan to join up with Division One side Tranmere on a free transfer. Blissett managed four appearances for Wigan, and this is probably the last move of his notable career.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Cup will have a new winner in 1995 after last season’s winner, Manchester City, are bounced on penalties by Division Two side Bournemouth. The Cherries will face Norwich in the Quarter-Finals after the Canaries beat their main rivals Ipswich Town in the Fourth Round. Also in the Quarter-Finals, Derby will face Portsmouth, Tottenham will face Watford, and in the only all-Premier League tie, Wimbledon will take on Aston Villa at Selhurst Park.\n\n***\n\nAs we near the half-way point of the season, transfer business is beginning to pick up and there’s a huge move in Division One when Crystal Palace pay more than four times their previous transfer record fee to bring in Darren Anderton from Tottenham. Palace are second in the table right now and see Sick Note as the man who can help ensure there are two Selhurst Park teams playing in the Premier League next year. Also on the move from White Hart Lane is midfielder Andy Gray, who joins Manchester City for 180k. Gray had made ten appearances for Doug Livermore’s side during the year so it’s somewhat surprising they would sell him for such a low price.\n\nAston Villa also sell two players during the week: Sunderland pay 190k to sign right-back Dariusz Kubicki, while Leeds bring in veteran Irish defender Paul McGrath for 50k. Both men were surplus to requirements at Villa Park but I don’t see either one getting much of a look-in at their new clubs, either.\n\nIt’s monthly awards time again and the managerial honour stays in Manchester but this time it’s the red side of the city which is being recognized. Alex Ferguson wins his second Manager of the Month award, while Sunderland midfielder Gordon Armstrong is named Player of the Month. Armstrong is probably the least recognizable name to be given the honour since the inception of the Premier League, but he has been a dynamo in the centre of Sunderland’s midfield this year.\n\n***\n\nRound 19\n\nThe season reaches the half-way marker and Chelsea wrap up their first half of the year in fine style. With a four-point lead on the division heading in to the day’s action, it was already assured that the Blues would be the leaders at the mid-way point, but they turn on the class in a 3-1 win over Derby at Stamford Bridge. Scottish midfielder Craig Burley is the star of the day scoring twice, while Scott Houghton, who has been Chelsea’s most consistent performer, grabs the third. Irish international Liam O’Brien scores his second of the year for Derby in the defeat. For the Rams, they end the first half of the season in 18th place, five points from safety.\n\nSheffield Wednesday continue in second place, despite being held to a 1-1 draw by Wimbledon. Paul Warhurst has been a bit of a forgotten man this year, primarily playing in central defense rather than up front which is where he spent most of the last three years. He chips in with his second goal of the year for Wednesday, while Ian Olney scores for Wimbledon. Leeds are third at the half-way point after drawing with Sunderland 0-0 at Roker Park. That moves the champions one point up on Liverpool, who lose 2-1 at Everton, and Norwich, who pick up a scoreless draw at Coventry.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Barnsley are beaten by Tottenham 1-0 to remain at the bottom of the table. QPR remain in 19th even though they pick up a point in their draw at home against Manchester City. Just above the line is Nottingham Forest who are still finding their feet under George Graham. Forest end up playing Aston Villa to a scoreless draw this week.\n\nRound 19 Table: 1) Chelsea – 38; 2) Sheff Wed – 32; 3) Leeds – 31; 4) Liverpool – 30; 5) Norwich – 30; 6) Millwall – 29; 7) Manchester City – 28; 8) Sunderland – 27; 9) Southampton – 27; 10) Everton – 27; 11) Wimbledon – 27; 12) Coventry – 27; 13) Aston Villa – 26; 14) Tottenham - 25; 15) Manchester United – 25; 16) Blackburn – 22; 17) Nottingham Forest – 21 / 18) Derby – 16; 19) QPR – 15; 20) Barnsley 12\n\nTop Goalscorers\n\n10 – Teddy Sheringham, Everton\n\n9 – Gavin Peacock, Manchester United; Scott Green, Sunderland\n\n8 – Chris Bart-Williams, Sheffield Wednesday\n\n7 – Dean Holdsworth, Millwall; Gordon Armstrong, Sunderland; Matt Le Tissier, Southampton\n\n6 – David White, Manchester City; Dean Saunders, Aston Villa; Ian Olney, Wimbledon; Scott Houghton – Chelsea; Peter Ndlovu, Coventry\n\nIn Division One, Ipswich continue to lead the pack. John Lyall's men moved to the top of the table after the fourth round of fixtures and haven’t been knocked off top spot since. However, lurking just one point behind is a Crystal Palace side which has just splashed the cash to help their promotion chances. In the playoff spots are Sheffield United, Leicester, Watford and Charlton. At the bottom, the two relegation places are filled by Wolves and Grimsby.\n\nWhat will our last few months in the CM1 world bring us?\n\nUp next: Our mid-year report cards & some second half predictions\n\nMid-Year Report Cards\n\nAt the half-way point of every season we look back at what has happened so far in the year through a club-by-club review, then cast our eyes forward to make some fearless predictions as to what’s to come in the second half of the season.\n\nLast year we accurately predicted Leeds would come from behind to emerge Premier League winners after a spectacular collapse by Tottenham. That won’t happen this time out. Given our preseason title pick now sits in 17th, we’ll consider picking Forest our mulligan and make a revised pick for the title – Chelsea have been the surprise package of the year, leading most of the way. Can they claim their first Premier League title? And what about the three promoted teams who have all been excellent?\n\nAt the bottom of the table, Derby, QPR and Barnsley have been off the pace almost since day one – is there any way back for them?\n\nBefore we begin our review, we feel the need to highlight that between 2nd and 17th, league position is almost irrelevant – the 16 clubs are separated by just 11 points with far too much parity to read too much into anything.\n\n20th – Barnsley\n\nHalfway Grade: 2.5 out of 10. Even by low standards, this has been a horrible first half. Have been showing some signs of life lately, though.\n\nWhat we said: \"18th. Look destined to be in tough again this year. With Norwich looking very likely to stay up, they’ll ne"
