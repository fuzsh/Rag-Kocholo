        "text": "Birmingham City have been relegated to League One.\n\nThe Blues will play in the third tier of English football for the first time in 29 years.\n\nA 1-0 victory at home to Norwich on the final day of the Championship season was not enough as Plymouth, Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn won to secure safety.\n\nThe damage at St Andrew's was done earlier in the season during a disastrous 15-game spell under Wayne Rooney.\n\nBirmingham were sixth when Rooney replaced John Eustace in October.\n\nThe England legend failed to win 13 of his 15 games in charge and the club dropped 14 places in the league before he was sacked.\n\nAfter their relegation was confirmed, football fans - including talkSPORT's Gabby Agbonlahor - all said the same thing about the decision to hire Rooney.\n\n\"Sacking John Eustace and bringing in Wayne Rooney has to be one of the worst decisions a club has ever made,\" one supporter wrote on social media.\n\nAnother said: \"The decision from Birmingham City to sack John Eustace and replace him with Wayne Rooney is one of the worst in football history.\"\n\nHuddersfield joined Birmingham and Rotherham in the confirmed relegation zone with a 2-0 defeat at Ipswich, who were promoted to the Premier League.\n\nBirmingham needed any of Plymouth, Sheffield Wednesday or Blackburn to lose in order to stay up - but all three relegation rivals won.\n\nIt caps a disastrous year under their new American ownership group, which includes NFL legend Tom Brady.\n\nRooney's replacement, Tony Mowbray, was placed on medical leave in February after a month in charge.\n\nGary Rowett took the reins on an interim basis in March, but could not get the Blues over the line despite reaching 50 points.\n\nFormer Aston Villa captain Agbonlahor couldn't resist sticking the knife in and was practically giddy when he join Jamie O'Hara on air for the Full-Time Phone-In shortly after the Blues' relegation was confirmed.\n\nHe even popped open a bottle of champagne as he revelled in his old rival club's drop.\n\n“It’s a great day… Birmingham City relegated to the third tier,\" he said. \"Third tier sounds worse than League One!\n\n“Could it be the biggest blunder by an owner ever sacking John Eustace? October 9 they sacked him, they were sixth in the league - sixth place!\n\n“They’d just beaten West Brom 3-1 but he was sacked, all because they’d spoken to Rooney and wanted a big name, they’re thinking about sponsorships and they’ve looked at what other clubs have done - but it backfired, badly.\n\n“They didn’t even give Rooney a transfer window to make any changes. Three days into a transfer window you sack Rooney, and then it’s unfortunate with Tony Mowbray who had medical issues and then Gary Rowett came in, but by then it’s too late.\n\n“When you’re making silly decisions like they did with Eustace, who - funnily enough - kept Blackburn up today. He put out a team to beat Leicester 2-0 and he’s kept them up.\n\n“I bet he’s laughing, ‘Look at those jokers who sacked me, look at them now’.”\n\nEustace did no such thing, though, with the Rovers boss issuing a classy response to his former club's relegation when asked by talkSPORT.\n\n“My job is to come in and make sure Blackburn Rovers stayed in the league, that's all I was worried about,” Eustace said.\n\n“Listen, I didn’t want Birmingham to go down, it’s a club very close to my heart and I’ve got some fantastic friends there and they have some fantastic players there as well.\n\n“It’s a shame they’ve gone down, but all I was focussed on is keeping Birmingham in the league, sorry, Blackburn in the league.”\n\nMeanwhile, interim boss Rowett praised the fans for the electric atmosphere on the final day that helped them do all they could. But it proved not to be enough.\n\nSpeaking after the final game of the campaign, Rowett said: “It’s incredibly disappointing. I felt that if we kept our side of the bargain today we would get a result elsewhere that went in our favour, and most people would have expected something to have happened.\n\n\"You look at these last day moments, or last day goals, and it didn’t seem like there was anything going on out there. Congratulations to the teams that held their nerve. I’m sure when they heard about our goal it added pressure.\n\n“The atmosphere in the stadium was probably the best I’ve ever heard before a game, it was absolutely electric. As we knew they would, the fans more than played their part.\n\n\"I thought we played well against a very good Norwich side but when you know that’s not enough, of course there’s a feeling of dejection. Sometimes when you put a performance like that in because you have to and you need to, what really good teams do is they do it when they don’t need to. They show that same level of attitude when they don’t need to.”"
