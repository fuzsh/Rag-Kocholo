        "text": "In the third tier for the first time in over 30 years, a wave of optimism has hit the Blues as new American ownership has ploughed enthusiasm and cash into the side.\n\nDespite suffering relegation last season, the club have sold over 18,000 season tickets for the first time in over a decade and there is set to be almost 30,000 in attendance on Saturday as Reading travel to St Andrew's.\n\nNamed St Andrew's @ Knighthead Park after sponsorship, its official capacity is down as 29,409.\n\nThe Royals were given an allocation of little over 2,200, with approximately 1,600 snapped up by Tuesday lunchtime.\n\nAveraging over 21,000 last season in the Championship, over 27,000 turned out for their final day showdown with Norwich City, which officially saw Gary Rowett's side succumb to relegation.\n\nFebruary 2023, a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, was the last time Reading played in front of a crowd larger than 27,000, with over 38,000 at the Stadium of Light that day.\n\nLast season, Bolton Wanderers' Bank Holiday crowd of 25,266 was the largest Ruben Selles' side came up against, while 18,480 was the largest home attendance for a Reading game.\n\nOn their last visit to St Andrew's in 2022, the Royals lost 3-2 under Paul Ince."
