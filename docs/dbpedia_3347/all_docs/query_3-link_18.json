        "text": "AT COLORADO: This Season (Sr.)?He played in 11 games (all starts), missing the Texas game due to a shoulder injury. He tied for the second most receptions on the team, as he had 28 catches for 314 yards (11.2 per), 12 first downs and a touchdown. He caught at least one pass in 11 games, but being the lone experienced wideout, he was keyed on by defenses and 18 of his catches went for single figures in length. However, he will go down in history for making one of the most exciting plays to end a game (and home season, as it turned out) in CU’s 38-31 win over Kansas State. With 16 seconds remaining and the Buffs on their own 36, he caught a pass from Joel Klatt at the K-State 23, eluded two defenders and raced along the east sideline into the end zone for the winning points with five seconds to go. Not only was the play the longest of the season by Colorado, it was also the longest of his career as well as his first career touchdown. That gave him four catches for 106 yards, also marking his first collegiate 100-yard receiving game. Just under half of his receptions came on first down, when he caught 13 for 183 (14.1 per), earning five first downs along with his TD play.He concluded his Colorado career ranked 23rd in all-time receptions (58) and finished 44th in career receiving yards (562).His senior leadership was heavily counted on in a unit where he was the only receiver that entered the season with any previous career receptions.\n\n2003 (Jr.)?He played in 10 games, including his first career start (against Kansas State), but missed the last two due to a shoulder injury. He caught 18 passes on the year for 153 yards (no touchdowns), and was stopped for an 8-yard loss on his lone rushing attempt (a reverse). He had his top game against Kansas in CU’s overtime win, catching five passes for 45 yards, including a clutch 18-yard reception on CU’s field goal-tying drive in the final three minutes. He also caught three passes against Kansas State and Oklahoma. The coaches selected him as the recipient of the Most Improved Offensive Player Award for the spring, when he was also one of 13 players to earn CU’s prestigious Spring Victory Club honors.\n\n2002 (Soph.)?He played in all 14 games including the Alamo Bowl (no starts), catching 12 passes for 95 yards during the regular season and adding one for 20 yards in the bowl against Wisconsin. He never really had the chance to break loose after one of his catches, although a nice 36-yard gain against San Diego State was negated due to a penalty. He had three catches in the opener against Colorado State, and caught two passes in four other games. Four of his 12 catches on the year were against Oklahoma (for a combined 37 yards), and five earned first downs. He was bothered for much of the spring by a nagging hamstring injury, but it was all but healed by the end of April.\n\n2001 (Fr.-RS)?Transferred to CU from Oregon State, arriving in Boulder during two-a-day practices. He was required to sit out the season due to NCAA transfer rules. He had a solid spring at OSU, where he finished up drills as the No. 2 flanker.\n\nAT OREGON STATE: 2000 (Fr.)?Redshirted; he practiced the entire season at flanker and was a member of OSU’s scout squad.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL?He earned PrepStar and SuperPrep (preseason) All-America honors as a senior, when he was also first-team all-Westside (Los Angeles Times), all-Bay League, all-CIF Division II and all-CIF Southern Section for all schools. He was an honorable mention selection on the Long Beach Press-Telegram’s prestigious Best In The West team, as he garnered four of the maximum 10 votes. As a senior, he made 58 receptions for 950 yards (16.4 per grab), scoring 13 touchdowns with a long of 68; he also added a pair of touchdowns running the ball. He returned 16 kickoffs for 512 yards as a senior, a healthy 32.0 yards per return. As a junior, he caught 41 passes for 940 yards (22.9 average), scoring 13 touchdowns that included one of 99 yards. On defense, he had 20 tackles and returned both of his interceptions for scores. On return team duty, he brought back 22 kickoffs for 546 yards (24.8 norm), including a 99-yard return for a score. He had 29 catches for 340 yards and five scores as a sophomore (with a long of 77). Top career games included a 12-reception, 192-yard effort against Peninsula High his senior year. Beverly Hills was 6-4 his senior year, 8-3 his junior year and sophomore seasons, and 11-1 his freshman year under coach Carter Paysinger. He lettered three times in basketball (guard; he averaged 15 points and eight rebounds as a junior; he did not play as a senior). He also lettered three times in track (sprints). He owned the school record in the 100-meters (10.63). He was Beverly Hills’ male athlete of the year all four years he attended the school.\n\nACADEMICS?He is majoring in economics at Colorado, and is on schedule to graduate next May. He earned honor roll status in his one year at Oregon State. As a high school senior, he was vice-president of the Black Student Union and was an honor roll student.\n\nPERSONAL?Born January 18, 1982 in Culver City, Calif. Hobbies include playing basketball and video games, especially John Madden Football (and claims he is one of the best in the country at it). His mother (Marissa) is a writer. Colorado had recruited him as a prep, but he signed with Oregon State. A former volunteer bereavement counselor, he has worked with at-risk teens. He was selected as a 2004 model for the national calendar, Alaye, whose mission is to increase breast cancer awareness in the African-American community. His uniquely spelled last name is pronounced mon-tay.\n\nRECEIVING High Games\n\nSeason G No. Yds Avg.
