        "text": "League Cup Fourth Round Home Lost 1-3\n\nA 1-3 home defeat to Birmingham City in the League Cup Fourth Round was an embarrassment for Tottenham, who failed to resist a forceful Blues side.\n\nDele Adebola scored twice in the 14th and 26th minutes, with Mark Burchill putting the visitors 3-0 ahead two minutes before the break with Tottenham’s only response a penalty from Darren Anderton after Stephen Clemence had been brought down in the area. Spurs did have chances, with Les Ferdinand having three headers saved, Stephen Carr testing Ian Bennett with a fierce shot and Chris Perry hitting the crossbar with a header.\n\nAs far as crap performances go, this rates right up there with our League Cup exits at the hands of Fulham (1999), Notts. County (1994), Burnley (1983) and Swansea (1978). Two down in 20 mins., 0-3 at 45 mins. and lucky not to be losing by six at half-time. This is as bad as it gets, especially when all Birmingham did was play football simply and for each other … something Tottenham seem incapable of doing these days.\n\nI exempt Stephen Carr from this as he was our best defender, midfielder and attacker. I am sure if he had decided to use his hands, he would have been a more than adequate keeper too. Clemence also tried, but the rest of the side were poor. Ramon Vega being almost inexplicably so. The first goal saw the Swiss defender let Adebola come inside onto his favoured left foot, nip between him and Thatcher and shoot past Sullivan. The second was the result of a long cross from the left to the far post where Adebola was unmarked, with Vega moving towards the goalpost (?). Third, a low cross into the box which Vega left at the near post, neither going to the ball or the man, leaving Burchill the easy task of popping in number three. Another flashed across the goal, with a Brummie head just failing to get to it, Burchill had one disallowed and another couple of chances flew wide of the mark. All Spurs had to show was a Perry header bouncing over off the bar.\n\nShambles is not quite the word for it. And it is not all because Sol and Sergei were missing, It goes deeper than that. Second half, Tottenham came more into it, but not that much. Les missed a couple of golden chances, Anderton put away the penalty when Clem had his legs whipped from under him and there was a Stephen Carr header which went just over.\n\nSomething needs to be done. Players are needed to raise the quality of the squad. Money needs to be released and we need to identify players who will improve the team. It doesn’t matter where they come from, just get them.\n\nMEHSTG TOP MAN : – STEPHEN CARR.\n\nFred Upp"
