        "text": "Paul Fenton waited 25 years to rise to the post of general manager. On Tuesday, his rocky tenure with the Wild came to an abrupt end after only one non-playoff season, news that was first reported by The Athletic.\n\nIn a late-summer decision that will send shockwaves throughout the State of Hockey and the entire league, sources said owner Craig Leipold called Fenton at his offseason home in Cape Cod late Tuesday morning and cut ties with him a little more than 14 months after naming the longtime Nashville Predators assistant GM the Wild’s third GM in team history. The team announced the move later Tuesday.\n\n“After giving much thought to this difficult decision, I informed Paul today that he was not the right fit for our organization going forward,” Leipold said in a release from the team. “I believe we have a good hockey team, a team that will compete for a playoff spot this year, and I look forward to hiring a general manager that will help us win a Stanley Cup. I would like to thank Paul for his time with the Wild and wish him and his family the best in the future.”\n\nObviously, the timing is unusual — 115 days into the offseason, 44 days until training camp and less than a month after Fenton signed Mats Zuccarello to a five-year, $30-million deal. No one incident caused the ousting, but the lingering fallout from a series of arguably bad trades and other personnel matters, along with internal issues that, sources said, created low morale throughout the hockey operations department and dressing room forced Leipold to make the move before Fenton could even manage his second season with the Wild.\n\n“The reason for the termination is not any one big issue,” Leipold said at a press conference Tuesday. “It was over time, smaller issues were building up. It was not a good fit.”\n\nLeipold, the 11-year Wild owner who will be available to the media Tuesday afternoon, is clearly doing something that’s not easy — acknowledging that he feels he erred when choosing Fenton over New Jersey Devils assistant GM Tom Fitzgerald in May of 2018.\n\nWhile this isn’t exactly Neil Smith being fired by the Islanders less than five weeks into his tenure in the summer of 2006, Fenton’s run in Minnesota is among the shortest GM stints in recent NHL history.\n\nLeipold, the original owner of the Predators, knew Fenton from his days in Nashville and felt his eye for scouting talent would help fill the cupboard of an organization that traded a ton of draft picks the past several years and was paying the price for those decisions lately. It’s part of the reason why Leipold ultimately hired Fenton despite the red flags of him being turned down for several NHL GM posts over the past decade, including with the Wild in 2009.\n\nFenton’s most notable moves as Wild GM started last summer when he signed defenseman Greg Pateryn and forwards Eric Fehr, Matt Hendricks and J.T. Brown. All were moves that tweaked the fourth line and third defense pair but didn’t eat into a core that was coming off its fourth first-round exit in a six-year postseason run.\n\nLast season, in a five-week span, Fenton acquired Brad Hunt and Pontus Aberg, claimed Anthony Bitetto off waivers, and traded Nino Niederreiter, Charlie Coyle and Mikael Granlund. The returns for the latter were, respectively, Victor Rask, Ryan Donato and Kevin Fiala, and the Bitetto pickup a day after acquiring Hunt triggered a series of events that helped derail a team that was suddenly rolling at the time.\n\nWhile the team has high hopes for Donato and Fiala, the Niederreiter trade stung as he went on to shine in Carolina, while Rask struggled to stay on the ice with the Wild. Entering this season, Rask’s likely going to be relegated to a fourth-line role with no special teams responsibility despite three years left on his contract at $4 million a season.\n\nFenton also nearly traded Jason Zucker at the trade deadline to the Calgary Flames on the same day he signed Eric Staal to a two-year extension rather than trading him to what sources said was the Boston Bruins. It also got out in June that Zucker would have been traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins had Phil Kessel waived his no-trade.\n\nBeyond that, sources said there were numerous accounts of unhappy employees throughout the organization and countless other turbulent incidents that made their way into Leipold’s office. Sources said for weeks that it was becoming abundantly clear to Leipold that Fenton was not fitting into the culture that he and CEO Matt Majka had worked to create since Leipold purchased the team in 2008. Leipold also noted Tuesday that exit interviews with players added to the sense that something wasn’t right.\n\n“I missed it,” Leipold said of Fenton not being the right fit, “and this is on me.”\n\nSo rather than giving Fenton another year’s chance to right the ship on the ice and off of it, Leipold obviously felt he better pull the plug now rather than allow further potential damage to come.\n\nWhile there’s little doubt Fenton was blindsided by Tuesday’s phone call, it’s believed he knew he was on thin ice after meetings with Leipold about his job performance this offseason.\n\nLeipold’s antenna has been up, which explains why he has wanted to be in the know on several of Fenton’s decisions, sitting in on scouting meetings and staying to the right of Fenton on Day 1 of the draft. It’s not out of character, but Leipold was also in the war room on July 1 — the opening of free agency — and has wanted to know about all trade talks.\n\nIt’s believed Fenton has two years left on his contract at around $1 million per season, so it’s a relatively inexpensive dismissal when one considers Wild coach Bruce Boudreau makes almost three times as much and Ken Holland was just hired by Edmonton as GM for a reported $5 million a year.\n\nSources said Leipold and Majka will immediately launch a GM search, with assistant GM Tom Kurvers named acting GM until a replacement can be found. No other changes in the front office have been made yet, so as of now Fenton’s senior advisor, Jack Ferreira, remains with the team, as does Fenton’s son, P.J., who co-ran the draft table.\n\nThis could be a very expedited GM search because Leipold undergoes surgery on his right hip Sept. 17 and he’d surely want to have somebody in place well in advance of the start of training camp Sept. 12 and the Traverse City prospect tournament Sept. 6.\n\nDuring the last search, Leipold and Majka interviewed a long list of candidates that included Fitzgerald, Penguins assistant GM Bill Guerin, former agent Bill Zito, Bruins executive director of player personnel John Ferguson Jr., now-Lightning GM Julien BriseBois and Ducks assistant GM Dave Nonis.\n\nAfter Fenton, it wouldn’t be shocking if the Wild decided to go the experience route this time around — Leipold said Tuesday he would prefer that, though he isn’t ruling anything out. If they do, there’s really only a small list. Some candidates include former Philadelphia Flyers GM Ron Hextall, former Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli, former San Jose Sharks and Los Angeles Kings GM Dean Lombardi and former New York Islanders GM Garth Snow.\n\nHextall, who did good work as assistant GM in L.A. and helped build quite the prospect pool in Philly, could be the leading contender. That would be ironic since former Wild GM Chuck Fletcher, who lasted eight more years in Minnesota than Fenton did, replaced Hextall as the Flyers’ GM.\n\nIf the Wild decide to look at up-and-comers again, Fitzgerald, Guerin and Zito are still highly respected candidates, while BriseBois has since replaced Steve Yzerman in Tampa Bay.\n\nZito is a former agent who worked closely in Columbus with GM Jarmo Kekalainen, while Fitzgerald and Guerin have worked for years in NHL front offices, so it wouldn’t exactly be an in-job training program if they were hired by Minnesota. Plus, they have the type of personalities that would allow them to enter a fractured Wild dressing room in an attempt to patch things up.\n\nDuring last year’s interviews, Leipold and Majka conducted the meetings without a so-called hockey guy as part of the process. A year later, Hall of Famer Mike Modano works for the Wild as executive advisor, so it would not be surprising if Modano is either part of some of the interviews or at least used as a consultant. He is not a candidate to take the GM position, Leipold said.\n\nFenton’s dismissal comes at a delicate time for the organization.\n\n— Veteran Zach Parise, who turned 35 on Sunday and has six years left on his contract, is very worried about the current state of the organization and at his age isn’t intrigued by being part of a rebuild. He voiced his thoughts in an article in The Athletic on Saturday. Sources have also told The Athletic that Fenton had been talking to a handful of teams about Parise and was made one trade offer that has been described to The Athletic as underwhelming.\n\nSurely, Leipold is hoping Fenton’s firing is met positively by Parise. Leipold, who recently met with Ryan Suter and is making the rounds with a lot of players to try to get some personalities back on the same page, met with Parise last week about his disenchantment. The two apparently had a good meeting.\n\n— Also, defenseman Jared Spurgeon is entering the final year of his contract. Spurgeon told The Athletic earlier this month that he’s willing to commit long-term to the Wild, but he wanted to first meet with Fenton to hear his vision toward long-term success in Minnesota.\n\n“You just get that itch that you only have so many years to actually have a chance and win and I just want to hear that plan,” Spurgeon said in early July.\n\nFenton was slow out of the starting gate in the Spurgeon negotiations, meeting with Spurgeon’s agent for the first time at the draft — peculiar because that would have been an ideal time to trade Spurgeon if the two sides discovered there was no way they could hammer out a deal.\n\nSince that meeting, sources say, Fenton made an offer in the $6.8 million range to Spurgeon, but the market arguably shifted when Jacob Trouba signed last week with the New York Rangers at the tune of $8 million a year for seven seasons. So waiting so long now seems like an ill-advised decision by Fenton.\n\nLeipold said he called Spurgeon on Tuesday and wanted to fly to Edmonton this weekend to meet with him. Spurgeon is on vacation, so Leipold will meet with him next month.\n\n— The Wild also hope to sign last year’s KHL leading goal scorer Kirill Kaprizov, the No. 11-ranked prospect in Scott Wheeler’s recent piece, when his contract in Moscow ends April 30. Fenton flew to Russia last season to begin developing a relationship and actually chatted briefly with Kaprizov’s dad in a hotel restaurant during the world championships in May. The Wild will have to monitor how Kaprizov absorbs the news of Fenton’s departure and make sure the eventual new GM gets in front of Kaprizov fairly quickly into his tenure.\n\n— The Wild are also working toward signing restricted free agents Fiala and Joel Eriksson Ek, although there has apparently been headway lately.\n\nDirector of Hockey Operations Chris O’Hearn will likely have the latitude to continue those negotiations with the hope of getting those deals done soon.\n\nIt’s surprising for a move of this magnitude to happen at this point in the calendar. But the Wild clearly felt a drastic course change like this was necessary to close the book on Fenton.\n\nNow it’s on to the next chapter as the Wild attempt to resurrect their long upstanding reputation and elevate their brand back toward the top of the pedestal locally.\n\nThis story has been updated with the official announcement of the move and to include comments from Leipold’s Tuesday press conference.\n\n(Photo of Craig Leipold and Paul Fenton: Jeff Vinnick / NHLI via Getty Images)"
