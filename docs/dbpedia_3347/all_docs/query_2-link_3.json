NTSC has shown that in our short history we are a club that can help players take the next step. With the squad we have built, 2024 is going to be a really exciting season to watch.â\n\nGordon represents Montserrat at the international level. He earned his first senior cap with the Montserrat Menâs National Team on September 9, 2023, against Barbados for Concacaf Nations League play in group B of League B.
