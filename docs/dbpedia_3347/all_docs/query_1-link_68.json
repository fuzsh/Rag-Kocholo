        "text": "Gary Rowett has agreed a shock return to Birmingham City - to save them from League One.\n\nThe club’s former boss responded to an SOS call and will oversee the final eight games as the Second City club battles to avoid the drop.\n\nRowett has been out of work since leaving Millwall five months ago - but will take on the job of preserving the Second City’s Championship status after a deal was hurriedly struck.\n\nBirmingham have won just one of their last six matches under assistant boss Mark Venus and now lie outside the relegation zone on goal difference. With boss Tony Mowbray still recovering from an unspecified medical condition, the club’s owners have decided to try and reverse the downward momentum towards the third tier of English football.\n\nThe club’s former defender Rowett - who managed the club for two seasons from 2014-16 - is expected to be employed on a consultancy basis until the end of the campaign.\n\nRowett, who played for the club under the late Trevor Francis - managed the feat of steadying the ship ten years ago when he took over following an 8-0 home defeat to Bournemouth. He oversaw a goalless draw in the first game at Wolves and steered the Blues comfortably away from danger. However, he was sacked in controversial circumstances just hours after a 2-1 victory over Ipswich Town that lifted Brum into seventh.\n\nThey dispensed with his services in favour of appointing Gianfranco Zola - an appointment that saw the club plummet down the table and only survived when Harry Redknapp was brought in to deliver a last hurrah.\n\nIn what are uncannily similar circumstances, Rowett now finds himself in the position of trying to find the victories necessary to prevent the same happening.\n\nBirmingham were taken over by American investment house Knighthead last summer and their first full season in charge has been nothing short of chaotic. The Americans have spent heavily on infrastructure projects but their efforts to spark an upturn have been undermined by the decision to replace John Eustace with Wayne Rooney.\n\nThat bizarre move upset the momentum of the campaign and following a run of just two victories from 15 matches, the former England great was replaced with Mowbray taking charge.\n\nHowever, the 60-year-old moved away from frontline management duties following the 2-1 defeat of Sunderland due to illness, leaving a void that Rowett will fill until the end of the season.\n\nThe decision allows Mowbray to continue his rehabilitation without being put under the stress of a return with Rowett given the reins until the end of the season."
