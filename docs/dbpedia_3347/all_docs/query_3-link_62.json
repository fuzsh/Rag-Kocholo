        "text": "Guest Post from TeddyBard\n\nA recent post on WHTID reminded me of a former hero many on here won’t remember. Born in Forest Gate, Ted Fenton played for England schoolboys as a forward but converted to wing half after joining West Ham in 1934. He played five times for England in the late 1930s and was a member of the West Ham team that beat Blackburn 1-0 in the 1940 FA Cup Final.\n\nFenton left West Ham in 1946 to manage Colchester United, then of the Southern League and reached the fifth round of the FA Cup in the 1947-48 season; with a 3-2 win over neighbours Chelmsford in the fourth qualifying round watched by a Layer Road crowd of 10,396. Wrexham, of the Third Division North were the next visitors to Layer Road and they were duly dispatched by a Bob Curry goal (1-0) with both sides missing penalties. First Division Huddersfield were next up (1-0), again with Bob Curry hitting the winning goal. It was the first time that a non-league side had beaten a First Division club. in the fourth round tie with Second Division Bradford Park Avenue Ted’s Colchester won 3-2. The fifth round draw was awaited with bated breath; and a Blackpool side featuring Stanley Matthews were the ultimate victors, with a 5-0 victory in front of a 30,000 sell-out crowd.\n\nTed joined West Ham that season as assistant manager to Charlie Paynter in 1948 (when I was 2) and became manager in 1950. His greatest achievement as manager was returning the club to the First Division in 1957-58; winning the Division Two championship and scoring 101 goals. Following promotion West Ham went on to score 59 goals at home the next season; the start of the good times in my opinion.\n\nPerhaps his other major achievement came during the time that Fenton was responsible for establishing “The Academy” and the development of the youth teams. West Ham reached the FA Youth Cup Final twice in three years over the period 1956–59.\n\nManchester United v West Ham United 8-2\n\nBlackburn Rovers v West Ham United 2-1\n\nSadly both losses but the foundation had been laid for the 1963 win.\n\nWest Ham United v Liverpool 6-5\n\nWith the help of Chairman Reg Pratt he was also responsible for encouraging as many players as possible to take their FA coaching badges to ensure that the players had something to fall back on when their playing days were over. Ted Fenton was sacked in March 1961 (no details were made available).\n\nSeven of the West Ham 1964 FA Cup winning team had either been signed by Ted Fenton from other clubs or had worked their way up from the Academy during his time as manager.\n\nGK 1 Jim Standen\n\nRB 2 John Bond\n\nLB 3 Jack Burkett\n\nRH 4 Eddie Bovington\n\nCH 5 Ken Brown\n\nLH 6 Bobby Moore ©\n\nOR 7 Peter Brabrook\n\nIR 8 Ronnie Boyce\n\nCF 9 Johnny Byrne\n\nIL 10 Geoff Hurst\n\nOL 11 John Sissons\n\nManager: Ron Greenwood\n\nHis brother Benny Fenton signed for Colchester Town in 1934, moving to West Ham United a year later. Benny made his professional debut for West Ham United on 9 October 1937, playing alongside his older brother Ted, as an inside forward in a match against Fulham.\n\nTed Died in a car crash in Leicestershire in 1992 and Benny died in Dorset in 2000.\n\nWe all have our favourites but this was the manager of the first West Ham team I ever saw."
