        "text": "For the sixth year in a row Workiva has been named one of Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For! Obviously you can find the press release and understand a bit about what goes into this score, but I think everyone has their own perspective on why Workiva is deserving of this honor six years in a row. From my perspective it is truly the people that make Workiva so great. For those that have been in sales, when you join an organization you quickly learn the different sellers at an organization that are widely respected but also produce year in and year out. In some organizations these are the people who seem to want to be “left alone” to drive revenue and do nothing else. However, the opposite is true at Workiva. I have countless examples of high level sellers and leaders willing to jump on a call (or multiple calls) to help me with whatever I may need. Below are a few that continue to stick with me today! 👇🏻👇🏻 Eric Wilson setting up time to learn about me my first week on the job and continuing to check in even though his responsibilties continue to only grow! Robert Marshall putting time on my calendar every other week for the better part of 3.5 years to see how he can help! Michael Falcone, CISA walking me through his discovery process and teaching me the “little things” that go along way! Beverly Shackley doing countless calls with me to make sure I understand our go to market strategy in capital markets and the value it brings organizations! Tanveer Singh & Meric Gambel riding right alongside of me for my first call when I was so new and not exactly certain how to run my first call 😂. Ken Pickard - partnering with me and showing his perspective on how to take a consultative approach to software selling! Marty Vanderploeg - yes our former CEO and current chairman of the board, showing that he is willing to connect with current and prospective customers in order to align himself as an executive sponsor. I have personally had Marty assist multiple times! These are just a few of the endless examples I have! Every great organization is made up of great people. That’s why I think Workiva is truly one of the best! It is full of people who just care! #thanks #workiva #fortune #technology #proud\n\n🚀 I can confidently say that JobNimbus is the most focused and driven company I’ve ever worked for. Every quarter, we reflect on our achievements as a business. I take the time to reflect on my personal growth. I’m grateful for the goals and growth I’ve experienced in my 9 months here. This last quarter, I was given a BHAG and was responsible for our gross revenue for the entire department. Boy did I learn a ton last quarter. I faced challenges, had my share of failures, but received unwavering support throughout the journey. Proudly I can say, the quarterly goal of 1.41M in gross revenue was met!!! Backing up to see my total impact, in just 9 months, I built and scaled our division’s top-of-funnel marketing and sales pipeline by over $2M for my division, accounting for over 30% in net new ARR. I didn’t do it alone. I have so many people to thank on the JForce. Todd Furness ,Kaili Smith, Johny Wudel Eric Dahl, Tyson Santo, Nick Powell, Nate Wilson, Romey King, August Amone, Lolomana’ia Wolfgramm , Jim Ahlin, Deni Blair, Sarah ⭐ D., Aaron Shelley, Matt Patrick, Matt Brown💭 and Seth Neilson to name just a few. Here at JobNimbus our leaders are passionate about their people, and the work we do truly drives impact. We’re constantly breaking records and moving the bottom line. With a culture of openness and honesty, we approach diffcult conversations with a spirit of growth and support. Every individual here is valued and recognized. Just yesterday, two of my friends toured our office, and unprompted, everyone my friends spoke with highlighted the incredible culture, the amazing people, and the clear impact each JForce member individvually knows they are making. Thanks, JForce, for reminding me that you can work in a great environment, tackle hard goals, and make success happen. 💥 #JobNimbus #Growth #Impact #Teamwork #Success #BreakingRecordsYall #Marketing #Sales\n\nTo say that I'm grateful to be a member of the development team at Ohanafy is an understatement: being with this group has been a game changer for my career. As a member of a team that's revolutionizing the distributor space with a top-tier CRM, my skills in Salesforce development, problem-solving, and system design are continuing to grow immensely. On top of this group being growth-oriented, some other reasons that I love it here include: 1. Getting to learn valuable lessons and insight from those more experienced than myself: whether it's through joint discussions, guest speakers, or knowledge transfers from a leader of the team, there's always something to absorb from them. 2. Being in an environment where there's mutual accountability in going the extra mile: through some late nights and long weeks working on single features, this team continually puts in the time to make the product as best as it can be. 3. Getting to know my peers better by connecting with them outside of work: from quick coffee runs to blasting each other with paintballs, this team knows how to have fun. This group truly operates as a unit, and I'm honored to be part of the Ohana 🥂 📸 @Jack Kessler\n\n🚀 I just joined an amazing group of SaaSy operators and I can’t wait to share with them and learn from them. 💪 ✨ Being part of a group of peers has been one of the most impactful things in my career - starting from when I was a newish commercial leader and still today. 🧐 Outside-in view: Sometimes, working at the same company day in and day out, gives you tunnel vision. Getting an outside perspective helps you keep that outside-in view of your work and organization and brings new ideas. 💡 Learn from others' experience and mistakes: In peer groups, you’ll almost always find someone who’s been in a similar situation to what you’re going through. Whether it's a challenge in your operations, an employee development matter or cross departmental constraints, sparring with peers can unlock some of these issues. 🤝 Accountability: Surrounding yourself with ambitious and smart people, naturally fosters a culture of accountability. When you meet with a network group, you're more likely to set and achieve goals, knowing that your peers are there to cheer you on and hold you to your commitments. ❤️ A place for vulnerability: Being in a group of people that are not your colleagues also gives you another outlet for vulnerability. Sharing feelings of failure is not always like to happen in the workplace, where you also want to maintain some distance and make sure that everything seems stable. 🌱 Moral support: This one is key! Having someone say; “Oh yeah, me too!! That’s a tough spot, but you got this!! Is one of the most crucial encouragements you can get. Whether you need advice, encouragement, or simply a sounding board, your peers will lift you up and guide you. Do you have a group of peers? What’s been the main benefit? PS. Thank you for the swag Daniel and Thomas! My kids help me bedazzle it a bit! 🤩 #peersupport #saasiest #commercialleaders\n\n🚀 **Reflecting on the Best SKO Ever at OPSWAT** I'm thrilled to share a recap of what was undoubtedly the best Sales Kickoff (SKO) we've ever had at OPSWAT! 🎉 **Celebrating Our 2023 Achievements** We started by reviewing our remarkable successes in 2023.
