        "text": "Tom Brady is racking up teams like Super Bowl rings -- the retired NFL superstar has become part owner of yet another sports organization ... this time, it's the Birmingham City Football Club.\n\nThe G.O.A.T. announced the business move in a hype video on Thursday ... saying \"he's officially coming on board\" the English Football League Championship squad.\n\n\"And maybe you're asking what do you know about English football, Tom?\" Brady said in the clip. \"Well, let's just say I've got a lot to learn. But I do know a few things about winning, and I think they may translate pretty well.\"\n\nBrady -- who joins the club's current owners, Knighthead Capital Management LLC -- will also serve as chairman of the advisory board.\n\n\"I know success starts with the work put in when the world isn't watching,\" Brady added. \"I know a team is nothing without the city that shows up and stands behind it.\"\n\n\"Most importantly, I know I like being the underdog. The road's been long for Birmingham, but these fans have never stopped believing.\"\n\nThe Blues will hope Brady's winning will rub off on them ... 'cause the team finished 17th in England's second-tier league last season.\n\nBirmingham City also addressed the move in a statement ... saying Brady will work directly with the team's sports science department to share his knowledge on \"health, nutrition, wellness, and recovery systems and programs.\"\n\n\"I'll see you at St Andrew's soon,\" TB12 added. \"It's time to get to work.\"\n\nBrady has clearly found a new hobby in sports ownership after retiring in February -- his collection now includes Birmingham City, the Las Vegas Raiders, the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces, a Major League Pickleball team, and, most recently, an E1 World Championship electric boat racing franchise."
