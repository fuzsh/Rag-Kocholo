        "text": "A radical revamping of the state's courts—in which bail would be abolished, judges would be subject to strict discipline and courts would be run by administrative technicians, rather than judges—was proposed yesterday by the Temporary Commission on the New York State Court System.\n\nThe goal is to rid the courts of their biggest weaknesses—the principal one of which, according to the commission, is extreme administrative inefficiency and lack of central direction— and thus put them in a position to provide what the commission calls “justice for all.”\n\nThe commission plan called for restructuring the courts into a “unified” system, with a merger of the five major trial courts — State Supreme Court, Family Court, Surrogate's Court, County Court and Court of Claims—into a single “Superior Court.”\n\nIt prescribed centralized management of the courts by a superstructure of administrators with a clear “chain of command” — and with the state's ranking judges stripped of their present administrative powers.\n\nThe panel called on the state to finance almost all costs of the courts, including probation services and court construction, These costs are now shared by the state and municipalities.\n\nImplementing the recommendations, the commission said, would add about $38‐million a year to the already steadily growing total cost of the court system.\n\nThe commission explained the $38‐million‐a‐year added cost of its proposals. Some savings, it said, would result front the new “efficiencies,” but additional expenses would be incurred by bringing the staffs of now‐local courts into the state system at state pay scales, and by providing such extras as expanded probation services.\n\nThe cost of courts and related agencies in 1972–73, including capital construction, was estimated at “slightly above $300‐million” Projections for 1974–75 and 1983–84, each including the $38‐million, were $400‐million and almost $900‐million, respectively.\n\nThe commission—which was created by the Legislature in May, 1970, to recommend ways to overhaul the court system, and whose members were appointed by the Governor and legislative leaders — suggested that the state begin at once to assume the full burden of court costs. The take‐over of financing should “in no event” require more than 10 years, it said.\n\nAnd the constitutional amendments and statutes needed to implement the other parts of the plan, according to the commission, could be in effect by mid‐1976.\n\nThe commission, which said it had spent about $900,000 in its work, sent its proposal to the Governor, the Legislature and the Judicial Conference yesterday in the form of a three‐volume 180‐recommendation report.\n\nThe report signified that the panel had found, in effect, that the state's 1962 court reorganization—in which “unification” had been attempted by merging many then‐existing courts—had failed to accomplish its aim.\n\nAmong the commission is specific findings were the following:\n\n¶Present administration of the courts is extremely inefficient and ineffective, characterized by a “lack of central direction.”\n\n¶The present division of New York City's courts into two administrative units — the Appelate Division for the First Department and the Appellate Division for the Second —“makes no sense whatsoever.”\n\n¶Screening by the prosecutors to determine which cases should not go to court is “spotty.”\n\n¶The multiplicity of courts has “placed unnecessary obstacles before those seeking and those providing justice.”\n\n¶The division of resources and staff in the courts is “significantly out of phase with the principle that actions involving personal liberty should be given priority over actions involvig property rights.”\n\n¶Judges n local courts are “often untrained in the law.”\n\n¶The effectiveness of the present system of disciplining judges is hard to gauge because “formal records are not kept.”\n\n¶The bail system “arbitrarily discriminates against the poor”; “places pressure on the defendant to plead guilty,” and may affect the outcome of the trial. Judges “do not rely on statutory criteria” in setting bail.\n\nAs the commission chairman, C. Clinton Dominick, said in his introduction to the report, “Although the commission found much that is right with the state court system, it found too much that is wrong.”\n\nThe commission report, coming at a time when the courts here are under mounting attack — from judicial reform groups, the press, municipalities and judges themselves—takes note of the special problems of New York City, with its huge case load.\n\nIt said that the state, for purposes of court administration, should be divided into two sections: New York City and the rest of the state, with a deputy administrator for each. It also specified that New York City should have its awn criminal‐justice coordinator to oversee and aid various courts and agencies dealing with crime. The other areas of the state would have to depend on a statewide criminalustice coordinator—who would also be available to New York City.\n\nThe two criminal‐justice coardinators would be two of the members of a large administrative apparatus, and the method of their selection indicates the complexity of that apparatus.\n\nAt the top of the administraive system—and ultimately accountable for the courts' performance—would be an official called the chief administrative judge, appointed by the chief judge of the state. The chief administrative judge would not have to have judicial training; be would carry the title “judge,” a commission staff member explained, for the “psychological” help it would give.\n\nHe would have four chief assistants, called deputy chief administrators — two for the judicial regions, one for adminstrative services, and one for the appellate court and “judicial services,” with the latter to serve as a sort of “qualitycontrol officer.”\n\nThe criminal‐justice coordinator for the state would be appointed by, and would be on the staff of, the deputy chief for administrative services. The coordinator for the city would be on the staff of the deputy chief for the city's courts.\n\nThe commission rejected some reform proposals that had been made recently by critics and officials of the city's courts.\n\nOne is the oft‐made recommendation for a merger of the New York City Criminal Court, which handles the early stages of felony cases and the full processing of misdemeanors, with the criminal terms of the State Supreme Court branches here, which complete the felony processing.\n\nTwo weeks ago the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference, which sets policies for the state's courts, took a step in that direction by merging the management of the Criminal Court and of State Supreme Court in the Bronx and Manhattan, Last week, Mayor Lindsay, in his courtreform package, recommended a complete merger.\n\nThe major argument in favor of such a merger is that it would cut out much duplication of effort that now occurs. But the commission rejected this and said that New York City, like the rest of the state, should have a two‐tier system: a lower court to do what the Criminal Court does now, and an upper court—a new amalgamated “Superior Court”—to do what the Supreme Court now does.\n\nThe commission's sole concession here was to specify that the New York City Criminal Court be allowed to accept guilty pleas in felony cases, something it can't do now.\n\nThe commission gave a number of reasons for rejecting the merger idea. A single‐tier trial court might become “seriously bogged down” by the vast number of “minor” matters now handled by the lower‐level courts, it said. Also, the “relatively few” more‐serious cases now handled by the higher‐level courts might not receive “proper and timely attention.”\n\nAbout the situation in New York City, it said a merger would require setting up “an unwieldy administrative system.” It added that “these separate courts are operating efficiently”—an assessment that many observers of the city's courts would strongly reject. It is generally agreed that the Criminal Court has improved vastly recently, but it is also agreed by all but some Supreme Court justices, that the Supreme Court branches here are not efficient at all.\n\nAnother reform proposal that the commission rejected was the recommendation—by Mayor Lindsay, Governor Rockefeller and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, among others—that all judges be appointed rather than elected.\n\nCurrently, judges are elected to the Court of Appeals, the Surrogate's Court, the Supreme Court, the New York City Civil Court, most city and town courts, and most Family Courts outside New York City. They are appointed by the Governor to the Appellate Division and the Court of Claims; by the Mayor to the New York City Family Court and the Criminal Court.\n\nUnder the commission plan, this picture would change only a little. Judges of the Appellate Court (as the Appellate Division would be termed under the commission's restructuring plan), of the New York City Civil Court and the New York City Criminal Court would be appointed — the first by the Governor, the second two by the Mayor.\n\nIn each case the appointing officer would have to select from a list of names supplied by a judicial nominating committee. In the case of the appellate court, more people would be eligible than now for the judgeships—in addition to Supreme Court judges, lawyers with 10 years experience would also be eligible.\n\nBut elections would still be conducted for the Court of Appeals (which would be eventually renamed the “Supreme Court,” in keeping with its role as the state's highest court), for the “Superior Court,” for the “District Courts” (lowerlevel courts in counties outside New York city), and city and town courts.\n\nThe main change here is that the judicial nominating conventions now used to choose Supreme Court candidates would be abolished, and Superior Court elections would be handled on a county basis.\n\nThe usual arguments against the election of judges are that it provides no adequate guarantee of judicial competence, it falsely assumes that the public is familiar with the candiddates, it detracts from the dignity of the judiciary, and it allows politics to play a role it should not. Mr. Lindsay said last fall that the system allowed judges to be picked in “backroom political deals.”\n\nThe commission, however, justified its decision in various ways—depending on the court. It said Court of Appeals candidates could get sufficient public visibility. It said that because of the “relatively large” number of Appellate Court judges and of the large size of the appellate departments, candidates for that court would not get sufficient visibility.\n\nAbout the Superior Court—with a far greater number of judges, though with smaller election districts—the commission said it was “unable to conclude” that appointment would “necessarily” bet better than election. Of the New York City Criminal and Civil Courts, it noted that Criminal Court judges were already appointed and that “there is no reasonable basis for distinguishing between the method of selecting judges” of the two courts.\n\nCommission members seem\n\nHighlights of Commission Report\n\nThe major recommendations of the commission are the following:\n\nADMINISTRATION—The courts would be placed under centralized management with final responsibility vested in a chief administrative judge selected by the state's chief judge. The present Administrative Board, which is composed of the chief judge and the presiding justices of the Appellate Divisions and which sets policies for the courts, would be abolished.\n\nFINANCING—The state would pay all costs of the court system, including costs of probation services and of court construction. The only exceptions would be town courts and city courts outside of New York City; prosecutors' offices, counsel for the indigent, medical examiners and coroners. The cost would be about $38‐million annually.\n\nSTRUCTURE —The State Supreme Court, Family Court, Surrogate's Court, Court of Claims and County Court would be merged into a Superior Court. The Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court would become the Appellate Court, with five rather than four departments. The Court of Appeals would become the Supreme Court, with much wider power than it now has to select the cases to be reviewed. District Courts would be set up in larger counties to handle minor criminal and civil matters, and city and town courts in those counties would be abolished.\n\nSELECTION AND DISCIPLINE OF JUDGES—The selection system would be modified only slightly. Most of the judges who are now appointed would continue to be appointed and most who are now elected would continue to be elected, but appointments would be made only from lists of candidates suggested by special committees. A commission on judicial conduct would investigate complaints about judges and could censure judges; the Court on the Judiciary would become full‐time and could remove or otherwise discipline judges.\n\nCRIMINAL CASES—Bail would be abolished, and defendants, pending trial, would be either released on their own recognizance, released under certain conditions and supervision, or detained. Preventive detention would be forbidden, pending trial, but would be permissible in the interval between conviction and sentencing. Defendants would have their cases dismissed unless they were tried within certain time periods. Defendants charged with felonies would have their choice of either preliminary hearings or grand jury indictment, but not both.\n\nUnit to Urge Change Was Created in 70\n\nThe Temporary Commission on the State Court System was created by the Legislature in May, 1970, to recommend ways to overhaul the court system. Its members were to be appointed by the Governor and the legislative leaders, who were to postpone major court reforms until after the commission made its final report; the report was to be filed by Feb. 1, 1971.\n\nIt took more than five months for the commision members to be appointed. The commission waited until after the final‐report deadline even to offer the job of staff director to anyone—and then chose someone who would not be available for another two months. It took an additional five months after that for the staff to be hired.\n\nBy last winter, at least three commission members had considered resigning, and the deputy staff director did resign. By last February, the commission was only beginning to define the problems of the court system, then the commission began work in earnest.\n\nPanel's Membership Blends Professions\n\nThe commission's membership is a blend of public officials, lawyers and community leaders.\n\nThe Governor's appointees were W. David Curtiss, professor at Cornell Law School; Robert L. Carter, who subsequently became a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan; Mrs. Charles Hubbard of the New York State League of Women Voters; Robert Patterson Jr., former president of the Legal Aid Society here, and Charles A. Siegfried, president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.\n\nD. Clinton Dominick, then a Republican Senator from Newburgh and the commission chairman, and Dalwin J. Niles, Senator from Johnstown (who resigned last June), were appointed by Earl W. Brydges, then the Senate majority leader. Joseph Zaretzki, the minority leader, appointed Charles S. Desmond, former chief judge of New York.\n\nThe Assembly speaker, Perry B. Duryea Jr., appointed Assemblymen Edward Crawford of Oswego and Stephen C. Hansen, who was replaced by Assemblyman Peter J. Costigan in 1971. The minority leader, Stanley Steingut, appointed Nathan R. Sobel, the Brooklyn surrogate. to be in disagreemnt on the subject. Several members are known to be strong advocates of the appointive system; others, particularly the legislative appointees on the panel, favor election.\n\nNo dissenting opinions were filed but a paragraph in Mr. Dominick's introduction to the report notes that “a few” of the recommendations were voted by a “narrow majority” —such as the recommendations concerning both bail and the selection of judges.\n\nThe commission's final report made no strong recommendations in two other areas where would‐be reformers have recently been urging change—no‐fault automobile insurance and in sentencing disparities.\n\nIt did, however, specify both areas as matters for future action. On the subject of nofault, for instance, it said that automobile‐accident cases are “a likely candidate for removal from the courts”—and that “pure no‐fault” plan, in which no lawsuits would be allowed, could reduce the civil workload of the Supreme Court by 33 per cent.\n\nAsked at a press briefing why the commission had not simply recommended that such Lcases be taken out of the courts, the staff director, Harrold A. Jerry Jr., replied that the commission had only limited time and resources. Observers suggested, though, that the commission might have warted to avoid a controversial political issue to help get its basic recommendations through the Legislature.\n\nAs for inconsistent sentencing, the commission said the problem was exacerbated by the need to process defendants through the overburdened criminal‐justice system as quickly as possible. But it offered no solutions, saying only that it would be up to the deputy chief administrator for judicial services (“the qualitycontrol officer”) to improve matters.\n\nMost of the programs that the commission recommended had been proposed before, at least in basic form. Thus the creation of a merged “Superior Court” was suggested by another state group in the midnineteen‐sixties. And the idea of a centralized court administration to replace the present Administrative Board has been suggested numerous times.\n\nThe suggestion that the state pay all costs of the courts has been made by Mayor Lindsay and by Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld and others.\n\nThough no state has yet done away with the bail system, different aspects of reform have been broached by various groups here. According to the commission, a judge should either release a defendant on his own recognizance or release him subject to certain conditions and supervision—the supervision to be provided by an expanded Probation Department. And if a defendant has previously failed to meet court date, or where the charge is a felony, the judge should be allowed to detain the defendant if it thinks that detention is needed to ensure the defendant's appearance for trial. He would have to give his reasons, in writing, for thinking this.\n\nThe commission's plan for judicial discipline—the creation of a full‐time staffed commission to investigate complaints about judges—has also been suggested before and, in fact, is modeled after the California system.\n\nBut the commission proposal adds some refinements that. according to Mr. Jerry would make New York's system the “strictest in the land.” The commission could censure judges. If it wanted a judge retired or removed it would refer the case to the Court on the Judiciary which, under the commission plan, would be made a permanent court. The court now is convened by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals only after documented complaints have been lodged.\n\nNearly all of the commission's proposals require constitutional amendments and some also require subsequent legislation.\n\nIn an effort to help get its proposals passed —in a year when many others, including the Governor and Mayor Lindsay, are also planning courtreform packages to the Legislature—the commission included in its report a full volume of proposed constitutional and statutory amendments."
