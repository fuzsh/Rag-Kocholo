I've coached and been at seeding meetings. You would be surprised at the things that go on behind closed doors. Many, many coaches are true professionals. Many are not. I'd really like to here from coaches on this matter. I doubt a long, combative seeding meeting would be worth the no extra pay the coaches would receive. Plus, beleive it or not, some coaches would not show up!! God help those kids when a coach is absent. The result of a seeding would at best probably not produce a better result . Speak up coaches!!!\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: anyone have predictions for AA/A region 2 135 weight class\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: Does anyone have any predictions on region 2 AAA?

That probably had some bearing on his 4th seed in the regionals. Who knows? I also am not sure why Porter was seeded ahead of Shaw, but that will be interesting if they meet in the finals. It would have helped clear some things up if South and Brooke had wrestled in the regular season. We'll find out Saturday.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Iron\n\ncomments: Humprhy may be seeded 4th because he did not even make it to state last year. But Hayes was runner-up last year, McCray didnt go to state but did beat Hayes this year in double OT. And Turnbull beat McCray by pin and Hayes by dec 5-1. That explains it all really.Humphry hasnt wrestled anyone of those guys.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: To - Yucatan Man\n\ncomments: There you go again!!!! At this point right before regionals, you can't actually put any 2 wrestlers in the finals until the pills are drawn. Please after the regional results are in and the pill is drawn then please feel free to post your opinions.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: No One Mentioned Parkersburg in the Post\n\ncomments: From: To: \"The State Tournament is to fin out determine the state champion. End of story.\"\n\nActually there was no mention of Parkersburg what so ever in the post so why did you read yourself into it. I read it as a statement not directed to anyone or any team in particular. I bet if you ask any wrestler in the state tournament he will say his main goal for being there is to win a state championship. So quit your crying, whining or whatever and don't take this forum so seriously. Read at the top what the doc said about all the posting \"take them with a grain of salt\".\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Pirate_Mann\n\ncomments: \"The State Tournament is to find out determine the state champion. End of story.\"\n\nObviously the purpose of the state tournament is not solely to find the champion. If this were the case there would not be a consolation bracket. If all you care about is the champion that's fine. But don't try to claim what the state tournament is or is not because you have no authority to do so. Every wrestler, coach and spectator can decide for themselves what constitutes a significant performance. Furthermore I don't know of very many wrestlers who have had a \"ride\" to the semis. Every quarter is composed of one champion, one runner-up, one third and one fourth place regional finisher. This means (using the transitive property) to win out a wrestler should be able to beat at least nine of the 15 other people in bracket. (It's true that occasionally triangles will occur to skew this but the point remains that the wrestler would have at some point proven themselves over 9 people through regional and state performances) Therefore it can be said that the wrestler is in at least the top 7.\n\nI would like to to use an example to better illustrate this. Consider 160 AA last year. Adkins from Clay was a semi finalist who finished sixth. He won his region so we know he was above: Burgess(1), Shaffer(2), and Merola(3). He beat Post(4) is the quarters this would imply that he was also above the Grafton kid(5) who finished below Post in his region. Post also beat Osbourne(6) who finished 2nd in region 3 above Jones(7) and Wood(8). Furthermore Adkins beat Hashman(9) in his first match.\n\nThis does not mean that he would without a doubt beat any of these people head-to-head. It simply implies that of the 10 people who did not place Adkins legitimatly deserved to place above at least nine of them. I think this is about as accurate as a tournament can hope to be. Therefore sixth isn't too bad.\n\n(Before people start trying to bombard me with counter examples make sure the weight class in question didn't feature a circle of people beating each other in which can no one component of the circle really deserves to place any more than another.) Thank You\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nEditor's note: Here follows a flurry of posts regarding the alleged Region I seeds, posted further down the page, allegedly submitted by Coach Powers. I took a gamble that these seeds were in fact posted by coach Powers. They could have been posted by a Coach Powers imposter, trying to stir up trouble, and may be false. Thats why these \"seeds\" were posted on the forum page, and not linked on the front page as \"official information.\"\n\nAs I have said many times, take every thing you read on this forum with a grain of salt. If and when I get more official confirmation of seeding and bracket information, via email with verifiable return address, such info will be linked on the front page as official.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: my bad on questioning the not seeding of mcfarland earlier... did not see that he had a loss to waldron of university, but i caught it... 4-3 at Park Duals.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: South\n\ncomments: I would like to thank University High for their switches at 145, 152, and 160. Also to John Marshall at 171. In a close race we'll see how it plays out. Just out of curiosity, (and not really complaining about the seeding) I wonder what the criteria was that placed Ice ahead of Gerasimovich when the latter had just recently beaten the former head to head in their only meeting. Also,I am curious how University's 152 (at least for most of the year I believe) was seeded ahead of Parkersburg's usual 160.\n\nNot that I believe that it is crucial to South, but a head to head win over PHS at 119, if they meet as expected in the semis (let's not overlook Smith of Brooke if the byes put him in this bracket) would likely create a 12 point overall change in the team scoring. After all, in retrospect, I feel this was in reality the most pivotal match that propelled South to their win (not meaning to take anything away from all the other wrestlers on both sides that wrestled their hearts out). It was a great regular season for both teams and congratulations to all the wrestlers and coaches. Good luck to all.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Pburgeer\n\ncomments: Girls wrestling is becoming more popular, how long do you think it will be untill girls have their own teams and State Championships? This past weekend in Wood Co. Jeseca Teeters took the MVW award. She earned it outright. She has put in 7 years against the boys and I think it's time for female competition teams.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Final thought-To the one who thought I underestimated southern wrestlers\n\ncomments: This will be the last thing I'll say on the issue since people like to take what you actually write and make it say something else. I never degraded any part of the state and never used the word southern. I merely defended someones right to be ranked #1 when they maybe were being underestimated. I never moved your wrestler down from 2nd or 3rd or whatever place they were ranked. I can assure you, as a prior Parkersburg wrestler, that we don't underestimate anyone. We wrestle full tilt from the start. Quite honestly, I just like good wrestling and wrestlers, no matter where they are from and I can recall many \"southern wrestlers\", past and present, who were excellent. I can't wait to see what happens and I realize the kids aren't wrestling for me, they wrestle for themselves.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Superman\n\ncomments: BS 160 is good also, probably top 3\n\nSuperman=Clark Kent\n\nZenGrappling.com\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Blue\n\ncomments: After reading predictions on this forum and listening to people talk I find it humerous when people say \"ole so and so is gonna' win easily\" or \" so and so = something\". It all reminds me of the old saying \"ANYBODY CAN BE BEAT ON ANY GIVEN DAY\". 'NUFF SAID!\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: To: \"The State Tournament is to fin out determine the state champion. End of story.\"\n\ncomments: First of all, no one is crying or complaining. Just making observations. Second of all, you are obviously not from Parkersburg. Because of that, I'll allow you the ignorance to think the state is only about which kid wins 1st place in their weight class. We are certainly interested in that as one could see if you count the number of Parkersburg kids at the top of the podium. However, when we go to the state tourny each year we are also trying to win the TEAM championship. That's what all the talk is about. Maybe someday you'll understand. By the way we actually like all our kids and revel in their accomplishments, whether it's 1st or 6th (or just tried their best). Maybe that's also why we keep winning the state, since we consider it a team sport. Didn't mean to sound so harsh, but I took offense at the crying, whining or whatever you accused us of. But now you're smarter.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Yucatan Man\n\ncomments: I know AAA 145 is LOADED : Litton, Osuna-Cotto, Richey, Nelson, Demastes, Wilson, Connor all have a chance to place. But the move by David Cambell to go to 152....is the best move all year....it will be Cambell and Smith in the state finals. Great move Cambell. Also 145 AA/A is loaded: Hughes is the favorite, Elder, Dye, Hines, Bonecutter all could be in the finals with him. Stevens also could slip in and place. Duryea and Meadows arnt bad either. But AA/A 152 has turned into in my opionion a class to watch. 145 is still a stronger class, but 152 is going to be interesting. Northcraft, Metz, Bosley, Dennis, Efaw, Wince, Miller, Whipkey. Here are your top 8. I see Metz beating Northcraft in the finals. Dennis toping Bosley for third. Efaw beating Wince for sixth (Paybacks for last year). Miller might make a run in there some where too. I am ready for the states@!!!\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: If there are any kindhearted people out there that may have found a Sony CD player and filled CD case at this past weekends Beckley Young Guns wrestling tournament, you can contact the tournament officials to get the information to return them. I would be happy to make arrangements to get these items or pay to have them shipped to me. Any information you have truly would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: i know no one likes criticism and i sure dont want to open a can of worms for the Park and Brooke fans, but I 've never seen a kid go through the regular season undefeated and get seeded 4th in his regional tournament (Humphrey from Park). Also, I believe Shaw should have garnered the #1 seed at 135, he wrestled 130 last year and Porter wrestled 119, believe it or not folks there is a big difference there. I don't see how Porter's accolades in the season outrank Shaw's, yeah Braden did get 3rd last year and Porter got 2nd but I mean Shaw's only loss at states was to Matt Easter (understandable). Is McFarland out, or did they really not seed the defending state runner-up at 125? I guess someone will end up unhappy however in the end. Also saw Campbell went to 152 for regions.... might turn out to be a great move, considering his regional seeding went from 4th to first just by doing that.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Peter Pan\n\ncomments: Region IV AA/A Finals\n\n103 - Boggs rc fall Hart pp\n\n112 - Moffatt w dec Hanson hh\n\n119 - Billings rav fall Griffin Roa\n\n125 - Ellis wah dec Leithead sis\n\n130 - Ashley cal fall Morris hh\n\n135 - Cummings cal fall Mollohan hh\n\n140 - Casto pp md Price Cal\n\n145 - Bonecutter pp tf Fisher hh\n\n152 - Metz dec Dennis rav\n\n160 - Goodrich cal fall Brainard rc\n\n171 - Adkins clay dec Carr pp\n\n189 - McCoy hh fall Fisher wc\n\n215 - Tench pp dec Mullins rich\n\n275 - Shirley pp fall Anderson hh\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: ratteaser\n\ncomments: even though doc delets my posts ..and i hate it..i think he does a great job..i even posted in spanish and was edited and deleted...\n\nregion I will be fun...there are always surprises!\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Lloyd Christmas\n\ncomments: HOW can Humphrey be #4???

If Humphrey from wheeling park is undefeated for the season, then why is he ranked 4th in the region, below hayes and mccray. this defies reason or maybe someone can explain. seems to me, if there is no head to head wrestling and noone that has beaten the guy that one of the others may have beaten especially since he is unbeaten as is turnbull the #1 seed then it stands to reason that he should be the #2 seed.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: tech fall\n\ncomments: could someone post top 4 seeds for region II, as far as rash moving up to 112 and winning it easy, noone beats any of those easters easy you'll have to earn it and good luck not to speak of rush, ewing, etc. 103doesn't appear to be as tough this year without some of the before mentioned wrestlers all of whom I believe would have won it this year, but seams to be very evenly competitive with a lot of upcoming freshman, 112 seems to drop off severely after the top 3, 119 theres turnbull and then about 10 other wrestlers that could beat each other on any given day should be interesting weight class, 125 region I should dictate championship, 130 believe the same is true, 135 look for gustines and porter in championship, 140 m. smith does just what it takes and that is all that matters, 145 should be very competitive, 152 region II may not take the title here but gustines, jarvis, and foltz are fierce competitors, good luck to them and all the Region II especially eastern panhandle wrestlers including AA berkeley springs. ps glad to see you back tyson.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: For region 1 AAA I see PHS having 7 champs, South having only 3? Campbell from university.....is he really at 152? hasnt he been at 145 all year\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: seeds: South 13 seeded PHS 11. I say 152 dowler wants to go BAD, he will prevail, and combs by a long shot, he'll have to step it up this saturday if he wants to go to huntington.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: fan\n\ncomments: I can honestly say I am not a Parkersburg or Parkersburg South fan, so I don't have any more liking for one than the other. I do, however, respect both. Looking at the seeds for AAA Region 1, I noticed that the two of them apparently tried to stay out of each others' way. It would be hard to believe that many seeds just turned out that way unless some seeds were declined, etc., to put these guys in different brackets. To whomever keeps posting that seeding or pill doesn't matter to the true champions, you're wrong. Nobody really wants to wrestle the final in the first round. Seeding can have a dramatic effect on team scoring. Teams with the greater number of seeds should score accordingly, assuming the wrestlers do their part and finish up to their seed. If you buy the idea that it doesn't matter to a real champion, then put as many of your wrestlers as possible in the same bracket with their biggest threat and the ones who aren't seeded in the top 4, put them on line 2. That way you can have an early showdown with your nearest rival. You'll take charge early, they'll take charge of you, or most likely, you'll tear each other down enough that someone else could slip into the team scoring picture. At first look at these seeds, it appears that these two teams are going to try to send as many into the championship finals as possible without eliminating each other first. If this is what they have in mind, they could each qualify alot of wrestlers for the state tournament. The only problem with that is the other guys in these brackets aren't just spectators- they'll be fighting for a spot themselves. These are just some ramblings on.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: wirey\n\ncomments: are you gonna post the brackets for the regional tournaments.\n\nEditor's note: We have no plans to do that. If someone sends them in we will post them.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: yoodle\n\ncomments: when are your next individual postings gonna be out so that we can all gripe about where you put the wrestlers\n\nEditor's note: Midnight tonight. Updated polls have been sent to the wire service for a February 18 release date.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Smart one\n\ncomments: I guess there are many questions about \"the drum,\" first of all it is only used at dual and tri-matches. It has also been around for quite sometime now, I am not exactly sure how long though. It is not meant to upset or mock the Native Americans, it is merely a tool of excitement for the Big Red wrestlers. You can't tell me that any kid who has another kid on his back would not get a thrill out of hearing such thunderous noise from the crowd. You should hear the terrible things the fans say to the drum beater, those people are the bad sports. Fans are there to support the athletes, not harass and ridicule the coaches, refs and other fans. Last year the girl on the drum was attacked by another fan, he tried to take the stick right out of her hand and was fighting her for it--she won. Finally, if you do not like the drum, stay off your back. Go Big Reds!\n\nP.S. PHS does not use the word \"Indian\" on any of there school uniforms, for a reason.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Panhandle Fan\n\ncomments: Robert Hickman said \"Seeding meetings would lead to backroom deals that would be unbelieveable for the kids. Good debators would get the best seeds. Groups of coaches would gang up on common enemies and the kids would suffer. Just look at the disagreements on the posts received on this website on the predictions of the top six placers at the state tournament. Seeding is just predicting the order of finish. Do you really think the coaches could fairly agree with any hint of civility. I doubt it. Semi-final or final, you must win both to be crowned champ. The pill system has worked well, is not perfect, but is best for the fairness to the kids. If I'm wrong, let us hear from the coaches.\"\n\nI am not a coach and I'm not defending or condemning the pill system. But, I am a fan who pays attention to both WV and OVAC wrestling and don't think that you've made a fair assessment of coaches.\n\nMost coaches are competitive men, it's true. It carries over from having been a competitor. But to suggest that a seeding meeting couldn't be done with fairness or civility is a strong judgement on their character and ethics.\n\nWvmat linked to an article with Larry Shaw on OVSO a couple of weeks ago. Here is what he said about the OVAC seeding meeting \"I like to think we [coaches] don't spend a day in Wheeling doing the seedings for nothing. It's not much fun and I've never really enjoyed it. I always say the tournament begins on Sunday with us down there fighting for those seeds. The coaches should really be commended. It's a long hard day, but generally the results bear the seeds out... generally. Well, it's very comprehenseive. We submit all of the kids' prior records plus opponents' information with the results of every match in paper form prior to the meeting. Then the morning of the meeting, those things are updated. The weight classes are seeded in random order. We recommend our wrestlers for seedings and give reasons. And, it's discussed by all of the coaches. When there are questions, it's put to a vote, and the kid with the most votes gets the seed.\"\n\nYes it sounds competitive and yes Larry Shaw and every other coach will want to get his wrestler the best possible seed. But it doesn't sound like these men can't be civil or create unfair situations for the wrestlers. I think the WV coaches could do as well.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Pburgeer\n\ncomments: The issue of the Parkersburg Big Reds is not so big, It wasn't until the 50's that Parkersburg used the Indian mascot. Until then they where simply the the Big Red of Parkersburg. Triadephia was the Little Reds because not only of Parkersburg , but Stubinville. The Big Red can be contributed to several Items and and the Big Red histroy should make the Natives Proud.

End of story.\n\nSo many people come on here crying about this or that side of the bracket. A true champion would welcome the best competition. If you are the best that weekend, against the best competition, then you're the Champion. A kid can lose 3 matches and place 6th, while another kid can lose 2 (at the wrong time), and be eliminated from the tournament. Placing is nice, but is over-rated. The Tournament is only to find out who is the State Champion, Not to give someone's kid a deserving ride to the semis so he can place. So don't worry about what side your kid is on, if he is the best he will beat them all.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Batman&Robin\n\ncomments: I'd like to comment on Superman!

This not even pertain to this region! I was just asking and question and making a statement, I thought that this web site was intended for these purposes. Discussion only. Thanks please reconsider the post I submitted on Monday you know the one I am talking about. Thanks Good Luck to all region participants. Hope this all works out for the best.\n\nEditor's note: I really don't know the one you are talking about. I've been deleting so many posts lately I don't know which one you are referring to. Re send it and I'll take a look.\n\nI'm getting a lot of posts saying \"If so and so would work a litter harder his team would place higher in the states...\" and some such. This is a dis on wrestlers who for the most part are working their guts out this time of year, and they don't need some nameless wag implying they are loafing. If some wrestler needs to work harder in the practice room, I'm sure his/her coach is capable of drawing that to his/her attention.\n\nI'm getting a lot of posts from fans who state that in fact they did boo at a match recently, and insist on outlining exactly who they were booing and why. We don't need that.\n\nI made the mistake of posting an anonymous complaint about a (nameless) youth wrestling tournament earlier this year, and now everyone wants to ventilate their anger over youth wrestling. If youth wrestling in WV is so entirely unsatisfactory, then perhaps its time to get the entire youth program in WV sanctioned by USA wrestling or some such and put it under the oversight of some official governing body.\n\nI get posts from people who are upset over the choice of OW award at various tournaments. To state that someone else should have won the award is to state that the person who did receive the honor was underserving. Why should these young athletes have to put up with that?\n\nThen there are the usual posts accusing referees of cheating, being blind, incompetent, etc. The referees are rated by the coaches of the teams involved in the match, and their ratings go the the SSAC which handles such concerns. I'll not get in to referee bashing here.\n\nThen there are the usual conspiracy theories concerning the pill. And on and on.\n\nThe latest craze is to submit posts in Spanish. I gotta go to Google and translate them all to make sure I'm not gonna post something which will land me in court. The Spanish post down the page called Castro a bastard. I suppost the Castro anti-defamation league will be contacting me soon.\n\nOr it could have been that the post just got lost in the flurry. Re-send it. I'll take a look.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Jenny Sullivan\n\ncomments: For the person who asked what Doc does for a living, he's a surgeon in Kingwood.

Turnbull was runner up to donahoe in fargo last year, I believe he lost 10-4, I think that was the score. But Turnbull has been at 119 this year....can he make 112? This is a great thing for WV wrestling, I think that WV is getting more exposure these days since PHS and South have been going to the top tournaments with guys placing there, and also with some guys placing at sr. nationals (Easter, Pickens, Courtney). And placing at Fargo(Mitch, A. Easter, Turnbull) Good job guys.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: Thats exactly right....some guys in the state are like 40-0 and stuff like that, but as you can see, no PHS or South wrestler is undefeated. Some guys that are undefeated will lose to someone with some curly number in the loss column. Thats why I personally think that people are underestimating sean smith,norman, walters, robert shyver, ryan dearman, lindamood ect. The most wrestler I think is under rated is chance litton, I've seen him a couple times this year and he is amazing to watch, very aggressive. The pill is a good way for the tournament, like posters have said before, the true champ will win no matter what the pill. And going off topic here, although I dont agree with Waldo Ino about Walters being the best in AAA, I do have to say that his state title a couple years ago was one match I remember. After losing to him in the regionals like 9-3 or somethin, he beat him in the state finals in OT.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: While Rash is an excellent wrestler, he placed 2nd at the WSAZ tourney, and I believe that is his only loss.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Not politicallly correct\n\ncomments: Sorry, I was not bashing the Patriot as a mascot. I just think some people in this country have gone way overboard in their \"political correctness\" stance. I guess we should just name all teams for inanimate objects, so no one can get upset. I just don't see what damage is being done to Native Americans by having them represent a school when it is done as a matter of pride. I don't see schools picking out groups who are, unfortunately, part of our history to represent them such as the KKK, Nazis, the Al Quida, etc. The reason they are not picked is because no one certainly wishes to honor them in any way. Therefore, most schools pick honorable groups to use as their tradition. There certainly were Native Americans in West Virginia, and they are looked upon favorably in history. Let's see, following some reasoning, the following terms can be used: Wheeling Park Nails, Beckley Mines, Capital Laws, Parkersburg Glass, Paden City Marbles, Huntington Railroad, Elkins Lumber, and it goes on. Please, it can get ridiculous. By the way, Parkersburg High School did consult with some Native Americans re the use of the Indian and were instructed on the correct way to do the War Dance. And to the Patriot supporter: since I am descended from some Vikings from way back, I have a problem with Mad Max wearing the Viking helmet when he runs around supporting his team. (I am kidding about that, so don't get upset.) I am dropping this from this point on, but had to be the Devil's Advocate on this one.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: region2 fan\n\ncomments: Does anyone know what the score was of the match between Cumpston and Greynolds?\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: Iron\n\ncomments: South Wrestling Fan: What about the Washington Redskins ?theyre still there with no name change.

Mascots: I'm not a native american. I'm not a PHS grad. I don't see that I have a dog in the fight. For those of you who do spend your time worrying about the correctness of the mascot, here's a suggestion: Take that time to sit down with your kid and review film, technique, and praise him/her. Don't have a kid? Grab a calculator and try to figure out what your time is worth, then estimate how much time you would spend worrying about the mascots, then send that money to your local youth wrestling program.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: PHS FAN\n\ncomments: I have heard rumors about phs being forced to changed there name and i did hear that if the did they would switch it from the big red indian to the big red engine to satisfy everyone.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\ncomments: Its doubtful that region 3 in AA/A could even come close in a dual match against a team of the 3 best teams in region 1, let alone will they claim 9 state championships.\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: wrestlefan60\n\ncomments: Regional Tournament Locations: Weekend of February 21, 2004\n\nRegion I\n\nSite: Morgantown High School\n\nDirector: Dan Erenrich, AD, Morgantown High School\n\nSchools: Brooke, Wheeling Park, John Marshall, Morgantown, University, Parkersburg South, Parkersburg\n\nRegion II\n\nSite: Martinsburg High School\n\nDirector: Greg Reed, AD, Martinsburg High School\n\nSchools: North Marion, Fairmont Sr., East Fairmont, Preston, Hedgesville, Martinsburg, Musselman, Jefferson\n\nRegion III\n\nSite: Buckhannon-Upshur High School\n\nDirector: Russell Warner, AD, Buckhannon-Upshur HS\n\nSchools: Buckhannon-Upshur, Elkins, Nicholas, Riverside, Woodrow Wilson, Greenbrier East, Robert C.

It would be impossible to compare records for schools that wrestle the majority of their matches out of state and seeding would be a nightmare. We often see wrestlers with more than a few losses during the regular season go on to win the state title.\n\nAs for the complaint about lost scoring opportunities for the 3rd place wrestler, it is possible for third place to score more than the Champion with bonus points. This is why consolation matches are so important and where championships are won. Copied the following examples from themat.com showing how third can score more than the Champion. It looks right to me. Someone correct me if it's not.\n\nPlacement points: 16-12-9-7-5-3\n\nWin in championship (except for 1st place) = 2\n\nWin in consolation (except for 3rd or 5th place) = 1\n\nBonus points (no matter what): 2 = pin, 1.5 = tech, 1 = major\n\nThe following scenario(s) could occur in the state tourney:\n\n-State title w/o bonus points = 22 (16 for first, 2x3 for advancing)\n\n-Third place w/ all falls (winning five straight in consis) = 23 points (9 for third, 10 for getting 5 pins, 4 for advancement through consi draw)\n\n-Third place w/ all falls (winning one champ, 4 consi) = 24 points (9 for third, 10 for getting 5 pins, 2 for adv in championship, 3 for adv in consi draw)\n\n-Third place w/ all falls (only losing in semis) = 22 points (9 for third, 8 for getting 4 pins, 4 for adv in championship, 1 for adv in consi draw)\n\nFebruary 17, 2004\n\nFrom: parkfan\n\ncomments: Rush and Humphrey are undefeated in the regular season, with Green's only loss in the finals of the OVACS.

The issue may be decided in court. There is currently a case in Oklahoma where a Native American group, AIM, with the backing of the ACLU (who else?) has pursued a law suit to the supreme court of that state banning any and all mascots or references to Native Americans in sports at any state supported institution, college, high schoool or otherwise. If they are winners,(and it looks that way) this sets the precedent for all other states to follow suit (pun?). Yes, Miami and St. Johns are now Redhawks and Red Storm respectively as a result of backing down from similar litigation. I don't see the state of WV, Wood County schools or the WVSSAC bucking a supreme court decison and going to bat for you. The surest way to make someone push the litigation would be to flaunt the connection. (ala Fla. States Tomahawk chop or PHS mascot with the drum). Perhaps a soft pedal approach may be in order. Don't get me wrong, I am on your side and think that a school that has had a mascot for years and shows no blatant disrespect should be allowed to continue. ACLU is a 4 letter word in my opinion! Kind of makes on wonder how Point Pleasant got away with their nickname all those year, doesn't it? Let's hope we are not all reduced to inanimate objects like Poca's Dot, Toledo's Rocket, or Tulane's Green Wave. One other point, you might want to check the WVSSAC regulations about noise makers anyway. We get a sheet in our coaches packets that lists what kind of signs and how many we can have, bans cowbells, balloons, etc. I'm sure that if someone would check it out the current info as to what is legal would decide the question at least for now. If it's legal, go for it. If not, the drum falls silent.\n\nJL/MMS\n\nP.S. Can someone post the results from the recent Clarksburg, DuPont, etc. youth tournaments please.

One of my friends does this sometimes when he thinks the forum has gotten a little dull. He'll make a simple, off-the-wall statement like, \"____ should be ranked #1\", or \"Everyone knows AAA Region 1 is weak\". It's basically harmless and some of the reactions can be very funny to read (makes me wonder if someone is just stirring stuff up for kicks about the drum banging and the mascot, or do they really feel the way they say). You may have noticed there are sections on this site to find legitimate updates and other information, but the forum is often filled with opinions, bold statements, and wacky stuff. I don't think the forum was intended to be straight up news or anything. We appreciate having a location where fans can say how they feel about something and can read what others are thinking, too, but remember that much of the talk is just noise.

Without human mascots that pretty much just leaves animals and objects, some of which are so abstract one has difficulty visualizing what it is, let alone rallying behind it as a powerful symbol. I guess I have never been in one of the mascot groups like Indians, Redskins, Warriors, etc., personally, however, I like to think these are chosen because of some fighting spirit or pride associated with them. What better compliment for a segment of society than to have a school want to identify with you? I don't believe anyone wants to identify themselves with groups they are trying to belittle. That would be ridiculous. We'd have mascots like \"Bums\", \"Prostitutes\", \"Morons\", etc. I don't think it was ever intended to negetively stereotype or demean. If \"Fighting Irish\" is a negative reference, then why didn't they go with \"Drunken Irish\" instead? Isn't that also the stereotype? It's because it wouldn't instill much pride. I never could understand why Stanford is, not a bird, a color- Cardinal. Some mascots are obviously chosen because of some play on words, like Poca \"Dots\". Many are chosen because of some historical significance, while most are probably chosen just because it is something feared or tough and has a nice ring to it. 4H went through this BS, too. It's a real shame that people seem so much more insensitive these days about real issues, yet they find a team mascot offensive. Stop being so false.\n\nFebruary 16, 2004\n\ncomments: Recently it was posted that Rush and Humphrey were undefeated in duals.

The issue I brought up had nothing to do with who wins the individual championship. I agree that the best wrestler should make it all the way. The point is that the pairings have more of an impact on who is 2nd or 3rd. I was pointing out that this year the team race in AAA may be so close that the 4 point difference between 2nd & 3rd may be the difference in which team wins the state. However, I still believe the pill system is the only way to do it. There is only 1 negative point to it that I can see, that is that some kids who deserve to be in the finals as a 2nd place wrestler have to settle for 3rd. I agree with the view that attempting to seed the tournament would be massively more unfair for all the variety of reasons that have been listed in prior posts for years. Seeding the tournament would be even less random than the pill and would add all the errors associated with human emotion and judgement(or misjudgement). After all, there would be almost as many possible seeding variations as there would be coaches making the decisions. And that is more than the possible variations with the pill. At least the pill is random and as fair as chance will allow.\n\nLet's look at one possible and interesting example that has been discussed on prior posts. Assume Smith of South at 152 wins region 1. Now, let's assume the South coach agrees that, since he has not met any of the other regional winners face to face and people have questioned him deserving a number 1 ranking, he be ranked 4th. How loudly do you think the Woodrow Wilson coach (or fans) would be arguing for their wrestler to be ranked number 1. You could substitute East Fairmont or Hedgesville or whoever into the above example if you wish. Obviously, seeding \"fairly\" in our state, given the discrepency of scheduling and competition is not possible. We have repeatedly seen the 28-0 wrestler finally meeting up with some true competition in the form of a 20-8 wrestler and discovering his imperfections for the first time. Nuff said.\n\nFebruary 16, 2004\n\nFrom: Lmob\n\ncomments: I think the problem that people have with the PHS \"indian\" is that he does his dance and cheer with his spear... maybe if he just stayed on the sideline, people would not complain as much... I can see why the term Big Red describing an indian mascot would be upsetting just as someone with chinese descent would not want a school to be called the Big Yellow with a chinese mascot...\n\nIf another school had a teamname that was stereotyped like the PHS Indian with a Chinese, African American, or Latino background, then people would be more up in arms about it...\n\nI'm not complaining really...

They've had some focus problems this season. When they've shined, they shined bright, as when they whupped St. Albans at the East Fairmont tourney, but it's been tough to keep that fire burning. But Do Not count them out. State qualifiers will be plenty, and Kesecker, Rader, and Bryant are all serious threats to place. All are capable of being top 3. The Griz has a way finding heart in tough battles. I know they'll show that heart this weekend in Buckhannon. So, Willis, Kesecker, Casto, Morton, Aquino, Rader, Dino, Corbitt, Rader, Bamm, and Big C: We love you guys and will be screaming our heads off for you this weekend.

First, I have submitted comments over one month ago regarding the concern for safety in the weight classes. I will not completely revisit those comments but will add that it is a shame that this issue has existed for so long, even before this year, and nothing has been done to address it. There are many good wrestlers in this weight class, that is 81 lbs. and up, who are not going to be able to demonstrate their abilities due to such a large weight discrepancy. My son has wrestled in the 100 lb. weight class most of this season, originally wrestled in the unlimited class, but wrestled the 162 lb. wrestler at the beginning of the season on two occasions. These are the only two losses he has had this season. Not only did he have a difficult time because of the weight difference, but the 162 lb. wrestler is a good wrestler. I don't want to take anything away from either one of them. However, I also think this other wrestler, who will remain unnamed, does not get to demonstrate his abilities as well when he is wrestling kids much smaller. I know my child would not be as aggressive if he were to wrestle a child weighing less than 30 lbs. which is the same weight difference as he and the other wrestler. This is not fair to either one of them or anyone else that will be in this \"Unlimited\" weight class at the Jr. State Tournament. We will still be there because my son wants to wrestle in the state tournament...he does not back down to many, if any, challenges. However, I hope and pray that no one gets hurt and you all will think, \"If only we had made the necessary changes.\" I understand there may be limitations on your part in regards to time constraints and such, but which is more important...extra work or children's safety? I know there are many of us who would be willing to do what we could to help, if needed, in order for all wrestlers to be more fairly matched and alleviate a safety hazard. If we don't hear anything else before, see you in March and we will see how it goes. Good Luck to all wrestlers...keep practicing hard, staying strong and give it all you got on the mat. That's all we can ask for or expect!!!\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\ncomments: The pill can make or break south or phs.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\ncomments: About east and west, I think they are both great teams.

I understand west side is a young team as well this year but they are doing great and hope both teams do great at states. As for east sides junior high team, they are great!! Can't wait for them to be in high school in two years!! I think east has great wrestlers which all the attention should go to the wrestlers.

Good luck to him the rest of the year and his next three years of high school. It is tough on the younger kids who happen to wrestle higher weights, as they are usually up against an 18 year old. Good for him for going out there and getting the experience. It will help him in the long run.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: Politcally Correct Fan\n\ncomments: Whoever posted the message re the Indian mascot for PHS needs to reexamine your thoughts. If you are taking that stance, then any team who uses anything other than an inanimate object, such as a Poca Dot, is misusing the mascot. I don't think that having a Native American as a mascot could be insulting to Native Americans when it is not being used in a disparaging manner, any more than Huntington using the Highlanders as a mascot would be disparaging to Scottish-Americans. I am quite sure that all wrestlers on that team are not all descended from Scottish immigrants. I am also equally sure that the nickname \"Patriots\" could not be used by a team if the standard was the one you must be assuming is politically correct. A Patriot represents the Americans who fought for our independence. So, would that then become an insult to those Patriots who are now being represented by Americans who did not have ancestors in that war? Your theory is one of those politically correct thoughts which do not hold up under examination.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\ncomments: I saw a youth team this weekend at both the Panther Prowl and the Young Guns Shoot-Out called the Backyard Brawlers, where are they from?

The ones who win, will be the ones who have been driven for years and have put in way more time than the dreamers.

Ward has a shot too, but cannot stop Smith's takedowns. Offense wins. Smith has beat Ward 3 out of 4 and the head game may be entering into play. Will be a few other placers but no one else fighting for the title. As a team in the big tournament Shady will do well but will not have enough balance to beat Oak Glen. Could finish as high as 2 or as low 6. We will see in two weeks.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: Robert Hickman\n\ncomments: Personally, I'd like to here some of the high school coaches opionions on seeding the state tournment. I'd bet the vast majority of them favor the pill system. Seeding meetings would lead to backroom deals that would be unbelieveable for the kids. Good debators would get the best seeds. Groups of coaches would gang up on common enemies and the kids would suffer. Just look at the disagreements on the posts received on this website on the predictions of the top six placers at the state tournament. Seeding is just predicting the order of finish. Do you really think the coaches could fairly agree with any hint of civility. I doubt it. Semi-final or final, you must win both to be crowned champ. The pill system has worked well, is not perfect, but is best for the fairness to the kids. If I'm wrong, let us hear from the coaches.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: Confused and Upset\n\ncomments: Why did they change the regional tournament to a one day thing.\n\nEditor's note: With the latest realignment of AAA and AA/A, some regions found themselves with only 8 teams. You can run an 8 man double elimination tournament in one day. You cannot run a double elimination tournament with more than 8 on the bracket in one day, lest you run afoul of the \"no more than 5 matches in one day\" rule. Most (all) of the AAA teams are down to 8 or fewer teams in a region.\n\nThere may be some AA/A regions which will still be running a two day tournament on Friday and Saturday. I don't know which will and which won't. Just because there are more than 8 teams in a region does not mean that there will be more than 8 on all the brackets. In years past on occasion it has not been known whether the tournament for a given region will be one or two days, until after the seeding meeting.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: parent\n\ncomments: to observer regarding the east-west controversity west will never be jealous of east in any sport. i hope you have all state champs . first of all west beat you allstarts in a dual with 5 freshmen 3 soph 2 sr is that dominating? noth marion beat east also in a dual. the only dominatance is in tour where you get wrestle backs. you almost didnt 2nd place in the ncac losing by 27 pts going into the last round against west. in college when a boy transfer he has to sit out a yr the same should be for high school. if a team is going to have a good yr theyll transfer. will'll see what happens in the state tour my opinion for east no state camps maybe 103 if luckey west will be back picking up 2 good asst coaches . if miller jr high could keep there kids from transfering or being recruited by other schools that would help. maybe you ought to go to parks. to recruit weat will beat east in football baseball basketball swimming and already beat them in wrestling. nothing pers! onal only bussiness.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: Big Red Fan\n\ncomments: To Brooke Bruin fan: What is the problem with beating the drum?

However, it didn't make the point I was trying to make. I'm not sure if it was because I used the names of wrestlers or what but it certainly seemed appropriate. I'll try to make my point without using specific names this time. I believe that the real deciding factor on who wins the state will not be whether certain marginal wrestlers make it to the states as they will not likely score much in the state tourny. The key between South and PHS is that several of South's extremely good wrestlers are in extremely tough weight classes where the top 4 or 5 guys in the state are all in this region. On the other hand, there are several of PHS's marginal wrestlers who will place as high 2nd or 3rd in the region while at the same time South's marginal wrestlers are also in tough weight classes. I believe that this sets up a very likely scenario where PHS will win the region by less than 10 points but South may very well win the state by as few as 10 points. Finally, I thus believe that South's chances in the regional will be dependant upon their better wrestlers doing slightly better than expected than certain other one doing more than might be possible for them at this point in their high school career.\n\nI'll add this since I have been reading this site for years but have only sent posts the past two weeks but have only had 3 of 6 posted and I can assure you they were not even remotely close to a lot of the nonsense that is sometimes sent in. For example, someone was able to send a post that Richey was going to win the state because he came out of nowhere last year and cited the names of the wrestlers he beat the 2nd time around. I merely pointed out that those individuals weren't Chance Litton and if the 2nd time aroud theory took effect then someone from South might be in Richey's way. With that said I beleive is a good wrestler and certainly has the potential to win it again. I'm curious if I can get a response as to problem with the posts or if they merely weren't received.\n\nFebruary 15, 2004\n\nFrom: South Wrestling Fan\n\ncomments: anon: What's with the CAPITAL letters you use in your post??

As we all know, many times 1st and 2nd is wrestled in the semis and with it appearing to be so close the small difference between 2nd and 3rd could be significant. For example, does Rush or Ewing get paired with Easter at 112, at 130 will Dunn have to face both Lodge and Durbin or will Lodge be in Rader's bracket, will Shaw and Gustines be in the same bracket at 135 or will it be Porter and Gustines, will Smith and Smith meet in the semis or finals of 140, at 189 will Lindamood have to get by Dellagatti or will that be Tominack's problem, and finally will Dearman and Valentine meet in the semis and give Dorton a better shot at the finals or will Valentine be another obstacle in Dorton's path. The possibilities could go on, and of course a lot of assumptions are being made to even consider them at this time. But, to some extent or another, they will come into play. And this year more than usual this may play a major role in who wins.\n\nFebruary 14, 2004\n\nFrom: Superman\n\ncomments: what exactly is so weird about learning a new move? It wasn't a regular slide-by it was something I had never seen before. It was very original. \"That Tyson Kid\" is very, very good. Really took me off guard. I wasn't expecting to see him perform like that, especially coming off an injury. He is a serious challenge for a title at 145.\n\nI am weird though, no denying it.\n\nFebruary 14, 2004\n\nFrom: hedgesvillefan\n\ncomments: I would like to congradulate Hedgesville on there wins at their quad today.

I was at the Jefferson Quad last night, and I saw what might have been the strangest thing I've ever seen.\n\nBarbour from Martinsburg is wrestling Tyson for Berkley Springs. Really a good match. That Barbour kid is really something, but I think his cardio gave out. Anyway that Tyson kid hit some slide-by on him like three times.\n\nThats not the strange thing. The strange thing is that \"Superman\" kid was there. And everybody knows he's a big Martinsburg fan. But after the match, off by the bleachers, I see Tyson, hitting slide-bys on Superman. It was really funny. I guess he needed to know how he did it. They weren't going live or anything, but he kept asking questions like \"what if I circle this way? or does it matter how tight the collar tie is?\" He couldn't let it go. Then afterward he was trying it on another Berkley Springs wrestler, their 52 pounder I think. It was just weird to see. I guess he learned a new move....LOL.\n\nSuperman=Superweird\n\nFebruary 14, 2004\n\nFrom: South Wrestling Fan\n\ncomments: WV Fan: Can't see JM's Richey beating PHS's Litton.Chance handled him well the first time and if you have been paying attention,wrestlers can't even score a point on Litton lately.He has been an animal on the mat and I see a state title for him!\n\nFebruary 14, 2004\n\ncomments: wv fan: Not when your name is chance litton, he straight dominates!!!\n\nFebruary 14, 2004\n\nFrom: Funk Nasty\n\ncomments: I would like to give a shout out to Sprout on being ranked and having a great season so far.

First of all, Cameron beat them in a dual meet, and have done a decent job in good quality tournaments. Plus Cameron can also beat Calhoun. I know there is a difference in a tournament and a dual, but look at all the returning placers cameron has, plus notice the improvement they have. Come on, how can you honestly think of williamstown to be up there? They even have a smaller lineup!\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: Brent Sams\n\nemail: brentster@casinternet.net\n\ncomments: ref: Tournament scoring\n\nThere are NO advancement points in the final round. Only additional place points and bonus points.\n\nThe editor's write up is accurate. One oversight is to add three place points when winning the consolation round before the consolation semi-finals. (I call it the consolation quarter-finals, but I don't think that is the right terminology.)\n\nAnother scoring quirk is when you have eight entries (or less) in a 16-man bracket, or four entries (or less) in an 8-man bracket. In these instances, there are no byes in the first round. For a round to be eligible for byes, someone has to wrestle in that round. If there are no matches wrestled in the round, then there are no byes. This is determined by each weight class.\n\nIt is also important to balance the bracket. Byes are only available in the first round of Championship and Consolation brackets. There should be no byes in the second round of either bracket. This can be somewhat confusing when you have seven wrestlers (or less) in a 16 man bracket. In this occurance, the second round becomes the first round for that weight class. To simplify (if possible at this point) the first round of a weight class is the round when an actually match is wrestled in that weight.\n\nHappy wrestling.\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: FAN\n\ncomments: The Ripley -VS- Cabell Midland wrestling match was a tough hard fought contest. I look for this dual to a big rivalry between the two teams for years to come. There assistant coach, Ward and Ripley's head Coach Scott, trained together for years. And obviously at the dual you can tell they don't like to lose to each other. This is what makes our sport better. Coach's who care and get there teams pumped up for big match's. Look for these two programs to get stronger and stronger.GOOD job kids and coaches.\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: Reader\n\ncomments: If shaw for Brooke bumped up to 2 weight classes to 145 can he still wrestle at 135 ?\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: hedgesvillefanm\n\ncomments: Want to wish the eagles good luck on tomorrows quad. Not sure what teams are going to be there other than boonsboro with there 4 wrestlers. Should be 1 good matchup there at least with Shetler vs. Nally could be really good match. Also want to congratulate the eagles on their victory over tuscarora a new team in their first year of wrestling ever. Anyway with regionals coming up hopefully everbody is cranking it up and getting ready for some real competition. If I don't get a chance to get on here before regionals, and with my work schedule I may not, I want to go ahead and wish the eagles good luck at regionals. It looks like East Fairmont and Fairmont Sr. are currently the odds on favorites to take 1st and 2nd but go out there and wrestle hard and try to get some upsets and who knows what will happen. Everyone was looking at Jefferson and East Fairmont coming into regionals the year that Hedgesville won so anything can happen. Still wish there would have been some better competition the last few weeks to get prepared for regionals but that's not something you wrestlers have any control over. So again good luck at regionals. Also want to wish good luck to all the eastern panhandle wrestlers at regionals. Dustin Haislip good luck and hope to see you on top the podium and same goes for Codie Gustines. Codie has done the work in the off season and really dedicated himself to this year from what I've seen and I'd love to see it pay off. Anyway again good luck to the eagles and all the eastern panhandle wrestlers. May good health, good times, good lessons learned and gold all come your way.\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: deer HUNTER\n\ncomments: dont bet all your marbles on Shyver at 125, a guy by the name of Jared Garvin is lookin pretty tough\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\ncomments: does anyone have any perdictions on AAA 135 region 4\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: Pburgeer\n\ncomments: Talking with someone closer than close to the PHS program.

Are team advancement points earned in the finals (championship and consolation)? For example, in the finals of tourny placing 6 spots the winner receives 16 team points for 1st place while the loser would earn 12 points for 2nd. If the winner wrestler were to have pinned his opponent he earn an additional 2 points, thus a total of 18 points (16 + 2). Would he also earn an additional 2 points for advancement in championship bracket or do advancement points end once the final pairings are reached. It is my recollection that these stop once the finals pairings are arrived at. The significance would be that the 12 points for second would be equalled by a 3rd place finisher who pinned (9+2+1= 12).\n\nEditor's note: 2 team advancement points shall be scored for each match won in the champoinship bracket, except for the final first-place match. If a wrestler receives a bye in the first round, he shall be awarded 2 advancement points for that round if he wins his next match.\n\n1 team advancement point shall be scored for each match won in the consolation elimination, except for the final third and fifth place matches. A wrestler who has received a bye in the consolation round shall receive one advancement point, provided he wins his next round match.\n\n2 additonal points for each match won by default, disqualification, fall, or forfeit.\n\n1 1/2 points for each match won by technical fall.\n\n1 additional point for each match won by maor decision.\n\nPlacement points:\n\nTournament scoring 4 places: 14-10-7-4\n\nTournament scoring 6 places: 16-12-9-7-5-3\n\nTournament scoring 8 places: 16-12-9-7-5-3-2-1\n\nSource: National Federation Rule Book\n\nHere's a quirky thing about the rules. \"Individual placement points shall be awarded as soon as earned. Placement points already earned shall be deducted in case of forfeit (other than injury) or disqualification from the tournament.\"\n\nThat means that winners of championship quarterfinals in a tournament scoring 6 places have 3 team place points added to their team score, since these winners have already earned at least 6th place. Then if the championsip quarter final winner wins his semifinal, his team gets an additional 9 points added, since he is guaranteed at least second place (12 place points, already has the three, so he gets 9 more). The loser of the championship semifinal match scores no more place points as a result of the loss, but he drops down to the consolation semifinal bracket. If he wins his consolation semifinal match, he scores an additional 4 points added, since he is guaranteed at least fourth (7 place points, already has the three, so he gets 4 more). Winners of championship finals have 4 place points added to the team score, since their team already received 12 points for the guaranteed second place earlier in the tournament. Etc.\n\nIn reality, it works like this:\n\nChampionship quarterfinal winners: Add 3 points\n\nChampionship semifinal winners: Add 9 points\n\nChampionship final winners: Add 4 points\n\nConsolation semifinal winners: Add 4 points\n\nConsolation final winners (for third): Add 2 points\n\nWinner of final for 5-6: Add 2 points\n\nThis is why the top teams jump out to a big lead after the semifinal round, as this is where the point bonanza resides.\n\nThis leads to a curious phenomenon of team points going on the scoreboard before the first match is wrestled. For example, in a tournament scoring 6 places - if some bracket only has 6 wrestlers in it, then every wrestler on that bracket is guaranteed at least 6th place, and the points are on the scoreboard before the first match is wrestled. Tournaments which are scored on computer will have team scores printed out this way. This has happened in AAA Region I in recent years, and some fans were puzzled that some teams had points and were in the lead before the tournament even began!! But, that's the way it is.\n\nAttention Brent Sams: Correct me if I'm wrong...\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\ncomments: I had the opportunity to watch the much talked about PHS team Wednesday night and I hate to say I was shocked that they were even better than I had heard. There 189 kid is very physical, I would hate to have to knock heads with him very much. Litton is unstoppable. Ewing kid is a huge 112. The kid is good. South is loaded again, too. It will be interesting come states.\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\ncomments: I want to say good luck to the South and PHS wrestling teams at regionals and states. Both teams deserve this little break they have after the rigorous schedules both teams have wrestled. Keep in good health, and we'll see ya at states!!\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: Rebel Fan\n\ncomments: Congratulations to Ritchie County's HWT Brad Swiger and 215 Travis Boone on their 100th victories tonight at the Williamstown Quad.....Good Luck to all the Rebels at the Regionals and States\n\nFebruary 13, 2004\n\nFrom: 500\n\ncomments: I agree with south wrestling fans post.
