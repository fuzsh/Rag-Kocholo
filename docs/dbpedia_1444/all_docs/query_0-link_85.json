Moore, Chairman of the New Hanover Historical Commission, and a member of the Club. The Club thanks Mr. Moore for placing on record these facts and amusing incidents of the past one hundred years.\n\nCarolina Yacht Club\n\n1853 - 1953\n\nBY LOUIS T. MOORE Chairman, New Hanover Historical Commission\n\nIn a conscientious effort faithfully to portray the venerable and honorable life of such a representative organization as The Carolina Yacht Club, of Wilmington, and Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, one is confronted at the outset with the rather disturbing fact of the lack of official records to cover a century of existence which ends with the summer of 1953.\n\nUnfortunately the actual official minutes of the first twenty years of existence after 1853, the year of organization, appear to have been lost. There are at hand several aged minute books. These cover fairly well the career of the Club to the year 1906. Thereafter, the records are intact and of a nature to merit careful future preservation.\n\nWith the foregoing explanation of actual difficulties and problems which confront one who has every intention of presenting as far as possible direct life acomplishments of an organization so historic as The Carolina Yacht Club, with some fear and trepidation we will now enter upon the task. There is full purpose and objective of formulating a record which may represent, at least, a verbal human interest picture of a family club in the true sense of the word. It is certainly pleasing to know it is an organization ranking next to two others in this country, in its founding and aspirations.\n\nWith a membership now of approximately six hundred, consisting principally of residents of Wilmington, the Club is a colorful, unique, and widely known unit among institutions of such nature. The year 1953 marks the formal observance of the one hundredth anniversary. It stresses as well, ten decades of genuine entertainment and service to the personnel, with accompanying unbounded enjoyment by those so fortunate as to possess membership. This statement also is based on the fact that for a period of twelve to fifteen years prior to actual unification in 1853 those who founded the association were yachting companions, both on and off the waters of Wrightsville Sound, and the Cape Fear River. During the period of time mentioned, and prior to actual organization, the founders planned and held races near the ocean and on the broad waters of the Cape Fear River.\n\nIn recording history sometimes it would be pleasing if one could present wishes rather than actual facts. However, if he is to be entirely correct it must be admitted that The Carolina Yacht Club is the third to have been formed in this country. It is neither the first nor the second, as many have hoped and some have professed to believe.\n\nIllustrative of the controlling thought which motivates the publication of this review it should be remembered that old Omar Khayyam, a\n\ngifted poet, prior to his death in 1123, undoubtedly in reference to the importance of truthful recording of history, gave forth the following verse:\n\n“The moving Finger writes on; and having writ,Moves on; nor all your Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a line,Nor all your tears wash out a Word of it.”\n\nSo, no matter how many regretful tears we may shed we cannot wash out a single word of the following facts.\n\nTo establish beyond question the relative positions as regards first, second, and third places in the lives of the three recognized yacht clubs generally given the preference, this recorder decided to communicate with officials of the New York and the New Orleans Yacht Clubs.\n\nFrom the organization in the northern metropolis came the following reply: “In response to your recent inquiry please be advised that the New York Yacht Club was organized and chartered in the year 1843 and has been in continuous operation since that time.”\n\nIn answer to the inquiry sent to New Orleans came a prompt response from the Executive Director of the Southern Yacht Club: “In reference to your letter of April 23, please accept the statement that our charter shows and proves that the Southern Yacht Club was organized in the year 1849. This organization also is known and recognized as the second oldest yacht club in the United States.”\n\nSo, there is the record which speaks for itself. It demonstrates and establishes the fact that The Carolina Yacht Club is the third in order of formation, in the country. Until there comes a time when it is possible to juggle figures so that 1853 is accepted as a date definitely prior to 1843 and 1849, history as already written must be accepted as Truth.\n\nHere is a point, however, which can always be regarded with pride, not only by members of The Carolina Yacht Club but by the people of Wilmington as well! For the then small town of Wilmington in 1853 with a population hardly in excess of 6,500, to have ranked itself with New York, then as now the largest city in the United States, and with New Orleans, which a hundred years ago also was a city with many times the population Wilmington possessed, and to follow so closely in their footsteps in perfecting an active, flourishing yachting organization, was an acomplishment of no mean proportions indeed. It was, and is, one which our North Carolina “City by the Sea” can ever reflect upon with pardonable joy and unbounded gratification.\n\nAs a matter of record it is interesting to know and to realize that when The Carolina Yacht Club was formally launched in 1853, there were only seven active and enthusiastic yachtsmen, co-founders of the club. They were John Reston, Richard Bradley, Daniel Baker, Parker Quince, Richard J. Jones, Talcott Burr and T. M. Goodman. These gentlemen, with others of their friends and associates, held frequent and closely contested races for a few years.\n\nThe lowering clouds of the fratricidal strife which resulted in The War Between The States, 1861-1865, brought complete cessation of the Club's activities. Many of the original members answered the tocsin of war, responding to go to the defense of their beloved Southland.\n\nIt is (and justifiably so), a proud claim of the Club that it not only weathered the storms of the great struggle mentioned, but that it also passed, unhurt, through four other conflicts. These were the Spanish-American strife in 1898, World Wars I and II, and the Korean War. At the conclusion of each of the first mentioned four great misunderstandings, the Club was alerted. Each time it became more aggressively active in the development and advancement of yacht racing than had ever before been attempted.\n\nThe first post war regatta was held on July 4, 1866. This was less than sixteen months after the South had yielded to superior forces and resources. Records indicate that the entries were three in number. The names of the yachts were the Carolina, the Retta, and the Annie. It seems right and proper that Carolina's star even then was in the ascendancy as the craft of that name was the winner in this initial post war sports event.\n\nAs time passed there was born a desire and spirit to further liberalize and make more attractive and effective a widening influence in the sphere of yacht racing. Therefore decision was reached to apply for a new and more comprehensive charter. This new bill of sailing rights was filed in the Superior Court of New Hanover County, June 21, 1873.\n\nJust at this point it may be advisable and in order to glance backward to 1853. That was the year when the Club actually was formed. Unfortunately and regrettably, the minute books for the period 1853-1873, are not available and presumably have been lost. There may be a reasonable and acceptable explanation for this situation.\n\nMr. Norwood Giles, an honored member of the Club for many years, spent a great part of his life in Wilmington. Later he resided in New York. In the early eighteen eighties Mr. Giles was prompted to prepare a sketch of the organization. Undoubtedly he must have asked that original minute books be sent to him so that he could check certain facts and dates. If this was done, then in some way return of the records must have been overlooked by employes of Mr. Giles in his New York offices. This is probably the most reasonable assumption which can be offered as to a possible reason why the documents for the twenty years noted cannot be found.\n\nNevertheless, the results of Mr. Giles’ research were incorporated in a delightfully prepared paper of voluminous nature. His effort was based on a study of the Club records, now unfortunately lost. Therefore, it will be necessary and in order to consult his production to preserve a form of continuity in the development of this narrative.\n\nMr. Giles’ account seems to have emphasized in far greater detail actual races and the results of same, rather than to furnish a complete and detailed record of the real historical development of the body. As\n\nregards actual reference data there is necessarily an absence of same in his paper which is accounted for by the explanation just outlined.\n\nMr. Giles recites the fact that Mr. Richard Bradley was the first Commodore. It was then believed that through regular club races it would be decided who was the most skilled sailor and where was anchored the swiftest yacht. In lieu of settling such problems, however, it was developed rather that every member of the new organization appeared to be a natural genius, and every boat a champion in the true sense of the word.\n\nFor a decade prior to 1853 the Sounds had been ruled consecutively by the Abovna, owned by R. J. Bernard; Saucy Jack, owned by Richard Bradley; Little Girl, owned by Captain Gautier, and Sue, by Hazel Burgwin.\n\nThe Sue is said to have been the first cat boat ever floated on Wrightsville waters. This craft developed great speed. It demonstrated quite early in its career the capacity and qualities of boats of this particular variety. It also was the first in local waters to possess the innovation of a center board. It has been handed down as a fact that the crew members saw the bottom of this board about as frequently as its top.\n\nFollowing many notable victories of the Sue it was retired and the Eliza Ann made its appearance. This was an open keel boat and the owner, Mr. Henry Bradley, thought it perfection. There are many legends of its wonderful performances as recounted in season and out by its proud owner. Among other characteristic memories, Mr. Bradley, who was a “Greenville Sounder,” ejaculated that when he sailed his craft over to Masonboro residents of the latter resort tightly drew in their blinds to shut out so odious an object as his boat.\n\nThe Columbia was owned by Mr. Talcott Burr. It proved to be a special rival of the Eliza Ann. These two boats had many closely contested races for the championship. It was while this latter boat was in its glory that organization of the Club was perfected in 1853.\n\nA short time later a yachting event of interest was the defeat of the Eliza Ann by the Young American. This latter boat was owned by Captain C. D. Ellis. It was the first regularly fitted yacht in this section, was decked, and completely rigged as a sloop. This craft was looked upon as a marvel of speed and elegance.\n\nIn 1854 Mr. Daniel Baker was elected Commodore. It was in that year that Mr. Parker Quince, of Masonboro, built a boat or canoe of three logs pinned together. This he called the Jennie Q, probably because it bore such a “Q”-rious appearance. Strange as it may seem this craft developed considerable speed. As time passed it was the winner in contests with other well known local boats. The master proved to be a bragging mate. Through his boastings he is said to have incurred the mortal hate of many an envious rival.\n\nThe next most popular boat to be developed was La Favorite. It was clinker built and originally was intended as a fishing craft. Its accomplishments at Savannah, however, were such as to win admiring comments.\n\nMr. Richard Bradley purchased and fitted it as a yacht. In 1855 La Favorite undoubtedly was the smartest gem in the fleet. The season was one of great excitement and strenuous competition. La Favorite was the pride of the waters. It not only defeated all the old boats but the newer ones, as well, when the latter made their appearance. This speedster probably secured its name from Donizetti's great opera, “La Favorita,” which was very popular at the time.\n\nThe Flying Cloud (undoubtedly named for one of the most famous of the Clipper ships then sailing the seven seas), built in 1851, was quite a handsome yacht. Among its numerous fittings was a small closet at the stern. There the Commodore kept what he called a “Life Preserver.” This arrangement which may have been liquid and possibly enclosed in a bottle, the generous officer refused to patent. It was not long before all other boats in use are said to have infringed upon the plan and to have installed one for the enjoyment of all crew members.\n\nIn 1856 came the downfall of La Favorite at the hands of the Twilight, of Masonboro. This boat was the property of John Quince, by whom it was splendidly handled. It had an iron center board which was very hard to manage. It so mutilated the fingers of the crew of Masonboro boys that not one could pick a banjo, or quitar, with any degree of comfort.\n\nIn 1857 General Alexander MacRae was elected Commodore. It was then whispered that Mr. Bradley soon would have another boat which would “clean up” the Sound. It was bought by Mr. Jos. Flanner, who presented it to Mr. Bradley. The cost is said to have been about $700. It was built in New York by “Bob” Fish.\n\nThis particular boat is said to have been of strange design, resembling somewhat a great smoothing iron. It had a bow sprit hanging twelve feet over the cut water. As this craft had beaten all rivals in and around New York there was great local excitement when it appeared on the waters of the Sounds adjacent to Wilmington. It is interesting to know that this rather strange and unusual marine production was called the Princess. It is said never to have been beaten in subsequent races, although many yachts were bought, or especially built, to defeat her.\n\nIn the Winter of 1859 another strange model was produced by Mr. Sol. Morse. This was thought to be perfect in design and construction. It was named the Carolina and proved speedy and very reliable. Mr. T. M. Gardner was Commodore of the Club during the season of 1859. The Carolina now took first position among the Club's fast craft. It maintained this position in 1860, when Mr. Gardner was reelected Commodore.\n\nIt was in the early summer days of 1861 that the tide of war swept over the land. This called for the services of many of the best members and their boats. The military took possession of the yachts. A roll call after the war showed the following absent: Flying Cloud, owned by Daniel Baker; Twilight, owned by W. A. Wright; Alice Haigh, William Lippitt; Sand Crab, C. C. Morse; Fiddler, E. Savage; Eleanor, John and William Giles; Atlanta, C. & N. Giles; Hiawatha and Princess, Richard\n\nBradley; Vashti, R. H. Grant; Rob Roy, Thomas Wright; Dewdrop, General Alexander MacRae; Mollie, Dr. Wm. B. Meares; Undine, George Harriss, and Callie, owned by J. J. Conolly.\n\nNotwithstanding unsettled conditions and vexatious times which followed the termination of the war, the Club lived. On July 4, 1866 Commodore Gardner lined up the following named boats for action: Carolina, Retta, and Annie. The Carolina was declared winner.\n\nIn the following six years the Club was guided by Mr. Henry Burkheimer as Commodore. Due to depressed economic conditions there was not a very great amount of interest manifested in the organization. However, the annual Fourth of July Regatta was not overlooked. During this period there was continuing rivalry between the Carolina and the Retta. The apathy mentioned was in no wise due to the fault of Commodore Burkheimer. It resulted from understandable conditions which had followed the recent great conflict.\n\nThe point in the Club's history is now reached where the general review prepared by Mr. Giles reaches a conclusion. Thereafter, and until approximately 1906 there is available for consultation and reference, minute books of the association. These cover about thirty years, following which records for the more modern decades are on file.\n\nThe effort, henceforth, will be to stress as far as possible, human interest incidents as revealed by the somewhat musty tomes of “ye olden time.” When such references are called to his attention, the reader should remember that every point was deemed quite important. So much so as to justify consideration by the Governing Board, or one of several active committees.\n\nHere and there a paragraph might be incorporated, the effect of which may be to bring a smile to the countenance of the reader. In such instances it should be well remembered that each and every incident was considered of sufficient seriousness to justify attention by those who were in charge of the organization's affairs. There will be no special effort to indulge in fun or humor. The reader is warned in advance that some of the points to be developed, at least will cause him to wonder if definite, careful, analytical consideration of each and every subject was not the best procedure, after all.\n\nIn the spring of 1873, the Little Walter, later called the Restless, appeared upon the scene. This was one of the most elegantly fitted and best equipped boats ever to be shown locally. It was what is known as a “Philadelphia cat.” It was fifteen feet long and equipped with an immense sail. After a few upsets on the Cape Fear river, the owner, Walter Coney, announced that he was ready to pit her against the best local boats then afloat. In the first race this craft clearly out distanced all contestants. It reached “The Dram Tree” buoy, on the Cape Fear river, without shifting a sail. Its triumph was entire and complete. This particular boat was deemed a marvel and repeatedly led the fleet in many a contest.\n\nIn June of 1873 it was deemed advisable to more definitely organize the club and to secure a charter most liberal in its general terms. This\n\nwas effected and renewed interest was the immediate result. The formal application was filed. It set forth that it was desired “to form a Private Corporation,” the name of which was to be continued as “The Carolina Yacht Club.”\n\nIt was outlined in the document that the principal place of business was to be “on the banks of Wrightsville Sound, about east of the mouth of Lee's (Bradley's as it is now generally designated) Creek, on the waters of said Wrightsville Sound, extending North and South at the pleasure of said Corporation, and on the waters of the Cape Fear River, within the Counties of New Hanover and Brunswick.”\n\nFollowing the action noted there was an immediate revival of interest, which result greatly pleased everyone.\n\n“In the golden haze of the olden days,” as now, social features were important attributes. In the fifties and late sixties of the past century manuscripts reveal many references to “Banks’ Parties.” So they were known at that time. Members would sail from the mainland to what is now Wrightsville Beach. There they would spend the days and evenings, and enjoy such pleasures as bathing, fishing, and crabbing, always to be followed with an appetizing spread of succulent dishes, fruits, etc.\n\nJust at this point it might be of interest to note the cycles of variation which have marked access to “The Banks” since The Carolina Yacht Club was organized in 1853. In the first quarter of a century, or even longer, sail boats had to be utilized to reach the seaside destination. Then, during the next period a snorting, puffing little steam engine which drew a succession of toy like passenger coaches, carried pleasure seekers from their homes in Wilmington to the Beach, which at that particular time was commencing to display signs of the really remarkable development that has come with passing years. Next, one finds the installation of a modern high power electric trolley system, which, with cars of adequate size and travel comfort, served to accommodate a steadily increasing volume of traffic. About a quarter of a century ago modern demands necessitated abolition of the trolley system. It was succeeded with the installation of a causeway across the marshes. This now furnishes access to Wrightsville Beach, supplemented with a modern automobile highway of dredged materials, hard surfaced, which parallels the western shore of the island resort.\n\nAfter the new charter had been secured and a small club house erected on “The Banks,” (as Wrightsville Beach of today then was known), in the minutes of 1873 it is set forth that 29 keys to the building were furnished as many members. It was in this same year unanimous agreement was recorded to adopt as the Club flag a white ground, with red star in the center.\n\nOrders were issued to prepare a sufficient number of flags so that every boat sailing on the Fourth of July would be in position to fly one of the club emblems at the mast-head. For the regatta in that particular year three prizes were awarded to the several boats finishing first, second, and third.\n\nIt was soon discovered that the number of keys originally ordered was insufficient. A new requisition was authorized. This increased the total of available keys to a half hundred.\n\nAt this period a ruling also was adopted, which limited the length of the boats to twenty feet. It was also decided to have the Club purchase two prizes, “at a very moderate price,” to be awarded winners in the approaching August regatta.\n\nThe records disclose at that time, less than a decade after “The War,” all of the families in the Club had Negro family servants. These colored people were highly respected by their employers. In many instances the latter had been former owners of their servants, prior to the abolition of slavery.\n\nAmong the yacht owners were many who were desirious of using these faithful employes in some capacity on their boats. This question was placed before the members for decision. While there was a decided difference of opinion, as disclosed in the minutes the decision was recorded in this wise: “The subject of allowing Negroes to act as sailing Masters of yachts was brought up. It was agreed by majority vote not to allow Negroes to act in any official capacity on board yachts, or on the club grounds.” Aside from formal races, however, many members used their servants as crew members or handy men aboard the yachts.\n\nAn interesting reference to the apparent slowness of one of the boats is attested by the following extract: “For the Gazette was reserved the honor of bearing the Anchor home, as a memento of established tardiness.”\n\nThe initiation fee “is declared to be $5.” It is interesting to know that this preliminary required payment remained at that figure for many years. As a direct comparison of prices then and now, there is a payment item which declares, “four kegs of lager, sixteen dollars,” whereas today one is required to pay twenty-five cents for a bottle which holds a few ounces only.\n\nThe minutes show that William A. Wright, Esq., was elected Commodore in 1874. It was shortly after the annual meeting in that year that Mr. J. M. Cazaux secured his fine yacht, Rosa. It was not very successful as a cat boat, and was beaten in the first three races. Afterward when sloop rigged this racer proved to be very fleet and almost a sailing marvel in light weather. Its performances on the Cape Fear River, where races were first held, are especially worthy of note. On that stream this craft won continuously from other boats.\n\nThe Ripple, built in New York for Mr. Norwood Giles, was launched locally in 1875. It had a beam of 8½ feet and length of 18½ feet. In the first annual race in which it was entered the Ripple lost by a slight margin. It is recorded as a fact, however, that this is the only annual race which this particular boat failed to win. It was awarded the Championship Flag in 1875 and held the emblem for two years without suffering a defeat. It is interesting to know that the time made by this boat in one race of 1 hour, 24 minutes, and 1 second, was the best on\n\nrecord prior thereto and for many years later. This boat was credited with more victories than any other craft on the Club register.\n\nWhile Mr. Giles was entirely too modest to capitalize on the position he held in the local racing world, nevertheless it can be stated with candor and truth that he was regarded as the greatest local sailor of his time.\n\nIn the early nineties Mr. Giles sold the Ripple to Mr. George Chadbourn. This boat won the July 4 race of 1895, which gave her at least twenty years of successful sailing.\n\nAfter disposing of the Ripple, Mr. Giles purchased the Pirate, in Boston, where it had been a great race winner. She was the fastest boat in these waters but was too large for the Sounds and did not win many races.\n\nUntil 1910 all races were started from the shore. All boats were in the same general class and were handicapped, based on their stated overall length. During the period of about 1890 to 1899 the smallest boat, which was usually the Sprite, started first and the largest, the Pirate, last. To win, this particular largest boat had to pass all the others, which was often impossible in the local restricted waters.\n\nIn the year 1910, or possibly a year or two later, largely upon the insistence of Mr. T. P. Hammer, (who had just moved to Wilmington from Philadelphia), the flying start was adopted. Thereafter handicaps were based on the combination of load, water line, length, and the square root of sail area.\n\nDuring the great storm of 1899 the Pirate was floated out of her boat house on Lee's (Bradley's) Creek. The boat continued its storm driven journey toward, and into the trestle spanning the marshes. A part of the skeleton is still there.\n\nIt is recorded on May 3, 1875 that the owners of all yachts entering races were requested to provide, or have provided, uniforms for their respective crews. A committee was selected to devise and adopt a uniform belt for the members to use, with the letters “C.Y.C.” on it.\n\nEven at that early date the comfort and convenience of spectators at the yacht races appears to have been a matter of prime consideration. It is shown in the minutes for 1875 that Mr. Norwood Giles was appointed a committee of one to examine the condition of the club house. He was authorized to have a shed built on the west side of “The Banks” for the accommodation of spectators at the races.\n\nThe minutes dated Thursday, May 27, 1875 state: “The first Regatta of the season took place on this date on the Cape Fear River. The run was from a buoy in the river opposite Market Street dock, thence to, and around, a buoy opposite ‘The Dram Tree’ and return, and repeat, being an overall distance of eight miles.”\n\nThen came the report of that very important committee which had been appointed to consider the question of uniform belts, etc. The report stated that there had been obtained samples of belts and that one had been adopted which would suit admirably. It was to be of white ground, with blue edge. The belts were to be purchased at a cost of\n\nten dollars per dozen. It was made obligatory for each and every member of the Club to wear the insignia on regatta days. “Forty belts were ordered, each one to be paid for as delivered and accepted.”\n\nOther forms of races were not overlooked. This, despite the fact that the principal degree of interest, as a matter of course, centered around yacht racing. The minutes for June 15, 1875 said: “In the four-oar boat race, gotten up under the auspices of the Club, and which took place immediately after the Regatta, there were six boats entered. These drew their positions in order. The Mary Wheeler came in first, finishing the course in remarkably fast time and was awarded the first prize of twenty dollars. The course was from Market dock buoy, around a buoy opposite Kidder's Mill.”\n\nMarch 23, 1876 an interesting item is disclosed. It indicates that the question of ownership of the property was a vital one, even at that comparatively early stage of the Club's life, “Resolved that a Committee of three be appointed to inquire into, and if practicable, procure a title to that portion of Wrightsville Banks, upon which has been erected the wharf, the club house, etc. of the organization.”\n\nThe same minutes reveal a very thoughtful and graceful action. Undoubetedly, this was largely inspired by the recipient's brilliant record while serving in the Confederate States’ Navy: “Resolved that Captain John Newland Maffitt, of Wilmington, and Captain W. B. Whitehead be, and the same are hereby elected Honorary Members of this Club.”\n\nDuring the summer of 1876 it was stated that “The Banks” had been purchased at Sheriff's sale by Mr. George Harriss, Sr. However, he is said to have felt as binding prior claims to the property which formerly had been held by Mr. John A. Sanders.\n\nA deed was submitted in which the members sought to purchase from ocean to sound, a strip of land one hundred feet in width, with the privilege of using an additional five hundred feet on each side of the parcel.\n\nThere was a vast amount of correspondence relative to the proposal. For a time the result was an agreement on the part of the owners to permit the Club to use the property in question. There was a reservation that the owners would have the privilege of entering at their pleasure and of having their friends do likewise, when such privileges did not interfere with actual functions of the association. This adjustment was the best the Club could secure at the particular time the effort was made. It was deemed advantageous for all purposes and an agreement along the general lines set forth, was entered into.\n\nThe minutes for August 4, 1877 state: “the Rosa beat the Ripple in this race, running to Fowler's Point and back. This was the only race in the history of the Club which ever was run through Masonboro Inlet.”\n\nThe yacht Ripple also seems to have continued its winning ways throughout this season. There is a notation under date of Sept. 22, 1876: “The Ripple's time is the fastest by six minutes and fourteen seconds ever made on the course.”\n\nAs all good structures, soonor or later, must face a similar condition, it is shown on the minutes for May 7, 1878, that Father Time was getting the better of the club house. At that time the structure had survived on “The Banks” for a number of years. It is stated: “The Banks’ House at Wrightsville is badly in need of general repairs. A committee is to be appointed by the Commodore to solicit financial aid from all the citizens of Greenville, Masonboro and Wrightsville Sounds, and Wilmington, who are connected with the Club. This anticipated aid is to be used to repair the Banks’ House.”\n\nIn May of 1878 the organization sustained a great loss in the death of its venerable and beloved aged Commodore, Mr. William A. Wright. He had held the position for four years prior to his death.\n\nCaptain I. B. Grainger was then chosen for the position which had been vacated by death. He entered upon his duties with a spirit of enthusiasm and genuine ardor which augured well for future results. He served not only as Commodore but also as Master of the Yacht Foam. Unfortunately, he died in August of the same year. The Club thus suffered the misfortune of losing two of its esteemed Commodores within a period of three months.\n\nNo election was held to fill the second vacancy within such a short space of time, in the highest office in the gift of the body. Mr. O. A. Wiggins, second officer, served as Commodore for the balance of the season in 1878. This gentleman was chosen officially for the position in May of 1879. He continued to fill the office with credit to himself and satisfaction to his associates, until May of 1884. At that time he was succeeded by Pembroke Jones, Esq.\n\nNext, there is a reference which should be heralded with the sound of popping corks, “June 12, 1878.—After the distribution of the regular prizes had been concluded, the champagne was opened and toasts were drunk to the new Commodore, the Club, and to the different yachts of the squadron.” All of which brings the fleeting thought that while all the members were not in such condition at all, nevertheless the “frequent toasts were pretty well drunk.”\n\nTo judge from the following extract one is rather forced to the conclusion that the old adage, “while the cat is away, the mice will play,” is more or less applicable to the revealed situation: “The Commodore reported regretfully and mournfully that the janitor had been drunk and laid the case before the meeting. After motion the janitor was discharged.” The action as taken at least must have provided one more recruit for the militant prohibition forces, at a later period to be so valiantly led by redoubtable Carrie Nation, the doughty feminine hatchet wielder from the Middle West, as she attacked wet beverage spots in her continued effort to “dry up” the country.\n\nThen, as well as in later days the Purser was having his personal troubles in persuading members to pay their dues with “rectitude and promptitude.” Undoubtedly, in a manful effort to lift him from the financial morass where he might unceremoniously have been dumped,\n\nthe organization adopted the following: “Resolved that dues unpaid for the years previous to 1879 be remitted. In consideration thereof the Purser shall drop from the list of members the names of all parties who fail to pay dues for the year of 1879.”\n\nOne can consider and recall the rather liberal salaries and allowances of the average wage earner of today. Certainly his most tender sympathy would be extended a person who now might find himself in the same position, (as regards compensation), of the janitor who was serving the Club in the (for him), troubulous year of 1879. Maybe our readers will smile at the pay which was given him.\n\nThis is the actual record of the action taken at a meeting on August 2, 1879: “The Commodore shall appoint any suitable person to take charge of the club house and keep the same clean and in repair. The said person shall be at liberty to charge FIVE CENTS (capitals ours) of all persons who enter the club house, (excepting members of the club). The said fee of five cents is to be retained by the person so appointed, for and in consideration of his keeping the club house clean and in repair as before stated and required.”\n\nThe following items are rather unique and interesting. They disclose some of the services which were furnished the club members back in those halcyon days of 1877-1879:\n\n“Paid to Virgil MacRae, for transporting fresh drinking water to The Banks$3.50”“To Annual Dues for each member$2.50”“Paid to Virgil MacRae, for furnishing and carrying ice for the July 4 races$7.75”\n\nLike Banquo's ghost of old, the question of securing fee simple title to the property still appeared to be a source of vexation and worry for the membership. The record on May 1, 1888 reads as follows: “Motion passed for the Commodore to appoint a committee of three to effect, if possible, the purchase of blank feet of beach fronting on the Sound, and running back to the ocean, and also to perfect plans for erecting a club house thereon.”\n\nThe general description of the desired tract is rather unusual, starting as it does at the Sound and extending backward to the ocean. Under present day practices and procedure it is probable that a description of a lot at Wrightsville Beach would mention the ocean frontage first and then extend the boundaries backward toward the Sound. However, at the time the action was taken the Sound exposure was regarded as the more important, the ocean side appearing to have been of little consequence.\n\nOn July 9, 1883 this was recorded: “When the Committee has received $500 on the Building Fund its members may proceed with the building of the club house, etc., to cost $1,000. The committee is authorized to take steps to provide for the additional sum of $500.”\n\nIn late 1883 it is disclosed that active plans were inaugurated to increase the membership and within a short time there were considerable additions to the lists.\n\nTo evidence the point that the Commodore of the Club, in truth and in fact, was “first in the hearts of his clubmen,” let us think well upon the following paragraph. Then, duly rejoice that such tender sentiments were in evidence when a genuine leader had decided to retire from office: “Mr. Jos. Cronly proposed in most complimentary terms the thanks of the Club be tendered the retiring Commodore for his long services and zeal in the interest of the Body. This was unanimously adopted. Then it was noticed that pearly tears quivered upon the eyelids of every member present. As soon as their choking emotions were sufficiently allayed they gave him three hearty cheers and extended other marks of esteem and gratitude. These he bore with his accustomed resignation.”\n\nThe record then advances the statement that the yacht Foam was purchased by Messrs. G. D. and W. L. Parsley in 1884. Alterations were made in the rig and trim, which wonderfully improved her. Later the name was changed to the Mascotte. Under this later title the boat was successful and secured some brilliant victories. Then it is said: “Monday evening we held our 34th annual meeting. Ours is the second oldest yacht club in America. We have as fine boats of their class as can be found. Our roll shows 130 names. Our Club House is commodious and is in charge of a courteous janitor.” Elsewhere it has been indicated that the Club is third, not second in order of formation.\n\nCould the following paragraph, dated May 5, 1884 by any chance have been written by the Purser with his tongue in his cheek, and with a solemn wink of his weather eye?: “The Commodore elect visited upon the members present a speech, the recollection of which they will carry with them forever. Its effect was magical. In the course of an hour or two, after he began, these sturdy yatchsmen were observed glancing at each other anxiously and holding hard to their belaying pins. Upon the conclusion, after quite some time, they were so greatly stirred that every man rose to his feet and swore (they were in the humor for it), that they were very, very glad—that the yachting season had begun so auspiciously, and then immediately adjourned.”\n\nAn ominous and foreboding warning was proclaimed in clarion tones, in the following quotation from the minutes of June 30, 1885: “A communication was read from the janitor reporting violations of rules by at least two members.”\n\nUndoubtedly apprehensive and fearful of a horde of visitors unless proper precautionary steps were taken, and immovable bars placed somewhere near the entrance, the record for May 3, 1886, discloses the following protective measure: “A short time will be allowed members in which they may introduce their friends. However, it is resolved that members of the Club who keep a Boarding House, or Hotel, shall not be allowed to introduce their boarders.”\n\nNow, everyone is familiar with the fact that prospects for military draft as a preliminary warning and announcement, receive a handsomely engraved card, or letter. The caption of this is “Greetings From The President.” The salutation is followed with the unwelcome intimation and direct statement of fact that the unlucky recipient is wanted by his “Uncle Sam.” Not to be out done in such similar regard, as of June 29, 1887, handsomely engraved cards were placed in the mails and forwarded to dues delinquents, solemnly and lugubriously warning them that they would be “dropped on account of the nonpayment of dues.”\n\nOn May 7, 1888 there is recorded a vote of thanks to the Directors of the Wilmington Sea Coast Railroad for the gift of grounds adjacent to the club house.\n\nIn 1888 evidently there was sentiment prevailing to the effect if a member did not possess his own bath suit he had no one but himself to thank for inability to secure a suit in which to garb his manly form prior to entering the waters of old ocean. On July 16 of said year it is solemnly set forth: “Resolved that bathing suits must not be kept for hire in the Club House. Further, that the janitor be instructed to forbid all persons bathing unclothed in front of the club at night, and to report names of members violating this or any other rule.”\n\nIn this modern day and time when one reflects upon the extentmor rather lack of extent, of coverage by the inadequate thing classified as a bath suit, certainly he must be forced to agree that the resolution of 1888 just quoted was not so much out of line. After all, it served about the same useless purpose then as a duplicate would produce if adopted today.\n\nLevity and humor were not conspicuous by their absence from the session credited to May 6, 1889. Therein the record discloses the following: “The meeting broke up in very good humor, owing to the frantic efforts of an enthusiastic and genteel member to force the Commodore to appear at all races in a very fancy uniform.”\n\nThe management had very little excuse for, or patience with, those forgetful members who did not have sufficient recollection to look up the Club after they had departed. Evidently, and literally, to show them who was “Boss” and to let them know “where to get off,” the minutes for December 19, 1891 say: “It was reported that the Club House was frequently left open. The Chairman of the House Committee was instructed to buy a new lock for the door and keep the key unto himself.”\n\n“To Frolic or not to Frolic,” presumably was a question of prime and major importance in the glamorous days of 1891. The record for that particular period discloses the following revealing and convincing action: “It was moved that the Chair appoint a Frolic Club and that they be allowed the Club House one or two nights a month. The motion was passed.”\n\nThen in the fashion of the army which had reached the top of the hill, only to march down again, the paragraph quoted was supplemented as follows: “Reconsideration of the foregoing was moved. This later\n\nmotion prevailed. The original motion then was again widely discussed. The members present expressed themselves as being in favor of ‘The Frolic’ but at the same time against the Club taking official action, as a good many members were opposed. The original motion again was put. This time it lost.” So, it would appear that somewhat like the infant who lived only a week and had carved on its tombstone the epitaph, “Since I was so soon done for, I wonder what I was begun for,” “The Frolic” passed from scenes of earthly woe and disappointment even before it had an opportunity to gasp and inhale the breath of joyous and frolicsome life.\n\nA policy of foresight, based on fine business judgment and sense of values, was started in 1890 when The Reserve Fund was created for the protection of the Club's property. The idea was to have “a back log” of money which could be utilized in time of emergency. The wisdom of this plan has been evidenced several times when the trust fund has been utilized for unforseen measures and direct needs. At the beginning the Fund was started with the allocation of fifty cents from annual dues, supplemented with monies on hand at the end of the year. To evidence the rigid protection accorded this particular trust, it was specified in the beginning that “No draft upon it could be made without the voting consent of four-fifths of the membership present at meetings when suggestions might be made for charges against the Fund.”\n\nIn 1891 it was decided to appoint a janitor at a salary, then considered sufficient and liberal of forty dollars a month. To increase his income the Board decided to permit him to sell lunches if he wished but at no time to dispose of “anything liquid.” Whether this denial included non intoxicating water is not revealed. He was also accorded the privilege of renting bath suits. To prevent his becoming a profiteer without conscience the extreme maximum of his charge was set at fifteen cents.\n\nThat the janitor was expected to refrain from idleness while “on the job” is proved by a letter he sent to the Governing Board. It stated that a supply of paint had arrived at the Club. He said no bargain had been made with him concerning paint work and he said he would like to know something about the situation. With the utmost gravity and possibly a frown of disapproval because of his presumed non-cooperative attitude, the Board directed the Commodore to advise the janitor that he was capable of and should be willing to do the work. The employe was warned that he must proceed to do the painting within ten days.\n\nThere was a kindly and protective provision of “weather permitting.” In case of refusal or unnecessary delay the Board advised they would feel free to make another appointment. Since there is no further reference to this controversy it is to be presumed the janitor proceeded to remove his coat and then apply a somewhat different one to the property.\n\nIn 1892 North Carolina's great Governor and Senator, Zebulon Baird Vance, in declining health at the time, visited Wrightsville Beach. Appropriate complimentary resolutions were adopted by the Governing Board\n\nand Governor Vance was invited to avail himself of the privileges of the Club House as long as he wished to do so.\n\nIn 1893 there might have been apprehension and fear that some member of the Club would profit unduly at the expense of his brothers in the fraternity. For that reason the decree went forth: “No member of the Club shall be eligible to the position of janitor at the club house.” There was no mention of any application having been filed by a member in possible need of the desirable forty dollar per month position.\n\nIn June of 1893 it was decided to “borrow money on behalf of the Club up to $300, using if possible, as security the claim due by the Bank of New Hanover.” At that particular time it is to be assumed that said bank was in extremis, financially, or maybe, already had passed into the throes of permanent rigor mortis.\n\nIn March of 1895 it is recorded that success had attended an effort to purchase two lots south of the location of the club house. To assure members that their summer haven was still secure one reads in the minutes: “The House is still there, locked and sealed, and the keys are in our pockets.”\n\nOn April 1, 1896 the beloved Honorable George Davis, one of New Hanover County's most distinguished and revered sons, Attorney General of The Confederate States of America in the cabinet of President Jefferson Davis and the only citizen ever to have declined appointment by the Governor to the high position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, was the subject of complimentary and well deserved resolutions. These were drafted by the Governing Board on behalf of the membership. Mr. Davis had been made an Honorary Member in 1891.\n\nIt was about this time also that a member was reported for leaving a window open. He was warned that in future he would be expected to close all windows. Otherwise, something unpleasant and uncomfortable might happen, to blow him through one of the open outlets.\n\nIn 1897 undoubtedly there was general agreement with the proverb, “Brevity is the soul of wit,” extended even to the point of including speeches, as well. It is proclaimed: “A motion was made and passed allowing one man in regular meetings to speak not over two minutes.”\n\nIn the minutes of this particular period it is set forth: “After some discussion of the Club's boat, which is kept for the purpose of assisting persons in a perilous position in the surf, the Commodore was directed to appoint twenty men who could captain the boat in case of emergency.” It is not disclosed what solution was in mind if two or more valiant rescuers arrived about the same time and “all” claimed the individual honor of captaining the ship on the voyage of rescue. Whether a debate was supposed to be held to settle the question while the affrighted one in the surf floundered about in eventual hope of reaching dry territory, is not revealed.\n\nWho knows now what is, or was, a vapor stove? Whatever it was there must have been some highly objectionable features concerning it. The minutes proclaim: “A member was notified that a vapor stove put\n\nin the Club by him must be moved out of the house and cared for until the 22nd of the month. If not observed then the said stove shall be shipped to town if not moved in the meantime.” To make the warning even more pertinent and pressing, “a motion was passed imposing a fine of $5 on anyone who might put said vapor stove, or any other like it, back in the club house.”\n\nIn the days of 1897 undoubtedly members must have been expected to bring their lunches from town, either cooked or uncooked, or starve as a result of their personal and wanton negligence. The record discloses the following resolution: “No cooking shall be done on the premises, except by the janitor, who shall do so, only then, at his own volition.” In relation thereto was the following resolution of the vintage of 1898: “The Club House is not to be used for the regular sleeping and eating place of any person.” Whether this was used to deprive the janitor of his cooking privileges granted in the preceding year and to relegate him to the list of famished and hungry persons, is not made clear.\n\nIn 1898 the Governing Board, following receipt of a request from The Hospital Circle of The King's Daughters, granted the privilege of placing a case of books at the Club House, to be circulated for a reasonable fee. All income was “to be used for the benefit of the work of the Circle.”\n\nThat any indolent or parsimonious member who had the audacity to quarter his boat on the porches could expect rigid and merited punishment, is revealed in the following resolution: “The Purser is instructed to send this offending member a bill for $1.50 for storage of his boat on the piazza instead of renting space in the Boat House.” Somewhat akin thereto and in the same year of 1898 it is shown by the minutes: “A member has declined to pay his fee for use of a locker and will not surrender the key which is in his possession. He is to be advised if the fee is not paid within ten days, or the key returned, then he is to be severely punished in direct relation to his offence.”\n\nThen there is revealed a rather contradictory situation when it is stated that charges had been brought against a non-member allegedly for being on the piazza. This personage appears to have been exonerated of any evil or malicious motive. The description of the incident concludes: “It was proved that this individual only went to the outside edge to speak to someone inside.” Just what could have been done to this alien, even if the charge had been sustantiated, is still a mysterious and hidden secret. There is little, if any, doubt he would have thumbed his nose at any would be interferers with his assumed rights, with an impudent invitation for them to do their worst, insofar as he was concerned.\n\nThere is on file in 1898 minutes a letter from H. B. Duryea, of Newport, R. I. In this he advises that the yacht Carolina, owned by Mr. Pembroke Jones, a former Commodore and enthusiastic member of the Carolina Yacht Club, “was flying the Bourge of that association, second oldest in the United States.” The letter also stated that a cup was being given the Club to be competed for by “thirty footers.” There is attached\n\na clipping from one of the metropolitan papers which states as a fact that the Carolina had returned to New York from Newport, “Flying 34 flags, the largest number ever acquired by any boat of her class in a single season.”\n\nThat the fair feminine followers of yachting, wives and daughters of members, were neither being overlooked nor discriminated against, is revealed in the following resolution of 1899: “Resolved that an appropriation of ten dollars be made to the Regatta Committee to be expended for prizes for The Ladies’ Race on July 21.”\n\nIn the fall of 1899 came the greatest disaster ever to befall the Club. To remedy same the wise collection of The Reserve Fund over the years proved to be helpful indeed. It was at that time there occurred one of the greatest storms ever to visit the vicinity. There was accompanying terrific volume of damage to property at Wrightsville Beach and elsewhere in the section.\n\nThe minutes disclose the statement that the club house was a practical wreck, following nature's stern visitation. It was set forth that an assessment to bring in about $3,000, with supplementary aid from the Reserve Fund, would enable the club house to be rebuilt and also care for operational expenses in 1900, estimated at $400. Unanimous sentiment was expressed to the effect that the disaster in no way should be regarded as a regrettable blow which could not be overcome. Everyone was in agreement that the building should be restored at the earliest possible moment. It was decided that restoration should provide a building even more convenient and useful than its predecessor had proved to be throughout the years.\n\nNovember 19, 1899, at a meeting of the Governing Board it was agreed that the House Committee should have authority to repair, or rebuild, the club house if it could be done for a sum not to exceed $1,000. If that sum should prove to be insufficient then the Committee was authorized to invite bids for the construction of a new building and to report back the result of their findings. At this session a letter was ordered sent to Mr. Norwood Giles, then living in New York. A few years previously he had compiled a delightful outline concerning early points in the life of the Club. Mr. Giles was in poor health. The letter wished for him permanent recovery and expressed a desire for an early return to his youthful environment.\n\nAs evidence of the real determination to have a new and modern home, following the great storm, is this extract from the minutes for February 2, 1900: “The Commodore is instructed to employ suitable help to tear down the old club house and have the lumber piled and listed, and to employ Charles McMillan, an architect, to draw plans and specifications, same to be presented to the Board at the earliest possible moment.”\n\nTwo months later, in March of 1900, it is disclosed that the plans had been completed and approved. They were then offered to contractors. The lowest bid was submitted by Mr. Thad F. Tyler. He agreed\n\nto construct the new building, using materials on hand, for the sum of $1800.\n\nThen a development transpired which today might be considered rather unusual. Mr. McMillan, the architect, also was a contractor. He asked for a delay of several days in closing the transaction so that he could have an opportunity to submit a bid.\n\nAt a second meeting held March 17, 1900 the Governing Board recommended that the contract be awarded to Mr. Tyler at his bid, provided that “he furnishes sufficient financial guarantee that the building be completed by May 20th.” It was noted that the Commodore reported this conclusion as the final action and recommendation of the Building Committee. Mr. McMillan was to supervise the erection of the building for a mutually agreeable fee.\n\nAn action which is noticeable today in the general design of the buildings was taken at the session of March 19, 1900, just before the work of rehabilitation was started. This resolution stated: “It has been decided to erect the new building on a line with the front of the dressing rooms, and with an equal distance between building and dressing rooms on either side.”\n\nIn May of the same year while the work was in progress, it was decided by the Governing Board to use sawed shingles on the sides of the building. The Purser was instructed to make inquiries in regard to construction prices and then report results. Extreme care can be observed as exercised by the Board. Seemingly they wished to have knowledge of, and to authorize every detail in connection with construction of the new building. This position was deemed to be ethical and proper. Then, if there later should be any criticism or trouble in connection with the contract it could be recognized that said Board was the final authority to be consulted.\n\nIllustrative of the truth of the lines by the immortal Scotch Bard, “Bobbie” Burns, that “The best laid schemes o’ mice and men, Gang aft a-gley, and leave us naught but grief and pain, for promised joy,” came a regrettable misunderstanding. As a result the unfortunate contractor was forced to suffer some financial loss in the transaction.\n\nThe minutes for June 16, 1900 state: “It is directed that a letter be written Mr. Charles McMillan, the architect, stating since a misunderstanding has occurred in regard to the partitions upstairs in the club house, that the contractor be informed the Club will claim its right to make deductions for his (contractor's) omissions in the building of four windows and two pairs of steps on western piazza, and grill work and doors. Or the contractor may put up such partitions and doors, and claim will not be made against him.” Just what was the final result in this controversy is not disclosed. Judging from the fact that the Governing Board were strict guardians of the trust imposed, there is little, if any, doubt that the contractor just decided to install the contested features and charge off to experience any extra final outlay which was entailed.\n\n“Provide and use your own garments,” evidently was a slogan taken much to heart in July of 1900 when the Governing Board: “Resolved that the Superintendent investigate the matter of members using the bath suits of other members, without permission of the owner of suit, and to report the names of such offenders, when possible. Further, that the Superintendent was to know the identity of the name-destroying culprit, who cut the name of Mr. Blank from his bath suit.” Just how the Superintenednt was to know the identity of the name-destroying culprit, Deponent knoweth not. Nor does the abstruse record disclose same at any place.\n\nEither the ladies’ yacht races were lessening in popularity among the fair sportswomen, or there was a Scotch influence at large in the distribution of funds in the summer of 1900. The minutes disclose that for a particular contest among the feminine boaters there was an appropriation of five dollars only for prizes. This was exactly one-half the amount allocated for a similar event several years prior thereto.\n\nEvidently in fear that their ardor might be dampened in several respects, the august Governing Board in June of 1900 met to discuss the stoppage of a leak in the roof of the building. It is shown that, after considerable discussion, the question of whether or not to have a damp interior was left with the Commodore to settle.\n\nIn 1902 the salary of the janitor still was fixed at the same sum which had been allowed for many previous years—exactly forty dollars per month.\n\nIn 1902 there was living in Wilmington a gentleman who was one of the original incorporators of the Club in 1853. He was the venerable and highly respected Mr. Richard J. Jones. As he approached his fiftieth year of active membership he was honored by his fellow members with an award of Honorary Membership for the balance of his life.\n\nThe Scotch financial spirit heretofore referred to (and please be assured, gentle reader, that the allusion is not to liquid Scotch spirit), again revealed its provident, saving attitude in June of 1902. It is solemnly recorded: “The Board decided not to purchase a new register this season but to use the old one as long as it would last. If it did not last all summer then to purchase a very cheap book with which to end the season.”\n\nIn July of 1902 the management decided not to have any trespassers loitering about the property, even to the extreme where the Wrightsville Beach government itself was included. At this particular time it is recorded: “Decision was reached not to allow the Town of Wrightsville Beach to build their walk through the Club's property. The Purser also is instructed to pay the town tax of $18, this being one per cent of the valuation of $1800.”\n\nUndoubtedly the management did not approve of any intention, or desire, by the janitor to stray far from his business home. Especially in view of the fact that he was drawing the rather inflated salary of forty dollars a month. Here is the action of the Governing Board as taken\n\nat the meeting of March, 1903: “Resolved that the Purser be instructed to notify the janitor that he is not to leave the premises without permission of the Superintendent. If he should do so then he is to be reported to the Governing Board, who then will take such further action as they deem proper and advisable.”\n\n1903 marked the semi-centennial of the organization. A half century had passed since the glamorous days of 1853 when the Club was formed. It was felt right and proper that a joyful celebration should be held in recognition of the first fifty years of existence, and to wish all manner of success as the association entered upon the second half century.\n\nAt the May meeting in 1903 Mr. George W. Kidder, Commodore of the Club for three successive seasons, was requested to serve as Chairman of a committee to arrange for proper celebration of the semi-centennial. He was given power to select his own aids. Mr. Kidder asked the Club to state the approximate amount which should be expended for the celebration. He suggested the date be set for the third or fourth week in June. Decision was reached to assess each member one dollar. The aggregate amount to be raised, with supplementary funds, was deemed sufficient properly to stage the celebration.\n\nThe program was carried out in pleasing and creditable manner. The occasion proved to be an event of notable and impressive nature. Invitations were sent to many distinguished rulers of governments, prominent officials of this and other countries, and to a great number of individuals interested in yachting. There was an appreciative and cordial reaction and response to the invitations. Illustrative of the acknowledgments which were received, it is deemed appropriate for this permanent record to make brief reference to some of them.\n\nA valuable possession of the Club is a “scrapbook.” In this has been preserved the acknowledgments received from many persons high in the official life of various countries. These exhibits are well preserved and should prove of keen interest to all members of the Club as at present constituted.\n\nFor the sake of the record, now that the centennial of 1953 has succeeded the semi-centennial of 1903, possibly a glance at some of the friendly messages which came after receipt of formal invitations to attend, may not prove uninteresting.\n\nOn stationary of The White House, at Washington, came a reply from the famous President, Theodore Roosevelt:\n\n“The President regrets his inability to accept the courteous invitation of The Carolina Yacht Club to be present at the Semi-Centennial Anniversary, Tuesday evening, June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and three.”\n\nThe Secretary of State wrote: “I regret that it is not possible because of prior engagements to be present at your celebration.”\n\nFrom the Postmaster General: “I regret exceedingly my inability to accept the kind invitation of The Carolina Yacht Club to attend the Semi-Centennial Anniversary at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.”\n\nFrom the Secretary of Agriculture: “I deeply regret that I will be unable to attend the Celebration, on account of previous engagements.”\n\nThe Attorney General, Honorable P. C. Knox, a distinguished lawyer of the time, wrote: “I beg to acknowledge the courtesy of an invitation to be present at the Semi-Centennial Anniversary of The Carolina Yacht Club. I must express regrets that my engagements are of such a nature that I will be compelled to deny myself the pleasure of being present.”\n\nIn the hand writing of Naselli, then Consul from Italy, one may read the following interesting acknowledgment: “His Majesty, the King of Italy, my august Sovereign, to whom your Club sent an invitation for the 50th Anniversary of its foundation, has ordered me to convey to you His Royal thanks for your kind thoughtfulness. Happy to be the medium of conveying His Majesty's thanks, I remain, Sir, Yours very truly, Naselli, Consul of Italy.”\n\nFrom the office of the Ambassador of China, at Washington, came this reply: “I regret that the pressure of official business prevents my acceptance of your Club's kind invitation, and I avail myself of this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the members of the Club for the compliment thus paid me.”\n\nSigned personally by the greatest yachting sportsman who ever lived, and who, with his various Shamrocks continuously tried to win championship races from America, only to receive continual bitter and disappointing defeats, came this note from Sir Thomas Lipton, an Englishman of the finest type of integrity and character:\n\n“Very many thanks for your kind invitation to attend the Semi-Centennial Anniversary of The Carolina Yacht Club on the evening of the 30th inst. I regret, however, that I cannot have the pleasure of being present as I shall be so busily engaged at that time in connection with the Shamrock. Signed, Thomas J. Lipton.”\n\nTo conclude this interesting and valuable collection of acknowledgments there are friendly and appreciative letters and cards, with expressions of good wishes, from practically every yacht club of any importance in the United States.\n\nAgain we revert to some of the matters, usual and unusual, which were deemed sufficiently important to be brought before the Governing Board for official attention and proper action.\n\nAt the August, 1903 meeting, “The Commodore was empowered to have hills on the south side of the club house leveled off and to fill in a hole around the building.”\n\nAt the same meeting: “It was moved that the Purser be instructed to write Mr. R. J. Jones, requesting him to prepare a history of the Club, beginning from 1853, the time he and a few others joined in its organization.” Several months later, Mr. Jones replied. He stated that it was necessary for him to decline, because of his advanced age, and other demands upon his time since he, even then, was actively engaged in business pursuits. He expressed regret that such a decision, necessarily, was forced upon him.\n\nSo far as one janitorial position at least is concerned, the summer of 1904 proved to be an occasion for extreme rejoicing and enthusiastic antics by one member of the supervisory fraternity. His heart was filled with gladness when the individual who filled this position for the Club was advised that decision had been reached to increase his salary to sixty dollars per month. There was a warning of responsibility, however, in a proviso that he must be responsible for securing extra help, when needed, and assuring their prompt report to the Superintendent.\n\nIn June of 1904 it was ordered that the Consolidated Railway, Light & Power Company be requested to remove one are light, with supporting pole, in front of the Club. Since a year then had elapsed following the celebration of the Semi-Centennial, in rather dilatory manner to say the least, it was decided to have the still-in-place decorations removed from the building.\n\nThe average club member of today takes as a matter of course, and an individual right, the privilege of having electricity in his home or place of business. Yet it was just one year less than a half century ago that the following resolution was adopted by the Governing Board: “Resolved that a Committee be appointed to look into the matter of lighting the Club by electricity with report to be filed at the next meeting.” Then, believe it or not, Mr. Doubting Thomas, the following week it was decided to expend the comfortable, possibly extravagant, sum of eighteen dollars, under a contract to install electricity in the Club House for the amount mentioned.\n\nIn the summer of 1904 we find the Governing Board, after mature deliberation and much thought reaching the decision: “A committee of one shall be appointed with power to act, to secure a new life boat. He also shall have authority to sell the old boat for the sum of one dollar.” When they reached a period of retirement, life boats in those days evidently had little of reward to anticipate, since they were then to be sold for a dollar. However, if disposed of in allegedly progressive days of 1953 the theoretical dollar would have brought the Club about 53 cents, the present equivalent of a dollar of five decades ago.\n\nCleanliness was an objective not to be overlooked and never to be forgotten in those balmy days of 1904. This is attested by the following extracts from the minutes of July 1: “Resolved that the Superintendent purchase one hundred rough towels and that the janitor be instructed not to let the same towel be used MORE THAN ONCE before washing same.”\n\nEvidently the conservative spirit of the Governing Board would not permit them to join in suggestions or movements, the effect of which might have been to decrease the revenues of the transit corporation, which even at that date was furnishing excellent service to and from the resort. The minutes for February 20, 1905 reveal this illuminating statement:\n\n“A communication from the Atlantic Yacht Club was read relative to the appointment of a joint Committee to confer with the management of the Consolidated Railways, Light & Power Company to secure\n\na reduction in rates to and from the Beach. Upon motion it was unanimously decided to have the Purser acknowledge the communication and to say that this Club does not deem it necessary to take action.”\n\nNow there apparently seems to have been a change of attitude, as compared with a position taken years previously. Then it had been decided that no member of the Club should fill a salaried appointment connected with supervision of the club house. In February of 1905 the following action is recorded: “Within ten days after election the Governing Board shall appoint three members to act as a Committee on Membership. One member of the Club is to be selected as Superintendent of the club house and grounds. He shall be exempt from payment of dues and shall be hired at a salary of $40 a year.” There is one certain thing. Even in those days when expenditure of a dollar brought in return one hundred cents in value, the Superintendent, no matter how economical he may have been in his personal expeditures, could hardly have amassed a fortune from the salary which was allowed him.\n\nHow many of the present day's younger generation have ever heard of, or seen, a Japanese lantern? Well, they can be advised that a half century ago these illumination adjuncts were popular indeed for decorations. In the minutes for June 23, 1905, it is stated: “A Committee shall be appointed to draft rules for government of bowling alleys (which had been provided as an additional attraction to keep members within the confines of the club house and to persuade them not to go to the hotels for amusement). The Committee also shall have authority to rent a piano and to purchase as many Japanese lanterns as are needed during the season.”\n\nPlease remember, dear reader, that sentiment of tender and persuasive nature also has entered into the official existence of The Carolina Yacht Club. From the report of the Commodore for 1905 is gleaned the following item of romantic and social nature:\n\n“Upon one occasion, which many will remember, we had the first wedding since the organization of the Club, to take place in the center of the reception hall. At that time a gentleman and his lady love residing on Greenville Sound, were made man and wife.”\n\nIn the summer of 1906 it was decided that the janitor should wear proper and essential garb while he fulfilled the duties of his onerous and responsible position. In the minutes for March it is disclosed: “The salary of the janitor was made $50 per month. The janitor also must provide himself with a suitable uniform, subject to the approval of the Superintendent, TO BE WORN AT ALL TIMES.”\n\nThe never yielding determination to maintain economic operation at all times and under all circumstances, is well evidenced by the following notation from the records for July 19, 1906: “A motion was adopted that the Club recognize the heroism of Janitor J. P. Walton, in saving Master Willson, of Charlotte, from drowning, and that he be presented with an appropriate present to cost NOT EXCEEDING FIFTEEN DOLLARS.”\n\nPossibly it is proper and in order to terminate this series of human interest citations, all of which were deemed sufficiently important as to merit consideration and action by the Governing Boards, with a final extract. This followed another destructive storm in the fall of 1906. Happily and fortunately, however, the damage suffered by the club house during this second terrific weather disturbance, was inconsequential and of minor nature. There was no great monetary loss involved. As the storm occurred toward the end of the summer season there was no special interference with the usual activities of the Club. This concluding excerpt from the minutes for November 15, 1905 is set forth in the following terse and forceful manner: “The Board approved the action of the House Committee in closing the Club House for the season, after the big storm, which carried away the trestle of the traction company, thereby preventing members the use of same.”\n\nSince 1906, to the present, the Carolina Yacht Club has been wisely and conservatively managed by successive Governing Boards. The Directors have given freely of their time, thought and effort to direct the affairs of the organization. They have given it the benefit of wise, provident and prudent direction. To all of those who have so generously given of themselves certainly the apreciative thanks of the entire membership is extended in every increasing volume.\n\nAs a supplementary note it is pleasing to emphasize that one of the most interesting features of the long and honorable career of this famous progenitor of modern yacht clubs, is that the same courses for regattas at Wrightsville Beach are followed now, just as they were mapped by the founders one hundred years ago.\n\nDuring the past half century, 1903-1953, the Club has stealily developed and expanded. It has become an even greater factor in the sports and social life not only of the membership, but of the entire community, as well. Under the management and direction of a progressive and aggressive spirit, developed and advanced by some of the younger members, activities of the organization have been greatly broadened in conception and scope.\n\nThe sport of yachting was the original motivation for the organization. Now the modern enlarged and improved Club House (successor to the first home, the initial building at Wrightsville Beach), serves as a summer haven for families of members and their friends. Here friendships are fostered and strengthened. Children are permitted many forms of innocent diversion and amusement. Various types of informal entertainment such as receptions, dances, card parties, etc., are frequently and elaborately arranged for the pleasure of those participating.\n\nTo evidence the position and influence which surrounds The Carolina Yacht Club as a functioning unit, this altogether inadequate and feeble sketch well may be closed with the statement that the association is a prominent and worthy member of the North American Yacht Racing Union. That body also may be considered and designated as “The Supreme Court of Yachting.”\n\nPossessing an equally important position as that held in the National unit, in a sectional or Tri-State group, this well known yachting organization of Wilmington, Wrightsville Beach and New Hanover County, is regarded as one of the most influential components in the South Atlantic Yacht Racing Association.\n\nNow, as we say “Hail and Farewell” to the first century of life of The Carolina Yacht Club, combined with “Greetings and Welcome” to a lusty Time infant—the second hundred years of life—newer members of the organization may be interested in a concluding and final statement that, undoubtedly for the sake of sentiment and affection, many of the feminine names listed for yachts of “ye olden time” were those of sisters, mothers, or daughters of the valiant hosts of splendid saliors and courtly gentlemen who added so much of prestige, dignity, and influence to the Carolina Yacht Club in its earlier years.\n\nIn conclusion, with the first century of honorable existence now terminated, The Carolina Yacht Club enters upon the second epochal ten decades with a forward and confident glance, and a determination to hew for itself an even greater and more important niche in the fabric of the fine community it has so long and honorably served.\n\nADDENDUM\n\nIn one of the timeworn minute books there is to be found a register of a great number of yachts, with their owners listed at the time of recording. These are approximately 85 in number. As a matter of course it is to be understood that this enumeration does not inclule the names, or the owners, of many of the boats later than 1915. For the periods subsequent to that year, if all inclusions were made, the outline would be of such voluminous nature as to cause this record to become as top heavy as some of the earlier yachts themselves are said to have been.\n\nTherefore, the kind approval of those who may read this narrative is requested, with the hope they will understand that what is being sought and portrayed is the background, the glamour, and the fascination so well delineated by the earlier minutes of the Club. The more modern listings, if desired, can be secured with a minimum of time and effort from the well maintained, accurately kept, and splendidly preserved annual minute books subsequent to 1906.\n\nWith the foregoing explanation, for the moment let us consult the old records once more. Let us be actuated with the hope and effort particularly to develop, and find, a bird's eye view of the older yachts as they effectively and brilliantly contested for leading positions in scores of races. These, initially were run on the Cape Fear River, within the harbor lines at Wilmington. Subsequently races were held on the lovely waters, sometimes placid, sometimes rough, of the appealing and glamorous Banks Channel, just west of Wrightsville Beach.\n\nNow, to outline the ancient register of the yachts, with their owners. Certainly, it is most appropriate to record the fact that the famous Confederate States’ naval hero, Captain John Newland Maffitt, of Wilmington, stands at the head of the column, displaying the Number One position. His boat was named the Carrie. Then, proceeding in orderly manner, in accordance with the registered number assigned each owner, with his boat, the listings are as follows:\n\n1.
