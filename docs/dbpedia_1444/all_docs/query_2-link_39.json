The provisions of this article do not affect any right, privilege, or provision of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act pursuant to Chapter 78, Title 15.\"\n\nSECTION 12. Chapter 32, Title 15 of the 1976 Code is amended by adding:\n\n\"Article 3\n\nPunitive Damages\n\nSection 15-32-310. As used in this article:\n\n(1) 'Claimant' means a party to a civil action, including a plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross-claimant or third-party plaintiff, seeking the recovery of punitive damages.\n\n(2) 'Compensatory damages' means actual damages, including nominal damages.\n\n(3) 'Defendant' means a party to a civil action, including a counter defendant, cross-defendant or third-party defendant, from whom a claimant seeks recovery of punitive damages.\n\n(4) 'Punitive damages' means extra-compensatory or exemplary damages awarded for the purposes set forth in Section 15-32-320.\n\nSection 15-32-320.

(A) This article applies to every claim for punitive damages, regardless of whether the claim for relief is based upon a statutory or common law right of action or based in equity.

(A) In an action seeking an award of punitive damages, the jury must determine and state the amount of punitive damages separately from the amount of compensatory damages.\n\n(B) Punitive damages awarded against a defendant may not exceed nine times the amount of compensatory damages, except in the case of fraud or the infliction of an intentional tort including, but not limited to, false imprisonment, trespass, invasion of privacy, and civil actions arising out of criminal violations. If a jury returns a verdict for punitive damages in excess of the maximum amount specified pursuant to this subsection, the trial court shall reduce the award and enter judgment for punitive damages in the maximum amount.\n\n(C) The provisions of subsection (B) may not be made known to the jury through any means, including voir dire, the introduction of evidence, argument of counsel, or instructions to the jury.\n\nSection 15-32-350. (A) A civil action tried before a jury and seeking punitive damages must be conducted in a bifurcated trial. Each phase of the trial must be conducted before the same jury.\n\n(B) In the first phase of the trial the jury shall:\n\n(1) determine and assign liability among the parties; and\n\n(2) award compensatory damages against the liable parties.\n\n(C) At the conclusion of the first phase of the trial, if the court determines that the conduct of the liable parties was wilful and wanton and compensatory damages are awarded against the liable parties, the jury shall determine if punitive damages are warranted against the liable parties and the amount of punitive damages to be awarded during the second phase of the trial.\n\n(D) In determining the amount of punitive damages, the jury shall consider:\n\n(1) degree of culpability of the liable parties;\n\n(2) duration of the conduct;\n\n(3) awareness or concealment of the conduct by the liable parties;\n\n(4) existence of similar past conduct;\n\n(5) likelihood that an award will deter these or other parties from similar conduct;\n\n(6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from the conduct;\n\n(7) defendant's ability to pay; and\n\n(8) any other factor the court considers necessary for the jury to make an adequate and informed determination.\n\n(E) Upon motion of the liable party, the court shall conduct a post trial review, on the record, to ensure that an award is not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense or conduct.\n\nSection 15-32-360. When reviewing the evidence regarding a finding by the jury concerning liability for punitive damages in accordance with this article or regarding the amount of punitive damages awarded, the trial court shall state in a written opinion its reasons for upholding or overturning the finding or award. The trial court shall specifically address the evidence, or lack of evidence, as it relates to liability or the amount of punitive damages pursuant to the requirements of this article.\n\nSection 15-32-370.

The amount of damages must be pled in accordance with applicable court rules.\"\n\nSECTION 13. Chapter 38, Title 15 is amended to read:\n\n\"CHAPTER 38\n\nSouth Carolina Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act\n\nSection 15-38-10. This chapter may be cited as the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.\n\nSection 15-38-15. (A) In an action to recover damages resulting from personal injury, wrongful death, or damage to property, if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by more than one defendant, each defendant against whom recovery is allowed is liable to the claimant only for the defendant's proportionate share of the recoverable damages except as provided in subsection (D).\n\n(B) The proportionate share of damages for which each defendant is liable is calculated by multiplying the damages by a fraction in which the numerator is the defendant's percentage of liability determined pursuant to subsection (C), and the denominator is the total of the percentages of liability determined pursuant to subsection (C), to be attributable to all defendants whose actions are a proximate cause of the injury, death, or damage to property including settled or released persons pursuant to Section 15-38-50. A percentage of liability attributable to the claimant may not be included in the denominator of the fraction.\n\n(C) The jury or court, if there is no jury, shall specify:\n\n(1) the amount of damages;\n\n(2) findings of fact necessary for the court to specify recoverable damages; and\n\n(3) the percentage of liability that proximately caused the injury, death, or damage to property in relation to one hundred percent, that is attributable to each defendant whose actions are a proximate cause of the injury, death, or damage to property including settled or released persons pursuant to Section 15-38-50.\n\n(D)(1) Upon motion by the claimant to open the judgment filed, after good faith efforts by the claimant to collect from a liable defendant, at least one year but not more than two years after judgment becomes final through lapse of time or through exhaustion of appeal, whichever occurs later, the court shall determine whether all or part of a defendant's proportionate share of the recoverable damages is not collectible from that defendant, and shall reallocate that amount among the other defendants in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) The court shall order that the portion of the amount not collectible be reallocated among the other defendants. The court shall reallocate to the other defendants an amount equal to the amount not collectible of recoverable damages multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the defendant's percentage of liability and the denominator is the total of the percentages of liability of all defendants excluding any defendant whose liability is reallocated.\n\n(3) The defendant whose liability is reallocated remains subject to contribution pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and to any continuing liability to the claimant on the judgment.\n\nSection 15-38-20. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, where two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.\n\n(B) The right of contribution exists only in favor of a tortfeasor who has paid more than his pro rata proportionate share of the common liability as determined by the jury or court at the time of judgment, and his total recovery is limited to the amount paid by him in excess of his pro rata proportionate share as determined by the jury or court at the time of judgment. No tortfeasor is compelled to make contribution beyond his own pro rata proportionate share of the entire liability as determined by the jury or court at the time of judgment.\n\n(C) There is no right of contribution in favor of any tortfeasor who has intentionally caused or contributed to the injury or wrongful death.\n\n(D) A tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement nor in respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what was reasonable.\n\n(E) A liability insurer, who by payment has discharged in full or in part the liability of a tortfeasor and has thereby discharged in full its obligation as insurer, is subrogated to the tortfeasor's right of contribution to the extent of the amount it has paid in excess of the tortfeasor's pro rata proportionate share of the common liability as determined by the jury or court at the time of judgment. This provision does not limit or impair any right of subrogation arising from any other relationship.\n\n(F) This chapter does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law. Where one tortfeasor is entitled to indemnity from another, the right of the indemnity obligee is for indemnity and not contribution, and the indemnity obligor is not entitled to contribution from the obligee for any portion of his indemnity obligation.\n\n(G) This chapter does not apply to breaches of trust or of other fiduciary obligation.\n\nSection 15-38-30. In determining the pro rata shares of tortfeasors in the entire liability (1) their relative degrees of fault shall not be considered; (2) if equity requires, the collective liability of some as a group shall constitute a single share; and (3) principles of equity applicable to contribution generally shall apply.\n\nSection 15-38-40. (A) Whether or not judgment has been entered in an action against two or more tortfeasors for the same injury or wrongful death, contribution may be enforced by separate action.\n\n(B) Where a judgment has been entered in an action against two or more tortfeasors for the same injury or wrongful death, contribution may be enforced in that action by judgment in favor of one against other judgment defendants by motion upon notice to all parties to the action. Provided, however, contribution may not be enforced in the action until the issue of liability, and the resulting damages against the defendant or defendants named in the action, and the proportionate fault of the defendant is determined. Once the issue of liability has been resolved, subject to Section 15-38-20(B), a defendant has the right to seek contribution against any judgment defendant and other persons who were not made parties to the action.\n\n(C) If there is a judgment for the injury or wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, any separate action by him to enforce contribution must be commenced within one year after the party seeking contribution has made the final payment in excess of that party's share of the judgment after the judgment has become final by lapse of time for appeal or after appellate review.\n\n(D) If there is no judgment for the injury or wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, his right of contribution is barred unless he has either (1) discharged by payment the common liability within the statute of limitations period applicable to claimant's right of action against him and has commenced his action for contribution within one year after payment, or (2) agreed while action is pending against him to discharge the common liability and has within one year after the agreement paid the liability and commenced his action for contribution.\n\n(E) The recovery of a judgment for an injury or wrongful death against one tortfeasor does not of itself discharge the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless the judgment is satisfied. The satisfaction of the judgment does not impair any right of contribution.\n\n(F) The judgment of the court in determining the liability of the several defendants to the claimant for an injury or wrongful death shall be binding as among such defendants in determining their right to contribution.\n\nSection 15-38-50. When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:\n\n(1) it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is the greater; and\n\n(2) it discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.\n\nSection 15-38-60. This chapter shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those that enact it.\n\nSection 15-38-65. No payment shall be made from state appropriated funds or other public funds to satisfy claims or judgments against governmental entities or governmental employees acting within the scope of their official duties arising under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. The South Carolina Tort Claims Act is the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity while acting within the scope of his official duty. The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act shall not apply to governmental entities.\n\nSection 15-38-70. All acts or parts of acts which are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter are hereby repealed.\"\n\nSECTION 14. Section 29-7-20(1) of the 1976 Code, as last amended by Act 247 of 1991, is further amended to read:\n\n\"(1) A contractor or subcontractor who, for other purposes than paying the money loaned upon such the contract, transfers, invests or expends and fails to pay to a laborer, subcontractor, or materialman out of the money received as provided in Section 29-7-10 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, when the consideration for the work and material exceeds the value of one hundred dollars must be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not less than three months nor more than six months and when such consideration does not exceed the value of one hundred dollars must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not longer than thirty days is subject to an action for damages.\"\n\nSECTION 15.

If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this act is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of this act, the General Assembly hereby declaring that it would have passed this act, and each and every section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise ineffective.\n\nSECTION 18.
