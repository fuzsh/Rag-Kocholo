        "text": "Dr. Edwin Carman (1867-1937) was a Freeport doctor who gained national attention in 1914 when his wife, Florence, was arrested for shooting and killing his patient, Louise Bailey.\n\nCarman was born in East Rockaway to Richard and Elizabeth (nee Hewlett). He became a doctor in 1889 after graduating with full honors from the Long Island College Hospital. After graduation, he set up his medical practice in Freeport. Though he had a general practice he specialized as an obstetrician and gynecologist. In a 1920s biography, it was said that Carman \"probably delivered more infants than any other doctor on Long Island.\" Carman married Florence Conklin in 1892.\n\nCarman was the physician for the local poor house. He served as the health officer for the Town of Hempstead for one year and was the health officer for Freeport for 18 years. Carman assisted in the organization of the South Shore Hospital.\n\nCarman like horse racing. In 1896, his horse, Jack the Ripper won $30 at Reservoir Park. However, his passion proved costly in 1922, when he was swindled out of $14,000 by con men who told him they had information on a \"sure thing\" at a horse track in Rhode Island.\n\nAround 1926, Carman was investigated for using more narcotics than the law allowed in the treatment of drug addicts. Those charges were dismissed in 1929.\n\nIn 1928, Carman was indicted for manslaughter and the \"performance of an illegal operation\" (abortion) in connection to the death of Claudia Winifred Halstead of Lynbrook. Halstead who was married and the mother of two children, died of an infection. She was 30 years old at the time of her death. According to testimony from her husband, George, Halstead became ill after the procedure. George Halstead contacted Carman who performed a second procedure on his wife at the Halstead's home. When her conditioned worsened, she was taken to the hospital where she died.\n\nFour days prior to Halstead's death, Carman became the subject of another investigation involving an abortion. Hazel Potter was admitted to the hospital after becoming seriously ill after getting an abortion at Dr. Carman's office. During the Potter trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Carman was a known abortionist. According to a newspaper account, \"Neighbors even complained to the police on one occasion of the constant stream of women pouring into his place and the weird feminine screams which emanated from it at night.\" Carman's defense included five character witnesses who attempted to bolster Carman's claim that Potter, who became pregnant after an affair, falsely accused the doctor in spite because he refused to help her. Potter testified that Carman charged her $25 for the abortion. During the procedure, Potter said Carman told her to \"Keep quiet\" and said that that he performed the same procedure many times per month.\n\nCarman was found guilty in the Potter case. A petition urging judicial clemency for Carman was signed by 5,000 people and presented to the court. Judge Lewis J. Smith sentenced Carman to two to four years in prison but then he suspended the sentence. Carman lost his medical license. He was never charged in the Halstead case.\n\nCarman died at his home in Merrick in 1937 at the age of 71. He is buried in Greenfield Cemetery, Uniondale, NY.\n\nClick here for material related to Edwin Carman.\n\nClick here for Library of Congress images related to the Carman trial.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Carman Dismissed.\" The Nassau County Review.

Feeney, June 13, 2022.\n\nUpdated by Regina G. Feeney, October 7, 2022.\n\nThe Carman Murder garnered international press coverage in 1914. The victim was Louise \"Lu Lu\" Bailey of Hempstead. Florence Carman, the wife of Dr. Edwin Carman, was arrested and tried twice for Bailey's murder but was ultimately was acquitted.\n\nAround 8 p.m. on June 30, 1914, Dr. Edwin Carman was seeing patients in his office located in the house he shared with his wife, daughter and in-laws. Carman's office included a waiting room and examination room and was on the first floor of 118 West Merrick Road (north side of Merrick Road just east of the present post office). A hand holding a .38 caliber pistol broke the the glass, pushed through the closed blinds and fired a single shot that entered the back of Louise Bailey. The bullet pierced both her lungs and aorta. Bailey died instantly. Dr. Carman telephoned Dr. William Runcie who lived across the street. Strangely, he asked Archie Post to get Theodore Bedell, the local blacksmith. When Post failed to locate Bedell's house, Dr. Carman went on foot. He claimed that before she died, Mrs. Bailey told him that she met him and Bedell at the home of her cousin, Mrs. Kimball. Dr. Carman said he wanted Bedell there to help identify the victim as Mrs. Bailey. There is conflicting information as to how long it took for someone to notify the police. Some sources say it was 15 minutes, others claim it was an hour before authorities were called.\n\nPolice discovered a box of .38 caliber bullets in the Carman's attic, but since it was covered in dust, it was clear that the box had not been touched in a long time.\n\nAt the time of shooting, four patients were in Dr. Carman's waiting room, a woman (possibly named Hannah Kahn), Hazel Combs, George Golder, and Archie Post. A third man, Edward T. Bardes was on his way to see Carman but had not entered the house when the shot rang out.\n\nThe Carmans retained John Graham, a well known trial lawyer on Long Island. Attorneys Henry A. Uterhart and George Morton Levy of Freeport were hired to assist Graham.\n\nIn early July, an inquest was held at Freeport's police court on South Grove Street [now Guy Lombardo Avenue]. The primary witness was 33 year old Edward T. Bardes, who worked as an insurance agent for John Hancock Life Insurance Company. He walked from his home at 433 Bedell Street to have Dr. Carman look at his sore heel. When he arrived at the doctor's office, he felt better and decided to return home. It was then he saw a woman in a white shirt and dark skirt walking on the west side of the Carman house at the time of the shooting. Though he could not swear that the woman in white was Carman, his description matched the outfit Florence Carman was wearing that evening.\n\nAnother witness was Gaston Boissannault, manager of the General Acoustic Company. Mrs. Carman had the company install a recording/listening device, known as a Dictaphone, in her husband's office. Boissannault testified that Florence Carman wanted the device installed because she believed \"he had improper relations with women.\" Carman told him that she could not divorce her husband on account of their child. Frank C. Burnell, an electrician for General Acoustics, was dispatched to the Carman home to install the device. He was told to come to the side door to the doctor's office and hold his hat in his left hand. This was the signal to Florence Carman's mother to let him in. He put the transmitter behind a cabinet and ran wires under the linoleum on the floor and attached them to a receiver hidden in a desk located in the Carman's bedroom on the second floor.\n\nDuring the inquest, Justice of the Peace and acting coroner, Corodon Norton stayed at the original Freeport Elks Club. After deliberation, Norton issued a warrant for Carman's arrest for the murder of Lulu D. Bailey. Sheriff Stephen P. Pettit along with Carman's counsel, George Morton Levy, District Attorney Lewis J. Smith, and Assistant D.A., George Weeks went to Carman's home. It was reported that Carman \"walked majestically into the room\" where the men had gathered. When the warrant was read, Dr. and Mrs. Carman \"wept on each other's shoulders.\" After she regained her composure, she entered a plea of not guilty. She was arrested and committed to the County Jail in Mineola A crowd of 600 people watched as Carman left her home and was driven to jail by the sheriff. Carman was placed in an 8 by 12-foot cell with a single window, a bed, and a rocking chair. She was incarcerated here for about a month.\n\nSeveral days later, Dr. Carman claimed that while driving in his car with actor Garland Gaden, a man on a bicycle shot at his automobile. Gaden confirmed the story. Some believe this story was manufactured by Dr. Carman to provide evidence that someone was trying to shoot him. At the trial, William P. W. Haff of Lynbrook was called to testify at trial that his car was shot at while driving in Freeport. It was noted that Haff looked like Dr. Carman and drove a similar car to his.\n\nThe trial began on July 19 with a jury of 12 married men, none of whom were from Freeport. Justice Charles H. Kelby, whose parents lived in Freeport, presided over the proceedings\n\nTwelve days after Bailey's death, Celia Coleman, a maid who had been employed with the Carmans for about six weeks at the time of the murder, disappeared. However, it was revealed that the District Attorney's Office had hired the Burns Detective Agency to \"hide\" Coleman to keep her from being bribed or threatened. During the inquest, her testimony provided an alibi for Carman. However, Coleman later claimed that she perjured herself because Mrs. Carman had offered her a $5 tip and promised her perpetual care for her child. Coleman, would later testify that on December 5th, while she was in Charleston, SC, she was approached by an African American man who claimed to be an attorney. The man, who said his names was Hicks, offered her $300 on behalf of Mrs. Carman to change her story. He also promised to help her secure a divorce from her husband, marry her, and take her to New Orleans. Coleman's cousin, George Toomer, corroborated her testimony. In reality, Hicks was Archie Owens, a detective. It was widely suspected that during the trial, Owens changed his allegiances and began working for the defense.\n\nDuring the trial, Jennie Duryea, who was Louise Bailey's mother, testified that her daughter left Hempstead to visit a friend in Rockville Centre around 3:13 p.m. Neither she nor Bailey's husband, William, knew why she would have gone to see Dr. Carman. It was suggested at trial that Bailey had met Dr. Carman previously at her cousin's house, though Dr. Carman testified he did not recall meeting the victim. The prosecution used Carman's jealousy as a motive. On one occasion, while peeking through the window, she caught nurse Elizabeth J. Varrance kiss Dr. Carman after he gave her $20. After banging on the window, Florence ran into the doctor's office and slapped the nurse. At trial it was said that Varrance asked Dr. Carman for money when she was short of funds and the kiss was done on impulse. After she was slapped, Varriance left the money on the table and left. She testified that she heard Dr. Carman tell his wife if she ever did such a thing again, he would leave her.\n\nDuring the trial, Celia Coleman testified that Carman came downstairs wearing a kimono and walked out the back door. When Elizabeth Carman went to follow her mother, Carman told her to stay back. When the shot rang out, Elizabeth ran towards the front of the house and according to Coleman, when Mrs. Carman entered the house, Carman said, \"I shot him, see?\" The next morning, Coleman claimed that Mrs. Carman burned letters and had her father, Platt Conklin, dispose of the gun.\n\nDr. Runcie testified when he was called to the Carman's house on the night of the murder, Dr. Carman said, \"This is terrible. It will ruin my practice.\" He also said that Mrs. Carman confessed that she installed the Dictaphone because she was jealous.\n\nThe defense offered the testimony of Florence Raynor who claimed Bardes could not have seen the \"woman in white\" because Bardes came to her house at 8:30 p.m. and stayed until 11. Freeporter Rudolph Loewe testified he heard the shot and saw a man run from the scene. However, his testimony was discredited because Loewe was profoundly deaf and George M. Levy and Judge Kelby had to shout questions in his ear.\n\nMrs. Carman testified that she was on the second floor of the house at the time of the shooting. However, Hazel Combs and Hannah Kahn both testified that Mrs. Carman had entered the doctor's office to answer a telephone call and open a door for a patient. George Golder who originally testified that Mrs. Carman let him into the doctor's office, later, said on the stand that it was possible that he confused Mrs. Carman with her sister, Ida Powell.\n\nFrank Farrell, a beggar, who had knocked on doors for homes on Merrick Road, testified while at the Carman house, he saw a woman by the window of the doctor's office. Levy was able to produce witnesses that claimed Farrell was in New York City at the time of the murder. The defense produced two witnesses, Charles Adams and Percy Smith, who swore they saw a man run across the Carman lawn and jump a fence. However, they contradicted each other on the time they were by the Carman's house. Mrs. Carman's father claimed he saw footprints near the broken fence where the witness saw someone jump. However, a police officer testified he saw no broken fence that evening.\n\nAfter nearly 13 hours of deliberations, they jury could not come to a consensus; ten jurors voted for acquittal and two voted for conviction. Upon hearing there was a hung jury, Louise Bailey's mother, Jennie Duryea, said, \" I feel that it is a moral conviction and that is all that I care for in the eyes of the world. I didn't want Mrs. Carman to go to the electric chair or yet to prison, but I do not see how they could vote for an acquittal on the evidence.\"\n\nA month before the start of a second trial, Graham withdrew from the case citing health reasons. Levy took on the role of lead attorney. While on stand during the second trial, the prosecution asked Mrs. Carman, \"Were you ever at or near the window to the doctor's office?\" The courtroom audience gasped when Mrs. Carman responded, \"Which time?\" The prosecution accused Mrs. Carman of spying on her husband through the windows. Mrs. Carman regained her composure and explained she spent time near those windows because her flowerbed were located there.\n\nThe second jury only took one hour to deliberate, and a “not guilty” verdict was made on the first ballot. Mrs. Carman said, “I can go back to my friends and be happy with them, and if it were not for my friends and the confidence they have shown in me, the trials would have been much harder for me than they have been.” Asked if she planned to go into vaudeville, she said she didn’t, but Mr. Levy said he could not promise that she wouldn’t. William Bailey, the victim’s husband, made no comment.\n\nClick her for images from the Library of Congress taken during the Carman murder trial.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCarman, Edwin\n\nKelby, Charles H.\n\nLevy, George Morton\n\nPettit, Stephen P.\n\nRuncie, William H.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Acquits Mrs. Carman of Bailey Murder.\" The Nassau Post.

Early settlers, including Edward Raynor, harvested salt hay for their livestock in this area. In Colonial times, communal salt meadows were governed by the Town of Hempstead. Regulations concerning salt meadows in the Town of Hempstead date back to 1761. These regulations barred fencing of the meadows and set dates for harvesting.\n\nIn March 1897, the Town of Hempstead passed a resolution that imposed a $12.50 fine for any person caught cutting grass on the \"common marshes\" before the first Tuesday in September. The resolution also called for the sale by the town supervisor at public auction of grass from the \"common marshes at Freeport\". Later that same year, a public meeting was called for in Freeport for the purpose of discussing the \"feasibility of the Town leasing the cow meadows for a term of years to private parties.\"\n\nA. R. Rhodes leased the \"cow meadows at Freeport\" for 50 years. The exact location of this Freeport cow meadow was not given; however, the lease came with a provision to widen and deepen the Freeport Creek (also known as the Freeport River) by the lessee. Since the 1870s, proceeds raised from the sale of the \"grass\" from the cow meadow in Freeport was used to deepen this waterway.\n\nThough there may have been a number of locations in Freeport identified as a cow meadow, the moniker \"Cow Meadow\" became associated in the twentieth century with land at the end of South Main Street.\n\nSometime in the 1930s, the area was approved for industrial zoning. In late 1937, the Town of Hempstead considered establishing a marine base that would accommodate industrial shipping at Cow Meadow. Robert Moses, president of the Long Island Park Commission, opposed this plan.\n\nAccording to Clinton Metz, village historian, portions of Cow Meadow were annexed to Freeport for residential development on two occasions: Freeport Bay Estates in 1950 and Colony Park in 1959.\n\nMoses Hornstein, president of Horn Construction, purchased the land in 1956 for $406,000. His plan to develop the area for industrial use faced much opposition from civic groups and the Village of Freeport. In 1961, Mayor Robert J. Sweeney created a Cow Meadow Committee for the purpose \"to weigh all facets of the complex problem and to recommend to the administration the best possible use of the vast Cow Meadow acreage.\" The Long Island Lighting Company considered purchasing this property for the installation of a $200,000,000 power plant in 1961. This plan was supported by the Northeast Civic Association.\n\nWhen the Town of Hempstead considered re-zoning this property for residential development, Sweeney led a 15-car motorcade with a delegation of 100 Freeporters to Hempstead for a hearing concerning the matter in 1962. Hornstein took out a two-page advertisement in March 30, 1961 issue of The Leader to plead the case for allowing residential development of this area. Sweeney's attempt to hold a referendum on having the village purchase the property failed after three attempts to get the necessary unanimous board approval. Horn Construction eventually filled suit against the Town of Hempstead. In 1963, Supreme Court Justice Daniel G. Albert struck down the industrial zoning for this tract of land, which opened the door for public use.\n\nIn 1966, a junk yard that existed in Cow Meadow was removed from the site.\n\nNassau County acquired approximately 171.2 acres of Cow Meadow in 1970 for general purposes. Three years later, Cow Meadow Park was opened. Originally, the park featured six tennis courts, six handball courts, three shuffleboard courts, two basketball courts, two horseshoe sandboxes, a playground, and trails for walking and bird watching.\n\nClick here for images related to Cow Meadow Park.\n\nSee Also:\n\nColony Park\n\nFreeport Bay Estates\n\nSalt Hay\n\nSources:\n\n\"Builder Challenges Cow Meadow Zoning.\" Newsday.
