        "text": "MONTAUK, LI., Sept. 11 — The vice chairman of the East Hampton Town Republican Committee, whom some of the people out here call “Junie” because he was named after his late father, was entertaining a couple of visitors from the city the other day by showing them how to tell the sex of a lobster.\n\n“They have little extensions, swimmerettes, on their underside,” he said, flipping a rambunctious creature over and tickling what might be called its belly. “On the female, the first set of swimmerettes is soft and pliable. On the male, they're stiff.”\n\n“See, a female,” he said. She celebrated her sex by swiping a claw at his wrist. A near miss, but a nice try. Back she went into one of the lobster tanks inside the cluster of white‐andgreen buildings on the pier. The only sound was the “chunk ‐ chunk‐chunk‐chunk” of compressors cooling the water pumped into the tanks from Fort Pond Bay.\n\nAbsorbed with this nugget of marine lore, the political visitors forget for a moment that they didn't drive 110 miles out to the end of Long Island to study crustacean sex or even the East Hampton Republican Committee.\n\nThe Next Governor?\n\n“Junie” is Perry B. Duryea Jr., the Speaker of the New York Assembly, the second most powerful man in state government, a tough professional who many people think will be Governor of New York in a few years.\n\nBut, in fact, it's tough to relate this tall, tanned man in a sports shirt and chinos, laughing about his lobsters, himself and everybody else with the grim, controlled Speaker in Albany who swings that big mean gavel and talks man‐to‐man with Governor Rockefeller.\n\nHome is Montauk, that little Long Island outpost that a whimsical glacier or something attached to Brooklyn and the rest of New York State. He was born there in 1921 after his father left Brooklyn because of the malaria he picked up on the Mexican border during World War I.\n\nThe health and wealth of the senior Duryea thrived in the Atlantic air. “Perry B. Duryea & Son, Inc.” became one of the largest lobster supply houses in North America and the father found time to become a State Senator, the most powerful man in Suffolk County Republican politics, a close friend of Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and to serve as Mr. Dewey's Commissioner of Conservation.\n\nTo the manor born—a stunning little manor, a rambling gray ranch house perched on a grassy bluff along 175 feet of Atlantic beach—Perry Jr. has thrived, too. He lives a good life, with real work, land in the Bahamas, his plane and boat, a twinengine Piper Aztec and a 60‐foot lobster boat converted to sleep six, an heir, Perry B. Duryea 3d, 22 and, like his father, a 6‐foot‐2inch Colgate graduate—and with growing power and influence firmly rooted in the sandy soil of Eastern Long Island.\n\nHe Helps Suffolk\n\nAs Speaker, Mr. Duryea's constituency includes the 78 other Republicans in the Assembly and during election campaigns he has little time to spend on local candidates and issues. One reason he logs 50,000 miles a year in his Aztec—he is a former Navy pilot—is that he flies around the state to speak for Republican candidates in tougher districts.\n\nBut one of the reasons his own district is safe is that he spent 10 years in what might be called campaigning before being elected the first time in 1960 in his first bid for public office.\n\nHe had touched all the local bases before making the race—the Republican committee, five years as president of the. Montauk. District Board of Education and membership on a citizens’ committee to draft the town's first zoning ordinance and in the American Legion Post 501, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Montauk Lions Club, Suffolk County Council of the Boy Scouts and Star of East Lodge 843, F. & A. M.\n\nIs he a millionaire? “No, I'm not,” he answered. “The famous family fortune doesn't exist. I'm what they call upper middle class.”\n\nIt's a comfortable class. He owns about 150 acres of land in Suffolk, in Maine and, in the Bahamas and even has a small duck‐hunting cabin in the marshes of. Eastern Maryland. He also owns a major interest in The Portel, a motel on the water in Montauk where guests can arrive by boat or plane.\n\n“Living out here an airplane is a must,” he said. If everyone could afford one, it might save the Long Island Railroad from coming out to its last stop.”\n\nMr. Duryea emphasized that his style of life—he drives a two‐year‐old station wagon with an American flag decal on the back window to work—is far removed from that of the Rockefellers.\n\n“Who knows how he lives when the big gates swing closed up there,” he said of Governor Rockefeller and the sprawling, guarded family estate at Pocantico Hills.\n\nIf that remark sounded a bit cool toward Mr. Rockefeller, it may have been no accident. The two Republicans clashed politely but firmly this year in Albany as Mr. Duryea pushed hard for massive cuts in the state budget and now the Speaker refers to the Governor tonelessly as “N.A.R.” in conversation.\n\nFriends generally agree that the Duryeas are not in the same financial class as the Roosevelts, Harrimans and Lehmans—families that have produced New York Governors. But the same friends also think Mr. Duryea's ambitions are just as big.\n\n“Perry's a guy who is perfectly capable of putting in a day's work,” one said. “But you've got to remember, he's not after money, he's after influence.”"
