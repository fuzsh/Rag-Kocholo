COMMITTEE ORGANIZATION I. History and Jurisdiction of the Committee The Committee on Government Reform serves both as the House of Representative's government operations committee and also as its chief investigative and oversight body, reviewing allegations of waste, fraud and mismanagement across the Federal Government. Alone among the House committees, the Committee on Government Reform has legislative jurisdiction over the operations of all Federal agencies including, human resources, information technology, procurement, and financial and general management policy. Unlike other House committees, the committee has the authority to conduct oversight and investigations outside of its legislative jurisdiction. The committee's unique legislative jurisdiction and oversight authority make it one of the most influential committees in the House of Representatives. Congressman Tom Davis (R-VA) served as the chairman of the committee in the 108th Congress. The ranking minority member was Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA). The Committee on Government Reform first appeared in 1927 as the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. It was created by consolidating the 11 Committees on Expenditures previously responsible for overseeing how taxpayer moneys were spent at each executive branch department. Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the committee was renamed the Committee on Government Operations. The name change was intended to communicate the primary function of the committee to study ``the operations of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining their economy and efficiency.'' The Government Operations Committee's oversight jurisdiction over all Federal agencies and departments was unprecedented in the legislative branch. On January 4, 1995, Republicans assumed control of the House of Representatives for the first time in over 40 years. Republicans immediately implemented several internal reforms, including an initiative to reduce the number of standing committees in the House and cut committee staffs by one-third. The Committee on Government Reform exemplified the changes that took place in the House. Both the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and the Committee on the District of Columbia were consolidated into the newly named Government Reform and Oversight Committee. The name change highlighted the Republican view that the Federal Government needed reform to ensure accountability. This consolidation of three committees into one resulted in millions of dollars in savings and a nearly 50 percent reduction in staff. At the start of the 107th Congress, the committee's name was shortened to the Committee on Government Reform. House Rule X, clause 1(h) sets forth the committee's jurisdiction, functions, and responsibilities as follows: 1. The Federal Civil Service, including intergovernmental personnel; and the status of officers and employees of the United States, including their compensation, classification, and retirement. 2. Municipal affairs of the District of Columbia in general (other than appropriations). 3. Federal paperwork reduction. 4. Government management and accounting measures generally. 5. Holidays and celebrations. 6. Overall economy, efficiency, and management of government operations and activities, including Federal procurement. 7. National Archives. 8. Population and demography generally, including the Census. 9. Postal Service generally, including transportation of the mails. 10. Public information and records. 11. Relationship of the Federal Government to the States and municipalities generally. 12. Reorganizations in the executive branch of the Government. Every standing committee, including the Committee on Government Reform, has general oversight responsibilities pursuant to House Rule X, clause 2. These responsibilities include the analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of Federal laws including the necessity or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation. The committees are also charged with determining whether laws and programs are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress and whether they should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated. Each standing committee is required to review and study on a continuing basis the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of laws and programs addressing subjects within its jurisdiction as well as the organization and operation of agencies within its jurisdiction. In addition to its general oversight responsibilities, the Committee on Government Reform has the following special and additional functions: Special oversight functions, Rule X, clause 3(e) The Committee on Government Reform shall review and study on a continuing basis the operation of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining their economy and efficiency. Additional functions of committees, Rule X clause 4(c) (1) The Committee on Government Reform shall-- (A) receive and examine reports of the Comptroller General of the United States and submit to the House such recommendations as it considers necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of the reports; (B) evaluate the effects of laws enacted to reorganize the legislative and executive branches of the Government; and (C) study intergovernmental relationships between the United States and the States and municipalities and between the United States and international organizations of which the United States is a member. (2) In addition to its duties under subparagraph (1), the Committee on Government Reform may at any time conduct investigations of any matter without regard to clause 1, 2, 3, or this clause conferring jurisdiction over the matter to another standing committee. The findings and recommendations of the committee in such an investigation shall be made available to any other standing committee having jurisdiction over the matter involved. In the 108th Congress, 44 members served on the committee, including 24 Republicans, 19 Democrats and 1 Independent. The committee had seven subcommittees. The jurisdiction of the subcommittees was established by committee resolution on February 13, 2003 along with the rules of the committee. The committee rules and the subcommittee resolution are reproduced below, followed by the subcommittee rosters for the 108th Congress. II. Rules and Organization of the Committee U.S. House of Representatives 108th Congress ---------- Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(A) of the House of Representatives provides: Except as provided in subdivision (B), the Rules of the House are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable. (B) A motion to recess from day to day, and a motion to dispense with the first reading (in full) of a bill or resolution, if printed copies are available, each shall be privileged in committees and subcommittees and shall be decided without debate. Rule XI, clause 2(a)(1) of the House of Representatives provides, in part: Each standing committee shall adopt written rules governing its procedure. In accordance with this, the Committee on Government Reform, on February 13, 2003, adopted the rules of the committee: Rule 1.--Application of Rules Except where the terms ``full committee'' and ``subcommittee'' are specifically referred to, the following rules shall apply to the Committee on Government Reform and its subcommittees as well as to the respective chairmen. Rule 2.--Meetings The regular meetings of the full committee shall be held on the second Tuesday of each month at 10 a.m., when the House is in session. The chairman is authorized to dispense with a regular meeting or to change the date thereof, and to call and convene additional meetings, when circumstances warrant. A special meeting of the committee may be requested by members of the committee following the provisions of House Rule XI, clause 2(c)(2). Subcommittees shall meet at the call of the subcommittee chairmen. Every member of the committee or the appropriate subcommittee, unless prevented by unusual circumstances, shall be provided with a memorandum at least three calendar days before each meeting or hearing explaining (1) the purpose of the meeting or hearing; and (2) the names, titles, background and reasons for appearance of any witnesses. The ranking minority member shall be responsible for providing the same information on witnesses whom the minority may request. Rule 3.--Quorums A majority of the members of the committee shall form a quorum, except that two members shall constitute a quorum for taking testimony and receiving evidence, and one-third of the members shall form a quorum for taking any action other than the reporting of a measure or recommendation. If the chairman is not present at any meeting of the committee or subcommittee, the ranking member of the majority party on the committee or subcommittee who is present shall preside at that meeting. Rule 4.--Committee Reports Bills and resolutions approved by the committee shall be reported by the chairman following House Rule XIII, clauses 2- 4. A proposed report shall not be considered in subcommittee or full committee unless the proposed report has been available to the members of such subcommittee or full committee for at least three calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless the House is in session on such days) before consideration of such proposed report in subcommittee or full committee. Any report will be considered as read if available to the members at least 24 hours before consideration, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays unless the House is in session on such days. If hearings have been held on the matter reported upon, every reasonable effort shall be made to have such hearings available to the members of the subcommittee or full committee before the consideration of the proposed report in such subcommittee or full committee. Every investigative report shall be approved by a majority vote of the committee at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Supplemental, minority, or additional views may be filed following House Rule XI, clause 2(l) and Rule XIII, clause 3(a)(1). The time allowed for filing such views shall be three calendar days, beginning on the day of notice, but excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays (unless the House is in session on such a day), unless the committee agrees to a different time, but agreement on a shorter time shall require the concurrence of each member seeking to file such views. An investigative or oversight report may be filed after sine die adjournment of the last regular session of Congress, provided that if a member gives timely notice of intention to file supplemental, minority or additional views, that member shall be entitled to not less than seven calendar days in which to submit such views for inclusion with the report. Only those reports approved by a majority vote of the committee may be ordered printed, unless otherwise required by the Rules of the House of Representatives. Rule 5.--Proxy Votes In accordance with the Rules of the House of Representatives, members may not vote by proxy on any measure or matter before the committee or any subcommittee. Rule 6.--Record Votes A record vote of the members may be had upon the request of any member upon approval of a one-fifth vote of the members present. Rule 7.--Record of Committee Actions The committee staff shall maintain in the committee offices a complete record of committee actions from the current Congress including a record of the rollcall votes taken at committee business meetings. The original records, or true copies thereof, as appropriate, shall be available for public inspection whenever the committee offices are open for public business. The staff shall assure that such original records are preserved with no unauthorized alteration, additions, or defacement. Rule 8.--Subcommittees; Referrals There shall be seven subcommittees with appropriate party ratios that shall have fixed jurisdictions. Bills, resolutions, and other matters shall be referred by the chairman to subcommittees within two weeks for consideration or investigation in accordance with their fixed jurisdictions. Where the subject matter of the referral involves the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee or does not fall within any previously assigned jurisdiction, the chairman shall refer the matter as he may deem advisable. Bills, resolutions, and other matters referred to subcommittees may be reassigned by the chairman when, in his judgement, the subcommittee is not able to complete its work or cannot reach agreement therein. In a subcommittee having an even number of members, if there is a tie vote with all members voting on any measure, the measure shall be placed on the agenda for full committee consideration as if it had been ordered reported by the subcommittee without recommendation. This provision shall not preclude further action on the measure by the subcommittee. Rule 9.--Ex Officio Members The chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee shall be ex officio members of all subcommittees. They are authorized to vote on subcommittee matters; but, unless they are regular members of the subcommittee, they shall not be counted in determining a subcommittee quorum other than a quorum for taking testimony. Rule 10.--Staff Except as otherwise provided by House Rule X, clauses 6, 7 and 9, the chairman of the full committee shall have the authority to hire and discharge employees of the professional and clerical staff of the full committee and of subcommittees. Rule 11.--Staff Direction Except as otherwise provided by House Rule X, clauses 6, 7 and 9, the staff of the committee shall be subject to the direction of the chairman of the full committee and shall perform such duties as he may assign. Rule 12.--Hearing Dates and Witnesses The chairman of the full committee will announce the date, place, and subject matter of all hearings at least one week before the commencement of any hearings, unless he determines, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee determines by a vote, that there is good cause to begin such hearings sooner. So that the chairman of the full committee may coordinate the committee facilities and hearings plans, each subcommittee chairman shall notify him of any hearing plans at least two weeks before the date of commencement of hearings, including the date, place, subject matter, and the names of witnesses, willing and unwilling, who would be called to testify, including, to the extent he is advised thereof, witnesses whom the minority members may request. The minority members shall supply the names of witnesses they intend to call to the chairman of the full committee or subcommittee at the earliest possible date. Witnesses appearing before the committee shall so far as practicable, submit written statements at least 24 hours before their appearance and, when appearing in a non-governmental capacity, provide a curriculum vitae and a listing of any Federal Government grants and contracts received in the previous fiscal year. Rule 13.--Open Meetings Meetings for the transaction of business and hearings of the committee shall be open to the public or closed in accordance with Rule XI of the House of Representatives. Rule 14.--Five-Minute Rule (1) A committee member may question a witness only when recognized by the chairman for that purpose. In accordance with House Rule XI, clause 2(j)(2), each committee member may request up to five minutes to question a witness until each member who so desires has had such opportunity. Until all such requests have been satisfied, the chairman shall, so far as practicable, recognize alternately based on seniority of those majority and minority members present at the time the hearing was called to order and others based on their arrival at the hearing. After that, additional time may be extended at the direction of the chairman. (2) The chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee by motion, may permit an equal number of majority and minority members to question a witness for a specified, total period that is equal for each side and not longer than thirty minutes for each side. (3) The chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee by motion, may permit committee staff of the majority and minority to question a witness for a specified, total period that is equal for each side and not longer than thirty minutes for each side. (4) Nothing in paragraph (2) or (3) affects the rights of a Member (other than a Member designated under paragraph (2)) to question a witness for 5 minutes in accordance with paragraph (1) after the questioning permitted under paragraph (2) or (3). In any extended questioning permitted under paragraph (2) or (3), the chairman shall determine how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by majority members or majority committee staff and the ranking minority member shall determine how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by minority members or minority committee staff. The chairman or the ranking minority member, as applicable, may allocate the time for any extended questioning permitted to staff under paragraph (3) to members. Rule 15.--Investigative Hearing Procedures Investigative hearings shall be conducted according to the procedures in House Rule XI, clause 2(k). All questions put to witnesses before the committee shall be relevant to the subject matter before the committee for consideration, and the chairman shall rule on the relevance of any questions put to the witnesses. Rule 16.--Stenographic Record A stenographic record of all testimony shall be kept of public hearings and shall be made available on such conditions as the chairman may prescribe. Rule 17.--Audio and Visual Coverage of Committee Proceedings (1) An open meeting or hearing of the committee or a subcommittee may be covered, in whole or in part, by television broadcast, radio broadcast, Internet broadcast, and still photography, unless closed subject to the provisions of House Rule XI, clause 2(g). Any such coverage shall conform with the provisions of House Rule XI, clause 4. (2) Use of the Committee Broadcast System shall be fair and nonpartisan, and in accordance with House Rule XI, clause 4(b), and all other applicable rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Reform. Members of the committee shall have prompt access to a copy of coverage by the Committee Broadcast System, to the extent that such coverage is maintained. (3) Personnel providing coverage of an open meeting or hearing of the committee or a subcommittee by Internet broadcast, other than through the Committee Broadcast System, shall be currently accredited to the Radio and Television Correspondents' Galleries. Rule 18.--Additional Duties of Chairman The chairman of the full committee shall: (a) Make available to other committees the findings and recommendations resulting from the investigations of the committee or its subcommittees as required by House Rule X, clause 4(c)(2); (b) Direct such review and studies on the impact or probable impact of tax policies affecting subjects within the committee's jurisdiction as required by House Rule X, clause 2(c); (c) Submit to the Committee on the Budget views and estimates required by House Rule X, clause 4(f), and to file reports with the House as required by the Congressional Budget Act; (d) Authorize and issue subpoenas as provided in House Rule XI, clause 2(m), in the conduct of any investigation or activity or series of investigations or activities within the jurisdiction of the committee; (e) Prepare, after consultation with subcommittee chairmen and the minority, a budget for the committee which shall include an adequate budget for the subcommittees to discharge their responsibilities; (f) Make any necessary technical and conforming changes to legislation reported by the committee upon unanimous consent; and (g) Designate a vice chairman from the majority party. Rule 19.--Commemorative Stamps The committee has adopted the policy that the determination of the subject matter of commemorative stamps properly is for consideration by the Postmaster General and that the committee will not give consideration to legislative proposals for the issuance of commemorative stamps. It is suggested that recommendations for the issuance of commemorative stamps be submitted to the Postmaster General. Rule 20.--Panels and Task Forces (a) The chairman of the committee is authorized to appoint panels or task forces to carry out the duties and functions of the committee. (b) The chairman and ranking minority member of the committee may serve as ex-officio members of each panel or task force.

(e) No panel or task force so appointed shall continue in existence for more than six months. A panel or task force so appointed may, upon the expiration of six months, be reappointed by the chairman.

Legislative Accomplishments The Committee on Government Reform was very successful in the 108th Congress in improving the operations and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Significant reforms were made to modernize the Defense Department's 700,000 employee Civil Service system and reform the Federal acquisition system, enabling the government to fully utilize private sector technology and innovation to make Federal agencies more service and technology-oriented. The committee championed landmark legislation providing families and children in the Nation's Capital with enhanced educational choices, expanding opportunities for students in under-performing D.C. elementary and secondary schools. Improving Accountability in Federal Employment Government Reform, in coordination with the Armed Services Committee, succeeded in bringing the Department of Defense civilian workforce into the 21st century by allowing the Department to shed the shackles of a 50-year old Civil Service system and replace it with a new system that will enable the Department to meet today's diverse national security threats. The committee also succeeded in other agency specific personnel reforms for NASA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the GAO. In terms of government-wide Civil Service reforms, the committee transformed the Senior Executive Service into a pay-for- performance organization, and authorized government-wide Civil Service reforms for all agencies. Making Better use of Technology in Government Holding true to our agenda, the committee championed reforms to the Federal acquisition system as part of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003, building on the critical procurement reform initiatives of the 1990s by recognizing that the economy and the needs of our government have become increasingly service and technology oriented. In improving the way Federal agencies acquire goods, the legislation made the Federal Government leaner, more responsible and more accountable to taxpayers. Further improvements were made to streamline the acquisition system as part of the Acquisition System Improvements Act, which was enacted into law in 2004. Providing Choices in Education for DC Parents The committee also succeeded in providing Federal scholarship funds for children to attend private elementary and high schools, providing parents and kids with an alternative to being condemned to the under-performing public schools in the Nation's Capital. The committee also worked on other legislative initiatives to improve the operations of the District government and the quality of life in the District. For example, the committee advocated for the first annual DC authorization bill, providing a vehicle for Congress to consider changes to Federal law that would impact the District, without requiring the city to lobby appropriators to consider authorizing issues. Improving the Organization and Efficiency of the Government The committee also made improvements to the financial management practices of the Department of Homeland Security by strengthening the agency's CFO. Finally, the House passed one of the chairman's top priorities--reauthorization of the Executive Reorganization Authority--as part of the September 11 intelligence reform legislation. Reauthorizing this authority will continue to be a top priority for the committee in the 109th Congress. After all, the deliberations over the creation of a Department of Homeland Security and a National Intelligence Director have clearly demonstrated Congress' inability to overcome its internal turf battles in order to improve the organizational structure and operations of the Federal Government. The following sections of this report list legislation within the committee's jurisdiction that was considered either in committee or in the House during the 108th Congress. Section A lists the bills that were in some form enacted into public law. Section B lists bills that were considered by the House but were not enacted into law in any form. Section C lists bills that were considered by the committee but did not reach the House floor. Bills designating postal facilities and resolutions are listed separately in sections D and E. A.
