        "text": "I always knew I wanted to join the Foreign Service. It ran in the family. My father, a widely published writer of prose and verse in numerous languages whom I loved and admired greatly, was also a diplomat who served in France, Belgium, Italy and Mexico, where my brother and I, as Foreign Service brats, grew up in the 1950s and 60s. Far more a poet than a bureaucrat, my father avoided the “embassy compound life” as much as possible, mingling and engaging (in his job as Cultural Attaché, or, as it was then known in the State Department, Super CAO*) with local luminaries in the arts and academic life, often inviting them home where his family was grateful, but sometimes awed, to meet such august guests. In his own, idiosyncratic way, my father worked for the U.S. taxpayer non-stop almost twenty-four hours a day, but, incapable of wasting time, he made sure that most of his day was spent outside the office (when asked at receptions what he did at the embassy, he wittily replied “as little mischief as possible”). His job, as he saw it, was to show, to the best and the brightest abroad, that America was a complex and diverse country that had much to offer to the rest of the world, including in the realm of high culture, and especially literature, in which he was an expert (a word he hated), having written widely praised books on the subject. He would have certainly agreed, in his more optimistic moments — which regrettably were not always part of his life, due to what he considered the sorry state of the modern world — with Aimé Césaire’s aphorism that “Contact between cultures is the oxygen of civilization.”\n\nAs I pursued my education in languages and the humanities, the Foreign Service was never very far from my mind, in part because I was always in touch with that exceptional man, my late father **. Soon after I received a PhD from Princeton in 1977 in Russian history, one of my advisers asked me (if I recall properly) the rather blunt question: “Well, Brown, when are you going to get a job?” Not trying to be entirely facetious, I replied, “To be honest, I never wanted to work anyway.” In my fashion, what I was telling the good anxious professor was that I was ready for a Foreign Service career rather than seeking tenure in academia, despite the intellectual satisfaction it can provide. My hope was to serve in socialist Eastern Europe, given my specialized interest in that part of the world, which as a baby boomer had intrigued me as the ideological challenge that America, had to face after World War II.\n\nWhile employed by the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies and as an editor on a joint U.S.-Soviet publication of historical documents on early Russian-American relations (1765-1815), I took the Foreign Service exam several times, finally passing both its oral and written sections in 1980. My first posting, as a USIA [United States Information Agency] officer, was in London, which I always think was due to a personnel error, given my name (I still ask myself: Did they pick the wrong John Brown?). Then, it was off to an unforgettable and rewarding “press and culture” career in Prague, Krakow, Tallinn (on Temporary tour of Duty [TDY]), Kiev, Belgrade and, finally, Moscow, where I served as CAO — not the Super CAO my father had been, but I hope the kind of CAO he would at least not have disapproved of — if only because I, his admiring son, never spent too much time in the office.\n\n____________________________\n\n* CAO: “Cultural Affairs Officer,” a military-type term used by the Foreign Service bureaucracy to make sure that being engaged in cultural diplomacy sounds sufficiently “serious” and “American” (attaché is far too foreign a word for U.S. domestic consumption). “Super” is the informal part of the title, used by FSOs in the past century to describe the quality of the persons, who are today very much part of the past, then chosen for the position.\n\n** My father’s papers, kept in the Special Collections Division of Georgetown University, consist of some eighty boxes of materials, and would make fascinating source materials for a study on U.S.-European cultural relations during the Cold War. Professor John L. Brown corresponded with some of the most important people of that epoch. For a partial calendar of his papers, see http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/cl167.htm\n\nSelecting the Foreign Service as a career came effortlessly to me. I guess I wanted to be “a diplomat” ever since I knew that such a profession existed, when we began to get some serious history at school in about the 7th grade. But the origins of this interest went back even further and to multiple sources. As a child I loved geography and assiduously collected stamps, living a vicarious understanding of foreign places through them. I also picked up a small collection of Chinese coins (with square holes in them) and a print of the destruction of the Chinese Navy, my reward for accompanying a beloved aunt on her tours of Connecticut antique stores. This same aunt took me as a little kid on my first trip to New York’s Chinatown. Enjoying foreign foods became part of my interest in living abroad. I became enamored of an early 1950s TV series called “China Smith”, starring Dan Duryea, an American adventurer who prowled the back streets of Singapore. I began to have dreams of exotic adventures. As a kid also, I was heavily interested in war movies and most of my toys consisted of toy soldiers, tanks, cannons and model fighter planes. Moving to suburban Los Angeles, in our neighborhood “playing war” was the alternative to soft ball as a street diversion. My older brother used to taunt me with chants of “Danny loves the Army.”\n\nBut it was in junior high that I really discovered that diplomats played a crucial role in avoiding or ending wars, and their work seemed more interesting to me. I believe it was in the 8th grade that we had a half semester course on vocational choices. I was able to find considerable material on the US Foreign Service to make my final presentation. Aside from writing away to the State Department, I discovered that a major New York insurance company put out pamphlets on different professions and ordered one which convinced me this was the career for me.\n\nAnother thing helped propel me towards diplomacy in school: our school library was rich in resources on history, and I checked out many books about famous international people and events, from Marco Polo to Commodore Mathew C. Perry. I must say that I had some really outstanding high school social studies teachers. Finally, growing up in a Mexican American California neighborhood-home of Ritchie Valens–we were offered Spanish from the seventh grade on, and I had six years of it before reaching college. Not particularly caring for math or science, I majored in Spanish in high school and took a variety of courses such as speech (and joined the debating team, which prepared me to discuss many world issues), journalism (including working on the school paper) and business law and was sent during one summer to an Honors Course in International Relations. I graduated as my class valedictorian with a 4.2 GPA due to the honors course counting as a double 5.0. Taking international relations at UCLA, I continued to study Spanish, including a year abroad in Madrid, and-already specializing in Latin American Studies–took Portuguese just as the bossa nova was catching attention. I continued on to a two year graduate program at the School of International Affairs at Columbia University, where the United Nations played a big role in people’s thinking about foreign relations.\n\nDespite all of this preparation for a diplomatic career, I became painfully aware that not everyone passed the Foreign Service Examination. It was out of a sense of anxiety that I took the exam during my first year at SIA. Low and behold, I passed the exam, but just barely: I received a 69.5, and my score got rounded up to a passing 70! And what a curious thing that in my second year at SIA the State Department announced that for the first time in years it would not give the exam that year. As a result, I was the only member of my SIA class to enter the Foreign Service upon graduation. But getting into the Service would not be so easy. The war in Vietnam created a huge problem. Columbia University in 1968 had gone through a veritable student revolution over the war. It had largely been closed down by demonstrations led by the SDS and Mark Rudd and a group of African-American students. I was not a student revolutionary, but I had become an anti-War activist and joined the Gene McCarthy for President Campaign, which led to the resignation of President Lyndon Johnson and, unfortunately in my view, the election of Richard B. Nixon. (It was there I learned the law of unintended consequences.)\n\nI received a letter from the State Department informing me that normal entrance into the Foreign Service was not available at this time, but anyone who had passed the exam agreeing to spend 18 months on an assignment in Vietnam in the “pacification program” would be considered for entry. I wrote back saying that I could not possibly agree to volunteer to go to Vietnam having opposed the war. I received a letter back informing me that I could do as I wished, but should be aware that if in the future I was admitted to the Foreign Service, I might be assigned to Vietnam and I would not have an option to choose another assignment, but would have to resign if I did not accept it. I figured I would never get admitted to the Foreign Service, but I was wrong.\n\nShortly after the exchange of letters, I received a regular admission into the Foreign Service. And after going through six weeks of the A-100 Course, lo and behold, I was assigned to the pacification program in Vietnam. Five members of my 19-person A-100 class had agreed to go to Vietnam before entry into the Service. Three of us who had refused the offer were assigned to Vietnam anyway. I was the only one of the three to accept the assignment to the pacification program. One fellow resigned and the other was allowed a regular diplomatic assignment at the Embassy in Saigon. But this only happened after I personally assured the Director General of the Foreign Service that I would not raise an objection to his assignment there. This was only possible, because, unlike me, he had not specified his objection to the war when he turned down the first opportunity to join the Service and had not received the warning that I had.\n\nAlthough I went to Vietnam under protest, I cannot say that my experiences there were not interesting and to some extent rewarding. Perhaps, Latin America had been a diversion from my real interest in Asia and my “forced” Vietnam assignment had fulfilled that interest. I was now “China Smith.” Following a full year of language training, I went to Vietnam fully prepared for the job. And spending six months in the provinces as a grass roots development adviser visiting hamlets and villages every day, I came to speak Vietnamese and understand the people quite well. Soon I was assigned to carry out pretty much the kind of work that regular Foreign Service Officers had been assigned to do, provincial reporting. I could write myself a ticket on Air America to go anywhere in Central Vietnam or Saigon. Most of my reporting was on the failure of the South Vietnamese government to govern honestly and wisely, including the lead up to the one-man election of 1971. I documented why the GVN had failed to “win the hearts and minds” of its own people. Elsewhere (the Foreign Service Journal, December1992), I have written more about the Foreign Service Officers who dissented on Vietnam and Cambodia, but here I will just leave it that my first assignment to a controversial war was certainly a unique and challenging way of entering the Foreign Service."
