        "text": "3\n\nTHE EARLIEST ORGANIZATION OF RECORD.\n\nHon. Lewis Clephane, of Washington, D. C., has furnished the compiler with a pamphlet on the \"Birth of the Republican Party,\" in which the claim is broadly made that the initiatory proceedings towards the organization of the Republican party were commenced by the Republican Association of Washington in 1855, and led up to the February convention in Pittsburg in 1856.\n\nThe compiler does not assume thus to settle the question of origin, for there are several other claimants in a general way, for the honor; but he submits an abridgment of Mr. Clephane's pamphlet as an introduction to the reports of the conventions that follow, for the very good reason that no other authentic record has been accessible, relative to the inauguration of the great Republican organization which carried the nation through a civil war, and preserved the Union of States, and which has administered the government for the greater part of the last thirty years.\n\nTHE WASHINGTON REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION.\n\nOn the 19th of June, 1855, a small club was organized in Washington and issued the following as its platform:\n\nDECLARATION, PLATFORM AND CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLICAN ASSOCIATION OF WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\nWhereas, by the repeal of the eighth section of the act for the admission of Missouri into the Union, the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska have been opened to the introduction of slavery, and all the compromises, real or imginary, upon that subject, are thus violated and annulled, and deep dishonor inflicted upon the age in which we live:\n\nNow, therefore, in co-operation with all those throughout the land who oppose this and other similar measures, which we deem to be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and which are designed to extend and perpetuate slavery, we do associate ourselves together, under the name and title of THE REPUBLICAN ASSOCIATION OF WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nAnd we adopt the following as our political Platform, to wit:\n\nFIRST. That Congress possesses no power over the institution of slavery in the several States; but that, outside of State jurisdiction,\n\n4\n\nthe constitutional power of the Federal Government should be exerted to secure LIFE, LIBERTY and HAPPINESS to all men, and therefore,\n\nSECOND. There should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime, in any of the Territories of the United States.\n\nTHIRD. The people are the rightful source of all political power; and all officers should, as far as practicable, be chosen, by a direct vote of the people.\n\nFOURTH. Candidates for political offices should be men of undoubted integrity and sobriety, and pledged to support the principles of this Platform by all lawful and constitutional means.\n\nNo president was elected at that meeting, but efforts were made to induce Hon. Francis P. Blair, Sr., to accept the presidency. He declined.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1856, there was published and circulated largely by the Washington Association an appeal to the country to organize clubs, as follows:\n\nA CIRCULAR TO THE FRIENDS OF THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.\n\nREPUBLICAN ROOMS, WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 17, 1856.\n\nDear Sir.--The undersigned have been appointed a committee, on the part of the association, whose declaration, platform and constitution accompany this, to address a circular letter to our Republican friends, urging upon their attention the importance of immediate and thorough organization of clubs or associations, somewhat similar to our own, in every city, town, and village in the Union.\n\nThe power and influence of these organizations cannot be overestimated by the friends of freedom. They are all important to carry on a political campaign, and it will be a matter of impossibility to compete with those arrayed against us in the approaching contest without them. They are the most powerful and only efficient means for bringing out, concentrating, and making known our true strength. They will serve to rally the people, inspire them with confidence and enthusiasm, and furnish the information necessary to expose and fairly meet the sophistry of pro-slavery demagogues. We have seen the power of these associations fully manifested in recent elections. Let the friends of freedom learn wisdom even from their enemies. We go into the contest as a new and untried party, opposing old and well-organized parties sustained and backed by Government patronage or bound together by old party ties. We must compel these parties to show where they stand on the only great issue now before the country--Slavery or Freedom. We must force them to array themselves on one side or the other of this question, and consider every man who is not openly and avowedly on the side of freedom as against it. How, then, is this to be done, unless the friends of freedom are themselves united? And how can they be better and more efficiently united than by these organizations?\n\nAgain we recommend prompt organization. If there be but six persons in your town who sympathize with you in this movement, organize with these six. Do not despair. If a Republican Association can be put in successful operation in Washington\n\n5\n\nCity, under the immediate frown of the National Government, and in a city dedicated to slavery, where is there the city, town, or village, in the North, East, or West, that cannot do likewise?\n\nWe appeal, sir, to you, to make this a personal duty--to set about at once bringing the friends of the Republican Movement together, for the purpose of organization on a platform similar to the one which accompanies this, and which you will find so liberal on the slavery question that every man, who is not entirely wedded to slavery and its interests, may stand upon it, without its interfering with any of his former party predilections.\n\nAnd now, a word as to the association we represent. You will perceive in the 4th and 5th articles of the Constitution its main object. We propose to act in concert with the Republican Members of Congress, and all Associations that may be formed throughout the States, similar to our own, as a \"National Committee,\" for the dissemination of political information among the masses. We have taken a Hall in a central position, established a Reading-room for the benefit of our visiting Republican friends, and have made arrangements for the issue in pamphlet form of all important speeches that may be made during the present Congress. We have also engaged the services of a very competent German translator, with the intention, should the means be afforded, to have many of the speeches translated into the German language.\n\nIt must be apparent to you that the comparatively few who compose this Association cannot contribute all the funds necessary to carry on so important a work; nor can the Members of Congress, who always expend large sums in the publication of their speeches, be expected to meet all the demands of a Presidential campaign, however liberally disposed they may be. It is often desirable to distribute hundreds of thousands of copies of a single speech, or other publication, which, of course, cannot be done without considerable expense.\n\nHow, then, is this expense to be met, and how are these speeches, &c., to be circulated? Simply through the active exertions of these proposed organizations, in collecting-and forwarding funds and names for that purpose. The Administration party are already at work. livery office-holder is regularly assessed to meet the expenses of the campaign. We have no such facilities, nor do we desire any such. Our aid must come from the voluntary contributions of the people. Will any doubt for a moment the utility of scattering broadcast over our land such documents and speeches as will have a tendency to enlighten the public mind on all those exciting questions which will more or less engross their attention during the approaching- important political crisis? We think not.\n\nWe have every facility here, through our Republican friends in Congress, of issuing speeches and other documents, at the least possible expense; and by the voluntary labors of the members of the Association in directing, and the co-operation of Members of Congress, we hope to have the people fully supplied with the right kind of political reading matter.\n\nWe have therefore to request that, should you organize a Republican Association, or should there be one already in existence in your place, you will urge upon its members the importance of at once collecting funds for the purpose of procuring and disseminating the proper kind of documents among the masses,\n\n6\n\neither by your Association or our \"National Committee.\" These speeches and documents can be directed, singly, to such names as you may send us, or they can be put up in packages and sent to any one person (free of postage), to be by him distributed, as may best suit the parties ordering.\n\nWe also particularly make the following requests:\n\n1. That the names of the officers of each Association formed be sent us, as speedily after its organization as possible, and, when practicable, the number of its members.\n\n2. That a list be made out, and forwarded, of all persons in your vicinity to whom it way be desirable to forward speeches and other documents--not only friends of the cause, but persons of all parties--and marking, opposite each name on the list so sent, to which of the political parties the individual belongs, that we may send documents adapted to each particular case. These lists will be entered in books to be kept for that purpose by our Association, and suitable documents will from time to time be sent them.\n\n3. Much good might be accomplished by each Association regularly corresponding with the one here, giving information relative to the state of things in their several precincts, or general political intelligence.\n\nIn conclusion, and even at the hazard of being considered importunate, let us again urge the importance of an immediate and thorough Organization.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDANIEL R. GOODLOE,\n\nH. S. BROWN\n\nLEWIS CLEPHANE,\n\nCommittee.\n\nAddress, \"L. Clephane, Secretary Republican Association, Washington, D. C.\"\n\n7\n\nTHE PITTSBURG CONVENTION.\n\nTHE FIRST CALL.\n\nA call for a National Convention was issued January 17,1856, for a meeting to be held at Pittsburgh Pa., on the 22d day of February, 1856.\n\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 17,1856.\n\nTo the Republicans of the United States:\n\nIn accordance with what appears to be the general desire of the Republican Party, and at the suggestion of a large portion of the Republican press, the undersigned, chairmen of the State Republican Committees of Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, hereby invite the Republicans of the Union to meet in informal Convention at Pittsburg, on the 22d February, 1856, for the purpose of perfecting the National Organization, and providing for a National Delegate Convention of the Republican Party, at some subsequent day, to nominate candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, to be supported at the election in November, 1856.\n\nA. P. STONE, of Ohio.\n\nJ.Z. GOODRICH, of Mass.\n\nAVID WILMOT, of Pa.\n\nLAWRENCE BRAINERD, of Vt.\n\nWILLIAM A. WHITE, of Wis.\n\nPursuant to this call the Pittsburg Convention assembled.\n\nOn the evening of February 21st an informal meeting of delegates to the Convention was held in the parlors of the Monongahela Hotel, Pittsburg, for the purpose of a preliminary arrangement of the Convention. After consultation, it was decided to select one man from each state, and request them to meet at 8 o'clock next morning.\n\nAfter some difficulty the following gentlemen were gathered together: Owen Lovejoy, of Ill.; Hon. William Dennison, of Ohio; Edward D. Morgan, of NewYork; Geo. K.S. Bingham, of Michigan; J. W. Stone, of Boston, C. M. K. Puleston, of New Jersey, and Lewis Clephane, of Washington. At that meeting a plan for the organization of the Convention, including the selection of Hon. Francis P. Blair, Sr., for president of the convention was adopted, and Owen Lovejoy was selected to open the Convention with prayer.\n\n8\n\nHorace Greeley's Daily and Mail Report to the New York Tribune.\n\n(Compiled from files of the New York Tribune, by courtesy of Hon. WHITELAW REID.) THE LATEST NEWS RECEIVED BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.\n\nPITTSBURG, Thursday, Feb. 21,1856.\n\nThe Republican Convention tomorrow will be far more numerously attended than was anticipated. Delegates from twelve states and the Territory of Minnesota are already here with Mr. Wood, from Kansas. There is a free conference this evening. Francis P. Blair will probably be president. Joshua R. Giddings and Wm. Allison are the only Members of Congress I have yet seen, but there are many ex-Members. Maryland and Kentucky are the only Slave States as yet represented, but a Delegate from Missouri is expected. Nineteen Delegates from New York, including all who left the City yesterday morning, are present. The general desire is to act firmly, but prudently.\n\nH. G.\n\nSECOND DISPATCH, 10 P. M.\n\nAn informal preliminary meeting of Republican Delegates has been held this evening and largely attended. Lieutenant-Gov. Bingham, of Michigan, presided. Mr. Wood, of Kansas, was among the speakers. A meeting of Republican editors is now assembling at the St. Charles. The Convention will organize at ten to-morrow morning.\n\nH. G.\n\nTo the Associated Press:\n\nA large number of the Delegates to the Republican Convention arrived here to-day and among them are Joshua R. Giddings and D. F. Kimball, of Ohio, Gov. Bingham, of Michigan, and Horace Greeley, of New York.\n\nThe convention will be one of the most important ever held here.\n\nAn informal meeting of delegates takes place this evening to arrange preliminaries.\n\nTHE LATEST NEWS RECEIVED BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH. The Republican Convention Editorial Correspondence of the N. Y. Tribune. FIRST DAY.\n\nPITTSBURG, Friday, Feb. 22.\n\nThe Republican Convention is very numerously attended, all the Free States being represented, with citizens of Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky and Missouri. John A. King was elected President pro tern. Francis P. Blair is permanent President. There were brief speeches this morning by Messrs. Greeley, Giddings, Gibson, of Ohio, Codding and Lovejoy, of Illinois, and others. A strong Committee on Address and Resolution was appointed. More delegates are announced by telegraph as on the way. All is enthusiasm and harmony.\n\nH. G.\n\n9\n\nSECOND DISPATCH\n\nThe Republican Convention has completed its first day's session, and has accomplished much to cement former political differences and distinctions and here to mark the inauguration of a National party, based upon the principles of Freedom. The gathering is very large and the enthusiasm unbounded. Men are acting in the most perfect harmony and with a unity of feeling seldom known to political assemblages of this magnitude. The body is eminently Republican in principle and tendency. It combines much of character and talent, with integrity of purpose and devotion to the great principles which underlie our Government. Its moral and political effect upon the country will be felt for the next quarter of a century. In its deliberations everything has been conducted with marked propriety and dignity. The appointment of the Hon. F. P. Blair as President was hailed with unbounded enthusiasm.\n\nThe scene which followed was exciting beyond description. Cheers went forth and handkerchiefs were waved for some minutes after he took his seat as presiding- officer. The great Hall has been crowded throughout the day and during the evening. Hundreds went away because it was not possible to gain admittance. The day has been principally occupied by the Committees in preparing their reports and by the Delegates in Committee of the Whole in listening to speeches from eminent gentlemen who represent the several States. Among the most effective speeches of the occasion is one made by Mr. Remline, of Cincinati. It was pointed and eloquent and was received with much applause. The speaker has until recently been a supporter of the Administration. He is now thoroughly Republican. The Committee on Address will not report until to-morrow morning. The business of perfecting a National organization will come up to-morrow forenoon. Adjourned.\n\nH. G.\n\nSECOND DAY.\n\nPittsburg, Saturday, Feb. 23, 1856.\n\nThe Convention met at 9 o'clock. In the absence of the President, who was in attendance at a meeting of the Committe on Address and Resolutions, Mr. Sherman, of New Jersey, took the chair at the opening of the session. A great part of the morning was spent in speaking. Mr. Arney, of Illinois, stated that as the various committees were not ready to report, the time of the Convention might be occupied by addresses, and he moved that one delegate from each state represented be invited to speak, each one being limited to ten minutes. The motion was adopted, and Mr. Stone, of Massachusetts, presented the condition of parties in that state, affirming that the number of Republicans was increasing. Mr. Bunce, of Connecticut, said there was no Republican party in that state, but he hoped that there soon would be. He pledged Connecticut for them at the coming Presidential election. Mr. Burrough, of New York, noticed the gentlemen had been\n\n10\n\nspeaking for several states. He had but a short history to relate, He (Bunce) had said all we had to do was to go home and enjoy victory. He (Borrough) wished it was so in New York. We have many organizations embittered against us to overcome before we can succeed. To be successful we must exercise prudence. It is easy to make a small party on the Slavery question. To do this we can purchase Gerrett Smith's patent right; but to establish a large party, we must. make concession. He thought a large portion of the American party could be brought over to their cause. Mr. Clephane, of the District of Columbia, spoke commendingly of the efforts of the Washington. Republican Association. Gov. Binghain, of Michigan, read a long letter from Cassius M. Clay to the Washington Association commending the Republicans present.\n\nDr. Gazzam, of Pittsburgh, spoke briefly of the progress of Anti-Slavery in this quarter. He invited the Members of the Convention to attend the Kansas Aid meeting to-night.\n\nThe Committee on Organization, through their Chairman, Mr. Julian, of Indiana, made a report. It recommended the following-National Executive Committee:\n\nMorgan, of New York, Chairman; Fogg, of New Hampshire; Banks, of Massachusetts; Brainard, of Vermont; Niles, of Connecticut; Chase, of Rhode Island; Stone, of Ohio; Iceland, of Illinois; Spooner, of Wisconsin; Clephane, of District of Columbia; Paulison, of New Jersey; ------------, of Delaware; Wilmot, of Pennsylvania; Blair, of Missouri; Field, of Kentucky; Stephens, of Iowa; Gross, of Indiana; Dickie, of Michigan; ----------, of Virginia; Blair, of Maryland.\n\nThe report further recommended that the National Executive Committee be authorized to add to their number one Member from each state not represented, and to fill vacancies; also the holding of the National Convention for the nomination, of President and Vice-President at Philadelphia, on the 17th of June, to consist of Delegates from each state double the number of their representation in Congress, and that the Republicans of each state be recommended to complete their organization at the earliest moment, by the appointment of State and County Committees, and the formation of clubs in every town and township throughout the land. The Committee on Address and Resolution reported, through their Chairman, Abijah Mann, of New York. The Address commences by expressing unalterable attachment to the Union, and a determination to preserve it; at the same time it recommends all true Republicans to oppose further extension of Slavery. It should be kept where it now exists.\n\nA history of the various acts of the General Government regarding Slavery was given, and an account of the recent doings\n\n11\n\nin Kansas. Congress has a constitutional right to exclude Slavery from territories. It has no right to confer popular soverignty on Kansas and Nebraska, thus giving away its own authority over territories. The Address calls upon all Republicans to support the Constitution against the assaults of its enemies, and recommends energetic measures for the election of candidates for the Presidential Convention.\n\nThe resolutions are in substance as follows:\n\nFirst. Demands repeal of all laws allowing the introduction of Slavery into Territories once consecrated to Freedom, and the resistance by constitutional means of the existence of Slavery in any Territory.\n\nSecond. Support by all lawful measures the Free-State men in Kansas in their resistance to the usurped authority of lawless invaders, and favors its immediate admission into the Union as a Free State.\n\nThird. Strongly urges the Republican Organization to resist and overthrow the present National Administration, as it is identified with the progress of the Slave power to national supremacy.\n\nOn motion of Mr. Spaulding, of Ohio, the address and resolutions were adopted with nine cheers.\n\nMr. Remelin, of Ohio, said the address should have taken ground against the Know-Nothing, in order to bring in the German population.\n\nMr. Bond, of South Carolina, moved that a Committee of Safety be appointed to meet any emergency that may arise in case of conflict in Kansas with the Federal troops.\n\nA motion that the proceedings be printed in pamphlet form, and circulated, was adopted. Thanks to the officers of the Convention and the citizens of Pittsburg were voted and the Convention adjourned.\n\nSine die\n\n12\n\nREPUBLICANS MASS MEETING\n\nPITTSBURG, Saturday, Feb. 23, 1856.\n\nA large mass meeting was held here to-night to aid the emigration to Kansas, of those who feel determined to use every means to secure the establishment there of a Free State, and to aid such of the present inhabitants of Kansas as have declared themselves against what is termed lawless aggression and unconstitutional coercion. George W. Jackson was the President of the meeting, and D. D. Baton Secretary. The proceedings of a former meeting were read and approved and a constitution adopted.\n\nHorace Greeley addressed the meeting. He recounted the difficulties which surrounded settlers in Kansas and said that we must do all we can for them. He hoped they would be so well armed there, that no fighting would be necessary. There was no fear of the Kansas Free settlers being the aggressors. He recommended those who wish to hew out an honest competency to go and settle in Kansas, assuring them that it was destined to be a Free State.\n\nThe Hon.Geo. Darsie and Wm. E. Stevenson were then appointed to receive subscriptions.\n\nMr. Wood, from Kansas, was called to the stand. He said he rejoiced at this demonstration to-night. It proved that the young-sister \"Kansas,\" was not forgotten. He had resided in Kansas for eighteen months and had within that period seen armed hordes of Missourians--ten thousand of them headed by prominent men of the United States, such as Colonel Doniphan, Colonel Young, Vice-President Atchison, and others. He concluded by telling many anecdotes of the bravery of the men and women of Kansas.\n\nMr. Redpath, of Missouri, followed, and in a short speech denied the assumption that the mass of the people of Missouri were parties to the outrages in Kansas.\n\nMr. Bailey, of Kentucky, was called for, but declined making a speech, when Mr. Sinclair, of Michigan, took the stand and made a few remarks.\n\n13\n\nHe was succeeded by the Rev. Mr. Chandler who said he believed with Mr. Greeley, that Sharp's rifles were very great peacemakers, and that there was not much danger of introducing too many into Kansas. Although I am cowardly as to my person, yet, if pent up in Kansas, I believe I would feel inclined to be shot rather than to swear to support their laws. I never saw so much insult in any document, as in the proclamation of President Pierce. But the President did not write that document Caleb Cushing wrote it, for no other man in the nation could embody so many lies in the same space. Should a drop of blood be spilled in the pursuance of that proclamation, the Administration would be politically buried beyond the power of resuscitaion. The people of Kansas needed aid, and needed it now, or never. He had fearful foreboding's as to the future conditions of the citizens of Kansas. He (Chandler) had seen over half a century of years, but he was ready, should it come to the worst, to doff his black cloak, don a laced one, and battle in their behalf.\n\nMr. Newson, of Minnesota, followed. He said Minnesota had earnestly been waiting to see if an outbreak would occur in Kansas. If it did, Minnesota would do good work in the cause of Freedom. He (the speaker) was ready to volunteer to fight against the oppressors of Freedom in Kansas.\n\nMr. Ashley, of Virginia, next made a short, speech, in which he stated he was in favor of the plan published in The National Era for the settlement of Kansas.\n\nAdjourned.\n\n14\n\nTHE CALL FOR THE NOMINATING CONVENTION.\n\nThe Convention appointed an Executive Committee to call a convention for the nominating of candidates to be supported for the offices of President and Vice-President of the United States.\n\nThe Committee met in Washington on March 27, 1856, for that purpose; and so important was the wording of that call regarded, so as to offend no one and draw in from the ranks of all parties, that two days were spent in session at Willard's Hotel in preparing the call for the nominating convention. The call was as follows:\n\nTo the People of the United States:\n\nThe People of the United States, with out regard to past political differences or divisions, who are opposed to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, to the policy of the present Administration, to the extension of Slavery into the Territories, in favor of the admission of Kansas as a free State, and of restoring the action of the Federal Government to the principles of Washington and Jefferson, are invited by the National Committee, appointed by the Pittsburg Convention of the 22d February, 1856, to send from each State three delegates from every Congressional District, and six delegates at large, to meet in PHILADELPHIA, on the seventeenth day of June next, for the purpose of recommending candidates to be supported for the offices of President and Vice-President of the United States\n\nE.

Edwin D. Morgan, of New York, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and addressed by him as follows:\n\nDelegates of the Convention, Representatives of the Heart and the Hope of the Nation: The day and the hour appointed for this gathering have arrived; and in behalf of my associates of the National Committee, I now call this vast assemblage to order, in doing which I may be indulged for a moment. You are assembled for patriotic purposes. High expectations are cherished by the people. You are here to-day to give direction to a movement which is to decide whether the people of the United States are to toe hereafter and forever chained to the present, national policy of the extension of human slavery. Not whether the South is to rule, or the North to do the same thing; but whether the broad, national policy our fathers established, cherished and forever maintained, is to be permitted to descend to her sons, to be the watchword, the text and the guiding star of all her people. Such is the magnitude of the question submitted. In its consideration, let us avoid all extremes--plant ourselves firmly on the Platform of the Constitution and the Union, taking no position which does not commend itself to the judgment of our conciences, our country, and of mankind. Of the wisdom of such a policy, there need be no doubt; against which there can be no successful resistance. I now propose to nominate for temporary chairman of this Convention, a distinguished citizen of the State of New York, whose name occupies a nigh position in the history of his country, known and honored throughout the United States. I nominate the Hon. Robert Emmet. [Tumultuous cheering.]\n\nThe question being taken on the nomination of the Hon. Robert. Emmet, of New York, for temporary President of the Convention was responded to by an unanimous \"aye;\" and Mr. Morgan assigned Moses H. Grinnell, of New York, and George Hoadley, Jr., of Ohio, to conduct the temporary President to the chair.\n\nMr. Emmet was conducted to the chair amid the most tumultuous applause, and addressed the Convention as follows:\n\nSPEECH OF JUDGE EMMET.\n\nGentlemen, Delegates to the Republican Convention; I feel deeply the honor which you have just conferred upon me, and I\n\n16\n\nreturn you my sincere thanks for it. Certainly it is owing to no merit of mine that I have been singled out for this compliment. Nothing beyond the zeal which I feel in the common cause that has brought us here together could possibly entitle me to it. [Cheers.] And in that respect I claim not to be behind any one of you. [Renewed cheers.] I can say that my antecedents have been all Democratic. [Cheers.] For fifty years I can consider that I have been allied to that party, until that party left the only platform upon which I could remain with it. [Loud cheers.] Fellow citizens, the formation of a new party in a republic like ours after an existence of eighty years, is a singular event in history, and one that, perhaps, will require explanation at the hands of the historian. It is one, however, that can only be justified by strong and irresistible causes; and the question here is, whether we, in organizing this new Republican party in this country, at this late day, are justified by the causes which have induced us to form that organization. In the early days of this republic, when our government was founded, perhaps things were as favorable as now for the accomplishment of such an object, and even more so than ever existed in any part of the world, in any stage of its history. But there was one unfortunate element that created a difficulty, and that has been the cause and the source of our trouble from that time down to the present. It was early seen by the great men of that day, that it was necessary to make some provision to prevent that cause of trouble to which I have alluded, and which I will now name out, viz.: Southern slavery [cheers] from becoming a cause of still greater evils to the country. Without exception, all the greatmen of that day foresaw and predicted that slavery, although it could not be summarily and suddenly abolished, would die out in this country. All acknowledged that it was an evil. All acknowledged that it was the policy of the country gradually to get rid of it. That was the policy of that day. That policy led to the adoption of what was called the Missouri Compromise. Fellow citizens, I feel that it is out of place in me or in any delegate occupying the situation of temporary chairman here, to enter largely into these matters, because we are now in a process of transition to a state of organization, and it is not perhaps properly in place for me to go into a full statement of all the matters which are to be the subject of discussion here, and therefore I shall endeavor to be as brief as possible, and I beg your forbearance if I make any mistake in that respect, and that you will pass over any errors which I may commit in going beyond the line which properly ought to be prescribed to me in my present position. [Cheers.] I say that the Missouri Compromise was adopted in 1820 as the only measure that could give peace to this country. Slavery was here. It existed in the Southern States. It was not the wish either of the South or the North at that time that it should come into the free States, that it should come further than where it was. Now, I grant that if possibly all were slaveholding--if there was no such element of discord--if there was no antagonism between slavery and freedom in this country, it might be a paradise--it might be a paradise with all slaveholding States, though not such a paradise as I would like to live in [cheers]; but, in its way, the elements of discord would not exist there. That, however, was not possible. Freedom, fortunately, had the larger share here, and Freedom would never permit Slavery to absorb her up, and to engross the whole of this fair territory. [Cheers.] What was to be done, then?\n\n17\n\nWe could not make all the Southern States free at once. We had then to draw a line; and let it be understood that it was by that line--the Missouri Compromise--slavery was to be limited, and that it should never extend north of it. Well, gentlemen delegates, that compromise was respected, honored, lauded, upheld by all the people of this country until, unfortunately, a demagogue found his way into her councils, [loud applause,] who undertook to break down that solid compact, entered into between the States of this Union, for purposes intended to prevent the very consequences which have followed from its repeal. Why, gentlemen, the incursion into Kansas was the logical result, and effect of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. What else could have been expected? [Cheers.] All the horrors that have aroused this country, as they have existed in Kansas since the irruption of the Missouri borderers there, may be traced directly and logically to that act. We are now met, then, for the purpose of resisting, and, if possible, of subduing the power and influence of the administration and the party to whom we are indebted for all those evils. [Loud cheers.] They have met at Cincinnati; they have been beforehand with us. The great Democratic party of this country --a name which, independent of the late acts of the party, I have always honored and have always looked up to till I ceased to belong to it--that great party calling itself the Democratic Party, has met and adopted their platform. And a worse platform for a Democratic platform I never read. [Loud cheers and laughter.] They repeat the cant about squatter sovereignty. Squatter sovereignty! what is it? Is it the popular will? If it is, it is a political syllogism. It is the popular will that must govern everything in this country. But the popular will might be exercised by the people when they are in a state of organization to do it. That is the meaning of the \"exercise of the popular will.\" But squatter sovereignty, as applied to a Territory, is a fallacy, a delusion, and a snare. It was the extension of the great principle of \"popular will\" through this quaint idea of squatter sovereignty for the purpose of making it applicable to the condition of the Territory, and for the purpose of enabling, through that delusion, the quasi-squatters from Missouri, who came in there with their bowie-knives and revolvers, to control the elections, to say, \"We are for the time being the sovereigns, and will not only control the elections, but we will make laws, bloody in their character, like the laws of Draco, to rule this Territory for ever. [Loud cheering.) Well, they adopted that platform, and they nominated as their candidate, James Buchanan. Now, gentlemen, I have known. Hon. James Buchanan for forty years and upwards, intimately; and I say here, that some of the dearest and most cherished recollections of my life are connected with my associations with him. I would defend his personal character if assailed. But his political character--if I were not in deadly hostility to that, I would not be here. [Loud cheers.] I do not complain of Mr. Buchanan because he has been a politician by profession from the time he became a man. There is nothing dishonorable in a man's being a politician by profession--I do not say \"by trade.\" [Laughter and applause.] And although he is already in the field, I do not blame him for having been a Federalist once. [Renewed cheering.] And for having said in the enthusiasm of the moment (he was a young man at the time), that if he thought\n\n18\n\nhe had one drop of Democratic blood in his veins, he would let it out. [Laughter and cheers.] That would do exceedingly for a Fourth of July oration to an audience assembled like that, and at that time. But I do blame him in that, after he had expressed his opinion in regard to the Missouri Compromise, after he had bowed in adhesion to it, as every patriot of the day did, yet when he found certain men of his party breaking down that fabric of liberty, he had not strength enough to resist. I blame the Hon. James Buchanan for having shown a want of firmness, a want of self-reliance, a want of adhesion to principle, and an over-zealous devotion to party in several acts of his life. And I take his very last act: his adhesion to this spurious platform of Democracy at Cincinnati. I ask no more than the very words in which he has sent in that adhesion, or in which he has expressed it, in his answer to the committee who waited upon him at Wheat land. He acknowledges that he is no longer James Buchanan, a free agent, with the right of expressing whatever will or opinion he may have of his own; but that he is bound to that platform, and to every plank of it, and that he has no right or power to remove or alter one plank of it--an admission that he has allowed himself to be chained to the Juggernaut of Slavery, and that he allows himself to be dragged headlong by it. [Loud cheers.] I make all allowance, fellow citizens, for the impossibility of a man in this country, who is a politician, who is a party man, of his having his own will, and carrying- it out in all respects. It is, I allow, impossible. The very theory of our popular Government, by party, is the concession of the minority to the majority. Every man must concede something. No man can have everything in the arrangement of public affairs precisely as he would wish. But I do not understand how a man should, after the lapse of two or three years, make such a complete summer-set as my friend James Buchanan did on the subject of the Missouri Compromise, and tumble himself headforemost into the Cincinnati platform with as little scruple as he did. [Cheers.] Fellow citizens, lam afraid I am tiring you with this discursive ramble. [Loud cheers, and cries of \"Go on! go on!\"] I came here because my duty required me to come. My conscience told me that if I was able to get to Philadelphia I was bound to be here. [Cheers.] I appreciated the honor that was conferred upon me in being nominated a delegate, and I do now say, we being all assembled here, that no man in any country can boast at this moment of a higher position, or one more dignified, than that of a delegate holding a seat in this Convention. [Loud cheers.] We are here for noble and high and holy purposes. They may laugh at us. They may call us Black Republicans and Negro-Worshippers. Why, if they were not traitors and buffoons, they would find something better than that to apply to us. [Cheers and shouts of \"That's it!\"] They may say that we mean to concentrate and gather under our wings all the odds and ends of parties--all theisms of the day Belt so. Let them come to us with all their isms. We will merge them all in that great ism, patriotism. [Rapturous and prolonged cheering.] How can it be otherwise than that the Republican Party, represented here as it is, should combine in itself elements from the other parties that have existed in this country\"? How can it be otherwise? I ask. We find a large number of Democrats here who have woke up, like myself, on the subject. [Cheers] In 1848 I was simple enough to believe that some of the Democratic\n\n19\n\nParty in the State of New York--some of the shining lights-- some of the leading powers of the party, were going to lead us on to that point of perfection in politics that we always hope to attain-- that they formed a party that we could follow conscientiously. Well, we had a platform at Buffalo. I gave in my adhesion to it, and I confess I have seen no reason to change the grounds on which I gave that adhesion, from that day to this. [Cheers] I was content to be called a Free-Soiler then. I am content to be called a Free-Soiler now. [Cheers.] Nay, more, fellow citizens, I am proud of it. [Renewed cheers.] And if there was not another single man in the community, over all the broad expanse of the country, who would avow himself a Free-Soiler, I would do it, and will do it to the day of my death. [Tremendous cheering.] I despise nicknames in politics. You call a man an Abolitionist. For what? Because he thinks that slavery should be abolished? No, certainly not, for he will say he himself thinks it ought to be abolished. What, then, do you mean by an abolitionist? Oh, a political abolitionist? [Cheers and laughter.] And that is the way a nick-name is conferred. Now, I say this boldly, and I have no doubt that the hearts of my hearers at this moment respond to it; there is not a man--an honest man, who understands his own rights, and the rights of others--who respects the immortal Declaration of Independence--who does not hope to see the day --not a hope perhaps which can be realized within the time allotted to any of us--but hopes to see the day, when such a thing as human bondage shall not exist in the world. [Vehement and long-continued cheering.] That is an honest abolitionist. [Renewed cheers.] That is the abolitionism which I avow, and which I am not ashamed to avow [Loud cheers.] I trust that day will come. I am not for convulsing our country with efforts to force it--to forestall it. Let God in his good providence bring it when it is right and proper that it should come. In the meantime, are we to suffer from the existence of this evil? Are we to be paralyzed in our Free States here by those Slaveholders wielding all the power in the country, filling up every office, sending in their man invariably for President, making their men our Judges, sending their nominees away as our foreign Ministers, and, when we remonstrate, telling us, \"Yes, doughfaces, we are doing that; we will do that; we intend, if you rebel, to subdue you--to crush you out!\" [Cheers.] Men of the East, to you this taunt has been particularly directed ; to you has this threat been made. I ask you--you who represent the blood that was shed at Lexington, at Dorchester Heights, and at Concord--are you prepared to submit to such a taunt as that? [Loud shouts of \"No! no!\"] To such an insult? [Reiterated shouts of \"No! no!\"[ To such a slur upon your political energy? [Continued cries of \" No!\"] No, I am sure you are not. But, fellow citizens, let us not get excited upon this point. [Laughter.] We come to treat Slavery not as a moral question. And let me be understood as emphatically suggesting the propriety of keeping up that distinction. Slavery is, so far as our functions are concerned with it, a political evil; and we do not come here to discuss whether, according to the great abstract principles of right and wrong-, the laws of God and the behests of the Bible, Slavery be right or wrong. Whether it be moral or immoral, it exists here among us, and we must manage it as well as we can. We must repress it. We must prevent it from being-, as its nature always urges it to be, aggressive. [Loud\n\n20\n\ncheers.] We must keep it back. If we cannot restore the Missouri Compromise line by an act as solemn, and a great deal more honest as an act of legislation than the act by which it was repealed, we must find some way to do it. At this moment, the fires of civil discord are racing in Kansas. At this moment, that doomed portion of our Territory is suffering all the consequences from that act. Would to God that we had the power of enabling-them by a more summary process than the election of a President to get rid of their present evils! [Loud cheers.] And I am not without hope, fellow citizens, that that process is going on even now, [cheers,] and that we will get cheering news from Kansas yet. In the meantime, let us proceed, great party as we are, constitutionally. Let us proceed to nominate a man as our candidate for the office of President, and in doing that let us observe what I have already alluded to. Each man cannot have his favorite. We come here to make concessions. We come here to act in harmony. We come here to act unanimously in the cause, as I hope and trust we will. [Cheers.] And although it is natural and it is proper that there should be preference for particular men, preference for a man is not the true principle upon which we should act in this Convention.\n\nA voice--\"That's it,\" and cheers.\n\nWe all agree in principle. Our object is victory, and it is a legitimate object. It is one which will redound with benefit to the country; at least we think so. If we succeed in defeating the nomination of the Democratic party and electing our President, it would take infinitely more words than I could bestow on it, and more than you, perhaps, would be willing to spend in listening to it, to enumerate all the blessing's that would flow from it. All agreeing in principle, then, and all having- one high, noble, patriotic purpose in view, I invoke and call upon the members of this Convention not to let their personal predilections for one candidate more than another interfere with an exercise of the general will of the Convention, founded upon the best information we have, founded upon the best lights that can shine upon us at present in regard to the availability of the man who is to lead us to victory. [Cheers.] Let us, then, fellow citizens, proceed to the good work; and I trust that the result will be that we will strangle this hydra of the Union which is now menacing our liberty and our peace; that we will extirpate this canker that is eating our very vitals, and extinguish the smouldering fire of treason and disunion that is under our feet at this moment, and which may burst forth in an instant, and swallow up all the fair liberties which have been our boast and pride since the establishment of this Republic. [Cheers.] We are met here to avert and to prevent those consequences. We have a high duty to perform, and I am sure that at the close of this Convention the people will say with one acclaim, \"Well done, good and faithful servants.\" [Voiceferous and prolonged cheering.]\n\nWhen the applause which, followed the conclusion of Mr. Emmet's address had subsided--\n\nOn motion--\n\nMr. George G. Fogg, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Thomas G. Mitchell, of Ohio, were appointed temporary secretaries of the Convention.\n\n21\n\nThe Rev. Albert Branes, of Philadelphia, by request, invoked the Divine blessing upon the assemblage and its proceedings.\n\nMr. A. P. Stone, of Ohio, offered the following resolution:\n\nResolved: That a committee, consisting of one delegate from each State and Territory represented in this Convention, be selected by the delegates thereof, who shall act as Committee on Credentials, Rules and Appointment, and. report the number, names and post office address of each delegate, together with rules for the government of the Convention.\n\nThe question being taken on the resolution, the same was unanimously adopted; and on calling the roll of the States and Territories, the following gentlemen were announced by the Chairmen of the several State delegations, as members from the States respectively.\n\nTHE COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS, ETC.\n\nMaine, Mark H. Dunnell; New Hampshire, William M. Weed; Vermont, David E. Nicholson; Massachusetts, Simon Brown; Rhode Island, Edward Harris; Connecticut, Charles L. English; New York, Elbridge G. Spaulding; New Jersey, Dudley S. Gregory; Pennsylvania, S, Steele Blair; Delaware, Lewis Thompson; Maryland, Elias Hawley; Kentucky, James R. Whittemore; Ohio, L. B. Grunckel; Indiana, Charles H.

Phillips; District of Columbia, B. B. French.\n\nHon. Daniel Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, offered the following-resolutions:\n\nResolved: That a committee of one from each State and Territory represented be appointed to prepare and report for the action of the Convention a platform of principles to be submitted to the people of the United States; that the member from each State be named by the delegates thereof; and that all resolutions or papers offered in Convention in relation to such platform be referred to the committee thus appointed, without debate.\n\nResolved: That the said committee be requested to report at the earliest practicable moment, and that no ballot be taken for President or Vice-President until after the Platform is reported and adopted by the Convention.\n\nMr. John Bigelow, of New York, suggested that action upon these resolutions ought properly to be deferred until after the report of the Committee on Credentials had been brought in and acted, upon.\n\nMr. J. M. Ashley, of Ohio, said that the seats of none of the members appearing as delegates to this Convention were contested. The Convention was harmonious. He urged immediate action upon the resolutions.\n\nA motion to amend the first resolution, so as to provide for two members of the committee from each state, instead of one, was put and lost.\n\n22\n\nMr. B. B. French, of the District of Columbia, offered an amendment to the first resolution, to the effect, that the same should provide for one member of the committee \"from each State and Territory represented, instead of from each State,\" which amendment was accepted by the mover of the resolutions; and the question being taken on the resolutions, as amended and above recited, the same were unanimously adopted.\n\nOn calling the roll of the States and Territories, the following gentlemen were announced as selected to constitute\n\nTHE COMMITTEE ON PLATFORM:\n\nMaine, Henry Carter; New Hampshire, Daniel Clark; Massachusetts, E. Rockwood Hoar; Connecticut, Thaddeus Welles; Rhode Island, Thomas Davis; Vermont, Edward Kirkland; New York, Preston King [great applause); New Jersey, Edward W. Whelply; Delaware, Edward G. Bradford; Maryland, Francis P. Blair; Pennsylvania, David Wilmot [applause]; Ohio, Joshua R. Giddings [loud applause]; Michigan, Isaac P. Christiancy; Wisconsin, John F. Potter; Indiana, John D. Defrees; Illinois, George T. Brown; Iowa, James B. Howell; California, John A. Wills; Kansas, J. M. Winchell; District of Columbia, Jacob Bigelow; Kentucky, George D. Blakely; Minnesota, Alexander Ramsey.\n\nMr. F. D. Kimball, of Ohio, offered the following- resolution:\n\nResolved:That a committee of one from each State and Territory represented be selected by the several delegations to report officers to this Convention for its permanent organization.\n\nThe resolution was unanimously adopted, and, on calling the roll, the following named gentlemen were announced as selected to compose the\n\nCOMMITTEE ON PERMANENT ORGANIZATION.\n\nMaine, George M. Weston; New Hampshire, Levi Chamberlin; Massachusetts, George R. Russell; Connecticut, Charles Adams; Rhode Island, William Hoppin; Vermont, Ryland Fletcher; New York, George W. Patterson; New Jersey, William D. Waterman; Delaware, Thomas Walters; Maryland, Elias Hawley; Pennsylvania, Samuel A. Purviance; Ohio, George Hoadley, Jr.; Michigan, Thomas J. Drake; Wisconsin, M. M. Davis; Indiana, D. G. Rose; Illinois, Cyrus Aldrich ; Iowa, R. L. B. dark; Kansas, Charles H. Branscomb, Kentucky, John Rimell; California, George W. Read; District of Columbia, Lewis Clephane; Minnesota, John B. Phillips.\n\nMr. John G. Bergen, of New York, offered the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:\n\nResolved: That the daily meetings of this Convention be opened with prayer, and that the officers of the Convention make the necessary arrangements to that effect by invitations to the clergymen of the city.\n\nDr. George Harris, of Maryland, offered the following resolution:\n\nResolved: That a committee of one from each State and Territory represented in this Convention be appointed by the several delegations respectively to report the name of one person from\n\n23\n\neach State and Territory to constitute the Republican National Committee for the ensuing- four years--such committee, when appointed, to elect their own chairman.\n\nOn taking the question, this resolution was adopted.\n\nOn motion, the selection of the committee provided for by the resolution was deferred until to-morrow morning.\n\nGeneral John J. Viele, of New York, offered the following resolution;\n\nResolved: That the gentlemen in attendance upon this Convention, representing the radical Free-Soil Democracy of New York, be invited to take seats as honorary members of this Convention.\n\nGen. Viele said that there was a delegation here from the Council of One Hundred of radical Democrats of New York, who had seceded from the Democratic party in that State. They were the friends of Silas Wright. [Cheers.] They are the men who can trace their Democratic pedigree to Tompkins and Clinton; but notwithstanding that, they cannot and will not consent to be harnessed to the car, nor be dragged behind the Juggernaut of slavery. [Great applause.] I move sir, that in compliment to that body of men, who, in 1848, rolled up a Free-Soil vote of 121,000, these representatives be invited to take seats here as honorary members. [Applause.] Hon. John Allison, of Pennsylvania, said there was present in the city a large number of delegates to the Pennsylvania Republican State Convention, who were awaiting the action of the Convention, and he hoped they would be admitted to seats in the hall.\n\nThe New Hampshire and other delegations declared their willingness to give up their seats, or hold those who wished to be admitted in their laps, rather than that they should be excluded.\n\nJudge Hulbert, of New York, said that inasmuch as a motion had been made to admit the delegation from the Council of One Hundred from New York--a delegation from those who were the friends of Silas Wright--a man in whose tombstone there would be more force a century hence than there was in the myrmidons at Washington--friends of a man who had declared that, with his consent, the army of the United States should never be used to put slavery into Territories where it did not already exist--he hoped it would be passed; and that all others who had declared in favor of the principles of the party represented by the Convention would be admitted if possible. [Applause.]\n\nThe Maine delegation here declared that notwithstanding they had travelled a long way to attend the Convention, they would give up their places rather than that the delegation from the \"Council of One Hundred\" should not have a place in the hall.\n\nOn taking the question upon the resolution of Gen. Viele, the same was triumphantly adopted.\n\n24\n\nOn motion, the Convention took a recess until four o'clock this afternoon, the various committees append at this session in the meantime to proceed with the discharge of their duties.\n\nAFTERNOON SESSION.\n\nTUESDAY, 18th June, 1856.\n\nThe Convention reassembled, pursuant to adjournment, at four o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nHon. Robert Emmet in the chair.\n\nReports of Committees having been called for, the Committee to recommend officers for the permanent organization of the Convention, by George Hoadley, Esq., their Secretary, presented the following report:\n\nThe Committee on Permanent Organization report the following list of officers for the Convention:\n\nPresident, Col. Henry S.Lane, of Indiana.\n\nVice-Presidents--Maine, Anson P. Morrill; New Hampshire, Amos Tuck; Vermont, Heman Carpenter; Massachusetts, Charles Francis Adams; Rhode Island, Jacob D. Babcock; Connecticut, Chauncey F. Cleveland; New York, John A. King; New Jersey, Joseph C. Hornblower; Pennsylvania, Joseph Ritner; Delaware, Samuel Barr; Maryland, Francis S. Corkran; Kentucky, George D. Blakey; Ohio, Noah. H. Swayne, Rufus P. Spaulding; Indiana, John Beard; Illinois, William B. Archer; Michigan, Kinsley S. Bingham; Wisconsin, Walter D. McIndoe; Iowa, Francis Spinger; California, Francis B. Folger; Kansas, Samuel C. Pomeroy; Minnesota, Alex. Ramsey; District of Columbia, Jacob Bigelow.\n\nSecretaries-- District of Columbia, Benjamin B. French; Maine, James G. Blame; New Hampshire, Daniel Blaisdell; Vermont, Levi Underwood; Massachusetts, Charles R. Train; Rhode Island, Henry Howard; Connecticut, Edgar S. Tweedy; New York, Isaac Dayton; New Jersey, Henry Race; Pennsylvania, Robert P. McKnight. A. S. Raymond; Delaware, Benj. T. Bye; Maryland, Jacob Fussel; Kentucky, William S. Bailey; Ohio, A. Sankey Latty; Indiana, W. G. Terrell; Illinois, George Schneider; Wisconsin, C. C. Kuntz; Iowa, Wm. P. Brazelton; California, George M. Hanson; Kansas, R. G.Elliott; Minnesota, J. B. Phillips.\n\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\n\nSAMUEL A. PURVIANCE, Chairman.\n\nGEORGE HOADLEY, JR., Secretary.\n\nOn motion of Mr. Daniel H. Tompkins, of New York, the report of the committee just read was accepted, and the gentlemen named by the committee were unanimously chosen the permanent officers of the Convention.\n\nOn motion, the Hon. George W. Patterson, of New York, L. J. Churchfield, Esq., of Ohio, and the Hon. Samuel A. Purviance, of Pennsylvania, were appointed a committee to conduct the Hon. Henry S. Lane, of Indiana, President of the Convention elect, to the chair.\n\n25\n\nAmid vociferous cheers for the Hoosier State, Mr. Lane was conducted to the chair of the Convention, and, when silence had been restored, addressed the Convention, in substance, as follows:\n\nSPEECH OF PRESIDENT LANE.\n\nFriends of Freedom and Freemen--The honor they conferred upon him transcended the ambition of the most deserving man in the Convention, and, from his inmost soul, he thanked them for the honor they had done to the gallant little State to which he belonged. The occasion was one of vast importance, and the time was propitious; it was the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill. [Applause.] They had gathered in sight of Independence Hall, with all its glorious revolutionary recollections. They were almost beneath the shade of those noble trees, under whose young, boughs their fathers gathered to institute a new, a liberal, a free Government. [Applause.] They were assembled during one of the most important crises that had ensued since the days of the revolution. That day inaugurated a new era in American politics. It inaugurated a new era--the resurrection of the North. [Great applause.) Being a stranger in the city, he had experienced some difficulty in finding the place of meeting; but, while looking about, he discovered the flag of the Union floating from the housetop, and, knowing- that the only National Party in the country would be likely to gather beneath its ample folds, he had come to it, and found his friends. [Applause.] But a word as to the objects for the attainment of which they had come together. They had gathered from a sense of a common danger. [Applause.] That was what had brought them together; and, consequently, they were there, forgetting their former party ties, for the common good of all, and because of their sacred love of liberty. [Applause.] He had, in all probability, as much difficulty in breaking from his old party associations. He had been an humble, but earnest and admiring follower of the gallant and glorious Henry Clay, of Kentucky. [Applause.] But from the time that he heard the Nebraska-Kansas swindle had been consummated, he had left the gallant Clay in his tomb, to follow principles which require the active support of all true men. [Applause.] Ah!, when that act was perpetrated, how evident was it that Henry Clay was in his tomb! The name of Kentucky was not heard in clarion tones against the wrong.\n\nA voice--\"She will be heard yet.\" [Applause.]\n\nThe speaker continued: Yes, he believed she would soon be heard. But a word as to the business of the Convention. First and most important before them was the vital principle of the Republican party--the principle which they had met to sustain-- no more slave States, and the admission of Kansas as a free State. [Applause.] For that they were told that they were doing more than they had a right to do--that such a movement was momentous. What, he would ask, what foundation had our fathers-- what guide had they when they gathered in Independence Mali and declared for freedom? Why, rights which belong to man, rights that were born with man. [Great applause.] When the great compromise was completed, it was said that all agitation on the subject of slavery would cease. And so it was, until a set of heartless, brainless demagogues-- Douglas and the rest--disturbed it. [Applause.] And he called God to witness that he designed, and he hoped that all designed to meet the issue like a\n\n26\n\nman. Such scenes had been enacted in Kansas as demanded from every freeman all his efforts against those who would perpetuate the principles of those who had disturbed that great compromise. Scenes had been enacted there which would have disgraced the revolutionary times of France, which would have disgraced the worst days of the middle ages. These thing's had been done in the middle of the nineteenth century, and done through the connivance of the present weak and wicked administration. The press--a free press--had been destroyed, and ruffians from the border of Missouri had gone over and given freemen bad laws, written in the blood of the freemen who were settlers there. Take a case from his own State. A young- man had gone from there to Kansas with his wife and children. He had been stricken down because he had declared for freedom. His children were now friendless, for his wife was wandering about a maniac; and we were told that when we endeavored to prevent these things we were revolutionary- If we were, it was a revolutionary feeling sanctioned by God, and which all good men must follow. In that territory the ballot boxes had been destroyed, and officers and laws had been forced upon freemen. And what of the laws? Why, they declared that if you spoke or published anything that encouraged freedom you would be imprisoned in the penitentiary. If you took a copy of the Constitution or of the Bible and read it there, you would be imprisoned, for both were anti-slavery documents. [Applause.] They had all heard that the Missouri Compromise was intended to pour oil on the troubles of the nation, with reference to the subject of slavery. The Democratic party had declared they would not touch it. But what have they done? And again, what had they done at Cincinnati? Why, with an effrontery that bordered on sublimity, they had again declared that they would not touch it. [Great applause.] Their declarations were like Dead Sea fruit--pleasant to the eye, but that turned to ashes on the lips. Now, he would say a word concerning James Buchanan. He had nothing to say against him personally, but he had much to say against his multitude of antecedents. When a young' man, Mr. Buchanan was a federalist, and when the last flag of federalism floated at Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, Mr. Buchanan's was the last hand that held it there. His conversion was sudden, but the light that shone upon him was light from heaven. It was a peculiar light, received during the administration of the hero of New Orleans. [Applause.] They were told, by way of rebuke, that Henry Clay, had he been alive, would have favored the Kansas-Nebraska Act. A slander more foul than that had never been perpetrated against him when alive. Had Henry Clay been alive, he would have been with the Republican party there that day. [Applause.] His first speech made in Kentucky was in favor of a gradual emancipation of the slaves. [Applause.] And when the Greeks were struggling for freedom, his voice was the first to encourage them an call for aid. All his words and all his acts were for freedom. [Applause.] Then they were told that the great Daniel Webster would have favored it had he been living. It was not for them to call up the spirit of the great departed, and therefore he would only say to those who uttered such sentiments: let them beware how they slandered the dead. [Great applause.] They had met there to decide who should be elected the standard-bearer, and whenever he should be named let them follow the banner, and be sure it would lead to victory. [Applause.]\n\n27\n\nThey could follow it, for in doing so they would be following the banner of the nation. There was no disunion in the ranks of the Republican party. It was united. The disunion cry came from the South. It was uttered only by demagogues and believed by fools. [Applause.] It was uttered by South Carolina --by the unhung nullifiers there who still have the halter of Gen. Jackson about their necks. [Great applause.] They called the men of the North abolitionists. If to sympathize with the freemen of Kansas, and to oppose the acts of the men from Missouri who had invaded that territory was abolitionism, they might write \"Abolitionist\" all over him, and more, when he had died, they might write \"Abolitionist\" on his tombstone. To say that to refuse adhesion to the Fugitive Slave bill was treason, was to say what he did not believe. If it was, they might get their marshals ready, for he intended, to declare it upon every stump during the campaign. [Applause.] On a beautiful evening, in Philadelphia, the watch cried, \"A beautiful night, and all is well--and Lord Cornwallis is taken!\" [Applause.] And if they were true to their duty, in November next, the watchman in Philadelphia would cry again, \"It is a beautiful night, and all is well--and James Buchanan is taken!\" [Great applause.] But to have that occur, they must work--work unitedly and earnestly. Do that, a triumph was sure.\n\nThe Vice-Presidents and Secretaries then took their places upon the stand, and entered upon the discharge of their duties.\n\nThe Hon Elbridge E. Spaulding, from the Committee on Credentials and on Rules for the Government of the Convention, presented the following report in part:\n\nThe Committee on Credentials report the following resolution in respect to the contested seats from Pennsylvania, viz.:\n\nResolved: That B. D. Patengill, Charles D. Cleveland, John F. Gilpin, of the first district; William S. Pierce, William Elder; Henry C. Cary, of the second district; Joseph J. Gillingham; Thomas E. Cavender, and Mahlon Dickinson, of the third district) and George H. Earl, William B. Thomas, and Passmore Williamson, of the fourth district, are entitled to seats in this Convention, as delegates from their respective districts.\n\nThe committee further report the following- resolutions for the government of the proceedings of the Convention:\n\nResolved: That in voting for a candidate for President, the States be called in their order, and that the chairman of each delegation present the number of votes given to each candidate for President by the delegates from his State, each State being limited in its votes to three times the number of electors to which such State is entitled: Provided, that no State shall give a larger vote than the number of delegates actually present in the Convention;\n\nAnd Provided: That Kansas shall be considered for this purpose as a State, with the same electoral votes as any other State entitled to only one representative in Congress.\n\nResolved: That the same rule shall apply to the nomination of Vice-President.\n\nResolved: That the rules of the House of Representatives be adopted, so far as they are applicable to this Convention.\n\nAll which is respectfully submitted in part.\n\nPhiladelphia, 17th June, 1856.\n\nELBRIDGE G. SPAULDING, Chairman.\n\n28\n\nOn motion of Mr. Denning Duer, of New Jersey, the report of the committee was accepted, and the resolutions were adopted; and the gentlemen reported as entitled to seats in the Convention, from the State of Pennsylvania, were admitted to seats accordingly.\n\nAn inquiry having been made as to whether anything was said in the report about a two-thirds rule, the President said the subject was not attended to, but he supposed Republicans were willing to abide the will of the majority.\n\nOn motion of the Hon. George W. Patterson, it was--\n\nResolved: That the Committee on Credentials be requested to report, together with the names of the members of this Convention, the post office address of each member and that the chairman of each State delegation be requested to furnish the same to the committee.\n\nOn motion, the Hon. Caleb Smith, of Indiana, was invited to address the Convention.\n\nMr. Smith was cordially welcomed by the Convention, and spoke, in substance, as follows:\n\nSPEECH OF HON. CALEB SMITH.\n\nMr. Smith ascended the platform amid loud applause, and said, that although he felt very much honored by this most unexpected call, yet he would confess he felt himself much embarrassed in a Convention like this, where were so many gentlemen more distinguished than himself; but he could not, in justice to the gallant State to which he belonged, refuse to respond to this call to occupy their attention for a few moments. They had met here to-day, he continued, for a very important object, and the action of this body was calculated, in his judgment, to exercise a great influence on the future government of this country. This Convention represented a party of a character which no political party had ever before assumed. We were called upon to vote to consider questions not of mere expediency, but questions on the decision, of which depends the perpetuity of this government and confederation. This party was obviously brought together for no ordinary purpose. A nation's welfare and continued existence depended upon its patriotism. The man must indeed be insensible who could not now see the dark cloud which overhangs the horizon of our country. He would be the last of those to favor a party based on sectional issues, and the calumnies that were heaped on this Republicon party, as a sectional party, he repelled with contemptuous denial. There never was a party since the days of Washington so national in its aim as this, for its object was to preserve and extend freedom, and was not freedom national? [Cheers.| The South had lately promulgated the view that slavery was national and freedom sectional. It was for the Republican party to assert and maintain the nationality of freedom and extend liberty wherever the flag of our country waves. [Cheers.] The Republican party had no desire to interfere with slavery in States where slavery already exists. If the slaveholders wish to hug their chains in darkness, let them, but they were not to be allowed to extend slavery into new territory bought by the common\n\n29\n\nblood and the common treasure of both sections. [Cheers.] If they looked back ten years, it would be found that there was not then a man north of Mason and Dixon's line who did not recognize and favor Republican principles, and assert the power of the general, government over slavery in the Territories. But men had changed, and times had changed. The nominee of the Democratic party was now expected to embody Mr. Calhoun's extremest views. Slavery had ever been aggressive, and it had swallowed up every party in the South, or brought it into subservience. Where were now the great Southern Whigs of former times? Where was Toombs?\n\nA voice--\"In the Tombs.\" [Laughter.]\n\nToombs and all the leading Whigs of the South now acted with the Democratic party, because the leaders of that party in the North, in their pursuit of the spoils, overlooked everything-, and were ready and willing to humiliate themselves in the dust before the car of slavery, and to consent to be made the instruments of perpetuating and extending its rule. [Cheers.] But many of those who formerly associated and were identified with the Democracy had become disgusted with its cringing disregard of the principles of freedom, and enlisted themselves under the banner of Republicanism. Civil war was now raging in Kansas, and how long, he asked, would the North suffer the contumelies, the insults, the murderous atrocities that were now being- perpetrated in Kansas on Northern men, because of their devotion to freedom? The only party by which that state of things could be changed was the Republican party--a party not organized to advance the interests of any man or set of men, but to maintain the principles of freedom. [Cheers.] It was a (duty of the men of that party to unite in nominating a man who should embody and carry out their principles, and having nominated him to place him. in the van, and follow him unhesitatingly into the thickest of the fight, which must result in their victory. [Loud and continued applause.]\n\nAfter vehement calls for a great number of gentlemen, Mr. Lovejoy, of Illinois, took the platform amid loud applause.\n\nMR. LOVEJOY'S SPEECH.\n\nHe said: Nations, as well as individuals, have their destiny. There often appears on the stage of human action in this world individuals who seem to have been designed to fulfill a certain purpose. The same thing was true in regard to nations. Each had a mission which it was intended to perform. The question here was, what was the mission?--the special destiny, or as it has sometimes been called, the manifest destiny of the American nation? He had been gratified to hear it announced by the President of this Convention, that there was a Providence, a Divine Power ruling over all thing's, and a revelation from that Divine Being to man, and that there was a higher law than that created by demagogues. [Loud cheers.] The mission of Pilgrim Fathers was to exhibit the practicability of a \"Church without a Bishop, and a State without a King.\" And he cared not what may have been the creed of the man who drew up the Declaration of Independence--the truths it asserted were intended to realize that mission, and bore evidence of having been traced under the direct influence of a Divine inspiration. [Loud cheers.] And he thanked\n\n30\n\nGod that the principles of that declaration were yet warm in the great American heart. It declared that Government derived their power, not from invading Border Ruffians, but from the will of the governed. What, then, was the mission? The manifest destiny of this American people, who from a handful of pilgrims on Massachusetts' shore had multiplied to a nation of twenty-four millions of men? Was it their destiny to chase niggers? [Cheers and laughter.] Was it their destiny to go fillibustering over the continent, and having conquered new Territory to plant slavery in it? [Loud cheers.] God never designed this nation for such objects as that. What, then, was the mission of America? It was to maintain and illustrate the self-evident truths laid down in that Declaration of Independence. And the question now came to us, whether we would fulfill our destiny, by maintaining those immortal truths, which we cherish in our hearts. He was glad to hear the President declare that if to maintain those rights set forth in the Declaration of Independence were abolition, he wanted to have it traced all over him, and should be satisfied to have such an inscription as his epitaph. [Laughter.] He (the speaker) supposed he was an Abolitionist on the same principle, and this was an assertion which he was positive would do no harm, for when they were talking about putting that in a platform, he said he did not care whether they put it in the platform or not, because they would be sure to take the disease in the natural way, and it would be broken out all over them before the campaign ended. [Laughter and applause.] Now, what was the principle thus set up? It was simply the truth that all men had been created equal. It was a reaffirmation of that Divine truth which was announced ages ago, when the Creator said: \"Let us make man in our own image.\" As man was made in the likeness of God, every man had an aspiration after the eternal, and was conscious of there being a miniature God within himself; and that image must not be crushed, however degraded, for God was there. There was a germ of immortality there, which at some time, however remote, would emerge and shine as a star forever and ever. And it was this doctrine of the immortality of the soul that lay at the foundation of abolitionism. [Loud cheers.] It might be said that such a doctrine would carry us into the slaveholding States. True; but it did not follow that it demanded the exercise of any power save a moral one. He was standing here in Philadelphia, and might be allowed to quote the saying of Franklin, who asserted that he would go to the verge of the Constitution in favor of freedom.\" But he (the speaker) would not be satisfied with that--he would jump off the Constitution to promote the same object. If the old Shylock came here, whetting his knife on his shoe, he would be met by the declaration, that we would stand by the bond however hard it was, and that we would give him his pound of flesh, but not one drop of blood. [Cheers.] We were to look Slavery in the face, as our fathers looked the despotism of the British George in the face, and expel it the same way from off free Territories. [Cheers.] The slavery talk about sectionality, and all that, was the sublimity of impudence. The men who charged the Republicans with sectionalism were themselves going through the country crying \"Nigger! nigger!\" everywhere; and yet when the Republican party triumph, he wanted the South to be treated justly. Let her have her full share. But the North would stand for freedom, and freedom would be maintained. Heretofore this\n\n31\n\ncountry had been ruled by two hundred and fifty thousand slaveholders, and the North had been bowed down like an elephant to receive an ass' load, and staggered under their lash. Would they consent to that? [Vehement cries of \"No! no!\"] He felt more and felt better--[laughter]--for this mighty gathering, brought together by a common impulse of patriotism, and beating with the same pulses of liberty, than he had ever felt before. They were now preparing; for a stern, though bloodless conflict, and Slavery in this struggle must go over the precipice. They were afraid that they could not carry Pennsylvania. But they had no cause for such fear--for Pennsylvania would be sure to give them a majority, under any circumstances; and no matter whether it was the son of New York who was to be their choice--[loud cheers]--or the noble son of Ohio, or the gallant Fremont.--[loud cheers]--or that venerable statesman, clothed with the ermine that never knew a spot--he cared not who the standard bearer of the party was. They would unite to a man, and carry him triumphantly into the Presidential seat. [Loud and prolonged cheering and applause.)\n\nA motion was again made to adjourn, but a delegate rose and moved that Hon. Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts, be invited to address the Convention. The motion was enthusiastically adopted and the honorable gentleman designated ascended the platform amid a perfect storm of cheering and applause, again and again renewed.\n\nHON. HENRY WILSON'S SPEECH.\n\nHe said: Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention, I need not say that this kind greeting is to me a source of gratification. I have been more accustomed to look into the stern faces of foes than to meet the glances of friends. [Cheers.] Sir, this convocation of the freemen of the United States here to-day is a source of gratification to every lover of liberty on the North American Continent. [Cheers.] This is not the convention of a party--it is the assemblage of the freemen of the country of all political parties. [Loud cheers.] This, sir, is a convention coming here to place in nomination a ticket, around which, we trust, the lovers of human liberty all over the country will gather without reference to the divisions of the past. Sir, our object is to overthrow the Slave Power of the country, now organized in the Democratic party of the country, [Loud cheers.] The present administration now embodies in itself the organized slave interest of the Republic. Mr. Buchanan represents this day the Democracy of Franklin Pierce, for he had ceased to be James Buchanan, and must square himself to the platform of the party. [Great cheers.] The Democratic party, supporting this administration--an administration that has plunged this nation into a civil war--assembled in convention, adopted a platform dictated by the slave interest of the country, nominated James Buchanan, and he ceased to be a Pennsylvania freeman, and must square his conduct by the terms and conditions of that platform. [Cheers.] Now, sir, we wish to defeat James Buchanan, to overthrow that platform, to enthrone Liberty in the Government of this Republic. [Cheers.] Sir, the Republican party, young, vigorous, fresh organized for liberty, cannot do it alone and unaided.\n\nA voice--\"That is so.\"\n\n32\n\nThe old Whigs of the country can make no successful organization to defeat that. The American Party is powerless as an organization, alone, to overthrow that power. Independent Democrats, men who follow the great doctrines of Thomas Jefferson, who believe in pure, unadulterated progressive Democracy, that embraces in its affections the whole globe--this Democracy can make no successful effort alone for the overthrow of the Democratic party; but, sir, these men can unite and they can defeat that party, [loud cheers, and cries of \"They will do it!\"] and I call upon the members of the Republican party assembled here to-day to come here in the spirit of a lofty, self-sacrificing patriotism, and adopt a policy liberal and generous towards others, and lay the foundation for this union of all parties to save this Republic. [Loud cheers.] I call upon the Whigs--men who believe in the words of Daniel Webster--that we must seize the first, the last and every occasion to oppose the extension of the slave power. I call upon these Whig's to stand now by the doctrines of that great leader whom they followed so many years. [Cheers.] I call upon independent Democrats, on the men who have fought the battles of Democracy, but who have fought not the battles of slavery--who have stood by the Democratic party, but who can follow their black banner no longer--to come here and unite with us in this glorious effort. Come here and let us make a true Democratic party, that shall represent the genuine Democracy of America. [Cheers.] And, sir, I ask Americans-- men who profess an exalted patriotism and love of country, and broad and expansive nationality--I ask them to come here and unite with us to save the first principles of American liberty-- free speech, a free press, free soil, free Kansas. [Cheers, and a voice--\"And Freemont.\"] Then let us, one and all, of all parties, forget; and, in the words of Whittier, \"Let us forgive--forgive, unite.\" [Loud cheering.] And then, gentlemen, coming here in this party, willing to sacrifice all our personal feelings, let us join with each other, from every State in the Union, and select a candidate round whom we can all rally, with the hope of winning a glorious victory. For myself, I would sacrifice any man and any friend on earth to unite American Freemen for the rescue of the American Government of the United States from the power of slavery. [Loud cheers.] Look now at our friends in Kansas, who are periling all of life and of hope--who lie down at night with the conviction that their little dwelling may be burned over them before morning, or they themselves may be murdered because they love liberty. I say that when these men are thus being sacrificed, it becomes us to sacrifice our personal preferences for the cause of human liberty in America. [Loud cheers.] Gentlemen, civil war rages beyond the Missouri. This administration of Franklin Pierce has forced that war upon us. Franklin Pierce went to the Cincinnati Convention with the light of the burning dwellings of Kansas flashing upon his brazen brow. [Loud cheers.] He went there with the blood of the murdered freemen of Kansas dripping from his polluted hands. [Loud and continued cheering.] Aye, that Convention spewed out the thing it had used. [Cheers.] It spewed him out, and to-day he has gone down too beneath the withering-scorn and contempt of the American people. [Loud cheers.] Then there is Judge Douglas the man who brought forward this repeal of the Missouri prohibition of slavery; he went into that Convention with high hopes, and he\n\n33\n\ncame out of it with his hopes blasted forever. [Cheers.] The Slave Power saw that it had used Pierce all up. [Cheers.] But there was not a particle of life, or of strength, or of hope in him, and the Slave Power flung him out of the window of that Cincinnati Convention. [Cheers.] The Slave Power knew that Douglas had forever blasted himself before the American People, and that he never could receive their suffrages. [Cheers.] But the Slave Power wanted a tool--it wanted the vote of a Northern State, and it casts its eye to Pennsylvania and James Buchanan. The gentleman, sir, with a glorious name, Judge Emmet, who presided over us this morning, [cheers,] told us that Mr. Buchanan had once said that if he had a drop of Democratic blood in his veins, he would let it out. Well, sir, that is an excellent expression for the candidate of a party that has eliminated every Democratic principle from its platform. [Cheers and laughter.] We have got a Democrat that never had a drop of Democratic blood in his veins, because he is undoubtedly a man of truth, and if he had had a drop of it in him, it would have been let, out. And we have got a platform that has not a single Democratic principle embodied in it. No, not a one. [Laughter and cheers.] And this party, calling itself the Democratic Party, now stands before the country, and has placed its hope upon the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nSir, the gentleman who preceded me said you could not throw Pennsylvania away. She must vote with her Northern sister. Sir, the freemen of Pennsylvania met this crisis with the boldness with which their fathers met the crisis in 1775. Pennsylvania will repudiate this son of hers, and give her vote to the nominee of this Convention. [Loud cheers.] And, sir, I say that we of the East, of the West, and of the Centre States, owe it to our common country, and the cause of liberty, to carry every free State in the Union for Liberty. [Cheers.] The argument is all ours. The moral sentiment of the nation is ours. Everything that sustains the great cause is fighting to-day upon our side. [Cheers.] Our brethren who went out with us to carry free institutions beyond the Missouri, are being murdered for loving liberty. A Senator of a sovereign state on the floor of Congress, for denouncing the crime against Kansas, has been stricken senseless on the floor of the American Senate.\n\nA voice--\"Three cheers for Sumner.\" [Rounds of vociferous cheering, again and again renewed, greeted this demand.]\n\nA voice--\"Three groans for Brooks.\" [A storm of groans and yells was elicited in response.]\n\nMr. Wilson resumed. We are not only fighting, he said, to save Kansas, to make a Free State beyond the Missouri, but we are fighting to vindicate freedom of speech in the National Congress. [Loud cheers.] I see by telegraphic dispatches from Washington that the announcement is made when that question comes up in the House the Southern gentlemen are to make threats and perhaps to execute them. [Shouts of \"Let them dare! let them dare!\"] Gentlemen, I believe that the men who represent you have made up their minds. [Vociferous cheers and cries of \"Good! bravo!\"] I believe they are firmly resolved to speak their sentiments with entire and absolute freedom. [Renewed cheering.] I believe they have made up their minds to go where duty requires them to go, vote as duty requires them to vote; and I believe they have\n\n34\n\nmade up their minds to defend their persons and their lives whenever--tremendous and long cheering]-- whenever, wherever, however, by whomsoever assailed. [Great cheering.] No, gentlemen, threats will not silence the freemen of the North. We know we have behind us fifteen millions of freemen--[cheers]--we know that if we fail in the exercise of our constitutional duties, and in defense of our constitutional rights, that gallant and true men all over the North will step into our places, and fill them better than we can do. [Loud cheers.] Gentlemen, trouble yourselves with no anxiety about affairs in Washington. We will take care of ourselves. [Thundering cheers.] We want to have it known all over the land that the representatives of the Northern freemen are ready to take care of themselves in the performance of their duty. [Cheers.] But while we make that resolution and adhere to it, in God's name, gentlemen of the North, resolve to do your duty and to blot out out the Slave Power of the country. [Cheers.] We can do it, aye, and I believe in my soul we can do it. [Loud cheers.] But I feel here to-day that millions are looking with trembling anxiety upon the deliberations of this Convention. Disappoint them not, gentlemen, by any petty little interest in the division. Consult with each other in candor and in frankness, and then nominate a man upon whom you can unite with the most votes, and who is true to your principles. [Cheers.] If the bold, gallant Fremont is your candidate -- [enthusiastic cheering-]--we will rally around him the young, the gallant spirits of the Republic; if McLean--the learned McLean--\n\nA voice \"Three cheers for McLean.\" [Loud and prolonged cheering.]\n\nAnother voice--\"Three cheers for Fremont.\" [An overwhelming-shout that almost made the building- shake was the response.]\n\nMr. Wilson, you are divided now in regard to your cheers for Fremont and McLean. After either of them receives your nomination I hope there will be no dividing- cheers.\n\nA voice--\"Take the vote now.\"\n\nSeveral voices--\" No.\"\n\nMr. Wilson, gentlemen, if you nominate the present speaker of the House of Representatives--[cheers]--the first man who led us to victory, let us, all of us of the North, rally around him and sustain the liberty of our country.\n\nA voice--\"Three cheers for Banks.\" [Loud cheering.]\n\nMr. Wilson, if you nominate Salmon P. Chase-- [great cheering] --one of the foremost men of the Republic--let us, all of us rally around him and place him in the Presidential Chair, that he is so well qualified to fill. And, genllemen, if in this Convention you should place your suffrages upon the foremost statesman of America, Wm. H. Seward [three bursts of frantic cheering waving-of hats, handkerchiefs, &c,, the whole assemblage rising enmasse, with which Win. H. Seward's name was received, prevented the speaker from proceeding for several minutes.]\n\nMr. Wilson, aye, gentlemen, I say this foremost statesman of America, and a man ht to lead the movement in which we are engaged. All of these men I believe to be true, to be reliable to be fully with us in the movements in which we are engaged. And gentlemen, whoever we may nominate from among them or others that I name, let us, one and all, unite; for our cause is the cause of Liberty and the cause of Patriotism. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindneys and for the attention with which you have\n\n35\n\nlistened to the few desultory remarks I have thrown, out, and I close by saying that the freemen of the North have a right to govern this country, and we have assembled here to-day to take the Government of the Republic and to be the party of the Constitution, of the Union--of union, of law, of order, and of property. [Tremendous cheering, amidst which the honorable gentleman resumed his seat.]\n\nOn motion, the Convention adjourned till tomorrow, Wednesday morning, at ten o'clock,\n\nSECOND DAY'S PROCEEDINGS.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, Wednesday, 18th June, 1856.\n\nThe Convention assembled at ten o'clock.\n\nHon.
