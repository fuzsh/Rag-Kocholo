Jeter, Registered Professional Reporter and Notary Public in and for the State of South Carolina.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n\nJ. William McLeod - Columbia\n\nBecky R. Martin - Anderson\n\nRebecca Davis Richardson - Lake Wylie\n\nMcKinley Washington, Jr. - Ravenel\n\nPUBLIC SESSION\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We're going to call the meeting to order. I would like to welcome Mr. McLeod and Representative Martin to the hearing. And I think the first person that we're going to speak with is Commissioner McLeod.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Mr. Chairman, do you want to swear them in, or do you want me to?\n\nIf you will stand and raise your right hand. You've got to be sworn in.\n\n(WITNESS SWORN.)\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Please be seated. The staff will ask you some questions.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Mr. McLeod, we have a series of questions. And for the members of the committee, Mr. McLeod has provided a sworn statement and a Personal Data Questionnaire with detailed answers to questions regarding education, employment history, professional memberships and affiliations, appropriate conduct, office administration and temperament. That statement was provided to all of the commission members earlier and is included in your notebooks under tab one. I see no concerns with the statement. And with the committee's approval, I would ask that the statement be entered into the public record at this time.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: So moved.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Okay.\n\nEXAMINATION BY MS. CRAIG:\n\nQ. Mr. McLeod, if you would answer the following questions:\n\nDo you affirm that the answers you previously provided the committee on the Personal Data Questionnaire, the statement of economic interest and the sworn statement are true and correct?\n\nA. They are.\n\nQ. There was one change you --\n\nA. I would like to mention -- I think it was number 17 that we discussed earlier about the letterhead.\n\nQ. This is on the sworn statement. Question 17, it asked, If currently serving as a commissioner while campaigning for this office, if you used commission letterhead or the services of your staff or your campaign?\n\nA. Right. I have two stationeries. I have the state, and of course I have a personal stationery that I send birthday letters out and so forth that I hope each one of you have received in the past. But this one was sent on my state stationery, which just said my intent to run for the House - I mean, for the commission. And I think I sent it to Chairman Verne; is that correct?\n\nQ. Yes, sir.\n\nA. I wanted to clarify that, because I think when I checked the answer, I checked no.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: The other thing, in the event if usage of that nature does occur, all it does is require the individual to pay the cost of it, the cost associated with it. I don't think the question addressed that if you have -- if you reimbursed the State for the necessary costs related to it.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: I wanted to clarify that, because after our discussion, I did check no when it should have been I used it for an answer to number 17.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: So you will reimburse the State for that?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: I'll be more than happy to.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Any other questions?\n\nBY MS. CRAIG:\n\nQ. If you will proceed and answer the following questions: Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which contracts with state or federal government?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which receives state or federal funds from the Employment Security Commission?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you ever been arrested, charged or held by federal, state or other law enforcement authorities for a violation of the law, regulation or ordinance?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you, to your knowledge, ever been under federal, state or local investigation for possible violation of a criminal statute?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Has a tax lien or collection procedure ever been instituted against you personally by federal, state or local authorities?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics or unprofessional conduct by any court, agency, association or professional group?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are you now or have you ever been employed as a lobbyist or acted in the capacity of a lobbyist principal?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Do you know of any reason you would have difficulty performing the duties of the Employment Security Commission?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. As of today, have you asked for any commitments from any person for this position?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Have you made any statements that you have a certain number of votes already committed to you?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Okay. One thing we did not send to you all is the financial information and the credit report. We have it available if you would like to look at it, but everything was in good standing.\n\nBY MS. CRAIG:\n\nQ. If you would tell us briefly about yourself and explain why you would like to serve on this board.\n\nA. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. It has been a pleasure and certainly a privilege for me to serve as commissioner for the past 16 years. You and your colleagues have elected me four times to serve as commissioner, and I think I have done an excellent job with your trust, and I will be seeking -- this is my fifth term, and will be my final term. I would think after 20 years, I will have enough time in at that time that would meet my retirement. So this would be the last time I would be seeking this office. But with my 16 years, I'm the senior member of the commission. Commissioner Wells, who is not going to run this time, has eight years; and Commissioner Washington is concluding his first term, which is four years. I feel like with my experience of the 16 years, that I offer a service not only to my employees that work with our agency, but to the state and to the people that we serve. We're going through, like most state agencies, some tough times. And I would hope that you would agree that my 16 years of experience would certainly help not only our agency, but the people. I will be glad to answer any questions at this time.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Does anyone on the panel have a question? Senator Ryberg?\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Billy, how many employees do you all have?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Around 1,100 at this time. And when I went there in 1988, we had right at 1,300, Senator. So because of some of the budget cuts and all, although we're federally funded, we are down 200 employees, and we're probably doing as much work now as we have in the past because of the plant closures and the unemployment rate at this time.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: So you all are federally funded for operations, not any state money that's --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: We federally funded our budget. Our money comes out of the labor department. Now, the taxes are paid by the employer, as you're aware of, I'm sure. You pay on each employee that you have that works for you. That's the money that's used to pay the unemployment benefits. But our actual operating expenses, I think, during the budget year are less than $200,000, is what we get from the state to run the agency.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: The monies that are collected, do y'all control those or does the treasurer control them? How is the --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: We control them. They're put -- we have a trust fund, which -- and I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to get to our trust fund. At this point, it's $420 million which is in our trust fund. That sounds like a lot. But in the year 2000, we had over $800 million in this trust fund. Now, what has happened, because of the unemployment rates and the plant closures and all, we have not been taking in as much money from the employers to pay all of the unemployment benefits. So when that happens, we have to take money out of the trust fund, which I try to explain to people that we're no more than an insurance company. You're paying an insurance premium on your employees. And the last couple of years, we've been having to take money out of the trust. So we've actually used around $300 million of our trust fund money to make up for the money that has not been coming in from the employers.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: What has the shortfall run over the last 12 months? Is it a couple hundred million dollars?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Last year, I think we used 140 million from our trust fund, just to be able to meet our obligations to the unemployment.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: The trust fund is vested in what, short-term securities or --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Yes. And that's another problem we're having, where we had 800 million, of course, the interest goes into the trust fund. So when we had 800 million, we were getting a lot more interest on our money than we do now. So I think -- I could check on this for you. But if I'm not mistaken, maybe we've got around $10 million or maybe 15 million this year, something like that, was the interest. So we get hurt in two ways when it drops down.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Billy, you're the chairman of the Employment Security Commission.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: I'm the chairman at this time. We have a very unusual situation, and it's apparently always been this way. We rotate our chairmanship. So although I'm the senior member by eight years, we rotate every 16 months.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Every 16?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Every 16 months we rotate. So each commissioner would be chairman for 16 months out of the four-year term. And it's been where I've always been the chairman the end of the last 16 months of each of my terms.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Is there an executive director?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Yes. We have an executive director that the commissioners hire, and he works at our pleasure. And the current executive is Ted Hadley from Camden. He works at our pleasure.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Thank you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Any other questions? Representative Thompson?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: Thank you, Senator. Billy, you said that you had a total of $200,000 from state appropriated funds, correct, for --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: It's actually less than 200. That's the ballpark figure. I think it's probably maybe closer to 160,000, is what we get from the state. And that's for one particular program. We call it SCOIT (phonetic). That's the one where we send people into high schools. And they go around and tell ninth and tenth graders maybe what field vocation they should be in by the time they graduate, and that's the only area that we get state funds.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: What's the total budget? I mean, proceeds that you get from the federal government.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Give me a corner and five minutes and I will tell you. But offhand, I don't -- it is really -- I wish I could answer that for you. I don't know offhand. I would hate to give you the wrong figure.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: You had mentioned the trust fund that you had. Is the trust fund - is the sole purpose of the trust fund to cover shortfalls?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Yeah. As a matter of fact, 1999 or 2000, we went to the General Assembly -- when I say \"we,\" I mean the Employment Security Commission - and asked you all to help us maintain our trust fund, because there was a move at one time when everything was doing good in the economy that people thought maybe employers shouldn't have to continue paying the tax rates that they were paying. And after we made our case to both the Senate and the House, you all were kind enough to allow us to continue to -- we have a formula that keeps our trust fund where we will not actually ever lose it. North Carolina at this point is having to borrow money from the federal government to pay unemployment, where we're fortunate, we have this trust fund, where if we need money, we can withdraw money from it.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: Is there like a minimum balance that you have to keep in this trust account, or it just fluctuates?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Well, it's fluctuating now. But actually, there's a formula where 2 percent of the employers' wages, total wages -- just for example, it was 43 billion dollars, is the wages that were turned in by the employers last year. We have 93,000 employers in this state, and the total wages were almost $43 billion. Two percent of that is supposed to remain in our trust fund to keep us in a position where we would never go broke like some of the states - our neighboring states.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: You said one time it was at $800 million. Is that the highest it's ever been?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: That's the highest, and that's where we would probably like to have it now. It will not jump up that much in one year. We're hoping if times get better and the economy turns around, that it will eventually get up to around 800 million. But this year, we only have 430 million now, I think, in our trust fund and we're -- I think even with the new tax increase that will be given to the employers, we're looking at still about a $200 million - somewhere around 600 million is what we expect to have there next year.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I apologize to all of you for being late, but we had to attend the big announcement about our Clemson, BMW, Microsoft deal in Mauldin, and it was a very exciting announcement. It looks like it's going to be a great thing, and I think it's going to be a -- it's going to be good enough to where it's worth waiting for. I hope so.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: I think one of my fellow commissioners may have been up there with you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yeah. I believe she was red-headed.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Mr. Washington and I sent her up there on our behalf so we could be here with you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I'm glad you were represented, Mr. McLeod.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, after each commissioner, do we make a motion or what?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Well, we want to be sure that everybody is through asking questions.\n\nSENATOR FORD: I mean after that.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yes. Then what did you say about executive session, Ms. Martha? She said we want to hear from all of them first and make a motion to go into executive session, and then come out and do what we're doing in public. That's what Ms. Martha says, and that's usually right. Any further questions?\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Mr. Chairman?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yes, sir.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Commissioner McLeod, on the trust fund that you're speaking of, that's the state money that goes in there, or is that state and federal?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: That's the money that we get from the employers, but it's the state. Well, actually, I reckon it's your federal money, if you think about we're a federal agency. It's the money, Senator, that you pay on your employees like you're required to do. That's the money that we put in the trust fund to pay out the unemployment, if you would have to have some employees who was entitled to the unemployment benefits.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: In other words, when an employer sends the money in, that's where it goes into that trust fund?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: We keep that money, and it's put into -- like I explained awhile ago, we feel like it's an insurance. Actually, that's where the name -- we got the unemployment insurance, because, really, all it is is a policy that you as an employer are paying to protect your employees in case something would happen and you would have to have a layoff or they would be discharged.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: What happens if we go broke?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Well, thanks to you all, I don't think that would happen right now because y'all have given us some measures, safety nets that would protect us. But there are some surrounding states and states at this time that are having to borrow money now from the federal government from the labor department in Washington just to pay their unemployment benefits. And they will have to, I imagine, pay that money back. I imagine they're going to eventually have to tax the employers more in order to recover that money, is what I would think.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: That would be the avenue of something we --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: That would be the only way we could get the money. If something would happen, to answer your question, and we would run out of money with our trust fund, the only option we would have would be to increase the taxes you're paying to rebuild the trust fund, yes.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: This commission has the authority to do that, to increase the levy on the employers?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Only with you all's approval.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: The legislature --\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Right. We would have to go to you and ask you to allow us to raise the taxes for that purpose.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Can you project anything in the future on where we are and how we're looking?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Well, the only projection we have is, next year we're still looking to probably not take in enough money to meet the unemployment that we will be paying out. So we're looking for another year of reducing our trust fund, but not as a great amount as we did this past year. Of course, all of that is projections.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Well, that ends my questions. I want to commend you for a great job. I think you're doing a great job.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Thank you so much, Senator.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Any further questions from members of the committee? Thank you, sir. We will call on the next person.\n\nMR. MCLEOD: Is it all right at this time that I could leave? There is no reason for me to stay around?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Do you think it's all right to let him go?\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Since he's had back surgery, we might as well let him go.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: So you had some back surgery?\n\nMR. MCLEOD: September the 8th, I had a ruptured disk.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I hope you get along good. Thank you. Helen Ann, go ahead and swear Ms. Becky in.\n\nMS. THROWER: Ms. Martin, would you please raise your right hand to be sworn?\n\n(WITNESS SWORN.)\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: You want to ask those questions for us, please, ma'am?\n\nMS. THROWER: Yes, sir. Thank you. Ms. Martin has provided a sworn statement and a Personal Data Questionnaire, with detailed answers to questions regarding education, employment history, professional memberships and affiliations, appropriate conduct, office administration and temperment. That statement and questionnaire was provided to all committee members earlier and is included in your notebooks, I believe, behind tab two. I have reviewed the documents, and at this point, I have no concerns and would ask that they be admitted into the record at this time. And Mr. Chairman, I would have a few questions of Ms. Martin.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Okay.\n\nEXAMINATION BY MS. THROWER:\n\nQ. Ms. Martin, with regards to your Personal Data Questionnaire -- you and I discussed this briefly earlier today -- number 28, when asked expenditures you've made in furtherance of your candidacy for this position, your answer was to see the attached. I wanted to clarify for the record that the attachment you provided was actually regarding expenditures for your house seat, and that you've in fact spent, I believe, $86 on stationery and stamps in furtherance of this position; is that correct?\n\nA. Right. But I think that actually came out of my own personal -- I think there was a list, and a page was left off when it was put on the disk.\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. So since I was already in training, I didn't have the written. I will get a copy of the written. The stationery is something like $30. The envelopes or the -- and the printing was a little bit about that, and the stamps.\n\nQ. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify that for the record. With the exception of that question, do you affirm that the answers you previously provided to the committee on your Personal Data Questionnaire, sworn statement and statement of economic interest are true and correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Ms. Martin, do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which contracts with state or federal government?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which receives state or federal funds from the Employment Security Commission?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you ever been arrested, charged or held by federal, state or other law enforcement authorities for violation of the law, regulation or ordinance?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Ms. Martin, have you, to your knowledge, ever been under federal, state or local investigation for possible violation of a criminal statute?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Has a tax lien or collection procedure ever been instituted against you personally by federal, state or local authorities?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics or unprofessional conduct by any court, agency, association or professional group?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. And are you now or have you ever been employed as a lobbyist or acted in the capacity of a lobbyist principal?\n\nA. Yes, ma'am.\n\nQ. You have? Will you tell us a little bit about that, briefly?\n\nA. From 1990 to 1996, I was proud to work for the state employees under the State Employees Association. I worked -- I lobbied for their benefits, insurance, and mainly to be a liaison between the working staff of the government and the legislators who were making the decisions about what benefits and pay they would receive.\n\nQ. Thank you. Ms. Martin, do you know of any reason you would have difficulty performing the duties of this position?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you sought or received a pledge of any legislator prior to this date?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Have you sought or received a conditional pledge of support of any legislator pending the outcome of your screening?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. And are you familiar with the pledging prohibitions under Title Eight, which prohibits a candidate for an office elected by the General Assembly from seeking directly the pledge of a member of the General Assembly until the qualifications of all candidates for the office have been determined by the appropriate joint committee to review the candidates for that office?\n\nA. Yes, ma'am.\n\nQ. Thank you, Ms. Martin.\n\nMS. THROWER: I apologize. I would like to note that as Ms. Craig stated, the financial statement and credit check are available, if you all would like to review those. I have reviewed the documents and have no questions.\n\nBY MS. THROWER:\n\nQ. My last question is, if you would, briefly tell us about yourself and explain why you would like to serve on this commission.\n\nA. Thank you. Well, I apologize for the cold and the deep voice today. I am married, and my husband is a letter carrier, and we have two daughters and two grandsons. And because of the grandsons, I probably have this cold, because when you love them and they love you. But also, I have spent the past week reading in some of the schools, and there is a lot of germs there. But I feel qualified for this job and am seeking this job because I feel like I have had the experience and the knowledge and the background to serve this state well and in this position. Not only have I lived in -- I was born close to the coast, and I went to school in Winnsboro, worked briefly in Columbia for awhile, and then also in the Upstate. So it kind of gives me knowledge of the different employments and employers around the state. Also, I feel that with my knowledge of government, which started off, actually, through the Employment Security Commission, because when my husband graduated from Francis Marion in Florence, we were transferred to the upstate, and he began working with Milliken, and so that put me unemployed for awhile. And so I actually started off -- so I have received the unemployment checks. I went to work under the CETA (phonetic) program, which was a special job training program at the time that some of the counties would receive in order to help them with their needs. And in that job, that was at the Anderson County Health Department, I worked as -- I functioned as a district accountant working in government funds and understanding a little bit more about how the government uses -- utilizes its funds for employees as one of the largest, probably, expenses we have, but they're also the ones that provide service. So after being -- after being in that position and being concerned, I got involved in how the legislature fit in with the state government. And during that time, I had the opportunity to go across many of the counties and work with many of the people, not only in -- through DHEC, but through some of the other agencies. And it gave me a great opportunity just to see how our state operated. And after I left the Employees Association, I decided that -- I'm the type of person that, instead of just sitting back and complaining about something, I like to be a part of it and try to solve it. That's why I ran for the House, so that I could probably be a part of that change. And also, I think on one of those papers, when it was giving the service, I think they have a year there instead of at present, because I'm still presently a legislator. One of the other things that I feel that makes it important is that I really care about the state of South Carolina, and I want to see us use our funds wisely. I want to see good jobs coming into South Carolina. And I know that the Employment Security Commission right now is number one in the nation, and I would like to see it continue to be that way. We have a great state. We have a lot to be proud of. I feel like with my ability to meet other people and have the opportunity to -- I'm always willing to learn and grow and to set an example for others, that they too can be strong. So I also would like to be a part of helping motivate the employees we do have in our state to be the best that they can be. And because I have been an employer, as well, because I work -- I am a realtor part-time, but there's really no such thing as a part-time realtor. You either do it or you don't. So lately, I haven't been as much as I would like to. But I have people working for me. So I feel like I know both sides of being an employee and an employer. And one of my strongest desires is to treat people fairly. I feel like that's the main concern that most people have. They just want to be treated fairly, whether it's taxes, whether it's employment decisions or anything you do, they just would like to be -- feel like they've had their opportunity or just treated fairly. So I hope to continue to promote that in our state. Like I said, I've been through the unemployment line. So I know what it's like there to sit there and wait. I've had the opportunity to grow. So I know that this agency is one that works. And I feel like the management and leadership is the most important part of being in the agency, running the organization, and I would like to be a positive part of that.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Thank you, ma'am. Do any members of the committee have questions? You must have been very convincing. I don't think they have anything.\n\nMS. MARTIN: Well, I appreciate you all being here. Also, being a legislator, I understand the many hours that you put in, and it's a nice day out there. So thank you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We're glad to have you, Ms. Becky. You're free to go.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Mr. Chairman, is there a list of qualifications for people to serve in this position or is there a -- is there legislative criteria?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I don't know, Martha. Is there legislative criteria?\n\nMS. CRAIG: This is the only board left that you do -- that has no qualifications. There's nothing in the statute dealing with qualifications for this board.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: It's left up to our judgment.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Just the fact that you have served in the legislator is the only qualification?\n\nMS. CRAIG: This is the only one you can be a sitting legislator and run for. We're ahead of schedule. Mr. Washington, we just called him. He is on his way over. Ms. Richardson said she would be here by 3:25. If you want to go ahead and vote on these two at this point.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, could I ask Ms. Martha a question?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: You certainly can.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Billy, the first gentleman, said that -- he said that he's got 1,100 employees. Are they state employees; do you know?\n\nMS. CRAIG: You're considered for the purposes of retirement and state benefits state employees.\n\nSENATOR FORD: But the money comes from the feds?\n\nMS. CRAIG: Right.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Explain that 43 billion again. What was he saying about that; do you know?\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: What he said was, it was 43 billion dollars payroll, but they collect taxes on it.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: All of the workers.\n\nSENATOR FORD: In the State.\n\nMS. CRAIG: I gave Representative Thompson the budget. It's 177,000 of state funds and 117 million --\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: $117,535,779 total base budget.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Only 177,000 are state dollars.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: It might be incumbent upon this committee to let one of the appropriations -- Senate appropriations, House appropriations, take a look at where we are in terms of compensation payout and projection as we need to in this upcoming budget year. If it looks like the economy is going to be soft for a little while longer, to raise the percentages or the rate to be charged. We need to probably send something forward, rather than waiting on the trust fund to zero itself out and come to us, and we don't have a whole lot right now to put in there. But if we can get ahead of this thing by a year or so, we can probably reinstate the trust fund. It's always easy to cut it in good times, but to raise it in bad times --\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Who would you recommend do that, Representative Scott?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: You can get it on the Senate side --\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: Mr. Chairman, I would recommend you have it done on the House side. I don't think the Senate wants to.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Well, I don't think it's -- I don't think to do those projections is that big of a deal. If you will look at what your normal payout is, I'm pretty sure that, through the use of the Budget and Control Board, may have to send it over to them, as well, and coming to some type of agreement and look at your projections, which should be pretty close to knowing where you are with this.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Would you like to request --\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: I think this committee needs to make that kind of request before we get ourselves so far in the rate that we have not done anything, and end coming back to the committee anyway. At least have somebody take a look at it.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Representative Vaughn?\n\nTHE VICE-CHAIRMAN: Didn't the first speaker, Mr. McLeod, say that they had made the projections for this coming year and that it would not affect the trust fund to the point where we would need to do that? I don't know who made the projection.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Maybe she can read back what he said, but I thought he said after this year, we'll have some pretty tough shortfalls, unless I misunderstood.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE THOMPSON: If I could interject. He did say that the trust fund still had a pretty healthy balance of around $450 million.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: He also said that the trust fund had come from the $800 million to 400.\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: But I think he also said, Representative Scott, that he expected it -- I thought he said increases put in to have it go back to $600 million. So --\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: He said that they could come to the legislature and ask for increases to bring it back up. I don't know what their numbers look like. I don't want to sit on this thing and then get a balloon.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: What about asking Commissioner McLeod to have their staff report to us in writing on this question, so we would have it in hand and we would know more?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: That sounds pretty reasonable.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Would that suit you all?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Yes, sir.\n\nSENATOR O'DELL: Mr. Chairman, I believe he also said that if something went wrong with it, it went broke, they could borrow it from the federal government. So we're not looking at a situation where it's just going to be depleted all at one time. I don't want to raise any employment taxes unless we --\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: It won't hurt us to get it in writing, on account of what he told us. I will ask Ms. Martha if it's agreeable with the committee.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, this committee, after we finish our duties on this, that's the end of us; right?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yes.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Well, not the end of us, but --\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We were created for one purpose.\n\nSENATOR FORD: One purpose, right.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: It's to screen the candidates. But as a member of the General Assembly, we are still under an obligation to learn a little more about the financial situation. I guess that's what you feel, Mr. Scott. That will be all right. Well, we have to wait, I guess, on the others. How about voting on the two we've got? Would that suit you?\n\nSENATOR RYBERG: That's a good idea.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Is there a motion that we would recommend John William (Billy) McLeod for confirmation?\n\nSENATOR FORD: So moved.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: A motion is made and seconded. All in favor, say aye. The ayes have it. Now, how about Ms. Becky R. Martin?\n\nSENATOR FORD: So moved.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: The motion is made, seconded. All in favor say aye or vote no. They ayes have it. That tends to work on those two. Now we've got two more, if we can get them here.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I'm going to call the committee back to order. We have the distinguished former Senator McKinley Washington, who I've had the great honor of serving with in the Senate. We're glad to have you, Mr. Washington. And we will ask Ms. Helen Ann to ask you some questions and kind of guide us through this. I believe she's going to have to swear you in. I know you ain't much on swearing.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: No, sir.\n\nMS. THROWER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Washington, if you would, please raise your right hand to be sworn in.\n\n(WITNESS SWORN.)\n\nMS. THROWER: Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Mr. Washington has provided a sworn statement and Personal Data Questionnaire with detailed answers to questions regarding education, employment history, appropriate conduct and temperament of the office. That statement and questionnaire was provided to the committee members earlier and included in your notebooks. I have no concerns with any of those materials and would ask that they be entered into the public record at this time. Mr. Chairman, at this time I just want to ask a few questions behind tab four of the materials.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: All right.\n\nEXAMINATION BY MS. THROWER:\n\nQ. Mr. Washington, do you affirm that the answers you previously provided the committee on your Personal Data Questionnaire, sworn statement and the statement of economic interest are true and correct?\n\nA. Yes, ma'am, I do.\n\nQ. Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which contracts with state or federal governments?\n\nA. No, I do not.\n\nQ. Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which receives state or federal funds from the Employment Security Commission?\n\nA. We do not.\n\nQ. Have you ever been arrested, charged or held by federal, state or other law enforcement authorities for violation of the law, regulation or ordinance?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Have you, to your knowledge, ever been under federal, state or local investigation for possible violation of a criminal statute?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Mr. Washington, has a tax lien or a collection procedure ever been instituted against you personally by federal, state or local authorities?\n\nA. No, ma'am.\n\nQ. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics or unprofessional conduct by any court, agency, association, or professional group?\n\nA. No, I've not.\n\nQ. Are you now or have you ever been employed as a lobbyist or acted in the capacity of a lobbyist principal?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Mr. Washington, do you know of any reason you would have difficulty performing the duties of this position?\n\nA. No, I do not.\n\nQ. As of this point you have made no campaign expenditures as of today; is that correct?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Have you sought or received the pledge of any legislator prior to this date?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Are you familiar with the pledging prohibitions of Title Eight, which prohibits a candidate for office elected by the General Assembly from seeking directly the pledge of a member of the General Assembly's vote until the qualifications of all candidates for that office have been determined by the appropriate joint committee to review candidates for that office?\n\nA. Yes, ma'am, I'm aware of that.\n\nMS. THROWER: For the record, I would like to note that Mr. Washington's financial statement and credit check are available, if you all would like to review that. I've reviewed the documents and have no concerns with them.\n\nBY MS. THROWER:\n\nQ. Mr. Washington, my last question: If you would, briefly tell us about yourself and explain why you want to serve on the commission, continue serving.\n\nA. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and members of this distinguished panel, thank you for allowing me to be here today. Of course, I have had the opportunity over the years to serve with all of you on the panel today and have served for many, many years in the General Assembly. I am also a Presbyterian pastor. And for the last three years and few months, I have been on the Employment Security Commission, served as the chairperson of that commission. We rotate the chairmanship on the commission. I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve this State for many, many years, now some 20-something years as a legislator and as the commissioner, and had the opportunity to work with the commission, and particularly in a difficult time. The unemployment rate has been very high. And we have been able to provide the kind of service to this State and to the people of this state that we are very proud of. I want to also say that since I've been on the commission, this commission has been awarded the top award for the last couple of years, the two highest awards this past year of any Employment Security Commission in the nation. The executive director and our computer staff director was awarded the top award just a few months ago out in the state of Washington. So we're very proud of what the agency has done. And also, in the last few years, this agency was way down the line as far as their employment record as far as diversity, et cetera. Now we're up in the top. We have a strong director who is doing a tremendous job, and certainly I would want to continue to serve just a little bit longer to make sure that we continue to build the agency the way it ought to be.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Thank you, sir.\n\nMS. THROWER: I have no further questions at this time.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Members of the committee? You all are going to let him get by that easy?\n\nTHE VICE-CHAIRMAN: Good man.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Tell us about the Presbyterian church.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: I think I will leave that up to Elder Smith to do that for you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We are clicking on the same burner on that, aren't we?\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: Yes, sir.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Well, Senator Washington, it's a pleasure to have you with us, and glad that you'll serve on this important commission, because I know you will do a good job. We will excuse you now, and we are going to vote on you as soon as you go out the door. I don't want you to see who votes against you now.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: Well, thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank the members of this committee for the support that you give to the Employment Security Commission and some of the legislation that you had to pass to make sure that our job is taken care of and make it much easier for us. And I just want to say to you that we will continue to ask you to support the Employment Security Commission, particularly now with -- the unemployment rate is still going up, and of course the next report will be out next week, and there will -- you're still going to see that we still have a problem in this State.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Senator, Representative Scott had some concerns about a little more information on the financial. If you would, ask him what you think we need, Representative Scott, and he can get it for us.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Yes, sir. This was nothing skewed towards you, Senator. It was more skewed towards making sure that the trust fund maintained the level of dollars it needed to. I don't know how far you guys are along with doing an analysis. In the event the state may need to raise the rate to make sure you've got enough funds, so we don't end up going to the federal government to try to borrow a little money, so we can offset this thing early on, maybe with a little small increase until this market picks up a little bit.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: We're in pretty good shape right now, Representative Scott. We were much higher than we are now. We're still around about 400 million, I believe. This money comes from the employers, et cetera. We looked at what North Carolina did and what -- the condition that they're in now. They're in terrible, terrible trouble, because they had to do exactly what you're talking about. But because the legislature in South Carolina did what we did a few years ago, we're in pretty good shape at this particular point now. I don't think we necessarily need to talk about raising that at this point.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Thank you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Does that satisfy you?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Yes, sir.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the gentleman a question.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yes, sir.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Senator, how many commissioners are in North Carolina; do you know? And how are they elected? Do they go through the same process that we go through?\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: No, they are not. I don't think North Carolina --\n\nSENATOR FORD: They're elected by popular vote from the public; right?\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: No, no.\n\nSENATOR FORD: They're not? The states that have popular election, how are they doing?\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: We don't have any popular election of Employment Security Commissioners that I'm aware of. Either they are by the General Assembly or they're on the governor's.\n\nSENATOR FORD: What's North Carolina?\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: North Carolina, I think, is appointed with the advice and consent.\n\nSENATOR FORD: So we can always blame the governor if we go to that system.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: Don't get me into that one.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, one more question to you. This is to you. In your years in politics, have you ever known anybody to pay back the federal government, any government entity? I know the city, we borrowed a lot of money when I was on council.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Charleston never paid nobody back.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: You didn't pay the state back.\n\nSENATOR FORD: I thought that was a loan borrowed.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I just don't have that information.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: Mr. Chairman, I think he's trying to ease up out of his seat.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We will let you go. We enjoyed having you. I don't want to keep you away from your work too long. As much as we pay you, I want you to work hard.\n\nMR. WASHINGTON: Thank you so much.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Did we vote on that? Representative Scott moves that we approve Senator Washington.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE TAYLOR: Seconded.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: All in favor say aye, vote no. The ayes have it. We will recess until the other lady comes.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We will call our committee back to order. And I am going to ask Ms. Martha to ask you a few questions, Ms. Becky.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Ms. Richardson, if you would, raise your right hand to be sworn in.\n\n(WITNESS SWORN.)\n\nMS. CRAIG: Thank you. Ms. Richardson has provided a sworn statement and a Personal Data Questionnaire with detailed answers to questions regarding education, employment history, professional memberships and affiliations, appropriate conduct, office administration and temperament. That statement was provided to all commission members earlier and it's included in your notebook under tab three. I've looked at the information. There are no concerns. Everything seems to be in order. And with the committee's approval, would ask that these statements be entered into the public record at this time.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: So done.\n\nEXAMINATION BY MS. CRAIG:\n\nQ. If you will answer the following questions: Do you affirm that the answers you previously provided the committee on the Personal Data Questionnaire, the statement of economic interest, and the sworn statement are true and correct?\n\nA. Yes. There would probably be one correction. My son, my youngest son, I said that he was an assistant manager at Starbucks.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Turn your mic on.\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: My youngest son, I think I stated in there that he was an assistant manager with Starbucks. This past week, he just took new employment. He's going to work for Standard Lighting. This is a company that my husband's son runs. So my son is going to work for my husband's son in sales at Standard Lighting in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nBY MS. CRAIG:\n\nQ. We will make note of that. Ms. Richardson, do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which contracts with state or federal government?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Do you or any member of your family own or operate any business which receives state or federal funds from the Employment Security Commission?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you ever been arrested, charged or held by federal, state or other law enforcement authorities for violation of the law, regulation or ordinance?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Have you, to your knowledge, ever been under federal, state or local investigation for possible violation of a criminal statute?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Has a tax lien or collection procedure ever been instituted against you personally by federal, state or local authorities?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics or unprofessional conduct by any court, agency, association or professional group?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you now or have you ever been employed as a lobbyist or acted in the capacity of a lobbyist principal?\n\nA. No, I have not.\n\nQ. Do you know of any reason you would have difficulty performing the duties of this position?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you sought to receive the pledge of any legislator prior to this date?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are you familiar with the pledging prohibitions found in Title Eight, which prohibits a candidate for an office elected by the General Assembly from directly seeking the pledge of a member until the qualifications have been published?\n\nA. Yes, I'm very much aware of that.\n\nQ. If you will, tell us briefly about yourself and explain why you would like to serve.\n\nMS. CRAIG: Before I do that, let me tell the committee that her financial and her credit report were in good order, and they are available to anyone who wants to look at them on the committee.\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: Thank you. I want to thank you for traveling down here and for waiting for me, even though I'm on time. And Senator Smith, I really would like to personally thank your staff for their assistance. They were so efficient and so helpful during the application process. You have good, dedicated people working for you.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Great.\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: My desire to serve on the Employment Security Commission is really a continuation of my service in the General Assembly. I want to take the same dedication to helping people in another capacity. And having served as chairman of House Ethics Committee for a number of years now, I know the importance of fairness and honesty and integrity, and I believe that I would be a very fair and impartial hearing officer in cases coming before the commission. I have a high energy level and a desire to work really hard to be the best commissioner possible.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Thank you.\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: Do you want me to say anything else?\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: I think that covers it. What else?\n\nMS. CRAIG: That's all of the questions I have.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Do members of the committee have questions? You all are going to let her off that easy? Is there a motion?\n\nTHE VICE-CHAIRMAN: I make the motion.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Representative Vaughn makes the motion that she be confirmed. Found worthy, well qualified and whatever else we need to find out about you. Is there a second to that? Seconded. All in favor say aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it. Just like falling off a log, wasn't it?\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: Yes.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We're glad to have you. I had to tease you a little bit.\n\nMS. RICHARDSON: Thank you. I'm sorry that I didn't speed your process along.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We needed a little break.\n\nSENATOR FORD: Mr. Chairman, when will --\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Ms. Martha is going to tell us what's going to happen now.\n\nSENATOR FORD: When are they able to get pledges?\n\nMS. CRAIG: They cannot get pledges until the committee report is published in the journals of the House and the Senate. We will work with the clerks of the two bodies to have those printed in the journals on the first day of this session, which is January 13th. After that time, on Wednesday, the 14th, anytime after 10:00 a.m., they will be able to start seeking pledges. Also, there will be a joint resolution probably in -- going along with judicial screening to set the election for Wednesday, February the 4th. And then the newly elected commissioners would begin service on July 1st.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Any other questions from members of the committee? Is there a motion that we adjourn?\n\nSENATOR FORD: We abandoned.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: We abandoned.\n\n(There being nothing further, the proceedings concluded at 3:38 p.m.)\n\nReport Summary\n\nThe following persons were found qualified to be candidates in the Employment Security Commission election by a majority of the members of the Screening Committee:\n\nThree Seats with four (4) year terms to begin on July 1, 2004:\n\nJ. William McLeod - Columbia\n\nBecky R. Martin - Anderson\n\nRebecca Davis Richardson - Lake Wylie\n\nMcKinley Washington, Jr. - Ravenel\n\nThe candidates may begin to seek commitments after 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, January 14, 2004.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ J.

Wilkins, Speaker\n\nSouth Carolina House of Representatives\n\n508 Blatt Building\n\nColumbia, South Carolina 29211\n\nDear Mr. Speaker and Members of the House:\n\nI am returning H.3749 , R.127, the fiscal year 2003-04 General Appropriations Act, with the following vetoes:\n\nPart IA\n\nVeto 1 Part 1A, Section 5N, Technical and Comprehensive Education Board, page 67, Motorcycle Safety Program, $118,675\n\nAlthough it is my understanding this is an effective program, I am vetoing this item because it should be funded through tuition or general operating funds as would be the case with other technical college programs.\n\nVeto 2 Part 1A, Section 56C, Governor's Office - Executive Policy & Programs, page 240, Poet Laureate, $1,200\n\nI am vetoing this item because a Poet Laureate has been appointed who has agreed to serve in this position without honorarium.\n\nVeto 3 Part 1A, Section 56C, Governor's Office - Executive Policy & Programs, page 240, Litter Control, $321,949\n\nI am vetoing this item because Palmetto Pride receives over $2.5 million in court fines annually. It is no longer necessary to appropriate general funds to the program.\n\nVeto 4 Part 1A, Section 56C, Governor's Office - Executive Policy & Programs, Item III. A. 3., page 243, Commission on Women, $99,955\n\nI am vetoing the appropriations for this commission, but the commission will remain intact. I will assign personnel assigned elsewhere in the Governor's office to provide part-time support.\n\nVeto 5 Part 1A, Section 63, Budget and Control Board, page 264, S.C. Leadership, $60,045\n\nI am vetoing this item because I believe a leadership program such as this should be funded exclusively by the participants and/or their organizations.\n\nPart IB\n\nVeto 6 Part 1B, Section 8.34, Department of Health and Human Services, page 326, DHHS: Prescription Reimbursement Payment Methodology\n\nI am vetoing this section because it unduly restricts the agency's ability to set prescription rates competitively.\n\nVeto 7 Part 1B, Section 8.38, Department of Health and Human Services, page 326, DHHS: Medicaid Fiscal Impacts\n\nI am vetoing this section because the reporting requirements are unduly cumbersome. However, I will instruct the agency director to issue an annual report to legislative leadership on the changes addressed in the section.\n\nVeto 8 Part 1B, Section 8.40, Department of Health and Human Services, page 327, DHHS: Medication Exemptions\n\nI am vetoing this section because it reduces the efficacy of an important health and human services reform and cost-saving initiative.\n\nVeto 9 Part 1B, Section 8.47, Department of Health and Human Services, page 328, DHHS: SCRIPTS; Prescription Savings\n\nI am vetoing this section because H.3586, R125 has been signed into law with a more realistic effective date, which renders this section unnecessary.\n\nVeto 10 Part 1B, Section 19.6, State Museum, page 344, MUSM: Across-the-Board Cut Exemption\n\nI am vetoing this section because it is inconsistent with the manner with which across-the-board cuts are administered within other agencies.\n\nVeto 11 Part 1B, Section 19.9, State Museum, page 344, MUSM: Foundation Office Rent\n\nI am vetoing this section because it is inconsistent with the manner with which other foundations are expected to reimburse the state for the use of facilities.\n\nVeto 12 Part 1B, Section 19.10, State Museum, page 344, MUSM: Admissions Tax Exemption\n\nI am vetoing this section because it is inconsistent with the manner in which other entities collect and remit the admissions tax.\n\nVeto 13 Part 1B, Section 22.6, Department of Agriculture, page 346, AGRI: Commissioners' Funding\n\nI am vetoing this section because the Commissioners' per diem rate should be subject to the same prioritization process as other expenditures when an agency is forced to reduce its budget.\n\nVeto 14 Part 1B, Section 36.1, Department of Public Safety, page 361, DPS: Special Events Traffic Control\n\nI am vetoing this section because I believe that the Department of Public Safety, at its discretion, should be able to assess reasonable fees for support provided to special events.\n\nVeto 15 Part 1B, Section 36.27, Department of Public Safety, pages 364-365, DPS: Ten Year Driver's License\n\nI am vetoing this section because S.342, R116 has been signed into law, which renders this section unnecessary.\n\nVeto 16 Part 1B, Section 63.2, Budget and Control Board, page 395, BCB: Performance Excellence\n\nI am vetoing this section as I am concerned that techniques such as Baldrige, and its antecedents TQM and MBO, too often emphasize process to the exclusion of substantive knowledge. Moreover, these techniques cultivate reliance upon a \"one size fits all\" management approach irrespective of the size or function of the agency. I would much prefer that agency management devote their time and attention acquiring advanced education in business, public administration or law. This is a better way of ensuring they possess the conceptual understanding to run dynamic organizations and serve the public effectively.\n\nVeto 17 Part 1B, Section 63.40, page 400, BCB: Capitol Complex Rent Exemption\n\nI am vetoing this section because it is inconsistent with the manner with which across-the-board cuts are administered within other agencies.\n\nVeto 18 Part 1B, Section 63.47, page 401, BCB: McEachern Parking Facility\n\nI am vetoing this section because it unduly micromanages an administrative function. It affords no flexibility to deviate from specific hours of operation for the statehouse parking garage for special events, holidays, weekends or disasters. The Budget and Control Board, under the direction of its five members, is the appropriate entity to set policy for the parking garage's hours of operation.\n\nVeto 19 Part 1B, Section 64.14, Department of Revenue, page 405, DOR: County Allocation Adjustments\n\nI am vetoing this section because S.550, R96 has been signed into law, which renders this section unnecessary.\n\nVeto 20 I am vetoing the following distinctly labeled items from Part 1B, Section 73.2, Statewide Funding Requirements, pages 428-430, relating to transfers from subfunds and restricted accounts to the general fund, and the appropriation of such funds from the general fund:\n\nTransfers to the general fund on page 428:\n\nE16-State Treasurer's Office: $617 from Subfund 4066 Disaster Trust Fund\n\nE16-State Treasurer's Office: $1,086 from Subfund 4732 General Ser Ds - Ins Res Fund\n\nE16-State Treasurer's Office: $1,780 from Subfund 4895 Confiscated Cash\n\nE23-Commission on Indigent Defense: $47,374 from Subfund 4313 Indigent Def Services Fund\n\nF03-Budget and Control Board: $451 from Subfund 4153 Funded Debt-Sinking Fund\n\nF03-Budget and Control Board: $12,142 from Subfund 4154 Ordinary Sinking Fund\n\nF03-Budget and Control Board: $33,306 from Subfund 4202 State Life & Ltd.\n\nF03-Budget and Control Board: $295,431 from Subfund 4343 SC Infrastructure Loan Fund\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $193,983 from Subfund 4545 Waste Tire Grant Trust Fund\n\nTransfers to the general fund on pages 428-429:\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $84,335 from Subfund 4546 Petroleum Fund\n\nTransfers to the general fund on page 429:\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $458,305 from Subfund 4641 Haz Waste-Permitted Site Fd\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $50,602 from Subfund 4865 Solid Waste Mgmt Trust Fund\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $9,210 from Subfund 4971 Infectious Waste Contingency Fd\n\nJ04-Dept. of Health & Environmental Control: $468,008 from Subfund 4984 SUPERB Account\n\nK05-Dept. of Public Safety: $23,641 from Subfund 4547 Uninsured Enforcement Fund\n\nP24-Dept. of Natural Resources: $6,781 from Subfund 4189 SC Aquatic Plant Man Tr Fd\n\nP24-Dept. of Natural Resources: $4,962 from Subfund 4373 Nongame Wildlife & Natural Areas\n\nP24-Dept. of Natural Resources: $185,843 from Subfund 4395 Mitigation Trust Fund\n\nP24-Dept. of Natural Resources: $48,338 from Subfund 4520 Heritage Land Trust Fund\n\nP28-Dept. of Parks, Recreation & Tourism: $124,859 from Subfund 4126 PRT Development Fund\n\nP28-Dept. of Parks, Recreation & Tourism: $82,176 from Subfund 4278 Recreation Land Trust\n\nR12-State Accident Fund: $3,200 from Subfund 4168 Escrow Funds\n\nY08-Public Railways Commission: $13,046 from Subfund 4816 Capital Improvement\n\nAppropriations from the general fund on page 429\n\nH03-Commission on Higher Education: Leadership Center Annualization $50,000\n\nH03-Commission on Higher Education: Lottery Scholarship Administration $100,000\n\nAppropriations from the general fund on page 430\n\nF30-Budget and Control Board, Employee Benefits: Non-recurring Employee Benefits Operating Expenses $2,000,000\n\nI am vetoing these items because they improperly strip funds from trust funds or restricted accounts, and transfer them to the general fund for purposes other than their dedicated purposes. While I appreciate the financial difficulty the state is currently experiencing, we should, and I hope we will together in the future, honor commitments previously made to utilize trust funds and restricted accounts for their intended purposes.\n\nAn example of the impropriety of stripping trust funds and restricted accounts for general fund purposes is the Nongame Wildlife and Natural Areas Fund. This fund is comprised of dollars voluntarily donated by South Carolina citizens. Permanent law requires that both principal and earnings from this fund be utilized for conservation purposes, which serves as the inducement for such voluntary donations. We breach our trust with the citizens of South Carolina if we expend these donated funds or their earnings for purposes other than that for which they were donated.\n\nVeto 21 I am vetoing the following distinctly labeled items from Part 1B, Section 73.2, Statewide Funding Requirements, page 430, relating to appropriations of funds that are contingent upon receiving more than $5 million in abandoned property from the demutualization of insurance companies:\n\nA17-Legislative Printing & Information Technology Systems: Licenses $500,000\n\nE28-Election Commission: $700,000 for HAVA Federal Match\n\nF03-Budget and Control Board: $2,000,000 for Operating Expenses\n\nH71-Wil Lou Gray Opportunity School: Operating Expenses $117,657\n\nJ16-Department of Disabilities and Special Needs: Special Olympics $50,000\n\nK05-Department of Public Safety: Operating Expenses $1,000,000\n\nL04-Department of Social Services: $2,300,000 for Operating Expenses for Child and Adult Services\n\nL12-John De La Howe School: Operating Expenses $150,000\n\nN12-Department of Juvenile Justice: $500,000 for Operating Expenses\n\nP24-Department of Natural Resources: Operating Expenses $1,000,000\n\nThe items listed above are important expenditures. The HAVA appropriation, for example, would be utilized to secure a substantial federal match to modernize our voting machines and processes. The Special Olympics is certainly laudable, and the Department of Juvenile Justice is in need of funding to maintain services and address federal court mandates.\n\nThe problem with these items, however, is that they are not really funded. In essence, these appropriations are \"wish list\" spending in contravention of Section 11-11-140 (A) (2) which states, \"In any bill or joint resolution appropriating general fund revenues, no surplus general fund revenue may be appropriated in excess of amounts officially recognized as such by the Board of Economic Advisors.\" Because these items are being funded with demutualization funds in excess of the $5 million the Board of Economic Advisors estimates demutualization will generate, I am vetoing them.\n\nIt is important that the integrity of our budgeting practices and compliance with Section 11-11-140 not be compromised. Items that merit funding should be funded with real dollars, not placed on a \"wish list\". This practice creates unrealistic expectations and avoids the prioritization and hard decisions that are necessary in our current budget environment. In the future I hope that items such as these, because of their merit, will be made priorities and funded as such in Part IA with Board of Economic Advisors certified revenue.\n\nThis inappropriate method of budgeting was once a regular practice, but to the credit of the General Assembly and the budget committees, it has subsided in recent years. We should resist the temptation to fall back into this poor budgetary practice because of the difficult budget situation confronting us. In difficult times it is imperative that we even more vigorously adhere to budgetary discipline rather than abandon it. Let us not head down the path of \"wish list\" spending once again after having come so far. We simply cannot afford to count on money we likely will never have, to fund important items of state government.\n\nVeto 22 I am vetoing the following distinctly labeled item from Part 1B, Section 73.2, Statewide Funding Requirements, page 430, relating to appropriations of funds that are contingent upon receiving more than $5 million in abandoned property from the demutualization of insurance companies:\n\nAny additional revenues realized from demutualization shall be used to fund the State Employee Health Plan.\n\nI am vetoing this item for the same reasons given for Veto 20.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, and pursuant to the authority granted to the Office of the Governor by Article IV, Section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution, I am vetoing the specific sections and items of H.3749, R.127, the fiscal year 2003-04 General Appropriations Act, as indicated.\n\nIn conclusion, a major concern regarding the budget this year is the manner in which the General Assembly rolled up multiple and often unrelated items in single Part 1A lines or Part 1B provisos. In exercising my veto power I have acted within the parameters of Article IV, Section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution and vetoed distinct items or sections. However, as I analyze the budget, at times whether a provision is a distinct item or section as envisioned by Article IV, Section 21 has been blurred.\n\nVetoes 20, 21 and 22 are consistent with Article IV, Section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution, which requires the General Assembly to appropriate money in \"distinct items and sections\", and authorizes the Governor to veto \"items or sections\" in appropriations bills. In Drummond v. Beasley 331 S.C. 559, 503 S.E.2d 455 (1998), the South Carolina Supreme Court construed Article IV, Section 21 and concluded the Governor can veto \"those parts labeled by the legislature as items or sections\" in an appropriations bill. Black's Law Dictionary defines an \"item\" in an appropriation as \"an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose\".\n\nThe items I have vetoed are distinct items for the purposes of Article IV, Section 21 in that they are clearly labeled as distinct and specific funds from which specific sums of money are transferred to the general fund, and the purposes for which these transferred funds are appropriated are likewise distinct and specifically labeled.\n\nI would remind the General Assembly that while my veto power is limited by our Constitution to distinct sections or items, the General Assembly has a constitutional mandate to \"specify the objects and purposes for which [appropriations] are made, and appropriate to them respectively their several amounts in distinct items and sections.\" Article IV, Section 21.\n\nI respect the legislative function and appreciate the hard work that goes into writing a budget. However, I would ask the General Assembly to address this issue next year by passing a budget that is itemized or divided into sections that more explicitly address specific objects and purposes as called for by the Constitution. Such a budget practice is the only way the proper balance between legislative and executive power can be achieved, and the constitutional mandate of Article IV, Section 21 be honored.\n\nForty-three other governors in this nation possess the authority to veto specific sections or items in appropriations bills, and we are heading down a path that severely undermines this authority in South Carolina. We cannot afford to alter this essential component of the balance of powers doctrine that is central to our constitutional form of government.\n\nAn unfortunate consequence of continuing to budget like this will inevitably be the veto of large items or sections that include meritorious provisions, just to address objectionable matters. I do not suspect any of us desire that outcome.\n\nI look forward to working together in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect toward the goal of disciplined budgetary practices and cooperative service to the citizens of South Carolina.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMark Sanford\n\nR. 128, H. 3806--ORDERED PRINTED IN THE JOURNAL\n\nThe SPEAKER ordered the following veto printed in the Journal:\n\nAugust 8, 2003\n\nThe Honorable David H.

The bill proposes to decrease the number of members on the Board of Election and Registration for Union County. As such, H. 4176, R.131, affects only Union County and is, therefore, clearly an act for a specific county. Such acts are in violation of Article VIII, Section 7 of the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, which provides that \"[n]o laws for a specific county shall be enacted.\" Acts similar to H. 4176, R.131 have been struck down by the South Carolina Supreme Court as violative of Article VIII, Section 7.\n\nFor this reason, I am returning H. 4176, R.131 to you without my signature.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Sanford\n\nGovernor\n\nR. 158, H. 3254--ORDERED PRINTED IN THE JOURNAL\n\nThe SPEAKER ordered the following veto printed in the Journal:\n\nAugust 8, 2003\n\nThe Honorable David H.

Wilkins\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives\n\nState House\n\nPost Office Box 11867\n\nColumbia, South Carolina 29211\n\nMr. Speaker and Members of the House:\n\nI am hereby returning without my approval H. 3470 (Word version), R.170, an Act:\n\nTO PROVIDE THAT BEGINNING WITH SCHOOL YEAR 2003-2004, THE STARTING DATE AND ENDING DATE FOR THE ANNUAL SCHOOL TERM OF SALUDA SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE MUST BE SET BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE DISTRICT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, PROVIDED THAT THE ANNUAL SCHOOL TERM MUST COMPLY WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 59-1-420 RELATING TO LENGTH OF THE SCHOOL TERM.\n\nThis bill is special legislation that would allow Saluda School District One to set its calendar for the 2003-2004 school year. The purpose of this bill has been accomplished by a general law, H. 3361, R.163, which gives all local school boards the authority to establish an annual school calendar.

Wilkins\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives\n\nState House\n\nPost Office Box 11867\n\nColumbia, South Carolina 29211\n\nMr. Speaker and Members of the House:\n\nI am hereby returning without my approval H. 3941 (Word version), R.175 a Joint Resolution:\n\nTO POSTPONE UNTIL PROPERTY TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER 2003 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVISED VALUES DETERMINED IN THE COUNTYWIDE APPRAISAL AND EQUALIZATION PROGRAM CONDUCTED IN COLLETON COUNTY IN 2001.\n\nThis Joint Resolution is special legislation that would give Colleton County the authority to postpone implementation of the revised values determined in its 2001 countywide appraisal and equalization program. The purpose of this Joint Resolution has been accomplished by general law, Act 69, S. 274, R.138, which gives all counties the authority to postpone implementation of reassessment program values for an additional property tax year. I signed S. 274, R.138 into law on June 18, 2003. Accordingly, H. 3941, R.175 is not necessary.\n\nThis veto is also based on my belief that H. 3941, R.175 is unconstitutional. Since this Joint Resolution affects only Colleton County, it violates Article VIII, Section 7 of the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, which provides that \"[n]o laws for a specific county shall be enacted.\"\n\nFor these reasons, I am returning H. 3941, R.175 to you without my signature.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Sanford\n\nGovernor\n\nR. 178, H. 4269--ORDERED PRINTED IN THE JOURNAL\n\nThe SPEAKER ordered the following veto printed in the Journal:\n\nAugust 8, 2003\n\nThe Honorable David H.

Wilkins\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives\n\nState House\n\nPost Office Box 11867\n\nColumbia, South Carolina 29211\n\nMr. Speaker and Members of the House:\n\nI am hereby returning without my approval H. 3052 (Word version), R.154. This veto is based upon my belief that Section 9 of this bill is unduly burdensome and imposes unnecessary regulatory restrictions on a specific group of small businesses in South Carolina.\n\nThis bill mandates that nonfranchise automobile dealers complete at least eight hours of prelicensing education courses before they may be issued a license to sell automobiles. These prelicensing requirements do not apply to franchise automobile dealers. I believe government regulations must protect its citizens in a manner that is not unfairly and unduly burdensome to any private industry, including small businesses. This bill unfairly requires mandatory educational training of certain small business licensees when other similar businesses are free from such government regulation. More importantly, prelicensing requirements of this nature are effectively a barrier to entry for a particular group of automobile dealers in the State's automobile sales industry. The State can protect automobile consumers in a less restrictive manner.\n\nAlthough I do not object to the remaining sections of H. 3052, R.154, the South Carolina Constitution prevents me from vetoing specific objectionable provisions of this bill. Also, Sections 3 through 8 of this bill were adopted in S. 495, R.143, Act 71 and signed by me on June 25, 2003.\n\nFor these reasons, I am returning H. 3052, R.154 to you without my signature.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Sanford\n\nGovernor\n\nINVITATIONS\n\nOn motion of Rep.
