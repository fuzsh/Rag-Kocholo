        "text": "If you want a truly relaxing holiday, you can take advantage of the new Spa of Casteldoria , where you can enjoy massages, mud treatments and thermal baths, only a few kilometers from Valledoria.\n\nSardinia is an ancient land that boasts various thermal and mineral springs: located in Santa Maria Coghinas, the baths of Casteldoria are but one example.\n\nKnown since ancient times for their waters rich in bromine and iodine that flow at 70° in a porphyritic gorge , the baths are set in a beautiful surrounding, a few kilometers from Valledoria. Their waters flow from the Coghinas river, which helps to create a small microclimate.\n\nThe mud baths and hot waters can be found directly in the river bed, close to the river’s mouth. Their origins make them quite unique: they are endogenic occurrences deriving from volcanic activity, now spent.\n\nThese waters form at about 2000-3000 meters deep into the ground, and then they make their way to the surface. Along this journey they are enriched by minerals that have incredible beneficial properties: antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and decongestant.\n\nIn their proximity you can also visit the ruins of the Doria Castle, founded in the 12th century and located on a hill 228 meters high. Along the way you will meet two small Romanesque churches, that of St. John , in excellent conditions, and that of S. Maria delle Grazie , with its well-preserved Gothic facade."
