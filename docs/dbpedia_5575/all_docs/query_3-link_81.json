        "text": "I contacted Mauro to arrange a self guided bike trip. I had an excellent e-bike and my husband loved the road bike provided for us. The planning was made easy by BTS staff whom made excellent suggestions and answered all my questions by email efficiently and quickly. His hotel choice was good to exceptional – especially our first hotel – Villa Mosca – in Alghero! Each day our\n\nluggage was transferred and in our room at our next destination before we were there!\n\nI wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Mauro and Bike Tour Sardinia to anyone. We’ve done several other tours with other companies and this was definitely the best one yet! We would like to return to Sardinia one day! Stunningly beautiful island, wonderful friendly people, and excellent food and wine!\n\nBeautiful landscape, unique boutique hotels, great food and wonderful biking, basically describes our experience with Bike Tour Sardinia. We went from Alghero to Oristano, exploring the medieval towns and coast. Mauro arranged a relatively seamless and fabulous self-guided adventure, being consistently available, helpful and responsive. We had both e-bikes and standard, but for me, the e-bike added ease and the ability for further exploration and smiles. I highly recommend Bike Tour Sardinia as a way to explore this beautiful island."
