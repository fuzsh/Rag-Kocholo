        "text": "On request, staff at the Pausania Inn can organise transfers and assist you closely in booking boat trips and excursions in Northern Sardinia.\n\nHere are some activities particularly appreciated and suggested by our staff:\n\nÂ\n\nâ¢ Visit to Tempio Pausania, a charming and characteristic town, which has always been the cradle of Gallura culture. The historic centre of Tempio Pausania is made up of exposed granite buildings, often adorned with wrought iron balconies. The streets are paved and there are numerous unmissable views: the Cathedral of San Pietro, the Oratory of the Rosary and the Church of Santa Croce; the house of Nino Visconti, the last judge of the Giudicato di Gallura, quoted by Dante in the VIII song of Purgatory; via Mannu, known as “via dei nobili” since the past because it housed the Spanish nobility; the Teatro del Carmine (1929) and the adjacent cloister of the Piarists (1650). In Via Roma, a short distance from the cathedral, admire the cork creations of the designer Anna Grindi, who in 1999 patented the “Suberis” fabric.\n\nVisit the old train station from the 1930s, with the waiting room adorned with paintings by Giuseppe Biasi. We recommend a walk to the Fonte Nuova path, from where, through the San Lorenzo pinewood, you will arrive at the Fonti di Rinaggiu.\n\nâ¢ Visit to the archaeological site of Nuraghe Majori, 500 metres from the hotel.\n\nâ¢ Excursion on Monte Limbara, with the possibility of trekking or Nordic walking: magical encounter between wellness, fitness and nature.\n\nâ¢ Excursion to the Valley of the Moon to admire its natural granite sculptures.\n\nâ¢ Excursion by boat to Lago Liscia, with a visit to the millenary olive trees.\n\nâ¢ Excursion on the Coghinas River (possibility of practicing birdwatching).\n\nâ¢ Full day at the La Maddalena Archipelago, with a visit to the islands of Spargi, Budelli, Santa Maria and Caprera and, on request, the possibility of booking lunch on the boat.\n\nâ¢ Wine and food tours at the Piero Mancini vineyards (Olbia), a 40-minute drive from the hotel.\n\nâ¢ Excursion on board the Trenino Verde, which from Tempio leads, through a breathtaking route, to some wonderful destinations in Northern Sardinia.\n\nâ¢ Day at the water park Aquafantasy (Isola Rossa), 30 minutes’ drive from the hotel.\n\nâ¢ A few hours at Terme di Casteldoria (S. Maria Coghinas), 40 minutes’ drive from the hotel, for a relaxation or physical wellbeing treatment.\n\nâ¢ Excursion to Tavolara Island, departing from Porto San Paolo, about 60 minutes’ drive from the hotel."
