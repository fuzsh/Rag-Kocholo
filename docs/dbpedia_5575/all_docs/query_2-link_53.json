        "text": "At the beginning of the new millennium, the bishops of the ancient city of Sulci (today Sant’Antioco), threatened by Saracen raids, found shelter in the backcountry, a few kilometers from the southwestern coast of the Sulcis region.\n\nIn this village, in around 1213, they built the church of Santa Maria to become the new cathedral of the diocese and the reference for all the faithful of the area.\n\nThis church, entitled to the cult of the Virgin Mary of Monserrat, with its beautiful Romanesque lines, stands out imposingly even today among the small houses of the ancient village of Tratalìas, now abandoned.\n\nThe Virgin of Montserrat (or Our Lady of Montserrat), Patroness of Catalonia, is a statue of a black Madonna venerated in a monastery on the Montserrat Mountain, in Catalonia.\n\nAccording to an ancient Iberian tradition, during the Catalan-Aragonese period, the worship of the Virgin Mary of Montserrat was brought to this area and never faded since.\n\nIt endured even when the Sulcitan bishops decided to leave this village, which had become unsafe since the 14th century, to move to the fortified city of Villa Di Chiesa (today Iglesias) and, consequently, this church was no longer a cathedral.\n\nThe venerated Marian simulacrum that was kept in Tratalìas was then taken to the unassailable medieval city but, in order not to lose the link with the ancient village, once a year, at least from the 15th century, the statue of the Virgin from Iglesias returns to her old church, escorted by the devout people in an evocative procession to celebrate a ritual feast.\n\nSurviving from the original layout of this picturesque settlement are a small number of houses, which have today been restructured.\n\nThis former cathedral, made of local stone, has a façade with two rows of Lombard bands, two lozenges and a polylobed rose window.\n\nThe building is softened by decorative motifs in the shape of a curved leaf that recur in its most salient features: on the façade, for example, they adorn the arch that surmounts the entrance portal and they surround the rose window, while they embellish the numerous shelves supporting the blind arcades along the entire building rest.\n\nThe façade stands as a unicum in the island's Romanesque architectural landscape due to the floating staircase that reaches the roofs from an opening in the tympanum.\n\nThe side portals are also remarkable, in particular the one positioned to the north, which has the architrave decorated with two lions in relief, placed frontally.\n\nThe interior has a rectangular plan with a nave and two aisles, with round arches set on pillars and ends in a semi-circular apse.\n\nThe roof consists in wooden trusses.\n\nThe local school retable, kept in this church since 1596, also speaks of this profound Marian faith of the inhabitants of Sulcis.\n\nThe pictorial compartments of this work are composed around the central theme of the Madonna enthroned, framed on the sides by the figures of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, while at the bottom stands Saint Antiochus of Sulcis, Patron Saint of the diocese of Iglesias."
