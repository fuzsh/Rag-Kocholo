The beauty of the place is enhanced by lush bush and the imposing rocky mountains. Our adventure starts here, among the thermal spring!\n\nWe then start the descent, leaving behind the thermal springs, here the river begins to take on an uneven trend, serpenteggiante alternating small rapid and modest enlargements. Around us the vegetation is lush and unspoiled: dominate large trees of Eucalyptus and 'water tamarisk' trees that seem to want to capture us!\n\nWe move along the river where spectral abandoned bridges and quarries are now the only anthropization signal. The Coghinas River takes about 15 kilometers from the thermal area of Santa Maria di Coghinas to the Gulf of Asinara where it emerge into the sea. It will be extremely easy to meet trout and carp under our kayaks while around us pelicans, hawks, ducks and many other species make unforgettable the day!"
