        "text": "Does this cover look familiar? This is the cover of The Queen-Seekers (2000); book 1 of the Finn's Quest series by Eirlys Hunter. It appears to be a first-person view through a rocky tunnel, apparently a dungeon, with torches and the hand of the viewpoint character in the foreground holding a staff or wand.\n\nThe main character, Finn, starts to play a computer game called \"The Ultimate Adventure\" and ends up sucked into the computer world where he is sent on a quest in a land called \"Coralia.\"\n\nThe back cover blurb reads:\n\nFinn's life takes on an unreal twist when he finds himself actually in a computer game world. It's a world at war, a world of magic and evil, in which someone wants Finn dead. With Gala, a girl who's addicted to risk-taking, he begins his dangerous but exciting journey through a land where all the rules are different.\n\nThe \"game\" can definitely have effects in the real-world; in the second book, Coldkeep Castle (2001) his father is kidnapped into the game and Finn must re-enter the game to rescue him.\n\nTime definitely passed much faster in the game world; the third book The Slave-Stealers (2004) takes place a few weeks/months later in the real world, but 4 years have passed in the game world.\n\nI've found a higher-resolution image of the 2nd book's cover; you can definitely see that it appears to be computer-rendered image. (Complete with a highly-unrealistic hand holding a staff.)\n\nI think that you might be looking for Eden's Gate\n\nAlthough I have not read this title, the cover matches closely to your description.\n\nHere is the synopsis from Amazon:\n\nWhen Gunnar Long is transported into the first fully-immersive virtual MMORPG, he finds himself in a new world filled with magic, mystery and adventure.\n\nNo more 9-to-5 job. No more studio apartment. No more reality TV.\n\nFinally, he's in a place where he can call home, a place with people he can call friends.\n\nBut as more people want to trade their real world lives to get inside Eden's Gate, the government of the outside world wants the \"game\" shut down at all costs.\n\nGunnar must learn to survive, grow in power and find a way to send a message back to his old home.\n\n\"We're fine. We're alive. Eden's Gate is real.\""
