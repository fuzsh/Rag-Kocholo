        "text": "Writing a contemporary reimagining of the Peter Pan lore, especially as a family drama/thriller, and making the result be successfully compelling instead of a cheesy rip on beloved characters, sounds daunting, at best. Like, ridiculously difficult to pull off. And yet Liz Michalski’s Darling Girl is a perfect spin on the fantasy.\n\nI was instantly hooked (hah) (sorry) by the story in my May Book of the Month pick from the jump, and considerably impressed by all the nightmarish twists and turns it goes on to take. As it turns out, Peter Pan took the same “evil scumbag who refuses to grow up” path as a few of my exes. (If only they’d inspired me to write an excellent page-turner instead of deranged Tumblr poetry.)\n\nThe plot, courtesy of the publisher:\n\n“Life is looking up for Holly Darling, granddaughter of Wendy — yes, that Wendy. She's running a successful skincare company; her son, Jack, is happy and healthy; and the tragedy of her past is well behind her . . . until she gets a call that her daughter, Eden, who has been in a coma for nearly a decade, has gone missing from the estate where she's been long tucked away. And, worst of all, Holly knows who must be responsible: Peter Pan, who is not only very real, but more dangerous than anyone could imagine.\n\nEden's disappearance is a disaster for more reasons than one. She has a rare condition that causes her to age rapidly — ironic, considering her father is the boy who will never grow up — which also makes her blood incredibly valuable. It's a secret that Holly is desperate to protect, especially from Eden's half-brother, Jack, who knows nothing about his sister or the crucial role she plays in his life. Holly has no one to turn to — her mother is the only other person in the world who knows that Peter is more than a story, but she refuses to accept that he is not the hero she's always imagined. Desperate, Holly enlists the help of Christopher Cooke, a notorious ex-soldier, in the hopes of rescuing Eden before it's too late . . . or she may lose both her children.”\n\nSo, yes: there’s a *lot* going on here.\n\nHolly is a generation removed from Wendy, and the truth of her grandmother’s history with Peter Pan and co. has been shielded from her for years due to her own mother’s devotion to The Boy Who Would Never Grow Up. For Holly’s mother, Jane, the tale woven by J.M. Barrie was simply too good — how could such a dreamy possibility be a lie? She never wanted to acknowledge some uncomfortable facts about Pan, and that incuriosity (or simply her inability to fully open her eyes) led to future heartache for her own daughter.\n\nAlthough most families don’t have a real-life connection to a fantastical literary hero, the concept of a parent hiding things from their kids in order to “protect” them (or in order not to face something they’re scared of themselves) isn’t so alien a concept. Three generations of women are anchored by their painful interactions with one man (“boy”) in Darling Girl, and without revealing too much about the plot, another soon enters the fray — what will it take for a parent to finally put a stop to this cycle of trauma?\n\nThis book is well-crafted, but I was still practically frothing at the mouth for more details. [NOTE: SPOILERS TO FOLLOW.] Like: How the HELL does Neverland work? Is it actually a different realm, or another state of being? Was Peter Pan aging the whole time in London, or did he still present as a young boy when he appeared in Holly’s window after her family’s tragic passing? (If it was the latter, that opens a whole can of worms regarding the nature of their tryst. Y I K E S.) Why was Holly seemingly so chill about the idea of her daughter vanishing into another world for all eternity, after only just getting her back? Especially with her mom! (Although side-note: excellent fake-out regarding Jane, there. Raise your hand if you thought she was going to turn out to be evil.) And Liz Michalski, girl, you’re really not going to give us anything else about THEE Captain Hook? Come on, now.\n\nThat being said, while I wasn't entirely satisfied by the ending, which felt rushed, I admit I can see why certain choices were made vs. bringing the story somewhere else entirely (physically, at least). Overall I loved this very good, very dark twist on a classic."
