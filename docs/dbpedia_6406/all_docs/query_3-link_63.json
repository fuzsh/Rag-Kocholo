        "text": "It has roughly been almost two years since Subaru was transported to another world, and roughly around six months since his return from Vollachia. He had made a name for himself back in Lugunica through his deeds, and he even contracted a spirit. But all of this would change when he shall suddenly be transported to another world once again. This time, with Beatrice by his side.\n\nRWBY is owned by Roosterteeth (not anymore, old me!), while Re:Zero by Kadokawa and written by Tappei Nagatsuki.\n\nAuthor's Note:\n\n- This is a very old and discontinued fanfic of mine that I wrote back in 2021 when I was still very active in Wattpad, and then some more in early 2023 (don't worry, the end of this fanfic will have a \"What could've been\" section that would note down everything I remembered in how I planned this fanfic to end). Expect some inaccuracies and all from the rezero side of things because of it. As for inaccuracy of events in the RWBY side of things, there will be a notes chapter at the end of this fanfic.\n\nP.S: Support my original story here in Webnovel! Some of its significant aspects are inspired by Re:Zero and RWBY, but it is also entirely original!"
