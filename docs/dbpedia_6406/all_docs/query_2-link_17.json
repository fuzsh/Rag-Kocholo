        "text": "Citation preview\n\nA Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library\n\nDANGEROUS MEN and ADVENTUROUS WOMEN ROMANCE WRITERS ON THE APPEAL OF THE ROMANCE Edited by Jayne Ann Krentz In Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women, Jayne Ann Krentz and the contributors to this volume—all best-selling romance novelists— explode the myths and biases that haunt both the writers and readers of romances. In this seamless, ultimately fascinating, and controversial book, the authors dispute some of the notions that plague their profession, including the time-worn theory that the romance genre contains only one single, monolithic story, which is cranked out over and over again. The authors also discuss positive, life-affirming values inherent in all romances: the celebration of female power, courage, intelligence, and gentleness; the inversion of the power structure of a patriarchal society; and the integration of male and female. Several of the essays also discuss the issue of reader identification with the characters, a relationship that is far more complex than most critics realize. Romances are, to some extent, written in a code that carries allusions to ancient myths as well as to classic and contemporary romances. Critics and readers who frequently dismiss romances as poorly written or unimagjnative simply do not understand the encoded information in the text. Even the essays in this volume are, to some extent, locked in code. Thoughtful readers of the essays will have to abandon some of the conventional critical assumptions in favor of other perspectives if they wish to comprehend much of what is said here about the nature of the appeal of the romance novel.\n\n\"Some of the writers collected here have read virtually all of the significant books on romance that have appeared in the last ten years or so, evaluated the claims made by their feminist authors in highly critical fashion and yet insisted on claiming the term 'feminist' for their own literary efforts. This, in itself, is a highly useful piece of information for it demonstrates that romances cannot simply be labelled reactionary anti-feminism, as some critics have claimed, but rather must be evaluated as part of a larger cultural struggle over the proper way to define feminism and to control its impact on the lives of individual women. . . . This book will interest feminist literary and media critics as primary source material for their efforts to understand the impact of the romance genre. . . . It demonstrates eloquently that thinking about the contemporary state of culture goes on beyond the ivory tower and that it is cohesive and compelling\"—Janice Radway.

This book was born out of a host of conversations that took place over the years among members of the romance writing community. Many of the women involved in these discussions have essays in this volume, but I wish also to acknowledge the benefit of insights I have garnered from other friends in the sisterhood including Linda Lael Miller, Debbie Macomber, Margaret Chittenden, and Katherine Stone. In addition, I want to thank Janice Radway and Kay Mussell, whose distinguished work on the romance has opened doors, for their generous encouragement and support of this project. A very special thanks goes to my agent Steven Axelrod for his professional support and encouragement. His advice has been invaluable over the years. All of us who write romance are indebted to our spiritual foremothers, the countless generations of storytelling women who preceded us. We are part of an unbroken female line dedicated to passing on an ancient tradition of literature written by women for women.\n\n]ayne Ann Krentz\n\nIntroduction\n\nFew people realize how much courage it takes for a woman to open a romance novel on an airplane. She knows what everyone around her will think about both her and her choice of reading material. When it comes to romance novels, society has always felt free to sit in judgment not only on the literature but on the reader herself. The verdict is always the same. Society does not approve of the reading of romance novels. It labels the books as trash and the readers as unintelligent, uneducated, unsophisticated, or neurotic. The fact that so many women persist in reading and enjoying romance novels in the face of generations of relentless hostility says something profound not only about women's courage but about the appeal of the books. No one who reads or writes romance expects to be able to teach critics to appreciate the novels. As any romance reader or writer will tell you, a reader either enjoys the novels or she does not. If she does, no further explanations of the appeal of the books are necessary. The same is true of the other genres. A reader who does not intuitively respond to horror or science fiction novels cannot be persuaded by logic or argument to enjoy either genre. The difference is that the person who does not like to read horror or science fiction is unlikely to criticize the genres or chastise and condemn the readers who do love them but simply shrugs and accepts the fact that the stories hold no personal appeal.\n\nJayne Ann Krentz 2 The most popular genres of fiction are based on fantasies, creations of the imagination which are not intended to conform to real life. Robert Ludlum plots many of his books around bizarre conspiracies. His heroes escape from situations in which, in real life, escape would be extremely unlikely. Stephen King presents us with pets that come back from the dead and little girls who can use mental powers to send buildings up in flames. Anne McCaffrey creates flying dragons. Robert Parker and Dick Francis invent heroes who work outside the normal structure of the law enforcement system to solve murders on their own. Most people understand and accept the way in which fantasy works when they sit down to read Ludlum, King, McCaffrey or the others. Furthermore everyone understands that the readers know the difference between real life and fantasy and that they do not expect one to imitate the other. But, for some reason, when it comes to romance novels critics worry about whether the women who read them can tell the difference between what is real and what is not. Of course the readers can tell the difference. They do not expect the imaginative creations of romance to conform to real life any more than they expect the fantasies of any other genre to conform to the real world. Like all the other genres, romance is based on fantasies and readers know it. Readers and writers alike get disgusted with critics who express concern that they may not be able to step back out of the fantasy. They do not appreciate being treated as if they were children who don't know where one stops and the other begins. The contributors to this collection of essays did not set out to provide a set of closely reasoned arguments in defense of the romance novel. What the writers in this volume have tried to do is explain to those who do not understand the appeal of the books that this appeal is as complex as it is powerful. They have tried to show that the criteria used to evaluate \"literary\" fiction are inadequate either to identify what readers find so satisfying about romance or to distinguish, as readers clearly do, between good romance and bad. The writers included in this collection represent a cross section of the genre. Some of them write the short, contemporary\n\nIntroduction 3 series romances such as those published by Harlequin and Silhouette. Others write single-title releases, historical and contemporary. They are all proven successes as romance novelists. Each has several published books to her credit. Individual print-runs range from over a hundred thousand to over a million. Most of the writers in this volume have been given awards by their peers, fans, and booksellers. Most have appeared on the Waldenbooks, Barnes and Noble, and B. Dalton bestseller lists. Several appear routinely on the New York Times and Washington Post bestseller lists. In addition to representing a wide spectrum of the romance market, the writers also represent a cross section of the nation. They hail from both coasts, the South, and the Midwest. There are also two contributors from New Zealand. All the contributors, like the vast majority of romance readers, are women. Most are involved in long term marriages; many have children. Before pursuing their writing careers they were employed in a variety of fields including business, law, journalism, engineering, and education. Their experiences have made them well aware of such things as glass ceilings and old boy networks. Most consider themselves feminists, although they recognize that their definition of feminism may not coincide with that of all feminists. It is interesting to note that many of the contributors discovered romance novels in college or shortly after entering the work force, at a time when they were becoming fully aware of the battles they would face as women for the rest of their lives. It is also interesting to note that none of them saw any conflict between their choice of fiction and the real world in which they lived. They did not feel threatened by the romance novels they were reading. They did not consider them politically incorrect. They feel the same way about the romance novels they create today. With few exceptions, the women who write romance were romance readers first. They had already discovered that they enjoyed the novels before they tried to write them. Most writers in the romance genre are quick to tell you that you can't write romance successfully if you don't love to read it. It is a genre that requires absolute sincerity. Writers who \"drop into\" the field with the intention of churning out a few quick books in order to make\n\nJayne Ann Krentz 4 some fast money rarely last long, if they manage to get published at all. If they are successful in selling a manuscript or two, the resulting books are never the ones that prove most popular with the readers. One of the reasons it is extremely difficult to write in the genre unless you do love it is that, as Seidel notes in her essay, a writer is more or less doomed to write certain kinds of books. In romance the success of an individual author is not based on how well she writes by conventional standards, but on how compellingly she can create her fantasy and on how many readers discover they can step into it with her for a couple of hours. This is equally true for the writers in other genres. Successful authors become successful not because of their conventional writing skills but because of how accessible they make their fantasies. Romance writers are very much in touch with their readers, partly because they are readers themselves, but also because in this genre readers tend to communicate with writers. Readers write fan letters and they meet with the writers at conferences. Of course they also make known their preferences every time they make a purchase in a bookstore. Nevertheless, nearly every successful romance writer will tell you that she does not, indeed could not, write for the readers. Romance writers, like all writers, must recreate their own vividly imagined fantasies first and then hope and pray that there will be a large number of readers who will also enjoy that particular fantasy. That is the basic reason why there is no \"formula\"1 for romance writing. The books that are constructed \"by the numbers\" never work well in romance, just as they don't work in other genres. They lack the subtext that makes a romance novel come alive. The essays in this volume are as diverse as the writers who contributed them. They represent a variety of viewpoints as well as the individual voices and styles the authors bring to their novels. And there is great variety within the romance genre. It is a serious mistake to assume that all the books are alike. The notion that the romance genre contains only one single, monolithic story that is cranked out over and over again should be dispelled after an examination of this volume. Anyone who knows anything at all about the creative process will understand that no\n\nIntroduction\n\n5 two of the writers in this book could possibly fashion exactly the same story, even if they deliberately tried to do so. Each essay in this volume reflects the unique view of the writer who wrote it. The writers developed their theories on the appeal of the novel independently and reached their own conclusions. But as the essays began arriving on the editor's desk, several unifying themes emerged. First and foremost among these themes is an exasperated declaration that the romance novel is based on fantasies and that the readers are no more confused about this fact, nor any more likely to use their reading as a substitute for action in the real world, than readers of Ludlum, Parker, Francis, and McCaffrey. The second, equally strong theme that emerges from the essays is that of female empowerment. Readers understand that the books celebrate female power. In the romance novel, as Phillips, Clair, and several others point out, the woman always wins. With courage, intelligence, and gentleness she brings the most dangerous creature on earth, the human male, to his knees. More than that, she forces him to acknowledge her power as a woman. A third theme, one related to empowerment, is that of the inherently subversive nature of the romance novel. Romance novels invert the power structure of a patriarchal society because they show women exerting enormous power over men. The books also defy the masculine conventions of other forms of literature because they portray women as heroes. As Cameron and others explain, the romance novel is the only genre in which readers can routinely expect to encounter heroines who are imbued with the qualities normally reserved for the heroes in other genres: honor, courage, and determination. As Williamson notes, the hero falls in love with the heroine because he sees something of himself in her—he sees the hero in her. It works the other way, as well. The heroine will not accept the hero completely until she has seen some evidence of her own gentleness and compassion in him. This business of hero and heroine reflecting each other's strongest and most admirable traits is an important element in the romance novel. The subversive nature of the books is fundamental and inescapable. Romances are, after all, stories that have been told to\n\nJayne Ann Krentz 6 women by women for generations. The language of the books, so often ridiculed by critics, is essential to the novels because it is a coded language. As the Barlow and Krentz essay notes, the novels are full of allusions and resonances that are unrecognizable to outsiders. A fourth theme in the essays is that of the integration of male and female. Some writers, such as Barlow and Kinsale, believe that this integration has nothing to do with real men at all. They feel that it is an integration, exploration, and celebration of the masculine elements every woman has deep within herself. Other writers see this integration as an event which occurs within the hero and which is brought about by the power of the heroine. In effect, these writers say, the heroine of a romance novel civilizes the hero by teaching him to combine his warrior qualities with the protective, nurturing aspects of his nature. It should be understood that romance novels are not tales of women turning men into women. Nor are they female revenge fantasies, as some critics have suggested. They are not castration fantasies. It is true that the heroes in the books undergo a significant change in the course of the story, often being tamed or gentled or taught to love, but they do not lose any of their masculine strength in the process. The stories make it clear that women value the warrior qualities in men as well as their protective, nurturing qualities. The trick is to teach the hero to integrate and control the two warring halves of himself so that he can function as a reliable mate and as a father. The journey of the novel, many writers say, is the civilization of the male. The fifth theme easily identified in the essays is a belief that romance novels celebrate life. There is a deep-rooted optimism inherent in the romance novel that crosses cultural and political boundaries. The books, as Linz documents, are as successful among women readers in Japan, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia as they are in North America. Margaret Chittenden, author of several romance novels published by Harlequin Enterprises, tells of meeting two hundred and fifty Japanese women in Tokyo a few years ago. They were all regular readers of the romances published by Ms. Chittenden's publisher. Many of the women talked to her\n\nIntroduction 7 about their enjoyment of the books. Harlequin had changed the face of romance writing in Japan, they said. Historically, they explained, love stories in their country ended in tragedy. \"Everybody dies,\" one woman murmured. To demonstrate to Ms. Chittenden how much they appreciated the difference Harlequin had made, one woman who could not speak much English came up to her and took her by the hand. \"Happy ever after, yes?\" she said. The celebration of life is expressed also in the frequency with which happy endings include the birth of a child. Babies are always treated as a cause for joy in romance, whether a writer has chosen to have children or not, whether she is in favor of abortion rights or not. The fantasies in the books have nothing to do with a woman's politics. Even the most casual survey of the readers will reveal fundamentalists, atheists, conservatives, moderates, and liberals among them. But they all respond to romance tales that celebrate the male-female bond that will bring forth new life. Another theme that is present in the essays has to do with reader identification. One of the first things that must be understood about romance novels is that reader identification with the characters is far more complex than critics have realized. Sometimes the reader identifies with the heroine; sometimes, as Kinsale points out in her essay, the heroine functions simply as a placeholder; and sometimes the reader identifies with the hero. The latter should not come as a surprise. Writers freely explain that when they write the novels they identify with their heroes at least as much as they do with their heroines. It is certainly true that both reader and writer slip easily in and out of the skins of the two main characters as the romance progresses. There are also occasions in the books when the reader identifies with both hero and heroine simultaneously. This simultaneous identification is very common during love scenes. Seductions in well-written romance novels are especially powerful because the reader experiences them as both seducer and seduced. Such a phenomenon is difficult to illustrate using the standard language of literary analysis, but it is an extremely compelling form of writing. Duality is central to another theme that emerges from the\n\nJayne Ann Krentz 8 essays in this volume. Some writers, myself included, believe that a sense of danger, of risk, is created in the books by the fact that the hero plays two roles: he is both hero and villain. The challenge the heroine faces is unique to romance fiction. She must find a way to conquer the villain without destroying the hero. Such a task is far more complex than that faced by the protagonists of westerns and mysteries. For those who understand the encoded information in the stories, the books preserve elements of ancient myths and legends that are particularly important to women. They celebrate female power, intuition, and a female worldview that affirms life and expresses hope for the future. Critics and readers who fail to comprehend the complexity and subtlety of the genre frequently dismiss the books as poorly written or unimaginative, when the simple truth is that they just don't understand the encoded information in the text. Even the essays in this volume are, to some extent, locked in code. The problem was inevitable due to the inherent difficulty of explaining any type of fantasy experience to those who do not grasp it intuitively. Thoughtful readers of the essays will have to abandon some of the conventional critical assumptions in favor of other perspectives if they wish to comprehend much of what is said here about the nature of the appeal of the romance novel. A brief biography of each author appears at the end of her first contribution to this volume. NOTE 1. I am using the term \"formula\" in the sense in which it is used routinely in the media and in the publishing world.\n\nJayne Ann Krentz (Amanda Quick, ]ayne Castle, Stephanie James) Under a variety of pseudonyms Jayne Ann Krentz has written and published more than fifty series romances for several publishers including Harlequin, Silhouette, and Dell. Many of these series\n\nIntroduction\n\nromances have appeared on the Waldenbooks Romance bestseller list, including The Private Eye, which reached the number one position on the list. Currently she writes contemporary romances for Pocket Books under her own name and historical romances for Bantam under the pen name Amanda Quick. Her books appear consistently on the Waldenbooks and B. Dalton bestseller lists. Several of her contemporary and historical titles, including Scandal, Rendezvous, and Sweet Fortune, appeared on the New York Times list. Two of her recent titles, Scandal and Ravished, were featured as alternate selections in the Doubleday Bookclub. Ms. Krentz has a degree in history from the University of California at Santa Cruz and a master's degree in library science. Before pursuing her writing career she worked in academic and corporate libraries.\n\nCathie Linz\n\nSetting the Stage FactsandFigures\n\nAccording to a variety of sources, romances account for a staggering 35 to 40 percent of all mass market paperback sales. The world's largest publisher of romances, Harlequin Enterprises, has reported annual sales of over 190 million books worldwide. These books are translated into over twenty languages, including Japanese, Greek, and Swedish. They are published in over 100 international markets: from North and South America, to the Far East, to Western Europe and—starting in the summer of 1990—Eastern Europe as well, with the distribution of the books in Hungary. Further expansion into Eastern Europe is planned.1 All of this suggests that the underlying appeal of romance novels is universal in nature, crossing cultural and political boundaries. Harlequin has opened the door and proved that the readership is there. The market seems to be an expanding one, a global community of romance readers. Romance novels can be broken down into two broad categories: historical romances, which utilize a wide variety of historical backdrops, and contemporary romances. The distinction is important because the temporal settings have a strong influence on plot lines and the type of fantasy that is found in the books. These two basic categories are then broken down into more specific subcategories. For example, Regency romances, set against the backdrop of Regency England, are a sub-genre of\n\nCathie Linz 12 historical romances. Medieval romances are another popular subgenre of historical romances. Series romances such as those published by Harlequin/Silhouette are a sub-genre of contemporary romances. Romance novels run the gamut in style from the gentle and humorous to the intense and dramatic. They also vary greatly in levels of sensuality and in the amount of realistic elements incorporated in the plot lines. The tone of the fantasy in the books ranges across the spectrum from light to dark. Therefore, saying all romances are the same is like saying all buildings are the same. To someone with an untrained eye, this may appear to be true, but an architect can tell the difference between a Louis Sullivan design and a Mies van der Rohe. So, too, can romance readers and writers tell the differences among the many types of romances available in the marketplace today. Readers have strong preferences not only for specific subgenres but also for specific authors. Based on the number of used bookstores that routinely fill highly specific requests from romance readers around the globe, one can assume this selective approach to reading in the genre is a worldwide phenomenon. With the increasing presence of American writers on the scene in the past decade, the marketplace has opened up to all kinds of romance novel hybrids: time-travel love stories, science fiction/fantasy romances, romantic suspense, western romances. It should be noted that romance writers have expanded the field without abandoning the genre's roots. The basic expectations of the readers are still being fulfilled. Demographic information on romance readers is hard to come by, as it would be for any group of readers. Harlequin Enterprises has done market research2 on its North American readers and compiled the following statistical information: Approximately 70 percent of the readers are women under 49 years of age. 45 percent of them have attended college. The number of readers currently involved in a relationship with a man is 79 percent. Two-thirds own their own home. Over half, 51 percent of them, work outside the home. 68 percent of romance readers read a newspaper every or nearly every day, a figure that is higher\n\nSetting the Stage 13 than the national average. 71 percent purchase romance novels at least once a month. Romance readers are linked by their interest in the genre. They love to talk to each other about their favorite romance titles and authors. They exchange books and opinions and make recommendations wherever they meet—at bookstores and conferences and at the office. Readers also use their computers and their modems to access nationwide networking systems so that they can communicate about the books with sister readers across the country. One such commercial networking system has so many members and so much activity that it presently has over a dozen subheadings under the topic of romance fiction. Members of the system go on-line regularly to \"talk books\" via computer, sharing their excitement in the wonderful variety of books available to them in the romance genre. In the final analysis the numbers cited in this essay speak for themselves, establishing the fact that the appeal of romance is enormous and cross-cultural. The essays that follow will attempt to explain the diverse and complex nature of that appeal. NOTES 1. Reader market data courtesy of Harlequin Enterprises Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 2.

Outsiders tend to be unable to interpret the conventional language of the genre or to recognize in that language the symbols, images, and allusions that are the fundamental stuff of romance. Moreover, romance writers are consistently attacked for their use of this language by critics who fail to fathom its complexities. In a sense, romance writers are writing in a code clearly understood by readers but opaque to others. The author of a romance novel and her audience enter into a pact with one another. The reader trusts the writer to create and recreate for her a vision of a fictional world that is free of moral ambiguity, a larger-than-life domain in which such ideals as courage, justice, honor, loyalty, and love are challenged and upheld. It\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 16 is an active, dynamic realm of conflict and resolution, evil and goodness, darkness and light, heroes and heroines, and it is a familiar world in which the roads are well-traveled and the rules are clear. The romance writer gives form and substance to this vision by locking it in language, and the romance reader yields herself to this alternative world in the act of reading, allowing the narrative to engage her mind and her emotions and to provide her with a certain intensity of experience. She knows that certain expectations will be met and that certain conventions will not be violated. How does the romance writer construct this fictional universe? By means of the figurative language she chooses to employ—rich, evocative diction that is heavy-laden with familiar symbols, images, metaphors, paradoxes, and allusions to the great mythical traditions that reach from ancient Greece to Celtic Britain to the American West. Through this language she creates the plots, characters, and settings that evoke the vision and transport the reader into the landscape of romance. Because the figurative language, allusions, and plot elements of the best-loved stories are so familiar and accessible, romance writers are often criticized for the lack of originality of our plots (which are regarded as contrived and formulaic) and the excessive lushness or lack of subtlety of our language. In other words, we are condemned for making use of the very codes that are most vital to our genre. But these codes, familiar though they may be, are extremely powerful. Contained within them is a collection of subtle feminine voices, part myth, part fantasy, part reality, messages that have been passed down from one generation of women to the next. The voices arise from deep within our collective feminine psyche and consciousness, and we suspect that most women have access to them, however strongly they have been defended against or denied. What are these messages? They include the celebration of feminine wisdom and power. Celebration of female ability to share, empathize, and communicate on the deepest levels. Celebration of the integration of male and female, both within the psyche and in society. Celebration of the reconciling power of love\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n17 to heal, to renew, to affirm, and to create new life. And finally, celebration of the feminine ability to do battle on the most mythical planes of existence where emotions rise to epic levels, and to temper and transform all this energy in such a way that it is brought down to human levels by the marriage at the end of the book. Romance novels are often criticized for certain plot elements that occur over and over in the genre—spirited young women forced into marriage with mysterious earls and heroes with dark and dangerous pasts who are bent upon vengeance rather than love. It is possible to write a romance that does not utilize these elements; indeed, it's done all the time. But the books that hit the bestseller lists are invariably those with plots that place an innocent young woman at risk with a powerful, enigmatic male. Her future happiness and his depend upon her ability to teach him how to love. Writers in the genre know that the plot elements that lend themselves to such clashes are those which force the hero and heroine into a highly charged emotional situation which neither can escape without sacrificing his or her agenda: forced marriage, vengeance, kidnapping, and so forth. Such situations effectively ensure intimacy while establishing clear battle lines. They produce conflicts with stakes that are particularly important to women. They promise the possibility of a victory that romance readers find deeply satisfying: a victory that is an affirmation of life, a victory that fuses male and female. The plot devices in romance novels are based on paradoxes, opposites, and the threat of danger. The more strongly emphasized the contrasts between hero and heroine are, the more the confrontations between the two take on a sense of the heroic. In many cases the heroine must do battle with a hero whose mythical resonance is that of the devil himself. She is light, he is darkness; she is hope, he is despair. The love that develops between them is the mediating, reconciling force. These heroic quests are often carried out against a lush setting which subtly deepens the sense of danger by presenting yet another contrast. Dark menace can walk through a dazzling ballroom. The devil can pass in high society.\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 18 Stories that utilize these elements have always been wildly popular. After being used and reused for centuries, certain plot devices have become associated with an elaborate set of emotional and intellectual responses in the minds of both romance writers and romance readers. When she sits down to pen a novel, the romance writer takes this web of responses for granted. She knows the conventions, she understands the layers of meaning that certain words, phrases, and plot elements have accumulated through the years, and she knows how these meanings have been shaped and refined for romance. She can be confident that her readers also understand these subtleties. The worldwide popularity of romance novels is testimony to the way the familiar codes are universally recognized by women as cues for their deepest thoughts, dreams, and fantasies. Most of the emotional and intellectual responses generated by romance plot devices are rendered complex by their paradoxical nature: marriages that are simultaneously real and false (the marriage of convenience); heroes who also function as villains; victories that are acts of surrender; seductions in which one is both seducer and seduced; acts of vengeance that conflict with acts of love. Such contradictory elements must be integrated in a happy ending for a romance novel to be deemed successful. It is the promise of integration and reconciliation which captures the reader's imagination. She is reminded of this tacit contract between herself and the author every time she picks up a book, reads the back cover copy, and registers such code phrases as \"a lust for vengeance,\" \"a hunter stalking his prey,\" \"marriage of convenience,\" \"teach the devil to love.\" Drawing on her own emotional and intellectual background, both inside and outside the romance genre, she responds to these code phrases with lively interest and anticipation as she looks forward to the pleasurable reading experience the novel promises. The concept of being forced to marry the devil, for instance, resonates with centuries of history, myth, and legend. Both reader and writer understand the allusions. They have knowledge on the subject of devils and demons that is wide ranging, gleaned from philosophy, theology, psychology, and literature, knowledge that encompasses many conflicting facts and cultural traditions. Both\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n19 reader and writer also have a vast acquaintance with the devilheroes who appear in romance novels, since there is a timehonored tradition of heroines sent on quests to encounter and transform these masculine creatures of darkness. When the romance reader picks up a book that describes a marriage of convenience to such a devil-hero, she understands she is being promised a tale that will deliver a strong sense of emotional risk and at the same time resolve paradoxes and integrate opposites. The happy ending will be especially satisfying because it will have been preceded by several exciting clashes between the heroine and her beloved adversary. To make such clashes work, the hero must be a worthy and suitably dangerous opponent, a larger-than-life male imbued with great power and a mysterious past. He will not run from the coming battle. Recognizing the allusions that testify to his mythic nature, the reader mentally girds herself for the fray when she reads the code words—phrases such as \"townsfolk called him devil\" on the back of the book. She glories in the expectation of the complex warfare she—in her imaginative identification with the characters—will soon wage. If the romance is well done, she will, as Kinsale and Barlow indicate in their essays elsewhere in this volume, find herself plunged into a combat in which she will fight on both sides. The romance novel will be a chess game in which the reader simultaneously plays the white and the black, a medieval joust in which she rides both horses into the lists. Such fantasies are exquisitely subtle and require that the reader be an active participant. She will enjoy the combat, relish the danger, and, perhaps most intriguing, exercise the full range of her options. This, by the way, is one of the true joys of romance fantasies. The reader knows that in the conflict between hero and heroine the heroine will never have to pull her punches. She won't have to worry—as many modern women do in their everyday lives—about being too assertive, too aggressive, too verbally direct because this hero is as strong as she is. He is a worthy opponent, a mythic beast who is her heroic complement. He has been variously described as a devil, a demon, a tiger, a hawk, a pirate, a bandit, a potentate, a hunter, a warrior. He is definitely not the boy next door.\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 20 Indeed, he's a man in every sense of the word, and for most women the word man reverberates with thousands of years of connotative meanings which touch upon everything from sexual prowess, to the capacity for honor and loyalty, to the ability to protect and defend the family unit. He is no weakling who will run away or turn to another woman when the conflict between himself and the heroine flares. Instead, he will be forced in the course of the plot to prove his commitment to the relationship, and, unlike many men in the real world, he will pass this test magnificently. Should the book fail to deliver on its implied promise, should the writer be unable to create the fantasy satisfactorily, make it accessible, and achieve the integration of opposites that results in a happy ending, the reader will consider herself cheated. The happy ending in a romance novel is far more significant than it might appear to those who do not understand the codes. It requires that the final union of male and female be a fusing of contrasting elements: heroes who are gentled by love yet who lose none of their warrior qualities in the process and heroines who conquer devils without sacrificing their femininity. It requires a quintessentially female kind of victory, one in which neither side loses, one which produces a whole that is stronger than either of its parts. It requires that the hero acknowledge the heroine's heroic qualities in both masculine and feminine terms. He must recognize and admire her sense of honor, courage, and determination as well as her traditionally female qualities of gentleness and compassion. And it requires a sexual bonding that transcends the physical, a bond that reader and writer know can never be broken. Thus, as the romance novel ends, the contrasting elements in the plot are entirely fused and reconciled. Male and female are integrated. The heroine's quest is won. She has succeeded in shining light into the darkness surrounding the hero. She has taught the devil to love. Nothing about the romance genre is more reviled by literary critics and, indeed, by the public at large, than the conventional diction of romance. Descriptive passages are regularly culled from romance novels and read aloud with great glee and mockery by everybody from college professors to talk show hosts. You would\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n21 think that we romance novelists—who, like anyone else, cringe at the thought of being made the object of ridicule on national TV— would have the wit to clean up our act. After all, we are talented professionals. We're quite capable of choosing other, more subtle, less effusive forms of narrative and discourse. Yet we persist in penning sentences like \"Caught up in the tender savagery of love . . . she saw him, felt him, knew him in a manner that, for an instant, transcended the physical. It was as if their souls yearned toward each other, and in a flash of glory, merged and became one\" (Barlow, Fires of Destiny).\n\nWhy? Are we woefully derivative and unoriginal? Do our editors force us to write this way? Do we all have access to some sort of romance writers' phrase book to which we constantly refer? Are we incapable of expressing ourselves in any other manner? The answer, of course, is none of the above. We write this way because we know that this is the language which best serves our purposes as romance authors. This is the language that, for romance novels, works. Why? Because the language of romance most effectively carries and reinforces the essential messages that we, consciously or unconsciously, are endeavoring to convey. In our genre (and in others, we believe), stock phrases and literary figures are regularly used to evoke emotion. This is not well understood by critics of these genres. Romance readers have a keyed-in response to certain words and phrases (the sardonic lift of the eyebrows, the thundering of the heart, the penetrating glance, the low murmur or sigh). Because of their past reading experiences, readers associate certain emotions—anger, fear, passion, sorrow—with such language and expect to feel the same responses each time they come upon such phrases. This experience can be quite intense, yet, at the same time, the codes that evoke the dramatic illusion also maintain it as illusion (not delusion—romance readers do not confuse fantasy with reality). Encountering the familiar language, the reader responds emotionally to the characters, settings, and events in the fictional world of romance. And although what she feels is her own internal experience, it is something that can be shared with millions of other women around the world, so the commonality of the experience is appealing, too.\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 22 But the reader's pleasure is not purely emotional. She also responds on an intellectual level. Because the language of romance is more lushly symbolic and metaphorical than ordinary discourse, the reader is stimulated not only to feel, but also to analyze, interpret, and understand. Surveys of romance readers have consistently shown that these women are more highly educated and well-read than detractors have assumed, a fact which should be evident to anyone studying the mythological traditions underpinning the language of romance. When the heroine of Judith McNaught's Whitney My Love attends a ball costumed as Proserpina and meets a black-cloaked man whom she regards as \"satanic\" in appearance, the reader is expected to recognize the myth that is being alluded to and to identify this dark god as the novel's hero. Later in the novel when the heroine is forcibly carried off by this man, the reader understands that the story is following a map laid down by a far more ancient tale. What exactly is the language of romance? For the purpose of discussion, we have decided to examine two forms of discourse: romantic dialogue and romantic description. Dialogue in a romance novel serves a larger purpose than simply to provide exposition and demonstrate character. What is said between the hero and the heroine is often the primary battlefield for the conflicts between them. Provocative, confrontational dialogue has been the hallmark of the adversarial relationship that exists between the two major characters ever since the earliest days of romance narrative. It is Jane Eyre's verbal impertinence that calls her to the attention of her employer, Mr. Rochester, who notes in one of their first conversations, \"Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you . . . when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.\" She is not his equal in terms of fortune or circumstance, but Jane proves early on that she is very much his equal in verbal acuity and assertiveness. Such is also the case in Pride and Prejudice, in which Elizabeth Bennet's growing attraction for Mr. Darcy is based not only upon her \"fine eyes,\" but also upon her ready wit. The opportunity to engage in verbal sparring is rarely declined by the heroines of\n\nBeneath the Surface 23 romance since it is far more likely to be her words than her beauty that win her the love she most desires. Romances are full of heroes who eschew the company of beautiful but insipid women who would rather fawn than fight. Indeed, heroes of romance enjoy the duel of wits. Frequently they take the heroine's words to heart, changing in response to her stated criticisms. The heroine's words are her most potent weapon. It is Elizabeth's scathing refusal of his marriage proposal that forces Darcy to reevaluate his own behavior and relinquish the worst aspects of his pride; it is Cathy's overheard comment about Heathcliff's unsuitability as a husband that drives him from Wuthering Heights and inspires him to educate and improve himself. In modern stories heroines continue to charm, provoke, and challenge their lovers with their conversation. After only one spirited dialogue with Whitney Stone, the heroine of Judith McNaught's Whitney My Love, the Duke of Claymore is inspired to court her. \"She had a sense of humor, an irreverent contempt for the absurd, that matched his own. She was warm and witty and elusive as a damned butterfly. She would never bore him as other women had.\" In real life women often complain about the reluctance of their male partners to engage in meaningful dialogue, but in the world of romantic fantasy heroes willingly participate in verbal discussions. They fence, they flirt, they express their anger, they talk out the confounding details of their relationships with the heroine. No hero of romance will ever respond to the eternal feminine query, \"What's wrong?\" with the word, \"Nothing.\" He will tell her what's wrong; they will argue about it, perhaps, but they will be communicating, and eventually, as they resolve their various conflicts, the war of words will end. One of the most significant victories the heroine achieves at the close of the novel is that the hero is able to express his love for her not only physically but also verbally. Don't just show me, tell me, is one of the prime messages that every romance hero must learn. Romance heroines, like women the world over, need to hear the words, and the dialogue of romance provides them with this welcome opportunity. Our second form of discourse, romantic description, is fre-\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 24 quently denounced by critics as being overly florid. But effusive imagery has a purpose. As we have already noted, the primary task of the romance writer is to create for her readers a vision of an alternative world and to give mythical dimension to its landscape and characters. Piling on the detail by means of a generous use of the romance codes is an effective way to achieve this goal. Lush use of symbols, metaphors, and allusion is emotionally powerful as well as mythologically evocative. It is the verbal equivalent of putting a person or an action under a microscope. Horror genre novelists like Stephen King use this technique to describe, for example, a murdered corpse, shocking the reader into a visceral response to the graphic horrors of death. Romance writers use the same technique in sensual love scenes to draw the reader into the landscape and to solidify her identification with the lovers by evoking within her some of the same emotions they are experiencing. The codes transport her to the world of romance and make her feel, briefly, as if she is a participant in the ancient dramas being enacted there. The physical characteristics of the hero and heroine are presented in considerable detail, and phrases such as \"his lean, hard thighs,\" \"her sparkling, emerald eyes,\" \"his penetrating glance,\" \"her prim features were softened by a generous lower lip\" are standard fare in romance. Many such codes reverberate with allusions to mythical archetypes: \"He was leaning against the cold stone wall, regarding her steadily with a slight smile on his narrow, sensual lips. Devil, she thought\" (Barlow, Siren's Song). And, from the hero in the same book: \"Faerie music, he thought, listening to a low-toned feminine voice caressing the words of a ballad .. . this lovely Siren must be she.\" A careful analysis of the physical description in most romance novels will demonstrate that, from a large lexicon of common descriptive codes, authors consciously or unconsciously choose those that best illustrate the particular archetypes with which they are working. Heroes associated with demons, the devil, the dark gods, and vampires tend to be dark-haired, with eyes that are luminous, piercing, penetrating, fierce, fiery, and so forth. Blond heroes are less common, but there is usually a fallen-angel quality about them.\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n25 In the passage of sample back cover copy at the beginning of this essay, the description of the hero is a blatant evocation of the Hades-Persephone myth. Ravenwood is dark and enigmatic, with the glittering eyes that one might expect to be attributed to the devil. He is clearly linked with the death god. Having drowned in the black, murky waters of a pond, the first Lady Ravenwood is a permanent shade in the underworld, and it is hinted that her husband may have been responsible. Sophy is, in many ways, his opposite. Described as country bred, she is fresh and innocent. Like Persephone of the myth, she is drawn into a marriage that she does not, at first, desire. Her tawny hair, the color of wheat, evokes her role as the daughter of Demeter, the great earth goddess of the harvest, spring, fertility. Thus the descriptive language sets up one of the oldest and bestloved of romantic conflicts: the mythical battle of death and life, despair and hope, eternal darkness and everlasting light. The individual words employed in the passage are highly connotative. Adjectives include such words as black, legendary, mysterious, beautiful, murky, country-bred, emerald, tawnyhaired, and masculine. Verbs include whispered, drowned, drawn, burned, teach, love. Nouns include devil, wrath, waters, bride, lass, strength, desire, foul play, and marriage of convenience. Such language is emotionally loaded. Each word conjures up vivid images in the minds of the readers, and the combination of so many evocative phrases in a short passage of prose creates for the reader a dynamic, multi-layered intellectual and emotional gestalt. Is it possible to do away with such language and still retain the romance? Suppose we tried to rewrite the passage in nonfigurative language. It might come out something like this: His acquaintances regard Julian, the Earl of Ravenwood, as neurotic. He's an odd character with a belligerent temperament, whose first wife drowned in the family swimming pool. Some believe she committed suicide, others think he murdered her. Sophy Dorring, an unsophisticated young woman, is engaged to Julian. Strongly attracted to him, she overcomes her initial reluctance to marry and sets her own agenda for their relationship: to help her husband get in touch with his emotions.\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 26 Same story, different language. But what a difference. By expressing the same ideas in ordinary discourse, we sacrifice the fantasy, the mythical elements, and that sense of magnificent opposition between two powerful but opposing forces. The problems of the hero and heroine are reduced to the mundane. Such diction might be deemed appropriate for the writer of mainstream fiction, but it is worthless to the romance novelist. Another interesting detail about romantic description is the use of paradoxical elements, echoing the heavy use of paradoxical plot devices. Although the hero is more commonly associated with darkness, hardness, strength, roughness, and evil, and the heroine with light, softness, vulnerability, gentleness, and good, there are elements of strength in the heroine and softness in the hero. \"A mouth that smiled easily was counterbalanced by the firm angles of her nose and jaw\" (Krentz, Affair of Honor). \"His eyes were large, brown, and dramatic . . . heavily fringed with dark lashes and arched with delicate brows that might have appeared too feminine had the rest of his features not been so uncompromisingly male\" (Barlow, Siren's Song). Or, as the hero of Amanda Quick's Seduction notes about the heroine, \"beneath that sweet, demure facade, she had a streak of willful pride.\" The reason for this type of description is to distract the reader from the fantasy elements of the story long enough to remind her of the underlying reality of the hero's and heroine's characters. The hero is not really such a bad guy, the reader divines. And the heroine is much tougher and more self-sufficient than she initially appears. Paradoxical words and phrases like \"fierce pleasure\" and \"tender command\" (from Seduction) are also used to depict the dynamics of the developing relationship. Frequently, the romance heroine is described as a \"willing captive\" to the \"tender violence\" of the hero's lovemaking. Detractors of the genre tend to quote such phrases to bolster their view that romance writers are doing a disservice to their sisters by perpetuating the myth that women enjoy rape. In reality, the rape of the heroine by the hero is rarely, if ever, seen in today's romance novel. Readers do not take such passages literally; indeed, the very use of paradox makes a literal interpretation impossible. The words \"captive\" and \"violence\"\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n27 remind the reader of the ancient fantasy underpinning such tales— the Hades-Persephone myth, for example—while the function of the words \"willing\" and \"tender\" is to clue the reader in to the reality of the characters' lovemaking, which is consensual and loving. The use of paradox also serves to hint at the perfect reconciliation that will occur at the end of the romance novel. This will be possible because each of the main characters is, in addition to being the embodiment of an ancient myth, a whole person, integrated and autonomous, with various strengths and weaknesses. When these two individuals come together, they create a union that is both mythological and real, a union that celebrates the power of the female to heal and civilize the male. In conclusion, we suggest that in order to understand the appeal of romance fiction, one must be sensitive to the subtle codes, contained in figurative language and in plot, that point toward a uniquely feminine sharing of a common emotional and intellectual heritage. Dedicated romance readers, long accustomed to responding to these cues, perceive the hidden meanings intuitively and find through them an intimacy with other women all over the world. It is our sex, after all, that excels at reconciliation and intimacy. Recent works on the differences between men and women, whether these be biological, psychological, or linguistic, suggest that women's particular expertise seems to be our ability to form significant relationships with the men, women, and children in our lives and to anchor and hold these relationships together. The messages contained in romance fiction, the language in which these messages are conveyed, and the intense experience induced by the act of reading itself tend to support and reflect this essential feminine concern. Like a secret handshake, the codes make the reader feel that she is part of a group. They increase her feelings of connection to other women who share her most intimate thoughts, dreams, and fantasies. In general, women tend to be less afraid than men to blend our voices with others. Women who write romance don't seek autonomy in our story-telling. We don't seek a distinctive voice (although most writers have one). Instead, in telling stories and using language that we know are beloved of women all over the\n\nLinda Barlow and Jayne Ann Krentz 28 world, we are validating each other. We are articulating the feelings and fantasies of our sisters who cannot, or choose not to, write them down. Their voices ring out, through us, as strongly as our own. It may well be that the use of the romance codes are more important to the success of a particular romance novel than are the usual elements upon which fiction is judged—the logic and cleverness of the plot, the development of the characters, or the vigor and originality of the author's voice. It's interesting to note that what is usually regarded as \"good\" prose style—presupposing the value of the original, individual voice over the value of merged voices—is not necessary for the writing of romance. This is true because in romance novels the shared experience is more valuable than the independent one. Is it possible that accepted literary standards of excellence are essentially patriarchal in nature? We propose this as a matter for further debate and discussion. Are there any differences between what men and women generally regard as acceptable prose style? Who made the rules that all serious writers are supposed to have internalized? \"Get rid of every adjective and adverb,\" a male colleague advised me after reading a draft of my latest manuscript. He also advised the use of shorter sentences. Lean and spare, short and terse. No emotion. But why, for example, must we show and not tell? Women enjoy the telling. We value the exploration of emotion in verbal terms. We are not as interested in action as we are in depth of emotion. And we like the emotion to be clear and authoritative, not vague or overly subtle the way it often seems to be in male discourse. Why do many of us who write romance feel a defiant pleasure as we compose our \"bad\" prose? Are we really a bunch of silly, incompetent, unoriginal writers, or are we thumbing our noses at the literary establishment while continuing to use the sort of diction that not only works best in our genre, but satisfies our most deep-seated fantasies on a subtle and profound level? This is a subject upon which a good deal more could be written, and we hope, through this essay, to stimulate such debate. The greatest challenge for the romance writer working today is to\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\n29 excite and delight our readers while, at the same time, fulfilling their expectations. It has been our experience that this is best achieved by making full use of the codes and conventions that have served us well for centuries, codes that are universally recognized by our sisters in every nation and culture, codes that celebrate the most enduring myths of feminine consciousness.\n\nLinda Barlow Linda Barlow holds a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature.

Her Sister's Keeper will be published by Warner in 1993.\n\nLaura Kinsale\n\nThe Androgynous Reader\n\nPoint of View in the Romance\n\nIt is a commonly accepted truism that when a woman reads a romance she is \"identifying\" with the heroine. Accusations directed at the genre, such as Marion Zimmer Bradley's (1990) polemic against romance, typically assume without further examination that a female reader must identify with the female lead and so is in danger of modeling her own life after a character who might be submissive, passive, or obsessed only with romantic love and maintaining her virginity. Academic analysts, not being writers of fiction, may perhaps be forgiven this rather superficial assumption about the reading experience, but romance authors— and, yes, even authors of sword and sorcery fantasy written for women, such as Bradley herself—often fall into the same error. So sure are they that the female reader must be identifying with the heroine that they create the character they suppose the modern, liberated woman must wish to be—so powerful in the corporation, so skilled at swordsmanship, so infallible with a rifle, talented at politics, tough-nosed in managing the ranch hands, invested with psychic powers, adroit with magic, highly educated, widely read, strong, smart, an excellent dancer and full of independent sass; in short, just the sort of person one would gladly strangle if one met her on the street. Romance novels of this type have been known to succeed in the marketplace. The most obnoxiously \"defiant beauty\" will not necessarily ruin the effect of a romance. This is not because ro-\n\nLaura Kinsale 32 mance readers actually admire, or wish to be, defiant beauties. It is because the hero carries the book. Kathleen Woodiwiss's Shanna (1977) provides a best-selling example. A sillier and more wrong-headed heroine than Shanna would be difficult to imagine; very few women would go to bed at night dreaming of actually resembling the annoying little shrew. Ah, but to be in her place—that is another matter. That is what the heroine of this kind of romance represents: a placeholder. Feminists need not tremble for the reader—she does not identify with, admire, or internalize the characteristics of either a stupidly submissive or an irksomely independent heroine. The reader thinks about what she would have done in the heroine's place. The reader measures the heroine by a tough yardstick, asking the character to live up to the reader's standards, not vice versa. Placeholding and reader identification should not be confused. Placeholding is an objective involvement; the reader rides along with the character, having the same experiences but accepting or rejecting the character's actions, words, and emotions on the basis of her personal yardstick. Reader identification is subjective: the reader becomes the character, feeling what she or he feels, experiencing the sensation of being under control of the character's awareness. Even the most well-conceived and fascinating of romance heroines embodies an element of placeholding. However, it is myopic to believe that just because the reader is female she is confined to the heroine's character as the target of authentic reader identification. In romance it is the hero who carries the book. Within the dynamics of reading a romance, the female reader is the hero, and also is the heroine-as-object-of-the-hero's-interest (the placeholder heroine). The reader very seldom is the heroine in the sense meant by the term \"reader identification.\" There is always an element of analytical distance. The reader is represented by and in competition with the heroine at the same time; therefore she has stiff requirements for this character, who must be presented as intelligent without being intimidating, independent without being offensive, attractive with-\n\nThe Androgynous Reader 33 out being smug. No easy task for a writer (or for the contemporary liberated woman, for that matter) and one at which most of us have bombed all too frequently, unintentionally creating instead the \"cast-iron bitches who appear petulant and unsympathetic rather than strong\" that Jayne Ann Krentz (1990) has warned us about. When the writer does fail with the heroine, however, it is quite easy for the reader to disassociate herself from the character and continue to derive pleasure from the story by using the heroine as placeholder. Tania Modleski's (1982) analysis of how third person point of view works, supposing it to be merely a sort of convenience—no more than first person narrative with \"schizophrenic\" asides to the audience—and claiming that \"hardly any critical distance is established between reader and [heroine],\" manages not only to overlook the power of third person narrative in controlling and creating emotion and reader identification but to get everything backwards. The first and most deceptively simple rule every toddling writer learns is Show and Don't Tell. The next thing the writer learns is just how difficult that standard is to achieve, particularly when trying to Show rather than Tell something about a character while in that character's consciousness. It is not an impossible thing to do by any means, but it is an enduring challenge. We all fall back on telling, and Modleski's \"schizophrenic narrator,\" the \"man-watching-from-the-closet\" who makes omniscient comments about the heroine's beauty, is really just an untalented writer. From Jane Austen to James Joyce, it is not only the finely turned phrase but the well-chosen showing that is truly vivid, dragging the spectator into the character's existence by creating a spontaneous, unforced, uninhibited transfer of feeling, character-reader-character. In a romance written from the heroine's third person viewpoint, who is most often being effectively shown in this intense kind of character evocation? The hero. The heroine's third person point of view is as likely to create distance between reader and heroine as to close it, especially in the hands of a mediocre writer who relies on beating the reader over the head with direct information about a character from within\n\nLaura Kinsale 34 that character's viewpoint. In general, rather than identifying with the heroine, the romance reader is probably farther from truly enmeshing her emotions and personality with those of the heroine than of any other significant character. It is strange that so little note has been taken of this phenomenon. Perhaps the point has been overlooked because analysts have focused so narrowly on reports from readers. The underlying effect of viewpoint is not obvious to the average reader, who, if asked, simply equates point of view with reader identification, assuming that if the writer has put her in a character's viewpoint, she must be \"identifying\" with that character, when in fact her strongest emotional response may well be engendered by a different source: the viewed actions of another character. In the context of this mistaken equation of viewpoint and emotional identification, Carol Thurston's (1987) early- and mid-1980s reader surveys both showed not only a striking aversion to the heroine-only point of view but an avid desire for the hero's. Thurston describes the results as a desire for a \"mixed\" point of view, but the only applicable question on her first survey appears to be: \"Would you like to read stories written from the hero's point of view?\" I don't see anything remotely \"mixed\" about the question or about a 70 percent positive response to it in 1982. If one considers the very real possibility that, by desiring the hero's \"point of view\" in such an overwhelming majority, these readers are actually asking for emotional identification with the hero, not simply his viewpoint, the response is a plain rejection of heroine-identification in favor of hero-identification. Thurston probes around the edges of the issue, pointing out that \"Readers are no longer satisfied with seeing only how the New Hero responds, they now want to look inside his head,\" but doesn't seem to confront the fact that romance readers have never had any intention of stopping so short as a mere look. I should reemphasize that the intensity of hero-identification is not necessarily predicted by the actual point of view in which the novel is written. A skillful writer can achieve a high degree of character revelation and reader identification with the hero without ever entering the hero's point of view. A truly great romance writer can even do it within the heroine's first person narrative:\n\nThe Androgynous Reader\n\n35 Jane Eyre is the classic example. However, it is certainly simpler— though not always more effective—for us mere mortals to invoke the reader's powerful stake in the hero by using his viewpoint. To be honest, female romance writers seem to be more talented at Showing and Not Telling for the male lead than for the female, even from within his point of view (all those years of dealing with the strong, silent type, I guess). We had better be good at it, because our survival in the genre rides on how well we actuate the hero. Indeed, until the 1980s, writers of Harlequin romances had to struggle to maintain clear and vivid \"internalizable\" heroes without entering the male point of view. At that time, authors were actually prevented from using the male viewpoint by their publishers, who clearly operated solidly within the idea that the reader always identifies with the heroine. The difficulty in meeting the imperative of providing sufficiently evocable and illuminated heroes was obviously of critical concern to readers, who have repeatedly called for more books \"from the hero's point of view\" (Macro, 1989). Significantly, now that the trend has swung firmly toward a substantial dose of masculine viewpoint, we hear no cries at all for \"more of the heroine's point of view.\" In my own historical romance, The Prince of Midnight, the heroine's character is virtually inaccessible for almost half the book, with little of her viewpoint and less explanation of it. The only comments I received from readers on the topic were complaints that they were frustrated on behalf of the hero because the heroine treated him so coolly. Because this same frustration was one of the hero's dominant emotions in the course of the book, I am led to the conclusion that these readers were comfortably identifying with him, not her. Through her own and the hero's eyes, the reader watches and judges the heroine; the reader does not typically become the heroine in the way she often becomes the hero as she reads, although the closer she moves toward spontaneously identifying with both hero and heroine the more rich and rewarding the romance is likely to be for her. When placeholder and reader identification merge, the experience of the story is utterly absorbing and vital; analytical distance recedes; the book becomes, as Janice Radway\n\nLaura Kinsale 36 (1984, p. 64) has suggested, \"not merely the events of a courtship but what it feels like\" (emphasis Radway's). If Radway had stopped there, she would have been close to the heart of the matter, but she goes on to say \"what it feels like to be the object of one, though this need not be accomplished by telling the story solely from the heroine's point of view.\" Radway's own italics in this second quote highlight where it is that she falls victim to the belief that the female reader is identifying only with the heroine, whether or not in the heroine's point of view. Although the readers she interviewed \"admitted that they want to identify with the heroine,\" what she describes them doing in this identification sounds to me like using the heroine as placeholder. If one begins with and proceeds from the presumption of heroine-identification, looking neither right nor left, everything female readers say about the reading experience is colored in that light, and subtle—or perhaps not so subtle—realities are neglected. My readers' voices come through loud and clear in letters, emphasizing a different perspective. \"Please, please write more books from the man's point of view.\" \"So many of the books dwell on the heroine, but the men are rather vague.\" \"All too often, because these novels are written by women for women, there's an inability to probe the male psyche beyond the he-has-to-be-strong-andcan't-emote scenario.\" \"Since I began to read romances in 1972, I've longed for more hero point of view.\" \"If [the hero] isn't in the first chapter or two, I'll put the book down. It's just boring.\" Of course, there can't be a love story (a heterosexual love story, anyway) without a hero, and complaints such as these are usually interpreted to mean that the romance is missing until the hero shows up. But I propose that, for a large proportion of romance readers, there's much more to the male character than half of the romantic relationship. When Radway says, \"The focus never shifts for these readers away from the woman at the center of the romance,\" I think she is wrong. One hundred percent dead blind wrong. I flatly believe that the man carries the book. Naturally, I have my own hunches about why the chemistry of reading a romance is so heavily weighted toward the male character. It is fairly obvious that the bottom line is sexual admiration: to\n\nThe Androgynous Reader 37 me, a large part of it feels like a simple, erotic, and free-hearted female joy in the very existence of desirable maleness. Hey, women like men. The pivotal twist on this commonplace observation, and something that seems to have been generally disregarded, is the significance of preferential hero-identification. What does it mean to a woman to feel—to want keenly to feel—what the male character feels as she reads? I think that, as she identifies with a hero, a woman can become what she takes joy in, can realize the maleness in herself, can experience the sensation of living inside a body suffused with masculine power and grace (adjectives very commonly applied to heroes, including my own), can explore anger and ruthlessness and passion and pride and honor and gentleness and vulnerability: yes, ma'am, all those old romantic cliches. In short, she can be a man. A fictional man, that is. I'm not speaking here of some male malarkey about penis envy (penis envy being a concept that causes the average woman to wrinkle her nose and say, \"What?\"). Identifying with a fictional hero is quite a different thing from wishing to be a real-life male or trying to control one, because this fictional man is altogether within and part of the reader herself: a vigorous, living aspect of her personality. He may be fictitious with regard to genuine males (and only the most oblivious of women wouldn't know it), but he exists nevertheless. Many readers comment that their husbands or boyfriends are leery of romance novels, bewildered by female enjoyment of the books, and really quite frightened that they're being put in competition with and held up to the standard of fictional heroes. It is logical to assume that much of the negative male reaction to the romance genre is based on this alarm. Who wouldn't worry? But fictional characters, as real as they can seem, are entirely internal constructs within the reader: the whole adventure is an interior one. A novel that works, in which reader identification takes place, is a methodical realization of elements of the reader's innermost life. If the taproot isn't there in the reader in the first place, the novel will not tap anything. The reader reads a good novel with a sense of discovery, but it is a discovery of elements of\n\nLaura Kinsale 38 the existing inner self. Many of the old epic myths seem confusing and strange to modern readers, not because the mythical elements aren't still alive in the human psyche but because the telephone lines are down, the expression is too foreign, the connection—the self-discovery—doesn't get made. So, as Ann Maxwell and Jayne Ann Krentz (1989) have so clearly revealed, we rewrite the myths and make the journey in our own time and vernacular. While I accept this idea that the romance genre perpetuates the archetypal myths, I think there is yet a deeper level at which women experience romance novels. Those poor boyfriends and spouses trembling in their boots can take comfort. They're scared of phantoms. A romance reader is not expecting any real-life person to live up to the heroes of her novels. She is experiencing herself as hero, and as heroine, completely within her own personality. If a hero or heroine does something the reader would not do, she will reject it. If she likes the character enough, she will pretend it didn't happen and go on; if she doesn't, across the room the book flies. If either hero or heroine does something she would admire herself for doing, she is warmed in an internal way: \"This is good, this is right, this is me.\" But regarding the heroine there is still, and always, that element of not-me, of her, of otherness. There is paradox involved in the placeholding component of the heroine. The reader is female in reality; therefore, it requires a greater stretch, a maximum submersion and letting go of self, to be another woman: the fundamental identity of gender means that a reader prefers not to surrender too much of her own individuality to this character but to remain judiciously objective. I suspect it is this sensation that Modleski is labeling \"hysteria,\" \"hypocrisy,\" \"schizophrenia,\" and \"bad faith\" in her description of the romance reader's experience of what I would call placeholding, a phenomenon that seems to me to be the exact opposite: a healthy maintenance of separate self-identity while reading fiction. If one can bring oneself to admit that a female reader might find it more difficult to be this fictitious heroine than to be this fictitious man—not because she is a pitiful, victimized woman but because within the reader there are masculine elements that can and need to be realized—then\n\nThe Androgynous Reader\n\n39 reading a romance is far from internally alienating. It is integrating. It is satisfying. It is downright fun, in fact. What reading a romance becomes, then, is the experience of \"what a courtship feels like,\" but a courtship carried on entirely between myself and myself. This heroine is holding my place (or perhaps I even like her enough to identify with her to an extent) and I am the hero. That is why romance readers are not, and never have been, intimidated by what Krentz calls the \"alpha male\" hero, the \"retrograde, old-fashioned, macho, hard-edged man\"—because the alpha male hero is themselves. In the reading of a romance, the conflict and resolution of a romantic relationship are entirely within the reader and have nothing directly to do with the reader's husband, boyfriend, male boss, or male co-workers, except as they may interfere with the reading process itself. If, as Krentz suggests, the romantic male lead always represents both hero and villain, then the reader must be experiencing those aspects of herself. If the hero is being gentled and tamed, it is a taming and gentling of passions within the female reader, not within any real-life male. Experienced and mentally healthy fiction readers always know where the fable ends and actuality begins. Reading a romance is not practice for the real thing. As Maxwell and Krentz say, \"We do not read... for a reality check.\" Not an external reality check, at any rate, but perhaps an internal one. I suspect that for a woman a romance may be a working-through of her own interior conflicts and passions, her own \"maleness\" if you will, that resists and resists giving in to what is desired above all, and yet feared above all, and then, after the decisive climax, arrives at a resolution, a choice that carries with it the relief and pleasure of internal harmony. The oft-derided happy ending is no infantile regressive daydream; it is a dramatization of the integration of the inner self, an integration that goes on day by day, moment by moment, in the lives of women and men all over the world, because—yes—civilization and family and growing up require of all of us, male and female, a certain turning away from adventure, from autonomy, from what-might-have-been, and we mourn the loss and must\n\nLaura Kinsale 40 deal with it. (Romance novels aren't the only manifestation of this fact. Pro football, male buddy movies, and men's genre fiction exist for a reason.) A female attorney, mother of three, who represents a labor union and reads and writes romance—a working attorney and mother, mind you, a modern superwoman— writes, \"I have a very strong vision of what I might have been had I not 'settled down' and gotten married . . . and I spend a considerable amount of psychological time and energy wrestling with it. This has nothing to do with my relationship with my husband, my children or dominance in my marriage. IT HAS TO DO WITH MYSELF. The choice [of marriage and family] is my choice, quite freely made, but often regretted nevertheless. Romances express that ambivalence, and then come down solidly on the side of getting married.\" That tired old claim that romance is not real literature because \"happy endings aren't realistic\" is silly, not to say pigheadedly obtuse. Romances have happy endings and the hero never dies in them because literature as represented by the romance genre expresses integration, not fractionalization, of the self. And in particular, I am convinced, romance reflects the exploration and reconciliation of male elements within the female reader. I believe that feminism may have taken something of a false step with many women when the more zealous constituents of the movement insisted upon placing \"femaleness\" in direct opposition to \"maleness\"—a bias well illustrated in Bradley's selection of short stories for her sword and sorcery collections, in which the females consistently outperform, outsmart, and out-philosophize the sorry collection of males they are arrayed against: so often against, with winners and losers. Perhaps this sort of thing is a hangover from an earlier, more desperate phase of feminism; but still, I think a large number of women simply never did require a devaluation of male characteristics. What they savor instead is the freedom to expand into all the aspects, feminine and masculine, of their own being. As the attorney cited above puts it, \"we like the male inside ourselves.\" To wheedle authentic reader identification out of a heroine is one of the toughest tasks a romance writer faces, and it is by no means her most important one. A heroine who is true to herself,\n\nThe Androgynous Reader 41 whatever her self may be—jet pilot or bashful spinster—is enough to make her part in the mechanics of a romance workable, if not a work of art. I am not proposing that authors shouldn't bother to create convincing heroines; indeed we should, and must. What I am saying is that in the rank order of reader interest and identification, the heroine always falls second to the hero—a property as integral to the romance as fourteen lines of five-foot iambic rhyme is integral to the sonnet. As the author of the first (to my knowledge) historical romance to have the hero alone on the cover, I have had a ringside seat at this new twist in the romance genre. It has been well known for some time among romance writers that many readers are rebelling against the standard \"clinch\" covers of historicals, with particular complaints voiced about the over-endowment of the illustrated females. The persistence of the clinch cover goes beyond market identification and the subconscious appeal of pornographic illustrations of females to male wholesale book buyers (a penchant rather amusingly hinted at in the very real and serious apprehension of two male buyers with whom I spoke about The Prince of Midnights hero-only cut-back cover: \"But where's the girl?\" \"I like the inside [a ripping-off-of-her-dress-and-crawlingin-the guy's-lap clinch] better\"). It is also another example of the fallacy of heroine-identification: everyone—publishers, art directors, and book buyers included—has been convinced that readers are identifying with the heroine; therefore the illustrated heroine should be gorgeous and well endowed, because that is what all women wish to be, right? Wrong. At first, like everyone else, I attributed the enormous popularity of The Prince of Midnights hero-only cover to the fact that romance readers are sick and tired of illustrations that focus so heavily on something in which they have no interest whatsoever— big-breasted, lust-crazed women—and are ready and waiting for a cover that emphasizes something in which they are highly interested: a hunk. I believe now that the issue is not so simple. That interpretation is certainly valid, but hunks have graced the covers of romances before—the very same hunk in fact, male model Fabio, as\n\nLaura Kinsale 42 on The Prince of Midnight—and while these covers have been popular and sold well, they have not created the stir of comment within the genre that the hero-only cover created. It is possible that, by delivering an attractive illustration of the hero alone, the publisher is doing more than merely furnishing the female reader with something concrete on which to hang the fantasy, in the way a Playboy centerfold provides a hook for a man's sexual fantasy. While I do believe this is a strong element in the success of the hero-only cover, a hero-only illustration may also serve to reinforce and enhance the reader's ability to identify with this man. The visual experience is not so fluid as the reading experience: the presence of a heroine in the illustration is rocksolid evidence that this character is not \"me,\" and cannot be \"me,\" because there she is, somebody else, right on the cover. On the other hand, when the reader has the hero alone on the cover, not only can she hold her own place as heroine but the cover message agrees with her perception of who is the real center of this book. Perhaps the most intriguing conundrum of hero-identification is the joy romance readers take in the \"fractured hero\": the ripped-up, torn apart, brought-to-his-knees alpha male. Once again, this is a phenomenon that has been widely interpreted in the light of presumed heroine-identification. Modleskt has argued that it represents a female revenge fantasy: \". . . all the while [the hero] is being so hateful, he is internally grovelling, grovelling, grovelling.\" Others have emphasized, like Krentz, the mythic struggle of the female to civilize and bond to the male or, like Radway, the creation of a comforting fairy tale of perfect romantic love. In these interpretations an emotionally shattered hero presumably would be a tamed one, providing for the reader the vicarious satisfaction of the heroine's success. Perhaps so. But I would like to point out one salient fact. During the height of the reading experience—the romantic climax— when the reader feels that wrench of emotion, the tingle in the spine, the full and authentic inner twist of reader identification with a character in an emotional cataclysm—when Rhett says to Scarlett, \"Frankly, my dear . . .\"; when Ruark Beauchamp of Shanna raises an inhuman \"raging howl . . . from the wagon\n\nThe Androgynous Reader 43 accompanied by repeated thuds against the heavy wooden door\"; when Clayton Westmoreland shatters the brandy glass in his hand in Judith McNaught's Whitney My Love; when Slade in Nora Roberts's A Matter of Choice growls, \"I love you, damn it. I'd like to choke you for it\"—who, may I ask, is the reader at that moment? Not the heroine, basking in female revenge or bonding triumph. Oh, no. She's the hero.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I've always been one of those die-hard fans of the old-fashioned, hard-edged romances which feature a feisty heroine who falls into love and conflict with a dangerous hero with sardonic eyebrows and a cruel but sensual mouth. In the romances I most enjoy, as well as the ones I write, the intensity of excitement I feel while reading is directly proportional to the level of emotional hazard the heroine experiences as her relationship with the hero develops. When he stalks her, carries her off, besieges her honor, and finally makes love to her with a passion and determination that would unnerve me if I ever encountered it in real life, I greedily turn the pages, finding within\n\nLinda Barlow 46 such scenes a catharsis of the essential impulse or desire that led me to pick up the book in the first place. Why? That's a tough one. I love \"serious\" literature, which I studied and taught, first as a graduate student and subsequently as a lecturer in English at Boston College before I became a published romance novelist. When I first switched careers, I used to feel vaguely guilty that my time, which ought to be spent in the serious study of Shakespeare, Austen, Virginia Woolf, or Charlotte Perkins Gilman, was now committed to the creation of pulsepounding works of popular women's fiction that rework the most ancient myths about the relations of men and women. But I have come to believe that the enduring popularity of the romance novel through time and across all boundaries of nation and culture proves that the appeal of such narratives reverberates on the deepest levels of feminine understanding. Romances are the stories that women tell to themselves . . . and to each other. Whether they be passionately metaphorical in the manner of Charlotte Bronte, witty and ironical in the manner of Jane Austen, or imperfectly rendered in the purplest of prose, they are the voices of women, bravely upraised. It is time these voices were heard, acknowledged, and understood. Although I have read several fascinating essays on romance novels as political or cultural documents, I see them as psychological maps which provide intriguing insights into the emotional landscape of women. The various elements contained in them function as internal archetypes within the feminine psyche. This includes the hero, whom I see not as the masculine object of feminine consciousness but as a significant aspect of feminine consciousness itself. In the most traditional sense, the romance novel is an emotional coming-of-age story. At some subliminal level, the narrative teaches a woman how to reconcile the various aspects of her own psyche that may be at war with one another so that she can feel herself to be a truly integrated, competent, and emotionally whole individual who is able to perform her various functions in the world. Psychologically, the fundamental romance novel situation— woman and man meet in an atmosphere of intense attraction and\n\nThe Androgynous Writer 47 conflict that is eventually transformed by the conciliatory power of love into a lasting pair bond—may be the nearest thing a woman has to the oedipal myth that allows the male to separate from his mother and establish his autonomous adult personality. Psychologists have begun to recognize that women do not make this separation so easily and that, indeed, it is not autonomy but intimacy that is valued by many women. On a profound level, the romantic myth enables us to comprehend the inner forces that must be manipulated in order to gain the confidence and the competence necessary to fulfill our vital task of negotiating successful relationships with the men, women, and children in our lives. How does the map work and what directions is it providing? Although we are currently seeing an extraordinary diversity in the themes, plots, and characterizations in romance novels, all romances share four basic elements: a heroine, a hero, a conflictridden love story, and a happily-ever-after ending. Because in the best of these stories both the conflict and the resolution derive from the characters of the lovers themselves, it is upon them that I will focus. The romance heroine is the primary aspect of feminine consciousness, the character with whom the reader is most likely to identify. She is engaging and likable, a genuinely sympathetic character. If she does more reacting than acting, more responding than initiating, this is hardly a surprise since it is with this aspect of femininity that most women are comfortable. Many of us were not brought up to be initiators; we have had to struggle for years, not only with other people's expectations of what we are capable of achieving but also with our own internal expectations. At a women's gathering I recently attended, each participant was asked to cast away the one thing in life that she felt was holding her back. Eleven of the twelve women present cast away some sort of fear— fear of losing control, fear of not being able to take care of themselves, fear of expressing their true feelings, fear of using their natural gifts in the "
