        "text": "NHMK Anime Reviews\n\nCritical Note: These reviews comes from decades of anime viewing. My own tastes and tolerances have changed dramatically over time. There are definitely some ratings that I would change now. Most are based on my reaction close to the time of viewing.\n\nThe color key is as follows:\n\nBold Green - Actual A/A+ anime. A highly recommended purchase.\n\nYellow - Enjoyable anime... probably not a regretable purchase.\n\nOrange - Borderline bad/tolerable anime... but it's like a trainwreck... probably don't want to buy this without watching it first.\n\nRed - Pretty bad anime. Watch with caution and definitely do not buy these without first seeing them!\n\nBold Red - Mental Self-Mutilation. If someone even asks you to watch this, question their motives. Avoid this at all costs.\n\nSpecial - Anime that deserves special attention as it crosses the fine line between garbage and greatness.\n\n* - An anime I have not seen completely for whatever reason.\n\nFilter (by Name): (Press Enter to filter)"
