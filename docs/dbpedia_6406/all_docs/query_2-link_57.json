        "text": "Have you always wanted to delve into classic novels, but have been too intimidated to start? Or had a bad experience in an English class and convinced yourself they weren’t for you?\n\nWhile some classics can be dense, difficult-to-understand tomes, there are many classics that are easy to read, even for beginners. I was one of those who fell in love with classic literature during high school and then went on to study it in college. Since then, I’ve continued to explore and enjoy classic literature on my own, and I believe that anyone with an interest can find a classic they will love, too.\n\nOf course, there’s always the ongoing debate on what qualifies as a classic, and what is a “classic classic” versus a “modern classic.” We’re not going to get that serious, here. This is purely fun. Classics for beginners. That debate can live somewhere else.\n\nHow did I choose this list of easy classics? I handpicked every one of them from my personal reads. I chose some because they are short classics; others because the writing is straightforward and not overly flowery; and others because the plot is so exciting or fun that I think even classics beginners will easily follow and enjoy them.\n\nMany of the books on this list I’ve already personally recommended to friends who don’t read the classics, and they have ended up loving them. I’ll never guarantee you’ll like each and every classic on this list; not every book is everyone’s cup of tea, and I can’t sit and chat with you to give you a personal recommendation. But I believe I’ve given enough variety and enough information on this list to help you find the easy classic for you.\n\nDon’t forget to pin this post for later reference:\n\nWhenever possible, I recommend buying books at local bookshops or throughBookshop.org, because shopping there puts the profits right into the hands of indie bookstores all over the country.\n\nYou can find all the books on this list on my Bookshop.org list here:\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy probably looks and sounds somewhat intimidating — it’s a work of classic French literature, after all, and what the devil is a Pimpernel, let alone a scarlet one? Don’t be scared off, because I’ll tell you, it is a ROMP from start to finish.\n\nIn this classic book, an anonymous English nobleman has been sneaking over to France and, utilizing bizarre tricks and disguises, saving people from the guillotine. The French agent Chauvelin grows more and more exasperated at being outsmarted by the most ridiculous capers imaginable, and he’s determined to uncover the Pimpernel’s identity.\n\nFor anyone who is intimidated by reading the classics, I think The Scarlet Pimpernel is a great place to start. Who ever knew that you could have so much fun during the French Revolution? It’s fun, it’s silly, and it’s engaging all the way through, making it a great classic for beginners.\n\n1984 by George Orwell\n\nGeorge Orwell’s 1984 is one of my favorite books ever, and it’s one of the few that I’ve reread, and more than once. It’s one of those books that has stayed with me and had an impact on the way I think about the world.\n\nIn this George Orwell classic, the government controls all, and informants are everywhere. Even technology is spying on you (sound familiar?). People live in fear of being reported to the “thought police,” and Big Brother is always watching. The protagonist, Winston, works in the Ministry of Truth, destroying and adapting historical records to fit the current government narrative. He is frustrated with the Party control over all aspects of life and begins to risk more and more to explore supporting a potential overthrow.\n\nPublished in the 1950s, 1984 is still eerily relevant and incredibly readable, making it one of my top recommendations for easy classics to read. The language is educated but not difficult, and the sentence structure is clear and straightforward (no stream of consciousness or pages-long sentences, here, folks).\n\nIt’s also one of the most influential books ever written, and one that has certainly impacted other dystopian novels, including dystopian YA fiction (i.e., if you liked The Hunger Games, then 1984 is the book for you!).\n\nRelated: Looking for more book recommendations? I read across a variety of genres and love sharing my favorite book discoveries. Check out my best reads of 2023.\n\nOf Mice and Men by John Steinbeck\n\nJohn Steinbeck is one of my all-time favorite American writers. I’m partial to some of his longer novels, like The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but I wouldn’t really call those classics for beginners. In fact, when I tried reading The Grapes of Wrath in high school, I hated it.\n\nWhile his most famous books may not be the best classics for beginners, Steinbeck has written some fantastic shorter novels that I’d categorize as classics that are easy to read. One of my favorites is Of Mice and Men.\n\nIn this short novel, two migrant workers and close friends travel around to different farms looking for work during the Great Depression. George is small and savvy, while Lennie is a giant of a man with a heart of gold but who doesn’t know his own strength.\n\nI won’t say any more, because I don’t want to give anything away, but know that this short classic will leave you emotionally wrecked, so prepare the tissues. This classic American novel shows you just how emotionally attached you can get to fictional characters in a short period of tine.\n\nRelated: I have spent the last few years learning about Steinbeck, and I’ve uncovered some fascinating facts on John Steinbeck that will likely surprise you. Also, if you find yourself in Northern California, make sure you stop in Salinas to eat at the John Steinbeck House Restaurant.\n\nMcTeague by Frank Norris\n\nMcTeague was one of my surprise favorite novels set in San Francisco I read in preparation for my trip there. Who would ever expect that a novel about a dentist would be such a thrilling, unpredictable ride?\n\nThe title character, McTeague, is a humble dentist in the big city, but his romantic ambitions lead him down a path of making darker and darker choices. It’s a bizarre sort of Adam and Eve tale, with no one to really root for, but it still manages to be pretty riveting.\n\nThis makes it on my list of easy classics, because the plot is easy to follow, and it’s engaging from start to finish. Even amongst avid classics readers, this novel gets largely overlooked.\n\nRelated: If you’re traveling to San Francisco, make sure to check out the best bookshops in San Francisco.\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nThe Great Gatsby is known as one of the quintessential American novels, and it’s a great place to start for beginners. It’s short, which makes for quick reading.\n\nPlus, just about everyone is already familiar with both the plot of The Great Gatsby — man longs for married woman he has always loved; becomes rich and throws elaborate parties in hopes she’ll find her way to one of them and fall in love with him. You’ve probably already even heard that Gatsby’s pursuit of Daisy symbolizes chasing the American Dream. That means you can read this classic novel without any guesswork about what it means.\n\nThe novel’s setting of New York in the Roaring 20s makes this a fun read, especially considering the opulence and luxury of Gatsby’s famous house parties. If you’ve been looking for easy classics to read, consider giving The Great Gatsby a try.\n\nRelated: Did you know that F. Scott Fitzgerald and his famous flapper wife Zelda are buried in Maryland? Their grave site is one of the surprising Fitzgerald sights you can visit in Maryland.\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou is one of my favorite modern classics. Maya Angelou mastered the art of memoir, and in this, her first in a series, she tells the story of her childhood in Stamps, Arkansas.\n\nIn this memoir, Angelou describes growing up while facing immense struggles, like the racism of the south, parents who were only mildly interested in being parents, and sexual abuse at a young age. Throughout it all, Angelou maintains both honesty and optimism, with love and books being the tools that see her through life’s challenges.\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a great classic for beginners; it’s readable, inspiring, and compelling.\n\nPersuasion by Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen novels can definitely be categorized as “easy classics” for the most part, but some are easier than others. I went back and forth on which to choose for this list, but ultimately, if I had to recommend one Jane Austen novel for beginners to classics, it would have to be Persuasion.\n\nWhile Austen’s Edwardian era writing can be an adjustment if you’re not used to it, I really think it’s entirely accessible for beginners. Persuasion is one of her shorter novels, which makes it unintimidating. The heroine, Anne Eliot, is the ultimate introvert and is easier to root for than some of her other leading ladies.\n\nAnd if you are struggling halfway through, know that this book has one of the best and most satisfying romantic payoffs at the end of just about any novel I’ve read. So there’s that.\n\nThus, Persuasion gets my recommendation as one of the most beginner-friendly, easy classics.\n\nTip: If you find yourself getting hooked on Austen and you’re ready for some more classics, consider trying a novel by Edith Wharton or Elizabeth Gaskell. Their novels require perhaps a bit more patience and focus than Austen’s, but they are wonderful society writers worth a read.\n\nTreasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nTreasure Island definitely belongs on a list of easy read classics. It’s not too long, and it’s packed full of adventure from start to finish. Treasure Island is sometimes classified as a children’s book, but really, I think it appeals to the child inside us all, the inner child that fantasizes about running away on a pirate ship in search of treasure.\n\nTreasure Island introduces us to the notorious pirate Long John Silver. There’s a sea voyage, mutiny, a race to the treasure, and pirate battles to be had in this fun classic for beginners. Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the most famous Scottish writers, and his adventure tales are classics for good reason.\n\nAnd Then There Were None by Agatha Christie\n\nAgatha Christie novels make great, easy classics to read. Christie is from the “golden age of detective fiction” and created the iconic detectives of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.\n\nAnd Then There Were None is one of her most famous novels. In it, you follow the mystery of eight people who accept invitations to a small, private island in England. The morning after they arrive, one of the guests is found dead in her bed. As the mystery unfolds, more and more guests turn up dead. Will the remaining guests be able to figure out who the murderer is before they all end up with the same fate?\n\nThis is a fun mystery novel that is a great introduction to classic mysteries.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye is the ultimate teenage angst novel. Its famous protagonist, 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, is a privileged white kid who goes to prep school, but he gets thrown out for rebellious teen behavior.\n\nOver the course of the novel, you come to learn that Holden is feeling lost in grief after losing his younger brother. His parents have failed to help him emotionally navigate the loss, and he is left alone railing against the “phoniness” of adults and looking for real connection in all the wrong ways.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye is an easy classic to read, especially for teenagers, who usually relate to the feeling of knowing a lot more about what’s important than all the adults around them who just don’t get it.\n\nGone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell\n\nNo, no, seriously, wait. Let me explain. Does Gone With the Wind have over 1,000 pages? Yes. “Why the $%^& would you include it on a list of easy classics to read??” you’re probably asking, but WAIT. Hear me out.\n\nGone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a PAGE TURNER. I am not kidding. When it first came out, it was never taken seriously as literature and definitely not considered a classic for a very long time. It was a bestseller; it was basically the ACOTAR of its age. A book with mass appeal, not a dense work of literature.\n\nIt has since been recognized as a classic because of how well it captures the American South before, during, and after the Civil War. But it’s also just a damn exciting story with the ultimate enemies-to-lovers romance.\n\nAn important caveat: This easy classic is also undeniably problematic in how it deals with race. Margaret Mitchell was a Southern girl through and through, and her portrayal of black people in the book is thoroughly racist. For that reason, many opt not to read it, and understandably so. My personal attitude is to read “classic” books very critically, with an eye to understanding how damaging practices and views came to take root in society, with an eye toward progress and improvement.\n\nDaisy Miller by Henry James\n\nHenry James is known for his transatlantic stories featuring rich Americans taking their grand tours of Europe. He was an important and influential literary figure of the time and one worth checking out for yourself.\n\nOne of the easiest Henry James novels for beginners is Daisy Miller, a novella about a bold American girl who is beautiful, unrefined, charming, and a decided flirt. She’s wholly unconcerned that the traditional European society figures consider her behavior brazen; she just wants to enjoy herself and the company of amorous gentlemen.\n\nDaisy Miller is a short and simple story in which it’s not hard to grasp the central theme — the contrasting attitudes of Golden Age America and steeped-in-tradition Europe.\n\nAnd if travel fiction appeals to you, this short novel will take you across Europe. The story begins in Switzerland, while the second half of the novel is set in Italy, with a particularly impactful scene taking place at the Roman Colosseum.\n\nAnne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery\n\nAnne of Green Gables is not just a book for adolescent girls; it’s actually a great introduction to classics for most readers. It’s also one of my favorite cozy books to read, because it makes life feel wonderfully simple.\n\nIf you have escaped knowing what this book series is about, it follows the life of a young, red-headed orphan named Anne who gets taken in by an older couple in Prince Edward Island, Canada.\n\nAlthough they originally wanted a boy who could help out on the farm and around the house, Anne’s sincerity and plucky attitude soon win them over. There’s actually a series of books about Anne, in case you, like so many others, fall in love with the charming titular character.\n\nRelated: this is one of the free books included with an Audible membership (is Audible worth it? My detailed analysis and money-saving tips)\n\nThe Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\nThe Little Prince might be considered a book for children, but I think categorizing it as such is actually misleading. Yes, it is simple. Yes, it does feature a very childlike character, a Little Prince. But what makes this classic so remarkable and memorable is its subtle investigation of the meaning of life itself, within a story so uncomplicated even a child can follow it.\n\nThe Little Prince will inspire you to focus on what matters in life, rather than getting caught up in matters of “great consequence.” With its short length, straightforward storytelling, and impactful central theme, The Little Prince is one of the best classics for beginners.\n\nRelated: Another “children’s book” that is a good place for those looking for easy read classics is Heidi by Johanna Spyri. You can even visit the real life Heidiland in Maienfeld, Switzerland.\n\nThe Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas\n\nI would categorize The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas as a classic for “intermediate beginners.” That is to say, if you’re entirely new to classics, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend picking this one of first; you might end up overwhelmed by the length or turned off by the meandering introduction.\n\nHowever, if you’ve made your way through one or two of the other easy classics on this list and want to step it up a notch or two, then give this one a try. Once you get into the swing of the plot, which can take some initial patience, this is a really fun story, one of the most fun easy read classics, and it’s so much better than the movie based on it.\n\nThis is a swashbuckling tale of four friends navigating life as musketeers amidst court intrigues and exciting adventures. And of course, there’s a romantic story line involving the beautiful and alluring Lady Constance.\n\nRelated: Chateau d’If in Marseille, the famous Count of Monte Cristo prison, has been one of my favorite literary travel destinations, and even movie fans will enjoy the trip.\n\nHopefully you found at least one or two titles on this list that you think will suit you for easy read classics.
