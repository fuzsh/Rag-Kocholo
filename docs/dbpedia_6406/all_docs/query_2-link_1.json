        "text": "Coraline\n\nBy Neil Gaiman, P. Craig Russell (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on horror that will keep you up at night.\n\nBy Christopher J. Ferguson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nEarly in life, I discovered I had a passion for the dark and disturbing, the things that make us lose sleep at night. This, on the one hand, led to my passion for reading. It also led me to a career in psychology, specifically forensic psychology, where I’ve practiced and taught issues related to the darkness that often resides within our souls. In my writing, I’ve sought to explore that darkness, both within and without. Perhaps by understanding evil more comprehensively, we can best learn how to manage it…before it is too late!\n\nChristopher's book list on horror that will keep you up at night\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nThis one is a bit more young adult-friendly. It’s got an admirable heroine I care about, but it also starts and remains very dark throughout. I love a great dark feel to a book, and this manages it without succumbing to pretension.\n\nPart of the fun of this book is, half the time, wondering what the hell is even going on! Gaiman manages this with aplomb, and it kept me hooked, always wanting to see what revelations and scares were just around the next page.\n\nBy Neil Gaiman, P. Craig Russell (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n15 authors picked Coraline as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Sometimes funny, always creepy, genuinely moving, this marvellous spine-chiller will appeal to readers from nine to ninety.\" - \"Books for Keeps\". \"I was looking forward to \"Coraline\", and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was enthralled. This is a marvellously strange and scary book.\" - Philip Pullman, \"Guardian\". \"If any writer can get the guys to read about the girls, it should be Neil Gaiman. His new novel \"Coraline\" is a dreamlike adventure. For all its gripping nightmare imagery, this is actually a conventional fairy story with a moral.\" - \"Daily Telegraph\". Stephen King once called Neil Gaiman 'a treasure-house…\n\nPreview\n\nWhichwood\n\nBy Tahereh Mafi,\n\nFrom my list on magical middle grade with darkness and heart.\n\nBy Heather Kassner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nEach summer when I was small, I visited my gram. During the day we would go off on one adventure or another—and at night, she enticed me to sleep with the promise of a story. Most often, she read Grimm’s fairytales to me. Full of darkness and also hope (!), they were, and still are, some of my very favorites. And they inspire what I most enjoy writing and reading.\n\nHeather's book list on magical middle grade with darkness and heart\n\nWhy did Heather love this book?\n\nIn this fantastical story, which is a companion to Furthermore, a lonesome girl scrubs the skin of the dead to ready souls for the afterlife. (Sounds properly spooky, doesn’t it? I love when books give me chills!) And when things are especially dark, as they are for Laylee, friendship shines all the brighter once it is found.\n\nBy Tahereh Mafi,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Whichwood as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

I love books that respect kids enough to make them think, and I seek out good books constantly, whether they are intended for kids, youth, or adults. I’m the author of the early education books It’s OK Not to Share andIt’s OK to Go Up the Slide, and the ghost adventure The Griffins of Castle Cary for kids ages 8-12. I’m a graduate of Swarthmore College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and besides writing, I host two podcasts: BookSmitten (children’s books), and Renegade Rules (early childhood). Enjoy the books!\n\nHeather's book list on spooky (but not too spooky) ghost stories for kids\n\nWhy did Heather love this book?\n\nI read this book a couple of years ago and the spooky setting still stays with me. It’s a creepy Victorian-style house with a sinister wishing tree that lurks inside it. Two innocent orphans confront the ghostly Night Gardener and try to resist the temptation of having any wish granted. I found this mystery pulls you in more and more deeply, just like the tree clutching at your soul. Auxier, who’s known for his “strange stories for strange kids” is masterful with spooky suspense.\n\nBy Jonathan Auxier,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked The Night Gardener as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIrish orphans Molly, 14, and Kip, 10, travel to England to work as servants in a crumbling manor house where nothing is quite what it seems, and soon the siblings are confronted by a mysterious stranger and the secrets of the cursed house.

During the day we would go off on one adventure or another—and at night, she enticed me to sleep with the promise of a story. Most often, she read Grimm’s fairytales to me. Full of darkness and also hope (!), they were, and still are, some of my very favorites. And they inspire what I most enjoy writing and reading.\n\nHeather's book list on magical middle grade with darkness and heart\n\nWhy did Heather love this book?\n\nAdventure and magic (so much magic!!) go hand in hand in this quirky story about a self-named thief, Quicksilver, whose quests lead her toward the truth of the Star Lands’ witches and the powerful Wolf King. Faithfully, her dog travels at her side, which is one reason I love this story so much. Animal companions make adventuring all the more fun!\n\nBy Claire Legrand, Jaime Zollars (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Foxheart as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Green Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThroughout my childhood, my mother repeated the mantra, “Love your own, leave others alone.” Her purpose was to prevent me and my siblings from begging to keep every animal we saw. Arguably, the phrase had some impact because we obviously didn’t bring home every animal. (But we also adopted a opossum from the backyard and named him Mr. Jenkins, so you be the judge.) For as long as I can remember, I have loved finding fantasy adventure books that feature the animals I love so much as trusted companions. I hope you enjoy the books on this list as much as I do!\n\nKayla's book list on clean fantasy books featuring animal companions\n\nWhy did Kayla love this book?\n\nCreating a book recommendation list of clean fantasy books with animal companions and not including The Girl Who Drank the Moon is like going ice skating without skates—I just can’t do it!\n\nThough written for a middle grade audience, this fantasy novel is one all ages can enjoy. It is clean and the narrative focuses on found family, goodness in life despite bad things happening, and hope—there’s so much beautiful hope in this book. But wait; there’s more! The cast of lovable characters includes Fyrian, a Perfectly Tiny Dragon (who believes he is a Simply Enormous Dragon).\n\nEvery Luna needs a Fyrian. And every witch. Oh, I can’t forget about swamp monsters—it seems everyone needs a Fyrian!\n\nBy Kelly Barnhill,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked The Girl Who Drank the Moon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Which one is the dominant me? Maybe funny and cheerful, maybe quiet and reclusive, maybe ambitious or adventurous – or maybe I’m all of these things? I think I’m drawn to witches because they're so surprising: a witch might be helpful, or she might try to eat you. It’s that unpredictability and mystery which intimidates people, so a witch is considered scary – until she’s not – and when I open a book about a witch, I never know what to expect!\n\nKarah's book list on witches as heroes\n\nWhy did Karah love this book?\n\nI have a real soft spot for fanciful fantasy and this has plenty: storm horses, story cakes, wind witches, and a crow queen. The writing is layered and lyrical; the characters are believable and endearing. It reminded me of fantasies I read as a child, especially the Earthsea books. It's an epic story filled with magic and friendship about fate and learning to believe in your own strength.\n\nBy Jennifer Adam,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Last Windwitch as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFans of Shannon Hale and Kelly Barnhill will delight in this charming and richly imagined middle grade fantasy debut, featuring a wicked queen, magical animals, a henchman with a golden heart, and a small girl with a great destiny.\n\nMany years ago, in the kingdom of Fenwood Reach, there was a powerful Windwitch who wove the seasons, keeping the land bountiful and the people happy.

Dao,\n\nWhy did Kate love this book?\n\nI adore an anti-heroine story, and Dao delivers in this Asian-inspired reimagining of the Evil Queen about one peasant girl’s quest to become Empress by unleashing the darkness inside her.\n\nThe worldbuilding is lush, full of vivid details. The characters have amazing depth, never becoming one-dimensional stereotypes.\n\nThe protagonist is wonderfully complex. You sympathize with her at one point and then, in the next, she does something totally hateful. Her dark jealousies and obsession with her own beauty would make you despise her, but you’d also feel her frustration for having her ambition smothered as a woman in a patriarchal world.\n\nBy Julie C. Dao,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Forest of a Thousand Lanterns as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

(illustrator),\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nDragons in the Bag unleashes imaginative fantasy creatures—yes, dragons—in the middle of present-day, gentrifying Brooklyn. The heart (and there’s a strong heart here) of the story is Jax, a Black protagonist. The book combines a real sense of place with magic, family mysteries, and an adventure challenge of managing a bag of dragons. I loved the way that the author, Zetta Elliott, created believable and lovable characters, such as Ambrose, an apparent homeless man, that drive the story forward in unforgettable ways. A solid read even for people like me who don’t normally pick up fantasy stories.\n\nBy Zetta Elliott, Geneva B. (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Dragons in a Bag as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe dragon's out of the bag in this diverse, young urban fantasy from an award-winning author!\n\nWhen Jaxon is sent to spend the day with a mean old lady his mother calls Ma, he finds out she's not his grandmother--but she is a witch!

Will Jax get…\n\nPreview\n\nJulia Vanishes\n\nBy Catherine Egan,\n\nWhy did Maureen love this book?\n\nJulia Vanishes, Book One in the Witch’s Child series, is fantasy sprinkled liberally with strong female characters. One of those characters is most certainly Julia. She is deeply flawed, has a mysterious past, and makes a living as a thief, so she’s a bit of an anti-hero. Julia also has a talent for making herself unseen—but this talent is evolving and expanding in ways that are quite frightening. Although Egan’s world-building and plotting are brilliant, what I love most are Julia’s interactions with characters like her lover Wyn (the ultimate bad boy), the mysterious Mrs. Och, and most especially Pia the assassin. Dialogue fraught with tension and humor hurtled me from one chapter to the next.\n\nBy Catherine Egan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Julia Vanishes as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"An exciting novel with magic and serial killers....

Not invisible, exactly. Just beyond most people's senses.\n\nIt's a dangerous trait in a city that has banned all forms of magic and drowns witches in public Cleansings. But…\n\nPreview"
