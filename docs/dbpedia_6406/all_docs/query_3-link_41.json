In the northern section of the map near where you find Hope, use Mog to uncover a hidden character named Captain Cryptic. Serah comments on how he looks remarkable similar to Amodar, Lightning's Captain from XIII.\n\nOnce you answer one of his questions correctly, he will rewards you with a Fragment before disappearing to another location in the level. You can gain 5 Fragments from finding him around Academia and answering his questions.\n\nThere are also numerous quiz stations scattered throughout Academia that give out Fragments for answering 10 questions correctly in a row. These questions range from basic knowledge of the Final Fantasy XIII universe to rather random queries you have to use monster knowledge to pick and choose from.\n\nWhat is the name of the Gran Pulse paradise created from nothing but a poet's dreams?\n\nWhat is the best act of the circus troupe the Circus Riders, a group of acrobats who use airbikes for dangerous stunts?Chicken Race\n\nIn 1 AF, an old flanbanero flower was discovered in crystal. The Color was a cross between crystal and flanbanero. What was the color? Muddy Violet\n\nWhich of the following cannot be found in New Bodhum?Active volcanos"
