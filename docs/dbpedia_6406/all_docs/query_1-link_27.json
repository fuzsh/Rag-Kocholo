        "text": "May 10, 2024\n\nI donâ€™t normally read YA romance, but this was a fun change. Cute and quick read! Romance lovers should check this book out!\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nI recently had the pleasure of reading Eden, a story that truly engaged my imagination.\n\nFrom the very first page, youâ€™re drawn into a world filled with a mystical island, enchanting landscapes, and a love story that pulls at heartstrings. Tolkâ€™s descriptions and wholesome characters brought the story to life in a way that makes you feel like you are right there alongside them, experiencing their triumphs and tribulations.\n\nWhat I appreciated most about this book was its ability to transport me to a place where anything was possible and where love and goodness reigned supreme. It was a much-needed respite from the chaos of everyday life, and I found myself eagerly turning the pages to see what would happen next.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone in search of a well-written, fantasy romance that will ignite their imagination.\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\nSimultaneously not wanting to put down this captivating and beautifully written story while at the same time desiring to savor the delicious writing. Captivating from the start as the characters leap off the page creating an instant connection to the reader. Truly, I have not indulged in a work of fiction this well written for some time. Tolk, a master artist, implements imagery to paint vivid scenes, â€˜As the sun began to set in the distance, a pale, yellow sphere draped in orange chiffon, casting its final shimmers on the glittering waterâ€¦â€™ Absolutely, I recommend this page turner of young adult fiction that will quickly engross even more seasoned readers. Delve into the world of Eden and fall in love with Kaya and Drew through their adventures of discovering friendships, life and truth from new perspectives. Happy reading!\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nI loved this book! Following along as Kaya discovered a new world and seeing the sweet and tender feelings blossom between her and Drew was simply magical. This book is perfect for young (and old ðŸ˜‰) readers who love clean romance, descriptive writing that whisks you away, and reading a story that unfolds with each enticing chapter. I canâ€™t wait to see what Lisa Tolk comes up with next!\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nSeriously obsessed with this book. Havenâ€™t stopped thinking about it since I read it! Would totally recommend to any lover of good, clean romance!!\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nLoved this book! Itâ€™s a great read by the pool or beach! Itâ€™s a wholesome adventure and love story. I couldnâ€™t wait to see how it ended. The writing it awesome!\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nGreat clean and fun teenage read!\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nIf you love a good love story, put Eden at the TOP of your list! This beautiful book will absolutely capture your heart. The settings are enchanting- a mystical, secret island and a darling East Coast beach town. The love story is to die for- a darling island princess falls for a DREAMY lighthouse keeper. And the plot overall is so engaging and exciting. I will be dreaming about this love story for MONTHS!\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nI loved reading this novel! The setting really drew me inâ€”it captures the true-to-life atmosphere of Maine while weaving in the fascinating (and mysterious) world of Eden. Itâ€™s a beautiful coming-of-age narrative that not only has a sweet romance but is also a love letter to literature, family, and independence of thought. I appreciated the way Kaya and Drewâ€™s characters developed throughout the novelâ€”the slow-burn romance felt realistic and true to their life experiences and individual journeys. Keeping my fingers crossed for a movie adaptation someday!\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nThis was such a cute and fun young adult fiction book written by my good friend, Lisa. I loved it and was fascinated with her writing abilities. We had a great discussion in book club. Way to go, Lisa!\n\nMerged review:\n\nBOOK CLUB."
