        "text": "The series is called Finn's Quest by Eirlys Hunter, and the first book is called The Queen-Seekers (2000).\n\nThis is the original cover of the first book. It appears to be a first-person view through a rocky tunnel, apparently a dungeon, with torches and the hand of the viewpoint character in the foreground holding a staff or wand.\n\nThe main character, Finn, starts to play a computer game called \"The Ultimate Adventure\" and ends up sucked into the computer world where he is sent on a quest in a land called \"Coralia.\"\n\nThe back cover blurb reads:\n\nFinn's life takes on an unreal twist when he finds himself actually in a computer game world. It's a world at war, a world of magic and evil, in which someone wants Finn dead. With Gala, a girl who's addicted to risk-taking, he begins his dangerous but exciting journey through a land where all the rules are different.\n\nThe \"game\" can definitely have effects in the real-world; in the second book, Coldkeep Castle (2001) his father is kidnapped into the game and Finn must re-enter the game to rescue him.\n\nTime definitely passed much faster in the game world; the third book The Slave-Stealers (2004) takes place a few weeks/months later in the real world, but 4 years have passed in the game world.\n\nI've found a higher-resolution image of the 2nd book's cover; you can definitely see that it appears to be computer-rendered image. (Complete with a highly-unrealistic hand holding a staff.)\n\nThe first book in this series is called Off to Be the Wizard (by Scott Meyer).\n\nMartin Banks is just a normal guy who has made an abnormal discovery: he can manipulate reality, thanks to reality being nothing more than a computer program. With every use of this ability, though, Martin finds his little “tweaks” have not escaped notice. Rather than face prosecution, he decides instead to travel back in time to the Middle Ages and pose as a wizard.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nAn American hacker in King Arthur’s court, Martin must now train to become a full-fledged master of his powers, discover the truth behind the ancient wizard Merlin…and not, y’know, die or anything.\n\nI read this series and was trying so hard to remember the name so I could get my son to read them!"
