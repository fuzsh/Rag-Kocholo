        "text": "Looking for the best historical fiction books for kids? Children’s historical fiction books transport kids into the past through the relatable eyes of a story about other kids. Readers learn so much more about history when immersed in a story than in a nonfiction textbook or memorizing maps and dates. And, you can use these books to teach literacy skills — reading and writing — like I used to do with my 5th grade students. This multidisciplinary approach brings so much added value to children.\n\nIn this list, you’ll discover all my personal recommendations and original reviews of well-written historical fiction chapter books and middle grade book favorites that kids can’t put down. Yes, I’ve read them all. And yes, I only share books that are kid-appropriate with excellent writing.\n\nWhat is the definition of historical fiction?\n\nA historical fiction book is defined as a book that takes place in a real-time period and location in history — whether it’s World War II, Ancient Egypt, the American Civil War, or colonial India. The setting is the actual true story history but the story and its characters, their actions, and their dialogue are fictionalized, even if they’re based on real people.\n\nHelp children understand the historical concepts of history by explaining that history occurs in the past. Yesterday and 100 years ago are both history.\n\nWhy should children read historical fiction?\n\nWhen children read historical fiction books, they learn about that historical period through the eyes of the main characters in the book. Reading a story about a place and time from the past is easier to remember than reading a nonfiction book. Why? Because stories stick in our brains!\n\nReaders will learn about different countries and cultures, too, including Russia, Lithuania, Pakistan, England, Syria, China, and others.\n\nThrough this historical lens, readers will also learn about themselves. As we know, books help us know others and ourselves. Which is an amazing and valuable thing, isn’t it?\n\nWhat is a good historical fiction book?\n\nFirst, you want to read historically accurate books that aren’t told with a slant. Although, all stories are slanted to some degree, of course. You don’t want to read a book that erases a perspective or truth of one group of people.\n\nBeginning readers start with historical fiction chapter books. These young readers, in first grade through third grade, will discover important history through books like Magic Tree House and the I Survived series.\n\nKids who are ages 9 to 12 will be reading middle-grade chapter books for more advanced and complex plots and character arcs. These readers in upper elementary and middle school can handle a bit more emotional arc with sadder stories, sometimes violence, (I’ll indicate those), stories with impact and meaning.\n\nFinally, older readers, teenagers in high school, will want to read historical fiction for young adults, YA books.\n\nLet’s dive in to the list of good historical fiction books for kids…\n\nBest Historical Fiction Books by Event\n\nBest Historical Fiction Books\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBeginning Chapter Books (Ages 6 – 9)\n\nMiddle Grade Historical Fiction (Ages 9 – 12)\n\nYA Books (Ages 13+)\n\nBest Historical Fiction Chapter Books\n\nBest Middle-Grade Historical Fiction Books\n\nPrairie Lotus by Linda Sue Park (ages 9 – 12)\n\nPark writes a wonderfully touching multilayered story about a young half-Asian girl’s life during western expansion, and frontier times.

We hear from an American teenage soldier who was born in Germany, a French Algerian girl whose mom is a recently captured spy, a Canadian paratrooper who lands in the wrong spot, and an American black medic. It’s violent and disheartening, yet despite terrible losses, racism, and injuries.\n\nA Place to Hang the Moon by Kate Albus (ages 9 – 12)\n\nAn absolutely wonderful, heartwarming historical fiction story with close-knit siblings who stick together and eventually find their forever home. Three siblings join the groups of children leaving London during WWII because their neglectful grandmother has recently died and they need to find a new home.

Noah realizes he needs to think for himself about to whom he is loyal — but it’s not an easy choice. This would be a great historical fiction book club book!\n\nWhen the World Was Ours by Liz Kessler (ages 9 – 12)\n\nThree friends from Vienna, Leo, Max, and Elsa are separated by war, location, and ideology. Leo and Elsa are Jewish so their path includes ghetto housing, escape for one of them, and a prison camp for the other. But, Max is not Jewish, and his main goal is to get the approval of his brutal Nazi father. To do so, he gladly pursues Nazi beliefs and actions, despite the nagging voice that reminds him that his friends weren’t “dogs” or less than human. It’s a heartbreaking, beautiful story about humanity, morality, hope, and love.\n\nIndian No More by Charlene Willing McManis and Traci Sorell (ages 9 – 12)\n\nIndian No More is an emotional, important story about when the U.S. government arbitrarily made certain Native American tribes no longer tribes without reservations or legal rights. It also shows the historical landscape of prejudice and stereotypes toward people of color. I love the close-knit, loving family based on the author’s own life, a family who values each other and their survival. This historical fiction book for kids is a must-read and must-own for all schools and libraries and would make an excellent book club selection.\n\nThe Bluest Sky by Christina Diaz Gonzalez\n\nHector lives in Cuba with his mom and older brother in a communist-controlled state that imprisoned his now-exiled dad.

All the while, the Red Army marches right behind them, and her brother, Youngsoo, gets sicker and sicker. A bittersweet ending.\n\nShow Me a Sign by Ann Clare LeZotte (ages 9 – 12)\n\nseries\n\nThis mesmerizing middle-grade historical fiction story is set in the community of Chilmark with a high percentage of deaf individuals. Mary’s a smart girl who speaks sign language and struggles with her friend Nancy’s prejudice against the “Indians”. Then, a researcher kidnaps Mary as a live specimen. For months she’s imprisoned and forced to work, locked in a room, and studied. Eventually, she escapes and is reunited with her family. This is an eye-opening, must-read story about the historical treatment and prejudice towards the deaf and, echoing that, the Wampanoag.\n\nPony by R.J. Palacio (ages 9 – 12)\n\nPony is a deeply moving story set in western frontier times about a boy who, with a remarkable pony and ghostly best friend, sets off from home in pursuit of his kidnapped father.

First is a young Jewish boy who escapes from Nazi Germany on a ship to Cuba, only to be turned away from the Cuban port and sent back to Europe. Next is a Cuban girl in the 1990s who, with her family and neighbors, flees in a homemade raft to the United States at great peril. Finally is a Syrian boy whose home is bombed in a country at war. He and his family travel a great distance to find a country that will allow them shelter. Gatz skillfully connects all three stories with a satisfying, realistic conclusion.\n\nGround Zero by Alan Gratz (ages 9 – 12)\n\nDisturbing. This first-person story is about a boy named Brandon whose dad took him to work in the Twin Towers on 9/11 and recounts his confusion, fear, and horror during the terrorist event. Sensitive readers, be aware that this book does include real events like the wall of fire and the people jumping off the building, and the death of Brandon’s dad. But, it also shows a stranger taking responsibility and care of Brandon, ultimately getting him to safety. Simultaneously, we read a first-person story about a girl in Afghanistan who helps an American soldier against the Taliban’s wishes.\n\nAhisma by Supriya Kelkar (ages 9 – 12)\n\nAnjali’s parents join the freedom movement against the British government. Through her parents, Anjali begins to see her world differently, including the poverty-stricken caste of many people call “the Untouchables”. Other Indian families do not like the changes her family is making. Then, Anjali’s mom is thrown in jail! I couldn’t put this book down.\n\nStrong as Fire, Fierce As Flame by Supriya Kelkar (ages 9 – 12)\n\nDon’t miss this powerful story set in colonial India about a girl finding her voice and inner strength. Meera’s dad holds fast to his belief that if her husband dies, so she must also die. She’s only twelve and still lives at home, but just as she’s about to live with her husband (who she married as a child), her husband dies! Now her father expects Meera to join her husband’s funeral pyre. She doesn’t go. Her aunt gives her the courage to flee. But as she’s escaping, she’s captured by a British captain and assigned to work in his kitchen, where she witnesses firsthand the institutional racism and cruelty to her people. Initially, Meera is afraid, but she learns that she can not look the other way and fights back by helping the resistance.\n\nThe Star that Always Stays by Anna Rose Johnson (ages 9 – 12)\n\nThis is a rich coming-of-age historical fiction book for kids set around the first World War.

Betty’s mother seemed to despise her, but Betty had good friends and younger siblings who loved her. Eventually, kind church friends took her in and adopted Betty. During this period of her life, we see the importance of church, counting her blessings, the activist housewives group she belonged to, and how a family is what you make it.\n\nDactyl Hill Squad by Daniel Jose Older (ages 9 – 12)\n\nseries\n\nTake a thrilling ride through Civil War history — with DINOSAURS! In this exciting adventure with diversity, slavers kidnap most of the orphans in NYC’s Colored Orphan Asylum but the small group of kids that escapes to join with the Vigilance Committee to fight back and rescue their kidnapped friends.\n\nCub by Cynthia L. Copeland (ages 9 – 12) GRAPHIC NOVEL\n\nExcellent! In this historical middle grade graphic memoir, Cynthia Copeland shares the time in her life when she got to be a “cub” reporter when middle school was composed of predators and prey (she was prey). While the mentor reporter helps Cynthia become interested in local and national politics and events like equal rights for women and Watergate, we also see Cynthia going “steady” with a boy and making new friends when her best friend dumped her. Wise, relatable, and thoroughly enjoyable to read. (*Sensitive readers, this book includes the word cr*p.)\n\nThe Night Diary by Veera Hiranandani (ages 9 – 12)\n\nWritten in a diary as letters to her Mama, Nisha shares how her life is turned upside down when the British rule of India ends in 1947, splitting the country into two — the Muslim north where she lives becomes Pakistan and the Hindu south remains India.

Assimilate, leave, only befriend other Muslims, or stand up to the bullies. He decides to take his father’s advice and try using love to overcome hate…\n\nThe Great Trouble: A Mystery of London, the Blue Death, and A Boy Called Eel by Deborah Hopkinson (ages 9 – 12)\n\nWow. I not only learned a TON from this historical fiction novel, but it was thoroughly mesmerizing! Eel’s an orphan who turns one of his odd jobs into saving lives when he helps a real historical person, Dr. Snow, determine if the water pump in Eel’s neighborhood is the source of deadly cholera.\n\nThe Blackbird Girls by Anne Blankman (ages 9 – 12)\n\nThis story explores what happens after Chornobyl explodes in 1986; it’s about Russia, friendship, family, and prejudice.

Interspersed with this story is another story of a Jewish girl named Rifka who flees her home when the German army arrives in 1941.\n\nWords on Fire by Jennifer A. Nielsen (ages 9 – 12)\n\nNielsen deftly captures the history of Lithuania’s book smugglers, showing how books keep alive a language, culture, and identity, no matter how hard someone tries to erase it. Audra doesn’t know her parents are book smugglers until they are arrested by the Cossacks. She flees to their contact’s house, soon learning that her parents were part of a network of Lithuanian’s who fought against the Russians by smuggling books. This is an inspiring story of a little country of farmers who managed to keep their culture alive even after the Russians banned their language and their books. Highly recommended!\n\nRunning Out of Night by Sharon Lovejoy (ages 9 – 12)\n\nI highly recommend this powerful story of two maltreated girls who hope for a better future. The narrator is a white girl in the south who is nothing more than a slave to her family, she doesn’t even have a name. She meets and joins a runaway slave who is escaping the horrific brutality of slavery and separation from her family. Together they find kindness and hope with a Quaker family.\n\nThe Unexpected Life of Oliver Cromwell Pitts by Avi (ages 9 – 12)\n\nAction-packed from the first page, this is one historical fiction middle grade novel you don’t want to miss.

It’s one misfortune after another but Oliver is determined to find his father and sister in London. Somehow.\n\nWhen Winter Robeson Came by Brenda Woods (ages 9 – 12)\n\nEden, who lives in Los Angeles in the 1960s, is spending the summer with her cousin Winter who is visiting.

Surprisingly, they find answers — and make new friends. Just as the reunion takes place with Winter’s dad who lost his memory due to an accident, the nearby neighborhood of Watts becomes a war zone with clashes between police and Black residents. Written in free verse, this is an easily accessible story of family, community, and history.\n\nEscape from Aleppo by N.H. Senzai (ages 9 – 12)\n\nThe story alternates between when the 2010 violence erupted in Syria and the “present” time in 2013 when Nadia’s home is bombed and she escapes. Only her family accidentally thinks she’s dead and leaves her behind. Nadia meets an old man and two orphans. They navigate through the checkpoints and bombings, seeing that the old man has many identities and even though he’s sick, he’s trying to rescue historical artifacts from the war. It’s a powerful story about a country and people in crisis.\n\nAnne of Green Gables (A Graphic Novel) adapted by Mariah Marsden, illustrated by Brenna Thummler (ages 8 – 12) GRAPHIC NOVEL\n\nHaving just watched this series on Netflix (“Anne with an E”) with my daughter, we liked this graphic novel adaptation of orphan Anne’s life in Canada at Green Gables but longed for the details that only the show or, even better, the actual novel could provide. However, this is a great introduction to the series and hopefully, the stories selected in this graphic novel will inspire kids to read the original books by L.M. Montgomery.\n\nJourney of the Pale Bear by Susan Fletcher (ages 9 – 12)\n\nArthur Welsh is a poor homeless Norwegian boy who works for passage on a ship to England as the caretaker of a captive polar bear, a gift for the King Henry of England. The conditions for the polar bear are worse than the boys, both being victims of their circumstances, powerless and captive. It’s a physical and emotional journey of survival and friendship. The two survive a pirate attack, escape in the wild, and a new life in England. I hated the captivity of the bear but I loved this story and the bond of friendship between animal and man.\n\nThe Boy Who Became a Dragon: A Bruce Lee Story by Jim Di Bartolo (ages 9 – 12)\n\nYou don’t have to love martial arts to enjoy this engaging graphic biography about the martial artist and movie star legend Bruce Lee. From his birth in San Francisco to life in Hong Kong during and after the Japanese occupation, then his move back to the U.S., you’ll meet a troubled kid who gets into lots of trouble yet ends up becoming a famous movie star. Lee’s life is fascinating and the author does a great job with all the historical references.\n\nThe Story That Cannot Be Told by J. Kasper Kramer (ages 9 – 12)\n\nDo you know about Romania’s brutal history? Our complex, likable story-loving heroine Ileana lives in Romania under a real-life, evil leader named Ceausescu. During his totalitarian regime, spies were everywhere. Ileana is an ordinary girl who finds joy and solace in stories, especially the folktales her father tells her and the ones she writes and rewrites in her journal.\n\nPaper Wishes by Lois Sepahban (ages 9 – 12)\n\nIt would be hard as an author not to vilify this country for sending thousands of Japanese Americans to prison camps. But this author doesn’t. She just skillfully shares the evocative story of 10-year-old Manami of Washington State, who is sent with her family to a dusty camp, leaving behind her beloved dog, Yujiin, and everything else they owned. Devastated, Manami stops speaking. Her story is painful, sprinkled with hope, and all too real.\n\nA Seed in the Sun by Aida Salazar (ages 9 – 12)\n\nA tender and poignant middle-grade novel in verse showing an important time in history, the power of collective voices against injustices, and a girl finding her strength. Lula’s family are migrant workers. When Lula’s mom gets sick from pesticides, they can only get her medical care if they join the worker strikes started by Phillipino migrant workers. Eventually, her violent dad is convinced to join the strike which transforms their family, gives the girls hope, and helps Lula’s mom get health care.\n\nChains, Forge, Ashes (Seeds of America) by Laurie Halse Anderson (ages 10+)\n\nI’m writing this after just closing Ashes, the final book of this historical fiction series about the time of the Revolutionary War as experienced through the eyes of an African-American girl named Isabel and her friend, Cuzon.
