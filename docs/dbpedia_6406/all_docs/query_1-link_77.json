In this new genre VRMMORPG, he plans on becoming the strongest at all costs. The classes, the races, the starting zones, everything is a mystery in 'New Eden'. This game is coming out without a shred of details. The only thing that was promoted was the freedom of skill choosing. Our protagonist Alexander, gamer tag Astaroth, has always dreamt of becoming an E-Sports athlete. His parents supported his dream, but they are no longer of this world. He fully intends on making it in this new game, if not for him, then at least to honor their memory. With no idea how he wants to play his character, Alexander chooses the most mysterious starting race. Will this be his road to success or his downfall? The game assistant certainly thought the latter. \"Do as you wish, young adventurer. I only wish to add this. Do not come back with complaints when you realize you have made the wrong choice,\" the elf said, looking at him with clear hatred. \"We will see about that,\" Alexander flatly replied. \"I love challenges,\" he added. \"Very well!\" the elf harrumphed. \"Have the adventure of your lifetime, as short as it will last,\" he sarcastically added. Ahead of him lies an uncertain path, filled with trials and hardships. But one thing is clear in his eyes. He will become the strongest player in the game, even if he must step over mountains of corpses to do so. Over are his days of working hard for nothing, it's make or break now! I now have a discord where you can talk with other readers and me. There are also channels to discuss new weapons; characters; classes; or monsters that you might want to design and see incorporated in the story. I will always give credit to the person that created said thing, rest assured.

A short sword pierced his heart, his arms and legs were broken, making him unable to stop the crimson blood from coloring the ground. \"That's what you get for betrayal,\" a red-headed teenage boy sneered as he stood before him. \"A pathetic person like you could never be my brother,\" added a purple-haired girl, her voice seething with anger, as she stood alongside the redhead. With great effort, the young boy shifted his gaze forward. He could see many familiar faces in front of him—his so-called family, his so-called friends but his gaze remained fixed on her. \"Wh..y, A.nna,\" he uttered with immense difficulty and sorrow in his voice, his vision blurring as he locked eyes with the blonde-haired girl, who regarded him with emotionless eyes. \"I did that so I could save you,\" he said, his voice gradually growing louder. \"I DID THAT SO YOU COULD LIVE!\" he shouted, making everyone present flinch in fear. \"I never asked you to do this\" the blonde-haired girl replied, her words crushing the very soul of the boy. \"A...nn.a,\" the young boy whispered one last time, a small tear slipping down from his eye as he breathed his final breath. ================================ Neil survived eight grueling years in a post-apocalyptic world only to die and be reincarnated in the body of Eden Morton, a character from a game he used to play as a teenager, by an unknown entity for unknown reasons. Eden's life was a pitiable one, plagued by the constant manipulation and betrayal of those around him – whether it was the princess, the famed hero, or even his very own family. Eden died without ever experiencing genuine love. Now, as Neil took over, he was determined to embark on a new journey, seeking the one thing he and Eden never had : a life worth living. ================================ [Discord link :- Invite/5Vgw4JCrBW]\n\ndetail\n\nQuick Transmigration : Chased in the Multiverse (BL)\n\n4.82\n\nVOLUME 1: EDEN What are the odds that in every corner of the multiverse, every you would endure a life filled with misery? If you happen to be Eden, those odds stand at a resolute 100%. When Eden's mortal existence came to an end, he anticipated crossing the Nai He bridge to undergo reincarnation. But it seemed that the Gods had different plans in store for him. Instead of that peaceful journey, Eden found himself thrust into Versal, the portal to the vast multiverse, where an uncanny fate awaited. He was compelled to inhabit the bodies of countless Edens, spanning across the myriad universes. Strangely, each one of them led a life marred by suffering and met an untimely demise, mirroring his own tragic past. After traversing a thousand universes, he managed to accumulate enough power to break free from this haunting cycle. From that moment onwards, his mission unfolded—to ensure that every Eden, from every universe would exact their revenge upon those responsible for their shared torment. Who decreed that the Edens were unworthy of a prolonged and joyful existence? Whoever that may be, they were destined to face retribution once Eden had amassed enough strength to track them down. What he hadn't anticipated, however, was the relentless pursuer who dogged his footsteps across the multiverse. The enigmatic question loomed: Why was he being relentlessly pursued, and why did it seem that his pursuer coveted not his life, but his very body? Who, in the vast expanse of realities, was this shameless tofu-eater?

Rhea held his eyes ignoring the feeling to glance at his lips. “And what if I don’t want to.” She said. He smirked and came foward. Her heart raced faster with his presence but she stood her ground. “Then you shall be blamed for whatever happens to the pack.” He said and then he added. “Also, you can not say No to your Alpha.” Rhea looked in to his eyes and she knew that he meant every word of what he said. A pack in time of darkness needs the union of two unlikely people. An arrogant and strong Alpha and a pure, brave and beautiful Human.

A VR game so immersive that many people decided to quit their jobs just to play the game. And there was me, chosen as a beta tester, who never took advantage of this fact, and never played the game before the main release. Believing that I could just buy everything with money, I entered the game and became a very successful man in the early stages. But then, as time went on, people realized, everything you earned in the game could be transferred into reality resulting in The Garden Corporation controlling the world. And I, who had bought everything my avatar owned, quickly became a piece of garbage in this new world. Finally finding myself in a slave camp, forced to mine for ores 24/7 in the game, I eventually died from overwork. But, when I opened my eyes, I found myself back to the day I first got chosen as a beta tester. --- Discord Link: https://discord.gg/8ePQESSSHT All names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this story are purely fictitious.
