We attempt to test many versions of games, however there are occasionally problems with other languages.\n\nClick on the game name to view the complete notes of a game.\n\nThis is the compatibility of the current development version, not of a stable release (Please see one of the following for the Compatibility charts of the stable releases: )\n\nAs this is the status of the development version, occasional temporary bugs may be introduced with new changes, thus this list refects the 'best case' scenario. It is highly recommended to use the latest stable release, where possible.\n\nNote: ScummVM does not include any games. To play one of the game listed on this page you will need to have your own copy of the game and add it to ScummVM. Some games are available for free on our Game downloads page. For other games see the Where to get the games page on our wiki. For information on how to add games to ScummVM see the documentation."
