        "text": "I've read Paradise Lost. It's one of my favorite books, taking the established doctrine of religion and playing around with it to come up with a unique story.\n\nThis story does something similar, but it advances the concept into the modern era.\n\nLiterary Note: First off, the idea that is established that going against social taboos causes sin, and that causes sin to bloom, invoking imagery of the first man created from ash and dust (at least, in many religious narratives of the creation mythos) instantly brings to mind the fact that this author knows what they are doing with interweaving expansive concepts that help to encompass and define the human experience into their story.\n\nCharacter Score: The characters are believable. They are understandable. They are relatable. Caught up in a situation beyond their comprehension that they must very quickly adapt to. The only reason I marked it as 4.5/5 is because I feel that there might be a bit too much character bloat at the start. This is quickly resolved (read to see what I mean), but some of the extraneous characters that are initially beginning to be fleshed out could be mentioned in some passing lines instead of dedicating dialogue to them.\n\nStyle Score: The story is written in a POV shifting style where we jump between two primary characters. The interwoven biblical references stand out to those who are familiar with the Christian religion (even passingly familiar, you'll pick up the cadence of some of the speech and how it aligns with verses). I believe, very strongly, that the style is unique and has an authentic voice that builds a sense of curiosity tempered with exposition.\n\nGrammar Score: I found no errors of note. Spelling, Grammar, Diction (word choice) are all on-point.\n\nStory Score: I really think that this could become an amazing novel that joins some literary classics if given enough polish. I mentioned Paradise Lost by Milton at the start of my review, because I truly can see the similarities between the two. This is like a spiritual successor to that story.\n\nThe chapters are meaty and have lots of content. I think that the story is worth a read. I encourage and recommend it highly."
