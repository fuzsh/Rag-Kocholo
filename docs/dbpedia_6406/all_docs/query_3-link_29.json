        "text": "Start by reading the diary and decide if you want to add an entry to it. It doesn't seem to affect anything as of now, but it might in part 3. Exit the house (or check the barrels for loot first). A villager appears and informs Luka that the lumberjack has been kidnapped! Naturally, your next location is the Iliasville Mountains.\n\nUnless you're on Paradox difficulty pre-2.0, the Slime Girls here shouldn't be a problem until they start appearing in groups of 2 or more (as they can use their bind to stop you for 2 turns). When low on HP, head to the spring in the center to rest up. When you feel like you can take on 3 slimes safely, head to the top. With 2.0 this will generally be at level 2, or 3 on Paradox.\n\nYou encounter a shrunken Ilias along the way, but she runs off. You then fight Bunny Slime along two normal slimes. After you beat them up, the lumberjack thanks you and heads back, and so do you... but you run into Alice. She asks if you've seen a rabbit. She wont leave until you say yes.\n\nShe heads up to the summit and begins to beat up the Bunny Rabbit. Talk to her again to cause her to leave. A cutscene occurs, and you're be teleported back to Iliasville.\n\nHead up to the temple, talk to Sonya, and watch the cutscene. Heading out, Sonya tells you that Alice and Ilias are fighting in your inn.\n\nThis is where the game splits.\n\nAlice has many races she can pick from, while Ilias only has the Angel race. Ilias is much more useful early on, as she has AoE Holy attacks, which always hit their target and deal high damage to monsters, whom make up most of the enemies of part 1. Alice will be better late game because she has access to more races and jobs, but requires more farming to be effective. Either way, whomever you pick here will be with you until you start a New Game+.\n\nWhomever you picked wonders if you should say goodbye to the village chief. This is not required, but skipping it has consequences (detailed below).\n\nIf you choose to visit the chief, you'll get a key to the storage room and can ask the chief and his wife about various things. Go up to the roof of the house to get some treasures. After you leave, Sonya forces her way into the party. A mysterious person chases after the party and triggers another cutscene once he reaches you. If you try to run away from him (by crossing the bridge), this mysterious person stops time to reach the group (and you get an achievement). After commenting about how weird the encounter is, Sonya mentions that she can hear a slime girl crying.\n\nYou are now free to leave, but it's a good idea to first visit the storage room (which has treasures chests with useful items), talk to Lazarus and go take care of the slime.\n\nIf you didn't visit the chief, you won't recruit Sonya and hence can't talk to Lazarus (though she'll be forced into the party later, at the entrance of Snow Cave) or obtain the Pocket Castle (though if you're on NG+, previously recruited monsters may be added from the maid next to the Head Priest that appears after naturally obtaining four or more party members, this becomes the norm temporarily if one is aiming for the \"Sonya's Bizarre Adventure\" achievement)\n\nMoving on, talking to the man in the alley has him mention a person by the name of Amira, who is a well known informant that may have the answer to where the White Rabbit went.\n\nHe says that she was spotted by the fountain. Unfortunately, she isn't there.\n\nThe girl there will tell you that Amira went to the blacksmith. Surprisingly, she's not there.\n\nThe soldier nearby will say that Amira went to buy a weapon from the weapon shop.\n\nStill not there but asking around reveals that she tried to earn money from the gambler in the back alleyway.\n\nAnd, once again, to no one's surprise, she isn't there. Apparently, she went to the Ilias Temple to change jobs. Head back there and speak to the head priest. He'll mention that he hasn't seen her. Take this time to also switch out any jobs or races that you may have mastered, as any Job EXP gained will be wasted otherwise. Speak to the first person again (the man in the alley), and he will say that he saw Amira being captured by bandits! These bandits are located west of Iliasburg, in the Irina Mountains. They're in the northern cave, not the southern cave. We will head south later.\n\nEntering the cave, the party is stopped by a Goblin Girl. Talking to her, the camera pans to show the three tombstones behind her - an ominous sign for what's about to happen...\n\nIn the following battle, Goblin Girl does high amounts of damage and will most likely be the first battle that'll require proper tactics. She'll run away after being defeated, so explore the cave for \"Treasures\" such as a Sickle and Antidote Grass.\n\nBlocking the stairway to the next floor, Tiny Lamia appears! She has a dangerous but low accuracy party-wide hitting attack as well as an instakill for Luka should he get bound. However, she is weak to Ice, so any one with ice attacks like black mages should use it on her. She'll also run away after being defeated.\n\nThere's a barrel of food next to the staircase that will fully heal your party, so use it before proceeding.\n\nNext up, a Vampire Girl! She has a very annoying move that'll continue to be a problem later in the form of Demon Eyes of Seduction. If not resisted, it'll force anyone under its effects to attack Luka with sexual attacks. It lasts for about 3 turns, so instead of waiting for it to wear off, switch out anyone affected into the backup party. After defeating her, she too runs off.\n\nFinally, all that remains of the bandits is Dragon Pup. She is the most dangerous of the four, with an attack that deals high damage, hits the entire party, and may inflict Burn. However, she's weak to Pleasure-type attacks. If you are having problems with her physical-based attacks, Blinding her will help with that. Note that defeating her will teleport you out of the cave, so be sure you're ready to leave before doing so. The green chest in the back requires Lockpick II, and contains a Breath Scroll.\n\nThe bandits are brought together and asked where Amira went, but they have no clue. They're forced to apologize to the villagers, whom accept and give each of them jobs. You may return to recruit each of them by talking to them and asking them to join your party, but apart from the Goblin Girl, the other three require side quests to recruit them. In addition, Vanilla and Papi both have a questline that spans the entire story after being recruited.\n\nVanilla's questline is listed here, and Papi's questline is listed here. Teeny requires the party to bring back the missing harpies - a tall order for the current team. After going though that, the party sleeps in the Sutherland Inn for basically free! This is instead of the usual 100,000 gold per night - however, you get an achievement for doing the latter, although waiting to reach NG+ beforehand is advised. Walking outside, an Unfortunate Lamia appears!\n\nChoose between being nice, or just murdering her. Don't worry, she comes back if you kill her. This is Amira. The party asks her for info on the rabbit, but she says that info is worth 1500 gold which the party may or may not have at the time. She can't give it out for free either, but the party can convince her to let them do a quest that will allow her to share the information. Should the party pay the money, the following side quest can still be taken by talking to her in the Pocket Castle.\n\nUpon entering the Tartarus south of Iliasville, the party spots the White Rabbit jumping right down the hole while muttering that she's late. The party chases after her, climbing down on the ladder... only to find themselves in an eerie location.\n\nYou will now encounter Apoptosis as enemies: Sully, Jaide, and Shesta. Apoptosis monsters are highly resistant to damage and status effects, and it'll take some serious firepower to take down them down.\n\nOpening one of the chests on the first floor will also provide the team with their first glimpse of \"Makina\", a move set of highly powerful skills that generally don't miss their target. In this case, the Auto Crossbow hits all targets with a good scaling of 400% Dexterity. In order to use it, you need to head back up and talk to the person next to the entrance, who'll give you a Machina License to become an Engineer. Feel free to make Ilias or anyone with a good Dex scaling into an Engineer.\n\nHeading downwards, the party encounters a strange door... Ilias recognizes it - its a door that separates dimensions. Very few people should be able to see them... And yet, it opens when Luka leans on it. Surprised, the party enters an otherworldly area.\n\nTalking to the nearby \"people\", the party finds that this area is actually a corroded Remina! The people talk as if the area isn't being corrupted by purple veins, and after talking to one of the townsmen, they transform into a Shesta. Exploring the nearby building, the party run into a mysterious creature... who suddenly attack them!\n\nShe's a boss, and can deal high amounts of damage in a short period of time. Not only that, but she can also heal herself if she connects her Tentacle Drain. However, she's weak to Lightning and at least one person in your party (Ilias, Rami etc.) should be capable of dealing lightning damage.\n\nDefeat her, leave and reenter the house and talk to her to recruit her.\n\nOnce you're finished, exit through the north wall until... You're suddenly in space? It's apparently an area between worlds, a dimensional corridor. Following a bridge, the party decide to go through a white magic circle... only to realize that they went back to where they started... or so it seems.\n\nThe White Rabbit shows up, allowing you to talk to her... Or just ignore her precious advice and die three seconds later.\n\nShe's surprised that Luka and his companions made it here and congratulates them. After some back and forth, she vanishes, but not without a warning that stepping off the path might attract beings that think walking on the soil is beneath them.\n\nLeave the area, and make sure you don't step off the road! Do so, and you'll run into either Archangel Ranael or Principality Nagael who will promptly one shot you with an attack that hits the entire party for hundreds of damage. In part 1, they could be beaten with enough firepower, but their health was multiplied by 10 once part 2 was released (from 18,000 to 180,000).\n\nAnyway, there's only one place you can go to - Iliasville. However, the town was destroyed, with skeletons littering the ground. In the graveyard, you'll find Sonya's tombstone. And, next to it, Luka's grave with his diary on top.\n\nIn this world, Luka met Granberia at Iliasburg but decided to not confront her and return home. Years later, angels attacked, and Luka was killed in their second attack. The final entry is of an unknown person, writing that Luka was a true hero before falling. Distressed, Alice/Ilias attempts to warp home using a Harpy Feather, but this does nothing. Luka tries to use a Harpy Feather instead and it works. After seeing such an atrocity, the party decides to hold a meeting in regards to what was seen in the depths of the first Tartarus Luka and friends explored...\n\nHeading northeast of the Harpy Tower, you'll reach Midas Village, where you can get Gold gear... if you get some gold ore to craft them !\n\nHowever, the place is infested with Slug Girls! They aren't really harming anyone though, but there are really too many of them. Head north to the house with the maid outside and enter. Talk to the person inside to discover that she had taken care of the slugs beforehand, however she is now too old to do this again. Agree to help, and she'll give you a couple Slime Guards.\n\nThe Slug Tower is westward. The enemies here are slugs, as you might expect. They're weak to Lightning and resistant to Physical, so once again Ilias proves to be useful. The bow skill Land-Dweller Killer will also do wonders, as slugs are Land-Dwellers.\n\nAt the top, the Sluggy Stars reside, making more and more slugs. They are your target and can be quite difficult. For starters, they have 3 actions per turn. Thankfully, their attacks aren't too dangerous by themselves, but if they all hit the same target, the battle might tilt in their favor quickly. Their attacks mostly deal pleasure damage making Imps a solid choice for this bossfight. Finish them off and the problem is solved!\n\nIn order to recruit them, raise the affection of a slug from the tower (High Slug or Slug Nun) to 100 and bring the Slug Medal to the Sluggy Slimes to recruit them.\n\nBack at Midas Village, talk to the retired maid to obtain a job change item to become a Maid, which has one of the best abilities in the form of Job EXP Up, reducing the amount of time needed to level up jobs and races.\n\nNow with better gear and more experience, the party should be able to get though the Rostrum Mountain Caves, which is the path that leads to the ruined town of Rostrum. Bring some fire resistance or people with Fire attacks here, as the Candle Girls here can appear in groups of 4 and can damage the entire party with fire attacks.\n\nPassing though the area, the party may rest in the ruined town or head right for the Tartarus Pit. Unlike the previous pit, there isn't anyone camping at the entrance. Passing downwards, the party comes across a strange site - what appears to be a forest has merged into the surrounding walls. Apparently bits and pieces of other dimensions were combined when the Tartarus Pit appeared.\n\nEventually, the team will find themselves yet again in another part of Remina. However, the party notices a person that isn't one of the Apoptosis. She also spots the party and retreats into a house. Following her, the party discovers that she is Promestein. Hearing how the party managed to get to her, she wishes to join them and to dissect Luka's brain should he fall in battle. Accept or don't, but certain sidequests are locked out if you haven't recruited her at least once, including several that increase your race change options drastically.\n\nEntering yet another passageway, the party finds themselves back in a dimension corridor. Wondering if it will lead to the same world as before, the party proceeds further. After seeing life around them and no sign of angels, the party heads to the only place they can go: the town of Rostrum.\n\nUpon entering the town, the party is stopped by a villager, telling Luka \"Welcome back Marcellus!\".\n\nConfused, Luka asks when was the last time Marcellus had come. He came twice before - once a month ago with two companions and looking carefree, and a week ago without his companions and bearing a seasoned veteran's look. He had stopped by to give a letter to the village chief along with a warning to get out of the town while they still could. But, the letter was addressed to a young boy by the name of Luka...\n\nThe chief's house is the one south of the entrance. Talk to the man to discover that Marcellus, much like Luka, can also go to other dimensions and had left this letter in case Luka followed. The letter in question directs Luka to the hidden village of Enrika, which is located west of Iliasville inside the Lost Woods.\n\nBefore leaving, enter the house with the tree in front of it and talk to the man inside. He'll prepare a meal and lament that he never had a disciple. He says that he'll bury the Chef’s License under the tree. Luka wonders if the chef in their world did the same thing... Return to the ruined village to find a Chef’s License buried under that tree.\n\nHeading northwards, you should now be able to fight off the hoards of Centaurs that would have one-shot you had you decided to head past the bridge. After a short camp, the party makes it to Iliasport! The building on your right is the university, and if you have the elven medicine, you can talk to the doctor to give it to him, allowing access to the upper floors where a character willing to give you a flamethrower and a flux emitter is located. The Battle Fuckers here give job change items for defeating them, Nurse and Scholar respectively, so return later to get them. Talk to the sailor to discover that due to a storm, all ships are delayed. The party is unsure what to do, but suddenly Nero shows up and tells everyone that an item called Poseidon’s Bell can help. It's in the Cave of Treasures, west of Iliasport, and is rumored to be a fox den now.\n\nThe cave contains two types of kitsunes, and is also when you start encountering Mimics. Mimics appear to be normal chests and trying to open them pulls you into an inescapable battle - as they're extremely powerful at this point in the game, be careful when opening chests. At the end of the cave you discover Nanabi guarding the door. You must fight her to proceed! However, you get only one turn to attack her, and it is highly unlikely that you'll deal the over 30,000 damage needed to defeat her. Do so, and you'll get her rewards twice and an alternate scene. Anyway, a voice scolds Luka for being weak, before a Vaporizing Rebellion Sword utterly destroys Nanabi. A mysterious girl shows up, saving the party and introducing herself as Neris. Soon after, Tamamo shows up, says that she cant unseal Nanabi, before Neris points out that isn't Tamamo. Instead, White Rabbit shows herself, declares Neris to be in the way, and freezes time. Right before impact, mysterious guy shows up and blocks the attack, then drags the White Rabbit elsewhere. Neris invites Luka onto a date, is denied, and leaves. Nanabi will be in shock, and if the party is strong enough (you won't be for some time), the party can challenge her to recruit her. Raiding the treasure room, the party gets the Poseidon's Bell, and can return outside by interacting with the ladder.\n\nAfter forging gear or not, the King tells the party to go to Luddite Village. Head there and speak to the priest of the town (Inside the house near the cabbage farm). If you had come here before, he had been like the other residents - highly xenophobic. However, he is a double agent, and asks you to meet up in the western woods. Do so, and continue walking though the area. The entrance to a cave will show up, and the guard will allow passage. There are no monsters inside, and the priest will give information about the mission as you walk though the area. Finally, you'll come to another entrance with the King in front of it. Speak to him and enter...\n\nFor a second, you might think you walked into another Tartarus Pit, judging from the advanced technology. However, the ever-present purple corruption isn't there. The King speaks more about the area, called the Ancient Temple Ruins, as you progress through the area. After a few detours, the party will reach what appears to be the center area. There is a capsule here, holding a robotic person inside. The King calls her \"Sleeping Beauty\" as nothing they've done to her has woken her up. The king will then sit down and prepare to run maintenance on his body. Meanwhile, Luka, after hearing how much of the King's body had been blasted away from the bomb, accidentally falls onto the capsule's control panel. And what do you know? The person inside opens their eyes, steps out, and speaks. Concluding from her orders to only awaken if the world is in danger, she begins to shift to battle phase against the party, whom she thinks if gonna destroy the world. The King, having also gone into battle form, offers to help.\n\nThe battle against Brynhildr is quite dangerous, with attacks that don't miss, hit the entire party, or hit 5 times. If you feel that she's too strong, come back after you grind out a few levels or gain stronger gear. Defeating her, the party manages to recruit her to their cause after convincing her that they're trying to save the world. If you have recruited Promestein, you can return here for her side quest. Afterwards, the King asks for another favor - the haunted house west of the castle has taken in dozens of highly trained soldiers who've gone to investigate it, and the King wishes for the party to go and uncover what's going on.\n\nEast of Saloon, the final Tartarus Pit of part 1 is found, surrounded by a massive poison swamp. Despairing engineers and solders can be found here, wondering if their king is still down there... Climb down the ladder and explore the area, and take note of the cracks of the world being returned to chaos as you pass through. Finally, go though the dimensional door to enter a ruined world... both Sylph and Gnome discover that their respective elements are dead, and as far as the eye can see, only the pitch black of true nothingness can be found. The only place that can be entered is the Administrator's Tower east of here.\n\nOnce you enter the tower, a small robot introduces herself as Radio. When asked about where everyone has gone, a soul crushing reply is given - humans, monsters, and angels have all gone extinct, having either been killed off by the Apoptosis, committed suicide or were transformed into Apoptosis and put down. The only things left are beings like Radio: robots and artificial monsters, as well as her master. Radio advises the party to hurry and meet up with her master up on the 4th floor, and then hurries off. Don't be too hasty however, head to the basement and beat down the 17 Honey Pots that are found there for small medals and Job XP. Then, as you ascend the tower, enter every room and look at the flashbacks of the people that once lived within.\n\nOnce you reach the top, you may no longer return. Saving is disabled as well. Once you're done opening all the chests, talk to Radio's master, who introduces herself as La Croix. She is the final survivor of this ruined world, but even as they speak, an Apoptosis of the highest order to coming to erase the world. She gives you her notes as the high class Apoptosis reaches the third floor. With merely a few minutes before she reaches the room where the party is, La Croix tells them to return to their world and use her notes to make sure they won't end up like her world. She will stay behind and safeguard their escape. As the party leaves, she asks them to take Radio along, then prepares herself for battle. The Apoptosis, named Adramelech, appears seconds after the party leaves and coldly announces the erasure of anything in her way...\n\nThe party appears back on the first floor, but already you can see the devastating effect of Adramelech, as the world has already been corroded so much that there's only one way out. Follow the path, while Radio gives news on how La Crox is faring. Half way though, Radio drops the new that she can not detect La Crox's energy anymore... but the party presses on. A few steps from the exit, Adramelech appears in front of the party. However, she isn't unscathed after her battle with La Crox, having suffered enough damage to only be fighting at 10% of her full power. This... this is it. The final battle of part 1.\n\nAdramelech can be pretty easy if you are playing on Normal or lower, but is dangerous on higher difficulties. Her attacks deal massive damage and can hit the entire party. She is immune to most status effects except for Slow/Stop and Seduce/Incontinence. But since Seduce and Incontinence only have a 2% chance of working, don't bother trying them. However, Stop will lock her in place for quite a few turns, and with a 50% chance of the spell working, it might be a good idea if you have any time mages. She has no weaknesses, and is immune to Sonic and Bio, so focus on Physical attacks. Remember, the fate of the world resides on you.\n\nOnce you finally defeat her, she slowly vanishes into the nothingness while the party makes a mad dash to escape. However, disaster strikes as Adramelech appears once again, intending to drag Luka into chaos with her. But, there is a flash of light as something bisects Adramelech and takes her off your back for now. It's Marcellus, Luka's father, but he looks considerably different from how Luka remembers him. He asks Luka to protect his world, while he'll protect the rest as he walks into another world. As the party basks in the afterglow, every member announces their renewed determination to make sure their world will not fall into chaos... and the credits roll if you only have part 1.\n\nFree feel to skip this if you came directly from part 1, unless you haven't played in a long time. Alice/Ilias will ask if the party needs to call a meeting to talk about what's happened so far. After reading though or skipping the text, the party is told that the blockage that was preventing the way forward has been removed from the Marle Grand Corridor. This is located north of Luddite Village. Enter and make your way over to the next town: Port Marle. Upon entering, the party learns that the entire area has been locked down by the local Marines. Asking the sailor down by the docks has him tell you that all ships are being prevented from departing due to the war, but perhaps if you talk to the admiral she'll let you through. To do so, you need to talk to the vice admiral, who is stealing fish. She'll give you a pass to Navy Headquarters. Return to the sailor and show him the pass to be transported. Head inside the building and go to the second floor to meet with Leviathan, who promises a ship if you assist with arresting the Fishy Pirates. The party then walks outside and are told by a Dog Girl to follow her. She'll take you to a small boat who'll quickly row you over to a ship.\n\nUpon landing, the party is greeted by Ashel. It turns out these are the Fishy Pirates! But, they aren't here to fight, they just want to talk to you, and wish to show you around. Walk all the way down to the third floor and talk to... the captain...? Nah, its just a Nekomata sitting in their chair. The real captain, Bonnie, is on a floor above, stuffing her face in with food. Hearing the party's problems, she offers her ship if you help her recover the pirate queen Roza's treasure from the Grand Pirate's Cave. Wanting you to decide on your own, they dump you back at Navy Headquarters. This is another place where you can choose which side to pick. On one side, the Pirate route gives you a lot of items at the start, while the Navy will give you rewards every so often as you progress through the story. In order to pick a side, head left to the boat for the Navy, and head right and talk to the pirate to join the pirates. Either way, they both will head to the Grand Pirate's Cave, but the main enemy will change based on your side.\n\nOn the Navy route, you first head to the MS Fish and conduct a raid. Making your way down to the captain's room, the group finds a note with the Great Pirate's Cave circled, and makes an assumption that the rest of the pirates fled to it.\n\nOn the pirate's route, you head to the cave first.\n\nEither way, make your way through the caves, fighting off pirates or marines as you journey towards the treasure. On the navy route, you'll fight Bonnie and Ashel, but on the pirate route you'll just open the chest and find a dark rapier.\n\nAfter capturing Bonnie and Ashel, Leviathan will give you the MS Fish for your boat as well as allow access to the storage room. Tatsuko and Stacy will also join the party for good, and will tell you when you can return and get more supplies. Be sure to check the back room to get an Ocean Business Permit.\n\nOn the other hand, the pirate route will have you attack the Navy Headquarters after the cave. Fight off the marines as you make your way upstairs to the flag room. Feel free to raid the supply room as well. You'll get an Ocean Business Permit as well as a pirate flag. Leave now, unless you feel that you can take on Leviathan, who is the first super boss of part 2. She can be challenged on a navy route as well, in case you were wondering, and taking her down is a necessary step in her recruitment.\n\nSign up for the Queen Cup by heading westwards while in Grand Noah. Head up and into the building to talk to the person behind the counter. As stated before, once you sign up you cannot back out, so be fully prepared. The party battles against boring enemies over the course of three days, and are now in the last three fights. Between every fight, you get a chance to rearrange your party, buy items, or forge gear. Anyway, your first playable battle puts you against Dark Elves, who have not improved since the last time you saw them back near Enrika... Wipe them out and you get to fight Dullahan. She is pretty much a warm-up boss, as she attacks twice a turn but is pretty fragile. Next up, after fighting a trio of previously fought beast monsters, Cerberus steps up to the challenge. As a beast, she is very weak against pleasure attacks, so stomp her into the ground using these and move on to the finals.\n\nWhile in the waiting room, Mephisto shows up and hints that the party won't be winning as Kyuba, winner of every tournament she's entered in, might be showing up. With that, she vanishes, leaving the party to worry. When the party sees the final person they need to defeat, they're certainly surprised. Alice/Ilias certainly recognize Kyuba, as she is Alma Elma. After some teasing, she begins the fight and gets \"beaten\" by the party. Afterwards, Hild scans and declares that Alma Elma has only been using only 7% of her power. Suddenly, Mephisto reappears, bringing with her a surprise guest... Granberia. She wants Alma Elma to return to the Monster Lord's Castle and serve under the returned Alice XV, but Alma Elma wants nothing to do with it. In turn, Granberia points her sword towards Alma Elma and the party, ready to cut both down. Alma Elma joins the party for this battle, and will be doing almost all the damage on your first playthough. Alma Elma can easily subdue Granberia with her pleasure skills, and afterwards both Mephisto and Granberia retreat. Alma Elma forfeits the match and gives the party the championship!\n\nAfter returning to the Queen, she mentions that Mephisto has holed herself up in her Magical Academy north of Grand Noah, and would like the party to apprehend her while she fills out the paperwork for the party to be granted permission to Esta. On your way out, however, you are stopped by Arthur and Caesar, who both want the party's power to solve some problems.\n\nFollowing the road west into the forest, the party enters into Plansect Village. Upon doing so, the party is mistaken for insect reinforcements and attacked by Alra Arum and Alra Rooty. After forcing them back, the party is taken to Alra Priestess and learn that after Alice the XVIIth stopped the war, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca reignited it by fighting each other and respectively asking for the support of insect and plant monsters.\n\nFor the best outcome, answer them that you cannot decide at this time. Alice/Ilias will be somewhat impressed at your thinking, and that you should hear both sides of the story indeed.\n\nSo, leave the village and head south east into the mountains. You'll reach Red Mountain, where the insects have retreated too. Fighting your way up to the top, Queen Bee awaits. Talking to her reveals that the Insects are actually fine living on Red Mountain, but since the war has gone on this long, it might be impossible to reconcile. Luka disagrees, and vows to talk sense into Alra Priestess.\n\nReturn to Plansect Village and talk to Alra Priestess, who agrees, However, Tezcatlipoca shows up and throws a hissy fit. After you defeat her, she complains that her fight with Quetzalcoatl had weakened her. Having a bad feeling, Alra Priestess joins the party for a short time and you will be taken to the top of Red Mountain. Here Queen Bee is being pushed back by Quetzalcoatl, and is surprised yet happy that Alra Priestess showed up to help her. After the battle, Tezcatlipoca shows up and the party tenses up, thinking that she will join up with Quetzalcoatl and stomp the party... only for the two to fly off into the distance fighting under everyone's aghast gaze.\n\nAfterwards, talking to either of the leaders allows you to recruit them.\n\nEntering Grangold, an Ant Girl walks over to investigate the party. Sensing trouble if she alerts anyone, Luka pretends to be charmed by mumbling \"My queen...\". Head over to the bar again to discover your last contact: Lazarus and Merlin! They're just as surprised as you are. Talk to Lazarus once you're ready. Various places in the city will be bombed while the party sneaks into Grangold Palacethrough the sewers. You'll be stuck here for a bit, and once you complete this quest the monsters here won't be encountered until later in the game, so recruit them now. Pass through the sewers until you find a ladder heading upwards. Lazarus and Merlin will exit the party to fend off the Grangold King who showed up from behind.\n\nThe entire castle appears to have been turned into a prison... Fight off the Kitsune guards and head to the second floor to meet Queen Ant, stuck in a cell. If you have Ilias on your team, she'll attack her, but Alice will not. She's not a hard fight, but is pretty sturdy. Either way, she sadly sulks in the corner afterwards. Head downwards into the throne room to discover Lilith! The party concludes that she must be the mastermind, but the latter tells her that even brainwashing a whole country is too much for her, hence why she got support from... Tamamo? She's nothing like the Tamamo you met in Yamatai Village. After she stomps the team, the local one shows up, heals the team, and unseals herself. While she duels herself, the party fights off Lilith. It's another succubus boss fight, but the only real dangerous move she has is her Demon Eyes of Climax, so remove people weak against it.\n\nAfterwards, it appears that the local Tamamo will lose as her seal will expire. Then Nero and Neris appear from subspace! The mere shockwaves from the battle are overbearing, and the castle begins to collapse. The party barely makes it out... and everyone else is also fine. As the war is finally over, it is time for all the leaders to make peace....\n\nHeading back to Gold Port, a strange lady stops you at the entrance. She was wondering if the party could help her with a small problem. Saying yes has her take you back to her house and explain that there is a ship that she wants to party to escort her to. If they want to help, they should meet her at the docks. Do so, and she rows the party over to the Ghost Ship.\n\nLazarus and Merlin can be found at the bar, and can be recruited by talking to them. They open up the Pocket Casino, where you can get an advanced job change item if you either have the money or the luck to gain 3000 coins. Alternatively, Lazarus having gambling luck III, you can use him to scam his own casino and get late part 2 equipment right now.\n\nThere aren't any ghost monsters here, only sea ones, but the atmosphere certainly would make you feel like one would appear. Head down to the third floor, then outside to find a key that will open a door into the captain's room. Inside are the 3 last Beelzebubs. This is really tough fight, as each of the Beelebubs can use AoE attacks alongside a unique attack. Take them in the order B -> C -> A, and you should be fine. They vanish into a cloud of flies and escape afterwards. Then, head though the wall on your left to find the key to the treasure room, raid everything and then leave. On the way back Selene revels that she's actually a ghost, and vanishes.\n\nHowever, if you head back to her house, she's still there and is worried about where the Beelzebubs went. A cutscene is played of them heading to Grangold, then to Yamatai. Head to Yamatai and talk to them, and they along with Selene will join the party. At this point, you can recruit Leviathan if you have bested her in battle.\n\nHead over to the inn and talk to either Heinrich of Alicetromeria to start a cutscene. Luka will explain that the party comes from 500 years in the future. Suddenly, Luka gets an emergency communication that the capitals of the world, Grangold, Grand Noah, Sabasa, and San Ilia are under attack! Hearing this, Luka takes out a harpy feather and teleports right to Grand Noah, where he sees various elves and fairies attacking the town. On the Alice route, Alicetroemeria will have come along for the ride, and joins the party. Run about and save various people while fighting off a Gigantic Girl, Elf Amazoness, Carbuncle Girls and Trick Fairies for additional rewards. When you're done, its time to take down the leader - Queen Fairy. After defeating her, the elven army retreats. However, there is no time to waste! The order doesn't matter, but you'll need to head to the other three capitals.\n\nIn San Ilia, it's the mermaid race whom have invaded. Apart from the mermaids you've already seen, the army also contains Mermaid Generals, Mermaid Knights, and a lone Lorelei, who is guarding the commander - El. Defeating the Lorelei, El is frightened by some Makina that explodes near her, and gets kicked backwards into the fountain square, where the party can confront her. Like with Queen Fairy, her defeat causes the mermaid army to leave with her.\n\nIn Sabasa, vampires have descended. Sara will leave the party if she's in it, and fight her own battles off scene. As for enemies you'll fight? The regular Vampire can be found, as well as the more dangerous Conquista, Vendetta and an Elder Vampire. There are two commanders here, Carmilla and Elizabeth. You fight Carmilla first, as Elizabeth heads off to command the army ahead. When you find Sara, she's surrounded by vampires, and Elizabeth taunts her. However, Sara merely smirks and transforms into her succubus form that you fought back in part 1, but she has control over it. She'll request to rejoin the party, and you'll fight Elizabeth. With both defeated, the vampires flee.\n\nIn Grangold, spiders of all sizes have emerged. You'll fight a group of three Arachne that are surrounding a Golem Girl, but they are the only new spiders that are wandering around. However, as you approach the bridge that leads to the castle, a small mini boss rush will occur, as you'll fight a Tsuchigumo then two Arachne Lords. As soon as they fall, the Spider Princess, who is leading the army, is annoyed that she can't seem to find the King at all. Then, someone in the army comes out from the castle reports that the castle already seems to be destroyed. There is a sound of a door opening nearby, and the King of Grangold steps out for some fresh air, having awoken from his nap. He sees the spider army that is ravaging his city, and in a fit of rage, teleports to one wing of the army and vaporizes them all. Seeing his power, the Spider Princess teleports down there and begins fighting. Meanwhile, an Atlach-Nacha appears to stop the heroes. When your battle is over, the Spider Princess sounds a retreat, seeing that they would lose the fight if they continued. The King teleports in front of you and asks to join the party, wanting revenge.\n\nAfter fending off all of the queens, Luka and co are pulled into a meeting to decide what to do next. The plan is for Luka and party to strike back at the queens, defeating each of them in turn while his companion asks the human lords to search for more information on the Six Orbs to awaken the Garuda Girl. To do so, the leaders have opened up the Navy Headquarters' gate that allows access to the open sea. Your goal is clear...\n\nYou can complete these in any order that you want, but the listed order is the recommended path according to how they're listed in the monsterpedia.\n\nDirectly east of Mimic Island, you'll run into two islands. One has the World Tree on it, but you are barred from entering further. The other island is the one you want to head to. The Fairy's Island as you might expect, is where the Elves and Fairies that invaded Grand Noah live. Head inside and take either path to reach the center of the island and confront Queen Elf. However, upon defeating her, a Dark Dryad and Walraune shows up. The Walraune attacks the party, since Luka discovered that the Queen Elf was actually under a mind control spell that is coming from the world tree. Defeating her, the Dryad remarks that the party is still strong even after defeating the Queen Elf and retreats back to the world tree. The Queen Elf is thankful for the help and the shopkeeper and blacksmith to the left of her open their services. You can head to the World Tree now for a side quest, which will be mentioned after this section.\n\nNext up, Lyra Falls is far west of Esta, and is the place where the Mermaids are hiding. As you progress though the caves, talk to El, who is having second thoughts about the war. After passing though 3 areas, you'll meet Queen Mermaid. She, of course, attacks the party. But, after being forced back, El leaps out of the water and pleads for her mom to stop fighting. After a brief second, she agrees and also asks the party to take care of El, who joins the party. At this point, if you have the sealed Kraken, head outside and then back inside to talk with Queen Mermaid. After pestering her enough, she unseals her, and she joins the party.\n\nNow its time for spiders... Unlike the rest of the queens, Spider Princess is not in the Open Sea area. Instead, she resides in The Secluded Lands which are directly north of the massive Tartarus Hole in the inner seas. Take out the guard at the entrance and begin to explore this chain of islands filled with spiders. At the end, Spider Princess awaits. Knocking some sense into her, she calls off the attack because she falls in love with Luka... which Sonya is not happy with, even as she looks forward to marrying him by prepping up future wedding arrangements. This opens up a side quest to recruit her later.\n\nFinally, the vampires are holed up in Vampire Castle, which is on a small island next to Hellogondo. Enter, and search around. If you decide to head upstairs, you'll quickly find that you can't advance - there's a magical barrier that teleports the party if they walk a certain distance. Next is downstairs, where you'll find Carmilla sleeping in her coffin. Disturb her and beat her to up to have her cough up some Vampire Tears which will disable that barrier. At the end of the hallway Elizabeth is guarding the entrance into the throne room. If you try to walk past her, she gets annoyed and demands that the party fights her. Do so and then meet Queen Vampire. You know the drill by this point, one beating coming up. She admits the party's power, then commands Carmilla and Elizabeth to join the party. Recruiting her require additional work and being quite far in Vanilla's merchant sidequest.\n\nAfterwards, head to each of the rulers and tell them that you've defeated the Queens and receive an Advanced Job change item from each. After talking to the last one, everyone throws a party! Nothing could go wrong now...\n\nIf you've been doing all the side quests so far, there should only be 3 left to get, the Red, Blue and Yellow Orbs. In case you have other orbs to collect, the ones that you should be missing would be the Selene side quest (For the Purple Orb), Meia's side quest (To get the ball of Guidance to head to Poseidoness and then beating her up for the Silver Orb). The Green orb was for winning the Queen cup, and you had to do that anyway. So, where are the rest? One is in the hands of the Elf Princess, who has never come out the hidden elf village at all. The other Is with Sphinx, and the last one was with Kraken. Lets do these in order.\n\nFor the elf, head back to Queen Elf and talk to her. As the queen, she can get in touch with any of the elves, and asks the princess to give it over. Before she does, she wants to see the hero that everyone has been talking about, and when Queen Elf mentally sends a picture of Luka over to her, she falls in love in seconds. She promises to meet the party at the Snake Shrine in Yamatai. Head there and walk inside for a cutscene. She gives a ton of gifts, rare items, the Red Orb and leaves behind her Elf Attendants for blacksmithing and item shopping.\n\nNow for the Yellow Orb. Going back and talking to Sphinx has her give the orb to you... if you can prove that you're worthy of it. She was a super boss in part 1 but is now a regular boss for part 2. After beating her up, she hands over the orb and can be recruited by talking to her again.\n\nNow for the last orb... if you haven't already unsealed Kraken, go do that. She says that before she was sealed, Astaroth got her hands on the Blue Orb and destroyed it, which means the Blue Orb can no longer be used in their world and it would take more than a year or so to recreate one. It seems that the adventure is over... but then someone remembers that there was the Blue Orb during the reign of Black Alice, and fortunately, one of the Tartarus leads to such a world.\n\nUnfortunately, the Blue Orb is in the Monster Lord's Castle. Yep.\n\nNow, with the barrier down, Luka and co can finally enter the Ilias Temple Ruins. At first, the place seems fine, music is calm and holy. The White Rabbit is there, blocking the path, and she asks the party if they are ready to see what is past this point - there is no turning back. Nod yes, and suddenly, the place shakes and static covers the screen... The entire place has changed, the elements are in disarray, the place is being transformed into chaos. Follow the White Rabbit as you make your way though the tangled mess. The monsters here are quite dangerous, but the really powerful enemies are in the next area. There, you'll find the White Rabbit in a church, she heals the party, but then the places undergoes another round of chaos which erodes the entire place. Here and in the next area, you'll find the apoptosised angels Heriel and Alciel, whom are basically mini bosses. Be prepared or flee. Anyway, as you make your way up the stairs of the once great Ilias temple, the White Rabbit attempts to explain how this all happened, before being blasted with holy lightning into ashes. But only one person could use that power... and indeed, at the far end, is another Ilias. After a lot of exposition from both, the White Rabbit takes everyone into a magical portal to a distant past, to some sort of laboratory. No one here can see nor hear the party, and the party likewise can't interact with them... except to pick up a key item along the way. Entering past a double set of doors, a cutscene plays out. Heinrich's sword, coated with blood on it, is being used as a catalyst to summon... something but, what they summoned was clearly not what they were expecting:\n\nBlack Alice, from the ordinal trilogy, moments after being defeated by Luka, but before she died. Not seeing Luka, Black Alice quickly realizes that no one can stop her from fusing with the Ilias inside of her and mixing Holy and Dark together into her mortal frame, becoming the Goddess of Chaos. With her newfound power, she turns her surroundings to chaos, summoning the Apoptosis, and proceeds to ascend. She sees the monsters of the Monster world and the angels of the Angel world, before turning... and seeing the party, peeking in on her. White Rabbit quickly forces everyone back before she can do anything.\n\nAgain, she tries to explain something, but Ilias blasts her again, before explaining it herself. When the Ilias from the trilogy died, her death causes a ripple effect of paradoxes, creating parallel worlds. These worlds all stem from the trilogy's world, and chaos is trying to correct any worlds that diverge from that path. The only way to stop it for a short period of time is to cut the Ilias of the world down. A sudden wind magic strikes her, and she falls, dead. The Lilith sisters show up, and in response, An Eden alongside Zion and Gnosis. Seeing their counterparts, the two sides duke it out, only for Sonya to step in between them, muttering and having a vague blank stare...\n\nThis is where the timeline splits between the Alice and Ilias route.\n\nOn an Alice route, Gnosis steps in and tries to shake her off, but Sonya rips off her arm and absorbs it, transforming into Sonya Mazda, who attacks the party. Defeating her causes Morrigan to try and kick her while she's down, but Luka manages to prevent her from dying when she attempts to absorb power from Morrigan by making Sonya flinch, thus allowing Morrigan to escape. She then summons a fully powered Adramelech and transforms into Sonya Chaos. Angels and monsters team up to stop Adramelech, while the party faces down Sonya Chaos. After wounding her, the party sees how Adramelech is faring. She is taken down by a combo attack, but revives in seconds, further pulling the world into chaos... the angels retreat, leaving the monsters and Luka's party behind. However, a small creature steps out - Nuruko. As the party watches, she transforms into a being much like the four spirits - the Spirit of Chaos. With her powers, she reverts Sonya and the world to normal and vaporizes Adramelech before transforming back. Lilith recommends having Morrigan join the party since she is wounded, and afterwards departs. The party talks about what happened before a few words from Morrigan end part 2 on a shocking note - Alice XV, Alice's mother, has died by the hands of Marcellus...\n\nOn an Ilias route, Morrigan is the one who tries to stop Sonya, but loses her arm and becomes Sonya Mainyu, the Dark counterpart to Sonya Mazda. Similar to the Alice route, defeating her causes Gnosis to stop her, but Luka interprets again and Sonya transforms into Sonya Chaos and summons Adramelech. This time, however, the Lilith Sisters flee first, leaving the angels and Luka behind. All seems lost, but then Sonya Chaos hears a whisper of what she used to be, a human, and turns her lance against Adramelech, piercing her. With her newfound powers, she rewinds time to before Adramelech was summoned, clones a Sonya from another world, and drags Adramelech with her into the void. The party awakens without any memory of what happened, just that they need to prevent the spread of chaos. The angels leave, promising to help if needed. As the party begins leaving, Luka looks at Sonya, feeling that something is off. An image of Sonya Chaos goes across his mind, but it was quickly fleeting. Feeling a sense of great loss, part 2 ends..."
