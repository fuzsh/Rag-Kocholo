        "text": "My thoughts\n\nI do love a good dragon book and this one is unique, taking us away from the traditional fantasy world and into a very familiar landscape of high school, modern society and dragons, of course. Most people don’t think dragons exist – why would they?, but Eden and Dani know the truth. They have been raised as the next generation of dragon hunters. Taught by their parents, legendary slayers in their own right, to keep humans safe from the furious beasts.\n\nWhen Dani discovers a dragon close to home and becomes soul bonded with it, everything she ever knew or was taught about dragons is challenged. Nox is powerful and can breath fire, with a deadly tail, but he doesn’t wish to harm anyone. Instead, he protects the dragon eggs entrusted to him and wants Dani’s help to hatch and raise them. Dani is torn between her old and new worlds and has no idea how to tell her parents. Eden is Dani’s elder sister. She trained Dani and only wishes it was she that people referred to as destined to be the greatest slayer. Instead, her dedication to the craft is unrecognised and her skills surpasses by the uninterested Dani. When The High Sorcerer enlists Eden’s help she is flattered and wants to use the opportunity to show everyone that she has what it takes to be the best slayer.\n\nWritten in alternating chapters, we readers get to see this story from both Eden and Dani’s perspective. They are both equally likeable as much as they are flawed and make some really silly mistakes. They are teens in a world of dragons and magic and choices that mean life or death. I found myself rooting for first one sister and then the other and then switching again. It’s easy to judge Eden’s choices yet harder to know see how easy it is for her to by lured by the promises she is made. Same with Dani, she makes some obvious mistakes trusting the wrong people and then not trusting those allied to her – like Nox, she’s rather mean to him I think – but this is so true to her character and upbringing and it makes both Dani and Eden genuine and authentic teen characters, trying to figure out school (high school for Dani, online college for Eden), friendships, romantic relationships and getting along as sisters – or at least not betraying, capturing and killing each other (though a far big of that does happen).\n\nI loved that Fire With Fire could work as a standalone fantasy novel (love, love, love it when I don’t have to read a whole series to get a complete story), but there is also room for this story to be continued in a different way, should the author so choose.\n\nPerfect for fantasy readers who want a little something different than the traditional fantasy world setting or for paranormal or realistic readers wanting to adventure into the very cool world of dragons and magic.\n\nThe publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes. All opinions are my own.\n\nMore information\n\nCategory: Young adult fiction\n\nGenre: Fantasy.\n\nThemes: Dragons, dragon slayers, sisters, sorcerers, magic, romance.\n\nReading age guide: Ages 12 and up.\n\nAdvisory: Violence – torture using magic, injury, blood, killing, capture and harm of magical animals (dragons).
