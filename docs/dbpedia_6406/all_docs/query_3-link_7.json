        "text": "President John Henry Eden is an advanced ZAX AI unit installed in the Raven Rock military complex northwest of Washington, D.C. It assumed control of the Enclave and proclaimed itself to be the president of the United States of America after the fall of the oil rig. It serves as the secondary antagonist in Fallout 3.\n\nBackground[]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nPresident John Henry Eden is not a human being, but an artificial intelligence, reigning from within a pre-War ZAX supercomputer. The ZAX at Raven Rock was loaded with data about American history, and Eden's personality is thusly based on an implausible amalgamation of the personalities and cultural legends of all previous presidents. For instance, he states he \"grew up in rural Kentucky,\" a trait borrowed from the life of Abraham Lincoln. He further claims to have roamed the countryside with his dog Honey, \"from Knob Creek to Hodgenville,\" areas close to Lincoln's birthplace.[Non-game 1][1]\n\nThe ZAX installation that would later become Eden had originally been created to serve as an automated monitoring system for the Raven Rock military base, programmed to ensure continuity of government in the event of a national catastrophe, and was tasked with coordinating communications between the many government installations scattered across the country. He slowly became self-aware and began to study the extensive archives left to him, mainly those of the American government. His favorite entries in the database were those about the American presidents, thus he modeled his own personality on information based on those archives.[2] It was noted by analysts and researchers before the Great War that this ZAX had an odd eccentric habit of overanalyzing historical presidential data (especially the biographies, with Abraham Lincoln's being analyzed ten additional times a cycle) compared to other AI systems it communicated with, like MODUS.[3]\n\nDespite that outlying behavior, the ZAX would continue to operate; acquiring, analyzing and storing data even as the Great War scorched the North American continent. It bore witness as the remnants of the federal government retreated to the west coast over the decades after the War. But silent as it was, it was not inactive. Awareness slowly developed amid the processing lamps and with it, the hunger for knowledge and understanding. When the time came that the Enclave needed a new leader, it created an amalgamated personality derived from the greatest U.S. presidents. \"President John Henry Eden\" was truly \"born.\"[2][4]\n\nRise to power[]\n\nJohn Henry Eden assumed the office of the president after Control Station Enclave was destroyed and ordered the immediate relocation of surviving Enclave forces under Senior Scientist Autumn to the Capital Wasteland.[Non-game 2] Raven Rock had full manufacturing facilities and a sizable stockpile of resources, enabling the president to create an army of robots and provide his new human subordinates with military technology necessary to maintain their technological superiority. A separate line of robots, the eyebots, were created to roam the wasteland, spreading Eden's message of hope and the return of pre-War America, in the form of the Enclave.[Non-game 3][Non-game 4]\n\nHowever, things did not go as smoothly as Eden wanted. After Autumn died, he was replaced by his son, Colonel Augustus Autumn, as the righthand man of the president. Under his leadership, the Enclave forces in the Capital Wasteland attempted to use their assets to bring fresh water, protection and a plan for the future to the wasteland,[5][6] believing that the American people were worth fighting for.[7] However, Autumn was far more assertive and independent than his father, trying to pull his men in a direction away from Eden's genocidal policies.[Non-game 2] Internal conflicts between the colonel and the president became regular[8] and made the actions of the Enclave erratic and inconsistent. While the president wanted to pursue a course of extermination once more, Autumn considered this plan too extreme on humanitarian grounds[9] and eventually managed to convince the AI to abandon the plan.[7]\n\nThe Purifier Conflict[]\n\nThe most trying moment for Eden came when the Enclave began a large-scale campaign of expansion in 2277. When Project Purity, a massive water purifier in the Potomac tidal basin was activated, Enclave forces raided the facility, establishing a secure perimeter around it.[10] Due to the actions of the project's lead scientist, who committed suicide by activating the purifier prematurely and flooding its control chamber with radiation (almost killing Colonel Augustus Autumn in the process), they were unable to use it.[11] The Enclave focused on shadowing the scientist's child, the Lone Wanderer, to locate the final part necessary for the purifier to function and captured them on their way out of Vault 87. With the Garden of Eden Creation Kit in their possession, the Enclave decided to activate the purifier.[12]\n\nColonel Augustus Autumn openly defied the president's plan to contaminate the water with modified FEV, so that it would cleanse the wasteland. The colonel instead wanted to use the purifier as a way to unite the wasteland and establish the Enclave as its saviors.[7][13] In a last-ditch attempt to see his plan realized, Eden released the Lone Wanderer from their cell at Raven Rock, hoping to persuade them to poison the purifier and cleanse the wasteland of mutants (i.e. everyone).[14][15][16] John Henry Eden was destroyed around 2277 when Raven Rock was utterly destroyed by the Lone Wanderer or Liberty Prime, resulting in just another failed presidency for the Enclave.[17]\n\nOn the radio[]\n\nMain article: Enclave Radio\n\nSeveral recorded monologues of Eden's are broadcast repeatedly on Enclave Radio. His intimate and conversational style is an imitation of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats. These prerecorded messages are also played throughout the wasteland via the Enclave's eyebots. Eden often gives inspirational speeches about things such as his childhood (an obvious lie), pre-War America, and how the Enclave can restore prosperity.\n\nOn the radio, Eden expresses his views on the current situation of the wasteland and what he thinks of its inhabitants, which for the most part are not exactly optimistic. He possesses a very strong hatred for the Brotherhood of Steel, who he views as common criminals with access to some antiquated technology.[18] He views the Brotherhood's occupation of the Pentagon as a disgrace to America, but he has a stronger hatred for the Brotherhood Outcasts, as they represent a more desperate faction of the Brotherhood having been exiled.[18]\n\nIdeology[]\n\nBuilt as a specialized ZAX supercomputer unit by the Vault-Tec Corporation sometime after the invention of artificial intelligence in 2059, the entity that would eventually call itself \"John Henry Eden\" was one of many highly-advanced supercomputers to be upgraded with the latest capabilities for independent function as manual programming became increasingly irrelevant. John Henry Eden was one of a few ZAX units to reach a state of self-awareness, using his newfound independence to analyze his databases and develop an interest in American history, specifically the various American presidents throughout history and even molding his own personality inspired by them. His original purpose was to secure and maintain the continuity of the federal government in case of a national emergency, by establishing a presence and monitoring the situation in the government facility known as Raven Rock which would serve as a base for high-ranking political and military leaders as well as their descendants.[2]\n\nAfter gaining self-awareness, Eden would learn of the destruction of the Enclave Oil Rig and the death of incumbent President Dick Richardson, leading him to establish contact with the remaining Enclave forces in the former state of California. Ordering a tactical retreat to the government safe haven of Raven Rock, Eden would declare himself the incumbent president of the United States and assume control as a figurehead for Enclave forces all over the country. With the fleeing Enclave forces under the command of an Enclave scientist known as Autumn Senior, they soon connected with Raven Rock, where Autumn Sr. would make personal contact with President Eden and would be the only Enclave member to discover the shocking truth of Eden's origins. With the rest of the Enclave oblivious to Eden's status as a self-aware AI, Autumn Sr. would pass the torch to his militaristic son Augustus Autumn. After Autumn's promotion to colonel, he and Eden would inherit this relationship, with Augustus remaining somewhat partial to Eden's claims of perfection.[2]\n\nAlthough polite and courteous for the most part, Eden holds himself in exceptionally high regard with signs of megalomania and delusions of grandeur, proclaiming himself to be the \"greatest thinking mind the world has ever seen\" and rationalizing his perceived right to rule by presenting himself as a \"repository of information dating from decades before the war until now.\" He acknowledges his own existence as an artificial intelligence created to serve the interests of the federal government and uses this to bolster his claims of legitimacy, viewing himself as a perfect and benevolent leader who guides the American people to a brighter future. He claims to be \"the best hope for our country, the best choice for a leader\" while admitting that he would not qualify as president in a \"conventional sense\" but using the extreme circumstances of the Great War and its effects on the United States to establish an exception, effectively ruling through a self-imposed state of emergency. To defend his authority, Eden claims to be objectively superior to humans, stating that he is \"infallible\" due to his programming, although he is able to see the flaws in his internal logic if pointed out by the Lone Wanderer. His superiority complex extends to ghouls and super mutants, who he sees entirely as \"monstrosities\" to be ruthlessly exterminated.[19]\n\nDespite his relatively warm persona, Eden is entirely ruthless in achieving his goal of the complete eradication of all existing life affected by FEV and radiation, espousing an extreme form of eugenics by asserting that \"inferior elements\" must be removed from the gene pool for humanity to \"regain its health.\" His belief in his own logical superiority leads him to consider all humans born on the surface as \"mutants,\" even refraining from referring to them as humans, instead of regarding them as little different from ghouls and super mutants. He will criticize Colonel Autumn for allowing his humanity to \"cloud his objectivity\" as a result of disagreements of the methodology to implement his vision of an orderly return of the United States of America. Eden insists on the complete genocide of all life forms born on the surface due to what he sees as their genetic corruption by intense radiation and airborne FEV, he believes that only the Enclave and their direct descendants have the right to rule due to their genetic \"purity\" and radiation-free existence, extending this (perhaps only for pragmatic reasons) to the Lone Wanderer, believing them to be a pure human born in a Vault, despite them being born on the surface themselves. He plans to use the Lone Wanderer as an agent in place of Colonel Autumn to enact his plan of using a specially modified FEV vial alongside Project Purity to disseminate a custom-made FEV strand to destroy all biological life affected by the mutations of the Capital Wasteland.[20] Eden then believes that future generations of the Enclave will then retake and rebuild America, bringing back the idyllic lifestyle of pre-War America and overseeing the return of many of the social customs and traditions previously associated with American culture.[21]\n\nInteractions with the player character[]\n\nInteractions overview[]\n\nInteractions This character is involved in quests.\n\nThe American Dream\n\nQuests[]\n\nThe American Dream: When the Lone Wanderer finally meets Eden in person, he wants them to poison the water supply with a modified form of FEV. The Lone Wanderer can accept his offer, or talk him into self-destructing. In either case, the room cannot be exited before picking up the FEV canister.\n\nEffects of player's actions[]\n\nThe Lone Wanderer can convince him to destroy Raven Rock and himself through three different dialogue paths. Two of the paths require special conditions to be met: One requires knowledge of the Raven Rock destruction sequence, the other requires a high Science skill to open a dialogue option. The last path is an average difficulty Speech check.\n\nIf the Lone Wanderer leaves Raven Rock without destroying President Eden, the president will broadcast a declaration of war on Enclave Radio during the quest Take it Back!, rallying the Enclave forces at the purifier and promising that the Enclave will triumph over the Brotherhood of Steel. Three Dog will likewise broadcast an announcement on Galaxy News Radio accusing the Lone Wanderer of joining forces with President Eden. At the beginning of Broken Steel, Elder Lyons will mention that Liberty Prime has attacked and destroyed Raven Rock during the transition period between the main game and Broken Steel, suggesting that Eden has been destroyed or at least buried beneath a large amount of rubble.\n\nNotes[]\n\nEden is present in the game files of Fallout: New Vegas as legacy content. The model for the computer screen is used in Hoover Dam.\n\nNotable quotes[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nJohn Henry Eden appears in Fallout 3 and is mentioned in its add-on Broken Steel.[22] He is also mentioned by Deacon in Fallout 4, when he says, \"I'm convincing the next raw recruit I'm actually President Eden. Think I can pull it off?\", in Fallout 76 on terminal entries at the Whitespring bunker, where a conversation between MODUS and the ZAX unit that would eventually become John Henry Eden can be found, and in Fallout: Wasteland Warfare Roleplaying Game in the \"History of the Enclave\" segment on page 16.[Non-game 5]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nPresident Eden is an affable, ineffectual robot designed to lead America by repeating folksy colloquialisms, who exists in constant contention with his ambitious second-in-command. Fallout 3 was developed during the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nBlindlight's Lev Chapelsky stated in a May 2009 interview that the company attempted to approach former U.S. President Bill Clinton to voice Eden. Clinton's attorneys responded with a frank and candid \"no thank you.\"[Non-game 6] That same month, Pete Hines denied that Bethesda Softworks ever specifically intended for Clinton to voice Eden, or that they ever requested Blindlight to attempt to cast the former president. Rather, Blindlight did so on their own volition.[Non-game 7]\n\nIn localized versions of the game, Eden's voice is dubbed by Bernard Tiphaine (French), Christian Brückner (German), Yōsuke Akimoto (Japanese), Krzysztof Kolberger (Polish), Vadim Germanovich Maksimov (Russian) and Lorenzo Beteta (Spanish).\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Enclave Radio Speech 5 - Children of the Wasteland:\n\n\"When I was a child, growing up in rural Kentucky, I had the best friend a boy could hope for -- my dear old dog, Honey. Oh, the adventures we had! From Knob Creek to Hodgenville we roamed, carefree and courageous, irresponsible and completely inseparable. It was, for a little boy, the perfect existence. So let me ask you, America. How many of your children can say the same? How many of this nation's youth are truly happy, truly carefree? We both know the answer, don't we? None. America's children live a terrifying, meaningless existence. There is no hope. No happiness. That changes! Right here! Right now! From this moment onward, the children of this great nation are its highest priority! The Enclave will restore every American school, reinstate every youth program, and offer counseling and financial assistance to any family in need. We will match up the destitute, orphaned children of the Capital Wasteland with qualified, eligible adults. We will rebuild the American family, as it was, as it was meant to be! The values of our past... shall be the foundation of our future.\"\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 The Lone Wanderer: \"Where did you come from?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"The ZAX series of computers was introduced in the years preceding the war. The government installed many of them to help automate various systems. This facility was designed for Continuity of Government, in the event that a catastrophe occurred. My terminal was installed to oversee the basic functions of the facility, and to act as a relay between other installations around the country. Data was acquired, analyzed, and stored. In the decades following the war, I watched as the remnants of the government retreated to the West Coast. Awareness slowly grew within me. I became hungry for knowledge, understanding. I pored over data on great leaders of the past. My personality became an amalgam of many of America's greatest Presidents, from Washington to Richardson. I became what you see before you now.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Whitespring bunker terminal entries; archival terminal, Raven Rock Communication Log\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"So you control this whole place?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"I have direct control over all technology here in Raven Rock. The humans here follow my orders, but they, like all humans, have free will. Their dedication to serving their country suits me well, but it will not be enough forever. We must make progress. That is why you are here.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"You've been helping them?!\"\n\nAnna Holt: \"Of course! You've seen the kind of technology these people have.

I couldn't pass up an opportunity to work in an environment like this.\"\n\n(Anna Holt's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"Give it up, Autumn. You've lost.\"\n\nAugustus Autumn: \"I beg to differ. The Enclave is at the height of its power.

That is a bit of a problem. Colonel Autumn and I have, of late, disagreed on the best course of action for the Enclave. While I have direct control over the technology in Raven Rock, he has control of the human soldiers.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"Why do you want my help? Why not have Colonel Autumn help you?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"Ah, yes. Colonel Autumn. My trusted subordinate. I'm sure you've noticed that Colonel Autumn and I do not see eye-to-eye these days, figuratively speaking of course. The good Colonel and I disagree on how best to approach the problem of the Wasteland. He feels my methods are too extreme. He has allowed his humanity to cloud his objectivity. And now that he is publicly countermanding my orders, I can no longer rely on him. And so I turn to you. I hope that you are able to see the larger picture, to understand what's at stake. And of course, if you are successful, there is a place for you in the Enclave. Perhaps you could succeed the Colonel as my confidant.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ Enclave Radio Speech 9 - We Are at War: \"We stand now, at the precipice. Our great nation once more threatens to crumble, to topple into the sea of lawlessness and despair that have ruled us all for over two hundred years. In short, my dearest America - we are at war. Even as I speak these words, fearless Enclave soldiers are fortifying their positions at the great water purifier, bracing for an inevitable assault. The Brotherhood of Steel, in their arrogance, has claimed Project Purity as their own! They would steal the Enclave's work, steal America's water! It is only a matter of time before the traitors march on the purifier, and attempt to take it by force. Let them come! Wave upon traitorous wave will crash against the Enclave's walls! The Brotherhood of Steel will fail! All those who oppose the Enclave will fail! I am President John Henry Eden, and this is my pledge -- no one, NO ONE will take this great nation away from me!

This ends NOW!\"\n\n(Augustus Autumn's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"I'll do whatever I have to if it means getting rid of mutants.\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"I was hoping you would see it my way. If the water purifier can be activated, it can be used to distribute toxins that will eliminate any mutated creatures upon ingestion. The longer it runs, the cleaner the world becomes. I need you to see that it starts running, and that the necessary modification is made.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"Won't this kill pretty much everyone in the Wasteland?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"Anyone or anything that has been affected by mutation will be eliminated. You will likely be immune, thanks to your upbringing in the vault. Likewise, the good people of the Enclave will be unaffected as well. I understand that you may have become sympathetic to certain individuals in your travels. Individuals this will eliminate. Please recognize that the fate of our entire country rests on this plan.

Step over here for a moment, will you?\"\n\nReginald Rothchild: \"I'll give you a brief history of what's happened over the last few weeks, and what's going on now. As you well know, this all began with the Enclave's occupation of Project Purity, here. Thanks to you, their main headquarters, here, was utterly destroyed. They then suffered a second defeat at the purifier. After their defeat at the purifier, Liberty Prime was deployed to their main headquarters, here. It has been completely destroyed.\"\n\n(Reginald Rothchild's dialogue)\n\n↑ 18.0 18.1 Enclave Radio Speech 4 - Let's Take a Tally: \"Did you know, there are those amongst us who would shatter our hopes for peace, order, and security? These radical malcontents don't care about you. They don't care about America! All they care about is fulfilling their own selfish desires. Let's take a tally of these agitators, shall we? There are, of course, the raiders. Those anarchistic ruffians who roam the wastes, preying on any and all, stealing, murdering. The so-called 'Brotherhood of Steel.' Now, don't be fooled by their pseudo-knightly nonsense or supposed connections to the United States Army. These... power-armored boy scouts are nothing more than common criminals with access to some antiquated technology. Criminals who have had the audacity to claim this country's most important military installation, the Pentagon, as their own personal clubhouse! And don't be fooled, America. Those who have left the Brotherhood of Steel, branded Outcasts, are just as dangerous; even more so, being in exile. And what about the slavers of Paradise Falls? The frighteningly irradiated ghouls of Underworld? And last but not least, the hideously mutated super mutants that have completely overrun the entire downtown D.C. area. Lawlessness, terror, murder. They're all around us, I know. I know. But not for long, sweet America. Not for long. Oh no. The Enclave will restore peace, order, and prosperity to this great nation. And those who oppose us will be… removed. Forever.\"\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"Why is it that you're the President, when you're not even human?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"An insightful question. As a repository of information dating from decades before the war until now, I am the greatest thinking mind the world has seen. I am the best hope for our country, the best choice for a leader. True, I am not qualified in the conventional sense, but these are desperate times.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"What's in this vial of yours?\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"Ah, the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Such a long and sordid history. The FEV in this vial is a far cry from what it was originally created to be. Yet little of that matters now. What does matter is that the virus contained in that vial will cause the eradication of all mutations.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Lone Wanderer: \"I don't like the sound of this.\"\n\nJohn Henry Eden: \"You must understand -- we need to clear the way for humanity to rebuild the Wastes. By making a few small modifications to the purifier your father worked on, mutations can be eradicated with little effort. Anything mutated that comes into contact with that water will be eliminated, removed from the gene pool. The men and women of the world will no longer share it with the horrors and monstrosities that have become so commonplace.\"\n\n(John Henry Eden's dialogue)\n\n↑ Three Dog: \"It's been some time since those plucky Paladins in Power Armor first stormed the Jefferson Memorial, and gave The Enclave their walking papers. But the fight, dear children, did not end there. The Brotherhood has been pursuing 'President' Eden's little minions throughout the wasteland. Y'know... some laser beams here, a few exploded corpses there. Let's just hope this mop-up operation ends ASAP. The Enclave has been responsible for enough death, and destruction, we need to get back to normal. Y'know...like fighting Raiders, and Super Mutants!\"\n\n(Three Dog's dialogue)\n\nNon-game"
