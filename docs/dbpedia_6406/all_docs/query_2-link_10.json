        "text": "I wasn't much of a Tintinologist in my boyhood. Precocious and pretentious, I was too busy reading Shakespeare and Dickens to bother with a series of Belgian cartoons about the picaresque scrapes of a boy reporter who always wore immaculately-creased plus fours and sported a blonde quiff poised in mid-air like a wave about to break. Then, when I had grown up enough to be able to relax, a Portuguese friend introduced me to the creations of Hergé. I have never looked back.\n\nI love the books, in which Tintin intrepidly foils plots by mad scientists, recovers lost jewels, dives to the bottom of the sea in a shark-finned submarine, takes a rocket to the Moon, and rescues the Earth from the threat of a rogue meteorite. I am also dangerously partial to Tintin merchandise, and whenever I'm near the Musée Cluny in Paris I go on circumlocutory detours to avoid a row of shops that supply everything you need to Tintinise your private world: wallpaper, bed linen, kitchenware, furniture, shower curtains, alarm clocks, key rings, underpants. To my knowledge there are as yet no Tintin condoms, which leaves at least one niche waiting to be filled.\n\nDespite myself, I have managed to accumulate a Tintin lamp made of glass, with a jagged cut-out of the New York skyline as seen from the deck of the departing liner after a first trip to America. I also own a slightly soiled facsimile of Tintin's loyal fox terrier Snowy (though I prefer to call him by his original name of Milou, chosen by Hergé to evoke a big-bosomed girlfriend); imaginary playmates are supposed to be invisible, but the manufacturers of memorabilia know how to fashion them from wool, felt and synthetic fur. Deep in one of my drawers is a T-shirt transcribing the title page of Tintin in the Congo, with the happy savages worshipping the snow-white hound as their god. It's too politically incorrect to wear on the street in my mixed London neighbourhood, but I sometimes sleep in it.\n\nThe relentless marketing of Tintin has made him a symbol of value, like stock in a gold-chip company: he has already appeared on a Belgian postage stamp, and is about to have his image imprinted on a new euro coin. His career began 75 years ago, and the occasion is being commemorated by an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, which will concentrate on his nautical jaunts. It's a sobering anniversary: the ebullient boy in the baggy pants that stop just short of the ankles must be decrepit by now, if not dead. Except that of course, inside the hermetically sealed frames of the strip cartoon, he is the same ageless creature he always was. He holds out the promise of a permanent childhood; as Eisenstein said of Mickey Mouse, whom he insisted on meeting during his trip to Hollywood, he represents a paradise that can be regained merely by wishing for it.\n\nTintin is immune to time, like all archetypal characters. No gale or storm at sea ever managed to discompose that triumphant tuft of hair. The checks on his plus fours - particularly in the early black-and-white newspaper versions, later redesigned in colour when the series was reissued in book form - are an equally immovable grid, as abstract as one of Mondrian's geometrical patterns. Georges Remi, who neatly reversed his initials to invent the nom de plume Hergé, saw no reason to grow up: remembering the Red Indian games he played when he joined one of Baden-Powell's troupes in 1919, he said 'I never ceased to be a Boy Scout.'\n\nTintin was always travelling - first to dour Soviet Russia, then to a rhino-ridden Congo, after that to venal, brutal America, with subsequent expeditions to Egypt and Tibet. (It's my special regret that he never got to Australia: in one of the last volumes, published in 1968, he checks in for Qantas flight 714 from Djakarta to Sydney, but is distracted by a kerfuffle on a volcanic island in the Pacific, and never completes the journey. Would he have shucked off those prickly plus-fours at Bondi? How might Milou have responded to the marsupials?) Yet Tintin's global mobility never unsettles him, tempts him to go native, or weakens his yearning for the place he set out from. Stories about paradise regained and childhood recovered have to include homecomings; every foreign sortie ends with Tintin's return to snug, slumbrous, provincial Belgium, just as his companion Captain Haddock, tripping over a lunar boulder, says that after visiting the moon he's convinced that man belongs on 'dear old earth'.\n\nSome of Hergé's loveliest frames encapsulate this infantile, idyllic vision of home. In The Black Island he and Milou walk down an English country lane, with a hedgerow, a thatched cottage, and a distant church spire behind him. Here, unspoilt and safe from change, is Shakespeare's 'other Eden, demi-paradise'.\n\nMilou is equally nostalgic for remembered smells, and, hopping aboard the train back to Brussels after that Soviet expedition, says 'No more dangers! Thank goodness our life of excitement is over!' I should add that Milou's loquacity in the early strips - he loses the power of speech later on, and only regains it in one of the last volumes in order to gruffly remark that he dislikes talking animals - is for me one of the regressive, alluring charms of this fictional world. If our dogs could answer back when we speak to them, would we have any need for congress with members of our own species?\n\nDenouncing communists in Russia or China, lamenting American gangsterism, Tintin confronts geopolitical perils, though his homely quietism keeps him from ever taking an ideological stand. (Hergé was punished for adopting the same cautious policy, and after the war had to be deNazified because he chose to stay and work in occupied Belgium.)\n\nLike all journalists, Tintin is despatched to war zones, yet we never see him filing copy, and he gradually exchanges this combative profession for the more neutral, leisurely occupation of explorer, exempt from any need to act as an itinerant conscience. And the world through which he travels - despite the presence of composite fascists like Müsstler, who destabilises the Balkans in King Ottakar's Sceptre, first serialised in 1938, or the piratical profiteer Mazaroff, a caricature of the arms dealer Sir Basil Zaharoff - is an autonomous universe, given over to harmless play. This is another source of Hergé's abiding appeal: whenever reality threatens to impinge, it is commuted into nonsense. Paraguay becomes the banana republic of Nuevo Rico, and Brasilia is Tapiocapolis. In The Cigars of the Pharaoh , the pyramids are scaled down to the size of those little rustic huts that sell drinks, smokes and sweets in Belgian streets, since the monarch whose tomb has been plundered is called Kih-oskh.\n\nMore sophisticated pleasures are also available. Hergé was an experimental modernist, whose static frames, like film strips not put through a projector, teasingly play with ways of representing motion in a still format. Marcel Duchamp caused a sensation when he attempted this paradoxical feat in his painting of a nude descending a staircase; Hergé manages the illusion with just as much subtlety. 'Accelerate, Tintin!' barks Milou in an early story in which their car is being chased by an aeroplane. The scene looks frantic, but the vehicles are running on the spot, their velocity sketched in by straight lines that stand for vapour trails.\n\nHergé was equally clever at representing noise in a mercifully silent medium. Capital letters and exclamation marks denote explosions; he hated opera, so the preening soprano Castafiore, who is always shattering glass with her coloratura tirades, emits only inaudible minims and crotchets or scribbly shock waves, sparing us, as readers, from having to hear the screechy sound she produces.\n\nBy the time Hergé died in 1983, avant-garde painters had caught up with him. Pop Art dissected the conventions of the comic strip cartoon, which he had been doing for half a century; accepting the compliment, he acquired a collection of Roy Lichtenstein's grainy blow-ups - frozen frames from spurious cartoons, in which girls weep oceanic tears and fighter jets belch out fire. On a visit to New York he befriended Warhol, who made a silk-screen portrait of him, to be included in the Greenwich show. It's easy to understand Warhol's interest in the mythology Hergé invented: like Tintin, he was stalled in adolescence, wearing a silver wig instead of that perky, crested coiffure. In 1934 in The Blue Lotus, Hergé vilified Japanese imperialism, decrying the country's assault on China. There were ambassadorial protests, and a Belgian general harumphed that such propaganda was unfit for children. His belligerent disapproval missed the point, and Hergé ignored it. By then he knew that Tintin, like childhood, is wasted on the young.\n\nTintin for beginners\n\nCharacters\n\nTintin The hero of the series; solves mysteries... it's what he does.\n\nSnowy ('Milou' in French), Tintin's trusty dog, always by his side.\n\nCaptain Haddock An old, potentially alcoholic seafaring captain. Tintin first meets the Captain in The Crab with the Golden Claws, where the two strike up a friendship for life.\n\nCalculus A professor whose inventions aren't particularly prized by Captain Haddock. Calculus, being 'almost deaf', mistakenly thinks the Captain loves them.\n\nThomson and Thompson Two clumsy detectives who have a tendency to get in our hero's way.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nTintin's first adventure appeared in Le Petit Vingtième, a supplement to the Belgium daily Vingtième Siècle, on 10 January 1929. In the story, Tintin goes to the Soviet Union, is denounced by the Communist Party and chased by secret police.\n\nIn 1954 Tintin landed on the moon, 15 years before Neil Armstrong. The boy reporter discovered ice there - a fact not confirmed by Nasa until 1996.\n\nMore than 3 million copies of Tintin adventures are sold each year across 50 countries, in 40 different languages. Snowy's bark in Basque is 'blaust' and in Indonesian 'plung'. Similarly, Tintin's international personas include Kuifje (Afrikaans), Tainetaine (Iranian), Tufke (Frisian) and the somewhat bland 'Tim' (German).\n\nHergé immortalised himself in many of the adventures, as a blond-haired, long-nosed character. His cameos range from narrowly missing being hit by a roast chicken in The Black Island, to his only spoken line in The Crab with the Golden Claws: 'How does it feel to be a hero, Tintin?'\n\nDespite being Belgian, Tintin is hailed as an icon of French culture. General Charles de Gaulle said: 'My only international rival is Tintin.' More recently, the French National Assembly debated Tintin's political affiliation.\n\nTintin is surrounded by conspiracy theories. As well as being held to be a fascist and a capitalist, there has been speculation as to his sexuality with regard to his close companionship with Haddock. Hergé's translator Michael Turner believes Tintin's lack of family ties made him 'a free spirit'.\n\nDeborah Linton"
