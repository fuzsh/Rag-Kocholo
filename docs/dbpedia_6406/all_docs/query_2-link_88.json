        "text": "by Harper Lee\n\nFirst Published: 1960\n\nIn the vote for our readersâ favorite classic novel, it was a decisive victory! A full one-third of our readers submitted To Kill a Mockingbird as one of their three all-time favorites, with the majority of those readers listing it first.\n\nSet in Alabama in 1933, this story is told from the perspective of a 6-year-old girl called Scout. Her widowed father, Atticus Finch, is a crusading local lawyer who risks everything to defend a black man accused of a terrible crime.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nThis is the first \"adult\" book that I ever read. My mother gave it to me when I was 11. I read it again in school when I was a sophomore or junior, and then again in college for my English degree. I have taught it a number of times. Every time I read it, something new comes out. I think the characters and thematic elements are amazing, and it should be a must-read. -Kathleen W.\n\nItâs a beautiful coming-of-age story about doing the right thing when itâs not popular. -Mitzi K.\n\nI've lost count of how many times I've read this book. The characters are everyday, common people struggling with issues relevant to our own times....racism, bullying, single parenting, and scandal. I especially love Scout, the 6-year-old narrator of this story. Her wisdom and insight is amazing and beyond her years. This story has so many layers.....one reading of it just won't begin to absorb them all! -Kim I.\n\nIt is a beautiful story, with beautiful characters--but it is also a very ugly story, with ugly characters. It shows us the absolute best and worst of our nation. At its heart, it is about love, and caring for others, and taking a stand for what is right rather than what is easy or popular. Those concepts and themes are timeless!\n\nLove the emotions it evokes and the honest dialogue one must have with oneself when reading. I love that it is written from the viewpoint of Scout, the youngest of the Finch family, who is the most innocent and purest, any other viewpoint would be tainted. I love the fight one man had for the otherâ¦the fight for what was right. There are ugly things that are shown in this book. Things that should be talked about and confronted. Things we need to be aware of so we do not spread racism, prejudice, and hate. We need to be reminded what these things look like and how they evolve. They do evolve, because today they can be seen everywhere in microaggressions, and we donât see them until someone shows us. Atticus showed them their prejudices, biases, and racism. -Stacey K.\n\nFifty-five years after the publication of this classic, Harper Lee published a Go Set a Watchman. Harper Lee actually penned this novel in the late 50s (the decade in which the story was set), but her early publisher had reservations and recommended she take a different approach - resulting in To Kill A Mockingbird. People either love or hate Go Set a Watchman. If you adore Atticus Finch, you might be happier not reading this book, but it does tackle the important reality of the racial tensions brewing in the South in the 1950s.\n\nby Louisa May Alcott\n\nFirst Published: 1868\n\nThis novel follows the lives of the four March sisters - beautiful Meg, tomboy Jo, frail Beth, and romantic and spoiled Amy. Living in New England during the Civil War, these sisters are devoted to one another while each struggling to survive.Â\n\nExploring themes such as love and death, war and peace, and the conflict between ambition and responsibility, as well as addressing the clash of cultures between Europe and America, Alcott based this famous work on her own early life. She initially supported her sisters by doing âwomanâs work,â like sewing and laundry, while her father ran in the same circle as male authors like Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Eventually, Alcott discovered that she could make more money writing books, even if Little Women was far from the âgirlâs bookâ her publishers requested from her.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nI think the sisters in this story make us feel that their times were simpler, and in many ways they were.Â Underneath there is the struggle with illness, class, war, gender roles, and struggles with money.Â It shows one that all these things affect your life, but you have to find the love and the joy. -Leslie C.\n\nIt is a book that grows and changes with you as you age. I had a much more romantic view of the story and relationships in my teens and twenties. Now in my fifties, I see a more realistic view of what is happening in the story and where some of what I romanticized earlier in life, is actually not very healthy. -Christa\n\nAll the tender follies of being young and all the bittersweet heartbreaks of growing older are in this book. I think everyone wants to be in the March family.Â I still cry when I read it. -Nicole S.\n\nThis was one of my favorites as a kid and I still love it. Like most young women/girls, I wanted to be Jo. I love how she refuses to let society dictate what kind of woman she will be and chases her dreams. The struggle to figure out your identity while trying to balance familial obligations is one that so many people can relate to while growing up. -Heather W.\n\nI read it with my mother as a child. I read it at least once a year, and read it with my girls. The story is from a time when the United States was at war, and to me, the story shows the hardships families, and especially the women faced. It is heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. When you read it you are warmed by the relationship between the sisters, their neighbors and especially young Master Lawrence. It is a story about life, death, hope, and most of all love. -Lori M.\n\nby Jane Austen\n\nFirst Published: 1813\n\nPride and Prejudice follows the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. Many of our readers dubbed this classic love story the original rom-com and Mr. Darcy the original grumpy male love interest who was dark and broody in all the right ways.\n\nElizabeth is one of five daughters living on a country estate, and her mother is aggressively trying to matchmake for her and her sisters. When Darcy, a wealthy, aristocratic landowner, arrives in the village along with a group of other wealthy bachelors, the Bennet family is immediately put off by his cold and arrogant manner. Ultimately Elizabeth and Darcy two must overcome first impressions and prejudices if either of them is to find love.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nAusten's characters are flawed and realistic--which makes them interesting. Elizabeth Bennet, in particular, is a character so ahead of her time. I related to her. As a young, headstrong girl who was misunderstood by many people and didn't always do what she was supposed to do, I found a character who was very much like myself.\n\nI can read it again and again and still enjoy it. The language, the characters, the angst. -Kathy Y.\n\nNo one does subtle satire the way Austen does, and Elizabeth Bennett is a heroine who stands the test of time. -Rachel\n\nI love Austen's characters, her clever way of stating things, of weaving a story, and bringing characters together. I read one Austen novel every year, rotating through them, but P & P remains my favorite. -Linda G.\n\nby Charlotte BrontÃ«\n\nFirst Published: 1847\n\nFilled with mystery and suspense, Jane Eyre is considered one of the most popular works of Gothic romance.\n\nJane was orphaned as a child and spent her early life always feeling like an outcast. Around the age of twenty, she is hired by the brooding, proud Edward Rochester to care for his ward, AdÃ¨le. Jane finds herself drawn to Edward, but there is a secret hiding inside the gloomy, forbidding Thornfield Hall that may leave Jane heartbroken.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nUnlike so many classics, you don't have to understand the time period to understand the story and the themes. Its themes of being orphaned, struggling with childhood, and trying to find a place in the world are still relatable today. And then you add a gothic mystery on top! And while the book looks long, the story is easy to read. -Kim V.\n\nThis book was one of the first classics I read. At the time, I was not aware of the ending, which took me by surprise. The romantic tension that was gradually building between Jane and Mr. Rochester revealed many issues from the era they lived in. -Kathy W.\n\nI love how Jane retains her integrity, even after undergoing such mistreatment, betrayal and disappointment, she never compromises her values or what she believes to be right. -Linda G.\n\nItâs romantic, and Rochester is swoon-worthy, but itâs really about Jane being her own person and standing up for herself. She is independent, fierce, and shows remarkable wisdom for her age. I think itâs especially powerful given it was written in a time when women werenât viewed as fully realized people. -Nicole S.\n\nby L.M. Montgomery\n\nFirst Published: 1908\n\nWhen Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert reach out to an orphanage to give a home to a boy who could also help them out on their Prince Edward Island farm, a mix-up happens and eleven-year-old Anne Shirley is dropped off in their care. Not only is Anne not the boy they expected, but she's also mischievous, talkative, and has a bad temper! However, they also see her remarkable imagination and creativity.\n\nThis book is actually the first in a series of eight books, and as the series progresses, we see Anne go from school girl to college student to teacher to mother. This also made our Readersâ Favorites list for Best Book Series.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nWhatâs not to love?! Anneâs character is delightful and the shenanigans keep you laughing. -Teresa F.\n\nThis is a book I remember reading with my mom when I was young and it is a book I will share with my children in the future. It is a book I can cozy up with at any point now as an adult and think fondly of and feel comfortable recommending to almost anyone looking for something to read and enjoy. -Lindsay\n\nThe characters, the writing, the setting all have a place in my heart and on my favorites shelf.\n\nThe descriptive writing style lets you feel the joy and awe of Anne and how her spirit gentles the starkness and rigidity of the other characters. This book helped me notice that I love characters with no filter. -Tamara\n\nby Betty Smith\n\nFirst Published: 1943\n\nThis novel captures a unique time and place in Brooklyn after the turn of the century. It provides a poignant, and at times meandering, look at life in the 1910s that still deeply resonants with many readers as reflecting a universal experience.\n\nFrancie Nolan needed to be made of stern stuff from her earliest days. Growing up in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, New York, demanded fortitude, precocity, and strength of spirit - and Francie has each of these in spades. Neighbors often scorn her for her family's erratic and eccentric behavior, including her father's taste for alcohol and her Aunt Sissy's habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce. No one, least of all Francie, would say that the Nolans' life lacked drama.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been my favorite book since I first read it at 12. The story is beautiful and heartbreaking. The characters come alive off the page and even though it takes place over 100 years ago it remains relatable and poignant today. I read it every year and the story touches me every time. -Mary Kate Q.\n\nI first read this book when I was in elementary school in the 60s. I've read it many times since then. Francie and Nealy are every kid you know, no matter the time period or place. -Cheryl M.\n\nThe coming-of-age story is timeless and so well-written. The characters and emotions are both real and realistic.\n\nI first read this as a 12-year-old and since then I have read it numerous times and at each stage of my life I get something different from it. I love the characters and all of their flaws and optimism. -Kim\n\nby Margaret Mitchell\n\nFirst Published: 1936\n\nScarlett O'Hara is the beautiful, spoiled daughter of a well-to-do Georgia plantation owner. Before the Civil War her life revolved mostly around parties and flirting. However, after the war she sees her way of life collapse, and she uses every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty. Aside from the love story between Scarlett and Rhett, The Guardian sums it up well: âGone With the Wind is a story about civil war, starvation, rape, murder, heartbreak, and slavery.â\n\nIn Our Wordsâ¦\n\nLike many classic works, this controversial novel (which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937) reflects the views and language of a different era that can be very uncomfortable and upsetting to read through a modern lens. There is no escaping the racism portrayed in Gone With the Wind, and that should not be romanticized. However, erasing this book would not erase the historical realities that it portrays. If you choose to read this novel, we hope that its brutal honesty about the views held by many at the time serves to deepen your understanding of the Civil War and Reconstructionist era.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nWow. This book somehow portrays an unlikeable main character that you root for. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully attractive character who lights up the page. The setting is the Civil War, giving great insight into the Southâs point of view. The ending - unforgettable!\n\nAs dated as it is, it was one of my first classics and I was swept away!\n\nMargaret Mitchell has the ability to not just tell a story, but transport you to another time and place. Her characters are real people with real flaws, but we love them anyway.\n\nThe character development - Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most resilient characters in literature. The setting - the first book to be written about the Civil War from the perspective of the South. Itâs captivating.\n\nby Mary Shelley\n\nFirst Published: 1818\n\nShip captain Robert Walton is headed to explore the North Pole when the trip is interrupted by impassible ice. He meets dogsledder Viktor Frankenstein, who has struggled in the cold. When Walton brings Frankenstein on board to restore his health, he hears the tale of his past, including the monster that Frankenstein created and the after-effects of his scientific feat.\n\nFrankenstein is told in the epistolary form as a series of letters between Walton and his sister back home.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nWhile this book has had so many permutations throughout the years, the original novel is truly a story about loneliness, bigotry, and the struggle to understand one's place in the world, along with a side note of how easy it is for hate to rise out of a lack of empathy and understanding, something we are experiencing in big way in our current society.\n\nWho's my favorite character - the monster, of course. Anyone who has only experienced Frankenstein through movies, should definitely read the novel. Also, this is one of the first, if not the first, true science fiction novels and it's written by a young woman! - Laura M.\n\nIt is the progenitor of the gothic novel. It is written by a woman who actually published in her own name, and the back story of why she wrote this story is incredible. Her stepfather actually thought he could reanimate human life, not quite like Frankenstein did, but in his own sense. But this book talks about betrayal, abandonment, identity, loss, hate and love. The settings are wonderfully interesting and it can be just a tad scary. -Kathy C.\n\nIt is not what you think it is! Forget those black-and-white movies that turned it into something it was not! Many consider Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to be the first science fiction book ever written. - Kathy R.\n\nby Charles Dickens\n\nFirst Published: 1843\n\nMost of us will be familiar with the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who is visited by the ghosts of his former business partner, as well as the spirits of Christmas past, present, and yet to come. These visits help him embrace a kinder approach to life and Christmas.\n\nThis book is available with Kindle Unlimited as of 2/22/23.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nThis book greatly influenced the modern US celebration of Christmas and has been adapted hundreds of times in every manner and format. It is enjoyable to read the original. -Jen R.\n\nThe message is timeless. The characters are timeless. And the season of the year is timeless. Sure I have no clue what is in most of the food mentioned, but I donât care because it teaches a lesson I want to hear every year. -Jessica F.\n\nFirstly, this book is a great one to introduce someone to the \"classics\", as it is short and interesting throughout. I am a big Dickens fan, which I know many are not, due the wordiness of most of the authors of his time, but I feel as if his writing really helps you enter into a time and setting that is unfamiliar and become immersed in that world. His characters are immediately engaging and you want to know what happens to them.\n\nWhile \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is really my favorite Dickens, \"A Christmas Carol\" is one I read every year. I think most everyone can relate to this story of the good man oppressed by the evil overlord, but what makes this great is that it shows the redeeming qualities of a man that seems \"bad\" throughout, so in the end it gives you a feeling of hopefulness. Plus, looking back and forward in Scrooge's life through the ghosts is amazing and helps deepen your understanding of his character. It's through these glimpses into his life that you begin to see a ray of hope for redemption. -Laura M.\n\nby Ray Bradbury\n\nFirst Published: 1953\n\nSet in a bleak, dystopian future, this novel transports us to an unspecified city near the middle of the US after two atomic wars. Guy Montag is a fireman, but rather than putting out fires, his job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities - books, as well as the houses in which they are hidden.\n\nHis life is the same day in and day out. He causes destruction and ruin in the name of censorship without ever questioning his actions. All the while, his wife spends her time staring at the television (which has become, for many, a replacement for friends and family).\n\nEverything begins to change when Guy meets his seventeen-year-old neighbor, Clarisse, who loves nature, despises TV, and introduces him to the ideas of individualism and critical thought. She also causes him to question, for the first time, whether he is happy - and what happiness even means.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nHow can any self-pronounced lover of books not be in shock reading about a world of total censorship? Such a thought-provoking book to reread among all the talk of book banning today. Kris I.\n\nIt's always a good time to read Fahrenheit 451. The events, attitudes and circumstances are still here, 70 years later. The politics, social ideology, attitudes and focal points really haven't shifted as much as we think they have. -Irene I.\n\nIt is simply the story of how very important it is for everyone to have shared knowledge and be always willing to educate themselves to make a successful society. -Lori D.\n\nby Emily BrontÃ«\n\nFirst Published: 1847\n\nSet in the English moors of Yorkshire, this novel follows the life of Heathcliff, from childhood through adulthood. Orphaned as a child, Heathcliff is a Black boy who is adopted and brought up in a wealthy white household. When he grows up, he falls in love with the daughter of the family, Catherine. She loves him back but they fight all the time over the disparities in their positions.\n\nE. Lockhart, the author of We Were Liars, references this classic book throughout her own, and she describes Wuthering Heights as \"full of romance and ghosts and family feuds and a huge amount of anger.\"\n\nThis book is available with Kindle Unlimited as of 2/22/23.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nThis book I return to over and over again. I love the ghostly atmosphere and the tragic affairs of Catherine and Heathcliff. You sense from the beginning when it starts on a stormy night that no good can come from this story, and after reading it several times I donât really believe itâs their âloveâ story any more. They were the most tortured souls tormenting each other, trying to possess one another. True love would never have treated each other so selfishly and so cruel. But I still remain fascinated with the story and the storytelling. - Nikki L.\n\nEpic love story, full of craziness and family drama too. -Rebekah\n\nby Antoine de Saint\n\nFirst Published: 1943\n\nWhen a pilot crashes in the Sahara, he doesnât have enough food or water to survive long. As he wonders how to get out of this predicament, a little blond-haired boy appears and asks the pilot to draw him a picture of a sheep. This leads to a friendship, and the pilot learns the endearing little boy is from an asteroid and is out exploring other planets. At its core, this short read is about teaching the secret of what is really important in life.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nI read it as a child and fell in love with the main character, the little Prince. I read it with some of my students, and they loved it. It has a great message that Carrieâs through time. I traveled to Brussels once, and so much in the city was about the little Prince. -Wendy K.\n\nI keep this book in my bedside table and is the only book I have actually written in, underlining my favorite quotes. It is full of such lovely imagery - I wish I could learn enough French to read it in its original form. This is the type of book that speaks to your soul! -Mary Ann G.\n\nby John Steinbeck\n\nFirst Published: 1939\n\nWith the Great Depression gripping the nation, this epic novel from the 1930s chronicles the Dust Bowl migration that transformed the nation. The story follows a farm family - the Joads - who are driven from their homestead in Oklahoma and forced to travel west for promise of a better life in California. But when they finally arrive at their destination, the worst rumors prove true.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nIt tells of a significant period in American history in a way that is not taught in schools, from a human experience. The perspective of a family packing up their lives to escape the Dust Bowl and seek a new life, hopefully prosperous, including all their trials along the trip, is heartbreaking yet hopeful. -Lisa H.\n\nI read it the first time when I was a frivolous 30 year old. I didnât get it. I read it again after another 30+ years in a book club. It changed my life. I began to see all types of people with a new perspective - that very often, people are disadvantaged through no fault of their own and that others often are more than willing to take further advantage of them.\n\nThe Joads carried on despite their circumstances. My favorite line is âIt was her habit to build up laughter out of inadequate materials.â The book was banned in several states in 1939, calling it a âlibel and a lieâ by people who didnât like the depiction of how the dust bowl migrants were treated by the farmers in California and it's description of the dust bowl. It has been pulled from many school library shelves calling it âfilthâ due to profanity. -Pat S.\n\nby Kristin Hannah\n\nFirst Published: 2015\n\nThis is an unforgettable historical fiction novel about the experience of two sisters in France during World War II. It blends two different true events in a way that gives us a new perspective on life in France throughout the early 1940s.\n\nWhile an older sister is forced to host a German officer in her home, her younger rebellious sister joins the resistance movement. She makes heroic efforts to help British and American soldiers who parachute into France after their planes are disabled.\n\nThis novel is so popular with our readers that we created a full list of Books Like The Nightingale.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nI think it's important to remember even the difficult and tragic parts of history, so that they are not repeated. This was such a moving book, but their acts of resistance were inspiring, which I think is just as important â giving hope. -Lisa H.\n\nIt has beautiful writing and showcases the role of women in WWII. Like many other classics, it deals with what it means to be human. The book shows us the resiliency of humans, the ability of people to overcome the worst possible situations, and the strength that people find in themselves and each other.\n\nThis was possibly the most powerful book I have ever read. This work by Hannah was very well written and did a masterful job describing the French resistance during WWII. I could hardly do anything else while reading it and was unable to start a new book when I finished reading Nightingale. -Angela H.\n\nThere are many books written about WWII. There's something about this one, though - I was immersed in the visual in my mind. Reality faded away. It's another beautiful story about resilience, resistance, and sisterhood. And motherhood. It's simply amazing. -Elizabeth\n\nby Amor Towles\n\nFirst Published: 2021\n\nThis entire novel takes place within ten days in 1954. Eighteen-year-old Emmett has finished his term on a work farm, where he was sent after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The warden drives him home to Nebraska, where he plans to pick up his 8-year-old brother before heading west for a fresh start.\n\nHowever, Emmett discovers that two friends, Duchess and Wooly, from the work camp have stowed away in the trunk. The three teens and 8-year-old Billy adjust their plans and set out across the country together. The book is told from alternating points of view.\n\nOur readers also mentioned Towlesâ A Gentleman in Moscow as another book that is destined to become a classic.\n\nIn Our Readersâ Wordsâ¦\n\nCharacters were well-developed, he treated them with respect even with their flaws. Reminded me of Huck Finn in some respects. The adventure of traveling across country with hints of the Odyssey. There are lots of lessons to be learned from each character. -Mary R.\n\nThis book just feels like an instant classic. It's a tale of days gone by, an adventure, brothers, and the search for a new life. -Becca\n\nRoad trip, coming-of-age, evocative writing - all literary tropes that suck me right in and are told with Towlesâ singular panache. Itâs a beautifully constructed book. -Weezie F.\n\nThis book offers great character development as it tells the story of two young boys out on their own. The historical background is spot on. -Renee N."
