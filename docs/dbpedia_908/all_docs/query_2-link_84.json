        "text": "However, not all innovations are equal and nor do they follow a constant upward trend. Instead, their evolution takes the form of an S-shaped curve that reflects their typical lifecycle from early emergence to accelerating adoption, before finally stabilising and reaching maturity.\n\nIdentifying where a particular innovation is on this journey, especially those that are in the emerging and accelerating stages, is essential for understanding their current level of adoption and the likely future trajectory and impact they will have.\n\n290+ innovations will shape the automotive industry\n\nAccording to GlobalData’s Technology Foresights, which plots the S-curve for the automotive industry using innovation intensity models built on over 619,000 patents, there are 290+ innovation areas that will shape the future of the industry.\n\nWithin the emerging innovation stage, resilient spoke wheels, auto-transmission lubrication circuits, and ignition switching engines are disruptive technologies that are in the early stages of application and should be tracked closely. Engine purge actuators, electro-dynamic braking, and adsorptive vapour recovery system estimation are some of the accelerating innovation areas, where adoption has been steadily increasing. Among maturing innovation areas are collision avoidance braking control system and direct injection type engines, which are now well established in the industry.\n\nInnovation S-curve for the automotive industry\n\nMacpherson strut type suspension damperis a key innovation area in automotive\n\nThe MacPherson strut type suspension damper works by absorbing and dissipating the energy created by the movement of a vehicle. The strut compresses when a car hits a bump or pothole and the spring absorbs the shock, while the damper controls the oscillation of the spring, thereby helping to stabilise the vehicle. The damper contains oil and gas, which work together to resist the movement of the piston within the strut, creating friction that helps to slow down and smooth out the movement of the spring.\n\nGlobalData’s analysis also uncovers the companies at the forefront of each innovation area and assesses the potential reach and impact of their patenting activity across different applications and geographies. According to GlobalData, there are 30+ companies, spanning technology vendors, established automotive companies, and up-and-coming start-ups engaged in the development and application of Macpherson strut type suspension damper.\n\nKey players in Macpherson strut type suspension damper – a disruptive innovation in the automotive industry\n\n‘Application diversity’ measures the number of different applications identified for each relevant patent and broadly splits companies into either ‘niche’ or ‘diversified’ innovators.\n\n‘Geographic reach’ refers to the number of different countries each relevant patent is registered in and reflects the breadth of geographic application intended, ranging from ‘global’ to ‘local’.\n\nPatent volumes related to macpherson strut type suspension damper\n\nCompany Total patents (2021 - 2023) Premium intelligence on the world's largest companies Oiles 327 Unlock Company Profile AB SKF 261 Unlock Company Profile Schaeffler 184 Unlock Company Profile Zeppelin-Stiftung 79 Unlock Company Profile KYB 72 Unlock Company Profile ThyssenKrupp 67 Unlock Company Profile Toyota Motor 56 Unlock Company Profile Honda Motor 52 Unlock Company Profile Porsche Automobil Holding 45 Unlock Company Profile General Motors 43 Unlock Company Profile Hyundai Motor Group 36 Unlock Company Profile Mitsubishi Steel Mfg 35 Unlock Company Profile NHK Spring 34 Unlock Company Profile Tenneco 33 Unlock Company Profile Hitachi 31 Unlock Company Profile Bayerische Motoren Werke 31 Unlock Company Profile Renault 25 Unlock Company Profile Ford Motor 24 Unlock Company Profile Kia 21 Unlock Company Profile Sumitomo Electric Industries 20 Unlock Company Profile SNR Roulements 19 Unlock Company Profile ILJIN 18 Unlock Company Profile Vibracoustic 17 Unlock Company Profile Sistemi Sospensioni 17 Unlock Company Profile Hyundai Mobis 16 Unlock Company Profile Fox Factory Holding 13 Unlock Company Profile Bridgestone 12 Unlock Company Profile Continental 12 Unlock Company Profile Nissan Motor 11 Unlock Company Profile Societe Nouvelle de Roulements 10 Unlock Company Profile Polaris 8 Unlock Company Profile Zhejiang Geely Holding Group 7 Unlock Company Profile Compagnie de Saint-Gobain 6 Unlock Company Profile Vibracoustic North America 6 Unlock Company Profile Rollax 6 Unlock Company Profile Chudenko 5 Unlock Company Profile Mercedes-Benz Group 5 Unlock Company Profile BeijingWest Industries 5 Unlock Company Profile\n\nSource: GlobalData Patent Analytics\n\nOiles is one of the leading innovators in Macpherson strut type suspension damper with 327 patents. The company has developed new struts to improve crash performance. Vehicles equipped with Oiles’ MacPherson struts are likely to pass more stringent small overlap crashes because they are packaged with a sizable structure in the front crash structure compared to vehicles with double wishbone suspension. Other companies innovating in this technology domain are AB SKF, Hyundai, and Renault.\n\nTo further understand the key themes and technologies disrupting the automotive industry, access GlobalData’s latest thematic research report on Automotive."
