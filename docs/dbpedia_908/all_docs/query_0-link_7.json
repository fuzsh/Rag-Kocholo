        "text": "the ‘nauti-craft’ is a multihulled vessel featuring a unique hydraulic suspension system for gliding across rough sea surfaces. the system separates the hulls from the superstructure, allowing them to react rapidly to wave inputs and conform with the ocean surface. this provides increased levels of ride comfort, control and stability whether stationary, or travelling at speed. the added stability can be further enhanced with active control of the suspension system. the ‘nauti-craft’ has great potential applications for commercial, military, and recreational vessels.\n\nall images © nauti-craft\n\nthe ‘nauti-craft‘ offers exceptional levels of seakeeping and stability, reducing passenger discomfort and fatigue. its hydraulic suspension system also enables safer crew transfers in larger weather windows to fixed structures, such as offshore wind turbines, by reducing the relative movement between the vessel and the structure. the western-australia-based manufacturer has built and tested a number of prototypes, including a four hull craft ‘4play’, and most recently an eight and half metre catamaran ‘2play’.\n\nthe ‘nauti-craft DACS’ (deck attitude control system) actively adjusts and maintains the horizontal attitude of the deck at low speeds, and when manoeuvring relative to fixed structures, or coming along side larger vessels like ships. ‘DACS’ enhances the intrinsic ‘passive reactive’ and stable deck features of the vessel by providing additional control inputs in response to monitoring the movement of the deck. part of the design process has been an extensive dynamic simulation program. using adams ‘MSC’ software and nauti-craft’s proprietary dynamic models, its engineers calculate, analyze and validate a number of forces and motions in a range of operating conditions."
