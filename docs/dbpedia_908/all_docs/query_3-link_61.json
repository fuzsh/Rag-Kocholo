        "text": "RENK Group acquires North American Leader in Suspension Systems for Combat Mobility, Ontario – Canada\n\nRENK Group, through its suspension specialist Horstman, acquires General Kinetics and combines it with its existing advanced mobility center of excellence to create Horstman Canada.\n\nThe new company continues to provide superior mobility solutions and now joins with RENK’s strong US, European, and global footprint to deliver a full range of suspension and vibration mitigation. Horstman Canada provides combat proven mobility to both wheeled vehicles such as the Stryker family, and tracked vehicles such as the UK FV430, US Bradley and the M88 Recovery Vehicle.\n\n“Becoming part of RENK’s Horstman team reinforces our support to the Canadian and U.S. Army, and our allies,” Horstman Canada President Chuck Williamson said. “The new organization combines our long established operational excellence with advanced technology and international resources to provide best value to customers and the highest mobility to operators”.\n\nRENK CEO Susanne Wiegand noted “With this acquisition, we are consistently pursuing our path of growth and further internationalization.
