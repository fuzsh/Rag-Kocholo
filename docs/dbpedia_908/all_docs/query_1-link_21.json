This project report studies the active car suspension system through mathematical modeling and simulation in MATLAB/Simulink software. It first provides background on suspension systems and their advantages. It then discusses previous work on passive, semi-active, and active suspension systems, highlighting their techniques, strengths, and weaknesses. The report aims to develop equations for an active suspension system and analyze its components through separate mathematical models combined into an overall transfer function model.",
