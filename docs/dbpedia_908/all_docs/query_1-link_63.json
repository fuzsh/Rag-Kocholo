        "text": "This paper presents a control system for active Suspension systems which have been widely applied to vehicles, right from the horse-drawn carriages with flexible leaf springs fixed at the four corners, to the modern automobiles with complex control algorithms. This implementation includes constructing the transfer function of the control system then making a simulation using MATLAB software. It is found that active suspension system improves ride comfort even at resonant frequency. For step input the of 0.08 m, the sprung mass displacement has been reduced by 25 % which shows the improvement in ride comfort and sprung mass acceleration reduced by 89.93% .The suspension travel has been reduced by 74.64% and tire deflection has reduced by 89.73% .For the real application in vehicles, the proposed active suspension structure faces inevitably some challenges including the cost, the required space in vehicle and power consumption .\n\nConventional passive suspension systems lag in providing the optimum level of performance. Passive suspensions are a trade-off between the conflicting demands of comfort and control. An active suspension system provides both comfort and control along with active roll and pitch control during cornering and braking. Thus it gives a ride that is level and bump free over an incredibly rough terrain. This paper is a review the active suspension system and the modelling, simulation and control of an active suspension system in MATLAB/Simulink. The performance of the system is determined by computer simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. The performance of the system can be controlled and improved by proper tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The simulation study is performed to prove the effectiveness of this control approach and the performance of the system is compared with the conventional (passive) suspension system.\n\nSuspension system is used to fulfil the criteria of ride comfort and road handling. In this paper, a quarter car active & semi-active suspension systems are designed using Matlab/Script software. Comparison of active & semi-active suspension systems are done using robust control theory for the control targets suspension deflection, body acceleration and body travel. H infinity controller is selected to compare the two suspensions using time domain analysis. Finally the simulation result prove the effectiveness of the active suspension system by decreasing the body acceleration & sustaining the suspension deflection and body travel outputs."
