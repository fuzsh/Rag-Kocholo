Tenneco Inc, one of the world's biggest makers of car parts, is undeterred by the distance between its United States headquarters and the south-west of Western Australia. It has just paid $52 million for a better vehicle suspension system and is turning its new Dunsborough acquisition into a private \"skunkworks\" to continue developing smart ideas."
