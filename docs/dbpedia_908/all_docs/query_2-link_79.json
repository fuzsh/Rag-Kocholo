        "text": "Aeromodular TechnologyFeatures a frame with varying beam profiles at the throat, shaft and the head of the racquet, each of which are strategically shaped to reduce wind drag and boost swing speed. The result is easier access to power and spin\n\nAEROMODULAR 2 With the introduction of the 2015 Pure Aero Line, Babolat adds a closed bumper with submerged string channels and Woofers along with long side/short side string installation.\n\nAEROMODULAR 3 With the introduction of the 2019 Pure Aero Line, Babolat opens the bumper and removes the long side/short side string installation while keeping deeper string channels for protection against premature string breakage.\n\nWoofer *Woofer Technology from Babolat\n\nTHE FIRST DYNAMIC SYSTEM WHICH MAKES THE FRAME AND THE STRINGS INTERACT WHEN STRIKING THE BALL\n\nA tennis racket is a frame with strings. The frame is basically static and holds the driving force of the racquet - the strings - in place. The strings are attached to both sides of the frame. Only some strings are active when struck by the ball. This means that racquets do not deliver their full potential. Babolat set out to imagine a racquet optimizing the frame and the strings - to invent a frame which permits all the strings to work together to their full potential when striking the ball.\n\nPULLEY FUNCTION\n\n- The WOOFER eliminates string lock-up: the strings are free to move.\n\n- The whole surface area reacts on impact: with the WOOFER, more strings work together when striking the ball. The strings are interactive. This increases sweetspot size, improving forgiveness during off-center shots and absorbing much of the shock produced during ball impact.\n\nPISTON FUNCTION\n\n- Increase in the Trampoline Effect: The piston function enables greater surface deformation on impact, delivering 10% extra power and ensuring that the strings retain their energy for a longer time.\n\n- Shock Absorption: The pistons act like a suspension system to dampen unwanted vibration.\n\n2021 Pure Drive - SWX Pure Feel\n\nBabolat extends the SMAC (viscoelastic rubber) layer further up the shaft for increased dampening.\n\n2019 Pure Aero\n\nBabolat moves Cortex Pure Feel to 3 and 9 o'clock in the head. In addition to reducing harsh impact vibrations, this technology, when placed at this location, also increases dwell-time and spin potential.\n\n2018 Pure Drive Babolat places Cortex Pure Feel in the shaft in order to filter out harsh vibrations.\n\nCortex Pure Feel\n\nFor this version of Cortex Technology, Babolat partners with a company called SMAC, which supplies a thin viscoelastic rubber that is uniquely tailored to absorbing impact vibration. The material is put inside the frame between carbon layers. In addition to adding comfort, Babolat has designed this material technology to provide a great sound at impact along with a cleaner, more direct feel. The specific location of this technology varies with the racquet family.\n\nSonic Core Technology\n\nSonic Core Technology utilizes urethane and silicone in the head of the frame to increase dwell time and energy return for power and spin.\n\nSonic Core with Infinergy\n\nStarting with the 2019 CX Series and continuing through the 2020 SX & FX series and 2021 CX series Dunlop updates their Sonic Core Technology with a material called Infinergy. According to Dunlop, Infinergy is the world's first E-TPU (expanded thermoplastic polyurethene). Developed by BASF, this super elastic material is placed at 10 & 2 o'clock. It is desgiend to increase the racquet's rebound properties, resulting in higher ball speed. It also enhances dampening for a more comfortable feel at impact.\n\nd30\n\nd3o belongs to the \"smart materials\" category, which is a futuristic material with abnormal behavior characteristics. More specifically, d3o belongs to a subcategory of \"dilatant foams\", which dramatically change their behavior under dynamic loading or impact. Integrated in the lay-up and positioned in the shaft of the racquet, d3o offers new possibilities for tennis players. The d3o technology is able to sense the needs of the players during different strokes (it's able to adapt to you). On high-speed impacts (aggressive shots), the smart molecules lock together within nanoseconds and dramatically increase the stiffness of the whole racquet frame to provide maximum power. On slow-speed impacts (slice or drop shots), the d3o molecules absorb the impact to provide a softer touch for better feel. What does this mean to a tennis player? Passing shots are even harder and drop shots more precise, rewarding your spontaneity and supporting your courageous decisions.\n\nGraphene\n\nGraphene XT is the next generation of Graphene. This evolution of the original Graphene utilizes bigger platelets which allow for better bonding. The result is a racquet that is 20% lighter and 30% stronger, thus allowing for an even more optimal distribution of weight to the poles. Ultimately, by creating a racquet that accelerates more easily, and by putting more mass at the tip, closer to where modern ball strikers make contact, this technology gives the player easier access to power!\n\nKinetic System Technology\n\nKinetic Classic: This is the original Kinetic Technology. It feature thousands of micro-bearings housed inside multiple chambers surrounding the entire racquet head. As the racquet swings forward, the micro-bearings move to the back wall of the frame, loading energy. When the racquet strikes the ball, this kinetic mass transfers forward, adding power and reducing frame shock and vibration.\n\nKi (Kinetic + Ionic): This is the second generation of the Kinetic System. It uses an Ionic coating process to alleviate all static electricity to fully optimize the dynamic power of the micro-bearings. The result is MORE power, MORE Stability and MORE comfort.\n\nKi Quadfocus (Kinetic + Ionic + Quadfocus): This third generation of the Kinetic System includes the Ionic coating process but also concentrates the location of the Kinetic chambers in only four compartments around the head: 10 & 2 and 8 & 4 o'clock. By relocating the secondary mass to less stable regions of the frame, ProKennex has created a more solid feeling racquet, one that better deploys the arm saving properties of Kinetic Technology.\n\n2017 & 2019 Q+ Series: ProKennex improves Quadfocus Technology by expanding the Kinetic Energy Chambers by 25%! The result is even more vibration dampening along with greater torsional stability and shock reduction (according to ProKennex). Also with the Q+ Series ProKennex updated the frame chassis with a QShape to expand the sweetspot, representing a high performance output over a larger surface area.\n\n2018 & 2020 Ki Series ProKennex adds a carbon coating to the Kinetic micro-bearings in the butt cap. Named the Comfort Cap, this handle technology has long been a part of the Kinetic series. It uses moveable mass to help provide \"best of class\" vibration dampening and comfort.\n\nVFeel Technologies\n\nPLEASE NOTE: for 2020 Volkl's VCELL line has the same technologies as the VFEEL series but with 3x as much VCELL material for added comfort, stability and feel.\n\nVCELL VCELL is a cellulose form of black carbon. Strong, lightweight, natural polymer added to strategic locations of the racquet's layup to improve vibration freqeuncy, feel and responsiveness.\n\nREVA Volkl updates its VSENSOR dampening system with a revolutionary material called EVA +, a unique compound & resin placed beneath the handle pallets. The result, according to Volkl, is 35% more resiliency for faster rebounding. It is also denser for greater dampening and more optimal feedback.\n\nVTEX Volkl adds a new silicone polymer to their butt cap for better dampening. This material technology also helps the butt cap resist cracking and movement for a more solid feel.\n\nOther technologies include Volkl's Super Grommet System, which is a grommet technology that combines Volkl's Speed Grommets, which allows the strings to move in all possible directions, with V-Sponse material, which increases the \"Spring Effect\". The result is a grommet system that provides exceptional dampening and power.\n\nTriad Technology\n\nAccording to Wilson, the traditional one-piece racquet design may minimize critical playing characteristics (power, comfort, control) when attempting to maximize another.\n\nBut what if the hoop and the handle never touched? Not only could you maximize power in the hoop and control in the handle, you could isolate shock and prevent it from reaching the arm. For the first time ever, you could design a racquet that didn't compromise.\n\nIntroducing TRIAD, a revolutionary tri-component design that (according to Wilson) maximizes power, control, and comfort without compromising one for the other.\n\nThe hoop and the handle of a TRIAD racquet are designed as customized components. They never touch, thus making this one of the most dampened, low-shock racquets avaialble."
