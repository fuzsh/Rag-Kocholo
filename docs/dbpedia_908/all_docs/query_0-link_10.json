        "text": "Chris Heyring has been mastering stabilising technology for over 35 years, pioneering global stability solutions for industry-leading companies including McLaren, Toyota, and Nissan. With Chris’ background, it’s not a huge surprise that with his son Toby they saw the wobbly table problem as something that could be, and had to be, solved.\n\nToby Heyring was raised by his parents Chris and Anny (both art school graduates, with Chris often being confused for an engineer) with the freedom to explore ideas and be inquisitive with a range of interests. As a child it was obvious Toby had inherited the inventor gene, designing and building model boats and cars from scratch, to now, as an adult creating new prototypes and expanding the NOROCK product range. Toby’s passion for refinement and advancement shows in NOROCK’s continuous improvement ethos.\n\nChris and Toby began working on a range of self-stabilising table base prototypes in their Dunsborough workshop in 2009, filing their first patent in 2010. Up to 2016, NOROCK was purely a technical company interested in product design, engineering, IP and manufacturing. But it was time to sell the product – enter Claire Spalding, CEO + Chair, who with her love for interiors and background in marketing, helped develop the NOROCK brand and introduce it to the hospitality industry worldwide. With our expanded team around the world, we’re excited to work with our network of distributors and reps to say NO to wobbles, spills, time-wasting, problematic parts, with NO compromise on design – in restaurants, cafes, bars, aged care, and offices.\n\nFrom the cobblestone streets of Europe to the poured concrete sidewalks in America, from the wooden decks in Japan to the brick-paved beer gardens in the UK… to our home country, Australia and its uneven laneways. NOROCK can be found worldwide, and with its simple self-stabilising mechanism and award-winning design, anything else is a compromise.\n\n[ NOROCK USA ]\n\nIn early 2020, NOROCK USA LLC was born out of a desire to meet the needs of the American market by providing sales and warehouse distribution from within.\n\nWith our warehouse full of stock and our VP Sales, Martin Bolick, located in Illinois, customer service and delivery of stock are a breeze throughout the Americas. Martin has a strong history in furniture and loves to chat about how a self-stabilizing table base can be the customer touchpoint that your business needs, or, that can add that extra wow factor to the design you’re presenting (we love speaking to interior designers and architects, too!).\n\nNOROCK USA has many representatives dotted throughout the states, who can assist in fit-outs of large fast-food chains to high-end dining to “Mom-and-Pop” stores with our self-stabilizing indoor/outdoor table bases. You can find a NOROCK representative near you or email Martin on martin@no-rock.com to find out more information.\n\nPictured: Miriam, New York.\n\n[ NOROCK AUSTRALIA ]\n\nNOROCK self-stabilising table bases were born and bred in Australia, so we are really excited that in early 2021, we landed stock in Sydney to ship directly from our warehouse throughout the country.\n\nWe have some incredible furniture distributors all over Australia who would love to talk to any and all interior designers, architects, restaurant owners, commercial offices and more about specifying our self-stabilising table bases for your projects.\n\nPictured: RAFI, Sydney."
