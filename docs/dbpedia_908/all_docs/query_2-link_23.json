        "text": "Automated Live-Cell Imaging and Detection of Fluorescent Labeling Provides Rich Datasets for Analyzing, Characterizing, and Identifying Cell Death in Response to Perturbagens\n\nWe developed SPARKL chiefly to capture kinetic cell death data since traditional methods utilizing flow cytometry are limited to endpoint data. Additionally, we aimed to design a workflow compatible with high-throughput studies while requiring minimal handling and retaining high sensitivity and specificity. Here, we capitalize on the advent of high-content in-incubator live-cell imagers to capture cellular phenotypes, measure fluorescent signals, and analyze data in real time through regular scanning schedules. This technology eliminates the requirement for disruptive handling (e.g., trypsinization, pipet-induced shear forces, centrifugation, and incubation in labeling buffers) and is non-invasive to cells in culture. The repeated observation of samples and coupled automated real-time analysis also collects richer datasets in a workflow that is less labor and time intensive than analogous workflows using flow cytometry ( ).\n\nOne significant benefit of this method is that cells are incubated in normal growth media containing fluorescent probes thereby eliminating stepwise processing. Therefore, detection reagents must be non-disruptive, highly specific, culture-stable, non-labile, and readily detectable when incubated with cells for prolonged periods of time. Most fluorescent probes used in flow cytometry are not compatible in kinetic assays due to photobleaching or cytotoxic effects with prolonged exposure. Therefore, we sought to find reagents that would have no negative effect when incubated with cells over time. AV labels apoptotic cells by detecting phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which is exposed during caspase-dependent cell death (Devaux, 1991). We began these studies by testing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled recombinant AV and cell-impermeable viability dye Y3 for compatibility within our method (Logue et al., 2009; Gelles and Chipuk, 2016). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in growth media containing AV and Y3, co-treated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and cycloheximide (CHX) to promote apoptosis, and subjected to SPARKL using a high-content in-incubator live-cell imager. The kinetic data captured the lag phase followed by the robust labeling of MEFs undergoing death ( ). Here, cells were cultured in media containing sufficient calcium for robust AV labeling, but alternative media formulations may require calcium supplementation (Meers and Mealy, 1993). Importantly, cells not treated with TNFα + CHX exhibited no toxicity as a consequence of either fluorescent probe at the highest concentrations ( , “UT” line). As expected, the stoichiometric method of AV labeling was observed as the concentration-dependent decrease in number of positive events. Said another way, low concentrations of AV will bind to cells exposing PS but may not generate sufficient signal (as defined by the intensity, size, and segmentation of the fluorescent event) according to the user-defined processing definition (see STAR Methods). However, both AV and Y3 were capable of strong and sustained labeling in live-cell imagers at concentrations approximately 10-fold below what is used in flow cytometric assays (Gelles and Chipuk, 2016). Detected fluorescent intensity was greater for MEFs treated in DMEM lacking phenol red than similarly treated MEFs in phenol red containing media ( ). Therefore, all future applications of SPARKL utilized phenol red free culture media.\n\nCollection of high-content images of cells in culture is the foundation of SPARKL, which capture cellular morphology and fluorescent signal. To demonstrate the diversity and specificity of data collected with SPARKL, Bax+/+Bak+/+ and Bax−/−Bak−/− (wild type [WT] and double knockout [DKO], respectively), MEFs were cultured in media containing AV-FITC and Y3, treated with perturbagens, and subjected to the SPARKL workflow. Images from select time points were manually reviewed to observe cellular morphology and detection of fluorescent labeling ( ). Green and red pixels from each collected image were quantified in real time using a trained algorithm and reported as the number of AV+ and Y3+ events observed at each time point ( ). To assess the selectivity of our fluorescent probes, MEFs were instigated to die through the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (via co-treatment of TNFα + CHX), the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (via topoisomerase inhibitor, VP16), or non-apoptotic pathway of ferroptosis (via cysteine-glutamate antiport inhibitor, erastin) (Peltzer et al., 2016; Dixon et al., 2012). Both AV and Y3 demonstrated accuracy and selectivity by labeling cells in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, VP16-treated MEFs exhibited the longest lag phase before onset of death and demonstrated AV positivity more rapidly than Y3 positivity, reflecting the biology of PS exposure prior to loss of plasma membrane integrity during apoptosis. To qualitatively compare AV positivity between WT and DKO MEFs, data collected at specific time points were extracted and visualized side by side ( ). It is worth noting that WT and DKO MEFs proliferate at different rates and therefore result in vastly different populations over the course of a short experiment (exampled in ). As such, the y axes for the two cell lines are not congruent but are graphed appropriately based on internal control conditions (see STAR Methods); we explore methods for appropriate data comparisons and normalization in later sections. An important aspect of this methodology is that data are collected via cell imaging and can be backtracked to the original visualization of the cells in culture. As an example, collection and visualization of these data from DKO MEFs treated with VP16 reveals that the morphological phenotypes observed in these cells does not coincide with probe labeling and therefore is not indicative of cell death ( – ). In this way, we have demonstrated the depth of data collected using SPARKL and how it can be visualized for thorough interpretation of experimental results.\n\nInvestigations of apoptotic cell death commonly employ AV-binding assays due to the exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane following caspase-mediated cleavage of scramblases and flippases (Suzuki et al., 2013; Segawa et al., 2014). Exposure of PS is indicative of the underlying apoptotic signaling and precedes loss of plasma membrane integrity caused by breakdown of cellular homeostatic processes. Therefore, apoptotic studies occasionally utilize a dual-labeling methodology of AV with a cell-impermeable viability dye (such as PI or DRAQ7) in order to characterize cells in early or late apoptosis by dichotomizing single-positive and dual-positive events (Jiang et al., 2016). However, cells undergoing non-apoptotic cell death often do not exhibit this sequential labeling because loss of plasma membrane integrity occurs without the preceding exposure of PS. As a consequence, cells label with the viability dye and AV simultaneously, which is indistinguishable from cells in late apoptosis when analyzed by flow cytometry ( ). Therefore, we investigated whether the kinetic data of SPARKL could distinguish between apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death using a similar dual-labeling approach.\n\nTo assess the capability of SPARKL to dichotomize kinetic labeling patterns, we cultured WT MEFs in growth media containing AV-FITC, Y3, and perturbagens engaging either the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (TNFα + CHX), intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (CHX or VP16), or non-apoptotic ferroptosis (erastin) ( ). Cell populations instigated to die by TNFα + CHX or VP16 exhibited AV positivity prior to Y3 positivity, indicative of apoptotic cell death. By contrast, cells instigated to die by high concentrations of CHX alone or erastin demonstrated similar kinetics of labeling with AV and Y3. Additionally, we co-treated cells with ABT-737 (an inhibitor to multiple anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins) and/or zVAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) to further characterize mechanisms of cell death in response to each perturbagen using the SPARKL assay (Oltersdorf et al., 2005; Thornberry et al., 1992). Cells dying via apoptosis demonstrated accelerated or attenuated rates of AV labeling in response to co-treatment with ABT or zVAD, respectively; cells dying via ferroptosis demonstrated no change in kinetics of AV labeling. By comparison, kinetics of Y3 labeling exhibited less resolution and only modest changes in cells co-treated with ABT or zVAD.\n\nDR-mediated apoptosis can occur either through a mitochondrial-independent or mitochondrial-dependent pathway, termed type I and type II respectively, and the latter signals through members of the BCL-2 family of proteins (Jost et al., 2009). Kinetic data collected by the SPARKL workflow clearly revealed that WT MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX signal primarily via the type II pathway, as evidenced by the synergic labeling of AV in cells co-treated with ABT. To further interrogate the mechanism of cell death engaged by each perturbagen, we replicated this treatment strategy in DKO MEFs ( ). DKO MEFs treated with VP16 demonstrated minimal labeling due to the requirement of BAX and BAK for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. By contrast, DKO MEFs treated with erastin exhibited similar kinetics of death compared to WT MEFs. DKO MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX died with similar kinetics as their WT counterparts, consistent with DR signaling, which is independent of BAX and BAK. Furthermore, DKO MEFs exhibited similar kinetics for both AV and Y3. Interestingly, DKO MEFs treated with CHX alone exhibited death similar to analogously treated WT MEFs but did not synergize with ABT, suggesting that CHX treatment engaged multiple pathways of cell death that were selectively amplified with particular co-treatments or in different model systems.\n\nWe have generalized programmed cell death pathways as either apoptotic or non-apoptotic, the latter of which has been modeled by ferroptosis. However, DR signaling can initiate non-apoptotic cell death programs, such as necroptosis, when caspases are inhibited (Vercammen et al., 1998; Kawahara et al., 1998). WT MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX demonstrated attenuated cell death when co-treated with zVAD, suggestive of apoptosis, but DKO MEFs exhibited a modest increase, suggestive of necroptosis ( and ). When caspases are inhibited, the switch from DR-mediated apoptosis to necroptosis is initiated by an interaction between the receptor-interacting serine-threonine-protein kinase-1 (RIPK1) and the receptor-interacting serine-threonine-protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), which is regulated by the ubiquitylation profile of RIPK1, resulting in RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL, which consequentially oligomerizes and permeabilizes the plasma membrane (Sun et al., 2012; Weinlich et al., 2017). It has been reported that simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40)-transformed MEFs do not express RIPK3 sufficiently to induce a strong necroptotic program and so we expanded our investigations to different established cellular models (Moujalled et al., 2013). First, we utilized MEFs deficient in cylindromatosis (CYLD), a RIPK1 deubiquitinase, which were reconstituted with either CYLD or a vehicle control (O’Donnell et al., 2011). Cyld−/− MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX exhibited cell death but only the MEFs reconstituted with CYLD demonstrated increased or decreased death following co-treatment with zVAD or the RIPK1 inhibitor, Necrostatin-1 (Nec1), respectively (Degterev et al., 2005) ( ). Additionally, MEFs dying by necroptosis exhibited similar labeling kinetics of AV and Y3, which parallels the labeling phenotype we observed in MEFs dying by ferroptosis.\n\nCHX co-treatment reveals pro-death pathways by inhibiting translation of pro-survival genes downstream of TNFα signaling. To better study labeling kinetics of cells dying by necroptosis, we utilized the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic, birinapant (Brp), to inhibit RIPK1 ubiquitylation by cIAP1/2 and subsequent pro-survival signal cascade (Holler et al., 2000). As a consequence of inhibiting RIPK1 ubiquitylation, the requirement of CYLD to initiate necroptosis was greatly reduced, and therefore, we moved to an MLKL-dependent model (data not shown). Primary Mlkl+/+ adult ear fibroblasts (WT AEFs) were cultured from mice and treated with TNFα + Brp with or without co-treatment of zVAD or Nec1 (TB, TBZ, and TBN, respectively). While AV labeling kinetics appeared unchanged in TBZ-treated WT AEFs, Y3 demonstrated a dramatic and rapid labeling profile specific to a necroptotic outcome ( ). Necroptosis is defined by the regulated permeabilization of the plasma membrane by oligomeric MLKL and therefore the rapid labeling by a viability dye is consistent with this phenotype (Wang et al., 2014). However, the unchanged labeling kinetics of AV was unexpected, particularly for cells that became necroptotic hours prior. Images collected during SPARKL revealed a distinct cellular morphology in TBZ-treated WT AEFs, which did not contract, retained a topologically distinct and normal nucleus, and slowly exposed PS resulting in a weak AV signal over the large area of the cell ( , upper panel). Curiously, a subpopulation of the cells exhibited the same weak AV signal but demonstrated no Y3 labeling ( , upper inset panel). It has been reported that necroptotic cells are capable of exposing PS following MLKL activation, but prior to complete loss of plasma membrane integrity, which could explain these observations (Gong et al., 2017a). TBZN-treated WT AEFs resembled an apoptotic phenotype characterized by cellular contraction and formation of apoptotic bodies ( , bottom panel). We repeated the experiment using Mlkl−/− primary adult ear fibroblasts (KO AEFs) and observed that these cells were both less sensitive to TNFα + Brp and also completely protected by addition of zVAD, suggestive of apoptotic cell death ( ). We investigated if SPARKL could detect population heterogeneity by coculturing WT and KO AEFs. As the ratio of WT to KO AEFs decreased, we observed a concomitant decrease or absence of TNFα + Brp sensitivity and necroptotic labeling signatures ( ).\n\nIt is worth noting that minimal cell death was observed in TBN-treated WT AEFs ( ). Paradoxically, TBZN-treated WT AEFs resembled the TNFα + Brp-only condition and exhibited apoptosis-like morphology ( – ). Cells unable to undergo necroptosis may eventually resolve the zVAD-induced caspase inhibition and revert to an apoptotic program. Alternatively, they may be undergoing a necroptotic program that either does not require, or is revealed by the inhibition of, RIPK1 (Lin et al., 2016; Newton et al., 2016). The KO AEFs do not parallel these observations and while this could suggest that death in response to TBZN is MLKL dependent, data collected with SPARKL revealed that TBZN-induced cell death does not resemble necroptosis by either labeling kinetics or morphology. Nec1 binds the kinase domain of RIPK1, which is responsible for propagating the pro-death signal cascade, and has been shown to selectively inhibit necroptosis in cells induced via a DR and co-treatment with CHX ± zVAD (Degterev et al., 2008). However, both apoptosis and necroptosis are inhibited by Nec1 in cells which are induced via a co-treatment with a SMAC mimetic, due to requirement of RIPK1 for the formation of the caspase-8 activating complex, and we observed this differential effect of Nec1 in our studies as well (Wang et al., 2008) ( and ).\n\nWe validated that the SPARKL workflow is not only high throughput and less labor intensive but also versatile and capable of observing and characterizing cell death following exposure to perturbagens. Specifically, we demonstrated that kinetic data gathered by the SPARKL workflow can reveal deeper insights regarding the mechanism of cell death when utilizing a dual-labeling approach. Cells dying by apoptosis sequentially label with AV and then with a viability dye while cells dying by ferroptosis exhibit similar kinetics for both labels. In stark contrast, necroptotic cell death exhibited the reverse phenotype in which cells robustly label with the viability dye and then slowly accumulated AV over time. It was recently reported that cells can exhibit AV labeling prior to viability dye labeling due to the formation of PS-containing “bubbles” on the plasma membrane following MLKL activation (Gong et al., 2017b). This phenotype was demonstrated to be rapid and transient and required highly sensitive technologies to detect. While we saw no evidence of this phenotype, we believe this is a consequence of the difference in signal detection sensitivity and time resolution between methodologies and therefore do not believe the results to be inherently contradictory. Furthermore, these differences exemplify the importance of utilizing multiple specialized techniques to further understand the molecular mechanisms of cell death.\n\nKinetic Data Gathered by SPARKL Provide Several Quantitative Metrics for Investigative and Comparative Analyses of Cell Death at Both Single-Cell and Population Level\n\nCell death assays using flow cytometry provide only endpoint data and are typically visualized as comparative bar graphs, signal quadrant plots, or histograms of fluorescent intensity. SPARKL is more data rich due to both the collection of kinetic data and underlying cell imaging methodology. However, while the utilization of real-time live-cell imaging is becoming more commonplace, most users do not fully explore the depth of the technology or the data it generates when analyzing their experiments. Furthermore, the advantages of these technologies are further minimized by use of endpoint data, simplified comparisons, and labeling methods repurposed from flow cytometry (Goodall et al., 2016). Therefore, we aimed to broaden the landscape of experimental designs performed with high-content imagers while interrogating how kinetic data could best be utilized to examine phenomena currently overlooked by analogous workflows.\n\nIn the previous section, we characterized the labeling profiles for cells instigated to die by several cell death pathways as observed by real-time live-cell imagers. Not only did the labeling order differ between pathways, but the kinetics and sensitivity of those labeling events were also observably different. To articulate the relative labeling kinetics for each pathway, we expressed kinetic data as the difference between AV- and Y3-positive events over time ( ). Representation of data in this manner clearly identifies the period when differential labeling is most observed and how this period is variable between treatments or pathways of cell death. Applying the same method to WT and KO AEF data revealed dissimilar sequential labeling in the TNFα + Brp treatment ( ). Thus, these data suggest that TNFα + Brp-induced cell death in KO AEFs was more apoptosis-like but signaled by a different mechanism in the WT AEFs. Inspecting the labeling data taken from a coculture of WT and KO AEFs clearly demonstrated how labeling phenotypes are more difficult to identify in heterogeneous populations. The cocultured AEFs retained similar labeling kinetics of AV but exhibited notably different Y3 labeling when compared to either homogeneous population ( and ). Similarly, expressing data as the difference between relative AV- and Y3-positive events reveals a trend concomitant with the combination of the two cellular populations ( ).\n\nKinetic data collected by SPARKL represent populations of dying cells labeled with fluorescent probes, but each cell is detected as a binary process according to the specifics of automated detection (see STAR Methods). We utilized a coculture of AEFs as an exaggerated example to illustrate how data interpretation can be less clear in heterogeneous populations. However, heterogeneity in response to a perturbagen, and subsequent kinetics of cell death and labeling, is the culmination of many biological and stochastic factors that are not necessarily so overt in isogenic populations (Roux et al., 2015; Inde and Dixon, 2018). Therefore, we explored methods in which SPARKL could assess heterogeneity in a population dying in response to a perturbagen. Instead of viewing data as cumulative, kinetic data can be processed and expressed as the number of new events over time. Comparing histograms of events per hour revealed more rapid labeling of AV compared to Y3 in apoptotic models, overlapping histograms in ferroptosis, and stark Y3-first sequential labeling in cells undergoing necroptosis ( ). These data better illustrate labeling trends within the cell population and therefore can be analyzed for population statistics (such as reporting mean, median, and deviation of cell events within the population). Additionally, data expressed in this manner can reveal subpopulations that label differentially and therefore could reflect different biological mechanisms. For instance, we consistently observed “shelves,” which were most noticeable when the perturbagen resulted in rapid and robust cell death.\n\nLive-cell imagers observe the same cells over time and we utilized this technological advantage for our dual-labeling workflow to quantify the time-to-signal for both fluorophores. WT MEFs and AEFs were instigated to die, analyzed by this method, and graphed as the time to single positive followed by time to double positive. Labeling kinetics were treatment specific, but the time in which AV-labeled cells sequentially labeled with Y3 was highly variable ( ). For example, 75% of MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX + ABT labeled with AV by 5 h and co-labeled on average 3.2 h later; the slowest 10% were variable. This analysis observed cells once they became AV+ and then assessed the time in which the cell became double positive. Cells that labeled simultaneously or in reverse order are visualized as a bar with no red phase, and this pattern appeared more often in non-apoptotic cell death. To corroborate this observation, the same data were reanalyzed to track the time to Y3+ and then double-positivity ( ). Few apoptotic cells exhibited AV labeling after Y3 (visualized by the lack of green phase in most bars) but ferroptotic cells exhibited approximately 50% of Y3-first sequential labeling. This analysis revealed a bifurcation within the population of treated AEFs: half of the population demonstrated a phenotype consistent with necroptosis (i.e., rapid onset of Y3 followed by variable AV labeling), while the other half exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (i.e., lengthy and highly variable labeling time and Y3 labeling after AV). This phenotype could be a consequence of Brp-mediated inhibition within the cell or the association of oligomeric MLKL with membranes other than the plasma membrane, such as the mitochondria (Wang et al., 2014).\n\nThe labeling metrics of the population can be statistically compared to further characterize pathway- or treatment-specific patterns of cell death ( ). Instances of sequential labeling can be confirmed and quantified by comparing individual label kinetics to double-positive kinetics. For example, Y3 and double-positive kinetics of VP16 + ABT-treated MEFs are not significantly different, which indicated that double-positivity depended on the occurrence of Y3. Similarly, the reverse phenotype was observed in AEFs undergoing necroptosis. Ferroptotic MEFs exhibited significantly distinct labeling kinetics for AV, Y3, and double-positivity, which indicated no sequential labeling and likely reflects the biochemistry of the currently unknown method by which lipid peroxidation results in cell death (Feng and Stockwell, 2018). Additionally, this method provides a convenient strategy to assess synergistic treatments ( ). For example, MEFs induced to undergo apoptosis exhibited significantly different labeling kinetics in response to ABT while ferroptotic MEFs did not. Importantly, the pattern of distributions, while occurring earlier, was conserved and therefore reflected a treatment-mediated synergy of the death pathway. In stark contrast, the switch from apoptosis to necroptosis in AEFs exhibited significantly different labeling kinetics as well as different patterns of distribution. Collectively, these data demonstrate a method and rationale for use of high-content live-cell imagers to characterize and compare differential labeling kinetics at the single-cell resolution.\n\nWhile there are instances to perform the deep analyses we described above, it does not represent the common usage of live-cell imagers for cell death analyses–namely high-volume comparative studies. To take full advantage of the high-throughput capacity of these technologies, complex kinetic data must be expressed as simplified key parameters for comparison. Here, we will review best practices for comparing SPARKL data as well as several mathematical methods for rapid parameterization of the collected data ( ). Instinctually, investigators often use the maximum number of events to compare cell death data and use language akin to “A had more or less death than B.” However, the amplitude of kinetic curves reflects extraneous factors such as cell number or the penetrance of a particular perturbagen. This is why graph axes are set by control treatments and do not need to be the same scale between cell types (such as data in ). Additionally, using the maximal number of events (i.e., death) is highly reductionist and does not reflect metrics that are uniquely collected by real-time methodologies which are collectively referred to as the “kinetics” of cell death (e.g., times of onset, 50% death, plateau, and maximal rate of death). Therefore, we recommend drawing comparisons from cell death kinetics.\n\nThe simplest method is to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), which compresses kinetic data into a single parameter for convenient comparisons. WT and DKO MEFs were instigated to die using a variety of perturbagens, co-treated with ABT or zVAD, and detected by AV and Y3 labeling ( ). AUC values were greater in cells co-treated with ABT and reduced in cells co-treated with zVAD for perturbagens activating apoptosis but unchanged in cells undergoing ferroptosis. AUC calculated from Y3 detection exhibit similar trends in response to ABT and zVAD albeit to a lesser degree ( ). These examples retained the observed trends of AV and Y3 labeling within the raw kinetic data.\n\nOther metrics of interest are rate of death and the time-to-maximal rate of death. The first derivative was calculated for data collected from MEFs treated with perturbagens and labeled with AV ( ). The derivative reports the rate of cell death within the population, or the slope of kinetic curves, at each time point. MEFs undergoing apoptosis demonstrated greater and earlier rates of cell death in response to ABT while exhibiting lower rates in response to zVAD ( , yellow and purple data). Additionally, data can be presented as the time-to-maximal rate of death; however, this parameter is more informative for samples exhibiting significant death and labeling over the course of data collection ( ). These mathematical analyses represent simple but robust methods to quantitatively compare experimental conditions.\n\nTo quantify data in a manner that retains the richness of kinetic data, we employed a non-linear fit analysis to the SPARKL-collected data. A lag one-phase exponential (LOPE) function provided the best fit for our data and has been utilized successfully by other groups for modeling cell death kinetics (Forcina et al., 2017) ( ). The LOPE function calculates two useful parameters during the fit analysis: the duration of the lag phase (t′) and the rate of cell death following the lag phase (RD). This model assumes that RD is the maximal rate of cell death, which is not always accurate, but consistently fit data more accurately than other models (for example, sigmoidal functions). We do not suggest using the plateau’s amplitude (DM) for comparative studies as it reflects cell number; however, we discuss data normalization in a later section. AV-labeled MEFs undergoing apoptosis demonstrated ABT-mediated reduction in t′ while remaining unchanged in ferroptosis ( ). RD trends calculated from AV data were harder to interpret since the metric only differed in MEFs co-treated with CHX and ABT ( ). This may be an indication that perturbagen concentrations were excessive or that the time of maximal death significantly differs from the RD calculated using LOPE. Interestingly, t′ from Y3 data did not reflect changes in response to ABT and RD values increased ( and , red data). Data viewed as two-parameter plots reveal treatment- or cell-type-specific trends and has been shown to be effective for characterizing cell death mechanisms for perturbagens of unknown biology or multi-parametric drug panels (Forcina et al., 2017; Fallahi-Sichani et al., 2013) ( ). This method for comparative study does not appear to benefit from the dual-label approach, so we recommend using whichever label is more relevant to the experimental design.\n\nThe advent of high-content live-cell imagers provides investigators the opportunity to collect and analyze cellular data in a high-volume, high-throughput manner in real time. However, these technologies are not often used to their fullest potential and instead serve as a surrogate for flow cytometric workflows. To capitalize on the advantages of these technologies, we have provided several methods and best practices for utilizing and interpreting the data in comparative studies. We described a multiplex labeling workflow to demonstrate the variety of experimental designs compatible with these machines as well as several methods to parameterize and appropriately compare collected data. Collectively, these examples showcase the versatility, range of applications, breadth and depth of collected data, and analyses investigators can apply to experimental paradigms by using the SPARKL workflow.\n\nSimultaneous Collection of Proliferation and Cell Death Data to Accurately Characterize Perturbagen-Induced Cytostatic and Cytotoxic Effects\n\nThe high-throughput capacity of SPARKL permits investigators to conduct exhaustive optimizations and drug titrations with relative ease. However, perturbagens at sub-lethal concentrations may still affect rates of cell proliferation, either directly or as a consequence while mitigating the underlying stress. Additionally, it has been shown that growth rate inhibition metrics can correct otherwise confounding data in large-scale drug screens (Hafner et al., 2016). Therefore, investigators require a method to properly assess the cytostatic effects of perturbagens on cells in culture. This is commonly accomplished by either measuring confluency or surface area metrics, which do not accurately reflect cell numbers, or by requiring the investigator to generate cell lines expressing fluorescent proteins, which is laborious, limiting, and not conducive to high-throughput analyses (Artymovich and Appledorn, 2015). Previously, we described a method utilizing non-toxic carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to label cells prior to treatment and data acquisition (Gelles and Chipuk, 2016). This method required additional handling steps, suffered mild photobleaching, and was not compatible with certain cell types. Therefore, we sought to develop a label-and-go protocol of SPARKL that would simultaneously collect proliferation and cell death data in real time without requiring a separate cell-labeling step ( ).\n\nWe investigated if cell-permeable, low-affinity cyanine nucleic acid stains were suitable for prolonged incubation with cells. To assess cytostatic and cytotoxic effects, MEFs were incubated with varying concentrations of SYTO green fluorescent dyes and AV conjugated with AlexaFluor 594 ( ). Each tested SYTO dye exhibited toxicity at high concentrations and degrees of cytostatic behavior at low- to mid-range concentrations. Low-concentration ranges of SYTO16 and SYTO21 demonstrated no adverse effects to cell proliferation or viability, and we ultimately selected SYTO21 for use within SPARKL workflows. SYTO21 primarily labeled cells in the nucleus, was readily detected and segmented, and capable of labeling daughter cells post-mitosis ( ). Additionally, SYTO21 signal was retained in cells undergoing apoptosis and resulted in SYTO21+AV+ events. MEFs incubated with SYTO21 demonstrated an increase in SYTO21+ events over time, indicative of proliferation. By contrast, MEFs undergoing apoptosis via treatment of TNFα + CHX exhibit no change in the number of SYTO21-positive events and robustly labeled with AV-594 ( ). Therefore, SYTO21 is suitable as a fluorescent probe to track cell proliferation and population growth.\n\nLive-cell imagers detect the number of fluorescent events and are therefore influenced by the number of cells. Data interpretation may be obfuscated when cell numbers vary between samples due to treatment-induced or cell-inherent differences in proliferation rates. Imperfect strategies to circumvent this issue undermine the advantages of kinetic monitoring (e.g., tandem analysis via flow cytometry, normalizing to endpoint data collected using DNA-intercalating dyes or inducers of cell death, using confluency as a surrogate for cell number) (Lopez et al., 2016; Giampazolias et al., 2017). To verify that SYTO21 could normalize data in real time, MEFs were seeded at several densities, incubated with SYTO21 and AV-594, and treated with either vehicle or TNFα + CHX. SYTO21 data accurately measured differences in cell number and cell proliferation in untreated MEFs. Concomitant AV+ data exemplified how cell number can complicate data interpretation ( ). For each time point, the AV+ events were normalized by the corresponding SYTO21+ events and expressed as percent death ( ). For comparison, AV+ endpoint data are shown pre- and post-normalization ( ). Furthermore, the kinetic curves exhibited similar slopes once normalized ( , bottom panel). These data demonstrate that this method can normalize cell death data to account for differences in cell number.\n\nCell death data normalization is particularly relevant when perturbagens do not illicit a rapid death phenotype, which will result in more proliferation variability between experimental conditions and therefore different maximal labeling. To demonstrate this, we applied the normalization methodology to WT and DKO MEFs treated with a panel of perturbagens. AV data collected through SPARKL was normalized by the SYTO21 data and provided values that can be directly compared between the two cell lines ( ). Perturbagens engaging BAX- and BAK-mediated apoptosis demonstrated an attenuated lethal response in DKO MEFs (such as VP16 and calcium ionophore, A23187) and perturbagens capable of engaging the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis were synergized by co-treatment with ABT. When we replicated this experiment using Y3 as the cell death probe and normalized for SYTO21 labeled cells, we observed a significant loss of signal during longer experiments ( ). When analyzed well beyond induction of cell death, MEFs treated with TNFα + CHX exhibited sustained SYTO21 and AV signal but lost Y3 signal overtime ( ). The average fluorescent intensity of Y3+ events decreased and eventually became sub-threshold, which we believe to be indicative of changes to DNA content in apoptosis ( ). Signal loss did not appear to be due to cell detachment as this would affect detection of all probes, and the data do not demonstrate this concomitant loss of signal in either SYTO21 or AV over time.\n\nFinally, we culminated our validation of SPARKL methodology by applying mathematical analyses to our normalized data. Percentages of cell death calculated by normalizing AV data to SYTO21 were fit using the LOPE function described in the previous section ( ). Samples co-treated with ABT reveal a reduction in t′, indicative of BCL-2 family contributions within the cell death pathway; by contrast, t′ is unchanged in response to ABT in MEFs undergoing ferroptosis via erastin ( ). Consistent with our previous methods of analysis, receptor-mediated apoptosis by either TNFα or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) demonstrated substantially different kinetics when co-treated with ABT and indicates a predominance for type II signaling in MEFs. When analyzing RD, which became more informative in normalized data, we observed increased rates of death following co-treatment of ABT in apoptotic MEFs ( ); RD was unchanged in MEFs treated with erastin or A23187. Cell death data from A23187-treated MEFs collectively indicates a mechanism requiring BAX or BAK but only partially sensitized by inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, which is a profile not shared among the other perturbagens exampled within this work ( ). Control-treated MEFs demonstrated ambiguous fit curves, and therefore parameter extraction was highly variable and not informative ( – , red panel). Similarly, DKO MEFs not exhibiting death in response to particular perturbagens (such as VP16 and A23187) produced ambiguous fit curves and were not analyzed further (data not shown). These data exemplify the utility of mathematical parameterization on kinetic data that were normalized for differential cell numbers due to cell-inherent or treatment-induced changes to proliferation."
