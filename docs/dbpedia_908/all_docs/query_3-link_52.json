        "text": "Electric vehicles are typically known as cars that work with various parts that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most important accent in these cars, which move with the electrical operation of almost every part in it, is seen as the engine. But another important part with the engine is the suspension. Before getting to know the electric suspensions, which have a similar structure to the suspensions in internal combustion engines, it is useful to get to know the normal version. So what is suspension? Suspension is the system that connects the tire, spring, shock absorber and connection systems in a vehicle to the automobile. This system helps the vehicle to hold onto the road and to increase the driving quality.\n\nWhat is Suspension?\n\nIn its shortest definition, suspension is known as the system that supports road holding, provides a more comfortable ride and connects the vehicle to the wheels. It is known for eliminating road holding problems that may negatively affect driving, or for preventing problems such as suspension, vibration and swaying in harsh conditions, which ensures that it can be felt with the least effect. Due to its duty, the suspension consists of various parts in order to prevent these negative problems. Suspension, which is one of the most critical parts of the car, is formed by bringing together some parts for the person who uses the vehicle to have a comfortable ride. These parts are;\n\nSprings (helical springs, leaf springs, torsion bar springs)\n\nShock Absorber\n\nArms\n\nStable bars\n\nSwing arms\n\nRotillers\n\nPneumatic\n\nFree/fixed suspension system\n\nWhat are the Suspension Types?\n\nSuspension is divided into types in itself. These suspensions, which are produced in different types for various types of vehicles on the market, are basically divided into two. Typical suspension variants are fixed and independent suspension. In fixed suspensions, the right and left wheels are connected to each other by an axle. However, in independent suspensions, all wheels in the vehicle move independently of each other.\n\nFixed suspension: The most defining aspect of this type of suspension is that the right and left wheels are connected to each other. Fixed suspension, which is used with leaf springs, coil springs and torsion bar springs, is frequently used in vehicles carrying heavy loads. This type of suspension, which is used in vehicles that require more control, has a simple but very solid structure.\n\nFree suspension: In the free suspension system, all wheels are independent of each other. This suspension system, which has a complex structure, allows the wheels to be connected to the body with the help of a spring and to be controlled by an independent arm. This suspension system, which is very advantageous compared to the fixed type, especially in terms of steering capability; It offers great support in terms of comfort, handling and driving ability. The free suspension system, which can be seen in many places from light cars to luxury vehicles, yachts, is known to be slightly less durable than the fixed type. In addition to these, this type of suspension is a bit more complex. According to this; The free suspension, which uses double wishbone suspension, Mc-Pherson type suspension and transverse leaf spring free suspension system types, consists of soft springs for a more flexible structure.\n\nFixed and free suspensions, which are the abandonment of internal combustion engine vehicles in the market, show themselves in many vehicles. In addition to these vehicles, which are separated from each other due to their structures, in addition to these suspensions, which can also be used in electric vehicles, which is one of the most wonderful innovations offered by the developing technology to the world, active, that is, electric suspensions have emerged. The features of this suspension, which is quite different in terms of use, are as follows:\n\nActive/electric suspension: This suspension is known for keeping the driving comfort at the highest level and giving a lot of comfort to the person driving the vehicle. Active suspension, which affects many aspects from braking action to steering, from controlling the speed of the vehicle to other driving systems, also helps to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy. Unlike other suspension systems, the biggest feature of this suspension, which promises the highest performance in terms of safety and comfort, prevents the outer wheel from leaning towards the inner wheel during turns. This suspension, which provides a more comfortable acceleration in terms of comfort, raises itself to reduce vibration in adverse road conditions and increases the comfort effect. The biggest difference of Electric vehicles suspension compared to other types is the advantages it brings in the braking system. Accordingly, thanks to special shock absorbers, solenoid valves, control unit and hydraulic pumps, active suspension allows braking in a much shorter time than other types.\n\nIs There Suspension in Electric Vehicles?\n\nElectric vehicles have suspension just like internal combustion engines. Suspension, which is the most basic part to increase road holding in these vehicles, which is typically the same in use, is also used in electric cars. Almost all of the suspensions that can be encountered in more than one type can be used in electric vehicles."
