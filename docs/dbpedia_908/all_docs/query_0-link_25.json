        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Geology of Australia The Geology of Australia provides a vivid and informative account of the evolution of the Australian continent over the last 4400 million years. This illuminating history begins with the Precambrian rocks that hold clues to the origins of life and the development of an oxygenated atmosphere, then covers the warm seas, volcanism and the multiple cycles of Palaeozoic mountain building, which built the eastern third of the Australian continent. It details the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, the development of climates and landscapes in modern Australia, and the creation of the continental shelves and coastlines. Separate chapters cover the volcanic origins of the basalts in Eastern Australia, formation and development of the Great Barrier Reef and the geology of the Solar System. This second edition features two new chapters, covering the evolution of life on Earth, and a geological perspective on climate change. A geology primer explains the key terms and principles of earth sciences in easily understood language. From Uluru to the Great Divide, from sapphires to the stars, The Geology of Australia is a comprehensive exploration of the timeless forces that shaped this continent and that continue to do so.

It is time for a new summary of Australian geology, since so many new understandings have been generated in the last 50 years.This book is written basically in the order in which Australia formed, starting with the oldest rocks and working towards the most recent events. In this way we build Australia block by block, episode by episode, and also trace the development of the Earth’s climate and life. The diagram at left shows the major events in Australian geological history. Geological time is written as ‘millions of years’ for general statements and as ‘Ma’ (mega-anna) when measured accurate dates are given for particular events. This book uses a minimum of scientific jargon, though it is impossible to bypass all technical words. Indeed, in coming to terms with the scientific basis for many of the decisions we make about managing the Australian environment and commercial development we all need a smattering of technical knowledge. I have kept it to a minimum. Each technical term is explained in a geology primer (Chapter 2). Instead of a glossary, which merely defines the word using other technical terms, Chapter 2 briefly sets each in context.Websites for further reading are included at the end of chapters as appropriate.With respect to the sources of the data and theories summarised in this book, I have included the principal sources and references at the end of the book, grouped in chapter lists. A list of general books on the geology, soils and fossils of Australia is given at the start of the Sources and References section at the end of the book. I have taken the opportunity to expand this second edition; to update information such as new age determinations, to explain more carefully aspects which have been raised with me by colleagues, to answer questions commonly asked of me in public, and to cover in more detail the wonderful fossil record of life on Earth that is preserved in Australian rocks.The scales and causes of climate change, as far as we know them, are summarised more fully in a separate chapter. Finally, this book is about the development of the Australian continent and the evolution of its major components and of the landscape in particular. Many of the localities mentioned are listed in the index, so those travelling can understand and appreciate the underlying geology. The map (p. xi) shows many of the main localities referred to in this book. However, it has not been possible to include details of the origin of our many world-class ores, coal and petroleum deposits, and of the economic geology which underpins so much of our quality of life – that will have to wait for another day.

My thanks also to my wife and children who tolerated my absences from our family life on field trips. I have been fortunate to study and work with a wide range of geologists and other scientists during my time in industry and at the three universities with which I was associated as a student and staff member. It is impossible to single out every contribution made by these people – whether they were my lecturers, my colleagues or my own students – but certainly all have contributed to my own knowledge and continued interest in Australian earth sciences. Because this is a general book I trust those scientists not cited individually will accept my apologies for I could not clog the text with every source as is normal in a scientific paper. Many people have provided advice on source material and data, access to illustrations, or critical comments on sections of text, and the book has been much improved by their advice. I apologise if anyone has been omitted from this list: Ross Andrew, Mark Barley, Al Bashford, Peter Betts, Alex Bevan,Ted Bryant, Gavin Birch, Ray Cas, Allan Chivas, Jonathan Claoue-Long, Lindsay Collins, Jim Colwell, Alex Cooke, Keith Crook, Patrick de Deckker, David Etheridge, Mohinudeen Faiz, Michael Gagan, Jim Gehling, David Gillieson, Andrew Glikson,Vic Gostin, Iain Groves, Bob Henderson, Chris Herbert, Robert Hill, Richard Jenkins, Sharon King, Barry Kohn, Bill Laing, Mark Leonard, John Long, Bernd Lottermoser, David Lowry, Ian MacDougall, Greg McNally, Ken McNamara, Nick Oliver, Ken Page, Barrie Pittock, Greg Retallack, Alex Ritchie, Mick Roche, John Rogers, Steve Ross, Peter Roy, Mike Rubenach, Peter Schouten, Jeffrey Stillwell, Caroline Strong, Lin Sutherland, Fons VandenBerg, Peter Whitehead, Simon Wilde, Stephen Wroe, Ann Young, Bob Young, and Gavin Young.

How has deep sea and space exploration changed our perspective on the Ear th a n d A u s t r ali a ?\n\nA u s t r a l i a : a ge , s ta bil i t y, c l im at e , m a in f e at u r e s Some call Australia the world’s largest island, others the smallest continent. I want to describe Australia as a continent, one of the primary building blocks of planet Earth, and one which spans almost the entire record of Earth history. Traditional stories of the Aboriginal people tell of the creation of this continent, and of many of its landscape features.These stories are a parallel to this book because they emphasise the close spiritual relationship between all of us and the land that supports us. This book tells how the rocks formed, and how the present climate developed over millions of years. As the Reverend J. Milne Curran wrote in one of the earliest explanations of Australian geology, in 1898:\n\n1\n\nAustralia has a history far more ancient than any written by men – to read this history is one of the objects of geology – records preserved in the great stone-book of nature. There is evidence that the Chinese knew of a land in the south from perhaps as early as the Sui dynasty (589–618 AD) and that Chinese ships had mapped part of Australia in 1422, even landing to search for metalliferous ores. The first documented European discovery of this continent was by the Dutch commander Willem Jansz, who sighted the ‘Great South Land’ in 1606. He had sailed the Duyfken around the southern coast of New Guinea early in 1606, and veered southward to 13 degrees 45 minutes (13º 45′) latitude. Here a party landed, on the eastern side of the Gulf of Carpentaria, before heading back to Java. He named the point Cabo Keerweer (Cape Keerweer), which means: ‘Cape Turnabout’ in Dutch. It lies at the mouth of the Kirke River, about 70 km south of Aurukun. Thus a small, remote sandspit on a flat coastline was the first part of this continent to be given a European name. Later that year the Spanish captain Luis Vaez de Torres sailed from the New Hebrides (Vanuatu) through the gap south of New Guinea, now called Torres Strait, on his way to the Philippines. Torres did not realise what lay to the south of his vessel. Some 40 years later, Abel Tasman mapped most of Australia’s southern, western and northern coastlines, as well as discovering New Zealand and Tasmania, in his voyages of 1642–1643 and 1644. Finally, 125 years later when James Cook charted the eastern coast in 1770, the extent of Australia became known to Europeans. Later the French 2 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nexplored much of the western coast in greater detail. The early Dutch explorers named this continent ‘New Holland’, but they decided there was not much of value in spices or precious metals to warrant further exploration. When Cook left on his journey, authorised by the British Admiralty to search further for a southern land, he referred to it as New Holland. It was Matthew Flinders, the man who first circumnavigated and mapped the coastline, who gave real impetus to the present name of Australia, based on the Latin term for ‘southern land’, terra australis. He published an account of his discoveries in the great work A Voyage to Terra Australis, a printed copy of which was placed in his unconscious hands on 18 July 1814, the day before he died. Geological investigation of Australia really began in the mid 1800s. So we have about 150 years of information to draw upon. Perhaps the earliest geological map of Australia was the one published about 1850, prepared by J. Beete Jukes, who had been the naturalist on the survey vessel HMS Fly. This map of the whole continent shows old rocks around the edge, and the centre completely blank. For many people in those days Australia was so different to Europe that extraordinary theor ies were proposed to explain the differences. The Reverend W. B. Clarke, in an address to the Philosophical Society of New South Wales on 20 November 1861, took time to refute the following notions: It was once maintained by a philosopher of some eminence that New Holland, being so singular and anomalous a region, must have\n\nFigure 1.1 Early map of the geology of Australia by J. Beete Jukes, drawn in 1846 and published about 1850, showing the geology mapped along the coast but a dearth of information on the inland. Note the track of data in northeastern Australia based on reports\n\nby Ludwig Leichhardt of his journey in 1844–1845. Tasmania is labelled as Van Diemen’s Land. There is detail on the Great Barrier Reef, since this was also investigated by Jukes during his time in Australia. Source: David Johnson\n\nAn Australian perspective 3\n\noriginated in a corner of the sun knocked off by a comet, and that, tumbling into the Pacific Ocean, it soon became the suitable abode of those bizarre marsupials … which are only an imperfect development of life upon the more recently raised lands, such as Galapagos and Australia. All these early explorers, and the naturalists who sailed with them, had noted the strange animals and plants. Australia did not fall out of the Sun, but it is still a very individual place with unusual animals and plants inhabiting an extraordinarily diverse landscape.\n\nAge To early theorists, Australia was not only very young but also populated by totally different life to that known from the natural worlds of Europe, America and Africa. They thought they had discovered a completely new existence, something which must have formed after their established order. However this theoretical stance was not supported by the rocks. In the 1800s many geologists spent time confirming that there were fossils and rocks in Australia that were demonstrably of the same age as those in Europe. Prominent early geologists in New South Wales were the Reverend W. B. Clarke, the Reverend J. Tenison-Woods, the Reverend J. Milne Curran and C. S. Wilkinson, in Queensland Robert Logan Jack, in Victoria Alfred Selwyn, and in Western Australia Dr W. G.Woolnough. We know now that Australia is very old. Continental crust in Western Australia has\n\n4 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nbeen dated at older than 3500 million years, and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks in the Yilgarn region contain zircons that are even older, dated at 4404 million years.This implies that a crust of rocks was formed before 4400 million years ago and then eroded, with the zircons subsequently deposited in sediments. It is the oldest material known on Earth, and is only about 200 million years younger than our present estimates for the age of the planet. The youngest materials are still forming in the river systems, beaches and reefs around our coastline. It is also clear that much of the fossil life has links to the other continents. In particular, the similarity of rocks around 250–300 million years old in such distant places as India, Africa and South America suggested these continents were once joined with Australia, and this observation led to the theory of continental drift. Scientists in the late 1800s and early 1900s proposed that a huge continent, which they called Gondwana, broke up, and that the fragments then drifted apart. But at that time there was no known mechanism to effect such massive changes, and the theory was not strongly supported. In the 1960s new evidence showed how the break-up might have happened, and the theory of plate tectonics was developed. We now know Gondwana was not the only supercontinent: there was an earlier one, which we call Rodinia.The rocks in Australia have an extraordinary story to tell, starting before the formation of any other rocks still preserved on the planet.\n\nB ox 1.1 Ra diome tric dating of ro cks In the 1800s geologists could only interpret the relative ages of rocks. Guesses of the actual ages were made, but there was no way to do absolute dating. It was the discovery of radioactive decay in 1896 by the French physicist Henri Becquerel, and later work by the Curies, which provided the means. The key fact is that radioactive elements decay to daughter products in a special way. The daughter products can also be radioactive and lead to another decay cycle, though most commonly they are stable and not radioactive. For each radioactive pair (parent and daughter) there is a period of time – the half-life – after which exactly half the original number of radioactive parent atoms remain, half having been transformed into daughter atoms. For instance, radioactive uranium atoms decay to stable lead atoms. In 1907 Boltwood had found that the ratio of the decay product (lead) to the parent radioactive uranium increased with geological age. This discovery confirmed the potential of radiometric dating to provide accurate measurements of the absolute age of rocks. The radioactive decay process is random, and it is not possible to predict when an individual atom will disintegrate. However, given a large number of atoms, it is possible to predict when half will have decayed. It is like watching a heated pan of popcorn. You cannot tell which kernel will pop next, but you can predict how long it will take to finish the batch. For the decay of uranium-235 (U-235) to lead-207 (Pb-207) the half-life is 704 million years. That is, over 704 million years, or one half-life: 1000 atoms of U-235 → 500 atoms of U-235 + 500 atoms of Pb-207\n\nPb 207\n\n4470 Ma\n\n704 Ma\n\nORIGIN OF EARTH'S CRUST\n\nPb 206\n\nHe 4\n\nNumber of Atoms Left\n\nHe 4\n\nU 235\n\n35\n\nDaughter Atoms\n\nU 238\n\n2 ium\n\nParent Atom\n\n0.7% of present Uranium\n\nUran\n\n99.3% of present Uranium\n\nSTART OF CAMBRIAN\n\nb\n\na\n\n1/2\n\nUra\n\nniu\n\nm2\n\n38\n\n1/4 Half-life\n\n1/8 1/16 1/32 6000\n\n5000 Half-life intervals\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\nMillions of Years Ago\n\n2000\n\n1000 542\n\n0\n\nFigure 1.2 Radioactive decay of uranium-238 and uranium-235. a.

Decay curves over 6000 million years, showing the more rapid decay of U-235, which has a shorter half-life (704 million years) than that of U-238 (4470 million years).

The diagram also emphasises the enormous time span of the Precambrian era, which spans most of the history of the planet. Source: Arthur Holmes\n\nAn Australian perspective 5\n\nAfter a further half-life, or a total of 1408 million years, the remaining 500 atoms of U-235 → 250 U-235 + 250 Pb-207 which, with the 500 Pb-207 already formed, will mean there would be 250 U-235 plus 750 Pb-207. Note that this implies that the Earth was far more radioactive earlier than it is now. We can determine very accurately both the amounts and the decay rates of radioactive elements, so we can then calculate the age of the specimen. Samples for dating are selected very carefully to avoid rocks that are altered, contaminated, or disturbed by later heating or chemical changes. Multiple samples are taken to provide cross-checking. Different radioactive isotopes are used for different age ranges, depending on the half-life of the decay process. The following pairs have the stated half-lives: rubidium-87 to strontium-87\n\n48800 million years\n\nuranium-238 to lead-206\n\n4470 million years\n\npotassium-40 to argon-40\n\n1250 million years\n\nuranium-235 to lead-207\n\n704 million years\n\nA common method for measuring the amounts of each isotope is thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). The isotopes are extracted from the rocks and vaporised over a hot filament, and the gas is then analysed in a mass spectrometer. Laser ablation of grains under a microscope evaporates a minute sample, and the gas can be analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry (ICP). Another technique involves using a high-power electron microscope – the superprobe – to analyse minute amounts of radioactive materials in mineral grains such as monazite. These elements are useful for dating rocks up to hundreds of millions of years old. But what about younger materials? In 1951 Walter Libby discovered that minute amounts of a radioactive isotope of carbon – carbon-14 (C-14) – exist in air, natural waters, plants and organisms. Radioactive C-14 is produced continually by cosmic ray bombardment of nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. The C-14 decays to nitrogen-14, with a half-life of 5568 years. Radiocarbon dates are normally reported as ‘before present’ (BP), with reference to the year 1950. So if carbon from prehistoric wood is found to have only half the amount of C-14 present when compared to 1950 wood, the estimated age for the prehistoric wood is 5568 years. The age would normally be expressed as 5570 ± 150 years. The natural production of C-14 has not been constant over time. Ages must therefore be calibrated, for instance by reference to C-14 dating of trees whose true ages have been measured by counting the tree rings. SHRI M P\n\nAustralian geologists have made a speciality of dating ancient rocks, and some of the technology was developed at the Australian National University (ANU). The sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) uses oxygen ions, positively charged particles, for very detailed uranium–lead age dating of individual grains, typically zircon, within a rock. The very fine microbeam can also probe and date individual growth zones within a single grain.\n\n6 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nPrevious radiometric dating was limited to analyses\n\nFigure 1.3 Electron microscope image, taken in back-scatter mode, of microcraters formed in a cut and polished zircon grain during SHRIMP analysis. The grain is 150 μm (micrometres) wide and the microcraters are the eight, slightly darker, rounded blotches in the grain. This is the oldest grain dated on Earth – 4404 million years old.\n\nof whole rocks or of groups of grains extracted from the rock, and almost always for igneous rocks. The SHRIMP capability enables absolute dating of individual grains. The SHRIMP date records the age of the magmatism (or rarely, metamorphism in high-grade rocks) which formed the zircons, and hence the age of the original rock. If the rocks are uplifted and\n\nSource: John Valley and Simon Wilde\n\neroded the zircons retain their age signature, even when recycled from igneous or metamorphic rocks into sedimentary rocks, and weathered again into loose sand. Thus even the age of grains in modern beach sands can be determined.\n\nS t ab i l i t y Australia is tectonically stable and has no active mountain building or major fault systems. We have no mountains as young as those in New Zealand or the Himalaya, nor faults like the San Andreas Fault in California. We have no active chains of volcanoes like those in New Zealand, Japan or Indonesia. Active tectonism, involving earthquakes and volcanism, occurs mainly at the boundaries of the large plates that make up the outer part of the Earth. Australia is situated well within a very large plate. Over the last 50 million years there has been minor downward tilting (c. 300 m) of Australia to the north due to subduction under Indonesia and New Guinea, and also minor buckling on the order of 100 m, due to fault movements and lateral stress from the plate boundaries. Most earthquakes occur in the outer crust of the Earth, where rocks are cold enough to be brittle. At greater depths, where the\n\ntemperature is high enough for the rocks to deform by plastic flow, there is rarely sudden fracturing to trigger an earthquake. In eastern Australia earthquakes occur at depths of up to about 20 km. In very active seismic zones, like Indonesia or Fiji, earthquakes occur from close to the surface to depths of 700 km. Shallow earthquakes can cause much damage, but deep earthquakes rarely do. Australia is just one landmass sticking above the waves, riding on a much larger plate on the surface of the Earth.This plate is the IndoAustralian plate, which contains parts of New Zealand and Fiji in the east, and India in the northwest.We are all travelling northeastwards towards Asia at about 70 mm/yr. To put this in perspective, consider that in 220 years of European settlement the Australian landmass has moved about 15 m closer to Asia. It is hard to notice this when there is no permanent marker by which to An Australian perspective 7\n\nFigure 1.4 The Earth’s surface consists of interlocking plates, shown as blue lines on this diagram. Most plates comprise both continents and ocean floors. Australia sits on the Indo-Australian plate, and to the east is the Pacific plate. The original concept of continental drift emphasised continents because that was where the rocks were mapped and the connections drawn. However, we now use the term ‘plate tectonics’ because it is the plates that are moving, and the continents are being carried upon them. The Indo-Australian plate carries two continental masses (Australia and India) and three smaller masses (Papua New Guinea and the north island and the western side of the south island of New Zealand). To the south of Australia the ocean floor is\n\n8 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nspreading as the Indo-Australian plate moves away from Antarctica. To the north, the plate is converging with Asia. The red spots indicate survey locations that are being tracked by GPS. The arrows indicate the direction of movement averaged over 5 years, and the length of the arrow indicates the speed of movement. Note that the 8 survey stations in Australia are all moving at the same speed in the same direction, on average 67 mm/yr in the direction 35º east of north. Antarctica is hardly moving. Africa, Europe and Asia are together moving eastwards in a broad curve, and the Americas are moving in a broad curve westwards. The plates are converging towards the north Pacific region.

However, imagine if this movement was occurring in the street outside your front door, so that one side of the street was stable and the other was moving sideways at 70 mm/yr. A house built directly across the street by members of the First Fleet would now be down the road, and the block next to it would be opposite you. In 50 000 years – a minimal estimate for the time Aboriginal people have been here – the same block of land would have moved 3.5 km. Despite the stability of the plate there are small earthquakes within Australia (intra-plate tectonism). The reasons for these earthquakes are not obvious in comparison to those along major plate boundaries. Some earthquakes are caused by new movements on old faults, and some may be caused by heating effects in the deep sedimentary basins. Analyses within drillholes and mines do show that most of the continent is being gently compressed towards a northeast–southwest axis, which lies parallel to the plate movement. Some compression is to be expected because the plate is starting to be forced against the edge of the Eurasian and Pacific plates to the north. The southeastern corner shows more east–west compression, perhaps reflecting the nearby boundary at New Zealand, which is transmitting some pressure inwards towards Australia. More details on plate tectonics are given in Chapter 2. Low-intensity earthquakes occur in Australia almost daily. Early European settlers noted slight earthquake shocks; the first was felt by Governor Phillip on 22 June 1788. However, most tremors are never felt by people even though they are detected by sensitive\n\ninstruments. Fortunately Australia is sparsely populated so that most significant earthquakes cause little damage. The most common method of describing the size of an earthquake is the Richter magnitude scale. The ground displacement is measured with a seismograph, and a correction for the distance from the earthquake epicentre to the seismograph is applied. Each unit increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in ground displacement and about a thirtyfold increase in the seismic energy released. Another measure of earthquake size is the moment magnitude, which is derived from mathematical modelling of the surface wave generated by the earthquake. Moment magnitudes are better measures of the energy released, especially for earthquakes above Richter magnitude 7. The 1960 Chile earthquake, which measured 8.5 on the Richter scale, had a moment magnitude of 9.5. A significant earthquake is followed by smaller events, called aftershocks, and is sometimes preceded by foreshocks. Worldwide, for every magnitude 5 earthquake, 10 magnitude 4 earthquakes are expected, 100 magnitude 3, 1000 magnitude 2, and so on. A magnitude 1.0 earthquake (commonly written as M1) releases a similar amount of seismic energy as a typical quarry blast. An M5 earthquake releases about the same seismic energy as the explosion of 10 000 tonnes of TNT – about the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. M9 earthquakes, such as those in Chile in 1960 or Alaska in 1964, are extremely damaging. Australia has had large earthquakes, but they occur very infrequently; on average an An Australian perspective 9\n\nearthquake exceeding M7 occurs somewhere in Australia every 100 years or so. Such an earthquake would affect only a small area. Any particular place in Australia would only expect to be within 50 km of an M7 earthquake about once every 100 000 years. Seismically active areas such as Japan, New Guinea, the Philippines and California experience M7 earthquakes every few years.\n\nSig ni fican t ear t hquake s in A us t r alia There have been several major earthquakes recorded in Australia over the past 160 years. The largest was magnitude 7.1 at Meeberrie, west of Meekatharra in Western Australia, on 29 April 1941. Damage was limited because of the isolated location, but included cracked walls in farm houses and burst water tanks. The largest earthquake measured in South Australia was the Beachport earthquake on 10 May 1897. At M6.5 it caused serious damage at Kingston, Robe and Beachport, and caused minor damage even in Adelaide. It was felt as far away as Port Augusta and Melbourne. It is thought that the epicentre was offshore. In New South Wales the Newcastle earthquake on 28 December 1989 resulted in 13 deaths, over 120 injuries, and building damage exceeding A$1.5 billion (1990 values). Although only magnitude 5.6 its location in a major city meant there was serious damage to life and property. The Tennant Creek series in the Northern Territory involved three tremors between magnitudes 6.3 and 6.7 on 22 January 1988. They were felt in Darwin, and the largest was felt as far away as Cairns in northern Queensland and in high-rise buildings in 10 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nPerth and Adelaide. In Tennant Creek, walls were cracked in well-constructed buildings, objects fell from shelves, and furniture was shifted. There were no serious injuries, but the strong shaking from the main events and the prolonged aftershocks badly frightened many residents. The epicentres were in the desert about 40 km southwest of the town, so total damage was limited to about A$1.2 million (1990 values) – mainly damage to a highpressure gas pipeline between Alice Springs and Darwin. Some earthquakes produce small fault scarps where they displace the ground surface. The Tennant Creek earthquakes produced a surface rupture about 35 km long trending east–west, with the southern block thrust over the northern block by up to 1 m vertically and about 2 m horizontally. The Meckering earthquake in Western Australia on 14 October 1968 also produced a surface fault rupture, 32 km long and trending north–south. The land east of the fault was lifted vertically by up to 1.5 m, and moved westward by up to 2 m. Thus the eastern block was thrust over the western block, indicating strong compression of the crust. Western Australia has experienced several earthquakes: Meckering (1968), Cadoux (1979) and the Burakin series, which started in July 2000 but had its most significant events on 28 September 2000 (M5.0), 5 March 2001 (M5.1), 23 March 2002 (M5.1) and 30 March 2002 (M5.2). The Meckering quake (M6.7) destroyed a bank, hotel, shire hall, three churches and 60 of about 75 houses, with total damage about A$29 million (1990 values). There were no fatalities and only\n\nFigure 1.5 Earthquake occurrences around and onshore in Australia, 1841–2000. Note the dense concentration of high magnitude earthquakes in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea associated with the convergent plate margin. Source: Geoscience Australia\n\nminor injuries, largely because the earthquake occurred in mid-morning. A more recent earthquake on 16 February 2007 in Shark Bay rattled houses but left no major damage despite a Richter magnitude 5.2. Despite the traumas at Newcastle, earthquake intensity on the Australian landmass is quite low. We do not experience\n\nthe frequent strong quakes associated with seismically active regions such as Indonesia, Japan, New Guinea and New Zealand. On a global scale this is a stable continent. But as the national population grows and more buildings and infrastructure are developed in Australia, even low-intensity quakes may cause damage and even loss of life.

The temperature gradient is primarily a diagonal trend across Australia, with the hottest regions in the north and especially northwestern Australia, and the coolest in the south and especially in the southeast. Rainfall zones are more or less concentric, with most of Australia receiving less than 400 mm annually. The country has a wide climatic range, from wet tropical in northeastern and northwestern Australia, to arid deserts in the Centre, to humid temperate regions across most of the coastal southern continent, with seasonal freezing and snow on the southeastern highlands and in Tasmania.\n\n1600\n\n27 21 15\n\nThe extremes bear this out. The highest recorded temperature is 53 ºC at Cloncurry in Queensland in 1889. Marble Bar in northern Western Australia recorded the longest hot spell – 160 days over 37.5 ºC in a year. The lowest recorded temperature is –23 ºC at Charlotte Pass in New South Wales in 1994. In terms of rainfall, the driest area is Lake Eyre with an average annual rainfall of 125 mm, and the wettest is Mt Bellenden Ker in northern Queensland, with a median annual rainfall of 4048 mm, and a highest recorded annual rainfall of 11 251 mm (over 11 metres) in 1979. Yet the climate has not always been so. Much of Australia’s geology, and its present landscape and soils, formed in vastly different climates. There were times when almost the whole of Australia was glacial.\n\nMEAN TEMPERATURE ( ˚C )\n\n1200 800 600 400 200\n\n12 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nMEDIAN ANNUAL RAINFALL ( mm )\n\nFigure 1.7 Oblique three-dimensional image of Australia and surrounding ocean regions, showing landmasses in brown and orange, shallow seas in yellow (< 2000 m water depth), and deeper sea floors in blue (2000–4000 m) and green (> 4000 m). The Australian continent is relatively flat. The Great Divide marks a spine of higher country along eastern Australia. Remnants of old mountain ranges, now much reduced in size by erosion, are evident in the Mt Lofty Ranges of South Australia, the MacDonnell, Musgrave and Petermann Ranges in Central Australia, the Hamersley Range in the Pilbara region and the King Leopold Ranges in the Kimberley of Western Australia. The depression occupied by Lake Eyre and the flat Nullarbor Plain are obvious. Geologically the continent extends to the edge of the continental shelf, with a very steep drop to the surrounding deep-sea floor. Note the extensive continental shelves that connect the Australian mainland to Papua New Guinea in the north and to Tasmania in the south. The continental shelves rise steeply from the deep ocean floors and are incised\n\nalong their edges by numerous canyons. During the lower sea-levels of the ice ages these continental shelves were largely dry, and there was easy access to and from Papua New Guinea. Adjoining plateaus – pieces of the Australian continental mass which were rifted apart but did not drift far during the break-up of Gondwana (see Chapter 10) – are also obvious: the Queensland and Marion Plateaus off Queensland, the Exmouth Plateau off the North West Shelf, the Naturaliste Plateau off the southwestern corner, and the South Tasman Rise, which is tenuously linked south of Tasmania. East of Australia lie two north-south seamount chains: the Tasman chain, and further east the Lord Howe chain. These mark successive volcanoes developed over a mantle plume hotspot as the IndoAustralian plate drifted northwards (see Chapter 9).

However it is also important in understanding the geology. Climate determines the types of sedimentary rocks that form, especially the accumulation of peat, which later changes to coal. Climate is a principal factor in the weathering and erosion of rocks, and hence the change from rocks into soils, and the chemistry of groundwaters. It also affects the development of landscapes and the liberation of sedimentary materials into the river systems. In many places climate controls the development of valuable ores concentrated in the soil zones; one example is bauxite, which is the main source of aluminium.\n\nFlatness From a long-distance perspective Australia is one of the lowest and flattest land areas on Earth.The average height is 330 m.The highest point, Mt Kosciusko, is only 2228 m above sea level, and Lake Eyre is the lowest point, 16 m below sea level.The total range of topographic\n\nFigure 1.8 Major drainage divisions, showing coastal drainage, the Murray–Darling system, the internal Lakes Eyre– Bulloo-Frome-Torrens and desert drainage, upland areas of irregular local drainage, and the salt-lake palaeodrainage system of Western Australia – South Australia – Northern Territory.

Offshore, around the edge of the continental shelf, there are steep undersea cliffs where the continental mass drops into 3000–5000 m of water in the ocean basins. The Great Divide forms a prominent spine along much of eastern Australia, and there are ranges in central Australia and elsewhere (Figure 1.7), but the continent is dominated by a series of broad plains. The flat terrain means drainage patterns are also poorly defined for much of the continent. There are four drainage groups (Figure 1.8). The first is a series of relatively short river systems that drain towards the coast and form a ring around all but the southern margins of the continent. The second is the major active river system of the Murray–Darling, which drains most of inland New South Wales and part of southern Queensland towards Adelaide. The third is a group of well-defined internal drainage systems, especially the Lake Eyre system but also including the Amadeus, Bulloo, Frome and Torrens systems, which end in large salt lakes.The fourth is an immense area within western and central parts of the continent where the ground is so flat that water flows as sheets down local slopes, ending in a poorly connected series of salt lakes that mark the paths of very old drainage systems. The Murray–Darling, the Lake Eyre system, and these salt lake chains represent drainage patterns at three stages of landscape development. The Murray–Darling system is still young and very active; its headwaters are sculpting the ranges, and the water not used for crops or stock eventually reaches the sea through Lake Alexandrina in South Australia.\n\nThe Lake Eyre and associated systems are less active except after major inland rains, and flow more slowly, ending up in the large lakes. The western systems represent the remnants of major river systems that were active millions of years ago, when the hills were higher and the valleys well defined. The landscape now\n\nis too dry and flat to channel flows, and the watercourses are rarely well defined. However, as we will discover, these are just the senile remnants of systems that were very vigorous rivers millions of years ago. Unless there is an uplift of new mountain ranges, eventually all of the continent will be reduced to this state.\n\nB ox 1.2 W hat is ge ology?\n\nFigure 1.9 Students on a geology field trip examining Devonian limestones with fossil corals on the Burdekin River near Charters Towers, north Queensland. Source: David Johnson\n\nGeology is the science that deals with the materials that constitute our Earth, and with the dynamic changes that have affected the Earth from its origin about 4600 million years ago to the present time. Geology also encompasses the study of the surfaces and interiors of other bodies in the Solar System, to place Earth in its planetary context. Geologists and other earth scientists interpret the geological history of a region from the features preserved in the rocks exposed at the Earth’s surface. They also use subsurface information obtained from drillholes, quarries, cuttings, caves, mines and geophysical surveys. Geology provides a time perspective for other natural sciences that are more concerned with the present. It also investigates former ecosystems and traces the development of past fauna and flora from their very A nT hAeu sG te ro al lo igayn opfe rA us sp et rc at ilvi ae 15\n\nbeginnings through to the present. Geologists can read past climates from the rock sequences, to help understand the climatic changes that the Earth is now experiencing. Palaeontology is the study of fossils and the evolution of life. By comparing fossils with modern animals and plants, palaeontologists can interpret past conditions for life on the planet. Geophysics is the study of the Earth by the measurement of the effects of physical processes. Examples include recording of earthquake travel times and seismic waves to understand the internal structure of the Earth, or small changes in electric and magnetic fields to determine the nature of subsurface rocks. Geophysics also involves the mathematical modelling of internal Earth processes, such as the flow of solid materials, to understand deformation of rocks, movements of the crust and continents, and circulation in the core which is the dynamo for the Earth’s magnetic field. Geomorphology is the particular study of surface landforms and the processes that created them under the wide variety of climatic and other natural conditions that have prevailed on Earth. Geochemistry involves specialised studies of the chemistry of rocks and associated fluids. The studies involve both inorganic and organic chemistry. Inorganic chemistry studies include the analysis of igneous lavas and rocks to determine their origins and crystallisation histories, the analysis of sediments to unravel climate changes, and the analysis of metalliferous ores to determine their origins. Organic chemistry studies include probing the burial, heating history and formation of coals and petroleum, and searching for signs of life in meteorites from outer space. Geologists are primarily people who have a strong interest in the natural world and want a professional career that provides outdoor activity as well as scientific challenge. Geologists are employed by exploration and mining companies, by government organisations, as consultants, by financial firms, and as researchers and teachers by universities and schools. Contrary to a popular belief that geologists are only interested in ripping up the ground for mining, most geologists are very conscious of the delicate balance of the world’s environment on the land, in the sea and in the atmosphere. That is one of the messages in rocks. Many geologists are intimately involved in ensuring that the extraction of ores and energy is done with minimal impact on the environment.\n\nA u s t r a l i a n ge o l o gy W h y w e k n o w m o r e t h an w e d i d 5 0 y e ar s a g o There are two main reasons why our understanding of Australian geology is far different to that in the mid 1900s. Firstly there has been an unprecedented level of exploration of the Earth at an international level due to advances in technology, especially electronics and imaging from space after World War II. 16 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nSecondly, our knowledge of the Australian landmass has increased with the expanding population and development of the country. Internationally we can consider three key examples. The development of sonar during World War II started as a relatively simple exercise using sound pulses to detect the position and distance of an underwater object such as a submarine. This has now been extended\n\nto sensing the nature of the seabed to form images analogous to air photos, and also to using much higher powered seismic energy to penetrate the Earth and decipher its structure. Paralleling this work was the electronic acquisition of vast amounts of data on the magnetic and gravitational properties of the ocean floor and the continental margins. With the capabilities of modern computers we can process these data to reveal much about the origin of the rocks. The most comprehensive, international cooperative scientific program ever mounted began with the start of the Deep-Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) in the 1960s. The DSDP program evolved into the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), of which Australia was a member. The next phase, the International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), began in 2003. The original DSDP was designed to allow scientists to recover cores of the deep-sea bed, in water depths up to 5000 m, and to 1000 m below the seabed. The core is 50–100 mm in diameter. You can imagine the scene when the drill is extracted to recover one length of core, and the hole is to be re-entered for the next coring run. The job is to re-enter a small hole in 5000 m of water with the ship buffeted sometimes by gale-force winds, and currents moving at up to 2 m per second. The process has been likened to taking a pen refill on the end of a piece of thread and lowering it into the pen tube wedged in a crack on the road pavement many storeys below, while sitting on a rocking horse on the top of a tall city building. Why the effort? Geologists thought that\n\nthe sea floor was spreading open from the mid-ocean ridges. If this were so, the ocean floor should be younger near the mid-ocean ridges and progressively older farther away. How could we sample and then date this sea floor in 5000 m of water? The DSDP was\n\nFigure 1.10 The ODP drill ship Joides Resolution, which can drill holes in the seabed in water 5 km deep. Source: John Beck, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program\n\nA n A u s t r a l i a n p e r s p e c t i v e 17\n\nborn to recover rocks for dating from the deep ocean floor. The results were worth the effort, for they proved beyond doubt that the age of the ocean floors increases symmetrically out from the mid-ocean ridges towards the continents. It proved that the ocean floors are moving. New ocean floor is generated by basalt erupting at the ridges and spreading outwards. For the first time we know how fast the crust is moving, and how fast the inner parts might be churning around. Recent work using the Global Positioning System of satellites (GPS) has allowed us to measure these movements on a scale of decades. Finally, the ability to obtain images of Earth and the other planets and moons from vehicles in space has increased our limited perspective of this planet. Before the advent of high-altitude aircraft and satellites we could only see small areas at one time, perhaps a few kilometres across on a single photo.

The images allow us to see how rock masses relate to each other on a broad scale, show us the large fracture systems that cut through the Earth’s crust, and help us understand how it all came together. We know now that the Earth is just one example of a rocky planet in the Solar System, positioned at a delicate distance from the Sun where it is not too close for the atmosphere to be blown away by the heat and the solar wind, and not too distant to freeze water. We know that the Moon and probably Mercury have rocks similar to those on Earth. Each of these other bodies records the early history of the Solar System, which has been wiped out by erosion on Earth. After World War II the Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources was given the task of preparing a series of ‘four-mile maps’, at 1:250 000 scale of the whole of Australia to provide a basis for mineral exploration and proper planning. This task was essentially finished in the 1970s. Now the Bureau’s successor, Geoscience Australia, is preparing the second generation of maps and also undertaking fundamental exploration of the offshore areas. Under UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) gives Australia jurisdiction over the water column, seabed and subsoil in a marine area of some 10 million km 2, compared to the 7.7 million km2 area of onshore Australia. Australia has been comprehensively mapped, explored and drilled by companies looking for minerals, coal and petroleum. Almost all the country has at one time or other been subject to exploration, so samples have been recovered\n\nby drill holes from areas where the rocks are hidden by desert sands or river floodplains. Thousands of analyses have been made, giving us details of oil contents, coal types, gold and other metal values, geological ages, and compositions of groundwaters. One of the consequences of these advances is that we do not see Australian geology as a land-based study stopping at the seashore. For example, most of our oil and gas fields are offshore. The nature of the subsurface geology of the seabed around Australia is intimately linked to the continental shelves\n\nand coastal regions. It is clear that many onshore rocks formed in conditions similar to those offshore today, so by studying the offshore rocks we can understand more about the onshore geology. New discoveries are being made monthly. This is a wonderfully exciting time to be an earth scientist, with major new discoveries being made and big challenges ahead as we try to develop the resources to provide for society without destroying the purity of air and water, and the vast natural world which we value as Australia.\n\nSummary Europeans originally thought Australia was very young, compared to their well-known ‘old’ Europe. We now know that Australia contains some of the oldest rocks known on Earth. Most of the central and western parts have been stable for many millions of years and preserve an extraordinary record of Earth history. The long stability combined with erosion means it is one of the lowest and flattest land areas on Earth. Modern scientific advances on land, under the sea, and from space, combined with strenuous exploration for minerals and energy in the last 50 years, mean we have a much greater understanding of this continent than before.\n\nWebsites Geological Society of Australia Inc. www.gsa.org.au Geoscience Australia www.ga.gov.au General interest and Australian fossils www.australianmuseum.net.au/dinosaurs-and-their-relatives www.australianmuseum.net.au/minerals-and-fossils Glossary of terms www.ga.gov.au/glossary.jsp Satellite imagery of Australia www.ga.gov.au/remote-sensing/ A n A u s t r a l i a n p e r s p e c t i v e 19\n\nRadiometric dating http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/contents.html Radiocarbon dating www.c14dating.com The age of the Earth http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/contents.html Earthquakes Earthquakes in Australia www.ga.gov.au/hazards/earthquake Seismology Research Centre, La Trobe University www.seis.com.au/ Earthquakes in South Australia www.pir.sa.gov.au/minerals/earthquakes/ Earthquakes in the USA and the San Andreas fault system www.earthquake.usgs.gov/ Plate tectonics http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/topics/plate_tectonics/rift_man.php www.platetectonics.com Maps Geological Map of Australia This (1:5 000 000 scale) map can be ordered online from Geoscience Australia at www.ga.gov.au Online mapping facility www.ga/gov/au/map Environment and water maps of Australia www.earthsystems.com.au\n\n2 0 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nCh a p t er 2\n\nThe Earth: A geology primer T hi s c h a p t e r in t r o d u c e s t h e m ain i d e a s o f g e o l o g y, a n d e x p l ain s b r i e f l y t h e t e c h ni c al t e r m s u s e d in t hi s b o o k .

Inside the Earth are three components (see Figure 2.2): a central, hot core with a 3470 km radius, composed mainly of iron and nickel with a density of 10 000–13 000 kg/m3 (10–13 t/m3), solid in the centre and liquid in the outer core; a mantle 2900 km thick, composed of dense (3–6 t/m3) rocky material in a hot plastic state; and an outer, cool, solid crust with a density of 2–3 t/m3.The core and mantle make up most of the Earth – 99% by volume – while the crust is a relatively thin skin. The core-mantle boundary is a zone of fundamental importance. Circulation in the liquid 21\n\nouter core is the dynamo that produces the Earth’s magnetic field. A combination of thermal circulation and gravitation, as heavier constituents settle towards the centre, fuels this engine of the Earth’s magnetism. The core–mantle boundary has thin zones that slow seismic waves by 10–30%, but no-one knows why these thin zones occur. Recent work suggests that these ultra-low-velocity zones are caused by irregular patches of liquid material at the base of the mantle that contain impurities driven out as the core continues to cool and crystallise. Circulation in the overlying mantle is the main mechanism for heat transfer from the centre to the outer regions of the Earth, and is the primary engine driving the movements of the continents and the associated volcanism and earthquakes. We know that the Earth’s magnetic field has reversed (see Box 2.1), which means that there has probably been a major reversal in core circulation. Unfortunately we have\n\nFigure 2.1 The Earth from space, taken by Galileo spacecraft on 11 December 1990 about 1.5 million miles from Earth.

The causes of short-term changes ( 20 million years), such as the reversals. Considering the long time scales of these reversals (millions of years) compared to the shorter circulation times modelled for the outer core (thousands of years) it may be that variations in the lower mantle exert a control on outer core circulation. The shallower boundary between the mantle and the crust was discovered in 1909, and is called the Mohorovic˘ic´ discontinuity after its discoverer, or the Moho for short. It is a zone between one and several kilometres thick where the velocity of seismic compression waves (P-waves) increases suddenly from about 6.8–7.2 km/s in the crust to 8.1–8.2 km/s in the mantle. This velocity change is attributed to a change in chemical composition of the rocks: crustal rocks are richer in silicon but poorer in iron and magnesium than those in the mantle. The Moho lies at 30–40 km depth under inland western Australia, and 37–47 km under central New South Wales. The Earth's thin crust is of two types: continental and oceanic. Continental crust is heterogeneous and of relatively low density (2.0–2.8 t/m3), composed mainly of granites and sedimentary rocks. Oceanic crust is basaltic and has a density of 3.0–3.1 t/m3. Both continental and oceanic crusts are floating on the denser mantle. As a result of its lower density, continental crust floats on the mantle at a higher elevation, forming the landmasses and\n\nOCEANIC CRUST 8km OCEAN 5km\n\nCRUST\n\nm 0k 10 CONTINENTAL CRUST 45km\n\nINNER CORE\n\n70\n\n63\n\nkm\n\nOUTER CORE\n\nmountains, and varies from 30 to 70 km thick, averaging 45 km. In contrast, denser oceanic crust floats at a lower elevation, forming the ocean basins, and is typically 8 km thick. This three-part model of core, mantle and crust explains compositional variations but not how the rocks behave. Temperature increases towards the centre of the Earth, tending to make rocks molten, but higher pressures tend to keep them solid. There is a zone, typically about 100–200 km down, far below the base of the crust, where rock behaviour changes, although the chemical composition appears to remain essentially the same. But in this zone the rocks are most easily deformed. They have softened because of temperature increase but have not become immobilised by confining pressures. The\n\n2900 km\n\nASTHENOSPHERE weak, hot, plastic\n\nLITHOSPHERE (CRUST AND UPPER MANTLE) cold, rigid, brittle\n\nMANTLE\n\ntemperature at the top of this zone is estimated to be about 1300 °C. Temperature increase is greater below the oceanic crust, so the top of this zone is shallower (100 km) there than below the cooler continental crust (200 km). This zone marks the base of the lithosphere, and it is very important because it marks the level at which the major plates of the Earth’s surface move. Below this level the mantle deforms more easily, and we think it contains major convection cells that release heat from the Earth’s interior. This lower part of the mantle is called the asthenosphere. The lithosphere acts as a series of coherent plates floating on the more fluid asthenosphere, like large icebergs on the sea. So the moving lithospheric plates are composed of both the crust and part of the upper mantle.\n\nFigure 2.2 Cross-section of the Earth showing the core and mantle, and an expanded wedge to show the thin crust. The crust is of two types: thin oceanic crust and thicker continental crust. The mobile plates consist of lithosphere, made of the crust and part of the upper mantle, and these plates move on top of a convecting asthenosphere. Source: Physical Geology, McGraw-Hill\n\nA g e o l o g y p r i m e r 23\n\nOutside the solid part of the Earth lies a hydrosphere comprising the oceans, with a density of 1.09 kg/m3 and an average thickness of 4 km, and an atmosphere, with an average density of 0.00012 kg/m3. The atmosphere has 75% of its mass in the first 10 km and becomes less dense farther from the Earth’s surface, merging into outer space. The main components of the atmosphere are nitrogen (78%), oxygen (20%), argon (1%) and carbon dioxide (0.03%), and there are traces of other gases. The amount of water vapour is variable and can be as high as 4% near the surface. These thicknesses confirm that the hydrosphere and atmosphere, together about 15 km thick, are only a very thin skin on a rocky planet some 6370 km in radius at the equator.\n\nP l at e t e c t o nic s Tectonics is the study of the forces and movements in the Earth, especially in the outer parts. It is aptly named, because the ancient Greek word tekton means carpenter or builder. In 1912 the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener summarised the linear pattern of mountain belts on the surface of the Earth and explained these in terms of large rock masses moving horizontally – continental drift – with the resulting compression pushing rocks upwards to form the mountains. The theory of continental drift was taken up by a few enthusiasts, notably Alex du Toit in South Africa and later Sam Carey at the University of Tasmania. Most of the scientific community rejected the ideas. After all, what mechanism could be responsible for such movement? The answer came in the 1960s with detailed analyses of the magnetism recorded in rocks. 2 4 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nAlthough direct measurements of the Earth’s magnetic field have been made only in about the last 400 years, the rock record preserves evidence of the Earth’s palaeomagnetism back to at least 3.5 billion years ago. The discovery of patterns of ‘magnetic stripes’ in rocks on the ocean floors showed that the Earth has experienced magnetic reversals. The stripes formed because the Earth’s magnetic field has reversed periodically – that is, the north magnetic pole switches position to the south geographic pole, and vice versa. We call the present situation ‘normal polarity’; and when the north pole is in Antarctica it is ‘reversed polarity’ (see Box 2.1). Obviously, during periods of reversed magnetism the compass needle would point southwards! As far as we can tell from analysing the change in polarity through a thick pile of basalts, the Earth’s magnetic field does not flip instantly. The magnetic poles move, often in a convoluted fashion, across the globe and can take 10 000 years or more to reposition themselves fully. By dating the rocks we can put ages on these periods of normal and reversed polarity, as shown in Figure 2.3. The oscillation pattern is irregular. We do not know what is driving these changes, except that we think they are due to changes in the circulation of the Earth’s molten, iron-rich core. These reversals have been observed as far back as the Precambrian, though the more recent events are best known and most accurately dated. The magnetic fields preserved in the rocks of the ocean floors display striped zones of normal and reversed polarity. These stripes\n\noccur symmetrically on both sides of the midoceanic ridges. Furthermore, the rocks are younger near the ridge and older farther away. This symmetry of age and magnetic signature confirms that rocks rise in a molten state at the mid-oceanic ridges and then spread sideways in both directions. As the plates spread apart, some minerals within the rocks incorporate the magnetic polarity at that time. During periods of reversed polarity, some millions of years later, the minerals incorporate the reversed polarity. It is as if two identical recording tapes are being slowly pulled out of the crack at the mid-ocean ridge, one to either side, and each magnetic reversal is printed onto each tape. Here was firm evidence for the movement envisaged by Wegener, du Toit and Carey. The theory of plate tectonics was born. But what is driving this movement? It is thought that convection cells in the mantle drive heated material upwards, expanding and elevating oceanic lithosphere along the spreading zones. That is why the spreading zones are marked by mid-ocean ridges – huge submarine mountain chains built by the sea-floor basaltic volcanoes. In some places these volcanoes poke above sea level, for example in Iceland and in the Azores in the mid Atlantic Ocean.Then as the lithosphere spreads laterally it cools, contracts and subsides, forming the broad abyssal plains of the ocean basins, typically at 4000–5000 m water depth. However, it is not clear that the rising mid-ocean ridge just pushes the oceanic parts of the plates away to the sides. Mantle convection is driven by rising heat but also by the density difference between the hot mantle\n\nand sinking slabs of cold lithosphere. Much of this plate movement is probably achieved as the slab of cold lithosphere sinks down in the subduction zones along the margins of the ocean basins. In this scenario the slab-pull keeps opening the crack along the mid-ocean ridge, which is filled by rising basaltic magma. There is also lively debate about whether the mantle convection involves cells through the whole depth of the mantle, or whether the mantle is divided into two layers at a prominent seismic discontinuity at 660 km depth, with the plates being driven by cells in the upper part. The older theory of continental drift viewed the continents as moving across the oceans like independent pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. We now understand that each fragment of continental crust is linked to the surrounding ocean crust (see Figure 1.4), and that both oceanic crust and continental fragments (the lithosphere) are riding upon a moving asthenosphere.\n\nP l a t e m ar g in s Three types of plate margin are recognised: divergent, convergent and transform. Divergent plate margins form where upwelling of the mantle along fractures thousands of kilometres long causes the plate to break apart. This upwelling can underlie continents or oceans. Above lines of rising mantle the plates are subject to tension, and commonly crack like a piece of plaster board that has been flexed. In these areas of extension, lithospheric plates can be broken apart, leaving deep rifts. Examples are the Great Rift Valley, which runs down central eastern Africa, and the Red Sea, a rift now fallen below sea level. A g e o l o g y p r i m e r 25\n\nBox 2.1 Ag e-d at i n g t h e r o c ks In Chapter 1 (Box 1.1) radiometric dating was described as the principal method used to determine the absolute age of rocks. Geologists commonly use four other methods to date rocks: magnetic signature, thermoluminescence, fossils, and fission track dating. M AGNE T I C S I GNATU R E\n\nThe magnetic signature of a rock is influenced by the orientation of the Earth’s magnetic field at the time it is formed, and we know the magnetic field varies in direction and intensity. For instance, the magnetic poles move relative to the geographic poles or spin axis of the Earth. The South Magnetic Pole, first visited by Australian geologists Edgeworth David and Douglas Mawson and medical doctor Forbes Mackay in 1908, has now moved to a position in the sea. Variations in the Earth’s magnetic field can be recorded in both igneous rocks and sediments. In igneous rocks, the magnetism is recorded instantly as magnetic minerals crystallise from the magma. As magma cools, mineral grains pass though the Curie point, which for magnetite is about 575 °C.

While sediments are poorer magnetic recorders than igneous rocks, they were laid down continuously and hence have potentially better time coverage. However, the magnetism is weaker because of varying oxidation of the magnetic particles, and may be acquired over a longer time period and hence be time-averaged. Most spectacularly, the rocks show that the Earth’s magnetic field has completely reversed in the geological past. These oscillations can be measured on oriented rock samples in the laboratory, along sediment cores, and by towing a magnetometer at sea to measure the variations across the ocean floors. The most recent polarity reversals are numbered in sequence to number 33, which occurred 79 million years ago. A very important time marker is the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal, which occurred 780 000 years ago. Four major polarity chrons (time zones with a duration of around 1 million years) are recognised over the last 5 million years: the present Brunhes and earlier Gauss chrons are dominantly normal polarity, and the Matuyama and Gilbert chrons are dominantly reversed polarity. Within each chron are short periods when the polarity is temporarily changed. There are also superchrons – very long periods with no reversals – such as the Cretaceous normal superchron from 118–83 Ma ago, and the late Palaeozoic reversed superchron 317–262 Ma ago. To convert a palaeomagnetic signature to an absolute age, marker beds have to be dated by radiometric dating. For the magnetic reversal scale this has been done many times to establish the ages of each reversal. Having established this pattern we can use it to date rocks. For instance, many weathered rocks in Australia, the deeper deposits in salt lakes, and some of the glacial deposits in Tasmania display reversed polarity and so must pre-date the Brunhes-Matuyama transition 780 000 years ago. The palaeomagnetic record in rocks shows that there is a range of variations in the Earth’s magnetic field, from secular variation as the magnetic pole rotates, through excursions where there are major changes in the field (but of the same polarity), to full polarity reversals. A comparison of magnetic data recorded by satellites in 1979–1980 and 2000 shows that the Earth’s magnetic field has partly collapsed. The reversed magnetic flux is evident in two places: beneath southern Africa and the North Pole. Such a situation may be just a temporary excursion, but it may also be the state to which the Earth’s dynamo moves before a full magnetic reversal. THER MOLUMINE SCE NCE DAT I NG\n\nGrains of quartz and feldspar on the surface of the Earth are exposed to external ionising radiation, which is preserved as charges trapped in defects in the atomic lattice. When the sediment grain is buried this external ionising radiation is stopped. This change provides a basis for dating the time of burial of the sediments. The trapped charges can be liberated by heating the crystalline grain, typically to 270–400 °C, and a proportion of the trapped charge recombines, causing an emission of light that can be measured. This thermoluminescence (TL) is recorded digitally on a sensitive instrument as a glow curve. The trapped charge can also be released by irradiating the grain with a particular wavelength of light (e.g. an argon-ion laser with a wavelength of 514 nm) and measuring the emission at a different wavelength. This is called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). All grains contain traces of radioactive uranium and thorium, which can also A g e o l o g y p r i m e r 27\n\ncause light to be emitted. The age is finally determined by measuring the glow curve and then taking account of any glow caused by the inherent radioactivity. TL and OSL dating are useful for dating material up to 100 000 years old, and in some cases to 500 000 years – well beyond the age range of radiocarbon (C-14) dating. Moreover, they enable geologists to date younger quartzose sediments such as old beaches, dune systems and river channel sands that are devoid of the organic materials required for radiocarbon dating. F OSSI L S\n\nThe evolutionary sequence of fossils through the geological record is well established. We know there are large parts of the record missing because organisms were not preserved or because the sedimentary sequences were eroded. However, on a large scale we know that, for example, trilobites (see Chapter 8) existed only from the Cambrian through the Permian (542–251 Ma). Within this span, trilobite age ranges have been determined for individual genera and species. So if we find rocks containing particular trilobites we can place them in the age sequence. Many other fossils, such as shells, corals, plants, foraminifera and graptolites, can be used to determine the geological age of sedimentary rocks. We call this method biostratigraphic dating. In some cases the fossils can provide ages only to the nearest 10 million years. In places where detailed studies have been made and the rocks through the sequence have been dated by absolute methods, the age of individual fossils can be resolved to a range of less than 1 million years. F I SSI ON- T RACK DAT I N G\n\nMinute amounts of uranium (U-238) occur in some minerals. When present the uranium undergoes radioactive decay (fission), and the emitted particles damage the atomic lattice in the host mineral. These defects can be etched with acid to make them visible as small cylindrical holes (tracks) on polished grain surfaces under a microscope. Initially formed tracks are round 16 μm (microns) long and 1–2 μm in diameter. The number of defects depends on the amount of uranium within the grain and the age of the sample. Greater uranium content and longer time will produce more fission tracks. The amount of uranium content is measured using a slice of a mineral free of uranium, typically muscovite, which is placed on top of the sample. Together they are exposed to radioactivity in a nuclear reactor, causing some of the uranium to fission and create defects in the muscovite slice. The number of tracks recorded in the muscovite is a measure of the uranium content in the underlying mineral. The original tracks in the grain (caused by natural, spontaneous fission) are compared with the number in the muscovite detector (caused by induced fission) to derive an age. At higher temperatures the lattice naturally heals itself (anneals), resetting the fission track clock to zero. The two minerals commonly used for fission track dating – apatite and zircon – have annealing temperatures of 100–120 °C (apatite) and 210 °C (zircon). Heating is required over a 1 million to 10 million year timescale to anneal the tracks. When apatite is heated above 60° C the fission track length shortens, until over 120 °C it is totally healed. 2 8 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nSo the fission-track age is an apparent age that records the time since the rock cooled through the annealing temperature. It does not record the original age of the rock formation. Although increased heat flow as a result of nearby magmatism or movement of hydrothermal fluids is a possible cause, the primary cause of regional annealing is crustal heating. While the rocks are deeply buried the fission tracks are being continually annealed. Tectonic uplift and elevation of rocks out of the deeper, hotter regions allows fission tracks to be preserved. That is, the fission track ages can provide information on the age of continental uplift, and through this the rates of erosion, or denudation, of the landscape. Regional studies using fission-track dating show that the long-term denudation rate across Australia has been around 10 m per million years. Higher rates of 15–20 m per million years occurred in southwestern Western Australia and the Kimberley region between 250 and 200 Ma ago, and very much higher rates of up to 40 m per million years in southeastern Australia around 50 Ma ago. Other uses of fission-track dating are: • Dating tektites, the siliceous glassy buttons which form during meteorite impacts (see Chapter 12). Fission tracks record when this material solidified and fell back to Earth. • Dating fused glasses around impact structures. The rocks were melted by the impact, so the fissiontrack age is the age of impact. • Dating uplift of mountain belts and sedimentary basins, where the fission-track age denotes the time the rocks were elevated to cooler levels in the crust. By establishing fission-track ages across a continent we can tell when various parts were uplifted relative to one another.\n\nGenerally there is volcanism along the cracks in the rift where hot magmas rise towards the surface, and along fractures thousands of kilometres long beside the rifts. If extension continues, the fragmented plate splits apart and the two parts drift away from each other. The gap is filled by basalt, forming a new ocean floor. Thus there are two phases of break-up – rift and drift. Divergent plate margins have formed the major ocean basins, in which upwelling basaltic magma is injected between the diverging plates to form new crust at spreading centres. The active spreading centres form long midoceanic ridges (MORs), which are undersea volcanic mountain chains.\n\nWater and other fluids emanate from vents along the spreading ridges. The vent fluids are mainly seawater that has circulated through the upper parts of the ocean crust, becoming hotter and enr iched with sulphur and commonly with iron and other metals such as copper and zinc. Extraordinary invertebrates live around these vents, functioning on a metabolic sulphur cycle. The water can be at temperatures up to 350 °C, though it does not boil because of the high water pressure. It is clear that basalts from the mantle can be channelled through hotspots where massive amounts of magma are erupted. Unlike the long plate boundary fractures, hotspots are only 50–100 km wide. Large A g e o l o g y p r i m e r 29\n\nFigure 2.4 Basalt lava in Hawaii, showing the glassy surface formed by chilling. Source: David Johnson\n\nhotspots pour out massive amounts of basalt, estimated at up to tens of cubic kilometres over several million years. These result in the large igneous provinces (LIPs) such as the Deccan basalts of India and the Siberian LIP. Another example is the Kerguelen LIP which formed over a period of some 85 million years (119–34 Ma)during and after the split of India and Australia from Antarctica. Hotspots have been attributed to mantle plumes, which are tall columns of mantle material rising from the base of the mantle and concentrating extra heat at one spot. However, there is also debate whether the plume concept is correct. If plumes rise from the base of the mantle there would have to be a 3000 km vertical continuity, and such a scenario does not hold up in models. It may be that the locations of hotspots and large igneous 3 0 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\nprovinces are determined more by weaknesses in the lithosphere, perhaps as cracks that propagate during plate movement. Smaller hotspots form a single but perhaps multi-vented volcano. As a plate drifts over a hotspot, a series of volcanoes are formed in a line parallel to the direction of movement. A well-known example of this is the Hawaiian chain, where the present active volcanoes are only the most recent in a long chain that goes back millions of years. Older volcanic islands to the northwest are now extinct because they have passed over the hotspot and are now removed from the source of hot basalt. The Tasman seamounts east of Australia (see Chapter 9) are another example. Convergent plate margins form where the convection cells of the mantle are moving downwards, forcing plates together.\n\nA subduction zone is formed where one plate sinks beneath another. In ocean areas, the down-going plate can form a deep trench in the ocean floor along the boundary, such as the Marianas Trench near the Philippines or the Peru Trench off South America. Such trenches can be 10 000–11 000 m deep – some 6000 m deeper than the floors of the main ocean basins. The denser and cooler converging plate sinks back into the mantle, and this sinking is typically marked by a zone of earthquakes at increasing depth, called the Benioff zone. The down-going plate becomes hotter and the mantle above it starts to melt. The resulting magma rises through the overlying plate to form a line of volcanoes parallel to the convergent margin, about 150 km from the edge of the upper plate. Typically these volcanoes form curved zones on maps, and are\n\ncalled volcanic arcs. Subduction that occurs in ocean crust, such as that around Tonga, is called an island arc. Subduction under the edge of a continent, as occurs along the Andes or northwestern USA, is called a continental arc. A recent analysis of earthquake travel times showed that zones of higher seismic velocity extend from the subduction zones deep into the mantle. The higher velocities imply denser rock masses. These higher velocity zones cross the 660 km thermal boundary into the lower mantle, though there is evidence of deflection and kinking of the plate between 500 and 1000 km depth. These zones are interpreted as remnant slabs of cold crust that are sinking deep into the mantle, persisting to around 1800 km depth, and then disintegrating across a zone at 1800–2300 km depth.

It also suggests that the very deep interval between 2000 km and the coremantle boundary contains important clues to understanding the dynamics, composition and evolution of the Earth’s interior. A collision zone is formed where subduction ceases and the convergence of two continents forces the rock masses vertically upwards, forming huge mountain chains; for example, at the boundary between the IndoAustralian and Eurasian plates where India is colliding with China, forming the Himalaya. These collisions deform the rocks and can push slabs of rock hundreds of kilometres horizontally on thrust faults (see Figures 2.6, 3.10biii). Transform plate margins occur where two plates are sliding past each other, as in the San Andreas Fault in California. The Great Alpine Fault, which extends down the south island of New Zealand and has separated rock masses by 300 km over the past few million years, is another example. Earthquakes are very common in these regions, but volcanism is absent. Transform faults are very common in the ocean crust, at right angles to the spreading axis. Transform faults connect offsets in the line of the spreading axis, so that at any place the sea floor is moving in opposite directions on either side of the fault. In most situations the spreading rate is essentially the same along the main axis. Plate tectonics has been developed as a complete theory only over the past 35 years, and has explained many features that had 3 2 T h e g e o l o g y o f A u s t r a l i a\n\npuzzled geologists. For example, vertical movements were thought to be due primarily to isostasy – the changes in buoyancy experienced by the crust floating on the mantle as mountains grew or were eroded. An analogy was made with wooden blocks of different sizes floating on water. A large block sits higher above the surface and also extends lower beneath the water. According to this idea, as mountains grow a deep mass of rock or mountain root forms under mountain belts to compensate for the increased weight. During erosion the mass rises to compensate for the loss of weight. While this effect is undoubtedly true, it does not explain why mountains form in the first place or why deep basins subside. Plate tectonics accounts not only for the lateral movements of plates over the globe but also for the vertical movements known as uplift and subsidence. Uplift is caused by the expansion and rising of hot crust, heated by hot mantle from underneath, or by the buckling as two plates collide. Subsidence is generally caused by the contraction and sinking of colder crust, or by sag and cracking as a plate is pulled apart. Plate convergence is the major process causing rocks to be compressed into folds, like the wrinkles in a tablecloth when it is pushed across a table top. In folds the rocks are essentially being bent like plastic. There is some recrystallisation and small-scale slippage, but on a gross scale the rocks are deformed as if they were soft. The process occurs very slowly, on a scale of millions of years. Some folds are relatively broad and open, though with greater compression the limbs\n\nof the fold can be squeezed parallel, forming isoclinal folds. Isoclinal means‘same inclination’ because the limbs are now at the same angle. Lateral compression can also push the fold over so that the limbs are then horizontal, forming a recumbent fold. It is interesting to note that folds show the amount of shortening experienced within the Earth’s crust. By taking a piece of rope and tracing it over the folds, then drawing it out straight, the amount of shortening can be measured. Measurements of 50% shortening are not uncommon (see Figure 2.6). Rocks can also suffer brittle deformation, breaking and moving past each other along flat surfaces called faults. Faults range from small movements of less than 1 m to major displacements of more than 10 km, as along parts of the Darling Fault in Western Australia. Normal faults form during tension when one block slides down against the other. Reverse faults form during compression when one block moves steeply over the next block. Thrust faults form when one rock mass moves laterally over an essentially horizontal fault plane by lateral compression of the Earth’s crust. Strike slip faults develop when one rock mass is moved horizontally. What happens when large rock masses are stretched beyond their breaking point? The rock mass cracks open, forming joints. A joint is a planar fracture across which there has been no appreciable relative displacement (unlike a fault). Some joints for m dur ing cooling of or iginal igneous rocks such as granite plutons, or columnar basalt. Tectonic stresses also form vertical joints in sets, typically at\n\nright angles, for example those exposed on rock platforms or as cliff faces where joint blocks have fallen off into the valley below (see Figures 6.1 and 10.8). Near horizontal joints form during unloading as erosion removes the weight of overlying rocks, and hence the compressive stress, allowing the rocks to expand upwards. A special case, exfoliation joints, occurs where the crust is being squeezed horizontally, and layers are split off parallel to the land surface. Brittle deformation on a smaller scale forms rocks that look as if they have been shattered, forming an accumulation of angular, fractured pieces known as breccia. Large-scale tectonism occurs over millions of years, and multiple deformation of the rocks is common. Major deformed rocks, such as those in the Willyama Complex at Broken Hill, the Cooma Complex in New South Wales, and the Mt Isa region, typically show one set of folds overprinted by another, with perhaps four separate generations of deformation.\n\nMin e r a l s Minerals are naturally occurring crystals (see Figure 2.7). Minerals have individual crystal structures and can be identified by their chemical composition, their crystal structure (determined by X-ray analysis), their hardness and their tendency to break along preferred directions (or cleavages) which correspond to planes of weakness in the atomic lattice structure. Hardness has proved a useful test; on a standard hardness scale called Mohs’ scale, known to all geologists, 1 is the softest mineral and 10 is the hardest.
