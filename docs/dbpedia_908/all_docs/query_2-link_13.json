        "text": "ARLINGTON, VA, October 3, 2022 ̶ Leonardo DRS, a leading provider of advanced multi-domain defense products, will participate in the 2022 Land Forces Exposition between October 4th and 6th at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Center in Brisbane, Australia. The company will highlight a range of technologies, including its battle management system, mounted and dismounted EO/IR systems, onboard vehicle power system, among a range of other capabilities.\n\nLeonardo DRS will be located in Stand #3T14.\n\n“As a leading provider of advanced technologies to the Australian Land Forces and the U.S. military, we design, manufacture and deliver mission-critical solutions to ensure our armed forces are the most advanced they can be,” said Mike Coulter, President of International Programs for Leonardo DRS. “We are excited to display our advanced technologies at the 2022 Land Forces Exposition and demonstrate how we are keeping warfighters mission ready.”\n\nCOUNTER-UAS\n\nLeonardo DRS has two mobile air defence systems currently in the U.S. military inventory and deployed to regions around the world with the greatest threats, the Mobile-Low, Slow, Small Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (MLIDS), and the Maneuver Short Range Air Defence (M-SHORAD).\n\nThe M-LIDS is a two-vehicle system: one that detects and tracks UAS threats using a combination of sensors, and the other that employs a variety of electronic and kinetic solutions, including a 30mm cannon and the Coyote small killer drone, to either jam the control signals of the small UAS or kill it.\n\nThe M-SHORAD program is an Air Defence Artillery capability which moves and maneuvers in to destroy, neutralize or deter larger low altitude aerial threats, including rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft.\n\nSEE IT ALL\n\nLeonardo DRS is a long-time provider of the in-service individual weapon sights and thermal targeting systems for the U.S. Army. The sights include the Family of Weapon Sights – Individual, Family of Weapon Sights – Crew Served, and the long-range Improved Night / Day Observation Device (INOD) thermal weapon sight.\n\nWith tens of thousands of systems fielded and combat-proven with U.S. Army forces, the weapon sights are known for their superior performance on the battlefield in night/day, degraded battlefield, and in poor weather conditions.\n\nNEXT-GENERATION SITUATIONAL AWARENESS\n\nLeonardo DRS is the sole-source provider of mission-critical C4I hardware for the U.S. Army. The same hardware is also in use today with the Australian Army’s M1A1SA tanks providing the capability to support and operate battle management software, integrate all required Line of Sight and Beyond Line-of-Sight communications, and integrate cameras and other sensors all in one computer.\n\nThe hardware provides the Army’s armored cavalry units improved connectivity within the Australian Defence Force as well as increased U.S., Joint, and Coalition battle management system interoperability in the field.\n\nThe Leonardo DRS C4I hardware system fulfills the Australian Army mission requirements of today and is fundamental to providing future capabilities like the Health and Usage Management System, Weapons System Integration, sensor integration, and future upgrades to the network architecture.\n\nMIND THE GAP\n\nLeonardo DRS is also the primary producer of the next generation of combat assault bridging systems with the new Joint Assault Bridge also in use with the U.S. Army. The Joint Assault Bridge (JAB) provides rapid support to ground forces with a survivable, deployable and sustainable heavy-assault-bridging capability.\n\nThe JAB provides gap-crossing capability to cross wet or dry gaps, and freedom of maneuver on the battlefield to keep pace with Abrams Heavy Brigade Combat Team operations. The JAB is an M1A1 Abrams tank hull with heavy (M1A2) suspension integrated with a hydraulic bridge launcher system to launch the existing Military Load Class 115 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge. The JAB improves force readiness, survivability, mobility and agility equal to the legacy force."
