        "text": "Kineto-dynamic design optimisation for vehicle-specific seat-suspension systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShangguan, Wen-Bin; Shui, Yijie; Rakheja, Subhash\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDesigns and analyses of seat-suspension systems are invariably performed considering effective vertical spring rate and damping properties, while neglecting important contributions due to kinematics of the widely used cross-linkage mechanism. In this study, a kineto-dynamic model of a seat-suspension is formulated to obtain relations for effective vertical suspension stiffness and damping characteristics as functions of those of the air spring and the hydraulic damper, respectively. The proposed relations are verified through simulations of the multi-body dynamic model of the cross-linkage seat-suspension in the ADAMS platform. The validity of the kineto-dynamic model is also demonstrated through comparisons of its vibration transmission response with the experimental data. The model is used to identify optimal air spring coordinates to attain nearly constant natural frequency of the suspension, irrespective of the seated body mass and seated height. A methodology is further proposed to identify optimal damping requirements for vehicle-specific suspension designs to achieve minimal seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) and vibration dose value (VDV) considering vibration spectra of different classes of earthmoving vehicles. The shock and vibration isolation performance potentials of the optimal designs are evaluated under selected vehicle vibration superimposed with shock motions. Results show that the vehicle-specific optimal designs could provide substantial reductions in the SEAT and VDV values for the vehicle classes considered.\n\nActive control of an innovative seat suspension system with acceleration measurement based friction estimation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNing, Donghong; Sun, Shuaishuai; Li, Hongyi; Du, Haiping; Li, Weihua\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn this paper, an innovative active seat suspension system for vehicles is presented. This seat suspension prototype is built with two low cost actuators each of which has one rotary motor and one gear reducer. A Hâ controller with friction compensation is designed for the seat suspension control system where the friction is estimated and compensated based on the measurement of seat acceleration. This principal aim of this research was to control the low frequency vibration transferred or amplified by the vehicle (chassis) suspension, and to maintain the passivity of the seat suspension at high frequency (isolation vibration) while taking into consideration the trade-off between the active seat suspension cost and its high frequency performance. Sinusoidal excitations of 1-4.5 Hz were applied to test the active seat suspension both when controlled and when uncontrolled and this is compared with a well-tuned passive heavy duty vehicle seat suspension. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm within the tested frequencies. Further tests were conducted using the excitations generated from a quarter-car model under bump and random road profiles. The bump road tests indicate the controlled active seat suspension has good transient response performance. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) method and ISO 2631-1 standards were applied to analyse the seat suspension's acceleration under random road conditions. Although some low magnitude and high frequency noise will inevitably be introduced by the active system, the weighted-frequency Root Mean Square (RMS) acceleration shows that this may not have a large effect on ride comfort. In fact, the ride comfort is improved from being an 'a little uncomfortable' to a 'not uncomfortable' level when compared with the well-tuned passive seat suspension. This low cost active seat suspension design and the proposed controller with the easily measured feedback signals are very practical for real\n\nActive vibration attenuating seat suspension for an armored helicopter crew seat\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSztein, Pablo Javier\n\nAn Active Vibration Attenuating Seat Suspension (AVASS) for an MH-60S helicopter crew seat is designed to protect the occupants from harmful whole-body vibration (WBV). Magnetorheological (MR) suspension units are designed, fabricated and installed in a helicopter crew seat. These MR isolators are built to work in series with existing Variable Load Energy Absorbers (VLEAs), have minimal increase in weight, and maintain crashworthiness for the seat system. Refinements are discussed, based on testing, to minimize friction observed in the system. These refinements include the addition of roller bearings to replace friction bearings in the existing seat. Additionally, semi-active control of the MR dampers is achieved using special purpose built custom electronics integrated into the seat system. Experimental testing shows that an MH-60S retrofitted with AVASS provides up to 70.65% more vibration attenuation than the existing seat configuration as well as up to 81.1% reduction in vibration from the floor.\n\nVibration control of an energy regenerative seat suspension with variable external resistance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNing, Donghong; Sun, Shuaishuai; Du, Haiping; Li, Weihua; Zhang, Nong\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn this paper, an energy regenerative seat suspension with a variable external resistance is proposed and built, and a semi-active controller for its vibration control is also designed and validated. The energy regenerative seat suspension is built with a three-phase generator and a gear reducer, which are installed in the scissors structure centre of the seat suspension, and the vibration energy is directly harvested from the rotary movement of suspension's scissors structure. The electromagnetic torque of the semi-active seat suspension actuator is controlled by an external variable resistor. An integrated model including the seat suspension's kinematics and the generator is built and proven to match the test result very well. A simplified experimental phenomenon model is also built based on the test results for the controller design. A state feedback Hâ controller is proposed for the regenerative seat suspension's semi-active vibration control. The proposed regenerative seat suspension and its controller are validated with both simulations and experiments. A well-tuned passive seat suspension is applied to evaluate the regenerative seat's performance. Based on ISO 2631-1, the frequency-weighted root mean square (FW-RMS) acceleration of the proposed seat suspension has a 22.84% reduction when compared with the passive one, which indicates the improvement of ride comfort. At the same time, the generated RMS power is 1.21 W. The proposed regenerative seat suspension can greatly improve the driver's ride comfort and has the potential to be developed to a self-powered semi-active system.\n\nDevelopment of an MR seat suspension with self-powered generation capability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, S. S.; Ning, D. H.; Yang, J.; Du, H.; Zhang, S. W.; Li, W. H.; Nakano, M.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper proposes a self-powered magnetorheological (MR) seat suspension on the basis of a rotary MR damper and an electromagnetic induction device. By applying the self-powering component to the MR seat suspension, the operation cost of the semi-active seat is much cheaper because no external energy is required to control the MR damper. In this paper, the structure, design and analysis of the seat suspension were presented following the introduction section. The property tests of the self-powered seat suspension were conducted using an MTS machine. A robust control algorithm was developed to control the self-powered MR seat suspension and the vibration attenuation performance of the seat suspension was tested under two different vibration excitations, i.e. harmonic excitation and random excitation. The testing result verifies that the self-powered MR seat suspension under proper control can improve the ride comfort for passengers and drivers.\n\nDisturbance observer based Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control for an active seat suspension\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNing, Donghong; Sun, Shuaishuai; Zhang, Fei; Du, Haiping; Li, Weihua; Zhang, Bangji\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn this paper, a disturbance observer based Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy controller is proposed for an active seat suspension; both simulations and experiments have been performed verifying the performance enhancement and stability of the proposed controller. The controller incorporates closed-loop feedback control using the measured acceleration of the seat and deflection of the suspension; these two variables can be easily measured in practical applications, thus allowing the proposed controller to be robust and adaptable. A disturbance observer that can estimate the disturbance caused by friction, model simplification, and controller output error has also been used to compensate a Hâ state feedback controller. The TS fuzzy control method is applied to enhance the controller's performance by considering the variation of driver's weight during operation. The vibration of a heavy duty vehicle seat is largest in the frequency range between 2 Hz and 4 Hz, in the vertical direction; therefore, it is reasonable to focus on controlling low frequency vibration amplitudes and maintain the seat suspensions passivity at high frequency. Moreover, both the simulation and experimental results show that the active seat suspension with the proposed controller can effectively isolate unwanted vibration amplitudes below 4.5 Hz, when compared with a well-tuned passive seat suspension. The active controller has been further validated under bump and random road tests with both a 55 kg and a 70 kg loads. The bump road test demonstrated the controller has good transient response capabilities. The random road test result has been presented both in the time domain and the frequency domain. When with the above two loads, the controlled seat suspensions root-mean-square (RMS) accelerations were reduced by 45.5% and 49.5%, respectively, compared with a well-tuned passive seat suspension. The proposed active seat suspension controller has great potential and is very practical for application\n\nDesign and evaluation of a suspension seat to reduce vibration exposure of subway operators: a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarcotte, Pierre; Beaugrand, Sylvie; Boutin, JÃ©rÃ´me; Larue, Christian\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSubway operators have complained about discomfort caused by whole-body vibration. To address this problem, a suspension seat with extensive ergonomic features has been adapted to the confined space of the subway operator cab. The suspension was modified from an existing suspension in order to reduce the dominant frequency of the subway vertical vibration (2.4 Hz). The suspension seat has been extensively tested on a vertical hydraulic shaker. These tests have shown that the SEAT value was lower for a higher vibration level, for higher subject weight, and for the suspension adjusted at median height. The seat also produces a lower SEAT value when there was a predominance of the 6 Hz vibration component. The horizontal seat adjustments had no influence on the suspension SEAT value. Removing the suspension damper also decreases the SEAT value for all the tested configurations. The final version of the suspension seat prototype was validated during normal subway operation with 19 different operators having weight in the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of the operator population. Accelerations were measured with triaxial accelerometers at the seat cushion, above the suspension and on the floor. In addition to the vibration measurements, each operator was asked about his perceived discomfort from vibration exposure. Globally, the suspension seat attenuated the vertical vibration (SEAT values from 0.86 to 0.99), but discomfort due to amplification of the 2.4 Hz component occurred when the suspension height was adjusted at the minimum, even when the global weighted acceleration was lower (SEAT value < 1). These results suggest that in order to reduce the discomfort caused by whole-body vibration, the transmissibility of the seat should also be considered, in particular when there is a dominant frequency in the vibration spectra.\n\nAdaptive magnetorheological seat suspension for shock mitigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Harinder J.; Wereley, Norman M.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nAn adaptive magnetorheological seat suspension (AMSS) was analyzed for optimal protection of occupants from shock loads caused by the impact of a helicopter with the ground. The AMSS system consists of an adaptive linear stroke magnetorheological shock absorber (MRSA) integrated into the seat structure of a helicopter. The MRSA provides a large controllability yield force to accommodate a wide spectrum for shock mitigation. A multiple degrees-of-freedom nonlinear biodynamic model for a 50th percentile male occupant was integrated with the dynamics of MRSA and the governing equations of motion were investigated theoretically. The load-stroke profile of MRSA was optimized with the goal of minimizing the potential for injuries. The MRSA yield force and the shock absorber stroke limitations were the most crucial parameters for improved biodynamic response mitigation. An assessment of injuries based on established injury criteria for different body parts was carried out.\n\nAdaptive magnetorheological seat suspension for shock mitigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Harinder Jit\n\nThis research focuses on theoretical and experimental analysis of an adaptive seat suspension employing magnetorheological energy absorber with the objective of minimizing injury potential to seated occupant of different weights subjected to broader crash intensities. The research was segmented into three tasks: (1) development of magnetorheological energy absorber, (2) biodynamic modeling of a seated occupant, and (3) control schemes for shock mitigation. A linear stroking semi-active magnetorheological energy absorber (MREA) was designed, fabricated and tested for intense impact conditions with piston velocities up to 8 m/s. MREA design was optimized on the basis of Bingham-plastic model (BPM model) in order to maximize the energy absorption capabilities at high impact velocities. Computational fluid dynamics and magnetic FE analysis were conducted to validate MREA performance. Subsequently, low-speed cyclic testing (0-2 Hz subjected to 0-5.5 A) and high-speed drop testing (0-4.5 m/s at 0 A) were conducted for quantitative comparison with the numerical simulations. Later, a nonlinear four degrees-of-freedom biodynamic model representing a seated 50th percentile male occupant was developed on the basis of experiments conducted on Hybrid II 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test device. The response of proposed biodynamic model was compared quantitatively against two different biodynamic models from the literature that are heavily implemented for obtaining biodynamic response under impact conditions. The proposed biodynamic model accurately predicts peak magnitude, overall shape and the duration of the biodynamic transient response, with minimal phase shift. The biodynamic model was further validated against 16 impact tests conducted on horizontal accelerator facility at NAVAIR for two different shock intensities. Compliance effects of human body were also investigated on the performance of adaptive seat suspension by comparing the proposed biodynamic model\n\nEvaluation of commercially available seat suspensions to reduce whole body vibration exposures in mining heavy equipment vehicle operators.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Jeong Ho; Marin, Luz S; Dennerlein, Jack T\n\n2018-09-01\n\nAs mining vehicle operators are exposed to high level of Whole body vibration (WBV) for prolonged periods of time, approaches to reduce this exposure are needed for the specific types of exposures in mining. Although various engineering controls (i.e. seat suspension systems) have been developed to address WBV, there has been lack of research to systematically evaluate these systems in reducing WBV exposures in mining heavy equipment vehicle settings. Therefore, this laboratory-based study evaluated the efficacy of different combinations of fore-aft (x-axis), lateral (y-axis), and vertical (z-axis) suspensions in reducing WBV exposures. The results showed that the active vertical suspension more effectively reduced the vertical vibration (â¼50%; p'sÂ <Â 0.0001) as compared to the passive vertical suspension (10%; p'sÂ <Â 0.11). The passive fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) suspension systems did not attenuate the corresponding axis vibration (p'sÂ >Â 0.06) and sometimes amplified the floor vibration, especially when the non-vertical vibration was predominant (p'sÂ <Â 0.02). These results indicate that there is a critical need to develop more effective engineering controls including better seat suspensions to address non-vertical WBV exposures, especially because these non-vertical WBV exposures can increase risks for adverse health effects including musculoskeletal loading, discomfort, and impaired visual acuity.

Professional bus and truck drivers are regularly exposed to continuous WBV, since they spend the majority of their working hours driving heavy vehicles. This study measured WBV exposures among professional bus and truck drivers and evaluated the effects of seat-suspension designs using simulated field-collected data on a vibration table. WBV exposures were measured and compared across three different seat designs: an air-ride bus seat, an air-ride truck seat, and an electromagnetically active (EM-active) seat. Air-ride seats use a compressed-air bladder to attenuate vibrations, and they have been in operation throughout the transportation industry for many years. The EM-active seat is a relatively new design that incorporates a microprocessor-controlled actuator to dampen vibration. The vibration table simulated seven WBV exposure scenarios: four segments of vertical vibration and three scenarios that used field-collected driving data on different road surfaces-a city street, a freeway, and a section of rough roadway. The field scenarios used tri-axial WBV data that had been collected at the seat pan and at the driver's sternum, in accordance with ISO 2631-1 and 2631-5. This study found that WBV was significantly greater in the vertical direction (z-axis) than in the lateral directions (x-and y-axes) for each of the three road types and each of the three types of seats. Quantitative comparisons of the results showed that the floor-to-seat-pan transmissibility was significantly lower for the EM-active seat than for either the air-ride bus seat or the air-ride truck seat, across all three road types. This study also demonstrated that seat-suspension designs have a significant effect on the vibrations transmitted to vehicle operators, and the study's results may prove useful in designing future seat suspensions.\n\nThe Influence of End-Stop Buffer Characteristics on the Severity of Suspension Seat End-Stop Impacts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, X.; Griffin, M. J.\n\n1998-08-01\n\nSuspension seat end-stop impacts may be a source of increased risk of injury for the drivers of some machines and work vehicles, such as off-road vehicles. Most suspension seats use rubber buffers to reduce the severity of end-stop impacts, but they still result in a high magnitude of acceleration being transmitted to drivers when an end-stop impact occurs. An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effect of buffer stiffness and buffer damping on the severity of end-stop impacts. The results show that the end-stop impact performance of suspension seats with only bottom buffers can be improved by the use of both top and bottom buffers. The force-deflection characteristics of rubber buffers had a significant influence on the severity of end-stop impacts. The optimum buffer should have medium stiffness which is nearly linear and occurs over a long deflection, without being compressed to its high stiffness stage. It is shown, theoretically, that buffer damping is capable of significantly reducing the severity of end-stop impacts. However, since current rubber material provides only low damping, alternative materials to those in current use, or either passive or active damping devices, are required.\n\nSeat belt use-inducing system effectiveness\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1975-04-01\n\nSeat belt use inducing system effectiveness was measured in fleet automobiles of a private business and in rental automobiles at a large airport.

This induces high levels of physical stress, which may inhibit cognitive performance during military operations and life-saving activities. Land-based research suggests that suspension seats reduce vibration and, therefore, stress. We hypothesized that subjects using suspension seats would demonstrate better cognitive performance, lower perceptions of exertion, fatigue, and sleepiness, and lower salivary concentrations of cortisol than those using fixed seats. Subjects, naval personnel, were divided into fixed (N = 6) and suspension seat (N = 6) groups. Subjects undertook forward and backward number recall and random number generation tests pre- and post-transit (3 h in sea states 2-3). Salivary cortisol concentrations were sampled pre- (1100 h) and post-transit (1700 h) and at the same times on a control day. Post-transit perceptions of exertion, fatigue, and sleepiness were measured subjectively. The suspension seat group demonstrated better performance post-transit than the fixed seat group for forward number recall and showed a significant pre- to post-transit improvement in backward number recall. The suspension seat group reported less fatigue and sleepiness. The suspension seat group had significantly higher salivary cortisol concentrations than the fixed seat group post-transit. Regression analyses found a quadratic correlation between delta cortisol concentrations and delta random number generation scores (R2 = 0.68). Results show that the use of suspension seats during transit in high-speed marine craft may be advantageous with regard to cognitive performance.\n\nVideo monitoring system for car seat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElrod, Susan Vinz (Inventor); Dabney, Richard W. (Inventor)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA video monitoring system for use with a child car seat has video camera(s) mounted in the car seat. The video images are wirelessly transmitted to a remote receiver/display encased in a portable housing that can be removably mounted in the vehicle in which the car seat is installed.\n\nComparative analysis of the operation efficiency of the continuous and relay control systems of a multi-axle wheeled vehicle suspension\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhileykin, M. M.; Kotiev, G. O.; Nagatsev, M. V.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn order to improve the efficiency of the multi-axle wheeled vehicles (MWV) automotive engineers are increasing their cruising speed. One of the promising ways to improve ride comfort of the MWV is the development of the dynamic active suspension systems and control laws for such systems. Here, by the dynamic control systems we mean the systems operating in real time mode and using current (instantaneous) values of the state variables. The aim of the work is to develop the MWV suspension optimal control laws that would reduce vibrations on the driverâs seat at kinematic excitation. The authors have developed the optimal control laws for damping the oscillations of the MWV body. The developed laws allow reduction of the vibrations on the driverâs seat and increase in the maximum speed of the vehicle. The laws are characterized in that they allow generating the control inputs in real time mode. The authors have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed control laws by means of mathematical simulation of the MWV driving over unpaved road with kinematic excitation. The proposed optimal control laws can be used in the MWV suspension control systems with magnetorheological shock absorbers or controlled hydropneumatic springs. Further evolution of the research line can be the development of the energy-efficient MWV suspension control systems with continuous control input on the vehicle body.\n\nEntertainment and Pacification System For Car Seat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElrod, Susan Vinz (Inventor); Dabney, Richard W. (Inventor)\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAn entertainment and pacification system for use with a child car seat has speakers mounted in the child car seat with a plurality of audio sources and an anti-noise audio system coupled to the child car seat. A controllable switching system provides for, at any given time, the selective activation of i) one of the audio sources such that the audio signal generated thereby is coupled to one or more of the speakers, and ii) the anti-noise audio system such that an ambient-noise-canceling audio signal generated thereby is coupled to one or more of the speakers. The controllable switching system can receive commands generated at one of first controls located at the child car seat and second controls located remotely with respect to the child car seat with commands generated by the second controls overriding commands generated by the first controls.\n\nA comparison of optimal semi-active suspension systems regarding vehicle ride comfort\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoulocheris, Dimitrios; Papaioannou, Georgios; Chrysos, Emmanouil\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe aim of this work is to present a comparison of the main semi active suspension systems used in a passenger car, after having optimized the suspension systems of the vehicle model in respect with ride comfort and road holding. Thus, a half car model, equipped with controllable dampers, along with a seat and a driver was implemented. Semi-active suspensions have received a lot of attention since they seem to provide the best compromise between cost (energy consumption, actuators/sensors hardware) and performance in comparison with active and passive suspensions. In this work, the semi active suspension systems studied are comfort oriented and consist of (a) the two version of Skyhook control (two states skyhook and skyhook linear approximation damper), (b) the acceleration driven damper (ADD), (c) the power driven damper (PDD), (d) the combination of Skyhook and ADD (Mixed Skyhook-ADD) and (e) the combination of the two with the use of a sensor. The half car model equipped with the above suspension systems was excited by a road bump, and was optimized using genetic algorithms (GA) in respect with ride comfort and road holding. This study aims to highlight how the optimization of the vehicle model could lead to the best compromise between ride comfort and road holding, overcoming their well-known trade-off. The optimum results were compared with important performance metrics regarding the vehicleâs dynamic behaviour in general.\n\nCushion System for Multi-Use Child Safety Seat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDabney, Richard W.

S.; GRIFFIN, M. J.\n\n2002-05-01\n\nThe vibration isolation efficiency of seating has been evaluated in 100 work vehicles in 14 categories (cars, vans, lift trucks, lorries, tractors, buses, dumpers, excavators, helicopters, armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, grass rollers, mowers and milk floats). Seat isolation efficiency, expressed by the SEAT value, was determined for all seats (67 conventional seats and 33 suspension seats) from the vertical acceleration measured on the floors and on the seats of the vehicles.For most categories of vehicle, the average SEAT value was less than 100%, indicating that the average seat provided some attenuation of vibration. However, there were large variations in SEAT values between vehicles within categories. Two alternative vibration frequency weightings (Wb from BS 6841, 1987; Wk from ISO 2631, 1997) yielded SEAT values that differed by less than 6%. Overall, the SEAT values determined by two alternative methods (the ratio of r.m.s. values and the ratio of vibration dose values) differed by less than 4Â·5% when using weighting Wb, although larger differences may be expected in some situations. The median SEAT value for the suspension seats was 84Â·6%; the median SEAT value for the conventional seats was 86Â·9% (based on weighting Wb and the ratio of r.m.s. values).Predicted SEAT values were obtained assuming that each seat could be interchanged between vehicles without altering its transmissibility. The calculations suggest that 94% of the vehicles investigated might benefit from changing the current seat to a seat from one of the other vehicles investigated. Although the predictions are based on assumptions that will not always apply, it is concluded that the severity of whole-body vibration exposures in many work environments can be lessened by improvements to seating dynamics.\n\nHealth Monitoring System for Car Seat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElrod, Susan Vinz (Inventor); Dabney, Richard W. (Inventor)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA health monitoring system for use with a child car seat has sensors mounted in the seat to monitor one or more health conditions of the seat's occupant. A processor monitors the sensor's signals and generates status signals related to the monitored conditions. A transmitter wireless transmits the status signals to a remotely located receiver. A signaling device coupled to the receiver produces at least one sensory (e.g., visual, audible, tactile) output based on the status signals.\n\nEnergy Absorbing Seat System for an Agricultural Aircraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKellas, Sotiris; Jones, Lisa E. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA task was initiated to improve the energy absorption capability of an existing aircraft seat through cost-effective retrofitting, while keeping seat-weight increase to a minimum. This task was undertaken as an extension of NASA ongoing safety research and commitment to general aviation customer needs. Only vertical crash scenarios have been considered in this task which required the energy absorbing system to protect the seat occupant in a range of crash speeds up to 31 ft/sec. It was anticipated that, the forward and/or side crash accelerations could be attenuated with the aid of airbags, the technology of which is currently available in automobiles and military helicopters. Steps which were followed include, preliminary crush load determination, conceptual design of cost effective energy absorbers, fabrication and testing (static and dynamic) of energy absorbers, system analysis, design and fabrication of dummy seat/rail assembly, dynamic testing of dummy seat/rail assembly, and finally, testing of actual modified seat system with a dummy occupant. A total of ten full scale tests have been performed including three of the actual aircraft seat. Results from full-scale tests indicated that occupant loads were attenuated successfully to survivable levels.\n\nNumerical assessment of fore-and-aft suspension performance to reduce whole-body vibration of wheel loader drivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFleury, GÃ©rard; Mistrot, Pierre\n\n2006-12-01\n\nWhile driving off-road vehicles, operators are exposed to whole-body vibration acting in the fore-and-aft direction. Seat manufacturers supply products equipped with fore-and-aft suspension but only a few studies report on their performance. This work proposes a computational approach to design fore-and-aft suspensions for wheel loader seats. Field tests were conducted in a quarry to analyse the nature of vibration to which the driver was exposed. Typical input signals were recorded to be reproduced in the laboratory. Technical specifications are defined for the suspension. In order to evaluate the suspension vibration attenuation performance, a model of a sitting human body was developed and coupled to a seat model. The seat model combines the models of each suspension component. A linear two-degree-of-freedom model is used to describe the dynamic behaviour of the sitting driver. Model parameters are identified by fitting the computed apparent mass frequency response functions to the measured values. Model extensions are proposed to investigate postural effects involving variations in hands and feet positions and interaction of the driver's back with the backrest. Suspension design parameters are firstly optimized by computing the seat/man model response to sinusoidal acceleration. Four criteria including transmissibility, interaction force between the driver's back and the backrest and relative maximal displacement of the suspension are computed. A new suspension design with optimized features is proposed. Its performance is checked from calculations of the response of the seat/man model subjected to acceleration measured on the wheel loader during real work conditions. On the basis of the computed values of the SEAT factors, it is found possible to design a suspension that would increase the attenuation provided by the seat by a factor of two.\n\nThe application of SEAT values for predicting how compliant seats with backrests influence vibration discomfort.\n\nPubMed\n\nBasri, Bazil; Griffin, Michael J\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe extent to which a seat can provide useful attenuation of vehicle vibration depends on three factors: the characteristics of the vehicle motion, the vibration transmissibility of the seat, and the sensitivity of the body to vibration. The 'seat effective amplitude transmissibility' (i.e., SEAT value) reflects how these three factors vary with the frequency and the direction of vibration so as to predict the vibration isolation efficiency of a seat. The SEAT value is mostly used to select seat cushions or seat suspensions based on the transmission of vertical vibration to the principal supporting surface of a seat. This study investigated the accuracy of SEAT values in predicting how seats with backrests influence the discomfort caused by multiple-input vibration. Twelve male subjects participated in a four-part experiment to determine equivalent comfort contours, the relative discomfort, the location of discomfort, and seat transmissibility with three foam seats and a rigid reference seat at 14 frequencies of vibration in the range 1-20Â Hz at magnitudes of vibration from 0.2 to 1.6Â ms(-2)Â r.m.s. The 'measured seat dynamic discomfort' (MSDD) was calculated for each foam seat from the ratio of the vibration acceleration required to cause similar discomfort with the foam seat and with the rigid reference seat. Using the frequency weightings in current standards, the SEAT values of each seat were calculated from the ratio of overall ride values with the foam seat to the overall ride values with the rigid reference seat, and compared to the corresponding MSDD at each frequency. The SEAT values provided good predictions of how the foam seats increased vibration discomfort at frequencies around the 4-Hz resonance but reduced vibration discomfort at frequencies greater than about 6.3Â Hz, with discrepancies explained by a known limitation of the frequency weightings.

In order to realize this condition, the occupant's seat belt tension must be instantaneously adjusted by a feedback control system. In this study, a seat belt tension control system based on the active shock control system is proposed. The semi-active control law used is derived from the sliding mode control method. One advantage of this proposed system is that it does not require a large power actuator because the seat belt tension is controlled by a brake mechanism. The effectiveness is confirmed by numerical simulation using general parameters of a human thorax and a passenger car in a collision scenario with a wall at a velocity of 100 km/h. The feasibility is then confirmed with a control experiment using a scale model of about 1/10 scale. The relative displacement of the thorax model approaches the allowable value smoothly along the control reference and settles near this value. Thus, the proposed seat belt tension control system design is established.\n\nCEV Seat Attenuation System System Design Tasks\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGoodman, Jerry R.; McMichael, James H.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Apollo crew / couch restraint system was designed to support and restrain three crew members during all phases of the mission from launch to landing. The crew couch used supported the crew for launch, landing and in-flight operations, and was foldable and removable for EVA ingress/egress through side hatch access and for in-flight access under the seat and in other areas of the crew compartment. The couch and the seat attenuation system was designed to control the impact loads imposed on the crew during landing and to remain non-functional during all other flight phases.\n\nSystem for controlling child safety seat environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElrod, Susan V.

A low cost static crashworthiness test procedure that simulates a frontal impact motor vehicle crash. Safety testing laboratory. Eleven unique sets of drop-hook hardware made of carbon steel (4), stainless steel (4), and aluminum (3). Replicated seat-loading conditions associated with a 20g/48 kph frontal impact. Test criterion for seat loading was 16,680 N (3750 lb). Failure load and deflection of seat surface. None of the hardware sets tested met the crashworthiness test criterion. All failed at less than 50% of the load that seating hardware could be exposed to in a 20g/48 kph frontal impact. The primary failure mode was excessive deformation, leading to an unstable seat support surface. Results suggest that commercially available seating drop hooks may be unable to withstand loading associated with a frontal crash and may not be the best option for use with transport wheelchairs.\n\nThe effect of a multi-axis suspension on whole body vibration exposures and physical stress in the neck and low back in agricultural tractor applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Jeong Ho; Dennerlein, Jack T; Johnson, Peter W\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWhole body vibration (WBV) exposures are often predominant in the fore-aft (x) or lateral (y) axis among off-road agricultural vehicles. However, as the current industry standard seats are designed to reduce mainly vertical (z) axis WBV exposures, they may be less effective in reducing drivers' exposure to multi-axial WBV. Therefore, this laboratory-based study aimed to determine the differences between a single-axial (vertical) and multi-axial (verticalÂ +Â lateral) suspension seat in reducing WBV exposures, head acceleration, self-reported discomfort, and muscle activity (electromyography) of the major muscle of the low back, neck and shoulders. The results showed that the multi-axial suspension seat had significantly lower WBV exposures compared to the single-axial suspension seats (p'Â <Â 0.04). Similarly, the multi-axial suspension seat had lower head acceleration and muscle activity of the neck, shoulder, and low back compared to the single-axial suspension seat; some but not all of the differences were statistically significant. These results indicate that the multi-axial suspension seat may reduce the lateral WBV exposures and associated muscular loading in the neck and low back in agricultural vehicle operators.

This objective was carried out using the newly developed Tool for Assessing Wheelchair disComfort (TAWC) as the primary outcome measure. Two wheelchair users each tested two different designs and feedback from the wheelchair users regarding the first design was used to guide development of the second design. A single-subject research methodology was used, allowing long-duration (up to 2 wks per test) evaluation of the wheelchair seating systems and comparison of subject discomfort levels with those experienced during a baseline period using their own wheelchairs. The experimental wheelchair seating systems employed existing automotive seating with embedded pneumatic bladders that allowed adjustment of the seat and back-support characteristics. The test wheelchair also had tilt, recline, and elevating leg rests. The two subjects completed limited periods of testing with the first design, both finding poor results with either stable or increased levels of discomfort. Subject feedback was used to redesign the wheelchair seat. After redesign, both subjects tested the second design and found it substantially more comfortable. The selected research methodology was a very positive method for a progressive wheelchair seating design and the second design provided improved comfort for both users when compared with that experienced using their own wheelchairs and the first test wheelchair. Future research of this type of user-controlled technology is recommended.\n\nMeasurement and modelling of x-direction apparent mass of the seated human body-cushioned seat system.\n\nPubMed\n\nStein, George Juraj; MÃºcka, Peter; ChmÃºrny, Rudolf; Hinz, Barbara; BlÃ¼thner, Ralph\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFor modelling purposes and for evaluation of driver's seat performance in the vertical direction various mechano-mathematical models of the seated human body have been developed and standardized by the ISO. No such models exist hitherto for human body sitting in an upright position in a cushioned seat upper part, used in industrial environment, where the fore-and-aft vibrations play an important role. The interaction with the steering wheel has to be taken into consideration, as well as, the position of the human body upper torso with respect to the cushioned seat back as observed in real driving conditions. This complex problem has to be simplified first to arrive at manageable simpler models, which still reflect the main problem features. In a laboratory study accelerations and forces in x-direction were measured at the seat base during whole-body vibration in the fore-and-aft direction (random signal in the frequency range between 0.3 and 30 Hz, vibration magnitudes 0.28, 0.96, and 2.03 ms(-2) unweighted rms). Thirteen male subjects with body masses between 62.2 and 103.6 kg were chosen for the tests. They sat on a cushioned driver seat with hands on a support and backrest contact in the lumbar region only. Based on these laboratory measurements a linear model of the system-seated human body and cushioned seat in the fore-and-aft direction has been developed. The model accounts for the reaction from the steering wheel. Model parameters have been identified for each subject-measured apparent mass values (modulus and phase). The developed model structure and the averaged parameters can be used for further bio-dynamical research in this field.\n\n49 CFR 570.61 - Suspension system.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-10-01\n\n... 49 Transportation 6 2012-10-01 2012-10-01 false Suspension system. 570.61 Section 570.61 Transportation Other Regulations Relating to Transportation (Continued) NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY... 10,000 Pounds Â§ 570.61 Suspension system.

Currently, the process of ride comfort evaluation is subjective. Alternatively, the ride comfort can be evaluated by a series of objective metrics in the dynamic response of the occupant. From previous studies it is well known that the dynamic behavior of a seat-occupant system is greatly affected by soft nonlinear viscoelastic materials used in the seat cushion. Therefore, in this research, especial attention was given to efficiently modeling the behavior of seat cushion. In the first part of this research, a phenomenological nonlinear viscoelastic foam model was proposed and its ability to capture uniaxial behavior of foam was investigated. The model is based on the assumption that the total stress can be decomposed into the sum of a nonlinear elastic component, modeled by a higher order polynomial of strain, and a nonlinear hereditary type viscoelastic component. System identification procedures were developed to estimate the model parameters using uniaxial cyclic compression data from experiments conducted at different rates on two types of low density polyurethane foams and three types of high density CONFOR foams. The performance of the proposed model was compared to that of other traditional continuum models. For each foam type, it was observed that lower order models are sufficient to describe the uniaxial behavior of the foam compressed at different rates. Although, the estimated model parameters were functions of the input strain rate. Alternatively, higher order comprehensive models, with strain independent parameters, were estimated as well. The estimated comprehensive model predicts foam responses under different compression rates. Also, a methodology was proposed to predict the stress-response of a layered foam system using the estimated models of each foam in the layers. Next, the estimated foam model was incorporated into a single\n\nMagnetic suspension and balance systems (MSBSs)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBritcher, Colin P.; Kilgore, Robert A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe problems of wind tunnel testing are outlined, with attention given to the problems caused by mechanical support systems, such as support interference, dynamic-testing restrictions, and low productivity. The basic principles of magnetic suspension are highlighted, along with the history of magnetic suspension and balance systems. Roll control, size limitations, high angle of attack, reliability, position sensing, and calibration are discussed among the problems and limitations of the existing magnetic suspension and balance systems. Examples of the existing systems are presented, and design studies for future systems are outlined. Problems specific to large-scale magnetic suspension and balance systems, such as high model loads, requirements for high-power electromagnets, high-capacity power supplies, highly sophisticated control systems and position sensors, and high costs are assessed.\n\nEffectiveness of Ford's belt reminder system in increasing seat belt use\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilliams, A; Wells, J; Farmer, C\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjectives: The study investigated the effectiveness in increasing seat belt use of Ford's belt reminder system, a supplementary system that provides intermittent flashing lights and chimes for five minutes if drivers are not belted. Methods: Seat belt use of drivers in relatively new cars with and without the reminder system was unobtrusively observed as vehicles were brought to dealerships for service. Results: Overall use rates were estimated at 71% for drivers in vehicles without the reminder system and 76% for drivers in vehicles with belt reminders (p<0.01). Conclusions: Seat belt use is relatively low in the United States. The present study showed that vehicle based reminder systems can be at least modestly effective in increasing belt use, which may encourage further development of such systems.

Due to the atrophied state of these astronauts, a special seating system must be designed for their transportation. The main functions of this seating system are to support and restrain the astronauts during normal reentry flight and to dampen some of the loading that might occur in a crash situation. Through research, the design team developed many concept variants for these functional requirements. By evaluating each variant, the concepts were eliminated until the four most attractive designs remained. The team used a decision matrix to determine the best concept to carry through embodiment. This concept involved using struts for support during reentry flight and a spring damper/shock absorber system to dampen crash landing loads. The embodiment design process consisted of defining the layout of each of the main functional components, specifically, the seat structure and the strut structure. Through the use of MCS/pal two, the design was refined until it could handle all required loads and dampen to the forces specified. The auxiliary function carriers were then considered. Following the design of these components, the complete final layout could be determined. It is concluded that the final design meets all specifications outlined in the conceptual design. The main advantages of this design are its low weight, simplicity, and large amount of function sharing between different components. The disassembly of this design could potentially present a problem because of time and size constraints involved. Overall, this design meets or exceeds all functional requirements.\n\nModeling the human body/seat system in a vibration environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosen, Jacob; Arcan, Mircea\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe vibration environment is a common man-made artificial surrounding with which humans have a limited tolerance to cope due to their body dynamics. This research studied the dynamic characteristics of a seated human body/seat system in a vibration environment. The main result is a multi degrees of freedom lumped parameter model that synthesizes two basic dynamics: (i) global human dynamics, the apparent mass phenomenon, including a systematic set of the model parameters for simulating various conditions like body posture, backrest, footrest, muscle tension, and vibration directions, and (ii) the local human dynamics, represented by the human pelvis/vibrating seat contact, using a cushioning interface. The model and its selected parameters successfully described the main effects of the apparent mass phenomenon compared to experimental data documented in the literature. The model provided an analytical tool for human body dynamics research. It also enabled a primary tool for seat and cushioning design. The model was further used to develop design guidelines for a composite cushion using the principle of quasi-uniform body/seat contact force distribution. In terms of evenly distributing the contact forces, the best result for the different materials and cushion geometries simulated in the current study was achieved using a two layer shaped geometry cushion built from three materials. Combining the geometry and the mechanical characteristics of a structure under large deformation into a lumped parameter model enables successful analysis of the human/seat interface system and provides practical results for body protection in dynamic environment.\n\nThree-axial evaluation of whole-body vibration in agricultural telehandlers: The effects of an active cab-suspension system.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaffaro, Federica; Preti, Christian; Micheletti Cremasco, Margherita; Cavallo, Eugenio\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAgricultural and earth-moving machinery operators are particularly exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV), which has severe effects on health and affects comfort and performance. Few studies have investigated vibrational safety and comfort issues in telescopic handlers. These vehicles are widespread in many off-road applications-such as construction, agriculture, and mining-used to handle loads and to lift persons and equipment. This study investigated the effects of an active hydro-pneumatic cab-suspension system fitted to a telehandler on a driver's vibration exposure along the x-, y-, and z-axes, through both objective and subjective assessments. Sixteen healthy professional telehandler drivers took part in the study. Objective measurements were acquired at the operator's seat, and subjective ratings were taken while participants drove the telehandler with either a deactivated or activated suspension system at 12 kph on an ISO 5008 smooth track. The results showed that the activation of the cab-suspension system reduced the root-mean-square acceleration along the x- and z-axes (p =.038 and p =.000, respectively). Moreover, the frequency analysis showed a reduction in the acceleration along the z-axis in the range of 2-25Â Hz (p <.05 for all comparisons); in particular, the acceleration was reduced by 50% in the higher frequency range (4-20Â Hz). A reduction in the vibration intensity was perceived by the participants along the y- and z-axes (p =.009 and p =.003, respectively). Implications for the future development of suspension systems are discussed.\n\nVariable temperature seat climate control system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKarunasiri, Tissa R.; Gallup, David F.; Noles, David R.; Gregory, Christian T.\n\n1997-05-06\n\nA temperature climate control system comprises a variable temperature seat, at least one heat pump, at least one heat pump temperature sensor, and a controller.

The Peltier modules and each main fan may be manually adjusted via a control switch or a control signal. Additionally, the temperature climate control system may comprise a number of additional temperature sensors to monitor the temperature of the ambient air surrounding the occupant as well as the temperature of the conditioned air directed to the occupant. The controller is configured to automatically regulate the operation of the Peltier modules and/or each main fan according to a temperature climate control logic designed both to maximize occupant comfort during normal operation, and minimize possible equipment damage, occupant discomfort, or occupant injury in the event of a heat pump malfunction.\n\nAttractive and repulsive magnetic suspension systems overview\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCope, David B.; Fontana, Richard R.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nMagnetic suspension systems can be used in a wide variety of applications.

An increasing number of wheelchair users use their wheelchairs as motor vehicle seats when traveling. A voluntary standard requires that compliant wheelchairs be dynamically sled impact tested. However, testing to evaluate the crashworthiness of add-on wheelchair seating systems (WCSS) independent of their wheelchair frame is not addressed by this standard. To address this need, this study developed a method to evaluate the crash-worthiness of WCSS with independent frames. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 207 test protocols, used to test the strength of motor vehicle seats, were modified and used to test the strength of three WCSS. Forward and rearward loads were applied at the WCSS center of gravity (CGSS), and a moment was applied at the uppermost point of the seat back. Each of the three tested WCSS met the strength requirements of FMVSS 207. Wheelchair seat-back stiffness was also investigated and compared to motor vehicle seat-back stiffness.\n\n49 CFR 393.207 - Suspension systems.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... bar.

V.; Mohan Rao, N.; Siva Kumar, SVR; Priyanka, T. G. L.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis paper deals with introducing MR dampers to the Train Suspension System for improving the ride comfort of the passengers. This type of suspension system comes under Semi-active suspension system which utilizes the properties of MR fluid to damp the vibrations. In case of high speed trains, the coach body is subjected to vibrations due to vertical displacement, yaw and pitch movements. When the body receives these disturbances from the ground,the transmission of vibrations to the passenger increases which affect the ride comfort. In this work, the equations of motion of suspension system are developed for both conventional passive system and semi-active system and are modelled in Matlab/Simulink and analysis has been carried out. The passive suspension system analysis shows that it is taking more time to damp the vibrations and at the same time the transmissibility of vibrations is more.Introducing MR dampers,vertical and angular displacements of the body are computed and compared. The results show that the introduction of MR dampers into the train suspension system improves ride comfort.\n\n49 CFR 571.207 - Standard No. 207; Seating systems.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n... standard establishes requirements for seats, their attachment assemblies, and their installation to... longitudinal direction; (c) For a seat belt assembly attached to the seatâthe force specified in paragraph (a... applied simultaneously with the forces imposed on the seat by the seat belt assembly when it is loaded in...\n\nTranstibial prosthesis suspension systems: systematic review of literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nGholizadeh, H; Abu Osman, N A; Eshraghi, A; Ali, S; Razak, N A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nToday a number of prosthetic suspension systems are available for transtibial amputees. Consideration of an appropriate suspension system can ensure that amputee's functional needs are satisfied. The higher the insight to suspension systems, the easier would be the selection for prosthetists. This review attempted to find scientific evidence pertaining to various transtibial suspension systems to provide selection criteria for clinicians. Databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were explored to find related articles. Search terms were as follows: \"Transtibial prosthesis (32), prosthetic suspension (48), lower limb prosthesis (54), below-knee prosthesis (58), prosthetic liner (20), transtibial (193), and prosthetic socket (111)\". Two reviewers separately examined the papers. Study design (case series of five or more subjects, retrospective or prospective), research instrument, sampling method, outcome measures and protocols were reviewed. Based on the selection criteria, 22 articles (15 prospective studies, and 7 surveys) remained. Sweat control was found to be a major concern with the available suspension liners. Donning and doffing procedures for soft liners are also problematic for some users, particularly those with upper limb weakness. Moreover, the total surface bearing (TSB) socket with pin/lock system is favored by the majority of amputees. In summary, no clinical evidence is available to suggest what kind of suspension system could have an influential effect as a \"standard\" system for all transtibial amputees. However, among various suspension systems for transtibial amputees, the Iceross system was favored by the majority of users in terms of function and comfort. Â© 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hisham Elsherif, Dr, Prof.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe main objective was to develop a smart new vehicle suspension system that minimizes the road irregularities impact on the driver, also to increase performance and stability of the vehicle at high speeds. The central idea is based on modifying the normal passive suspension system into a computer controller hydraulic actuated active suspension system simply by adding a new component such as a hydraulic cylinder on a normal passive system. The new suspension system is economical to be wildly used in consumerâs cars with low prices. The new added components was analytically tested and modeled according to different parameters. A new test rig was implemented to simulate a real quarter suspension system. The new suspension model was controlled by feedback controller according to the road conditions; the controller output controls the cylinder actuator to compensate the road oscillations and increases the vehicle stability for the passenger. Finally, to maximize the aerodynamics coefficients of the vehicle during high speeds by controlling the vehicle clearance level from the ground to achieve full stability, steering and fuel economy.\n\nLumbar load attenuation for rotorcraft occupants using a design methodology for the seat impact energy-absorbing system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoradi, Rasoul; Beheshti, Hamid K.; Lankarani, Hamid M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAircraft occupant crash-safety considerations require a minimum cushion thickness to limit the relative vertical motion of the seat-pelvis during high vertical impact loadings in crash landings or accidents. In military aircraft and helicopter seat design, due to the potential for high vertical accelerations in crash scenarios, the seat system must be provided with an energy absorber to attenuate the acceleration level sustained by the occupants. Because of the limited stroke available for the seat structure, the design of the energy absorber becomes a trade-off problem between minimizing the stroke and maximizing the energy absorption. The available stroke must be used to prevent bottoming out of the seat as well as to absorb maximum impact energy to protect the occupant. In this study, the energy-absorbing system in a rotorcraft seat design is investigated using a mathematical model of the occupant/seat system. Impact theories between interconnected bodies in multibody mechanical systems are utilized to study the impact between the seat pan and the occupant. Experimental responses of the seat system and the occupant are utilized to validate the results from this study for civil and military helicopters according to FAR 23 and 25 and MIL-S-58095 requirements. A model for the load limiter is proposed to minimize the lumbar load for the occupant by minimizing the relative velocity between the seat pan and the occupant's pelvis. The modified energy absorber/load limiter is then implemented for the seat structure so that it absorbs the energy of impact in an effective manner and below the tolerable limit for the occupant in a minimum stroke. Results show that for a designed stroke, the level of occupant lumbar spine injury would be significantly attenuated using this modified energy-absorber system.\n\n75 FR 34172 - Lordstown Seating Systems, a Subsidiary of Magna Seating, Including Workers Whose Unemployment...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-06-16\n\n... certification for workers of the subject firm.

A pressure-sensing system was used to capture biodynamic force at the occupant-seat interface. The results revealed strong effects of visco-elastic and vibration transmissibility characteristics of seats on AM. The response magnitudes with the relatively stiff air seat were generally higher than those with the PUF seats except at low frequencies. The peak magnitude decreased when sitting condition was changed from no back support to a vertical support; the reduction however was more pronounced with the air seat. Further, a relatively higher frequency shift was evident with soft seat compared with stiff elastic seat with increasing excitation. The effects of visco-elastic properties of the body-seat interface on the apparent mass responses of the seated body are measured under vertical vibration. The results show considerable effects of the coupling stiffness on the seated body apparent mass, apart from those of excitation magnitude and back support.\n\nIntelligent systems of the vehiclesâ suspension\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYurlin, D.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe article is devoted to the current condition of carâs active suspension system.

Activity is revealed with a suspension of human erythrocytes sensitized with somatic antigen of Candida albicans, and is quantified on an automated plate reader. The sera were obtained from patients with deep-seated (n = 56) and superficial (n = 193) candidosis. We compared this immunological method with a combination of indirect immunofluorescence and co-immunoelectrodiffusion. The immunocapture method was more sensitive (80.4% vs. 48.2% with indirect immunofluorescence and 58.9% with co-immunoelectrodiffusion), and often provided the diagnosis at an earlier stage, with clear therapeutic advantages. The IgA isotype was a particularly valuable marker of deep-seated Candida infections.\n\n76 FR 31803 - Airworthiness Directives; Koito Industries, Ltd., Seats and Seating Systems Approved Under...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-06-02\n\n... experts in seat design and that testing most likely would be done by the seat manufacturer or at a test... and passengers during emergency landing conditions.

This study was conducted to assess the effect of 4-point seat belts on the risk of thoracic injury in frontal impacts, to evaluate the ability to prevent submarining under the lap belt using 4-point seat belts, and to examine whether 4-point belts may induce injuries not typically observed with 3-point seat belts. The performance of two types of 4-point seat belts was compared with that of a pretensioned, load-limited, 3-point seat belt. A 3-point belt with an extra shoulder belt that \"crisscrossed\" the chest (X4) appeared to add constraint to the torso and increased chest deflection and injury risk. Harness style shoulder belts (V4) loaded the body in a different biomechanical manner than 3-point and X4 belts. The V4 belt appeared to shift load to the clavicles and pelvis and to reduce traction of the shoulder belt across the chest, resulting in a reduction in chest deflection by a factor of two. This is associated with a 5 to 500-fold reduction in thoracic injury risk, depending on whether one assumes 4-point belts apply concentrated or distributed load. In four of six post mortem human subjects restrained by V4 belts during 40 km/h sled tests, chest compression was zero or negative and rib fractures were nearly eliminated. Submarining was not observed in any test with post mortem human subjects. Though lumbar, sacral and pelvic injuries were noted, they are believed to be due to the artificial restraint environment (no knee bolsters, instrument panels, steering systems or airbags). While they show significant potential to reduce thoracic injury risk, there are still many issues to be resolved before 4-point belts can be considered for production vehicles. These issues include, among others, potential effects on hard and soft neck tissues, of interaction with inboard shoulder belts in farside impacts and potential\n\nEffectiveness of Booster Seats Compared With No Restraint or Seat Belt Alone for Crash Injury Prevention\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Xiaoguang; Griffin, Russell; McGwin, Gerald; Allison, David B.; Heymsfield, Steven B.; He, Wei; Zhu, Shankuan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of belt-positioning booster seats, compared with no restraint use and with seat belt use only, during motor vehicle crashes among U.S. children. Methods This was a retrospective matched cohort study with data from the 1998 through 2009 National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS). The study sample consisted of children aged 0 to 10 years who were not seated in the front seat of the vehicle. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of overall, fatal, and regional body injury. Results Children using seat belts in belt-positioning booster seats experienced less overall injury (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 0, adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55 to 0.96; Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score of 2 or higher, adjusted RR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.58; ISS > 8, adjusted RR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.56), and less injury in most body regions except the neck (adjusted RR = 4.79, 95% CI = 1.43 to 16.00) than did children with no restraint use. Children using seat belts in belt-positioning booster seats had an equal risk of injury but higher risks of neck (adjusted RR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.02 to 3.40) and thorax (adjusted RR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.33 to 6.15) injury than did children restrained by seat belts only. Conclusions Children using belt-positioning booster seats appear to experience a higher risk of AIS > 0 injury to the neck and thorax than do children using seat belts only. Future research should examine whether the observed increase in neck and thorax injuries can be attributed to improper use of booster seats.

Suspension efficiency can be best evaluated during one of the vital activities of daily living, i.e. walking. A new magnetic prosthetic suspension system has been developed, but its effects on gait biomechanics have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the effect of suspension type on kinetic and kinematic gait parameters during level walking with the new suspension system as well as two other commonly used systems (the Seal-In and pin/lock). Thirteen persons with transtibial amputation participated in this study. A Vicon motion system (six cameras, two force platforms) was utilized to obtain gait kinetic and kinematic variables, as well as pistoning within the prosthetic socket. The gait deviation index was also calculated based on the kinematic data. The findings indicated significant difference in the pistoning values among the three suspension systems. The Seal-In system resulted in the least pistoning compared with the other two systems. Several kinetic and kinematic variables were also affected by the suspension type. The ground reaction force data showed that lower load was applied to the limb joints with the magnetic suspension system compared with the pin/lock suspension. The gait deviation index showed significant deviation from the normal with all the systems, but the systems did not differ significantly. Main significant effects of the suspension type were seen in the GRF (vertical and fore-aft), knee and ankle angles. The new magnetic suspension system showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters to the other studied systems. This study may have implications on the selection of suspension systems for transtibial prostheses. Trial Registration Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2013061813706N1.

(Inventor)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe invention provides a rough terrain vehicle which maintains a substantially constant weight, and therefore traction, on all wheels, despite one wheel moving considerably higher or lower than the others, while avoiding a very soft spring suspension. The vehicle includes a chassis or body to be supported and a pair of side suspensions at either side of the body. In a six wheel vehicle, each side suspension includes a middle wheel, and front and rear linkages respectively coupling the front and rear wheels to the middle wheel. A body link pivotally connects the front and rear linkages together, with the middle of the body link rising or falling by only a fraction of the rise or fall of any of the three wheels. The body link pivotally supports the middle of the length of the body. A transverse suspension for suspending the end of the body on the side suspensions includes a middle part pivotally connected to the body about a longitudinal axis and opposite ends each pivotally connected to one of the side suspensions along at least a longitudinal axis.\n\nCharacterisation of the human-seat coupling in response to vibration.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Eunyeong; Fard, Mohammad; Kato, Kazuhito\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCharacterising the coupling between the occupant and vehicle seat is necessary to understand the transmission of vehicle seat vibration to the human body. In this study, the vibration characteristics of the human body coupled with a vehicle seat were identified in frequencies up to 100Â Hz. Transmissibilities of three volunteers seated on two different vehicle seats were measured under multi-axial random vibration excitation. The results revealed that the human-seat system vibration was dominated by the human body and foam below 10Â Hz. Major coupling between the human body and the vehicle seat-structure was observed in the frequency range of 10-60Â Hz. There was local coupling of the system dominated by local resonances of seat frame and seat surface above 60Â Hz. Moreover, the transmissibility measured on the seat surface between the human and seat foam is suggested to be a good method of capturing human-seat system resonances rather than that measured on the human body in high frequencies above 10Â Hz.Practitioner Summary: The coupling characteristics of the combined human body and vehicle seat system has not yet been fully understood in frequencies of 0.5-100Â Hz. This study shows the human-seat system has distinctive dynamic coupling characteristics in three different frequency regions: below 10Â Hz, 10-60Â Hz, and above 60Â Hz.\n\nSystem and technique for ultrasonic characterization of settling suspensions\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGreenwood, Margaret S [Richland, WA; Panetta, Paul D [Richland, WA; Bamberger, Judith A [Richland, WA; Pappas, Richard A [Richland, WA\n\n2006-11-28\n\nA system for determining properties of settling suspensions includes a settling container, a mixer, and devices for ultrasonic interrogation transverse to the settling direction. A computer system controls operation of the mixer and the interrogation devices and records the response to the interrogating as a function of settling time, which is then used to determine suspension properties. Attenuation versus settling time for dilute suspensions, such as dilute wood pulp suspension, exhibits a peak at different settling times for suspensions having different properties, and the location of this peak is used as one mechanism for characterizing suspensions. Alternatively or in addition, a plurality of ultrasound receivers are arranged at different angles to a common transmitter to receive scattering responses at a variety of angles during particle settling. Angular differences in scattering as a function of settling time are also used to characterize the suspension.\n\n49 CFR 38.27 - Priority seating signs.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 49 Transportation 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Priority seating signs. 38.27 Section 38.27...

The participants included 8 males (22.3 Â± 2.0 yrs.) and 8 females (23.5 Â± 1.8 yrs.) with no experience operating heavy mobile equipment. Previously recorded 6-DOF chassis acceleration data from a Pot Hauler (a machine which picks up and transports pots of slag) were used to extract six, 20 second representative profiles for implementation on a lab-based heavy machine simulator (6-DOF Parallel Robotics System Corporation robot). Subjects sat on three heavy equipment seats (BeGe7150, Grammar MSG 95G1721, and a 6801 Isringhausen with the seat pan cushion retrofitted with a Skydex cushion) mounted on the simulator. Each subject completed three trials for each combination of seat (n=3) and vibration profile (n=6). Chassis and operator/seat interface vibration were measured by 2, 6-DOF vibration transducers. Variables included Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT) (X,Y,Z,Roll,Pitch,Yaw,6DOF Vector Sum) to determine if the seat was attenuating or amplifying the vibration, 6-degree of freedom (DOF) vibration total value weighted predicted comfort (Avc) (according to ISO 2631-1) and operator reported comfort (ORC). Factorial ANOVAs revealed significant differences (p < or = 0.05) between seats for all SEAT variables but different seats performed better than others depending on the axis. Significant differences between males and females were observed for SEAT in X,Y, and Pitch as well as for Avs. As expected there were significant differences between vibration profiles for all assessed variables. A number of interaction effects were observed, the most frequently occurring of which was between seat and vibration profile. Based upon the number of seat and vibration profile interactions, results suggest that a single seat is not suited for all tested\n\nEffectiveness of child safety seats vs seat belts in reducing risk for death in children in passenger vehicle crashes.\n\nPubMed\n\nElliott, Michael R; Kallan, Michael J; Durbin, Dennis R; Winston, Flaura K\n\n2006-06-01\n\nTo provide an estimate of benefit, if any, of child restraint systems over seat belts alone for children aged from 2 through 6 years.
