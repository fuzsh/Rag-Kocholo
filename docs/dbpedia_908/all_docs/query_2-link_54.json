        "text": "3.2. Methodological considerations\n\nThe method for the estimation of the mean TKE dissipation rate is presented later in this section. The mean dissipation rate is applied here for the estimation of the local turbulent flow microscale as\n\n(3.2)\\begin{equation}{\\tau _K} = {\\left( {\\frac{\\nu }{\\varepsilon }} \\right)^{1/2}},\\end{equation}\n\nwhere ${\\tau _K}$ is the Kolmogorov time scale. Based on this time scale, the Stokes number $S{t_\\kappa } = {\\tau _p}/{\\tau _\\kappa }$ is estimated, using for the particle time scale ${\\tau _p} \\approx {w_s}/[g(s - 1)/s]$, with $s = {\\rho _p}/\\rho $. The resulting depth-averaged values of the Stokes number are $S{t_\\kappa } \\approx 0.5- 0.8$ for dp1 and $S{t_\\kappa } \\approx 2- 3$ for dp3. According to Finn & Li (Reference Finn and Li2016), who recast and developed scaling arguments from Elghobashi (Reference Elghobashi1994) and Balachandar (Reference Balachandar2009), at low concentrations $(c \\le {10^{ - 3}})$, negligible effects of particles on the flow turbulence are expected for $S{t_K} < 1$, whilst a dissipative regime (i.e. as a fluid turbulence damping) occurs with $S{t_K} > 1$, as long as the particle Reynolds number $R{e_p}$ does not exceed the critical value $R{e_p} \\approx 400$ (Elghobashi Reference Elghobashi1994). This seems consistent with the present observations, as will be shown in § 4.2. Since the relative velocity ${u_p} - {u_f}$ cannot be measured, Rep is estimated with the particle settling velocity as $R{e_p} = {d_p}{w_s}/\\nu = 168$ and 19, for dp3 and dp1, respectively. Although the value for the larger particles is one order of magnitude larger than for the smaller particles, the value remains below $R{e_p} \\approx 400$ for enhancement of fluid turbulence via particle-induced vortex shedding.\n\nTo estimate the TKE budget from experimental measurements, different approximation methods are applied for the terms of (3.1). The first is the assumption that the pressure diffusion transport term becomes negligible above a certain distance from the flow bed. Because the measurement accuracy of the mean turbulent particle flux $\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ is questionable in the absence of a two-phase flow–particle velocity measurement ability, this term is replaced by the settling flux ${w_s}\\bar{c}$ (Rouse Reference Rouse1938), which is measured with greater confidence. This is justified by the present steady-state, uniform (in the streamwise direction), SL flow conditions.\n\nIn the absence of the measurement of the transverse velocity v, a common approximation for the turbulent diffusion term in two-dimensional mean flows is $\\overline {{{v^{\\prime}}^2}w^{\\prime}} = 0.5(\\overline {{{u^{\\prime}}^2}w^{\\prime}} + \\overline {{{w^{\\prime}}^3}} )$, as reported by Raupach (Reference Raupach1981). This leads to\n\n(3.3)\\begin{equation}{F_k} = \\overline {kw^{\\prime}} = 3/4(\\overline {{{u^{\\prime}}^2}w^{\\prime}} + \\overline {{{w^{\\prime}}^3}} ),\\end{equation}\n\nwhere Fk is the mean vertical TKE flux. Although not shown herein, a good qualitative and quantitative agreement exists between Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) results of Ikeda & Durbin (Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007), experimental literature results (Nakagawa & Nezu Reference Nakagawa and Nezu1977; Hurther et al. Reference Hurther, Lemmin and Terray2007; Mignot, Hurther & Barthelemy Reference Mignot, Hurther and Barthelemy2009b; Dey & Das 2012) and our measurements. Ikeda & Durbin (Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007, figure 23), found that ${F_k}/u_\\mathrm{\\ast }^3$ was nearly constant and equal to 0.4 for $2 < z/{k_s} < 6$, and it gradually decreased in the outer layer. Such a trend was observed in all previously cited experimental studies and in the present measurements (discussed in § 4.3), confirming the validity of the approximation applied in (3.3).\n\nIn homogeneous turbulence, the mean dissipation rate is determined from Kolmogorov's second hypothesis\n\n(3.4)\\begin{equation}{E_u}({k_u}) = {C_1}{\\epsilon ^{2/3}}k_u^{ - 5/3},\\end{equation}\n\nwhere ${E_u}(u)$ is the one-dimensional energy spectra, ku is the wavenumber and C 1 is a constant with a value of 0.5 (Monin & Yaglom Reference Monin and Yaglom1975; Pope Reference Pope2000). Obtaining ${E_u}({k_u})$ directly from measurements is impossible with a one-dimensional vertical profiling system. Instead, the frequency spectrum ${F_{11}}(f)$, is used after the application of Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis (Townsend Reference Townsend1976) for the estimation of the one-dimensional wavenumber spectra, as\n\n(3.5)\\begin{equation}{E_u}({k_u}) = \\frac{{\\bar{u}}}{{2{{\\rm \\pi} }}}{F_{11}}(f)\\quad \\textrm{with}\\ {\\kappa _u} = \\frac{{2{{\\rm \\pi} }f}}{{\\bar{u}}}.\\end{equation}\n\nThe mean TKE dissipation rate can then be approximated as\n\n(3.6)\\begin{equation}\\varepsilon = \\frac{{2{{\\rm \\pi} }}}{{\\bar{u}}}{\\left( {\\frac{{{F_{11}}(f){f^{5/3}}}}{{{C_1}}}} \\right)^{3/2}}.\\end{equation}\n\nIt should be stressed that the turbulence spectra are not well resolved near the wall for $z/{H_f}< 0.1- 0.15$) due to the limited spatial resolution of ±1.5 mm of the ACVP instrument. As a result, the dissipation rate estimations are subject to underestimations in the inner flow region. Consequences of this lack of resolution on TKE budget estimates is discussed at the end of this section. The turbulence spectra of streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations are presented in figure 2, at a vertical elevation z/Hf = 0.4, for CW and SL flows. As expected, the spectra of longitudinal velocity fluctuations is O(10) larger than for the vertical in the lower frequency band (f < 1 Hz) corresponding to the production frequency range. The longitudinal and vertical velocity spectra display closer values in the frequency range f > 6 Hz. This trend is observed for all hydrodynamic conditions but it is more established for flows with the highest Reynolds number values (column (d)). These spectral trends confirm the anisotropy of the large-scale turbulent eddies associated with TKE production at the low frequencies, and the tendency towards isotropy for the small-scale turbulent flow structures when entering the inertial subranges, as proposed by Kolmogorov's first hypothesis (Bradshaw Reference Bradshaw1971; Tennekes & Lumley Reference Tennekes and Lumley1972). Moreover, the convergence to the −5/3 slope of all spectra is observed systematically, in agreement with Kolmogorov's second hypothesis, except for the flow with the lowest Reynolds number (column a) for which the inertial subrange is not well established and captured by the ACVP for f > 25 Hz. For the studied flows with higher Reynolds numbers, the spectra in the inertial subrange begin at lower frequency, reach higher frequencies (due to the decrease of the Kolmogorov scale with Reynolds number) and have larger magnitudes (due to the increase of TKE dissipation rate with Reynolds number). Although not shown herein, it was observed that the tendency towards isotropy (and the −5/3 slope) can be observed at further distances from the wall. Laufer (Reference Laufer1954) observed the same behaviour in his measurements of turbulence in fully developed pipe flows. This is because the inertial subrange becomes wider with distance above the flow bed, as reported by Nikora & Goring (Reference Nikora and Goring2002). These general trends prevail both in CW and SL flows, as found by Cellino & Graf (Reference Cellino and Graf1999) and Nikora & Goring (Reference Nikora and Goring2002).\n\nFollowing the considerations above, as well as neglecting the viscosity driven transport term (because of its negligible value compared with the diffusion-induced TKE transport term), the TKE budget equation can be simplified as\n\n(3.7)\\begin{equation}I ={-} \\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} \\frac{{\\partial \\bar{u}}}{{\\partial z}} - (s - 1){w_s}\\bar{c}g - \\frac{{\\partial \\overline {kw^{\\prime}} }}{{\\partial z}} - \\varepsilon ,\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the term I represents the imbalance (or residue) in the TKE budget, such that I = 0 if the budget is closed. Several causes can provoke non-negligible values of the imbalance term profile: a non-negligible contribution of the turbulent pressure transport term (because it is not estimated) or measurement uncertainties due to statistical bias or measurement errors associated with a lack of measurement precision. In the following, estimation of measurement uncertainties is provided on the basis of a comparative analysis of our measured TKE budget results to numerical DNS (for CW flow case) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) (for SL flow case) reported in the literature. Figure 3 compares the TKE budget in a rough-wall boundary layer obtained with DNS (figure 3a) by Ikeda & Durbin (Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007) with our CW measurements in figure 3(b) (for run P3S03D10_CW in table 1). Although not shown herein, figure 5 in Yuan & Piomelli (Reference Yuan and Piomelli2014b) is also used for reference DNS estimates of the TKE budget. The latter study includes one smooth-wall case and two (increasing) rough-wall cases. Figure 4 compares the numerical LES of the TKE budget obtained by Cheng et al. (Reference Cheng, Hsu and Chauchat2018) in a SL flow condition with our very similar dp3 SL flow case under a full-capacity condition (run P3S03D10_SAT in table 1).\n\nIn figures 3(b) and 4(b), the imbalance term can be considered as the uncertainty in the TKE budget, as long as the turbulent pressure transport term is negligibly low. The DNS results in figure 4(a) show that, for rough-wall CW flows, the pressure term is indeed negligible above a distance matching the height of the wall-roughness elements (i.e. for z/Hf > 0.05). Same result is also observed in the DNS results of in Yuan & Piomelli (Reference Yuan and Piomelli2014a, figure 5) for two increasingly rough wall-bounded flows. In the present CW flow case, as shown in figure 3(b), turbulent pressure transport can be considered negligible for z/Hf > 0.02. These values are not identical because the relative submergence values in our flow conditions are much larger than for the flow studied in Ikeda & Durbin (Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007). Above the referred height, the imbalance term represents the measurement uncertainty with values below 15 % (of the TKE production) for z/Hf > 0.1 and below 29 % for 0.02 < z/Hf < 0.05. In the latter flow range, the gradual increase of I with proximity to the wall is attributed to the lack of spatial measurement resolution. The limited spatial resolution induces an underestimation of the TKE dissipation rate which increases with proximity to the channel wall. The TKE production and turbulent transport rates are weakly affected by the lack of spatial measurement resolution because they are primarily controlled by turbulent macro-scales in contrast to the TKE dissipation rate that is associated with turbulence micro-scales. The good agreement between the numerical results and the measured TKE production and TKE transport terms confirms that we can better resolve these quantities compared with TKE dissipation.\n\nThe numerical results of Ikeda & Durbin (Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007 in figure 3a) and in Yuan & Piomelli (Reference Yuan and Piomelli2014a, figure 5) show that a TKE production peak and a TKE dissipation peak are found in rough-wall CW flows close to the top of the wall-roughness elements at $z/{k_s} \\approx 1$. Furthermore, the simulated TKE transport term is seen to act as a local energy source term below this level, which corresponds to the interior of the roughness sublayer. In our measured CW case (figure 4b) the peaks in TKE production and dissipation rates and the source of transported TKE are not observed. This is explained by the fact that the height of the bed roughness elements is close to the vertical measurement resolution in our CW flow cases. Consequently, the peaks are not detected in our CW flow cases. However, two clear peaks in TKE production and dissipation rates are observed in our measurements (figure 4b) for the dp3 SL flow cases subject to a thick bedload layer transport. This point is addressed in detail in the results section as a main result of the present study.\n\nAlthough both DNS results discussed above allowed us to verify the key assumptions of the measured TKE budget, a notable difference in the flow structure in figures 3(a) and 3(b) is discernible. The decay in the peaks of the different TKE budget terms occurs significantly faster in the DNS results. We attribute the differences mainly to very distinct relative submergences and potentially the application of rib-type roughness elements in the DNS simulations.\n\nThe good agreement in profile shape and magnitude between all measured and simulated TKE budget terms for the SL flows (see figure 4) further confirms the agreement between mixture-velocity-based measurements and fluid-velocity-based simulations. The small differences observed between measurements and simulations might be attributed to differences between mixture-velocity- and fluid-velocity-based estimates. However, as addressed in the results section below, these differences are significantly smaller than the addressed differences due to bedload layer effects.\n\n4.2 The TKE budget\n\nThe TKE budget is shown in figure 6, from CW in the bottom row to maximum sediment concentration (full capacity) in the upper row. As expected from the previous figure 4, the TKE budgets of all shown steady, subcritical, uniform and highly turbulent boundary layer SL flows are dominated by four terms associated with the rates of production, sediment transport (or sediment density stratification), turbulent transport and viscous dissipation. A discussion of each term is presented in the following.\n\n4.2.1. The TKE production rate\n\nThe production in the SL flows is seen to be reduced in the inner region, with the maximum value having smaller normalized magnitude compared with the reference CW flow, regardless of particle diameter. This is consistent with lower values of mean Reynolds shear stress in the near-bed region for z/Hf < 0.10 for both particle sizes (figures 13(c) and 14(c) in the Appendix). Importantly, for dp3 only, the TKE production peaks at a higher normalized distance from the bed and the mean velocity gradients are also significantly reduced near the bed, contributing to the reduction of TKE production rate seen in figure 6. The signature of the production term is confirmed by the previously presented DNS (Ikeda & Durbin Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007) in CW as well as by the LES results of Cheng et al. (Reference Cheng, Hsu and Chauchat2018) in SL flows. The increase in roughness results not only in the upshift of the peak of TKE production, but also in the reduction of the peak value (Ikeda & Durbin Reference Ikeda and Durbin2007).\n\nThe estimation of the bulk TKE production rate, defined as the depth-integrated TKE production, is found to be reduced in dp3 SL flows compared with their reference CW flows. The attenuation factor, defined as the ratio between CW and SL bulk production rates, in saturated conditions remains in the range of values between 1.1 and 1.3, for all saturated conditions for dp3 and dp1. The observed reduction in near-bed local and bulk TKE production rates for all investigated dp1 and dp3 SL flows supports the establishment of the inertial range dissipation regime defined by Finn & Li (Reference Finn and Li2016) in terms of turbulence–sediment interaction.\n\n4.2.2. The TKE dissipation rate\n\nIt is difficult to quantify accurately the modifications of the TKE dissipation rate in the lower part of the inner flow region due to the above-mentioned measurement resolution limitations. Nevertheless, we can infer some distinct features for z/Hf > 0.10–0.15, where the TKE budget is fairly closed due to the negligible value of the imbalance term I. Above z/Hf = 0.10–0.15, equilibrium between the turbulence production and dissipation rates is found and confirmed by the validity of the logarithmic velocity distribution shown in figure 5. Around the production peak elevation, production exceeds dissipation. The upshift of the production peak for dp3 SL flows seems to be accompanied by a similar peak upshift in the TKE dissipation rate. Therefore, given that the lower part of the inner region is not fully resolved, we cannot infer the trend of (vertically integrated) bulk TKE dissipation rate for dp3.\n\n4.2.3. The TKE transport rate\n\nAs can be seen for all CW and SL flows in figure 6, the transport of TKE is maximal near the peak of TKE production. For all CW flows and dp1 SL flows only, this region of TKE excess is restricted to the lower part of the inner flow region below the equilibrium region. Because for all CW and dp1 SL flows only, the TKE transport is an energy sink (positive sign) over almost the entire measured domain (i.e. for 0.01–0.02 < z/Hf < 0.6) and because the transport terms must be in equilibrium vertically (in a two-dimensional mean flow), the transported TKE must become an energy source in the (non-measured) upper flow region z > 0.6Hf. Furthermore, due to the negligible shear-stress-induced TKE production for z > 0.6 Hf, it can be deduced from the present TKE budget that the transported TKE originating from the inner flow region is primarily dissipated into heat in the upper flow region near the free surface (not shown here). This also holds for the dp1 SL flows because the suspended sediment transport makes a minor contribution for z > 0.6 Hf. This vertical redistribution process of TKE has no importance for sediment transport but it is known to play a leading role for dissolved gas-exchange processes at the air–water interface of highly turbulent free-surface flows (Moog & Jirka Reference Moog and Jirka1999; Nimmo Smith, Thorpe & Graham Reference Nimmo Smith, Thorpe and Graham1999). Note, however, that, in addition to the TKE transport to the upper flow region z > 0.6 Hf, the turbulent diffusion also becomes a source term inside a very narrow region near the wall z/Hf < 0.01, that corresponds to the roughness (canopy) sublayer. This is observed through its positive values near the wall for some CW and dp1 SL flows. We did not capture systematically this change in sign since it occurs in the very narrow roughness sublayer for CW and dp1 SL flow cases, as explained above in the interpretation of figure 3 in § 3.2. These results are in agreement with previous studies (Krogstad & Antonia Reference Krogstad and Antonia1999; Mignot et al. Reference Mignot, Barthelemy and Hurther2009a), where negative values of the TKE diffusion term were noted near the wall only in fully rough turbulent wall-bounded flows. This point will be further developed in the following paragraphs.\n\nA very distinct behaviour of the TKE transport is observed for all large particle dp3 flows compared with their reference CW and all other dp1 SL and reference CW flows. A systematic positive TKE transport (acting as a source of energy) is found in the vicinity of the flow bed for z < 0.1Hf . This region is found to be much larger for the SL dp3 flows compared with all other CW and dp1 SL flows. Similarly to the TKE production term, the region of positive TKE transport term is found to be upshifted in comparison with the corresponding reference CW flows. Above this layer, an equilibrium region is reached as in all other flows (confirming the existence of a log layer) but over a smaller vertical range than the corresponding reference CW and all other dp1 SL flows. This point is in good agreement with the observations in figure 5 (§ 3.2) of a vertically restricted log layer for the dp3 SL flows. The vertical upshift of the (positive) TKE transport region (i.e. the TKE production excess region) appears to be accompanied by the underlying near-wall region of negative value. This source of kinetic energy might increase the TKE dissipation rate (which is difficult to verify here due to the limited measurement resolution mentioned above) or might be at the origin of the sediment density stratification term associated with the transport of sediments. It appears that the vertical height of the near-wall TKE source region roughly matches the thickness of the sediment transport layer as bedload. Furthermore, the TKE involved (in terms of magnitude and associated area below the negative curve) is locally in equilibrium with the magnitude (multiplied by −1) and the area of the sediment stratification term. The LES results from Cheng et al. (Reference Cheng, Hsu and Chauchat2018) in similar flow conditions also show a near equilibrium between the TKE transport term and the drag dissipation term. The latter is the main sediment-related TKE loss term in TKE budget (Hsu, Jenkins & Liu Reference Hsu, Jenkins and Liu2004) in contrast to the stratification term in the mixture velocity formalism of (3.1). This suggests that TKE diffusion could potentially be an important mechanism of energy transfer towards the sediments moving as bedload, a quite unusual aspect for bedload transport modelling. This should be further justified through the discussion on coherent structure dynamics.\n\nThe possibility of a TKE diffusion term acting as a local energy source in the near-wall region has already been shown in the literature for rough-wall boundary layer flows. Krogstad & Antonia (Reference Krogstad and Antonia1999) measured a TKE transport term of the same sign as the TKE production term for their rough-wall flow case up to a region of approximately 0.18Hf. Similar trends were confirmed by DNS simulations in Miyake, Tsujimoto & Nakaji (Reference Miyake, Tsujimoto and Nakaji2001) and by measurements in Mignot et al. (Reference Mignot, Barthelemy and Hurther2009a, figure 9) for open-channel flows over a gravel bed. The thickness of this energy source layer was found to be determined by the elevation of the bed roughness elements. For all these rough-wall CW flow studies, the presence of a near-wall transport-induced TKE source was accompanied by an upshift of the peak TKE production position, which seems to induce the downward directed transport of TKE. The present results support these observations, as for all CW flows the diffusive TKE transport term is negative in a thin near-wall region, with its maximum (positive) values at the same vertical elevation as the TKE production peak. For the dp3 SL flows, it seems that the large bedload layer has a similar effect on the TKE production and transport terms, which suggests that the bedload layer has the same effect on the near-wall TKE budget as the increase of wall roughness in CW flows. The dp1 SL flows display the same trend as their respective CW flows, suggesting that the roughness sublayer remains unaffected by the presence of the dp1 bedload layer. This aspect will be further discussed in the following sections.\n\n4.2.4. Sediment transport-induced density stratification\n\nSediment transport is classified into two modes of transport and corresponding layers of transport known as the bedload and suspension layers. In the suspension layer, the sediment-induced stratification term increases locally with mean suspended sediment concentration, hence it remains relatively small (usually below O(10−3) in volumetric concentration) in the outer flow region due its exponential decay with z following the well-known Rouse profile. It can be seen in figure 7 that sediment stratification increases significantly in the near-bed flow region, particularly for dp3 experiments, where it coincides with the bedload transport layer for all dp3 SL flows. The sharp increase in the sediment stratification term is not seen for the dp1 SL flows, which can be explained by the much lower suspension number values ${w_s}/{u_\\mathrm{\\ast }}$ indicating a fully suspension-dominated sediment transport driven by turbulent mixing. Given the greater proportion of bedload transport for dp3 SL flows, high concentrations well above 8 % are reached in the bedload layer compared with all dp1 SL flows. The fraction of TKE spent by the flow to carry sediment in suspension can be estimated by the magnitude of the flux Richardson number as\n\n(4.2)\\begin{equation}Ri = g(s - 1)\\frac{{{w_s}\\bar{c}}}{{ - u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}\\,\\textrm{d}\\bar{u}/\\textrm{d}z}} ={-} g(s - 1) \\frac{{{\\epsilon _s}}}{{{\\epsilon _{ms}}}} \\frac{{ \\textrm{d}\\bar{c}/\\textrm{d}z}}{{{{(\\textrm{d}\\bar{u}/\\textrm{d}z)}^2}}},\\end{equation}\n\nwhere ${\\epsilon _s}$ and ${\\epsilon _{ms}}$ are the sediment and turbulent momentum diffusivities, respectively. Note that, for the same forcing condition, ${w_s}\\bar{c}$ will be larger for higher values of ${w_s}/{u_\\mathrm{\\ast }}$ (bedload proportion, and therefore the local concentration in the inner layer increases with ${w_s}/{u_\\mathrm{\\ast }}$). Consequently, $Ri$ will be higher and the stratification effects on flow turbulence will be more pronounced. This point will be further discussed in the next paragraph by comparing the SL flows with the same hydrodynamic conditions but with different particle diameters.\n\nFigure 7 represents the vertical profiles of the flux Richardson numbers for two full-capacity dp1 and dp3 SL flows under the same flow condition (S10 for dp1 and S03 for dp3). It can be seen that the $Ri$ value of dp1 is larger than dp3 in the suspension layer, but it remains generally well below the critical value of $Ri < 0.2$ excluding flow stratification effects. On the other hand, for dp3, $Ri > 0.2$ in the bedload layer, which suggests significant stratification-induced damping of flow turbulence. Therefore, differently from dp3, the stratification term for dp1 does not represent a significant local TKE loss even in the near-bed region. This strongly supports the nearly unchanged signature of the production and diffusion terms for all dp1 SL flows compared with their reference CW flows. Furthermore, the energy excess region (where production exceeds slightly dissipation) in saturated dp1 flows is seen to occur at the same level (just above the bed) as in its reference CW flow. This suggests that the roughness sublayer is still dominated by the wall roughness rather than the bedload layer thickness in the dp1 SL flow cases. This aspect will be analysed in the following on the basis of coherent flow structure dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion of this section on the TKE budget, the present measurements reveal strong persistent modification in the signature of the diffusive TKE transport term, from CW to SL flows in dp3 experiments. This is highlighted in figure 8, by comparing flows with same hydrodynamic conditions but with different particle diameters. We display the results for repeated runs to show the high degree of repeatability (differences below 20 %) of the measured TKE budget. The profiles of normalized streamwise velocity (by the depth-averaged value U) and concentration (by the maximum concentration) are also shown. Note that the two CW production terms converge towards a similar (absolute) value near the bed, supporting identical hydrodynamic forcing for both flows. For dp3, the stratification term near the wall is relatively high, reaching around 50 % of the local production, as indicated by the value of the local flux Richardson number ($Ri \\approx 0.5$, in figure 7). Since the dissipation rate has a similar magnitude as the production term, the energy loss via the stratification term cannot be explained by the local production. The balance appears to originate primarily through the TKE transport terms, which becomes a local source of TKE. This is supported by the similar magnitudes and profile shapes of the TKE transport and the sediment density stratification terms in figure 8(b). Hence, the TKE transported by turbulent diffusion from the upshifted height of peak TKE production towards the near-bed region could play an important role in the transport of particles as bedload.\n\n4.3 Coherent flow structure dynamics\n\nThe present section is devoted to the analysis of coherent flow structures and their dynamics in relation to the TKE budget properties observed for dp1, dp3 SL flows and their respective reference CW flows. For this purpose, conditional statistics of the Reynolds shear stress −ρ u′w′ will be quantified by the application of the so-called quadrant threshold method (Lu & Willmarth Reference Lu and Willmarth1973; Nakagawa & Nezu Reference Nakagawa and Nezu1977; Raupach Reference Raupach1981). This conditional sampling technique allows to evaluate the decomposition of the mean velocity co-variance $\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ at a given vertical position, into contributions from instantaneous $u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ events oriented along the four quadrants constituting the $(u^{\\prime},w^{\\prime})$ plane and having a magnitude larger than $H\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $; H is called the threshold level. The four quadrants events are defined as: outward interactions ${Q_1}(u^{\\prime} > 0,w^{\\prime} > 0)$, ejections ${Q_2}(u^{\\prime}< 0,\\ w^{\\prime}> 0)$, inward interactions ${Q_3}(u^{\\prime} < 0,w^{\\prime}0)$ and sweeps ${Q_4}(u^{\\prime} > 0,w^{\\prime} < 0)$. The instantaneous $u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ events with magnitude strictly smaller than $H\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ are referred to as hole events. The u′w′ events in a given quadrant Q and of magnitude larger than $H\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ can be estimated (and averaged) as\n\n(4.3)\\begin{equation}{\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} _{Q,H}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}{I_{Q,H}}(t)\\,\\textrm{d}t} ,\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the subscripts Q and H refer to the quadrant index and the value of the threshold level H, respectively; T is duration over which the conditionally sampled $u^{\\prime}{w^{\\prime}_H}$ is averaged and ${I_{Q,H}}$ is the u′w′ sampling function, given by\n\n(4.4) \\begin{equation}{I_{Q,H}}(t) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{@{}l}} { 1\\quad \\textrm{if}\\ u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}\\ \\textrm{is}\\ \\textrm{in}\\ \\textrm{quadrant}\\ Q\\ \\textrm{and}\\ |u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}|> H{u_{rms}}{w_{rms}}}\\\\ {0\\quad \\textrm{otherwise}} \\end{array}} \\right..\\end{equation}\n\nThe relative contribution to the mean Reynolds shear stress $\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ of u′w′ events in each quadrant Q and of magnitude larger than $H\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ is given by the ratio\n\n(4.5)\\begin{equation}R{S_Q} = \\frac{{{{\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} }_{Q,H}}}}{{\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} }}.\\end{equation}\n\nIn the present study, the quadrant analysis is not only applied to analyse the dynamics of Reynolds shear stress $u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ in SL flows, but also extended to the TKE flux $kw^{\\prime}$ and vertical particle flux $c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$. For this purpose, the detection function in (4.4) is not modified since we are interested in observing how selected $u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ shear-stress events contribute to the mean TKE flux $kw^{\\prime}$ and to the mean vertical turbulent particle flux $c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$.\n\nFigure 9 represents the profiles of mean vertical TKE flux ${F_k} = \\overline {kw^{\\prime}} $ and the profiles of the parameter RS 4/RS 2, for a threshold value H = 0. This parameter as the ratio of sweep over ejection contributions has been studied in great detail in the literature on CW boundary layer and open-channel flows (Nezu & Nakagawa Reference Nezu and Nakagawa1993). For the SL flows studied herein, figure 12 reveals an almost perfect match between the positions of Fk = 0 and RS 4/RS 2 = 1, both in CW and all dp1 and dp3 SL flows. This strongly supports that the coherent flow structures governing the shear-stress parameter RS 4/RS 2 are the ones governing the vertical transport of TKE. In particular, the dominance of sweep events in the near-bed region where RS 4/RS 2 > 1 is responsible of the downward transport of TKE (Fk < 0). This is in good agreement with results found by Raupach (Reference Raupach1981) and Krogstad, Antonia & Browne (Reference Krogstad, Antonia and Browne1992) in rough-wall boundary layer flows, by Hurther et al. (Reference Hurther, Lemmin and Terray2007) in hydraulically rough CW open-channel flows and by DNS simulations of Yuan & Piomelli (Reference Yuan and Piomelli2014b). The dominance of ejection-type shear-stress events in the region delimited by RS 4/RS 2 < 1, is responsible for the transport TKE upwards (Fk > 0). Raupach (Reference Raupach1981) provided quantitative evidence of the governing role played by ejection- and sweep-type coherent flow structures in the transport of TKE. This is also confirmed here for all investigated SL flows.\n\nIt can further be seen in figure 9 that, only for dp3 SL flows, the level corresponding to the upper limit of the sweep-dominated region is systematically upshifted with increasing concentration while maintaining a good agreement between the positions where Fk = 0 and RS 4/RS 2 = 1. This result is consistent with the significant upshift of the peaks in TKE production and dissipation rates for dp3 flow cases. Hence, in the presence of a thick bedload layer, there is an increased dominance of sweep events, which transports TKE downwards into the bedload layer. Interestingly, the change of signature in presence of sediment is barely noticeable for dp1. This supports that the presence of a bedload layer larger than the sweep-dominated layer for the same CW condition is the cause of the modified signature, for dp3. This suggests that, for dp1, the sweep-dominated layer has the same extension as in CW because the thickness of the bedload layer remains smaller than the (bed-roughness-induced) sweep-dominated layer. In other words, the roughness sublayer thickness in the CW flows for dp1 remains larger than the bedload layer thickness and, hence, no clear modification of the TKE budget is observed in figure 6 between the dp1 SL flows and their reference CW flows.\n\nThe dependence and sensitivity of the production and turbulent diffusion terms to the bed roughness conditions is well documented in the literature. Nakagawa & Nezu (Reference Nakagawa and Nezu1977) have shown that the magnitude of sweep over ejection contributions, RS 4/RS 2 increases with roughness, and that the thickness of the near-bed region where sweeps exceed ejections (RS 4/RS 2 > 1) increases with bed roughness. In addition, they found that negative values of mean Fk are only found for rough walls in contrast to smooth walls and that the vertical range of negative values of Fk increases with roughness. Raupach (Reference Raupach1981) confirmed these observations and presented an explicit relationship between Fk and the coherent flow structure parameter $\\Delta RS = R{S_4} - R{S_2}$. One major difference between the present SL flow results with dp3 and the typical CW rough flows is that, in the latter, the increased downwards TKE transport in the absence of sediments is balanced by an increased viscous dissipation rate (or by a turbulent pressure transport) compared with smooth-wall flows, whereas the downward transported TKE can potentially cause sediment transport as bedload. The remaining energy excess might also increase locally viscous dissipation but to a lesser degree.\n\nTo gain further insights into the transport of TKE by coherent flow structures, Fk was conditionally sampled (considering all 4 quadrants), with different values of threshold level H, as shown in figure 10, only for the SL flows under capacity condition. The average operator, defined by (4.3), is here applied to Fk. It is seen that up to approximately H = 4, the signature and magnitude of conditionally sampled FkH is almost unchanged compared with the mean Fk which means that shear-stress events of level below H = 4 make a negligible contribution to Fk. Only for H = 6 does FkH start to decrease noticeably with a maximal reduction of approximately 25 %. This suggests that TKE flux Fk is mainly driven by strong shear-stress events. This result was previously highlighted by Hurther et al. (Reference Hurther, Lemmin and Terray2007) and Mignot et al. (Reference Mignot, Barthelemy and Hurther2009a), based on ADVP measurements in turbulent, rough CW open-channel flows. A similar analysis was performed by taking only Q2 and Q4 events into account. It was seen that FkH is even larger than Fk, indicating that Q2 and Q4 shear-stress events are the dominant contributors to turbulent TKE transport. Hence, it can be inferred that the transport of TKE into the bedload layer is due to occurrence of very intense and intermittent coherent structures. The intermittency of the intense shear events is well described by the time fraction of their occurrence Tf. For instance, coherent flow structures with threshold values H = 2.5, 4.0 and 6.0, responsible for generating most of Fk, have very low time fractions ${T_f} = 12\\,\\textrm{\\%},6\\,\\textrm{\\%}$ and 2 %, respectively.\n\nNow that it has been shown that coherent structures are highly correlated with the transport of momentum $(\\overline {u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} )$ and of turbulent energy $(\\overline {kw^{\\prime}} )$, their importance in the transport of sediments $(\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} )$ can be examined. We take only the runs with maximum concentration (in saturation). It should be recalled that the accuracy of measured vertical turbulent sediment fluxes $\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ in the present highly inertial conditions is questionable because w′ corresponds to a mixture velocity rather than the sediment-phase velocity. Nevertheless, we are interested mostly in the relative contributions and general trends of conditionally sampled $\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $, rather than absolute values.\n\nAs for the fractional contributions of conditionally sampled shear events (4.5), in figure 11, the fractional contributions of the conditionally sampled vertical turbulent particle flux $c^{\\prime}{w^{\\prime}_H}$ (taking all 4 quadrants) and its mean value $\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} $ are represented, for different values of threshold level H. It is seen that, for H = 1.0, 2.5 and 4.0, the relative contributions to the mean vertical solid flux are approximately $c^{\\prime}{w^{\\prime}_H}/\\overline {c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}} = 0.70{-} 0.8,0.35{-} 0.5$ and $0.2{-} 0.28$, respectively. These relative contributions confirm the strong correlation between the large-scale coherent motions and the vertical particle fluxes for all SL conditions, irrespective of particle size and of suspension number value. The time fractions occupied by the conditionally sampled events having values of H = 1.0, 2.5 and 4.0 are ${T_f} = 33\\,\\% {-} 36\\,\\%,10\\,\\% {-} 15\\,\\%$ and 3 %–7 %, respectively, supporting the high intermittency of $c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ originating from the highly intermittent ejection and sweep events. One important feature is the higher particle entraining efficiency of the strongest events, for dp3. Note that, in (c) and (d), the ratio is systematically larger than in (a) and (b), indicating greater correlation between $c^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ and $u^{\\prime}w^{\\prime}$ events. This result supports the argument of Gyr (Reference Gyr1983) that large particles can only be entrained by intense coherent flow structures. To verify the importance of ejections and sweeps for this case, the same ratio was estimated taking only Q2 and Q4 events. Very similar magnitudes as in the case of the four quadrants (figures 11c and 11d) were found, confirming the leading role in particle dynamics played by ejection- and sweep-type events of high threshold values. Similar dynamics was found by Hurther & Lemmin (Reference Hurther and Lemmin2003), for sediment-laden flows in the suspension regime $({w_s}/{u_\\mathrm{\\ast }} < 0.6)$. The same dominant role played by ejection- and sweep-type events is observed here for SL flows with much higher values of the suspension number.\n\nThe good correlation between the intense large-scale coherent motions and particle motions supports the hypothesis that the increased downwards TKE flux by sweep events might be an important mechanism of energy transfer towards the particles inside the bedload layer."
