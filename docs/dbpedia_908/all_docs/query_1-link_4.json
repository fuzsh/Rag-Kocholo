        "text": "Tenneco's CVSAe technology, also part of the Monroe Intelligent Suspension portfolio, is a continuously variable, semi-active suspension system that senses road and driving conditions to adjust the corresponding triple-tube, electronic dampers in real time. The system's ECU can change rebound damping every 10 milliseconds.\n\nA recent independent consumer clinic surveyed a group of 155 drivers from different vehicle segments that included compact class, upper mid-range vehicles and SUVs to assess the overall driving experience with passive and semi-active suspension systems. More than 94 percent of SUV drivers rated the overall driving experience of those vehicles equipped with semi-active suspension systems as “very good” or “excellent.” Similarly, in the compact car segment, 86 percent of all drivers rated their overall driving experience as “very good” or “excellent,” as did 88 percent of drivers of upper-middle class vehicles. It is clear from these studies that customers want comfort, control, flexibility and safety designed into the automobiles they intend to purchase in the near future.\n\nIn on-road testing, also performed by an independent testing institute, drivers rated intelligent suspension systems highly in reaction to improved stability during lane changes, strongly reduced body-roll oscillations during obstacle avoidance maneuvers and improved wheel-to-road contact on wet and broken road surfaces. In fact, during double lane-change tests utilizing a compact car, steering angle correction was reduced 15 percent and side-slip angle was reduced 37 percent. The reduction in body movement was found to bring greater stability, which helps increase comfort and the feeling of safety.\n\nTenneco’s Monroe Intelligent Suspension platform provides technologies customers can experience, feel and recognize. As these OE-based technologies eventually make their way into your service bay, you will have the opportunity to restore the “like-new” driving experience preferred by so many consumers.\n\n“We will provide the comprehensive technical training and support - combined with quality Monroe replacement components - needed to address these service opportunities,” says Jeff Koviak, vice president and general manager, North America Aftermarket, Tenneco. “That’s the advantage of working with a manufacturer that is a leader both in the OE and replacement markets.”\n\nMonroe Intelligent Suspension systemsDual-mode selective damping Dual Mode Damper technology provides an enhanced experience in sporty compact cars. A button on the dashboard allows drivers to choose how their suspension will interact with the driving environment. Four electronically controlled rebound dampers connect to a simple control unit, which switches the dampers to toggle between soft and firm rebound settings. The system also provides drivers with the option to switch from a default comfortable ride setting for daily traffic, and a more aggressive, track-like performance setting.DRiV™ This system for compact and medium car segments uses an ECU located in each shock to control rebound damping based on forward and lateral acceleration. The DRiV system offers 75 percent of the performance, at 50 percent of the cost, of semi-active suspension systems.CVSA The Continuously Variable Semi-Active Suspension (CVSA) system continuously adjusts damping levels according to road conditions and vehicle dynamics without the need to compromise comfort, performance or safety. Tenneco’s first CVSA technology used an external valve to control damping. However, subsequent development of newer CVSA technology relocated the valve inside the damper. In addition, for even higher levels of performance and comfort, two-valve CVSA technology is available, with independent electro-hydraulic valves controlling both rebound and compression damping, providing increased suspension tuning range and a higher level of comfort, performance and safety in changing and demanding road conditions."
