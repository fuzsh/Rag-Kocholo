        "text": "Old Man Emu (OME) Suspension - Land Cruiser 200 Series Pricing\n\n200 Series Land Cruiser Suspension Kits\n\n(Fits 2008-2021 200 Series Land Cruisers)\n\nOld Man Emu suspensions achieve excellence with their range of fully integrated 4x4 shocks & suspension systems.\n\nVehicle suspension, especially those that are fitted to 4WDs, are complex to say the least. So many factors go towards determining the right solution that no one \"fix\" is the answer to all vehicle models. Old Man Emu is unique. The philosophies, technology & methods behind the development of each of our products combine to ensure you get the best components the world has to offer.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in the tough world of off road racing in Australia, to now being respected world wide, OME takes a unique approach to the design, development, testing and support of their product range.\n\nMany of their customers love roughing it off road, and this can vary from endless hours, even days, of flat, yet corrugated dirt roads to hard core, deeply rutted, rock strewn off road tracks. At the other end of the spectrum there are the four wheel drive owners who have no intention of tackling anything remotely off road. Instead, they’re looking for dramatically increased ride comfort on the bitumen or to give them access to their weekend property or their favorite, out of the way fishing spot.\n\nStandard Duty Suspension:\n\nMedium Replacement Suspension ~2\" Lift - $1145.00\n\n(Retail Price - $1349)\n\nPart# OME200L\n\n1 - Front OME Coils* (Pair)\n\n2 - Front OME Nitrocharger Sport Struts\n\n1 - Rear OME Coils* (Pair)\n\n2 - Rear OME Nitrocharger Sport Shocks\n\nHeavy Replacement Suspension ~2\" Lift - $1205.00\n\n(Retail Price - $1349)\n\nPart# OME200H\n\n1 - Front OME Coils* (Pair)\n\n2 - Front OME Nitrocharger Sport Struts\n\n1 - Rear OME Coils* (Pair)\n\n2 - Rear OME Nitrocharger Sport Shocks\n\n*Front Coil Specifications (Sold in Pairs):\n\nOME2700: 1\" Stock/Light Front Coil\n\nOME2701: 1\" Medium Front Coil (Up to 220 lbs)\n\nOME2702: 2\" Stock/Light Front Coil\n\nOME2703: 2\" Medium Front Coil (Up to 220 lbs)\n\n*Rear Coil Specifications (Sold in Pairs):\n\nOME2720: -.75\" Medium Rear Coils (Less .75\" Lift)\n\nOME2721: 0\" Medium Rear Coils (No Lift)\n\nOME2722: .75\" Medium Rears Coil\n\nOME2723: .75\" Heavy Constant (200 - 440 lbs of additional rear weight)\n\nOME2724: .75\" Heavy Constant (440 - 880 lbs of additional rear weight)\n\nOME2725: .75\" Heavy Constant (880 - 1300 lbs of additional rear weight)\n\nUltimate Duty BP-51 Suspension Systems:\n\nThe new BP-51 range of high performance, bypass shock absorbers is the result of an exhaustive development process aimed at delivering the ultimate in both comfort and control.\n\nDesigned, developed and tested entirely in-house by ARB’s team of Old Man Emu ride engineers, BP-51 shock absorbers are vehicle specific and utilise existing mounting locations to provide easy installation without the need for additional vehicle modification.\n\nUnlike most other adjustable shock absorbers, which provide adjustment for compression only, the BP-51 range allows on vehicle, independent adjustability of both rebound and compression to offer class leading ride customisation that can be tailored to individual vehicle or trip requirements.\n\nIn addition to the velocity sensitive damping used in most shock absorbers, where the faster the piston moves, the higher the level of damping is generated, BP-51 shock absorbers also generate damping dependent on the position of the piston within the shock absorbers body via their bypass design.\n\nWhile most shock absorbers only generate damping based on fluid flowing through the piston, the BP-51 offers an alternative path from one chamber to the other, around the piston in the form of bypass passages. Some fluid flows through the piston and some fluid bypasses around the piston in the bypass passages.\n\nThis results in an ability for the shock absorber to provide the best of both worlds, with a comfortable and compliant ride during normal driving and a more controlled ride over more challenging terrain. With greater levels of damping generated at each end of the stroke, the piston slows as it approaches full compression and extension, preventing harsh topping out against the bump stop and allowing larger bumps and corrugations to be absorbed more easily.\n\nOME BP-51 Replacement Suspension ~2\" Lift - $3231.00\n\nPart# OME200BP51\n\n2 - OME BP5190003L/BP5190003R - Front OME BP-51 Coilovers\n\n1 - OME VM80010003 - Front Fitting Kit - 200 w/KDSS\n\n2 - OME BP5160003 - Rear OME BP-51 Shocks\n\n1 - OME VM80010005 - Rear Fitting Kit - 200 w/KDSS\n\n1 - OME2720-725 Rear OME Coils* (Pair)\n\nFor optimal setup with these components, we recommend the SUS25465 Light Racing Upper Control arms.\n\n*Rear Coil Specifications (Sold in Pairs):\n\nOME2720: -.75\" Medium Rear Coils (Less .75\" Lift)\n\nOME2721: 0\" Medium Rear Coils (No Lift)\n\nOME2722: .75\" Medium Rears Coil\n\nOME2723: .75\" Heavy Constant (200 - 440 lbs of additional rear weight)\n\nOME2724: .75\" Heavy Constant (440 - 880 lbs of additional rear weight)\n\nOME2725: .75\" Heavy Constant (880 - 1300 lbs of additional rear weight\n\nOptional Accessories:\n\nPart# OME95F5 - Trim Spacers - Optional 5mm spacers used to balance lift. - $22/pair\n\nPart# OME661 - Lower Rear Shock Stone Guards - $37.00/pair\n\nPart# SUS200STRUTAFT - Upper Strut Mount Kit - $42.50/each\n\nLight Racing Upper Control Arms (sold as pair)\n\nPart# SUS25465 - $825.50\n\n(Allows 4 degrees of caster adjustment and 2 degrees of camber adjustment)\n\nSPC 200 Series Heavy Duty Lower Control Arms (sold as pair)\n\nFits 2008-2021 200 Series LHD/RHD - Part# SUS25965 - $282.50\n\nDobinsons Rear Adjustable Panhard/Track Bar\n\nPart# SUS2591421 - $305.00\n\n(Allows proper alignment and geometry of rear axle when lifting 2\" or more in rear)\n\nFront Coilover Assembly Service- $75/pair\n\nAvailable with the purchase of any pair of front OME struts and OME Coils.

Requires far less downtime and additional tools needed to disassemble your existing assemblies when installing an OME system.\n\nSuspension Notes:\n\nWhen a customer has reached the point that they are ready to get a suspension order into our computer, we will spend time discussing the past, current and future uses for the vehicle, current and planned accessories & loads and desired suspension height and tire size. All this data will be recorded into a personalized \"Build Sheet\" on your vehicle and we will make recommendations based on this information to complete your order and get your suspension kit en route.\n\nOME front coils can only be installed with OME struts. They will not fit on the OE struts due to a different winding of the lower coil end.\n\nTo maintain ride height when front accessory weight exceeds 220lbs, OME95PF5 coils spacers should be installed. Each OME95PF5 will increase the net ride height by 10mm.\n\nOME661 lower rear shock stone guards are recommended fitment for protection against stone damage. Sold in pairs only. Part# OME661\n\nKDSS (Kinetic Dynamic Stability System) compatible. Please contact our tech department for special fitting instructions (included with purchase of suspension).\n\nThe OME springs range has been developed to give owners the ability to reduce the very pronounced 3\" of rear to front rake of the original Toyota suspension. By carefully matching the OME front and rear springs this rake can be reduced to roughly .75\" to 2\" depending on coil selection, user variables and desired rake.\n\nFront & Rear Coil Specifications: Click Here\n\nEMAIL FOR SHIPPING QUOTE\n\nPlease include your year and vehicle model as well as your shipping location."
