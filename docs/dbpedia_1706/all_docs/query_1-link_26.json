Redblacks return from 13-day break to put streak on line versus 'Riders Back to video\n\nWith 1,062 passing yards during the current three-game winning streak, Brown has given Ottawa production at the position that’s been sorely lacking since Trevor Harris threw for 1,229 yards during a similar stretch in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

So I think as long as we continue to work and show up to work and be intentional, then it should continue to stay on the incline.”\n\nThe Redblacks are certainly creating a buzz around the league.\n\nThe winning streak has improved their record to 5-2, which is the best start an Ottawa team has had since the 1978 Rough Riders, and includes an unblemished 4-0 mark at home.\n\nWhile the defence hasn’t allowed a touchdown in more than eight quarters, the offence is averaging 30 points over the last three games.\n\nContinuing the torrid pace on the Redbacks’ return from a bye week and 13 days of rest won’t be easy for Brown.\n\nThe Roughriders have the best turnover ratio in the CFL at plus-11 thanks largely to their league-leading 13 interceptions.\n\n“I think when you think about turnovers on offence, you actually turn the ball over more,” said Brown, who has thrown four interceptions and six TD passes. “At least I’ve seen guys in my position that worry about turnovers, turning the ball over and not being aggressive at the same time, which is not ideal. But yeah, (the Roughriders) do a good job. They’re patient. They do things that makes sense, so you’ve got to tip your cap to how they’re coached, and they play hard. It’ll be fun.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThings have been less joyful in the land of green and white the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe Roughriders are 5-3 and tied with B.C. for first in the West Division, but they are playing on a short week and have lost two straight, including a 42-31 setback at home on Saturday that represented the Edmonton Elks’ first win of the season.\n\nHarris has come off the six-game injured list, but reports indicate he will not play against his old team.\n\nThat means third-year QB Shea Patterson will take a 2-3 record, which includes a 62 per cent completion rate for 1,300 yards, along with four touchdown passes, two interceptions and 103 rushing yards on 22 carries, into his sixth straight start.\n\n“The No. 1 thing I look at is do we have an opportunity to win? And he’s put us in those opportunities,” Roughriders head coach Corey Mace said earlier this week, per 3DownNation. “I’ve been really pleased with Shea.”\n\nThe Redblacks have been prepping for Patterson, despite Mace hinting on Monday that Harris had a “50-50” shot at playing.\n\n“Shea is a handful,” said Redblacks head coach Bob Dyce. “He runs the ball well, he’s able to throw well. (Offensive co-ordinator) Mark Mueller has done a good job incorporating him in that offence and adapting some things to Shea’s skill set. We have to be prepared for a multifaceted attack in what they do.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Redblacks will have two starters returning from injury on defence — cornerback Alijay McGhee and linebacker Frankie Griffin — and one on offence in right tackle Zack Pelehos.\n\nAlso back in the roster after missing the last two games with a knee injury will be return specialist DeVonte Dedmon, who will also serve as the lone backup to running back Ryquell Armstead.\n\nHolding that role in the 33-6 pasting of Calgary on July 26 was receiver Bralon Addison, and with Armstead being ejected in the second quarter he led the Redblacks with five carries for 28 yards.\n\nBut Addison will sit this one out as he recovers from what Dyce called an illness.\n\n“I get excited … I need to calm down a little bit,” Dedmon, who has 29 carries for 82 yards over his five seasons in Ottawa, said when asked about getting a shot at tailback. “I’ve been playing this game since I was six years old. I played running back, switched to quarterback, played receiver, played corner. So now switching all the way back.\n\n“I feel more at home back there. It just turns into a punt return for me. Get the handoff and (hit) the hole and get going. So I’m excited. (Offensive co-ordinator) Coach Tommy (Condell) puts us in great positions to be successful, and I’m just going to deal with my job.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Redblacks would have no hesitation in putting Dedmon in the backfield.\n\n“He’s really grasped that role and really ran with it,” said Dyce. “He is diligent in his meetings with (running backs) Coach (Nate) Taylor, who has done a fantastic job in getting him prepared. He’s taking this role very seriously and he’s done a great job. You know, he’s getting all his reads in protection, and we all know how dynamic he can be when the ball is in his hands. So I have great confidence when Dedmon is in there at tailback.”\n\nGOING DEEP\n\nThe game will mark something of a family reunion for Redblacks defensive end/special teams player Kene Onyeka, whose brother Godfrey Onyeka and cousin Kosi Onyeka play on Saskatchewan’s special teams and are backups in the secondary. “Every game is really fun, but it’s a bit more fun when you get a target that you know really well,” said Onyeka, a former Carleton Raven. “We have a group chat and we’re all very competitive. We all think we’re the best one in the family. Whenever we get an opportunity to go up against each other, we all do. I get to really see those guys on special teams. So whenever I’m out there, I’m looking for them. It’s always a good time.” So who is the best player in the family? “Obviously, I’m going to have to say me,” Kene replied with a laugh. “That’s an easy one.” … More from Brown. When asked about the energy in the Redblacks room these days, he said: “I think the best way to explain it is we show up every day grateful, but not complacent, confident, but at the same time we know that we got to put in the work and that the preparation leads to what we put on the field during the game. I think there’s a humbleness to the group because a lot of guys know how this game can be. And there’s an appreciation for winning, but there’s also an understanding of what it takes to win.” About the home winning streak, he said: “There’s a comfort to playing at home. You don’t have to get on a plane and you kind of know your routine and you know, probably what time you’re coming in and who you’re gonna see when you walk in. I just I don’t think we really like think about that kind of stuff. We think about winning the game and what it takes to win the game. And I think, you know, when you think about all the other things, it’s just clouds your mind. I think our our team does a great job of just focusing on what we need to do. And when that happens it creates a great environment. We win games here. Everyone has fun. We get to enjoy that as well. It’s like, if we handle this then the domino falls and all this cool stuff happens.” And when asked about who on the team is not getting enough recognition for playing good football, his answer was kind of predictable. “The offensive line and some of the things that have gone on there,” he said. “There’s multiple games where I haven’t really been touched. They put a lot of work in. I feel like coming here everyone was like, ‘Oh, offensive line, is that going to be an issue?’ And it certainly is not. Those guys are well coached. They work hard and they prepare with the best of them. I came from a really solid offensive line room (in Winnipeg) for the last five, six years. And, you know, I see the same type of things happening in our line. I think they really care about me. … I think they care about the quarterbacks, I should say. They take pride in being physical in the run game and in pass protection. That’s also to say Rock (Armstead) does a great job in pass protection.”\n\ndbrennan@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nFIXIN' WHAT AIN'T BROKE: Redblacks go back to starters after injury replacements shine\n\nGOTTA HAVE 'D': Red-hot Redblacks winning with abundance of depth, particularly on defence\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
