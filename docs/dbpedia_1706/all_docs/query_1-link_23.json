        "text": "By SUZAN FRASER Associated Press\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey on Wednesday filed a request with a U.N. court to join South Africa’s lawsuit accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, the foreign minister said.\n\nTurkey’s ambassador to the Netherlands, accompanied by a group of Turkish legislators, submitted a declaration of intervention to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.\n\nWith the development, Turkey, one of the fiercest critics of Israel’s actions in Gaza, becomes the latest nation seeking to participate in the case. Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua and Libya have also asked to join the case, as have Palestinian officials. The court’s decision on their requests is still pending.\n\n“We have just submitted our application to the International Court of Justice to intervene in the genocide case filed against Israel,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan wrote on the social media platform X. “Emboldened by the impunity for its crimes, Israel is killing more and more innocent Palestinians every day.”\n\n“The international community must do its part to stop the genocide; it must put the necessary pressure on Israel and its supporters,” he said. “Turkey will make every effort to do so.”\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of genocide, called for it to be punished in international courts and criticized Western nations for backing Israel. In May, Turkey suspended trade with Israel, citing its assault on Gaza.\n\nIn contrast to the United States, Canada and the European Union, which have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization, Erdogan has commended the group, calling it a liberation movement.\n\nSouth Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has strongly rejected accusations of genocide and has argued that the war in Gaza is a legitimate defensive action against Hamas terrorists for their Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and in which 250 hostages were taken.\n\nIf admitted to the case, the countries who joined would be able to make written submissions and speak at public hearings.\n\nPreliminary hearings have already been held in the genocide case against Israel, but the court is expected to take years to reach a final decision.\n\nIn a statement to the media, Hamas welcomed Turkey’s request to join the lawsuit and said it affirms Erdogan’s support for the Palestinian cause.\n\n“No country in the world is above international law,” Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Oncu Keceli said on X earlier. “The case at the International Court of Justice is extremely important in terms of ensuring that the crimes committed by Israel do not go unpunished.”\n\nKeceli also called for the immediate implementations of precautionary measures ordered by the court, including a halt to military offensive and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nSince Erdogan took power in 2003, former allies Turkey and Israel have experienced a volatile relationship, marked by periods of severe friction and reconciliation. The war in Gaza has disrupted the most recent attempts at normalizing ties."
