        "text": "A star on screen, behind the camera, and in the recording studio, French-Canadian actor/singer Carole Laure began her life far from the bright lights of Hollywood. Raised among six brothers and sisters in rural Quebec, Laure received a convent education before briefly trying out a career as a teacher. Laure had always had a natural talent for performance, however, playing the piano with ease. When director Jean Chabot cast her in his film \"Mon enfance à Montréal\" (1971), the 20-year-old Laure was happy to switch career directions and pursue a life in show business full time. More movie roles followed, including a prominent turn as a country music singer in \"La Mort du bûcheron\" (1973). Another key moment came for Laure in 1977, when she met musician Lewis Furey at a cabaret, hitting it off immediately both personally and professionally. The two began collaborating on an album for Laure, which released later that year. Entitled Alibis, the record featured Laure singing and playing piano, with Furey collaborating and acting as a producer. Over the course of several more successful albums and concert tours, the duo became inseparable both musically and personally, and later wed. Laure concurrently continued her acting career, appearing in both French-Canadian and American films like \"Stress\" (1984) and \"Elles ne pensent qu'à ça \" (1994). Never staying away from either of her artistic passions for very long, Laure alternated between acting in movies and recording and performing music. She eventually stepped behind the camera to try her hand at writing and directing as well, beginning with the drama \"Marie's Sons\" (2002), in which she also co-starred as Marie. After a successful second film, the teen drama \"CQ2\" (2004), Laure largely would up her performing career; she only starred in one more film, the fairy tale \"The Beautiful Beast\" (2006), before returning to a full-time career as an auteur with the drama \"La capture\" (2007) and the romantic comedy-drama \"Love Project\" (2014)."
