Raymond Felton’s agent told the Free Press this afternoon that he plans to contact the Pistons later today to gauge the franchise’s interest in the free agent point guard. Dutt confirmed an earlier Associated Press report that seven teams have contacted him on the first day of free agency about Felton, who was the No. 5 pick in the 2005 draft. Felton is coming off a season where he averaged 12.1 points and 5.6 assists for the Charlotte Bobcats.

Prior to Haslem’s speech to the Heat’s summer squad, Larsson was underwhelming with 7.5 points, four rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game while shooting 35.5 percent from the field and 2 of 10 (20 percent) from three-point range in his first four appearances during summer league. After Haslem’s words, Larsson played like one of the Heat summer league team’s best players. He averaged 15.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 51.2 percent from the field and 6 of 13 (46.2 percent) on threes during his final four appearances, including his game-winning push shot in overtime of Monday’s Las Vegas Summer League championship contest.

After graduating from Folsom High School, Wells attended Sonoma State for two impressive seasons, averaging 17.9 points and 7.4 rebounds, before transferring to Washington State. The 6-foot-8 wing averaged 12.6 points while shooting 41.7% from three-point land. The change of colleges gave him a better opportunity to be recognized by NBA teams. “I waited till I got the spotlight, and once I got it, I shined,” Wells said. “Going to a D-1 school gave me a bigger platform, and once I got there, making it to the NBA felt more in reach.”
