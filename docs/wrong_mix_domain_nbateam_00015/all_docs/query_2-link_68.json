        "text": "The Vertical Front-Office Insider Bobby Marks, a former 20-year executive with the Nets, looks at the possible offseason plans and roster details for every team in the league.\n\nPrevious teams in the series: Nets and Suns | Timberwolves and 76ers | Magic and Kings | Hornets and Pelicans | Knicks and Nuggets | Lakers and Heat | Mavericks and Pistons | Pacers and Blazers | Hawks and Thunder | Bulls and Grizzlies\n\nL.A. CLIPPERS\n\nOffseason focus\n\nRetool not rebuild\n\nThe sentiment when a high-payroll playoff team fails to advance past the second round in consecutive seasons is to blow up the roster.\n\nThat strategy would be sound for a team with a strong foundation beyond its core players.\n\nUnfortunately for the Clippers, they do not have young players on the cusp of starting.\n\nThe franchise now faces a summer of uncertainty with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and J.J. Redick set to hit free agency. Because of the team’s win-now approach, draft picks have been either traded or they failed to develop, and now the Clippers are backed into a corner with depleted assets.\n\nThe easy solution would be for the Clippers to spend their way out of their current problems.\n\nThey could re-sign their own free agents, return a team that won 51 games and once again hope they improve next season.\n\nThat direction would likely cost $150 million in salary with an additional $130 million in luxury tax.\n\nBut tearing down the roster would be a slow and painful process.\n\nLos Angeles’ best move would be to be selective in whom they re-sign and retool the roster instead of a massive rebuild.\n\nFree agency: need vs. luxury\n\nThe Clippers have eight free agents this summer not including Paul Pierce, who is set to retire.\n\nBecause of the Clippers’ cap situation, bringing back every free agent is unlikely.\n\nRe-signing starters Paul, Griffin, Redick and Luc Mbah a Moute would cost a combined $85 million annually in cap hits, which is possible but financially irresponsible.\n\nThe Clippers should focus on Paul and Griffin.\n\nPaul will be 32 years old and getting a $200 million-plus contract, and Griffin has been oft-injured the past few seasons, failing to stay healthy in the playoffs the past two years.\n\nBut they are integral if the Clippers want to stay competitive and if they lost both players they would only have $18 million to replace them.\n\nRedick and Mbah a Moute are luxuries the team can’t afford to keep.\n\nWith $11.8 million and $14.2 million tied up in Austin Rivers and Jamal Crawford, respectively, bringing back Redick at a likely price tag of $16 million annually isn’t an option.\n\nThe Redick contract alone would cost the Clippers an additional $70 million in luxury tax if Paul and Griffin are signed to max contracts.\n\nMbah a Moute could be a cap casualty because of the contract given to Wesley Johnson last summer.\n\nJohnson will earn $5,881,260 next season, played a combined 10 minutes during the playoffs and does not have a role on the team.\n\nThe Mbah a Moute salary-cap hit would have tax ramifications of around $30 million, not including salary.\n\nIf the Clippers can find a taker for Johnson’s contract then Mbah a Moute should return.\n\nDon’t mirror ‘Melo contract\n\nGriffin and Paul are max-salary candidates, but as New York learned with Carmelo Anthony, what is added into a contract besides salary could have a lasting effect.\n\nPaul and Griffin are eligible for no-trade clauses and trade bonuses.\n\nWhile the trade bonus does not immediately impact trade value because the bonus is not allowed to exceed the maximum salary, Anthony’s no-trade clause has really restricted the Knicks’ ability to reshape their roster.\n\nThe Clippers need to avoid the same trap.\n\nRebuilding the bench\n\nThe Clippers’ revolving cast of reserves will continue this summer with the likely departure of free agents Raymond Felton, Brandon Bass, Mo Speights and Alan Anderson.\n\nIf the team is committed to having three max contracts (Paul, Griffin and DeAndre Jordan), it has to have success with its mid-level exception and draft picks to have some bench stability. This is where the team needs to improve the most.\n\nSummer cap breakdown\n\nGuaranteed 2017-18 Insider info\n\nDeAndre Jordan $22,642,350 Trade Bonus/extension eligible\n\nBlake Griffin $21,373,952 Player option June 28\n\nJamal Crawford $14,246,988\n\nAustin Rivers $11,825,000\n\nWes Johnson $5,881,260\n\nBrice Johnson $1,331,160\n\nDiamond Stone $1,312,611\n\nFA cap hold 2017-18 FA status\n\nChris Paul $34,303,241 Bird/projected to opt out\n\nJ.J. Redick $14,017,250 Bird\n\nLuc Mbah a Moute $2,863,990 Early Bird/projected to opt out\n\nMarreese Speights $1,471,382 Non-Bird\n\nRaymond Felton $1,471,382 Non-Bird\n\nBrandon Bass $1,471,382 Non-Bird\n\nAlan Anderson $1,471,382 Non-Bird\n\nDead cap space 2017-218\n\nPaul Pierce $1,096,080\n\nCarlos Delfino $650,000\n\nJordan Farmar $510,922\n\nMiroslav Raduljica $252,043\n\nSalary table 2017\n\nGuaranteed salaries $78,613,321\n\nDead money $2,509,045\n\nFree-agent cap holds $57,070,009\n\nSalaries: cap $138,726,600\n\nSalaries: tax $81,122,366\n\nSalary cap $101,000,000\n\nLuxury tax $121,000,000\n\nCap space None ($37,192,375 over)\n\nTax room $39,877,634\n\nProjected cap space\n\nThe Clippers do not have cap space and will be a repeater tax team if Griffin and Paul return.\n\nLos Angeles has the $5.2 million tax exception but using part or all of it will come at a significant cost because of the tax.\n\nThe maximum cap space the Clippers can create is $37 million, but that projection includes all of their free agents departing.\n\nJune draft picks\n\nThe Clippers will send Toronto their first-round pick.\n\nThe pick was originally sent to Milwaukee as part of the Jared Dudley cap-clearing trade in 2014.\n\nMilwaukee then sent the pick to Toronto in exchange for Greivis Vasquez.\n\nThe Clippers’ second-round pick was sent to Boston as part of a trade for Rivers in 2015.\n\nFuture draft picks\n\nThe Clippers will send Boston a 2019 or 2020 first-round pick, protected Nos. 1-14.\n\nIf no first-rounder in either year is conveyed, the Clippers will send the Celtics a second-round pick in 2022.\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\nOffseason focus\n\nLearn from the playoffs\n\nWhether losing in the first round or winning the NBA championship, playoff teams cannot rest on their laurels.\n\nThe young core and roster remain, and there is no reason why the Bucks should not be able to improve upon their first-round playoff exit next season.\n\nIf the Bucks get complacent, an up-and-coming team could land in the lottery.\n\nThe Greg Monroe option\n\nGreg Monroe can exercise his $17.8 million option for next season on June 22.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2015-16 season, Monroe has developed into one of the top sixth men in the league and played a key role in Milwaukee’s resurgence this year.\n\nHe is two years into a max contract, but opting out does not create cap space for the Bucks.\n\nThe Bucks still would be right at the salary cap, and although flexibility would increase regarding the luxury tax and Tony Snell’s free agency, Milwaukee would not be in a position to replace Monroe.\n\nThe best outcome for the Bucks would be Monroe sticking around to provide stability at center.\n\nSlow approach with Jabari Parker\n\nJabari Parker resembled an All-Star in the first half of the 2016-17 season.\n\nThe 22-year-old has developed into a core piece for the Bucks, but two left ACL knee surgeries in the past three years should have Milwaukee taking a patient approach when it comes to his return to the court and an extension.\n\nBecause Parker is entering his fourth season, he is extension-eligible.\n\nBut the best approach for the Bucks would be to table contract talks until the summer of 2018, when Parker has fully regained his health and reclaimed his role on the team.\n\nSummer cap breakdown\n\nGuaranteed 2017-18 Insider info\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo $22,471,910\n\nGreg Monroe $17,884,176 Player option June 22\n\nKhris Middleton $14,100,000\n\nJohn Henson $11,422,536\n\nMirza Teletovic $10,500,000\n\nMatthew

tax $121,000,000\n\nCap space None ($17,852,279 over)\n\nTax room $12,987,572\n\nProjected cap space\n\nThe team currently does not have cap space.\n\nThe Bucks would need a combination of Monroe opting out of his contract and also some trades in order to create space.\n\nThe Bucks will have the $8.4 million and $3.2 million exceptions, but will need to pay attention to the luxury tax if they want to retain restricted free agent Tony Snell.\n\nJune draft picks\n\nMilwaukee has its own first-round pick.\n\nThe Bucks also have their second-round pick at No. 48.\n\nFuture draft picks\n\nThe Bucks own their future first-round picks.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n• Hot topic: Is LeBron James approaching Michael Jordan’s rarified air?\n\n• In brushing off Celtics, LaVar and Lonzo making
