        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — A game came and went with no minutes for Raymond Felton, and that should come as no surprise.\n\nAs he does most nights, the Thunder guard spent Thursday’s 117-95 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on the bench. He cheered. He dished out some advice. He dressed and he left.\n\nThere are worse ways he could spend his days.\n\nAt 34, Felton is young in life, but in his NBA twilight. He’s carrying almost 14 full seasons of mileage now and has designs on two more. He’s still “busting my behind every day,” he said, on the practice court and in the weight room.\n\nThese days, he does it with little to no promise of playing time. A year removed from a role in the rotation, Felton has played in 15 of the Thunder’s 54 games this season, none since Dec. 30.\n\nIt’s not what Felton wants. But he is where he wants to be.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I said it’s not tough,” Felton told The Athletic this week. “It’s tough. It’s heartbreaking at points. But at the same time, I know my role.”\n\nThat role is as the classic good-locker-room guy, as mentor to young players like Terrance Ferguson and Hamidou Diallo. It’s not what Felton wants, but he’s good at it. He’s come to take some pleasure from it.\n\n“His voice, his presence inside of our team, inside the locker room, is huge,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan.\n\nAs such, it should come as no great shock that when the buzzer sounded on Thursday’s NBA trade deadline, Felton had stayed in place.\n\nHe’s in regular communication with Thunder general manager Sam Presti, a dialogue that Felton said has helped him accept his role. In those conversations, Felton said, Presti has expressed his appreciation for the ways Felton helps the Thunder.\n\nBut those talks never turned to trades, Felton said. He’s never asked Presti for one.\n\n“Me trying to leave here, that’s something that’s out of the question,” Felton said. “To go to a team where they’re not doing nothing but trying to get draft picks, to be just a locker-room guy there, I’m not trying to do that. Not at this point in my career. I’d rather do that here with a team that has a chance to win something and play in the playoffs, where I possibly have a chance to help this team in the playoffs.”\n\nLast season, Felton played in all 88 Thunder games, 82 in the regular season and six in the playoffs. He averaged 6.9 points and 2.5 assists in 16.9 minutes in the regular season as Russell Westbrook’s backup.\n\nThere were nights — like the eight-point, five-assist game in Charlotte last January — when he came off the bench not just to steady the second unit, but to spark a win.\n\nThe Thunder re-signed Felton in the offseason, but his status changed when the team traded for point guard Dennis Schröder. A younger player approaching his prime, Schröder now is Westbrook’s primary backup, a utility guard who can fit with OKC’s starters or reserves.\n\n“Things happen, trades happen, and sometimes trades change up different guys’ roles,” Felton said. “And unfortunately it was mine. So now all I can do is stay ready, man.”\n\nThat’s where the work comes in, the effort to stay in shape in case he should get the call from Donovan. Felton hopes not to be thrown into action by an injury, but knows it could happen. And Felton knows Donovan well enough to know that there might come a day when he “decides to change something up,” and give Felton a look in a game.\n\nBut he goes to work every day knowing he’ll mostly spend his nights watching from the sideline.\n\n“He’s never got his head down complaining to the coaches,” Ferguson said. “He’s never complaining to us. He goes home every night knowing that he’s gonna be sitting on the bench, and he’s accepted it. His enthusiasm every game, every practice, just his energy, it keeps us going.”\n\nWhen Ferguson is on the floor, he said, it’s Felton’s voice he most often hears. Felton is the guy he looks to for sideline guidance. When Ferguson is subbed out, he takes a seat next to Felton, who critiques and corrects.\n\nAgainst the Grizzlies on Thursday, Ferguson shot 2-for-9 from 3-point range. He missed his first five 3s before Felton told him he was fading on his shot. Ferguson hit his next two.\n\nFelton’s role includes “teaching young guys to be ready to play when their number is called,” Westbrook said. It’s not his only job, but it might for now be his most fulfilling, particularly given his history with Ferguson and Diallo.\n\nThanks to his association with Under Armour and the AAU team he sponsors on the shoe company’s summer circuit, he’s literally seen the Thunder youngsters grow up. Ferguson played in tournaments with Felton’s nephew, Jalek, and remembers seeing Felton at summer events. Diallo, too, played summer games with Felton in attendance.\n\n“These guys look at me as a real-life uncle,” Felton said. “They call me Unc. The relationships I’ve built with them, to try to teach them and show them how to be professional, it’s beautiful to see. It’s perfect.”\n\nIt’s almost perfect.\n\n“I love this city. I love these fans,” Felton said. “They’ve been nothing but amazing to me. This organization has been nothing but amazing to me. Do I want to play? Heck yeah. I love the game. I love to play basketball. But am I OK? I’m good.”\n\n(Photo: Zach Beeker / NBAE via Getty Images)"
