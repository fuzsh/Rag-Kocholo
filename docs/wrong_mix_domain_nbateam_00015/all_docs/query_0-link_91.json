        "text": "Tip\n\n: 7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit.\n\nProbable starters\n\n: DET - G: Rodney Stuckey, Chucky Atkins; F: Jonas Jerebko, Jason Maxiell; C: Ben Wallace; CHA - G: Raymond Felton, Stephen Jackson; F: Gerald Wallace, Boris Diaw; C: Tyson Chandler.\n\nNotes\n\n: The Bobcats are finally starting to look like a Larry Brown team. Their defense\n\nand he even has a terrified young point guard who's confidence he shatters every day in D.J. Augustin, who is in and out of the rotation.\n\nStephen Jackson has been really efficient for the Bobcats since they acquired him, and has provided a solid option next to Gerald Wallace, a relentless slasher and rebounder, and Raymond Felton, a shoot-first PG who is capable of getting off for big nights shooting the ball.\n\nThe Bobcats are also getting Tyson Chandler healthy, slowly but surely, and he's the perfect Larry Brown center: a rebounder/defender/shot-blocker who doesn't ever need a play run for him on offense.\n\nCharlotte, at 10-16, is a half game behind Detroit for eighth place in the East.\n\nLast Meeting\n\n: The Pistons beat Charlotte 98-75. And Will Bynum did this:"
