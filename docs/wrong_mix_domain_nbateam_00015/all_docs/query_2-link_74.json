        "text": "This is an archive of my NBA blog, Hoop Logic. I love basketball. I’ve been playing since I was 12, and still play to this day. My love for NBA ball started during the height of the Patrick Ewing era of the New York Knicks in 1993-94. I kind of fell off as a fan when God Forbid started touring heavily 2001-05, but slowly got back into it. Now, I’m a bonafide super fan. If you are a fan too, I hope you enjoy my insights on the league. Below are a collection of all of my articles on Metalsucks.net. Big thanks to my editor and interviewer, Anso DF. His enthusiasm keeps me going. Check it!\n\n————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XXII – Posted May. 20th on Metalsucks.net\n\nIt’s easy to appreciate Mark Jackson, head coach of the Golden State Warriors. He’s an outlier, a fearless polymath who took an unusual route to his position: He was an all-star NBA player, then broadcaster, then head coach. Mere mortals must grind out success at the helm of a D-league team and down the bench from masters Popovich or Rivers, then wait poised for a rare opportunity. Not Jackson. He got himself hired to lead a playoff team with two budding megastars, and guided them to a post-season series win via inspired team ball. Wow!\n\nSo lol we might consider Jackson the NBA’s Doc Coyle, also a five-tool superstud whose takes his own route to awesomeness. He’s a force behind awesome metal records with God Forbid, he’s a NBA analyst par excellence, a great dresser and drinksman, and now the master of his own internet website, DocCoyle.net yaaay! Stalk him there later, but now here’s Doc on the riveting 2013 NBA Playoffs in his column Hoop Logic! Doc, go!\n\nU stay classy, Miami\n\nDoc, which team is the biggest threat to Miami’s championship plans?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: We have to understand that the Miami Heat are not unbeatable. They had an historic season and 27-game winning streak, but they were not blowing teams out during that streak. Many of their wins against mediocre (or worse) teams came down to the final minutes. And this post-season, the Heat have not really been challenged. The Bucks, their first-round match-up, are by far the worst team in the playoffs, and were playing so bad heading into the post-season that it looked like they were tanking their way into the draft lottery. Still Miami didn’t blow out Milwaukee, even though it was a sweep.\n\nIn the second round, the Heat faced a Bulls team that could not put their best foot forward because of injury. I never expected Derrick Rose to return, but this series would have been much more competitive if Luol Deng and Kirk Hinrich were healthy. Deng is among the NBA’s best LeBron-stoppers while Hinrich gives you solid ball pressure, outside shooting, and the opportunity for Nate Robinson to be the sixth man with a scoring punch off the bench. So, along with the everybody else’s, the Bulls earned my infinite respect; I’ve never seen a team that unhealthy compete so hard. Props to Coach Tibs and those boys who looked like that were staying stitched together by super glue and duct tape.\n\nSo the Heat haven’t really been challenged yet, having mowed through the sub-par Bucks and depleted Bulls. Now the Heat won’t underestimate the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern conference finals (game one tonight on TNT), because they haven’t been pushed to the brink yet may make more likely that Indy could steal a win in Miami. Not to mention that LeBron and crew have waited through a second long break — the rust showed in their game one loss in the Bulls series.\n\nAnother factor is that Dwyane Wade will not be 100% from now on. I don’t think this changes Miami’s status as the championship favorite, but it makes them more beatable. I expect the Heat to eliminate the Pacers in five or six games, but this will be a tough series. The Pacers have great defense, they rebound the ball, and they play together. Last season, Indy blew their 2-1 lead over Miami partly because they stopped pounding the ball inside to big men David West and Roy Hibbert — I don’t expect them to repeat that mistake this week. Can Chris Bosh contain Hibbert? He greatly outsized. Chris “Birdman” Andersen will play a huge role as the Heat bench’s best big.\n\nAs for the Finals, I think the Grizzlies are a tougher challenge. The Spurs’ style is much more similar to Miami’s: fast pace, unselfish ball movement, high-percentage buckets, and excellent defense. Meanwhile, Memphis could force Miami to adjust their style to play grind-it-out half-court basketball. I could see the defense of Tony Allen and Mike Conleycompletely taking Wade out of the series — and you still have to deal with Zach Randolphand Marc Gasol down low. Indiana had the best-rated defense in the regular season, but Memphis has become the best defensive team in the NBA since the arrival of Tayshaun Prince. They swarm you and wear you out over the course of a game. Perhaps the Indiana series will be like a training camp for Miami versus Memphis since they are constructed similarly.\n\nDoc, you are an expert on the Knicks. Did they lose that series to the Pacers, or were they beaten?\n\nDOC: Let me first congratulate the Knicks on a great season. 54 wins, an Atlantic Division title, second seed in the East, and advancing to the second round of the playoffs are big accomplishments for a team that has been in the dog house for more than a decade. I am bummed out that they lost because it looked like game six was in hand, but no one thought they would be as good as they were, so overall it was a great year.\n\nTo answer the question, I say it was a little of both. First off, the Pacers played their game: inside-out offense, suffocating defense, and extremely physical play. Boston and Indiana have written the rule book on how to play this version of the Knicks; that starts with notdouble-teaming Carmelo Anthony (above left). It helps that these teams have Brandon Bass and Paul George, respectively, who can actually keep Melo in chece and force him to take tough shots all game. (Melo also has a tendency to tire out in the fourth quarter.) The effect of playing Melo straight up: It allows the defense to stay close to New York’s many three-point shooters. New York just broke the record for made three-pointers in a season, and it was the key to their success — along with low turnovers. With Melo going one-on-one, and his league-leading usage rate, the Knicks offense stagnates. Ultimately, the most important player in the series was Hibbert. When he was in the game, the Knicks got virtually zero good looks in the paint. He also killed the Knicks on the offensive glass. The X-factor was Lance Stephenson because of his energy, finishing, and eight rebounds per game at the shooting guard position, which is huge.\n\nAs great as the Pacers were, the Knicks still had the talent to defeat them, but three things happened where they shot themselves in the foot. First, J.R. Smith basically had a John Starks game seven Finals performance every game since game four back in Boston. I have never seen a shooting slump last that long, especially at the least opportune time. He shot 29% since his suspension for the elbow to Celtics G Jason Terry. Yes, J.R. deserved to win his Sixth Man of the Year, but just didn’t show up in this series. They needed him to be that guy for at least a couple games.\n\nFactor two: C Tyson Chandler was playing hurt. He only averaged six points and six rebounds in the series — a little more than half of his season average. He was dominated by Hibbert, who grabbed rebounds right over him. Chandler was frustrated often, and argued with teammates for missing defensive rotations and leaving him on an island. So for the Knicks, if your Sixth Man of the Year and All-Star center don’t play as expected, you won’t win.\n\nThe third factor — and the most important one — is that head coach Mike Woodson may have been exposed as a coach who cannot make smart adjustments over a playoff series. Throughout the post-season, fans and media begged for F Chris Copeland (above right), and when he finally got in the game, he promptly lit up the scoreboard. Also, G Pablo Prigioniturned around the Knicks’ regular season when he was put in the starting line-up, and their perimeter defense and ball movement improved. Yet Woodson favored Jason Kidd, age 40, who brought very little to the table. It says a lot that Woodson was unable to add creativity to the offense to counter the strategies of Indiana and Boston. Woodson is a good coach and motivator, but maybe not the great late-season tactician that a team requires to advance. I think the Knicks need to hire a Moneyball-style advance metrics guy like John Hollinger to advise, because Woodson goes with gut over facts too often.\n\nDoc, are u in awe of Grizzlies F Zach Randolph? Do u feel that the Thunder were significantly hindered by the absence of Russell Westbrook?\n\nDOC: I loveZ-Bo. I love the whole Memphis team. They looked like the best team in the playoffs against OKC. Going back to John Hollinger, they might be the Moneyball team of the NBA — especially if they reach the Finals. That could call into question the NBA’s culture of superstar worship: A big name might sell tickets and jerseys, but the game and evaluation systems are evolving.\n\nIt’s amazing how Memphis and Indiana are so similarly put together. They are stocked with late first-round and second-round draft picks. Traditional centers and power forwards that play back to the basket, on the block. (We should note the return of the traditional center. Marc Gasol, Roy Hibbert, Joakim Noah, and Andrew Bogut were integral to their teams’ successes. It’s nice to see that position is not dead anymore. It will be interesting to see how Miami deals with dominant big men in forthcoming games.)\n\nIn this post-season, we learned a lot about Oklahoma City Thunder sans Russell Westbrook. First, he is the heart and motor of that team. Without him, they play slower and with less emotion and everyone has to work much harder for shots. Open shots for Serge Ibaka,Kevin Martin, and Thabo Sefolosha were created by Westbrook’s breaking down the defense and getting into the lane. Now Ibaka has been exposed as an incomplete player: Though a great shot blocker, he gets killed one-on-one against big, strong post players. His jumper is great, but he doesn’t have much else besides that. To make huge money and to have such athleticism, he has to improve. And the trade of James Harden is looking worse every day. I hope OKC is planning to amnesty Kendrick Perkins, move Nick Collison into a starting role, and do some retooling.\n\nDoc, how necessary for the Spurs is a fourth source of offense? Or are Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili more than enough?\n\nDOC: Parker, Duncan, andGinobli did fine when their team was eliminated last year by OKC — their problem wasDanny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Gary Neal, and Matt Bonner failed to hit shots that they had been hitting all season. (That and OKC’s big three just went crazy and couldn’t be stopped.) The Spurs need balance to be successful. That had been the key to their regular season dominance the last few years. The Spurs’ Hall of Fame trio can carry them for stretches, but are not what they used to be. They need help for sure.\n\nAbout ten days ago, I would’ve picked Memphis to reach the Finals, but once I saw how the Spurs closed out Golden State, I think they can beat Memphis. After all, the Grizzlies just barely eked out wins against a Westbrook-free Thunder team. Plus, Z-Bo and Gasol haven’t had to deal with a low-post threat in this post-season; they got to score at will in the paint, and then save their energy on defense. Now, Duncan and Tiago Splitter are better low-post scorers and defenders than they have seen all postseason. The Spurs have no real weaknesses. They can play fast or in the half-court, play very solid defense, and can beat you inside and outside. This will be an interesting series, and Memphis could win. Although, I would rather see San Antonio in the Finals, because of all the beautiful offense to watch. Plus you have the storyline of an old dynasty meeting a new dynasty ala ’91 Lakers/Bulls Finals. I would love to see San Antonio win another title.\n\n————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XXI – Posted Mar. 25th on Metalsucks.net\n\npro·fes·sion·al (prəˈfeSHənl) noun\n\na. A person engaged or qualified in a profession.\n\nb. A specialist, authority\n\nc. Doc Coyle, guitarist of God Forbid and NBA analyst\n\nHey friends welcome back to Hoop Logic, where NBA fans come to discuss the shit out of Earth’s greatest sport/Shakespearean drama: Professional basketball. Not boys basketball, not student basketball, not chuckerball played by college kids in front of screaming adults who will meet them again in a few years at an insurance seminar. Men’s basketball. Real basketball. Amateurs not welcome.\n\nBut hey you need not be a fancy NBA lover to party here! Cuz Doc Coyle, guitarist ofGod Forbid and all-around hunk, is a professional at this. That means you will be entertained, amused, challenged, and even titillated no matter your level of interest in big-time ball. Coyle is an expert, an ace, an authority, a maestro, brah! Read his science on the looming NBA post-season below.\n\n·\n\nDoc, in your professional opinion, have the Denver Nuggets gone from ”troublesome for top teams” to “major obstacle for championship hopefuls” thanks to Wilson Chandler’s recent awesomeness?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: The 2012-13 Denver Nuggets team is one of the most peculiar and unique collection of players I’ve ever seen. They are one of the most — if notthe most — athletic NBA teams ever. It’s unreal that they can run quick-as-lightning breaks even off of made baskets, and because their rotation goes nine or ten deep, they wear down teams with a barrage of energy that never stops. (The only rotation guys that are notincredibly athletic are Kosta Koufos and Andre Miller.) They don’t shoot it well from outside, but they hardly attempt shots from outside — they lead the NBA in points in the paint. These Nuggets take it to the hole to get efficient shots while sharing the ball very well (24 assists per game). And they are unstoppable at home with a 30-3 record, which is the league’s best as well.\n\nTo me, the biggest difference from last year’s squad is the impact of Andre Iguodala. He is by far the team’s best defender and all-around player. Also, he is a legit veteran with an All Star appearance and an Olympic gold medal. He is looked up to as a leader, and that has a stabilizing effect for any young team. And head coach George Karl deserves a great deal of credit in that he finally has a cooperative, capable team to run his system; as talented as the best Carmelo Anthony squads were, it had to be hell for a coach to get all of those egos to work together. Melo’s Nuggets teams were a tad thuggish — especially the year that Allen Iverson was there. The Nuggets GM, Masai Ujiri, is also looking like a savant for having won every trade in the last couple years: the Melo deal for Chandler, Danillo Galinari, and a first-round pick in next year’s draft; the Nenê/JaVale McGee swap, and the most recent Iggie/Dwight Howard/Andrew Bynum trade. They have a very solid organization.\n\nBut how will the Nuggets fare in the playoffs? Well, precedent is bad for a team of this composition. See, a playoff game usually comes down to a few key possessions in its waning minutes, so teams that have a definitive go-to guy have a clear advantage. Teams led by Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwan, Tim Duncan, Shaq, and Kobe Bryant account for 18 titles since 1991. That’s difficult to ignore. The only championship team with a truly balanced attack and no clear star was the 2004 Detroit Pistons led by Rip Hamilton, Chauncey Billups, and Rasheed Wallace. Though for some reason, this Nuggets team may come from a totally new mould. A team like Memphis could slow down Denver’s lightning pace and take them out of their stride. Conversely, OKC and San Antonio better watch out because Denver can keep up with both teams on offense and have the athletes to wear down anyone. This will be a fascinating playoff, especially once we find out the seeding.\n\n·\n\nIn your professional opinion, is the Miami Heat 26-game winning streak — the NBA’s second-longest ever — the result of great play or weak competition?\n\nDOC: Mostly it is a result of strong play. We are watching what might be one of the greatest teams in NBA history right now. First off, LeBron James, the best NBA player in the world, has never played better. He is in such a zone of focus and control that it is mesmerizing to witness. During the streak, I’ve seen him singlehandedly erase double-digit fourth-quarter deficits and hit game-winning shots against Orlando, Boston, and Cleveland seemingly at will. Dwyane Wade plays like the all-NBA performer that we’re used to seeing, and the team is actually healthy. It really took a few years for them to learn exactly how to play together and to embrace “small ball” with Chris Bosh at the center position. Their defense can be completely suffocating when they want it to be. The Heat are just a step above everyone else in the league right, but I am sure they are praying that they aren’t peaking too early and that no serious injuries creep up .\n\nThe streak has come in a soft part of the Heat’s schedule. It also helps that at this time of the year, many teams have given up their hopes for the post-season, so some of them check out for the year. These are the dog days of the NBA schedule. It’s important to keep in mind that as the reigning champs, the Heat have a target on their back. Most teams get up to play the Heat and bring their best effort. But they really do want to break the record 33-game win streak, which is one of sports history’s longest-standing records.\n\n·\n\nIn your professional opinion, what is the date of the next Miami Heat loss?\n\nI think this record is too difficult to beat. Teams get hot, teams get cold. For them to win another eight in a row seems unfathomable. Logic would tell you that Chicago (March 27) and San Antonio (March 31) have the best chance to beat the Heat, but they’ve already been beaten by the lowly Wizards early this year and nearly lost to cruddy teams like Cleveland and Orlando during this streak. Any team can sneak up on the Heat — especially if they get cocky. It has to be completely exhausting to keep up this level of play every game. I really hope they beat the record though. It would be incredible to witness something like that in the modern era.\n\n·\n\nIn your professional opinion, does it benefit the Knicks that their superstar Carmelo Anthony will miss a few weeks of action?\n\nDOC: When Melo was out but Tyson Chandler andAmare Stoudemirewere still healthy, the Knicks could hold on just fine in the interim. But with all three of these guys out, the Knicks don’t have a chance. I was stunned that they even beat the Jazz in Utah with Chris Copeland and Kenyon Martin in the starting line up. The tough truth is that any NBA team would be pretty bad without their big three stars. Imagine the Heat without LeBron, Wade, and Bosh, or OKC without Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka. The Knicks were not built to withstand this type of misfortune. Their frontline backups are old as dirt, and now that Sheed is done for year,Kurt Thomas hobbled, and Marcus Camby in and out, the Knicks are fully relying on Martin and hoping for Stat’s return for the playoffs. These are daunting prospects to say the least.\n\nTo answer your question, are the Knicks better without Melo? Hell no. They need him in order to be competitive, but he needs to play at the same level he did at the beginning of the year: His shooting has cooled every month, and the ball sticks as he takes more low-percentage one-on-one shots. That hurts overall ball movement. And lingering injuries have really effected his defense and hustle too. Overall, the Knicks have been exposed as an Isolation team that hoists lots of threes, and the Knicks haven’t adjusted to the scouting. They’ve scored more than 100 points twice in their last 12 games. With Miami’s recent dominance, and New York’s difficulties dealing with defensive teams like Chicago and Indiana, the playoffs could be very rough unless they are healthy and playing at the top of their game. It’s a shame because the potential is huge, but I foresee some serious retooling in the off-season, especially if they get bounced from the playoffs early.\n\n·\n\nIn your professional opinion, would it be a nasty retirement present to exiting NBA commissioner David Stern to have a ratings-killing Finals match-up of Pacers and Spurs?\n\nDOC: Let’s keep it real. Barring injury or a miraculous comeback for Derrick Rose, Miami is gonna steamroll the Eastern Conference. They are just in a different stratosphere than everyone else. So thatSpurs-Pacers matchup ain’t gonna happen! Hypothetically, Indiana would be a slightly brutal Finals team because their offense is just anemic. You could probably say that for most of the Eastern Conference, but I suppose it would be healthier for the league if a big-market East team reached the finals, like NY, Boston, Brooklyn, or Chicago. But as long as LeBron is in the Finals, I guarantee new ratings records — regardless of opponent.\n\nAlso keeping it real, let’s be the better men and stop this 2002 Spurs propaganda. In 2013, the Spurs are highly entertaining. They are no longer a slow, defense-oriented team. They are one of the best offensive teams in the game, and are the best passing team. Market wise, I think San Antonio still rates bigger than Oklahoma City, so it’s an even match in that regard since OKC carries a little more star power. I would love to see the Spurs advance. It would be great if their post-season performance can finally match their impeccable regular season play of the last three years. Out West, I will be rooting for Denver, the Clips, and even the Lakers to upset a high seed. I want as many rounds of Kobe beast mode as possible. Can you smell the playoffs? I can!!!\n\n–Doc Coyle, God Forbid\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XX – Posted Feb. 26th 2013 on Metalsucks.net\n\nHey MetalSucks ballers! Welcome to a brand new Hoop Logic with Doc Coyle, guitarist and backing vocalist of God Forbid! Well, the fun and showboating of All-Star Weekend is a memory, the trade deadline has passed, and for better or worse, teams are locked in for a wild ride to glory or gore. Let’s check in with Doc about all the latest action — and lack thereof — in our beloved NBA! Read on!\n\n·\n\nTHE FUTURE’S SO DWIGHT\n\nDoc, a hot topic leading up to Thursday’s trade deadline was the dysfunctional Lakers and their plans for C Dwight Howard. And despite their persistent troubles, they declined to make the trade to capitalize now before Howard enters free agency in a few months. Does this imply an intention to re-sign Howard?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: There has been a sentiment in the sports media that we shouldn’t be covering the Lakers so much because they haven’t been winning, and that other deserving teams should get more coverage. I couldn’t disagree more. The monumental underachievement by this pseudo-supergroup has been one of the most entertaining stories of this NBA season. Just Kobe Bryant‘s quotes alone are box office gold. The drama, the bickering … I love it.\n\nWith that said, I feel that the Lakers intend on retaining Dwight Howard long term. Of all of their stars, he is the youngest and easiest to build around. Even at 70%, Howard still leads the league in rebounding, shoots almost 60% from the field, and averages 2.5 blocks. I still think he is highly underutilized; the Lakers offense and defense work better when Howard is involved early and often: When getting consistent number of touches, he puts his opponents in foul trouble, creates space for shooters (not that the Lakers have many), and becomes infinitely more engaged on the defense. His only real weakness is turnovers — very sloppy with the ball.\n\nBut head coach Mike D’Antoni‘s offense does not work with two bigs on the court. When paired with Howard, Pau Gasol sucks (but he did great as a starting center when Howard was out with injury). It can be forgotten that Howard led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009 in a system built around him: pick and rolls surrounded by three-point shooters. Kinda sounds like what the D’antoni offense is supposed to be, huh?\n\nBut I think they were right to not have traded D12 — unless, in return, franchise-quality talent had been offered, or some kind of package for the Lakers’ win-now game plan for Kobe and Steve Nash‘s final years. Really, I believe that the Lakers should have traded Gasol, but his current injury screwed that up any way. Of course the Lakers are a better team with all of their weapons, but not when Gasol isn’t happy with his role and underperforms because of that. Plus they could’ve sought a stretch 4 (Ryan Anderson, Chandler Parsons) and a point guard to back up Nash and Steve Blake. That would’ve been an improvement.\n\nAnd the real question is will Dwight Howard stay with the Lakers at season’s end? He is mentally fragile and immature, and that will ultimately be his undoing unless he grows up quickly. Every team with cap space is going to go after him HARD. But I think he will re-sign because A) L.A. can pay him the most, and B) their reputation is built on the ability to retool and rebuild on the fly. Though if I was him, I would go to a young team in a smaller market with less scrutiny. He just does not mesh with Kobe — and I put that on Kobe. He’s the leader and he has to lead. Howard can’t be blamed for being a bad follower, can you? So I would love to see Howard move to the Houston Rockets. He would make them instant contenders in the West and would be very exciting to watch.\n\n·\n\nFUN AND ALL-STAR GAMES\n\nDid you find that last Sunday’s All-Star Game was less fun than usual?\n\nI have a theory about All-Star weekend. It’s starting to be like New Year’s Eve: hyped up to no end, and never as great as the amazing parties you had when you were young which are rose-colored with nostalgia. So a fan is set up to be disappointed from the get-go.\n\nActually I really enjoyed the All Star game. It was close all the way through and filled with competitors. Compared to the Rising Stars Challenge, the All Star game had a playoff-like intensity. Those guys have fun, but they also really like to win and respect the game.LeBron, KG, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, and Kobe are there to prove that they are the best of the best, and it shows. And I really liked the East reserves because they were all no-nonsense, scrappy hustlers; Joakim Noah, Tyson Chandler, Jrue Holiday, and Luol Deng don’t know how to turn off their competitive engine. Can you imagine Chandler or Noah not caring about defense? Defense is what they do. But the West just has more talent. When your bench is James Harden, Tony Parker and Russell Westbrook, it’s kind of not fair. By the way, how fucking good is Kyrie Irving? All-Star 2013 was his coming-out party. He is the heir apparent to Chris Paul, but perhaps more of a scorer then distributor.\n\nI didn’t get to watch the dunk contest live, but all I heard from friends and Twitter was that it was terrible. So I watched it the next day and found these claims to be exaggerated. It started great and ended great. Sure, there was a pretty bad lull in the middle because each guy kept missing and that killed the momentum. Plus, TNT analysts Charles Barkley,Shaq, and Kenny Smith were just killing the contestants. (They were hilarious though.) But look at the highlights — there were some amazing dunks. If it was LeBron, Dwyane Wade, Russell Westbrook, and Blake Griffin doing those same dunks, people would say it was a great event. Fans want superstars in the dunk contest. That’s what was great about the old contests. It was Jordan vs. Dominique. Dr. J and even Kobe. Also consider that at this point, it’s virtually impossible to be original without bringing some props or gimmicks into it. Guys are bigger, faster, and jumping higher — but it’s still very hard to come up with a completely new dunk. Cut ‘em some slack. We should just relax and enjoy what these guys can do, which is pretty damn amazing if you ask me.\n\n·\n\nSEATTLEMENTO KINGSONICS?\n\nIt’s been off and on the NBA radar for months, so who knows for sure, but the Sacramento Kings move to Seattle seems certain. Are you pumped? Will this juice their low-profile franchise?\n\nDOC: I have mixed feelings about the move. I have fond memories of Gary Paytonthrowing thunderous alley oops to Shawn Kemp for the old Sonics in the mid ’90s. Hell,Ice Cube even name drops the SuperSonics in “It Was A Good Day.” They were a great franchise with a loyal, rabid fanbase. They did not deserve to lose their team.\n\nOn the other hand, I also have fond memories of Jason Williams throwing monstrous alley oops to Chris Webber with the awesome Kings of the late ’90s-early ’00s. Now Sacramento has not been a particularly great franchise; they’ve had talented players, but haven’t really been able to put winning teams on the floor besides that Webber team or perhaps Mitch Richmond‘s Kings. And even without championship banners waving in the rafters, Sacramento fans have been dedicated. They do not deserve to be constantly fucked with by the Maloof brothers ownership. It seems like the city of Sacramento will give them whatever they want to stay in town, but they are pursuing the Seattle deal anyway.\n\nThere is no outcome that will work out for everyone. One city will win, the other will lose. But I am not in favor of expansion; 30 teams is perfect for the amount of NBA-level talent. Let’s not dilute it anymore to appease a city or for a money grab. And please don’t have a franchise in Europe. That doesn’t seem to have any logistical recourse to work.\n\n·\n\nINACTION PACT\n\nDoc, past trade deadlines had much more action than this season’s. What’s the story?\n\nDOC: The real story of the trade deadline is the absence of big-name trades. Although it happened well before the deadline, the most impactful trade was Memphis Grizzlies’ shipping F Rudy Gay to the Toronto Raptors. Memphis is considered to be a contender, so it seems illogical to deal their most talented player and leading scorer in the race for a championship. Then again, the Grizz recently hired numbers wizard John Hollinger, creator of the ESPN Player Efficiency Rating (PER), as vice president of basketball operations. That means this Gay move comes with a lot of dispassionate number-crunching regarding game and salary cap. In one of the NBA’s smallest markets, they have to be even more mindful of their cap situation than many teams — which is a shame. It’s good that they got Tayshaun Prince, although a contender like Memphis would have smarter to grab him a few years ago, close to his prime. Prince can play the same role asShawn Marion for the champion Dallas Mavericks team in 2010-11: Top defender and reliable scorer whom you don’t have to draw up plays for. I wonder how this is going to work playoff time without having that big gun …\n\nThe move straps Toronto cap-wise, but getting a player of Gay’s caliber is a big deal for the Raptors. They haven’t had a superstar since Chris Bosh, and Gay makes a nice young, athletic core with DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Who knows if C Andrea Bargnani will stick around, but perhaps he will produce a little better as a second option behind Gay. The Raps have an exciting team and have played great since Gay arrived. They definitely have a shot to make the playoffs, but this move is really about the future. I imagine there will be plenty of more moves by GM Brian Colangelo in the off-season. The Atlantic division will be very interesting when C Andrew Bynum gets healthy for the Philadelphia 76ers. I pray for my Knicks.\n\n–Doc Coyle, God Forbid\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XIX – Posted Jan. 31st 2013 on Metalsucks.net\n\nHey MetalSucks B-ball junkies! What’s up, this is Anso DF welcoming you to another awesomely excellent Hoop Logic with Doc Coyle of God Forbid. Come on in, lace up, run our lay-up line, take some shots, and get ready for the game!\n\nThis is an exciting time of year for us! Pesky NFL football is vacating our choice broadcasting hours. Unexpected excellence is persisting in sleeper teams and under-the-radar players. And best of all, fast approaching is our very special three days of screwing around, partying, and NBA camaraderie: NBA All-Star Weekend!\n\nI love every minute, the young stars matches and skills challenges, the cheery presence of evergreen Hall of Famers and drunk-ass Charles Barkley, the dunk contest and three-point challenge, the dazzling All-Star Game itself, supernovas Kobe and Durant, first-timers Tyson Chandler and Paul George, and ruffians Z-Bo and Joakim Noah. I’m pumped — and so is Doc, seer of all NBA truth. Feel the excitement below:\n\n·\n\nALL-STAR MADNESS, SADNESS\n\nHey Doc, two Thursdays ago the 2013 NBA All-Star team starting line-ups were unveiled. Which selections make u wish for a revision of the selection process?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: I have to say I’m not happy with the current process where fans vote for the starters. To be blunt, the fans are kind of dumb. It’s them who voted Yao Ming to the 2011 All-Star team when he hadn’t played one game that season, and then this year almost voted in Jeremy Lin — who is having an average season — over the NBA’s best point guard, Chris Paul. The NBA is very fan friendly and this will probably never change, but it’s frustrating when the deserving get left behind. Especially guys that may never have another chance at All-Star honors.\n\nWith that said, I think Kevin Garnett‘s selection really screwed up the East’s front court. KG is an all-time great in the midst of a fine season, but Boston has is under .500 and doesn’t deserve two All-Stars (and Rajon Rondo is a lock). Tyson Chandler (New York), Joakim Noah (Chicago), and Brook Lopez (Brooklyn) are having better seasons for teams with good records. Especially Lopez — his exclusion is a major snub. He is the NBA’s top-scoring center and the Nets’ best player this season, and his team’s record is very good. It’s even surprising that Chris Bosh was selected over Lopez. Although Bosh is shooting a career-high 54%, his other numbers are down slightly. Like KG, he is having a good year, but I lean toward the practice of getting new stars onto All-Star teams. I feel like the coaches — who vote on the All-Star non-starters — get used to voting for certain players and are less welcoming of new faces.\n\nAnd I am surprised that Chicago Bulls F Luol Deng was selected overJosh Smith of the Atlanta Hawks. J-Smoove is widely recognized as the most talented and accomplished NBA player to never make an All-Star squad. It seems like poorly-timed misfortune (his team’s nose-dive, a one-game suspension for “conduct detrimental to the team”) really hurt his seemingly inevitable All-Star selection. A bad reputation can really follow you in the league. It’s a shame. I smell a trade coming soon.\n\nNow as for the West, they mostly got it right. The Lakers do not deserve two All-Stars, but Dwight Howard’s numbers are still good enough to merit high consideration. Of course, the coaches would not have voted him in, especially since his reputation is not so great at the moment. So fan votes saved him, but it’s Tim Duncan who deserves to be the starter. And I’m sure a healthy Dirk Nowitzki or Kevin Love could have taken that spot if able. And then there’s the much-lauded Marc Gasol, who is great, but his teammate Zach Randolph has been the best player on Memphis this year. Well deserved for that dude.\n\nBut there’s an obvious snub in the West too: Golden State’s Steph Curry. The Warriors are great this year, and he is their heart and soul. His numbers are All-Star caliber and could easily get him on the East’s team; but in the West, he’s battling for the same spot as ChrisPaul, Russell Westbrook, and Tony Parker. That’s just not fair. Like I said, the coaches always go with the familiar faces in a pinch, but Steph Curry is as deserving as any of those guys. Maybe an All Star will be sidelined by injury and then Curry will get his due.\n\n·\n\nDoc, you are hereby charged with the task of selecting seven All-Star bench players for each conference! What say you, sir?\n\nDOC: I’ll pick three for the front line, two guards, and two wild cards for each conference:\n\nEastern Conference:\n\nTyson Chandler C New York Knicks\n\nJoakim Noah C Chicago Bulls\n\nBrook Lopez C New Jersey Nets\n\nJrue Holiday G Philadelphia 76ers\n\nKyrie Irving G Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nJosh Smith F Atlanta Hawks\n\nPaul George G Indiana Pacers\n\nWestern Conference:\n\nJames Harden G Houston Rockets\n\nRussell Westbrook G Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge C Portland Trail Blazers\n\nZach Randolph F Memphis Grizzlies\n\nTim Duncan F San Antonio Spurs\n\nTony Parker G San Antonio Spurs\n\nDavid Lee F Golden State Warriors\n\n·\n\nNBA ON TV: PRETTY, REPETITIVE, PRECIOUS\n\nDoc, let’s talk about the NBA viewer experience. NBA on ESPN deserves cheers for their jazzy new bumper music, but might you agree that they should reconsider that 24/7 sports ticker? Over two consecutive NBA games — six hours — a viewers eyes are drawn to the same headlines like 13 kajillion times!\n\nDOC: It doesn’t bother me that much. If I don’t care what’s happening with Women’s Lacrosse at Weber State, I tend to subconsciously ignore it. (I think my favorite thing was the Manti Te’o news rolling across the ticker. It reads like a middle schooler’s gossipy text message.) The ticker is almost obsolete though. If you’re a sports fan with a smart phone, you have a million apps to keep you up to date with your teams. I also check twitter in addition to the box score to get a more fleshed out moment-by-moment reaction from my favorite journalists.\n\n·\n\nAs a dude who has often travelled the US, do you love that an NBA viewer can revisit cities just by watching game broadcasts? Is your heart warmed by post-break exterior shots of beautiful cities like Minneapolis and Los Angeles?\n\nDOC: I have to say no. Anyone who has done an arena tour or open, parking-lot tour like Mayhem or Ozzfest will tell that those shows feel like groundhog day. An arena in Los Angeles looks just like the arena in Columbus, OH from the inside. Same thing with a parking lot looking out at a sea of people. Plus many of these arenas, fair grounds, and amphitheaters are in the middle of nowhere. Club tours are the ones where you feel like every show has its own personality.\n\nI may not connect to the geography of these places I see on TV, but I do notice that some NBA crowds are way more excitable than others. For example, I loooooooove watchingPortland Trailblazers home games. They have a real home court advantage because their people are so amped. I think the enthusiasm is more amplified in small markets. The same can be said for OKC, Denver, and Memphis. A viewer picks up a college game vibe. Those people are much more invested emotionally and I love that.\n\n·\n\nDoc, a few days ago began the best time of year for NBA fans: Sunday afternoon doubleheaders on ABC! Do u wanna have brunch with me and watch? How many mimosas u drink?\n\nI always get psyched for Sunday NBA to start. Sure, I like football, but B-Ball is my shit. While half of the country mourns the end of football, I relish that we get the whole spring to ourselves.\n\nAnd I fucking love brunch and mimosas, so count me in. I’m pretty sure I could polish off a pitcher. I haven’t drank in a month so this should be fun.\n\n·\n\nMARK JACKSON IS GOLDEN\n\nSpeaking of Sunday afternoon games: Former ESPN commentator Mark Jackson — once a Sunday first-team broadcaster with Mike Breen and Coach Jeff Van Gundy — took his debut coaching gig last season at the helm of the Golden State Warriors. This season, his squad is achieving way beyond their talents (25-15, fifth in the West). Are u surprised at their success and/or thrilled for Jackson?\n\nDOC: I expected that, along with the Warriors, the T-Wolves, Hornets, Wizards, and Raptors would take big steps this year because of their talent. Unfortunately, all of those teams from outside the Golden State have been hammered by injuries. They’re improving as they get healthy, but for now, the Warriors have achieved more than any of us thought.\n\nAt the beginning of this season, my main concern was the uncertainty about health, namely Steph Curry and Andrew Bogut. Curry has been there and has been great, but I didn’t think it was possible for them to be great without a healthy Bogut in the middle. Yet, a few things have made the Warriors very good:David Lee has proven that he is the real deal; people forget that he made an All-Star team as a Knick in 2010. He seemed like a guy like Monta Ellis or Kevin Martin who puts up great numbers with bad teams. Now his consistent 20-10 production is feeding a winning formula. I mean, who thought he would be a more productive power forward than Amar’e Stoudemire? Plus, Golden State has a solid supporting cast via Klay Thompson, Jarret Jack, Carl Landry, and rookieHarrison Barnes. The Warriors are not a great defensive team, but they have improved over previous years when it was just a perpetual shootout.\n\nSo if Bogut can come back strong, his Warriors could climb the ladder to the upper tiers of the Western Conference. They need him in order to become a great defensive team. As constructed, they must be considered a second-tier team. They just don’t have the star power or depth of headliners Thunder, Clips, or Spurs. If they can hold on to Curry, Thompson, and Barnes, than they have a nice young core to move forward.\n\n–Doc Coyle, God Forbid\n\n———————————————————————–\n\nHoop Logic XVIII – Posted Jan. 8th 2013 on Metalsucks.net\n\nThe holiday season is a time of giving and joy, and accordingly the NBA spent December a sleigh-load of amazing highlights, grin-and-bear-it gifts (srs), and hot, hot action. So there’s tons of knowledge for God Forbid guitarist and NBA super-expert Doc Coyle to discuss, dispel, dispute, and dispense in the new year’s first Hoop Logic! Make way or be posterized!\n\n·\n\nTHE CLIPPERS: POST-SEASON SUCCESS?\n\nDoc, the Los Angeles Clippers recently wrapped a 17-game winning streak, the longest this NBA season and in the team’s history. That’s awesome, but how do the Clips match up against the gatekeepers of the Western Conference top seed, the Spurs and the Thunder?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: Like many hoop junkies, I have been fascinated with this Clippers team since they traded for Chris Paul. I loved the idea of savvy, fundamental veterans like Paul, Chauncey Billups, and Caron Butler in the backcourt mixed with the high-flying, young front court of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. In its first season, this line-up soon lost Billups to an achilles injury, but the Clips still beat a stacked Grizzlies squad in one of recent history’s most furiously contested post-season series (before ultimately being steamrolled by the Spurs in the next round).\n\nI thought they looked good for this season, but I didn’t expect this good; few of even the brightest NBA minds predicted this level of success. Reasons that they are awesome:\n\n1. Chris Paul is at a LeBron- and Durant-level of talent. The guy just changes the culture of a franchise. I still dream of the possibilities if he’d been paired with Carmelo Anthony on the Knicks.\n\n2. Impact players Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Eric Bledsoe have improved significantly. Blake improved his outside shooting and developed a balanced game; DJ is a bigger threat in the low post, a more complete defender, and a key presence down the stretch (unlike last season); Bledsoe is proving to be a top reserve in the league.\n\n3. Their bench is performing at a much higher level. New additions Jamal Crawford, Matt Barnes, and Lamar Odom each is coming off a down year, and have meshed well to bolster the NBA’s best second team.\n\n4. Coach Vinny Del Negro has proved wrong the naysayers (including me). Perhaps Chris Paul makes any coach look good, but only until the post season when match-ups, adjustments, and late-game execution matter most.\n\nAre they contenders? Definitely. OKC retains a slight edge because they have the best player, the youth, and the experience as reigning Western Conference champs. Yet the Clippers have no glaring weaknesses except maybe Griffin’s and Jordan’s free throws and perhaps their team defense identity. Otherwise, these boys are right in the mix and the funnest team to watch.\n\n·\n\nTHE LONG CLIMB TO THE MIDDLE\n\nThe NBA is about superstars and powerhouse teams, but the saying goes that any NBA player is awesome and any team capable of awesome play. So Doc, have u been loving the lowly, young, mismatched but overachieving teams like the Pistons, Bucks, Trailblazers, and Bobcats?\n\nDOC: There are only a handful of “bad” NBA teams. A third of the league inhabits the middle class whose records hover around .500. There are a few great teams, and few crappy teams, and a bunch in the middle; I put the Bucks and Blazers in that middle class. Keep in mind the Blazers still have the young core they built to surround busted number-one pick Greg Oden and injury-plagued Brandon Roy; that for sure would have been a playoff team. Even now, their starting lineup is one of the better ones in the league, but not their bench; they are a key addition or two from becoming very dangerous.\n\nThe best lowly team to watch now is the Cleveland Cavaliers just for the existence of Kyrie Irving. The guy is an All Star despite the lack of talent around him. And if there’s one team that sucks but has the most potential, it is the New Orleans Hornets (soon to be New Orleans Pelicans). Their young core of Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, and Greivis Vasquez is very impressive — as long as Gordon can get healthy. Another great draft pick awaits them after this season, so I wouldn’t be surprised if these guys lunged up the ladder over the next few years. And coach Monty Williams is underrated. He’s young, positive, and patient — the perfect type of coach for a rebuilding team.\n\n·\n\nLILLARD LILLARD LILLARD\n\nOh hey speaking of the Trailblazers, we should discuss rookie PG Damian Lillard. On track for Rookie of the Year honors, the kid is renowned for his calm, poised pick-and-roll play. Are some ballers born cool?\n\nDOC: I think that’s the chicken-and-egg thing. In my experience, people with that reserved, even temperament get it via years of success at a particular skill. The confidence emerges from trial and error, and the ability to see the angles from having encountered and conquered the obstacles many times. To be confident at something you have no skill at is hubris and will yield mixed results.\n\nIt’s still hard to say what side of that coin Damian Lillard falls on; I may have to go find his high school footage. Remember that he didn’t come out of college until after his junior year, which is rare for lottery picks trying to capitalize on their earning potential. So he is older — and more experienced — than most NBA rookies. His game seems very refined: He shoots very well from distance, makes few mistakes, and is clearly the floor general though usually the youngest player on the court. His maturity is impressive, and it’s surprising that scouts didn’t pick up on these attributes beforehand. Of course, hindsight is 20/20.\n\nIf he reminds me of any player, it’s a young Chauncey Billups — though he may now be a better natural distributor than even CB4 at that age. (Chauncey went through a bit of an early identity crisis figuring out if he was a 1 or a 2.) They each have fundamentals down and are natural leaders, and have the ice coursing through their veins needed to hit big shots in tough late-game situations.\n\nBut Lillard’s demeanor is best compared to Hakeem Olajuwon’s. The Dream silently destroyed you with his play and never seemed distracted by emotions. Of course the Rookie Of The Year race is far from over; I am still curious to see what Hornets C Anthony Davis does in the second half.\n\n·\n\nWADE ON THE WANE?\n\nThe day after Christmas, Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade gave a belated holiday gift to Charlotte Bobcats PG Ramon Sessions: a random kick to the nuts. What followed was a game-suspension for Wade and a new look at his small history of cheap shots and sketchy hacks. Doc, do Wade’s recent actions seem to indicate that he is frustrated?\n\nDOC: It’s hard to say if this incident is related to an overall frustation of Wade’s. I don’t think he is in quite the decline that has been stated. Consider where he is coming from: Wade may be the most athletic person to ever play the shooting guard position. The guy was an absolute freak that lived above the rim, but is no longer the same after some knee issues. He went from being unstoppable to being merely one of the top players in the NBA. He’s great, but can’t do it every game now. Or he may just be coasting a bit until the playoffs.\n\nHas he lost athleticism, quickness, and lift? Yes, but he’s still in the top ten in scoring and shoots 51% from the field (a career high). As a player like Wade ages, his game has to evolve in order to be competitive now that he can’t just physically dominate the game. Kobe is the best example of this. Michael Jordan did the same thing. Unfortunately, D-Wade is not their class of shooter, but he will have to add other things.\n\nI see the frustration of being unable to do what he used to do with ease: Wade is one of the the biggest complainers when he doesn’t get a foul call. He’s a crybaby and it’s very annoying. There has to some heartache that comes with losing your superhuman powers, but he must let go. That kick was a bitch move — he needs to just play the game and stay smart. Luckily, he has LeBron to carry the load when he’s having an off-night.\n\n–Doc Coyle, God Forbid\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nHoop Logic XVII – Posted Dec. 14th 2012 on Metalsucks.net\n\nHey heavy metal people! It’s me, MetalSucks senior editor Anso DF, proudly directing your eyeballs to a very special MetalSucks Hoop Logic with God Fobid’s Doc Coyle! He’s not just an ace guitar player/teacher, awesome singer, cool dude, and black-belt bonermaster — he’s also a brilliant basketball mind and a sly rake. Take Thursday night, when I ribbed Doc about his state of Knicks Fan Total Worry (KFTW) but then bam, sure enough, a Knicks rout of the Lakers turned tense in the second half when Kobe and crew stabilized and threatened. JUST LIKE DOC SAID. So what other NBA assumptions can Doc endorse or debunk? Read on for a very special holiday edition of Hoop Logic TR00 or FALSE!\n\n·\n\nTR00 or FALSE? Joakim Noah is rad and hilarious but absolutely must put an end to hispost-score “gunslinger” routine.\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: I am going to be very diplomatic here. Joakim Noah is a player you love if he plays for your team — and absolutely hate when he’s playing against you. He’s one of the best under-the-radar talents in the league among centers. He’s a top-five defender at his position, perhaps the best passing big man that isn’t a member of the Gasol family, and a provider of the intangible intensity that leads to a winning spirit (like Tyson Chandler). His current line of 13.9 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 4.3 APG, 2.3 BPG, and 1.4 SPG, and his help keeping the Chicago Bulls’ record above .500 in Derrick Rose’s absence, will earn Noah serious All Star consideration and deservedly so. That’s the only reason he’s allowed to do the goofy ‘gunslinger’ move. Once Derrick Rose is back, and Noah doesn’t have to carry the team, I’ll be back on the Joakim Noah hater squad.\n\n·\n\nTR00 or FALSE The Lakers have a serious hustle problem and it starts with Howard.\n\nDOC: I am going TR00 on this question, but with serious reservation and humility because the Lakers debacle has stumped the brightest basketball minds around. First let’s be real, Dwight Howard has not been the dominant player we know, and that tells me he isn’t recovered from his back injury. Defense has been the Lakers main issue, and a three-time Defensive Player of the Year should clean up a lot of mistakes, but it’s not happening. D12 doesn’t have his lateral quickness and lift, which is imperative for the big man on a pick-and-roll and backline help defense. Even with all that, there seems to be some stink left on Howard from last season’s Dwightmare, and there is a lack of enthusiasm on the court with this team that is somehow filtered through him. His reputation has been hurt as a team player also with the uncertainty around his forthcoming free agency.\n\nLet’s be honest again: You do not have a super team if your super guys aren’t there. Steve Nash hasn’t played, Steve Blake is out for two months, Pau Gasol has been out — and was apparently playing hurt — and the bench hasn’t performed as advertised. The situation has just snowballed, and the air around this team has become toxic. Basketball doesn’t work when you aren’t having fun and you don’t believe. It’s wholly ironic that this L.A. team with major star power, with no point guards, and coached by Mike D’Antoni is tailspinning less than a year after the exact same scenario in New York. Is Jeremy Lin available to save the day?\n\nI believe they can turn it around. But a team of Kobe, Dwight, and spare parts won’t get it done. Unlike many, I am open to trading Gasol for a stretch 4 and a good back-up point guard. Sometimes it’s not about having the best players, it’s about having players that compliment each other the best. Dwight Howard needs shooters to space the floor, and the Lakers NEED a good back up PG in case Nash goes down again — and even when he’s healthy; at his age, he can’t play 35 minutes every night. That Toronto deal for Andrea Bargnani and Jose Calderon would cool some concerns even if each is a liability on defense. [Such a deal now may be endangered by Bargnani’s injury on Wednesday. — Ed.]\n\n·\n\nTR00 or FALSE Amar’e Stoudemire’s return will disrupt the Knick’s surprising successful run and bring his team crashing back down to earth.\n\nDOC: This is all I have been hearing from EVERYONE. It’s almost like there is a script going around. This echo-chamber analysis is weak as fuck, and I’m gonna set this straight: Amar’e’s return will take the Knicks to the next level, not backwards.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the best offenses in the NBA, but Amar’e will make it perhaps the league’s top offense. The shooting percentages of second and third options Felton and JR Smith are hovering around 40%, and this will hurt the Knicks in the long run. More shots for Stoudemire will make the Knicks offense much more efficient and raise their profile in the paint. Also, this gives NYC a true alternate go-to-guy while Melo rests. STAT struggled last year with no point guard to get him the ball in the right spots. Now he has three (!) pure PGs to run pick and roll, feed him all day, and make the game easy for him.\n\nI admit that Stoudemire is a weak defender, but in no way do I believe that he represent a real drop-off from Rasheed Wallace and Kurt Thomas, the old-timers now filling the gap at power forward and backup center. Plus you can’t count on the older players to stay healthy over 82 games. The Knicks will need depth in the front court.\n\nAnother thing that hasn’t been mentioned much is that the Knicks have won in spite of their low rebounding numbers. Melo is great at the 4, but for the long term the team needs big bodies there to match up against the front-court size of the Grizzlies, Lakers, and Nets. Even though Melo has been playing at power forward, he is usually guarded by the opp0nent’s small forward; having Amar’e there will not effect this dynamic, and will protect Melo from getting beat up guarding and boxing out bigs on the block all year.\n\nWhether Stoudemire is to come off the bench remains to be seen, but even that supports my last point: The Knicks were 6-1 with Melo and Stat starting together while Mike Woodson was coaching. All of the reported struggles were with the Mike D’Antoni no-point-guard team, the one that couldn’t find a way to integrate Melo and Amar’e because of the coach’s inability to adapt to his team. I have faith that Woodson knows his team and how to make it all work. This is finally the Knicks squad that we thought we were getting last year and had high expectations, so I’m still not sure how more talent could make you a worse team. If they stay healthy, getting Stoudemire back gives the Knicks a real chance to contend for a title. (Disclaimer: If I am wrong about this, I will have to eat some serious crow.)\n\n·\n\nTR00 or FALSE Durant and Lebron were named NBA Players Of The Month for November. For December, the most deserving are Zach Randolph and Raymond Felton.\n\nDOC: The big problem with being the world’s best two players is this: People stop being impressed with your god-like consistent production. Fans and pundits both tend to give more credit to players and teams that we have low expectations for, and not nearly enough credit to those that we expect a lot from. LBJ and Durantula are the best players in the NBA and it’s not even close, and they play for the best teams of their respective conferences. They are also the league’s top Player Efficiency Rating (PER) guys by a decent margin. The only other guy even in the conversation this season is Carmelo Anthony because of the Knicks great start and he alone is “the guy” on his team, and may have more overall value to his team with no Dwayne Wade or Russell Westbrook at his side. Purely as individual players though, Melo is LeBron and Durant’s equal only as scorers, but they are superior in every other aspect of the game. As great as Melo has been, if OKC finishes this season with the best record, Durant gets my MVP vote. Let’s not forget about Chris Paul as a dark horse if the Clips keep rolling.\n\nAs for Felton and Zach Randolph, those guys are having big years but just aren’t in the same class. Again, it’s a matter of expectation. Last year, everyone counted out Raymond Felton; let’s just say if I had a dollar for every fat joke I heard, I would be very prepared at strip clubs. The fact that Felton has pretty much returned to his 2010 form, and the Knicks are killing it goes against expectations and now the Felton bandwagon is full. It’s the same with Zach Randolph. He was unable to live up to his incredible 2010 playoff performance because of injuries last season. Now he’s even better than he was, and the Grizzlies are a real contender.\n\nI’ll give you another example of the expectations game: Last year, Knicks PF Amar’e Stoudemire was considered to be one of the most disappointing players because his PPG and FG% dropped sharply from his 2010-11 MVP candidate season. Yet he finished with a line almost identical to Chris Bosh’s (around 18 pts, eight boards, shooting roughly 48%). Bosh made the All-Star team easily, and wasn’t criticized — because his expectations and output were consistent from the previous season.\n\n·\n\nTR00 or FALSE ESPN commentator Hubie Brown is a lucid, insightful, sweet, logical, and nuanced NBA educator who continues to teach u stuff.\n\nDOC: Hubie Brown reminds me a lot of my grandfather, a basketball ref and coach, who taught me my fundamentals when I was a kid. Like my grandfather, Hubie is always educating you about the game. My favorite on-air team is Jeff Van Gundy and Mike Breen, but Hubie is best at expressing the logic behind the events. He may give you lots of numbers, but his research tells a story. So you not only learn what is happening, but why it’s happening. You can tell he is someone who has lived and breathed the game for most of his life. He’s not getting any younger, so let’s appreciate Grandpa Hubie while we still have him.\n\n·\n\nlol TR00 Or FALSE From noon to midnight on December 25, you will be watching NBAand tweeting!\n\nDOC: I’m not sure I can watch twelve straight hours of B-Ball glory, but the first three games are essential viewing: Celtics-Nets, Lakers-Knicks, and Thunder-Heat. That will be my Christmas present to myself, and my gift to you guys will be some snarky tweeting.\n\n————————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XVI – Posted Dec. 5th 2012 on Metalsucks.net\n\nFor such a young NBA season, there sure has been a lot of drama! Perpetual injuries, stalled returns, controversial coaching punished by huge fines, weird hair, a sane J.R. Smith … It’s like freakin’ Thunderdome on a 94 x 40 court! Now more than ever, we need a heavy metal NBA expert to make sense of this chaos. O wherefore shalt we find one? Ah that’s right — our hero Doc Coyle of awesome God Forbid is standing by like a much cooler John Claytonto dig in to the madness!\n\nThis is Hoop Logic. Take it, Doc!\n\n·\n\nInjured 76ers C Andrew Bynum has yet to suit up for his new team, but was set to resume practicing on Dec 10 — until it was announced that the former Laker is sidelined indefinitely after having further damaged his bad knees by bowling in his spare time. Doc, what’s your take on Bynum, who entered the NBA at age 17? Unfortunate or fuckheaded?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: Andrew Bynum is a giant fuckhead, which just happens to be unfortunate. Obviously, the red flag for him is his injury history due to bad knees. This is especially worrisome for someone so young — only 25 — who should be entering his prime, one that seemed to arrive last season with his stellar, All-Star-level play. The injury history is not his fault, but it made this trade very risky. And so far, it looks like a complete bust. I feel sorry for the Philly fans because the team they broke up had a lot of promise, and pushed the Celtics to seven games in last year’s playoffs match-up. Sure, Bynum could eventually return and turn the whole thing around, but a fan just prays this doesn’t turn into a Greg Oden/Yao Ming situation where huge potential is never fulfilled due to injury.\n\nBut on the other hand, Andrew Bynum is the poster child for the rich, spoiled, immature modern athlete. To me, his personality was summed up when he viciously elbowed 5’9″ JJ Barea in the last game of the Lakers’ 2010 playoffs run. Bynum’s a brat who would rather flip the board than take the loss like a man. And worst of all, he bullied the smallest guy on the court; and that’s when he’s not saying arrogant, ignorant things to the media, avoiding team huddles, and showing up former coach Mike Brown by taking three-pointers in important game moments to just to make a point.\n\nHis newsworthy haircuts are entertaining (especially the brand new pimp slickback), but I just hope for the Sixers that the trade pans out soon. Bynum has the talent to be the best center in the NBA, but if his health and maturity don’t make some serious strides, it will be a long, rough road. Keep in mind, that Philly has not re-signed him yet. If they get cold feet, Bynum could be history at the end of this season. Acquiring talented injured guys has not worked out well of late. Look at the Eric Gordon and Andrew Bogut situations.\n\n·\n\nSpeaking of bad behavior, Celtics PG Rajon Rondo was suspended two games for a scuffle with Nets Kris Humphries and Gerald Wallace. It started with a hard foul on Rondo’s teammate Kevin Garnett, and spilled into the seats. Doc, can u speculate on something? Do u think Rondo overreacted because he’s aware that Garnett is brittle, and that a Garnett injury — resulting from, say, a hard foul — would doom the Celtics to missing the playoffs?\n\nDOC: Rondo is a warrior, and so is Garnett. They go to war and they have each other’s backs. Rondo explained that he was injured on a similar play in the playoffs a couple years back, and it set him off when he saw the hit. When a player is up in the air like that, he’s susceptible to dangerous injury — especially when he can jump really high. Frankly, I don’t think the Humphries knock-down was too serious, but the Celtics do not like KrisHumphries. The fans do not like Kris Humphries. I DO NOT … never mind. He’s a pretty good player, great rebounder, and likens himself to be something of an enforcer. So hard fouls are his trade. So what if he has a jerkoff face and talks like a valley girl?\n\nYeah, I guess I don’t like him either.\n\nRondo has to learn to cool it out. This is his third suspension in 2012 and it costs the Celtics wins. The Celtics obviously need Garnett to win, but that’s the coach’s job to monitor his minutes. Perhaps play him less at Center, so he takes less of a beating down low. They turned it on second half of last season, and I expect the same this this year. For some reason, this new group has not clicked just yet. New additions Jeff Green, Courtney Lee, and Jarred Sullinger have yet to show the prowess displayed in the preseason. Perhaps it’s just chemistry slow to coalesce. This team has a lot of talent, but people are not playing their best. Coach Doc Rivers put the ball in Rondo’s hands literally and figuratively. He’s the leader now. Rondo needs to stop starting fights and padding his assist numbers, and run the show by leading by example. He is too good not to.\n\n·\n\nFor the last game of a string of six road games in nine nights – including four in five nights — Spurs mega-coach Greg Popovich rested their trio of superstars and young stud Danny Green against the Heat on Thursday. On Friday, NBA commissioner David Stern fined the team $250,000 for this “disservice to the league and its fans.” Doc, is your vibe on this basically “Are u fucking kidding me?” Is Stern’s message to coaches basically “Do not fuck with NBA ad revenues and ticket sales”?\n\nDOC: I actually see both sides of this debate, but this is a very important conversation to have. Much like the rescinded Chris Paul trade for “basketball reasons,” this decision seems to follow no strict set of rules. David Stern comes off as tyrannical in this case because there is no precedent for the penalty. Is he King Stern, Emperor Stern? It’s public perception of the commissioner’s power reach and arbitrary policing that frustrate media and fans. I think this would not have been blown up so much if they would have waited after the game to announce the grievance, or just done it quieter in general. It came off as a knee jerk, emotional reaction.\n\nFrom Popovich’s perspective, he has every right to rest his aging players whenever he wants. That’s his prerogative as head coach. And if anyone deserves leeway, it’s Greg Popovich: He is the longest tenured head coach in all four major sports in the USA and has won four NBA Titles. Also, if you followed this team the last few years, you would know that this is nothing new: Pop periodically rests his oldest players to keep them fresh for the postseason. Although I’m still not sure why he rested Danny Green …\n\nPop’s error was the timing of his decision to rest these guys. Sure, it was the fourth game in five nights, but the Spurs know there is a national TV game with Miami on the schedule. These are two championship contenders that only meet twice per season. Pop should have known to rest the guys the night before against Orlando — or in any of their previous three games against lottery teams. Coach Popovich broke an unwritten rule. Now they may have to write a rule.\n\nPop’s actions displayed a lot of hubris in my opinion. As a fan, it pissed me off. This is supposed to be one of the best games of the year. Although it ended up being a competitive game, we were robbed of the match-ups that we want as fans. Yes, do not fuck with ad revenues and ticket sales because that’s what pays salaries. People buy tickets and companies buy advertising time with an expectation of a certain product. If a guy is truly hurt and can’t play, people are disappointed, but they understand. This undermines the NBA brand.\n\nThis has brought up another debate about whether the NBA season is too long with too many games in a short space causing injuries and fatigue. I think the season could stand to drop 10-15 games. It would protect the players better, and make the games more meaningful.\n\n·\n\nOn the other side of the coin, are u proud of J.R. Smith these days, whose apathy and immaturity of seasons past is being replaced with focus and smothering defense? How gratifying is it to u that Smith has been vital to the Knicks’ early-season success?\n\nYou have to keep in mind, I was a huge fan of Nuggets team of a couple years ago with Melo, Chauncey Billups, Nene, K-Mart, Birdman, and of course Mr. J.R. Smith. He was always one of my favorite players for his instant energy and instant offense. He had so much fire, and you knew a highlight reel dunk was on the horizon. But then his evil twin would appear, and Bad J.R. doesn’t get back on defense, takes bad gambles in the back court, getshit with technical fouls for bitching at refs, gets into fights, and shoots you right out of a game with off-the-dribble fadeaway three-pointers with 16 seconds left on the shot clock.\n\nHe hasn’t really changed that much, but a big difference is his relationship with coach Mike Woodson. Yes, J.R. is a couple years older, but Woodson really has a way of stabilizing Smith. He is very tough, and will chew J.R. out if he lazes on the defense , but he also has enough confidence in Smith’s offense to give him a virtual free reign. That was never there in Denver. There was always a short leash. He and Nuggets coach George Karl would butt heads constantly.\n\nWoodson is a father figure for J.R. and that emotional connection goes deep. Smith actually signed with the Knicks below his market value because New York is where he wanted to be. That goes a long way. When you have guys that are on your club with a real sense of loyalty to the team and city, you have a distinct advantage. Money can only motivate you so much. I really hope he keeps it up because he has enough physical talent to be an All-Star.\n\n– Doc Coyle, God Forbid\n\n————————————————————————–\n\nHoop Logic XV – Posted Nov. 19th 2012 on Metalsucks.net\n\nWe are only two weeks deep in the 2012-13 NBA season, and yet fast changes abound! The superstar Lakers pulled the plug on their flailing head coach, the defending almost-champion Oklahoma City Thunder moved a major piece, and the league’s most powerful teams are … the Knicks and the Grizz?! Okay fuck it why not!\n\nNow let’s send this wildness over to God Forbid guitarist/superhunk Doc Coyle, our MetalSucks NBA hoops expert, for a dose of clarity on this already bananas action! He’ll know what to make of it! lol\n\n·\n\nAfter five games, the high-powered, high-priced Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Mike Brown and enlisted Mike D’Antoni, an offense-first coach who was ousted from the New York Knicks mid-season last year. Doc, u have the benefit of a Knicks fan’s insight: Is D’Antoni the right coach for Kobe and crew?\n\nDoc Coyle, God Forbid: It’s difficult to say right now. In New York, Coach D’Antoni was set up to fail when the team he built was dismantled by the Knicks’ trade for Carmelo Anthony. So D’Antoni went from a squad of young run-and-gun guys to a mismatch of stars and a thin bench made thinner in the trade. Then last season, expectations skyrocketed for the NBA’s best frontline on paper, but the Knicks floundered with no point guards to ably run D’Antoni’s system.\n\nThen you saw how the Knicks flourished with phenom Jeremy Lin; finally they’d found the right PG. But I don’t think D’Antoni could’ve made the situation work, and given the missing pieces and the flurry of injuries, perhaps no coach could. Eventually his spirit was broken, and he lost his team mentally and emotionally in the locker room. He did the right thing by stepping down. New coach Mike Woodson fits this Knicks team better.\n\nAs for the Lakers, let me first say that I do not like Mike Brown as a coach. He failed to gameplan properly in those last couple post-seasons as head coach for Lebron’s Cleveland Caveliers. The Xs and Os seemed shoddy. But above all, he is not a coach who inspires players in the way that Doc Rivers, Doug Collins, or George Karl does. Those guys put their hearts into the game, while Brown seems fake and disingenuous. I was happy to see him go.\n\nWhich brings us to today. The Lakers’ issue in their awful first five games under Mike Brown was defense. Not offense. Everyone knows that Mike D’Antoni’s teams can put points on the board, but does Lakers personnel fit with his system? He’s never run a team that has two back-to-the-basket bigs like Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard. I can’t imagine the Lakers as a fast break team because of their age and lack of foot speed. I really wish they would have re-signed PG Ramon Sessions; Steve Blake is not an adequate back up to Steve Nash.\n\nD’Antoni’s teams are notorious for bad defense. I wonder if Lakers brass figured that D12 can clean up everyone’s mistakes, but he is not at full strength after a back injury. I wonder if D’Antoni can get the defense under control; I am skeptical about that. So this hire is curious to me, especially when Phil Jackson was available. Jackson’s resume speaks for itself while D’Antoni has never even taken a team to the Finals. Big-time pressure will be on D’Antoni and the Laker’s front office to deliver immediately.\n\n·\n\nSpeaking of the Knicks, New York’s finest is 5-0 as of this writing. Are u blown away? What does this mean for injured PF Amar’e Stoudemire?\n\nDoc: I am slightly blown away. As I am writing this, they just came off a massive comeback win against San Antonio on the road to put them at 6-0. A Knicks fan always waits for the other shoe to drop. I am taking it with a grain of a salt; after all it’s a six-game winning streak that gets more attention for arriving at the season’s start. They could go lose five in a row and put themselves back at the middle of the pack. But I think there are a few things that should sustain:\n\nFirst, Carmelo Anthony is playing like an MVP. He leads the league in scoring, rebounds like a beast, and shows a focus on defense that we’ve never seen from him. Second, their three-headed point guard attack (Raymond Felton, Jason Kidd, Pablo Prigioni) gives them the advantage of always having a floor general on the court who knows how to set up scorers. Third, defense has been unbelievable. Partially because of Mike Woodson’s leadership, and because of hard-working defensive experts like Tyson Chandler, Ronnie Brewer, and Rasheed Wallace. Fourth, confidence and chemistry: These Knicks believe they can compete with the best and actually like each other. That true team spirit can go a long way.\n\nI think Amar’e will fit in nicely when he returns from knee surgery. But for that to work, he has to be eased back in — perhaps coming off the bench for 15-20 minutes. Their second team could use his scoring through lulls when Melo is on the bench. The point guards will get him involved and make the game easy for him. In fact I am really excited for his return, but still he has to buy into Knicks defensive schemes. That’s the key. The offense will come no problem. With a healthy Amar’e and Iman Shumpert, the Knicks could be contenders for real. That will address two concerns: Having a true number-two scoring option and a lockdown wing defender to handle the D-Wades and Kobes of the world.\n\n·\n\nThe other most buzzed-about team in this young NBA season is the Memphis Grizzlies. Doc, how do explain their ability to continue last season’s good groove? An underdog’s vigor? Veteran wiles? Lack of OJ Mayo? lol\n\nDoc: People who follow the NBA know that Memphis is on the verge of being a true contender. Their starting five is one of the best in the NBA. Man to man, they probably have the true best front court in basketball. Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph really do it all. They are skilled scorers, rebounders, defenders, and passers. And I hope this is the year underrated Rudy Gay finally makes an All-Star team. Mike Conley and Tony Allen are pure athletes and tops steals guys every year.\n\nI was concerned about how they would replace OJ Mayo’s scoring punch, but I watched their win against OKC, and their bench looks great. I was unfamiliar with most of them, but it was impressive to see them single-handedly win a big game for Memphis. Wayne Ellington, Jerryd Bayless, Quincy Pondexter, and Maurice Speights look like a legit second unit. I will watch them more this season to learn more about these guys.\n\nOh and consider this about Memphis: Two years ago when they reached the Western Conference Finals, they did so without Gay, and last year’s playoff run came despite a hobbled Zach Randolph. So, this is the first time their starting unit has been healthy, and it is all coming together for them. This is definitely a team to watch because they can match the Thunder’s speed and the Lakers’ size.\n\n·\n\nWe need to talk about James Harden’s trade to the Houston Rockets and a stratospheric debut performance for his new team. What does your crystal ball foretell for Harden, the Rockets, and his old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder?\n\nDoc: James Harden looks like a superstar in his first two weeks with his new team. We all knew he was good, but perhaps we underestimated his true talent. He automatically makes the Rockets a bubble team to make the playoffs, and here’s why: Jeremy Lin was not ready to be the go-to-guy, and the addition of Harden relieves some pressure. Houston is in a great position in that they are very young and have tons of cap space to sign more free agents. Kudos to the resilience of their front office in finally landing a star after striking out with both Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol. I predict that they will sign another big time free agent in the next year or two and become an top-tier team in the West.\n\nSee, one thing we are starting to see already is a scouting report on how to stop the Rockets, Harden in particular; they don’t have a lot of guys that can create for themselves besides The Beard and Linsanity. They aren’t deep, but this team is young and full of potential. I look forward to watching them develop.\n\nOn the other hand, the Thunder’s prospects are not as bright as they were a year ago. Their end of the Harden move, Kevin Martin, will more than make up for Harden’s 16 ppg, but not his ball-handling, passing, and perimeter defense. Don’t get me wrong, the Thunder are still NBA cream of the crop, but they’d had a dynasty brewing with that young core. I would have preferred the Thunder go after another guy in the Harden mould who does everything: Tyreke Evans. Though the yield is fantastic for the Thunder in the long run: lottery pick Jeremy Lamb and three future draft picks. So, great deal for the future but just passable for the present. The other good news is that back-up point guard Eric Maynor is back from last year’s season-ending injury and will provide some playmaking in the second unit. This is still a major dent in the Thunder’s armor. Their grasp on the Western Conference title is vulnerable, and with the Lakers, Grizzlies, Clippers, and Nuggets all improving, this conference is up for grabs.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nHoop Logic XIV – Posted Oct. 30th 2012 on Metalsucks.net\n\nIt seems like eons have passed since mid-June, when LeBron James’ Miami Heat were crowned champions of the strike-shortened 2011-12 NBA season. But tonight, a new season tips off after a trade-frenzied off-season. And returning to MetalSucks is God Forbid guitarist/vocalist Doc Coyle, our super-brah and resident NBA expert! Below, get the real deal on all the unlikely changes to Western and Eastern Conference superpowers. What teams are better, and which are merely bigger? Read on, ballerz!\n\nTHE LOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\nThe Los Angeles sports media is predicting a Lakers championship this season delivered by an all-superstar starting line-up. But Doc, is this Lakers squad an example of too much of a good thing? Or will their play resemble Globetrotters-esque domination?\n\nDOC COYLE, God Forbid: On paper, the 2012-13 Lakers feature one of the best starting line-ups ever. Never before have two former MVP’s been featured in the same backcourt. Kobe is considered to be the best of his era. Steve Nash is probably neck at neck with Jason Kidd as the best PG of his era. Pau Gasol may be the most skilled seven-footer in the NBA, and I haven’t even mentioned the team’s best player, Dwight Howard, the most dominant center since Shaq. Even the fifth guy, Metta World Peace, is a former All-Star and Defensive Player of the Year. It makes me a little giddy just thinking about the offensive options they have, and how Howard makes up for so many mistakes on defense as a rim protector. I watched this line-up’s preseason debut against Sacramento, and it was impressive for their first game together and not having formed a real chemistry yet.\n\nI don’t think you can have too much of a good thing, but here’s the question: Do the pieces fit? The Boston Big 3 of Pierce, Garnett, and Allen fit like a glove and won a championship their first season together. The Miami Big 3 of Wade, James, and Bosh have it down to a science now, but it took time. New York Knicks Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire still haven’t figured it out and they may never. But I think the new Lakers fit together very well: Nash and Howard don’t really need to score a ton to dominate the game. Nash is as a good a pure facilitator as we’ve even seen and will get his teammates the best looks. Howard can control a game just as a rebounder and defender. Kobe probably has to adjust his game the most because he won’t have the ball as much; he will have to play off the ball more, which as we saw in the Olympics can mean mixed results. Gasol will have a great year because he is off the trading block; he will be focussed and will have a lot of room to work while so much attention is paid to Howard.\n\nAs formidable as these guys are, we can’t yet anoint them champions-to-be for a few reasons. First off, Miami, OKC, San Antonio, and Boston are too good to be written off. Secondly, though the Lakers improved their bench with nice additions of Antawn Jamison and Jodie Meeks (and the return of Jordan Hill), we still wonder about the drop-off in production from the starting line-up’s. The second unit looked very rough in the pre-season. Thirdly, this team’s age is significant, and one injury could ruin the whole deal. The only player of their big four still in his prime is Dwight Howard, with Kobe and Gasol at the tail end of their best days. The Miami Heat’s big guys are all in their prime, which is why they are so intimidating. If 38-year-old Steve Nash goes down, who do runs the Lakers’ point? And I wonder if a young, quick team like the Thunder or Nuggets could run these old Lakers legs out of the gym over a playoff series. This is going to be fun to watch.\n\nTHE NEW JERSEY BROOKLYN NETS\n\nAt last, the Nets are set to start fresh with a new arena, a new town, and a new look. But what about the talent? Do the Brooklyn Nets have enough firepower to threaten the reigning champion Miami Heat?\n\nDOC: Like the Lakers, the new look Brooklyn Nets boast one of the best starting fives on paper. I watched a little of their preseason and it looked like they’re searching and figuring out how to play together. From the outside looking in, it appears that their strengths compliment each other very well with defined role for each starter: I think we know what Deron Williams is going to bring. He’s a top-five point guard, a franchise player in his prime. A big question is will F Joe Johnson’s performance match his giant contract? His statistics have declined every year, although his skills are not in question. Brook Lopez has not reached his full potential, but let’s hope he can stay healthy and learn to grab a rebound or two.\n\nGerald Wallace and Kris Humphries are two of the best hardhat guys in the league: Though on the decline and overpaid, Wallace still is a nice starting 3 who brings it on both ends of the court. Humphries is underrated and one of the NBA’s best rebounders. I also love Marshon Brooks as a sixth man. He’s definitely one of the nice young talents in the game. Also I like their bench on paper, but I haven’t seen them play much.\n\nSports media is high on this team and ranks them as the Eastern Conference’s third- or fourth-best team, which is a bit bold. I would like to see more of their play, but for now I like this team much more in Brooklyn than New Jersey — and I’m from Jersey. Did I mention how sick their uniforms are? They might have the best look in the league. Coolness counts; look how many people rock Raiders gear all over the country. The Nets are the cool kids on the block for sure.\n\nTHE CHICAGO BULLS\n\nIn the off-season, the Bulls parted ways with key role players Omar Asik, Kyle Korver, CJ Watson, and Ronnie Brewer. In their places are old-ass Nazr Mohammed, underwhelming Marco Bellinelli, basic Kirk Heinrich, and occasionally impactful Nate Robinson. Doc, do you foresee success for the Bulls’ core of Carlos Boozer, Luol Deng, Rip Hamilton, and superstar Derrick Rose (who will miss much if not all of the regular season)? Do those weak acquisitions indicate that the organization is cutting losses for this Rose-less season and shoring up for the 2013-14 season?\n\nDOC: If I ran the Bulls, I would tank this season and try to get a top pick in next year’s draft. (Like what the San Antonio Spurs did to set themselves up to draft Tim Duncan after David Robinson was out a whole season.) The departed role players were very important to their success last season. For some reason, the Bulls played great the last couple seasons regardless of who was on the floor. They were insanely consistent when they shifted to the reserves. (Some argue that Taj Gibson should start over Carlos Boozer.) Perhaps like the Spurs, it is the system and defensive culture of head coach Tom Thibodeau that cultivates success, and not the individual players.\n\nTime will tell. For now, they have brought in some solid guys though none really stand out. Although, I really wish Nate Robinson would get a fair shot from some ball club. After all, he was a real spark in Boston’s 2010 Finals run, but with the Thunder he was superfluous behind back-up point guard Eric Maynor. The kid can flat out score and plays as hard as anyone in the NBA.\n\nI am really pulling for Derrick Rose. His excellence and demeanor make him a type of athlete that we should all root for. He has heart. But I am skeptical about his return. Outside of Thunder PG Russell Westbook, no other guard out there relies on explosiveness and athleticism as much D-Rose. I hope the B-Ball Gods are kind to him.\n\nTHE NEW YORK KNICKS\n\nAside from last season’s brief period of Linsanity, the Knicks’ point guard situation was disastrous. So are u pumped about the arrival of ancient-but-stabilizing Jason Kidd and the return of Raymond Felton? Will the Felton-Stoudemire tandem flourish under coach Mike Woodson as it did in former coach Mike D’Antoni’s run-and-gun system?\n\nFrom what I saw in the preseason, I believe the Knicks have turned their biggest flaw into what may be their biggest strength. First off, Raymond Felton looks unbelievable. He dropped 20 pounds, so doubts about his conditioning need to stop: It’s not last year, and this isn’t Portland. He wasn’t happy there and he never wanted to leave the team he played his best basketball for: The Knicks. Now he’s moving quick, getting good shots at the rim, and passing at a high level. He is better than Jeremy Lin and a better fit for this team. He is less prone to turning over the ball and a much better defender.\n\nBut the Knicks’ depth at the point guard position is their strength. It feels like there’s a big backlash against Jason Kidd and other Knicks acquisitions, but Kidd looks sharp, active, and agile, and the team’s most undervalued addition may turn out to be veteran point guard Pablo Prigioni from Argentina. Prigioni impressed mightily in the preseason via a pure point guard’s court vision, his knack for crafty steals, and his mastery of the pick-and-roll. He and Kidd are very similar in their approach, and they create a good redundancy. If one point guard gets hurt, the Knicks have got it covered. This three-headed monster could be the secret to the Knicks’ success.\n\nAnd if Stoudemire can get healthy, I predict that Felton will reinvigorate his career. Besides, Stoudemire’s regression was overblown. Most of his poor play and lethargy came in the first half last season when his conditioning was poor and he was too bulked up above the waist, and that limited his lift and explosiveness. But Stat’s shooting percentage was eight points higher after the All-Star break, and his drop in points-per-game was only because he just wasn’t getting as many shots. He needs to be utilized more or he drifts when not getting enough touches. (I would love to see him coming off the bench where he can be the Knicks’ go-to-guy for offense.) But the major issue with Stoudemire is defense. He is one of the worst defenders in the league, and the Knicks will never be taken seriously unless that improves.\n\nUltimately, this team needs to be healthy to have any shot at playoffs success. Their age becomes a factor when injuries creep up. Last season, they were ravaged by post-season time and are almost no better right now: Stoudemire is out for a couple weeks, Iman Shumpert is out ’til January, and both JR Smith and Marcus Camby are questionable for opening night. It’s hard to say what they are until we see the full compliment of talent on the floor.\n\nTHE MIAMI HEAT\n\nThe world champion Miami Heat added two dangerous weapons on offense, Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis. Doc, was this what they needed? More shooters?\n\nWhen you have LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh — superstars who constantly require help on defense — adding shooters can only help. Those three guys are so consistent that when one or two other guys step up, the Heat are almost unbeatable. If Ray Allen can provide 12-15 PPG off the bench, that will be something the Heat could not count on in the last two seasons. This is the perfect situation for Ray because he doesn’t have the same pressure to score as in Boston. If Rashard Lewis from 2008 shows up from time to time, these guys will be straight up scary. The Heat have improved for sure.\n\nOne issue for me is the durability of guys like Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, and Mike Miller. I love their tenacity and vigor, but each is getting up there in years and could continue breaking down. And the Heat are still small up front, so what happens if they meet the Lakers in Finals? People forget that in 2009 a Dwight Howard-led Orlando team sent LeBron’s Cavs packing; that could happen again. Also, Andrew Bynum and the Philadelphia 76ers could be a troubling playoff matchup. A truly dominant center is a challenge this Heat team has not faced — no, Pacers C Roy Hibbert was not a real obstacle.\n\nMany seem ready to crown the Heat again, but many of these dipshits also counted the Heat out when they fell behind in each of last season’s playoff series. They are not unstoppable: Boston, L.A., OKC, and San Antonio all have a chance — and a dark horse could rear back and trample. So I could not be more excited about this NBA season. Even the “bad” teams are talented and fun to watch. (Well not Charlotte, but you get my point.) This is gonna be a hell of a year — if we survive December 21st 2012 of course.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nHoop Logic XIII – Posted June 28th 2012 on Metalsucks.net\n\nWelcome to the final 2011-12 Hoop Logic with ace axeman and peerless prognosticator Doc Coyle from awesome God Forbid. The NBA season is over and that is sad. But as we look ahead to um tonight’s draft and Halloween’s new season tip-off, we can rest assured that finally Lebron James is happy! And all the jerks whom he antagonized with his young man’s cockiness can shut up and enjoy NBA life again.\n\nSo while all butts are slowly purged of hurt, we thank you, MetalSucks reader, for joining us in ceding NBA life to summer, in bidding adieu to this frantic strike-altered, injury-pocked season, and in making sense of Lebron’s farewell to futility. See you after the jump!\n\n***\n\nNBA CHAMPION MIAMI HEAT\n\nDoc, Lebron James was awesome in the NBA Finals and at long last has netted his first championship. Can his detractors agree unequivocally that he is a real man now?\n\nI’ve been a fan since I first saw 22-year old Lebron in the 2007 Finals against the Spurs. He didn’t play that well and the Cavs were swept, but his abilities reinvigorated my interest in the NBA. I had never seen a player like him before. He was like Magic Johnson with Karl Malone’s physique and Michael Jordan’s speed, scoring ability, and athleticism.\n\nFrom a playing standpoint, LBJ’s trangressions were his subpar performance in the 2010 Eastern Conference semis against the Celtics and his failure to have any impact in the 4th quarters of the Finals against the Mavericks in 2011. As a public figure, he rubbed the entire world wrong by leaving his home team on national television in “The Decision” and the Miami Heat’s subsequent coronation party where LeBron predicted as many as seven championships. He has warranted plenty of deserved criticism, but not this monumental witch-hunt. I think it’s really unhealthy to wish for the failure of someone who hasn’t done anything to you personally. It says a lot about our mentality.\n\nLeBron’s detractors are a bit like Birthers. No matter how many official Hawaiian birth certificates are released, they will probably never believe. Some of my best friends are ardent, self-pronounced LeBron haters and being a LeBron hater seems to be a kind of immovable philosophy, a religion of some sorts. I’ve heard it said that the opposite of love is not hate. It’s indifference. Hating is a form of caring. For whatever reason, he polarizes the public and draws us in whether you like him or not.\n\nHis journey has made great theater. So much of the disdain has risen from LeBron’s inability to live up to his “King” nickname, to show up in the moments when he was needed most. That playing card is off the table now, but some people just plainly don’t like him and it’s not about his basketball ability or, now, his winning acumen. They just tend to prefer a Tim Duncan- and Derrick Rose-type superstar: quiet, humble, classy. I love those guys and their demeanor, but not everyone has the same personality. The NBA and sports in general would be pretty damn boring without bombastic personalities. Loud, controversial athletes like Charles Barkley, Muhammad Ali, Dennis Rodman give us a much more interesting landscape to enjoy. James isn’t even in that mold, but I’m just illustrating that there are many types of athletes and we shouldn’t expect just one style.\n\nMy friends say the main thing that they don’t like about LeBron is his arrogance. Michael Jordan was arrogant, but perhaps his charisma overshadowed his arrogance. If you are considered the best in the world in any field, arrogance or overconfidence will come into play at some point. James was anointed as “The Chosen One” on the cover of Sports Illustrated at age 16 while still in high school. He was the most highly-touted player to enter the NBA since Shaq; a once-in-a-generation type of player. And he still lived up to the hype. All I’m saying is that being Steve Jobs, Tom Cruise, Tiger Woods, or Prince comes with a certain amount of hubris. And until you’ve been in that person’s shoes, how can you really know how to handle the adulation, the money, or the criticism when the expectations are so high?\n\nI think he has proved that he is the best in the world, and if he keeps it up, he will be in the conversation for best all time. He is a year younger than Jordan when he won his first title, but I think there is a lot more competition than Jordan had (assuming LeBron doesn’t pause his NBA career for a stint in the NFL). For Lebron and basketball’s next greatest talent, Kevin Durant, I predict a similar rivalry to Bird and Magic where these guys trade title runs for the next decade. Plus, we still don’t know where Dwight Howard will end up, how good the Clippers can be, if Derrick Rose will fully recover, and if the Knicks will ever materialize into anything worth mentioning. I hope he has at least earned some more respect even if those people don’t like him. It’s better to be respected than liked.\n\nTrue or false: Chris Bosh is super corny.\n\nTrue, in a sense. People rag on Bosh because he looks a tad goofy, is a finesse-oriented power forward that is mainly a perimeter player, and is playing third fiddle to two of the top talents in the game. But let’s make the Beatles comparison: He’s definitely far more George Harrison than Ringo, and George ain’t no fucking slouch.\n\nI’ll take a little corny as long as you’re effective. In his two years with the Heat, he’saveraged around 18 points, 8 boards, shot a high percentage, played very underrated defense, and made two All-Star games. I would say he has been as advertised. Everyone finally saw his value when he was out with injury this post season: If Bosh hadn’t returned, the Celtics would have taken out the Heat. In the 2010 free-agent class, many would have rated him below Amar’e Stoudemire and Carlos Boozer for best available power forward, yet he has performed better than both of them and with fewer opportunities. I think he plays with a lot of heart, wants to win, and is clutch late in games. He is one of the best shooting big men in the game with a tremendous amount of skill. Not everybody can be as cool as Charles Oakley.\n\n***\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPION OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\nThunder sixth man James Harden had been averaging like 17 pts on 47% shooting in the playoffs. His finals numbers only reached 8 pts per game at 35%. His totals for assists and free throws plummeted too. Doc, excuse my French but what the fuck?\n\nI think the reaction to Harden’s Finals performance has been blown out of proportion. In general, he just missed shots that he usually makes and lost some confidence over the course of the series. The guy is only 22, and sometimes you just have a bad series. It sucks when that bad series comes in the Finals, but he’ll learn from the experience and come back great next year and be great.\n\nI really hate that sports pundits never give credit to the other team’s defense when they just flat-out shut down a star like Harden. The Miami Heat are a dominant defensive team — light years beyond San Antonio, L.A., or Dallas. You’d be delusional to think the Thunder would be able to do the same things to the Heat that they did to those teams. Miami’s ability to clog the lane and rotate quickly on pick and rolls can be devastating. Not to mention their length.\n\nThe real question is will OKC be able to keep Harden in town with his and Ibaka’s contracts up at the end of next season? Each will attract a big-money offer in the free agent market and would have to take a significant pay cut to stay in OKC. This could be a pivotal development in the complexion of the league.\n\nDoc, if the Thunder had gotten you on speakerphone at halftime of Game 5, what would you have told them? Reduce the amount of one-on-one offense?\n\nNothing I could have said would have changed the outcome of that game. It would not have changed Mike Miller hitting seven three-pointers. It would not have changed LeBron’s eye of the tiger and unbreakable focus. Wade played great. Bosh played great. Chalmers even had his best playoff game. It was just the Heat’s year.\n\nOklahoma City does not need to make dramatic changes to get in the position for a championship next year. They played one-on-one all year and had plenty of success because it’s almost impossible to stop their best three guys one-on-one. In a way, San Antonio inspired them to be a more fluid te"
