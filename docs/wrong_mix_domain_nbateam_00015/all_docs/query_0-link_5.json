        "text": "As most know by now, the Boston Celtics are once again NBA champions. Considering they went up against teams with injured stars, some pundits believe they had a relatively easy path laid out for them.\n\nOn a recent episode of Theo Pinson and Raymond Felton’s To The Baha podcast, Felton said the New York Knicks would have beaten them if they were fully healthy in the playoffs.\n\n“Man, they [Knicks] may beat them [Celtics], period. It may not even go 7.”\n\nThe Knicks are coming off arguably the franchise’s best season since 2013. Led by star point guard Jalen Brunson, they finished as the second seed in the Eastern Conference with a 50-32 record, giving them only their third postseason appearance in the last 11 years. After winning the first round 4-2 against the Philadelphia 76ers, they faced the Indiana Pacers in the Semifinals. The series went to Game 7 but that’s when the Knicks faced a tough challenge. With their backs against the wall, Brunson left the second half with a broken hand while the Pacers went on the win the series.\n\nBrunson’s broken hand was the first nor only injury the Knicks were dealt. Julius Randle’s season was cut short due to a right shoulder injury that eventually required surgery. Bojan Bogdanovic, who was acquired from the Detroit Pistons in February, missed the majority of the playoffs with a left foot and left wrist injury, both also requiring surgery. Mitchell Robinson also missed a chunk of the playoffs with a left ankle injury.\n\nThe Knicks might have given Boston a problem\n\nIf both parties were completely healthy, the Knicks-Celtics matchup could’ve been a highlight one. This season, they played each other five times with most games remaining competitive. As a matter of fact, the Knicks finished the year with a point differential of -7 against them which is impressive considering Boston was one of the best defensive teams.\n\nWhile Brunson would lead the Knicks’ offense, he would be assisted by rim-finisher Randle and sharpshooter Bogdanovic. Not to mention, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo have proven they could be relied on. As for defense, Robinson would help out with his elite shot-blocking abilities.\n\nThe Celtics would surely make it difficult with the multiple weapons they have, both offensively and defensively. But a fully-healthy Knicks team would also come to the battle with weapons to match."
