        "text": "Tandem Sports & Entertainment has signed Portland Trail Blazers guard Gerald Henderson and Dallas Mavericks guard Raymond Felton for representation on and off the court.\n\nTandem founder Jim Tanner will represent Felton and Henderson, who will both be unrestricted free agents in the summer of 2016. They were both represented by Wasserman Media Group.\n\nTanner said he signed both of them as clients last month and is preparing for their free agent negotiations. The NBA salary cap, which is set at a record $70 million this year, is expected to jump to $89 million next year.\n\nSeveral NBA players have left Wasserman after the departure of powerful agent Arn Tellem, who took a job with Palace Sports & Entertainment, owner of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nTandem’s Jim Tanner has known Henderson since Henderson left Duke for the NBA.\n\nTanner said he has known Henderson and his family since Henderson left Duke in 2009. In the case of Felton, who played for the University of North Carolina, Tanner had a connection through representing several former Tar Heels.\n\n“In both cases, a number of our existing clients referred us to them when they knew Gerald and Raymond were seeking new representation,” Tanner said.\n\nTanner launched Tandem Sports & Entertainment in October 2013 after starting his career at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams & Connolly.\n\nThe practice has doubled in size in the last two years, said Tanner, who added, “We’re thrilled with where Tandem is, particularly when you see all of the turmoil happening in the agent industry.”\n\nIn addition to Henderson and Felton, Tandem represents several other NBA players who will be free agents next summer, including Tim Duncan, Zaza Pachulia, Marvin Williams, Jeremy Lin and James Michael McAdoo.\n\n> BROADCAST AGENT FOR WOODSON: United Talent Agency has signed Oakland Raiders safety Charles Woodson for representation in broadcasting and television work.\n\nWoodson, an eight-time Pro Bowler and a Heisman Trophy winner, will be represented by UTA agents Jerry Silbowitz and Ryan Hayden.\n\nHe was formerly represented by Headline Media for broadcast work.\n\nWoodson, 39, is playing his 18th season in the NFL and had five interceptions this season coming into last weekend. He was named AFC Defensive Player of the Month for the month of October.\n\n> WME-IMG SIGNS SONDERS: WME-IMG has signed Fox Sports broadcaster Holly Sonders for representation. IMG agent Ira Stahlberger will represent her. She was formerly represented by Headline Media.\n\n> AA SIGNS NFL PLAYERS: Authentic Athletix has signed Washington Redskins wide receiver Rashad Ross, Redskins defensive end Junior Galette and Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Ronald Powell. AA founder Peter Schaffer will represent the players.\n\nGalette was represented by Alvin Keels, and Powell was represented by Tom Santanello. Ross was represented by Vinnie Porter, who is under suspension by the NFL Players Association.\n\nAdditionally, Schaffer signed PGA Tour golfer Shane Bertsch for representation.\n\n> ARCIA RETURNS TO AGENT: Minnesota Twins outfielder Oswaldo Arcia has returned to agent Martin Arburua at International Sports Management. It’s his third agent in as many years. Arcia was most recently represented by Praver Shapiro and before that by The Legacy Agency. Before that he was represented by International Sports Management.\n\nOswaldo’s younger brother, Orlando Arcia, a shortstop and top prospect in the Milwaukee Brewers organization, is represented by TLA.\n\n> KERNS SIGNS EIFERT: Kerns Marketing & Management has signed Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert for marketing, public relations and brand management work. Founder and president Ashley Kerns will represent him. The firm also reps Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell and Baltimore Ravens safety Kendrick Lewis off the field."
