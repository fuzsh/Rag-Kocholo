Known for his shooting ability, he was nicknamed \"The Man With The Golden Arm\". He played for the University of North Carolina from 2006 to 2009. He chose to forgo his final season of college eligibility to declare for the 2009 NBA Draft, and was drafted 28th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHigh school career[]\n\nEllington scored 2,211 points in his high school career, tallying 455 points at Daniel Boone High School, and then 1,756 points at The Episcopal Academy. In his senior year, Ellington averaged 21.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and shot 39% from the three–point line. He led Episcopal to an overall record of 52–7 in his junior and senior year, and to the Inter-Academic League Conference title in his last two years going 20–0 in both seasons. (Episcopal doesn't play in state championships.)\n\nConsidered a five–star recruit by Rivals.com, Ellington was listed as the No. 1 Shooting Guard and the No. 8 player in the nation in 2006.\n\nCollege career[]\n\nEllington played in all 38 games for the ACC Champion Tar Heels in 2006–07, averaging 11.7 points per game. He was named to the 2007 ACC All–Tournament Team. His season ended on a sour note though, as North Carolina lost to Georgetown in the East Regional final of the NCAA Tournament. He had a chance to win the game in regulation, but missed a three–pointer in the final seconds. Ellington was a member of the U.S. national team that finished fifth at the 2007 Pan American Games.\n\nAs a sophomore, Ellington saw his points–per–game average increase as the Tar Heels increasingly went to him in key moments of games. In the January 6, 2008 game at Clemson, Ellington scored a career–high 36 points, including the game winning three–pointer with 0:00.4 seconds left in overtime to lead top–rated UNC over #19 Clemson 90–88. But again, his season ended in a poor fashion, as he shot only 1 for 9 from three–point range, in a loss to Kansas in a national semifinal game in the NCAA Tournament. He declared for the 2008 NBA Draft after that season, but did not hire an agent, and withdrew to play his junior year at North Carolina.\n\nAs a junior, Ellington helped lead the Tar Heels to the National Championship, where they defeated the Michigan State Spartans 89–72. He shot 7–10 from three–point range in the Final Four, and he was named to the All–Tournament Team and was named NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player. During his college career, Ellington averaged 14.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game.\n\nOn April 23, 2009, Ellington announced that he would forgo his senior season and enter the NBA Draft.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2009–2012)[]\n\nEllington was drafted 28th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2009 NBA Draft.

In the Heat's regular season finale on April 11, 2018, Ellington scored a career–high 32 points while setting Miami's single–season record for three–pointers, as the Heat wrapped up the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs by beating the Toronto Raptors 116–109 in overtime.
