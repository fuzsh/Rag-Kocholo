        "text": "The Detroit Pistons are now one loss away from setting the record for most consecutive losses in NBA history. After the 118-112 loss against the Brooklyn Nets, the Pistons set the record for the longest losing streak during a single season at 27 games. Notably, the longest losing streak was 28 games set by the Philadelphia 76ers over two seasons. Determined to avoid the undesirable record, the spirited Pistons had a great start against the Boston Celtics away from home.\n\nHowever, the Celtics came back with a strong third quarter and the game went to overtime. In OT, the Pistons succumbed and lost the game 122-128 to tie the longest losing streak ever with 28. As Detroit looks set to avoid the 29th straight loss, let’s look at some of the worst teams in league history based on their losing streaks.\n\n#5 Cleveland Cavaliers 2010-11\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThis was one of the biggest falls from grace ever in the league. In one offseason, the Cleveland Cavaliers went from a 61-21 record and Eastern Conference Finalists to a 19-63 record. This was the aftermath of the departure of superstar LeBron James. When James was drafted #1 by his hometown team, everyone believed the Chosen One would deliver their first-ever championship. However, despite LeBron’s valiant efforts, he could not. At least not in his first stint.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss in the ECF against the Celtics during the 2009-10 season, James left Cleveland and joined the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers hoped that their star would re-sign and were not prepared for his departure. And it cost them dearly.\n\nA major role had to be filled, and they expected the team to step up. Even though starters like Antawn Jamison, Mo Williams, Anderson Varejão, and J.J. Hickson stepped up a bit, LeBron’s shoes were too big to be filled. Their points per game had a 7-point drop while points scored against them went up by 9 points on average as per Basketball Reference.\n\nAs the Cavs struggled, they went on a 10-game losing streak. In the next game, the team snatched the streak with an OT win. However, they then lost 26 games straight which is the second worst in a single season. Subsequently, the Cavs finished the season 19-63.\n\n#4 Charlotte Bobcats 2011-12\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets is arguably one of the poorly run franchises in the league. In its 35 years of existence, the organization has made the playoffs 10 times and has never moved past the Conference Semi-Finals. After the team moved to New Orleans following the 2002-03 season, the NBA proposed the possibility of an expansion team in Charlotte. The group led by Robert L. Johnson was awarded the franchise and named it the Bobcats.\n\nIn 2004, the team picked Gerald Wallace, Primož Brezec, and Jason Kapono in the expansion draft. They added Raymond Felton the next year. However, the Bobcats struggled in the years that followed without a major star. In 2009, they acquired Stephen Jackson who gave them a huge boost. With his help, the Bobcats clinched a playoff berth. Even though they were swept in the first round, there was some excitement about the future.\n\nHowever, the team did not make the playoffs the next year. They started rebuilding and acquired Kemba Walker ahead of the 2011-12 season. It is almost always hard for an organization during the rebuild and the expectation was not high. But little did their fans expect the team to be one of the worst ever. After a 34-48 finish in the previous year, the Bobcats fell to a 7-59 record in the shortened 2011-12 season.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY – Ranking Kobe Bryant’s Five Championship Runs with the Los Angeles Lakers\n\nTheir 7-win record is the worst ever in the NBA. Furthermore, they went on a 23-game losing streak which is the 4th worst in a single season. Notably, they also had another 16-game losing streak in the same season.\n\n#3 Detroit Pistons 2023-24\n\nThe Detroit Pistons have been struggling for more than a decade now. In the last 15 years, the Pistons made the playoffs thrice, and they were swept in the first round on all three occasions. Their last postseason appearance came during the 2018-19 season when the team finished 41-41. In the next year, when the season was suspended because of COVID, the Pistons fell to a 20-46 record. This was followed by another poor season with a 20-52 record.\n\nAhead of the 2021-22 season, the franchise won the lottery and drafted Cade Cunningham as the #1 pick. After a slight improvement with 23 wins that year, the team fell to a 17-65 record during the 2022-23 season. After the last game, head coach Dwane Casey stepped down and Monty Williams was hired as the new coach in the next few months.\n\nDespite having the worst record in the league, the Pistons did not clinch the #1 pick. Instead, they received the fifth pick which they used to draft Ausar Thompson. Despite the change in head coach and new incomings, the organization’s struggles continued. In the current season, the Pistons are now 2-29 and are one loss away from clinching the longest losing streak ever.\n\nEven if they stop the losing streak, they are still tied for the longest streak at 28. Even though the season has still a long way to go, the Pistons make this list because of the monumental streak. Also, they are dangerously close to being the worst team ever if they don’t turn it around at least a little.\n\n#2 Philadelphia 76ers 1972-73\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers won the championship in 1967 with the help of All-Time Greats like Wilt Chamberlain, Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham, and so forth. After another season in Philadelphia, Chamberlain joined the Los Angeles Lakers. This was a huge blow for the organization. After his departure, the 76ers started declining. Stars like Cunningham, Greer, and Archie Clark did their part but the numbers started going down.\n\nAfter a 30-52 finish in the 1971-72 season, the team hit an all-time low in the next due to the departures of Clark and Cunningham. During the 1972-73 season, the Sixers struggled massively and won just 9 games and lost 73. This is the worst record in NBA history. They were one of the poor teams offensively and the worst team defensively as their opponents scored an average of 116 points per game.\n\nREAD MORE – Ranking the NBA’s Most Intense Christmas OT Games of All-Time\n\nDuring that season, they also set the record for longest losing streak at the time with 20. It is currently the 6th worst in the league. The Sixers also had multiple dreadful separate losing streaks of 13, 14, and 15 games. Despite this, they reached the Finals four years later. However, Philly had to wait a decade to finally win a championship in 1983.\n\n#1 Philadelphia 76ers 2013-16\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers is one of the oldest franchises in the league and has an immense history. However, they have also had their fair share of lows during their existence. After clinching the title in 1983, the 76ers next made the Finals after almost two decades during the 2000-01 season during the era of Allen Iverson. As Iverson left, the team had some good runs with the help of stars like Andre Iguodala, Jrue Holiday, Thaddeus Young, and Lou Williams.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nDuring the 2011-12 season, their offense was one of the worst in the league. However, they smothered their opponents with their incredible defense which was third in the league in terms of points allowed. With this, they sealed a playoff spot and reached the second round in almost ten years. In the next season, the Sixers failed to reach the playoffs as Iguodala departed. However, they still finished with a decent 34-48 record with the help of Holiday.\n\nAhead of the next season, the organization decided to rebuild and traded Holiday to the New Orleans Pelicans. After he left, the Sixers fell to a poor 19-63 record during the 2013-14 season. Also, the team tied the Cavaliers’ longest losing streak in a season with 26. However, there is a reason the Sixers make the #1 spot while the Cavs are 5th in this list. And it is their consistent abysmal displays.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe next season saw the Sixers make a major shake-up in the roster. However, this led to an 18-64 record. After a 17-game losing streak early in the season, they lost the last 10 games as well. This extended during the 2015-16 season when the 76ers lost the first 18 games to set the record for the longest losing streak of 28. Also, they had two more 12-game and a 13-game losing streak that season. Furthermore, they finished the season with a 10-72 record which is the second worst record in history only behind their own 9-73 set in 1973. Philly fans certainly had to endure a lot!"
