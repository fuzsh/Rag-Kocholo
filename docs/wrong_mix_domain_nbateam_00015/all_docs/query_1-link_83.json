        "text": "peyton-siva-11-20-13.jpg\n\nDetroit Pistons rookie Peyton Siva, a former NCAA champion, was poised in his first meaningful NBA playing time.\n\n(The Associated Press)\n\nAUBURN HILLS -- Peyton Siva got a hint from Brandon Jennings, minutes before the\n\ntipped off with the New York Knicks, that a stomach bug might limit the starting point guard.\n\nSiva knew that probably meant his first chance at important playing time in an NBA game, which is precisely what happened in\n\n.\n\nSiva played 11 minutes and had two rebounds, one turnover, and took one shot, an ill-advised 3-pointer which he missed.\n\nMost important, the Pistons didn't lose ground with him on the floor. Siva's plus-minus rating was plus-four.\n\n\"I think I played well,\" Siva said. \"I think I played within my game. I just tried to run the team, tried to play good defense, and just bring a lot of energy and try to change the pace of the game.\"\n\nThe rookie from Louisville, who was drafted in the second round after leading his college team to an NCAA title, admitted some minor nerves which went away quickly after he entered the game late in the first quarter.\n\nSiva's five minutes of playing time in the first half went well enough for another stint in the second half.\n\n\"You've definitely got to gather yourself and just be composed out there,\" he said. \"You don't want to try to do anything that you're not used to doing, and go out there and just play your game. But I think I did a good job out there. Coach really liked the way I played defense and he put me back in. I just tried to go out there and perform.\"\n\nSiva was pressed into action by Jennings' illness, which limited the starting point guard to 26 minutes.\n\nThe Knicks also were without their starter, Raymond Felton, who sat with hip and back injuries.\n\nThe Pistons already were missing Chauncey Billups (knee) and Will Bynum (hamstring, groin), so Siva knew he was in line for playing time when Jennings' illness left Rodney Stuckey as the only other player with point-guard experience.\n\n\"I play with these guys in practice and I feel I can compete with anybody,\" Siva said.\n\nCheeks said before Sunday's road loss to the Los Angeles Lakers that he was \"not afraid to play Peyton,\" though he went with a three-guard rotation of Jennings, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Stuckey in that game.\n\nThis time, he had no choice, and was quick to recall his earlier remarks.\n\n\"I told you I'm not afraid to play Peyton,\" Cheeks said. \"He's always ready. He puts his time in when he's not playing. And watching him in the preseason, he's not afraid of any moment. So I'm not afraid to play him.\"\n\nCheeks also was pleased with Caldwell-Pope, a first-round draft pick, whom he praised for defending the Knicks' J.R. Smith.\n\n\"A lot of these guys, he's seeing for the first time,\" Cheeks said. \"So for him to be able to defend them the way he defends them is pretty good for him. That's the reason why he's able to be in the game at the end of the game, because he can move his feet and he can guard one on one as good as anybody on our team.\"\n\nCheeks even used the rookies Siva and Caldwell-Pope together to start the fourth quarter, in a small lineup with Stuckey, Singler and Andre Drummond. The Pistons stretched the lead by five points with that group, with Stuckey doing all the scoring while the Knicks shot 0 of 4.\n\nSiva said his only objectives were to \"manage the team\" and be ready when called.\n\n\"That's one of the big challenges in the NBA, especially a player in my position, to always stay ready, always prepare before the game like you're going to play the whole time,\" he said.\n\n-- Download the MLive Detroit Pistons app for iPhone and Android"
