        "text": "The Detroit Pistons were attracted to Jon Leuer for offensive reasons.\n\nBut after Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said Leuer at the power forward spot is part of the Pistons’ “best defensive lineup” after Friday night’s 108-97 victory over the L.A. Clipper, it’s apparent Leuer is more than just a pretty jump shot.\n\n“Our best defense is with Jon on the floor,” Van Gundy said. “That’s our best defensive lineup — the five we went down the stretch with. That’s (for) when you have the lead.”\n\nOf the players getting routine playing time, Leuer has the third-highest defensive rating on the team behind Drummond and Aron Baynes.\n\n►Related: SVG hopes Andre Drummond can follow Matthew Stafford's lead\n\nLeuer played the entire fourth quarter in place of starter Tobias Harris vs. the Clippers. He finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds, another aspect that has drawn raves from Van Gundy.\n\nThe Pistons have struggled on the glass many games this season and it’s been common for Van Gundy to note Leuer and Drummond are the team’s only consistent rebounders.\n\nAnd with Marcus Morris’ strong fourth quarter, there was no need to bring back Harris.\n\n“Tobias played a good offensive game tonight, but Marcus (Morris) had it rolling — gave us enough offense out there tonight — and Jon I thought was key tonight,” Van Gundy said. “And 11 rebounds, too.”"
