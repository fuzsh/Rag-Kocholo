        "text": "The Knicks set their sights on sweeping a five-game homestand and getting to the All-Star break on a 9-2 run.\n\nThey already have done the former, and have a very real shot at the latter. The biggest reason why they have bounced back from a mediocre month to play red-hot basketball is the return of Raymond Felton.\n\nThe point guard’s value was underscored even more by his injury and absence than it was by his play and his presence. Forced to put too much on the shoulders of Jason Kidd and Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks struggled mightily when Felton missed a month with a broken pinkie, and have gone on a tear since his return.\n\n“He’s our quarterback. That was the whole idea when we got him,” coach Mike Woodson said. “Raymond’s a big piece of the puzzle. He can pick and choose when he wants to score. He’s great at setting people up when he wants guys to get shots.\n\n“Raymond presents a problem [for defenses]. He’s a different point guard than Kidd. He’s younger. He should be different. Jason’s damn near 40 years old. … Raymond is unique in he can get in there and make the midrange shot, get to the rack and it opens it up when he’s driving and able to kick to guys like [Steve] Novak.’’\n\nThe Knicks were just 6-6 in Felton’s absence but are 25-9 with him, including a five-game winning streak going into tonight’s game in Washington against the Wizards. Kidd, 39, gushed over not only Felton’s ability to penetrate and run the pick-and-roll he himself once excelled at, but do it all while in pain.\n\n“Ray is playing as well as anybody,” Kidd said. “For him, he still has those fingers taped up. He’d love to have [the tape] off. But he’s finding open guys and knocking down shots.”\n\nFelton has limited turnovers, fostered ball movement and pushed the ball off defensive rebounds so they’re not starting their offense near halfcourt or with the clock running down. In short, with Monday the one-year anniversary of Linsanity, Felton has demonstrated the value of savvy point-guard play.\n\n“I’m just doing my job, just trying to win games, trying to lead this team, trying to make the game easier for everybody else,’’ Felton said. “Point guards aren’t supposed to come out every night and score. … I’m supposed to run the team and make sure we get a W.”\n\nHe has done just that — before and after his broken pinkie. The Knicks were 20-8, shooting 39.3-percent from 3-point range and averaging 102.3 points when he went on the shelf after the Christmas Day loss at the Lakers. They muddled through the next month, just 6-6 on 35.7-percent shooting from deep and mustering just 97.3 ppg.\n\nBut since his Jan. 26 return in Philadelphia, the Knicks have been even better than before. They lost that game but won the next five, hitting 40 percent of their 3s and averaging 102.3 points, their assists spiking from 19.3 to 23.7.\n\n“We’re back to the way we were playing earlier in the year,’’ Felton said “We’re moving the ball and everyone is happy. Everybody’s sharing the ball. The game is fun when it’s like that, and that’s the way we’re playing right now.’’\n\n➤ East All-Star captain Dwyane Wade not only is stumping for ex-Marquette teammate Steve Novak to make the 3-point contest, but — according the Miami Herald — indicated James White will be in the dunk contest.\n\nNovak, the Knicks’ player rep, on union chief Billy Hunter being put on indefinite leave after an audit ripped his hiring practices, expenditures and judgment: “Obviously the report I think was a good thing that happened to be able to clear the air and get everything out in the open that happened. Regardless of how you look at it, I think those are the facts at this point.\n\n“Those will be what we’ll look at as players and evaluate what we want to do going forward. Obviously there will be votes by the executive committee on what we’re going to do moving forward. I think that’s the best way to do it and get everything out in the open.”\n\nbrian.lewis@nypost.com"
