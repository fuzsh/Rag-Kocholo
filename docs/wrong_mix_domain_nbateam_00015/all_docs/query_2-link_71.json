        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Stan Van Gundy’s wife likes to remind him about the other part of coaching, the part that doesn’t necessarily result in on-court outcomes.\n\n“When I get too carried away with nothing but wins and losses, life’s about relationships,” Van Gundy said before Monday’s game against the Clippers. “I’ve been very, very lucky throughout my coaching career at the college level and then even into the NBA that I’ve coached some great, great people who I have tremendous respect for. When it’s mutual, that’s obviously a great feeling.”\n\nAnd with Van Gundy and J.J. Redick, that respect is certainly mutual.\n\n“I think just in terms of intangibles and characteristics I think any NBA player should have, I think he taught me those things and he reinforced those things in me – professionalism, accountability, playing hard and the same way every game, not taking any nights off, all that stuff, because he lives that,” Redick said. “I see how hard he works, how much he invests in his craft, and so as a player, playing for him, you really have no choice but to do the same.”\n\nThe two were together in Orlando, where Van Gundy coached Redick starting in his second season. And even though Redick’s minutes actually went down that season, he began forming a relationship that would shape his NBA career.\n\nIn addition to reinforcing the idea that accountability was a necessary trait, on the court, Van Gundy helped shape Redick into a valuable defender despite athletic limitations that keep him from being a one-on-one stopper.\n\n“Pretty much any sort of team defense concept that’s pertinent to modern NBA basketball, I learned from Stan,” Redick said.\n\nAnd, it’s strong team defensive principles that have the Clippers’ atop the league in efficiency through the first six games this season.\n\n“This is the second year of us doing the same defense,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “Last year, it took us awhile and once we got going, we were good. This year, I think we picked up where we left off.”\n\nRivers pointed to the Clippers’ off-the-ball defense as the reason why they’re even better this year, and that’s the exact area where Redick blossomed under Van Gundy.\n\n“When you have a great commitment to winning like J.J. does and you play hard and you’re tough and you’re smart as hell, you’re gonna be a pretty good defender, especially as a team guy,” Van Gundy said. “Smart, tough guys who want to win, it usually won’t be too hard for them to pick up the defense.”\n\nAnd, Redick has.\n\n“You have to be a great team defender. That’s just following the rules of where you’re supposed to be and understanding where you’re supposed to be,” Rivers said. “If you’re not a great individual defender, you have to study the team defense and understand exactly where your body has to be. As long as you’re there, it’s tough for Stan or me to complain.\n\n“I think J.J. has figured that out.”\n\nRIVERS IMPRESSED WITH CRAWFORD’S PLAY\n\nJamal Crawford isn’t making a ton of shots and he’s not scoring a ton of points, but he’s making a significant impact on the Clippers’ improved second unit.\n\n“He’s in a great place, probably the best place I’ve seen him since I’ve had him,” Rivers said. “He’s been a facilitator a lot. He scores when he needs to score. He’s really kind of tutored Austin (Rivers) and Raymond (Felton) on how to play together with that group. This is the best place I’ve ever seen Jamal. I think he realizes where he is in his career. I don’t know that, but it’s just my assumption. He’s in the best place I’ve ever seen.”"
