        "text": "Who are the best New York Knicks of all time? One of the most storied franchises in the NBA, the Knicks were one of the NBA's original teams. Formed in 1946, the team has had some of the greatest players in NBA history to play in the Big Apple. The Knicks's early years were successful, with multiple playoff and NBA Finals appearances. But it took the team until 1970 to capture it's first ever championship. Behind Hall of Famers and franchise icons like Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, Dave DeBusschere and BIll Bradley, the Knicks played some of the most entertaining basketball in the NBA. When Willis Reed suffered an ankle injury in Game 6, the Knicks looked done. But against the odds, Reed hobbled out and sank the first two baskets and the team was on its way.\n\nIn addition to Reed, Patrick Ewing was another one of the greatest centers of all time to play for the Knicks. Ewing led one of the most successful eras in Knicks history. Those Knickerbocker teams were tough and defensive minded, and featured some of the most famous former Knicks legends ever. During the Ewing years, all time Knick greats like Charles Oakley, John Starks, Anthony Mason, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell were on the roster. Unfortunately, they were never able to capture an elusive NBA championship due to Michael Jordan's presence on the Bulls, something that haunts the franchise to this day.\n\nSome of the current Knicks that might move up this list include Julius Randle, R.J. Barrett, and Mitchell Robinson. All three are considered among the top current NBA players.\n\nVote or rerank this list according to who you think should be considered the greatest New York Knicks player in franchise history."
