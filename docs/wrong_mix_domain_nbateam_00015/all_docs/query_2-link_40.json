        "text": "mike-woodson-3-3-14.jpg\n\nEmbattled New York Knicks coach Mike Woodson's team is the NBA's biggest disappointment.\n\n(AP Photo)\n\nWho:\n\nNew York Knicks (21-39) at Detroit Pistons (23-36)\n\nWhen:\n\n7:30 p.m. (ET)\n\nWhere:\n\nThe Palace of Auburn Hills\n\nTelevision:\n\nFox Sports Detroit\n\nRadio:\n\n97.1 The Ticket and the\n\nLine:\n\nPistons -5 (205 1/2)\n\nTwitter:\n\nFollow\n\nand\n\nLive coverage:\n\nLook for a live blog hosted by Brendan Savage at 6:30 p.m.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nRaymond Felton (6-1, 205, North Carolina), Pablo Prigioni (6-3, 185, Argentina), Iman Shumpert (6-5, 220, Georgia Tech), Carmelo Anthony (6-8, 235, Syracuse), Tyson Chandler (7-1, 240, Compton Dominguez H.S., Calif.).\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nBrandon Jennings (6-1, 169, Oak Hill Academy, Va.), Kyle Singler (6-8, 230, Duke), Josh Smith (6-9, 225, Oak Hill Academy, Va.), Greg Monroe (6-11, 250, Georgetown), Andre Drummond (6-10, 270, Connecticut).\n\n--The Pistons have lost four in a row and seven of their last eight. The Knicks have lost six in a row and nine of their last 10.\n\n--This is the last of three Pistons-Knicks games this year. The teams split two previous meetings, with the home team winning each. The Pistons won 92-86 on Nov. 19, with Rodney Stuckey collecting 21 points and five assists off the bench, the big-three line combining for 48 points and 27 rebounds, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scoring 13 points. Anthony had 59 points in the two games, including 34 in the rematch, which the Knicks won 89-85 on Jan. 7.\n\n--Anthony, who has said he plans to exercise a July 1 early termination clause in his contract and become an unrestricted free agent, is the NBA's second-leading scorer at 28 points per game. The defending scoring champion also is averaging a team-high and career-high 8.5 rebounds.\n\n--The Pistons have allowed 100-plus points in 26 of their last 33 games, including the last seven in a row.\n\n--The over-under on Knicks regular-season victories in Las Vegas was 48 1/2 before the season began. They couldn't reach that number if they went 22-0 the rest of the season.\n\n--The Knicks commit 12.6 turnovers per game, second-best in the league.\n\nLet's talk about what these 3 1/2 games mean -- both ways.\n\nThe Pistons are in a virtual dead heat with Cleveland for ninth in the Eastern Conference, 3 1/2 games out of the last playoff spot, which wouldn't seem to matter except eighth-place Atlanta is 1-10 in its last 11 games, with four games remaining on a six-game western trip before its schedule softens.\n\nThe Pistons also are tied with New Orleans for ninth-worst record in the league, 3 1/2 games removed from having the fourth-worst record, a threshold at which they comfortably could keep their first-round draft pick. They only need to be in the top eight after the lottery to defer the protected first-rounder they owe Charlotte from the Ben Gordon trade until 2015 or 2016.\n\nIt's the same 3 1/2-game distance both ways -- playoffs, or fourth-worst in the NBA -- and not very easy to make up either one with 23 games remaining.\n\nRegardless, there clearly is a much better chance that the Pistons keep their draft pick than make the playoffs.\n\nEnter the Knicks, the biggest disappointment in the league.\n\nOf the Pistons' 23 remaining games, 13 are against teams with .500-or-better records, and 14 are on the road. If you're looking for playoffs, that isn't good. If you're looking to keep a draft pick, it is.\n\nAnd five of those 23 games, including three of the next five, are against the teams that stand between the Pistons and the fourth-worst record in the league.\n\nUtah is two games behind the Pistons and Pelicans, the Knicks are 2 1/2 back, the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento are three back, and Boston is 3 1/2 back.\n\nThe Pistons have games remaining against all but the Pelicans and Lakers in that group, with two against the Celtics.\n\nGames against the Knicks, Celtics and Kings in the next nine days should make for some level of interest, even of not for reasons the Pistons hoped.\n\n-- Download the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android"
