        "text": "Former New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton recently appeared in the “Run Your Race” podcast to say that Carmelo Anthony is a better scorer than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kobe Bryant.\n\nRaymond Felton and Carmelo Anthony were part of the New York Knicks in the early 2010s. But they never became teammates because they were traded for one another in a five-player, three-pick deal between the New York Knicks and the Denver Nuggets in February 2011. Still, that hasn’t stopped Felton from making such a bold claim.\n\n“That dude, just the way he can score, how easy it is for him, I don’t know nobody who’s better, to be honest with you. I’m talking Tracy McGrady, I’m talking about MJ, I’m talking about Kobe, LeBron, all these guys. The way he used to score at every level, I don’t know nobody who’s better, for real,” Felton said about Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“I haven’t seen KD go off in the post like I’ve seen Melo go off in the post. Can KD score? For sure. Good gracious. That man can score easily. He scores easily for him to be 7-feet. But Melo, I’ve seen Melo score everywhere. I haven’t seen KD just get somebody in the post and I’m just gonna do you dirty, just post the whole game. I’ve seen Melo do that,” he concluded.\n\nCarmelo Anthony is a certified legend\n\nCarmelo Anthony will probably make it to the Basketball Hall of Fame someday, as his NBA resume speaks for itself. He is a 10-time NBA All-Star, two-time All-NBA Second Team member, four-time All-NBA Third Team member, one-time NBA scoring champion, and is part of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nThroughout his 19-year tenure in the league, Carmelo Anthony has shown his ability to get buckets from anywhere on the court using his variety of moves to throw defenders off. Listed at 6’7″ and 238 pounds, Carmelo Anthony can outpower his defenders or shoot over them with his silky-smooth jumper."
