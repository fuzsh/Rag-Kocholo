        "text": "When Chris Paul or J.J. Redick are out for rest or injury, Raymond Felton is proving himself as someone who can step in as a starter for the LA Clippers.\n\nThe LA Clippers chose to start Raymond Felton against the New Orleans Pelicans on December 2nd, who stepped in as an effective replacement for J.J. Redick as he sat on the sidelines for a game of rest.\n\nIn just over 26 minutes, Felton racked up 12 points on 50 percent shooting from the field. He added to this with three assists, two rebounds, and a steal. In a game where every player on the Clippers’ roster contributed effectively, Raymond Felton was the right choice to start alongside Chris Paul.\n\nStarting Felton over Jamal Crawford and Austin Rivers allows the benches firepower to remain in place. Both can create their own shot, with pull-ups in particular from Crawford and drives from Rivers giving the Clippers’ more offensive punch when starters sit. Doc Rivers could have easily chosen the three-time Sixth Man of the Year or his son to start, yet he chose Felton. As the Clippers’ bench is one of their biggest advantages and improvements this season, this decision kept it whole.\n\nWhen Felton steps up, he steps up big. Before this season, Felton was wearing a Dallas Mavericks uniform. In last season’s playoffs, the Mavs lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a five-game first round series. Their guards, J.J. Barea and Deron Williams, would eventually sustain injuries, forcing Felton to step up as the starting point guard.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nIn the last three games of the series, he averaged 15 points, 4.6 assists, and 4.6 rebounds. Felton also recorded two double-doubles during this series (one points-assists, and one points-rebounds). Felton is not afraid to answer the call when a team needs him and play with aggression (at both ends of the floor), and that’s one of the biggest reasons why he was able to prove his worth last season.\n\nAt 32 years of age, Felton has been a part of five NBA teams other than the Clippers. Felton is a true role player for whatever team he plays for, and has bounced back after a down, overweight spell with the New York Knicks a few years back.\n\nHis career stats read 12.2 points, 5.9 assists, 3.1 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game. And while his best years as a player are most likely behind him, Felton remains a valuable pickup for the Clippers, made even better by the fact he was basically free as someone who signed for the veteran’s minimum.\n\nWant your voice heard? Join the Clipperholics team!\n\nIn future situations with either Paul or Redick out due to rest or injury, Raymond Felton (if available) will most likely be chosen to start for the LA Clippers. The game against the Pelicans was an impressive one for Felton, and we look forward to more starting performances from him when duty calls.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
