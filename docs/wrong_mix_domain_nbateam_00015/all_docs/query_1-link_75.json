Villanueva was due to make 8m in 2012/2013 and the team had an option for 2013/2014. With the improved play of Jason Maxiell and young talent like Jonas Jerebko and 1st round pick Andre Drummond, the Pistons just didn't have the playing time for Villanueva to justify spending eight million dollars. In 2011/2012 Villanueva only played about 9 minutes a game and although offensively productive, his defense kept him from getting more court time. Pistons GM Joe Dumars said, \"Charlie has been nothing but professional since he signed with the Pistons. I have only good things to say about Charlie as a person. That said, it just didn't work out for him here. I hope that a fresh start with a new team can help rejuvenate his career and he can find the promi9e that I saw in him when I signed him.\" Villanueva issued a statement through his agent that said, \"I appreciate the opportunity the Pistons organization gave me. I wish it would have worked out better for all involved but I wish all the best to my ex-teammates, to Coach Frank, Assistant Coach Brian Hill, Joe Dumars,\n\nOwner Tom Gores, and the entire organization. Although I didn't always agree with decisions about my playing time, the organization was always up front with me, treated me with respect and treated me like a mature adult. I will continue to have my Charlie Villanueva foundation be active in Detroit and I will miss each and every fan, even the ones that exercised their right to boo me.\" The CVF has been recognized on several occasions by the NBA with the NBA Community Assist Award. The Foundation supports programs that provide guidance in creating non-violent solutions to the challenges and problems associated with bullying. Villanueva says he was bullied as a teenager after he lost all his hair as a result of a skin condition called Alopecia Areata. Pistons officials said they will continue to contribute to the CVF."
