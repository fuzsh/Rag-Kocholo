        "text": "My online lunch chat Wednesday went well, but I had a ton of questions left when I had to scram and get to a meeting. So I saved the questions remaining and scooted away, promising to blog them up. So here they are.\n\nLots of questions about why Sam Presti still has a job, and lots of answers about how spoiled are Thunder fans.\n\nGuest: “If, let’s say, PG-13 stays, do you see this team change at all for next season? I mean Presti likes getting draft picks, do you believe he may do any big move in order to improve the team? Or as he said, you believe he will keep the roster as consistent as possible?”\n\nI think Presti will do all kinds of things trying to improve the team, but his options are more limited than in the past. Presti in the early days accumulated a lot of young assets, and for the most part was able to maintain a lot of young assets. So when the opportunity came to trade for Kendrick Perkins, he had a Jeff Green to deal. When the chance to trade for Paul George, he had a Victor Oladipo to deal. But now OKC is limited in young assets, and Presti will have to figure out other ways to change the roster. One thing in the Thunder’s favor – almost every team is dealing with salary cap issues, so non-superstars are going to be available on the cheap.\n\nJustin in Florida: “I'm a huge fan of Sam Presti. I like his looks, his swagger, and his go get em' attitude. I think these Oklahomans need to lighten up on one of the best GM's in the league. What say you?”\n\nWell, I don’t know if they need to lighten up. They’re misguided. The Thunder literally has had one disappointing season (not counting injury) in 10. You don’t scrap a plan when that happens. You work harder and keep the faith. But that’s not really the 21st-century motif in American society. We’re a microwave, portable society. Switch jobs, switch spouses, switch cities. Sticking to something is out of fashion.\n\nGuest: “If PGstays, what free agent or trade would you make to build around them and same question if he leaves.”\n\nTrade? No clue. I saw neither of the Oladipo trades coming and nobody else did, either. So speculating on Presti trades is fruitless. Free agent? Like I said, the market will be kind to teams on getting cheap free agents. If George stays, the mid-level exception for the Thunder would be $5.something million. If George leaves, the mid-level is probably $8.something million. You can get a good player at that. OKC got Patrick Patterson for $5.5 million. Got Raymond Felton for $2.3 million. The way it works, the teams will chase the superstars, there won’t be a ton of money in the market and the middle guys – the crew below stardom – will have to battle for salaries below their true value.\n\nGuest: “OSU football question -- over/under Dru Brown will start the season as QB? I don't see him transferring to OSU if he didn't have a real probability to start.”\n\nWell, I don’t understand the over/under part of it. But I think Brown has a real chance to start. In fact, that’s who I’m picking. I’m with you. I don’t see him transferring without a real “probability” to start. I like that word. Of course, coaches can con a graduate transfer same way they can con a high school senior. Coaches can spread the old windsong rather thick. But Brown is my pick to start for OSU.\n\nGuest: “Glad to hear you back on the radio with Jim and Al. I’m thinking maybe Jim will behave better? Not likely...”\n\nOh, I think it’s likely. I enjoy being on with those guys. Things are good.\n\nGuest: “Are all newspapers/websites moving to a paywall? I'm concerned because that will really limit what you can read in other markets. I don't want to subscribe just to read a couple of articles. What do you think will happen?”\n\nI think the industry clearly is moving to a paywall, after starting out the internet as mostly advertiser-driven. The ad money didn’t translate from newspaper to websites. So subscriptions are the alternative. We don’t have one. But aren’t paywalls sort of fair? I mean, shouldn’t you have to pay for content?\n\nGuest: “Mr. Tramel, thank you for keeping pro sports in perspective for the-sky-is-falling Thunder fans. If PG 13 leaves, we ARE NOT done nor should we be. But trading Westbrook and Adams would signal a long dark winter for many years. My question what is the ceiling for Abrines and Ferguson? Thanks!”\n\nThe ceiling for Ferguson is much higher, for two reasons. He’s more athletic and he’s much younger. Ferguson is only 19. All kinds of outstanding NBA players struggled at 19. Abrines turns 25 on Aug. 1. No outstanding NBA player struggled at 24. Abrines is destined to be a role player. The upside? A better Anthony Morrow. An outside shooter who can sort of get by on defense. Ferguson’s potential is vast. He literally could turn into an all-star. Or he could be a bust. With anything in between. He doesn’t have the same history of shotmaking that Abrines does – Ferguson doesn’t have much of a history at all – but if Ferguson’s shooting develops, then that bust stuff goes out the window and he, too, becomes a better Anthony Morrow. Ferguson’s upside also rides with his athletic ability. He could be an impact defender. If Ferguson can learn to guard people, his value skyrockets.\n\nRoyce Young: “What is the main goal of the Thunder organization? Is it to sell a product, or is it to win a championship? If you strictly care about selling a product, you keep Westbrook and you are content with 45-win seasons. If you care more about winning a championship, you potentially anger your fan base and start over. I don't think the latter option is as fatalistic as you imagine.”\n\nYou’re right. The latter option is more fatalistic. The mission statement for the Thunder, if there is one, is to produce a quality team every year with the goal of contending for a championship. I just made that up on the fly. But I think it’s pretty close. The idea that you rebuild by tearing down gains great steam by the teams you remember. Presti’s 2007 Sonics. Sam Hinkie’s 76ers. What you never remember are the 7-8 teams per year that try it. Then some of those same teams tank the next season, joined by a few others. And the cycle perpetuates. You remember the lucky. You don’t remember the legion of franchises that aren’t lucky. And most of the teams that tear down, don’t have a Westbrook/Adams to build around. When the Celtics made their vaunted trade with the Nets, Kevin Garnett was 37 and Paul Pierce was 35. That was a no-risk trade for Boston. Those guys were virtually finished. If Westbrook and Adams were 35 and 30, OK, then box them up. But they’re 29 and 24. You would be trading a bright future for the hope of a bright future. That’s kooky.\n\nIllinois Cowboy: “As a Cowboy fan, I find it somewhat psychologically preferable to go into a season with limited expectations. Last season was successful, but disappointing at the same time, if that is possible. I don't expect a dumpster fire, but I would like to hear what your opinion of what would be a rational expectation for next season would be.”\n\nGreat question. OSU had Mason Rudolph, Mason Rudolph, Tre Flowers, Chad Whitener, Zach Crabtree, Marcel Ateman and Brad Lundblade. Lots of excellent veterans who had won a bunch of games. And OSU went 9-3 in the regular season, with three home losses, and beat Virginia Tech to finish 10-3. Seems difficult to think this version of the Cowboys could get to 10 wins. So you have to be south of there. That makes 8-5 or 9-4 the likely destination. Counting bowl wins, I would make 8.5 the over/under. Lots of big holes to fill. But also a program that has proven it wins.\n\nGuest: “So Saint Sam deserves no blame for losing Harden and Durant? Who cares if he was able to get them? What good is it if you can't keep them? The Harden trade was a colossal mistake, it closed the championship window, gave an opening for Durant to leave because it showed the team was more worried about finances than winning a championship and it was all the decision of the boy wonder. And he has never been held accountable or even answered for that move.”\n\nThis is why fans paint their faces and wear the T-shirts at playoff games and write into my chat, and why decisions are left to professionals. Irrationality. Sometimes it’s hard to have an adult conversation with irrational fans. You’re not asking Clay Bennett to blame Presti for losing Harden and Durant. You’re asking Bennett to fire Presti for losing Harden and Durant. You’re doing that to make yourself feel better as a bitter fan. That’s the way you run a (bad) fantasy team. That’s not the way you run a quality organization. You’re not looking for accountability. You’re looking for revenge to make your bar arguments more compelling. Presti has never had to answer for Harden and Durant leaving? He’s answered it over and over and over for years. We can keep talking about the Harden trade forever. Perhaps it was a mistake. But it was understandable. The Thunder offered Harden more than it offered Ibaka. Ibaka signed. Harden didn’t. The Thunder offered Harden more than the Warriors signed Steph Curry for, and they were on the same contract path. Same draft, same status. Except Curry had proven to be the more productive player. Through three years, Curry’s scoring averages were 17.5, 18.6, 14.7 (the latter in an injury-shortened season). His 3-point percentages were .437, .442, .455. Yet Golden State offered Curry four years, $44 million. The Thunder offered Harden four years, $55 million. Did the Thunder low-ball Harden? I don’t know. Did Golden State low-ball Curry? Curry was coming off a troubling ankle injury. Harden was coming off an NBA Finals in which his game cratered. Did the Warriors know what they had in Curry? Did the Thunder know what it had in Harden? You state that OKC’s championship window left with Harden, which is why Durant eventually left. That’s garbage and you know it. The Thunder was the No. 1 seed in the West in 2013. Then Patrick Beverley happened. The Thunder went toe-to-toe with the Spurs in 2014 – a Spurs team that took apart the Heat in the Finals – and lost. That happens. The Thunder had the Warriors on the ropes in 2016. Durant and Westbrook played poorly in the final three minutes of Game 6. Titles aren’t won in July. Titles are won on the court. Presti has produced consistently excellent teams. The only people who want him gone are the immature and uneducated.\n\nLynn Prickett: “Do you know any more about the quarterback situation at OU?”\n\nWell, Lynn, I assume you mean Kyler Murray’s baseball. I mean, I haven’t measured anyone’s passing velocity in the last three weeks. I’m writing about Murray for the Friday Oklahoman, and all I can say is it should be troublesome. Baseball is a real threat to the 2018 OU football season.\n\nRod: “What are the odds of Carmelo and/or PG being part of the Thunder next year. If we lose PG, what do you think the team will look like?”\n\nSeems unlikely Carmelo will be back. A buyout seems probable. But let me throw something else out there. With Andre Roberson healthy, the starting lineup was really effective. That includes Carmelo. His strengths offset Roberson’s weaknesses, and vice-versa. What if the problem with Carmelo was trying to work him in too much with the second unit and other rotations. If George stays, what if you kept Carmelo and played him 20-24 minutes a game – the first and last 5-6 minutes of each half. See how that went? But that’s not the question you asked. I would guess there’s about a 30 percent chance PG13 returns. I don’t put much stock in the optimism. If OKC loses PG13, I think you can go back to the 2016-17 season for a gauge on the team. OKC won 47 games that year but huffed and puffed to do it. OKC won 48 games this past season but didn’t seem to break a sweat to do it.\n\nGuest: “How much input do Thunder owners not named Clay Bennett have on the franchise? Are they there strictly because they helped put up the cash to buy the team? I know the Thunder is a tight-lipped franchise but you never hear anything about the other owners.”\n\nGreat question. My impression is that the other owners are hands-off. From the early days, they were quite content to let Bennett run things, and it’s not like Bennett is out there showing off all his business. There’s been some turnover. Aubrey McClendon died. Tom Ward sold off. The primary guys alongside Bennett are Jeff Records (an original partner), Bob Howard, Everett Dobson, George Kaiser, Bill Cameron and Jay Scaramucci. Most of those guys have been part of the ownership group a long time, and they’ve all been quite content to stay in the background.\n\nGuest: “You missed a Thunder connection to the East Finals. When Brooks’ contract expired in 2012, Presti was going to let him walk and there was a report Brad Stevens would have been his choice to be the new coach. From where we were to where we are, everything is rage-inducing for a Thunder fan. Big mistakes were made and nobody has been held accountable.”\n\nThere we go with accountability again. It’s Salem, Massachusetts, all over again, and Sam Presti must burn, this time for keeping Scotty Brooks after he coached a bunch of 21- and 22-year-olds to the NBA Finals. Here’s what I’m afraid of. I’m afraid the basketball gods are going to convene and declare that Oklahoma City fans need to be taught what the world is like, and be sentenced to 30 years of Milwaukee-level basketball.\n\nJoel: “People who advocate an RW trade seem to believe championships can be won with some magic formula, that the team is one tweak (or major overhaul) away from taking home the trophy when, in actuality, NOTHING you do can guarantees you'll win it all. Heck, the unfortunate injury history of OKC (and Game 6 Klay magic) shows that nothing is assured. So, stick with what you have. Who knows when the confluence of events might break your way (see 2004 Pistons for reference).”\n\nI don’t believe in necessarily sticking with what you have, other than organizational leadership is outstanding and the Thunder has a superstar base that two-thirds of the league’s team envies. But you’re right. The best way to win is keep putting out the best team you can and see what happens. Boston, for example, this season. The year looked lost when Hayward and Irving went down. But the Sixers are young, and the Cavs are old, and the Raptors are cursed by LeBron, and there’s Boston, still standing.\n\nGuest: “I think you and the Monsters in the afternoon would make good radio. What do you think Berry?”"
