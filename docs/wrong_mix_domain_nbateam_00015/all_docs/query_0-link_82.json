        "text": "Jeff Siegel (UPROXX) on the crucial role Steven Adams plays on the Thunder: “While Westbrook certainly has moments in which he eschews his defensive responsibilities in favor of getting to the glass, there’s no ignoring the fact that letting their point guard grab and go immediately is a positive for the Thunder as a whole.”\n\nNick DePaula (ESPN) on the crazy colorways that are coming your way this season: “For the first time in league history, the NBA will allow players to wear sneakers of any color at any point during the upcoming season, league sources confirmed. The rule change is part of the NBA’s ongoing effort to allow its players to be expressive on the court.” Continue reading Thunder At A Glance – 30 August 2018 →\n\nNick Gallo (OKCThunder.com) on the reliability that Raymond Felton provides to the Thunder: “Felton has played all but 4 games over the past three years, for the Mavericks, then the LA Clippers and then the Thunder. This July, the 34-year old Felton re-upped with the Thunder for another run to play behind, and sometimes alongside, Westbrook and newcomer Dennis Schroder in OKC. Few in the league play with as much passion, intensity and fire as the Thunder’s All-Star point guard, but Schroder and Felton provide a similar dynamic as the floor generals for the bench group. Felton and Westbrook built an incredible connection last season that helped shape the locker room.”\n\nErik Horne (NewsOK) with 7 highlights from Steven Adams’ autobiography: “One of Adams’ older sisters, two-time Olympic shot put gold medalist Valerie Adams, was the only family member with media experience. She suggested the best thing to do was for Steven to say nothing, even thought the stories circulating about his family didn’t accurately depict the caring unit of brothers and sisters who worked together to ensure his future.” Continue reading NTTB Thunder Rumblings -31 July 2018 →\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski (ESPN) on the imminent departure of Carmelo Anthony from the Thunder: “The Thunder are working on trade scenarios in which Anthony, 34, would be moved as an expiring contract and waived, becoming a free agent once his $27.9 million 2017-18 salary clears waivers. Oklahoma City needs Anthony to waive his no-trade clause, which he has done to facilitate his exit, league sources said.”\n\nBrett Dawson (NewsOK) says Terrance Ferguson’s summer league struggles are part of the developmental plan: “Ferguson came here to work on expanding his game, on playing with the ball as well as off it, on showing more than just spot-up jump shots and a transition finishes. But growing means learning, and the Thunder staff has taught him a lot. That’s why, Ferguson said, assistant coach Darko Rajakovic pulled Ferguson aside at a recent practice and preached patience.” Continue reading NTTB Thunder Rumblings – 11 July 2018 →\n\nOn Episode 36 of the NTTB podcast, we discuss the following topics:\n\nNerlens Noel signing\n\nRaymond Felton re-signs\n\nCarmelo Anthony and Thunder definitely heading towards a split\n\nOptions for Melo’s departure\n\nReviewing Paul George’s decision to stay\n\nSummer League recap\n\nDeonte Burton sign a 2-way contaract\n\nNBA News\n\nIntro/Outro music provided by OSC Productions\n\nThank you for listening.

Make sure you leave us a 5-star review if you can. As always, Thunder Up!\n\nhttps://www.buzzsprout.com/111153/745263-episode-36-happy-pg-day.mp3?download=true\n\nNTTB previews the Thunder’s summer league squad: “For the Oklahoma City Thunder, the team will be looking for their youngsters to show improvement from where they were just 2 months ago. Even though the Thunder were one of the most veteran-laden teams in the league last season, they still counted on a couple rookies to provide valuable minutes throughout the season. Terrance Ferguson and Dakari Johnson showed that they belonged in the league last year. Now, the team will be looking for them to be consistent contributors on the roster.”\n\nErik Horne (NewsOK) on why Devon Hall has a shot at making the Thunder roster: “I know it was a big jump, but it was an uncommon work ethic,” Virginia coach Tony Bennett told The Oklahoman. “You watch him before practice, after practice, he had a routine. He was workmanlike or a pro in terms of his approach in practice, pre-practice and his shooting. He absolutely wore out his mechanics, shot and practice habits in the right way.” Continue reading NTTB Thunder Rumblings – 06 July 2018 →\n\nHope everyone had a great 4th of July. Probably the best one in the last two years.\n\nThe Thunder website chronicles some of the on-court aspects in their 10 year history: “In his twilight years with the Thunder, Collison jokingly referred to himself as a team dad, responsible for the development of younger big men like Steven Adams. His willingness to do whatever he could to help the team win, regardless of the prominence of his own role, was Collison’s defining quality.”\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski (ESPN) says the signing of Raymond Felton pushes the Thunder’s total salary cap bill past $300 million: “Felton’s signing will push the Thunder’s payroll and luxury tax hurtling past an historic NBA threshold: $300 million. The Thunder are responsible to pay $150 million in tax on the 2018-19 season’s roster, if the roster stays intact through the end of the season.” Continue reading NTTB Thunder Rumblings – 05 July 2018 →\n\nErik Horne (NewsOK) looks at Andre Roberson’s value to the Thunder: “The injury had elements of a Greek tragedy. The Thunder’s defense carried it through the first two months of the season as the offense finally came around in December. The demolition of the Pistons was the apex — the Thunder overwhelming them on both ends with Roberson at the core, snatching defensive rebounds and starting the fast break, cutting to the basket for give-and-go layups off Steven Adams post passes, shutting off drives to force ball reversals and turnovers.”\n\nAlbert Dadson (Hoops Habit) says the Thunder need to try and get into the first round: “An interesting place that Carmelo may not agree to go but would be a place where he could win again is Philadelphia. The Philadelphia 76ers will more than likely have two first round picks after the Los Angeles Lakers’ pick falls out of the first three slots, in addition to their own pick at No. 26. That second first round pick would be the one to target, though again, expecting a first-rounder for Melo at this stage is an uphill battle.” Continue reading NTTB Rumblings – 16 May 2018 →\n\nTo all my readers: I you!\n\nRoyce Young (ESPN) on Cleveland’s new bunch getting the best of the Thunder this time: “It’s one of James’ many remarkable traits that a roster halfway turned over just a week ago can show up and play cohesively, moving the ball to open players and generating connected offense. James is so adaptable, and carries a gravity that forces teammates to fit, that the Cavs can remodel their team on the fly, whereas it took the Thunder three months and 30 games to start to figure it out.”\n\nHeather Koontz (Thunderous Intentions) with some hilarious Thunder-related Valentine’s Day cards. Continue reading NTTB Rumblings (Valentine’s Day Edition) – 14 February 2018 →\n\nErik Horne (NewsOK) on the Thunder keeping Andre Roberson involved: “He’s been around in the background,” said Steven Adams, one of Roberson’s best friends on the team. “I know you guys don’t see him and stuff, but when we’re in, say the back of the stadium, he’s around all the time. It’s good, mate. He’s just doing his own thing, a little rehab. It’s a tough situation to be in, but he’s still keeping in happy spirits, good spirits.”\n\nBrett Dawson (NewsOK) on the Thunder SG starter still being in flux: “I think that (fifth) spot, it could be different,” Donovan said. “I don’t want to say it’s going to be different night to night, but yeah, it could change in certain situations based on what’s best for our team.” Continue reading NTTB Rumblings – 13 February 2018 →\n\nWhen: Thursday, 25 January 2018 at 7:00 pm CST\n\nWhere: Chesapeake Energy Arena, Oklahoma City, OK\n\nTV: TNT\n\nRadio: WWLS The Sports Animal (98.1 FM, 640 AM, 930 AM (Spanish))\n\nLine: OKC -5.0 | O/U – 213\n\nThe Set-Up: There’s a purveying thought in the NBA that the mark of a good team is taking care of business at home, beating the teams you are supposed to beat handily, and winning some of the games against the teams either at your level or above you. While that all may be true, one of the “shhhhh, it’s a secret” signs that you are a good team is the ability to coast through much of a game against an inferior opponent and then completely snatch their heart out at the end of the game.
