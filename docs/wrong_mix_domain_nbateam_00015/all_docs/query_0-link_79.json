        "text": "Point guard, Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks who hasn’t been doing so well this season was arrested Tuesday morning under New York law for possession of firearm. According to ESPN, Police said Raymond Felton turned himself in not too long after the Knicks lost to the Dallas Mavericks at Madison Square Garden. What caused Felton to turn himself in? Estranged wife, Ariane Raymondo-Felton is claiming that Felton pointed the gun at her more than once during their disputes in their upper west side apartment. Good thing for her she filed for divorce last week. However, the basketball player was freed on a 25,000 bond and is scheduled to practice with the team Wednesday and play against the Miami Heat Thursday. The judge ordered Felton to stay away from his former wife for six months under a order of protection but it seems as if fans didn’t think that was a good enough punishment. Check out the memes that are spreading throughout social media!\n\n-Asada Nicome (@SadaBlu)"
