        "text": "Raymond Felton sure doesn't sound intimidated by the thought of guarding Derrick Rose. Asked about the Chicago Bulls superstar at Thursday's shootaround, the New York Knicks point guard responded rather pridefully, via the New York Post's Marc Berman:\n\nFelton took offense when asked if he may need help with Rose.\n\n\"He puts his clothes on just like I put mine on,'' Felton said. \"I'm looking forward to the game. I‘m not handicapped. I don't need no help.''\n\nFirst off, sure, no professional athlete wants to go into a game feeling inferior to his opponent. Second, um, whoa. That's a little strong. No one is calling Felton handicapped, but he is currently hampered by a lingering left hamstring issue and Rose is one of the fastest, strongest, most dynamic players on the planet. Teams gear their entire defensive schemes toward stopping him. Felton, like every opposing point guard, will need and have help.\n\nIn fairness, Felton did acknowledge that Iman Shumpert would spend some time guarding Rose, too.\n\nThe Knicks and Bulls will meet at 8 p.m. Thursday at the United Center. It will be televised on TNT. Let's see how the point guards fare.\n\nMore from SB Nation NBA:\n\n• Longform: How the Pistons became a team apart from Detroit\n\n• James Herbert: He’s now ‘Coach Rondo’\n\n• Mark Deeks: Bogut’s extension was unnecessary\n\n• The King's Revolution: How things changed since LeBron made The Decision"
