        "text": "Raymond Felton may not have been surprised by Dennis Schroder on Wednesday night.\n\nSchroder made his debut for the Thunder against the Pistons by recording 21 points, nine assists and five rebounds in 27 minutes of action. He appeared to have great chemistry already with the team and looked to be in control.\n\nAfter watching Schroder from afar, Felton didn’t sound too surprised.\n\n“I have been playing against Dennis for the last [five] years since he has been in the league and he did everything that I’ve always seen him do,” Felton said. “He is a guy that can get into the paint, make plays, score, pass and he does a lot of stuff and he is a good defender. He came out in his first game and did a wonderful job. It’s only going to get better.”\n\nOf course, Schroder entered the NBA in 2013 as the No. 17 draft pick by the Hawks. He has played as a backup in Atlanta and was even a starter over the past two seasons.\n\nNow, Schroder will have a new role with the Thunder as he’ll likely serve as the backup to Russell Westbrook once he returns from a knee procedure that is expected to sideline him for at least another two weeks.\n\nBy watching Schroder against the Pistons, it looked as though he has been with the Thunder for quite some time as he had great chemistry with several players on the roster, including Steven Adams.\n\nAlthough the Thunder will be without Westbrook for the preseason, and possibly longer, Schroder’s performance on Wednesday will likely calm any nerves fans may have had about missing the team’s MVP."
