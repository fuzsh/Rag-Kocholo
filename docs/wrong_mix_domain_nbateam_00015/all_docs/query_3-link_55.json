        "text": "We'll keep updating this story as players across the NBA sign this month.\n\nFormer No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett is getting another chance in the NBA.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have signed him. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nBennett averaged 1.5 points and 1.2 rebounds in 19 games last season for Toronto, his third team since Cleveland surprisingly took him with the top pick of the 2013 draft. Bennett, 23, has averaged 4.2 points, 3.1 rebounds and 12.8 minutes as a pro.\n\nThe Nets also signed rookie Caris LeVert, the No. 20 pick in the draft (from Michigan) whose rights they acquired from Indiana in a trade for Thaddeus Young.\n\n• Live: NBA free agency rumors and reports​​\n\n• Five big NBA free agents for 2017\n\nClippers, Raymond Felton agree to a deal\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers agreed to a deal with free agent point guard Raymond Felton for the veteran’s minimum. The one-year deal will be for $1.5 million.\n\nFelton, who spent the last two seasons with Dallas, averaged 9.5 points and 3.6 assists last season. He shot 40.6% from the field and 28.2% from three-point range.\n\nOver his 11-year career, Felton has averaged 12.4 point and 6.0 assists. He gives the Clippers a solid backup at point guard behind Chris Paul.\n\nMavs sign Acy, Gibson to veteran-minimum deals\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks came to terms on veteran-minimum contracts with forward Quincy Acy and guard Jonathan Gibson.\n\nA 6-foot-7, 240-pounder, Acy signed a two-year contract, while Gibson inked a three-year partially guaranteed contract.\n\nAcy averaged 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds last season for the Sacramento Kings. After spending his rookie season with the Toronto Raptors and with the D-League’s Bakersfield Jam, Acy first played for the Kings during the 2013-14 season.\n\nibson (6-2, 185) is a 28-year-old combo guard who has been one of the bright spots for the Mavs in Las Vegas. Last year, Gibson averaged 42 points per game in the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nKnicks re-sign Vujacic, sign Ndour\n\nThe New York Knicks have re-signed guard Sasha Vujacic and signed forward Maurice Ndour.\n\nVujacic started 25 games last season, his first with the Knicks. He averaged 4.9 points overall in 61 games, but contributed 7.8 per game as a starter. He won NBA titles with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010.\n\nNdour, a member of Senegal’s national team, averaged 2.1 points in 18 games last season for Spain’s Real Madrid.\n\nTerms of the deals were not disclosed.\n\nGrizzlies bring back Ennis\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have signed forward James Ennis to a multiyear contract. Terms weren’t disclosed.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Ennis played a combined 22 games for the Miami Heat, Grizzlies and New Orleans Pelicans last season. He averaged 7.2 points, 1.9 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 14.9 minutes per game.\n\nMemphis had acquired Ennis and Mario Chalmers from Miami in a Nov. 10 trade that sent guard Beno Udrih and forward Jarnell Stokes to the Heat. After the Grizzlies waived Ennis in March, he finished the season with New Orleans. In his nine games with the Pelicans, he averaged 15.9 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 31.3 minutes per game.\n\nThe 26-year-old has played a total of 84 regular-season NBA games.\n\nHill goes from Minnesota to Indy\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed to terms with free agent forward Jordan Hill on a two-year deal worth $8 million.\n\nHill averaged 8.8 points and 6.2 rebounds for the Indiana Pacers last year. He is the latest addition to the Wolves frontcourt after adding center Cole Aldrich earlier in free agency.\n\nNew coach Tom Thibodeau has made addressing front-court depth one of the team’s top priorities. Now he has Hill and Aldrich to backup Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng.\n\nSpeights joins Clippers\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have signed free agent Marreese Speights, who played on Golden State’s NBA championship team a year ago.\n\nThe 28-year-old center/forward averaged 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 72 games for the Warriors last season, while hitting a career-high 24 three-pointers. During their title run a year ago, he averaged a career-best 10.4 points and 4.3 rebounds.\n\nSpeights has other NBA stints with Philadelphia, Memphis and Cleveland. He played two years at Florida, helping the Gators win the NCAA championship in 2007-08.\n\nScola goes to Nets\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have moved onto the contingency plan portion of their free agency, signing veteran forward Luis Scola to a one-year deal.\n\nAt 36, Scola becomes the Nets' oldest player — by far — and adds some needed guidance to a young, unproven roster.\n\nJack back to Atlanta\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks and point guard Jarrett Jack have agreed on a one-year contract for next season.\n\nJack will back up starter Dennis Schroder at the position. The Hawks needed an established point guard after trading Jeff Teague before the draft.\n\nJack is returning to Atlanta, where he helped Georgia Tech advance to the 2004 national title game. The Hawks will be Jack’s eighth team in 12 seasons. He spent the last two with Brooklyn, which waived him last month.\n\nJack averaged 12.8 points and 7.4 assists in 32 games before suffering a season-ending knee injury last January.\n\nBlazers pay to keep Leonard, Crabbe\n\nMeyers Leonard is staying in Portland, and it appears Allen Crabbe is, too.\n\nLeonard signed a four-year contract to remain with the Trail Blazers, though financial terms were not disclosed.\n\n“The future is going to be bright with this team,” the forward/center said in a released statement.\n\nAnd Crabbe is set to be a part of it. The Trail Blazers guard went to Twitter to proclaim: “RIP CITY!”\n\nThe tweet seemed to confirm reports that the Blazers had matched an offer by the Brooklyn Nets for the restricted free agent. The four-year, $75-million offer and Portland’s match were first reported by Yahoo Sports.\n\nCrabbe averaged 10.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 81 games last season, his third with the team. The 6-foot-6 Los Angeles native was acquired in a 2013 draft-day trade with Cleveland, which took him with the 31st overall pick out of California.\n\nHeat re-sign Johnson & Haslem, add Ellington\n\nUdonis Haslem is coming back for a 14th season in Miami, Tyler Johnson’s move to Brooklyn is canceled, and a Miami Heat roster that had plenty of holes a few days ago suddenly seems revamped.\n\nHaslem signed a one-year deal worth $4 million — significantly more than he originally expected — and Miami decided to match a $50-million, four-year offer sheet that Johnson received from the Nets.\n\nMeanwhile, a person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that guard Wayne Ellington has agreed to a $12-million, two-year deal with the Heat.\n\nThe Heat will become Ellington’s seventh team in eight seasons. He spent his first three years in Minnesota and has been on the move often since, playing for Memphis, Cleveland, Dallas, the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn since.\n\nEllington averaged 7.7 points last season for the Nets. His career high for three-pointers in a game is seven, done twice — both times against Miami, first in 2012 when he was with the Grizzlies and against last December while with Brooklyn.\n\nDaniels agrees to 3-year deal with Grizzlies\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have acquired guard Troy Daniels and have agreed to terms with him on a three-year contract, according to tweets from the player and his representatives. Priority Sports tweeted congratulations to Daniels on his three-year deal. Daniels confirmed in a tweet that “my journey will continue” with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThe acquisition was first reported by Yahoo Sports, which said Daniels agreed to terms on a three-year, $10-million contract and came to Memphis in a sign-and-trade with the Charlotte Hornets. Daniels, 24, sent a tweet expressing his gratitude to Charlotte and calling the Hornets organization “first class.”\n\nDaniels, a 6-foot-4 guard from VCU, averaged 5.6 points, 1.3 rebounds and 11.1 minutes in 43 games for Charlotte this past season.\n\nBlazers sign Warriors center Ezeli\n\nA person familiar with the deal confirms that the Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to a two-year contract with free agent center Festus Ezeli worth $15 million.\n\nEzeli, a 6-foot-11 native of Nigeria, was drafted with the 30th pick in the 2012 draft by the Golden State Warriors. Last season, he averaged 7.0 points and 5.6 rebounds in 64 games, including 13 starts.\n\nEzeli missed 31 games this season after having arthroscopic surgery in February to remove debris from his left knee.\n\nThe Blazers also announced they had acquired guard Shabazz Napier in a trade with the Orlando Magic for cash considerations.\n\nKnicks sign Lithuanian forward Kuzminskas\n\nThe New York Knicks signed Lithuanian forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas on Saturday.\n\nA 6-foot-9, 215-pound player, Kuzminskas has averaged 8.3 points and 2.9 rebounds in 221 career games over seven seasons with Siauliai (Lithuania), Zalgris (Lithuania) and Malaga (Spain). He is a four-time Lithuanian all-star (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) and three-time Lithuanian national champion (2011, 2012, 2013).\n\nKuzminskas, 26, scored 12 points on 48.6-percent shooting, and pulled in 3.4 rebounds in 23 games for Malaga last season.\n\nWarriors bring back Clark\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have re-signed free agent guard Ian Clark.\n\nClark played 66 games for Golden State last season, averaging 3.6 points in 8.8 minutes per game. He also has played for Utah and Denver in his three-year career.\n\nDellavedova to Bucks in sign-and-trade\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers sent Matthew Dellavedova to the Milwaukee Bucks in a sign-and-trade that created a $4.8-million trade exception the Cavs then used to absorb Mike Dunleavy’s salary from the Chicago Bulls. The Cavs and Bulls agreed to the deal for Dunleavy late Wednesday, but held off on making it official until completing the Dellavedova deal first.\n\nTrade exceptions cannot be combined. By creating a new one for Dunleavy, the Cavs preserved the full $9.7 million exception they created by trading Anderson Varejao last season that they hope to use on a more expensive player in the future.\n\nThe Cavs were going to lose Dellavedova anyway to the Bucks, who agreed to a deal with him early in free agency.\n\nIn addition to Dunleavy, the Cavs acquired the draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko from the Bulls and sent out the draft rights to Albert Miralles, who was acquired earlier in the day in the Bucks deal. Miralles is a 34-year-old who has spent his entire career overseas. The Cavs had to take something back in exchange for Dellavedova, but it couldn’t be a player in the NBA or else it would’ve triggered a hard cap for this season because of how far they are exceeding the luxury tax.\n\nVeremeenko is a 31-year-old who most recently played in Italy. He is not an NBA prospect.\n\nAnother season for Ginobili\n\nManu Ginobili has ended any doubt, as if there ever was any to begin with: The Argentinian star tweets that he is returning to the San Antonio Spurs on a one-year deal.\n\nGinobili previously posted a message on social media saying he had decided to play another season in the NBA. But he didn’t mention the Spurs, which led some to wonder if he would head to another team after spending the first 14 years of his career in San Antonio.\n\nIt was a highly unlikely scenario, and one that Ginobili clarified Thursday. He tweets: “Happy to tell you guys that I’ll be coming back to the Spurs for another season. #backhome.”\n\nGinobili will turn 39 later this month.\n\nDwyane Wade going home to Chicago\n\nDwyane Wade is going home, making what he called “an extremely emotional and tough decision” to leave the Miami Heat after 13 seasons and sign with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nWade, 34, will sign a two-year deal with the Bulls, one that will pay him about $47 million. Miami offered $40 million over two years for Wade to stay in the uniform that he has worn his entire career, the one in which he was an All-Star 12 times, a champion three times and the NBA Finals MVP in 2006 when his rise to superstardom was just beginning.\n\n“This was not an easy decision, but I feel I have made the right choice for myself and my family,” Wade wrote in a letter to Miami, released to the Associated Press. “Watching the Bulls growing up inspired me at an early age to pursue my dream of becoming a basketball player. My most treasured memories were watching my dad play basketball on the courts of Fermi Elementary School and developing my game at the Blue Island Recreation Center. I have never forgotten where I came from and I am thankful to have an opportunity to play for the team that first fueled my love of the game.”\n\nIt ends a second consecutive summer of will-he-or-won’t-he talk and worry in Miami, which was able to keep him last summer after contentious negotiations led to a $20-million, one-year deal. The Heat spoke with him Wednesday in New York, in an effort to keep him, the same day that Wade also took meetings with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Denver Nuggets.\n\nTo make room under the salary cap for Wade, the Bulls agreed to trade forward Mike Dunleavy to Cleveland and former Pistons point guard Jose Calderon (and two second-round picks) to the Lakers.\n\nSpurs add rim protector in Dedmon\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that Dewayne Dedmon has agreed to terms on a two-year, $6-million contract with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDedmon is a 26-year-old, 7-foot center who spent the last two-plus seasons in Orlando. He gives the Spurs another rim protector and defensive presence off the bench. He also serves as some insurance should longtime franchise centerpiece Tim Duncan retire.\n\nDedmon has also played for Golden State and Philadelphia in his young career.\n\nMavs add Harrison Barnes\n\nThe Mavericks have signed free agent forward Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $94-million maximum contract.\n\nDallas owner Mark Cuban tweeted a picture shortly after the NBA’s moratorium ended, showing the former Golden State player playfully handcuffed to president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson, with both smiling.\n\nIt was a lighthearted reference to the jolting loss of DeAndre Jordan in free agency last year, when the center backed out of an agreement with Dallas and returned to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nBarnes became an unrestricted free agent when the Warriors renounced his rights to clear salary cap space after getting a commitment from Kevin Durant.\n\nLeandro Barbosa returning to Phoenix\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have agreed to a two-year contract with Brazilian guard Leandro Barbosa to return to the franchise, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe deal is for $4 million each year with $500,000 guaranteed for the second year. It means Barbosa will receive either $8 million for two years or $4.5 million for one year if the Suns decide not to keep him the second year.\n\nThe 33-year-old Brazilian spent his first seven NBA seasons with Phoenix and was back with the Suns in 2013-14. He played a reserve role for the Golden State Warriors the past two seasons.\n\nRockets nab new center Nene from Wizards\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Houston Rockets have agreed to terms with Nene on a one-year, $2.9-million deal.\n\nThe move should help the team address the departure of center Dwight Howard.\n\nNene averaged 9.2 points and 4.6 rebounds in 57 games for the Washington Wizards last season. When healthy, the Brazilian remains a formidable presence in the paint who can give the offensive-minded Rockets some needed toughness.\n\nHoward left after three tumultuous seasons in Houston to sign with his hometown Atlanta Hawks.\n\nGalloway, New Orleans agree on 2-year deal\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the New Orleans Pelicans and former New York Knicks guard Langston Galloway have agreed to terms on a two-year contract.\n\nGalloway, a Louisiana native, effectively confirmed his decision on his verified Twitter account, writing: “I’m coming home #neworleanspelicans.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Galloway averaged 7.6 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in about 25 minutes per game for the Knicks last season.\n\nTimberwolves agree with Rush: 1 year, $3.5M\n\nThe agent for Brandon Rush says he has agreed to a one-year, $3.5-million deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHe gives them some much-needed shooting off the bench. Rush averaged 4.2 points in 72 games for the Golden State Warriors last season. He has overcome some serious knee issues to resume his career and has shot 40% from three-point range in eight seasons.\n\nThe Timberwolves badly needed to add a shooter to a team that was near the bottom of the league in three-point field goals and attempts last season.\n\nRush is the second signing of a quiet summer for the Timberwolves. They added center Cole Aldrich on Monday.\n\nHornets get backup point guard Brian Roberts\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Charlotte Hornets have agreed to terms on a one-year contact with point guard Brian Roberts. It's worth the league veteran minimum of $1.05 million.\n\nRoberts, 30, is expected to be the team’s third point guard behind Kemba Walker and Ramon Sessions.\n\nThe 30-year-old Roberts played last season with Charlotte before being traded to Memphis as part of a package deal for guard Courtney Lee. Roberts was sent to the Miami Heat and finally traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nHe averaged 4.8 points, 1.3 assists in 30 games last season for the Hornets.\n\nMavericks keep Dirk, add the other Curry\n\nDirk Nowitzki’s new contract will give the Dallas forward a chance spend 20 seasons with the only franchise he has ever played for.\n\nThe Mavericks and Nowitzki have reached agreement on a two-year, $40-million contract, a person with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Nowitzki will have a player option in the second year.\n\nThe person also said the Mavericks have agreed to a two-year, $6-million contract with free agent guard Seth Curry, the younger brother of two-time MVP Stephen Curry.\n\nAt $20 million per season, Nowitzki’s deal is a significant raise for the 38-year-old, who opted out of the final year of a three-year, $25-million deal that was a huge discount for the Mavericks. It helped them get Chandler Parsons in free agency two years ago, although he is leaving for a max deal in Memphis.\n\nThe 25-year-old Curry will be on his fifth team in four seasons. After playing sparingly for Memphis, Cleveland and Phoenix his first three years, Curry averaged 6.8 points and 1.5 assists in 44 games for Sacramento last season.\n\nDavid West's quest to continue at Golden State\n\nDavid West agreed to a one-year deal with the Warriors for the veteran’s minimum, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Kevin Durant shook the NBA landscape with his decision to leave Oklahoma City for Golden State, West jumped at the chance to join him in the Bay Area.\n\nIt will be his 14th season in the league, and he has yet to capture a championship. But joining a team with four All-Stars and two MVPs should give him the best chance yet.\n\nJason Smith goes to Washington\n\nJason Smith has agreed with the Washington Wizards to terms on a three-year, $16- million deal, agent Mark Bartelstein, told ESPN.\n\nSmith averaged 7.2 points and 2.9 rebounds per game with the Orlando Magic last season.\n\nHornets agree to add Hibbert, Sessions\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets have added some depth in free agency.\n\nCenter Roy Hibbert and point guard Ramon Sessions agreed to terms with the Hornets, a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press. Hibbert will receive one-year deal worth $5 million, and Sessions will get a two-year deal worth $12.3 million with a team option for the second season.\n\nHibbert, 29, gives the Hornets a replacement for Al Jefferson, who agreed to a three-year, $30 million free-agent deal with the Indiana Pacers. He is expected to back up Cody Zeller, who made a successful transition from power forward to center last season.\n\nSessions was hoping for a shot at a starting point guard spot after averaging 9.9 points and 2.2 assists last season with Washington Wizards, but he will return to Charlotte to back up Kemba Walker.\n\n76ers to pick up Henderson, Spanish PG\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that the Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to terms with guard Gerald Henderson on a two-year deal worth $18 million.\n\nHenderson averaged 8.7 points in his first season with Portland. He spent the first six seasons of his career in Charlotte before being traded to the Trail Blazers, where he was a valuable two-way player that helped make them one of the surprising success stories of last season.\n\nHenderson grew up in the Philadelphia area before going to Duke. The 28-year-old joins Jerryd Bayless as veteran additions to the Philly backcourt.\n\nThe Sixers also secured veteran point guard Sergio Rodriguez to a one-year, $8-million deal.\n\nRodriguez played the last five seasons for Real Madrid. The 6-foot-3, 180-pounder averaged 10.8 points, 5.8 assists and 2.3 turnovers in 24 minutes per game last season. He shot 46% from the field and 38% on three-pointers.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns selected Rodriguez with the 27th overall pick of the 2006 draft before trading him to the Portland Trail Blazers on draft night. He played three seasons in Portland before being shipped to the Sacramento Kings on June 25, 2009. Then he was traded to New York Knicks on Feb. 18, 2010. Rodriguez returned to Spain after that season.\n\nWith just a one-year deal, Rodriguez, 30, appears to be a stop-gap option until next summer, when elite point guards Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry are scheduled to become free agents.\n\nClippers reportedly keeping Mbah a Moute\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers found a rare bargain amid the free agency spending frenzy, reportedly agreeing to a two-year, $4.5-million contract with veteran forward Luc Mbah a Moute.\n\nThe deal first reported by the Vertical was for the Clippers’ biannual exception and includes a $2.3-million player option in the second year.\n\nRetaining Mbah a Moute presumably completes the Clippers’ starting lineup for next season. Mbah a Moute was perhaps the team’s most pleasant surprise among its newcomers last season, his defensive versatility prompting coach Doc Rivers to slot him as a starter for the bulk of the season.\n\nMbah a Moute, 29, averaged only 3.1 points and 2.3 rebounds per game, but his defensive metrics more than compensated for his meager offensive output.\n\nThe Clippers have now kept four of their own free agents after agreeing to re-sign Jamal Crawford, Austin Rivers and Wesley Johnson in addition to Mbah a Moute. The team lost two players it wanted to bring back after Jeff Green agreed to a contract with the Orlando Magic and Cole Aldrich agreed to a deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nBrandon Jennings goes to Knicks\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says that former Detroit Pistons point guard Brandon Jennings has agreed to a deal with the New York Knicks.\n\nJennings will finally join the Knicks after they passed on him in the 2009 NBA draft, the person told the Associated Press, confirming reports of the point guard’s one-year, $5 million deal.\n\nThe Knicks took forward Jordan Hill with the No. 8 pick in 2009. Jennings went two picks later to Milwaukee, and he hurt the Knicks with a series of strong performances when he played against them. Now he will come to New York as the backup to Derrick Rose, whom the Knicks acquired from Chicago in a trade last month.\n\nJennings was limited to 48 games last season with Detroit and then Orlando after he was traded at midseason. He has averaged 15.5 points and 5.9 assists in 460 games.\n\nThe Knicks also are re-signing small forward Lance Thomas to a multiyear deal worth $6 million, according to ESPN.\n\nThe Knicks have a new coach in Jeff Hornacek. And New York traded for Derrick Rose late last month, then got Rose’s former Chicago teammate, Joakim Noah, to agree to a $72-million, four-year deal.\n\nPau Gasol to join Spurs' front line\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs didn’t waste any time after losing out in the Kevin Durant sweepstakes. The Spurs agreed to a two-year deal with veteran forward Pau Gasol, a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press.\n\nThe deal is worth more than $30 million, and final terms will be completed after the Spurs make a move or two to create the necessary cap space.\n\nGasol has been one of the league’s most talented and versatile big men for the last 15 years. He spent the last two seasons in Chicago and averaged 16.5 points, 11.0 rebounds and 4.1 assists this year, his game showing few signs of aging even as he prepares to turn 36 on Wednesday.\n\nWarriors score biggest free agent: Durant\n\nKevin Durant is joining All-Stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nDurant made the decision public on the Players’ Tribune. ESPN's Marc Stein reports the contract will be for two years and $54.3 million, with a player option after the first year.\n\nDurant's decision has been the most highly anticipated move of the summer. The 2014 MVP and four-time scoring champion led the Oklahoma City Thunder to the NBA Finals in 2012, and to the Western Conference finals in four of the past six years — and he’s only 27. He recovered from a broken bone in his right foot that cost him much of last season to post one of the best years of his career.\n\nDurant met with the Thunder, Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat.\n\nAnd after agreeing to trade Andrew Bogut to the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State has agreed to add former Mavs center Zaza Pachulia with its $2.9-million cap exception.\n\nRajon Rondo heading to the Bulls\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that Rajon Rondo is going to the Chicago Bulls, agreeing on a $30-million, two-year deal.\n\nRondo essentially becomes the Bulls’ replacement at point guard for Derrick Rose, the former NBA MVP who was traded to the New York Knicks last month.\n\nChicago becomes Rondo’s fourth team in less than two years. He spent his first eight full NBA seasons in Boston, winning a championship with the Celtics in 2008. The Celtics traded him to Dallas in December 2014, and Rondo spent last season in Sacramento.\n\nMavs to bring back Deron Williams, Dwight Powell\n\nDeron Williams is re-upping with his hometown Dallas Mavericks, who are also bringing back promising young forward Dwight Powell.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the deals said Williams has agreed to a one-year, $10-million contract, while Powell is set for a four-year deal worth $37 million.\n\nPowell is a restricted free agent, which means Dallas could have matched any offer from another team.\n\nWilliams reversed a three-year decline in scoring last season by averaging 14.1 points to go with a team-high 5.8 assists per game.\n\nPowell, who turns 25 this month, is all Dallas has left to show for the ill-fated Rajon Rondo trade with Boston in December 2014. The Mavericks like his athleticism, and he is coming off career-high averages of 5.8 points and 4.0 rebounds in his fourth season.\n\nClippers to keep ex-Wolverine Jamal Crawford\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that Jamal Crawford has agreed to stay with the Los Angeles Clippers and will sign a $42-million, three-year contract.\n\nCrawford was the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year this past season, the third time he’s won that award. He averaged 14.2 points in 27 minutes per game for the Clippers, and averaged 17.3 points in the team’s six playoff games.\n\nThe 36-year-old Crawford has appeared in 1,100 regular-season games. At the end of last season, only nine active players had been in more.\n\nCeltics set to sign All-Star Al Horford\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that prized free agent Al Horford (Grand Ledge) has agreed to terms on a four-year, $113-million deal with the Boston Celtics.\n\nHorford made his decision after spending most of the first two days meeting with the Wizards, Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks, the team that drafted him.\n\nHorford, however, made it clear with a simple tweet: “Celtic pride,” it said, followed by 18 shamrocks.\n\nHorford spent his first nine seasons in Atlanta, but the Hawks agreed to terms with Dwight Howard and Kent Bazemore on big-money deals, leaving them little room for their centerpiece. Atlanta could have made a trade or two to create enough room to keep him as well, but by Saturday Horford was already starting to look elsewhere.\n\nNets will add Booker\n\nForward Trevor Booker is leaving Utah for the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThe deal was first reported by the Salt Lake Tribune, which said Booker would get about $18 million over two years.\n\nBooker averaged 5.9 points in 79 games last season for the Jazz. It was his second season in Utah after spending his first four seasons with Washington.\n\nHawks to pick up Euroleague star Delaney\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that guard Malcolm Delaney, a Euroleague star, has agreed to a $1.49-million, two-year contract offer from the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Delaney, from Virginia Tech, was an all-Euroleague All-Star in his second season playing for the Russian team Lokomotiv Kuban. He will be a candidate to play behind point guard Dennis Schroder, the team’s new starter after Jeff Teague was traded to Indiana.\n\nDelaney, 27, was not drafted in 2011.\n\nKnicks stay active, will add Courtney Lee\n\nCourtney Lee has accepted a four-year contract offer worth about $50 million from the New York Knicks, a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press.\n\nThe Knicks will become the seventh team for the well-traveled Lee, who just finished his eighth NBA season. Lee averaged 9.6 points last season for Memphis and Charlotte, matching his career average.\n\nLee has also played for Orlando, New Jersey, Houston and Boston. He’s also been to the playoffs five times, including each of the past four seasons.\n\nThe Knicks have a new coach in Jeff Hornacek. And New York traded for Derrick Rose late last month, then got Rose’s former Chicago teammate, Joakim Noah, to agree to a $72-million, four-year deal.\n\nTimberwolves to add Cole Adrich\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed to a three-year, $22-million contract with free agent center Cole Aldrich.\n\nAldrich is a native of the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington. He was the 11th overall pick in 2010 and has played for Oklahoma City, Houston, Sacramento, New York and the Clippers.\n\nHe will slide into the big man rotation in Minnesota with Karl-Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng.\n\nAnderson, Gordon agree to terms with Rockets\n\nThe Houston Rockets are loading up on shooting for new coach Mike D’Antoni.\n\nThe Rockets agreed to terms with forward Ryan Anderson and guard Eric Gordon to add even more scoring punch around James Harden, two people with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press.\n\nAnderson is getting four years and $80 million, while Gordon agreed on a four-year, $53-million contract.\n\nThe 28-year-old Anderson spent the past four seasons with New Orleans and has been one of the NBA’s top three-point shooters in recent years. He averaged 17 points and six rebounds last season.\n\nGordon spent the previous five seasons in New Orleans, with the Pelicans hoping he could be the perimeter scorer they needed to take some of the attention away from Anthony Davis on the interior.\n\nFormer Pistons Afflalo, Tolliver go to Kings\n\nThe Sacramento Kings have added two dependable veterans to the roster as they try to stabilize what has been a chaotic situation on the court and in the front office.\n\nThe Kings agreed to terms on a two-year, $25-million deal with guard Arron Afflalo and a two-year, $16-million deal for Anthony Tolliver, both former Pistons.\n\nAfflalo averaged 12.8 points and shot 38% on three-pointers for the New York Knicks last season, his ninth in the NBA.\n\nTolliver has spent the past two seasons in Detroit, playing about 20 minutes a night as a reserve. He can guard multiple positions, play small forward or power forward on offense and is a career 36% three-point shooter.\n\nTolliver had extensive discussions with Washington, Toronto and Minnesota before ultimately coming to an agreement with Sacramento.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that guard Garrett Temple also has accepted a $24-million, three-year contract offer from the Kings.\n\nIt will be the second stint with the Kings for Temple, who appeared in five games for Sacramento in the 2009-10 season. He’s also played for Washington, San Antonio, Charlotte, Houston and Milwaukee.\n\nThe 30-year-old Temple spent the last four seasons with the Wizards, averaging 4.6 points in that span and a career-best 7.3 points last season.\n\nMarvin Williams to stay in Charlotte\n\nMarvin Williams is staying put.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets agreed to terms with the veteran forward on a four-year deal worth $54 million, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.\n\nThe 30-year-old Williams averaged 11.7 points and 6.4 rebounds for the Hornets last season while shooting a career-best 40.2% from three-point range. For his career, Williams has averaged 10.5 points and 5.2 rebounds.\n\nWizards nab big men Mahinmi, Nicholson\n\nWith no roster depth at center, the Washington Wizards agreed to pay Ian Mahinmi $64 million over four years, according to a person familiar with the deal.\n\nMahinmi’s Twitter account had a message directed at the Wizards’ account, saying: “let’s goooo.”\n\nMahinmi should be able to provide defense and rebounding for the Wizards. He is a 6-foot-11, 250-pound center who averaged career highs of 9.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 1.5 assists and about 25 minutes in 71 games, all starts, for the Indiana Pacers last season.\n\nThe 29-year-old from France was drafted in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs in 2005 and made his NBA debut in the 2007-08 season. For his career, he has averaged 5.1 points and 4.3 rebounds in less than 17 minutes.\n\nThe Wizards also agreed to a deal with power forward Andrew Nicholson for $26 million over four years. The 6-foot-9, 250-pound Canadian averaged 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds last season, while playing under 15 minutes per game, for the Orlando Magic. He appeared in 56 games, all as a substitute.\n\nSince being the 19th overall draft pick in 2012 by Orlando, Nicholson has averaged 6.5 points and 3.2 rebounds in four NBA seasons, with a total of 36 starts.\n\nMagic grab Biyombo on 4-year deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press the Orlando Magic are landing free agent center Bismack Biyombo with a four-year deal. The Vertical reports the deal is for $72 million.\n\nBiyombo was labeled a bust during his time in Charlotte but had a breakout year to help the Toronto Raptors reach the Eastern Conference finals last season.\n\nNow he will be paired in the frontcourt with recently acquired Serge Ibaka to give the Magic a defensive-minded tandem under new coach Frank Vogel.\n\nDoc Rivers keeps his son, Austin, with Clippers\n\nAustin Rivers will keep playing for his father with the Clippers.\n\nRivers agreed to stay in Los Angeles, where Doc Rivers’ son was the backup to point guard Chris Paul.\n\nAustin Rivers’ agency, ASM Sports, sent a tweet congratulating the No. 10 pick in the 2012 draft on a deal that Yahoo Sports reported was for three years and more than $35 million.\n\nRivers is coming off his most productive season, averaging 8.9 points in 67 games. He started the final two games of the Clippers’ first-round loss to Portland after Paul broke his right hand in Game 4.\n\nLakers hand Luol Deng $72 million\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to terms with veteran forward Luol Deng on a four-year contract worth $72 million.\n\nThe 31-year-old Deng averaged 12.3 points and 6.0 rebounds for Miami last season. He has spent the last two years with the Heat.\n\nHe is a hard-nosed, defensive forward who can play multiple positions and provide solid offense. His leadership should be key for a young Lakers team that at times struggled with maturity last season.\n\nHoward coming home to Atlanta, Bazemore stays put\n\nDwight Howard agreed to join the Atlanta Hawks, who also re-signed Kent Bazemore during a busy first day of free agency.\n\nHoward received a three-year contract worth $70.5 million, while Bazemore will get $70 million over four years, a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press.\n\nHoward returns to his hometown after three seasons in Houston, where he battled injuries and wasn’t the force he was earlier in his career. He managed just 13.7 points per game last season, lowest since he averaged 12 as a rookie for Orlando after being taken with the No. 1 selection in the 2004 draft out of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy.\n\nBazemore, who turned 27 on Friday, started 68 games for the Hawks last season, averaging 11.6 points while taking the starting spot held by DeMarre Carroll before he signed in Toronto.\n\nConley gets richest contract in NBA history to stay in Memphis\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the negotiations tells The Associated Press that Mike Conley is staying with the Memphis Grizzlies after agreeing to a five-year, $153 million deal.\n\nKeeping Conley was Memphis’ clear top priority, evidenced by the lengths that the team went to — not just financially, but in terms of effort. The Grizzlies released an elaborate video with teammates like Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph (Michigan State) boasting of Conley’s meaning to the team, parts of that video even including an orchestra to play off the point guard being Memphis’ maestro.\n\nNoah following Rose from Chicago to N.Y. Knicks\n\nFirst Derrick Rose, then Joakim Noah. The New York Knicks are hoping the road to their turnaround starts in Chicago.\n\nNoah agreed to a four-year deal worth $72 million, returning to his hometown and joining his former Bulls teammate in New York, a person with knowledge of the details told the Associated Press.\n\nThe Knicks filled the center spot that opened when they dealt Robin Lopez to Chicago by turning to the versatile Noah, a New York native who has spent his entire career with the Bulls.\n\nNoah battled injuries last season and was limited to a career-low 29 games, but Rose said he wanted his former teammate in New York with him after the Knicks acquired him from the Bulls last week. Noah made it clear that was his goal Friday when he posted a photo of himself on Instagram slipping on a Knicks hat.\n\nJoe Johnson joining Jazz for 2 years, $22 million\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Utah Jazz have agreed to terms with Joe Johnson on a two-year deal worth $22 million.\n\nJohnson gives the up-and-coming Jazz a proven scorer and level-headed veteran as they try to climb the ladder in the Western Conference. The seven-time All-Star turned 35 this week.\n\nHe averaged 12.2 points and shot 38% from three-point range while playing with Brooklyn and Miami last season.\n\nJeff Green headed to Orlando; Fournier staying with Magic\n\nJeff Green is on his way to Orlando, giving the Magic another veteran to add to a young core.\n\nGreen’s agent, David Falk, says his client agreed to terms on a deal. Several outlets have reported it’s a one-year deal worth $15 million.\n\nGreen averaged 11.7 points and 4.2 rebounds in 80 games for the Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers last season. He joins Serge Ibaka and former Piston D.J. Augustin as part of a revamped Magic roster that is adding more experience around younger players such as Elfrid Payton, Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon.\n\nGreen will be entering his ninth NBA season. He has also played for Seattle/Oklahoma City and Boston.\n\nMeanwhile, a person familiar with the negotiations says swingman Evan Fournier has agreed to a five-year contract to remain with the Magic. Earlier this week, the Magic extended a qualifying offer to Fournier in order to be able to match any offers he received.\n\nBut the Magic and Fournier didn’t allow it to get that far. The Magic had made it known that re-signing Fournier was a top priority.\n\nBlazers dole out $70 million to Evan Turner\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have signed free agent Evan Turner to a four-year, $70-million contract.\n\nTurner’s agent, Kevin Bradbury, confirmed the deal first reported by Yahoo Sports. The former Ohio State star drew interest from several teams.\n\nTurner, who was drafted No. 2 overall by the 76ers in 2010, spent the last two seasons with the Boston Celtics. Last year, the 6-foot-7 wing averaged 10.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists as Boston’s sixth man.\n\nPelicans sign former Pacer Solomon Hill\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the New Orleans Pelicans and former Indiana Pacers forward Solomon Hill have agreed to a four-year free agent contract worth about $50 million.\n\nHill is expected to enter training camp as a front-runner to start at small forward.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Hill has averaged 6.0 points and 3.1 rebounds in his first three NBA seasons since the Pacers drafted him 23rd overall in 2013. He averaged 7.7 points and four rebounds in seven playoff games this past season.\n\nMemphis lands Parsons for 4 years, $94M\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the situation tell the Associated Press that free agent forward Chandler Parsons has agreed to terms with the Memphis Grizzlies on a four-year deal worth $94 million.\n\nParsons also met with the Portland Trail Blazers before deciding on Memphis.\n\nHe averaged 16.7 points and 5.7 rebounds for the Dallas Mavericks the last two seasons, but has dealt with injuries that limited him 127 games over that span.\n\nJefferson goes to Pacers\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Indiana Pacers have agreed to terms with big man Al Jefferson on a three-year contract worth $30 million.\n\nThe 31-year-old Jefferson is an old-school post player who missed significant time for the Charlotte Hornets last season with a knee injury.\n\nHe averaged 12.0 points and 6.4 rebounds in 47 games for the Hornets, who also lost Jeremy Lin in free agency.\n\nNets pick up backup center Hamilton\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have signed center Justin Hamilton to a two-year contract.\n\nAgent Mark Bartelstein said Friday the contract is for $6 million.\n\nThe Nets were in need of size up front to help Brook Lopez after trading Thaddeus Young to Indiana and not re-signing Willie Reed. The 7-foot Hamilton has averaged 5.0 points in 49 career NBA games.\n\nDudley going back to Phoenix for 3 years, $30 million\n\nJared Dudley is returning to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nDudley and his management company announced agreement Friday night on a three-year, $30-million contract.\n\nThe 30-year-old forward played for the Suns from the middle of the 2008-09 season through the 2012-13 campaign.\n\nDudley appeared in 81 games at power forward for the Washington Wizards last season, averaging 7.9 points. He was one of the NBA’s top three-point shooters, making 42% of his long-range shots.\n\nDudley fills a need for the Suns at the so-called “stretch-4” power forward slot. He also brings a veteran presence to an exceedingly young team, with a reputation of being well-liked by his teammates.\n\nBucks agree with Teletovic on 3-year, $30M deal\n\nThe agent for free agent forward Mirza Teletovic says his client has agreed to terms on a three-year, $30-million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThe deal reunites Teletovic with Bucks coach Jason Kidd, who coached him in Brooklyn. The Bosnian missed half of the season in 2014-15 while getting treated for a blood clot in his lungs.\n\nHe recovered and had a bounce-back season with the Phoenix Suns this past year. Teletovic averaged 12.0 points per game and shot 39% on three-pointers in 79 games for Phoenix.\n\nHe gives the shooting-starved Bucks a legitimate floor stretcher to give players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker more room to work.\n\nJeremy Lin going to Nets\n\nJeremy Lin is heading back to New York.\n\nLin tweeted that he was signing with the Brooklyn Nets. Terms were not immediately disclosed, and Lin cannot sign with Brooklyn until at least July 7 because of the NBA’s off-season moratorium.\n\nLin’s breakout in the NBA came in New York — with the Knicks — during the 2011-12 season. The craze was dubbed “Linsanity,” when the then-little-known second-year guard from Harvard scored at least 20 points nine times in a 10-game span and blossomed into one of the league’s biggest stories at that time.\n\nLin started with Golden State, then played for the Knicks and has spent the past four seasons with Houston, the Los Angeles Lakers and most recently Charlotte. He averaged 11.7 points per game last season.\n\nJerryd Bayless gets 3 years, $27M from 76ers\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to terms with point guard Jerryd Bayless on a three-year deal worth $27 million.\n\nThe 27-year-old Bayless was a valuable backup for the Milwaukee Bucks for the last two seasons. He averaged 10.4 points and 3.1 assists last season.\n\nBayless will give the 76ers an experienced point guard, which the team prioritized heading into free agency.\n\nLakers land Mozgov, keep Clarkson\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that center Timofey Mozgov has agreed to a four-year, $64-million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers moved swiftly in the opening minutes of the NBA’s free agent signing period to use a big portion of their roughly $55 million in cap room on the 7-foot-1 Mozgov, a six-year NBA veteran. He won a ring with the Cleveland Cavaliers last month but barely played in the postseason, averaging 5.8 minutes in 13 playoff appearances. He started 48 games for the Cavs during the regular season, averaging 6.3 points and 4.4 rebounds while making 56.5% of his shots.\n\nMeanwhile, guard Jordan Clarkson has agreed to a four-year, $50-million deal to return to the Lakers.\n\nClarkson is a rising star after two seasons with the Lakers, who acquired the 46th overall pick from Washington on draft night in 2014. The Missouri product has been a steady scorer and a rare bright spot on the two worst teams in Lakers history.\n\nAfter averaging 11.9 points per game and making the NBA’s all-Rrokie team in the 2014-15 season, he boosted his production to 15.5 points last season, second-most on the team behind Kobe Bryant.\n\nHassan Whiteside staying with Heat\n\nA person familiar with the terms of the agreement tells the Associated Press that Hassan Whiteside will be signing a four-year contract worth the maximum amount the Miami Heat could offer, roughly $98 million.\n\nWhiteside made his announcement on Snapchat and through a post on The Players Tribune, a few hours after he met with the Heat and the Dallas Mavericks in New York to hear their sales pitches. He went into those meetings leaning toward the Heat and apparently emerged even more convinced that staying with the franchise that helped him resuscitate his career was the best move.\n\nIt is life-changing money after a breakout season. Whiteside will be signing a contract worth roughly 100 times more than what he made this past season, when he averaged 14.2 points, 11.8 rebounds and a league-best 3.7 blocked shots per game. His career path is well-known, taking him to less-than-glamorous leagues in Lebanon and China, stints in the NBA Development League and even getting cut from teams at that level.\n\nThe Heat signed him in November 2014, and less than two years later, Whiteside has become one of the game’s most dominant centers — and one of the highest-paid players in Miami franchise history.\n\nMagic agrees to terms with PG D.J. Augustin\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Orlando Magic have agreed on a contract with former Detroit Pistons point guard D.J. Augustin.\n\nTerms of the deal were not immediately available.\n\nAdding Augustin gives new Magic coach Frank Vogel an experienced guard to play behind young starter Elfrid Payton. The 28-year-old Augustin played 62 games with Oklahoma City and Denver last season. He averaged 7.5 points and 3.2 assists in 19. minutes per game.\n\nHornets agree to terms with Batum on $120M deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that the Charlotte Hornets have agreed to terms on a five-year, $120-million deal to keep Nicolas Batum.\n\nBatum made no secret of wanting to stay in Charlotte and play for coach Steve Clifford, who helped revive his career after Batum was acquired in a trade with Portland.\n\nBatum averaged 14.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists for the Hornets last season and resumed his role as one of the top two-way small forwards in the game.\n\nAgent: Wizards, Beal agree on $128 contract\n\nThe Washington Wizards wasted no time in locking up shooting guard Bradley Beal, agreeing to a five-year maximum contract worth $128 million not long after the free agent market’s opening bell.\n\nBeal averaged 17.4 points in his fourth season for the Wizards. He has teamed with John Wall to form one of the most dynamic young backcourts in the NBA but has had difficulty staying healthy. Beal never has played more than 70 games in a season and has been bothered by stress fractures in his right leg throughout his career.\n\nHe played in only 55 games with 35 starts during Washington’s disappointing 2015-16 season. But he just turned 23, and the Wizards are banking on his ability to put those injuries behind him as they try to push back into the playoff field in the Eastern Conference.\n\nDeMar DeRozan staying with Raptors\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan is staying in Toronto after agreeing to the parameters of a deal.\n\nDeRozan and the Raptors still were in the process of completing terms, though the sides agreed that he would be staying put.\n\nDeRozan has spent all of his seven NBA seasons with the Raptors. He averaged a career-best 23.5 points this past season, when he helped Toronto reach the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nBriefly\n\n• Center Tarik Black is re-signing with the Los Angeles Lakers for two years and $12.85 million.\n\n• Small forward Matt Barnes, 36, is heading back to the Sacramento Kings for the first time since 2005, according to ESPN.\n\n• Former Bulls guard E'Twaun Moore is headed to the New Orleans Pelicans for four years and $34 million."
