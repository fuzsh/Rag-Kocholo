        "text": "Much like the Dallas Mavericks, Raymond Felton was left for dead. The Mavericks weren't expected to make the playoffs. Then, after being decimated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series, a sweep was expected. With J.J. Barea out due to injury, though, Felton was given a chance to shine. He did exactly that.\n\nFelton outplayed Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook down the stretch to lead the Mavericks to a shocking 85-84 win in Oklahoma City on Monday to even the series, 1-1. Felton had a team-best 21 points to go along with 11 rebounds and three assists. He took over down the stretch as the Mavericks joined a slew of other teams that have outplayed the Thunder in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Mavericks beat the Thunder by slowing them to a halt with a plodding, exacting game plan. Oklahoma City looked out of sorts all night, unable to get the offense going only two nights after running the Mavericks out of the gym. Durant was a dismal 7-of-33 from the field and 2-of-11 from deep on his way to 21 points. At 8-of-22 from the field with 19 points and 14 rebounds, Westbrook wasn't much better. No one on the Thunder could get going -- they shot 33.7 percent from the field and 21.9 percent from deep.\n\nThe fourth quarter was particularly ugly. The Thunder scored only six points in the final six minutes on two made field goals.\n\nFelton had six in that stretch, too, including a driving layup that gave the Mavericks an 83-81 lead with 28.7 seconds left.\n\nFelton did miss two free throws that would have put the game away, but Steven Adams' apparent game-winning buzzer-beater didn't actually beat the buzzer and the Mavericks held on.\n\nFelton, who has played for five NBA teams, was only playing in his 26th playoff game in his 11-year career, and he entered the night averaging 11.7 points per postseason game. On Monday night, however, he was the best player on the court down the stretch.\n\nNow the Mavericks have turned this first-round series on its head. Not only did they tie the series, they also found the blueprint to beat the Thunder. If they can continue to slow the game down and force OKC to play at their pace, they can keep the game close heading into the fourth. Once there, perhaps they can rely on Felton to hang with two of the NBA's best -- two players who can't figure out how to close out a game.\n\n2 other things\n\nEven without Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors are going to be just fine against the Houston Rockets\n\nCurry sat out Game 2 after tweaking his right ankle in the first half of Game 1, but the Rockets couldn't take advantage. Instead, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were fantastic. Thompson had 34 to lead the Warriors, and Iguodala added 18. Iguodala is still recovering from an ankle injury of his own, and Monday's game was a big step for the Warriors' championship hopes -- Iguodala being healthy is a key factor if the Warriors hope to repeat. Getting past the Rockets shouldn't be a problem. If Houston can't hang with Curry on the bench, they might as well call it a season now. Especially if they're going to play defense like this.\n\nFortunately for the Rockets, their season will be over in two games barring a miracle.\n\nThe curse of the Toronto Raptors isn't real, but it might be for DeMar DeRozan\n\nAfter losing seven consecutive playoff games, the Raptors finally got over the hump on Monday. They pulled away from the Indiana Pacers in the fourth quarter to win 98-87 and even the series at one apiece. The Raptors were led by Jonas Valanciunas (23 points and 15 rebounds) and Kyle Lowry (18 points and nine assists), but DeRozan's playoff struggles continued. He had only 10 points on 5-of-18 shooting, and was forcing it all night. He works best when he's attacking the lane, but he attacks best when he lets his spots come to him. Fortunately for DeRozan, his teammates picked up the slack on Monday. If the Raptors are going to make a run in the East, however, they're going to need regular season DeRozan to show up.\n\nPlay of the night\n\nThe Mavericks found their blueprint to beat the Thunder, but even with that, they were this close to going down 2-0.\n\n4 fun things\n\nMavericks players tweeted out Crying Jordan memes and jokes after beating the Thunder in Game 2.\n\nCharlie Villanueva tried to break up Russell Westbrook's pregame dance party.\n\nAndre Iguodala was in a playoff game and compared it to playing a scrimmage.\n\nJames Harden threw a pass so bad the announcer had to explain what it was.\n\nScores\n\nRaptors 98, Pacers 87 (Raptors HQ recap | Indy Cornrows recap)\n\nMavericks 85, Thunder 84 (Mavs Moneyball recap | Welcome to Loud City recap)\n\nWarriors 115, Rockets 106 (Golden State of Mind recap | The Dream Shake recap)\n\n* * *"
