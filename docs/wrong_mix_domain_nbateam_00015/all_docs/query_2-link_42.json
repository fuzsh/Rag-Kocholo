        "text": "With NBA free agency in full swing, Sam Amick, Jeff Zillgitt and the rest of the NBA team at USA TODAY Sports will be with you every step of the way, keeping you up-to-date on all of the moves made throughout the league.\n\nNote: A blue hyperlink redirects to a separate story or tweet. Now that the league's moratorium period is over, a * signifies that a contract has been officially signed.\n\nThe agreements\n\nQuincy Acy • PF • Sacramento Kings (New team: Dallas Mavericks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, veteran’s minimum with the Mavericks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: After hopping around between the Raptors, Kings and Knicks during his first four seasons, Acy, 25, will bring a high-energy playing style off the bench for Dallas. He averaged 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds in 14.8 minutes for the Kings last season.\n\nArron Afflalo • SG • New York Knicks (New team: Sacramento Kings)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $25 million with the Kings (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: At 30 years old, Afflalo isn't the defensive player that he once was, but, all in all, a solid move for a Kings team that traded away one of their best three-point shooters on draft day in Marco Belinelli. Afflalo shot 38.2% from beyond the arc (1.3 makes per game) with the Knicks last season.\n\nCole Aldrich • C • Los Angeles Clippers (New team: Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $22 million with the Timberwolves (AP)\n\nAnalysis: An NBA journeyman and Minnesota native, Aldrich most recently played for the Los Angeles Clippers, where he averaged 5.5 points and 4.8 rebounds in 13.3 minutes. He's nothing more than your typical backup big man, but he plays solid defense and cleans up the glass. He ranked ninth in the league in rebounds per-48 minutes last year (17.3) and third in blocks (4.08).\n\nChris Andersen • PF/C • Memphis Grizzlies (New team: Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nContract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Cavaliers (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Andersen rejoins his ex-Heat teammate LeBron James in Cleveland, but at 38, he's nothing more than a locker room guy and a depth addition. In 27 games with the Grizzlies and Heat last season, he averaged 3.3 points and 2.9 rebounds.\n\nRyan Anderson • PF • New Orleans Pelicans (New team: Houston Rockets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $80 million with the Rockets (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Anderson — one of the NBA's best three-point shooting bigs — played a vital role off the bench for the Pelicans over the past four seasons. He now joins a Rockets team that isn't afraid to let it fly from beyond the arc and struggles defensively, so he'll fit right in.\n\nDarrell Arthur • PF • Denver Nuggets\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $23 million with the Nuggets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Your typical role-playing big man, Arthur has career averages of 6.7 points and 3.7 rebounds. He makes most of his impact on the defensive end.\n\nD.J. Augustin • PG • Denver Nuggets (New team: Orlando Magic)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $29 million with the Magic (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: This was far from a franchise-altering move, but Augustin is a proven backup point guard who brings a veteran presence to one of the NBA's youngest rosters.\n\nLeandro Barbosa • SG • Golden State Warriors (New team: Phoenix Suns)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $8 million with the Suns (Paul Coro, USAT network)\n\nAnalysis: The Brazilian Blur began his career with the Suns and played there for his first seven seasons (2003-10) where he thrived as a sharpshooter off the bench. After spending time with the Raptors, Pacers and Celtics, he briefly went back to Phoenix (20 games, 2012-14 season) before joining the championship-winning Warriors, where he spent the past two seasons. At 33, he's not the explosive player that he once was, but he can still be a valuable asset for a Phoenix team in need of some veteran leadership.\n\nAndrea Bargnani • PF/C • Brooklyn Nets (New team: Saski Baskonia)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year deal with Spanish club Saski Baskonia\n\nAnalysis: Bargnani — the former No. 1 overall pick (2006) — hasn't played an NBA game since February (buyout). He most recently played for the Brooklyn Nets, where he averaged career-lows of 6.6 points and 2.1 rebounds in 46 games. At 30 years old, this is likely the end of his 10-year NBA career.\n\nHarrison Barnes • SF • Golden State Warriors (New team: Dallas Mavericks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $95 million offer sheet from the Mavericks (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: With Kevin Durant's decision to take his talents to The Bay, Barnes — a restricted free agent who has spent his entire career with Golden State — is headed to Dallas. Barnes averaged 11.7 points and 4.9 rebounds last season for the Warriors, but disappeared at times in the postseason and particularly the Finals, where he shot just 35.2% through seven games.\n\nMatt Barnes • SF • Memphis Grizzlies (New team: Sacramento Kings)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $12 million with the Kings (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Not a bad signing for the price, but Barnes — notoriously one of the NBA's most hot-headed players — in a system with an equally hot-headed DeMarcus Cousins could be a disaster waiting to happen. He averaged 10 points and 5.5 rebounds in 76 games last season for the Grizzlies, but shot just 38.1% from the floor. At 36, this may very well be the last stop of his career.\n\nBrandon Bass • PF • Los Angeles Lakers (New team: Los Angeles Clippers)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Clippers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Bass rejoins coach Doc Rivers, who coached him during his time with the Celtics (2011-13). Last season with the Lakers, Bass, 31, averaged 7.2 points and 4.3 rebounds in 66 games off the bench. A solid big off the bench behind Blake Griffin.\n\nNicolas Batum • SF • Charlotte Hornets\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, $120 million with the Hornets (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Batum — who emerged as Charlotte's second-best player behind Kemba Walker last year — has the type of all-around skill set deserving of a max contract. Smart move by the Hornets to keep him around for the long haul. He's not quite at an All-Star level, but he's a valuable asset who utilizes his strengths on both ends of the floor.\n\nJerryd Bayless • SG • Milwaukee Bucks (New team: Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $27 million with the 76ers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Bayless won't single-handedly dig the 76ers out of the NBA's deepest depths, but he's a solid veteran combo guard who does a little bit of everything. He shot a career-best 43.7% from beyond the arc with Milwaukee last season, so, if nothing else, he should give the 76ers some much-needed depth on the perimeter.\n\nKent Bazemore • SF • Atlanta Hawks\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $70 million with the Hawks (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Bazemore came into the league as an undrafted prospect out of Old Dominion, but last season he averaged 11.6 points and 5.1 rebounds and became a hot commodity that the Hawks just couldn't let go.\n\nBradley Beal • SG • Washington Wizards\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, $128 million with the Wizards (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: When healthy, Beal — who possesses a deadly combination of athleticism and three-point shooting prowess — is one of the NBA's top shooting guards. The only problem? He can't stay healthy, which is validated by his four-year career riddled by injuries. Even so, the Wizards weren't willing to watch him walk out the door. Provided he can stay on the court, he's the second piece of one of the league's most-talented backcourts alongside John Wall.\n\nAnthony Bennett • PF • Toronto Raptors (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, veteran’s minimum with the Nets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: As one of the more disappointing players in recent history, Bennett heads to Brooklyn hoping to get his career on the right track. Odds are he won’t ever live up to his No. 1 overall pick status, but at just 23 years old, he’ll continue to try.\n\nBismack Biyombo • PF/C • Toronto Raptors (New team: Orlando Magic)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $72 million with the Magic (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Biyombo basked in the national spotlight during the Raptors' postseason run after starting center Jonas Valanciunas went down with an ankle injury, and he captured the hearts of the Toronto faithful in the process with his high-energy style of play. He doesn't have much of an offensive skill set, but his rebounding and rim protection should be a good fit in an increasingly deep Magic frontcourt alongside Serge Ibaka, Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon and Jeff Green.\n\nTarik Black • PF/C • Los Angeles Lakers\n\nContract agreement: Two-year, $12.85 million with the Lakers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Black, 24, appeared to be headed in the right direction after putting up 7.2 points and 6.3 rebounds in 21.1 minutes in the final 38 games of his rookie campaign with the Lakers in the 2014-15 season. Last year, though, he took a step back, averaging just 3.4 points and 4.0 rebounds in 12.7 minutes of play. With a new coach and a lot of new faces in the lineup, he'll look to get back on track this season.\n\nTrevor Booker • PF • Utah Jazz (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $18 million with the Nets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Booker, the 6-foot-8 28-year-old power forward, averaged 5.9 points and 5.7 rebounds in 20.7 minutes per game for the Jazz last season, and came off the bench in 77 of 79 games. He saw some time in the starting lineup during his four years with the Wizards (2010-14), but is most effective with the second unit. A solid addition for Brooklyn.\n\nAaron Brooks • PG • Chicago Bulls (New team: Indiana Pacers)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $2.5 million with the Pacers (Nate Taylor, USAT network)\n\nAnalysis: In line to take the backup point guard duties behind Jeff Teague, the veteran Brooks is a solid acquisition for an Indiana squad looking to be one of the top teams in the East next season. He averaged 7.1 points and 2.6 assists in 16.1 minutes for the Bulls last season.\n\nCaron Butler • SF • Sacramento Kings\n\nContract agreement: Exercised player option for $1.5 million to stay with Kings (reports)\n\nAnalysis: A two-time All-Star (2007, 2008) during his time with the Wizards and an NBA champion with the Mavericks (2011), Butler was more of a veteran voice in the locker room than anything else last season. In his 17 appearances, he averaged just 3.7 points, 1.3 rebounds and 10.4 minutes a game, and he won't likely see much of an increase in his role next season.\n\nIsaiah Canaan • PG • Philadelphia 76ers (New team: Chicago Bulls)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year with the Bulls (agency)\n\nAnalysis: Canaan adds three-point shooting to a Chicago backcourt in desperate need of some help on the perimieter. A solid backup point guard behind Rajon Rondo. He averaged 11.0 points and 1.8 assists in 25.5 minutes for the 76ers last season.\n\nIan Clark • SG • Golden State Warriors\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Warriors (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Clark, 25, averaged a career-high 3.6 points and 1.0 rebound in 8.8 minutes a game for the Warriors last season. Strictly a depth addition.\n\nJordan Clarkson • SG • Los Angeles Lakers\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $50 million with the Lakers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: A young, athletic combo guard with good size, Clarkson will be an important part of the rebuilding process in Laker Land. He has a bright future ahead if he continues to develop the way he did in his first two seasons.\n\nMike Conley • PG • Memphis Grizzlies\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, $153 million with the Grizzlies (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Don't let his lack of All-Star appearances fool you; Conley sits comfortably in the upper echelon of NBA floor generals. He's fully capable of changing the outlook of any other franchise lacking at the point guard position, and that's exactly why the Grizzlies went all-in to keep him around for the long haul.\n\nAllen Crabbe • SG • Portland Trail Blazers\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $75 million with the Blazers\n\nAnalysis: Since Crabbe was a restricted fee agent, the Blazers had three days to match the Nets offer of four years, $75 million, and they did.. Crabbe, 24, had a breakout season last year, averaging 10.3 points in 26 minutes off the bench for Portland. He shot 39.4% (1.4 makes) from beyond the arc.\n\nJamal Crawford • SG • Los Angeles Clippers\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $42 million with the Clippers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Crawford seemed to be all but gone after a lowball offer from the team where he spent the past four seasons, but on the third day of free agency, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year came to terms with a contract that'll pay him roughly $14 million a year. At 36 years old and with a decline in efficiency over the past few years, just how much longer can he get by with his one-dimensional skill set?\n\nSeth Curry • PG • Sacramento Kings (New team: Dallas Mavericks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $6 million with Mavericks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: The \"other Curry\" came on strong at the end of last season for the Kings, averaging 15.4 points and 5.8 assists in the final five games. A small sample size, sure, but he showed that he has the ability to put up numbers when given the opportunity. He might not be the dynamic scorer or All-NBA talent that his brother Stephen is, but he should have the chance to make a name for himself in an aging Dallas backcourt.\n\nDewayne Dedmon • C • Orlando Magic (New team: San Antonio Spurs)\n\nContract agreement: Two-year, $6 million with the Spurs (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Dedmon, 26, will be joining the fourth team of his three-year NBA career. He averaged 4.4 points and 3.9 rebounds in 12.2 minutes for the Magic last season, but standing at 7-feet, will add some rim protection and rebounding off the bench to a Spurs team that lost both Tim Ducnan and Boban Marjanovic.\n\nMatthew Dellavedova • PG • Cleveland Cavaliers (New team: Milwaukee Bucks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $38 million offer sheet from the Bucks (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Dellavedova was acquired by the Bucks along with cash considerations as part of a sign-and-trade deal for the draft rights to Albert Miralles. Dellavedova, 25, averaged 7.5 points, 4.4 assists and 2.1 rebounds in 24.6 minutes for the Cavaliers last season.\n\nLuol Deng • SF • Miami Heat (New team: Los Angeles Lakers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $72 million with Lakers (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Deng isn't the elite perimeter defender that he was during his Chicago days, and he fell apart in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Toronto Raptors, but he proved to have plenty left in the tank throughout the rest of the year. He figures to be a valuable asset for the post-Kobe Bryant Lakers next season, and, at 31, he adds a veteran mindset to a roster chock-full of young, inexperienced players.\n\nDeMar DeRozan • SG • Toronto Raptors\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, approximately $145 million with the Raptors (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Despite his occasional struggles during the Raptors postseason run, DeRozan has secured himself as one of the NBA's top scorers. He gets to the free throw line more frequently than most (8.4 attempts per game) and — at 26-years-old — has an undeniably bright future ahead. He struggles defensively at times and lacks a perimeter game, but nonetheless, the second piece of Toronto's All-Star backcourt is too talented to let go.\n\nAndre Drummond • C • Detroit Pistons\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, $130 million with the Pistons (AP)\n\nAnalysis: No surprise here, as Drummond — a restricted free agent — was fully expected to be given a maximum deal from Detroit. At just 22 years old and as one of the most prolific rebounders in recent history, the future of the franchise starts with him.\n\nJared Dudley • SF • Washington Wizards (New team: Phoenix Suns)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $30 million with Suns (Paul Coro, USAT Network)\n\nAnalysis: This will be Dudley's second stint in Phoenix. The last time he was there, he was a key part of the 2010 Western Conference championship team. Dudley, heading to phoenix for his second stint with the team, will bring depth at the stretch-4 position, in addition to the recently-drafted Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss. Dudley shot 42% from three-point range for the Wizards last season, and even played some center when Washington went small.\n\nTim Duncan • PF/C • San Antonio Spurs\n\nStatus: Retired from NBA\n\nAnalysis: After 19 seasons and five championships, the 40-year-old Duncan won't be back in the silver and black next season. A loss for San Antonio from a leadership standpoint, but Father Time finally caught up with him.\n\nKevin Durant • SF • Oklahoma City Thunder (New team: Golden State Warriors)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $54 million with the Warriors (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: The NBA's most sought-after free agent in recent history is headed to Golden State to join back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The biggest move of free agency, by far, and the formation of what figures to be one of the deadliest starting lineups in NBA history. The only question ... who takes the last shot?\n\nWayne Ellington • SG • Brooklyn Nets (New team: Miami Heat)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $12 million with the Heat (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Ellington, 28, averaged 7.7 points and 2.3 rebounds in 21.3 minutes for the Nets last season, but his three-point shooting (career 37.8%) is likely what lured the Heat — who lost two of their top three-point shooters in Luol Deng and Joe Johnson — to sign him. This will be the seventh team of his career.\n\nJames Ennis • SF • New Orleans Pelicans (New team: Memphis Grizzlies)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $6 million with the Grizzlies (Ronald Tillery, USAT Network)\n\nAnalysis: Ennis played 10 games for the Grizzlies last season, in addition to three with the Heat and nine with the Pelicans. During those nine games in New Orleans, he averaged career-highs of 15.9 points, 3.9 rebounds and shot 50%. A small sample size, for sure, but he'll look to build on that during his second stint in Memphis, provided he's given the opportunity to do so.\n\nFestus Ezeli • C • Golden State Warriors (New team: Portland Trail Blazers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $15 million with the Trail Blazers (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Ezeli obviously wasn't an offseason priority for the Warriors, but, at 6-foot-11, 265 pounds, should be a perfect fit with the Trail Blazers, who desperately need size in their front court. Ezeli averaged 7.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game last season, but he was hardly utilized in the NBA Finals when the Warriors squared off against the Cavs.\n\nRaymond Felton • PG • Dallas Mavericks (New team: Los Angeles Clippers)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Clippers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: A solid veteran backup, Felton, 32, averaged 9.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 80 games tor the Mavericks last season. For the price, likely to be the third point guard behind Chris Paul and Austin Rivers, a good move for L.A.\n\nEvan Fournier • SG • Orlando Magic\n\n*Contract agreement: Five-year, $85 million with the Magic (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Now that Victor Oladipo is in Oklahoma City, Fournier will handle much more of the scoring load in Orlando's backcourt. He improved substantially over the past two seasons, and at just 23 years old, this should be a good long-term investment.\n\nRandy Foye • SG • Oklahoma City Thunder (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Terms not released\n\nAnalysis: Foye, 32, split last season with the Nuggets and the Thunder, averaging 5.8 points and 2.0 assists. He adds depth and a veteran mindset to a lowly Brooklyn squad that has been incredibly active in free agency.\n\nTim Frazier • PG • New Orleans Pelicans\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $4.1 million with the Pelicans (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Frazier became a savior of sorts for New Orleans at the end of last season when he first signed a 10-day contract in March after the team had an unusual number of injuries. He averaged 13.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.5 assists in the final 16 games of the season.\n\nLangston Galloway • PG • New York Knicks (New team: New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year with the Pelicans (reports)\n\nAnalysis: An athletic combo guard who plays solid defense, Galloway is a good young addition to the Pelicans rotation. He averaged 7.6 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 24.8 minutes for the Knicks last year after posting 11.8-point, 4.2-rebound, 3.3-assist numbers in 32.4 minutes in his rookie season.\n\nPau Gasol • PF/C • Chicago Bulls (New team: San Antonio Spurs)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $30 million with the Spurs (reports)\n\nAnalysis: The spurs weren't able to lure Kevin Durant to San Antonio, but as a consolation prize, they were able to grab a savvy 35-year-old veteran in Gasol, who should fit well into coach Gregg Popovich's system. Gasol, who won back-to-back titles with the Lakers, will provide quality depth for a dangerous San Antonio frontcourt as they try to stay even with the now deeper Warriors in the West.\n\nAlonzo Gee • SF • New Orleans Pelicans\n\nContract agreement: One-year, $1.4 million with the Pelicans (AP)\n\nAnalysis: An NBA journeyman, Gee will stay put for another year in New Orleans after posting 4.5-point, 3.4-rebound numbers in 22.4 minutes per game last season.\n\nManu Ginobili • SG • San Antonio Spurs\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $14 million with the Spurs (reports)\n\nAnalysis: He's 38 years old and might not have a lot left in the tank, but has been a key contributor for the Spurs in the past decade. He averaged 9.6 points and 3.1 assists in 58 games off the bench last year, the lowest numbers since his rookie season.\n\nEric Gordon • SG • New Orleans Pelicans (New team: Houston Rockets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $53 million with the Rockets (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Gordon has the talent of a starter, but after an injury-riddled eight-year career, maybe a spot as James Harden's backup will be a nice change of pace. Just like Ryan Anderson, his Pelicans teammate who is also headed to the Rockets, Gordon, 27 fits the bill in Houston: A three-point shooter who struggles defensively.\n\nGerald Green • SG • Miami Heat (New team: Boston Celtics)\n\nContract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Celtics (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Green returns to the Celtics — the team that drafted him and where he spent his first two seasons — as an athletic wing capable of knocking down shots from the perimeter (career 36.1%). He averaged 8.9 points and 2.4 rebounds in 22.6 minutes for the Heat last season. For the price, this move makes a lot of sense.\n\nJeff Green • SF • Los Ageles Clippers (New team: Orlando Magic)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $15 million with the Magic (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Green — the fifth overall pick in 2007 out of Georgetown — has been a case of \"what could have been\" for most of his career, but he should have plenty of chances to impress in Orlando, especially with Victor Oladipo out of the mix.\n\nJustin Hamilton • C • Minnesota Timberwolves (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $6 million with Nets (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Hamilton last played in the NBA in the 2014-2015, where he played 17 games with the Timberwolves and averaged 9.0 points and 5.1 rebounds.\n\nJames Harden • SG • Houston Rockets\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $118 million with the Rockets (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Harden was two years away from hitting the free agency market, so to avoid the potential loss of their franchise player, the Rockets renegotiated the terms of his contract. Although the Rockets' season ending in disappointing fashion, Harden (29.0 points, 7.5 assists, 6.1 rebounds) is their most important player, by far, and will continue to be so moving forward.\n\nMaurice Harkless • SF • Portland Trail Blazers\n\nContract agreement: Four-year, $40 million with the Blazers (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Harkless heated up near the end of the season and into the playoffs, where he averaged 11 points and 5.1 rebounds in 11 games as a starter. A young talent with a lot of potential, he fits the bill in Portland.\n\nJoe Harris • SG • Orlando Magic (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Multi-year with the Nets\n\nAnalysis: Harris averaged 2.5 points in 9.1 minutes in 56 games for the Cavaliers during his first two NBA seasons. Last season, he saw time in and out of the D-League before being traded to the Magic, who subsequently waived him.\n\nUdonis Haslem • PF/C • Miami Heat\n\n*Contract agreement: One year, $4 million with Heat (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Haslem, who has spent his entire 13-year career in Miami, averaged a career-low 1.6 points and 2.0 rebounds in just 7.0 minutes last season. With Dwyane Wade gone, he's one of the few veteran voices left in Miami's locker room.\n\nGerald Henderson • SG • Portland Trail Blazers (New team: Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $18 million with 76ers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Henderson, 28, had a down year with the Blazers last season, averaging just 8.7 points and 2.9 rebounds in 19.9 minutes in a backcourt headlined by Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The year before with Charlotte, though, he averaged 12.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 28.9 minutes and started in 72 of the team's contests. He figures to see plenty of playing time for the Sixers, who need all the help they can get in the backcourt.\n\nRoy Hibbert • C • Los Angeles Lakers (New team: Charlotte Hornets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $8 million with the Timberwolves (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Hibbert was one of the top true centers left on the market when he reached the agreement, so, for the price, not a bad pick up by a Charlotte team in need of a defensive anchor after losing Al Jefferson. But at just 29 years old, his decline in production with the Lakers last season (5.9 points, 4.9 rebounds) is a little concerning.\n\nJordan Hill • PF/C • Indiana Pacers (New team: Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $18 million with Timberwolves (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Hill gives Minnesota depth at the center position, playing with a backup unit alongside Gorgui Dieng and Cole Aldrich. He averaged 8.8 points and 6.2 rebounds in 73 games for the Pacers last season.\n\nSolomon Hill • SG • Indiana Pacers (New team: New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $50 million, plus incentives, with the Pelicans (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Hill was the primary small forward for the Pacers in 2014-15 when Paul George missed the majority of the year after breaking his leg, but his playing time took a dive last season as a result of George's return. He saw more time on the floor in the playoffs and performed well (57.9% from three), though, and at just 25 years old, the Pelicans are hoping he's still improving and can provide some rebounding and scoring depth.\n\nAl Horford • C • Atlanta Hawks (New team: Boston Celtics)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $113 million with the Celtics (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: This is a huge signing for the Celtics, a team that has a lot of young talent but needed a star to build around. Horford is that guy. A four-time All-Star with the Hawks, he's as versatile as they come. He's light on his feet, can pass and shoot better than most — if not all — 6-10, 250 pound bigs, and is sound defensively. He can score from the inside, is a good rim protector and, above all, an excellent team player. Put simply: He's the type of big man coaches dream about. He should fit flawlessly with what the Celtics are trying to do under coach Brad Stevens.\n\nDwight Howard • C • Houston Rockets (New team: Atlanta Hawks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $70.5 million with Hawks (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Third time's a charm, right? Howard hasn't been the same since his fallout with the Magic in 2012, and — after a dysfunctional season in L.A. and a disappointing three-year stretch in Houston — he desperately needed a change of scenery for a chance to rejuvenate his career. He has plenty of years left, and with Al Horford out the door in Atlanta, Howard should get plenty of touches.\n\nMarcelo Huertas • PG • Los Angeles Lakers\n\nContract agreement: Two-year with the Lakers (announced on Instagram)\n\nAnalysis: Huertas, an old 'young' NBA player, played 14 years in South America and Europe before playing 53 games with the Lakers last season as a rookie, where he averaged 4.5 points and 3.4 assists in 16.4 minutes. He has a solid, pass-first skill set, but will likely be the third option at the Lakers' point guard spot.\n\nKris Humphries • PF • Atlanta Hawks\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $4 million with the Hawks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: A solid addition as a backup to Paul Millsap, expect Humphries to continue to do what he does best: embrace his veteran, role-player status.\n\nJarrett Jack • PG • Brooklyn Nets (New team: Atlanta Hawks)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Hawks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: As a backup for Dennis Schroder, who will take on the starting point guard duties after the team traded away Jeff Teague, Jack is a solid signing for Atlanta. He played some of the best basketball of his 11-year career during the past two seasons with Brooklyn, where he averaged 12.4 points and 6.1 assists.\n\nAl Jefferson • C • Charlotte Hornets (New team: Indiana Pacers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $30 million with the Pacers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: In a space-and-pace league where big men (by definition) are becoming less valuable, Jefferson's signing with the Pacers — a team looking to follow that same fast-paced trend — doesn't make a lot of sense. But for the price, a few hours after Timofey Mozgov agreed on a four-year, $64 million deal with the Lakers, this could be a steal for Indy. He's 31 and has dealt with his fair share of injuries in recent years, but at the end of the day, Big Al is still one of the NBA's best low-post bigs.\n\nRichard Jefferson • SF • Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nContract agreement: Two-year deal with the Cavaliers (announced on Snapchat)\n\nAnalysis: After retiring and then un-retiring a few days later, Jefferson, 36, has decided to stick around for the Cavaliers' title defense. He averaged 5.7 points and 5.3 rebounds in 24 minutes during the NBA Finals, but with age clearly catching up to him, he figures to be more of a locker room personality than anything else.\n\nBrandon Jennings • PG • Orlando Magic (New team: New York Knicks)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $5 million with the Knicks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: It was just one year ago that Jennings averaged 15.4 points and 6.6 rebounds as the starting point guard for the Pistons, but that season ended prematurely as a result of a ruptured left Achilles, and he hasn't been the same since, with less-than impressive results last season with Detroit and Orlando. Still just 26 years old, he has plenty of time to rejuvenate his career, and Madison Square Garden may very well be where he does just that.\n\nJames Johnson • PF • Toronto Raptors (New team: Miami Heat)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $4 million with the Heat (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Johnson, 29, averaged 5.0 points and 2.2 rebounds in 16.2 minutes for the Raptors last season. The Heat have some big holes to fill after losing two of their starters to go along with the uncertainty of Chris Bosh's health, but Johnson doesn't figure to be anything more than a rotation guy.\n\nJoe Johnson • SG • Miami Heat (New team: Utah Jazz)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $22 million with the Jazz (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Johnson, 35, gives the up-and-coming Jazz a proven scorer and level-headed veteran as they try to climb the ladder in the rugged Western Conference.\n\nTyler Johnson • SG • Miami Heat\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $50 million with the Heat (reports)\n\nAnalysis: The Nets gave Johnson a four-year, $50 million offer sheet, but after losing three starters to free agency, Miami had no other option than to match. Johnson, an undrafted 24-year-old combo guard out of Fresno State, spent the past two seasons with Miami. An elite athlete with some upside, he averaged 8.7 points per game last season on 48.6% shooting.\n\nWesley Johnson • SF • Los Angeles Clippers\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $18 million with the Clippers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Johnson, the fourth overall pick in 2010, has never lived up to his draft-day hype after failed campaigns with the Timberwolves, Suns and Lakers. But for a relatively cheap price in today's market, he should continue to be a solid, three-and-D role player off the bench for the Clippers.\n\nTerrence Jones • PF • Houston Rockets (New team: New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Pelicans (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Jones, 24, battled injuries and failed to fully meet expectations during his four seasons in Houston. He showed plenty of upside, though, particularly during the 2014-15 season, where he averaged 13.5 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 24 starts. In a backup role for the Pelicans, this could be a move that helps kick his career into gear.\n\nCourtney Lee • SG • Charlotte Hornets (New team: New York Knicks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, nearly $50 million with the Knicks (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Just hours after Knicks free agent Arron Afflalo left the Big Apple for Sacramento, Lee's agreement was announced. Lee — also a veteran 30-year-old shooting guard — spent the first half of last season with the Grizzlies before being traded to the Hornets, where he continued to do what he does best: shoot the three and play D. Likely to take over the starting duties for New York, he'll join a potential lineup of Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, Kristaps Porzingis and Joakim Noah.\n\nMeyers Leonard • PF/C • Portland Trail Blazers\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $41 million contract with Blazers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Leonard, 24, was able to give the Blazers some solid production (8.4 points and 5.1 rebounds) last season, but his year was shortened by injuries, as he suffered a dislocated shoulder early in the season and then had surgery to repair a torn labrum late. His playing time might take a dip with the signing of Festus Ezeli, but — at 7-foot-1 with range (37.7% from three last season) — he should still be able to give Portland some solid minutes.\n\nJon Leuer • PF • Phoenix Suns (New team: Detroit Pistons)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $42 million with the Pistons (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: After putting together the best season of his career last year with the Suns (8.5 points, 5.6 rebounds), Leuer — a 6-foot-10 stretch-4 with range — heads to Detroit to join a frontcourt of Andre Drummond, Tobias Harris, Marcus Morris, Stanley Johnson and rookie Henry Ellenson.\n\nJeremy Lin • PG • Charlotte Hornets (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $36 million with the Nets (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Now on his sixth team in as many years, Lin may have his best chance yet to put Lisanity 2.0 in motion on a Brooklyn squad in dire need of some backcourt assistance.\n\nIan Mahinmi • C • Indiana Pacers (New team: Washington Wizards)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $64 million with the Wizards (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: After missing out on Al Horford, who was leaning towards either the Wizards or Celtics and chose the latter, Washington's consolation prize was Mahinmi, an athletically-gifted big who played the best basketball of his career as a starter for the Pacers last season (9.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 1.1 blocks). He's not Horford by any means, but should be a good fit alongside Marcin Gortat and Markieff Morris in the frontcourt.\n\nBoban Marjanovic • C • San Antonio Spurs (New team: Detroit Pistons)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $21 million contract with Pistons (Vince Ellis, USAT network)\n\nAnalysis: Behind All-Star Andre Drummond, Marjanovic — the 7-foot-3 Serbian center — will provide the Pistons with some leverage as a backup. As a rookie last season for the Spurs, he averaged 5.5 points and 3.6 rebounds in just 9.4 minutes.\n\nO.J. Mayo • SG • Milwaukee Bucks (Banned from NBA)\n\nStatus: Disqualified from the league for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program (Zillgitt, AJ Neuharth-Keusch)\n\nAnalysis: Mayo has been dismissed and disqualified from the NBA and must wait two years for the possibility of reinstatement. The list of \"drugs of abuse\" as prohibited substances in the NBA collective bargaining agreement are: amphetamines and its analogs, cocaine, LSD, opiates (heroin, codeine and morphine), and PCP. The league didn't specify which drug Mayo was caught using.\n\nJames Michael McAdoo • SF • Golden State Warriors\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Warriors (reports)\n\nAnalysis: McAdoo, 23, averaged 2.9 points and 1.4 rebounds in 6.4 minutes last season, and you can expect more of the same next year. That's not a knock against his talent, there's just so much ahead of him on the depth chart.\n\nRay McCallum • PG • Memphis Grizzlies (New team: Detroit Pistons)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Pistons (Vince Ellis, USAT network)\n\nAnalysis: McCallum, 25, will likely battle Lorenzo Brown for the third point guard spot behind Ish Smith and Reggie Jackson. He averaged 3.3 points and 1.5 assists in 11.6 minutes last season with the Spurs and Grizzlies.\n\nC.J. McCollum • SG • Portland Trail Blazers\n\nContract agreement: Four-year, $106 million with Blazers (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: McCollum wasn't a free agent this summer, but after his stellar season, the Blazers rewarded him handsomely. McCollum, the 2015-16 recipient of the NBA's Most Improved Player Award, averaged career-highs of 20.8 points, 4.3 assists and 3.2 rebounds in 34.8 minutes last year, his third NBA season, as the Blazers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals just a year after losing four of five starters.\n\nJordan McRae • SG • Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n*Contract agreement: Cavaliers exercise option, 1-year, $874,636 (reports)\n\nAnalysis: McRae, 25, has a chance to continue to develop with the Cavaliers now that he will likely see a full season with the team. He averaged 4.1 points in just 7.5 minutes (15 games) last season, but turned heads in the Cavs' final regular season game with 36 points, seven assists and four rebounds in 47 minutes.\n\nMike Miller • SF • Denver Nugget s\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year with the Nuggets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Miller, 36, is nothing more than a veteran voice in the locker room at this stage in his career. He averaged career-lows of 1.3 points and 7.9 minutes in just 47 games last season.\n\nE'Twaun Moore • SG • Chicago Bulls (New team: New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $34 million with the Pelicans (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: With Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson both gone to Houston, Moore gives the Pelicans some much-needed depth on the perimeter. Last season with Chicago, he shot a career-high 45.2% from three-point range and scored 7.5 points a game.\n\nTimofey Mozgov • C • Cleveland Cavaliers (New team: Los Angeles Lakers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $64 million with the Lakers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: The 7-1 center took a significant step back with the Cleveland Cavaliers last season. Could a new environment and an uptick in playing time be the change that he needs to rejuvenate his career?\n\nNene • PF/C • Washington Wizards (New team: Houston Rockets)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $2.9 million with the Rockets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Hindered by Father Time and the injury bug, Nene, 33, took a big step back for the Wizards in the past two seasons. In 57 games last year, he averaged 9.2 points and 4.5 rebounds in just 19.2 minutes of play as the Wizards attempted to transition to a more up-tempo playing style. Now, with head coach Mike D'Antoni in Houston, well-known for his \"Seven Seconds of Less\" team in Phoenix, don't expect Nene to take on anything more than a limited role.\n\nAndrew Nicholson • PF • Orlando Magic (New team: Washington Wizards)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year with the Wizards (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Nicholson, a 6-foot-9, 250 pound power forward from St. Bonaventure, spent his first four seasons with the Magic, where he averaged 6.5 points and 3.2 rebounds in 15.1 minutes. He doesn't have much of an offensive game and has regressed after a strong rookie season, so it'll be interesting to see how he fits in with a Wizards team looking to recover from a disappointing season.\n\nJoakim Noah • C • Chicago Bulls (New team: New York Knicks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $72 million with the Knicks (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Noah, who played just 29 games last season because of a shoulder injury that required surgery in January, will give new Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek another playmaker and top tier defender. If Noah can recover from a season that was easily the worst of his nine-year career, he could be a quality fit with the likes of newly-acquired Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nDirk Nowitzki • PF • Dallas Mavericks\n\nContract agreement: Two-year, $50 million with the Mavericks (AP)\n\nAnalysis: That perennial All-Star capable of carrying the Mavs into the postseason on the coat-tails of his silky smooth fadaway jumper is long gone. But despite being one of four players still standing from the 1998 draft class, Nowitzki was still able to lead the Mavericks — who made the postseason for the 15th time in his era — in scoring last season (18.3 points).\n\nZaza Pachulia • C • Dallas Mavericks (New team: Golden State Warriors)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $2.88 million with the Warriors (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: As a domino effect of the Kevin Durant signing, the Warriors lost both Harrison Barnes (free agent) and Andrew Bogut (trade) to the Mavericks. Pachulia, the 6-foot-11 vet who happened to just leave Dallas, fills the void left by Bogut. He averaged 8.6 points and 9.4 rebounds last season.\n\nChandler Parsons • SF • Dallas Mavericks (New team: Memphis Grizzlies)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $94 million with the Grizzlies (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: When healthy, Parsons has proven to be one of the league's most versatile small forwards. Key words: when healthy. Each of his past two seasons ended prematurely because of right knee problems, but Memphis went all-in anyway, as Parsons is just 27 years old and has yet to reach his full potential. If his knee issues stay a thing of the past, he'll be a valuable asset for the Grizzlies.\n\nMiles Plumlee • C • Milwaukee Bucks\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $52 million with Bucks (AP)\n\nAnalysis: Plumlee, 27, averaged 5.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in 14.3 minutes for the Bucks last season. Athletic and tall, he fits the bill in Milwaukee, but doesn't give much of an offensive impact.\n\nDwight Powell • PF • Dallas Mavericks\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $37 million-plus with the Mavericks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Powell has proven to be more than just a throw-in from the 2014 Rajon Rondo deal gone awry. Last season, he averaged 5.8 points and 4.0 rebounds in 14.4 minutes, certainly not gaudy numbers, but at 6-foot-11, 240 pounds with a versatile skill set, the Mavericks have him penciled in as a part of their future plans and weren't willing to simply let him walk and explore the market.\n\nPablo Prigioni • PG • Los Angeles Clippers (New team: Houston Rockets)\n\nContract agreement: Two-year with the Rockets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Prigioni was signed to be a strong influence in the Rockets' locker room as a veteran who can and will play multiple roles. At 39, don't expect him to see much time on the floor.\n\nWillie Reed • PF • Brooklyn Nets (New team: Miami Heat)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year with the Heat (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Reed has spent most of his career in the D-League, averaging 15.3 points and shooting 58% from the floor. He played in 39 games with the Nets last season and averaged 4.7 points in 10.9 minutes on 57% shooting. The Heat are hoping he can provide solid frontcourt depth and — with their proven ability to groom young players — this could turn out to be a good fit.\n\nLuc Richard Mbah a Moute • SF • Los Angeles Clippers\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $4.5 million with the Clippers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Despite starting in 61 games for the Clippers last season, Mbah a Moute averaged just 3.1 points and 2.3 rebounds in 17.0 minutes a night. Still, re-signed for next to nothing, a good addition for depth purposes.\n\nAustin Rivers • PG • Los Angeles Clippers\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $35 million plus with Clippers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Word around the league is that the only reason he's on the team is because his father, Doc, is coaching. But Austin turned himself into a contributor with the Clippers last season, scoring 8.9 points on 44% shooting. He provides some backcourt depth, and at just 23 years old, has plenty of time to continue to develop.\n\nBrian Roberts • PG • Portland Trail Blazers (New team: Charlotte Hornets)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Hornets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Roberts, returning to Charlotte for his third stint with the Hornets, is nothing more than a depth addition behind Kemba Walker and Ramon Sessions. In 30 games with Charlotte last season, he averaged 4.8 points and 1.3 assists in 11.1 minutes.\n\nRajon Rondo • PG • Sacramento Kings (New team: Chicago Bulls)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $30 million with the Bulls (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: The Bulls rolled the dice on Rondo — a below-average shooter with a well-documented attitude problem — as a replacement for the recently-traded Derrick Rose in one of the more head-scratching free agency moves of the summer. That said, the 30-year-old vet is still one of the NBA's best passers, as was shown by his league-leading 11.7 assists per game last season, and there have to be some fragments of that perennial All-Star from Boston in there somewhere. Could we be in for a Rondo resurgence, or will it be yet another disaster?\n\nBrandon Rush • SG • Golden State Warriors (New team: Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $3.5 million with the Timberwolves (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Rush, 30, averaged 4.2 points and 2.5 rebounds in 14.7 minutes in a limited role for the Warriors last season. He's not much of a game-changer, especially since tearing his ACL two games into the 2012-13 season, but the Timberwolves needed a three-point shooter, and Rush can fill that void.\n\nTomas Satoransky • SG • FC Barcelona (New team: Washington Wizards)\n\nContract agreement: Three-year, $9 million with the Wizards (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Satoransky, the No. 32 pick in the 2012 draft, is finally transitioning to the NBA after playing the last seven years in Spain. An athletic shooting guard, standing at 6-foot-7 with good length and athleticism, Satoransky shot 39.0% (2.3 makes per game) from three in 62 games in European competition last year.\n\nLuis Scola • PF • Toronto Raptors (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Nets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Scola played in 76 games with the Raptors last season, averaging 8.7 points and 4.7 rebounds in 21.5 minutes, but he was nonexistent in the postseason, averaging just 2.5 points and 1.6 rebounds in 12.7 minutes. At 36, he brings plenty of experience to Brooklyn and should provide the Nets with solid minutes in a backup role.\n\nRamon Sessions • PG • Washington Wizards (New team: Charlotte Hornets)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $12.5 million with the Hornets (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Sessions was a solid backup to John Wall in Washington last season, giving them some much-needed, quality depth at guard. This is Sessions' second stint with the Hornets, who lost backup point guard Jeremy Lin to free agency. Sessions last played for Charlotte in 2012-13 (14.4 points, 3.8 assists) and part of the 2013-14 season.\n\nIsh Smith • PG • Philadelphia 76ers (New team: Detroit Pistons)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $18 million with Pistons (Vince Ellis, USAT Network)\n\nAnalysis: Not the sexiest move of the opening day of free agency by any means, but Smith — who averaged 12.6 points, 6.5 assists and 4.0 rebounds last season — is a solid addition as Reggie Jackson's backup in Detroit.\n\nJason Smith • PF/C • Orlando Magic (New team: Washington Wizards)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $16 million with the Wizards (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: A veteran, 7-foot, jump-shooting big, Smith adds frontcourt depth for the Wizards, but not much else. He averaged 7.2 points and 2.9 rebounds off the bench for the Magic last season.\n\nMarreese Speights • PF/C • Golden State Warriors (New team: Los Angeles Clippers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Multi-year contract with the Clippers (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Speights, standing at 6-foot-10, 255 pounds, averaged 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds for the Warriors off the bench last season.\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire • PF/C • Miami Heat\n\nStatus: Retired from NBA\n\nAnalysis: Stoudemire signed a ceremonial contract with the Knicks, where he spent five years of his career, before retiring. Once looked at as one of the most athletically-gifted forwards in the league, Stoudemire's NBA journey was derailed by chronic knee problems that date back to the beginning of his fourth season. His production saw a rapid decline over the past few years, particularly last season with Miami, where he averaged just 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds in 14.7 minutes. It was the first time he scored less than 10 points per game in a season.\n\nJared Sullinger • PF • Boston Celtics (New team: Toronto Raptors)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Raptors (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Sullinger, 24, averaged 10.3 points and 8.3 rebounds in 23.6 minutes for Boston last season. He provides the Raptors with solid inside depth and could be a key contributor for the team, provided he stays healthy and can get back into shape.\n\nMirza Teletovic • PF • Phoenix Suns (New team: Milwaukee Bucks)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $30 million with the Bucks (Charles Gardner, USAT Network)\n\nAnalysis: Coming off the best season of his career, Teletovic — a 6-foot-9 stretch-4 who shot 39.3% from beyond the arc — will help spread the floor for Milwaukee.\n\nGarrett Temple • SG • Washington Wizards (New team: Sacramento Kings)\n\n*Contract agreement: Three-year, $24 million with the Kings (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Temple saw the most playing time of his six-year career with the Wizards last season filling in for the oft-injured Bradley Beal, averaging 7.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 24.4 minutes. He's not much of a scoring threat, but a solid defender with long arms who can knock down the corner three. This will be his second stint with the Kings (five games in the 2009-10 season).\n\nLance Thomas • SF • New York Knicks\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year with the Knicks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Thomas, who averaged 8.2 points in 22.3 minutes for the Knicks last season, isn't a star player or a game-changer on the offensive end, but he's a high-energy guy and a hard-nosed defender. He posted a career-high 40.4% from beyond the arc last season, too, so he figures to be a solid part of the rotation for the Knicks next season.\n\nAnthony Tolliver • PF • Detroit Pistons (New team: Sacramento Kings)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $16 million with the Kings (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Tolliver, 31, averaged 5.3 points and 3.2 rebounds last season for the Pistons, and proved that his strength still lies on the perimeter, where he made 36% of his threes (1.4 makes per game). As a veteran stretch-4, he'll help space the floor for Sacramento and give them some much-needed depth. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nEvan Turner • SF • Boston Celtics (New team: Portland Trail Blazers)\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $70 million with the Trail Blazers (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: A second overall pick in the 2010 draft, Turner has never quite lived up to the hype that surrounded him coming into the NBA out of Ohio State. But if he's able to mesh well with Portland's high-powered backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, this could be his time to fully utilize his role and put his versatility to good use.\n\nAnderson Varejao • C • Golden State Warriors\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year with the Warriors (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Varejao is far from the player he once was during his glory days with the Cavs. He averaged just 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds in 22 games for the Warriors last season, and disappeared even more in the playoffs, averaging just 1.2 points and 1.2 rebounds in 5.5 minutes.\n\nGreivis Vasquez • PG • Milwaukee Bucks (New team: Brooklyn Nets)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $5 million with the Nets (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Vasquez, 29, was sidelined for all but 23 games with Milwaukee last season, large in part due to a December foot surgery. The journeyman point guard has played for five teams in his six seasons, and now moves on to a sixth. He's a good assist man and decent scorer when healthy, and brings career averages of 9.0 points and 4.8 assists to Brooklyn.\n\nSasha Vujacic • SG • New York Knicks\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, veteran's minimum with the Knicks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Vujacic doesn't give the Knicks much offensive production (4.9 points, 2.4 rebounds last season), but for the price, he's a good locker room guy who can help off the bench.\n\nDwyane Wade • SG • Miami Heat (New team: Chicago Bulls)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $47.5 million with the Bulls (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Thirteen seasons and three championships later, Dwyane Wade — the most successful player in Miami Heat history — is headed to Chicago. It's crazy that it got to this point, but after low-ball offers from the organization that he has given so much to over the years, the 12-time All-Star is starting the next chapter of his career. He's 34 and has been hindered by a handful of knee injuries over the years, but as he proved last season (74 games played, 30.5 minutes, 19.0 points, 4.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds), he still has plenty left in the tank. He joins a Chicago backcourt of Rajon Rondo and Jimmy Butler.\n\nDion Waiters • SG • Oklahoma City Thunder (New team: Miami Heat)\n\n*Contract agreement: Two-year, $5.93 million with the Heat (AP)\n\nAnalysis: An intriguing signing for sure, but replacing Hall of Fame guard Dwyane Wade with Waiters isn't exactly an upgrade. That said, Waiters, 24, is a proven scorer, and will have plenty of opportunity to do just that in Miami. He has career averages of 12.8 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists\n\nDavid West • PF • San Antonio Spurs (New team: Golden State Warriors)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $1.55 million with the Warriors (Amick)\n\nAnalysis: Just a day after acquiring Kevin Durant in the biggest free agency move in recent history, the Warriors were able to grab 35-year-old power forward David West for the veteran's minimum, next to nothing in today's booming market. West only averaged 7.1 points and 4.0 rebounds in 18.0 minutes in a reserve role for the Spurs last season, but put up 11.7-point, 6.8-rebound numbers the year before with Indiana. For a player of West's caliber at such a low price, this is a great value signing for Golden State.\n\nHassan Whiteside • C • Miami Heat\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $98 million with the Heat (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Few players in the league have a ceiling as high as Whiteside, the 7-foot stat-stuffing center who — in just two seasons with Miami — evolved from a no-name player hopping around the D-League and various overseas organizations to the NBA's most menacing shot-blocker and interior presence. Question marks surround his passing (or lack thereof) and his inability to translate blocks into effective team defense, but make no mistake, he's a game-changer, and is now a franchise cornerstone for Miami.\n\nDeron Williams • PG • Dallas Mavericks\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $10 million with the Mavericks (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Williams has fallen victim to Father Time in recent years, but still remains a more-than serviceable starting point guard for the Mavericks. He averaged 14.1 points and 5.8 assists in 32.4 minutes before being hindered by a sports hernia in the postseason, where he played in just three of the Mavs' five first-round games against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He figures to resume his starting role next season for a Dallas squad with little more to offer at the point guard position.\n\nDerrick Williams • PF • New York Knicks (New team: Miami Heat)\n\n*Contract agreement: One-year, $5 million with the Heat (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Williams, 25, averaged 9.3 points and 3.7 rebounds in 17.9 minutes for the Knicks last season. The former No. 2 overall pick should see plenty of playing time with Dwyane Wade, Joe Johnson and Luol Deng gone and Chris Bosh's status still up in the air.\n\nMarvin Williams • PF • Charlotte Hornets\n\n*Contract agreement: Four-year, $54.5 million with the Hornets (Zillgitt)\n\nAnalysis: Williams, 30, had a career resurgence last season with the Hornets, averaging 11.7 points (highest since 2009) and 6.4 rebounds (career-high) while shooting a career-best 40.2% from beyond the arc (1.9 makes a game). After losing center Al Jefferson to the Pacers on the first day of free agency, the Hornets are fortunate to be keeping their starting power forward around for the long haul.\n\nMo Williams • PG • Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n*Contract agreement: Exercised player option for $2.2 million to stay with Cavaliers (Cleveland Plain Dealer)\n\nAnalysis: While the Cavaliers were knee deep in the NBA Finals, Williams quietly picked up his option to stay with the team. The 33-year-old missed significant time with a knee injury last season, which probably would have reduced his value on the market had he decided to opt out. But he and LeBron James have a good relationship and, when he's healthy, he's shown that he's capable of putting up big numbers, as was shown with his 52-point game in the 2014-15 season with the Timberwolves.\n\nTyler Zeller • C • Boston Celtics\n\nContract agreement: Two-year, $16 million with the Celtics (reports)\n\nAnalysis: Zeller, 26, averaged 6.1 points and 3.0 rebounds in just 11.8 minutes per game last season, but his versatility and ability to knock down the midrange jumper make him a valuable asset off the bench behind Al Horford.\n\nRemaining free agents\n\nLou Amundson • PF • New York Knicks\n\nAlan Anderson • SG • Washington Wizards\n\nJames Anderson • SF • Sacramento Kings\n\nJeff Ayres • PF/C • Los Angeles Clippers\n\nSteve Blake • PG • Detroit Pistons\n\nMatt Bonner • PF/C • San Antonio Spurs\n\nElton Brand • PF • Philadelphia 76ers\n\nMarkel Brown • SG • Brooklyn Nets\n\nChase Budinger • SF • Phoenix Suns\n\nRasual Butler • SF • San Antonio Spurs\n\nMario Chalmers • PG • Memphis Grizzlies\n\nNorris Cole • PG • New Orleans Pelicans\n\nChris Copeland • SF • Milwaukee Bucks\n\nJared Cunningham • SG • Milwaukee Bucks\n\nTroy Daniels • SG • Charlotte Hornets\n\nCleanthony Early • SF • New York Knicks\n\nJordan Farmar • PG • Memphis Grizzlies\n\nJorge Gutierrez • PG • Charlotte Hornets\n\nPJ Hairston • SF • Memphis Grizzlies\n\nTyler Hansbrough • PF/C • Charlotte Hornets\n\nChuck Hayes • PF • Houston Rockets\n\nJJ Hickson • PF/C • Washington Wizards\n\nKirk Hinrich • PG • Atlanta Hawks\n\nLeBron James • SF • Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nCory Jefferson • PF • Phoenix Suns\n\nJames Jones • SF • Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nChris Kaman • C • Portland Trail Blazers\n\nSergey Karasev • SG • Brooklyn Nets\n\nRyan Kelly • PF • Los Angeles Lakers\n\nShane Larkin • PG • Brooklyn Nets\n\nTy Lawson • PG • Indiana Pacers\n\nDavid Lee • PF/C • Dallas Mavericks\n\nKevin Martin • SG • San Antonio Spurs\n\nAndre Miller • PG • San Antonio Spurs\n\nNazr Mohammed • C • Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nEric Moreland • PF/C Sacramento Kings\n\nDonatas Motiejunas • PF/C • Houston Rockets\n\nXavier Munford • PG • Memphis Grizzlies\n\nGary Neal • SG • Washington Wizards\n\nSteve Novak • PF • Milwaukee Bucks\n\nKendrick Perkins • C • New Orleans Pelicans\n\nRonnie Price • PG • Phoenix Suns\n\nTayshaun Prince • SF • Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nThomas Robinson • PF • Brooklyn Nets\n\nDamjan Rudez • SF • Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nRobert Sacre • C • Los Angeles Lakers\n\nKevin Seraphin • PF • New York Knicks\n\nDonald Sloan • PG • Brooklyn Nets\n\nJosh Smith • PF • Houston Rockets\n\nJ.R.
