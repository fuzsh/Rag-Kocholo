        "text": "Ever wanted to ask a sports personality a question? Now’s your chance. They will answer readers’ questions in The Denver Post’s “Fan Mail” feature. In this installment, Nuggets coach George Karl answers readers’ questions about J.R. Smith, Karl’s up-beat mood since the Carmelo Anthony trade and whether or not the Nuggets have a legitimate go-to guy in the clutch.\n\nKeep an eye out for the next week’s installment or make a suggestion for the next guest. Send your Qs in an email to fanmail@denverpost.com.\n\nI am a HUGE Nuggets fan and I’m proud to say I have yet to miss a game. My question for George Karl: What are your current thoughts on J.R. Smith and what is one thing you admire about his game?\n\n— Dua, Denver\n\nGeorge Karl: Probably the thing you admire about him is his explosiveness and his athleticism as an offensive player. From the standpoint of one-on-one skills and individual skills, he’s a top-20 player in basketball.\n\nBut the ability to fit that into the team and fit that into winning basketball has been our challenge. I think J.R., this year, has probably had his best year as far as being a good teammate and committed to the team first. It’s going to be exciting.\n\nIn the games we have remaining, he has a lot of competition to help us win. And from Arron Afflalo to J.R. to Raymond to Gallo to Wilson, all these guys are at that 2-3 position. I have a lot of options and it’s going to be a lot of fun figuring out who’s going to win.\n\nFirst let me say that I love having you coach my favorite NBA team. It’s great to have a future Hall of Famer on the bench. Watching you this past week, it looks like you are enjoying coaching right now more than I have ever seen you enjoy coaching in Denver. Is that true?\n\n— Chris, Lakewood\n\nGK: I would say it’s probably true in regards to the past few years. Any time you’re with a team for a long, long time — and you have excellence — but you never get to the top of the mountain, there’s always a little resentment and a feeling of disappointment, which you always are fighting through.\n\nI think starting a new chapter with these new guys, and having excitement and the possibility of still being a good team, I think that’s gotten everyone energized. And I don’t think it’s just me — I think it’s the organization, the equipment manager, everyone.\n\nWith the new-found depth on our team would you consider a platoon system a la Dean Smith and full-court press for a portion of the game?\n\n— James, Denver\n\nGK: We’ve actually talked about that. I’m not sure if we’ll put that in this year, because we don’t have a lot of practice time left. And with a drastic change with rules and responsibility, you want to be careful, because you already have so much change going on. I would say that we’ve talked about playing a large rotation and, in a catch-up situation, maybe pressing a little more.\n\nWhat’s your take on having a solid 7-footer in the middle? Seems like it’s almost necessary in the formula for a championship team.\n\n— Cass, Highlands Ranch\n\nGK: Well, who was the 7-footer for the Chicago Bulls? Who was the 7-footer for the Detroit Pistons in the late 1980s? There have been a lot of teams that have won the NBA championships, other than the Lakers and Celtics. Now, if you want to take the Lakers/Celtics scenario, they’ve had great centers. But the other teams that have won championships have kind of broken the mold a little bit.\n\nI don’t think you have one mentality. I think you have to look at the players you have and then figure out a system that works around it. You’re always aware that size is a factor in our game, but you want good size, you don’t want bad size.\n\nGeorge, congrats on the contract extension. I was just wondering what one player this year has impressed you the most as far as their improvement and why?\n\n— Logan, Minot, N.D.\n\nGK: I think I’m very impressed with Ty Lawson and Arron Afflalo. They’ve been given responsibility and have accepted it and produced. We were probably a little nervous about the responsibility, and they’ve taken it to even a higher level. They’ve been successful, and we think they can even go farther.\n\nI was wondering how much influence you have when it comes to personnel decisions and what do you believe this team needs to take the next level in competing for a championship?\n\n— Douglas, Aurora\n\nGK: I think my role is … basically, I’m part of the discussions. I don’t think they’ve ever done anything I’ve not wanted to do, so I kind of feel like I have a veto. I’m not always aware of all the things that are going on, but when it gets down to the nitty-gritty, I have ability to say if I like a move or don’t like it, and that’s all I really want.\n\nI think right now we’ve just got to get excited about this team and worry about the next step over the summertime. Right now, we have a lot of pieces that we’ve got to understand better and figure out which ones we want to keep — and which pieces want to stay here.\n\nCount me among those longtime fans who have been surprised and delighted about the post-trade play. I probably love the Nuggets even more now than I did before, and I still like Chauncey and Carmelo. But I’m worried about the end-of-game leadership in close games.\n\nIt seems like NBA teams need to know where the most important basket is coming from in the last minute of the fourth, without Chauncey and Melo. Do you know who our go-to guy or guys will be, and who can be counted on to want the ball and convert the big shot at the end?\n\n— Jared, San Francisco\n\nGK: The “go-to guy” is making good defensive stops. The “go-to guy” is getting extra possessions, making free throws and getting offensive rebounds when it counts. And then, there’s the opportunity to play as a team down the stretch, execute a play and let the game dictate who’s going to make the shot — rather than force the shot.\n\nCongratulations on the new contract. Your career wins with the Nuggets have put you in some elite company with fellow Carolina alums Larry Brown and Doug Moe. Talk about your relationship with each of them and where you view your place in Nuggets history.\n\n— Matt, Aurora\n\nGK: Larry and Doug were kind of pivotal early in my career. I went to Russia with them in 1974 when I was a first-year player and spent 20-some days over there with the USA team. I think I learned a lot about coaching, practices and the teaching styles of Dean Smith coaching disciples and pro coaches.\n\nLarry and coach Smith were the first coaching mentors for me, and Doug has always been my “big brother” from Carolina; always kept me in line and always made fun of me. He was a jokester but also a great friend over the years.\n\nHow much of this current team do you anticipate staying for the 2011-2012 season? Do you see any other glaring needs other then a suitable backup for Nene?\n\n— Rick, Aurora\n\nGK: We have some free-agent situations that we have to address. There are some restricted free agents and some bona fide free agents. What we want to do is, build a team here in the next two months that everyone wants to come back to. I think we can do that. If that happens, then we will have options and the players will have options. And then we’ll figure it out in the summer.\n\nHow is the chemistry between Ty Lawson and Raymond Felton, both on and off the court?\n\n— John, Denver\n\nGK:I think it’s going to be a pretty good chemistry. I think you’ve seen it already on the court and I think too many times in basketball we label positions, instead of just playing basketball. I like the game played simple, and I think these guys make the game happen and make it pretty simple. As for the Carolina connection, I see them talking all the time. I think Raymond will be a guy who motivates Ty to maybe be a little more serious about his professionalism and approach to the game. Overall with the two guys, it’s something we were hoping would work, and so far, it has worked.\n\nGeorge Karl, 59, is the dean of Colorado’s pro coaches, having coached the Nuggets since 2005.\n\nBut it’s more than longevity that’s led sports fans to embrace the former North Carolina Tar Heel.\n\nWith class, guts, candor and humor, he faced down throat cancer and won.\n\nThe illness forced him to miss the final 1 1/2 months of the 2009-10 season. This season, he had to deal with the rumors swirling around all-star forward Carmelo Anthony. Now that Anthony has been traded to the New York Knicks, Karl appears rejuvenated, coaching team basketball they way he’s always wanted to.\n\nEarlier this month, Karl signed a three-year contract extension that will take him through the 2013-14 season. There are three one-year team options after that on a deal that could keep Karl on the Nuggets’ bench through 2016-17.\n\nKarl, who has the third-longest tenure of any active NBA coach behind San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich and Boston’s Doc Rivers, could be 66 when his contract expires.\n\nKarl has coached in Cleveland, Golden State, Seattle, Milwaukee and Denver, where he’s guided the Nuggets to the playoffs in each of his six seasons. Karl is the NBA’s second-winningest active coach after the Lakers’ Phil Jackson."
