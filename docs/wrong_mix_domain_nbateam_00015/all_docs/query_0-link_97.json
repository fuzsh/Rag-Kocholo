        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. – Andre Drummond had 17 points and a career-high 26 rebounds, helping the Detroit Pistons surge to beat the Knicks 96-85 Monday night in a matchup of slumping teams.\n\nThe Pistons had lost four straight and seven of eight. The Knicks have dropped seven straight games and 13 of 15.\n\nCarmelo Anthony scored 10 of his 28 points in a first quarter in which the Knicks led by as much as 14 and were ahead 28-20 when it ended.\n\nThe Pistons outscored the Knicks by three points in the second quarter, 30-20 in the third and started the fourth quarter with eight unanswered points.\n\nDetroit reserves Rodney Stuckey and Will Bynum each scored 16 points, helping their team's bench outscore the Knicks' 36-7.\n\nAmare Stoudemire had 22 points for the Knicks despite playing sparingly in the fourth quarter.\n\nEarly in the game, it looked as if the Knicks would be the team that was motivated to end its skid.\n\nAnthony made his first four shots — all from the outside — for 10 points in six-plus minutes as the Knicks led 14-4. Stoudemire, who scored eight points in the first quarter, made a driving dunk to lift the Knicks to a 25-11 lead.\n\nThe Knicks, who started 8 of 15 from the field, were 9 of 18 in the first quarter. Over the next three quarters, the Knicks went cold. J.R. Smith missed a lot of attempts before closing 5 of 17 from the field and scoring 16 points for the Knicks.\n\nDetroit's Josh Smith had the exact same poor performance shooting and scored 15 points.\n\nGreg Monroe had 11 points and nine rebounds for the Pistons, who are trying to climb up in the Eastern Conference standings to earn a spot in the playoffs for the first time since 2009."
