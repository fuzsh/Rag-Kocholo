        "text": "Joe DiMaggio\n\nDallas celebrates Italian American Baseball Family with SMU film showing on February 21, 2022\n\nSouthern Methodist University (SMU) Department of World Languages and Literatures in collaboration with the SMU International Film Festival and the SMU Italian Club are proud to present the Russo Brothers National Italian American Foundation Film Forum Award-winning documentary, Italian American Baseball Family, on Monday, February 21, 2022 at 7:00 pm at McCord Auditorium (3rd floor of Dallas Hall). Filmmaker and director Roberto Angotti will on hand to introduce the film prior to the screening. Admission is free to SMU students and members of the general public. Due to Covid-19 and social distancing requirements, seating may be limited. Masks are strongly encouraged and requested for all attendees.\n\nItalian American Baseball Family tells the story of the Italian Americans’ role in baseball and in the culture of American sports. The movie documents an ethnic group’s rise from adversity and celebrates its triumphs in breaking into a game that was originally dominated by English, Irish and German immigrants. While some immigrants chose to change their names to mask their Italian identity, most felt the need to preserve and hold on to familiar things such as language, customs, and beliefs as a way of tolerating the discriminatory practices and injustices they encountered in America.\n\nChildren of immigrants felt stuck in the middle between protective parents who did not want the foreign ways of America to affect the close-knit Italian family, and their own desire to blend into the culture in which they were born. These children lived dual identities, conflicted by the rich Italian traditions of their parents inside their homes and the outside world which existed in the streets and in the schools, where they were taught to become American.\n\nThe solution to the stigma of being labeled as outsiders was to discover a way to become less different by assimilating into American culture. As a staple of mainstream American life, baseball presented Italians a viable point of entry as players and fans. By instilling the values of fair play, opportunity and democracy, baseball taught the children of immigrants how to become American.\n\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame has recognized many Italian Americans including Tony Lazzeri, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Phil Rizzuto, Tommy Lasorda, Ron Santo, Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio, and Mike Piazza. In fact, many Italian Americans like Hall of Famer and current Team Italy manager Mike Piazza and Italian American Baseball Foundation co-founder Frank Catalanotto have embraced their ancestral heritage in Italy by playing and coaching for Team Italy in the World Baseball Classic. Italian American Baseball Family also explores how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad. Italian American Baseball Family features interviews with Team Italy players Nick Punto, Francisco Cervelli, Brandon Nimmo, Chris Colabello, and Gavin Cecchini.

Produced by award-winning director Roberto Angotti, Introducing Team Italy Manager Mike Piazza highlights the celebrated career of National Baseball Hall of Famer Mike Piazza.\n\nThe film’s opening scene takes place at the 2020 CON6 Italian Baseball and Softball Convention in Rimini, Italy, where Mike Piazza briefly takes the stage before flashing back to Shea Stadium in New York for the first live sporting event post-9/11. Through the lyrics of his song “What a Come Back”, renowned musician Pato Banton collaborates with director Roberto Angotti to tell the story of how Mike Piazza’s heroic home run helped heal a shaken-up nation in fear. In the case of Mike Piazza, who has beaten the odds from being a last-round courtesy draft pick to becoming a National Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee, the opening song exemplifies the resilience and perseverance Mike Piazza and the American people possessed.\n\nNew York Mets play-by-play announcer Wayne Randazzo makes brief but poignant appearances throughout the 36-minute documentary to attest to Mike Piazza’s footprint in New York and sports history as well as validate the Hall of Famer’s commitment to the growth and development of Italian baseball. Using tidbits of information from Mike Piazza’s New York Times best-selling autobiography Long Shot, the film touches on young Mike’s childhood affinity for Spider-Man and his pregame ritual of eating Tastykake on the way to Philadelphia Phillies games at Veteran’s Stadium.\n\nNarrated by Pato Banton‘s song “No Worry Piazza,” the film retraces the path that Mike Piazza took growing up. A cameo appearance from longtime family friend and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda confirms that Mike was overlooked as a prospect by major-league scouts at that time. The film traverses Piazza’s journey from high school baseball star to National Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee and on to his newest role as manager of the Italian national baseball team. Interview segments from former New York Mets pitcher and teammate John Franco as well as former MLB player and current Team Italy slugger Chris Colabello gauge the excitement around Mike as the new leader for Italian baseball.\n\nThe film revisits Mike Piazza’s call to the National Baseball Hall of Fame when he was selected as an inductee. With the backdrop of Pato Banton’s guitar-driven anthem “Never Give In Piazza,” viewers experience the determination and resilience of Mike Piazza firsthand. Making his way to Cooperstown, New York for the National Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Mike recognizes the roles that Tommy Lasorda and Reggie Smith played in his career. Piazza embraces the life lessons learned from these baseball legends, including to never give in and to never quit. Mike gives thanks to the country of Italy for giving him the gift of his father, whose unwavering faith in him served as an anchor. Then he honors his mother for giving him the gift of his Catholic faith. His parents formed the foundation upon which Mike grounded his career and life, and he brings that same foundation into his own marriage and family.\n\nUsing the classic “Niceness” rhythm, Pato Banton treats viewers to a new song entitled “Baseball Reggae,” an ode to the game and Italian family heritage Mike cherished with all his heart. It also pays tribute to the Italian baseball family of Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Tony Lazzeri, and Phil Rizzuto. The film reveals Mike’s Italian roots in Sciacca, Sicily, and he honors his family heritage by playing for Team Italy in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\n\nIn the next song, “Go Mike Go”, Pato Banton personalizes the reggae classic and creates a fitting tribute to the leader of the Italian baseball revolution, Mike Piazza. From the first beat of the song when Citi Field comes alive as the site of the Mike Piazza Day celebration, viewers travel across the Atlantic mid-song and follow Mike Piazza to Italy. Then Mike Piazza speaks to the media for the first time from the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters in Rome after the official press conference announcing the new Team Italy manager took place.\n\nThe film also captures Mike Piazza being interviewed by the Italian press at the 2020 CON6 Baseball and Softball Coaches Convention in Rimini. Using Pato Banton‘s “My Opinion” rhythm as a soundtrack, Team Italy manager Mike Piazza and pitching coach Bill Holmberg talk to their players behind closed doors about what it will take for them to make the upcoming World Baseball Classic roster. Highlights from Team Italy in the 2013 and 2017 World Baseball Classic competitions are shown with Pato Banton‘s “Gwarn Piazza” in the background.\n\nMike Piazza and Bill Holmberg share their philosophy of developing players at all age levels and their ongoing commitment to growing the game of baseball in Italy with director Roberto Angotti. The film concludes with rare footage of the 2020 CON6 Coaches Convention where Mike is freely taking photos with fans and signing memorabilia. Ultimately, Introducing Team Italy Manager Mike Piazza shows how much the Hall of Fame catcher loves Italy and how Italy wholeheartedly embraces him. Forza #Italia!\n\nFilmmakers Roberto Angotti and Karen De Luca Stephens featured on IDEA Boston’s “Beyond DiMaggio: The Influence of Italian American Players in Baseball” panel\n\nIDEA Boston is an initiative of I AM Books (an abbreviation for Italian AMerican), Boston’s independent Italian bookstore founded in 2015 by Nicola Orichuia and Jim Pinzino. The Boston North End neighborhood bookstore serves as a cultural hub for locals and visitors interested in diving into the rich world of Italian and Italian American culture, literature, history, research, art and more. IDEA Boston will feature 24 panel talks, over 60 speakers, a theatrical performance, a musical performance, a photo exhibit, 11 actors, 12 musicians, and a grand finale party.\n\nThe IDEA Boston festival is an extension of the bookstore’s platform and mission. IDEA Boston is a two-day “Italian-inspired cultural festival, celebrating literature, history, art and many other aspects of Italian and Italian American culture. IDEA Boston kicks off on Friday, November 1, 2019 at the Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts in Cambridge beginning at 12:40 pm with the “Beyond DiMaggio: The Influence of Italian American Players in Baseball” panel featuring two filmmakers focusing on similar subjects. Led by Roberto Angotti and Karen De Luca Stephens, this discussion will dive into the rich and sometimes obscure history of Italian American players in America’s favorite pastime. At a time when Italian immigrants were still seen with suspicion, Italian American players helped break barriers, forcing many to look beyond the stereotypes.\n\nRoberto Angotti is a cultural historian, writer, film director, curator, and radio DJ who blends his love of baseball, Italian American arts and culture, and music into multi-media creations. His film, Italian American Baseball Family, tells the story of how Italian Americans assimilated into popular culture through America’s favorite pastime, baseball, and how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to grow the game by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and the World Baseball Classic.\n\nAt the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) 42nd Anniversary Gala in November 2017, the movie was screened and won the Russo Brothers Italian American Film Forum Award. Angotti is an official Team Italy media representative for Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball (FIBS), and he reports first-hand from international competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and the upcoming 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan: www.FIBS.it/en. He was first inspired to write about baseball in Italy and the USA, Italian American arts and culture, and music through his blog: http://www.MLBforLife.com.\n\nBorn into a Boston immigrant family, Karen De Luca Stephens lived in East Boston until her graduation from Northeastern University with a B.A. in philosophy. After receiving an M.A. in philosophy from the Johns Hopkins University she moved to Mexico City where she and her husband have recently founded the Tlacopac Artist Residency.

Special guest writer, producer, and director Roberto Angotti will introduce the hour-long documentary and answer questions from the audience immediately following the Nevada premiere screening at the Windmill Library, 7060 West Windmill Lane in Las Vegas. Italian American Baseball Family features Lawrence Baldassaro, author of “Beyond DiMaggio: Italian Americans in Baseball” and “Baseball Italian Style”, as well as National Baseball Hall of Fame legend Tommy Lasorda and Major League Baseball (MLB) past and present players Frank Viola, Nick Punto, Francisco Cervelli, Chris Colabello, Brandon Nimmo, and Gavin Cecchini.\n\nItalian American Baseball Family tells the story of the Italian Americans’ role in baseball and in the culture of American sports. The movie documents an ethnic group’s rise from adversity and celebrates its triumphs in breaking into a game that was originally dominated by English, Irish and German immigrants. While some immigrants chose to change their names to mask their Italian identity, most felt the need to preserve and hold on to familiar things such as language, customs, and beliefs as a way of tolerating the discriminatory practices and injustices they encountered in America. Italians were once considered second class citizens in the United States and invisible in baseball before players like Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio rose to prominence.\n\nChildren of immigrants felt stuck in the middle between protective parents who did not want the foreign ways of America to affect the close-knit Italian family, and their own desire to blend into the culture in which they were born. These children lived dual identities, conflicted by the rich Italian traditions of their parents inside their homes and the outside world which existed in the streets and in the schools, where they were taught to become American.\n\nThe solution to the stigma of being labeled as outsiders was to discover a way to become less different by assimilating into American culture. As a staple of mainstream American life, baseball presented Italians a viable point of entry as players and fans. By instilling the values of fair play, opportunity and democracy, baseball taught the children of immigrants how to become American.\n\nAfter Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war and began targeting those of German, Italian, or Japanese descent. The Italians were the largest immigrant group in the U.S. at the time and about 600,000 of the country’s five million Italian immigrants, who had not yet naturalized, were forced to register as enemy aliens. Italians were considered immigrants to America, and baseball was one way these people could counter the negative immigrant identity as an outsider. The game bridged the gap so that Italians could integrate into the American way of life.\n\nMany Italian Americans have participated in all aspects of baseball on the field, in coaching and team management, as broadcasters, and behind the scenes in administration as well. The National Baseball Hall of Fame has recognized many of them including Tony Lazzeri, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Phil Rizzuto, Tommy Lasorda, Ron Santo, Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio, and Mike Piazza.\n\nNo one better epitomizes the culmination of the evolution of Italian American baseball or in American society than A. Bartlett Giamatti. He understood the nature and significance of the immigrant experience, and wrote about it as eloquently as he did about baseball. “Bart” Giamatti was the grandson of an immigrant laborer who became the president of Yale, then president of the National League before ascending to the office of commissioner of MLB. Italian American Baseball Family also explores how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nAlthough brothers Vince, Joe, and Dom DiMaggio may be the premier Italian American Baseball Family, the Colabellos from Milford, Massachusetts are a perfect example of the modern day Italian American Baseball Family. As a father and son combination, both played professional baseball on the biggest international stages, which makes the Colabellos are a rare breed.\n\nFather Lou Colabello was the starting pitcher for Team Italy against host Team USA at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympics while his son Chris Colabello later played baseball in Italy as a youth and, like his father, eventually went on to represent Team Italy internationally After pitching for the University of Massachusetts in a College World Series, Lou Colabello played baseball professionally in Rimini, Italy. His experience as an international baseball ambassador culminated when he pitched for the Italians in the 1984 Olympics. Chris Colabello played for Team Italy in both the 2013 and 2017 World Baseball Classics, bookending major league stints with the Minnesota Twins and Toronto Blue Jays. Flmmaker Roberto Angotti was joined by Chris Colabello and his father, Lou Colabello, for the Boston-area premiere of Italian American Baseball Family last year.\n\nWith the new arrival of Oakland Athletics Triple-A affiliate Las Vegas Aviators, it would come as no surprise to see ballplayers of Italian descent landing at the Nevada premiere of Italian American Baseball Family at the Windmill Library in Las Vegas on Sunday, September 8, 2019 at 2 pm. Admission is free for this family-friendly event.

The 2016 American Community Survey reveals that almost 17 million Italians live in the United States. With more than 500,000 Italian Americans living in greater Chicago, the city trails only New York and Philadelphia as the third largest thriving Italian epicenter in America. Chicago boasts a big and loyal baseball following with two professional Major League teams: the Cubs and South Side rivals White Sox. The city has a rich baseball history, of which outsiders may have little or no knowledge.\n\nChi Town’s first major baseball player of Italian descent was Francesco Pezzolo, known to most as “Ping Bodie.” Francesco was the son of Giuseppe Pezzolo, who emigrated from a small town near Genoa to New York City, and who worked long hours building the Brooklyn Bridge. In 1876 father Giuseppe and mother Rosa moved the family west to a gold-mining settlement in Bodie, California. Francesco Pezzolo was born on October 8, 1887 in San Francisco, and to mask his Italian identity due to racial prejudices and injustices, he changed his professional baseball name to Ping Bodie. After joining the Pacific Coast League’s San Francisco Seals in 1908, Ping Bodie soon became a Bay Area fan favorite and was nicknamed “the Fence Buster”. The Chicago White Sox could not help but notice Ping Bodie when he slugged 30 home runs in 1910 and subsequently signed him to a Major League contract. During his rookie season in 1911, Bodie hit .289 with four homers and 97 RBI. He became a Chicago baseball icon during his four years as a solid contributor to the White Sox. His popularity continued in New York later in his career when he became Babe Ruth‘s first Yankee roommate. Ping Bodie was a father figure for many other West Coast Italian American ballplayers and paved the way for those who followed him including Tony Lazzeri, Frank Crosetti, and the DiMaggio brothers.\n\nChicago is not afraid to profess its love for the late and great Ron Santo. According to Lawrence Baladassaro’s brilliant new book Baseball Italian Style , Ron’s father, Louis Santo, was born in Foggia, Italy, and came to America as a teenager. His son Ron grew up in the heart of “Garlic Gulch,” Seattle’s Italian district. Signed out of high school in 1959, just a year later 20-year-old Ron Santo made his MLB debut on June 26, 1960, when he had three hits and five RBI in a double-header sweep. In his 14 seasons with the Cubs, Santo was named to nine National League All-Star teams and won five consecutive Gold Glove awards (1964-68). He had four seasons with 100 or more RBI and hit 30 or more home runs in four consecutive seasons (1964-67). The 2012 Hall-of-Fame inductee hit 337 home runs and drove in 1,290 runs as a Cub, then played the final season of his career with the White Sox before retiring at age 34. He later became the Cubs radio color commentator in 1990 and held the position until his passing in 2010. A statue of the beloved Cub player and broadcaster was resurrected outside Wrigley Field in 2011 to honor his legacy.\n\nThere is one special Chicago Italian who has played for Team Italy in the Olympics and the World Baseball Classic. That unsung hero’s name is Fabio Milano, a former pitching all-star who played for Team Italy in the 2001 World Cup, 2004 Olympics and the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Milano is also father to a pair of up-and-coming Team Italy softball stars. Maya and Kylie Milano. Another Chicago Italian who deserves a Hollywood Star for helping hundreds develop their craft is Paul Petricca, author of Hitting with Torque: For Softball and Baseball Players. Petricca along with The St. Joseph Club of Italian Americans are proud to present a “Celebration of Italian Baseball and Softball” on Saturday, June 2, 2018 at the Metropolis Performing Arts Centre, 111 W. Campbell Street in Arlington Heights beginning at 11:00 am. The Russo Brothers Italian American Film Forum Award-winning documentary, Italian American Baseball Family, will be shown.\n\nImmediately following the screening of the movie, a Q & A discussion with filmmaker Roberto Angotti and a panel of former Italian baseball players will interact with the audience in an engaging discussion on playing baseball internationally. Panelists scheduled to appear include: Fabio Milano, Joe Mazzuca, former Marlins prospect who played for Team Italy internationally from 2006-2014; Barth Morreale Jr., who began pitching in Bologna in 2006 and led his team to victory in the 2011 European Cup; and Brent Consiglio, who played in baseball in Poviglio after graduating from the University of Chicago in 2004.\n\nAngotti’s film Italian American Baseball Family documents the Italian American experience on how Italians assimilated into popular culture through America’s favorite pastime, baseball, and how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and the World Baseball Classic. He is excited to bring the movie to Chicago, where University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Professor Emeritus Lawrence Baldassaro (author of Beyond DiMaggio: Italian Americans in Baseball and Baseball Italian Style) was interviewed for the documentary at the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame and Ron Onesti was filmed at Piazza DiMaggio in Little Italy on Taylor Street. Angotti said, “Chicago has a rich Italian cultural heritage, and as a proud Italian American, I am delighted to share the film with lovers of baseball and history. Whether you are a fan of Ron Santo or Anthony Rizzo, there will be something for everybody during our celebration of Italian baseball and softball at the Metropolis.” Attendees are encouraged to participate in a silent auction featuring premium Chicago Cubs tickets, private pitching and hitting sessions and more. Tickets are available at the door.

Examining the experiences of baseball pioneers, current players and coaches, fans, and historians, filmmaker Roberto Angotti captures the story of how Italian Americans assimilated into popular culture through America’s favorite pastime in his new hour-long Italian American Baseball Family documentary. The film also explores how Italian Americans have circled back to Italy to help grow the game abroad by playing for Team Italy in the Olympics and the World Baseball Classic. Although brothers Vince, Joe, and Dom DiMaggio may be the premier Italian American Baseball Family, the Colabellos from Milford, Massachusetts are a perfect example of the modern day Italian American Baseball Family. Father Lou Colabello was the starting pitcher for Team Italy against host Team USA at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympics while his son Chris Colabello later played baseball in Italy as a youth and, like his father, eventually went on to represent Team Italy in the 2013 and 2017 World Baseball Classics.\n\nThe Italian American Baseball Family traverses the U.S. cultural landscape and documents an ethnic group’s rise from adversity by celebrating its triumphs in breaking into a sport originally dominated by English, Irish and German immigrants. The 2017 Russo Brothers Italian American Film Forum Award-winning movie showcases both the hardships and accomplishments of legendary Italian American baseball players.\n\nAfter Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war and began targeting those of German, Italian, or Japanese descent. The Italians were the largest immigrant group in the U.S. at the time and about 600,000 of the country’s five million Italian immigrants who had not yet naturalized were forced to register as enemy aliens. Baseball came ashore to Italy in 1944 when allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Nettuno and nearby Anzio en route to freeing Rome from its Nazi occupiers. American troops brought baseball gear and taught Italians how to play. Baseball countered the negative immigrant identity as an outsider. The game bridged the gap so that Italians could integrate into the American way of life.\n\nThe Italian American Baseball Family brings home the message that baseball allowed Italian Americans to assimilate into popular culture. The documentary honors the Italian American baseball ambassadors who have etched their names into U.S. sports history. The film pays tribute to their invaluable contributions and acknowledges those players who have left their unique imprint on the game.\n\nFilmmaker Roberto Angotti said, “It was an exhilarating experience and so rewarding to interview mentor and renowned historian Lawrence Baldassaro, author of Beyond DiMaggio: Italian Americans in Baseball at the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in Chicago as well as National Baseball Hall of Fame legend Tommy Lasorda. Getting to speak with MLB past and present players Frank Viola, Nick Punto, Francisco Cervelli, Chris Colabello, Brandon Nimmo, and Gavin Cecchini for the Italian American Baseball Family was also a privilege and an honor.”\n\nRoberto was fascinated by the game of baseball since he was a child and played Little League. He witnessed Tommy Lasorda lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to two World Series titles in the 1980s. In high school, he played American Legion baseball. As a Film Studies student at Claremont McKenna College (CMC), Angotti did play-by-play broadcasts for Pomona-Pitzer Baseball while program director at KSPC 88.7 FM. His education at CMC was the foundation for him to catapult into the entertainment industry. Roberto was recently the subject of a CMC alumni profile. To access the article, click on this link: https://www.cmc.edu/news/filmmaker-roberto-angotti-traces-roots-of-italian-american-baseball. Throughout his professional radio career at KNAC 105.5 FM (Long Beach), KROQ 106.7 FM (Pasadena/Los Angeles) as well as 91X and 92.5 FM (San Diego), he integrated music, sports, and popular culture to become one of the most listened to on-air personalities in Southern California.\n\nIn 2011 Angotti launched an MLB.com blog which eventually became a Top 10 MLB.com Fan website – www.MLBforLife.com – to showcase up-and-coming Italian and Italian American players. After visiting the Italian Baseball Academy near Pisa, Roberto was invited to the 2013 World Baseball Classic in Phoenix, Arizona, where he got to know Mike Piazza, who served as hitting coach for Team Italy. Piazza inspired him to document the Italian American experience. That same year Angotti curated the Artists’ Tribute to Italian Americans in Baseball exhibition at the Convivio Center in San Diego’s Little Italy. The exhibit featured Italian American artists who focused their work on Italian American Baseball Hall of Famers: Tony Lazzeri, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Ernie Lombardi, Phil Rizzuto, Tommy Lasorda, Ron Santo, Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio, and Mike Piazza.\n\nAs the English language editor and reporter for Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball (www.fibs.it/en), Angotti represented the Italian national teams at three international competitions in 2017: the World Baseball Classic in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) U-19 Junior Women’s World Championship in Clearwater, Florida; and the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhen Roberto returned from the 2017 World Baseball Classic, he resolved to make a film about Italian Americans and their integral role in baseball. The National Italian American Foundation (NIAF), the Italian Sons and Daughters of America, and the Russo Brothers offered the Italian American Film Forum Grant to filmmakers wanting to share the Italian American experience. It was a natural fit so Angotti applied and was chosen as one of seven grant recipients. Later he was selected as one of three finalists invited to the 42nd Anniversary NIAF Gala Weekend in Washington, D.C., where he was proclaimed the winner and presented the Russo Brothers Italian American Film Forum Award by Italian Sons and Daughters of America President Basil Russo, National Italian American Foundation President John Viola and FOX Business Network TV Anchor/Global Markets Editor Maria Bartiromo on Saturday, November 4, 2017.\n\nAngotti plans to make a series of Italian American baseball films. He sees his first documentary as a way to educate young Italian Americans and others on the plight of Italian immigrants, using baseball as a focal point. He said, “Italians were once second class citizens in the United States, and invisible in baseball before players like Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio rose to prominence. Not having an appreciation of your heritage is like an olive tree without roots. Baseball is a part of mine.”\n\nItalian American Baseball Family goes to bat for FIBS and recent earthquake relief efforts in Italia\n\nItalia coach Frank Catalanotto, Mint Pros‘ Joe Quagliano, and National Baseball Hall of Fame artist James Fiorentino are hosts of a special fundraising event to benefit Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball (FIBS) and Italian earthquake relief as well as honor Team Italia in the 2017 World Baseball Classic on December 8th at Carmine’s Restaurant and Sports Bar in Brooklyn, New York. FIBS president Riccardo Fraccari and Team Italia manager Marco Mazzieri are among the honorary guests scheduled to appear. New York Mets announcer and National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame supporter Wayne Randazzo will emcee.\n\nAmong other memorable moments, the family of Yogi Berra will be presented with the late Italian American’s retired number 8 Italia coaches jersey from 2008, and internationally acclaimed artist James Fiorentino will honor Team Italia hitting coach Mike Piazza by revealing his commissioned portrait of the 2016 National Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee during the dinner ceremonies. All fundraising dinner proceeds will support youth baseball in Italy by building and maintaining ball fields, purchase uniforms and equipment, organize clinics and other youth baseball programs under FIBS’ guidance.\n\nMike Piazza met FIBS president Riccardo Fraccari in 2002 while visiting Italy on a MLB International mission to help grow the game in Europe. Fraccari asked Piazza if he would be interested in representing Italy in international competition, and the proud Italian American responded that it would be privilege to play for the Italian national team in honor of his Sicilian ancestry. University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee professor emeritus of Italian Lawrence Baldassaro-who served as the interpreter for Team Italia at the 2006 WBC–said, “Of all the younger Major League players I interviewed for my book, Beyond DiMaggio: Italian Americans in Baseball, none was more in touch with, and interested in, his Italian heritage than Mike Piazza. And his commitment to baseball in Italy is unmatched among those his age.” In response Mike Piazza replied, “We just want to continue to draw attention to the fact that we believe baseball is marketable in Italy. We think it’s viable. We think there’s a lot of upward growth. We can produce players over there. I’m convinced of it.”\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nCarmine Gangone has been slinging pizza at his family’s Williamsburg restaurant in Brooklyn since he was 7 years old. Carmine’s Pizzeria was opened nearly four decades ago by his hard-working Italian immigrant father from Salerno. Carmine’s Restaurant and Sports Bar has since become a favorite New York Yankees enclave with its enormous display of Brooklyn Bombers memorabilia, which most notably includes Italian American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio. Carmine’s Restaurant and Sports Bar plays host to the Italian American Baseball Family Launch and Fundraiser Dinner on December 8th. Team Italia coaches Mike Piazza and Frank Catalanotto, Team Italia players Jason Grilli and Francisco Cervelli as well as other MLB players including Mike Napoli are expected.

It will be a family reunion of sorts since John Francis D’Acquisto was born in San Diego on December 24, 1951. He would later become a hometown hero while attending St. Augustine High School, where he excelled in both football and baseball.\n\nIn the 1920’s, most Italian immigrants who settled near downtown San Diego were fishermen from Genoa and Sicily. Many other Italian fishermen and their families moved to San Diego from San Francisco after the devastating 1906 earthquake. Like Joe DiMaggio’s father– who was a fisherman in the Bay Area–John D’Acquisto’s father, Fred D’Acquisto Sr., also depended on the fishing industry to put food on the table. As serendipitous as it may sound, the two sons of Italian immigrant families would meet in 1975 when John was honored by Joe DiMaggio and the Italian-American Society as its “Italian-American of the Year”. John’s father, Fred D’Acquisto Sr., was a local San Diego celebrity for 51 years as he worked for the legendary Anthony’s Fish Grotto Restaurant in the vibrant downtown Little Italy community. Starting out as a young teenager, John’s father worked himself up to dining room manager and would split his time between the original restaurant and their sister location, the Star of the Seas.\n\nA first-round pick in the 1970 amateur draft, John D’Acquisto was selected by the San Francisco Giants. Blessed with a death-defying fastball, “Johnny D” made his MLB debut for the Giants late in the 1973 season. He was named National League Rookie of the Year and National League Rookie Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News in 1974. During the span of his ten season career, John D’Acquisto pitched for the Giants, Cardinals, Padres, Expos, Angels and Athletics from 1973-1982.
