        "text": "When Joe DiMaggio died in 1999, he was mourned by generations of Americans who felt that they had lost a part of themselves. DiMaggio's reputation as the most graceful and glorious baseball player of the 1940s was only the start of what made him into a national hero for half a century.\n\nForeigners who knew of him merely as one of Marilyn Monroe's husbands, or as a line in a Simon and Garfunkel song, can have little idea of the Yankee Clipper's status as the icon of what Americans now call The Greatest Generation.\n\nBut there was also another Joe DiMaggio, especially in the later years, one that Americans glimpsed but mostly preferred not to recognise.\n\nThis DiMaggio was vain, self-centred, suspicious, cruel and, above all, mean, even miserly. He knew exactly how good he was as a player and he also knew how important he was as a national symbol. So this DiMaggio spent most of his life coldly screwing the rest of the world for every last cent he could make from it. There were Mafia connections too, including with the Chicago mob boss, Sam Giancana.\n\nThe other Joe DiMaggio is the subject of a new biography by Richard Ben Cramer which has hit America hard. The Dark Side of DiMaggio is how Newsweek, which carried extracts in its latest issue, put it. Mr Cramer's book does more than tarnish a national idol, the New York Times reflected this week. \"It will tarnish the American myth\".\n\nDiMaggio was a peerless player and that status meant he spent his life on a pedestal. \"It was his destiny to stand alone,\" Mr Cramer writes.\n\n\"No wonder we strove for 60 years to give him the hero's life. It was always about us, alas, it was his destiny to know that as well.\"\n\nMoney was what DiMaggio cared about most of all. He knew both his value and his price, and he always suspected strangers of trying to rip him off. His signature on a baseball was worth hundreds and he exploited it to his dying day. He sold some of his trophies, then pretended they had been stolen, so the Yankees would give him a fresh set.\n\nHe made thousands every year from reselling hundreds of free tickets that he requested from events he had no intention of attending. When a Japanese backer gave him a Cadillac - he always had free cars - his response was \"Did you fill it up with gas?\" When the tank ran dry, he gave the Cadillac to his granddaughter.\n\nDiMaggio lived in a world of freebies and tax evasion. When the Oakland A's, the only other major league team he ever worked for, invited him to attend special games, his price was a first-class return from Miami, his official home, even though he would often be in San Francisco, a $20 cab ride away from Oakland . Not that he paid for cabs.\n\nWhen he accepted an invitation to a celebrity golf tournament, he would say he had no clubs and no kit. In his garage, as a result, there were dozens of sets of freshly minted golf clubs, shirts, shoes and balls, most unused, many of them still in their wrapping.\n\nWhen the 1989 earthquake hit San Francisco - Di Maggio's home town where his Sicilian born father was a fisherman - Jolting Joe got special permission to go to his sister's house. He re-emerged with a binliner containing $600,000 that he had stashed away.\n\nThe publication of Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life comes at a moment when America's - and in particular New York's - infinite capacity for sentimental self-regard is about to enjoy a fresh flowering. Tomorrow, DiMaggio's team, the New York Yankees, take on their neighbours the New York Mets in the first game of an all-Big Apple baseball World Series that the city has dreamed of for decades."
