Giuliani today joined Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to honor Yankee Legend Joe \"Joltin' Joe\" DiMaggio and to rename the West Side Highway Joe DiMaggio Highway. Adorned with crossed bats and baseballs, the new green and white signs will be posted on the southbound side of the West Side Highway at 70th Street and on the northbound side at West Street between Morris and Thames near the Brooklyn Battery Park Tunnel.\n\nAlso joining the Mayor at today's ceremony were the baseball great's granddaughters Paula Hamra and Kathie Stein, and State Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver and State Senator Serphin Maltese, both of whom sponsored the legislation renaming the highway.\n\n\"Joe DiMaggio was the greatest living baseball player and represented the very best of American sports,\" Mayor Giuliani said. \"He was the personification of Yankee pride and has proven to be an enduring symbol of grace and greatness in baseball. He led the Yankees to 9 World Series and set records, which may never be broken. He was a gentleman on and off the field. As long as our national pastime is played, Joe DiMaggio will exemplify the spirit of the game.\n\n\"Today, we honor his legacy by renaming the West Side Highway as Joe DiMaggio Highway,\" the Mayor continued. \"This is a small tribute to a great man and an incomparable athlete who gave so much to New Yorkers and baseball fans around the world. I am very pleased that Joe was informed of our plans to rename the West Side Highway in his honor and that we do so today with his blessing. I know all New Yorkers will remember the greatness of the Yankee Clipper as they drive along this highway. I want to thank the DiMaggio family and George Steinbrenner for joining me on this very special day. I also want to thank Speaker Silver and Senator Maltese for sponsoring the legislation to rename the West Side Highway, and Governor Pataki, whose support has made this tribute possible.\"\n\nJoe DiMaggio is remembered as one of baseball's most graceful athletes, both at bat and in center field. Many sports fans consider his 56 consecutive game batting streak in 1941 the top baseball feat of all time. The Yankee Clipper was a two-time batting champion and a three-time MVP. Over his 13 year career with the Yankees DiMaggio hit 361 home runs, averaged 118 RBI's per season and had a .325 lifetime batting average. The Hall of Famer passed away on March 8th.\n\nOn March 17th, the New York State Senate and Assembly passed legislation to rename the West Side Highway between 72nd Street and Battery Park Place Joe DiMaggio Highway. The bill was signed into law on March 30th.\n\nwww.ci.nyc.ny.us"
