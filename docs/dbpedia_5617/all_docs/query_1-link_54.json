        "text": "Eighty-four years ago when there was baseball&mldr;\n\nIt was the spring of 1936 and two stars of the New York Yankees were charged with taking a rookie to spring training in Florida. The veterans, Tony Lazzeri and Frank Crosetti, were Italians from San Francisco, as was the rookie.\n\nThe three would make the cross country trip by car. The rookie said he didn’t drive and sat quietly in the back seat for the drive.\n\nWhen they arrived in St. Petersburg, Fla., the rookie entered the Yankee locker room and changed the fortunes of the team and began building a legendary career, one that surpassed the game itself and continued to climb long after his playing career had ended.\n\nJoe DiMaggio had arrived.\n\nThe Yankees, of course, had had superstars before DiMaggio. The great Bambino Babe Ruth and the Lion Lou Gehrig. But DiMaggio brought a different flavor. He embodied class and grace and would effortlessly glide across center field in Yankee Stadium for many seasons. He would be known as the Yankee Clipper, the symbol of the greatness of the Yankees.\n\nMore: One unscientific survey shows just how hard gaining 75 percent of MLB Hall of Fame vote can be\n\nMore: The magic of No. 42 transcends across the entire sports world\n\nHe was only 21 that spring, but had proven his worth in the highly competitive Pacific Coast League.\n\nFive more things you might not know about DiMaggio:\n\n*He and his brothers all have the middle name of Paul, after his father.\n\n*He wore No. 9 in 1936 and switched to No. 5 the next year.\n\n*He had a then record 61-game hitting streak with the San Francisco Seals in the PCL in 1933.\n\n*After his streak of 56 consecutive games with a hit came to an end in 1941, he went on to collect hits in 16 more consecutive games, giving him hits in 72 of 73 games.\n\n*His first wife, Dorothy Arnold, is buried in Cathedral City.\n\nThe Yankees would dominate in ’36, winning 102 games and leaving the second-place Detroit Tigers in the dust, 19.5 games behind and 434 runs less than the boys from the Bronx.\n\nDiMaggio was brilliant, hitting 29 home runs, 44 doubles, 15 triples and driving in 125 runs. The wonderful Gehrig was 33, but still the heart of the team. He hit 49 homers that year, drove in 152 runs and hit .354, while being named the MVP of the league.\n\nThere were others. In fact, six members of that ’36 team would all make it to the Hall of Fame – DiMaggio, Gehrig, Lazzeri, catcher Bill Dickey and pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. Along with manager Joe McCarthy and coach Earle Combs.\n\nThe Yankees then started an unprecedented run of dominance, winning the World Series for four consecutive seasons and 12 times in the next 18 years. DiMaggio would be on the winning team nine times in his 13-year career.\n\nHe would be named the league MVP three times, be on the Al-Star team every year he played and set one of the most hallowed records in sports – a 56-game hitting streak in 1941.\n\nOf course, DiMaggio was seemingly bigger than baseball. He was romanticized in song (“Here’s to You Mrs. Robinson”), literature (Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea”) and TV commercials (Mr. Coffee). He would marry the most glamorous star in Hollywood, Marilyn Monroe.\n\nHe was, and still is, the rare athlete who transcended his sport and became a national celebrity on all levels of life.\n\nAnd it all began with a cross country ride in the back of a car.\n\nWhen spring meant baseball&mldr;\n\nPete Donovan is a Palm Desert resident and former Los Angeles Times sports reporter.
