        "text": "\"Author Jonathan Weeks proficiently shares the tale of an American diamond icon in his book, Tales of the Yankee Clipper: Stories and Reflections on Joe DiMaggio. Mr. Weeks encapsulates all facets of this complex individual in his work, regarding both Joe DiMaggio’s baseball career and his personal life. Impeccably researched and masterfully written, the author has crafted together an entertaining and informative narrative. When it comes to stories in the book, Mr. Weeks covers all the bases, including DiMaggio’s relationship with and marriage to Marilyn Monroe. Some of these exhilarating tales include the bizarre incident involving the kidnapping of Joe’s older sister Nellie in 1917, how his favorite bat, “Betsy Ann,” turned up missing amid his 56-game hitting streak in 1941, and a treasure trove of anecdotes from New York teammate Lefty Gomez. Mr. Weeks presents DiMaggio’s life story with expert aplomb, and this book beautifully concludes the author’s Yankees trilogy, spanning over fifty years of baseball history.\"\n\n— Ronald T. Waldo, baseball historian and author of Days of Reckoning: Players Punching Their Ticket Out of Pittsburgh During the Barney Dreyfuss Era\n\n\"Very few baseball heroes have been the subject of more words than Joe DiMaggio, and reading this fascinating book helps explain why. More than a biography--although Joe's life is well-summarized here--it is filled with quotes, anecdotes, statistical oddities, trivia that could help you win a few bar bets, and a fair bit of humor. Joe was an unusual man, pushed and pulled by millions who wanted or expected something from him, but he only seemed truly comfortable when he was winning baseball games. And he did a fair bit of that.\"\n\n— Mark Armour, baseball researcher, historian, and writer\n\n\"Jon Weeks provides a thorough and even-handed analysis of Joe DiMaggio's life and career, from his childhood in San Francisco to his death. Included are fascinating tidbits about the great Yankee Clipper, and how he became the icon we know today.\"\n\n— Dennis Snelling, three-time Casey Award finalist and author of Lefty O'Doul: Baseball's Forgotten Ambassador\n\nIf you loved Mickey Mantle as I did, you will love Jon Weeks's well-researched, intimate biography of the Yankee icon. You'll learn many interesting details of Mickey's life that you never knew before as you travel with him from his threadbare childhood in Commerce, Oklahoma to his stardom and acclaim in New York and through his checkered baseball after-life.\n\n— Peter Golenbock, author of 7: The Mickey Mantle Novel\n\nA fine compendium of all things Mickey Mantle, perfect for a longtime fan looking to revisit the past or a new fan just beginning to learn about \"The Mick.\" Keep this by your chair all season long.\n\n— Glenn Stout, author of Yankee Century , Fenway 1912 , and Young Woman and the Sea"
