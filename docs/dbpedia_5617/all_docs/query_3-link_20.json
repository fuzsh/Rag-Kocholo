        "text": "Join a Discussion on Baseball: The New York Yankees\n\nBy DAVE ANDERSON\n\nOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- Outside the low Yankee Clipper Center office building, Joe DiMaggio and his attorney, Morris Engelberg, were walking toward a white Dodge Caravan with the words \"The Yankee Clipper\" in navy blue above the rear window.\n\nThe license plate read DIMAG 5.\n\n\"Is this yours, Morris?\" a visitor asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Engelberg said as the Yankee Clipper himself turned to the visitor and chuckled.\n\n\"You don't think it'd be mine, do you?\" he said.\n\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio, who will be 84 years old on Nov. 25, is often introduced as \"baseball's greatest living player,\" but he is also baseball's most private personality. He is seen throwing out the first ball at Yankee Stadium on opening days and Old-Timers' Days, but then it's as if he vanishes inside his mystique.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys who looks to be in the limelight,\" DiMaggio said in a rare interview recently.\n\nHe never did. In his 13 seasons as a Hall of Fame center fielder from 1936 to 1951 (with three years out for Army service during World War II), he had a career average of .325 with 361 home runs and 1,537 runs batted in while the Yankees won 10 American League pennants and nine World Series.\n\nShy and serious, he always preferred his privacy. He played and has lived with what in his time was known as class.\n\n\"When Joe walked into the clubhouse, the lights flickered,\" Pete Sheehy, the Yankees' clubhouse custodian in those years, often said. \"Joe was a star.\"\n\nHe still is. He is the symbol of another era, of another breed of athlete. His name has raised millions of dollars for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital here at Memorial Regional Hospital, where the motto is, \"Whether rich or poor, no child is turned away.\"\n\nHe has a cameo role in a forthcoming motion picture, \"The First of May,\" in which he plays what he called an \"ol' dude\" advising a youngster on how to hit.\n\nDiMaggio gets dozens of letters from fans each day. His swing will be memorialized in a statue outside the National Italian Sports Hall of Fame in Chicago later this month. He commands six-figure fees at baseball memorabilia shows to sign his name, which he always does in careful, flowing penmanship, never a scrawl.\n\nSitting in his attorney's office now, DiMaggio was surrounded by photos and memorabilia of himself, but it was Engelberg's collection, not his.\n\n\"I don't have that much stuff,\" he said. \"Baseballs autographed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter and Bush. Another ball autographed by both President Reagan and Russia's Mikhail Gorbachev at a White House dinner I was invited to. And I still have the sterling silver humidor the players gave me.\"\n\nOne night late in the 1941 season, DiMaggio walked into a room at the Shoreham hotel in Washington and was startled to see his teammates with raised champagne glasses singing, \"For you're a jolly good fellow.\" He was handed a gift-wrapped package. Inside was a sterling silver cigar humidor.\n\n\"Presented to Joe DiMaggio,\" the inscription read, \"by his fellow players on the New York Yankees to express their admiration for his consecutive-games hitting record, 1941.\"\n\nEngraved on one side was \"56\" for the number of games in the streak; on the other was \"91\" for the number of hits during the streak. Below the inscription were the engraved signatures of all his teammates.\n\n\"Years later,\" he recalled, \"I met a man who told me he had worked at Tiffany's where they made the humidor. He gave me the blueprints for it.\"\n\nWhen he is not traveling, DiMaggio lives alone here in a home on exclusive Harbour Island. He has a white Mercedes-Benz, a gift from the Yankees, but he prefers to drive a gray Toyota Corolla -- without vanity license plates.\n\n\"He's a shy, meticulous man,\" Engelberg said. \"He cooks for himself. He pumps his own gas. He shines his own shoes.\"\n\nDiMaggio's black wing-tips glistened. He was wearing a navy blue cashmere blazer, gray slacks and what appeared to be a new white shirt with a burgundy polka-dot tie knotted just so. On the third finger of his left hand shone a gold ring encrusted with a white diamond in the shape of a baseball diamond, his 1936 World Series ring, his rookie year with the Yankees.\n\n\"My other World Series rings were stolen,\" he said. \"In the early '60s, I was living at the Lexington Hotel in New York and working for a company that supplied military post exchanges. I had a beautiful alligator-covered jewelry box for my other rings along with some cuff links and tie clasps. I went to Alaska for five days and when I got back, everything had been stolen.\n\n\"The only thing they didn't take was a pair of rosary beads.\"\n\nDiMaggio has often named the 1936 Yankees the best of his nine World Series teams. With a 102-51 record, they won the AL pennant by 19-and-a-half games and took the Series from the New York Giants in six games. Six players from that team would be voted into the Hall of Fame: first baseman Lou Gehrig, catcher Bill Dickey, second baseman Tony Lazzeri, the pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez, and DiMaggio.\n\n\"Joe has a picture of that '36 team in his home,\" Engelberg said. \"Whenever he looks it, he'll say, 'What a great bunch of guys,' and tears come to his eyes.\"\n\nIn this Year of the Yankees, who have already clinched the AL East title, DiMaggio has seen games occasionally on cable television. He spoke admiringly of center fielder Bernie Williams, saying: \"I like that kid. He plays the game to win.\" But he warned that despite the Yankees' domination, anything can happen in the World Series. As it did in 1942, the only time one of his Yankee teams lost the Series.\n\n\"In 1942 we won 103 games, won the pennant by nine games and won the Series opener, then the Cardinals beat us four straight,\" he said. \"We weren't hitting and they had some good pitchers. Johnny Beazley beat us twice. In the last game we had the bases loaded with two out and he threw me a big curveball, but I hit a grounder to third base. I had seven hits in that Series, all singles.\"\n\nDiMaggio was aware of the assault on Roger Maris' record 61 home runs by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa -- which McGwire has since broken -- but he sounded somewhat bewildered by it.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" he said. \"I don't understand the game now. All these home runs, but Hank Greenberg hit 58 home runs one year, Jimmie Foxx hit 58.\"\n\nAsked about McGwire's use of androstenedione, an over-the-counter testosterone-boosting compound banned in the Olympics and pro football but allowed in baseball, DiMaggio said: \"All I ever did was ask Pete Sheehy for half a cup of coffee when I got to the clubhouse. But there were a lot of half a cups. It stayed hot that way.\"\n\nAccording to Engelberg, DiMaggio doesn't even take painkillers for the arthritic aches (from sliding hard as a base runner) that have thinned his midcareer 6-foot-2-inch, 193-pound frame. He has a pacemaker. The skin below his left eye is pink from what he described as \"dry eye.\" But he had the laugh of a happy man.\n\n\"That's because of my two grandkids and my four great-grandkids,\" he said.\n\nDiMaggio was married twice, to Dorothy Arnold, who bore him his only child, Joe. Jr., and to the actress Marilyn Monroe. Both marriages ended in divorce. The loves of his life now are his four great-grandchildren: Vanessah, 11; Kendahl, 11; Valerie, 9; and Mitchell, 7. They live in northern California and he phones them almost every night.\n\n\"I'm always thinking, what can I do for them?\" he said. \"What can I get for them? I like to get them the newest computers. I'm big on education.\"\n\nMaybe that's because he never finished Galileo High School in San Francisco, preferring to join the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League when he was 17.\n\n\"I played the last three games of the 1932 season as their shortstop,\" he said, laughing. \"I kept throwing the ball into the stands behind first base, but my first time up, I hit a triple. And they never paid me. They didn't even give me a nickel for my carfare to the ball park.\"\n\nHe didn't need a high school diploma to hit a baseball, or to grow into a suave gentleman who would inspire artists to include him in literature and song.\n\nIn the novel \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" Ernest Hemingway has the Cuban fisherman say: \"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.\" In the song \"Mrs. Robinson,\" Paul Simon laments, \"Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you.\"\n\nHe remembered conversations with Hemingway at the old Toots Shor's restaurant on West 50th Street.\n\n\"One night we all went to a big fight at Yankee Stadium,\" he said. \"When the crowd saw me walking to ringside, they cheered. Hemingway asked Toots, 'What's going on here?' Toots told him, 'They're cheering Joe,' and I heard Hemingway say, 'The fight is going to be anticlimactic.' \"\n\nNot long after DiMaggio heard Simon's song, he met Simon in a New York restaurant.\n\n\"I asked Paul what the song meant -- was it derogatory?\" he recalled. \"He explained it to me.\"\n\nAnd early in 1982, his name would be the last words in Red Smith's last sports column in The New York Times. Smith was writing about his relationships with athletes through the years. He wrote of \"a longish period when my rapport with some who were less than great made me nervous.\"\n\n\"Maybe I was stuck on bad ballplayers,\" Smith wrote. \"I told myself not to worry. Some day there would be another Joe DiMaggio.\"\n\nMaybe there will be another, but not necessarily.\n\nThat was apparent as DiMaggio visited some of the young patients in the hospital, which soon will have 170 beds. In a corridor, gray-haired Stanley Bine walked up to the familiar face with the silver hair.\n\n\" DiMaggio,\" he said, \"I just want to thank you for this hospital, for helping my granddaughter Alison get through cystic fibrosis.\"\n\nMoments later another gray-haired man in a red smock, 90-year-old Edward Wolf, introduced himself to DiMaggio as a hospital volunteer who once owned a Bronx cleaning shop not far from Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"That was 60 years ago when you were playing,\" Wolf said. \"I've always wanted to shake your hand.\"\n\nThe youngsters knew him, too. When he stopped to see Marcos Acosta, the 17-year-old leukemia patient predicted that Sammy Sosa would hit more home runs than Mark McGwire this season.\n\n\"You might be right,\" DiMaggio said.\n\nSoon he walked into Alison Bine's room.\n\n\"You have a nice smile, so everything must be getting better,\" he said. \"I hope you're up and around soon and going to games instead of watching them on TV.\"\n\nMinutes later, back in the white Dodge Caravan with the DIMAG 5 plates, Engelberg mentioned the hospital's expanded neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\"We didn't see the neonatal,\" Joe DiMaggio said, annoyed. \"Why didn't we see that?\""
