        "text": "How is it possible to know the lyrics to “American Pie” and other ancient songs but not be able to recall the guy’s name who just introduced himself five minutes ago?\n\n“I can’t remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride, but something touched me deep inside the day the music died.” (Don McLean)\n\nLet’s see, is his name “George,” “Gene,” “Gary” . . . Oh well. “Hey, neighbor, how you doin’?”\n\nIf I’m given six items to pick up at the store I might remember three or four but all six could be a stretch. “We need bread, milk, a dozen eggs . . . orange juice, no . . . flour, sugar, cereal . . . no, no, no.”\n\n“Oh, I believe there are angels among us, sent down to us from somewhere up above. They come to you and me in our darkest hours, to show us how to live, teach us how to give, to guide us through the light of love.” (Alabama)\n\nSometimes I struggle to remember my computer password or whether I was to meet friends for breakfast at Whataburger or McDonald’s.\n\nIn a “Psychology Today” piece, the author said that it is not uncommon to be more interested in song lyrics than simple daily occurrences. It may be even easier to forget a doctor’s appointment than the words to the Eagles “Already Gone.”\n\n“Just remember this my girl, when you look up in the sky at night you can see the stars and still not see the light.”\n\nMemory serves well when I first heard a specific song.\n\n“Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio our nation turns its lonely eyes to you . . . woo, woo, woo.” Do you realize “Mrs. Robinson” would be about 112 today?\n\nPsychologists explain that music can trigger an emotion often linked to a specific event. We may forget Aunt Susie’s birthday, the words to “Blessed Assurance” come easy. Favorite hymns and tunes go on forever.\n\n“They walked away from everything just to see a dream come true. So God bless the boys who make the noise on 16th Avenue.” (Lacy J. Dalton)\n\nBrain preference has a lot to do with memory, according to Stephen Rao, an expert in the field of Cognitive Neuroimaging. “We have a lot of information that comes into our brains all the time, so we have to make decisions over what is important and what isn’t.\n\n“Our brains like repetition, particularly when it comes to music. We also have a psychological connection to music in general – particularly when it comes to songs of the past.”\n\nSounds good to me. Ok, gotta run. Let’s see now. Where did I put my keys?\n\nTed Buss is a former TRN sports and business editor and author of three books."
