        "text": "Those of us who remember Joe DiMaggio\n\nas the Yankee Clipper and not Mr. Coffee remember his peerless style and grace,\n\nthe 56-game hitting streak, the summer of '41 and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nBut the man behind the heroic myth\n\nwas quite different. The private DiMaggio was untrusting and distant, greedy\n\nand arrogant, unforgiving and petty, according to an unauthorized biography\n\npublished soon after DiMaggio's death in 1999. And though longtime DiMaggio\n\nconfidant Morris Engelberg and Associated Press sportswriter Marv Schneider\n\nreportedly aim to set the record straight, as the title suggests, what they\n\nactually do is set that unflattering image in stone.\n\nAuthor Richard Ben Cramer, in his\n\n2000 biography ''Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life,'' publicly laid bare DiMaggio's\n\nfaults, which were already well known in some baseball circles. But Cramer also\n\ntook some shots at Engelberg, a Hollywood attorney who handled most of DiMaggio's\n\nbusiness and personal affairs for the last 16 years of his life.\n\nCramer's claims that Engelberg sold\n\nsigned memorabilia behind DiMaggio's back are vehemently denied by Engelberg.\n\nAs a result, ''Setting the Record Straight'' devotes just 60 pages to the Yankee\n\nClipper's baseball career and only one chapter to Monroe -- she had a big rear\n\nend and hair on her arms, DiMaggio told Engelberg -- while the tedious details\n\nof memorabilia shows and autograph signings are given far too much space.\n\nBut what makes this book special\n\nis the access Engelberg had to DiMaggio's private life, including a diary the\n\nformer ballplayer meticulously maintained. And although Engelberg recalls examples\n\nof DiMaggio's charity and how his larger-than-life persona affected others,\n\nhe also shows DiMaggio going out of his way to belittle some people and humiliate\n\nothers, including two presidents.\n\nDiMaggio refused several entreaties\n\nfrom Bill Clinton and hated the Kennedys because he was convinced they had a\n\nrole in Monroe's death. And though he liked Ronald Reagan, he basically ignored\n\nthe former president and his wife, Nancy, when the Reagans called out to him\n\nin a crowded Los Angeles restaurant.\n\nThe DiMaggio Engelberg describes\n\nwas often mean, and he got away with it because of who he was. In 1998, for\n\nexample, the Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame held a black-tie banquet to\n\ncelebrate the unveiling of a DiMaggio statue, an event made possible by Hall\n\nleader George Randazzo, who had been the target of DiMaggio slights for two\n\ndecades. On the night of the dinner, DiMaggio seemed in a good mood, so Randazzo\n\nasked him to sign the place cards of the celebrities at the head table. When\n\nDiMaggio got to Randazzo's, he looked at the card and said, ''The train stops\n\nhere,'' and refused to sign.\n\nAlthough he was worth tens of millions\n\nof dollars, DiMaggio never picked up a restaurant check and once complained\n\nthat Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel never paid him for the use of his name in\n\ntheir hit song ''Mrs. Robinson.'' He was famous for showing up at celebrity\n\ngolf tournaments without his clubs, forcing sponsors to supply him with a new\n\nset. And he rarely left without the TVs or electric razors they gave out as\n\nprizes.\n\n''Setting the Record Straight''\n\nis an unflattering portrait of an American hero and one that leaves you with\n\nadmiration and scorn for its author. While Engelberg's devotion to the truth\n\nis commendable, his book also removes the veil from one of the most private\n\nof men, forever altering the way he'll be remembered. Where have you gone, Joe\n\nDiMaggio?\n\nPHOTO: DIMAGGIO: SETTING THE RECORD\n\nSTRAIGHT' by Morris Engelberg and Marv Schneider; MBI ($24.95."
