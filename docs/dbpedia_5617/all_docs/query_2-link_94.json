        "text": "No one believed 11-year-old Bettina Anderson when she told her teachers at Palm Beach Day School she was having lunch that day with Joe DiMaggio.\n\n\"We were like, `Yeah, right . . . ,''' recalled Neal Piltch, head of the private school's upper campus.\n\nA few hours later, as 300 students were about to change afternoon classes, a station wagon pulled up to the Seaview Avenue entrance. A door opened. A white-haired man who must have looked like a chauffeur got out and opened another door. Out came little Bettina, who shook the man's hand and headed back to her fifth-grade classes that day last June.\n\nRight about then, Piltch happened to walk by. For Piltch - a diehard Boston Red Sox fan who grew up a few blocks from Fenway Park hating the New York Yankees - there was no mistaking the white-haired man waving goodbye to Bettina.\n\n\"I can't believe it,'' he thought to himself, just as confirmation cried out from another teacher: \"There's Joe DiMaggio.''\n\nAnd upon hearing his name, the Yankee Clipper looked up and waved to the gathering crowd. Then, he disappeared like a mirage as the station wagon drove away.\n\nDiMaggio died Monday after battling lung cancer. He was 84.\n\nThe kind of buzz he could create, simply by showing up at a prep school nearly 50 years after taking his last swing for the Yankees, was ageless. It's a testament to the mythic-like appeal that surrounded the man who hit safely in 56 straight games, led New York to nine World Series championships, married Marilyn Monroe and became television's Mr. Coffee.\n\nIt's an image DiMaggio meticulously crafted, always carefully choosing where to live, whom to socialize with and which appearances to make.\n\nIn 1985, with most of his family in his native San Francisco dead, DiMaggio moved to Florida. He was no stranger to the state.\n\nThe Yankees trained in St. Petersburg, where he was treated in 1945 at the Army Hospital for stomach ulcers.\n\nAnd he helped make famous the old Tides Hotel & Beach Club in Tampa simply by walking along its beach front with Monroe in 1961.\n\nBut DiMaggio chose Florida as his home because of his arthritis and his passions - sun, water and children, said attorney Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio'snext-door neighbor.\n\nDominic DiMaggio - a talented outfielder for Red Sox who would have been more famous were it not for his Yankee brother - lives in Ocean Ridge. And a cousin, Joe DiMaggio, lives in Boynton Beach.\n\nThe famous Joe DiMaggio first lived briefly at Boca Teeca Country Club in Boca Raton in 1985 before moving to Miami Beach and then to Hollywood, where since 1996 he lived alone in the exclusive Harbour Island community.\n\nOnce in a while he drove his Toyota Corolla to Palm Beach for dinner, business meetings or a rare appearance at a charity.\n\n\"He didn't like to mix with the Palm Beach social set,'' said Jesse Newman, director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. \"You can never get that close to a man like Joe DiMaggio unless of course you were his neighbor, like Morris Engelberg.''\n\nEngelberg, a tax attorney with clients on Palm Beach, described his old friend as \"a shy, meticulous man'' who cooked for himself, pumped his own gas and shined his own shoes.\n\nAmong DiMaggio's favorite mementoes in his waterfront home at Harbour Island was a framed picture of the 1936 Yankees - the best of his nine World Series teams. With a 102-51 record, they won the American League pennant by 19 games and took the Series from the New York Giants in six games.\n\nSix players from that team have been voted into the Hall of Fame: first baseman Lou Gehrig, catcher Bill Dickey, second baseman Tony Lazzeri, pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez, and DiMaggio.\n\nIn Florida, the Yankee Clipper is perhaps best known for the Joe DiMaggioChildren's Hospital (part of the hospital where he was treated for cancer). Its motto is \"Whether rich or poor, no child is turned away.''\n\nDiMaggio was approached by Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood about lending his name to a 144-bed unit on the fourth floor. Just before a ribbon-cutting ceremony in 1992, DiMaggio said: \"I am impressed by what this hospital stands for. Rich or poor children will be treated here and I'm going to be right here making sure of that.'' Then, as DiMaggio made the rounds with as many young patients as he could, some children treated him to a rendition of Take Me Out to the Ballgame.\n\n\"I love these little guys, I really do,'' DiMaggio said at the 1996 dedication of the hospital's pediatric emergency room. \"I have grandchildren and I now have great-grandchildren. I know the pains we all have to go through in watching over them.''\n\nA display case in the hospital's lobby is filled with baseball collectibles, including a bat signed by DiMaggio, saying, \"To all the children at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital - a speedy recovery.''\n\nDiMaggio's world was a private one, so secluded that some local associates described him as \"kind of a recluse.''\n\nBut if he let you in, others say, he was like a best friend. Especially if you happened to be a kid.\n\n\"He acted like my daughter was princess for the day,'' recalled Palm Beach National Bank President Loy Anderson, who is DiMaggio's banker and who accompanied his daughter to that lunch with the baseball legend at the chic eatery Amici.\n\n\"All during the meal people are coming up to him and asking for his autograph. Joe would graciously say, `Of course.' He'd get up from his meal to have his picture taken. I asked him, `Doesn't this bother you?' He said something like `I guess this is the price you pay for being famous,' '' Anderson said.\n\nAnytime he ventured into public - whether for pasta at Cafe L'Europe on Palm Beach or seafood at Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach - the response to a Joe DiMaggio arrival always was the same.\n\n\"It's like the parting of the Red Sea when he comes in. The crowds just open up and he walks through,'' Anderson said.\n\nPeople rushed to get DiMaggio's autograph, and one kid asked Hemingway, \"You're someone, too, right?'' Hemingway replied: \"I'm his doctor.''\n\nA few hours before the Florida Marlins' inaugural game on April 5, 1993, a large crowd that had been milling in front of Joe Robbie Stadium suddenly broke into applause. Joe DiMaggio had just stepped out of a limo.\n\nThe man whose career spanned from Lou Gehrig to Mickey Mantle had arrived to christen the Marlins baseball franchise that day by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. That same day, the Marlins retired his uniform No. 5. Both ceremonies were arranged to honor not DiMaggio but the late Carl Barger, the Marlins' first president who idolized DiMaggio.\n\nNot long after Florida was granted the Marlins franchise, DiMaggio told a reporter in Miami: \"I think it's great for the city, but you're going to see watered-down baseball.''\n\nHe was a Marlins season-ticket holder, with seats nine rows off the third-base line. The last Marlins game he attended was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, when Florida captured the championship with a come-from-behind win.\n\n\"Joe probably had, to me - and I've been broadcasting for 50 years, the biggest mystique of anyone I knew,'' said Hall of Fame broadcaster Curt Gowdy of Palm Beach.\n\n\"He never said much but he played the game so great,'' said Gowdy, who added DiMaggio once told him he wanted to be remembered as the greatest player ever.\n\nGowdy recalled how DiMaggio took batting practice late one season after the Yankees already had clinched a pennant. \"Some writer was talking to him and said, `Joe, why are you taking a chance at getting hurt before the World Series?'\n\n\"And he replied, `Because there might be somebody in the stands who's never seen me play.'
