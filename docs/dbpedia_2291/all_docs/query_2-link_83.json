And through stories and pictures told and shown to me by my parents and grandparents of those others whom I did not know I have learned to appreciate them more. Of these who are members of the Church whether by birth or conversion it may be truly said that they were tried and trusted spirits in their pre mortal life. Many there, we believe hold important positions of leadership. From the test they experienced they emerged triumphant. Because of their faithfulness they were accounted worthy to bear in life great responsibilities and were reserved in training until a day came in earth's history when the very staunchest and bravest were needed. With the dawning of this last gospel dispensation come their call to journey earthward and perform the special mission for which they were qualified by character and experience.\n\nAll my Grandparents and Great grandparents were pioneers and remained true to their convictions which they had in spite of hardship and persecutions. Among those Pioneer ancestors was my Great Grandmother Mary Ann Barker Virgin. She was born July 25, 1831. at Marston Bedfordshire, England, a daughter of Thomas Barker and Elisabeth Thompson Barker.\n\nAt the age of six she learned the art of making Valencino, or pillow lace as she called it. This lace she sold on the marketplace to help support the family. She was once honored by being asked to make lace sleeves for a dress for Queen Victoria.\n\nOn September 19, 1852, she married George Thompson Virgin, son of Samuel Virgin and Mary Keep at the Parish Church in the Parish of Marston in Bedford County. They made their first home there,\n\nTheir oldest son Amos Moses (my grandfather) was born January 23, 1854 at Marston Bedford England. One day Great Grandfather heard the Mormon missionaries holding a street meeting and was convinced that what they were preaching was true. He told his wife this but she refused to listen. A few days later she was at the market place trying to sell her lace when she heard the missionaries preaching. She stayed until they were through. So pleased was she with what she had learned that she consented when her husband asked if he might bring the missionaries to their home. She told her sister Mercy Keetch all that had Happened and asked her to come to their home when the Elders made their visit,\n\nThen she and her sister fasted and prayed that the Elders would be led by the spirit of God if it was His work they were preaching, to explain certain principles of the Gospel which they did not understand, great Grandfather invited Milo Andrus to their home one afternoon. He had chosen a text which was not what they had had been praying he would use. But still they waited, He talked on for a few minutes then turning to them he said I thought I would speak on that subject today but it seems I wasn't supposed to. Then he began talking on the very subject they had been praying he would use. That was all that they needed to convince them that what he was preaching was true. Great grandfather, Great Grandmother and her sister Mercy Keetch were baptized on August 13, 1854.\n\nAfter Great Grandfather and Grandmother had joined the Church their persecution began. He lost his job just as soon it was learned that he had joined the despised Mormons. Their friends turned against them and they were forced to move from place to place trying to make a living, and get money enough to come to Zion. In the course of their travels they lived at Wootton Bedfordshire England where their second son Nephi Charles, was born on October 6, 1857. Their third son Heber George Thompston Virgin was born at Kempston also in Bedfordshire on February 10,1859,\n\nDuring this time they faithfully paid their tithing and donated to the Church Immigration fund to assist others in going to Zion. He finally secured a job with a construction crew on the railroad. All the men on the crew knew that he was a Mormon and they tried in every way to get him to give up his religion. One night Great Grandmother had a dream that the train ran over her husband and that the workmen brought his mangled body to her doorstep in a basket. Then one of them knocked, when she came to the door he said \"here is your Mormon husband\", So vivid was her dream that she awakened her husband and told him about it and begged him not to go to work. He told her that if he did not go then they would have on excuse to fire him and that he couldn't afford to loose his job, as they needed to money so badly. She told him when he went to work that morning that she would never see him alive again. Her dream in part came true that very day for they were working in a long narrow train tunnel with just little safety holes in the wall for the workmen to step into while a train was passing. A long freight train passed, he stepped out of the safety hole to resume his work when without notice the train backed back, a thing it had never been known to do there before, running over him. He was carried out of the tunnel by the other workmen. One of them asked him what he thought of his religion now. He replied, \"That was my greatest possession in life and in death it is still my greatest possession. \"He died a few minutes later on December 30th, 1861 at Birmingham England. Thus had he had given his all even his life for the religion he so much prized,\n\nPrompted by this same spirit Great Grandmother refused ease and luxury in her native land to accept hardship and privation with a people then despised and persecuted. For shortly after her husbands death a Baptist Minster came and offered to clothe, educate and care for the boys and to give her every luxury her heart would desire if she would renounce Mormonism. She refused saying that her religion was her life,\n\nThe death of her Husband was a sore trial coming as it did just ten days after the birth of their daughter Mary Ann. But rising, to the full strength of her great womanhood she became both father and mother to her little family. Hers was the problem of supplying food, clothing, and shelter for herself and a brood of three. Her youngest son, having died just a short time before the death of his Father on August 25th, 1860.\n\nIt required great strength of character and purpose to endure with unshaken faith the persecution that preceded and followed her husband's death. And to finally start with her three small children on that long difficult journey across ocean plain and wilderness to a new and unknown land alone among strangers. We can imagine her heartache, a young woman barely thirty years age with three small children and no friend or companion to share her responsibilities. She had supreme faith, however that she would reach her destination and be able to make a home for herself and her little family among a people who believed in allowing everyone to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. Her faith is shown in the sacrifices she made in caring for the Elders in England, often giving her last crumb of bread to feed them. Many times she had to send her children to bed with no supper and then set up all night to finish a piece of lace to sell in order to buy their breakfast.\n\nShe wasn't content until she had taken the step that had started her on her way to Zion. She started out from Liverpool on the ship William Tapscott on May 14th, 1862. The company was under the direction of William Gibson, John Clark and Frances M. Lyman. In the company were 808 saints. After better than nine weeks traveling landed safely in New York. These facts are verified in Church chronology by Andrew Jenson.\n\nWhatever else may be said of these brave pioneer companies they furnish intensely pathetic and tragic material for history. However such we honor the first company of pioneers. That journey does not fire the imagination, as do some of the later companies. In the main, that group was made of hardy courageous men particularly fitted for such an expedition. Their equipment considering the times was of the best. Vigorous men, good teams strong weapons. But the companies who were to follow were poorly fitted out. They were composed of many frail women and children and their equipment was not of the best, The first companies of Saints had been hardened to frontier life by the journey to Winter Quarters and the years spent there,\n\nIt was in one of these later companies that Great Grandmother and Grandfather came to Utah. The boys had to walk the entire distance across the plains, even though they were just children. Grandfather says he only remembered getting a ride once. He said that he had walked one day until he began getting very tired very tired And he knew that Nephi was getting tired to A kind man noticed them and beckoned them to come to where he was. Then he lifted the flap on the back of a wagon. Lifted each of them in and told them to be quiet. They had only rode for a few minutes when someone noticed they were riding and had them walk again. As the wagons were loaded so heavily that just the added burden of their weight made it difficult for the tired horse to pull their load.\n\nThose journeys across the plains were journeys, which we of this generation can hardly imagine. The suffering and hardships they went through for the sake of their religion should make us proud of it as well as doubly proud of such ancestors who would go through so much suffering and hardship for its sake. The full extent of their suffering, fortitude and heroism will never be told. They sometimes were able to make ten to fifteen miles a day and some days only two or three. , They did not have nearly enough food and as the lack of proper nourishment began to tell upon their systems they became more and more susceptible to illness and diseases. , Sometimes they walked all day long in a heavy down pour of rain, because it was better to keep moving than to try to camp in the rain with no protection as they had very few tents. So most of them slept under the wagons. Sometimes their clothes were not dry for days at a time is it any wonder that they became ill and that the plains were dotted with their graves, Great Grandmother became ill from constant exposure, and the hardship of the journey. For days she lay, too ill to care for her tiny baby. It was then that the people of the company took the children in charge and took care of then. The weather and exposure and all proved to be too much for the baby girl, and on October 6, 1862 site died, Great Grandmother at the time was so ill that she did not realize that the baby had died. A young man by the name of by the name of Ephriam Barton, who had assisted Grandmother in caring for the children often carrying the baby for miles in his arms, died the same night. A crude grave was dug not far from the wayside. There were no flowers, nor any coffin. A hymn was sung, a prayer offered and a few words spoken then they were placed in a blanket and buried together, he with the baby on his arm. A fire was lighted to keep the animals away from the grave.\n\nGrandmother lay for days until they thought she would die before she reached her destination. But she had extreme faith and a will to live and gradually she regained her strength. Until in time she was able to leave her bed. But her illness left her with the rheumatism so badly that for weeks she could not walk.\n\nThe company arrived in Utah in the fall of 1862. Great-grandmother ant the boys settled in Granstville in Thoile County. By the time they reached Utah most of their provisions were gone. So she and the boys went into the fields and gathered the heads of wheat, She had rheumatism so badly that she had to crawl on her hands and knees, They gathered between them enough grain to make five sacks of flour. One of these she gave for tithing and the rest kept for flour to feed her family during the first winter. ,\n\nThey remained In Granstville for two years then she moved with her family to St Charles Idaho where she lived until 19W when she moved to Salem Idaho with her Grandson Nephi Charles Virgin Jr. and his family. She had raised her Grandson from his Infancy, Her son Nephi and his family came to Salem with them but she spent the rest of her life with her Grandson she was ever a faithful Church work having been a counselor and a teacher in the Relief society for a number of years and a Sunday School teacher. Her testimony never faltered Her last words to her Grandchildren were \"Be faithful serve the Lord and teach your children to do right. She died at Salem Idaho Jan. 14, 1921 at the age of ninety years.\n\nAt the time of her death she was survived by one son Amos Moses (her other son Nephi Charles having died March 20, 1917) 16 grandchildren 67 great grandchildren 2 great great grandchildren and three sister Internment was in the Sugar-City Cemetery.\n\nGrandfather Amos Moses Virgin grew to manhood with that same abiding faith exemplified by his dear parents. In his very early youth he acquired a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel, having been himself baptized in England in Birmingham Warwickshire on May 8, 1862. He was confirmed the same day. Though it was not his privilege to defend his religion in the mission fields of the world. Yet he never failed to raise his voice in its defense whenever an occasion arose, five of his Grandsons and three of his Sons-in-law have filled missions for the church. He taught a Sunday school class for a number of years and always taught his family by example as well as by precept the value of a clean life. He lived the word of Wisdom strictly and taught his children and his grandchildren to do likewise. He had as a youth a knowledge of the truthfulness of the gospel for which his Father's life had been taken and his mother had suffered untold hardships, But even as a boy he found It necessary to help earn a living, for himself his younger brother and his widowed mother. This he did by trapping and fishing. , He was always very careful about skinning and taking care of the pelts so that they were always considered prime pelts. These he shipped to Chicago and New York thus getting the full market price for them. Bear Lake valley at that time was rich in wild game and the Lake was full of fish. These he caught and shipped into Wyoming. He also herded sheep as a young man and did anything that he could do to earn an honest living, He, when he was yet a comparatively young man built his mother a home equal to any in the community at that time. His religion was ever uppermost in his mind as evidenced by the fact that he was ordained to the various offices in the priesthood. He was ordained an Elder September 27, 1875, a Seventy July 18, 1886 a High Priest May 1, 1909,\n\nSeptember 27, 1875 he married Sarah Frances Merkley, a daughter of Christopher and Xarissa Fairbanks Merkley who were also early pioneer converts to the Church. They were married in t he old Endowment House in Salt Lake City. They made their first home in St, Charles Idaho. They learned the truthfulness, through experience, of the statement\n\nThey say life is a highways,\n\nAnd its milestones ' are the years,\n\nAnd now and then there's a tollgate\n\nWhere you pay your way with tears.\n\nIt's a rough road, and a steep road\n\nAnd it stretches broad and far,\n\nBut it leads at last to a golden town\n\nWhere golden houses are.\n\n(Joyce Kilmer)\n\nThey became the parents of ten children eight girls and two boys\n\nSarah France* Eugenie\n\nAlice Xarissa Jessie\n\nLinda Rose Zalia Louise\n\nMary Ann (my Mother) Alicia Naomi\n\nGeorge Amos Heber Harold\n\nAs each child came to bless their home it brought with it added responsibilities which children always bring. But they enjoyed their children and loved each one that came as much as they did the first. Each one was taught the Principles of the Gospel. and each one was taught his responsibilities to the rest of the family and to their Church and Nation. They each learned to assist their Father in field as well as their mother in the home. There was work to do for all and they all helped. There-were vegetables and fruits to be gathered in summer, wild strawberries, native currents choke cherries and serviceberries to be brought from the canyon. This they turned into an occasion for a family picnic. , They would take wagons and teems then they would bundle in the whole family grandmothers sisters and any friends that cared to come along. They took food enough along to last for a couple of days. Sometimes they would stay all night and have a camping party and sometimes they would return the same day. This fruit had to be dried and canned, along with fish and wild game brought home by Grandfather. Then there was baking, cooking and housecleaning, and a never-ending job of sewing for so-many little girls. Rags were converted into rugs for the floor pieces of new cloth were made into quilts, then wool had to be clipped from the sheep carded and made into bats for the quilts, So there was a job for everyone.\n\nBut their lives were not all work. These household chores were varied with pleasurable activities as well, for their home was always a meeting place for young and old folk alike. Where they met and had many a good time. Grandfather had a beautiful tenor voice; he sang in the church choir for a number of years, after choir practice the members would often go to his home and enjoy the rest of the evening dancing. He played the violin, the Jews harp, the harmonica and the organ some. He was often called on to entertain at gatherings with his violin. He was a beautiful dancer and he called for the square dances all over the valley. He was a beautiful skater. He spent a great deal of his time on his skates because much of his time was spent hunting and trapping along the lakes and little streams. His brother always accompanied him on his hunting trips.\n\nEven though much of their time was taken up with the task of securing a living for themselves and their family. They were not too busy to look after the educational and social side of their life. Night school was hold in their home for a number of years for the young and old & alike. A man by the name of Alma Larson was the teacher. Besides reaching them the fundamentals of reading writing and arithmetic, he also taught them drama and elocution. They had great fun with the plays they put on.\n\nTheir first great sorrow came with the death of their daughter Linda Rose on August 6th, 1882. In October 1899, they moved with their family to Salem Idaho where they helped in the early building of the Snake River Valley. Grandfather's brother Nephi lived near him in St. Charles and when they moved to the Snake River Valley they bought farms just about two and a half miles apart, They always worked and \"played\" together until Nephi was called home on March 20, 1917,\n\nOn August 19th, 1903 the angel of death called again at their home taking George. He was eighteen, just old enough ' to ease his Fathers burden on the farm. But they took his death with true pioneer spirit and the attitude that \"It is God's will,\"\n\nOne by one the girls married. Each exemplifying, the teachings given to them by their parents, marrying worthy men, each in the Temple of the Lord.\n\nShortly after coming to Salem Grandmother had the misfortune to break her ankle. Because there was no Doctor available it was never properly set. This caused her to be a cripple the rest of her life. Put she never complained. She always did her, work and cared for a large house and helped to raise a number of her grand children after her own family had been raised. Their youngest son Harold married on October 30. 1918,, and brought his wife to live with his parents. They became parents of seven children whom Grandmother assisted in caring for. They continued to live with her for seventeen years. Then they bought then a home in Aberdeen Idaho. They moved there in February 1935. On August 14, 1935 Harold met with an accident which caused his death. This was but one more of the sorrows they had to bear. They had buried their daughter Jessie on February 6, 1928. -She left a family of six young children. It seemed as though Harold's was the hardest blow of all as they had learned to depend on him more and more as the years crept on them. Their health from then on began failing rapidly. Just a short time before Harold's death Grandfather had an accident, which caused him to go partially blind. He could no longer see to read his Bible, which had been a source of comfort and strength to him for so many years. It was then that he depended upon Grandmother more and more. She found time to read to him each day. Their life was not all sorrows, however. They had many happy experiences. They loved to meet and enjoy the company of their children and grand children. They had many family gatherings and reunions. On Grandfather's birthday it was always an occasion for a family get together. Both his immediate family, his mother, his brother and his family always came to these gatherings. The family took many trips into the hills on picnics. Several times they went to the Hot Springs in the hills. Grandfather could swim beautifully and taught many of his grandchildren to swim. Many are the Christmases they spent being host to their children and grandchildren, some of my earliest and happiest recollections were times I went to Grandfather and Grandmothers. I can see yet that long table set with her best china. The pretty red and white sugar bowl and cream pitcher and the large-footed fruit bowl in the center of the table. As a child I thought that no one ever cooked as good testing meals as Grandmother.\n\nAmong the occasions never to be forgotten was their Golden Wedding anniversary, September 27, 1925. The family- by that time was getting so large that they could not all meet comfortably in Grandmother's home. So they decided to hire the Salem Amusement Hall for their party. This they held in the afternoon, The girls had prepared the dinner. Then they set long tables in the hall. While we ate they had a program. Among the things that stand out in my memory about the program was Grandfather playing his violin, Cousin Charley playing the harmonicas, Uncle Harold singing. Uncle Hense Hansen making the presentation speech when the family presented Grandfather and Grandmother each with a golden wedding band and a comfortable rocking chair. Aunt Jessie playing the piano for all the granddaughters to sing, Father-step dancing. After the dinner. tables were cleared away and the rest of the day was spent in dancing.\n\nAgain on their sixtieth anniversary the party was held in the hall. This party was attended by all of the family. They came from as far as Lake City, Fish Haven, Ogden and Aberdeen. The happiness of this occasion was marred somewhat by the absence of several members of the family who had been called home since their fiftieth anniversary. Among them Aunt Jessie, Cousin Charley, Uncle John Long and Uncle Harold. This was the last party of this kind to be held and will long be remembered.\n\nGrandmother had an education superior to many women of her day. She had attended school for years, to say nothing of the wealth of knowledge she had acquired by experience. She loved music, art and literature. She had many accomplishments. Besides being a wonderful cook she was a beautiful seamstress. Her father, having brought the second sewing machine into Salt Lake Valley. She could crochet, tat, and knit. make hair pin lace and netting. She won first place one year at the Fair for her handiwork. She never sat idle. When she had worked until it was necessary that she rest she always had her fancy work in her hands. She loved to make quilts and made many of them. She used to exhibit with pride a quilt-block she had made when she was four years old. Many of her children and grandchildren are the proud possessors of some of her handiwork. It was my privilege to finish after her death, a piece of lace she was making for a granddaughter for Christmas. She had worked on it just a few hours before her death and needed just a few more scallops to finish it, Then I was given her crochet hook, which I, prize very much. She had made lace aprons for all of her daughters for Christmas and had bought cards for all of her grandchildren when she was called home. She loved flowers and always had her windows as well as her yard full of them. Every one in the neighborhood enjoyed \"Sister Virgin's\" flowers. She loved the beauties of mountains, skies and streams. Just an hour before her death she walked in the moonlight with one of her daughters and remarked about what a beautiful night it was, and how beautiful the stars were. Her life was always spent in the service of others. One day\n\nGrandfather took sick. She sent word to her daughters that he was seriously sick. Then she stayed at his bedsides, refusing to lie down even until almost midnight. When her daughters insisted that she got some rest. She lay down at his side on the bed and asked him if it would help to rub him and where his pain was now. He took her hand and laid it over his chest saying that was where his pain was. The girls left the room then, thinking they would both go to sleep. A few minutes later they heard a slight noise and thinking it was Grandfather who wanted something, one of them stepped back into the room, turned on the light and there lay Grandmother peaceful in death, with her hand still on his chest. She died December 17, 1938 at the home of her youngest daughter in Fish Haven Idaho.\n\nWe will always remember Grandmother Dear\n\nPatient, Faithful through the years,\n\nToil stamped her brow with furrows\n\nEtched windows in her souls\n\nLittle lights of inspiration\n\nShowing faith had been her goal.\n\n'And the glory of her presence\n\nJust the sunshine of her smile\n\nBrought to us the joy of living\n\n'When we talked with her awhile,\n\nThe thoughts that thronged her memory\n\nWere triumphant deeds of right\n\nBraving pain and death and sorrow,\n\nServing others her delight.\n\nGained she wealth of knowledge\n\nSolid practical and true\n\n'Till her powers of discernment\n\n'Were excelled by very few.\n\nIn the realms of higher glory\n\nShe will mingle with the best\n\nIn the presence of her Maker\n\nMay she find eternal rest*\n\nAfter Grandmother's death, Grandfather still was critically ill. The Doctor gave them no hopes that he would live. Stating that in less than twenty-four hours his mission on earth would be completed so that they might rest in peace together. But even though he was very ill he gradually regained his strength of body until in time he was able to leave his bed. Heavenly Father in his mercy blotted out much of the past sufferings and sorrows from his mind so that his remaining years were spent in pleasant reminisces of his early married life and his fishing, and hunting trips when he was a young man. His violin was his main source of comfort after he could no longer see to get about and Grandmother was no longer there to aid to him, He died peacefully October 12, l942 at Fish Haven, Idaho at the age of 88. How fitting that they should spend their last days, and now lie side by side not far from the spot where they had commenced married life together 67 years before. To this union have been born 10 children, 67 grandchildren and 89 great grandchildren.\n\nHe had no wealth of bonds and gold,\n\nAs wealth today we score\n\nThat he had wealth and wealth untold,\n\nFor he had friends galore\n\nMay we be sure and always blessed\n\nToil worn hands that are now at rest\n\nMay we their sacred memory keep\n\nThey sowed in want that we might reap.\n\nTo the faith they loved let us be true\n\nDoing the things they would have us do,\n\nTheir-life a lesson for us stands\n\nAnd now they rest their weary hands\n\nMay they find peace that they sought in vain\n\nSince God has taken them home again,\n\nDescendants of the pioneer band\n\nThank God for your ancestors' grand\n\nRaise your eyes to the skies of blue\n\nAnd vow that- you will e'er be true\n\nTo the heritage handed down to you\n\nFrom these noble pioneers.\n\nFor questions about this web page please email webmaster: Paul Brown at [email protected]"
