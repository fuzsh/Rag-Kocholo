        "text": "Our store buys, sells, and trades used, out-of-print, and rare LDS books. The titles listed here are some of the many we are currently buying (these are not books we have for sale). Because our wants change frequently, there may be titles listed here we no longer need and cannot buy. The list will be updated periodically to stay as current as possible.\n\nPrices paid for books depend on such factors as condition, edition, past sales history, rarity, and demand. Some of these out-of-print books have a resale value of only a few dollars while others are worth much more. After personally examining the books and evaluating them according to the above criteria, we will offer a fair price for the books we think we can re-sell. We cannot determine value or make specific offers over the phone without first having seen the books.\n\nPlease call and ask for the buyer (801-486-3111) to make an appointment to bring in books or to ask questions about books you have to sell. If possible, please come on Friday.\n\nRecent Requests – June 11, 2024\n\nBolded numbers after each title represent CASH/STORE CREDIT amounts\n\nUnderlined titles are those most recently added\n\nItalicized titles are from the last list that we’re still searching for\n\n1st & 2nd Samuel: Anchor Bible (McCarter) – 5/8 each\n\n75 Questions & Answers about Preparing for the Temple (Gaskill) – 3/5\n\n8 Myths of the Great Apostasy (McHardy) – 3/5\n\n101 Powerful Promises from the Latter-day Prophets (Brickey) – 3/5\n\n250 Fascinating Facts about LDS Temples pb (Pitts) – 3/5\n\n1851 Mormon Trail Emigration and Captain Morris Phelps (Bruce R.
