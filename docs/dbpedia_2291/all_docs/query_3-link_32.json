        "text": "By DAVID LYLE WOOD\n\nMarried for less than a year and pregnant, twenty-year-old Phoebe Perry Vincent joined the 1861 Milo Andrus wagon train bound for Utah—without her husband. On August 3, when she gave birth to a son near Chimney Rock, her spouse was still absent; nor was the father on hand when, at Independence Rock, the child received a name (Milo C. Beck) and a priesthood blessing. 1 Phoebe was by no means alone in her loneliness, however. That summer, other wayfaring women—married and single—were likewise toiling westward without their men. Though these were not the first members of the fair sex to cross the American plains singly (nor would they be the last), the reason for their seeming abandonment was new. Where were the men? What caused their separation from wives and families?\n\nPhoebe Perry Vincent and her husband John were Mormon convertemigrants from England. Like many of their co-religionists they were en route to Salt The Salt Lake City Telegraph Lake City—Zion to them. Lacking funds Office. needed to continue the journey beyond Florence, in Nebraska Territory, John got a job—one that enabled him and his wife to reach their destination, though by divergent routes. He and other Mormon immigrant men helped build the first transcontinental telegraph line.\n\nThe idea of transmitting electronic messages via wire was not new. It had been around since the late eighteenth century and various individuals, some in Europe and some in the United States, had conducted numerous experiments and had developed a variety of devices and codes; but it was not until May 24,1844, that inter-city telegraphic communication became practical. On this day Samuel F. B. Morse seated himself at a table in the Supreme Court Chamber of the U. S. national capitol and tapped out “What hath God wrought.” Then, after moments of suspense-filled silence, Morse’s receiving apparatus began to chatter, recording the exact same message as it came back from Baltimore, Maryland, forty miles away. 2\n\nFrom that day forward the telegraph spread, slowly at first but with accelerating speed, and by the end of 1846 privately owned wires linked Philadelphia with Pittsburgh. By September of the next year Pittsburgh could communicate with Louisville, Kentucky, via Zanesville, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Three months later the telegraph reached Vincennes, Indiana, and ten days after that it was on the east bank of the Mississippi River. Feeder lines soon appeared, such as that between Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1852. 3\n\nMeanwhile, the St. Louis New Era newspaper, in 1848, proposed a visionary plan: “A streak of lightning ought to be established to form an instantaneous and constant communication between St. Louis and the Coast of the Pacific.” 4 In 1850 Amos Kendall (a former U. S. Postmaster General, now deeply involved in telegraph construction as an entrepreneur), was contemplating the establishment of “a line of Electro-Magnetic Telegraph to the City of the Saints.”5 Hiram Sibley, president of Western Union Company, repeatedly proposed building a telegraph line to the Pacific, but his board of directors would not approve. Sibley then approached the North American Telegraph Association; again he found little support. Private entities were not willing to take such a big risk.\n\nA telegraph through vast unsettled regions required government support. In 1852 Henry O’Rielly, an avid telegraph builder, and Illinois Senator Stephan A. Douglas petitioned Congress for a transcontinental line, but without success.6 Again, in 1857-58 during the Utah War, O’Rielly and others talked about building a telegraph line for use by the U. S. Army in its efforts to subdue the Mormons who, according to O’Rielly, were “resolved on maintaining their rocky fastness.”7\n\nBut the Mormons too wanted an electrical link with the outside world. In January 1853, the Utah Territorial Legislature appealed to the United States Congress for a telegraph connection. “No movement of Congress,” read the petition, “could be better calculated to preserve inviolable our glorious Union than to bind the East and West by an Electric stream whereby intelligence and instantaneous intercourse from the eastern to the western limits of our wide-spread country will annihilate the distance, and make free men of Maine and Oregon, Florida and California immediate neighbors.” 8\n\nWork on a telegraph wire running up the Missouri River from St. Louis to Kansas City, Missouri, had begun in 1850, but Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas did not have a connection until the spring of 1859. 9 Meanwhile, a line suspended on tall masts spanned the Mississippi. In 1860, a wire from Kansas City reached Omaha in Nebraska Territory and on June 16 Congress passed an act “to facilitate communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific States by electric telegraph.” 10\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Jacob Gates, agent in charge of Mormon overland travel, sent David Henry Cannon eastward to meet the year’s first group of English immigrants. Cannon led them from New York to Florence, Nebraska, via St. Joseph, Missouri, and Nebraska City. “Upon reaching Nebraska City,” wrote Cannon, “J. J. Creighton came on board the steamer and wanted to hire men to set telegraph poles from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City.…I told him that I did not have the right to contract with him to furnish the men.”11 Cannon did arrange for a meeting between Creighton and Gates, however.\n\nWho was J. J. Creighton, the labor recruiter? Was it John Andrew, Joseph, or James Creighton? All three of these men eventually were associated, in one way or another, with their brother—Edward Creighton—in building the first telegraph line to Salt Lake City. “J. J.” could not have been John Creighton, for he was in Denver, Colorado, from 1860 to 1861 and only belatedly joined the telegraph expedition at Fort Laramie. Joseph Creighton, on the other hand, is an unlikely recruiter, at least in the opinion of Charles H. Brown, Edward Creighton’s bookkeeper, paymaster and secretary, because Joseph “was lazy mentally and physically and so destitute of energy that he neither did nor could to [do] anything. He was a human sloth, yet everybody liked Joe—he was such a good hearted fellow.” Thus, “J. J.” must have been James Creighton a man, according to Brown, “who does his own business.” 12\n\nEdward Creighton was an experienced telegraph builder who had started out hauling poles; then he had helped establish lines between Dayton and Cincinnati, Toledo and Cleveland, and Toledo and Chicago. After moving to Nebraska Territory in 1856, he had built a telegraph from Omaha to St. Joseph, Missouri. “Ed,” as his workers “respectfully called him … and which he liked,” could be a “jolly” fellow at times, but more importantly, he was “a resolute, enterprising man,” who had “a great head” with “a great deal in it” and who “knew how to use it.” He was “a steam engine of energy and [had] wonderful powers of endurance.” 13\n\nIt was Edward Creighton who had made a preliminary survey of the proposed telegraph route to Salt Lake City in the fall of 1860.A letter from an anonymous Mormon missionary, published in a November issue of the Deseret News, announced: “the agent of the Pacific Telegraph Company,” (a subsidiary of Western Union), was “on his way to Utah and intermediate points for the purpose of making arrangements for putting up the poles and extending the line…and to ascertain at what point the line from California would meet that from the East—the whole to be completed next season.”14 Creighton arrived in Salt Lake City on December 14. On the twentieth he met with Brigham Young and, according to George A. Smith: “it is understood that he wants to get telegraph poles put up through this desert country for a distance of 500 miles.” 15\n\nLocal Mormon contractors would supply these timbers. John W. Young, one of Brigham’s sons, would be one of these. Likewise, Hamilton Gray Park, Brigham Young’s business manager, would be involved. The poles would come from Echo and Weber Canyons. 16\n\nIn 1861, Edward Creighton became superintendent of construction for the Pacific Telegraph Company responsible for building the line to Salt Lake City—a portion of what would become the first transcontinental telegraph. Throughout the summer he would constantly patrol up and down the telegraph line in a coach. 17\n\nIt is no wonder that Superintendent Creighton looked to Mormon immigrants for help. The newcomers were going to Utah anyway and, perhaps more importantly, the looming Civil War created a labor shortage in the United States. South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860, and other southern states soon followed. In February 1861, the seceded states met at Montgomery, Alabama, to form the Confederate States of America. On April 12, 1861, war began when Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor and thousands of American men enlisted on both sides. Furthermore, many Mormon newcomers were destitute of means and jumped at the chance to work their way west, while at the same time earning enough to fund their families’ continued pilgrimages to Zion.\n\nOn May 25, David H. Cannon and his party of Mormon emigrants arrived at Florence, Nebraska. The next day, Jacob Gates went to Omaha and it was probably then that he and Cannon met with Creighton. According to Cannon, he and Gates “went down and met [J.J. Creighton] at Omaha at the appointed time and arranged to furnish him 75 men. We arranged what the salaries of the men would be and that they [the men] were to be delivered in Salt Lake City not later than the 15th day of November. Half of the money that was to be paid these men was advanced to them to apply for the emigration of their families.” 18\n\nCharles H. Brown, the secretary, said that the Mormon emigrants who were hired at low wages, “yet they were the dearest laborers we had. They were from the cities and factory towns of England and had, with one or two exceptions, no adaptability to the work they were to do. They could not learn to be handy drivers of oxen, nor to do well and with ease the kind of work for which they were employed.” 19 Before the summer was over, Brown would modify his assessment. 20\n\nNo complete roster of the Creighton brother’s Mormon employees has yet been discovered, but a few of their names are known. In his autobiographical sketch, Charles Lock Rogers, a nineteen-year old Mormon convert from St. Pancras, London, Middlesex, England, and who had just crossed the Atlantic aboard the ship Underwriter, wrote: “by the spring of 1861 I had, by close living, saved enough to bring myself and wife, J. [Jane] Moss, as far as Florence. I sent my wife on to S. L. Valley by Captain Jonsons train [Sixtus E. Johnson Company], I joined the telegraph company that was being built that year...we arrived in S. L. City in good health.”21 Eighteen-year-old Isaac Barton, a pattern maker from St. Helens, Lancashire, England, who also had emigrated on the Underwriter, reportedly drove an ox-drawn wagon, loaded with telegraph wire.22 Edwin Parker, an eighteen-year-old servant from Preston, Candover, Hampshire, England, was employed digging holes for telegraph poles until he reached Fort Bridger, then he strung wire.23 Twenty-one-year-old James Ward and his wife, Harriet Brown Ward, left Wiltshire, England, in March of 1860. Upon arriving in Omaha, James went to work for Creighton stringing telegraph wires westward; in the meantime Harriet journeyed to Utah with a team and wagon in an unidentified pioneer company.24 Seventeen-year-old John England, a laborer from Bradpole, Dorset, England, also worked on the telegraph and, with the money he earned, helped his parents and five siblings emigrate to Zion. 25\n\nSome of the other Mormon telegraph workers had immigrated earlier. John Hymas, from Rayleigh, Essex, England, had sailed to America aboard the ship Caravan in 1856. Lacking money to continue westward he had worked at various jobs—in a New York City market, on a farm in “Newburry,” New York, and for the railroad in Iowa where in Council Bluffs he met and courted Mary Ann Pitman. The twenty-one year old John, like other Mormon emigrant men, got a job driving an ox team hauling wire and supplies for Edward Creighton. Meanwhile, Mary Ann Pitman journeyed to Salt Lake City in the 1861 Homer Duncan Company. 26 Also in 1860, the twenty-two-year-old laborer John Vincent had come from Caterham, Surrey, England. While he was engaged in telegraph construction, his new bride, the English-born Phoebe Perry Vincent, traveled west as a member of the Milo Andrus wagon train. 27\n\nAvailable information about the Mormon telegraph workers indicates that they were recent immigrants to the United States; they had come from diverse parts of England; they were young men, ranging in age from eighteen to twenty-two; some were married, others were single; most of them were unskilled. All were pilgrims—religious devotees en route to the center place of their faith; they became pilgrim-laborers. 28\n\nA few Mormon immigrants who applied for telegraph work were turned away. Frederick W. Blake, an English clerk who had arrived in the United States in 1860 aboard the ship Underwriter, wrote:\n\nI tried to get hired to go to Utah by the aid of the Telegraph Company under the management of Mr. Creighton, and I went to Omaha with 5 of the Boys, but received no encouragement from him although he took down our names, he wanted experienced Teamsters & of course we would not … pass as such, as it would have resulted unfavorably to us when we made the start. … The man Creighton had sought for 12 men & had applied to Milo Andrus for them. Milo advised me to get the names of men. I included my own, but as no definite arrangement was made, the affair broke [through] & most of the men were deprived of the chance of going. 29\n\nBlake was more fortunate than the rest; he got a job driving a wagon for the 1861 Church Train led by Ira Eldridge.\n\nEach member of Edward Creighton’s telegraph construction crew had a specific assignment—the surveyors marked the route, ax men located timber and cut poles or trimmed away tree branches that might interfere with the telegraph line; and there were teamsters whose wagons carried heavy reels of galvanized steel wire, coils of solder, insulators, batteries, battery chemicals in sturdy wicker-covered glass bottles, tools, kegs of nails, camp equipment, and provisions. Other men drove wagons loaded with poles, dropping them one by one at approximately seventy-yard intervals (twenty-two to twenty-five poles per mile).The diggers worked with pickaxes, crowbars and shovels to dig holes one foot across and five-feet deep. Others worked as pole setters, or wire stringers—men who climbed the poles, installed insulators, and hung the wire. A few of the men were herdsmen, managing the livestock. Others were hunters. 30 Several individuals assumed more than one of these roles at various times.\n\nIf there were, in fact, seventy-five Latter-day Saint men in Edward Creighton’s telegraph-building crew, they constituted about 19 percent of the total work force of some four hundred men. Each worker was armed with a navy revolver and a rifle. Creighton used hundreds of mules and oxen and approximately one hundred wagons to move the men and equipment. 31\n\nThe telegraph workers traveled and labored under various wagonmasters: James Creighton (thirty-six wagons); Joseph Creighton (ten wagons); Aaron Hoel (twenty wagons); Matthew J. Ragan (five wagons); George Guy (three wagons); John and David Hazard (fifteen wagons); James Dimmock (five wagons); and Robert Tate (three wagons).\n\nThe Mormon recruits accompanied and worked under the Hazard brothers. Ed Creighton’s secretary, Charles H. Brown, personally supervised the loading of the Hazards’ wagons and recorded what happened. When it came time to yoke up the oxen, says Brown, one of the Mormons evoked peals of laughter from the more experienced hands when he “tried to slip the bow, not taken from the yoke, over [the] head and horns” of the off ox. 32\n\nNot all of the telegraph workers started west at once. Matthew Ragan’s train left first—early in May. He had a contract to deliver telegraph poles at Julesburg, about four hundred miles west of Omaha. Proceeding to Cottonwood Canyons, in what is now Lincoln County, Nebraska (some one hundred miles west of Fort Kearny), he and his small crew immediately set to work. By June 21, they had cut and stockpiled about five hundred red cedar poles. In the end, they supplied poles enough to extend the telegraph line from Julesburg to a point about ten miles west of Fort Laramie. (Winter cut, seasoned cedar made the best telegraph poles. It seems that those used by Creighton’s men were less than ideal.) A second telegraph crew, led by James Creighton, left Omaha about May 10; the Hazard brothers’ train, including the Mormon pilgrim-laborers, was the third contingent to embark. 33\n\nThese, and the other telegraph parties, followed a well-known, well-beaten path. From Omaha to the Elk Horn River they crossed rolling timberless prairie (except for trees that grew along the banks of streams). Charles Brown commented on the number of squatter cabins along the way. Later, Brown described the Platte River Valley as “broad and beautiful.” The telegraph trains passed through the town of Fremont, crossed Loup Fork River at Columbus, and traveled on to Wood River. After crossing to the south bank of the Platte, they reached Fort Kearny. Here the garrison consisted of one company of dragoons; all other soldiers “had been ordered to Fort Leavenworth to be in readiness to march quickly to aid in the suppression of the [secessionist] rebellion.” 34\n\nBeyond Fort Kearny, the telegraph trains followed the Overland Stage route south of the Platte River, passing numerous ranches along the way. West of Plumb Creek (thirty-six miles from the Fort), the pilgrim-laborers found the land becoming dry and teeming with wolves. Hot winds blew. From Cottonwood Springs to Fremont’s Orchard the newcomers got acquainted with various varieties of American cacti, some of which were in bloom—and with prairie dogs and rattlesnakes. As the wagons continued westward, the Platte River Valley gradually narrowed until near Baker’s Ranch it was only about a mile and a half wide. 35\n\nSuperintendent Edward Creighton, the last telegraph man to leave Omaha, arrived at Julesburg on June 25. This was where he would commence his construction work since the telegraph line already extended from Omaha to Fort Kearny (built in 1860) and because W. B. Hibbard was building the segment from Fort Kearny to Julesburg. Julesburg was a “town” consisting of one dwelling/stagecoach station, one trading post, and four outbuildings all made of logs. Here, Creighton found George Guy with several loads of poles brought from Cottonwood Canyons (a nine-day round trip). Here also was a large encampment of Cheyenne Indians under the leadership of Spotted Horse. 36\n\nThe next several days were quite eventful. George Guy was soon off to Cottonwood Canyons for another load of poles. On June 26, “a powerful thunderstorm” struck; first, the sky turned a “pale yellowish color,” then “rain fell in torrents, and the wind blew a perfect hurricane.” In contrast, the twenty-seventh was “a very pleasant cool day—the wind blowing gently.” June 29, the Cheyenne dismantled their lodges, and headed for the Republican River. On this day, too, Matthew Ragan’s train arrived from Cottonwood with nearly four hundred red cedar poles, enough to erect sixteen miles of the telegraph line. Before nightfall, James N. Dimmock, a merchant/freighter on his way to Denver, arrived with three wagons loaded with provisions. Superintendent Creighton hired him and bought his entire stock of goods. June 30, fifteen wagons left Julesburg to bring up more of the poles that Ragan had cut.That night, Charles Brown drew the attention of his companions to a comet that was near the western horizon, but the men didn’t believe him; they said it was only a star. Nevertheless, in his journal Brown noted that the comet tail “constantly increased in length and width until it dropped below the horizon…it was indeed a beautiful sight.” 37\n\nAt Julesburg, the telegraph trains had to cross the South Platte River described by a contemporary soon-to-be-famous traveler Samuel Langhorne Clemens, as “a melancholy stream struggling through the center of the enormous flat plain, and only being saved from being impossible to find with the naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on either bank.” Charles Brown observed the water was “shallow, yellow, [and] muddy;” though only about a half mile wide at this point, the river was notorious for its quicksand. 38\n\nThe telegraph men started to cross the river on July 1. James Dimmock’s three wagons went first, splashing through up to four feet of water, each vehicle pulled by eleven yoke of oxen. In spite of every precaution, the last wagon stalled in mid-stream and its wheels sank into the shifting sandy bottom. A rescue party had to go in and off-load some of the freight into another rig. The two wagons then made it safely to the western shore. Of course, everyone involved in the crossing got soaked to the skin. One wonders if any of the Mormon immigrants participated.\n\nThat the pilgrim-laborers did get wet on the following day seems certain; it was then that the Hazard brothers’ wagons crossed. The men were up at early light and began unloading freight: caching some of it and redistributing the rest.When the vehicles plunged into the river, they did so three or four at a time, each pulled by eight to ten yoke of oxen urged on by three drivers. By 5:00 p.m. the entire train was safely across. Although the men had spent much of the day in the water under attack by mosquitoes that were “as bloodthirsty as tigers,” Charles Brown reported that “the boys were very cheerful over the good luck attending the day’s work, and after supper, which consisted of boiled beans, bread, coffee, fried bacon, and apple sauce, they sang comical and sentimental songs.” Brown now expressed qualified admiration for the pilgrim-laborers: “These Mormon boys are strong, healthy, good-natured chaps and some of them possess good fine voices.…They have become pretty good ox drivers;” but he continued: “They are religiously zealous, even to fanaticism.” Brown might also have observed, as he did of W. B. Hibbard and his men who arrived at Julesburg on July 1: “The men were looking well and hearty though much bronzed by the sun. Traveling on the plains changes one amazingly and from a city gent he passes—and easy is the transition—to an ox driver, dusty, dirty and browned.”39 A month on the trail had apparently seasoned all of the telegraph men.\n\nAlso on July 1, the first daily westbound Overland Mail Stage, with its “messenger” frantically blowing his horn, clattered past the telegraph workers in a cloud of dust. The first daily eastbound coach from San Francisco passed the workers twelve days later. Because stagecoach stations were located every twelve to sixteen miles along the road, the pilgrim-laborers were never very far from one of them.\n\nIn the meantime, on July 2, the immigrant-laborers’ work began in earnest. Charles Brown and Ed Creighton dug the first posthole near the Julesburg stationhouse and by nightfall workers had set a total of fifteen poles (one of them on an island), and they had run wire across the South Platte River. Creighton estimated that in order to remain on schedule, his crews would have to complete at least eight miles of line per day. On July 3, George Guy arrived from Cottonwood Canyons with eighty-one poles; the Hazard brothers’ crew dug postholes to Lodge Pole Creek (a distance of about four miles), and for two miles up its narrow valley; wire stringers completed their work over two-thirds of this distance. Superintendent Creighton and his secretary spent that night in the Hazard brothers’ camp on Pole Creek. The following day, Creighton labored alongside the workers for he wanted to watch and instruct them; and he gave them “much sound and practical advice.” On this, the Fourth of July, Charles Brown— reflecting upon the reality of the Civil War— quietly wondered to himself if, in years to come, there would be Independence Day celebrations for the United States of America as he had heretofore known them. “Can it preserve itself from disintegration,” he wrote; “My prayer is that it may.” 40\n\nThe next day, Ed Creighton and Charles Brown drove a mule-drawn buggy to Mud Springs, a stagecoach station some sixty-four miles from Julesburg. Meanwhile, work on the telegraph line continued with the main construction forces—Hibbard’s and Hazard’s crews—following up Pole Creek to the Upper Station (about thirty-three miles). They then turned almost due north going up and over high, rolling but “wonderfully broken” ground interspersed with numerous long “up and down hills” before reaching Mud Springs—the next available water. Along the way they saw deer and antelope and they passed a group of stagecoach company employees who were digging a well in a futile attempt to find water.41\n\nMud Springs Station was located on black marshy ground near where a small freshwater stream pushed its way toward the North Platte River. A year earlier, Sir Richard Burton described the station house as “not unlike an Egyptian fellah’s hut,” made of “sod half peat with vegetable matter; it is taken up in large flakes after being furrowed with the plough and is cut into proper lengths with a short handled spade. Cedar timber, brought from the neighboring hills formed the roof.”42 Nearby was a door-less pestinfested dormitory. Both Burton and Charles Brown (the latter in 1861) chose to sleep in wagons.\n\nAt Mud Springs, Ed Creighton and his secretary found Jim Dimmock who had been searching for new sources of telegraph poles. His report was discouraging. On July 6, after a night’s rest, all three men surveyed the canyons toward the west and southwest to within sight of Court House Rock; but the poles they found were terrible. They were “crooked, knotty and most of them good sized trees—dead, dry and brittle.” In spite of this and with a great deal of effort they cut a few of these because, wrote Brown, “we had to have them.” On the eighth, Dimmock brought in from Pumpkin Creek (some eight miles southwest of Mud Springs), thirty-two pine poles that were green, “scraggy, crooked, unsightly things,” but they too were used after being peeled with drawknives. 43\n\nMeanwhile, on July 7 Ed Creighton returned to Julesburg on business. By then the Hazards and the pilgrim-laborers were at Mud Springs; at the end of the next day they were ten miles farther along—at Lawrence Fork—and on their way to Chimney Rock in quest of good poles. At Chimney Rock stagecoach station they unloaded their wagons and camped amid great swarms of mosquitoes. 44\n\nThe past few days had been “excessively hot [with] not a breath of air stirring.” In fact, most of the days in July were sunny, but there were a few notable exceptions. On July 11, there was a powerful thunderstorm: “The rain fell in torrents. The wind was high, the flashes of lightning sharp and almost incessant and the thunder deafening;” and there was an encore storm next day. In spite of the discomfort these tempests caused, they did provide the men with a kind of reward—the sunsets were “gorgeous.” Though the days continued hot, nights had turned cool and the mosquitoes were less active. Until now, wrote Charles Brown, “none of the men connected with the outfit…had any suffering from sickness.” 45\n\nBack along the trail, construction continued with but few glitches; and these were soon overcome. By July 13,W. B. Hibbard’s crew had dug postholes up to the last crossing of Pole Creek; but the supply of poles did not keep pace. Superintendent Creighton worked feverishly to secure the much-needed poles from eastern suppliers. Matthew Ragan brought poles from Cottonwood Canyons. By July15 the poles had reached to about four miles north of Lawrence Fork, and a week later, on July 22, installed telegraph wire reached Chimney Rock. 46\n\nEd Creighton returned to Mud Springs Station on July 16 to learn that one of his workers—possibly his brother James—had drowned while attempting to cross the Platte River near Fort Laramie. Understandably concerned, he rushed forward to discover the truth of the matter. Two days later he was relieved to find Jim alive and well, camped in the Laramie Peak foothills, south of Horseshoe Station. 47\n\nOn the lower slopes of Laramie Peak, Jim Creighton and his men had found excellent telegraph poles and by the first week in August they had cut and peeled more than fifteen hundred poles. When the pilgrim-laborers eventually passed Laramie Peak they were undoubtedly impressed, as were other travelers. Mark Twain, for one, said that the mountain seemed to be right at his elbow, “looming vast and solitary—a deep, dark, rich indigo blue in hue.” 48\n\nOn July 20, Creighton returned eastward “to the several [telegraph] camps near Scott’s Bluff [in order to] push the work that was being prosecuted there.” On the twenty-third the Mormon workers’ camp was located at Turjon’s Ranch (eight miles east of Scott’s Bluffs), but the men were actually working farther east, near Courthouse Rock, cutting cedar and pine poles. Ed Creighton and Charles Brown spent this night and the following day with the pilgrim-laborers, the secretary accompanying the men as they distributed poles, passing Scott’s Bluffs in the process. That night, they were late getting into camp. The next night Brown and his companions stopped “in a slough where there was an abundance of water, such as it was.” Creighton spent the night at nearby Horse Ranch. At noon on Friday, July 26, the Hazard brothers and their men camped “on a slight rise of ground, just above a clear cool running stream of water and about 2 miles from the grove of pine poles [they] were to cut.” Superintendent Creighton again joined the pilgrim-laborers here and they spent that afternoon, all of the next day and part of Sunday, July 28, cutting and peeling poles. “There is no Sunday on the plains,” wrote Secretary Brown. 49\n\nThe Hazard brothers’ crew completed loading their wagons with telegraph poles on July 28 and drove to Horse Creek Station. Here they unloaded four of the wagons, and then moved eastward towards Scott’s Bluffs, dropping poles along the way. Camp that night was seven miles below Scott’s Bluffs Station. The next day the crew started early and distributed timbers “to where the construction party had set poles and strung the wire.” It was late when they arrived at their camp near Turjon’s Ranch. Everyone was “weary and dusty.” 50\n\nOn July 30, Bob Tate and his three wagons from Denver finally joined the telegraph train, and with Charles Brown accompanied the Hazard brothers and their men into the bluffs “west and Southwest of Court House Rock” to “get out poles.” Here they found cedar trees that were “small and scrubby,” and Box Elder trees that were too large, but mostly, they found pitch pine. Late in the afternoon “a severe thunder-storm accompanied with high winds swept over” them. In spite of this, the pilgrim-laborers joined with the other workers in feasting on Mountain Sheep that night—the meat was “juicy and sweet,” according to Brown. “As this was the first fresh meat we had had, the boys pitched in and did ample justice to the repast.” The immigrants spent the last day of July cutting, loading and hauling more poles, before camping “about one mile above Turjon’s.” 51\n\nThe early days of August were “blazing hot…wonderful mirages appeared.” On August 1, the Hazard brothers’ wagons once more passed Scott’s Bluffs and continued westward for about twenty-one miles. Again, it was late when they finally stopped. Both men and animals were exhausted, and one ox died in the night. After such a day, it is no wonder that the pilgrim-laborers got off to a slow start the next morning. Further delay resulted when they paused long enough to replace a telegraph pole that had been destroyed by lightning. Eventually, they passed Horse Creek where they found Ed Creighton. 52\n\nOn August 4, the immigrant-workers distributed more poles before camping near an Indian burial scaffold. Superintendent Creighton rejoined them here, spent the night, and remained with them all the next day as they continued their work of distribution. Both of the main construction crews—Hibbard’s and Hazard’s—were now close together. At Beauvois’ Ranch, secretary Brown and others did some “trading,” but the prices were so high that all they purchased was “wearing apparel and tobacco.” Here, Ed Creighton connected a transmitter to the newly erected telegraph line and “sent messages east of a friendly and business nature.” Next, with a few others, Ed visited a nearby Cheyenne encampment where, through an interpreter, he told the natives about the work he and his men were doing. Among other things, he said that lightning ran along the wires and that it would be dangerous for the Indians to interfere with the work. To illustrate his point he had the natives form a circle and join hands.Then, with the aid of a battery, he administered an electrical shock that caused the Indians to do much “prancing then and there.”53 That afternoon, when telegraph workers strung wire right over the native’s tepees, they immediately decamped.\n\nDespite another “short but severe thunder storm,” the Hazard brothers’ wagons again started east. Eight of them were to return to Julesburg to retrieve wire, insulators, and other items cached there; the remaining wagons returned to Horse Creek to get more poles. 54 Presumably both of these detachments accomplished their assigned tasks, but we do not know the details, since the Charles Brown journal (our principal source of information), stops here.\n\nOn August 10, from a vantage point north of the Platte River and one day after passing Scott’s Bluffs, F.W. Blake (the Mormon immigrant who at Omaha had failed to get a job with Creighton), wrote in his journal: “We can see Telegraph poles recently erected on the other side of the river.” Three days later he wrote: “got upon the California Road on the south side of the platte, [and passed] a station at which the Pony Express stays for to change or recruit & which has now (through the labour of Mormon Boys who are employed by the government[)] become a Telegraph Station.” 55\n\nBetween Fort Laramie and Fort Bridger, the telegraph poles and wire were to run through Wyoming’s Black Hills, across the North Platte, up the Sweetwater River, past Rock Creek, and through South Pass; but progress was slow, only three to eight miles a day. By the evening of August 5, the wire had reached only three miles beyond Fort Laramie. 56 While camped at a telegraph station/store about two days journey west of Fort Laramie, F.W. Blake wrote on August 14:“Some of the Telegraph Boys with came among us, some to pay visits, some to stay.”57 The reason some quit their jobs is unknown.\n\nAt Fort Laramie, Lewis Hoffris (or Hoffes)—a teamster in the Milo Andrus emigrant train—abandoned his female employer and “hired out to the telegraph line builders.” 58 Sarah Bethula Palmer Sharp, an immigrant traveling with the Joseph Horne Company, reported seeing telegraph poles lying strewn “along the line for miles.” 59 Thomas Cott Griggs, also with the Horne train, reported passing “Overland Telegraph construction hands setting up the wires for Utah,” on August 14. 60 George Teasdale, clerk of the Sixtus E. Johnson Company, passed a telegraph train on August 23 that had camped beside the road near Center Star Station where one of the group’s wagons had broken a wheel. It was probably this same train that passed the emigrants the following day. Then, five days later, four mule-drawn wagons loaded with wire passed on their way to Deer Creek (near modern Glenrock, Wyoming). The following day a telegraph train camped just behind the Johnson Company and “some of the ‘boys’ visited their friends in the evening.” 61\n\nLate in August both the emigrant trains and the pilgrim-laborers encountered U.S. soldiers from Fort Bridger and Camp Floyd (recently renamed Fort Crittenden) rushing eastward towards the Civil War battlefields.62 The columns of these “Sons of Mars” included “horse and foot, baggage, cows, guns, etc.” 63 According to George Teasdale, the soldiers had “7 or 8 small pieces of brass cannon.”64 To F.W Blake the troops were a “formidable sight…respectably clad, blue [being] the prevailing colour of cloth. They are of various heights quite Common in the American Army. They all look healthy, a good omen to new visitors in Utah. Some jokes were expressed as they passed us…for which they were favoured with some satirical retorts.”65 The army’s campfires were clearly visible in the frosty night air.66\n\nEach evening now a telegraph operator established a temporary station near the end of the line to receive and send messages. Pony Express riders carried dispatches westward from these transient telegraph offices and back again. By September 11, the station was about ninety miles west of Fort Laramie. As the line reached within two miles of Fort Bridger, the builders ran out of wire. Construction was delayed briefly until Superintendent Creighton could secure wire from the crew that was building eastward from Salt Lake City. 67\n\nAt Fort Bridger, Creighton staged another powerful demonstration of the telegraph for Native Americans. He invited Chief Washakie to the fort and arranged for a Sioux chief to visit the Horseshoe telegraph station just west of Mud Springs. The two men already knew one another well. Via the “Lightning Road,” they asked and answered a series of questions, and then arranged to meet at an intermediate spot to compare notes. After this encounter, both Indians were convinced that the “talking wire” was the voice of the Great Spirit. 68\n\nLate in August, Superintendent Creighton again visited Salt Lake City where he set up telegraph poles on the east side of Main Street. 69 From Salt Lake City workers sought to maintain the Superintendent’s projected schedule by extending the line eastward at the rate of fifteen to twenty miles per day. Emigrant Thomas Cott Griggs, who crossed the Weber River on September 9, saw “Telegraph company men raising the poles.”70 On September 11 the Deseret News reported that poles were “fast being put up, from this [city] eastward.”71 Eleven days later the line builders were near the head of Echo Canyon where that evening “several of the boys from the mountains [who were] engaged in the telegraph operation,” visited the camp of the Sixtus E. Johnson emigrant company. The visitors, wrote George Teasdale, “were almost wearied (I should think), answering the numerous questions of friends the folks in the camp knew that had emigrated [earlier].”That night campfires burned late “as friends were meeting friends and they had ‘lots to say.’”72 Men of the westward building Pacific Telegraph Company were not very far away and some of them helped finish the Salt Lake to Fort Bridger connection. Edwin Parker, one of the pilgrim-laborers, said that he followed the telegraph line from Fort Bridger to Salt Lake City, arriving on October 10, 1861. 73\n\nIn Utah, the pilgrim-laborers soon rejoined their friends and loved ones. Reunited, among others, were Charles and Jane Rogers, James and Harriet Ward, and John and Phoebe Vincent—John seeing his little son for the first time. John Hymas and Mary Ann Pitman were married on November 10, 1861. 74\n\nOn October 14, Ed Creighton and others brought insulators and wires into Salt Lake City and workers stretched the telegraph line into “the store lately occupied by Hooper, Eldridge and Company” at 83 South Main Street. With this, the Omaha to Salt Lake City telegraph was complete, “except for the small connection between Echo Canyon and Ft. Bridger.”75 Finally, on October 17, the two segments of the Pacific Telegraph Company wire united at Fort Bridger, Superintendent Edward Creighton personally splicing the two lines. 76 The “Lightning Road” to Utah was complete.\n\nCitizens who gathered on October 17 expecting to see a telegraph operator work his communication magic were temporarily disappointed. Though the line was finished, “for some reason there was no ‘through’ message sent till the following day.” 77 Only then did Brigham Young dispatch his felicitations to Jeptha H. Wade, president of the Pacific Telegraph Company in Cleveland, Ohio:\n\nPermit me to congratulate you on the completion of the Overland Telegraph west to Salt Lake City, to commend the energy displayed by yourself and associates in the rapid and successful prosecution of a work so beneficial, and to express the wish that its use may ever tend to promote the true interests of our dwellers upon both the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of our continent. Utah has not seceded, but is firm for the constitution and laws of our country, and is warmly interested in such useful enterprises as the one so far completed. 78\n\nAccording to the Deseret News, the “moving celebrities of Main Street then proceeded to send “congratulations over the wire to distant friends” and “the day throughout was ‘quite an occasion.’” 79 From President Abraham Lincoln to the Honorable Frank Fuller, acting Governor of Utah came the following note on October 20: “The completion of the telegraph to Great Salt Lake City, Utah is auspicious of the stability and union of the republic.” 80\n\nOn October 24, the Overland Telegraph of California (a line just completed between Sacramento and Salt Lake City) linked up with the Pacific Telegraph. Combined, the wires of these two companies completed the United States’ first transcontinental telegraph, a slender connection that helped bind the western states and territories to the then fragile American Union. Mormon pilgrim-laborers had played an important part in its construction—they had come upon the scene at a time when American labor was scarce because of the Civil War and they had partially filled the void. At the same time, they had made it possible for themselves and members of their families to reach their Zion.\n\nNOTES\n\nDavid Lyle Wood is a retired history professor.He wishes to thank the archivists and librarians,especially Melvin Bashore,at the Church History Archives and Library of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for their assistance.Thanks also to the staff of the Amer ican Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming,Laramie for their help.\n\n1 Captain Milo Andr us named the little boy Milo C.Beck.See Milo Andrus Emigrating Company Journal,1861 April-May and July-August,entries for August 3 and 21,LDS Church History Archives.In the Ancestral File the name is Milo John Perry Vincent.http://www.FamilySearch.org\n\n2 Robert Luther Thompson, Wiring a Continent:The History of the Telegraph Industry in the United States, 1832-1866 (Princeton,NJ:Princeton University Press,1947),24.\n\n3 Ibid.,81,116,117,120, 122,123.\n\n4 Quoted in Alvin F.Harlow, Old Wires and New Waves:The History of the Telegraph,Telephone,and Wireless (New York:D.Appleton-Century Company,1936),306.\n\n5 John M.Bernhisel to Brigham Young,May 24,1850,Journal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints May 24,1850,2,LDS Church Archives.\n\n6 Thompson, Wiring a Continent,.297,298,324,343,350;Harlow, Old Wires, 306.\n\n7 Harlow, Old Wires, 309.\n\n8 Quoted in Levi Edgar Young, The Founding of Utah,(New York:Charles Scribner’s Sons,c.1924),404.\n\n9 Thompson, Wiring a Continent, 81,116,120,123,135;Frank A.Root and William Elsey Conneley, The Overland Stage to California:Personal reminiscences and authentic history of the great overland stage line and pony express from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean,(Topeka:1901),427.\n\n10 U.S.Statutes at Large, Pacific Telegraph Act,36th Congress,1st Session,Chapter 137;Thompson, Wiring a Continent,81,116,120,123,135.Root and Conneley, The Overland Stage to California,427;Johnson’s Histor y of Nebraska, see http://rootsweb.com (accessed April 10,2006);Barbara Sorenson,“A king and prince among pioneers Edward and John A.Creighton,”(M.A.Thesis,Creighton University,1961),48; Harlow, Old Wires,310.\n\n11 Jacob Gates,Journal,May 3,1861,LDS Church Archives;Daughters of Utah Pioneers,“David H.
