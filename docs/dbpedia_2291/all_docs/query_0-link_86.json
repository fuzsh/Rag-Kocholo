He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lites his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\n\n—Robert Darnton, The New York Review of Books (2011).¹\n\nOne of the ironies of modern religion is that the absolute commitment to truth in some forms of evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity and the concomitant view that truth is objective and can be verified by any impartial observer have led many faithful souls to follow the truth wherever it leads—and where it leads is often away from evangelical or fundamentalist Christianity. So if, in theory, you can verify the objective truth of religion, and then it turns out that the religion being examined is verifiably wrong, where does that leave you? If you are an evangelical Christian, it leaves you in the wilderness outside the evangelical camp, but with an unrepentant view of truth. Objective truth, to paraphrase a not so Christian song, has been the ruin of many a poor boy, and God, I know, I’m one.\n\n—Bart D. Ehrman, Forged: Writing in the Name of God—Why the\n\nBible’s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are (2011).²\n\nVolume I of this series—entitled Family and Mormon Church Roots: The Colonial Period to 1820—contains an extensive Preface and Introduction which explains how this project began, as well as the aims and objectives of its author. Briefly stated, this multi-volume work—The Quest for the New Jerusalem: A Mormon Generational Saga—combines family, Mormon, and American history, and Volume I describes how a number of the author’s ancestral lines—the Knowltons, Spencers, Carters, and Hammonds—and the ancestors of Joseph Smith Jr. and Brigham Young experienced colonial New England and the early years of the American Republic. The last three chapters examine the magic world view of the Smith family and Joseph Jr.’s roughly eight year career as a teenage treasure-seer, which involved convincing credulous farmers that he could look into his favorite seerstone (the equivalent of a crystal ball) and discover buried treasure on their farms.\n\nIn Volume II—The Creation of Mormonism: Joseph Smith Jr. in the 1820s—the author thoroughly describes the contentious controversies surrounding Smith’s visionary claims and makes judgments regarding their authenticity. It also describes the first Mormon mission to the Native Americans in Indian Territory (eastern Kansas), and the successes they achieved along the way, converting Sidney Rigdon and hundreds of his fellow Campbellite Reformed Baptists in northeastern Ohio, including the author’s great, great grandfather Simeon Daggett Carter. This brought about the move of Mormon Church headquarters from western New York to Kirtland, Ohio.\n\nVolume III continues the ancestral family and Mormon story from late 1830 to the summer of 1833. During this period the three younger brothers of Simeon Carter—John Sims, Jared, and Gideon Hayden—and their families join the Mormon Church, and the four brothers engage in extensive missionary work and begin to rise in the Church hierarchy. Jared’s and John S.’s journals provide us with a fascinating window into their lives, as well as the early activities of the Mormon Church. To make clear my Carter ancestry, my father’s mother’s mother (my great grandmother) was Louisa Jane Carter, who was Simeon Carter’s daughter by one of his plural wives. The life experiences of my Hammond, Knowlton, and Spencer ancestors will be taken up in later volumes.\n\nProbably the most important development in Mormon history during this 1831-1833 period is Joseph Smith Jr.’s revelatory designation of frontier Jackson County, Missouri, as the site where the New Jerusalem/Zion will be built—which purportedly will usher in the Second Coming of Christ at that location—but his refusal to move there himself. Continuing to reside in settled and civilized Kirtland, he builds the Mormon Church’s first temple there, and the geographical split between two gathering places, separated by over 800 miles, leads inexorably to serious tensions between Joseph Jr. and his lieutenants in Ohio, and the leading brethren in Zion (i.e., Missouri). Volume III ends in the summer of 1833, just as angry Missourians rise up and violently expell the Mormons from Jackson County, making Joseph Jr.’s New Jerusalem site permanently off-limits to the Mormon Church.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nSIDNEY RIGDON\n\nThe manic phase of the illness [manic depression, or chronic bipolar disorder\"] includes a wide range of symptoms, such as: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity (which may be delusional), decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, [and] increased involvement in goal-directed activity . . . . The elevated [phase] may be described as euphoric, unusually good, cheerful, or high, often having an infectious quality for the uninvolved observer, but recognized as excessive by those who know the person well . . . . [T]he predominant mood disturbance may be irritability, which may be most apparent when the person is thwarted . . . . Grandiose delusion involving a special relationship to God . . . .\n\nWhen delusions or hallucinations are present, their content is usually clearly consistent with the predominant mood . . . . God’s voice may be heard explaining that the person has a special mission. Persecutory delusions may be based on the idea that the person is being persecuted because of some special relationship or attribute.\"\n\n—Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3d ed. rev.\n\n(Washington, D. C., American Psychiatric Association, 1987), 214-17.³\n\nIn late 1830, when the four Mormon Indian Missionaries—on their way from western New York to Indian Territory to preach to the Indians—stopped in northeastern Ohio and converted Sidney Rigdon and many of his fellow Campbellites, they changed the geographical center of gravity of the fledgling Mormon Church from western New York to Ohio. F. Mark McKiernan notes that Rigdon’s conversion and the missionary effort which followed transformed Mormonism from a New York-based sect with about a hundred members into one which was a major threat to Protestantism in the Western Reserve.⁴ Furthermore, the oratorically skilled and relatively well-educated Rigdon soon became the second most important Mormon, a position he would occupy at least until 1839. Rigdon also heavily influenced the character of Mormon socio-economic doctrine and possibly also Joseph Smith’s revision of the Bible. It is important to take a close look at the man who to a large extent replaced Oliver Cowdery as the man who shared some of Smith’s visions and was responsible for Smith’s decision to move his headquaraters to Ohio.\n\nIn 1994 historian Richard S. Van Wagoner—describing himself as a fifth-generation Mormon and a rock-ribbed skeptic—published an impressive biography of Rigdon, and in the Introduction he argued that long before Brigham Young entered the stage through a side door after the drama [of Mormonism] had already started, Sidney Rigdon, a fiery ex-Baptist preacher, emerged as Smith’s foremost adviser, strategist, and divinely-inspired spokesman . . . .⁵\n\nHowever, because (1) Rigdon’s influence tailed off dramatically after 1838; (2) he lost the favor of Joseph Jr. in 1840s Nauvoo (though he remained a member of the Mormon Church First Presidency); (3) he unsuccessfully opposed Brigham Young in the struggle to replace the murdered Joseph Smith as Church President; and (4) he subsequently organized an alternative (though unsuccessful) Mormon Church to the one Young was leading, Young and subsequent LDS Church leaders have sought to misleadingly downplay his importance during the 1830s. According to Van Wagoner this has entailed a dishonest retroactive alteration of the historical record. Together Rigdon and Smith, in a theological partnership, led a nineteenth century religious revolution that is still on-going in many respects. Rigdon’s role in the birth of Mormonism was substantial, yet the lion’s share of his contribution has been obscured by official alterations of original records. Once the hierarchy began to tidy up Mormon history, Rigdon was swept out of the back door.⁶\n\nIn some respects the decision by LDS Church leaders to deliberately diminish Rigdon’s importance also has been due to the obvious weaknesses of the man, which Van Wagoner fully acknowledges—the subtitle of his biography is A Portrait of Religious Excess. It was painful for LDS Church leaders and historians to acknowledge that this man—who exhibited unseemly fanaticism and symptoms of serious mental illness, issued revelations and claimed numerous visions which LDS leaders contemptuously dismissed as fraudulent, and came to such an ignominious end—could have played a central role in the early Mormon Church. Having largely succeeded in downplaying his contribution, they have felt free to disparage the man, but in doing so they befoul their own nest, so to speak, since Rigdon’s role was extremely important. Rigdon, historian Ronald E. Romig rightly maintains, came to have a profound influence on the direction and organization of the [Mormon] movement.⁷\n\nVan Wagoner notes that Rigdon was blessed with a powerful and mellifluous voice, enthusiasm, and a prodigious memory for scripture . . . . An avatar of eloquence who carried the flame of the visionary tradition, he could sway by the sheer force of his faith, passion, and ideological fervor. However, he maintains that Sidney was mentally ill: Episodically his existence was overshadowed by melancholia, a metaphysical sadness best known today as Bipolar Affective Disorder or Manic-Depressive Illness. Rigdon’s debilitation, possibly precipitated by a childhood head injury, often plunged him into the blackest despair or spiraled him into unrealistic ecstasy or religious compulsiveness.⁸\n\nVan Wagoner describes Rigdon as a religious addict and fanatic whose entire life was passionately preoccupied with religion, and he makes the following interesting comments regarding the line between mental illness and extreme religiosity:\n\nThe contradictions of religious fanaticism are fascinating. There is something powerful and compelling about the manner in which intense ardor can imprison the human soul. One of the striking facts in the lives of many of the world’s religious leaders is their apparent abnormality, an eccentric nature sometimes erupting into psychosis. Prominent Mormon psychiatrist Louis A. Moench has written that the line between religious thought or behavior and mental disorder is sometimes thin. Adding insight to this theory, Lillian H. Robinson, professor of psychiatry at Tulane University School of Medicine, wrote that religion, although not a disease, like compulsive defenses it can become pathological when it is excessive, maladaptive, and totally preoccupying.\n\nZealot describes all that Sidney Rigdon was—a masterpiece of tortured ambivalence and religious fanaticism. A man of vast eccentricity, he is a biographer’s dream.\"⁹\n\nSidney’s father William, who owned a large plantation [in Maryland] and a number of slaves, fought in the American Revolution\n\nand afterwards sold his property, freed his slaves, and moved to Pennyslvania near Pittsburgh. When he was over forty years of age, he married Nancy Gallaher, and they had four children. Sidney was their second, born 19 February 1793. William was a stern man with rigid ways and viewed idleness as wicked. Book learning, aside from common school education obtained at the nearby log school during the winter, was deemed unacceptable. He made things difficult for the young Sidney, who was introverted and melancholy and began borrowing books from whomever would lend them, and spent time alone, pondering and reading. He read history, literature, English grammar, and the Bible, and when his father refused the boy’s request for candles to read by after dark, Sidney gathered a supply of hickory bark and in the evenings, after his parents had retired, he would burn the bark in the fireplace and read by the hearth.¹⁰\n\nSidney’s son Wickliffe wrote that his father was as familiar with the Bible as a child is with his spelling book and had a very impressive memory. He noted that when his father had completed his common school education, he wanted to pursue higher education, and he pleaded with his father and mother to let him . . . but they would not consent . . . saying to him that he was able to work on the farm and he could not go.¹¹\n\nIn his youth Sidney suffered a brain concussion/injury that probably affected him for the rest of his life. Van Wagoner:\n\nHis brother Loammi, a physician, reported that when Sidney was seven years old he had been thrown from a horse. His foot got caught in a stirrup and he was dragged some distance before being rescued. In this accident, reported Dr. Rigdon, he received such a contusion of the brain as ever afterward seriously affected his character, and in some respects his conduct. His mental powers did not seem to be impaired, but the equilibrium of his intellectual exertions seems thereby to have been sadly affected. He still manifested great mental activity and power, but was to an equal degree inclined to run into wild and visionary views on almost every question.¹²\n\nAmple evidence from Rigdon’s contemporaries supports this medical opinion, Van Wagoner contends, and he cites Alexander Campbell’s mention of Sidney’s peculiar mental and corporeal malady, another account that he spoke very rapidly, and used to get tremendously excited, so that he foamed at the mouth when preaching, and Newel K. Whitney’s testimony in 1844 that before they joined the Mormon Church Rigdon was always either in the bottom of the cellar or up in the garret window.¹³\n\nWilliam Rigdon died in 1814, and after that Sidney worked on the family farm near Pittsburgh for about five years. William’s parents had been Quakers, but Van Wagoner thinks that they became Baptists, and he points out that during this period the Baptists had been transformed from a persecuted and disinherited sect to the largest Protestant denomination in America . . . . Sidney’s parents were God-fearing, Bible-reading Christians, and from a young age he likely attended Peters Creek Baptist Church. His own account, given in 1869, simply says: ‘[I] became acquainted with a Baptist minister . . . [who, called my] attention . . . to personal religion.’¹⁴ According to Van Wagoner, one had to have a conversion experience in order to be admitted into the Baptist Church, and he wryly observes:\n\nThe exact nature of Sidney Rigdon’s conversion experience is not known. Years later, as a Mormon, he reportedly said of his Baptist initiation: \"When I joined the church I knew I could not be admitted without an experience; so I made up one to suit the purpose, but it was all made up, and was of no use. Peters Creek leaders apparently did have some reservations in 1817 about Sidney’s sincerity. The Reverend Samuel Williams, in a derogatory account written after Rigdon became a Mormon, noted that there was so much miracle about his conversion, and so much parade about his profession, that the pious and discerning Pastor [Philips], entertained serious doubts at the time in regard to the genuineness of the work.\"\n\nDespite the implied controversy, Rigdon was received by the church, baptized by Father Philips, and later given a favorable letter of recommendation when he separated from the congregation. By this time, and possibly much earlier, Sidney had recognized religion as a way out of the dreary, moribund life of farming. Inculcated with an overwhelming sense of talent and destiny, the ambitious plowman set out to become a Baptist minister.¹⁵\n\nThere is much food for thought here. That Rigdon, by his own admission, made up religious experiences in his youth that his Baptist minister thought were altogether too miraculous, constitutes, one could argue, an interesting parallel with Joseph Smith. Furthermore, if Rigdon could lie about religious experiences in order to get himself into the Baptist Church, he could do so later when he became a Mormon, particularly if it would help him attain a powerful position in the hierarchy. And, as a matter of fact, LDS Church leaders maintain that Rigdon claimed numerous visions and revelations which were bogus: for example, in 1832 when he wanted a house built for him; in 1844 when he sought to become President of the Church; and afterwards when he was attempting to organize his own Mormon Church. We should keep this in mind when we examine the visionary experiences Smith and Sidney purportedly shared in the 1830s.\n\nOnce he began to pursue a ministerial vocation, Rigdon was extremely ambitious. According to Van Wagoner, while he had a humble, compassionate side, he was also opportunistic and mean-spirited as he single-mindedly sought the esteem he craved.\n\nThe first evidence of this is in a Baptist retrospective report that Sidney had coveted the aging David Philip’s pastorship. The Reverend Samuel Williams, at the time a hostile witness, said that Rigdon began to put himself forward and seek the preeminence, and was well nigh supplanting the tried and faithful minister who had reared, and nursed, and fed the church, for a long series of years. Rigdon, rare to lift a shade on his personal life, seemed to confirm this assessment when he wrote of himself many years later (speaking in God’s voice): his acquaintance with [the Bible] became so far in advance of all others that they could not contend successfully with him[.] The result of all this was that he was high and lifted up among men[,] but not withstanding this[,] my fear dwelt in his heart.\n\nPhilips, who would not retire until 1824, reportedly said of Rigdon at the time that he was not possessed of the spirit of Christ, notwithstanding his miraculous conversion . . . [and] that as long as he should live, he would be a curse to the church of Christ.¹⁶\n\nIronically, after 1844 Brigham Young and other LDS Church leaders commonly expressed the same extremely negative characterization of their former brother.\n\nVan Wagoner notes that Rigdon’s cousins—Charles, Thomas, and John—also became Baptist ministers during this decade [1810-1820], and for a number of years Thomas served as pastor of the Providence Regular Baptist Church in the town of north Sewickly, located northwest of Pittsburgh along the Ohio River. Van Wagoner believes that he undoubtedly arranged for Sidney a theological apprenticeship at the home of the Reverend Andrew Clark, who had succeeded Thomas as minister. There were no Baptist seminaries in western Pennsylvania, so ministers-in-training developed their styles on the job under the tutelage of established pastors.¹⁷\n\nSidney moved to north Sewickly in February 1819 and was thrilled with his new appointment; he later recalled [that] at the home of Clark, his ‘new friend and spiritual counselor,’ he discovered what seemed to him ‘a perfect paradise of books and intellectual companionship.’ The apprenticeship included an extensive self-improvement course of reading ‘history, divinity, and general literature’ as well as reading and memorizing extensive portions of the Bible.¹⁸ Rigdon’s church in north Sewickly belonged to a regional Beaver Baptist Association, and he quickly made his presence felt at its annual conferences, moving up from a licensed preacher to an ordained minister on 1 April 1820.¹⁹\n\nImmediately after this promotion Rigdon decided to pursue a ministerial career in Ohio, moving first to the town of Warren, which Van Wagoner characterizes as not only the religious heart of the Western Reserve but also its political center and ‘seat of justice.’ He notes that Rigdon resided for a time with Adamson Bentley, his future brother-in-law, who had been minister of the local Concord Baptist Church since 1810. Bentley . . . owned a sizeable mercantile and was married to a daughter of Jeremiah Brooks, a prominent local Baptist. Only three months after his arrival in Ohio, \"the twenty-seven-year-old bachelor [Rigdon] married [twenty-year-old] Phebe (also spelled Phoebe) Brooks on 12 June 1820.²⁰ Van Wagoner gives us the following description of the woman who would play an important role in Mormonism during its early years.\n\nWell educated for her day, with a fine mind and exquisite penmanship, Phebe was a remarkable woman. Birthing twelve children, and burying several, she ultimately was ordained a prophetess and served as a ranking leader in her husband’s [small Mormon] church in the 1860s. Perhaps her crowning achievement, considering the family’s chronic poverty, the black bouts of Sidney’s mental depression, and the compulsive fanaticism that drove her husband to the edge of religious madness, was the fact that for fifty-six years she never stopped loving him nor believing in his visions and mystical assurances. Unlike virtually everyone else when her Lord and Master died, Phebe saw something more than a wasted life in pursuit of a fool’s dream of glory.²¹\n\nUsing Warren as a base, Sidney worked as a circuit preacher who semi-regularly traveled to small churches that could not afford a resident minister, and, as his son Wickliffe later recalled, whenever a vacancy occurred in the country, he always filled it, and in that way acquired a reputation for being a very eloquent preacher.²² According to Van Wagoner, When a circuit rider like Rigdon went from town to town, he was often thronged, especially after evening meetings when a crowd would sometimes gather at his lodgings seeking further spiritual advice . . . . During the first six months of his ministry Sidney and his brother-in-law, Adamson Bentley, baptized ‘upward of ninety persons.²³\n\nIn this far more religious age—before cars, trains, planes, radios, television, and the internet—clerics generally were, along with elected officials and lawyers, the leaders of their quite insulated rural communities. Because of their relatively good education, their roles as weekly sermonizers and pontificators, and the eloquence they often attained, preachers could achieve a kind of local or regional rock-star status, which in Rigdon’s case led to the development of a substantial ego.\n\nIn August 1820 the Beaver Baptist Association split into three organizations, and the Ohio churches united to form the Mahoning Baptist Association, which included congregations in such villages as Youngstown, Warren, Salem, and New Lisbon. According to historian Richard McClellan, that year Rigdon received his own congregation at Bazetta, north of Warren, and in the Association Adamson Bentley [was] in charge and Sidney Rigdon ‘second-in-command.’ When the Association met for the first time in 1821, representing 13 congregations with 513 members, One of the strongest congregations was comprised of members around Hiram, Ohio, and it was represented by Oliver Snow, who was the father of Lorenzo and Eliza R., future Mormon leaders. Rigdon was assigned as a messenger to the Grand River [Baptist] Association, made up of congregations along the Ohio shore of Lake Erie. He preached the closing sermon of their 1821 Conference, and the Moderator was John Gee, brother of Salmon Gee. Other future Mormons William Cahoon and John Corrill represented the Kirtland and Ashtabula congregations.²⁴\n\nVan Wagoner explains that Baptists in America generally were Christian Primitivists, and Roger Williams of the Rhode Island Colony had concluded that\n\nthe church was so corrupt that there could be no recovery out of that apostasy till Christ shall send forth new apostles to plant churches anew.\n\nShortly afterwards the Six Point Baptists arose who held for the Laying on of Hands. Certain factions in Virginia during this time sought to reproduce apostolic customs of feet-washing, the holy kiss, anointing of the sick, love feasts, laying on of hands, and weekly communion. They went so far as to appoint apostles, Samuel Harris being the first chosen . . . . In such diverse places as New Hampshire, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, prophets of the ancient order began seeking the elusive dream of many Christian reformers—the rebirth of the primitive church.²⁵\n\nMormons have assumed that Joseph Smith’s Restored Gospel was unique in his time, but many of the above Baptist practices—and one could certainly add baptism by immersion to the list—were prominent features of the early Mormon Church.\n\nAlexander Campbell—who profoundly influenced Rigdon before he became a Mormon—was the son of Thomas Campbell, who emigrated from Ireland to America in 1807 and settled in western Pennsylvania. Thomas wrote a work entitled Declaration and Address that enumerated the shortcomings of contemporary religion and outlined the steps necessary for the restoration of primitive Christianity. Just as he finished penning his important work, Campbell was joined by his son, Alexander, who with the remainder of the Campbell family had been summoned to America by his father.²⁶\n\nThe two of them set about launching what Van Wagoner calls a joint crusade to repudiate human creeds as tests of fellowship. They formed their own church in the Pittsburgh area in May 1811, practicing ordination by the laying on of hands and baptism by total immersion. In July 1821 Rigdon and Adamson Bentley visited Alexander at his home, and he indicated that the three of them talked religion earnestly that day and throughout the night. Rigdon and Bentley were convinced his theology was correct, and their senses afire they returned to Warren intending to set the Western Reserve ablaze with their replenished religious convictions.’²⁷\n\nVan Wagoner maintains that Rigdon played a key role in the important Campbellite movement in the 1820s—which became the Disciples of Christ Church—but because he slammed the door noisily when he left the society in 1830, he is treated with modest respect in only a few Disciple sources. Rigdon’s greatest contribution to the Reformed Baptist Movement was his persuasive rhetoric . . . . Alexander Campbell described Sidney as ‘the great orator of the Mahoning Association, and Robert Richardson, Campbell’s son-in-law and biographer, added that Rigdon ‘was a man of more than ordinary ability as a speaker, possessing great fluency and a lively fancy which gave him great popularity as an orator.’²⁸ Van Wagoner cites the following comment about him in Hayden’s seminal history: \"Sidney Rigdon was an orator of no inconsiderable abilities. In person, he was full medium height, rotund in form; of countenance, while speaking, open and winning, with a little cast of melancholy. His action was graceful, his language copious, fluent in utterance, with articulation clear and musical . . . . His personal influence with an audience was very great . . . . He was just the man for an awakening.²⁹\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nSIDNEY RIGDON:\n\nCAMPBELLITE RADICAL\n\nMania has been described as an overwhelming feeling of oneness with a god-like force, a feeling of holiness that the manic-depressive is understandably reluctant to discount as merely an expression of madness. [But] What if faith, like [Roland] Barthes’s love [in his A Lover’s Discourse], is also a series of identifiable sensations to which we assign a false value?\n\n—Michael Greenberg, The Mania of Love (2011)³⁰\n\n[T]he doctrines which he [Rigdon] advanced being new, public attention was awakened, and great excitement pervaded throughout that whole section of the country, and frequently the congregations which he addressed, were so large that it was impossible to make himself audible to all. The subjects he proposed were presented in such an impressive manner to the congregations, that those who were unbiased by bigotry and prejudice had to exclaim, we never heard it in this manner before.\n\n—Sidney Rigdon, describing his activity as a Reformed Baptist\n\n(Campbellite) preacher in the late 1820s in northeastern Ohio.³¹\n\nBefore launching this awakening in Ohio, Rigdon moved for a time to Pittsburgh, and Van Wagoner maintains that he was invited there by Alexander Campbell. Not mentioning Campbell’s invitation, Rigdon later wrote that he was requested by the First Baptist Church of the city of Pittsburgh, to take the ‘pastoral charge of said Church. He occupied that position in 1822 and 1823. Phebe Rigdon was baptized in Warren, Ohio, on 2 December 1821, nearly eighteen months after marriage to Sidney and shortly before the Ridgon’s moved to Pittsburgh.³²\n\nAs part of an autobiography published in the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo in May 1843 Rigdon wrote the following words—in the third person—describing his Baptist Church pastorate in Pittsburgh in 1822-23. One of the best ways to get to know the man is to read what he wrote about himself:\n\nAt the time he commenced his labors in that Church and for some time before, the Church was in a very low state and much confusion existed in consequence of the conduct of their former pastor. However, soon after Elder Rigdon commenced his labors there was a pleasing change effected, for by his incessant labors and his peculiar style of preaching, the Church was crowded with anxious listeners. The number of members rapidly increased, and it soon became one of the most respectable Churches in that city. He was now a popular minister, and was much respected in that city, and all classes and persuasions sought his society. After he had been in that place some time, his mind was troubled and much perplexed, with the idea that the doctrines maintained by that society were not altogether in accordance with the scriptures. This thing continued to agitate his mind, more and more, and his reflections on these occasions were peculiarly trying; for according to his views of the word of God, no other church that he was acquainted with was right, or with whom he could associate; consequently, if he was to disavow the doctrine of the Church with whom he was then associated, he knew of no other way of obtaining a livelihood except by mental labor, and at that time had a wife and three children to support.\n\nOn the other hand was wealth, popularity and honor, on the other, appeared nothing but poverty and hard labor. But, notwithstanding his great ministerial success, and the prospect of ease and affluence, (which frequently swerve the mind, and have an undue influence on too many who wear the sacred garb of religion, who for the sake of popularity and of wealth, can calm and lull to rest their conscientious scruples . . . ,) yet, his mind arose superior to all these considerations. Truth was his pursuit, and for truth he was prepared to make every sacrifice in his power. After mature deliberation, deep reflection, and solemn prayer to his Heavenly Father, the resolve was made, and the important step was taken; and in the month of August, A. D. 1824, after laboring among that people two years and six months, he made known his determination, to withdraw from the church, as he could no longer uphold the doctrines taught and maintained by it. This announcement was like a clap of thunder—amazement seized the congregation . . . which at last gave way in a flood of tears. It would be in vain to attempt to describe the feelings of the church on that occasion, who were zealously attached to their beloved pastor—or the feelings of their minister. On his part it was indeed a struggle of principle over affection and kindness.³³\n\nHumility definitely was not one of Sidney’s virtues.\n\nImage0002.jpg\n\nSidney Rigdon. Courtesy of Community of Christ Archives.\n\nThe Baptists in Pittsburgh claimed that Rigdon was excommuni-\n\ncated, but when he left he took the majority of his congregation with him. According to Reverend Samuel Williams, who served as minister of the First Baptist Church of Pittsburgh from 1827-55, Rigdon was guilty of many errors during his Pittsburgh ministry, and one of them was that \"he spoke publicly of restoring the ‘ancient order of things,’ among which was laying all one’s possessions ‘down at the Apostles feet.’ At firesides he frequently introduced his ‘common stock system,’ as he called it, and ‘urged with importunity, many of the members to embrace the system.’\"³⁴ Thus Rigdon’s Christian socialist convictions went back at least to 1823.\n\nAccording to Van Waggoner, Rigdon and his followers joined with Walter Scott’s small New Light Presbyterian group [in Pittsburgh] . . . . They had no meeting house and met every Sunday in the Allegheny County Court House. Unfortunately, the Reformers did not support their ministers financially as had the Baptists, and in order to support themselves, Scott taught school and Rigdon became a tanner.³⁵\n\nDescribing this radical change in occupation, Rigdon wrote: Having now retired from the ministry, and having no way by which to sustain his family, besides his own industry, he [Rigdon] was necessitated to find other employment in order to provide for his maintenance, and for this purpose he engaged in the humble capacity of a journeyman tanner. Van Wagoner notes that Rigdon apprenticed under his brother-in-law, Richard Brooks, and this change in his social station was difficult for him to accept.\n\nStatus-conscious, Rigdon had a lifelong tendency to put on superior airs, and a tannery bespoke a down-at-heel’s life. In addition to being surrounded with vats of lime solution, ammonia, and tanning liquors, tanners scraped the loosened hair and flesh from hides by hand. Rigdon himself called it a humble occupation, and humiliation seemed to be his primary emotion. He added that when many of his former friends, those who manifested the greatest love for his society, saw him wearing the garb suited to the employment of a tanner, there was no longer that freedom, courtesy and friendship manifested.\n\nThe indifference of his former associates struck at the core of Rigdon’s self-esteem. That it seared his soul is apparent from his recollections fifteen years later. To a well regulated and enlightened mind, he began, to one who soars above the arbitrary and vain lines of distinction which pride or envy may draw, such conduct appears ridiculous—while at the same time it cannot but cause feelings of a peculiar nature, in those, who for their honesty and integrity of heart, have brought themselves into situations to be made the subjects of it.³⁶\n\nNo doubt enormously relieved to get away from his Pittsburgh tanning job, in December 1825 Rigdon moved his family—which now included four daughters—all the way to Bainbridge, Geauga County, Ohio (now an eastern suburb of Cleveland), where they settled on a landed estate owned by Phebe’s father, Jeremiah Brooks. Sidney’s religious situation and financial prospects immediately brightened. Unlike the stilted and staid Redstone Association, Van Wagoner explains, Baptist organizations in the vigorous Western Reserve not only tolerated new biblical interpretations but welcomed and embraced them. Back in Ohio it was known ‘he had been a preacher, and had gained considerable distinction as a public speaker, and the people soliciting him to preach, he complied with their request.’³⁷ Surely he did so with great relish and relief.\n\nWorking as a circuit preacher, the largest congregation under his influence was at Mantua Center, Portage County, Ohio, where he preached once a month. The group consisted of disciples from Nelson, Hiram, and Mantua. On 24 August 1824 the Mantua congregation passed a resolution ‘to remove the Philadelphia Confession of Faith and the Church Articles, and to take the Word of God for our Rule of Faith and Practice.’ This action established the assemblage as ‘the first Church of Christ of the Restoration Movement in Ohio,’ according to official Disciple of Christ accounts.³⁸ McClelland points out that Oliver Snow chaired this historic Mantua/Hiram meeting, and also in attendance were Noah Packard, Lucius Scovil, David Pond, and Rufus Edwards, all future Mormons.³⁹ Note that these radical Baptists used the word Restoration—in their minds they were restoring the primitive New Testament church. Rigdon apparently was very successful in the area (see his account at the beginning of this chapter).\n\nMcClelland maintains that Alexander Campbell, Adamson Bentley, Walter Scott, and Sidney Rigdon were the four leaders of the Mahoning Baptist Association and co-founders of the Disciples of Christ Church. Campbell was the scholar and writer, Bentley the Bishop to several congregations near Warren, Scott the Bishop southwest of Warren, and Rigdon the Bishop northwest of Warren.⁴⁰ Note the office of bishop, which generally had been rejected by English Puritanism.\n\nIn June 1826 Baptist preacher Warner Goodall passed away, Rigdon delivered his eulogy, and according to Van Waggoner his funeral sermon so impressed the congregation that in the fall they offered Rigdon Goodall’s former pastorship, and Rigdon eagerly accepted their offer. Mentor was/is only about three miles north of Kirtland. He began working closely with Newel K. Whitney, Sidney Gilbert, Isaac Morley, Lyman Wight, and other future Mormons from the Kirtland area; he already would have known them from his circuit preaching.⁴¹ McClellan notes that one of Rigdon’s lieutenants during this period was future Mormon John Murdock, who presided over the Disciples at Orange. Murdock’s congregation probably included the families of future Mormons Sirenes Burnett, Caleb Baldwin, and Benjamin Covey.⁴²\n\nRigdon acknowledged that his first eight months in Mentor were stormy, but eventually the storm subsided, and because of his consistent walk and conversation—his sociability, combined with his overwhelming eloquence, the evil apprehensions and surmisings of his Mentor parishioners were allayed and\n\ntheir prejudices gave way, and the man whom they had looked upon with jealousy was now their theme of praise, and their welcome guest. Those who had been most hostile, now became his warmest admirers, and most constant friends . . . .\n\nHis fame as an orator and deep reasoner in the scriptures continued to spread far and wide, and he soon gained a popularity and an elevation which has fallen to the lot of but few, consequently thousands flocked to hear his eloquent discourses . . . . The churches in the different places, where he preached, were no longer large enough to contain the vast assemblies which congregated from time to time, so that he had to repair to the wide spread canopy of heaven, and in the woods and in the groves, he addressed the multitudes which flocked to hear him . . . .\n\nNo longer did he follow the old beaten track, which had been traveled for ages by the religious world, but he dared to enter upon new grounds, called in question the opinions of uninspired men; shewed the foolish ideas of many commentators on the sacred scriptures—exposed their ignorance and contradictions—threw new light on sacred volume, particularly those prophecies which so deeply interest this generation, and which had been entirely overlooked, or mystified by the religious world—cleared up scriptures which had heretofore appeared inexplicable, and delighted astonished audience with things new and old . . . .\n\n. . . [M]any came forward desiring to be baptized for the remission of sins. He accordingly commenced to baptize, and like John of old, there flocked to him people from all the region round about—persons of all ranks and standings in society—the rich, the poor, the noble and the brave, flocked to be baptized of him. Nor was this desire confined to individuals, or families, but whole societies threw away their creeds and articles of faith, and became obedient to the faith he promulgated, and he soon had large and flourishing societies throughout that whole region of country.\n\nHe was now a welcome visitor wherever he traveled—his society was courted by the learned, and intelligent, and the highest encomiums were bestowed upon him for his biblical lore, and his eloquence.⁴³\n\nRigdon’s oratorical and ministerial accomplishments during the 1820s obviously gave him a very expansive sense of himself and his abilities, although Van Wagoner observes that his vainglorious reports of success, well documented in his own accounts, may not have been far off the mark. Other, less biased sources provide corroborative evidence. The most noted omission in his accounts, however, is the failure to credit others, particular Campbell and Scott, for their successful ministries. Rigdon once even went so far as to say that Mr. Campbell was no more the originator of that sect [Campbellite Reformed Baptists] than Elder Rigdon, but Van Waggoner’s judgment is that Rigdon most certainly did triumph, but in terms of overall contributions to the Reformed Movement he must be considered a step behind Walter Scott and Alexander Campbell.⁴⁴\n\nIn 1828 Rigdon and Adamson Bentley besieged Ridgon’s own [Mentor] congregation. Nearly the entire membership accepted the new doctrines . . . . Rigdon and Bentley received a similar reception in Kirtland, Ohio, where twenty souls entered the waters of baptism, and a separate organization became an immediate necessity. Their Kirtland converts included Lyman Wight, Newel Whitney, and Isaac Morley. During 1827-29 Rigdon established Reformed congregations in Mantua Center, Perry, Euclid, and Birmingham in Erie County, Waite Hill (the vicinity of Willoughby), Elyria in Loraine [sic] County, and the church at Hamden in Geauga County. Parley P. Pratt wrote that when he first heard Rigdon preach he was ‘astonished.’⁴⁵\n\nAccording to McClellan, at a Mahoning Association conference in 1828 Alexander Campbell reported that ‘Bishops Scott, Rigdon and Bentley, in Ohio, within the last six months have immersed [baptized] about eight hundred persons.’ Some of his organizational work was to the west of Cleveland. In 1829 Sidney, and a Mentor associate named Matthew Clapp, undertook a mission to the villages of Amherst and Florence accompanied by a young protégé who lived and studied in the Rigdon and Clapp homes—Orson Hyde [a future Mormon apostle]. Hyde returned in the spring of 1830 to serve as Disciple Minister to these two congregrations. In them, McClellan maintains, were future Mormons Milo Andrus, Orson and Parley Pratt, and Parley’s neighbors, Warren and Amanda Barnes Smith. Other neighbors included the families of Simeon Carter, Joel Hills Johnson, Sylvester Smith, and Royal Barney although no record exists indicating whether they were Disciples.⁴⁶ Actually Simeon Carter was a Methodist minister, though he would have known Rigdon and all the others.\n\nIn April 1829—one month after the Book of Mormon came off the press in Palmyra, New York—a debate took place in Cincinnati which profoundly influenced Rigdon. It was between the British social reformer Robert Owen and Alexander Campbell. A marathon affair, it took place in sixteen sessions over a period of eight days, and was held in the Methodist Stone Church, which seated 1,200. Van Wagoner notes that every seat was filled and people stood in the aisles, sat on the steps of the rostrum, and perched on the window ledges at every session.⁴⁷ Rigdon attended all of them.\n\nThe socialist Owen (1771-1858) had come to America to promote his program for social and economic reform. He proposed the formation of self-sufficient cooperative agricultural-industrial communities, and one such community, called New Harmony, was established in 1824-25 in Indiana, but failed after numerous disagreements among its members. In addition to being a philanthropist and radical social reformer, Owen was a militant atheist, and Van Wagoner maintains that during the debate in Cincinnati Campbell focused on religious issues. Campbell and Owen had immense respect for each other, and despite their differences the debate was genial. Campbell primarily emphasized Owen’s skepticism [about religion], not his radical social philosophy.⁴⁸\n\nEvidently Owen talked a great deal about socialism, however, because Rigdon, taken with Owen’s system of ‘family commonwealths, returned to Mentor, convinced that a ‘common-stock society, as outlined in Acts 2:44-45, should be implemented among parishioners.⁴⁹ The writer of Acts wrote: And all that believed [in Christ] were together [in Jerusalem]; and had all things in common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" Rigdon’s commitment to collectivism may have been strengthened by what Owen said in Cincinnati, but he had been obsessed with Christian socialist ideas for years.\n\nLDS historian and anthropologist Mark Lyman Staker points out that during the late 1820s there were several communitarian groups in the Western Reserve: a community of Shakers just east of Cleveland consisting primarily of settlers from New England and a community of Separatists of Zoar from Germany. Both groups were well known in the region for their communal living, and their existence undoubtedly helped raise questions about the relationship between belief and economic life. However, a more important influence on Rigdon and his followers was the Kendal Community:\n\nOwenites initially established a community in Ravenna, Portage County, just south of Kirtland, drawing members from Sidney Rigdon’s Portage County congregation . . . . These Portage County Owenites quickly joined a nearby community of Stark County just to the south in the village of Kendal . . . .\n\n. . . [T]he Kendal community began with hope and enthusiasm. They erected brick buildings and developed a large Family organization in which they shared property and resources as though they were literally a large family of fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters . . . .\n\nIn May 1826 the group formally organized itself as the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests but soon became popularly known as the Kendal Community. This community established a series of articles governing social life that allowed members the right to leave at pleasure and take their property with them.⁵⁰\n\nStaker also points to another significant influence of Robert Owen on Mormonism, noting that by the time Rigdon’s disciples in the Kirtland area first heard of Robert Owen, the bee had already become a symbol of Owenite philosophy . . . . Owen’s perspective was that ‘a colony of bees co-operating . . . is the grand model of what man would be, and what he would do, were he under the benign influence of just knowledge and sound philosophy.’ . . . Owen used an old-fashioned skep or bell-shaped basket beehive as the symbol of his cooperative movement as workers organized and identified themselves under it. Staker maintains that this very likely was the source of Mormonism’s and Utah’s beehive symbol.\n\nThe bee skep later became an important symbol in Latter-day Saint communities in the Rocky Mountains. Although the beehive also resonated with ideas espoused by the Freemasons, early Latter-day Saints had a broader and deeper exposure to the skep as a symbol of industry and harmony through Robert Owen. Tens of thousands of English workers who followed Owen organized themselves under the beehive during the early 1840s as a symbol of their efforts to shape collective labor. Brigham Young and other early LDS who preached of a new social order in English working communities saw this symbol almost everywhere they looked on building, banner, and brochure. These missionaries baptized thousands of converts who knew the symbol well from having organized and worked under it in Britain . . . . [I]t is clear that thousands of British immigrants to Utah and their neighbors who had served missions in the British Isles would have primarily recognized the symbol as a representative of Owenite community building and cooperative effort before reshaping it for their own purposes.⁵¹\n\nGiven the dominant, conservative, Republican Party political ideology subscribed to by the overwhelming majority of today’s LDS Church leaders and Utah voters, it is supremely ironic that the beehive symbol of the early State of Deseret and current State of Utah—a symbol thoroughly embraced by the LDS Church during the late nineteenth century—probably had its origin in the movement founded by Robert Owen, who not only was a socialist, but also a militant atheist.\n\nAccording to Staker, Sidney Rigdon baptized a large group of new followers in and near Kirtland in 1828, and thus many of Kirtland’s citizens repeatedly exposed to Owenite thought became part of the Reformed Baptist movement. These people largely formed the nucleus of those Rigdonites who accepted his version of communitarianism. Immediately after the Campbell and Owen debates, however, the Kendal Community crumbled and many of its members returned to their families near Kirtland. The issue which destroyed the community was religion: many of Owen’s followers were atheists—including Kendall leader Dr. Samuel Underhill—and there was a falling out between religious believers and non-believers.⁵²\n\nRigdon converted many people in northeastern Ohio to religious communitarianism, quite a few of them already believers in Owenite socialism. Van Wagoner:\n\nThe two leaders he convinced in February 1830 . . . were future Mormons Lyman Wight and Isaac Morley. Morley, who owned a large farm near Kirtland,⁵³ three miles from Mentor, offered his farm for the collective experiment. Morley and Wight, along with Titus Billings and three other families, covenanted with each other to renounce private property and share all goods. They called their order the Family or Big Family after Owen’s concept of family commonwealth. By October 1830 the group numbered more than 100 individuals. In addition, Wight had converted five families in Mayfield, about seven miles up river from Kirtland, each of whom also covenanted to abide by the early Christian communal lifestyle.\n\nWhile both groups took spiritual direction from Rigdon, he did not become a member of either community, although he visited them frequently. His reason for not joining is not known. Perhaps it was to keep harmony among the portion of his congregation that was not committed to the communal goal.⁵⁴\n\nIt would appear that those who had the most faith in Rigdon in the area were the ones who adopted his radical collectivist program, and these were, among others, the ones who joined the Mormon Church with him a short time later.\n\nOne important element in the preaching of Campbellite leaders during this period was end-is-nigh expectations. Rigdon’s interest in communalism, Van Wagoner maintains, was rivaled only by his belief in millennialism. Such thinking was extremely common during this period, and the ardor of religious awakening resulting from the Reformed Baptist Movement led Rigdon and others to hope that the Millennium would soon dawn, that the long-awaited Second Advent, when the Lord would come again in the clouds of heaven, would quickly arrive.⁵⁵\n\nAccording to Van Wagoner, Disciples of Christ historian Amos S. Hayden maintained that it was Walter Scott who was the ‘origin of millennial views among us, and Hayden wrote that Sidney Rigdon, who always caught and proclaimed the last word that fell from the lips of Scott or Campbell, seized these views, and with the wildness of his extravagant nature, heralded them every-where [sic]. But Van Wagoner points out that \"even the more stable Campbell, convinced the Millennium was dawning, had during the Cincinnati debate connected Owen’s social ideal with his own philanthropist to hasten that glorious day. In anticipation, in 1830 he changed the name of his periodical from the Christian Baptist to the Millennial Harbinger.’\"⁵⁶\n\nVan Wagoner notes that In early 1830 Sidney Rigdon’s reformed congregation in Mentor approached him about a set reimbursement for his services. Van Wagoner wryly observes that\n\nAlthough Rigdon, in reality, had no talent for poverty, he told lay leaders he did not believe in selling his services in that way but would receive what they felt willing to give. They offered him a suitable habitation in which himself and family could be made comf[o]rtable and one which would accommodate his numerous visitors who were calling upon him.\" A committee was appointed and a fine farm in the township was purchased. Materials were ordered and work commenced on the house . . . .\n\nBut Rigdon seldom continued on the way he was going. His life-long pattern was to follow his own compass even when it veered towards unknown tangents. Because of this predilection, or perhaps in spite of it, the fine residence upon a beautiful farm on the Western Reserve would be a home the Rigdon family would never occupy.⁵⁷\n\nAccording to Van Wagoner, three issues led to a break between Rigdon and Alexander Campbell just before Sidney embraced Mormonism: the so-called gifts of the spirit spoken of in the New Testament, the authority to perform ordinances, and communitarianism. Campbell is said to have held that after converts expressed faith and were baptized they would receive the spirit of Christ or Holy Ghost, but\n\nHe added, however, that those who received of the Holy Ghost would not receive all of the spiritual gifts manifested in the primitive Christian church. The miracles wrought by the Holy Spirit during that early period, such as healing and speaking in tongues, would not reappear in the latter days. Those ancient miracles, he contended, were only to confirm the new religion and prove its divine origin. The manifestations were for a limited time, which had long ago expired.\n\nIn contrast, some of Rigdon’s followers sought the very gifts and power described in the Holy Scriptures.⁵⁸\n\nThe break occurred during the 1830 annual meeting of the Mahoning Baptist Association, held that year in Austintown, near Youngstown, and it involved Christian socialism. Van Wagoner:\n\nOn Saturday when Reverend Rigdon had the floor he introduced an argument to show that our pretensions to follow the apostles in all their New Testament teachings, require a community of goods; that as they established their order in the model church at Jerusalem, we were bound to imitate their example.\n\nCampbell, in attendance, considered any attempt to introduce communal practices highly impractical. Furthermore, he was not a man who could share his throne with anyone, and those who challenged his leadership were quickly cut down. Not even best friends were spared if they assumed the prerogatives he felt belonged to him alone.⁵⁹\n\nThe imperious Campbell took the floor and spent thirty minutes informing the association that the New Testament did not call for communitarianism, and he probably was right, since the having all things in common practice appears to have been restricted to some Jewish converts to Christianity in Jerusalem, and was not widespread in the early Christian church. Rigdon—publicly embarrassed and humiliated, but not convinced—did not respond, and the issue never came up again at the conference. Rigdon was deeply crushed by Campbell’s rejection, and he was not the type to feel no rancor. Scorn infuriated him and left him with the urge to retaliate.⁶⁰\n\nAccording to Van Wagoner, Most accounts—and presumably he means those written by Campbellite historians—\"depict Rigdon leaving the Disciple fold after his humiliation in Austintown and retreating into seclusion in Mentor. But this was not the case. Rigdon . . . merely returned home and picked up his ministry where he had left it the week before. The 16 October Ashtabula Journal noted, for example, that ‘We are requested to state that the Rev. Mr. Rigdon, will preach at the Town House in this Borough on Friday evening next, at early candlelighting. Mr. Rigdon is a Campbellite.’\"⁶¹\n\nWhen Mormonism arrived in northeastern Ohio in the fall of 1830, it fractured the Campbellite movement. As the 1820’s ended, McClellan observes,\n\nRigdon’s territory included seventeen congregations. Disciple records mention seven lieutenants who traveled with Sidney and preached to congregations other than their own. William Collins of the Chardon congregation, Matthew Clapp of Mentor, Symonds Ryder and Zeb Rudolph of Hiram, John Murdock of Orange, Lyman Wight of Kirtland, and Orson Hyde of Florence. After Rigdon’s conversion to Mormonism, Murdock, Wight, and Hyde followed him with many of their congregations. Collins, Clapp, and Rudolph became some of Mormonism’s most bitter critics. Symonds Ryder did both.⁶²\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE MORMON EXPLOSION\n\nIN NORTHEASTERN OHIO\n\nAs one of the New York missionaries, [Mormon] Parley P. Pratt, commented, In two or three weeks from our arrival in the [northeastern Ohio] neighborhood with the news, we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls, and this number soon increased to one thousand . . . .\n\n. . . With more than a dozen ordained preachers of the Book of Mormon traveling around the Western Reserve, at least some of them baptizing in significant numbers, the families of newly baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ in the area may have contributed to the 1,600 converts estimated by the Owenites.\n\n—Mark Lyman Staker, Hearken, O Ye People (2009)⁶³\n\nParley P. Pratt traveled to western New York in late 1830, read the Book of Mormon, was converted, and traveled to Palmyra to meet Joseph Smith. He was one of the missionaries chosen to go west to Indian Territory, and Van Wagoner maintains that Pratt told the others about his mentor, the Reverend Sidney Rigdon. Hopeful Rigdon would favorably receive their message, the young missionaries journeyed to the Western Reserve. Purportedly Rigdon at first spurned them and ‘felt very much prejudiced at their assertions,’ and called the Book of Mormon a silly fabrication.⁶⁴\n\nAlexander Campbell, in his Millennial Harbinger in 1831, wrote that Rigdon fasted and prayed for days, until, when ‘one of his fits of swooning and sighing came upon him, he saw an angel and was converted.’⁶⁵ According to Van Wagoner, Rigdon—who, it should be recalled, had by his own admission fabricated a miraculous vision in order to gain admission to the Baptist Church a little over a decade earlier—\"left two known accounts of this personal vision [which converted him to Mormonism]. The first, published in 1834, proclaimed:\"\n\nto my astonishment I saw the different orders of professing Christians passing before my eyes, with their hearts, exposed to view, and they were as corrupt as corruption itself. The society to which I belonged [the Reformed Baptist] also passed before my eyes, and to my astonishment it was as corrupt as the others. Last of all that little man who bro’t me the Book of Mormon [Oliver Cowdery], passed before my eyes with his heart open, and it was as pure as an angel, and this was a testimony from God; that the Book of Mormon, was a Divine Revelation.⁶⁶\n\nIt is possible that this statement was a direct response to Campbell’s 1831 dismissive comment regarding his conversion.\n\nAccording to Van Wagoner, his second account of this vision was published in the Nauvoo Times and Seasons in 1843, and it simply reported that he was ‘fully convinced of the truth of this [Mormon] work, by a revelation from Jesus Christ, which was made known to him [Rigdon] in a remarkable manner, so that he could exclaim ‘flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto me, but my father which is in heaven.’⁶⁷\n\nOnce Rigdon had been converted, he brought with him into the Mormon Church a large number of Reformed Baptists who regarded him as their religious leader, although many actually embraced Mormonism before Rigdon. Van Wagoner:\n\nMormon success in the Kirtland area was astounding. News quickly spread throughout the region that an unusual religious message was expounded by prophetic emissaries from New York. On occasion the roads were crowded with people traveling to Kirtland to hear about the restoration. Inquirers exhausted the elders with their constant questions. The people thronged us night and day, Pratt said, insomuch that we had not time for rest and retirement. Some came for curiosity, some to obey the gospel, and some to dispute or resist it. In two or three weeks from our arrival in the neighborhood with the news, we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls . . . .\n\nSeventeen members of Isaac Morley’s Kirtland communal Family were re-immersed in one night into this new dispensation. Lyman Wight wrote that the whole of the common stock family was baptized. [They were baptized before Rigdon.] . . . . ⁶⁸\n\nVan Waggoner believes that it probably was on November 7 that Rigdon asked a large number of his friends and neighbors to assemble at the Methodist church in Kirtland, and, according to Parley P. Pratt, he\n\nAddressed them very affectionately for near two hours, during most of which time both himself and nearly all the congregation were melted into tears. He asked forgiveness of everybody who might have had occasion to be offended with any part of his former life. He forgave all who had persecuted him or injured him in any manner. And the next morning himself and wife were baptized by Elder O[liver]. Cowdery. I was present—it was a solemn scene. Most of the people were greatly affected. They came out of the water overwhelmed in tears.⁶⁹\n\nFour days after this historic event Cowdery wrote a letter to Our beloved brethren in western New York giving an account of these incredible successes.\n\nOn the fourth after attending a public meeting we came to the place where we had prophesied tarrying a few days. It is where several families had united themselves as a band of brethren and put all their property together [the Morley Farm and Family] determining to live separate from the world as much as possible and when we had returned we"
