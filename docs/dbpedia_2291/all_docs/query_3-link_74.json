        "text": "Spring Break 2020-2021\n\n​Makenna Goertzen\n\n​Staff Writer\n\n​ It is that time of year again Bees! Spring on its way, as well as spring break. The break will be 10 days, going from the 19th to the 30th of March. This will be the year one anniversary of covid-19 as it hit the U.S. in March 2020.\n\nSome fun activities to do while also being safe and still practicing social distancing during spring break are, riding a bike, walking a dog, or even just relaxing in the sun. It is getting warmer and going outside is a great thing for health especially during these trying times. It can help with emotional as well as physical health by calming the mind and relieving stress. Other indoor hobbies to do during break include creating a bucket list for after Covid chills out; journal, cook something without a recipe, or reach out to an old friend. It is beneficial to mental and physical health to keep the mind busy during a time like this, so whatever activity someone chooses to do, be sure to take care of the mind and body. Another way to take care is to get some sleep! Sleep is one of the best things for health and mental stability. Teenagers should have at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep, so use the break to rejuvenate and recuperate from a long year, and to prepare for the last 3 months of school. Spending time with immediate family is also a great way to spend spring break as many people have busy lives, so spending as much time with a mother, father, or sibling is a special way to slow down and relax on break. It is a great time to see friends and family, but keep in mind that, sadly, Covid- 19 is still relevant, so stay safe and be aware of others when traveling or visiting a distant relative.\n\nHopefully, next year Covid will mellow out and students will be able to spend as much time out of the house as possible during spring break. No matter how someone spends spring break, have fun and take care of the body and mind. Have an excellent spring break Bonneville!\n\nFarewell Mrs. Olson 2020-2021\n\nJeramiah Fuger\n\nStaff Writer\n\nMrs. Olson, English teacher, Journalism advisor, and friend, is throwing in the towel this year after 33 long years of being in the teaching profession. Olson said that the decision came naturally, and that she felt it was time, as well as wanting to do something else, and to work with her husband on their cattle ranch. When asked what the first thing she wants to do after retirement, she joked, “Take a Nap!” After the long awaited nap, she said that her and her husband plan to do some traveling, and visiting family in Washington and Arizona. Not only has she put many years of hard work into teaching English, she has also been the advisor for The Bonneville Buzz for the past 6 years, saying that it was her favorite to teach because of the “...special bonds I get to form with the students.” Her favorite thing about Bonneville High School in general would be the relationships that she gets to form with all of her students. She will, however, miss all of her students, she said. Mrs. Olson also talked about what she would miss most about Bonneville High School, and said, “The kids. Of course i’ll miss the staff and stuff, but mostly the kids.” In a final questions, Mrs. Olson said that if she could say one thing to every freshmen when they walk through the doors of Bonneville High School for the first time, she would say, “Do your best to stay on top of your schoolwork, nobody likes taking a class a second time, but also don’t be afraid to enjoy high school.”\n\nEveryone at The Bonneville Buzz could never fully express how thankful they are to Mrs. Olson and her many years of counseling, leadership, and enthusiasm she has shown to the club. She truly has been the glue that holds the staff together when times get tough. Especially this year, when The Buzz thought that they would not be able to produce stories due to budget cuts, helped keep the group afloat by getting funding for a brand new website.\n\nThank you for your many years of wonderful service Mrs. Olson, and happy retirement. Go Bees!\n\nControversial Schedule Changes 2021-2022\n\nAshlyn McCowin\n\nCo-Editor\n\nThis year at Bonneville High School students have seen quite the change in the bell schedule, and honestly it is kind of a mess for a high school schedule. From getting the eight minute break taken away to our lunch not being till 1:00pm. Classes are an hour and two minutes and no one really understands the pain of this schedule. With no eight minute break to get second chance breakfast, it feels like everyone is starving by mid 4th hour. Then when students do get to go to lunch, they only get a 30min break. 30 mins to eat, relax and study. It is not very useful. Students feel like they do not have enough time to do anything. Last year's schedule was indeed rough with Covid but now, it feels like the school did not have the students in mind when making the schedule. The reasoning for removing the eight minute break has not been said, but honestly it brings curiosity why so much was edited.\n\nSo where did all the time go? Last year school started and ended at the same time but lunch has practically disappeared, and now the students have no morning break. Maybe adding two minutes to each class really took away all “free time.” For a high school, Bonneville is feeling more and more like a prison with little to no breaks.\n\nSo what are the options? Bonneville can always take away the two extra minutes of class towards the passing period. Maybe some of the time taken from classes could be put towards lunch so the teachers and students can have a longer lunch. Bonneville please start paying better attention to what the students want.\n\nWho is Mrs. Amber Cox 2021-2022\n\n​Ana Grover\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThis year, a number of new teachers have joined the Bonneville High School staff. Located in room 230 in the upper E wing, Mrs. Amber Cox is teaching Algebra 1 and Geometry. Bonneville Buzz staff writer Ana Grover interviewed Cox about her personal and professional experiences.\n\nCox grew up in Washington and went to a high school similar in size to Bonneville. While attending high school, one of her favorite electives was a jewelry and metals design class; she was also on the girls basketball team and ran cross country. In the middle of her senior year, she moved to Pennsylvania, where she finished high school. She then moved to Idaho in 2018 to attend Brigham Young University–Idaho.\n\nAt BYU-Idaho, Cox majored in math education and minored in physics education. In the interview, Cox was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, and she responded, “For a long time I wanted to do a nature preschool, and then I decided I don't want to sing to little kids all day long.” She enjoys working with children though, so she considered a teaching position.\n\nAfter Cox graduated from college, she was unsure if she wanted to teach; however, Mr. Justin Jolley, Bonneville assistant principal, reached out to Cox and asked if she would be interested in a position that had just opened up, and she agreed.\n\nCox’s first trimester of teaching has gone better than she expected. Cox said, “I think it's easier for me to stand in front of the class than I thought it was going to be. [I’m] definitely not an extrovert, so public speaking is not normally my thing, but that’s not as scary as I thought it would be.” Cox values the inclusion of explorations and physical visualizations included in the curriculum she teaches. She explained, “[Explorations] help them visualize things better, which sometimes is really hard to do in math.” She has also had success planning lessons and gauging how long assignments will take.\n\nBonneville High School is infamous for its architectural design and layout, built to resemble the hexagonal chambers of a beehive. Cox was asked in an interview what she thought about the building, and she responded, “The building is pretty weird, I think [the shapes of the classrooms are] kind of cool. I feel like mine is … big.” She also appreciates the two distinct wings of classrooms at Bonneville. That way, when a student asks for directions, “you either go to [A] wing or [E] wing. It’s a lot easier to direct them than I thought it would be,” Cox said. This, among other things, has made her first trimester of teaching easier than she expected.\n\nThe Slammin' '70s Stag Dance 2021-2022\n\n​Kimmie Barnes\n\nCo-Editor\n\nThe 1970’s, among other things, were a groovy time; similarly, the stag or solo dance, hosted by the senior class student council, was nothing short of radical. Though there were not many people in attendance, the people that came had a good time. The hallway leading to the auxiliary gym was decked out in brightly-colored smiley faces, flowers, and disco balls, creating an atmosphere where people could get their groove on. Emily Mickelsen, senior class president, and Macie Trane, senior class secretary, elaborated on the dance, the process it took to put it together, and why they chose to host a dance.\n\n“Why do you need to fundraise for graduation?”\n\nTrane shared that not many people realize how much time and money it takes to put together events. Mickelsen expanded, saying, “There are multiple senior activities at the end of the year that happen between awards night and graduation. We have to rent all the chairs, the stage, … flowers, and decorations.” There is also a senior all-nighter after graduation where they try to give everyone that comes a gift, which can end up being fairly expensive.\n\n“Why did you choose to do a dance for the fundraiser?”\n\nBoth girls shared that they wanted to “make up for lost time from last year.” Dances are something that most people enjoy, and by making it stag, it opened up more possibilities for students to come without feeling pressure to have a date.\n\n“Why a ‘70s themed dance?”\n\nBesides thinking disco would be an entertaining theme, the girls were inspired by an ‘80s dance they went in their freshman year. Trane and Mickelsen each expressed that they loved the dance and how much fun they had; they wanted to recreate the joy for others to experience.\n\n“Were there any concerns about the dance being so close to Sweethearts?”\n\nGoing into planning, the pair knew winter dances were never as big as other traditional dances, but putting the dances after Sweethearts would put it too close to prom. Their biggest problem was getting the word out about the dance. Mickelsen explained, saying, “The winter dance is different every year, so just making people aware of what it is and when [is a difficulty].”\n\nThe ‘70s stag dance was nothing but a groovy time. It gave the student body the opportunity to dress up and have a fun night dancing. A big thanks to the senior class student council and all who helped create a stellar night!\n\nA Dive Into Hope Squad 2021-2022\n\n​Roman Davis\n\nStaff Writer\n\nAmongst other school clubs, one organization at Bonneville High School that focuses on the well-being of students is the Hope Squad. Hope Squad is by the students for the students and aims to help their peers with things such as mental health, developing healthy habits, and handling stress.\n\nMost students at Bonneville have different views about the club and how it supports the school. Hope Squad Member Teagen Law was interviewed about his experience in the squad and the impact it has on students. When inquired about how others regard Hope Squad, Law replied, “I feel like a lot of people view Hope Squad like they are there and are nice because they have to be, but Hope Squad [members are] nominated because they are genuine people, and they are there to support others.” However, acting as emotional support for students can result in a great deal of setbacks and put pressure on the team’s shoulders.\n\nWith great responsibility comes great stress, especially to the squad members tasked with the job of being there for the students. When asked about any problems within Hope Squad, Law responded, “It can be stressful at times, but everyone, including the teachers, understands and gives us some slack, especially when we are not doing so hot ourselves.” Even the members of Hope Squad struggle with mental health, which can make it harder to reach out to others and spread their positivity through the school.\n\nHope Squad works diligently to include others in their activities while raising the mental health of others; however, some students often feel lost in the crowd. In an interview with a student who desires to remain anonymous said, “Hope Squad does not put themselves out there [as much as] they should. They are a big group who wants to make this school better, but they do not reach out to the ones that need it the most.” As of 2019, over 33% of high school students had experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness according to the CDC. With physical and mental health getting worse, especially due to the rise of COVID-19, it is important to help others out of this funk. Because of Hope Squad, the percentage at BHS can amount to a lower depression rate.\n\nDue to the help of Hope Squad, Bonneville has been less stressful and a reduction in issues has been shown. Here is to hoping that the club continues to help later on in the future as well as more now.\n\nA Dance with Cupid 2021-2022\n\nCharly Dixon\n\nStaff Writer\n\nCouples and friends plan to dance the night away at Sweethearts, which is right around the corner. Sweethearts is a school dance and has been at Bonneville for more than a decade. Sweethearts falls on the weekend after Valentine's Day. The theme of the dance is A Crazy Little Thing Called Love. Bree Elder, a junior at Bonneville High School, asked Zander Zamora to Sweethearts. Elder asked Zamora using donuts and a poster that said, “We DONUT know each other very well, but Sweethearts?” She is ready to go and have a great time with Zamora and her friends. Her friend group has been talking about day dates, dinner, etc. for the day of the dance. One of her favorite parts of every dance is the day date, where they could go and do a fun activity and have lunch or dinner. It usually happens the day of the dance then they will go to the dance that night. She also loves looking for dresses and getting ready that night, right after their day date. Elder is so excited to wear a fancy dress that would make her feel like a princess.\n\nEthan Smith was asked to Sweethearts by Ashlyn Landon. She proposed to Smith with a baseball home plate. Landon is so excited for Sweethearts, and wants to go and just have a good time with her friends and of course Smith. One of the questions she was asked was, “What are you most excited for?'' she responded with, “The music because the cheer coaches are hosting it and running the music, so I'm excited for that.” This dance is going to be an amazing night, and an experiment that no one will forget.\n\nSweethearts is February 19th from 8:30 P.M to 11 P.M. The dance will be at Bonneville High School. The prices are $20 for singles and $30 for couples in advance, and $30 for singles and $40 for couples at the door. Thanks to the cheerleaders and the amazing coaches for planning this dance. ​\n\nWho Runs for Fun? 2021-2022\n\nCharly Dixon\n\nStaff Writer\n\nImagine hearing the crowd cheering loudly for the next race that is about to start. The runners migrate to their lanes, set themselves on the starting blocks, and prepare for the sound of the pistol. Within seconds, they are off.\n\nTrack and field is an event that has taken place for many centuries and dates back to about\n\n776 B.C. Originally, only men were allowed to be in track; however, in 1923 women were finally allowed to do track and field. Throughout the year there have been many changes to the sport in tracks was built to be 600 feet long, but now the tracks are 400 meters, which is approximately 1312 feet. This change was necessary because people running on the outside were running more than the people in the middle. They changed it so that everyone was running the same amount. In 2016, the Olympic 100-meter race determined who was and still is the fastest man on earth. Usain Bolt won with a time of 9.81 seconds in the Rio Olympics and had the record with a time of 9.58 seconds. Bolt is an eleven-time world champion, eight-time Olympic champion, and triple world record holder in running 100-meter and 200-meter races. His first race was in 2002 in the world junior championship. He also ran in the JamaicanHigh School Championships in 2003 and broke the 200 meters and 400 meters records with times of 20.25s and 45.35s.\n\nAlexandria Baird, a freshman at Bonneville, is on the track and field team. Her main inspiration to do track was her dad, because he was a middle school coach when she was a kid and she would go and watch a lot of the meets. Her favorite race to watch was the high jumps and she knew that is what she wanted to do. The most important race to Baird is high jump, because that is her event. Track is a sport that people have to at less like to run a little bit, because most of the track events have to even if they are a jumper or a thrower. Track is one of those things that they have to do if they want to compete in the events they love. According to Baird, “I do not love running, but I still do it to condition myself and it helps with high jump.” Track and field offers more than just running.\n\nWith all of the variety of events that are offered through track and field, athletes can show off their talents in the event of their choice. Not many other sports have this dynamic.\n\n​\n\nBuzz Changes 2020-2021\n\nJeramiah Fuger\n\n​Assistant Editor\n\nHappy third trimester Bees! As the 2020-2021 school year winds down, we here at The Bonneville Buzz, to keep acclimated for the crazy times we are living in, have decided to make some changes to how we will bring you news from around the world, and right here in your own backyard. The biggest change that we will be making, is that our paper will now be online! After many years of deliberation, The Bonneville Buzz is finally making an online paper. This change is partially due to budget cuts that resulted from the Coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately, most clubs are experiencing such a shortage. Hopefully this change makes it easier for us to bring you up-to-date information faster and more efficiently. We are working diligently to make sure we can keep bringing you the information you need! Now, this does not mean that we will never print papers again, as that is what we were founded on, it is like our tradition. However, for the time being, we will be posting online. The website URL will be announced and shared once available!\n\nDue to the shortage of funds, and lack of concessions to host, we have also started an aluminum can drive! We encourage you to bring us aluminum cans to room 205, in return for a sweet treat!\n\nWe also plan to host more sweet activities this trimester. At the moment we would like to hold a hot chocolate sale while it is still frosty outside, and later in the trimester have a waffle/pancake bar with toppings like syrup and peanut butter.\n\nAs has been for decades, our goal here at the Bonneville Buzz is to bring you accurate information that relates to you, show you what is going around the world, and we hope you stick with us through these crazy times! If there is anything YOU would like to see us do, or any recommendations for our website, let us know in room 205! Go Bees!\n\nMarching Into Success 2021-2022\n\n​Jessie Larson\n\nStaff Writer\n\nIn a high school environment, different clubs and groups fill the campus with many diverse abilities and interests. Most commonly recognized of these groups are sports teams, but what many people disregard is the smaller, school-based organizations that can help make those sport games exceptionally special. When the band gets to play at basketball or football games, school spirit is much more prominent. While playing the instruments, members of the marching band have specific footwork and drills they have to remember, making each member's role in the band very complex. The group placed third in their competition on October 2nd. In an interview with 11th grade drum major Rebekah Grover, she stated:\n\n“A lot of our band was going in not really expecting to place because it's our first year doing a real competitive show, especially back after COVID, but we just went into it with the mindset that no matter what happened we would do our best.” Throughout the interview, Grover talks about the importance of a good mindset and teamwork. She continues by saying, “The band leadership knew that we would just try to all work together as a team.”\n\nHelping guide her peers to a big accomplishment, Grover is just the leader many would want to have. She was in the concert band as a freshman watching her peers join the marching band. “A lot of the kids that did regular band also did marching band. I just thought it would be a cool thing to try because it really combines music with physical things, like making shapes on your feet.” Little did she know, she would help lead this team two years later. When tryouts came around for the drum major position, Grover decided to make a bold move and try out. Soon after the tryouts, she found out she received the position!\n\nThe band must be united to sound good together. Thankfully there are people like Rebekah Grover to help mold her peers to be the best that they can be with one another. With determined leaders, it is likely the marching band will continue to be successful and spread the Bonneville bee pride!\n\nLooking Back on First Trimester 2021-2022\n\nJessie Larson\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe first trimester is coming to an end for the 2021-2022 school year. Since the arrival of COVID-19, school has been the closest thing to life before this virus for many students. Sport games regulations are little to nothing, masks are no longer mandated but instead strongly encouraged, and quarantine is not as common. Many other rules and regulations made for COVID are also starting to fade for Bonneville Joint School District 93 compared to the 2020-2021 school year. Last year, Bonneville High School was overcome with sickness and absences, and the virus caused the school to cancel many sporting events, band competitions, teams practices, and much more; the list goes on. Despite the hardships from last year, Bonneville was able to change the pattern of the repetitive, incidental losses from quarantine within the first trimester. The varsity football team played in Civil War, a football game that has been a tradition for many years. The game was close until BHS won with a touchdown! Bonneville had not won this game in years. The team continued successfully by making it to the playoffs in Pocatello, but lost during the first game. The school's varsity volleyball team made it to state after winning districts. The team's game at state was well-matched, but Bonneville lost for the first time in many years. Bonneville’s swim team made it to districts and state! Many of the other clubs and teams have also been successful in their competitions, meets, or events.\n\nBonneville’s student council has been a big part of the success with making school events have more school pride. They have created and announced themes for events, made posters and made sure to announce the event multiple times.\n\nA staff writer from The Bonneville Buzz went around campus at lunch interviewing students spontaneously. When asked if school spirit plays a role in the success of the school, nearly every student said yes. “When there was a bigger student section at games, our team usually would play better. Especially if there was lots of cheering and chants,” one student said. Throughout all the interviews each student says that in their opinion school spirit has played a role in the success of our school.\n\nOther than sporting events, the Miss Bonneville Pageant took place November 10. Bonneville’s student body president, Emoree Dahlke took first place. Senior Project presentations have just recently started, Basketball season is starting, and other teams are preparing for their competitions that are held later in the year.\n\nAs a school, BHS has been very successful throughout the first trimester, although each individual’s efforts and cooperation are what determine the unified success. The rest of the year looks very promising and hopefully Bonneville can continue this streak of success!\n\nTraditional and Non-Traditional Traditions\n\n2021-2022\n\nKimmie Barnes\n\nCo-Editor\n\nThe holiday season looks different for everyone in one way or another; some of those differences translate into their own traditions. In the seemingly small corner that is Bonneville High School, there are numerous ways that students celebrate the holidays. Through a series of short interviews, various students explained their holiday traditions.\n\nStarting off with Christmas traditions, Junior Bree Elder has a couple out-of-the-ordinary Christmas Eve activities. First off, she and her family visit Lava Hot Springs. When asked how this tradition came about, Elder replied, “We honestly just got bored and decided to go to Lava.” For their Christmas Eve dinner, they do a “favorites meal.” Each member of her family picks an item they want to have for dinner, and that wish is granted by her mom. Another student who would like to remain anonymous shared their “finding the pickle” game. Every year their family has a competition to find the pickle ornament that is hidden in the tree. They even go as far to use decoy cucumber ornaments. The winner gets a real pickle as a reward.\n\nNew Year’s Eve is another holiday that creates a bounty of unique traditions. Brysen Ball, a Junior, shared about the art he makes on New Year’s. Every year he and his little cousins make whipped cream art. Why they use whipped cream, Ball does not know, “No clue, my mom’s the one that does it; I just do it for her.” The art is supposed to represent what they want for the coming year. Another BHS student, Alivia Johnson goes to her uncle’s house to watch old recordings of Ultimate Fighting Championship or UFC fights with her extended family. She does not know how or why this tradition started, but she is thankful for the time with her family. At the end of the night, they light fireworks to welcome the new year.\n\nThough it may seem that there are many similarities in how people celebrate the holidays, every family has something that is their own. It is eye-opening and interesting to discover the unique and obscure traditions that bring different families happiness during the holidays.\n\nDancing Their Way Through Life 2021-2022\n\n​Charly Dixon\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe Bonneville High School Ballroom team has had a productive season so far. On January 29, 2022, Gold team, the most advanced of the three ballroom teams, had a competition in Provo, Utah and performed a latin medley, for which they scored 15 out of 17. The medley is a new dance they have been learning and is five minutes long, which is much length wise than the routines they are used to. The team hopes to have more confidence in upcoming competitions, work more as a team, pay attention to the audience, and always have a smile on their faces.\n\nBraedon Bird has been in ballroom for about five years. He joined ballroom because his sister was doing it, and he thought it would be a good idea. He did it for a year and did not enjoy it, so he quit. He tried out again his freshman year, made the team, and has done it ever since. In an interview with team captain Braedon Bird when asked about his favorite dance, Bird responded, “My favorite dance would have to be Tron [from] my sophomore year. It was one of the coolest dances I have ever done.” When the team performed Tron at the Civic Auditorium, they wore amazing glow-in-the-dark costumes.\n\nSenior and team captain Caisha Wells was also interviewed and was asked some similar questions. When asked what the hardest dance she has learned is, Wells responded, “Probably our latin medley that we are doing this year, it is a lot of work.” One of her favorite dances is You Are the Reason, one of the cabaret she did her freshman year. When asked about the difference between ballroom and ordinary dance, Wells responded, “Well, you have a partner and that is a lot harder. You have to work together, but if you mess up they don’t know if you are going to fix it, you just have to fix it together.” Ballroom depends on trust between partners to know and be able to perform the routines.\n\nBallroom works really hard every day at these dances. They have a lot of talents because they have to learn so many dances and memorize all of them. The team has several competitions left this season. Their next performance is the Utah Classic Competition on February 18 and 19. It takes place from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m Friday and 8:00 a.m. through 11:00 p.m. Saturday at the Legacy Events Center in Farming, Utah. Go support the Bonneville Ballroom Team!\n\nWhat is GSA? 2021-2022\n\nMakenna Goertzen\n\nStaff Writer\n\nAs the number of LGBTQ+ students increase, high schools across the country are finding ways to support their students. Various high schools are implementing what is known as Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA). The first GSA club was founded in 1988 in Massachusetts, and the first GSA network of clubs was created in 1988, based in San Francisco. The first GSA club established at Bonneville High school was created in 2014 according to Mr. Haack - the GSA advisor at Bonneville. GSA has continued every year from 2014 to 2021. A GSA club aims to create a safe place for LGBTQ+ students at school, teaches LGBTQ+ historical and current events, and tries to improve the lives of community members.\n\nUnfortunately, Bonneville’s GSA was disbanded in 2020 as an effect of the COVID-induced split lunches. In an interview with Mr. Haack, he expressed his belief that a GSA would benefit Bonneville by “creating a network of support for a group of students that has a much higher abuse and suicide rate than most of their peers.” In an estimate made by The Trevor Project nearly 2,647,755 LGBTQ+ youth from ages, 13 to 18 and approximately 2,529,117 from ages 19 to 24 have attempted suicide (www.thetrevorproject.org). Haack also mentioned benefiting the community “through our [GSA’s] service projects, advocacy, and outreach through the Idaho Falls Pride Organization.” The Idaho Falls Pride Organization is a “non-profit organization to create an environment in which LGBTQ+ businesses and professionals can thrive through the sharing of knowledge and resources” (idahofallspride.com). Before the Bonneville GSA broke up, the group had plans to “finds ways to make Bonneville a more comfortable place for LGBTQ+ students.” In addition, Haack mentioned that the club was planning to “ help with the festivities at the Idaho Falls’ annual Pride Festival and parade, petition Idaho legislators to fight for LGBTQ+ rights and do community service projects at Bonneville and in the local community.” Haack hopes that in at least five years that he could see “the GSA formed again, and see students meeting not just to socialize, but to learn about their history and rights, advocate for others and LGBTQ+ rights, and do community service to help others and try to remove the stigma from LQBTQ+ people.”\n\nHaack states he is open to reestablishing the GSA and he would be happy to be the advisor again. He would also like community members to know that GSA has and can be exceptionally beneficial for the mental health of the members. He explains that it is not a place where gender identity or sexual preference is pushed onto anyone, despite what some may say online. The club looks critically at historical and current events to teach members what LGBTQ+ rights they should fight for, and what straight/cis people can do to support the community. If any are interested in possibly reestablishing this club, contact Mr. Owen, Mr. Jolley, or Mr. England and let them know. Huge thanks to the wonderful Mr. Haack for letting The Buzz interview him to learn a little bit more about what a GSA is.\n\nWe Need Sleep! 2021-2022\n\nAna Grover\n\nStaff Writer\n\nHigh school grants many new freedoms for many kids: driver’s licenses, later curfews, and staying out with friends. High school also introduces more responsibilities, such as homework, studying, and jobs. These new activities often lead to teenagers receiving less sleep. According to a recent survey of 150 Bonneville students, 72% do not receive the recommended 8-10 hours of sleep. The average BHS student receives only 6.4 hours of sleep every school night and 7.9 hours on the weekend!\n\nSleep deprivation can be detrimental to a teenager’s life inside and outside of school. Mood, behavior, memory, reaction time, and academic performance can all be affected by a lack of sleep; teens are also more likely to engage in dangerous activities such as drowsy driving. According to Stanford Children’s Hospital, a teenager has a change in their internal clock once they reach a certain age. This makes it more difficult for them to fall asleep before 11 p.m. if they do not already have good sleep routines. When they lose sleep, they may try to make it up on weekends by sleeping in more, but this could be even more damaging. By the time Monday rolls back around, it will be even harder to wake up in time to get to school. Some students rely on energy drinks to stay awake during the day, but this can make their quality of sleep plunge even further. Caffeine makes it even harder to fall asleep (CDC).\n\nSome teenagers believe that it is impossible to return to a regular sleep schedule; nine students mentioned that they are so used to it that it does not affect them anymore. Junior Carley Hunting said, “I get through it. It's just life.” This state of mind can be even more destructive than the lack of sleep itself.\n\nWhen high school students do not get enough sleep, it is noticeable, especially to teachers. In a survey of 173 BHS teachers and students, the most common time to wake up for school was 7:00 a.m. That means that to get the minimum 8 recommended hours of sleep, the average student has to fall asleep by 11:00 p.m.; some students fall asleep as late as 5:00 a.m.! Only 2.7% of the surveyed students reported that they were never tired during school. Some students even make it a competition to see who can get the least amount of sleep. English teacher Mike Grummert said, “Many of them like to compete in some sort of weird competition of self-destruction. Student #1: ‘I went to bed at 2!’ Student #2: ‘I didn't go to bed until 6!’” It should not be an accomplishment to stay up well into the morning; this is harmful to one’s social and academic life.\n\nTry out some tips to get better sleep! Oversleeping on the weekends causes more damage than help and makes waking up early on Monday even harder. Put your phone in another room before you go to bed, do not drink caffeine in the evening, and aim to go to bed before 11:00 p.m. Sweet dreams!\n\nThe Zoo Opening 2020-2021\n\nMaycee Todd\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe Idaho Falls Zoo, also known as, Tautphaus Park Zoo, opened once again in early may. Even though they are running out of staff members, they need help. They reach out every year to see who can help get everything going after Idaho’s long winters, they usually have a group of communities who devote their time to help, but this year alone, they had a large number of volunteers and community services to help with cleaning and setting up, which brought down stress for time management. One thing they feel is strongly important is the fact they are a nonprofit corporation, which most likely makes it hard to stay afloat and clean up after this long quarantine, which almost everyone can agree on. Luckily many people, especially kids and families love the zoo and wanted to give back to the community. With Covid still on their minds, this made the zookeeper, as well as the owner, very hesitant on when a good time would be to open back up, they are also scared about how people would react to such a public place being opened, but now they are more loved than ever. With this recent long pandemic, everyone missed many activities last summer in 2020, now that they have the chance, the zoo is one of the first options for summer activities in Idaho Falls. Tautphaus Park Zoo is an attraction to people who enjoy learning more about, and seeing the animals, and people who have taken a liking to the animals. They are adding more animals over this next year like monkeys. The zoo is gaining more zookeepers because of the lack-of members as well. They also have a good structure and system, their main focus on the community and animals is safety, they focus on things like the environment and understanding of endangered animals. The zoo makes sure to have many trash cans to reduce litter and other things that could harm the animals. They have spent a lot of time doing research on these animal habitats, which can be a good reason to go over there and visit some of their zookeepers, and animals.\n\nSecond Impeachment 2020-2021\n\nJeramiah Fuger\n\nAssistant Editor\n\nAfter the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, history was made as former President Donald J. Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives for a second time. Last time, the House impeached him on two charges, Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. This time, however, the former president was only charged with one article of impeachment, Incitement of Insurrection.\n\nThere were many differences between these two instances. During the first impeachment trial, The House voted completely along party lines, meaning that all Democrats voted to impeach, and all Republicans voted to not charge the president. It was also almost the exact same story in the Senate, the only deviant being Senator Mitt Romney, making for the most partisan votes in all of American history. This time though, it was a different story. This time, it was the most bipartisan vote in decades, where, in the House, a whopping 10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump. The most notable of these bipartisan voters being Liz Cheney, Daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Though, problems arose for the impeachment managers a week after the House vote, as President Trump's presidential term officially ended, and Joe Biden was sworn in as president.\n\nOnce the Article of Impeachment reached the Senate, the first issue that Senate Republicans had was whether or not that impeaching a former president was constitutional or not. It was eventually decided that it was indeed constitutional, as he was impeached in the House of Representatives while he was still in office.\n\nOne of the biggest moments from the second impeachment trial was that the Senate voted to indeed have witnesses in the trial, however, the House Impeachment Managers struck a deal with Senate Republicans, and instead of hearing witness testimony, multiple videos from the day of the riot were officially entered as evidence in the trial. This deal ultimately ended the trial, as the vote to convict or acquit the former president commenced soon after. While the majority of the Senate voted to convict the president, with 7 Republicans joining the Democrat effort, making it 57-43, the required two thirds majority was not met, and therefore, Donald Trump was acquitted a second time. Since he was acquitted, there was no vote on whether or not to bar Trump from holding public office again, meaning he could run in 2024.\n\nSchool Shooting Safety 2020-2021\n\nMakenna Goertzen\n\nStaff Writer\n\nOn Thursday, May 6 2021 it was announced that there had been a school shooting at Rigby Middle School, three victims were transported to the hospital. Two students and one custodian. None of the victims had fatal injuries. Sadly this is not a rare occasion in the United States. The number of school shootings has increased over the past couple of years. Safety should be the top priority in schools today, but are schools doing enough to keep students safe? This subject has been talked about for years, yet not much is being done. Many students are on high alert, especially now that these nightmares are happening so close to home. Yes, students are taught lockdown drills and are being told to check in with each other. Even though drills are practiced, they are not being practiced as much as they should be. Students at several different schools are practicing fire drills every month but only have a lockdown drill once or twice a school year. Drills should be practiced and talked about more often than ever now that shootings are no longer rare situations.\n\nAnother thing that school officials, as well as parents and students, are not completely aware of are warning signs, distress signals, and serious mental health problems. Unfortunately, several school shootings were caused by a student or students from that exact school. More often than not that student had extremely unstable mental health, most likely due to bullying, a bad home environment, or many other factors. School officials and students should be taught or at least be aware of distress signs. It has been proven that shooters often hint at or give off signs that they are going to do something days before the actual incident. If those signs are taken seriously, maybe some of these incidents could be avoided. Parents should be checking in on their children, and assuring that their weapons are put in a place where their child can not get them. Even so, with that being said, it is not a perfect world. Numerous other elements contribute to school shootings, and a lot of those problems are hard to address. Shootings are still going to happen, and it is up to communities, school officials, parents, students, and so many others to figure what the best route is to take to combat this problem. Remember to stay safe and be aware of these issues. If anything seems or looks alarming, talk to a trusted adult.\n\nWorld Sleep Day 2020-2021\n\nKimmie Barnes\n\nCopy Editor\n\nSleep. A time when reality gets left behind and the body resets. Some love sleep and can not seem to get enough, and others dread when they have to return to their thoughts. Whether or not the feelings for sleep are positive or negative, sleep is healthy for everyone.\n\nSleep is a topic that has many odd and interesting facts. Here are just a few:\n\n12 percent of people dream entirely in black and white.\n\nIt is very common for deaf people to use sign language in their sleep.\n\nThe sensation of falling when half asleep and jerking awake is called hypnic jerks.\n\nWithin five minutes of being awake, 50 percent of a dream has been forgotten.\n\nGiraffe’s only need a little over an hour of sleep everyday.\n\nTiredness hits a climax twice a day. Once at two am and two pm.\n\nStaying up all night reduces the ability to learn and retain information by 40 percent.\n\nFriday, March 19, 2021 is World Sleep Day. World Sleep Day is put on by the World Sleep Society. This year will be the 14th annual anniversary of this celebration that started in 2008. The slogan for this year is “Regular Sleep, Healthy Future.”\n\nHere are the ten steps to achieve healthy sleep recommended by the World Sleep Society.\n\n1. Set a certain bedtime and waking up time.\n\n2. If in the habit of taking a nap, do not exceed 45 minutes of daytime sleep.\n\n3. Avoid excessive alcohol ingestion four hours before going to sleep.\n\n4. Avoid caffeine six hours before bedtime. This includes coffee, soda, certain teas, and some types of chocolate.\n\n5. Avoid heavy, spicy, or sugary foods two hours before bedtime.\n\n6. Exercise regularly, but not right before bed.\n\n7. Make sure the bed is comfy, invest in good bedding.\n\n8. Keep the bedroom a comfortable temperature and good air flow.\n\n9. Block out any and all distractions and as much light as possible.\n\n10. Reserve the bed for sleep and only sleep. Do not let the bed become a home office.\n\nSleep is a very vital thing in life. It is the body’s time to reset and take a break. Getting good sleep reduces the risk of many health issues and increases productivity and success. Now this does not mean that all of these steps have to be followed 24/7. It is important to stay out late, enjoy a midnight snack, and have fun nighttime adventures, but it is equally important to get a good healthy sleep as much as possible. Going to bed can either be looked forward to all day or it can be avoided for as long as possible. Either way, the body needs a break, the mind needs to reboot, and dreamland needs to be explored. This World Sleep Day pull some extra z’s, take a nap, and make sure to get a good night's sleep. Happy Sleeping!\n\nSex Ed Bill 2020-2021\n\nMakenna Goertzen\n\nStaff Writer\n\nSex education has been deemed a taboo subject for many years. Parents and teachers have been hesitant to bring up sex education due to human reproduction being an awkward conversation or sex being seen as bad or sinful. On March 12, the Idaho house representatives approved a sex education bill that requires students to get parental approval before being able to take human sexuality classes. Parents would opt their kids into these classes instead of taking them out. This bill is called Ehart’s Sex Education bill. Barbra Ehart states “We are changing consent and saying that some topics are of such nature, I think all of the topics to be honest, that parents need to be involved.”. The bill splits sex education into two areas, sexual education, and human sexuality. The bill’s definition of sex education is the study of the anatomy and physiology of human reproduction. It then defines human sexuality as anything other than the anatomy and physiology of human reproduction such as the topics of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or even intimacy. No student will get human sexuality lessons unless their parents allow them to. For Sex Ed the parents will have to opt-out, the students are expected to learn those lessons unless their parents say they do not want their child exposed to those topics.\n\nThe bill is now being moved to the senate as the house republicans approved the bill. The house democrats disapproved of the bill, as they thought that it was unavoidable that busy parents or guardians would forget to fill out the form as well as it fails to understand the new century. Rep. Steve Berch D- believes that the bill would create higher numbers of unplanned pregnancies, more abortions, and more STDs. “The bill is not about parental consent… This bill is about fear of inflammatory content that no student in Idaho is being taught,” stated Rep. Steve Berch D. Regardless of Rep. Steve Berch D. and other democratic state representatives, the bill was still approved and will now go to the Senate.\n\nResource Used - idahostatejournal.com\n\nEmergency Gubernatorial Powers 2020-2021\n\nJeramiah Fuger\n\nAssistant Editor\n\nOver the past few months, Idaho state legislators have been relentlessly attempting to limit Republican Governor Brad Little’s emergency powers. This came after many of Little’s fellow Republican lawmakers deemed that his actions to try to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic were an abuse of his gubernatorial powers.\n\nAround this time last year, Governor Brad Little issued a “Stay at Home'' order, meaning that Idahoans were only allowed to leave their homes for essential jobs, medical reasons, or going to the store for essentials. This was first of many drastic actions to try and contain the virus, however, Littles actions would turn the majority of Idaho lawmakers against him. Currently, since the pandemic started, around 25 pieces of legislation concerning the state of Idaho's response to the Coronavirus, and how they will handle future emergencies, have been introduced, 8 of which are directly aimed at limiting the governor's emergency powers. Whilst many have since died, a major bill has been making its way through the Idaho Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nOn Friday, March 12, a significant piece of legislation that limits the governor's powers during a man-made emergency, such as a terrorist attack, passed through the Idaho Senate with a 27-7 vote. Senate majority leader Kelly Anthon said this during a debate on the matter on the senate floor, “...and then, without limitation, ad infinitum, forever and ever maintain that power and overturn the law, declare martial law, and exercise government by the military without ever calling upon the Legislature to consider the issue?” To put it simply, he is saying that the governor should NOT be able to declare an emergency without the state congress first debating the matter and voting on any emergency action taken. The core reason that many lawmakers in Idaho support this bill, is because they view the state's current process as a “relic from the Cold War that concentrates too much power in the executive branch.” Opponents of the bill claim that the process of getting a bill passed takes too long in the case of a state-wide emergency. Even this bill has been through the political ringer, bouncing back and forth between the House and the Senate, as all bills usually do.\n\nIn reality, during a crisis event, it is imperative that action be taken quickly. While the governor's powers were outdated, the time it takes to call the Idaho congress into session, debate the matter, and be approved by both the House and the Senate takes far too long, and could prove detrimental.\n\nZack Synder's Justice League 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\nIn March 1960, the superheroes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter all joined for the first time in comic book history as the Justice League. In the years since then, fans have awaited a cinematic portrayal of the legendary superhero team. Animated series and films dominated as major platforms for the characters to appear in and live-action films only ever acted as standalones, such as the Dark Knight Trilogy. In 2013, filmmaker Zack Snyder released the long-awaited Superman reboot, Man of Steel. Three years later, Snyder wrote and directed the next entry in his new cinematic universe, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Not only did the film introduce Batman and Wonder Woman into the “Snyderverse,” but it also teased appearances from Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg. It was at this time that Snyder was ready to begin production on the third entry of his story, Justice League. Production took place in 2016, but unfortunately, Snyder stepped down from the project after the death of his daughter. Warner Brothers then hired filmmaker Joss Whedon to finish the film in post-production. However, large portions of the film were reshot and rewritten according to the likings of Whedon and the studio. Upon release in 2017, the film was heavily criticized by fans and critics for its lackluster plot and for the fact that it disrespected the original vision of Zack Snyder. For two years, fans called for the studio to release the unaltered version of the film by using the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Snyder was vocal about his desire to release the film and even confirmed that his version existed. Finally, during an online viewing of Man of Steel during the Covid-19 pandemic, Snyder announced that Zack Snyder’s Justice League would debut on HBO Max in 2021. Upon the four hour long film’s release, it was praised by fans and critics as one of the greatest DC films of all time. Desperate for Zack Snyder’s vision to be realized further, fans took to the internet once more with the hashtag #RestoreTheSnyderVerse. Although Warner Brothers shot down the chance of future involvement with Snyder, the campaign continues to move forward, garnering more followers daily. Even if Zack Snyder never gets the chance to make more films in the DC Extended Universe, it is an achievement of the film industry that his true vision was finally realized.\n\nMilo's Madness 2020-2021\n\nMilo Andrus\n\nStaff Writer\n\nNothing exists. Anything that has existed no longer exists and anything that will exist will someday no longer exist. Things like fossils did not exist until someone found them making them exist. Something only exists if it is in the present and is active in everyone's life today. Unfortunately, nothing can handle the tests of time so therefore nothing exists. Someone who is alive and moving around the planet today does not exist due to the fact that they one day will not be here. Same thing with cities, statues and landscapes. Cities have old buildings torn down and replaced by new ones. Streets and structures are constantly changing therefore the reality someone sees does not exist. Statues and ancient artifacts that have held the test of time will one day fall for nothing can stand against the test of time therefore making everything else obsolete and fake. Even the landscape, the largest mountains, deepest valleys, and longest canyons will always change and will never be the same making them unreal and nonexistent. Everything that is perceived through your own mind's eye is different from what someone else sees. For the way everyone perceives the world around them varies exponentially from person to person. Making what someone else views compared to someone else unreal, because their reality is their true way of looking at things. Meaning that what someone views for them self is fake and nonexistent to everyone else besides them. Even though things will forever change, some fail to embrace that their reality is slowly crumbling around them. The fact that everything around them does not exist and only temporary in the ever-changing world everyone lives in. Some fear it, others ignore it, while some embrace it. Staring into the cosmos and realizing how small and insignificant someone may be makes them realize how ever changing the universe is and that brings them back to the reality that nothing exists.\n\nMore Star Wars?? 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\n​Staff Writer\n\n​In February of 2020, Lucasfilm Limited released the long-awaited seventh season to the immensely popular animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The seventh and final season received critical acclaim and gave an overwhelming sense of closure to the fans of the beloved series. But while the future stories of characters such as Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex may be told in projects like Star Wars: Rebels, the stories of a few characters introduced in the seventh season have only just begun. Clone Force 99, otherwise known as the Bad Batch, will arrive in their very own series in 2021 that will act as both a spin-off and a sequel to The Clone Wars titled Star Wars: The Bad Batch. The series will debut on the streaming service Disney Plus and is created by the legendary Star Wars storyteller Dave Filoni. The series stars Dee Bradley Baker as all five clones in the Bad Batch: Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo. Each member of the special clone force has been genetically altered to enhance certain abilities such as strength or perception, and they must find their way through a rapidly changing galaxy taking place after the climactic events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, in which the Galactic Republic is reformed into the evil Galactic Empire. As the Bad Batch encounters all kinds of dangerous enemies such as the Empire, they will come into contact with the mercenary Fennec Shand. She will be voiced by Disney Legends Award winner Ming-Na Wen, who is reprising her role as Shand from the hit television series The Mandalorian. This animated series is clearly an honorary sequel to The Clone Wars and fans are thrilled for it. A release date has yet to be confirmed, but fans can expect the series to hit Disney Plus sometime in the first half of 2021. With the third season of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett to soon begin production, fans can find solace in this new series and will wait patiently for all new content from an era of Star Wars that they love.\n\nMarvel's Upcoming Slate 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\nNot even Thanos could have predicted that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be as popular as it is now. With the release of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019, the Infinity Saga and the first three phases of the MCU came to an end. The stories of Iron Man, Captain America, and many others were resolved and the focus was promised to shift towards new fan favorite characters. It was also revealed that after 11 years of big screen stories, many new projects would be filmed as television series meant to be released on the new streaming service Disney Plus. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus halted the release of the upcoming projects and fans were forced to go through 2020 without any new MCU projects. Luckily, Kevin Feige, the president and primary creator of the MCU, and his team were able to complete post-production on many series and began to release them in January 2021.\n\nPhase 4 kicked off with WandaVision, which stars Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as a seemingly undead Vision after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The series follows the newlywed couple through different time periods and pays homage to the sitcoms of those eras. The series was immensely popular among fans of the MCU because of its many surprises and originality in a period of superhero fatigue in Hollywood. But WandaVision was just the beginning of a long line of projects awaiting release. Once Wanda’s story ended, Marvel released the ongoing series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, who received Captain America’s shield at the end of Phase 3, and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes. The series follows the titular characters as they battle a terrorist group known as the Flag Smashers, reunite with the villainous Helmut Zemo, and face off against John Walker, played by Wyatt Russell, who has taken upon himself the title and mantle of Captain America. Once the series ends on April 23, Tom Hiddleston will return to the MCU once again in his very own series Loki, which also stars Owen Wilson. Although the character technically perished in Avengers: Infinity War, the series follows the Loki of a different reality set up in Avengers: Endgame as he travels throughout time. Other upcoming series include Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Secret Invasion, Ironheart, Armor Wars, and many others.\n\nOn the theatrical side of the MCU, Scarlett Johansson will return as Natasha Romanoff in Black Widow on July 9. Phase 4 will not simply revisit existing characters, however, as manifested by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Eternals, which both release in 2021. Tom Holland will reprise his role as Peter Parker in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which also stars Zendaya and Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange. In fact, Cumberbatch will also star in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in 2022, which Elizabeth Olsen will also star in. Other films in development include Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther II, a sequel to Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy: VOL. 3, and a film featuring the Fantastic Four. After a year without any MCU projects released, fans will certainly be pleased with the upcoming slate of films and television series. Marvel is inevitable.\n\nMore Star Wars?? 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\n​ In February of 2020, Lucasfilm Limited released the long-awaited seventh season to the immensely popular animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

Each member of the special clone force has been genetically altered to enhance certain abilities such as strength or perception, and they must find their way through a rapidly changing galaxy taking place after the climactic events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, in which the Galactic Republic is reformed into the evil Galactic Empire. As the Bad Batch encounters all kinds of dangerous enemies such as the Empire, they will come into contact with the mercenary Fennec Shand. She will be voiced by Disney Legends Award winner Ming-Na Wen, who is reprising her role as Shand from the hit television series The Mandalorian. This animated series is clearly an honorary sequel to The Clone Wars and fans are thrilled for it. A release date has yet to be confirmed, but fans can expect the series to hit Disney Plus sometime in the first half of 2021. With the third season of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett to soon begin production, fans can find solace in this new series and will wait patiently for all new content from an era of Star Wars that they love.\n\nMarvel's Upcoming Slate 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\nNot even Thanos could have predicted that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be as popular as it is now. With the release of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019, the Infinity Saga and the first three phases of the MCU came to an end. The stories of Iron Man, Captain America, and many others were resolved and the focus was promised to shift towards new fan favorite characters. It was also revealed that after 11 years of big screen stories, many new projects would be filmed as television series meant to be released on the new streaming service Disney Plus. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus halted the release of the upcoming projects and fans were forced to go through 2020 without any new MCU projects. Luckily, Kevin Feige, the president and primary creator of the MCU, and his team were able to complete post-production on many series and began to release them in January 2021.\n\nPhase 4 kicked off with WandaVision, which stars Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as a seemingly undead Vision after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The series follows the newlywed couple through different time periods and pays homage to the sitcoms of those eras. The series was immensely popular among fans of the MCU because of its many surprises and originality in a period of superhero fatigue in Hollywood. But WandaVision was just the beginning of a long line of projects awaiting release. Once Wanda’s story ended, Marvel released the ongoing series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, who received Captain America’s shield at the end of Phase 3, and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes. The series follows the titular characters as they battle a terrorist group known as the Flag Smashers, reunite with the villainous Helmut Zemo, and face off against John Walker, played by Wyatt Russell, who has taken upon himself the title and mantle of Captain America. Once the series ends on April 23, Tom Hiddleston will return to the MCU once again in his very own series Loki, which also stars Owen Wilson. Although the character technically perished in Avengers: Infinity War, the series follows the Loki of a different reality set up in Avengers: Endgame as he travels throughout time. Other upcoming series include Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Secret Invasion, Ironheart, Armor Wars, and many others.\n\nOn the theatrical side of the MCU, Scarlett Johansson will return as Natasha Romanoff in Black Widow on July 9. Phase 4 will not simply revisit existing characters, however, as manifested by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Eternals, which both release in 2021. Tom Holland will reprise his role as Peter Parker in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which also stars Zendaya and Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange. In fact, Cumberbatch will also star in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in 2022, which Elizabeth Olsen will also star in. Other films in development include Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther II, a sequel to Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy: VOL. 3, and a film featuring the Fantastic Four. After a year without any MCU projects released, fans will certainly be pleased with the upcoming slate of films and television series. Marvel is inevitable.\n\nMilo's Madness 2020-2021\n\nMilo Andrus\n\nStaff Writer\n\nNothing exists. Anything that has existed no longer exists and anything that will exist will someday no longer exist. Things like fossils did not exist until someone found them making them exist. Something only exists if it is in the present and is active in everyone's life today. Unfortunately, nothing can handle the tests of time so therefore nothing exists. Someone who is alive and moving around the planet today does not exist due to the fact that they one day will not be here. Same thing with cities, statues and landscapes. Cities have old buildings torn down and replaced by new ones. Streets and structures are constantly changing therefore the reality someone sees does not exist. Statues and ancient artifacts that have held the test of time will one day fall for nothing can stand against the test of time therefore making everything else obsolete and fake. Even the landscape, the largest mountains, deepest valleys, and longest canyons will always change and will never be the same making them unreal and nonexistent. Everything that is perceived through your own mind's eye is different from what someone else sees. For the way everyone perceives the world around them varies exponentially from person to person. Making what someone else views compared to someone else unreal, because their reality is their true way of looking at things. Meaning that what someone views for them self is fake and nonexistent to everyone else besides them. Even though things will forever change, some fail to embrace that their reality is slowly crumbling around them. The fact that everything around them does not exist and only temporary in the ever-changing world everyone lives in. Some fear it, others ignore it, while some embrace it. Staring into the cosmos and realizing how small and insignificant someone may be makes them realize how ever changing the universe is and that brings them back to the reality that nothing exists.\n\nThe Walls Have Ears 2020-2021\n\nAshlyn McCowin\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe world is full of weird conversations. Especially when some phrases are taken out of context. Here are some that The Buzz staff have heard.\n\n“Is this Brazil soup?”\n\n“Well personally I don't like that my skeleton is wet.”\n\n“Dude that was my knee string!”\n\n“The kid comes with!”\n\n“It’s not cannibalism if it’s delicious!”\n\n“Does your trash can require batteries?”\n\n“Honestly it’s called he cheated on me.”\n\n“I already checked, I wasn’t breathing.”\n\n“It was great till the earth started breathing.”\n\n“Honey you got grandma knees.”\n\n“Did you call me a hot pocket?”\n\n“You have tiny knees.”\n\n“Just call me redneck and let me be.”\n\n“I want some pristine food… What type of soups y’all got?”\n\n“I just ended the Cold War.”\n\n“Sponsored by my grandma's life insurance.”\n\n“2 pounds of suckers”\n\n“bruh your aura is just like how you smell.”\n\n“You’ve never seen a crackhead before?”\n\n“Can I spit on your leg?”\n\n“If you think about it, Phantom of the Opera and Finding Nemo have the same plot.”\n\n“Man killed his brother for soup.”\n\n“Obama's last name is Karen.”\n\n“Irish makes me cry.”\n\n“Star wars is a verb.”\n\n“Can Danny Devito please dress up as a goat?”\n\nMay 14, 2021 2020-2021\n\nEd Perez\n\nStaff Writer\n\nStar Wars fans get ready, because Lucas films, and Disney have created a new show called The Bad Batch. It takes place right after the Clone Wars, and starts off with meeting the group, known as Clone force 99. The scene starts with clones fighting droids, and the clones are getting pushed back, until reinforcement comes. The Bad Batch comes and save the clones, and the jedi with their padawan. The names of these heroes are Wrecker, Crosshair, Tech, Echo, and the leader, Hunter. The clones get a call from the emperor himself to kill the Jedi, and its Padawan. They turn on the Jedi and its Padawan who is watching their master get killed. The Padawan does not trust the Bad Batch, even though they did not know, and were not trying to kill them. The padawan gets away, and they head back to base where they find out what is happening. The clones all have a chip that controls how they act. They are programmed to follow any order, and do it no matter what. Clone force 99, figures out they are defective to these commands, but as the show goes on crosshair starts acting different. As the group is waiting for their next mission, they meet a young girl named Omega. She too is a defect clone, and starts to get to know the group. They get their next mission call to go take out a platoon of droids, but when they get there they find out they are not droids. Instead they find a group of people and decide not to shoot. They talk to the people and find out their heir on the run as the Galactic Empire is taking over the clones. Group 99 finds out their mission was being recorded, and they figure out something is up, so they decide to go back and get Omega. When they get back, they are not welcome and they are thrown into a prison. They take Crosshair and take him to get his chip heightened. As this is going on the group finds a way to break out, and start heading for their ship. They are almost at the ship when Crosshair comes and tries to stop them. They get away and decide to find somewhere to get help. They go to a distant planet where an old friend is living with his family. The group needs help as they are now deserters, as is the family. Their family decided they were going to move locations, and leave on a shuttle, when things took an unexpected turn. They need something called a J-code, in which they do not have nor can they get. Group 99 resolves this situation and steals 5 codes, 4 for the family and 1 for Omega. As the family is boarding the ship, The Bad Batch is fighting their way out, when they see Omega has decided she wants to stay with the group, and that is exactly what she does. Star Wars fans are dying for the next episode, and just want to see their favorite group The Bad Batch.\n\nFrick Anteaters 2020-2021\n\nAshlyn McCowin\n\nStaff Writer\n\nAnteaters, an animal named after what they eat. A gross, two feet long, tongued animal that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth. Anteaters spend most of their day eating ants and no one sees a problem with that. If any normal animal had a diet of ONE thing, they would be dead. If any regular human only ate 30,000 shrimp a day one would be worried about them, but anteaters can do anything they want. On top of that, imagine being such a useless animal all they do is slurp up ants their whole body has evolved to only eat ants. They have a gross head that all it looks like is a snout. They do not even have any teeth, only a gross slimy tongue that slurps up ants. Plus, anteaters can be up to six feet long and that is disgusting. That is it that is all anteaters do is sleep, claw at ant hills with their stupid claws, and then slurp up ants like it is healthy. Then people have the audacity to say they are cute when they are six feet long and stupid. They are useless animals, if they all went extinct, the world would not even feel a difference. There is a reason anteater are not in zoos, and it is because they are dumb animals that not even toddlers want to see. Anteaters are stupid and gross another useless animal that lives in South America. On top of that, anteaters honestly just copy kangaroos and use their tails as a back balance and slash at a human with their claws. This dumb thing can kill a human with one slash.\n\nOverall all Anteaters are dumb useless animals that spend their days clawing at anthills and slurping up ants. An animal that has only grown to develop a straw snout and look stupid. This six-foot dumb, animal lives to only eat ants to kill a human in a swipe. So honestly, no one would care if the anteater went extinct.\n\nCalifornia v. Idaho 2020-2021\n\nMark Cooper\n\nStaff Writer\n\n​ In the few recent years, there has been a sudden urge to move to Idaho, especially to the humble citizens of California. This is evident according to usnews.com, which recorded that Idaho had 70% inbound migration which is the highest in the United States.\n\nWhen looking at this fact, it is almost a dead set possibility that there will be feuds between residents of Idaho on which state is the best. A big feud is between people from California, and the longtime residents of Idaho. So, it is only right to break down the pros and cons of each beautiful state.\n\nStarting off with the Golden State, California has many regions and different cultures within, allowing for an amazing tourist location. An individual can go to Southern California, where the temperatures are enough to cook an egg on the sidewalk, but also go to the beach at 8 in the morning, or a person might want to go to the North, where there are many beautiful forests, mountain ranges, and lakes. The only problem with going to SoCal or NoCal is the major Cities. In the South they have Los Angeles, which is by far the most popular, but most overpopulated and expensive. In Los Angeles it is common to find the homeless making their own separate cities along the street, walking around in questionable fashion, and berating their mindless comments to innocent bystanders. In the North there is San Francisco and Sacramento. San Francisco is an expensive mess, with the traffic being unimaginable. One can find some of the weirdest things on the streets here. One day there will be a few rats on the side of the road scavenging, and the other there will be a pile of old needles just waiting to be reused by another homeless person. Though the food in the Bay Area is good enough to make anyone forget the troubles they might see walking around. Sacramento is another story, where one drive through from a tourist can be a completely different experience from when one lives there. During the day tourists can go to Old Sac, which gives a good look on what life was like during the Gold Rush, with an old miner town completely refurbished. Right next to the town there is the National Train Museum, which is an amazing visit. However, once the tourist locations are left and one goes to see some of the city sights, a whole other look of the city will show. The crime being evident and the beautiful smell of sewage going through the air. But, if one can forget all the bad things about California's overpopulated, and insanely expensive cities, it can be an amazing trip.\n\nNow moving on to Idaho, where it is cold, empty, and heartless. In the small “cities” that are home to Idahoans, there is a somewhat peaceful grace upon them. Life is slow which is a good pace for old people who want to retire and live in peace. Someone can find the common redneck strolling through town in a loud and eye-catching truck, obviously symbolizing their need to compensate for something, while wearing a mullet that looks like it has not been washed since they last jumped in a mudhole in the middle of nowhere for fun. Once a person leaves the towns though is when Idaho's true sight can be seen. The nature in Idaho is unmatched, with massive mountain ranges and forests being open to the public and explorable. The sights of wild animals and the sunset over a completely empty tundra are eye opening, and truly connect one to the earth. The thought of seeing these truly gorgeous sights with clear air and an amazing sky are not really seen in California, which adds to the individuality of each state.\n\nKeeping the fight between each state in mind, sometimes the pros and cons of each state need to be analyzed before one can truly pick one. Idaho is an amazing place if someone loves nature and living a quiet lifestyle, while California is an amazing place for the people who enjoy the city life and enjoy a fast-paced life.\n\nCancel Culture 2020-2021\n\nMark Cooper\n\nStaff Writer\n\nIn this day and age, cancel culture is a big topic, and one that is able to take people out of fame almost entirely, or at least long enough for them to learn some sort of a lesson. Cancel culture is essentially the act of a large group of people exposing a person, group, or businesses past controversies. Some people who are canceled are able to make a comeback with many apologies and many events that show they have changed, while others will do their best but never seem to get whatever they did in the past or present off their back. In this sense, it sounds like a good idea, canceling people who have a big voice on social media when they are in the wrong or are spreading hate, but it is far from doing just that. Cancel culture continues to be used as a weapon to either cancel voices that go against a certain group's opinion, or being used to benefit another person. Examples of this could be a Professor at the University of Chicago, who made a comment on the Black Lives Matters movement of the popular “#defundthepolice”. Uhlig said that instead of defunding the police they should instead train them better. This led to many individuals saying he is a privileged white male who preys on the misfortune. Many people ended up signing a petition to make him resign from his position, which led to him getting placed on leave by the journal he ran. Oftentimes it is used for the dumbest reason to give some people attention, like when many people tried cancelling Paw Patrol, a kids cartoon with a police dog as one of the main characters, due to the BLM riots early on in 2020. Cancel culture has even been responsible for some minorities as the face for some food products like Aunt Jemimah Syrup being removed entirely, which basically removes minority faces of the shelves in many grocery stores around the United States. Now this is not to say that cancel culture is bad, but it needs to be improved extensively before it will be able to actually benefit anyone. It is really just a tool used to push a narrative that a certain group of people wants, and sometimes it does in fact work to push that narrative. But in the future, hopefully the foreseeable future, it may be a useful addition to our daily lives.\n\nPolitics in Entertainment 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\n​ Both Hollywood and the entertainment industry are not immune to severe criticism or scrutiny for including overt political themes in their films and television shows. There are many fans, critics, and cinephiles who view entertainment as an escape from reality. They watch films and television as a way to ignore their problems, relax, and enjoy their lives without the stress of the modern world breathing down their necks. While this practice of escapism is completely understandable and even fairly tempting, political themes and philosophical points are crucial to the way society grows and how lives are shaped in today’s world.\n\nIn the recently concluded Marvel series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Sam Wilson, who obtained Steve Roger’s shield at the end of Avengers: Endgame, struggles to take upon himself the mantle of Captain America. Not only does he feel a heavy burden in representing the United States in the Marvel Universe, but he must also tackle being a black man in the modern world. The series makes a deliberate effort to directly explore the realities of being a black man in the United States and how Sam learns to respect himself and become the new Captain America. While the series has been widely praised for including themes of racism, there is a very loud crowd of fans who have openly criticized these creative decisions. This crowd claims that the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the entertainment industry in general is no place to “shoehorn” political themes in its stories. As previously stated, they view cinema as a means to escape. In reality, the timely themes of racism in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier coincidentally line up perfectly with the Black Lives Matter movement that occurred in the summer of 2020. By including the story of a black man rising up to become Captain America, the showrunners of the series have spoken to thousands of black people in modern day America. This showcases the profound importance of political themes in storytelling.\n\nIncluding politics in modern media is a brilliant way to shed light on the problems that the world faces today. By making an effort to tell stories about difficult moral questions, people can begin to understand the perspective of others around them. Having a knowledge of these themes and lessons as a result of their inclusion in film and television can create a more kind, understanding society that recognizes the value of people around them. During his run writing Marvel comics, Stan Lee wrote columns in his issues known as Stan’s Soapbox. In his column for Avengers #74, Lee wrote, “Sure our tales can be called escapist - but just because something’s for fun, doesn’t mean we have to blanket our brains while we read it” (Stan’s Soapbox 1970). While stories are meant to capture the imagination of the reader, viewer, or player, they should also possess a lesson for humanity.\n\nMasks in Third Trimester 2020-2021\n\nMakenna Goertzen\n\nStaff Writer\n\n​Masks have become somewhat of a normal clothing item due to the Covid-19 pandemic that became very problematic in the United States around March of 2020. Bonneville has required students to wear masks as a safety precaution for most of the 2020- 2021 school year. The administration had been talking about masks being a choice for students and parents to make during the 3rd trimester. As of third trimester, masks are up to choice with the exception of teachers being able to enforce this rule in the classroom. The administration had sent out a survey to parents/guardians asking if the parents/guardians would like masks to be required for students or be left up to choice. There have been numerous opinions on the topic of masks, many students believe that masks are annoying and inconvenient, while others believe that masks are essential and needed for the protection of others.\n\nMasks have not been entirely effective, especially because most students do not use them correctly or choose not to wear them. Although, masks are better than nothing for protecting others with illnesses such as an autoimmune disorder. Students should be considerate of others and aware. On the other hand, kids and teenagers are at lower risk for being hospitalized or dying compared to older age groups leading to not much concern for teens. Keep in mind Covid is contagious and people must be wary of a teenager going home to an older household member, or a household member who has a serious pre-existing condition. Masks should be a choice, but students need to be aware that other people are more vulnerable or have a vulnerable member in that student’s, teacher’s, or staff member’s household. Students, as well as teachers and school staff, should be consistent with washing hands and respecting Covid safety guidelines. As an arguable subject, every person’s opinion is valuable and should be heard. Remember to be respectful and considerate when it comes to the safety of a student or that student’s household member. Whether or not masks continue to be required or not, just remember to be safe Bees!\n\nProm Opinions 2020-2021\n\nMcKinley Christiansen\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nBonneville’s prom, “A Night Under the Stars” is just around the corner! The simple achievement of getting to host prom is exciting in and of itself, but the theme and location add a lot to the table. People have been asking for weeks, and hopefully, there are not too many last minute askers staggering behind.\n\nA certain amount of opinion follows prom every year. Complaints of too many guys’ choice dances (from both the lads and ladies), opinions on stag participants, and day date trends are only a few examples.\n\nIn a typical (covid free) school year, there are two girls choice dances: Sadie Hawkins and Sweethearts. This leaves Homecoming, Winter Ball, and Prom to the guys. Some people find the additional guys choice dance unfair. Individuals would even claim it is sexist to follow the traditional dating ways involving males making the first move, planning, and funding the date. However, some things just stay the same, and that is okay. One extra guys choice dance will not hurt anyone. Students should feel free to choose if they will attend prom. If a guy does not want to deal with the stresses that come with asking someone to prom, then they can choose not to go. There is also freedom in the couple as well. Communicate with each other, decide what is preferable both for entertainment and finance. Even ladies still have the choice to attend, whether they chose to be non-traditional and ask themselves, or attend the dance stag.\n\nStag participants can also bring some minor controversy to the table. When an individual attends a dance “stag” it refers to going to the dance without a date. Often times, these are people who did not get asked to the dance. Some find going stag more fun than going with a date. There is more freedom and availability. However, others find it almost embarrassing to have to attend without a date. Stag is definitely meant for people with confidence and independence! There is nothing wrong with going solo and having a great time.\n\n​ Much of prom’s success rides on the day date before the dance. It is common practice for groups to have an activity during the day before heading to the actual party. Some people opt for a cheap, at home, DIY date, while others go for fancy dinners and pricey activities. Both can yield great experiences. The important thing is to spend time with each other and party.\n\nTheaters To Streaming 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\nMany things across the world have changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People’s lives will surely never be the same. One such difference resulting from all of the commotion in the world is the rise of streaming services. Of course, streaming was already extremely popular before the pandemic. Nonetheless, as the streaming wars began with the arrival of Disney Plus in late 2019, entertainment platforms were projected to lose money and decline in popularity. However, when the pandemic hit and the nationwide quarantine began, people locked in their homes had little to do other than watch films and television shows on streaming services. Slowly but surely, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, and several other platform’s subscription numbers increased. Despite not being able to visit local theaters, filmgoers had plenty of entertainment at the palm of their hands.\n\nEven a year later in 2021, theaters are nowhere near as popular as they once were. The population has largely turned their attention to streaming services rather than the cinemas. For example, YouTubers have finally begun to watch popular films and television series and record their reactions for their viewers. As new films continue to release both in theaters and on platforms, internet users may become more likely to record their reactions rather than visit the cinema in order to increase viewership. All of these new habits have shed light on the fact that movie theaters are a dying industry. As viewership of streaming services increases amidst the pandemic, fewer people visit the cinema. Surprisingly, as upsetting as it might seem to long-time fans of theaters and the memories made there, streaming services seem to be the next stage in modern day entertainment. Perhaps this is the way things should continue from this point on in order to increase viewership. Disney has certainly taken advantage of this new train of thought by releasing several of their new films on their streaming platform, such as Mulan, Soul, Raya and the Last Dragon, and the upcoming Pixar film Luca. Original series across all services have also had a dramatic increase in production and viewership, as exhibited by the hit series The Mandalorian, Marvel’s WandaVision, Marvel’s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Amazon Prime’s upcoming Lord of the Rings series, and many more.\n\nAs COVID-19 restrictions continue across the globe and cinemas remain closed, streaming services are dominating the entertainment industry and could potentially become the prime format of storytelling in the world. As history adjusted itself from plays to theaters in the past, streaming is certainly on track to become the next major activity for cinephiles. This is surely the route that must be taken in order to keep the industry alive and flourishing.\n\nFish as Pets 2020-2021\n\nKimmie Barnes\n\nCopy Editor\n\nFish, the small little creatures that swim around to pass the time and stay alive. From goldfish to betta fish these animals are a popular and very accessible pet to have. Pet fish are an easy buy. Although, those looking to buy a fish must be 18, the relative price for a fish, a tank or bowl, a decoration, and food is about 25 dollars give or take. So, who would not want to buy a small pal to keep company especially when they cost so little?\n\n​ Because fish are bought so often, many wonder if they are being treated humanely. Whether it is a concern on the size of the habitat, what food they are being fed, the quality of the water, or even if the fish come from a humanely sourced fish farmer. Many argue that fish do not belong in bowls. While most fish like goldfish or bettas are typically low maintenance, there are particular needs that they have. For instance both goldfish and betta fish need water conditioner and betta fish unless raised together cannot be in the same tank. They will attack and kill each other…fish fight night. Oftentimes when one decides to spontaneously buy a fish they tend to miss or overlook important details like that. Missing these details can be very detrimental towards the life of the fish. Another problem is the fact that if a fish is taken care of properly, it can live for a while. Fish are not typically seen as a long-lasting companion but they can be. For those who anticipate a short commitment of care, it can be hard to continue to keep up the proper care of the fishies when they have passed their expiration date so to speak. This usually unexpected longevity of the fish also leads to the release of goldfish into ponds, lakes, and rivers. It has actually become quite the problem in some areas around the world. While goldfish in bowls usually stay a small size, when released into the wild it is a different story. They are big eaters and take out many insects, other fish, and a lot of plant-life that native species feed on. Not only do they affect the food chain but, they also introduce new diseases and foreign parasites into their environments. Long story short, goldfish have become an invasive species, overran many bodies of water, and have wreaked havoc on many ecosystems.\n\nCommon pet fish like bettas and goldfish are low maintenance and easy pets to have but because of this popularity, it is even easier for them to be mistreated. While they seem like small insignificant creatures, which they kind of are, they still deserve to live life to the fullest and to be the happiest a fish can be. Before buying a pet fish, make sure to know what responsibility goes into their fishy life.\n\nGodzilla v. Kong 2020-2021\n\nGriffin Moeller\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe King of the Monsters, the Doom Inevitable, the Titanus Gojira himself: Godzilla. The legendary fictional titan has captivated audiences since his cinematic debut in 1954. The modern incarnation of the monstrous character was revealed in the 2014 film Godzilla and reappeared in 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Now in 2021, Godzilla must face off against one of the most popular beasts in the monster universe: Kong himself. Godzilla vs. Kong will be released in theaters on March 31st, but before audiences lay their eyes upon the modern version of this epic rivalry they must consider the strengths and weaknesses of both contenders. To say that Godzilla in 2021 is intimidating is a gross understatement. The modern Godzilla is about a towering height of 390 feet! If that is not enough to scare off an angry little gorilla, then perhaps the fact that Godzilla is a walking nuclear reactor will do the trick. That is right! Godzilla has the classic ability to project an atomic breath in the form of a massive laser beam. Surely Kong is no match for a giant beam of fire. Godzilla also has the advantage of being able to traverse through the oceans. His ability to sneak around the open waters and launch surprise attacks gives him a large advantage against the land-dwelling Kong. Godzilla’s special abilities will be helpful in his effort to beat Kong, but one of the best things that he has going for him is his appearance. He has massive spikes all along his spine, a dangerous and gargantuan tail, and his reptilian nature simply makes him a menacing figure to behold. Although Godzilla’s height, weight, and overall size makes him significantly slower than his opponent, his raw power and brute strength is enough to overpower Kong. Godzilla’s title of King gives him influential power over all of the other titans, so in order to make sure Kong does not steal his title to become King Kong, Godzilla must defeat him and seize the victory he deserves. The battle will not be easy, sacrifices will have to be made, but only one will come out on top and Godzilla is worthy of being the ultimate victor.\n\nMilo Andrus\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe Godzilla vs. Kong trailer did much more than just wash away doubts about Kong being able to hold his own and even win against a Titan as mighty as Godzilla. Prior to the trailer’s release, Godzilla was the heavy favorite to take home the glory and hold on to his crown, which he won after defeating Ghidorah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Kong was declared the winner in their original fight in Toho’s King Kong vs. Godzilla, but that hasn’t stopped fans from viewing him as the underdog in the Monster Verse’s rematch. Considering that Kong was less than a third of Godzilla’s size, it was difficult for fans to believe that any growth spurt would be enough to put him in Godzilla’s league. Even so, the Godzilla vs. Kong trailer has succeeded in altering perceptions about Kong’s capabilities. First of all, it should be noted that despite Godzilla’s reputation as a force to be reckoned with, it’s Kong who’s getting in most of the hits in the footage. Kong can be seen shoving Godzilla off the aircraft carrier and punching him across the face. Plus, Kong gets the best of Godzilla in the standoff at the end of the trailer. When Godzilla bombards him with his atomic breath, Kong blocks it with his axe and brings his weapon down on him. The trailer provides strong evidence that Kong can overcome the odds and defeat Godzilla. Of course, this shouldn’t be taken to mean that he will win, but the trailer does show viewers that Kong does indeed have what it takes to push Godzilla to the edge. Before the trailer was released, it was believed that the biggest obstacle Kong had in his way was Godzilla’s atomic breath. Kong’s greatest defense is also his best offense. The Godzilla vs. Kong trailer highlights Kong’s new weapon, an axe. Exactly what Kong needed to be a physical threat to Kong was a weapon that can cut into Godzilla’s thick hide. With Kong in possession of this strange new axe, it does appear that if Godzilla doesn’t fight at his best, he could end up losing more than just his position as alpha in Godzilla vs. Kong​\n\nNearby Haunts 2020-2021\n\n​Kimmie Barnes\n\nCo-Editor\n\nSpooky season is in full swing as Halloween approaches, and in the small town of Idaho Falls and neighboring towns there are plenty of activities to make the weekend exciting. One of the more popular among teens being haunted attractions.\n\nTrick-or-treating is a long-loved tradition of Halloween. Going out and collecting candy is something most everyone enjoys; however, quite a few people believe that teenagers are “too old” to ask for candy. Not to mention, many teens do not find trick-or-treating fun anymore. As a replacement, there are a variety of spooky places to visit this weekend.\n\nOut of many haunted attractions that surround Idaho Falls, the local haunt is Planet Doom, formerly known as Dr. Slaughters. It is the largest indoor haunted attraction in eastern Idaho, located right next to Bowl Ero on First Street. The last day they are open this month is October 30th, from 7 to 11p.m.\n\nTwo more popular haunted houses are The Lost Souls attractions in Shelley. The theater and hospital are found side by side and both have thrilling walk-throughs. The theater is said to be filled with more jumpscares, while the hospital is more of a creepy horror. They are open from 7p.m. to 12a.m. on both the 29th and 30th.\n\nLocated in Menan, The Haunted River is a newer attraction. Having only opened a few years ago, this family owned business dares to explore what happened across the river. The attraction takes between 45-60 minutes, and is open from 7:30 to 11p.m. on the 29th and 30th of October.\n\nVenturing farther out, The Haunted Mill, located in Teton, Idaho, is a 45 minute tour. A group goes through the four levels of the mill, an underground mine, a maze, a waterfall, a suspension bridge, and the space in between. It opens at 7:30p.m. and closes at 12a.m. this Friday and Saturday, October 29th and 30th.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the Bonneville Spook Alley! STUCO is putting on their own haunt in the main gym. It will be open October 26th to the 29th. The times are 4:30 to 7:30p.m. The cost is three dollars for a single and five for couples. Go check out the Spook Alley and support the Bonneville Student Council!\n\nHaunted attractions are great ways to spend Halloween weekend. These spooky places are very popular and lines tend to be long. Be ready for the wait and the horror to come!"
