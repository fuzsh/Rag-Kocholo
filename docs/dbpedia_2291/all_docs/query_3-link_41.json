        "text": "The Lake Family | James Lake Company (1850)\n\nPhilomena Smith Lake\n\n​4th Great Grandmother\n\nSamantha Lake Brimhall\n\n​3rd Great Grandmother\n\nJames Lake Jr.\n\n​4th Great Grandfather\n\nAnd yet, by waiting just two years, they were in a better position to heed God’s call, to serve and to lead others, and to ensure their own self-reliance in a time when the church had many destitute members to take care of in a land with limited resources. It’s a personal testimony to me of how God works with us individually- when some are called to “take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,” others are commanded to “prepared every needful thing” (3 Nephi 13:25, Doctrine and Covenants 88:119). Waiting can be a refiner’s fire, patience a builder or character. For “if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear” (Doctrine and Covenants 38:30)\n\nThe Steed Family | Milo Andrus Company (1850)\n\nCaroline Rebecca Holland Steed\n\n​5th Great Grandmother\n\nMary Ann Steed Hess\n\n​4th Great Grandmother\n\nThough she was well outfitted for the journey and joined together was a widowed father to make the journey easier for both families, Caroline had very little when she arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. She sold the outfit that had brought her across the plains, bought a small log cabin, and then had to find a way to feed and cloth her family. Though she was a beautiful seamstress, money and work were scarce, and she did her best with payments of farm produce and discarded clothing.\n\nEven still, when one of her Steed relations returned from the handcart rescue company with with his niece, Sarah Steed, Caroline took her in, bathing her and dressing her in her own clothes.\n\nShe would eventually sell her little log cabin to the church, the land of which lies under the Northwest Section of the Tabernacle in Temple Square.\n\nCaroline never remarried. She was self-reliant, hard working, and still had room to be generous. She would remain close to her children and posterity all of her life, with these words written on her grave upon her death: “Caroline Steed was a noble woman.”\n\nThe Argyle Family | Edmund Ellsworth Handcart Company (1856)\n\nRebecca Jane Finch Argyle\n\n​4th Great Grandmother\n\nMary Ann Argyle Standifird\n\n​3rd Great Grandmother\n\nJoseph Argyle Sr.\n\n​4th Great Grandfather\n\nJoseph was a tinner by trade. He had brought sufficient tools and a box of heavy tin in order to start a business in Salt Lake City. However, the company quickly discovered that the green wood of the newly built handcarts could not hold up to the rigors of the trail. After just two days time, Joseph set to work reinforcing the handcarts with his tin, ultimately using all of it to secure every handcart in the company over the course of their journey.\n\nIt took 109 days for them to walk the 1400 miles to the Salt Lake Valley. For six of those weeks, pregnant Rebecca carried her youngest child on a pillow in her apron because the little girl had become too ill to walk on her own. She nearly gave up, but the thought of protecting her helpless daughter and unborn child gave her the strength to keep going on her worst day.\n\nWithout having walked with them, knowing their remarkable story has made it part of my own. I feel a personal connection to the time of “the Restoration” and the history of my people and our faith. And I’ve considered what that should mean to me today.\n\nElder Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles reminds us to take part int he ongoing restoration. In the September 2020 Ensign, he said, “Sometimes we think of the Restoration of the gospel as something that is complete, already behind us—Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, he received priesthood keys, the Church was organized. In reality, the Restoration is an ongoing process; we are living in it right now. It includes ‘all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal,’ and the ‘many great and important things’ that ‘He will yet reveal’ (Articles of Faith 1:9)… When our time in mortality is complete, what experiences will we be able to share about our own contribution to this significant period of our lives and to the furthering of the Lord’s work?f Will we be able to say that we rolled up our sleeves and labored with all our heart, might, mind and strength? Or will we have to admit that our role was mostly that of an observer?” Or a descendant?\n\nAnd so I will try to take this to heart—How am I furthering the work of the Restoration today? How do I Hear Him to know what he would have me contribute? Do I have something to offer? Can I carry another? Am I listening and ready to act?\n\nNoah Brimhall | Handcart Rescue Company\n\nFamily Tree: Me > Mom > Grandpa Brimhall > Logan Brimhall > Norman Andrew Brimhall > Noah Brimhall"
