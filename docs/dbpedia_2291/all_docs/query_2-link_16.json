        "text": "Henry Eyring (1835-1902) was born on 9 March 1835, in Coburg, Sase-Coburg-Goth, Germany. His parents were well-to-do in Germany with good social connections. His father owned an apothecary business. Henry's mother died when he was but eight years of age, and soon after the father suffered great financial losses and died when Henry was fifteen. He had received a good start on an education by a private teacher before this happened. He became an apprentice in the drug business in Vienna for three years before he left with his sister Bertha for America.\n\nHe found employment in the drug business in St. Louis, Missouri. It was here that he heard Milo Andrus, a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and became interested in joining the religion. He was baptized on 11 March 1855. On 17 June 1855 he was made a priest by Erastus Snow. He was president of the Indian Territory Mission from 1855-1860.\n\nHe came to Utah in August 1860. En route he met Mary Bonneli, whom he married on 14 December 1860. They moved to St. George, Utah, in November 1862, having volunteered to do so in answer to a call from the LDS Church authorities.\n\nDuring 1874-1876 he served a mission for the LDS Church to Switzerland and Germany, after which he was counselor to the president of the St. George temple. At one time he was mayor of St. George for two years, and at other times he held different minor offices.\n\nOn 10 February 1887, he left with his family for Mexico, at the invitation of Erastus Snow, to join other members of the LDS Church there. He learned Spanish, the customs and laws of Mexico, and cultivated the acquaintance of the leading men of the nation. He took charge of his church's missionary activities in lower Mexico. On his return to Juarez, he took charge of the cooperative store there.\n\nThe Mexican Mission was organized in the fall of 1891, George Teasdale as president, Alexander F. MacDonald, and Henry Eyring as counselors. In December 1895, the settlements were organized as the Juarez Stake, with Anthony W. Ivins as president, Henry Eyring, and Helaman Pratt as counselors.\n\nHenry Eyring died on the 10 February 1902."
