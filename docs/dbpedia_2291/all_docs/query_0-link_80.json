        "text": "Prohibition in Idaho\n\n(Part 1) Stories\n\nYellow Pine 1931\n\nphoto credit Jim McCoy\n\n— —\n\nYellow Pine had been a mountain wilderness in 1927; by the end of 1931, it was a modern, busy mining community.\n\nquote pulled from: pgs 14-15, History of the Boise National Forest 1905 1976, by Elizabeth M. Smith. Idaho State Historical Society, 1983\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nYellow Pine Homemade Brew\n\n“Cabin fever” could be arrested, at least temporarily, by drowning it in the contents of Mr. Van-Meters open barrel of home brew he called “old hen.” Actually a mixture of raisins and other assorted fruits and juices that made up a concoction so highly impregnated with sugar that one tin cup full of the alcoholic beverage would either take one blissfully out of this world or loosen the tongue at both ends. Incidentally too, perhaps “Old Van” had the only tomcat in Idaho that could catch enough mink during the winter months to keep him in tobacco from the proceeds derived from the mink pelts – at least that’s the way the story goes.\n\nsource: “Gold Stampede at Thunder Mountain Brought New Life to Yellow Pine Area” by Earl Willson – Valley County GenWeb [h/t SMc]\n\n— — — —\n\nYellow Pine Moonshine – Bert McCoy\n\n“Speaking of my colorful grandpa [Archibald “Bert” Augustus McCoy], whether you remember or not, he started the first café in Yellow Pine and then after that spent some time in Boise in the Idaho State Penitentiary for moonshine endeavors during prohibition (rumor has it that he sold his custom moonshine in his café, who would have guessed?). The sad part apparently was the destruction of his still by the ‘revenuers’ (government thugs apparently – who else would harass some old guy in Yellow Pine?)”\n\nby Jim McCoy (Personal Correspondence)\n\n— — — —\n\nYellow Pine History\n\nThe potential historical significance of Yellow Pine is derived from its role as a supply and social center for miners in the area following the 1902 rush to Thunder Mountain. Not until World War I was there enough activity to create a cluster of log buildings recognizable as a settlement in Yellow Pine Basin. It was 1930 before a plat was filed by Albert C. Behne. Greater accessibility of Yellow Pine by automobiles led to the establishment of a lodge, tourist park, and taverns in the 1930’s, even before the World War II boom at Stibnite. Elk hunters and fishermen came regularly to Yellow Pine, expanding a local economy basically dependent on the Bradley operation at Meadow Creek and Monday Camp.\n\nAlthough some bootlegging had been done before 1932, the repeal of prohibition made taverns an important local attraction. Like mining camps on the Idaho frontier of an earlier day, Yellow Pine has always had more taverns than any other kind of business. Social life centers in them, although there is strong loyalty and participation by adults in the operation of the one room school.\n\nexcerpted from: A Historical Summary and Cultural Resource Study Of Yellow Pine Stibnite and Cinnabar Valley County Idaho Stibnite Mining Project\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nDistilled: A History Of Idaho’s Alcohol Laws\n\nCredit Idaho State Historical Society, Image 60-114-9\n\nIdaho Governor Moses Alexander signs prohibition into law in Idaho.\n\nBy Samantha Wright Boise State Public Radio News January 22, 2018\n\nJeff Anderson, the Director of the Idaho State Liquor Division sums up this story in one short sentence:\n\n“It’s just terribly complicated and the beverage alcohol laws have been kind of kluged together over decades,” Anderson says.\n\nHe’s talking about the patchwork of laws that cover alcohol in Idaho, many of which stem from 1935. To really understand Idaho’s laws, we have to go back in time.\n\n“So late 19th, early 20th century, there was a lot of abuse of beverage alcohol,” says Anderson.\n\nIn the 1880s, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union settled in Lewiston and Boise. By the turn of the century, the Anti-Saloon League was also advocating for temperance. Sarah Phillips a curator at the Idaho Historical Museum, says many of the members came together and found a community.\n\n… The Anti-Saloon League got the Sabbath Law passed in Idaho in 1907, which prohibited alcohol sales on Sunday. A few years later, Moses Alexander, Idaho’s first Jewish governor, ran on a prohibition platform and won. He supported a constitutional amendment outlawing all alcohol sales in Idaho and it passed in 1917.\n\n… Prohibition in Idaho passed by 71 percent,” says Phillips.\n\nIdaho’s own form of prohibition kicked in three years before the entire country went dry. And Idaho’s reasoning was much the same as the rest of the nation.\n\n“They felt that would ensure morals, it would ensure people’s prosperity, family life would be better. All of a sudden all of these problems that we were having were all going to disappear if people would just put down the drink,” Phillips says.\n\ncontinued: Copyright 2018 Boise State Public Radio\n\n— — — — — — — — — –\n\nVolstead Act (Prohibition) Causes Turmoil in Idaho\n\nby Evan Filby\n\nOn October 28, 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act to provide a framework for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Prohibition, as it has always been known, did not ban the consumption of alcoholic beverages, per se. What it did was to ban the manufacture, transport, or delivery of beverages containing more than 0.5% alcohol – except for specific research and development uses.\n\nUnfortunately, Prohibition became a prime example of good intentions gone awry – and a classic case of unintended consequences. Illegal sources and channels quickly moved to fill the void created by the almost total elimination of an entire industry. There’s no need to recount the entire story here: rampant corruption and violent gang wars. Even members of “respectable” society became lawbreakers.\n\nBefore Prohibition was repealed in 1933, a dramatic case occurred in Idaho. (Idaho was generally spared the worst of the crime and violence that plagued the big cities and more populous states.) In February of 1923, the Idaho Statesman revealed that “the Feds” had indicted several high level Ada County and Boise officials, including the county sheriff and the Boise police chief, for conspiring to produce and sell moonshine whiskey.\n\nNearly a half dozen other men were charged, including a well-known Boise physician and a local rancher. (Presumably the rancher provided an out-of-the way location for their illegal still.) In the end, six conspirators were found guilty on each of six different counts – the police chief was exonerated. It is impossible to know how many other illegal operations were never caught.\n\nfrom: South Fork Companion (search for headline)\n\n— — — — — — — — — –\n\nProhibition in Idaho, 1916 – 1933\n\nDemand for contraband alcohol led to many arrests as prohibition took effect in Idaho\n\nby Arthur Hart, Special to the Idaho Statesman\n\nThe 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution banned the production, importation, transportation and sale of alcoholic beverages after 1920.\n\nThe Prohibition era that followed turned out to be nothing like the sponsors of the act had envisioned, an era of peace, prosperity and sobriety. Instead, it came to be known as “the Roaring Twenties,” an era of widespread lawlessness and occasional violence.\n\nIdaho had tried to enact statewide prohibition in 1909, with both Republican James Brady and Democrat Moses Alexander campaigning for governor in favor of it. Local option by county was the best that could be achieved that year. The Statesman’s opinion was stated on Sept. 8, 1909: “If Boise goes dry today Nampa and Caldwell will celebrate. Are Nampa and Caldwell particularly interested in Boise’s welfare?” All three towns passed local option for their respective counties.\n\nWhen the Teachers’ Institute closed in September 1909, it passed a resolution in favor of prohibition, and Ada County nearly passed prohibition in 1912, due in part to the leadership of Gov. Alexander. In 1916 Idaho passed statewide prohibition, two years ahead of passage of the 18th Amendment.\n\nAmong those affected by prohibition in Idaho were the local breweries. “GREAT BREWERY WILL NOT BE DISCARDED” ran an Idaho Statesman headline on July 3, 1915. “President Jacob Lockman Announces Plans for Coming Dry Season. Cider and Storage Plant. Will Also Turn Out Bryan’s Best if Nampa Will Grow the Grapes. CIDER BY THE CARLOAD: Mr. Lockwood is already arranging for the installation of a giant cider mill from which it is planned to grind 3000 to 4000 barrels of cider this fall. This move will be much appreciated by orchardists of this section, as at present they have no market at hand for their cull apples. The big cider plant would thus be a boon to the apple growers who have been lamenting the fate imposed on them by defeat of the Webb bill in the last legislature. This bill would have repealed the present stringent regulation preventing the sale of cull apples to buyers other than cider and vinegar factories.”\n\nWhile many Idaho businessmen tried creative ways to adjust to the restrictions imposed by 1916’s statewide prohibition, others sought to cash in on the continuing and widespread demand for alcoholic beverages of all kinds. The Idaho Republican of Blackfoot reported, “Sheriff’s Office Making Harvest of Bootleggers,” and listed half-a-dozen cases. In response to pleas of innocence by those arrested, the prosecuting attorney’s standard reply was, “That’s what they all say.”\n\n“Pullman-Auto Booze Seizure” was a Statesman headline on April 4, 1917. “Oric Cole, proprietor of the Cole auto livery, Ray Ramsay, one of the chauffeurs, and S.H. Paterson, a Pullman porter, were arrested Monday morning at the Oregon Short Line yards at about 8:30 o’clock, just as they were about to drive off in one of Cole’s autos, according to the sheriff, with 48 pints of Cedar Run whisky and two quarts of Sunnybrook that the sheriff said arrived Monday morning from Ogden in lower berth No. 1.”\n\nsource: Gem County News – prohibition and moonshiners\n\nWebspace for this site is generously provided by Genealogy Village and Access Genealogy\n\nCopyright © 2013 – – 2023 Sharon McConnel. All Rights Reserved.\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nThe road to Prohibition in Idaho was a bumpy one\n\nby Arthur Hart, special to “The Idaho Statesman”\n\nFor many Americans in the 19th century, the solution to the problems associated with the use and misuse of alcoholic beverages was to prohibit their manufacture, importation, transportation or sale. Prohibition had been tried before with mixed results, first by Maine in 1846. By 1906, 18 states had tried prohibition, but only Maine, Kansas and North Dakota still had it. For the rest, enforcement had proved to be difficult, expensive and ineffective.\n\nLocal option had been somewhat more successful, allowing cities and counties to ban alcoholic beverages if the majority of their citizens voted for it, but after it went into effect, violations had been widespread. Idaho adopted local option by county in 1909. Both Gov. James H. Brady, a Republican, and his opponent Moses Alexander, a Democrat, had spoken in favor of prohibition in that year’s election campaign.\n\n“The Idaho Statesman” wrote on Sept. 7, 1909, that the campaign would end ‘in a blaze of glory’ and that both sides seemed confident, although the result was still ‘much in doubt.’ The paper asked on Sept. 8, 1909, ‘Which Shall it be? If Boise goes dry today, Nampa and Caldwell will celebrate. They want a ‘dry’ Boise.’ Miners at the Homestake mine at Neal sent word that they had a right to vote and that they would vote, ‘dry forces notwithstanding.’ The Teachers Institute meeting in Boise closed its session with a resolution favoring statewide prohibition. Saloon keepers at Idaho City then passed a series of humorous resolutions after receiving the news that Boise had ‘stayed wet.’\n\nCanyon County did ‘go dry’ in 1909, leading to a crackdown in 1910 on a private club in Caldwell. ‘The Payette Club had an arrangement whereby a stock of wines and liquors was kept on hand, and the members furnished with a ticket upon payment of $1, which was punched according to the number of drinks used. The payment of another dollar bought a second ticket, and so on indefinitely, this method being thought to evade the law, as the liquor was purchased by the members as a body and kept on hand for the sole use of the members of the club.’\n\n—\n\nProhibition kept Boise law enforcement officers busy\n\nby Arthur Hart, Special to “The Idaho Statesman”\n\n“Prohibition had no sooner gone into effect in Idaho in 1916, and in the rest of the country in 1920, than a significant part of the population began to look for ways to get around it. The demand for liquor was so great that tens of thousands of Americans who had never before broken any law now figured that making and selling illegal liquor was worth the risk. The Idaho Statesman reported regularly on those who got arrested for trying.\n\n‘Pullman-Auto Booze Seizure’ read a headline on the morning of April 4, 1917. ‘Orric Cole, proprietor of the Cole auto livery, Ray Ramsey, one of his chauffeurs, and S.H. Paterson, a Pullman porter, were arrested Monday morning at the Oregon Short Line yards at about 8:30 o’clock, just as they were about to drive off in one of Cole’s autos with 44 pints of Cedar Run whiskey and two quarts of Sunnybrook that the sheriff said arrived Monday morning from Ogden in lower berth No.1.’ Three suitcases were later found to contain an additional 59 pints of whiskey.\n\n‘Bootleggers Are Arrested’ reported the Statesman on Aug. 18, 1917. ‘Two Caught as They Cross Nevada Line; One Tries to Escape.’ Some 36 cases of liquor and a four-and-a-half gallon keg of whiskey, all worth about $2,500, were seized. The men were armed with a six-shooter and a shotgun but wisely decided not to try to use them against C. A. Haskell, deputy collector for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; Sheriff Emmett Pfost; and his deputy, Oscar Somerville. A man who tried to escape by jumping out of a moving car and running into the brush was quickly recaptured. The liquor was turned over to U.S. officials.\n\n‘Booze Cached in City Limits’ was the headline on Aug. 21, 1917. Five barrels of whiskey and eight boxes of bottled beer had been driven to Boise from the area of Bruneau and hidden in brush beside the Boise River. When the young driver of the truck that brought the booze to Boise was arrested, he said he had been hired for the job by a man named Alvin Harris. He gave police a written description of his adventure: ‘We got to Boise about 6 o’clock Sunday morning, August 12, after the streetcars had started to run. We came across Broadway bridge and when on the north side of Boise river turned off Broadway and onto the road that runs through Julia Davis park, followed that road about a block and a half or two blocks, then turned off toward the river, and then Harris unloaded the barrels and boxes from the truck. The place was rather swampy and tulies were growing there.’ When Sheriff Emmitt Pfost and a local agent of the Department of Justice went to the spot described, they found it easily, but the booze was gone. Today’s Greenbelt runs right past the spot.\n\nA former Boise policewoman was arrested in April 1919 after beer and the apparatus for making it and 174 quarts of 1912 Old Crow and Yellowstone whiskey were found in her home near Julia Davis Park on South Ninth Street. According to Sheriff Pfost the woman brewed her beer from hops and malt in an agateware kettle on a gas range. It was then placed in a stone jar and drawn through a tube to another jar before bottling. At the time of the raid there were 20 quart bottles filled and capped.\n\nDozens of news items in the Statesman in the 1920s describe raids and arrests of violators of liquor laws. Boise police worked with federal, state and county officers in tracking down and arresting moonshiners and runners. In March 1921, officers arrested five men and seized three large touring cars and a light truck as they entered Idaho from Canada carrying 106 cases of bonded Canadian whiskey. In February 1926, all 13 cases on the docket of federal court in Boise were for violation of Prohibition laws. The fines meted out ranged from $200 to $500.\n\nIn 1928, 703 arrests were made in Idaho alone for violation of Prohibition laws, 86 complete stills were confiscated, 7,750 gallons of liquor and 30,020 gallons of mash were destroyed, and 25 automobiles were confiscated. And those are just for violators who got caught.\n\nArthur Hart writes this column on Idaho history for the Idaho Statesman each Sunday.\n\n—\n\nProhibition in Idaho was Hard to Swallow\n\nby Syd Albright, special to The Press “Coeur d’Alene Press”\n\nIdaho has always been a rough-and-tumble place, so when the federal government was pushing Prohibition nearly 100 years ago, who would think that Idaho would go along with the idea. But it did – and was that ever a mistake!\n\nThe Wild West days were pretty much over, but there was still enough lawlessness that civic-minded Idahoans thought that cutting off the supply of booze would reduce crime, increase morality, protect the young and make Idaho a healthier place to live.\n\nThat notion backfired – especially in North Idaho.\n\n“My grandfather Rene Edward Weniger was sheriff in Shoshone County in those days, when all the bootlegging and chicanery was going on in the Silver Valley,” said Gene Stone of Coeur d’Alene.\n\nElected in 1922, Weniger wore the badge longer than any of his 15 predecessors who waged fruitless battles to eliminate the Valley’s Wild West ways – against the wishes of the valley folks who wanted to keep them.\n\n“He was a pleasing type of personality, a fair-minded man, though he was greedy,” recalled one old-timer about the popular sheriff who fearlessly told federal agents, “Stay out of my county.”\n\nIdaho approved statewide Prohibition in 1916, and National Prohibition was ratified four years later. It didn’t take long for opposition to rise up however, with the French, Italians, Jewish and Basque immigrants and others hollering that drinking alcohol was part of their cultural tradition.\n\nAn argument could be made that drinking alcohol was traditional American culture as well. After all, the Pilgrims sailed to America aboard the Mayflower carrying more beer than water, and they would no doubt have happily pointed out that Jesus turned water into wine.\n\nIn 1673, Increase Mather, a Puritan minister said, “Drink is in itself a creature of God, and to be received with thankfulness.” They thought that beer, wine and cider were good for everyone – including toddlers.\n\nIn colonial times, drunkenness was condemned and punished and could earn the miscreant a public whipping, a fine, or time in the stocks.\n\nLong before anyone knew much about Idaho, whiskey was a favorite way to consume excess grain on the frontier.\n\nIn the early 1800s, people drank four times as much alcohol in America as they do today. But they drank only small portions throughout the day – during work breaks and meals – instead of binge drinking at the local pub on the way home from work.\n\nBy 1810, there were at least 2,000 distilleries producing more than two million gallons of whiskey – that by the 1820s sold for 25 cents a gallon and was cheaper than beer, wine, coffee, tea or milk.\n\nThe American Temperance Society was an important part of this history. It was founded in 1826, concurrent with a renewed religious awakening. Within 10 years, they had some 8,000 local temperance groups and 1.5 million members who campaigned for drinking in moderation, or not at all. Those who chose total abstinence wrote T. . on their pledge cards and earned the name Teetotaler.\n\nBy 1830, Americans over the age of 15 – mostly males – drank nearly seven gallons of pure alcohol a year, three times as much as today.\n\nAs America grew, people headed west and increasingly became untethered from their traditional social restraints. Taverns and inns morphed into saloons, where regard for social decorum disintegrated into drinking, gambling and barroom rowdyism.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the temperance forces gained momentum, leading to critical mass around the time of World War I.\n\nCongress decided to put Prohibition to a vote as the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution requires that three-fourths of the state legislatures approve any amendment. Of the 48 states then in the Union, 46 – including Idaho – voted “yea.” Connecticut and Rhode Island voted no.\n\nGov. Moses Alexander signed Idaho’s acceptance of the law on Jan. 8, 1919. The following year, the Amendment was added to the Constitution.\n\nSection 1 of the Amendment states: “After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.”\n\nBootleggers didn’t wait for the ink to dry. Illegal stills sprouted up in hidden places all over America and the great cat-and-mouse game began, with law enforcers chasing the moonshiners, liquor smugglers and purveyors. The Idaho wilderness was ideal for hiding a still.\n\nSince long before Prohibition, Shoshone County towns depended on funding from “liquor license” fees. After Prohibition, the fees were simply renamed as “soft drink” licenses. All “joints and vice dens,” liquor stores, gambling establishments and prostitutes paid fees ranging from $15 to $25. Weniger helped collect them.\n\nCity councils did not want Prohibition laws enforced because it would dry up city funding. For law enforcement officers to do so would have been political suicide.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties and the Flapper Generation was changing the face of America with music, fun and games, speakeasies and booze. Hollywood glamorized illicit drinking, and everyone knew who Al Capone and Eliot Ness were.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the new law to become unpopular.\n\nOne report said, “The criminal justice system was swamped although police forces and courts had expanded in recent years. Prisons were jam-packed and court dockets were behind in trying to deal with the rapid surge in crimes. Organized crime expanded to deal with the lucrative business, and there was widespread corruption among those charged with enforcing unpopular laws.”\n\nIdaho was quick to thumb its nose at the feds. “There was more moonshining and more illegal drinking in Idaho than just about any other state in the nation,” historian Sarah Phillips wrote. “In Pocatello, there was 10-times more illegal drinking per capita than there was in Philadelphia.”\n\nMoonshiners didn’t have to hide stills deep in the Idaho forests. In places like Lewiston, Pocatello and the Silver Valley, bathtubs would do just fine.\n\nIn practice, Shoshone County never did become dry, but simply acknowledged that booze was illegal. Liquor could be purchased anyplace “but the post office and Methodist Church.”\n\nDuring much of that time, alcohol was smuggled into Silver Valley across the mountains from Montana.\n\nEnforcement fell to the Bureau of Prohibition, set up under the Volstead Act that backed up the 18th Amendment, and placed under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, then later the Department of Justice.\n\nU.S. attorney, H.E. Ray went after the Silver Valley lawbreakers, and on Nov. 11, 1929, a grand jury in Moscow “swore a complaint against soft drink proprietors, prostitutes, the entire Mullan board of trustees, Deputy Sheriff Charles Bloom, and Sheriff R.E. Weniger” for violating the National Prohibition Act.\n\nEarly on Aug. 14, 1929, the feds seized over 600 gallons of bootleg and Canadian liquor in Mullan, Wallace, and Kellogg – and the North Idaho Whisky Rebellion was on.\n\nThe feds won the court case and all the accused – including Sheriff Weniger – were convicted and sentenced to McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary in Washington.\n\nBut despite all the efforts of enforcers like Eliot Ness, FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and an army of others, the illegal alcohol business thrived. By 1933, crime was rampaging nationwide, morality was declining and no health or social benefits could be seen. Life in America was becoming worse and Prohibition was a failure.\n\nBy 1933, the public had enough of Prohibition and the 21st Amendment repealed it.\n\nThe Bureau of Prohibition didn’t go away however – it just eventually evolved into today’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).\n\nEighteen states still maintain some control over alcohol. Idaho is one of them, with all liquor stores run by the state government.\n\nThere are still more than 500 “dry” counties nationwide. Surprisingly, one of them is Moore County, Tenn. – home of Jack Daniels – where its popular whiskey is still not available in stores or restaurants.\n\nGene Stone’s grandfather, Sheriff Weniger fought the verdict from his trial, never served time and was eventually pardoned.\n\nIt was much easier in the old days before Prohibition, when the sheriffs and stagecoach drivers at least didn’t have to worry about arrests for drunk driving – the horses already knew their way home.\n\nSyd Albright is a writer/journalist/biographer living in Post Falls. He is chairman of the Kootenai County Historic Preservation Commission.\n\n—\n\n“The Cyclopedia of Temperance, Prohibition and Public Morals”\n\nfrom: books.google.com\n\n“Idaho — In February, 1915, the Idaho Legislature passed a statutory prohibition law becoming effective January 1, 1916. This is the strictest possible law, forbidding the possession of brandy, whisky, and beer under any circumstances, and allowing wine and pure alcohol to be possessed only for sacramental and medicinal purposes. On November 7, 1916, the people of Idaho voted by about three to one for a constitutional amendment, effective May 1, 1917, fortifying the prohibition law.\n\n“The operation of this drastic law in Idaho has been highly beneficial, according to the testimony of innumerable business witnesses. The banks show increased deposits, more legitimate goods are being sold, fewer accidents occur in the mines, and drunkenness has generally decreased.\n\n“Mr. J. L. Ballif, Jr., of Rexburg, Idaho, calls special attention to the large number of checks now cashed in grocery and other stores, which were formerly cashed in saloons. Governor Moses Alexander declares that prohibition is almost universally approved. “We no longer even discuss it,” he says. “Merchants are selling more goods, small accounts are paid promptly, working efficiency has increased, accidents in the mines are fewer than ever before, saving deposits have gone up 200 per cent, our jails are nearly empty, and police courts are idle. Here in Boise two policemen could do all of the work necessary without trouble.”\n\nsource: Idaho AHGP Copyright © 2013 – – 2023 Sharon McConnel.

The Idaho Statesman seemed to treat it with good humor, lamenting that it “Would deprive many men of the only home they ever had.” (See image)\n\nBut there also seemed an element in the paper, as there was in society in general, that had mixed opinions about it. On May 19, 1916, the Statesman reported on an alarming increase in dandelion wine in Boise: “Many owners of dandelion infested lawns have marveled lately at the number of children and grownups who asked permission to help extricate the little golden nuisances ‘for a medicine that mother makes,’ and have been enthusiastically granted permission.\n\n“It has now earned the manufacture of dandelion wine has been carried on in many Boise homes in large quantities this spring.”\n\nState Chemist Jackson (no first name given) tested some of mamma’s medicine and found it came in at 12.6 percent alcohol. He opined that perhaps it should be called “Dandy Lion” wine, because of its alcohol content.\n\nThe newspaper extolled the wine’s virtues as a liver medicine, but cautioned that “many a strict prohibition mother is probably making the wine, never dreaming that she is a lawbreaker.”\n\nWith those warnings out of the way, the paper proceeded to go give a complete recipe for making the wine.\n\n(no larger size available)\n\nsource: Speaking of Idaho\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nProtests\n\nOct. 31, 1931 – Newark, N.J. – Labor union members march through Broad Street protesting Prohibition.\n\n(Photoquest/Getty Images)\n\nEnd of Prohibition\n\nCirca 1933 | New York City | Patrons celebrate the end of Prohibition with beer.\n\n(Imago/Getty Images)\n\nsource: U.S. News (with more photos)\n\n————–\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLink to Idaho History Index Page\n\n——————\n\nMoose City\n\nClearwater County, Idaho\n\nNorth Fork of the Clearwater River\n\nMoose Creek and Kelly Creek – showing the town of Pierce\n\nsource: Google Maps\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nMining History Along the Clearwater River\n\nWhile the gold rush in the Clearwater River Basin only lasted a few decades, it helped open the area up to homesteading and eventually a lucrative timber industry. Let’s look back at the role mining played in the history of the Clearwater River Basin.\n\nBeginning in 1860, reports of gold in the Clearwater River and its tributaries led to an influx of gold seekers. In 1861, Captain E.D. Pierce’s venture established the Oro Fino Mining District. A couple of big gold discoveries in the area triggered the Clearwater gold rush of the 1860s.\n\nThe First Clearwater River Mining Ventures\n\nAfter a huge discovery at Rhodes Creek, the lands held by the Oro Fino Mining District were expanded. Shoshone County was established, and in 1863 it became part of the Idaho Territory. The entire area was proving rich in gold discoveries, most within the Clearwater River Basin.\n\nAnother large find occurred during this same period at Moose Creek. This brought about another influx of gold seekers to the Clearwater River Basin, a boom that created the town of Moose City. The Moose City mining ambitions continued for more than a decade.\n\nWhile the gold finds were meaningful, there was still a continued pull from the huge strikes happening in California. Many gold seekers left the area to venture farther west. As white pioneers moved west, many of the gold operations were turned over to Chinese peoples.\n\nMany credit Chinese from helping many of these small Idaho towns from being abandoned totally in the late 1860s. The mania surrounding the gold rush throughout the last half of the 19th century exploded all over the western part of North America.\n\nWhile the abundance of gold in the Clearwater River Basin didn’t quite match the wealth of discoveries in other areas, gold’s influence on the region is undeniable. Pierce City still has the undeniable aura of a once prosperous gold town.\n\nIt didn’t take long before wealthy mineral barons flocked to the area. As individuals with the finances to back larger types of dredging came to the Clearwater River Basin, many of the old-style gold seekers packed up and headed for more remote streams and creek beds.\n\nAlthough the most intense period of the gold rush around the Clearwater River only lasted about 30-years, it’s responsible for many of the small communities that still exist today. Over 200 years later, after the first proclamation of gold discovered within the Clearwater River Basin, gold prospectors still come to the area looking to pan for their own mother lode.\n\nexcerpted from: Clearwater Museum\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nMoose City\n\nGold was discovered at Pierce on October 1, 1860. Miners and prospectors flocked to the locality in 1861. The majority of the miners came from California and were experienced prospectors. They not only understood how to mine gold, but also knew the best ways of prospecting the streams. Using Pierce and Lewiston as bases, the prospectors spread out in all directions over the mountains. During the summers of 1861 and 1862, all the major gold deposits in the Clearwater drainage were discovered and all its major streams thoroughly prospected.\n\nGold was discovered around Moose Creek and Independence Creek by a wandering band of prospectors July 4, 1862. This placer ground paid its discoverers well for a short time but was soon deserted. The rich deposits were limited. Independence Creek was dredged in the 1930’s.\n\nA second population influx was stimulated in the late sixties by discoveries made by prospectors Ernest Hilton, William Shepard and Tommy O’Brien. It is said that fully two hundred people rushed to this locality. This boom resulted in the founding of Moose City with a saloon, restaurant, hotel, jail, butcher shop and three general stores. For three years the diggings produced well and supported the population. But during the seventies the diggings began to fail again. Moose City was soon abandoned, though a few people continued to mine there for many years.\n\nThere is still some prospecting around Moose City and people pan the creeks to pick up a few “colors”, but there are no mines being operated. Until 1924, parts of the old jail could still be seen, but shortly thereafter the Forest Service built a work camp on the site of old Moose City. Men from this camp tore the old jail apart. Today nothing remains of old Moose City except a few level spots where buildings once stood. A thick stand of young timber has reclaimed the old town and the diggings. Moose City is hardly noticeable now, even when you stand at the Forest Service sign that marks the place.\n\nexcerpted from: The Clearwater Story: A History of the Clearwater National Forest Chapter 18 Mining\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\n1985 Moose Creek Mining Report\n\nIdaho State Historical Society Reference Series\n\nMoose Creek\n\nNumber 828 – 1985\n\nPlacers along Moose Creek — a Clearwater tributary near Montana — attracted prospectors periodically after their discovery in 1864. About 70 miles from Pierce, they could be supplied by Lolo Trail packers who could descend to Kelly Creek and continue north up Moose Creek. A Lewiston correspondent, September 16, 1864, reported their discovery to a Walla Walla paper in a brief notice:\n\n“New mines have also been discovered on the Lolo Fork of Sweetwater [Clearwater], in a north-easterly direction from Oro Fino, distant about 70 miles. Specimens received from the party indicate the gold to be coarse, not unlike the Kootenai. In both the above localities 20 cents to nearly as many dollars per pan of dirt is spoken of as the result of prospecting. Several parties are preparing to visit these localities, upon whose return more reliable intelligence may be had to communicate.”\n\n(Washington Statesman, 16 September 1864, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nToo limited in value and extent to detain miners in 1864–when large and rewarding gold discoveries at Helena and other highly profitable mining camps discouraged fortune hunters from wasting time in less promising areas–they soon were forgotten and ignored. But by 1866 other camps had declined and rich new placers were needed. So Moose Creek had another chance. Nimrod Poston of Missoula noted renewed interest in Moose Creek placers that summer:\n\nSquire Poston also reports several discoveries on, or near, the headwaters of the Clearwater. The discoverers had visited Missoula City and obtained rockers. But little information could be obtained from these men–their motive for silence being, evidently to return, and secure their claims before an excitement and subsequent “rush.” These are what are termed bardiggings. Of course we can only conjecture as to the locality; but, being near the head of the Clearwater, and near the Lo-lo Fork trail, they cannot be more than seventy-five miles from Missoula City, nor over half that distance from Fort Owen. We would recommend Western friends, who intend returning this fall to Oregon or California to go by the way of this trail, prepared for prospecting. Though much more rugged than the Mullan route, it is said to be the shortest course by a hundred miles from points in Montana to Walla Walla or Lewiston.\n\n(Rocky Mountain Gazette, 11 August 1866, Montana Post [Virginia City], 18 August, p. 3, c. 4)\n\nBut at that time, Moose Creek could not compete with Leesburg and possibilities of mining there were soon forgotten. Additional prospecting north of Pierce toward Moose Creek two years later led to a modest gold discovery closer to Pierce than to Moose Creek. Stanford Capps, a prominent miner from Pierce, reported that find, September 11, 1868:\n\nFriend Slater, — You will probably hear distorted of the “new and rich diggings” struck within thirty miles of this place. We have actually found a creek that will pay very well on the north slope of the Bald Mountains if there was sufficient water to work the same. I have been on the ground for the last week. There is scarcely a rocker head.\n\nOut of 500 buckets (or pans) of dirt we got $27.25. The ground is nearly all taken up. It will take three or four thousand dollars to bring water into the gulch. The water right is located by Capps. Boyd & Co. The creek or gulch is called “Gold Creek.”\n\nWe have discovered and have located very god [sic] diggings, but as to their extent no man knoweth.\n\nThe creek is situated about twenty miles in a northerly direction from Pierce city.\n\n(Idaho Statesman, 22 September 1868, p. 2, c. 3)\n\nAlthough a number of scattered properties attracted some attention in that general area over many years, Gold Creek (somewhere around Orogrande Creek) did not gain any great prominence.\n\nFinally in 1868 and 1869, renewed Moose Creek excitements led to serious efforts to mine there. New gold camps were needed even more than in 1866, and until Loon Creek came into prominence, Moose Creek began to flourish. Lewiston and Pierce provided reports of renewed excitement there:\n\nThe Discovery of new mines beyond Lewiston, has created quite an excitement, and arrested all the travel this way. King, the stage driver, had stocked the road, looking for a large influx of passengers this way, but instead of being crowded his coaches come down empty.\n\nAll the loose men around Lewiston, and the various mining camps, have struck for the new diggings, preferring to risk wintering in the mountains rather than miss the chance of securing good claims.\n\n(Walla Walla Statesman, 30 October 1868, p. 3, c. 1)\n\nWe have it from Expressman Fettis and Mr. J. Lowenberg and quite a number of other reliable gentlemen that the new mining district, to the north and east of Pierce city, known as Moose Creek, is extraordinarily rich and extensive. It is believed that this new camp will eclipse any that has been found within the last ten years, and will furnish ground enough for a thousand or more men to work. The prospects average on the hills from 10 to 12 cents to the pans, and in the gulches from 15 to 25 cents to the pan; which warrants the belief that this new camp will exceed Florence and equal California in ‘49. Water is abundant with plenty of fall — dump, and little or no stripping; and the gravel from five to six feet deep. Nearly all from Pierce city and thereabouts have gone there, and parties and pack trains are daily leaving here for there. Mr. Hawthorne & Co. leave here today for this camp with a train loaded with ten thousand pounds. There can be no doubt of the truth of this exciting news. We have given the above as a low estimate of the accounts given us, as we desire to be within bounds. Mr. Lowenberg has dust from there that we think will assay $17 per ounce. We have a reliable correspondent there and that will give us full particulars for our next issue.\n\n(Idaho Statesman, 6 November 1868, p. 3, c. 2)\n\nWinter activity at Moose Creek necessarily was somewhat limited in 1868-1869. Enough fairly rich placer gravel was available that some miners could make good wages even though water was not available for an efficient sluicing operation. A brief notice of successful production there reached Walla Walla:\n\nMoose Creek Mine. — By way of Lewiston, favorable reports reach us from the Moose Creek mines, near the head of the Clearwater. Men who are wintering in there are making from $5 to $9 a day to the hand, using rockers.\n\n(Walla Walla Statesman, 29 Jan 1869, p. 3, c. 1)\n\nProspecting continued along Moose Creek all winter with more than satisfactory results:\n\nA party came in from Moose Creek the other day on snow shoes, having been seven days on the road. They report all well and prospecting. Many good claims have been found during the winter, and considerable money has been taken out with rockers and pans. There is no longer any doubt that they are good mines, both rich and extensive. A party will leave this place for that camp in about two weeks. I intend going as soon as I possible can.\n\n(Idaho Statesman, 6 March 1869, p. 2, c. 2)\n\nAs soon as travel to Moose Creek became practical, interested miners got organized to go there from supply points such as Walla:\n\nMoose Creek Mines.–In the early part of the week we noticed quite a large pack train fitting out for the Moose Creek mines. The train was owned by miners, who took with them provisions, tools, etc., to last them the summer.\n\n(Walla Walla Statesman, 26 March 1869, p. 3, c. 1)\n\nBy Spring, a successful mining season got underway. In order to supply a more efficient sluicing operation, a system of ditches was dug early in 1869:\n\nThe express from Moose creek this week brings us good news. Claims that are opened are paying from one ounce to fifty dollars per day to the hand. About three hundred men in that district have acquired good claims. The great and indeed only drawback is the want of water for the approaching dry season. This will have to be brought in ditches which are now in the process of construction. The entire country between this place and Moose creek offers a very promising field for prospecting, and is almost untouched.\n\nI. B. Cowen, Esq., our sheriff, has appointed Mr. John O’Meara as his deputy for the Moose region. So far this camp has yielded rather more than the average amount of dust. We feel confident that we have the best placed camp in the territory.\n\n(Idaho Statesman, 8 June 1869, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nEarly in May, after spring runoff left most Moose Creek placers with no water for sluicing, production there largely ended for that season:\n\nFrom the North. — A letter from our correspondent at Pierce City, I. T., dated the 15th, informs us that the Moose creek excitement has partially subsided; the cry there as elsewhere is water! water! The weather is excessively hot.\n\n(Idaho Statesman, 29 June 1869, p. 3, c. 1)\n\nBy that time, miners at Moose City began to notice that their claims had a more limited potential than they had originally supposed. Working rich spots with rockers, they had flattering results. But when they began large scale production, they found their claims did not pay very well. This kind of experience was typical of many early operations in a new district: A. C. Wellman, a well-known Walla Walla valley resident writing from Pierce, June 2, explained what had gone wrong and discounted optimistic reports that continued to emanate from Moose Creek:\n\nEDITOR STATESMAN: — Please allow me to correct a statement made by Mr. O’Neil in regard to the Moose Creek mines. He stated that he had been to Moose Creek, and found it to be a rich and extensive camp. This statement is false in very particular. Mr. O’NEIL never was there and knows nothing of the mines whatever. Moose Creek is not rich, neither is it extensive — the best claims are scarcely paying wages and the whole camp will not number over forty claims that pay anything at all, and even these cannot be worked but a short time longer on account of water. Ditches are being brought in, but it will take all summer to complete them. Before the claims were opened the prospects were very flattering; one, two, three, and even twenty dollars was got to the pan, but the leads, after working, have proven to be very narrow and spotted, and fall short of the expectations of every one. The basin is low, yet diggings are well up to the head of the gulches, making natural water scarce. The largest week’s work yet made was 48 ounces to two men, and the largest nugget $117. The distance from this place to Moose Creek is about forty miles, and from Moose Creek to Hellgate valley about the same. Provisions have been very scarce this spring, but when I left, a few days since, teams were coming in from both sides.\n\n(Walla Walla Statesman, 18 June; Idaho World, 24 June 1869, p. 2, c. 3)\n\nDiscouraged miners from Moose Creek returned to Warren’s complaining about a similar experience. L. W. Bacon, an Idaho legislator who operated a Warren’s express, reported their dissatisfaction:\n\nThe Moose creek mines have already commenced to fail. Mr. [L. W.] Bacon says that for a few weeks before he left Warrens, miners were daily coming in from the Moose creek diggings, disgusted, flat broke, and anxious to obtain employment. Only a few had gone there from Warrens, but nearly all who had were back again, and with them came numbers who had rushed to Moose creek from British Columbia diggings, from Elk City and Oro Fino, and from the California, Nevada and Eastern Oregon mining districts. All of them pronounced the Moose Creek diggings comparatively a humbug. The area of mining ground is limited, and the richness of the best claims there has been greatly overrated. A few men who had gone there early and had the pick of all the ground, had succeeded pretty well in the mines, and the few traders who got in first with goods and provisions, had made money; but the diggings were no longer paying, except in rare instances; the camp was overstocked with goods of all kinds, and the rush from there during May was far beyond the rush to Moose creek. The excitement was over, the camp was fast simmering down to bed rock grade, and the “rich and extensive Moose creek gold fields” told of in the papers, will sustain no more than half the number who remained there in early May, if so many.\n\n(Idaho World, 17 June 1869, p. 4, c. 2)\n\nMoose Creek, like many other camps, soon became more attractive to Chinese than to other mines. Not having produced too much before it declined, Moose City offered only limited opportunities to Oriental miners. Eventually they ran into trouble too:\n\nThe old mining camp of this name is located in the eastern part of Shoshone county, Idaho. Rich deposits of gold were found there in 1867 and 1868, and for several years subsequent there was considerable mining done. For the past few years only a few Kanakas and Chinamen have been operating them. The camp is high up in the Bitter Root range of mountains, among the upper tributaries of the North Clearwater, and is about 200 miles northeast of Lewiston. Last Spring four Kanakas who had passed the preceding winter there were found dead in their cabins.\n\nThe Missoulian gives the following particulars of a similar horrible calamity which befell a party of Chinamen who remained there last Fall to spend the Winter:\n\nOn April the 15th a party of miners, consisting of John Bolen, Chas. Felton and Albert Peters started from Moose creek ferry to cross the range and go into the Moose mining district. Six miles out the party found it necessary to construct snow shoes and were six days in making the trip into the mines. There were sixteen Chinamen left in the diggings last year. Of this number six were found dead, but unburied; and all but one (the China merchant) of the remaining Chinamen very seriously ill with a very severe form of scurvy. It seems that these Chinamen, in order to live cheap, had caught and dried a large number of “bruised” salmon last fall, and this had been their main supply of food. The poor fellows were ignorant of the nature of their ailments, and superstitiously let the sick alone to take care of themselves. Dead men were found on the floor, and sick men on beds in the same room. The bodies were boxed and buried in the snow for the present, until later in the season. During the past Winter it has snowed nearly all the time in the camp, and the men have lived necessarily indoors to a great extent. It is very probably that the enforced inactivity for so long a period has had much to do with bringing on the scurvy.\n\n(Yankee Fork Herald [Bonanza], 29 May 80, p. 4, c. 1)\n\nEventually a drag-line operation succeeded in handling a large amount of Moose Creek gravel that could not be sluiced profitably in earlier years. Most production there came from this twentieth-century mining effort.\n\nsource: Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series Number 828 (1985) Publications — 450 N. 4th Street, Boise, ID 83702–208-334-3428\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nMoose Creek, tributary to Kelly Creek, tributary to the North Fork of the Clearwater River in the NezPerce-Clearwater NF\n\nsource: NezPerce-Clearwater NF\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nNewspaper Clippings\n\n1869\n\nThe Idaho World.

They represent the diggings to be as rich and extensive and the old Florence diggings, and the gold is coarse. In consequence of their reports forty men left Lewiston in small boats, to ascent the Clearwater and thence reach the mines early. In addition to this report, a private letter received in Boise City from W. A. Goulder, member of the Legislature from Shoshone county, who wrote from Pierce City, Feb. 15th, states that himself and many others will leave that vicinity for the Moose creek as soon as the travel opens. Very little snow has fallen in Northern Idaho this Winter. A party of miners had reached Pierce City in seven days from Moose creek, and traveled nearly all the way on snow shoes. They brought encouraging reports of the new diggings.\n\nsource: The Idaho World. (Idaho City, Idaho Territory), 11 March 1869.\n\nChronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Stackhouse, of Deer Lodge, who, in company with Charlie Bennett, returned from Moose creek mines a few days since, we have obtained these facts concerning the diggings. They reached the mines, from Helena, July 1st, and left August 5th. Moose creek is tributary to the Clearwater; in just over the Montana line, is a spur of the Coeur d’Alene mountains, 100 miles from Missoula Mills and 60 miles from the ferry, from which the trail to the mines leads through an unbroken forest of heavy timber in which fires, now extinguished, have been raging this summer. There are about 75 men in the camp. Moose City has some 15 or 20 houses, including four stores, two butcher shops, two blacksmith shops and a bakery. Flour sells at $13 per hundred pounds; other things in proportion. The express comes in every two or three weeks from Pierce City, Idaho. The two principal gulches are named Pioneer and Independence. Each is almost two miles long. There are a number of side gulches prospecting moderately. There is no water in, except the natural streams, giving Independence a sluice head three or four, and Pioneer the same amount two hours, per day. About a dozen claims are paying. Schott & Miller’s claim yields 4 oz per day on two hours’ water, two men shoveling, the ground having been stripped. The pay is up near the rim-rock, and not in the bed of the gulch. At one place on Independence the pay streak runs over “Science” hill. The average depth is four feet. Sixteen men working six weeks have just completed a ditch four miles long, but no water came through at the time Mr. S. left. Andy Ferguson is working seven men on a ditch from Independence creek, which will be four miles long. It will be completed September 1st, and the water used in their own hydraulic, on ground now paying an ounce per day. It is the general impression that next year the camp will employ 150 or 200 men for four months at good wages. Men are now arriving and departing constantly. The camps of Deer Lodge offer better inducements that Moose creek, where sluiceboxes, prarently [sic] used five or six years ago, found in various localities, evidence that the country has been prospected pretty thoroughly and that a “big” camp is not likely to be found.\n\nsource: The New North-West.

They blazed a trail in from the St. Joe, working it where absolutely necessary, over which a horse can take about 60 pounds. He estimates that it would cost $25,000 to build a decent trail in there. They put up a small arastra, and the rock worked yielded satisfactory returns. The ledge they have located is only eight inches wide, but the rock is rich. The country is very rough and hard to prospect – hard as a Klondike, the doctor says – but with a trail leading into the country there is likely to be a number of men go in next year.\n\nsource: Red Lodge Picket.

Thirty years ago Moose Creek was a pretentious rival of the famous Highland gulch, its neighbor just over the hill, where hundreds of thousand of dollars in gold circulated among a hundred or two miners. In those days Moose was worked from the head of the creek down its channel a distance of four miles. A few tributaries yielded a fair share of the district’s proceeds, but the greater part of the development work was confined to the channel of the gulch. Moose “City” was a typical mining camp, busy and full of “dust.” Now it is only a decayed ruin, a scattered plot of rotten logs serving as a fertilizer for a rich growth of bunch and rye grass. The slice heaps are huge beds of rose and gooseberry bushes. Some of them are surmounted by cottonwood trees 10 or 15 feet tall. Nearly every evidence of early development of the placers has been removed by Dame Nature, who has fringed the banks of the pits with shrubbery and made a veritable garden of the tail races. The average man would traverse the extent of the gulch and not encounter a reminder of the fact that it had, 30 years ago, been overturned by the miner’s pick and shovel.\n\nHere and there are signs of work of recent years, and on the bars can be seen “fresh dirt.” It is here that the discovery was made this summer that gold exists in paying quantities outside of the main channel. It has been demonstrated that money is to be made in bar diggings henceforth as well as it was in working the bed of the creek 30 years ago. Hence the probability of a large output of gold next summer.\n\nHugh Carter, a prospector and miner of experience, was in the city yesterday after a wagon load of provisions for his camp and will return to-day. It is his intention to open a cut for a bedrock flume and set the boxes and be in readiness for early operations in the spring. To a Standard reporter yesterday, Mr. Carter said:\n\n“There are probably a dozen men working in a primitive way on the bars up near the head of the fork approaching the divide which separates the district from Highland. They have found gold in paying quantities, heavy ‘shot’ gold, in fineness similar to that of the Highland article. Our ground pans out better than any I have seen in recent years, and I am satisfied that big money is to be made there.”\n\nsource: The Anaconda standard.

He worked off a pit last month and cleaned up, besides the big nugget, $280.\n\nIn 1866-7 Moose creek was a rival of the famous Highland gulch, and many thousands of dollars in gold was taken from it. There was a lively camp of mines near the mouth of Nigger gulch, and the camp was named Moose City. There were a dozen cabins, a boarding house, two saloons, and a “bunk” house. There was a faro bank and the dealer was a woman known by the name of Mollie Gore.\n\nMollie brought with her to this territory a long career and a tough looking husband, who died with his boots on a few months after he struck the camp. Mollie had a crude affair for a faro layout. All of the chips were white, worth 50 cents apiece in the game. After the play became heavier, Mollie immersed several stacks of chips in red ink, and these she put on the green cloth at $2.50 apiece. This scheme worked pretty smoothly until one morning when she noticed that she had less than a stack of white chips. Some one had bought the chips out at $5 a stack and by a gradual process had colored all of them with red ink. So when Mollie came to settle up at the rate of $50 a stack, she called upon her husband to see her through the play, with the result that the man with the red ink came out winner in the mortal combat, as well as in the faro game. That is Moose City history.\n\nMollie was a winsome dame, however, and before long she had recouped her losses in all respects. Then she and her new husband with all her gold winnings went over to Helena and opened up a dance hall. They made barrels of money and late in the following fall, Mollie deserted her husband and went to Unionville, above Helena, and opened a faro bank on her own hook. She flourished and added life to the lively mining camp. She always wore a necklace of nuggets the size of coffee beans, the product of Moose creek.\n\nIn after years, when the dawn of a darker day frowned upon her, Mollie sold her necklace to a tourist, who returned to New York and “caught a girl,” as he said with the rich necklace. This man many years later, returned to Montana, and is now a voter in this state. He and his wife visited Moose City last month, made the acquaintance of Sandy Carter, who told them all about old Moose City and the woman gambler and her adventures. It was all very interesting to the lady who wore the necklace.\n\nsource: The Anaconda Standard. (Anaconda, Mont.), 10 July 1899.\n\nChronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

Old Moose City is taking on a bit of the color which characterized that camp in years and years gone by, and it is predicted that much activity will be seen there the coming season, that is if it snows in the interval. As things now look the prospect for placer mining is not good; but it will be remembered that there was little snow last year before February, and on last year’s “form” the miners are making preparations for the summer’s work.\n\n“Sandy” tells about two young men from Iowa, who went out to Moose last fall to look at the country and incidentally to make a survey with a view to locating some mines. They did not at first know the difference between wash gravel and a ledge, but they had studied the law governing the holding of claims and learned that some ground in the gulch would be subject to relocation on Jan. 1 of this year. They laid their plans before a number of the prospectors of the gulch and took everybody into their confidence. They even showed some gold they had panned from their prospective holdings, having acquired the knowledge of panning by constant practice. They had, indeed, found some very good gravel and they were elated. So were the old boys who saw their finish, so to speak, for no sooner did they become aware of the find than they hit upon a plan to relieve the young men of the responsibility and hardships of conducting a placer mine in the proper way. The young men visited the ground every day and in the evening they would have a fresh story for the grizzled boys.\n\nOn the last day of December, bright and early, “Sandy” and his partner, Bill Watkins, went to the hole the young men had dug and planted a stake nearby, from the top of which hung a black piece of cloth torn from the lining of an old coat. On it were printed the white bold and warning figures, “3-7-77, Montana Vigilantes, the last day of our Lord ’98.”\n\nLate in the afternoon the two tenderfeet were seen going into their cabin. An hour later they were seen carrying their blankets over the hill in the direction of Divide on the Short Line. They have not been seen since.\n\n“Wat and I just did that to give the boys a chance to tell us another story about their wonderful find. We thought they’d come to us and tell us how they were going to stand off the ‘horrid vigilantes,’ as they called them. We used to tell them some of the most impossible lies about this band of regulators and their horrible deeds in the early days, and they used to swallow it all. They would say that they wished they had been in Montana in those days to take part in the excitement and that if those days would ever return they would be right in the thick of it. They even wanted to join them now, but we told them that they made their headquarters at Shelby Junction and that their agents showed up in these parts only once in a great while.\n\n“Now they’re gone, and for fear that some one else might disregard the bogus black rag, we just jumped the mine ourselves, but the rag is still floating over the prospect hole dug by those poor fools.”\n\nsource: The Anaconda Standard.

It is noted for its mining heritage, dating back to the 1880s.\n\nSilver Valley is a narrow valley about 40 miles (64 km) in length, east of the city of Coeur d’Alene. The South Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River flows through the valley and Interstate 90 traverses the valley between Fourth of July Pass to the west and Lookout Pass on the Montana border.\n\nSeveral towns are located in the valley, all in Shoshone County. These include (from west to east) Pinehurst, Smelterville, Kellogg, Wardner, Osburn, Silverton, Wallace, and Mullan. The Silver Valley has also been referred to as the Coeur d’Alene Valley and the Coeur d’Alene Mining District.\n\nMiners going to work in 1909, Silver Valley\n\nCopyrighted, 1909 H.

It is a mania that spreads throughout the older mining districts with astonishing rapidity. People do not wait for definite information about the character of the new “find,” or the geography of the country where it exists, but hasten to be first on the ground, either to take up claims or to furnish whisky or provisions to the miners. The mines must be of gold, and not of silver. The cheaper metal has no great fascination about it; besides, it is always locked up in the rocks, and can only be extracted by costly crushers and smelters. Furthermore, they must be placer mines and not quartz; for only placers can be worked with picks and shovels, and such rude appliances of ditches and sluice-boxes as every miner knows how to make. The news of the discovery of “pay dirt” causes a thrill of excitement to traverse the whole vast region between the British possessions on the north and Mexico on the south, and between the great plains on the east and the Pacific coast. Everybody who has ever seen a placer mine feels as if he would like to take a risk in the fascinating lottery of searching in the mud and gravel for the glittering yellow nuggets. There is a stir in the camps of Arizona and New Mexico, of Colorado and Utah, and the “old timers” of California, recalling the days of ’49, feel young once more and long for the rude, vigorous life and the splendid hopes they once enjoyed in the Sierras.\n\nStampedes have been very rare in late years. So thoroughly have the gold-fields been prospected that the chances of paying placers having been overlooked are very remote. The prospecting goes on every summer, however. In the loneliest valleys of the Rocky Mountains you are likely to come upon unkempt men digging a hole in a bank or washing a pan of dirt in a stream. These men always hunt in couples, and address each other affectionately as “partner” or “old pard.” They are inveterate prospectors, who during the inclement seasons manage to pick up a living somehow in towns or on ranches, and in summer take to the woods and the gulches. Here and there they find a little “color” to encourage them, but the rich diggings, where nuggets as big as an egg can be picked out of the gravel, are always a little farther on.\n\nOf all the stampedes in old times or in recent years, the great Coeur d’Alene stampede of the winter and spring of 1884 was probably the most remarkable. The country it invaded was less known than any other part of the Rocky Mountain chain. No roads traversed it; there was not even a bridle trail. To make matters worse, the entire region was covered with a forest growth of cedar, pine, and fir, so dense as to resemble a Hindostan jungle. “Begorra, ye’ll find the trees growin’ as thick as a bunch of matches,” said an old Irish miner, whom I encountered on my way to the region, and he did not greatly exaggerate. To make matters still worse, the snowfalls are phenomenal, and the stampede began in the dead of winter, when the snow was from twelve to twenty feet deep in the mountain passes. Yet, in spite of these obstacles, over five thousand men made their way into the heart of the Coeur d’Alene Mountains during the months of January, February, and March. With them went scores of women of a certain class, dressed in men’s clothes and hauling their feminine wardrobes on sleds.\n\nIt would be an error to suppose that the motive which led all these people to plunge into a trackless wilderness in the rigors of a Northern winter was alone the hope of large and sudden gain. It was the adventure and the daring and excitement of the affair which appealed to their imaginations, as well as the prospect of making money. To be “a stampeder” is to be something of a hero, and the wild life of a new mining camp is full of charms — to those who like it. Even men of education and of some fineness of intellectual fiber discover a fascination in sleeping on pine boughs in a log cabin, living on bacon, beans, and dried apples, pawing around in the dirt, and listening to the grotesque tales, the boasting and blarney, and the fantastic oaths of a mining camp.\n\nThe Coeur d’Alene Mountains are the northernmost part of the great Bitter Root chain, which, swinging off to the westward of the Rocky Mountain ranges in Southern Montana, leaves one principal valley and numerous lateral valleys between it and the main divide, and ends at Lake Pend d’Oreille, in northern Idaho, in a confusion of separate ranges and groups. The name Coeur d’Alene means heart of an awl, or awl-hearted, and was bestowed by the early French trappers upon the tribe of Indians inhabiting the shores of the lake on the western side of the mountains. The tradition is, that the trappers found these Indians so inhospitable and so close in their fur-bartering operations that they declared that their hearts were no bigger than the point of a shoe-maker’s awl. So the name stuck, first to the tribe, then to the lake, then to the river, which is the lake’s principal affluent, and to the mountains it drains, and lately it has been applied to everything connected with the new mining camp. Placer gold is found on both sides of the mountains, but chiefly on the western slope, in the deep and narrow ravines drained by the little streams that form the Coeur d’Alene River.\n\nAs long ago as 1867 a party of prospectors, headed by a man named Wilson, penetrated the Coeur d’Alene Mountains, and reported that gold existed there; but the region was at that time much too remote to attract miners from the prosperous gulches of Montana and Southern Idaho, and the memory of the Wilson expedition had almost faded out, when, in the fall of 1882, a man named Pritchard made his way from the old Jesuit Mission, on the Coeur d’Alene River, up that stream to its head-waters, and came back asserting that he had found gold in paying quantities. His reports were generally doubted, but some restless ex-miners in Deer Lodge and Bozeman, Montana, organized a party in the spring of 1883 and started into the mountains. This expedition is known in the history of the present camp as the Bozeman stampede. The party found the snow about twelve feet deep in the gulches, and returned disgusted. While traversing central Montana, in May of that year, I met some of these stampeders on their way home. They declared that there was no gold in the Coeur d’Alenes, and that they had left Pritchard hanging to a tree. They were wrong in both statements. Gold there is, as subsequent events have shown, and Pritchard is alive and still digging for the yellow nuggets. In the fall of 1883 he discovered what is known as the “Widow’s Claim,” so named by him in honor of a friendly widow who had “grub-staked” him, — that is, furnished him with money to live on while prospecting. Stories of the gold found on “the Widow” got abroad on both sides of the mountains, and a few people made their way into the new diggings before the snows fell.\n\nThe great rush did not occur, however, until February, when the toboggan period began. A toboggan is the long, low sled used in Canada, and until the snows melted in April last it was the only mode of transportation to the mines. The toboggan men, wearing snow-shoes, and hauling from one to two hundred pounds on their rude sleds, could make from ten to twenty miles a day over the mountains, following the “blazing” on the trees that indicated the trail. When they camped at night they cut green saplings and laid them on the snow to support their fire. In the morning the smouldering embers would be down at the bottom of a well in the snow twelve or fifteen feet deep. Twenty-five cents a pound was the price for hauling freight from the railroad forty miles to the camp established in the fall at the forks of Eagle Creek, and called Eagle City. Sometimes the toboggan men sold the goods and pocketed the proceeds, and even if they were tolerably honest there was sure to be a serious shortage in the whisky and tobacco invoices.\n\nA glance at a map of the region will show that the Northern Pacific Railroad makes a long loop to get around the Coeur d’Alene Mountains, going northward down Clark’s Fork as far as Lake Pend d’Oreille, and then turning to the south-west. The first explorers went in from the western slope of the mountains, following up the Coeur d’Alene River and fording its icy waters thirty-six times up to their saddle-girths. The stampeders mainly went in from the east, penetrating the dense forests and climbing over the mountains. Trails were opened from two stations in the woods on the Clark’s Fork, — Belknap and Thompson’s Falls, — and both developed into mushroom cities of shanties and tents as outfitting points. It was at one or the other of these places that the adventurers from the East bought their toboggans, their blankets, and their grub-stakes. Those from Oregon and Washington Territory, together with the “old timers” from California, opened a trail from the old Mullan Road, near the Coeur d’Alene Mission, over two or three ranges to the camp on Eagle Creek. To the snow-shoe and toboggan mode of transportation succeeded the pack-mule trail, and in the spring a wagon-road was cut through the forest, from Thompson’s Falls up to the foot of the mountains. On the western side of the mountains the Mullan Road, built by the Government before the Civil War as a military and emigrant route from Fort Benton, on the Upper Missouri, to Walla Walla, near the Columbia, afforded, in connection with a steam-boat on Lake Coeur d’Alene and the river, access to a point called Jackass Prairie, about twenty miles from the mines. There was still another route opened. Bateaux were built, and by dint of much pluck and muscle, goods and machinery were poled up the swift river thirty-five miles above the head of steam-boat navigation. Thus the camp got its communications opened, such as they were, with the outside world.\n\nIt was a wild, strange settlement that grew up on the snow, in the lonely mountain gorge, at the junction of Eagle and Pritchard Creeks. Everybody was gay and hopeful. There was no lack of amusement of the sort most popular in mining towns. Song and dance halls, half tent, half shanty, were opened. Gamblers arrived by the dozen from Leadville, which has grown quiet and respectable of late. Of ten buildings or tents, nine were sure to be drinking-saloons. A glass of whisky cost half a dollar. The Jew trader followed close upon the heels of the saloonkeeper, with his stock of goods. Wherever gold is discovered the whisky-seller is just behind the prospector, and the enterprising Hebrew merchant is never far in the rear. Hundreds of adventurers who had followed the construction camps on the Northern Pacific Railroad, and had been left stranded when that highway was completed, drifted into the new diggings. There was enough good material in the population to keep a fair degree of order, however, among the steady element being a considerable sprinkling of farmers from the Palouse Country in western Idaho, and eastern Washington, who staked out claims on the snow with the rest.\n\nSociety organizes itself with great rapidity under such circumstances. Lawyers and doctors pitch their tents and put up signs, split out of cedar stumps and inscribed with the red end of a hot poker. All the necessary articles for miners’ use are brought in. Carpenters, blacksmiths, shoe-makers, and bakers who have come to dig for gold find they can do better by plying their respective trades. A weekly newspaper chronicles the events of the camp. Almost all callings are represented except those of teaching and preaching. There are no children, and Sunday is abolished. In a rude sort of way the ordinary appliances of living are obtained. Knives and frying-pans must be brought in, but washbowls, or troughs, are hewn out of pine logs; stools and benches take the place of chairs, and “Idaho feathers,” as pine boughs are called, do not make a bad mattress when covered with blankets. Tin cups and plates serve for queen’s-ware. The bill of fare is alike for breakfast, dinner, and supper, but appetites are enormous when men have been tramping over the mountains prospecting, or wielding the pick and shovel all day.\n\nWhen the snow went off the stampeders got to work. A few paying placers were opened, but in most cases the bed-rock was found to be from twelve to twenty feet below the surface, and covered with deposits of gravel and bowlders [sic]. It took an enormous amount of labor to get down to it. The “pay streak,” in most diggings, is found just on top of the first stratum of rock below the soil, the particles of gold having, in the course of ages, worked down through the earth until stopped by the rock. In the Coeur d’Alene region the miners had to work through an enormous amount of surface deposit. Those who got down, however, found free gold in flakes and chunks. The largest nugget discovered was worth three hundred and twenty dollars. That was found in Dream Gulch. To this gulch attaches a romantic story. One night in August, 1883, a man named Davis, who lived in Farmington, in the Palouse Country, and had been thinking of going to the Coeur d’Alene region, had a dream. In his dream he traveled up a heavily timbered gulch in search of gold, and turning to the left entered a side ravine. A little stream ran down the ravine. He came to a place where the stream forked, and there he found a ledge, from which he chipped pure gold with a hammer and chisel. The dense forest was unlike anything he had ever seen before. Next night the same dream came again. He chipped off more gold until he was tired, and awoke. The third night he was once more in the ravine, loading four mules with gold. The treble dream made such an impression on his mind that he persuaded two friends to go with him to the Coeur d’Alenes. After prospecting for several days he found a ravine that corresponded to the one seen in his dream. Passing up it he found it all familiar ground. He recognized the trees, the underbrush, the pools of water. The ravine forked just where he expected it would, but there was no ledge to be seen. Davis and his companions washed a pan of dirt, and found color. A second pan yielded three dollars. They dug down in the hill-side and found a quartz lode. Not long afterward a nugget, worth ninety-seven dollars, was unearthed. Davis named the place Dream Gulch. He has not yet loaded the four mules with gold, but up to the first of July, when the water gave out, he and his companions had taken forty-two thousand dollars out of that ravine. Many prospectors have tried to dream out a fortune since then, but none have had Davis’s luck.\n\n‘The bloom was off the boom,” as they say in Dakota, when I went to the Coeur d’Alenes in July last. Numbers of people had learned that locating a quartz claim on a mountainside, or sitting down in the cedar woods of a gulch and imagining how much gold there may be under twenty feet of gravel, is not a short cut to wealth. It costs a great deal of money to open a placer, and a great deal more to get gold out of quartz, and most of the stampeders had only enough to keep them in provisions for a few weeks. They hoped to sell their claims, but no one came with capital to buy. Very few were able to dig ditches, build sluices, and begin cleaning the bed-rock. An exodus from the mines began in June, and continued in a straggling way all summer. “It was not a poor man’s country,” said the returning adventurers, as they footed it over the mountains to the railroad. “What could a fellow do with only a shovel, a pick, and a plug of tobacco, when it took a thousand dollars’ worth of labor to get down to the pay dirt?” All the trails were filled with processions of melancholy men, sweating and swearing under their loads of dirty blankets. Among them were merchants who had sold out their stocks at a loss, and gamblers looking for more promising fields. The camps were by no means deserted, however. Only the drift-wood went out on the ebb of the tide.\n\nThe best way to visit the mines is to go in on the trail from Thompson’s Falls, over the mountains, and come out by way of the river, floating down the swift current in a canoe. As a mode of travel the canoe is much more comfortable than what is commonly called the hurricane deck of a Cayuse pony, but, on the other hand, it is much more risky. The tourist can avoid the canoe, but the only alternative to the pony is going afoot. My companion and I set out from Thompson’s Falls one morning, mounted on sorry nags, and dragging a pack animal along, Indian fashion, by a rope attached to his neck and twisted about his lower jaw. We turned to take a last look at the broad, green river, slipping along to the foaming, roaring rapids, at the raw little shanty town beyond, which has three hundred inhabitants and thirty saloons, and at the near horizon of mountain summits, and then entered the forest. “You can’t get off the trail, unless you cut your way out with an axe,” was the parting salutation of the owner of the ponies. He was right. Nothing less nimble than a deer could well get through the jungle of fallen trunks and underbrush that covered the ground between the tall pines, tamaracks, and cedars. This superb forest of the Pend d’Oreille is a vast lumber preserve for future generations The pineries of Michigan and Minnesota look like open parks compared with it. Nowhere else in the United States, save on the western slopes of the western mountains, in Washington Territory, can be found such a prodigious amount of timber to the acre. It stretches along both sides of the Pend d’Oreille, or Clark’s Fork River, for a hundred and fifty miles, and laps over the Coeur d’Alene and Bitter Root Mountains, embracing Lake Coeur d’Alene and its tributary rivers, and having a width of at least a hundred miles. The bull pine is the predominant tree; but there is considerable white pine, tamarack, and fir, and in places the cedar excludes all other trees, and attains a surprising girth and height.\n\nFollowing a trail through the gloomy solitudes of this wilderness is not a cheerful proceeding. The sky is rarely visible, and there are no sounds to break the stillness, save the roar of a torrent, or a crashing in the underbrush and a whiffling grunt that tell of the retreat of a bear. The incidents are the fording of streams, scrambling over rocks, and plunging through mire. In our case there was the adventure of running the gauntlet through a forest fire. The flames were on both sides of the trail. There was no way of getting around them with the horses, and it was a question of turning back or dashing through; so the little caravan was put to a gallop, and after an exciting minute in the smoke, came out with no damage, save some singeing of hair. If a traveler be tough and well-mounted he can go in a day’s hard ride from Thompson’s Falls to Murray, the chief mining camp; but one unused to the saddle gets all the journey he wants for one day when he reaches a half-way station called Mountain House, where there is a clearing big enough to see the sky through. A log hotel, a store in a tent, two canvas lodging- houses, and three saloons give the place quite an urban look. The hotel has two rooms — the front room being bar, sleeping apartment, and sitting-room, and the rear division the kitchen and dining-room. The sleeping accommodations consist of two tiers of berths, in which tamarack poles serve as springs, and pine boughs as mattresses. Half a dollar seemed a reasonable price to the tired wayfarers for the privilege of spreading their blankets on the boughs and enjoying the sense of shelter and the pleasant warmth of a fire burning without stove or chimney in the middle of the room, and sending its column of smoke up through a big square hole in the roof. Of the fare served in the other apartment by the dignified, military-looking gentleman who acted as cook, it can truthfully be said that, if not choice, it was abundant, and that the flapjacks were beyond criticism. In the days of the stampeders and the toboggan trains, this was the only house on the trail, and a blessed haven of rest it seemed to many a poor fellow struggling through the snow.\n\n“How do you hook up?” was the landlord’s greeting in the morning, a teamster’s salutation much in use in Montana. The old miner usually asks, “How do you pan out?” or “How are you striking it?” The truth is, we hooked up badly after a night on the tamarack poles, but the mountain air and the flapjacks were good restoratives. Sundry specimens of silver ore from ledges near by were examined, a look taken at a ditch down ten feet on its way to bed-rock and an uncertainty, and then the horses were mounted and the trail was resumed. The forest grew denser. The day before it seemed as if trees could not grow closer together than they did along that part of the trail, but higher up they stood in such serried array that a pack-mule could not squeeze through between them. Away up in the air some two hundred feet was a little slit through which the sky could be seen. It was like looking out of a deep crevice. The trail grew more and more abrupt, and the divide was reached after three hours’ travel.\n\nThe line between Montana and Idaho follows the crest of the range. Probably the summit of the pass is five thousand feet above the sea level. The mountains on either side rise probably two thousand feet higher. They are not rugged and precipitous like some of the ranges of the Rockies, but carry timber almost to their rounded, green summits, and in midsummer show only patches of snow. The trail was enlivened by meeting numerous pack-trains going out for return loads, parties of prospectors, and numerous pedestrians of a class indicated on the register of the hotel at Thompson’s Falls by the letters “D. B.” opposite their names, meaning “dead broke.” It is the kind custom of the country not to refuse a meal to these unfortunate reformed stampeders.\n\nOn the western side of the mountains the trail plunges down into a narrow, dark ravine, where Pritchard’s Creek rises. Every few rods there are written notices stuck on the trees announcing that the undersigned claims “five hundred feet of the gulch from rim-rock to rim-rock,” but no mining is seen until one gets down to Raven, the most advanced settlement toward the pass. Here are a dozen cabins and a mine on a mountain-side, where the dirt is thrown into a wooden slide, and so got down to the creek for washing. The cleanup averages about ten dollars a day per man, and the owner said that as he could hire men for four dollars a day he had a fairly good thing. He emptied a buckskin bag of small nuggets and dust, and thrust his fingers through the yellow stuff in an affectionate way. Three miles farther down the creek is Butte, a new camp of log huts in the thick woods. Here some sluicing was in progress. This place bears no resemblance to its namesake in Montana, save in the hopes of its founders. Near Butte is the “Mother Lode,” whose discovery last May was the talk of all the camps. Miners suppose that all gold placers were caused by the breaking up of some rich lode in the mountains by convulsions of the ground in old geologic times. To find this “Mother Lode” is the object of much zealous prospecting. Three old farmers from Washington Territory had the luck to find in the mountain-side, close to the creek, a vein that is accepted as the mother of the Coeur d’Alene placers. They uncovered a bowlder [sic] about four feet in diameter, thickly splashed on its surface with gold, and containing several rich veins. The lead to which it belonged they opened for a few yards from the bank to the creek. Then they sat down to look at their wonderful find, and to enjoy the congratulations of visitors — the happiest trio to be found in all the camps of the Coeur d’Alene country. When I saw them and their gold-streaked bowlder, they were waiting for some one to come and offer them forty thousand dollars for their claim.\n\nA little farther down the stream, wedged in a narrow crease between precipitous mountains, is Murray, now the chief town of the Coeur d’Alene country. It is composed of a hideous half-mile-long street of huts, shanties, and tents, with three or four cross-streets that run against the steep slopes after a few rods progress. The discovery of Dream Gulch, of the Mother Lode, and of several other promising leads and placers near by, created Murray last spring, and almost depopulated Eagle, the other center of the region, five miles below. A more unattractive place than Murray I have seldom seen. The trees have been cleared away, leaving a bare gulch into which the sun pours for sixteen hours a day with a fervor which seems to be designed by nature to make up for the coolness of the short July nights, when fires are needed. Stumps and half-charred logs encumber the streets, and serve as seats for the inhabitants. Chairs can only be found in the principal gambling establishments. Every second building is a drinking"
