This biography was written by Henry Martin Tanner's son in 1964.\n\nThe Mormon colony of San Bernardino was established in 1851 and abandoned by the faithful in 1857 when Brigham Young ordered them back to Utah because of the approach of Johnston's army. The Sidney Tanner family was among the first colonists who settled Beaver City, Utah Territory, upon their return from California. Henry Martin Tanner grew up in Beaver and married Eliza Ellen Parkinson in 1877, in the St. George Temple just after he received his call to go to Arizona to colonize. This group of Arizona pioneers crossed the Colorado River at Pearce's Ferry March 19, 1878, taking two days to ferry the wagons and animals across. They joined the settlers at Joseph City the first part of May 1878. Those called on the mission to Arizona were expected to enter the United Order. This concept succeeded in varying degrees. In Joseph City it lasted ten years. The Articles of Association and Rules of the United Order had to be signed by all who participated. Consecration of properties was expected and recorded by a board of appraisers. People withdrawing from the Order were reimbursed according to the amount given and labor performed. In 1882-83 the Order was changed to a stewardship. Necessity demanded that the colonies be self-supporting. They had their own gristmill, sawmill, tannery, spinning wheels and looms, and dairy. Attempts at fruit and berry raising were unsuccessful because of the climate. In 1885 under the stewardship, Henry M. Tanner chose land to improve and build a house on. The following chapters portray a good picture of life in Joseph City.\n\nGenealogical information on the Henry Martin Tanner family is included in the biography. 140 pages.\n\n2 11\n\nWalbeck, Alexander William\n\nJoined Joseph City United Order on May 5, 1880.

All, including Joanna, retained the Westover name. She raised all nine children with very little or no help from Despain who had another family to care for.

He was impressed with the United Order and joined at Sunset. He served a mission with Indians in the Rio Grande Valley. In 1879-1880 he served as second counselor to President Lot Smith. He married Miss Susan Morilla Bates at St. George in 1887. He was called by Wilford Woodruff to go on a mission to England to become assistant editor of the Millennial Star (1889). In 1912 he was living at Dry Lake in northern Arizona, and in 1913 was called for another mission to England as associate editor of the Millennial Star. He was released from his mission in 1914 and returned to Salt Lake and bought a small farm in Sandy. His family was living in Flagstaff, and when he suggested they all move to Utah \"there was no favorable response.\" In 1927 Brookbank visited his son, J. O., in Glendale. He returned to Salt Lake and lived there at the writing of this narrative in 1933.\n\n(II) \"A Soldier's Recollections.\" This portion of the autobiography relates his experiences in the army during the Civil War, 1864-1865.\n\n(III) \"Religious Experiences.\" Brookbank met a Mr. McLaughlin, a newspaper editor, on the train headed for Beaver. Brookbank was persuaded to go on to Beaver. He stopped over night at Scipio and learned that they needed a school teacher. He applied and got the job. After much examination, he joined the church in April of 1877 at Scipio. In the spring of 1879 a company of eighty persons was organized at Scipio to go to Arizona to settle somewhere in the White Mountains region. They went by way of Lee's Ferry. Conditions were very difficult and before they reached MoenKopi the teams and people were suffering. The land the group had planned to settle had been withdrawn by the government and so the members of the company disbanded and went to the other settlements. Brookbank went to Sunset where he became a member of the United Order under Lot Smith. He and others were detailed to go to the Meadows (land purchased by Tenney) to prevent the Mexicans from moving on the land. While at Sunset Brookbank married Edith Porter, April 4, 1883. They were divorced in 1888. Brookbank served a mission to the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico, then moved to Chihuahua where he remained only a short time. His companion, Brother Wilchen was ordered on to Mexico City. Brookbank returned to Albuquerque because of poor health. Until he was called by Wilford Woodruff to serve a mission in England, he wrote articles for publication in the Deseret News, Contributor, and Juvenile Instructor. His first mission to the British Isles was in 1889 when he received an urgent call to become associate editor of the Millennial Star. His finances were limited--while in Salt Lake waiting for his date to sail he met John W. Young who gave him 50.00 dollars to help on his mission. As associate editor of the Millennial Star he wrote many of the editorials. His editorials were signed simply \"B.\" Again because of ill health Brookbank returned to Arizona in 1891. During the next few years he farmed and taught school at MoenAva, Tuba City, and Lee's Ferry. In 1913 he was called to fill another mission to the British Isles to work on the Millennial Star. Once again he returned because of ill health. 55 pages.\n\n7 2\n\nLake, George\n\n\"The Life of George Lake,\" bound typescript. A note in the Preface of the manuscript indicates it was written by George Lake. The original manuscript is in the possession of Lawrence Lake, of El Segundo, California. The typescript copy was made for members of the Lake family. George Lake, born September 15, 1838, at Scott Company, Illinois, was one of ten children. In 1844 his family moved to Nauvoo where his father helped build the temple and the Nauvoo House. In February 1846, with about six hundred wagons the family crossed the Missouri River and arrived at Council Bluffs in the fall. They arrived in Salt Lake City, October 7, 1850, moved to Ogden Fort, and later moved to a farm in Harrisville. In 1857 George Lake went back to meet the immigrating Saints and help them through to Salt Lake Valley. He spent six weeks in Echo Canyon awaiting Johnston's Army in 1858. He states that during the campaign they took fifty prisoners from the United States Army. Lake was sent with his company as an \"escort to return the prisoners beyond the confines of our territory some 150 miles.\" When he returned to the valley he found that the Saints had moved south--a rear guard had been left to guard the property. \"If necessary they were to burn all our possessions.\" Lake remained with this group as a cook. He writes, \"The territory was given military organization and I was ordered to fit up well. . .and ready to mount at a moments notice. All feared an attempt by the U. S. Army to renew the Nauvoo tragedy. The army was still quartered some sixty miles south of Salt Lake City.\" On May 13, 1860, Lake married Louise Ann Garner Lake, the widow of His brother. They had eight children. When Lake took his endowments, Louise Ann was sealed to her first husband. After the ceremony Brigham Young praised him and told him to return in two weeks with two more wives for himself. \"Hence on the 4th of October I took to wife Sarah Jane Hill . . . and Rhoda Wheeler . . . .\" Several pages here are given to a listing of his wives (four) and his children. At the April conference of 1869, Lake was called to serve a mission in England. He was gone two years returning in 1871 with four hundred converts. A smallpox epidemic broke out on ship and a quarantine was imposed. Vaccinations were given all the passengers. In 1871 Lake sold out and moved to Oxford, Idaho, where he was promptly made bishop. He was hounded by United States marshals during the polygamy hunt. While seeking advice from Brigham Young he was assigned to go south to Arizona. Brigham Young said \"We will form a line of settlements leading into South America, and this shall be the stepping stone.\" George Lake had charge of the company called from Cache, Box Elder, and other counties; Lot Smith was to have charge of those from Salt Lake and Davis counties; and Jesse Ballinger and William Coleman Allen were to head those from north of Salt Lake. George Lake located at a place he named Obed. William C. Allen located on the opposite side of the river. Lot Smith and Jesse Ballinger settled at or near Sunset Crossing. They set about immediately to build forts, homes, dams, and canals. Crops had been planted and prospered when a heavy flood washed out the dam and ruined the crops. At this time many took up the line of march home leaving only nine men to establish the mission and United Order. Lake abandoned this settlement and joined Ballinger's camp. John W. Young came to organize a stake of Zion. Lot Smith was appointed president of the United Order. \"There was much opposition and ridicule from many these days of peace and joy.\" Lake was sent to represent the Democratic party at that party's convention held in Phoenix. He spent six years in the United Order, and after final settlement went to Mexico. 31 pages. Another shorter sketch covering the same material in a more general form is included in the collection.\n\n7 3\n\nPorter, Samuel U.\n\nThe autobiography of Samuel Porter begins with page 16 and ends on page 24. Only the portion concerned with the Arizona expedition is included. This is a xerox copy of the handwritten autobiography. On October 19, 1878, Porter started to Arizona and arrived at Sunset, December 1878. He was impressed with the large table where everyone ate meals and described the building which included a kitchen and bakery. His first assignment in the United Order was a trip to the sawmill to pick up lumber. He started with four head of \"cattle\" and two wagons and traveled to Brigham City where he joined Elijah Hancock who was on his way to the mill. He spent Christmas day on the way to the sawmill, and ate Christmas dinner at the mill. In 1887 he was called to work at the Mormon Dairy, which was located in a little valley five miles long and four miles wide. The dairy was owned by three companies--Joseph City, Sunset, and Brigham City. All the cows were in one corral and each company milked their own cows. There were two hundred cows: Sunset, sixty; Brigham City, sixty; and Joseph City, forty head. The dairy was organized into a ward called the Pleasant Valley Branch. Porter tells of an incident of \"casting out of the evil one.\" He states there is much wild game--deer, antelope, and turkeys. Wilford Woodruff spent a winter with them and while there he counseled the people and visited several different tribes of Indians. Porter said, \"Everybody seemed to love him.\" Woodruff celebrated his seventy-third birthday, March 1, 1880, at Sunset. Porter relates an incident of healing by laying on of hands. On August 17, 1880, Porter started back to Utah traveling with Thomas W. Brookbank.\n\n7 4\n\nCall, Israel\n\nFamily stories, one volume. 51 pages.

Rogers, written in 1946. Andrew Locy Rogers was born in 1854 to Thomas and Aurelia Spencer Rogers in Salt Lake City. He grew up in Farmington, Utah. In 1876 Locy was called by Brigham Young in Captain Lot Smith's company with two hundred other Saints to help settle northern Arizona. The trip took three months and proved to be one of the most difficult missions ever attempted. Immediately upon arriving at Sunset they began building a dam, planting crops, digging ditches, and building a fort. Since there was very little money, most of the business was done by barter. In 1879 Locy returned to Farmington to marry Clara Maria Gleason and then returned to Arizona. They lived in the United Order of Sunset five years. Locy's main job in the settlement was to tend the sheep herd. This meant following the sheep wherever there was food. Much of this time Clara went with him even though she had babies and small children. The author relates the story of Locy finding 6,000 dollars in gold pieces while herding sheep. It was returned to the man from whom it had been stolen and a generous reward was given Locy. When the United Order broke up and most of the people returned to Utah, Locy moved his family to Allen's camp (now Joseph City), then later to Snowflake where he continued to farm and also turned to freighting. Locy helped build Snowflake. He served a mission to Great Britain in 1908 and one to California in 1927. In 1918 Locy and Clara were called to work in the Arizona temple. Clara died in 1932 and in 1935 Locy married Isabella Webb. This second marriage was unsuccessful, and in 1937 he married Florence Thomas Blain. Locy died in 1943 at the age of eighty-nine and was buried in Snowflake, Arizona. 8 pages.\n\nRogers, Clara Maria Gleason: \"Life Sketch of Clara Maria Gleason Rogers,\" by Lenora S. Rogers.

Anson took custody of the children. Israel had a very hard life in his youth but became determined to get an education. These school plans were interrupted after the first year when he was called to go to Arizona in 1875. The company from Bountiful included Wilford Barlow, Parley Willey, Kepler Sessions, Joseph J. Holbrook, Joseph Hyrum Holbrook, Daniel Moss, Peter C. Wood, and George C. Wood. The group secured a place near Sunset Crossing on the Little Colorado and began clearing land and planting crops.
