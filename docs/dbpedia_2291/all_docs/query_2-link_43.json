        "text": "Judson Daniel Mackintosh\n\n“Big Dan”\n\nOur amazing husband, father, grandpa, grandpa great, brother and friend passed away, surrounded by loved ones at home on Oct. 16, 2015. Dan and Wanda just celebrated 66 years of marriage on Sept. 28 th , with their children. Dan was born on April 2, 1931 in Salt Lake City, UT, to Daniel James and Gwendolyn “Gwen” Mackintosh.\n\nHe lived a wonderful life, full of adventure and creativity, growing up in the small railroad town of Minidoka, Idaho. After graduating from Rupert High School, he rode his “44” Harley Davidson “Knucklehead” down to the big city where he attended the University of Utah. He met the love of his life, Wanda Andrus, and convinced her to spend the eternities with him. They were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on September 28, 1949. Their first home was an apt. in the historic Milo Andrus home (Holladay, UT). They bought a home in Glendale Park, UT and then built their home of 59 years in Butler/Cottonwood Heights, UT.\n\nFamily and hard work have always been Dan's most important attributes. He lived and sacrificed for his family. He worked for the State Roads, was a talented mechanic with Dart's Auto, became known as “Big Dan” while working 18+ years with Bullough Asbestos and spent 45 years in Real Estate.\n\nHe had a great love for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and gave his whole heart, no matter the calling, in the service of his fellow men. Dan's love of the Savior was reflected in his willingness and energy exerted, in doing whatever was asked of him. A highlight in Dan and Wanda's marriage, was serving a mission to his ancestry in the Scotland, Edinburgh Mission. He was asked to extend his service, as bishop to the saints he loved in beautiful Inverness.\n\nHis motto of “work hard, play hard” was magnified when the chores were done. He took his family skiing, fishing, hunting, waterskiing at Lake Powell, camping, horseback riding, swimming, motorcycle riding and playing on the front lawn. He mastered the art of telling jokes, kept you mesmerized with his stories and all road trips were harmonized sing-a-longs of his childhood songs. He was a great tenor and sang in numerous choirs and quartets throughout his life.\n\nTogether, Dan and Wanda had 5 children: Dan (Julie) Mackintosh, Karen (Mike) Eades, Judd (Debbie) Mackintosh, Scott (Becky) Mackintosh, Lynne (Cory) Stevenson. Preceded in death by his parents and half brothers/sisters. He is survived by his wife, children, 27 grandchildren and 45 great-grandchildren, sister Gwen Fennell and brother Dean Mackintosh. The family is extremely grateful to hospice caregivers Erica, Janel, Theresa, Jamie and Rosie, whose compassion and kindness went above duty. Thank you!\n\nFuneral services will be held Saturday, October 24, 2015, 11:00 a.m. at the Salt Lake Brighton 1 st Ward, 2925 E. Bengal Blvd. (7800 S.) A visitation will be held Friday, October 23, 2015 at the Cannon Mortuary, 2460 E.
