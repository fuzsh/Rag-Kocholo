        "text": "The event known as the First Vision gradually took its place as the founding story of Mormonism. As it rose to prominence, contemporary saints recorded recollections of times that the Prophet shared his sacred experience in the grove with them, resulting in several later reminiscences. These are found in transcripts of sermons, missionary tracts, and memoirs of these faithful pioneer saints. Since these accounts have a barrier of time—increasing the chances of faulty memory—they are not as reliable as contemporary secondary or primary accounts of the vision, but are of interest nonetheless.\n\nThe apostles and missionaries of the Church were among the earliest people to publish accounts of the vision. Building on the tradition that Orson Pratt and Orson Hyde began by including recitals of the vision in their missionary pamphlets, John Taylor and Lorenzo Snow produced their own versions of the vision for their fields of labor. The earlier of these two was written by Elder Taylor for the French mission in 1850. As it has come to us, this record went as follows:\n\nThe church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was first organized in the Town of Manchester, Ontario County, State of New York, U.S.A., 6th April 1830. Previous to this an holy angel appeared unto a young man about fifteen years of age, a farmer’s son, named Joseph Smith, and communicated unto him many things pertaining to the situation of the religious world, the necessity of a correct church organization, and unfolded many events that should transpire in the last days, as spoken of by the Prophets. As near as possible I will give the words as he related them to me. He said that “in the neighborhood in which he resided there was a religious revival, (a thing very common in that country) in which several different denominations were united; that many professed to be converted; among the number, two or three of his father’s family. When the revival was over, there was a contention as to which of these various societies the person who was converted should belong. One of his father’s family joined one society, and another a different one. His mind was troubled, he saw contention instead of peace, and division instead of union; and when he reflected upon the multifarious creeds and professions there were in existence, he thought it impossible for all to be right, and if God taught one, He did not teach the others, “for God is not the author of confusion.” In reading his bible, he was remarkably struck with the passage in James, 1st chapter, 5th verse. “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.” Believing in the word of God, he retired into a grove, and called upon the Lord to give him wisdom in relation to this matter. While he was thus engaged, he was surrounded by a brilliant light, and two glorious personages presented themselves before him, who exactly resembled each other in features, and who gave him information upon the subjects which had previously agitated his mind. He was given to understand that the churches were all of them in error in regard to many things; and he was commanded not to go after them; and he received a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be unfolded unto him; after which the vision withdrew leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace (Taylor 255-256).\n\nWe see in John Taylor’s account influences of both the Pratt-Hyde-Smith publications and the “official” 1838 account. Elder Taylor would go on to be, perhaps, the man who spoke of the vision second most often, after Orson Pratt and there are many sermons recorded in the Journal of Discourses and other sources in which this man of God spoke of the First Vision.\n\nBefore we look at the accounts that come from Orson Pratt’s discourses, however, the second of the missionary accounts mentioned above was written by Lorenzo Snow as he labored in Italy as an apostle in 1852 as part of a larger pamphlet known in English as The Voice of Joseph. His account was as follows:\n\nJoseph Smith, junior, whom it pleased the Lord to select and appoint to restore the primitive Gospel and apostolic Priesthood, was born in 1805 in Vermont, United States. When about 15 years of age, being seriously impressed with the necessity of seeking the Lord and preparing for a future state, his mind became much perplexed through difficulties thrown in the path of his researches by the multitude of religious sects and parties with which he was surrounded. Each system claimed its right and power to give belief and hope, but none to communicate knowledge of its divine Authority. In comparing them one with another there seemed too much confusion, the same also appeared in looking at each separately:–turning therefore from these clashing systems, and having been encouraged, and inspired with the following passage in St. James “If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God;” he retired to a grove, a little distance from his father’s, and in fervent prayer besought the Lord to communicate with him, and reveal the way of salvation. While thus engaged a light brilliant and glorious appeared in the heavens gradually descending towards him till he was enveloped in its power, and wrapped in celestial vision; when he beheld two glorious beings similar in dress and appearance who informed him that the religious sects had all departed from the ancient doctrine of the apostles, and that the Gospel, with its gifts and blessings should be made known to him at a future period. Many important things were manifested in this vision which the brevity of this work will not admit our noticing (Snow 1).\n\nMuch like the John Taylor tract, this publication depends much on the previously-published accounts of the Wentworth Letter, the Pratt and Hyde pamphlets and the 1838 account. Nevertheless, Elder Snow has left us a polished and pleasant account of the First Vision.\n\nA few years after the Snow account was published, Elder Orson Pratt spoke of the First Vision again, as he did more often than any other general authority of his lifetime. In a sermon dated as the 14th of August 1859, he said,\n\nWhat is the testimony of the Latter−day Saints in regard to the calling of any one in this church? We want now to test ourselves. Are we the kingdom of God that was to be established in the last days? or are we not? Have we the characteristics of that kingdom? Have we been called in that way and manner that the servants of God in ancient days were called?\n\nTo answer this question, let us go back to Joseph Smith − the one that organized this church by the commandment of the Almighty…. I will give you a brief history as it came from his own mouth. I have often heard him relate it.\n\nHe was wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and felt the necessity of repenting of his sins and serving God. He retired from his father’s house a little way, and bowed himself down in the wilderness, and called upon the name of the Lord. He was inexperienced, and in great anxiety and trouble of mind in regard to what church he should join. He had been solicited by many churches to join with them, and he was in great anxiety to know which was right. He pleaded with the Lord to give him wisdom on the subject; and while he was thus praying, he beheld a vision, and saw a light approaching him from the heavens; and as it came down and rested on the tops of the trees, it became more glorious; and as it surrounded him, his mind was immediately caught away from beholding surrounding objects. In this cloud of light he saw two glorious personages; and one, pointing to the other, said, “Behold my beloved son! hear ye him.” Then he was instructed and informed in regard to many things pertaining to his own welfare, and commanded not to unite himself to any of those churches. He was also informed that at some future time the fulness of the Gospel should be made manifest to him, and he should be an instrument in the hands of God of laying the foundation of the kingdom of God (JD 7:220-221).\n\nElder Pratt would testify of the Prophet’s First Vision to the end of his life and—like John Taylor and many other general authorities—could fill up several pages with quotes about the First Vision. For brevity, however, we will look at only one other sermon in which he retold the vision towards the end of his life. Orson sated,\n\nJoseph Smith, …was a boy about fourteen years of age at the time the Lord first revealed himself in a very marvelous manner to him. The circumstances were these: This boy, in attending religious meetings that were held in his neighborhood, seemed to be wrought upon in a very wonderful manner, and he felt great concern in relation to the salvation of his soul… but how to satisfy himself he did not know. If he went to one denomination they would say, “We are right, and the others are wrong,” and so said all the others. Like most boys of his age, Joseph had never read the Bible to any great extent, hence he was unable to decide in his own mind, as to which was the true church. When he saw several denominations contending one with the other, he naturally enough supposed that some of them must be wrong. He began to search the Bible in his leisure time after his work was done upon the farm; and in perusing the New Testament, he came across a passage which is very familiar indeed to most of my hearers; the passage reads thus − If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” Mr. Smith really believed this passage. He did not read this as one would read a novel, thinking that is was all imaginary; but, from his heart, he believed that it meant what it said, and he said to himself − “I certainly lack wisdom in relation to my duty. I do not know which of these denominations is correct, and which is the church of Christ. I desire to know, with all my heart, and I will go before the Lord, and call upon his name, claiming his promise.” He therefore retired a short distance from his father’s house, into a little grove of timber, and called upon the Lord, claiming this promise, desiring to know his duty and to be informed where the true Church of Christ was. While thus praying, with all his heart, he discovered in the heavens above him, a very bright and glorious light, which gradually descended towards the earth, and when it reached the tops of the trees which overshadowed him, the brightness was so great that he expected to see the leaves of the tree consumed by it; but when he saw that they were not consumed he received courage. Finally the light rested down upon and overwhelmed him in the midst of it, and his mind at the same time seemed to be caught away from surrounding objects, and he saw nothing excepting the light and two glorious personages standing before him in the midst of this light. One of these personages, pointing to the other, said—’Behold my beloved Son, hear ye him.. After this, power was given to Mr. Smith to speak, and in answer to an inquiry by the Lord as to what he desired, he said that he desired to know which was the true Church that he might be united thereunto. He was immediately told, that there was no true Church of Christ on the earth, that all had gone astray, and had framed doctrines, and dogmas, and creeds by human wisdom, and that the authority to administer in the holy ordinances of the Gospel was not among men upon the earth, and he was strictly commanded to go not after any of them, but to keep aloof from the whole of them. He was also informed that, in due time, if he would be faithful in serving the Lord, according to the best of his knowledge and ability, God would reveal to him still further, and make known to him the true Gospel, the plan of salvation, in its fulness.\n\nMr. Smith had this vision before he was fifteen years old, and, immediately after receiving it, he began to relate it to some of his nearest friends, and he was told by some of the ministers who came to him to enquire about it, that there was no such thing as the visitation of heavenly messengers, that God gave no new revelation, and that no visions could be given to the children of men in this age. This was like telling him that there was no such thing as seeing, or feeling, or hearing, or tasting, or smelling. Why? Because he knew positively to the contrary; he knew that he had seen this light, that he had beheld these two personages, and that he had heard the voice of one of them;…and he continued to testify that God had made himself manifest to him (JD 17:279-280, Sept. 20, 1874).\n\nWe see here specific details not mentioned before, but that seem to be logical inferences from the texts Joseph left behind, such as telling “some of his nearest friends” in addition to multiple ministers telling him the vision was false and that he had not read the Bible very much before the religious excitement his town experienced. One could easily assume that these were memories that Pratt had from hearing Joseph talk about the vision, but as we have no other record that records the details in that manner, it is hard to tell.\n\nIn addition to the apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the rank and file members also left memoirs of hearing Joseph Smith speak of the First Vision. For example, Edward Stevenson—mentioned in a previous post for his 1893 recollection—also left a journal entry on the 27th May 1883 in which he wrote:\n\nWith uplifted hand he [Joseph Smith] said, “I am a witness that there is a God, for I saw Him in open day, while praying in a silent grove, in the spring of 1820.” He further testified that God, the Eternal Father, pointing to a separate personage, in the likeness of Himself, said, “This is my Beloved Son; hear ye Him.” O how these words thrilled my entire system and filled me with joy unspeakable—to behold one who, like Paul the Apostle of olden time, could with boldness testify that he had been in the presence of Jesus Christ! (cited in Cheesman 27-28).\n\nA more striking account comes to us through the journal of Charles L. Walker—a member of the Church from the latter part of the nineteenth century. While living in Southern Utah, he wrote,\n\n2nd February, Thursday, 1893, attended Fast meeting…. Br. John Alger said while speaking of the Prophet Joseph, that when he, John, was a small boy he heard the Prophet Joseph relate his vision of seeing the Father and the Son, that God touched his eyes with his finger and said, “Joseph this is my beloved Son, hear him.” As soon as the Lord had touched his eyes with his finger he immediately saw the Savior. After [the] meeting a few of us questioned him about the mater and he told us at the bottom of the meeting house steps that he was in the House of Father Smith in Kirtland when Joseph made this declaration; and that Joseph while speaking of it put his finger to his right eye, suiting to the action with the words so as the illustrate and at the same time impress the occurrence on the minds of those unto whom he was speaking (Cited in Cheesman 30).\n\nHere we see a detail found nowhere else that I know of—of God touching Joseph’s eyes to reveal the Savior. Since this is a tertiary account—a record written by someone recalling what someone else said or did—that was produced fifty years after Joseph died (and over seventy years after the First Vision took place), it is liable to be faulty, however it is an interesting idea.\n\nAnother post-contemporary recollection was recently unearthed in conjunction with the lost sermons project. On 17 July 1853, Milo Andrus–an early convert who had served in Zions Camp and who had served several missions–stated:\n\nRepent from your heart, reform of [your] sins, be baptized in name of Jesus Christ—and [the] promise is you shall receive the gift of Holy Ghost. What is [its] effects? [The] effects upon you [are] as it was in [the] day of Pentecost, inasmuch as you have the same experience. After you have walked in obedience to commandments of God, then the promise is you shall see visions, dream dreams, [and] have revelations of Jesus Christ—[of] which thousands in this congregation [can] rise up and testify.\n\nSuffice it to say [that] the nations of earth, both Christian and heathen, [were] in darkness, and darkness covered the nations. There [was] none to bear testimony, no prophet in [the] land. The seers, revelators, and prophets [were] all covered up by the wisdom of uninspired men. In this situation, the individual that [was]…called upon by the high courts of heaven to present a certainty to [the] human family: do you want to know who he was? I take great pleasure telling of it…\n\nI was a boy, first nineteen years of age, when I heard the testimony of that man, Joseph Smith, that [an] angel came and that glory [shone] and [the] trees seemed to be consumed in [a] blaze and he was there entrusted with this information: that darkness covered the earth, that the great mass of [the] Christian world [was] universally wrong [and] their creeds [were] all upon [an] uncertain foundation. “Now as young as you are,” [he was told], “I call upon you from this obscurity: go forth and build up my kingdom on the earth” (Andrus)\n\nAlthough not technically an account of the First Vision, it is also of interest to make at least a note about the most famous poem and hymn that memorializes the momentous event: George Manwaring’s “Joseph Smith’s First Prayer.” As sung from our hymn book today, the text is as follows:\n\nOh, how lovely was the morning!\n\nRadiant beamed the sun above.\n\nBees were humming, sweet birds singing,\n\nMusic ringing thru the grove,\n\nWhen within the shady woodland\n\nJoseph sought the God of love,\n\nWhen within the shady woodland\n\nJoseph sought the God of love.\n\nHumbly kneeling, sweet appealing–\n\n‘Twas the boy’s first uttered prayer–\n\nWhen the pow’rs of sin assailing\n\nFilled his soul with deep despair;\n\nBut undaunted, still he trusted\n\nIn his Heav’nly Father’s care;\n\nBut undaunted, still he trusted\n\nIn his Heav’nly Father’s care.\n\nSuddenly a light descended,\n\nBrighter far than noonday sun,\n\nAnd a shining, glorious pillar\n\nO’er him fell, around him shone,\n\nWhile appeared two heav’nly beings,\n\nGod the Father and the Son,\n\nWhile appeared two heav’nly beings,\n\nGod the Father and the Son.\n\n“Joseph, this is my Beloved;\n\nHear him!” Oh, how sweet the word!\n\nJoseph’s humble prayer was answered,\n\nAnd he listened to the Lord.\n\nOh, what rapture filled his bosom,\n\nFor he saw the living God;\n\nOh, what rapture filled his bosom,\n\nFor he saw the living God (Hymns 26).\n\nGeorge Manwaring was a British convert who wrote the poetry after being inspired by a painting entitled “The First Vision” created by the LDS artist C. C. Christiansen in the 1800s. The text was published in the Juvenile Instructor—a periodical published for the youth of the Church—in 1878. Prior to publication, it is apparent that this beloved poetic setting underwent some extensive editing, since in Brother Manwaring’s own notebook at least the first stanza was as follows:\n\n‘Twas on a lovely morn in spring\n\nThe sun was shining bright,\n\nWhen Joseph saw the woodland shade\n\nAnd humbly kneeling there he prayed\n\nFor Wisdom and for light.\n\nThe published edition was set to music by A.C. Smyth—a professional Mormon musician—using an expanded version of American composer Sylvanus Billings Pond’s tune, Divinity, and was published in the 1889 Latter-day Saints’ Psalmody (see Davidson 54-55), and continues to serve in our hymnbooks today as one of our more popular hymns of the Restoration.\n\nThe First Vision has taken on great importance for the Mormon people and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as whole. It is considered by many to be the greatest event to take place since the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ as it was the curtain-raising event that initiated the Restoration of the Church and Gospel of Jesus Christ in modern times. Many accounts were produced by Joseph Smith as well as people who came in contact with him. Of the latter category, many accounts were produced after Joseph Smith’s lifetime. While these accounts must be approached cautiously, they are rather interesting to read to gain insights into this important theophany. Between these records and the many other accounts that have been given, we can gain a fuller picture of the pivotal event that launched the career of the Prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith, Junior and how it has shaped the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAndrus, Milo.
