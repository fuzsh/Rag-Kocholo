        "text": "This archaeological assemblage derives from deeply stratified, well-preserved deposits that were excavated by Bishop Museum staff between 1958 and 1964. While these excavations were aimed at identifying early settlement sites on Kauaʻi, numerous foreign artefacts dating from the nineteenth century were also encountered. This article considers how these foreign materials can be used to refine the chronology of site use in the post-contact period and to gain a more robust picture of the Nuʻalolo Kai community during this important period of socioeconomic change. The analysis demonstrates that the boundary between pre-contact and \"post-contact\" lifeways, as represented in archaeological sites in Hawaiʻi and elsewhere in Polynesia, may be blurred. Moreover, the arrival of foreign goods did not have an immediate and \"fatal impact\" on traditional Hawaiian ways of life but instead denote cultural continuity, innovation and change. Finally, it is argued that trajectories of change in the household assemblages of rural nineteenth-century Hawaiʻi may have varied considerably from those seen in more connected areas of the archipelago.\n\nThis paper explores the historiography of Hawaiian mobility in the 19th century, with reference to mobilities that took place through Kānaka Maoli engagements as servants for the Hudson’s Bay Company of London. In recharting Hawaiian mobilities to the Pacific Northwest, it considers how Kānaka Maoli histories were intertwined with trans-Pacific networks of commerce and a broader Pacific world of aspirational mobility, extractive marine-based industries, and ultimately, a land-based fur trade centered initially at Fort Astoria. It discusses how Hawaiian engagements with the HBC in the Pacific Northwest were formative for their eventual incorporation into the colonial settler world of British Columbia, and examines their displacement from Oregon Territory in the wake of the 1846 boundary settlement. It incorporates themes of intimacy, encounter and hierarchy as key sites for locating Hawaiian social histories along the Northwest Coast. Finally, the Hawaiian presence in British Columbia is traced with attention to community formation and land acquisition. Whether or not they fit within a broader category of pioneer-settlers, the “Kanakas” displaced to the Northwest Coast were for a time first positioned along what historian Adele Perry has termed the “ragged margins” of empire.\n\nAbstract: Archaeology of traditional religious sites in Polynesia tends to focus on the “pre-contact” era, before religions were transformed by European influence. An historical archaeology of traditional religious sites is essential, however, for understanding the relationship between 21st-century traditional or indigenous religious beliefs and practices, and the transformations wrought during the colonial era. Traditional religion certainly did not disappear with the arrival of Christian missionaries, but there would have been some transformations. Using case studies from the Hawaiian Islands (Puhina o Lono or “Cook’s Heiau” on Hawai‘i Island and the leprosarium at Kalaupapa, Moloka‘i Island), we explore some of the ways that sacred sites were transformed in the 18th and 19th centuries. These are initial observations and we offer a number of recommendations for future research, particularly relating to the interpretation of architectural modifications and ritual offerings. The largely unexplored colonial archaeology of traditional religious sites merits a more prominent place in Polynesian archaeology. Keywords: Religious sites, historical archaeology, Hawai‘i, heiau, Captain Cook\n\nThe research of Patrick Kirch, within the Hawaiian Islands and beyond, has forged understanding of Hawaiian origins and the chronology of Polynesian island settlement for more than four decades. As he outlines in his recent review of the Hawaiian sequence, improved radiocarbon chronologies, along with new archaeological and palaeoecological evidence, has led to a growing consensus that Hawai‘i was probably settled around the 11th to 13th centuries AD. Historically, archaeologists have considered the Marquesas Islands, some 3,500 km to the southeast, a likely Hawaiian homeland. This issue is revisited here, asking whether recent studies reinforce or undermine the Marquesas Islands as a source area. New sites and new chronometric data show that the Marquesas were settled as early as any other central East Polynesian archipelago (with the possible exception of the Societies) and perhaps early enough to have fostered Hawaiian colonists. Analysis of Marquesan 14C results on short-lived materials (lifespans of ≤10 yr ) unambiguously place Polynesians in the archipelago in the 13th century, while numerous dates on other materials point to the likelihood of colonisation from the 11th to 12th centuries. Less secure results intimate colonization could date from the 10th to 11th centuries AD. Other evidence (ceramics and stone tool geochemistry) indicates multiple and unusually far-ranging regional contacts between roughly the 12th to 15th centuries, a situation which suggests superior and sustained voyaging. The evidence reviewed here is sufficient to continue entertaining the possibility that the Marquesas Islands were a departure point for the Polynesian settlers of Hawai‘i, although many uncertainties remain."
