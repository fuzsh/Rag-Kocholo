Deceased was born March 6, 1814, Essex county, New York, and was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on April 12, 1833, in Huron County, Ohio. Deceased was a president of the 10th Quorum of the Seventies, a High Priest, a member of the High Council, and a Patriarch in the church. His posterity numbers 59 children, 170 grandchildren, and 75 great-grandchildren.\"\n\nMilo Andrus Tells His Story - Our Pioneer Heritage, Vol. 14, p. 232-240\n\nMy father is a native of Hartford, Connecticut, and my mother of Rutland, Vermont. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Essex County, State of New York, where they resided until their ninth child was born, seven boys and three girls; namely, Oran, Almon, Carlo, Erasmus, Harwin, Milo, and Milo 2nd. Erasmus, Harwin, and Milo died in childhood, the dates of their deaths I cannot give in consequence of a fire that burnt up the records of my father's family. The names of my sisters were Sybil, Sarah, and Emily. My eldest brother, Oran, was born in 1797; Sybil was born in 1799; Almon was born in 1801; the dates of the others I cannot give.\n\nI, Milo 2nd, was born March 6th, 1814. When five years old, my parents moved to Dunkirk, State of New York, where they resided for one and a half years. During that time there was a circumstance occurred that seems to me to show the protecting hand of the Lord over us. I went to the shore of Lake Erie and got into a skiff on the lake, and went to sleep. When the wind arose and took the skiff onto the lake, it was not until nearly out of sight that I was picked up still sound asleep. I have always thought that the Angel of Peace then watched over me.\n\nMy parents then moved up the lake into the State of Ohio, in Huron County township of Henrietta, where they had three daughters: namely, Evaline Charlotte, born October 7, 1817; Lucina, born 1819; and Harriet, born 1821. At this writing the two eldest of my brothers are still alive and three of my youngest sisters. They have all rejected the gospel. My mother died on January 1, 1830. My father died in the winter of 1848. I shall now drop the history of the balance of the family and give a few incidents of my own history. After my mother's death, I bought the balance of my time until I was twenty-one of my father, for which I paid him one hundred and fifty dollars. In the spring of 1832, I met an elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints though I should say, previously to this time I had my mind exercised about a future state, and had read the views of Alexander Campbell, and that being the nearest to the truth of the New Testament, I had been baptized by Elder Orson Hyde, then a minister of that sect. When I compared the scriptures with the teachings of the elder of the Church of Christ, I found that he had the truth and after nearly one year, yielded to baptism.\n\nOne month and nine days previous to my baptism, I was united in marriage to Abigail Jane Daley, whose father had been baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about one year before. We were married on February 21, 1833. I was ordained an elder on May 5, 1833, under the hands of Joseph Wood. Started on my first mission in June 1833, in company with Joseph Wood, and traveled a distance of seventy miles preaching every day. We came to Kirtland where the Prophet Joseph Smith resided with his family.\n\nThe quarterly conference that came off a few days after our arrival changed my traveling companion and I was coupled with Ova Trumen. Joseph Wood and his fellow laborer went to Philadelphia, and I with my new companion was sent to the southern part of the State of Ohio, to return in three months to the next quarterly conference. Were not very successful and baptized only two persons. After this conference, I was permitted to return home and preach among the branches until winter when we had a call from the Prophet Joseph by his brother, Hyrum, to get ready and go with the company of elders to the state of Missouri, known as \"Zion's Camp.\" Our first daughter and first child was born November 15, 1833. During the winter of 1833 and spring of 1834, we were instructed to labor and get all the money we could, to get good rifles and make ready to start by the first of May, 1834. These were from the Florence branch: Nelson Higgins, Hyrum Blackran, Asey Fields, and Milo Andrus. My brother-in-law, James Daley, went with us as far as Mansfield, Richard County, Ohio, where we met with the Prophet Joseph, his brother, Hyrum, and the rest of the camp from the East. Our leader was Elder Orson Hyde.\n\nThere was one circumstance that occurred before we joined the main camp worthy of notice. As stated before, I had bought my time from my father, and had paid him the amount agreed upon, but still I was not twenty-one by ten months. On this account and as he was opposed to my going with the Mormons, he made an effort to stop me. As we had to pass his house on our way, we learned his intention to stop me at the county seat, Norwalk. Brother Hyde had learned of his plan, went in and made inquiry about a road that we did not intend to travel, and then Brother Nelson Higgins and myself were directed to go around the city and take the road to Mansfield and the sheriff thinking that we would move slowly did not want to overtake us until we had camped. Accordingly, the father, sheriff, and driver drank freely and when they started they took the road to Tiffin, which had been inquired after to mislead them. They drove until long after dark, the team becoming tired they gave up the chase and heard of us the next morning forty miles on the road to Mansfield, and they felt as though they had been badly sold and gave up and went home.\n\nOn the 11th of May, we joined the main camp west of Mansfield, and on the 12th the camp was organized and the law of consecration was for the first time presented and we shelled out to the last cent. Our money went into a commissary's hands and our supplies were bought by him. I shall not try to name the particulars of this journey. We journeyed on causing considerable excitement and receiving much good instruction from the Prophet Joseph. After we got into the state of Missouri, or rather before our company had crossed the Mississippi River, we went into the dense forest as a company and there offered up to the Lord our fervent prayers, that He would spare our lives, and permit us to return to our families. We felt that it would be so, and thanks be to the Lord, not one of us was taken by the cholera that visited the camp that afternoon.\n\nTwo weeks later we landed on Fishing River, in Clay County, Missouri. This is where the Revelation that is recorded on page 345 in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants was given on June 22, 1834. About this time cholera made its appearance among us, as it had been predicted by the Prophet. Thirteen of our good brethren were taken away by the dread monster. The group broke up partly, and the Saints scattered around and the Lord turned away the scourge. After staying there for three weeks, the Lord permitted us to return. We got back to our families the last of September 1834, careworn and much fatigued. I had the cholera on the way home but the Lord healed me, and then we went on our way rejoicing.\n\nIn the summer of 1835, I traveled in the State of New York with Nathan Baldwin, baptized several, and the following winter went to the dedication of the Temple and the endowment of the elders that the Lord had promised as a reward for their offerings. The blessings of the Lord were poured out abundantly. There is one thing that I would here relate, to that was a great joy to me. That was when the Holy Ghost was poured out on the elders, I saw fire descend and rest on the heads of the elders, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\n\nOn our return to Kirtland from the mission in the East, I went to school in Kirtland, studied grammar, and then studied Hebrew under Professor __ of New York. On going back to Florence, Ohio, I was chosen President of the Florence branch with instructions to move them to Missouri in the fall of 1836. We went as far as Terre Haute, Indiana when being late and cold, we came near losing the human appearance, but the hand of the Lord was in it. We raised up a branch of the Church in that place. Early in the spring of 1837, we started for Missouri and arrived in Caldwell County in time to put in a crop. In 1838 we were mobbed out of the country. We had one child born in Missouri, a girl, namely, Sarah Ann. We went to Illinois in the winter of 1838 and the next summer we lost our little girl, born in Missouri.\n\nIn the fall, after I had the chills and fever for two months, I could scarcely walk, I was sent on a mission to Canada, but owing to the Patriot War we were not permitted to go to Canada and I spent the winter preaching in the State of Ohio-returned home in the spring of 1840, and spent my time laboring and preaching in the counties of Nauvoo until the spring of 1844, I was then sent to the state of Ohio with Elder John Loveless. We traveled in the southern part of Ohio for two months, when we heard of the assassination of the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum. We went home as quickly as steam would take us and arrived in time to see their mortal remains before they were interred. I then went to Carthage Jail, where they were murdered, and saw the floor stained with the best blood of the present generation. The people were all fleeing for fear of injustice overtaking them. I called at the Hamilton Hotel to see Elder John Taylor who was wounded in the jail. Then went to Adams County where my family had fled for safety. I found them well but much alarmed. After we had mourned the loss of our Prophet and Patriarch for a few weeks, during which time I was chosen as one of the Nauvoo Police, I helped to watch the city by night and worked on the Temple by daylight, got it so the work of the endowments commenced in the fall of 1845 and winter of 1846. I spent six weeks of the time in the Temple and was much blest.\n\nDuring the past four years, we had two more children born: namely, John D. and Millennium. After the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I was ordained one of the Presidents of the 10th Quorum of Seventy. In the winter of 1846, the basement of my house was made into a wagon shop and in the spring of the same year we started on our journey to the West. We overtook the main camp at Pisgah, and from there went to Council Bluffs, where the government called on us for a battalion of 500 men to go to Mexico. After the battalion was started I was sent forward with others to the number of one hundred and fifty wagons, went as far as the Pawnee Indian Village, then went 150 miles to the northwest among the Ponca Indians and farmed in that county in the year 1847, and in the spring of 1848, at this time I was sent on a mission to England. Shortly before I left, Sarah Ann Miles was sealed to me, and she accompanied me to England. We arrived in Liverpool on the 1st of August, and on the 13th of August at a General Conference, I was appointed President of the Liverpool Conference, which place I filled to the best of my ability until January, 1850, when I was released to come home.\n\nDuring my stay in that conference, there were three new branches added, and between two and three hundred were added to the Church by baptism. I baptized thirty in one evening. The Lord made manifest His power in healing the sick and in blessing the Church with signs following the believers. Milo, Junior, was born in Liverpool, on September 30, 1848. We left Liverpool in January 1850, on board the ship, Argo. Jeter Clinton presided over the company. We were eight weeks and three days on the ship from Liverpool to New Orleans, and some sickness and two deaths occurred on the passage. I was sick with cholera, my wife had poor health all the way, Milo, Jr. was sick, and we thought he would die. However, the blessings of the Lord brought us through. We came up the Mississippi River on board the steamer, Uncle Sam, Captain VanSosen, master. We landed at Kanesville early in May, and was organized in the first company of Saints early in June. I was chosen captain over fifty-five wagons. We had a good time on the plains, and arrived in Salt Lake City on the last day of August, having but one death on the journey that of a stranger going to California. I baptized 15 persons on the journey. James Leithead and Richard Hopkins were elders and clerks of the company. A more full account of the mission to England is recorded in the 10th Quorum of Seventy records.\n\nAfter one week's rest, I went to work in the 19th Ward and built myself a house, and about the 1st of January 1851, my wife Jane, and I parted. In June 1851, I married the Widow Turtle, and the November following my wife, Sarah Ann Miles, died. I married Adaline Alexander in March 1852. In December 1852, I married Mary Ann Webster. In the spring of 1854, I was sent to Saint Louis to preside over the Stake there as the first president. Stayed there for one year, rebaptized, and confirmed about 800 Saints. Was sent up the river to buy cattle for the emigration of 1855, and in the fall was appointed by E. Snow and D. Spencer to bring the last company of 63 wagons home. Married Elizabeth and Ann Brooks and Jane Mundy in December 1855. Married Margaret Boyce in February 1857, and in February 1858 was married to Emma Covert.\n\nWas acting bishop of Big Cottonwood Ward in 1858 and in the fall of 1859 I was appointed to another mission to England. For the last nine months, I presided over the Birmingham District, embracing Birmingham, Warwickshire, and Staffordshire Conferences. In the summer of 1861, I started for home with 700 Saints on board the ship, Underwriter. I was appointed president of the company, and we had a good passage to New York, no deaths. I was then appointed to take charge of 900 to Florence, Nebraska, on the cars. Stayed at Florence for five weeks, and was then appointed a captain to take a company of 66 wagons across the plains and arrived in Salt Lake City in September 1861. In the fall of 1870, I was again sent to the States on a mission. Came back in the spring of 1871. Since that time, I have been in Utah on the home missionary list and working with my hands for a living. At this date, January 9, 1875, I am living in St. George, Utah. End of quote.\n\n1873. After his return from his mission to England, he located on Dry Creek and was again appointed to labor as a home missionary. In 1870 he filled a short mission to the States. In the winter of 1873, he went to St. George, southern Utah and the following year he moved a part of his family to St. George, where he later tried to work in the United Order. In 1874, he was appointed a member of the High Council in the St. George Stake and held that position until 1881, when he was called to take charge of a mission to Green River in Emery County. This mission, however, did not succeed, and he returned to Salt Lake City.\n\nIn the fall of 1882, he was appointed chaplain of the council of the Utah Legislature. In 1883, he moved to Cache Valley and located in Oxford in 1884. When the Oneida Stake of Zion was organized in 1884, he was chosen as a member of the High Council of that Stake and also appointed to preside over the High Priests' quorum. He was ordained a Patriarch in 1884. Ripe in years and faithful and true to his Church to the last, Patriarch Andrus died at Oxford, Oneida County, Idaho, on June 18, 1893, leaving a large posterity.\n\nMilo Andrus was universally known among the Saints as an eloquent expounder of the Gospel; he possessed the gift of speech to a marvelous extent and exercised influence for good wherever he associated with other men. He was one of the most successful missionaries known in the Church. His early missionary activities are summed up in the following: Southern Ohio (1833), five months; Zion's Camp (1834), six months; Temple worker at Kirtland (1834), six months; State of New York (1835), five months; Canada (1841), six months; Ohio (1844), seven months; Nauvoo Temple (1845), eight months; Great Britain (1848), two years; St. Louis, Mo. (1854), nine months; Salmon River, Idaho (1856), two months; Great Britain (1859), two years; Ohio, (1869), five months.\n\nAccording to Millard, the oldest child of Milo and Jane Munday Andrus, his father subcontracted from Brigham Young to build part of a roadbed for the Union Pacific Railroad through Echo Canyon. His older sons undertook and completed many such contracts, including the one in Echo Canyon.\n\nFrom the family records, we are told that Milo Andrus acquired land in the various places he made homes for his family, including southern Utah and Oxford, Idaho. Although he was called to labor as a missionary for his Church, he retained a deep interest in his family and helped to provide for them.\n\nMilo Andrus, First President of St. Louis Stake\n\nThe early spring months of 1854 were spent by Milo Andrus in traveling from Salt Lake City to St. Louis. He probably arrived several weeks ahead of Erastus Snow, who was sent to St. Louis to organize the Stake, and on September 12, 1854, he wrote:\n\nBrother Andrus has succeeded well in his labors here and on my arrival he was stirring up the Saints to renew their covenants in baptism and nearly all have done so since my arrival and with them many who had never been baptized. The Lord is shedding forth His spirit upon the people [p.239] and many say they never saw such a good spirit among the Saints in St. Louis before. After this month we shall leave Concert Hall and occupy the Old Baptist Church on 4th Street, a spacious building with a gallery, which will be under our entire control, including a basement with three rooms, suitable for councils, storage, or a rendezvous for our emigration.…\n\nMuch of the available information as to Milo's activities in 1854–1855 is to be found in The St. Louis Luminary. This little newspaper was published weekly, starting Nov. 22, 1854, with its final issue on Dec. 15, 1855.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1854, Milo performed two marriages for immigrants from England (Henry Rampton to Frances Dinwoodey and John Evans Jr. to Mary Ellison). He also delivered an introductory speech to what was called, \"The Latter-day Saints' Tea Party,\" held in the Fourth Street Church in St. Louis on Dec. 25, 1854. The Luminary records it as follows:\n\nPursuant to announcements the Latter Day Saints met as above to enjoy a Christmas day ... at half past two o'clock p.m. The meeting was opened by the Choir ... after which President Milo Andrus arose and spoke as follows: \"I wish to make a few introductory remarks to the proceedings of this day. I commence by wishing my brethren and sisters and my associate friends a happy and merry Christmas, and I prophesy back of that ... for I am a prophet enough to do that ... if you will observe the rules of order, your joy and happiness will be complete and you shall have one of the choicest Christmas gifts that can be bestowed upon mortals—a gift above that which man can give. It is the gift of the Holy Spirit. A greater portion of this spirit is held in reserve for the people when they know more about what they are about and learn better the results of their doings. To us there is no difference as far as names are concerned ... I wish you to feel happy and cheerful today which is the very opposite spirit to that which reigns in the religious and fashionable world, which is a spirit of restraint, bondage, and misery. To meet in their several societies would to me be a perfect Hell. I want everything to be done here in a spirit of freedom and good feeling. The music and singing and all that is done, tend to rejoice the heart and animate the spirit and happily every person in this assembly. If there is anything contrary or opposed to this, I hope it will be overruled, restrained, and banished so that the Spirit of Peace may reign uninterruptedly among us. Amen.\n\nIn the Dec. 23, 1854 edition of the Luminary a letter by Milo Andrus reports his visits to the Dry Hill and the Centerville, Illinois branches. He preached several sermons and performed several baptisms. In the same edition of the Luminary, a message titled \"The High Council to all the Saints throughout this stake of Zion—Greetings\" is signed by Milo Andrus. Herein he outlines and discusses the duties of Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons, husbands, wives, and parents:\n\nTo Husbands: love your wives, and treat them kindly and tenderly as Christ does His Church. You are appointed to be the head of the woman; then do not resign the government into her hands but sustain with honor and dignity the position you are called to enjoy. Be not austere and tyrannical, harsh and cruel, for He who has given her unto you is her Father, and He will listen unto her complaint, and unless you repent and reform she may be taken from you and given to one more worthy of her. Do you aspire to be the savior of your wives? Then learn brethren, to save yourselves. If you would have your wives obedient to you, learn to be obedient to those men who are placed over you. If you would be honored by your wives, be temperate in your words and deeds, and prove to them by your wisdom, integrity, and righteousness, that you are worthy of their love and confidence, and your wives will feel satisfied that you are the men to lead them to Celestial Glory.\n\nTo Wives: Honor and obey your husbands as your future president on earth, and your future representative in heaven; and your husbands, if good men, will bless and honor you; but if they curse and swear and take the name of the Lord in vain and give themselves to drunkenness, whoredoms, and otherwise defile themselves, then love them as you would a viper and honor them as you would the devil.\n\nTo parents: The Lord has given to your care an important charge. Your children are a heritage and gift of God, and if you train them up in the fear of the Lord they shall be the crown of your rejoicing and glory in the Kingdom of our God. Be careful that you set a proper example before them. If you curse and swear your children will be likely to do the same; if you mingle with the vulgar, the drinker, and the profane, your children will do so likewise; if you neglect your duties as a Saint of God, and rebel against the authority He has placed over you, your children will most probably drink into the same accursed spirit; and remember that for all these things God will bring thee unto judgment.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Council\n\nMilo Andrus, President.\n\n____\n\nMILO ANDRUS HOME Built: 1858 Original location: Crescent, Utah Relocated: 1980 This large frame house was built in 1858 under the supervision of Milo Andrus' wife, Lucy. It was built 12 miles south of the center of Salt Lake City (present-day Crescent, Utah). The home was used as an inn, and Lucy took in boarders and helped prepare meals for weary travelers. The house was home for the family as well. The 160-acre farm provided grain, vegetables, and fruit to household members. The Andrus home is interpreted as a general store and family home. It was characteristic of the frontier merchant of the mid-1850s-1860s to have his store and home in the same building. Merchandise representative of pioneer times were fabric, clothing items, household goods, and kitchen utensils stocked on the shelves of the general store. In 1978, Z.C.M.I. purchased the property and donated the building to Pioneer Trails State Park where it was relocated and restored in 1980.\n\nThe Official Site of the Milo Andrus Family Organization\n\n∼Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel, 1847–1868\n\nCompany: Milo Andrus Company (1850)\n\nNarrative: In early 1850, Church leaders advised emigrants that pioneer companies would travel on a new route on the south side of the Platte River. By taking this new route they avoided some river crossings on the north side that had proved dangerous because of high water in the previous year. They also expected to receive additional military protection on a new army supply road. This was a factor in their decision because they wanted to avoid conflict with the Plains Indians, who had been agitated during the 1849 California gold rush. The 200-mile long army road connected \"Old Fort Kearny,\" located 50 miles below Kanesville on the Missouri River, to \"New Fort Kearny\" following the south side of the Platte River to the west.\n\nThe first company to depart from Kanesville was led by Milo Andrus. The company, composed of 206 people and about 55 heavily loaded wagons, traveled 18 miles south on the east bank of the Missouri River to the Bethlehem Ferry (across the river from present-day Plattsmouth, Nebraska). There they crossed the Missouri River and spent a few days organizing the company. On June 3 they left their camp on the west side of the ferry and followed the Plattsmouth-Fort Kearny trail south. After crossing Weeping Water Creek they forged a new trail west where they connected with the northward-arching new military road, which became known as the Ox-Bow Trail.\n\nWhen they reached Salt Creek (near present-day Ashland, Nebraska), they found that high waters had washed out the bridge so they spent a few days building a raft on which they crossed with their wagons. At Salt Creek his place they also had a small outbreak of measles.\n\nThe Andrus Company was the only 1850 Mormon company to take the original route of the military road that crossed the drainage now known as Wahoo Creek. Later Mormon companies in 1850 took a cutoff trail (near present-day David City and Bellwood, Nebraska) that saved them 12 miles. The Andrus Company passed a large Indian village at Linwood, Nebraska, and reached the Platte at Skull Creek (near present-day Morse Bluff, Nebraska). At this point, they followed the south bank of the Platte River a hundred miles west past Grand Island where they joined with the Oregon Trail coming north from Missouri. They then continued 15 more miles to \"New Fort Kearny\", which they reached on June 23, although the army reserved grazing rights and companies weren't permitted to camp within a mile of the fort. Continuing up the south side, they reached the Lower Crossing of the South Platte (in the vicinity of the present-day town of Hershey, Nebraska), where they began crossing over to the north side.\n\nThe Andrus company was the only Mormon company to ford here in 1850. On July 4, they succeeded in crossing the last of their wagons and traveled from there to Fort Laramie on the north side. On this side of the river, they found that the grass was sparse. 1850 was a big year for overland travel as about 50,000 people bound for Oregon and the California gold fields started before the Mormon companies. They overgrazed the plains grasses, particularly on the north side of the Platte River. Cholera was epidemic among the companies bound for California and Oregon, and many graves lined the road. However, Andrus's company was spared and there was only one death in the company--a gold digger bound for California. They were fortunate too when a young girl survived a serious head injury after being run over by a wagon.\n\nAt the fifth crossing of the Sweetwater, they met four men who were sent out by Brigham Young to locate better routes and help guide the companies to the Salt Lake Valley. Elijah Ward stayed with the company and guided them on some selected new routes. Their first departure from the established road bypassed the Rocky Ridges by veering to the north through a draw. It reportedly had an abundance of feed and water, but the ground was rough and it was only a mile shorter than the ridge road, which it rejoined just east of Rock Creek. The second departure took them on a straight course leading from a point three miles below Pacific Springs. Ward was supposed to guide them 10 miles to rejoin the old road where it crossed the Big Sandy. Unfortunately, he deviated from the planned new route and the company had to travel an additional 20 miles without water. Generally, they enjoyed good weather except for a severe snowstorm at Green River on August 17. When the wagon train exited Emigration Canyon and arrived in Salt Lake City on August 30, Andrus sported festive banners on either side of his wagon that read \"Holiness to the Lord\" and \"Hail to the Governor of Deseret.\"\n\nSon of Ruluf Andrus and Azuba Smith\n\nMarried Sarah Ann Miles, 1 Jan 1848, Winter Quarters (now Florence), Douglas, Nebraska\n\nMarried Abigail Jane Daley, 14 Feb 1833, Florence, Huron (now Erie), Ohio\n\nMarried Lucy Loomis, 1 Jun 1851, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Adaline Alexander, 27 Mar 1852, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Mary Ann Webster, 23 Dec 1852, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Jane Lancaster Munday, 22 Nov 1855, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Elizabeth Brooks, 22 Nov 1855, Salt Lake, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Ann Brooks, 22 Nov 1855, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Margaret Ann Boyce, 15 Feb 1857, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nMarried Mary Emma Covert, 28 Feb 1858, Salt Lake City, Salt Sake, Utah\n\nMarried Francenia Lucy Tuttle, 6 Dec 1862, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah\n\nObituary - excerpt from Deseret Evening News, 21 June 1893, p.1\n\nMilo Andrus - \"His death, which occurred at Oxford, Idaho on June 19, 1893, was attributed to old age and general debility, he having reached the advanced age of 79 years, 3 months, 13 days.

His posterity numbers 59 children, 170 grandchildren, and 75 great-grandchildren.\"\n\nMilo Andrus Tells His Story - Our Pioneer Heritage, Vol. 14, p. 232-240\n\nMy father is a native of Hartford, Connecticut, and my mother of Rutland, Vermont. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Essex County, State of New York, where they resided until their ninth child was born, seven boys and three girls; namely, Oran, Almon, Carlo, Erasmus, Harwin, Milo, and Milo 2nd. Erasmus, Harwin, and Milo died in childhood, the dates of their deaths I cannot give in consequence of a fire that burnt up the records of my father's family. The names of my sisters were Sybil, Sarah, and Emily. My eldest brother, Oran, was born in 1797; Sybil was born in 1799; Almon was born in 1801; the dates of the others I cannot give.\n\nI, Milo 2nd, was born March 6th, 1814. When five years old, my parents moved to Dunkirk, State of New York, where they resided for one and a half years. During that time there was a circumstance occurred that seems to me to show the protecting hand of the Lord over us. I went to the shore of Lake Erie and got into a skiff on the lake, and went to sleep. When the wind arose and took the skiff onto the lake, it was not until nearly out of sight that I was picked up still sound asleep. I have always thought that the Angel of Peace then watched over me.\n\nMy parents then moved up the lake into the State of Ohio, in Huron County township of Henrietta, where they had three daughters: namely, Evaline Charlotte, born October 7, 1817; Lucina, born 1819; and Harriet, born 1821. At this writing the two eldest of my brothers are still alive and three of my youngest sisters. They have all rejected the gospel. My mother died on January 1, 1830. My father died in the winter of 1848. I shall now drop the history of the balance of the family and give a few incidents of my own history. After my mother's death, I bought the balance of my time until I was twenty-one of my father, for which I paid him one hundred and fifty dollars. In the spring of 1832, I met an elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints though I should say, previously to this time I had my mind exercised about a future state, and had read the views of Alexander Campbell, and that being the nearest to the truth of the New Testament, I had been baptized by Elder Orson Hyde, then a minister of that sect. When I compared the scriptures with the teachings of the elder of the Church of Christ, I found that he had the truth and after nearly one year, yielded to baptism.\n\nOne month and nine days previous to my baptism, I was united in marriage to Abigail Jane Daley, whose father had been baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about one year before. We were married on February 21, 1833. I was ordained an elder on May 5, 1833, under the hands of Joseph Wood. Started on my first mission in June 1833, in company with Joseph Wood, and traveled a distance of seventy miles preaching every day. We came to Kirtland where the Prophet Joseph Smith resided with his family.\n\nThe quarterly conference that came off a few days after our arrival changed my traveling companion and I was coupled with Ova Trumen. Joseph Wood and his fellow laborer went to Philadelphia, and I with my new companion was sent to the southern part of the State of Ohio, to return in three months to the next quarterly conference. Were not very successful and baptized only two persons. After this conference, I was permitted to return home and preach among the branches until winter when we had a call from the Prophet Joseph by his brother, Hyrum, to get ready and go with the company of elders to the state of Missouri, known as \"Zion's Camp.\" Our first daughter and first child was born November 15, 1833. During the winter of 1833 and spring of 1834, we were instructed to labor and get all the money we could, to get good rifles and make ready to start by the first of May, 1834. These were from the Florence branch: Nelson Higgins, Hyrum Blackran, Asey Fields, and Milo Andrus. My brother-in-law, James Daley, went with us as far as Mansfield, Richard County, Ohio, where we met with the Prophet Joseph, his brother, Hyrum, and the rest of the camp from the East. Our leader was Elder Orson Hyde.\n\nThere was one circumstance that occurred before we joined the main camp worthy of notice. As stated before, I had bought my time from my father, and had paid him the amount agreed upon, but still I was not twenty-one by ten months. On this account and as he was opposed to my going with the Mormons, he made an effort to stop me. As we had to pass his house on our way, we learned his intention to stop me at the county seat, Norwalk. Brother Hyde had learned of his plan, went in and made inquiry about a road that we did not intend to travel, and then Brother Nelson Higgins and myself were directed to go around the city and take the road to Mansfield and the sheriff thinking that we would move slowly did not want to overtake us until we had camped. Accordingly, the father, sheriff, and driver drank freely and when they started they took the road to Tiffin, which had been inquired after to mislead them. They drove until long after dark, the team becoming tired they gave up the chase and heard of us the next morning forty miles on the road to Mansfield, and they felt as though they had been badly sold and gave up and went home.\n\nOn the 11th of May, we joined the main camp west of Mansfield, and on the 12th the camp was organized and the law of consecration was for the first time presented and we shelled out to the last cent. Our money went into a commissary's hands and our supplies were bought by him. I shall not try to name the particulars of this journey. We journeyed on causing considerable excitement and receiving much good instruction from the Prophet Joseph. After we got into the state of Missouri, or rather before our company had crossed the Mississippi River, we went into the dense forest as a company and there offered up to the Lord our fervent prayers, that He would spare our lives, and permit us to return to our families. We felt that it would be so, and thanks be to the Lord, not one of us was taken by the cholera that visited the camp that afternoon.\n\nTwo weeks later we landed on Fishing River, in Clay County, Missouri. This is where the Revelation that is recorded on page 345 in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants was given on June 22, 1834. About this time cholera made its appearance among us, as it had been predicted by the Prophet. Thirteen of our good brethren were taken away by the dread monster. The group broke up partly, and the Saints scattered around and the Lord turned away the scourge. After staying there for three weeks, the Lord permitted us to return. We got back to our families the last of September 1834, careworn and much fatigued. I had the cholera on the way home but the Lord healed me, and then we went on our way rejoicing.\n\nIn the summer of 1835, I traveled in the State of New York with Nathan Baldwin, baptized several, and the following winter went to the dedication of the Temple and the endowment of the elders that the Lord had promised as a reward for their offerings. The blessings of the Lord were poured out abundantly. There is one thing that I would here relate, to that was a great joy to me. That was when the Holy Ghost was poured out on the elders, I saw fire descend and rest on the heads of the elders, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\n\nOn our return to Kirtland from the mission in the East, I went to school in Kirtland, studied grammar, and then studied Hebrew under Professor __ of New York. On going back to Florence, Ohio, I was chosen President of the Florence branch with instructions to move them to Missouri in the fall of 1836. We went as far as Terre Haute, Indiana when being late and cold, we came near losing the human appearance, but the hand of the Lord was in it. We raised up a branch of the Church in that place. Early in the spring of 1837, we started for Missouri and arrived in Caldwell County in time to put in a crop. In 1838 we were mobbed out of the country. We had one child born in Missouri, a girl, namely, Sarah Ann. We went to Illinois in the winter of 1838 and the next summer we lost our little girl, born in Missouri.\n\nIn the fall, after I had the chills and fever for two months, I could scarcely walk, I was sent on a mission to Canada, but owing to the Patriot War we were not permitted to go to Canada and I spent the winter preaching in the State of Ohio-returned home in the spring of 1840, and spent my time laboring and preaching in the counties of Nauvoo until the spring of 1844, I was then sent to the state of Ohio with Elder John Loveless. We traveled in the southern part of Ohio for two months, when we heard of the assassination of the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum. We went home as quickly as steam would take us and arrived in time to see their mortal remains before they were interred. I then went to Carthage Jail, where they were murdered, and saw the floor stained with the best blood of the present generation. The people were all fleeing for fear of injustice overtaking them. I called at the Hamilton Hotel to see Elder John Taylor who was wounded in the jail. Then went to Adams County where my family had fled for safety. I found them well but much alarmed. After we had mourned the loss of our Prophet and Patriarch for a few weeks, during which time I was chosen as one of the Nauvoo Police, I helped to watch the city by night and worked on the Temple by daylight, got it so the work of the endowments commenced in the fall of 1845 and winter of 1846. I spent six weeks of the time in the Temple and was much blest.\n\nDuring the past four years, we had two more children born: namely, John D. and Millennium. After the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I was ordained one of the Presidents of the 10th Quorum of Seventy. In the winter of 1846, the basement of my house was made into a wagon shop and in the spring of the same year we started on our journey to the West. We overtook the main camp at Pisgah, and from there went to Council Bluffs, where the government called on us for a battalion of 500 men to go to Mexico. After the battalion was started I was sent forward with others to the number of one hundred and fifty wagons, went as far as the Pawnee Indian Village, then went 150 miles to the northwest among the Ponca Indians and farmed in that county in the year 1847, and in the spring of 1848, at this time I was sent on a mission to England. Shortly before I left, Sarah Ann Miles was sealed to me, and she accompanied me to England. We arrived in Liverpool on the 1st of August, and on the 13th of August at a General Conference, I was appointed President of the Liverpool Conference, which place I filled to the best of my ability until January, 1850, when I was released to come home.\n\nDuring my stay in that conference, there were three new branches added, and between two and three hundred were added to the Church by baptism. I baptized thirty in one evening. The Lord made manifest His power in healing the sick and in blessing the Church with signs following the believers. Milo, Junior, was born in Liverpool, on September 30, 1848. We left Liverpool in January 1850, on board the ship, Argo. Jeter Clinton presided over the company. We were eight weeks and three days on the ship from Liverpool to New Orleans, and some sickness and two deaths occurred on the passage. I was sick with cholera, my wife had poor health all the way, Milo, Jr. was sick, and we thought he would die. However, the blessings of the Lord brought us through. We came up the Mississippi River on board the steamer, Uncle Sam, Captain VanSosen, master. We landed at Kanesville early in May, and was organized in the first company of Saints early in June. I was chosen captain over fifty-five wagons. We had a good time on the plains, and arrived in Salt Lake City on the last day of August, having but one death on the journey that of a stranger going to California. I baptized 15 persons on the journey. James Leithead and Richard Hopkins were elders and clerks of the company. A more full account of the mission to England is recorded in the 10th Quorum of Seventy records.\n\nAfter one week's rest, I went to work in the 19th Ward and built myself a house, and about the 1st of January 1851, my wife Jane, and I parted. In June 1851, I married the Widow Turtle, and the November following my wife, Sarah Ann Miles, died. I married Adaline Alexander in March 1852. In December 1852, I married Mary Ann Webster. In the spring of 1854, I was sent to Saint Louis to preside over the Stake there as the first president. Stayed there for one year, rebaptized, and confirmed about 800 Saints. Was sent up the river to buy cattle for the emigration of 1855, and in the fall was appointed by E. Snow and D. Spencer to bring the last company of 63 wagons home. Married Elizabeth and Ann Brooks and Jane Mundy in December 1855. Married Margaret Boyce in February 1857, and in February 1858 was married to Emma Covert.\n\nWas acting bishop of Big Cottonwood Ward in 1858 and in the fall of 1859 I was appointed to another mission to England. For the last nine months, I presided over the Birmingham District, embracing Birmingham, Warwickshire, and Staffordshire Conferences. In the summer of 1861, I started for home with 700 Saints on board the ship, Underwriter. I was appointed president of the company, and we had a good passage to New York, no deaths. I was then appointed to take charge of 900 to Florence, Nebraska, on the cars. Stayed at Florence for five weeks, and was then appointed a captain to take a company of 66 wagons across the plains and arrived in Salt Lake City in September 1861. In the fall of 1870, I was again sent to the States on a mission. Came back in the spring of 1871. Since that time, I have been in Utah on the home missionary list and working with my hands for a living. At this date, January 9, 1875, I am living in St. George, Utah. End of quote.\n\n1873. After his return from his mission to England, he located on Dry Creek and was again appointed to labor as a home missionary. In 1870 he filled a short mission to the States. In the winter of 1873, he went to St. George, southern Utah and the following year he moved a part of his family to St. George, where he later tried to work in the United Order. In 1874, he was appointed a member of the High Council in the St. George Stake and held that position until 1881, when he was called to take charge of a mission to Green River in Emery County. This mission, however, did not succeed, and he returned to Salt Lake City.\n\nIn the fall of 1882, he was appointed chaplain of the council of the Utah Legislature. In 1883, he moved to Cache Valley and located in Oxford in 1884. When the Oneida Stake of Zion was organized in 1884, he was chosen as a member of the High Council of that Stake and also appointed to preside over the High Priests' quorum. He was ordained a Patriarch in 1884. Ripe in years and faithful and true to his Church to the last, Patriarch Andrus died at Oxford, Oneida County, Idaho, on June 18, 1893, leaving a large posterity.\n\nMilo Andrus was universally known among the Saints as an eloquent expounder of the Gospel; he possessed the gift of speech to a marvelous extent and exercised influence for good wherever he associated with other men. He was one of the most successful missionaries known in the Church. His early missionary activities are summed up in the following: Southern Ohio (1833), five months; Zion's Camp (1834), six months; Temple worker at Kirtland (1834), six months; State of New York (1835), five months; Canada (1841), six months; Ohio (1844), seven months; Nauvoo Temple (1845), eight months; Great Britain (1848), two years; St. Louis, Mo. (1854), nine months; Salmon River, Idaho (1856), two months; Great Britain (1859), two years; Ohio, (1869), five months.\n\nAccording to Millard, the oldest child of Milo and Jane Munday Andrus, his father subcontracted from Brigham Young to build part of a roadbed for the Union Pacific Railroad through Echo Canyon. His older sons undertook and completed many such contracts, including the one in Echo Canyon.\n\nFrom the family records, we are told that Milo Andrus acquired land in the various places he made homes for his family, including southern Utah and Oxford, Idaho. Although he was called to labor as a missionary for his Church, he retained a deep interest in his family and helped to provide for them.\n\nMilo Andrus, First President of St. Louis Stake\n\nThe early spring months of 1854 were spent by Milo Andrus in traveling from Salt Lake City to St. Louis. He probably arrived several weeks ahead of Erastus Snow, who was sent to St. Louis to organize the Stake, and on September 12, 1854, he wrote:\n\nBrother Andrus has succeeded well in his labors here and on my arrival he was stirring up the Saints to renew their covenants in baptism and nearly all have done so since my arrival and with them many who had never been baptized. The Lord is shedding forth His spirit upon the people [p.239] and many say they never saw such a good spirit among the Saints in St. Louis before. After this month we shall leave Concert Hall and occupy the Old Baptist Church on 4th Street, a spacious building with a gallery, which will be under our entire control, including a basement with three rooms, suitable for councils, storage, or a rendezvous for our emigration.…\n\nMuch of the available information as to Milo's activities in 1854–1855 is to be found in The St. Louis Luminary. This little newspaper was published weekly, starting Nov. 22, 1854, with its final issue on Dec. 15, 1855.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1854, Milo performed two marriages for immigrants from England (Henry Rampton to Frances Dinwoodey and John Evans Jr. to Mary Ellison). He also delivered an introductory speech to what was called, \"The Latter-day Saints' Tea Party,\" held in the Fourth Street Church in St. Louis on Dec. 25, 1854. The Luminary records it as follows:\n\nPursuant to announcements the Latter Day Saints met as above to enjoy a Christmas day ... at half past two o'clock p.m. The meeting was opened by the Choir ... after which President Milo Andrus arose and spoke as follows: \"I wish to make a few introductory remarks to the proceedings of this day. I commence by wishing my brethren and sisters and my associate friends a happy and merry Christmas, and I prophesy back of that ... for I am a prophet enough to do that ... if you will observe the rules of order, your joy and happiness will be complete and you shall have one of the choicest Christmas gifts that can be bestowed upon mortals—a gift above that which man can give. It is the gift of the Holy Spirit. A greater portion of this spirit is held in reserve for the people when they know more about what they are about and learn better the results of their doings. To us there is no difference as far as names are concerned ... I wish you to feel happy and cheerful today which is the very opposite spirit to that which reigns in the religious and fashionable world, which is a spirit of restraint, bondage, and misery. To meet in their several societies would to me be a perfect Hell. I want everything to be done here in a spirit of freedom and good feeling. The music and singing and all that is done, tend to rejoice the heart and animate the spirit and happily every person in this assembly. If there is anything contrary or opposed to this, I hope it will be overruled, restrained, and banished so that the Spirit of Peace may reign uninterruptedly among us. Amen.\n\nIn the Dec. 23, 1854 edition of the Luminary a letter by Milo Andrus reports his visits to the Dry Hill and the Centerville, Illinois branches. He preached several sermons and performed several baptisms. In the same edition of the Luminary, a message titled \"The High Council to all the Saints throughout this stake of Zion—Greetings\" is signed by Milo Andrus. Herein he outlines and discusses the duties of Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons, husbands, wives, and parents:\n\nTo Husbands: love your wives, and treat them kindly and tenderly as Christ does His Church. You are appointed to be the head of the woman; then do not resign the government into her hands but sustain with honor and dignity the position you are called to enjoy. Be not austere and tyrannical, harsh and cruel, for He who has given her unto you is her Father, and He will listen unto her complaint, and unless you repent and reform she may be taken from you and given to one more worthy of her. Do you aspire to be the savior of your wives? Then learn brethren, to save yourselves. If you would have your wives obedient to you, learn to be obedient to those men who are placed over you. If you would be honored by your wives, be temperate in your words and deeds, and prove to them by your wisdom, integrity, and righteousness, that you are worthy of their love and confidence, and your wives will feel satisfied that you are the men to lead them to Celestial Glory.\n\nTo Wives: Honor and obey your husbands as your future president on earth, and your future representative in heaven; and your husbands, if good men, will bless and honor you; but if they curse and swear and take the name of the Lord in vain and give themselves to drunkenness, whoredoms, and otherwise defile themselves, then love them as you would a viper and honor them as you would the devil.\n\nTo parents: The Lord has given to your care an important charge. Your children are a heritage and gift of God, and if you train them up in the fear of the Lord they shall be the crown of your rejoicing and glory in the Kingdom of our God. Be careful that you set a proper example before them. If you curse and swear your children will be likely to do the same; if you mingle with the vulgar, the drinker, and the profane, your children will do so likewise; if you neglect your duties as a Saint of God, and rebel against the authority He has placed over you, your children will most probably drink into the same accursed spirit; and remember that for all these things God will bring thee unto judgment.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Council\n\nMilo Andrus, President.\n\n____\n\nMILO ANDRUS HOME Built: 1858 Original location: Crescent, Utah Relocated: 1980 This large frame house was built in 1858 under the supervision of Milo Andrus' wife, Lucy. It was built 12 miles south of the center of Salt Lake City (present-day Crescent, Utah). The home was used as an inn, and Lucy took in boarders and helped prepare meals for weary travelers. The house was home for the family as well. The 160-acre farm provided grain, vegetables, and fruit to household members. The Andrus home is interpreted as a general store and family home. It was characteristic of the frontier merchant of the mid-1850s-1860s to have his store and home in the same building. Merchandise representative of pioneer times were fabric, clothing items, household goods, and kitchen utensils stocked on the shelves of the general store. In 1978, Z.C.M.I. purchased the property and donated the building to Pioneer Trails State Park where it was relocated and restored in 1980.\n\nThe Official Site of the Milo Andrus Family Organization\n\n∼Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel, 1847–1868\n\nCompany: Milo Andrus Company (1850)\n\nNarrative: In early 1850, Church leaders advised emigrants that pioneer companies would travel on a new route on the south side of the Platte River. By taking this new route they avoided some river crossings on the north side that had proved dangerous because of high water in the previous year. They also expected to receive additional military protection on a new army supply road. This was a factor in their decision because they wanted to avoid conflict with the Plains Indians, who had been agitated during the 1849 California gold rush. The 200-mile long army road connected \"Old Fort Kearny,\" located 50 miles below Kanesville on the Missouri River, to \"New Fort Kearny\" following the south side of the Platte River to the west.\n\nThe first company to depart from Kanesville was led by Milo Andrus. The company, composed of 206 people and about 55 heavily loaded wagons, traveled 18 miles south on the east bank of the Missouri River to the Bethlehem Ferry (across the river from present-day Plattsmouth, Nebraska). There they crossed the Missouri River and spent a few days organizing the company. On June 3 they left their camp on the west side of the ferry and followed the Plattsmouth-Fort Kearny trail south. After crossing Weeping Water Creek they forged a new trail west where they connected with the northward-arching new military road, which became known as the Ox-Bow Trail.\n\nWhen they reached Salt Creek (near present-day Ashland, Nebraska), they found that high waters had washed out the bridge so they spent a few days building a raft on which they crossed with their wagons. At Salt Creek his place they also had a small outbreak of measles.\n\nThe Andrus Company was the only 1850 Mormon company to take the original route of the military road that crossed the drainage now known as Wahoo Creek. Later Mormon companies in 1850 took a cutoff trail (near present-day David City and Bellwood, Nebraska) that saved them 12 miles. The Andrus Company passed a large Indian village at Linwood, Nebraska, and reached the Platte at Skull Creek (near present-day Morse Bluff, Nebraska). At this point, they followed the south bank of the Platte River a hundred miles west past Grand Island where they joined with the Oregon Trail coming north from Missouri. They then continued 15 more miles to \"New Fort Kearny\", which they reached on June 23, although the army reserved grazing rights and companies weren't permitted to camp within a mile of the fort. Continuing up the south side, they reached the Lower Crossing of the South Platte (in the vicinity of the present-day town of Hershey, Nebraska), where they began crossing over to the north side.\n\nThe Andrus company was the only Mormon company to ford here in 1850. On July 4, they succeeded in crossing the last of their wagons and traveled from there to Fort Laramie on the north side. On this side of the river, they found that the grass was sparse. 1850 was a big year for overland travel as about 50,000 people bound for Oregon and the California gold fields started before the Mormon companies. They overgrazed the plains grasses, particularly on the north side of the Platte River. Cholera was epidemic among the companies bound for California and Oregon, and many graves lined the road. However, Andrus's company was spared and there was only one death in the company--a gold digger bound for California. They were fortunate too when a young girl survived a serious head injury after being run over by a wagon.\n\nAt the fifth crossing of the Sweetwater, they met four men who were sent out by Brigham Young to locate better routes and help guide the companies to the Salt Lake Valley. Elijah Ward stayed with the company and guided them on some selected new routes. Their first departure from the established road bypassed the Rocky Ridges by veering to the north through a draw. It reportedly had an abundance of feed and water, but the ground was rough and it was only a mile shorter than the ridge road, which it rejoined just east of Rock Creek. The second departure took them on a straight course leading from a point three miles below Pacific Springs. Ward was supposed to guide them 10 miles to rejoin the old road where it crossed the Big Sandy. Unfortunately, he deviated from the planned new route and the company had to travel an additional 20 miles without water. Generally, they enjoyed good weather except for a severe snowstorm at Green River on August 17. When the wagon train exited Emigration Canyon and arrived in Salt Lake City on August 30, Andrus sported festive banners on either side of his wagon that read \"Holiness to the Lord\" and \"Hail to the Governor of Deseret.\""
