[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]\n\nShe was the daughter of Squire Loomis & Patience Root. [9][10][11]\n\nShe married Hubbard Bellows Tuttle, 16 May 1843/1844, in Westfield, Hampden, Massachusetts. [12][13][14]\n\nThe following are listed in the company that traveled overland to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847: Hubbard Tuttle (age 32), Lucy Loomis Tuttle (age 25), Henry Tuttle (age 22) and Francenia Lucy Tuttle (age 1). [15]\n\nShe married Milo Andrus 1 Jun 1851, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah Territory, United States. [16][17]\n\nBiographical sketch (excerpts) published on Find A Grave Memorial (unsourced): Lucy worked for seven years in the Cabotville Mills weaving cotton cloth. On the 16th day of May 1843, she was married to Hubbard Tuttle in Cabotville. They joined the Church in 1844. Thinking that the Saints were going to California she packed all her choice things in the way of dishes, quilts, etc., and sent them on the ship Brooklyn with Sam Brannan, but never saw them again. She remained in Winter Quarters for a time, and during her journey across the plains was sorely afflicted with black scurvy. They arrived in Salt Lake September 1847, and lived in the 9th Ward. They had ten acres of land outside the city limits. In 1849, Mr. Tuttle left Salt Lake in company with Albert Thurber, going through the southern route to California, on what is sometimes called the Gold Mission. He was taken ill with Cholera infantum, died within a short time leaving Lucy with three children, the youngest a baby boy five months old, born while he was away. She married Milo Andrus June 11, 1851, to them five children were born. The first years after her marriage to Mr. Andrus were spent in what was known as the Jordan Bottoms, and then moved to the Half Way House in Crescent, a few miles north from the Point of the Mountain. At one time, James Miller, a merchant from Spanish Fork, stopped at the hotel. In conversation with Mrs. Andrus, James told her that there was a good opportunity to establish a hotel in Spanish Fork. Heeding his advice, she, in company with her children, made the move, where she bought ground from James Anderson, a blacksmith, and built the first hotel in the town. It was located on South Main Street, and was known as the Spanish Fork House. Supper, breakfast and bed, Mrs. Andrus gave her guests for $1.00. The stabling of the animals was extra. Francenia, her daughter, helped in the hotel until she married her stepfather, Milo Andrus. Another helper in the hotel was Harriet Simmons. Lucy's oldest son, Hubbard, fell in love with Harriet and they were married. [18]\n\nShe passed away in 1890 in the Utah Territory, United States.
