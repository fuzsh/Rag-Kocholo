        "text": "George M. Ottinger (1833-1917) was born on 8 February 1833, in Springfield Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. At the age of seventeen he signed on as a sailor and spent the next three years, first, on a whaler, and then on various freighters. Back on land, he began tinting photographs which brought him into association with many artists who helped improve his technique and eye for color. On 7 June 1858 Ottinger was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ottinger and his mother set out for Salt Lake City in April 1861 and arrived in September 1861, after two months of preparation and four months of travel. He married Mary Jane McAllister Cullen on 9 January 1862, but Mary died 7 December 1862, after the birth of a son, William, in November. On 3 December 1864, Ottinger and Phoebe Nelson were married by Heber C. Kimball, and they raised a family of six children.\n\nIn partnership with C. R. Savage, a photographer, Ottinger tinted photographs at a studio in Park City, where the miners had the money to spend on them. In company with Savage, Ottinger visited England in 1879, as a church missionary, to learn more about art technique. Ottinger was actively engaged in other art pursuits in Utah. He helped found the Deseret Academy of Arts in 1863, the Deseret Art Union in 1865, and the Salt Lake (Utah) Art Association in 1881. Partly because of professional jealousy, none of these groups were particularly long-lived. He was also a professor of drawing at the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah) from 1882 to 1892. In 1877 he made a cast of Brigham Young's hand as well as a death-mask and anatomical measurements.\n\nIn 1866 Ottinger was advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Nauvoo Legion of Salt Lake, after joining, in 1862, as a high private. Under Territorial-governor West, Ottinger held the unpaid rank of Adjutant General, to help organize the Utah National Guard. Ottinger was active in the volunteer fire company, and its organization. Appointed Chief Engineer of the paid department in 1876, he proceeded to reorganize the system. On 1 March 1879 the city council appointed him Chief Engineer of the Fire Department and Superintendent of the Water Works, at a salary of $900 per year; he held this position until 1890.\n\nOttinger continued painting and teaching in Salt Lake City as well as giving occasional art lectures to church and civic groups. Ottinger did not feel his work was given the recognition it deserved, even though he won many awards and a few of his pictures were nationally exhibited. Ottinger died on 29 October 1917, at his home in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe George Martin Ottinger papers (1833-1899) contain Ottinger's journal, and other related items. In the first folder are two drafts of a brief summary of Ottinger's journal, \"Pioneer Artist of Utah.\" The second folder holds an account of an experience Ottinger had aboard ship, \"A Strange Dream and What Came of It\"; there are two copies, one neatly written but incomplete, the other apparently a rough draft. The third folder holds a photocopy of Ottinger's brother's, John Morris Ottinger, Pennsylvania Militia discharge papers, from 1863. The final part to the collection contains George M. Ottinger's journal, which is 287 pages in length, and covers the years 1833-1899. The following is a summary of Ottinger's journal:\n\nOttinger's journal begins with his early recollections of home, family, and school life, as well as his continued interest in art. Between 1850 and 1853, Ottinger was a sailor \"before-the-mast.\" Almost one third of the journal is taken up with recording his experiences on a whaler, and then on various freighters. His painting and drawing was not neglected aboard ship, although his subjects were limited and his palette more so. After leaving the sea he held a series of odd jobs until he began tinting photographs. This led him into association with artists who helped him improve his technique.\n\nOn 7 June 1858, Ottinger joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ottinger continued to tint photographs in Richmond, Virginia until April 1861, when he began preparations to move to Salt Lake City as the country began preparations for war. Ottinger and his mother traveled by train, in company with about one-thousand other Mormons, to Florence, Nebraska. He records a few instances of ridicule by the townspeople in stations where the Mormons remained overnight. The company spent a week in Florence outfitting for the trek across the plains. During the plains trip, Ottinger kept a diary in which he recorded the number of miles traveled, the hours of travel, the weather, and the camp sites for each day. He recorded only a few deaths and at least three instances of injury sustained to women in the company, caused by falling out of the wagons and being run over. Ottinger remarked on the inabilities of their Division Captain Milo Andrus, and on his intemperate \"Preaching.\"\n\nOttinger viewed the trip with the eye of an artist. He is descriptive and saw possible picture subjects everywhere, and did make sketches of landmarks like Independence Rock and Devil's Gate. Near Independence Rock, the company \"passed a battery of artillery and two companies of infantry returning to the States from Utah, this was the last or rear guard of Jonstones [sic] Army.\" Like many other Mormon pioneers, Ottinger made only fleeting reference to the Civil War. He does, however seem concerned about the articles he obtained on the trail which told about the First Battle of Bull Run. Later in the journal he wrote a lengthy description of the Battle of Spottsylvania Court House in which his brother was killed. His attitude was that of a Yankee; nowhere did he write that the war was a manifestation of God's retribution upon a wicked people.\n\nLife, as an artist, in Salt Lake City was not easy or economically stable. He remarked that people appreciated paintings but had no money to buy them. However, he was commissioned to paint some portraits of LDS Church leaders, including one of Brigham Young. Ottinger also made Brigham Young's death mask, cast of his hand, and anatomical measurements when Young died in 1877. During Ottinger's second year in the city, he was hired to paint the scenery at the Salt Lake Theatre. Ottinger frequently records his financial difficulties and each year, especially when visiting artists reaped financial rewards in the city, he grew more and more despairing of his talents and prospects.\n\nOttinger painted on a wide variety of subjects, from ancient America to the marine studies. Some of the paintings won him prizes or recognition. Even so, poor success with agents supposed to display and obtain a market for his pictures in the east and abroad, did nothing to encourage his confidence in his painting ability. In later years he did a series of pictures of heroic women of the United States and a group with a Japanese influence.\n\nOn arriving in Salt Lake City, Ottinger formed a partnership with C. R. Savage, a photographer, to tint Ambrotypes, which are glass photographic plates. The business prospered but the partnership was a success only intermittently. However, they did visit England in 1879 to do Church missionary work and study art. The Deseret Academy of Art was organized in 1863 with Ottinger as its president, and with other artists in the valley; the academy was not long-lived. Two other art groups, the Deseret Art Union, 1865, and the Salt Lake (Utah) Art Association, 1881, were organized, but even though some exhibitions were held, these too quickly fell apart. In 1882, Ottinger became a professor of drawing at the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah), a position he held until 1892 when he was, \"...through some under handed manner let out at the University\" (274).\n\nOttinger was married twice in Salt Lake City, first to Mary Jane McAllister Cullen, who died shortly after giving birth to a son, William, in 1862. He and his second wife, Phoebe Nelson, were married on 3 December 1864; they raised a large family, whose births are recorded in the journal. In order to support his growing family, Ottinger took on other occupations. He was a member of the volunteer fire company, and when the department was reorganized on a paid basis, Ottinger was elected Fire Chief Engineer. He was also given charge of the city water works, something which enabled him to better coordinate fire-fighting efforts.\n\nEarly in 1862, Ottinger joined the Nauvoo Legion as a high private and was quickly advanced in rank until 1866 when he obtained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1870, while active in the Legion, Ottinger was arrested and held for $5,000 bond for participation, as an officer, in a parade outlawed by the governor and termed the \"Wooden Gun Rebellion.\" Under Territorial-governor West, he was given the rank of Adjutant General and helped organize the Utah National Guard, in 1894. He resigned his position in the Guard later because it was rank without pay.\n\nThe journal ends on a pessimistic note in 1899. Ottinger was discouraged at not having his worth as a painter and civic leader recognized. He recounts an instance of character assassination against him and has little good to say about the population of Salt Lake City. However, he resolved to carry on, \"...in spite of the years of discouragement and bade luck\" (286)."
