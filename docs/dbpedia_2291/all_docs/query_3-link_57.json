Four chartered vessels sailed from Liverpool carrying two-hundred and twenty-nine converts, while only three organized companies, totalling one hundred and eighty-nine Saints, made the journey from the eastern states to the Valley. The Civil War was being agitated and rumors of an impending conflict between the North and the South added still another hazard to traveling across the plains. With the companies were missionaries, some from Europe. Canada, and the eastern states, as well as the Islands of the Sea who had been called from their various fields of labor to aid in the defense of their homes. This was the year of the Move South, and the long awaited adjustment of difficulties between the Church leaders, the citizenry of Utah, and the United States government.\n\n1859\n\nSailed Port Ship Leader People Landed Apr 11 Liverpool Wm.

The President announced that the Church would establish its business agency in Chicago, instead of St. Louis, and that perhaps another agency would be opened in Iowa. This change was done with a view of escaping dangers of fevers and epidemics generally so prevalent in the more southern latitudes.\n\nThe reopening of emigration was hailed with delight by the European Saints, but as most of them were poor only eight hundred and nine sailed for America that year. Of these fifty-four were P. E. Fund emigrants, who, together with one hundred and ninety-six others, expected to cross the plains with handcarts that season; one hundred and forty-nine were to make the overland journey with teams. The remainder intended to stop in the states temporarily, not having the means to go on to Utah; but through the kindness of fellow passengers, in better financial condition, many more were enabled to reach the valley in 1859.\n\n1860\n\nSailed Port Ship Leader People Landed Mar 30 Liverpool Underwriter James D.

But drawing their provisions, etc., is a hard task, and it would be more satisfactory if we could manage it, to bring in wagons the freight and those who are unable to walk. We now contemplate trying another plan. If we can go with our teams to the Missouri River and back in one season, and bring the poor, their provisions, etc., it will save about half the cash we now expend bringing the Saints to this point from Europe. It now costs, in cash, nearly as much as their teams, wagons, handcarts, cooking utensils, provisions, etc., for their journey across the plains as it does to transport them to the frontiers. We can raise cattle without an outlay of money and use them in transporting the Saints from the frontiers and such freight as we may require. Brethren and sisters, save your fives, tens, fifties, a hundred dollars, or as much as you can until next spring—and send your money, your cattle and wagons to the states, and buy your goods and freight with them. Twenty dollars expended in this way will do as much good as several times that amount paid to the stores here...\" In 1860 the handcart period in Utah's history was brought to a close. There were now nearly sixty thousand Saints in the valley and nearly every one had acquired a home, land, livestock and poultry.\n\n1861\n\nSailed Port Ship Leader People Landed Apr 16 Liverpool Manchester C.V.

Johnson 200 Sep 27\n\nSeveral independent companies came this year.\n\nWith the realization of an imminent conflict between the North and the South, President Brigham Young immediately made plans for bringing to Utah the many Saints who had crossed the ocean in 1861, and those who through lack of funds, were waiting in the East. The preceding spring Joseph W. Young had been sent to the Missouri River for the purpose of bringing both converts and needed supplies to the valley in the same season. The success of the Church train experiment of the previous year was pointed to as justifying the expectation that such a plan was practicable. In addition to the four yoke of cattle to the wagon, the plan also included the sending of as many loose oxen to Florence as the year's immigration that came independent of Church aid might want to purchase for their outfit; thus supplying for the people of Utah a market for their surplus cattle and a saving for the Church members from ten to thirty thousand dollars, which had hitherto been paid out yearly in cash for cattle and wagons. Moreover, the arrangement afforded the opportunity of shipping eastward such products as the community had to dispose of, mostly surplus cattle that could be driven down loose with the ox trains, and the provisions of flour and meat that could be sent for the use of the immigrants, and deposited along the line of travel, to be picked up en route when returning. Full instructions were given in the circular sent out by the presidency and nothing essential to the security and efficiency of the trains was overlooked.\n\n1862\n\nSailed Port Ship Leader People Landed Apr 9 Hamburg Humboldt H.C.

Dame 150 Oct 29\n\nIn this year's emigration of nearly six thousand men; women, and children who had accepted the teachings of the Latter-day Saint missionaries in their respective lands, were converts from the British Isles, the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and Germany. Others from the eastern states also joined the great emigration westward. The Civil War was in progress and the demand for every mode of transportation and needed supplies was continually increasing, especially in Florence, Nebraska, one of the bustling frontier towns. The arrival and departure of organized companies, under the direction of the Church, starting across the plains added to the problem. Some of the Saints were financially able to make the trip through to the valley while others were aided wholly or partially by the Perpetual Emigrating Fund. Upon their arrival in Utah the emigrants received temporary care in the homes of relatives and friends until they were settled in places of their own. Each of the incoming companies strengthened and extended the settlements within Utah's vast territory.\n\n1863\n\nSailed Port Ship Leader People Landed Apr 30 Liverpool John J. Boyd Wm. W.

The cattle in both trains were quite poor, indicating that they had seen hard times in crossing the plains.\n\nSource: Our Pioneer Heritage © Carter, Kate B., ed. 20 vols.
