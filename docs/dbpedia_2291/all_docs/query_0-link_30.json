Nier SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE 98TH NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AUGUST 17-21, 1997 ANNUAL MEMORIAL SERVICE SUNDAY, AUGUST 17, 1997 (The Memorial Service of the 98th Annual Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, held at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah, was called to order at 10:30 o'clock a.m., with Commander-in-Chief James E. Nier presiding.) CALL TO ORDER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated as I call this Memorial Service for the 98th National Convention to order. Please allow me to begin by recognizing our Gold Star parents and our Gold Star wives who are with us today. I would especially like to thank the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints for allowing us to hold our Memorial Service in the Mormon Tabernacle. A special recognition to Mr. Mr. Wendell Smoot, President of the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir, and to the Tabernacle Choir, and the Director Jerald Ottley, Associate Director Craig Jessop, and Organists, John Lonherst and Richard Elliott. As you know, the choir performed during their weekly television program just prior to our Memorial Service. Since they are so gracious to remain for our service, we have agreed to limit our service to one hour and we have made some modifications to the program. I would also like to point out that the National Memorial song of the Veterans of Foreign Wars is ``Sleep Soldier Boy Sleep.'' Composed in 1923 by a native of Salt Lake City, Dorothy Kenner Alexander, who was serving as President of Auxiliary 409 at the time. As a reminder, the Tabernacle and the Temple Square are considered sacred ground. Please refrain from smoking until leaving this area. Will everyone please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of our country and join the Tabernacle Choir in the singing of our National Anthem. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE (Whereupon, the assembly gave the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by the National Anthem. The Tabernacle Choir presented a patriotic medley at this time.) INVOCATION COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Please remain seated during the Invocation by Monsignor J. Terrence Fitzgerald. MONSIGNOR FITZGERALD: Let us pray. Loving Father, eternal guide, we praise you and we thank you for the life and the light that you share with us this day. We gather at this historic Tabernacle to seek your blessing for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, for their loved ones and that we might remember their departed comrades. You have bestowed on us such generous gifts, the freedom of our democracy, the natural resources of our country, the ingenuity and diversity of our people. For these gifts, we give you thanks. We ask that you extend your hand and blessing on all who gathered. They have defended our country so well. They have served the cause of freedom in so many distant parts. Bless them generously, reward them with your love, and bless the many departed who have sacrificed their lives in freedom's name. Father, teach us to cherish those values our deceased comrades defended: peace and justice, sacrifice and service, unity and diversity, compassion and forgiveness, generosity and love. Teach us always to cherish your divine gift of life. So we pray in your name. You are the Lord of all for ever and ever. Amen. (Whereupon, the assembly sang, ``Nearer, My God, to Thee'' under the direction of the Tabernacle Choir.) MEMORIAL RITUAL COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Comrades, Ladies of the Auxiliary and Friends: We have met at this time to commemorate our comrades of the United States Armed Forces who have answered the last call. The VFW Ritual provides that the audience refrain from applauding. The Chief of Staff will see that there is no disturbance during this ceremony. NATIONAL CHIEF OF BILL LARK: Commander-in-Chief, your order will be obeyed. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: I request that the National Chaplain preside. (National Chaplain Reverend William J. Bleiler presided during the Memorial Services performed by the National Officers in accordance with the Ritual.) (Marilyn Schultz, National Soloist of the Ladies Auxiliary, sang ``Sleep, Soldier Boy'' followed by the Tabernacle Choir presenting ``God of Abraham Praise'' and ``A Mighty Fortress''. Then the Tabernacle Choir and the assembly sang ``America, the Beautiful'' followed by the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic by the Tabernacle Choir.) NATIONAL CHAPLAIN BLEILER: We will now have our Benediction by The Right Reverend Carolyn Tanner Irish, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah. THE RIGHT REVEREND IRISH: Let us pray. Holy and Gracious God, giver of life, bearer of sacrifice, we give thanks for this opportunity to remember and to honor before you the men and women who have served this nation in uniform; those who have died and those whose faith remains unknown, those who live on bearing scars of sacrifice. We can never fully know what they experienced in their courage and in their fear, their triumph and despair, their hope and their loneliness. Yet in another sense their sacrifice makes us one with them. For no person or family or nation can endure war without being deeply wounded. War brings not only bloodshed, tears and fear, it can also distort a humanity, undermine our reverence for life, and threaten our dignity. For as long as memory endures, no war is truly over. So we pray for ourselves as well as for those who have suffered war more directly. Together with them we are one in our need for healing and reconciliation. We pray to those now in positions of responsibility and power, and we give thanks for all those throughout the world who work for justice and freedom that our children and our children's children may live in peace. In your most holy name we pray. Amen. (The VFW National Band played the Taps at this time.) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Comrades, Sisters, Ladies and Gentlemen, this concludes our Memorial Service. Thank you so very much for attending. (Whereupon, the service was concluded at 11:15 o'clock a.m.) ------ JOINT OPENING SESSION MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 1997 (The Joint Opening Session of the 98th National Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and the 84th National Convention of the Ladies Auxiliary was called to order on Monday, August 18, 1997, at 8:30 o'clock a.m., in the Salt Palace Convention Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, by Comrade Ben Russo, Chairman of the VFW 98th National Convention Committee.) CALL TO ORDER COMRADE BEN RUSSO: Comrades and sisters, I am Ben Russo, Chairman for this, the 98th VFW National Convention here in Salt Lake City. I welcome you on behalf of myself and all who are working so hard to make this our most successful Convention ever. We sincerely hope that the time you spend with us this week will renew your pride in our nation, rededicate your commitment to America's veterans and bring new excitement to your work as a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary. Please rise as we officially open this Convention with the Advancement of the Colors. ADVANCEMENT OF COLORS (Whereupon, the National Honor Guard advanced the Colors at this time followed by the Pledge of Allegiance.)

INVOCATION (Whereupon, National Chaplain Bleiler gave the Invocation.) NATIONAL SERGEANT-AT-ARMS GEORGE SARVER: Comrade Chairman, the Opening Ceremonies have been performed. VIDEO PRESENTATION COMRADE RUSSO: We will now ask you to all sit back and relax as we present the video of the ``Above and Beyond'' year. (Whereupon, the assembly enjoyed the video on the ``Above and Beyond'' year.) INTRODUCTION--THE HONORABLE DEEDEE CORRADINI COMRADE RUSSO: Now, please join me in welcoming our first guest to this 98th VFW National Convention., a lady of remarkable talents who has done so much to improve government and the quality of life here in Salt Lake City. First elected in 1991, she won re-election in 1996. Her style of government stresses good business practices, coupled with efficient management of people, money and resources. From fuel efficiency vehicles to Triple-A baseball, she is leading a community-wide renaissance that will propel Salt Lake City into the 21st Century and make it one of America's leading cities. Please give a warm VFW welcome to Her Honor, the Honorable Mayor of Salt Lake City, Deedee Corradini. (Applause) GREETINGS--THE HONORABLE DEEDEE CORRADINI MAYOR, CITY OF SALT LAKE CITY MAYOR CORRADINI: Thank you very much. The theme of our Olympic Games that will be coming here in 2002 is ``The World is Welcome Here.'' Welcome to all of you. We are thrilled to have you here. Having grown up away from Salt Lake City, it is a special privilege for me to welcome people who come here from other parts of the country for a very special reason. I was born in Rhode Island, grew up in Lebanon and Syria, lived in Massachusetts, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C. All right. All of you from all of those places clap. Now, why did I wind up in Salt Lake City? Well, I hope you are going to discover that while you are here for this Convention. When I first came here as a visitor, and I flew into this airport and saw a metropolitan area of just under one million people nestled right up against these fantastic mountains, I could not believe the physical beauty of this place. Then when I discovered the warmth and friendliness of the people here, I decided, never having been west of Chicago, that the West was a great place to live and Salt Lake City is where I wanted to settle. That is how I got here. So I hope while you are here you will enjoy all of the many things that we have to offer, that you will get up into the mountains and see our spectacular mountains. Take a ride on the tram at Snow Bird. Go up to Park City and see our Olympic preparations where we have our ski jump and our bobsled and luge runs up. There are just so many wonderful things to see, and hopefully you will have a chance to even see a little baseball while you are here. I also have a special welcome for you, because I am so proud that you have decided to have your Convention here. I have had personal experience in what veterans and the military have done for Americans and peace around the world. As a child, when I grew up in Lebanon, I was in boarding school in Beirut, Lebanon, and my parents got thrown out of Syria during the Suez crisis. I remember the Sixth Fleet constantly being on watch in the Mediterranean while I was living in Beirut and my most vivid memories is in 1958 when the Lebanese Revolution broke out. I was away from my parents who were living in Syria, and I will never forget when the Marines landed. It was in the middle of the night. The Marines escorted me out of Lebanon with the bombs blasting overhead and helped me escape. That is a sad departure, but I want you to know how proud I am and how proud you make all of us as Americans for the peace and the help you have given us around the world. Welcome to Salt Lake City. Have a wonderful Convention and God bless each and every one of you. Thank you very much. (Applause) INTRODUCTION--THE HONORABLE MICHAEL O. LEAVITT, GOVERNOR, STATE OF UTAH COMRADE RUSSO: Comrades and Sisters, again let me say that Utah attained statehood on January 4, 1896, just three years before the VFW was founded. As a state and as a veteran's organization, we have shared much in this most remarkable of all centuries. From promise to despair and back to promise, we have been what America is all about; people seeking freedom and people dedicated to preserving that freedom even if it means fighting for it. Those who settled this state came West in covered wagons. Today many of the people here play a major part in America's space exploration programs. Such success is not due to luck, instead it is the result of many years of stable, reliable, imaginative and dynamic state government; government that has consistently given new meaning to the state's one-word motto: industry. Our next guest has served the people of Utah for many years. Through his leadership, Utah carries forward the traditions on which it was built while at the same time meeting the challenges of the modern day world. Education, crime prevention and the new relationship between state and federal governments are three of the major areas in which Utah is leading the way into the new century. Just as their ancestors crossed a frontier that led to a new and promising land, those who live here today are on the threshold of a new and promising era, and the individual leading the way is Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of the great State of Utah. Please give the Governor a big warm VFW welcome. (Applause) GREETINGS--THE HONORABLE MICHAEL O. LEAVITT, GOVERNOR, STATE OF UTAH GOVERNOR LEAVITT: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Utah. Your Chairman has indicated that our motto in this state is industry. Well, we have a new motto. The new motto is, ``Utah: Highway Construction the Next Ten Miles.'' We are so pleased to have you in our state. We are a young, vibrant state. You add to that vitality. We are a state with many children, but I must confess my wife and I have added to that. We have five children. I might say we have changed the culture a little bit in the governor's mansion. We are the first family to have small children in that mansion for quite a while. Some months ago I called home and my youngest, who at the time was about four, we had a conversation that took place like this. ``Hello.'' I said, ``Weston,'' that is his name, ``is mom home?'' He said, ``She is here but she can't come to the phone.'' I said, ``Is Anna Marie there?'' That is my only daughter. He said, ``She is here, too, but she is busy.'' I said, ``What about Taylor?'' That is my second son. ``He is busy, too.'' I said, ``What are they all so busy doing?'' He said, ``Looking for me.'' (Laughter) These children really keep us going in this day. I was in the shower a couple of months ago and I get this knock on the shower door. It is my thirteen year old son. He said, ``There is some guy on the telephone from Time magazine.'' Well, at this point I had just broken into a full lather and I am in my nice, warm shower. I am a politician and you don't want to miss a chance to talk to Time magazine. I get out of the shower, wrap myself in a big towel, and by this time I am groping for the telephone with shampoo in my eyes. I say, ``This is Mike Leavitt.'' ``Mr. Leavitt, for $1.75 a week.'' (Laughter) My youngest son and I, actually the thirteen year old I just told you about, we were out at our ranch having a little holiday a year or two ago, and as I walked into the restaurant there was an old farmer who was sitting at the corner of the snack bar next to the cash register. You have been to these places before and you will see some in our state that have the vinyl booth where you can go sit and put three plays on the jukebox for a quarter and he is there sipping coffee most of the morning. I could tell when I walked in that probably he recognized me. I wasn't exactly dressed in uniform. We had our lunch and I walked up to the counter to pay. He said to me, ``Do a lot of people say you look like the Governor?'' I said, ``Quite a few people do.'' He said, ``Makes you mad, don't it?'' (Laughter) We feel a sense of deep confidence that you will be bringing us more respect than that in our state. We honor you, we honor you for what you have done. We thank you for coming to our state not just to do your business but to teach our children the value of patriotism and the value of this nation and what people like you and millions of others have done to secure it. We honor you for that. You honor us by your presence. Have a great time in the State of Utah. Thank you. (Applause) PRESENTATION OF AMERICAN FLAG SETS COMRADE RUSSO: It is my pleasure to introduce Jane Tittle, the Ladies Auxiliary National Patriotic Instructor, for the purpose of a presentation. NATIONAL PATRIOTIC INSTRUCTOR JANE TITTLE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. Governor Leavitt and Mayor Corradini, I have the pleasure of making the presentation to you this morning. Before I do, I would like to tell you a little about how the over 2.2 million veterans that this group represents feel about the gift you are about to receive. There is no coward stripe upon it and no shading is written on it. All the blood that is crimson is the blood of manhood's troop. There is no gradation in the fervor of glory anymore in its story. It is the bright flag and a right flag, and the flag from me to you. It is the flag without fetter. It is the flag of manhood better. It has never done a mean thing, never waved above its roots, greeted hate never shielded and to raw it never yielded. It is a fine flag, a divine flag that in reverence we salute. It is the flag of all the glory that is written in many stories. It is the symbol of the freedom and the hope of men oppressed. It adds no disgraceful duty, never shame that beauty. It is a pure flag and it is a sure flag, and it is our flag and it is the best. Governor Leavitt, will you join me at the podium, please. It is my high honor, on behalf of President Eileen Tanner and the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, to present to you our best, this American Flag. GOVERNOR LEAVITT: Thank you. NATIONAL PATRIOTIC INSTRUCTOR TITTLE; Mayor Corradini, will you join us at the podium, please. It is with great pleasure that I present to you on behalf of the 744,818 members of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States of America and our National President Eileen Tanner, this flag, the symbol of our nation. Long may she wave. INTRODUCTION OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER COMRADE RUSSO: James E. Nier of El Paso, Texas, was elected Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars at its 97th National Convention in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 23, 1996. Jim was the third Texas to be elected to that high office. He entered the U.S. Army in 1959 and served for 22 years. Overseas tours of duty included Vietnam, 1962-63 and Korea 1967-68. He served seven years with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Command and Control, at the Alternate National Military Command Center, Fort Ritchie, Maryland. A graduate of the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy at Fort Bliss, Texas, his last assignment was as an instructor there until his retirement in 1981. While on active duty, Jim attended night school, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in business and finance and a Master's degree in management. He joined the VFW in 1981, and he is a Life Member of VFW Post 8919 in El Paso. He has held numerous VFW offices at the Post, District, Department and National levels. He earned all- American honors as a District Commander in 1986-87, and as Department of Texas Commander in 1989-90. Following his term as VFW Commander-in-Chief, Jim Nier will return to Texas where he will continue to work for the recognition and rights of America's 26 million veterans. Comrades and sisters, please welcome our Commander-in- Chief, James Nier. (Whereupon, the assembly extended a standing ovation.) COMRADE RUSSO: At this time I would like to present you with your official name badge and the gavel for this Convention. REMARKS--COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Thank you, Ben. Thanks, ladies and gentlemen. Comrades and sisters, you are very kind. A year ago I wasn't able to stand for you and ask for your support, but I knew it was there as I assumed the duties of the Commander-in-Chief of this great organization. Today, I stand before you to thank you for that support and thank you for reaching the goals that we set at last year's Convention. Veterans are better off today than they were one year ago, and that success is due to the efforts of each and every one of you, and to include the Ladies Auxiliary. With our 100th Anniversary just two years away, I asked myself every step of the way this year, how well are we fulfilling the hopes and dreams and goals of our VFW founders? Are we as dedicated today as they were yesterday when they gave life to their dream of having a veterans organization that would serve each and every veteran in this great country? I am proud to say to you this morning that I found the answer in every veteran I met. I found it in the VA Hospitals I visited, and in particular the one that saved my life in Louisville last August. I found the answer in Posts and Districts, Departments and Conferences. I found it in the dedication and enthusiasm of old members and new members alike. I found it in widows who asked, ``Can the VFW help me?'' The answer is yes, we are fulfilling their hopes and dreams and goals, and we are honoring the dead by helping the living. Our success has never been measured in membership figures alone, instead it has been measured in what we do and how well we do it. This year has been one of milestones and records, challenges and changes. We're not rebuilding the VFW, we're making it better. From Americanism to legislative service, we are putting new life and vitality into our VFW programs. What we gained in Congress last year can be lost this year, if we do not meet tomorrow's challenges with new ideas. And let me add that in just the last few weeks we have seen budget proposals that threaten much of what we have gained through the years of hard work. I promise you today that this organization is not going to stand idly by while that bridge to the future has a toll booth set up on it for veterans to pass through. We gave this country its future and we are not going to pay to get there. While you meet in Convention this week, I encourage you to look back at our year and review what we have done and what still needs to be done. This is a week of hard work for each of us. We have to put our best effort, our best ideas and our strongest dedication into everything we do in the next four days. The future of veterans affairs hangs in the balance. We can do no less than do our best. I thank you again for your support, your encouragement and your dedication to our cause, and to going above and beyond for America's veterans. Thank you very, very much. (Whereupon, the assembly extended a prolonged standing ovation.) PRESENTATION OF AWARDS TO 1996-'97 ALL-AMERICANS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: It is now time for us to recognize the All-American Commanders for 1996-97. Much of our success during this past year is due to their hard work and leadership. We will also take this opportunity to honor those individuals who excelled in other programs sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary. These presentations are being made here at our Joint Opening Session to allow all of you the opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve. I would like to ask the National President of our great Ladies Auxiliary, Eileen Tanner, to join me at the center stage so we can jointly present awards to the national program winners. I would also like to ask Senior Vice Commander-in-Chief John Moon to assume this station and introduce our winners as the presentations are made. (Whereupon, Senior Vice Commander-in-Chief Moon assumed the Chair at this time.) SENIOR VICE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF MOON: I know everyone here is excited today for what we are about to do. I would, however, ask that you refrain from taking pictures that would tend to cause a delay in the orderly presentation of the awards. Your cooperation will allow us to give the recipients the recognition they have earned and allow us to proceed in an orderly fashion. The first award to be presented is for the National Americanism Record Book Program. The first place winner is Post 9693, Bay Village, Ohio. The next awards to be presented are the winners in the National Community Activities Record Book Contest. First place in Division 1 is Post 4633 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Hampden, Maine. First place in Division 2 is Post 3343 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Clyde, Ohio. First place in Division 3 is Post 6873 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Abilene, Texas. First place in Division 4 is Post 9972 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Sierra Vista, Arizona. Let's give these four national winners, as well as the rest of the Posts and Auxiliary that entered record books in the 1997 National Community Activities Record Book Contest, a big hand. (Applause) The next awards we are going to present are to the National Loyalty Day winners. First place winner is Post 775 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Ottumwa, Iowa. First place winner among districts goes to District 3 and its Ladies Auxiliary, Department of Virginia. The Department of Wisconsin and its Ladies Auxiliary were judged first place winners in state competition. Please give each and every one of them a round of applause for the Loyalty Program. (Applause) The next award to be presented is for the National Youth Activities Program. The first place winner among Posts and Auxiliaries goes to Post 2135, Peoria, Arizona, and its Ladies Auxiliary. To all of those, please give a warm hand for all the interest in the Youth Activities Programs. I would ask the Commander-in-Chief to escort the President of the National Auxiliary back to her seat. Before we conclude the programs awards, I would like to provide you with information about our community service programs for 1996-97. Nationally, the number of volunteer hours donated was over 12 million, and the total amount of monies spent or donated exceeded over $53 million through April 30. All totals exceeded last year's records. Truly a record of achievement the VFW and its Ladies Auxiliary can be extremely proud. This does conclude the Program Awards. Again, if you will all please give all our volunteers a big hand for the work they do to make our organization so successful. (Applause) Comrade Commander-in-Chief Jim Nier, will you please resume your station. (Whereupon, Commander-in-Chief Nier assumed the Chair.) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Thanks very much, John. I am sure that many of the Commanders I am about to introduce set their sights on becoming an All-American Department Commander when they assumed office a year ago. Through perseverance and effort, they achieved their goal. Today, they will receive their just award, the coveted red, white and blue cap that clearly distinguishes them as an All-American Department Commander. Before I begin announcing the names of the 1996-97 All- American Department Commanders, I would like to introduce a very special group of individuals. These special individuals are the Post and District Commanders who distinguished themselves, selected by their respective Department, as All- American Commanders. They are guests at the National Convention and will receive a trip to the Washington Conference in February. They are seated in the audience. I can't see them from right here, but as I read your name, will you, please, stand up and remain standing. Please hold your applause until I have read all of their names, if you would, please.

Comrade Commander-in-Chief. (Whereupon, Commander-in-Chief Nier assumes the Chair.) ESPN VIDEO PRESENTATION COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: As you are aware, VFW began advertising on ESPN, America's premier television sports network, in April. The response to that advertising has been extraordinary. Everywhere I go people express appreciation for the content and quality of our commercials. Our visibility on ESPN has generated articles in several major publications, including an in-depth article in a recent edition of the Wall Street Journal. Our exposure on ESPN is truly a showcase of the work of our great organization and the service and sacrifice of America's veterans. In case you've been wondering what all the excitement is about, ESPN has been kind enough to provide us with a brief video report of their efforts on our behalf. Please join me as we enjoy that video now. (Whereupon, the ESPN video was presented at this time.) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Thank you, comrades and sisters. I think you can see we have a wonderful affiliation with ESPN to get the word out on our great organization. PRESENTATION OF VFW GOLD MEDAL OF MERIT AND CITATION TO LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT EILEEN TANNER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: Founded in 1914, the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars has been an active part of everything that we've done. Together, we've accomplished many things and through those accomplishments we have built a better organization and a stronger nation. ``People Loving People for a Brighter Tomorrow'' is the theme of their National President, Eileen Tanner. Its inspiring challenge and Eileen's dynamic leadership allowed the Ladies Auxiliary to reach new milestones and set new records during the past year. In their own programs and in those they share with the VFW, great progress was made. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I now introduce to you the National President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Eileen Tanner, and present her with the VFW Gold Medal of Merit and Citation. Please welcome the most gracious lady that I know, Eileen Tanner. (Applause) I would like to read the citation, if I may. ``Gold Medal of Merit and this Citation awarded to Eileen Tanner, National President, Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, 1996-97. ``In special recognition of her untiring dedication to our country and in sincere appreciation for her enthusiastic leadership as evidenced by the exceptional contributions of the Ladies Auxiliary to the programs and purposes of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and, by their deeds, fulfillment of the commitment of `People Loving People for a Brighter Tomorrow'. ``In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and the official seal of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, this 18th day of August, 1997.'' This has been signed by James E. Nier, Commander-in-Chief, and Larry W. Rivers, Adjutant General. Eileen, it is with a great deal of pride and love that I present this to you. RESPONSE--LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT EILEEN TANNER LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT TANNER: Commander-in-Chief Nier, National VFW and Auxiliary Officers, Comrades, Sisters and Guests: It is an honor for me to receive this special award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. This past year has been quite memorable for me and has given me the opportunity to see firsthand how our programs help our people, personally handing out the pre-paid long- distance telephone cards when I was overseas, witnessing the spirit and determination of the avid wheelchair games participants, sharing the excitement of our scholarship winners in their achievements, and seeing the cancer research projects that we are funding and supporting this year were just a few of the remarkable experiences that I have had this past year. With each unique experience, I gained new insight and a fresh appreciation for the good that our program can provide. Each experience proved once again that the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Ladies Auxiliary are people, loving people who will go above and beyond for a brighter tomorrow. I want to say a special thank you to each VFW member here today on behalf of the 744,818 Auxiliary members. We have always been very proud of our partnership with the VFW and this past year has been no exception. Commander-in-Chief Nier, it was a pleasure to serve with you and on behalf of all the members of the Ladies Auxiliary I wish you a very successful National Convention. (Applause) PRESENTATIONS OF VOD WINNER CHRISTINE RICE AND YOUTH ESSAY CONTEST WINNER, DOMINIC E. DRAYE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: For the past 50 years, the Voice of Democracy Scholarship Program has challenged high school students to think, write and speak out for freedom and democracy. Today, this program reaches over 100,000 students and awards over $2.5 million in scholarships. Through these VFW scholarships, many young Americans are able to continue their education at the college and university levels. We are pleased to have with us today the 1997 First Place National Winner in the VFW Voice of Democracy Scholarship Program. She graduated from Laguardia High School of Music, Arts and Performing Arts in New York City, New York, and hopes to attend Georgetown University. She is sponsored by VFW Post 95 and its Ladies Auxiliary in Bronx, New York, and is accompanied today by her father and mother. Here to present her award-winning essay: ``Democracy -Above and Beyond'', the 1997 First Place National Voice of Democracy Winner and recipient of the $20,000 T. C. Selman Memorial Scholarship, Christine Rice. Let's welcome Christine. (Applause) MS. CHRISTINE RICE: Thank you so much for the warm welcome and the kind introduction. I just want to change part of that. Mr. Nier said I was hoping to attend Georgetown. Well, because of the VFW and because of the Voice of Democracy, I am going to go to Georgetown this Friday. They say pride comes before fall. I better watch my step, because you make me very, very proud. There are so many people that I have to thank, first, Post 95, the Chapter of the Ladies Auxiliary, and District 2, Department of New York, and finally the National Headquarters and Mr. Gordon Thorson. I also want to bring you a thank you from a very special group of people that are not here today. Last February, 54 finalists gathered in Washington, D.C. They represented all the states, the District of Columbia and the overseas regions. They were from every imaginable ethnic group. They came from major cities and rural towns, they were actors, auto mechanics, swimmers and skaters. They were by any objective measure the most intelligent and articulate and talented and the most dynamic group I have ever been with. Each of them asked that I tell you this morning how valuable the Voice of Democracy was to them and how grateful they are to you. Last fall, each of us spent a great deal of time reading about, thinking about, writing about, and finally speaking about democracy. This is truly a defining experience and a chance that we give ourselves in relation to our political system and in relation to our fellow citizens. How much of a difference can the Voice of Democracy make? Well, just a few weeks ago the nation lost one of its best known and most loved journalists. Charles Kuralt traveled throughout the country searching for heroes, the simple and visible heroes who make this country the envy of the world. His stories inspired each of us what inspired him. Charles Kuralt was one of the early national winners of the Voice of Democracy competition. I like to think that it was him that made me appreciate what a unique country and what a rare group of citizens we are. Thanks to all of you from each of us. You have given us a great gift. The topic for last year was ``Democracy--Above and Beyond.'' Out of the thousand essays, this is just one. It is one thing to turn on the television and watch a newscast about the pain that tyranny causes -- another to see that pain in the eyes of a friend. I've lived in a democracy ever since birth. But only lately, as I've grown older and met different people, have I begun to understand what democracy really means. Last year, my new neighbors told me how they risked their lives to get here, crossing the ocean in boats that were no more than rafts. This year, my friend Lena told me about her family's long wait for permission to emigrate. Last month, Paul, who spends most of his retirement as a volunteer helping children, showed me the number tattooed on his arm, a constant reminder of the years spent in concentration camps. I've never had to plan my escape. Or to hide my religion. Or to watch what I say and to whom I say it. I will never be forced to wear a veil in public. Or to have only one child. Why? Because I live in a democracy. Because our government is ruled not by the military, not by the economic elite, not by a handful of religious extremists, but by the will of the people. We, you and I, make the laws here. If we don't like those laws, we can change them. We are the ones responsible for what our government does. We are the government. People in many parts of the world are trying today to establish this same kind of self-rule. Places like the Russian Republic and the Palestinian West Bank are trying democracy for the first time in their history. Other countries, like those that fell behind the Iron Curtain, are trying to recapture the democracy stolen from them generations ago. All of them are trying to move above and beyond what they have experienced into what they yearn to experience. Beyond predetermined lives into lives that are as productive as their talents and energy will allow. Beyond mere acceptance of political decisions into actual involvement in shaping their direction. All of them, in other words, are finding their way out of the darkness of tyranny into the light of freedom. Many of these countries are struggling through this process of change. But that's to be expected. People need time to understand what it means to be free. When the United States began, it took us time to realize we could no longer blame the failures of government on any king or aristocrat, only on ourselves. Today, our model of democracy is repeated in many other lands where freedom has taken root. Just as democracy inspired Jefferson and Franklin, so it inspired Walesa and Mandella and Aquino. Just as democracy gave courage to the colonists of Boston, so it moved citizens to face tanks in Red Square and students to face bullets in Tianamen Square. Just as democracy spurred our militia at Bunker Hill, so have thousands of other patriots given their lives for the cause of freedom. But the voice of democracy is not always heard in the roar of the multitude. Sometimes it is only a single cry above the gunfire or a solitary whisper in the cells of political prisoners. So compelling and passionate a force is democracy that these cries and whispers can never be stilled. The power of that force is found in the words of Antoine de Saint Exupery, author of ``The Little Prince.'' His reconnaissance plane crashed into the sea in 1944, but his legacy of brotherhood lives on today. ``Democracy'', he wrote -- and these are his words-- ``makes each responsible for all, and all responsible for each.'' For those haunted by tyranny that message holds hopes. For my friends, Paul and Lena, and for all of us living in liberty, it holds special meaning as well. Democracy can never be just a destination -- it will always be a journey. Thank you. (Whereupon, the assembly extended a prolonged standing ovation.) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: I will ask our National President to please join us at the podium as we present this eagle trophy to Christine Rice, First Place National Winner, Voice of Democracy, 1997. Congratulations. (Applause) This was the second year of the VFW Youth Essay Contest, a program designed to give 7th, 8th and 9th grade students an opportunity to express their opinion on a patriotic theme. Over 56,900 students entered the competition nationwide. All 54 Departments submitted a winner. Savings bonds and other incentives, totaling over $407,000, were distributed by our membership to young people throughout our great nation. We are very pleased to have with us this morning, the 1997 National Winner of the VFW Youth Essay Program Competition. He was a ninth grade student at Blanchet High School in Seattle, Washington, when he wrote his winning essay. He is sponsored by VFW Post 3348 and its Ladies Auxiliary from Seattle, Washington, and is accompanied today by his father, mother and sister. Here to present his award-winning essay: ``What Makes America Great'', the 1997 First Place National Youth Essay Winner and recipient of a $5,000 United States Savings Bond, Dominic Draye. (Applause) MR. DOMINIC DRAYE: Thank you, Mr. Nier, and all of you for this wonderful opportunity here in Salt Lake City. ``What Makes America Great.'' America is a great nation for many reasons. However, to me America's greatness stems directly from the American Dream. Throughout history the American Dream has inspired people to develop this country from thirteen struggling colonies to the most industrialized nation in the world. The American Dream exists in the hearts of the American people, the hands of the American worker, the eager eyes of immigrants, and the strong minds of American youth. Because of the American Dream, the greatness of America is guaranteed for years to come. America is great because of the American Dream of freedom and democracy. It is alive in every person who votes and participates in the democratic process. From small town meetings to the national government Americans exercise their freedom. In the past when this precious aspect of the dream has been threatened, American men and women have fought and even given their lives to preserve our democracy and keep our country free and strong. America is great because of the American Dream of achievement. Hard work and creativity result in advancements that provide a safe, healthy, and comfortable life for Americans. America is great because of the ingenuity of dreamers like the Wright brothers, Henry Ford, Neil Armstrong, and Bill Gates. Because of achievements like theirs, American industry is able to flourish and make our country prosperous. The American Dream of opportunity is so real that it draws thousands of foreigners from around the world to start new life in America. They are drawn to possibilities based on the promise that if they work hard they can improve life for themselves and their families. America is great because of the American Dream of a better tomorrow. Nowhere is this more alive than in the minds of young people. This dream promises that regardless of where you live, the family you are in, the race you belong to, or the religion you practice you can shape your own future through hard work. The most important step in keeping America great in the years to come is maintaining the freedom to dream and the possibility to make those dreams come true. The American Dream contributes to making the country great because it challenges people's creativity, inspires citizens to reach new heights, it draws people to come and share their talents here, and challenges youth to reach for a better tomorrow. This is what makes America great. (Applause) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: I would ask the National President to please come forward again. Eileen and I wish at this time to present Dominic E. Draye with this $5,000 United States Savings Bond. As we did with Christine, we would like to present this eagle trophy to Dominic Draye, First Place National Winner, Youth Essay, 1997. Congratulations. They are two outstanding young Americans. I would say to both Christine and Dominic that the limits as to what you can do in your lives are those that you place upon yourself. I know I speak for the Ladies Auxiliary and the VFW members when I say we certainly wish you both the very best in all of your future endeavors. Let's give them one more round of applause. (Applause) PRESENTATION OF THE CHAPEL OF FOUR CHAPLAINS LEGION OF HONOR BRONZE MEDALLION COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: I would like to introduce Boyd W. Winterton, Past National Chaplain of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He is here representing the Chapel of the Four Chaplains. Bishop Winterton. COMRADE BOYD WINTERTON: No tradition of the American society is more precious to or characteristic of our culture than that of voluntarily reaching out to neighbors in need. Such selfless service is part of both our civic and our religious heritage. The Chapel of Four Chaplains, a national non-profit organization, is founded upon one shining manifestation of that heritage. That is Army Chaplain George L. Fox, John P. Washington, Alexander D. Goode and Clark V. Poling who, after giving their life jackets to the soldiers who had none, linked arms with one another and went down with the U.S. Army Transport Dorchester after it was torpedoed on February 3, 1943. In this extreme act of voluntary service to others, these four Chaplains, one Catholic, two Protestants and one Jewish, displayed the highest sense of interfaith unity and the best of the national tradition of selfless service. To recognize and to encourage acts of volunteerism, brotherhood and sacrifice among Americans of every age and station in life, the chapel has established its Legion of Honor program. The bronze medallion is an award given by the Chapel in recognition of exceptional selfless service on the part of an individual which contributes to the well-being of others at the national or world level, and to a spirit of interfaith cooperation. Will the Commander-in-Chief and the National President, please join me at the podium. For exemplary countless years of selfless service to others, on behalf of the Chapel of Four Chaplains, it is my privilege to present the traditional Legion of Honor Bronze Medallion to Commander-in-Chief James E. Nier and National President Eileen Tanner. I wish to thank Adjutant General Larry Rivers for being present and coming forward and placing of these medallions. There is, in addition to the medallion, a plaque, which will be presented to each of these recipients, which reads as follows: ``The Legion of Honor Bronze Medallion to James E. Nier'' and similarly to Ladies Auxiliary President Eileen Tanner,'' on August 18, 1997, in recognition of your service to all people regardless of race or faith. This award symbolizes for all Americans and for all time the unity of this nation founded upon the fatherhood of our God.'' I asked Eileen if she wanted me to take her plaque and maybe she had a reservation about the chaplain. She said I will just give it to my Chief of Staff. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: I have been asked by Eileen to speak for both of us, and I will certainly do that. Thank you, Boyd, for bestowing this great honor upon us this morning from the Chapel of Four Chaplains. PRESENTATION OF VFW ARMED FORCES AWARD, GOLD MEDAL AND CITATION COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NIER: It is fitting this morning that during this opening session of our 98th National Convention we present the VFW Armed Forces Award to a very unique but extremely important activity of the United States Army. Since it was established in 1973, the men and women of the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, have labored long and hard in the search, recovery and identification of our military personnel lost in World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam, as well as other conflicts and contingencies. With steadfast commitment and compassion, the men and women of CILHI, as it is known in the military, have worked tirelessly to help bring closure to hundreds of families who have lost loved ones and who have wondered if their grief and search would ever come to an end. Since its inception CILHI has identified 593 remains from World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The CILHI team has also rendered assistance in such terrible disasters as the 1983 Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, the Arrow air crash in Gander, Newfoundland in 1985, the USS Stark Missile attack in the Persian Gulf in 1987, and the explosion of the USS Iowa. CILHI also provides planning information and assistance to Joint Task Force-Full Accounting in its search and recovery missions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. It is with pride and a deep sense of honor that the Veterans of Foreign Wars presents its Armed Forces Award to the men and women of the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for their dedication and unwavering sense of mission. Here to accept this award on their behalf of the Commander of the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, Colonel James Colvin, United States Army. I would like to read this citation. ``National Armed Forces Award, Gold Medal and Citation awarded to the United States Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii. ``In special recognition of the unprecedented dedication exhibited by the men and women of CILHI as they perform their mission of searching for, recovering and identifying remains of American military personnel associated with losses from World War II, Korea, Vietnam and other conflicts. Due to their unwavering sense of mission, included in their major achievements, besides their work in Southeast Asia, are the identification of the casualties from the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983, the Gander, Newfoundland, air crash in 1985, and the USS Stark missile attack in the Persian Gulf in 1987. ``In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and the official seal of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States this 18th day of August, 1997. Approved by the National Council of Administration.'' This has been signed by James E. Nier, Commander-in-Chief, and Larry W. Rivers, Adjutant General. Colonel Colvin, it is with a great deal of pride and honor I present this to you on behalf of all the fine work that you and your people do for our great cause. REMARKS--COLONEL JAMES COLVIN COLONEL COLVIN: Good morning. Commander-in-Chief Nier, Mr. Steadman, Distinguished Members of the VFW: It is indeed a privilege and honor to be standing before you today and accept this award on behalf of the soldiers and civilians of the Central Identification Laboratory of Hawaii. We are truly honored to join the most distinguished ranks of the prior recipients of this award. As a member of the mission, we have always had the utmost respect for the VFW. The wide variety of programs have a tremendous impact on the veterans and their families. The programs for the needy, programs for homeless, programs such as the Voice of Democracy which helps high school students strive for excellence. Of course, the countless other programs that offer assistance to service members and civilians alike. The organization is a valuable asset to all veterans, and it is a great privilege to be honored by such an outstanding association of veterans. The honor of our organization being presented with this award is a direct tribute to the unparalleled dedication and professionalism of my soldiers and civilians to perform the utmost worthwhile humanitarian mission of our armed forces, the mission that fulfilled the promise to service members who gave their lives for our freedom will not be forgotten. I have been Commander of CILHI for 11 months. Since my assumption of the command in September, 1996, I have just been in sheer awe of the organization's mission and our outstanding personnel. The mission that is extremely difficult, extremely rewarding, and sometimes misunderstood. The extreme difficulty lies in the backs of our 13 search and recovery teams, the teams that spend approximately nine months out of every year deployed all over the world conducting excavations of crash sites, mass graves and isolated barriers, giving their best efforts to recover the remains of our fallen comrades. Their efforts take them from the jungles of Vietnam to the tropical rain forest of the Amazon Jungle in Brazil, from the high remote mountain regions of Papua, New Guinea, to the tiny remote islands in the South Pacific. From the 17,000 feet glaciers of Tibet, China, to the mostly unfriendly soil of now North Korea. Despite all that time the deploy of these arduous conditions, I can honestly say I have never heard them complain one time. In fact, the only time I have ever heard these guys complain is when I take them off their mission. Our mission is extremely rewarding and for me personally gratifying. As a matter of fact, rewarding is only a word that touches the service. To be able to return the remains of someone's loved one to the family is an honor that you can just not express with mere words. To be able to answer a question that has been lingering in the minds and hearts of these families for some 25 to some 50 years is an honor that we take with great pride at CILHI. Colonel Ward Neggas, the Director of the Casualty Affairs Operation Center in Alexandria, Virginia, my boss, who is with us here today, sends me E-mail just about every day. At the end of the E-mail he used the expression, ``It is heart work as opposed to it is hard work.'' By the way, it is great to have your headquarters 4,000 miles away from Alexandria, Virginia. This mission is one that you cannot prepare with any cost benefit analysis or dollar value, or any such statistical measures. When you have a mission such as ours, you need not look any further than the tears of the families whose loved ones never came home. When family members of these mission service members visits to our organization, it became real important and it brings it very much home to hear how important our mission is, to hear these families tell of their loved ones brings realization home to every member of CILHI. These are war heroes. There are still lives in the hearts and memories of these families. We owe it to them to bring them home for they are truly not forgotten. However, it is a tragedy that everyone does not realize the importance of keeping that promise. To many people our mission is greatly misunderstood. Not everyone understands why our government goes to such great lengths to account for those service members that never came home. They tend to focus more on, well, how much does this cost? When is enough enough? Why does it take so long? Is it really worth it? Hearing questions like this, it is very disconcerting for me personally and the rest of my colleagues at CILHI and other government organizations that deal in this issue, and I know for you of the VFW. For the most part, though, these people don't really intend to sound insensitive. A part of them has forgotten what sacrifices these veterans have made for our nation and the true cost of what freedom really is. However, CILHI, we don't get discouraged when we hear this on the news or in the newspapers, we rededicate our efforts to try hard to fulfill the promises, to carry out the mission to bring our comrades home. I would like to relate a story to you that kind of brings it home or brought it home for me. If you have ever been to Hawaii, Hickam Air Force Base where we are stationed, every month we have arrival and departure ceremonies for the U. S. service members that come home. It is a monthly ceremony. At one such occasion, I was standing next to a veteran. At the end of the ceremony, I introduced myself to him and we were chit-chatting. He turned to me and he says, ``Sir, you know, there is one thing that I would like to say.'' I said, ``What is that?'' He said, ``No matter where we are sent, one thing is sure, you are always going to get a free ride home.'' I thank God that organizations like the VFW and many others out there recognize the importance of fulfilling the promises of these veterans that gave their lives to this country. The families, of course, are missing them. Once again, I would like to thank you on behalf of all the soldiers in CILHI. It is an honor to be recognized by your organization. If you are ever, ever in Hawaii, please stop by and see us. I think you will be most impressed. Thank you very much and I salute each and every one of you, and I leave you with the following: simply, anchors away and aim high and hope. (Applause) INTRODUCTION OF CHARLES D.

REMARKS--MOC COMMANDER CHARLES SHORT MOC COMMANDER SHORT: Commander-in-Chief Nier, President Eileen, after those remarks I don't know what to do. Let me say to you, however, Chief, on behalf of the Military Order of the Cootie we are on your team for this year and we appreciate all the efforts that we could give you in support of your objectives for this year. The MOC is indeed proud to support our organization and we are a part of the team. To Larry, to Joe, most especially to Joe, we thank you for all your support over this past year. We appreciate all the efforts that have been made to support us during those difficult times, and we want to report to you that we are succeeding and we are most importantly supporting our veterans. But it has been my special pleasure for me to serve this year as your Supreme Commander. As I said before, I am very proud of the accomplishments that we, the MOC, have made this year. I hope during this year that I have let no one down, because I have tried in all my dealings to uphold the finest traditions of our organizations, the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I truly appreciate the hospitality extended to me throughout this entire country as I traveled from Maine to Florida, from Massachusetts, from North Carolina to California. When I got out to California, my second trip this year, I was really shocked and surprised of the support of Commander Robert Marr and from Junior Vice Commander Richard was really outstanding. I will never forget San Diego. I don't think any other Commander will forget San Diego. I must also thank my Department. The Department of Maine, who has supported me over the many years, no matter where I have been, no matter what kind of hat I have worn, no matter what was written on my hat, they have supported me. So has my Post. The Department, once again, I want to say thank you to the Department of California, to all the Departments that I had a chance to visit over the last five years. I want to say thank you and especially to the Department of Europe. You are a grand bunch of guys leading the way. As for the MOC, we are a little richer than we were last year and much richer than we were the year before. We have worked on the reduced budget, but we have met those guidance and we came in under budget. Our hospital work this year established a new record for our organization, one we can all be proud of. We were at $35,000 above the record breaking last year. Even though our membership was down, we have as individuals and small groups contributed to the disaster relief, which is so important to us, to help one another. To our Posts and Departments, my message as I traveled around this year has been one of working together, of pulling together behind our leader Jim, of pulling together behind our leader for next year, John Moon, of working to make our organization just a little better, because we wanted to contribute. Just as the rowers in that long boat that I so often talk about, we have to pull in unison. We have to work as part of the team. John, we will be there and working on your team. You know, the total and the totality of our organization is much greater than the supplement parts. We must as members recognize and respect one another and work together. The second part of my message was very simple. Be proud. I say this as a Vietnam veteran, because it took me a long time to be proud, but be proud of your service. You earned it, you deserved it and now stand ta"
