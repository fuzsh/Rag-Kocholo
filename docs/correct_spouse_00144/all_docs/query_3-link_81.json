        "text": "From the juiced-box and the soundtrack: Artist – Song\n\nhttps://pjensi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/led-zeppelin-when-the-levee-breaks.mp3\n\n[Press ‘Play’ for a song this movie deserves]\n\nRamblings: Argo For It\n\nFinal Proof: 4 ½ Shots\n\nYou know how you get drunk on Thanksgiving? The second you arrive you feel at home and you settle in knowing the food is gonna be good because your mom’s a great cook and your little brother cracks you up and your dad will get drunk on Wild Turkey and tell some stories and your sister is a drama queen that makes the meal a little tense but not too much, just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and the best thing about the dinner is none of these things but it’s the buzz you know is gonna come and only get better because it’s not the holiday getting you off, it’s the knowing it’s good while it’s happening. That’s what you’re going to be thankful for: you won’t wait until later to look back on this night fondly—you’ll feel damn good about it while it’s in your lap. That, Barmaids and Beerhounds, is exactly what Argo is like.\n\nDear Ben Affleck,\n\nYou are a fucking genius.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEveryone\n\ni’m only going to say this once because to say it twice would be stupid. i fucking love this movie.\n\nBe honest, Ben Affleck isn’t a bad actor but he looks better than he acts. Still, he’s a better director than either of those put together. Don’t believe me? Check out where i already said it when i reviewed The Town which was another kick ass movie.\n\nWant me to give you some proof other than just saying he’s great over and over like a grateful groupie in his trailer with the residue of a tequila body shot mixing with sweat drying on her stomach while she’s being so ecstatically ridden she doesn’t even care he’s not wearing a condom? Sure, i can do that.\n\nSmart Affleck kept the style of the 70’s throughout the entire movie and not just the props (pull tab cans of Tab, Star Wars action figures…) but the look and feel of the film as well. Hell, even the Warner Bros opening logo is the one used 1972-1984 and is all scratchy looking like the film was found back then. There’s that but there’s also the realism that Argo soaks in—for example the intensity of the Iranians taking over the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. That scene is even more powerful because Affleck lets the story tell itself rather than trying to force it into the position he likes best.\n\nBig Ben has this sensitive touch and it would have been way easy to pour on the drama and the fear and the shock and the tension but instead of being heavy handed his delicate touch puts in only the right amount of each and the overall effect is poignant respect. Like Canada. Who knew Canada was cool? Go ahead and make all the Canadian jokes you want to, i’m giving you permission, but when you’re done add a little “Thank You” because those pussies have balls. Argo will show you that, too.\n\nNo, i did not give this movie a full 5 shots and i’ll tell you why even if the explanation is boring. The first reason is the ending went on too long. Ben Gay spent a lot of time wrapping things up and there wasn’t even that much present. Next, he got a little carried away in the final scenes at the airport. Sure, he could’ve made it schoolery and that would’ve sucked harder because i would have given it less than 4½ shots and i woulda bitched that a movie isn’t a documentary and he should’ve taken some liberties to make it more exciting and he took my advice but he took it too far, is all. The last reason i didn’t give it 5 shots isn’t the movie’s fault. Argo is just a spy movie. Sure, OK, it’s a spy movie that rises above spy movies like a cloud of sensa-million floating out of James Bond’s mouth and going right over his head, but still, it’s a spy movie, people.\n\nIn the end, Argo makes you feel something (which is better than feeling something in the end), exactly like the Thanksgiving i talked about up top. Affleck added the right amount of action (except a little too much at the end), humor, drama, history to make a movie you will remember when you’re going around the table, telling all the movies you’re thankful for.\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: 1 Shot\n\nThe actresses were beautiful, as is my want, but hiding out in a Canadian embassy doesn’t really lend itself well to sex scenes in the shower, bikini pool parties or playful lesbian exploration. Point is, just because there wasn’t a lot of coming going on doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go out and see Argo.\n\nSpeaking of coming out, Clea Duvall has played a lot of lesbian roles and lesbians seem to think she’s a member of the Clan of the Cave Bare, so i’m thinking all we need is an exposé in the Bar None to push her all the way out of the closet. It goes something like this.\n\ni got more Clea shots in my nether drawers. Just scroll down to the end of this shit, then look for the link that says “Continue reading”, or the sign that says “Drawers”.\n\nAlso making an appearance was the beautiful Kerry Bishé, and the 70s really suited her. Of course, there’s quite a lot that suits her and here’s what i mean by that.\n\nThere’s also some drawer shots of her down there. Keep going lower until you hit bottom.\n\nSilken Butterflies\n\nThere were gobs of Silken Butterflies in this and i’m gonna start by talking about Nancy Stelle, the best one. And i’m not saying she’s the best because she was brave enough to let me interview her for the Booze Talkin’, because i don’t need to. Nancy played a Swiss Air flight attendant and because Ben Dover cut some of her scenes, you’ll see more of her here than you will in the movie.\n\nThere’s more better of where this came from in my Booze Talkin’ Interview with her.\n\nSpeaking of Booze Talkin’ (and isn’t everyone), i’m also going to do an interview probably for sure with the beautiful mind Amitis Frances Ariano, who was a Persian Dancer. She’s getting medical exams now (to be a doctor, not a patient), so the interview will have to wait until after she aces her tests. Here’s a sneak preview.\n\ni say “probably for sure” because sometimes silken butterflies say they’ll do the interview and then they flit away without a word when i send the questions. Such was the case of Kelly Curran, who plays the lead of the movie within a movie during the dress rehearsal script reading. First, she accepted the interview then sobered up and ignored me like i was a tax collector ex-boyfriend.\n\nYou know who is adorable? Because i do. It’s Sheila Vand. Sheila plays the Iranian maid and she does a kick ass job speaking Iranian, like i would know if she didn’t. What i also know is she has the cutest nose i’ve ever seen and it goes really well with the rest of her. Check it.\n\nHow could i not have shots of her in my drawers? Scroll down and you’ll see…\n\nThere was also an all too brief appearance by the one and lovely Taylor Schilling who showed up at the end as Tony’s wife, Christine Mendez.\n\nBlah blah blah Drawer Shots blah blah.\n\nOne of the nice things about Argo was all the scenes they filmed in airports and airplanes, which means we get Swissair Gate Agents like Annie “Not So” Little…\n\n…and British Airways Flight Attendants like model Allegra Carpenter.\n\nDefinitely more shots of her hanging out in my drawers.\n\nFor those of you more interested in Arguys than Argirls, there was the still studly Ben Affelck who showed off his hairy yet buff chest in one scene where he changes. There’s also some debate about how serious he is when he says he’s been sober for 10 years, but that’s not my business. This is my business:\n\ni put more shots of him on the top of the pile in my drawers.\n\nA shout out is long overdue to Overdude Bryan Cranston who can go from the dad in Malcolm in the Middle to a meth manufacturer in Breaking Bad and kill both roles before doing a jig on their graves while he picks up his Emmy. His role in Argo is a little more traditional but he nails it like a frat guy with a case of Mike’s Hard Lemonade.\n\nDrink: 2 Shots\n\nThere were a lot of scenes with booze but alcohol didn’t play a key part in the film so that boils down to 2 shots.\n\nHere’s the blow by blow.\n\nWine in Canadian embassy hideout\n\nBen drinks Miller Lite at dinner with fast food\n\nWhiskey at Hollywood restaurant\n\nRed wine @ Hollywood rooftop party\n\nWhiskey toast, “Argo fuck yourself”\n\nWe’re entering Iranian airspace and we’ll be coming through to collect any alcoholic beverages.\n\n–Flight attendant on Tony Mendez’s (Ben Affleck) flight\n\nWine and whiskey and gin @ night before leaving party\n\nBen drinks shots of whiskey hotel room because he has to think\n\nIt is our pleasure to announce alcoholic beverages are now available as we have cleared Iranian airspace.\n\n— Happy ending defined by booze\n\nChampagne on the plane to celebrate\n\nRock & Roll: 4 Shots\n\n4 shots and worth every drop. First, there was the suspense which Ben tossed up here masterfully like a master tosser. OK, yes, he jumped the shark in that one scene in the airplane where he sees the cop cars next to the plane but he was doing such a god lob until then that you gotta cut him a slack–and one shot off.\n\n(BTW, for those intellectuals reading this post, both of you, the real story of the “Canadian Caper” can be found at these kick ass sites i bothered to look up for y’all. “A Classic Case of Deception” is the story as told by Antonio “Tony” Mendez himself on the CIA’s website. Nate Jones gives a nice, behind the scenes comparison of the movie to the real event in his article “The True Story Behind Argo” at ForeignPolicy.com.)\n\nThen there was the music. Ben got lucky that the late 70’s was ripe with tuneage, but he also avoided the disco balls. It was an easy call but he made it and he included Led Zeppelin and it was “When the Levee Breaks”. What was the last movie you saw that had “When the Levee Breaks” in it? Exactly. 4 full shots, babes.\n\nHe also included Van Halen’s “Dance the Night Away” (which did come out in ’79, i checked) and this song by the Rolling Stones which isn’t bad for a Stones song but is no “When the Levee Breaks”.\n\nhttps://pjensi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rolling-stones-little-ta.mp3\n\n[Press ‘Play’ for a Little T&A]\n\nBoring Technical Crap\n\nWritten by:\n\nJoshuah Bearman: article “Escape from Tehran”\n\nChris Terrio: screenplay\n\nDirected by: Ben Affleck\n\nStarring\n\nNancy Stelle – Swissair Flight Attendant\n\nAmitis Frances Ariano – Persian Dancer\n\nClea DuVall – Cora Lijek\n\nKerry Bishé – Kathy Stafford\n\nSheila Vand – Sahar\n\nKelly Curran – Princess Aleppa\n\nAllegra Carpenter – British Airways Flight Attendant\n\nAnnie Little – Swissair Gate Agent\n\nTaylor Schilling – Christine Mendez\n\nBen Affleck – Tony Mendez\n\nBryan Cranston – Jack O’Donnell\n\nAlan Arkin – Lester Siegel\n\nJohn Goodman – John Chambers\n\nBottom Line\n\nRepeat after me: “This is not an action movie.” Promise me you will see this movie but that you won’t be expecting an action movie, because then you’ll be disappointed.

You start in on the spirits and you already know what’s going to happen even before you begin but sure enough after the first glass you feel the tension terrify your ass and it stresses you out a little bit but the beer is good and your having such a good time you don’t want to stop so you keep adding liquid fuel to the gas and when the bubble finally bursts at least its not a piece of shit plus the wind makes you jump and some moments are bigger than others and some really freak you out but in the end of your end it’s “no shart, no foul” and you walk shakily away just happy it didn’t stink. Paranormal Activity 4 is a lot like that flatulence.\n\ni heard what you were saying about this movie before i went and i didn’t listen but believed you anyway so i really expected not a whole hell of a lot. Now, i’m not saying y’all were wrong but i am saying you weren’t right. OK, just uttering the words “Paranormal Activity 4” is enough to make a toddler laugh but the fact it’s lost its cool factor doesn’t mean it’s not cool.\n\nWhat do i know about it? What do i know about it? Are you forgetting i’m the guy who’s reviewed Paranormal Activity 1, Paranormal Activity 2 and Paranormal Activity 3? (What can i say– i needed counting practice.) Basically, they get better as they go along and i mean the movies, not my reviews which kick it from the start and never let up.\n\nPA3 was the scariest of the series but instead of going one better, Paranormal 4 gasps and dies a little.\n\nFor those of you who want to see the movie but don’t remember what happened in the other Paranormals, here’s a cheat sheet for your lazy asses:\n\nParanormal Activity 1: (October 2006) Micah and Katie are harassed by a demon and record it on a digital camera.\n\nParanormal Activity 2: (Prequel: September 2006) Kristi (Katie’s younger sister), her husband and her hot step daughter are bugged by the same demon and record it on digital home security cameras.\n\nParanormal Activity 3: (Pre-prequel: 1998) Kristi and Katie are little girls and are stalked by a demon and their stepdad records it on videocassette camera.\n\nParanormal Activity 4: (Sequel: November 2011) A blonde teen is tormented by an evil Ben with hormones, but also an evil spirit and the neighbor kid from across the street. Her adventures are mostly recorded on webcams and an Xbox.\n\nYou probably want to know what doesn’t work here and i get that so i’ll tell you, but it’s mostly minor things. Like at the beginning, Alex (Kathryn Newton) films stupid things that no one would ever film in real life but it just happens to be what we need to see to understand what the fuck the movie is about. Once she sets up webcams to figure out what the fuck is happening in her house, it gets a little more logicaller.\n\nThe bottom line is that the movie was good enough to “scare” me. i mean, i wasn’t huddled down under the seat but i was definitely tense and sure, most of the frights came from “got you” moments when things jump at the screen and most of the suspense was knowing things were going to jump out at you and you had to wait for it, but there were some genuine moments of creepy eeriness and those made the movie worthwhile.\n\nKathryn Newton carried the movie well on her delicate shoulders and there were only a couple scenes where she had “actor in training” tattooed on her forehead. While we’re on that, i have to card Kathryn here because she’s only 15. [Meaning i won’t put pictures of her with the seductive shots of the other actresses and I won’t use any shots that are not obviously promotional shots from her team–nothing age inappropriate inside the Bar None, peeps.]\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: 1 Shot\n\nKatie Featherston is amazing because she gets thinner and younger with each movie. It doesn’t make any sense in the story, but there’s definitely something out of this world playing with that girl and i’m thinking it’s because she sold her soul to the devil. Just sayin’. Here’s what i’m on about.\n\nThere are some single shots of Katie filling my drawers at the bottom of this post. Scroll down until you hit the “Read More” link.\n\nPlaying Paranormal’s MILF (Mother I’d Like To Frighten) is Alexondra Lee who goes something like this:\n\nIMDB lists Sprague Grayden (Katie’s sister Kristi) as being in the movie but i didn’t know that she didn’t film any nude new scenes for Paranormal 4 until i saw the film because they only used footage from Paranormal 2. Fortunately for you, i’d already downloaded all the shots so you get some Sprague shots in your face whether you want it or not.\n\nWhatever, “Sprague” is still the coolest girl’s name ever and i’d so love to live naked with her for no other reason (except one or two) that we could have exchanges where i’d be all,\n\n“Hey, Sprage-un.”\n\nAnd she’d be all, “Dude…think of more cool nicknames for me.”\n\nSo i’d think for a minute and then i’d yell out,\n\n“Sprag-a-Muffin!”\n\nAhh, the good ol’ days we haven’t had yet. Check my drawers for more spare Sprague shots.\n\nFor those of you who are more into Incubus than Succubus, there’s the DILF (Dad i’d Like to Freak) Stephen Dunham.\n\nLet’s talk about the spark between Ben and Alex (Kathryn Newton, who is too young to be talked about here but apparently her character isn’t). While it’s mentioned she’s still a virgin, her Ben Pal is definitely interested in piercing that mystery. Problem is, in real life Kathryn is only 15 and Matt Shively (Ben) is 22. Has he not heard of ½ your Age + 7? [On another age related note, Katie Featherston plays Sprague Grayden’s older sister in the series, but IRL Katie is 2 years younger than her “younger sister”.]\n\nHere’s a bonus of this Frog Prince.\n\nDrink: ½ Shot\n\nNothing much to write home about, or here either for that matter. There were a couple references i jotted down in my notebook, though.\n\nDad drinks beer in front of the TV. Uses a glass.\n\nMom drinks wine. Uses a glass, too.\n\nRock & Roll: 3 Shots\n\nYeah, i’ll go all the way up to 3 shots on this. The movie starts off a little slow but then kicks in and that’s gotta be worth something, as does the fact they included Rob Zombie’s “Dragula” (as did i at the top of this post) so all in all i feel good about rounding up to 3 shots on this.\n\nBoring Technical Crap\n\nWritten by:\n\nChad Feehan – story\n\nChristopher Landon – screenplay\n\nDirected by: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman\n\nStarring\n\nKatie Featherston – Katie\n\nKathryn Newton – Alex\n\nSprague Grayden – Kristi\n\nAlexondra Lee – Holly\n\nMatt Shively – Ben\n\nStephen Dunham – Doug\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf it’s between Paranormal Activity 4 and a bad movie, choose this one.\n\nHaven’t Had Your Fill of the Booze Revooze?

Sure, the idea looks good on paper because you’re combining two of your favorite things, drinking and bouncing, and there’s lots of action and lots of fun and you laugh a lot and get your kicks and sure, there are some moments when you get a little tired but your friends are super even if their jokes are often lame but the biggest advantage and the biggest weakness is the exact same thing: drinking in a bouncy castle means you can’t break anything, hurt yourself or take any risks and it’s nice to know you’re safe but sometimes it’s better to leave the safety zone and take some chances and get into the shit. So you have sweet and innocent fun time and you’d do it again in a heartbeat unless something else more better, more intellectualer comes along. That’s what seeing The Avengers was like.\n\nThe Avengers is The King’s Speech of action movies. It’s very well made and technically perfect with all of the boxes of “good movie” checked, like beautiful actors and good action and quips and zingers and extra special effects and good guys that are 100% good and bad guys that are 100% bad and the good guy wins and the bad guy loses and they all live happily ever after. It’s like guys’ gymnastics where they have that one routine when everyone has to do the same one. The Avengers is like that: perfectly executed and routine.\n\nBut sometimes you want popcorn and not corny pop and hard rock not pop rocks and whiskey not wine coolers and quicksand not Disney Land and a lap dance not romance. At those times you’ll be glad for The Dark Knight–but not The Avengers.\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: ½ Shot\n\nThank god they could find one super heroine in the men’s club, because this really is a men’s club, didn’t you see what i wrote up there about guys’ gymnastics? Who watches guys’ gymnastics anyway? Men who don’t think Scarlett Johansson is hot, that’s who.\n\nPlus there’s some unbelievable shots of her stuck to the bottom of my drawers, at the end of this review. Scroll down until you get to the “Continue Reading” link and click away.\n\nYou know who else i was happy to see here and it’s not Robert Downey Jr even though i was happy to see him too? Cobie Smothers or whatever her name is from How I Met Your Mother. She was already very cute in that show even if i didn’t recognize her here for a minute or two in her military uniform. Let’s just say she looks better out of it.\n\nNot to mention the shots of her in my drawers, after the “Continue Reading” link down there.\n\nDon’t forget Gwyneth Paltrow, who’s back once again as Peter Stark’s love assistant. And what a back and ass-instance she was. There was this one scene with her in denim short shorts and, like Gwyneth or not, you’ll like her. Like this.\n\nYes, more pixxx of her in my drawers, after the “Continue Reading” link at the bottom of this page.\n\nSilken Butterflies\n\nThe good news is that the magnificent Ashley Johnson had a brief appearance in The Avengers as “Waitress”. The bad news is that it was brief. Still, from the way she looked at Captain America, i have the impression we’ll be seeing more of her in the sequel.\n\nFor those of you more hooked on heroes than heroines…\n\nCeleste E Hall giggled the whole walk home from this movie, confused like a deli patron unable to decide which hero was the hottest. To give her a hand, i thought i’d do a little poll dance. Vote below for the hero who carried you away the farthest.\n\nIf you need to examine these speci-men more closely, the full shots are after the “Continue Reading” link at the bottom of this post.\n\nDrink: 0 Shots\n\nWhat can i say, i got nothin’. The only notes i scrawled were:\n\nStark offers Loki a drink. “Sure you don’t want one? I’m having one.” Whiskey from a snifter.\n\n[Later] Captured Loki says, “About that drink…”\n\nRock & Roll: 4 ½ Shots\n\nOn a scale of Bright Star to the first Matrix, The Avengers holds its own (as i sometimes do, but with my left hand so i can pretend it’s someone else’s). Lots of action and only enough talk to knock it down 1/2 a shot. The special effects were solid and there was even some real rock and roll, beginning with the Soundgarden that kicked off this shit and including this old but still kicking AC/DC classic.\n\nhttps://pjensi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ac-dc-shoot-to-thrill.mp3\n\nOne interesting disappointment was the fights. Remember how you were a kid and talking to some buds while smoking some other ones, and you were all like, “Who do you think would win if [insert super hero] got in a fight with [insert different super hero]?” We now know the answer will usually be “It’d be a tie.” Especially if one of the combatants is Thor.\n\nBased on these battles:\n\nThor v. The Hulk\n\nThor v. Iron Man\n\nThor v. Captain America\n\nThor v. Loki\n\nThe Hulk v. Black Widow\n\nThere were two cards that weren’t undecided:\n\nBlack Widow v. Hawkeye (Black Widow by TKO)\n\nThe Hulk v. Loki (The Hulk in a first round knock out)\n\nBoring Technical Crap\n\nWritten by:\n\nStan Lee & Jack Kirby (comic book)\n\nJoss Whedon (screenplay)\n\nZak Penn & Joss Whedon (story)\n\nDirected by: Joss Whedon\n\nStarring\n\nScarlett Johansson – Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow\n\nCobie Smulders – Agent Maria Hill\n\nGwyneth Paltrow – Pepper Potts\n\nAshley Johnson – Waitress\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Tony Stark / Iron Man\n\nSamuel L.

If only because it’s the number one selling movie of all time. And you should see it on the biggest screen you can find.

Curls\n\ni’m allergic to exercise. Serious. Every time i try it, i sweat profusely and my heart rate increases and my breathing becomes labored so now all i do is watch TV because nothing bad happens to me that way. i’m also allergic to booze. It makes me break out in stupid. Mixing these? Are you on bath salts and after a little face time?\n\nApparently Chris Bailey, who used to be 28, was. He drank with his landlord in England until 3am when the landlord went to bed, but when the landlord woke up he saw the front door open and the garage light on and found Chris couldn’t handle the pressure…of the weights he’d been drunk lifting. Chris had been working out in the early morning and was dead, crushed by the weights he was lifting trying to lift. Look on the bright side, Chris, at least you’ll be the burliest mother fucker in heaven. Maybe not in hell, though–they got lots and lots of burly fucks in hell– so let’s hope you’re going to heaven.\n\nHere’s another reason, like you need one, not to lift weights.\n\nCelebrity Dregs\n\nJune 6: Amanda Bynes Is Still Drunk\n\nY’all remember Amanda Bynes from that one post where i told you about her so drunk driving that she crashed into a fucking police car? When she was so fucking drunk she refused every kind of test they could throw up at her? Of course you don’t remember because you were so into the photos that you forgot how to read but i’m here to remind you.\n\nGuess what? She just went to fucking court drunk and i’m not even kidding because she pleaded innocent. After she hit a police car. And refused every drunk test that exists. The only logical explanation for her innocent plea is that she was so drunk her lawyer caught a contact buzz off her breath and oozed all the shit she wanted him to.\n\nGo ahead and think i’m kidding because i know you and that’s what you’re thinking but how else do you explain her tweeting Obama himself to have her arresting deputy fired? If that’s not drunk tweeting i don’t know what is, and trust me, i know what is.\n\nJune 6: Scout Willis is Stumbling in Amanda Bynes’ Footsteps\n\nThere seems to be a rash and not just the one that itches me late at night when it rains but one of minors getting arrested for underage drinking. For example “Boy” Scout Willis was popped like a cherry for underage drinking and identity theft because she had a fake ID (how much you wanna bet it was Michelle Rodriguez’s driver’s license she lost at some Tijuana strip club during a drunken lap dance for Rumer Willis?).\n\nAdding to that rash is minor starlettes pleading Not Guilty by Reason of Infamity, i.e. too almost famous to have a record for drinking crimes. i rest my case in point on my lap and will tell you that Scout “Jamboree” Willis pleaded innocent to her charges as well and told her Dad to Die Hard the court’s ass.\n\nDec 3, 2011 – May 9, 2012 Q: What’s the one thing a Miss America hates to blow? A: .19% on the BAC\n\nHere’s a Miss America i’m proud to have voted for. Rima Fakih (as in “Fakih, Fakih 10 dolla’) truly represents the intellectual cross section that is the U.S., especially how she gets pulled over drunk driving with an open bottle of French champagne and tries to get out of it by saying she’s Miss USA like it’s a real title and when that doesn’t work, she lies on Twitter about it by tweeting, “Wrong Rima Fakih” because the name ‘Rima Fakih’ is as common as … hmm, absolutely fuck all which is why i think she rocks and deserves to be Miss America. She reminds me a lot of some of the women i’ve dated in my life or at least dreamed of dating just like i dream of being with a Miss America so there you go, told you she was the right woman for the hand job.\n\nBTW, for those of you who haven’t given up on this post yet (and god bless you for your courage), she was sentenced to 6 months probation and 20 hours community service which might have something to do with pole dancing, i’m not sure. It would go a long way to explaining the shots of her pole dancing i got stuffed in my drawers at the bottom of this post.\n\nMay 15: Tori Vance is Driving in Rima’s Footsteps\n\nNot to be undone, Miss Teen Arizona 2010 (it was a very good year) decided to take it a step further by getting popped like a zit for DUI but this time, while only 18 years old. And just like that, the number one person in the world i wanna party with goes from Kirsten Dunst to Tori Vance.\n\nThe cops pulled her over for puling an illegal u-ey and suspected she was drinking so they arrested her ass and the rest of her too but especially her ass and she hit just over 0.08% on the BAC which is the minimum to win a free trip to booking central.\n\nThere’s lots more drawer shots down there, Yo, after the “Continue reading…” link.\n\nMay 7: Outfoxed\n\nDoes Matthew Fox have a drinking problem? He’s fucking married to a woman named “Margarita Raunch” (Margherita Ronch), people.\n\nMatthew Fox, dashing good guy hero figure of TV’s Lost, continued his downward spiral by getting popped for a DUI recently and that’s not even the most interesting thing he’s ben in deep, deep, trouble for, because this is the guy who nearly went to the pokey for punching a vagina. Punching. A. Vagina. He hit below the belt after he had one, basically. Hey, i punched twats when i was drinking, and i even punched assholes, but i never ever punched a vadge, ask any of the cunts i know.\n\nYou know what it is and you don’t so i’ll tell you, it’s the Get Lost curse. Y’all are pro’lly too young to remember but way back in 2005 i talked about how Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros got busted the same freaking night for DUI. If you’re keeping score and you know i am, that makes three Losers Losties and here’s a toast to my being around Evangeline Lilly before she either gets busted with “the others” or Foxy punches her in her Evadgealina.\n\nSo yeah, there are a lot more Foxy shots in my drawers with the rest of ’em.\n\nBar None Dregs\n\nHappy Father’s Day!\n\nThat Saint Pauly kid posted another couple of his What The Fuck?

You bring beer, break in, then rode the halls and reminisce on good memories that age like brandy, smooth and mellow and maybe a little better than when they were made. What’s nice is that the school’s been all remodeled and looks fucking great and you can’t believe all the high tech gadgets they got now that they didn’t have when you were a kid so you play with them a little bit and get all set to settle into a nice night that may generate a few memories of its own…until some asshole pulls the fire alarm and you have to run outside into the playground and you stumble around and get more drunk and bang your head on the monkey bars and puke on the swing while you’re swinging so that you swing into your vomit and it streaks your cheeks and stains your shirt and fills your lap and the night is cashed like a keg of warm beer gone stale. That’s sorta what Prometheus was like.\n\ni can tell you right off the bat that i gave this somebitch 3 shots because the first half of the movie was 4 shots and the second half was 2 shots and the average of that is too hard for me to calculate so i’ll just round up to 3.\n\nThe beginning was incredible. What’s-his-name the director…Ridley Scott, there you go, filmed Prometheus in 3D rather than just stapling 3D shit on top after and you can really really tell when you watch the opening scenes. The vistas and the valleys and the crags and shit look awesome and then, when you start noticing the planet scape of the outer space lands you realize he even made the cloud formations look unique and you start to appreciate just how far out there “Out There” is and you appreciate the whole other-worldly other world Scott created. Like Avatar on vodka spiked with anti-freeze. Truly wondrous.\n\nAfter half a movie of this, just when you think you can relax and enjoy the show, the film turns to shit without warning. There are so many “WTF?” moments that you’ll wonder where you’ve been transported and what happened to the movie you were just watching. Scott feels obligated to force feed you shots of the original Alien (female leads, schmarmy androids with an agenda…) which he thinks are tradition but in fact are just cliche and tired. It’s like he meticulously manicured a marvelous castle of mud and then, just when you started appreciating its true beauty, he pisses all over it and makes it crumble around you.\n\nWhat else do you want from me? Noomi Rapace makes the jump from the Swedish Girl With A Dragon Tattoo to US blockbusters a droitly or even two droitlies. She does a decent job here in her role as Sigourney Weaver wannabe except, as my wife Celeste E Hall pointed out, Noomi’s character Elizabeth Shaw is a wimpy scaredy pussy compared to Weaver’s Ripley (believe it or not) but that’s not Noomi’s fault, it’s Ridley’s for directing her into that corner.\n\nMichael Fassbender is the same. He does a great job doing that acting thing but his character is all WTF’ed and he ends up gloriously portraying Lost In Space‘s Robby the Robot. Plus i heard he’s a conceited prick in real life so i don’t like him anyway and it’s got nothing to do with his penis probably being bigger than mine.\n\nBasically, if you’re invested in the Alien series you’ll get your money’s worth from this one and there’s nothing i’ll be able to tell you that’ll convince you that it’s not as good as you think it is, but for the rest of us humans who don’t need to revisit space camp you should go and see something good instead.\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: 1½ Shots\n\nThe only sex scene is the buzz kill and that’s just how bad it is.\n\nThe closest thing we get to nudity is the Alien, who has one of those mouths that look like a vagina. Like in The Thing. Because male film directors are misogynists.\n\nSure, there’s Charlize Theron (36) but the only sex scene with her happens off screen and the only time she gets hot is when it’s cold and her uniform is tight. Trust me, she’s a lot sexier here in the Bar None than she ever was in this movie.\n\nThere are more drawer shots at the bottom. You hafta click on the link that says “Continue Reading…” down there ↓.\n\nThen there also was Noomi Rapace (32). She was the Swish (because everybody knows Swiss and Swedish is exactly the same fucking thing) actress who starred in Swish version of the Swish book The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. She showed a lot more skin than Charlize in this puppy, like that one shot i put at the top of this section that i called “Elizabeth Shaw Swaddled” in my notes.\n\ni got some drawer shots of her as well. Just scroll to the bottom and look for the button that says “Continue Reading…”\n\nFor those of you more into Predators than Mother Ships, here’s Michael Fassbender.\n\nPlus, i got some Bar None shots of him at the bottom, in my drawers.\n\nDrink: 2 Shots\n\nAlmost nothing but the fact that there was anything when this takes place in outer fucking space is already something.\n\nA vodka.

He wears normal clothes but wears them wrongly and he speaks the right words but emphasizes the wrong parts and gets them a little backwards in the syntax sometimes. He’s got all the right internal organs but they’re all mixed up except his heart because his heart’s in the right place. That’s what Moonrise Kingdom is like… normal and odd at the same time with its heart in just the right place.\n\nCutting to the chaser, i loved this movie and the more i think about it the more i love it which is a good sign because when i left the cinema i already liked it and now i can feel that warm love grow and spread like a puddle in my lap. Actually, i’m kind of relieved because i was super afraid i wouldn’t be cool enough to like Wes Anderson.\n\ni swear to god i tried like hell to appreciate The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. You shoulda seen me sitting there trying to like it so hard i hurt my brain because here was a quirky movie with Bill Fucking Murray and i love the quirk and the Bill and the Fucking but no matter how hard i tried, i felt the movie was an inside joke that i wasn’t “in” enough to get so i chalked up one in the Lost column and gave up.\n\nUntil…\n\nYou know what i really loved about Moonrise Kingdom? Everything. But mostly the story and the actors and the directing and the script and the sets. And the music. The music was in perfect off beat sync with the movie.\n\nTake the directing… The directing was amazing because it was done back in 1965 and i don’t know how he filmed the movie back in 1965 when it’s a recent movie. Maybe Wes Anderson really is an alien and did some kind of time travel stunt, i don’t know, but Moonrise Kingdom was like an Instagram postcard flipbook that worked like a charm.\n\nAnd the story? The story was this super innocent story that came directly from my childhood from before i knew how to swear and the best thing in the world were late afternoons when the sun stubbornly refused to set. Camping out, tree forts, grass stains, the smell of lighter fluid, skies so bright they were whitewashed with light and love, real love, first love that Wes Anderson films perfectly because there is nothing cliche in the romance here, just like there is nothing cliche at all about the first time you discover love because you feel like it’s a secret kingdom you discovered first.\n\nWhat about the acting? Forget about it. Bill Murray nails the role of the father by holding back but fraying his character’s fringes with insanity. Like he talks normal but acts crazy with his hair. His hair. He acts with his fucking hair and that’s all you need to know about Bill Murray. Frances McDormand works off him with ease and Ed Norton comes off super believable as the Scout Leader, which is amazing when you remember how he rocked Fight Club and rocks here too even if the roles are polar opposites. Nice range and suddenly Ed Norton is your favorite underrated actor.\n\nBut the real story here are the kids. Like the (then) 12-year-old actress Kara Hayward. Look her up on IMDb. What else has she done? Nothing. Wes picked her from the super talented teen actress farm and transplanted here here where we get to see her blossom. Then there’s Jared Gilman who also only has one acting credit, this movie, but that’s normal because he just came from the exact same planet as Wes Anderson. Jared not only is Sam, Jared is the movie like Jared was walking around being himself and not acting or anything and the movie happened around him and Anderson filmed it.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom may not be for everyone. Frat boys should save their money for keg beer and Piranha 3DDD. Stupid people may want to stay at home and watch Fox News. People without souls may not want to see this. But for those who love movies and those who love Love, Moonrise Kingdom is a sensitive poet’s forgotten dream.\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: 0 Shots\n\nSeriously? You came here expecting sex?\n\nThe closest we come is too innocent to be sexual even if the kids make out in their underwear and learn how to French kiss and she says “It feels hard,” and he, almost apologetically responds, “Do you mind?” and she doesn’t.\n\nDrink: 1 Shot\n\nNo big surprise that there wasn’t a whole lot of drinking going on in the Kingdom but we did get some passing references. Like in the above screen shot where Bill Murray is in his pajama bottoms with a bottle of wine and and a half drunk glass and an ax saying, “I’m going out to find a tree to chop.”\n\nThe other references are as follows:\n\nBM [Bill Murray] drinks wine @ dining room table while reading the paper\n\nEd N[orton] scoutmaster drinks brandy while doing day’s log\n\nBW [Bruce Willis] drinking beer out of a bottle while frying sausage offers a slug to the boy. Twice.\n\nRock & Roll: 0\n\nMore indie art folk than rock and roll but you don’t miss it.We get some really cool soundtrack stuff from some famous soundtrack guy called Alexandre Desplat whose music fits the movie really well. Plus we get the kids dancing on the beach to Françoise Hardy – Le temps de l’amour.\n\nhttps://pjensi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/franc3a7oise-hardy-le-temps-de-lamour.mp3\n\nBoring Technical Crap\n\nWritten by: Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola\n\nDirected by: Wes Anderson\n\nStarring\n\nKara Hayward – Suzy\n\nFrances McDormand – Laura Bishop\n\nTilda Swinton – Social Services\n\nJared Gilman – Sam\n\nBill Murray – Walt Bishop\n\nEdward Norton – Scout Master Ward\n\nBruce Willis – Captain Sharp\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 12-year-old you were is aching to take you to this.\n\nAl K Hall’s Drawers\n\nJust photos after this…\n\nContinue reading →"
