        "text": "Paranormal Activity 4 is a 2012 horror film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. It is the fourth installment in the Paranormal Activity franchise, and it follows the same found-footage format as its predecessors. The film is set in 2011, five years after the events of the second film. The story centers around a family living in Henderson, Nevada. The family consists of Alex (Kathryn Newton), a teenage girl; her parents, Doug (Stephen Dunham) and Holly (Alexondra Lee); and her younger brother, Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp).\n\nThe film begins with Alex filming a video diary for her boyfriend, Ben (Matt Shively). As she explains, their new neighbors, Katie (Katie Featherston) and her young son Robbie (Brady Allen), have just moved in across the street. Alex and Ben decide to start filming the strange occurrences that seem to be happening at the neighbors' house.\n\nAs the days go by, Alex and Ben witness more and more unusual events. Robbie, who was previously homeschooled, starts attending Alex's high school and becomes friends with Wyatt. Alex becomes increasingly disturbed by the strange relationship between Robbie and his mother, and she starts to suspect that something supernatural is happening in their home.\n\nAs the strange events escalate, Doug and Holly leave town for a few days to attend a wedding. Alex and Ben decide to use this opportunity to investigate the neighbors' house more closely. They set up cameras throughout the house, and they soon discover that Robbie is not who he seems to be.\n\nThe film builds up to a terrifying climax as the evil entity that has been haunting Robbie and Katie comes after Alex and her family. The final scene of the film leaves the viewers with a chilling cliffhanger, hinting at more terrifying events to come.\n\nParanormal Activity 4 is a worthy addition to the franchise. While it follows the same formula as its predecessors, it still manages to bring something new to the table. The introduction of the new family adds a fresh perspective to the story, and the use of social media and modern technology in the film is a clever and effective way to update the found-footage format for a younger audience.\n\nThe performances of the cast are also impressive. Kathryn Newton shines in the lead role, perfectly capturing the fear and anxiety of a teenage girl who is witnessing supernatural events. Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee also deliver strong performances as her concerned parents.\n\nOverall, Paranormal Activity 4 is a suspenseful and terrifying film that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a must-see for horror fans who enjoy being scared out of their wits by supernatural entities.\n\nParanormal Activity 4 is a 2012 horror movie with a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes. It has received mostly poor reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 4.6 and a MetaScore of 40."
