If you go into this silly, satirical comedy about pioneers traversing the Oregon Trail with low expectations, you just might leave with a side cramp from laughing so hard. This is especially true if you're OK with potty humor -- who knew dysentery could be so funny? Sketch comedy definitely has appeal for tweens and teens, but if you search for "sketch comedy movies," the results are almost exclusively adult-oriented. JK Studios -- the outfit behind Studio C, a BYUtv show that's built a reputation as a family-friendly alternative to SNL -- has found an audience by keeping the goofiness of sketch comedy and leaving out most of the iffy content.

The result, at least where Go West is concerned, is a largely worry-free comedy that will help drive home what many U.S. elementary schoolers learn in social studies. It may also enlighten viewers of all ages about the ridiculousness of some of the sexist attitudes of the time (of course, to get the humor of female shopkeeper "Robert" making comments about women's inadequacies, you need to understand that her statements are actually making fun of the institutional sexism that prevailed in that era). Ultimately, Go West proves to be a cinematic oxymoron: a smart dumb comedy.
