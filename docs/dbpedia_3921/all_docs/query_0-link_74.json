An Antique and Vintage shop just packed with trinkets, treasures and the unexpected. Itâ€™s every bit as offbeat and eclectic (maybe even more so ;-)) as we are and so much fun to visit. I could spend hours and still not take it all in.\n\nJoin me today for a pictorial tour that doesnâ€™t even begin to show you all there is to see at WEST.\n\nLocated in the heart of Fort Davis, at 411 State Street, on the corner of 4th Street, WEST (some might remember its previous incarnation across the street in J. Davis Emporium) is housed in a stone building as quaint and quirky as it is. The Shop is owned by Ann Warner.\n\nAnnâ€™s wares cover the whole range of vintage and antique goods. From art pieces like the Guadalupan Lady (pictured above) that cover an entire wall to furniture, glassware, china and pottery, jewelry, clothes and a myriad other items, each more interesting than the last.\n\nThe Shop is open Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Mondayâ€¦ Hours during the Summer are 10:00 am to 4:00 pm.\n\nEvery time I walk through the door at WEST, I fall in Love with something new (or Old). Check out the amazing collection of prints, paintings and photographs. And the objets dâ€™art as well, sticks and stones, glass and metal, with plants tucked here and there. Much of it is displayed on vintage furniture pieces or well-aged cabinets and counters.\n\nEye Candy everywhere you lookâ€¦"
