        "text": "Go West are a British pop group. The duo formed in 1982, with Peter Cox and Richard Drummie\n\nGo West quickly had a publishing deal and possessed a portastudio, but lacked a band or recording company. Peter and Richard decided, with support from John Glover, their manager, to find a musical producer, and record just two of their songs. The tracks We Close Our Eyes and Call Me found Go West developing a record deal with Chrysalis Records. The songwriting duo specialised in radio friendly, white soul sounds.\n\nThe band's debut single, We Close Our Eyes, was released in 1985 and managed to achieve the number 4 position on the UK charts and also managed to reach the top 10 in the US. The video for the song became an early favorite on MTV. This helped them to be voted the \"Best Newcomers\" at the 1986, BRIT Awards.\n\nLater in 1990, Go West scored a top 10 US hit with the song King of Wishful Thinking from the movie Pretty Woman. An instrumental version of the song's chorus is also alleged to be heard in the production logo for Gracie Films (seen at the end of The Simpsons).\n\nGo West website: www.gowest.org.uk\n\nRead More"
