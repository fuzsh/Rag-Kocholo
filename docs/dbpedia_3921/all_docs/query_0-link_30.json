        "text": "SDE exclusive with signed print now sold out!\n\nThe eponymous debut album of Go West will be reissued in May as a 4CD+DVD box set, featuring remastered audio and a host of bonus material, including previously unreleased demos and live performances.\n\nOriginally formed in 1982, Peter Cox and Richard Drummie signed to Chrysalis Records in 1984 on the strength of the demos of ‘We Close Our Eyes’ and ‘Call Me’. The former reached number five in the UK and was one of four top 30 hits from the 1985 album.\n\nChrysalis made the most of the band’s success by swiftly following up Go West with Bangs & Crashes, which is primarily a remix album, although it does contain a few live tracks as well.\n\nFor the new box set all the audio has been newly remastered by the original producer, Gary Stevenson, from the original production tapes. CD 1 is the album, CD 2 is a slightly expanded Bangs & Crashes, while CD 3 features 14 demos and rarities (including additional remixes). The fourth and final CD is a previously unreleased Live at Hammersmith Odeon gig from 21 November 1985.\n\nThe DVD contains all the promo videos for the singles from the album, Top of The Pops performances, and a complete previously unseen concert from Japan 1985.\n\nThe set is packaged in a large format 12″ x 12″ box set, very similar to the Ultravox Vienna deluxe set. The outer rigid card slipcase contains two 20-page large booklets featuring a track by track commentary from Peter and Richard, unseen photos, and a gatefold folio with the five discs. The album is also being reissued on crystal clear vinyl.\n\nBoth the 4CD+DVD box set and the clear vinyl are released on 6 May 2022 via Chrysalis."
