        "text": "I’m pleased to show you my latest quilt finish. This is the Go West quilt.\n\nI had a great time using Carolyn Friedlander’s Doe fabric to make this one. The line has a fun mix of low volume fabrics as well as some lovely saturated colours. I think that the sage green is my favourite so far this year.\n\nI originally called this pattern Kapow because it reminded me of the way explosions and punches are depicted in comic books (radiating zigzags). However the central motif and the Santa Fe feel of the quilt lead me to change it to Go West. *cue Pet Shop Boys (old school) or the Village People (older school)*.\n\nI asked Kelly Elliott (who unfortunately no longer offers quilting services) to quilt this one for me. Kelly used a large scale, geometric pattern of her own design. It’s hard to photograph it well because of the size, but it really suits the quilt, echoing the many angles.\n\nFor the back I used some 108″ yardage from Carolyn’s collection supplemented with some of the leftover bright colours.\n\nThe binding is the same navy as the centre motifs. I think it frames the quilt nicely.\n\nWant to make your own?\n\nPattern Details:\n\nPattern: Go West\n\nQuilt sizes: Baby mat: 48″ x 42″; Lap (seen here): 48″ x 63″; Twin: 64″ x 84″\n\nFabric – Carolyn Friedlander Doe\n\nQuilting: Kelly Elliott of The Quilt Machine\n\nShare or Pin for later:"
