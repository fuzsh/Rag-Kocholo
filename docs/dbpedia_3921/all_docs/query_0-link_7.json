Drumming by Kofi Agyei, Jakari Sherman and Jerel Williams.\n\nAbout The Migration Series\n\nThe Migration Series, by painter Jacob Lawrence, is jointly owned by The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. This epic 60 panel tempera painting series depicts the migration of thousands of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North between 1910-1930. Prior to 1910, 90 percent of African Americans lived in the south. Between 1910-1920, the African American population in the North increased 65 percent. It was a movement on an epic scale with an impact similar to the migration from southern and eastern Europe into northern U.S. cities decades earlier. Both migratory historical events are universal and shaped the cultural landscape of America.\n\nThe Migration was made possible through commissioning support from Washington Performing Arts, Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa, The Krannert Center for the Performing Arts at Illinois, Ordway Center for the Performing Arts and Meany Hall for the Performing Arts at the University of Washington.\n\nStep Afrika!’s 2017/2018 tour of The Migration was made possible in part through the generous support of the Eugene M. Lang Foundation.\n\nImages from Jacob Lawrence’s “The Migration Series” generously provided by The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC and the Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation, Seattle/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\n\nThis performance of Go West from The Migration: Reflections on Jacob Lawrence was recorded at The New Victory Theater in New York City on November 24, 2017, by Mamadou Niang, NextMedia.tv"
