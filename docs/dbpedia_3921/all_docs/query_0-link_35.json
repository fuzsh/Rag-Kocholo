        "text": "Español\n\nBy 1848 the United States had acquired official title to the contiguous land stretching westward to the Pacific, south to the Rio Grande, and north to the 49th parallel. The West had long been explored and settled, however, the opportunity for legitimate land ownership along with other historic events caused a greater number of people to travel. The religious persecution of the Mormons had led them to begin their migration westward by this time. The discovery of gold would soon draw thousands more across the country.\n\nThis transition from a \"wild\" western frontier into organized segments of a federal union is documented in photographs. Private citizens and Government officials took the recently developed camera on their western adventures to record nature's curious sights and the marks that they made on the landscape. It is indeed a wonder that so many photographs have survived the hardships of the western experience, because early negatives were made of large glass plates. Some of these photographs have found their way into the National Archives as record materials of several Federal bureaus and offices, such as the Bureaus of Land Management (Record Group 49), Indian Affairs (Record Group 75), Public Roads (Record Group 30), Weather (Record Group 27), Agricultural Economics (Record Group 83), and Reclamation (Record Group 115); the Fish and Wildlife Service (Record Group 22), the Geological Survey (Record Group 57), Boundary and Claims Commissions and Arbitrations (Record Group 76), Office of the Chief of Engineers (Record Group 77), the Forest Service (Record Group 95), and the Signal Corps (Record Group 111). Listed below is a selection of photographs from the records of these agencies within the holdings of the Still Picture Branch at the National Archives.\n\nWhile the records of Federal agencies continue to document changes on the face of western America and the efforts toward effecting some kind of progress, an arbitrary cutoff date of 1912 has been used. At that time Arizona, the last of the contiguous 48 United States, was admitted to the Union.\n\nThe captions in quotation marks are those of the photographer or the person who cared for the photographs before they came into the custody of the National Archives. Within quoted captions, bracketed material has been added by the compiler of this list. Information following quoted captions and all captions without quotes has been provided by the compiler. The name of the photographer together with the date of the item is given if available.\n\nIn addition, the listings are arranged by subject--such as transportation, Native American life, military life, and mining--and thereunder chronologically. An index appears at the end of the list. The index is arranged by State, the names of which usually are the same as their former territorial designations. Some entries appear under more than one State; others could not be indexed by State.\n\nTo inquire about images within this list, please see the contact information below for the Still Picture Branch. There are no known copyright restrictions for the photos listed here. Many photographs of the American West are not included in this list. Separate inquiries about them should be as specific as possible, including names, dates, places, and other details.\n\nThe research, selection, and arrangement in preparing this select list was done by Charlotte Palmer, who also wrote these introductory remarks in 1974. Additional updates to this introduction were made as recently as May 2021.\n\nContents\n\nContact Us\n\nInterpreters of the Western Experience\n\nSurveys and Expeditions\n\nPaths of Persistence\n\nSoldiering in the West\n\nLife from the Land\n\nLife by the Sea\n\nThe Scramble for Newly Opened Lands\n\nOld Institutions in New Surroundings\n\nCelebration of the American Spirit"
