        "text": "The Hairy Bikers are back and this time theyâre going West â meeting local food producers and trying the very best food these counties have to offer. All while taking a nostalgic trip down memory lane to places close to their hearts.\n\nThis seven-part series for BBC Two will see the boys reunite to travel down the west coast of the UK, starting in Scotland and ending in Devon, with Dave even making an emotional homecoming to the county he was born in.\n\nEach week Dave and Si will base themselves in stunning locations while exploring the changing areas through restaurants, recipes, and inventive new food entrepreneurs.\n\nThis is a food adventure that takes the bikers to regions where they first met and to places that have shaped them – but it isn’t all familiar territory.\n\nDave and Si travel through 10 glorious counties and cover over 600 miles on their quest to explore and reveal hidden gems in this stunning part of the world.\n\nThey begin their journey on the west coast of Scotland and journey through Lancashire, Merseyside, North Wales, Bristol, and finally Devon and Dorset.\n\nAlong the way they discover a host of inspiring local producers doing their bit to celebrate an area’s rich diversity, learn about the future of food production, and track down a new generation of young farmers driven by sustainability.\n\nThese visits inspire the boys to dish up a range of delicious recipes from a Chicken Balmoral with truffle mash and a poached lobster served with Scottish Bucatini pasta, to Lamb chop pakoras with traditional Persian rice and a Lancashire Butter and Potato Pie.\n\nThe series was commissioned by Catherine Catton, Head of Factual Entertainment and Events. The Commissioning Editor is Jasmyn McGuile. The Hairy Bikers Go West has been produced for BBC Two by South Shore.\n\nThe Executive Producers are Andrew Mackenzie and Melanie Leach and the Series Producer and Director is Francois Gandolfi. The series will Tx weekly from Tuesday 6 February at 7pm.\n\nEpisode one\n\nDave and Si are starting off their great adventure in Scotland, one of their favourite places in the whole world. It was on these Scottish roads that they first became best friends, and are now returning to one of the places that holds very special memories for them both, the Isle of Bute.\n\nFirst port of call is a local deli, run by Erin. There the Bikers discover it’s a ‘shop window’ of some of the best the island has to offer. After filling their baskets with local bread, fish, cheese and pies the Bikers enjoy a fabulous picnic while taking in the fantastic views.\n\nAfter lunch, the Bikers are back on the road and discover a patisserie owned and run by a Syrian family, who came to the island to escape their country’s war. They meet Maj, a young man who arrived on Bute when he was only 12 but is now creating the most delicious cakes and tarts.\n\nThe Bikers have been inspired to create a recipe based on their experience on the Bute so far. So they the hit the kitchen and cook a lamb Sfiha, a middle eastern flatbread topped with meat and spices, a nod to the Syrian flavours at the patisserie, together with a salad inspired by Bute Produce.\n\nAfter cooking up a storm in the kitchen, the Bikers hit the road, to discover an exciting project that aims to re-introduce truffles to the island. Locals Paul and Lindsay have planted an orchard of Oak and Hazel trees on Bute, and hope to grow truffles for local chefs to use. The visit has sparked Dave and Si’s imagination, and they plan to use truffles for a new recipe, but first they need something very traditional - haggis!\n\nThe Bikers drop in to see brothers David and Ronald, who inherited the last remaining butchers on the island from their father, Alistair. They use local produce and the boys are treated to a lesson in how to make award winning haggis. Then it’s back to the kitchen as Dave and Si create Chicken Balmoral, a chicken breast sliced, stuffed with haggis, wrapped in bacon and served with a rich cream pepper and whisky sauce. And with a nod to their new friend Paul and his puppy Roo, they pair it up with a truffle mash.\n\nFor their final dish, the boys create Salmon en croute, stuffed with watercress, spinach and cream cheese and served with a delicious dill sauce.\n\nPublicity contact: NS"
