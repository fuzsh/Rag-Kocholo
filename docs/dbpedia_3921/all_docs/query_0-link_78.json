        "text": "Pictured Rocks Cliffs\n\nColorful and bold, the Pictured Rocks cliffs tower 50 to 200 feet above Lake Superior. These sandstone cliffs stretch for about 15 miles along the lake from Sand Point on the west to just after Spray Falls on the east. The most colorful portion of the cliffs begins east of Miners Beach.\n\nThe name \"Pictured Rocks\" comes from streaks of mineral stain that decorate the face of the weather-sculpted sandstone. Stunning colors occur when groundwater oozes out of cracks and trickles down the rock face. Iron (red and orange), copper (blue and green), manganese (brown and black), and limonite (white) are among the most common color-producing minerals.\n\nThe best view of the cliffs is from the water. A National Park Service authorized concessionaire operates a non-stop boat tour of the Pictured Rocks cliffs from mid-May through mid-October.\n\nMiners Castle provides a view of the cliffs in the distance, looking eastward from the lower overlook. This stretch of cliffs can also be viewed from the west end of Miners Beach.\n\nSand Point\n\nLocated about 4 miles northeast of Munising, at the end of Sand Point Road.\n\nThe Sand Point beach is a popular spot for sunbathing or walking in the evening to watch the sun go down over Munising Bay. Swimmers often find the shallow bay water off Sand Point warmer than other lakeshore beaches. Leashed pets permitted on the beach and in the water.\n\nSand Point is the only location in the park with picnic tables on the beach. A wheelchair-accessible Mobi mat leading from the parking lot across the beach to the water's edge is installed every summer.\n\nSand Point is one of the few areas of the park easy to reach by regular vehicle in winter because the road is plowed. Parking for ice curtain viewing and climbing is at Sand Point.\n\nThe Sand Point Marsh Trail, a 0.5 mile wheelchair-accessible interpretive trail that traverses a beautiful wetland area, is a great place for birding. Watch for frogs, turtles, and even beavers along the trail. This is also a wonderful place to walk or snowshoe in winter. No pets allowed.\n\nPark headquarters is also located at the end of Sand Point. Artifacts from the era of the Munising U.S. Coast Guard Station are on display in the small nearby boathouse museum during the summer. There is no fee.\n\nMiners Castle\n\nLocated about 5 miles east of Munising on Alger County Road H-58, then 6 miles north on Miners Castle Road (H-11).\n\nMiners Castle is one of the most famous landmarks along the Pictured Rocks shoreline, and is the only cliff area in the park accessible by vehicle.\n\nFrom the parking lot, a short, paved wheelchair-accessible trail leads past interpretive exhibits to breathtaking overlooks of Lake Superior and Grand Island. Stairs and a steeper trail lead to the lower overlook adjacent to Miners Castle. Leashed pets are permitted on the paved (not dirt) trails, at overlooks, and in picnic area.\n\nErosion over long periods of time has created the interesting rock formations that give this place its name. A rockfall in 2006 dramatically changed the look of Miners Castle as one of its two turrets unexpectedly fell into the lake.\n\nTwelvemile Beach\n\nAs the name suggests, there is a long beach stretching 12 miles along the Lake Superior shoreline approximately in the middle of the park. Access Twelvemile Beach from the Lake Superior Overlook on Alger County Road H-58 or from the day-use, picnic area of Twelvemile Beach Campground, about 16 miles west of Grand Marais on H-58. Twelvemile Beach is a wonderful place for long walks along the shore, especially at sunset. Reminder: rock collecting is prohibited in the park.\n\nLeashed pets allowed on beach in front of and to the east of the campground. Pets are not allowed on the beach west of the campground.\n\nLog Slide\n\nNo pets allowed. Located at the end of Log Slide Road, about 7 miles west of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58. A short walk from the parking lot past historic logging equipment leads to the Log Slide area on top of the dunes.\n\nLegend has it that logs sent down the tall dunes on a dry log chute would generate enough friction to cause the chute to catch fire. Today the chute is gone, but the lumberjack stories still linger as you gaze out over the Grand Sable Banks to the east. Recent winter storms destroyed the popular overlook platform, but the path that leads to where the platform stood is still open. Be careful near steep edges! Be aware of poison ivy in the area.\n\nGrand Sable Banks and Dunes\n\nNo pets allowed. These enormous dunes left by glacial action are located at the eastern end of the park. Access into the dunes is limited. The 0.6 mile roundtrip Grand Sable Dunes Trail leads from the Sable Falls parking area (1 mile west of Grand Marais along Alger County Road H-58) through a forested dune environment to the top of open dunes. Be prepared to walk partly uphill in soft sand. Another access point with a steeper climb is from the small parking lot at the far eastern end of Grand Sable Lake on H-58.\n\nFive square miles of Grand Sable Dunes are perched atop the 300-foot high Grand Sable Banks. A portion of the Grand Sable Dunes is set aside as a Research Natural Area."
