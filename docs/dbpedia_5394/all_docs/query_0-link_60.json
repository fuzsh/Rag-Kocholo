        "text": "Population: 1,561,973 (Ethnologue)\n\nReligion: Christian (50%, 18% active Christian), Indigenous (50%)\n\nSome sources report percentage of Christian in the 60s\n\nThe Republic of Botswana is landlocked in south-central Africa, north of South Africa, with an area of about 232,000 sq. miles (600,000 sq. km) comparable to Texas, Kenya or France. A vast tableland, the average elevation is 3,300 ft (1000 meters). The Kalahari Desert spreads over southwest; the Okavango River Basin (swamplands) and Makgadikgadi Salt Pan in the north; and rolling plains in the east. Approximately 80% of the country is covered by Kgalagadi sands. The climate is semi-arid subtropical with frequent droughts and low food production. Primary occupations are stock raising (cattle and goats) and mining.\n\nBy 1800, the indigenous San (Bushmen) had retreated into the Kalahari region when the Tswana invaded from farther north and established their settlements in the more fertile east. There are now about 27 major people groups living in the country. Inter-tribal wars were followed by conflicts with the Boers (settlers of Dutch descent). In 1885 the Tswana received British assistance in the establishment of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. In 1965 a parliamentary government consisting of the National Assembly and the advisory House of Chiefs evolved. Complete independence as a republic came in 1966. Botswana has developed into Africa 's oldest and most prosperous democracy. Out of economic necessity, it has taken a nonaligned stance in foreign affairs.\n\nAbout 60% of the population are of some Tswana lineage, descended from the great Sotho-Tswana migrations of the mid-17th century. They crowded in on the San, who retreated into the desert areas. Later arrivals like the Hlubi, Ngwane, Phuting and Tlokwa came marauding and fighting. The Ndebele under Mzilikazi, wreaked havoc under pressure continually from raiding Zulu regiments. Large areas were depopulated, towns were set on fire and the Kwena virtually decimated. Eventually, the Ndebele decided to move towards what is now Zimbabwe. One group of Ndebele remaining came to speak a Sotho language, called Ndebele after their ethnic name, though the more well-known main group of the Ndebele still speak a Nguni language related to Zulu.\n\nThere are many very small people groups in Botswana, many of them San tribes numbering in the hundreds and wandering in isolated wastelands.\n\nChristian faith is well established in the south of the country, where the Tswana are now becoming secularized. sources report Christian adherents form 50% opf the population to figures in the 60s. Reports of active Christians are more in the range of 18% for the country. Christian sources in the coutnry indicate the actual reach of the gospel is limited to the citires and smaller population centres. Some like the Kalanga, are showing themselves responsive now as Christian ministry is now being conducted in their midst.\n\nBOTSWANA DEMOGRAPHY\n\nPopulation: (Ethnologue, 2005) 1,561,973\n\nArea: 231,804 sq. mi.
