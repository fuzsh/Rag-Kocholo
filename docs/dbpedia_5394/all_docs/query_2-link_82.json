        "text": "By Johanna Menzel\n\nA small bay in the crystal-clear sea, a romantic harbor, and sights from the Roman times which shine pastel-colored in the Croatian sun – you have arrived in Pula! The largest and oldest town on the Istrian peninsula is with good reason one of the most popular tourist destinations in Croatia. The port city bursts with life. No wonder that culture lovers, families and couples come here to enjoy the alleys and get a taste of the unique atmosphere. Pula combines holiday atmosphere, history and Croatian culture in such a perfect way; hence most holidaymakers have not been here for the first or last time. Its sheltered location and pleasant mild climate make the beginning of May to the end of October the ideal time to travel to Pula. Fly Aeolus has compiled you a bucket list with sightseeing spots and beaches you should not miss during your holidays in Pula.\n\nSightseeing during your holidays in Pula\n\nThe Amphitheater\n\nHard to miss and of great importance is the huge amphitheater, also known as the Arena of Pula. The ancient amphitheater is not only one of the most important landmarks in Pula, but it is also in the whole of Istria. It was built in the 1st century and is now the sixth largest arena in the world. As in the Colosseum of Rome, which was built at the same time, in Roman times and in the Middle Ages all kinds of battles were fought here. The Pula Arena is unique in its kind, as it has often been claimed that it is the “only remaining Roman amphitheater to have four side towers and with all three Roman architectural orders entirely preserved”. As a comparison, the famous Colosseum in Rome has had two-thirds of its original structure destroyed over the millennia.\n\nToday, the arena hosts numerous concerts and events. One of the biggest is said to be the ‘Pula Film Festival’, which was first launched in 1954. A real tourist magnet, which you should definitely visit once during your holidays in Pula.\n\nTemple of Augustus and Forum in Pula\n\nForum, the central square of the ancient and later medieval city of Pula, is located on the west side of the city. It was built in the 1st century BC in the designated square along with the buildings of the entire city administration. The forum in Pula also had two side temples besides the central one.\n\nOnly the Temple of Augustus has been completely preserved. It was used to build the town hall. Its impressive portico consists of six Corinthian columns of white stone blocks which are about 8 meters high. At the end of polytheistic antiquity, the temple became a church, then a grain silo and in the 19th century AD a museum. During the Second World War (1944) the building was bombed and severely damaged. The reconstruction lasted from 1945 to 1947 and today the temple is again a lapidarium (a place where stone (Latin: lapis) monuments and fragments of archaeological interest are exhibited).\n\nInside the Temple of Augustus there is a small exhibition where you can see ancient Roman stones, bronze statues and portrait busts. The entrance fee is only a few cents which equals to about 2-4 Kuna.\n\nVenetian Fortress (Pula Castle)\n\nThroughout its history Pula has been an important port for maritime traffic throughout the entire northern Adriatic. Therefore, during the times of the Venice Republic many fortresses were built on the territory of Pula, including a Venetian castle which was built on the highest hill of the city. Its task at that time was a defense one while today it is serving as a tourist attraction. The fortress was built in 1630 based on the sketches of the French architect Antoine de Ville. The ground plan of the fortress is quadrangular, and several polygonal bastions rise from the complex.\n\nToday the walls house the Istrian Historical Museum. The collection starts in the Middle Ages and includes objects from urban and maritime history, shipbuilding, economics, and the military. A total of 40,000 exhibits are on display here.\n\nTriumphal Arch of the Sergians\n\nThe 8-meter-high ancient triumphal arch is located in the pedestrian zone of Pula. It was built by the Sergii family in the years 29-27 BC and is therefore also called “Archs of the Sergii”. Salvia Postuma Sergia had this arch built at the family’s expense as a monument in honour of her three brothers who had died in the battle of Actium around 30 BC. The arch of the Sergii leaned against the former city gate “Porta Aurea”. Since it had gold-plated or gold-decorated arches, it was also called the “Golden Gate”.\n\nMost beautiful beaches in Pula\n\nPula has become one of the most popular seaside resorts in Croatia. And rightly so there are many different beaches here, from pebble and rocky beaches to beautifully arranged sunbathing areas. Most of the beach sections also offer water sports like jet skis or pedal boats. Many of the beaches near Pula have been awarded the Blue Flag.

The sides are rocky, with a medium height they are suitable for water jumps.\n\nHawaii Beach is one of the most popular beaches in Pula, especially among the younger population.

It is located below the hotel owning the same name. The beach is a rocky beach with some paved parts.

On its sides it is surrounded by authentic holm oak trees. Ambrela beach is very popular among the local population and guests.
