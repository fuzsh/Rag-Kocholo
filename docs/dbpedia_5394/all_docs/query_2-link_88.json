        "text": "Pula is one of the oldest cities in Istria, having been settled since the Bronze Age over 3,000 years ago. The Romans, capitalizing on Pula`s location on a safe harbor, quickly built the settlement into a cultural center called Pietas Julia. A number of beautifully-preserved Roman buildings survive and stand today amongst 20th and 21st-century buildings. The best-preserved Roman monument in Croatia, the Pula Arena, is located here. Finished in the year 68 AD, it could seat 23,000 spectators, and is considered one of the six largest surviving Roman amphitheaters left in the world. Other noteworthy sights include the Temple of Augustus, the Gate of Hercules, and the Arch of the Sergii. Other sights include the Austrian-era Fort Bourguignon, the hill settlement of Nesactium, and Aquarium Pula, the largest aquarium in Croatia.\n\nPula - Rijeka - Krk Island - Pag Island - Zadar (Self Drive)\n\n10 nights from $730*\n\nCroatia by car.
