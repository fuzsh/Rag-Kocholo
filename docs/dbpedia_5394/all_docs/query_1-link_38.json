These all support a huge variety of flora and fauna, and are some of the wildest places remaining on earth. In terms of amphibian diversity, Africa hosts all three orders, namely the Anura or Frogs (by far the highest in number and distribution with over 1150 species across the continent), the Gymnophiona or Caecilians with approximately 30 across central Africa and some of the islands on either side of the continent. There are just four species of Caudata or Salamanders, which occur in the northern-most part of the continent. #Africa #AfricanAmphibians #AfricanHerpetology #CelebrateAfrica #Frogs\n\nOnce upon a time, River Ethiope was trending as who get the River, very funny something. River Ethiope, is it Urhobos or Igbos that own it? For those that don't like plenty of information, both Urhobos & Igbos own the river, as a moving/flowing water has \"3 courses of life\" hence can't just be owned by a particular place. Let's do a little Geography here & there: A flowing water body normally has a source, its mainstay, and its discharge. Depending on the size of the water in question it can be owned by plenty of ethnic nations in different countries. Using R. Niger for example (before Park discovered it, as it was not existing before ). Igbos know it as oshimiri ·ªågbaru, so they own it, yet the river's source is in Guinea, passed Mali & Niger too & the places it passed, have a name for it. Before we continue the goal of every flowing water, is to discharge into a bigger water body. So, River Ethiope is owned by Igbos since the source is in ·ª§m·ª•aja, ·ª§kw·ª•ani. (people think that the special thing about this river is its purity & blue color, but actually, it's the source, most water has its sources underground through a crack beneath the earth or from a rock but this river comes out under the root of a big tree though rock fit still dey under the tree. Urhobos own it too, as it passed their land to join a bigger water body. #ethiope #ourstories #IgboUnification #IgboAmaka #riverethiope #saturday #tourism\n\nCamelpardalis is one of most beautiful and tallest mammal on land, identify from Arabic world xirapha which translates as one who walk swiftly.
