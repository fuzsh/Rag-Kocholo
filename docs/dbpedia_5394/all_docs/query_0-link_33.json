        "text": "LOCATION & GEOGRAPHY: Botswana is a landlocked country located in South Africa. It is bound by the Republic of South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west, Zambia to the north and Zimbabwe to the northeast. The country is a sand filled undulating plateau with an average altitude of 1,000 metres (3,280 feet) while south of the plateau the terrain consists of hilly bush and grasslands. The Kalahari Desert which is a sandy tract covered with thorn bush and grass, lies to the west of the plateau and in the extreme northwest lie the Makarikari Salt Pans as well as the Okavango Swamps which are a great inland delta while forests and dense bush surround the swamps. Around 50% of the delta is perennially flooded and the rest is seasonally flooded. The principal river is the Okavango which flows into and forms the Okavango Swamps. Major Cities (pop. est.); Gaborone 134,000, Francistown 65,000, Selebi-Pikwe 40,000 (1991). Land Use; forested 47%, pastures 45%, agricultural-cultivated 1%, other 7% (1993).\n\nMODERN HISTORY - WWII TO 1993: In 1959 a constitutional committee of the Joint Advisory Council was set up giving Black Africans more influence and the ability to formulate proposals for the creation of a legislative council and other changes. In 1960 these changes were accepted by Britain. During the 1960's the Republic of South Africa asked Britain several times to transfer the protectorate to South Africa, although Britain refused. The country's first general elections were held in 1965 and on September 30, 1966 Botswana was proclaimed an independent republic within the Commonwealth. From 1972 to 1975 there were significant strikes among miners and in 1976 Botswana adopted its own currency the Pula. In 1984 tensions rose with South Africa believing Botswana was providing bases for African National Congress (ANC) political and military activity. In 1986 the South African military invaded Gaborone killing 13 people. Relations between Botswana and South Africa have improved with the present dismantling of apartheid and in Nov. 1990 Pres. Quett Masire announced the seventh development plan (1991-1997) which called for a greater role of private enterprise. In Dec. 1990 the government reached an agreement with a US firm to establish a diamond cutting and polishing plant in Botswana while the Sua Pan soda ash project was completed in early 1991. During 1991 Botswana implemented a favorable investment code that attracted foreign investment, particularly from South Africa while the government also sought to diversify its economy from the traditional mainstay of diamond exports. On Jan. 14, 1992 some 250 US troops arrived in Gabarone to initiate a two-week training exercise with the 4,500-strong Botswana Defense Force. In March 1992, a scandal developed after the vice president and minister of local government and lands, Peter Mmusi as well as the minister of agriculture, Daniel Kwelagobe resigned after it was found that Mmusi had used his authority to ensure that Kwelagobe land that the local authority wished to use for other purposes. Festus Mogae succeeded Mmusi as vice president while the opposition parties reacted to the scandal by calling for early elections. In 1992 Botswana recorded its first budget deficit since 1982 which resulted in the government not implementing its promised public-sector wage increases. In 1993 human rights abuse allegations were made against the personnel of the Botswana Wildlife and National Parks Department over their handling of the Masarwa, a small nomadic group of the Kalahari. Since the mid-1980's they had been forcible relocated to \"Remote Area Settlements\" as a part of a plan to counteract the impact of drought conditions. Also during 1993, the economy again suffered a downturn in principal due to a drop in demand for export because of the worldwide recession."
