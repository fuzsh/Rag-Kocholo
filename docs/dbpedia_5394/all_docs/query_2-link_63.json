        "text": "Pula stands out as one of the most captivating towns in Istria. Situated along the northern coast of Croatia, it holds a storied past steeped in history and culture. The renowned Pula Arena stands as one of the finest preserved Roman amphitheaters globally, with visible remnants of its Roman, Venetian, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian influences adorning its charming old town.\n\nConveniently accessible from Italy and Slovenia, Pula often remains underrated among Croatia’s destinations. However, it serves as an excellent launching pad for exploring the picturesque region of Istria. To the north lie the Brijuni Islands National Park, while to the south awaits the Cape Kamenjak Natural Park, renowned for its pristine beaches. This makes Pula an ideal destination for both a brief visit and an extended stay spanning several days.\n\nWhat you will find in this guide to visiting Pula:\n\nBest Things to Do in Pula\n\nBest Things to Do Around Pula\n\nPula Curious Facts to Know Before You Go\n\nHow to get to Pula\n\nBest Things to Do in Pula\n\nPula Arena (Roman Amphitheater)\n\nThe Pula Arena is the iconic Roman amphitheater located right in the heart of Pula Old Town. For a moment you will feel like you are in Rome, as the resemblance to its big brother, the Colosseum, is astonishing.\n\nThe wonderful Pula Arena is located a short distance from the port and the main attractions of the city center and was built between 2 BC and 14 AD, under the emperor Augustus.\n\nThe oval-shaped structure is known simply as the “Arena” and was designed to host gladiator battles. It is built in limestone with four towers. It is 133 meters long, 105 meters wide and 32 meters high. It is able to accommodate 20,000 people and among the Roman amphitheaters, it is the sixth largest.\n\nToday it is mainly used for music concerts and film festivals. The Pula Arena is open to visitors, and in addition to being able to visit the arena itself, with its three tiers of steps, you can see the interesting museum located in the rooms that once housed the animals used in the fighting and which today exhibit a vast collection of ancient vases and equipment for the production of oil from the Roman era.\n\nDuring the summer season the Pula Arena hosts a large number of events, including the Spectacvla Antiqva, a show that is held once a week (only in the summer months) and during which dozens of figures in ancient Roman clothes compete in gladiator fights.\n\nPula Forum\n\nThe Pula Forum is the beautiful main square of Pula, a combination of buildings from the Roman era and beautiful palaces from different eras, among which the Town Hall, dating back to the 13th century, stands out.\n\nThe Pula Forum, albeit modified by the new constructions that took place between the 11th and 19th centuries, is the only Roman forum still preserved in Croatia and one of the few remaining in the world. Today, as in the past, it is the heart of the city, and often hosts concerts and events.\n\nThe beautiful cafe-lined square boasts some of the most significant buildings in the city, including the city administration palaces, the Renaissance Town Hall and the perfectly preserved Temple of August, dating from Roman times.\n\nTemple of Augustus\n\nRight on the main square, the Pula Forum, is the wonderful Temple of Augustus, built under the rule of Augustus between 2 BC and 14 AD, and dedicated to the emperor himself and the goddess Rome.\n\nThe temple was very well preserved until WWII, but was heavily damaged during the Allied bombing in 1944. It was immediately restored by the experts of the Superintendence of Fine Arts of Trieste, as Pola was still Italian (and was formally part of Italy until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1947).\n\nThe facade of the temple is made up of six Corinthian columns, four columns on the main front and two positioned laterally, and a beautiful front staircase. Inside there is an archaeological exhibition with an exhibition of ancient ceramics, stone and bronze sculptures.\n\nCathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nThe main church in Pula is the beautiful Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary located on the seafront below the castle hill, just a few steps from the marina.\n\nThe Cathedral of Pula dates back to the 4th century and still retains the original flooring, adorned with mosaics dating from the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nInside there is a precious altar that contains the relics of various saints from the third century, as well as the remains of Solomon, King of Hungary. Also here were found what are believed to be the relics of Thomas the Apostle, now preserved in Vienna.\n\nThe free-standing baroque-style bell tower dates back to the early 1700s and was built using stones taken from the Pula Arena. In fact, in those years the Pula Arena was considered nothing more than a quarry of building material for the town.\n\nMonastery and Church of St. Francis\n\nThe beautiful Monastery and Church of St. Francis (Crkva i samostan sv. Franjo) can be reached from the main pedestrian street of Pula starting from the Pula Forum with a short detour towards the castle hill.\n\nThis former Franciscan monastery was built in the early 1300s in the late Romanesque style, with Gothic elements and a structure designed in accordance with the rules issued in Narbonne in 1260.\n\nThe monastery features a beautiful cloister, a single-walled bell tower, a refectory, and a wing where the friars live. The monastery is famous for hosting some of the most valuable works of wooden Gothic sculpture in Istria, including the large gilded polyptych dating from the 15th century, located just above the main altar. Also noteworthy are the mosaics on the floors and walls.\n\nZerostrasse\n\nOne of the best things to do in Pula is a visit to Zerostrasse, a complex of underground tunnels built during WWI as anti-aircraft shelters.\n\nActually Pula was a major war port in the early 1900s, first for the Austro-Hungarians and then for the Italians, who built a dense network of fortifications and underground structures, tunnels, shelters, warehouses and arsenals that extend under the entire city center.\n\nThe tunnels were primarily designed to protect the population from enemy air attacks and to store weapons and ammunition. There are 4 entrances in different parts of the town which, through long tunnels, lead to a single central hall located right in the heart of the castle hill.\n\nOverall, the bomb shelters in Pula can accommodate up to 50,000 people, of which about 6000 in the fallout shelter located just below the castle.\n\nTo visit Zerostrasse you can access from one of its 4 entrances. The most popular is the one in Carrarina ul. 3, next to the castle, opposite the ancient Roman gate and near the Archaeological Museum. Inside there is also a photographic exhibition on the history of the city’s aviation.\n\nPula Castle (Kastel)\n\nThe city center of Pula is dominated by an old fortress located on a hill, 34 meters high, known simply as Kastel.\n\nThe fortress dates back to the 17th century and was built by the Venetians to defend the city from enemy attacks. Its mighty star-shaped walls are reinforced with watchtowers and cannon batteries.\n\nYou can visit the castle and the outer walls, from which you have a nice view of the city and the sea. Inside the fortress is the Istria Historical & Maritime Museum, which boasts an interesting exhibition on local history and culture, including a section dedicated to the history of the important Istrian shipyards.\n\nPula Market (Tržnica)\n\nPula Market (Tržnica) is one of the most underrated stops on a visit to the city, but it is a true hidden gem. This elegant early 20th century building, made of iron and glass, has hosted the municipal farmers’ market for over 100 years, as well as dozens of stalls selling meat, fresh fish, fruit, vegetables and local specialties.\n\nIn and around the market there are several good and cheap eateries, while in front of the market there are countless wooden stalls selling souvenirs and local products.\n\nGate of Hercules\n\nWalking along Carrarina ulica, squeezed between the two medieval towers at the foot of the castle, is the Gate of Hercules, a stone gate from the Roman era that was once one of the main entrances to the city.\n\nThe door is dedicated to the mythological hero Hercules, who is depicted on the vault next to several Latin inscriptions, including the names of Gaius Cassio Longinus and Lucio Calpurnio Pisone, the consuls who by order of the Roman Senate founded the Roman colony of Pola in 46 BC.\n\nArch of the Sergii\n\nThis Roman triumphal arch, located at the entrance to Pula Old Town, dates back to 27 BC and is also known as the Golden Gate.\n\nIt was built in honor of three brothers of the famous patrician family of the Sergii (gens Sergia) who fought in the famous Battle of Actium in France. The triumphal arch is well preserved, and you can see in relief a series of inscriptions, as well as garlands and horse-drawn chariots representing the battle.\n\nPartisan Memorial\n\nThe Partisan Memorial is a monument dedicated to the resistance partisans and the victims of fascist terrorism in Istria. It is located inside Tito’s Park, along the waterfront.\n\nIn the park there are many statues and busts, including that of Titus, as well as a bronze fountain representing the map of the city. Look for the statue of Ruža Petrović, a Croatian woman who was terribly tortured by Italian fascists during the Second World War, and whose eyes were gouged out because she was suspected of helping local partisans. Despite this, she continued to help the resistance until the end of the war.\n\nIstria Museum of Contemporary Art\n\nNear Tito’s Park is the Istria Museum of Contemporary Art. It exhibits works by the best local contemporary artists, as well as sections dedicated to the visual arts, including photography, video and graphics.\n\nThe collection also includes works by some international artists, mainly from the Balkans.\n\nLighting Giants\n\nIn the evening it is worth taking a walk to the old Uljanik Shipyard, a harbor area dating back to the mid-19th century (but still active, especially in the construction of super-luxury ships), located just south of Pula Old Town.\n\nAfter dark you can admire the show called Lighting Giants, a work of famous lighting designer Dean Skira with over 16,000 colored lights illuminating the harbor cranes for 15 minutes every hour.\n\nVerudela fortress and Pula Aquarium\n\nAbout 6 km south of the city center of Pula is the Verudela Peninsula, famous for its exclusive marina, luxurious resorts and some of the best beaches in Pula, including the famous Brioni beach.\n\nBut beyond the beaches, there are at least a couple of good reasons to come here, starting with the Verudela Fortress, built under the Austro-Hungarian rule in the early 1900s.\n\nThis imposing fort now houses the Pula Aquarium, the largest in Croatia. It boasts an extensive display of fish and reptiles and various species from the Mediterranean and around the world, including African turtles, jellyfish, pythons and caimans. Among the main attractions are the seahorse tank and the shark tank, located right at the entrance to the fortress.\n\nYou can get there by car or with a local bus. Take bus n. 2C at the Svetog Ivana stop to Verudela Okretište, from here it is a 500-meter walk to the entrance. You can check opening times and prices on the Pula Aquarium website.\n\nBest Things to Do Around Pula\n\nCape Kamenjak\n\nThe wild and almost uninhabited Kamenjak Peninsula is located just 10 km from the city center, in the southern tip of Istria, and is famous for the best beaches in Pula.\n\nThe beautiful landscape of Mediterranean scrub hides coves and pebbly and rocky beaches which lead to a beautiful crystal clear sea. You will be able to walk among plants and flowers, pine forests and miles of rocky paths along the sea.\n\nThere are various paths that you can take on foot or by bicycle. From the tip of the Kamenjak promontory you can enjoy a wonderful view of the island of Cres and Mount Velebit.\n\nKamenjak is easily accessible by car, but during the summer season admission by car is subject to charges. If you prefer, you can take bus no. 28 from the Svetog Ivana stop in Pula to Kamenjak (Premantura in Italian), which takes you to the entrance in 40 minutes.\n\nKamenjak is also famous for the dinosaur footprints that can be seen here, and for the dinosaur statues set up to entertain the kids.\n\nBrijuni National Park\n\nBrijuni National Park is an archipelago of 12 islands located off the coast of Pula. You can reach it from the port located in the village of Fažana, 10 km from Pula.\n\nYou can reach the port of Fažana by car or bus. Local bus 21 leaves from Pula Flavikevska stop and drops you off near the port, where you can catch the passenger ferry that will take you to Otok Veliki Brijun, the largest of the Brijuni Islands, in about 20 minutes.\n\nBrijuni National Park boasts some of the most beautiful pebble beaches in Pula, a crystal clear sea, kilometers of woods, gardens, golf courses and even a couple of hotels, such as the excellent Brijuni Hotel Istra, which is a good starting point for explore the island.\n\nOn the island, you will see the remains of ancient fortresses and churches, including the ruins of an ancient Roman villa from the 1st century and the picturesque church of St. Germain. In addition, the Safari Park is home to many African animals, such as Zebras and Elephants, and in the area you can see dinosaur footprints and even life-size statues of these ancient animals.\n\nThe many attractions of Brijuni National Park make it a good destination for the whole family.\n\nOtherwise you could visit the tiny and scenic island of Sveti Jerolim, which boasts beautiful beaches and a stunning emerald sea, which is also home to a large colony of dolphins. In summer you can book inexpensive boat trips from Pula to Sveti Jerolim.\n\nFort Bourguignon and Fort Punta Christo\n\nOver 30 fortresses were built under the Austro-Hungarian rule in the area around Pula, including the famous Kastel in the heart of Pula, Fort Kamenjak and the mighty Fort Bourguignon and Fort Punta Christo, located just south of the city center, halfway to the Kamenjak peninsula.\n\nFort Bourguignon (Tvrđava Bourguignon), also called Fort Monsival, is located in Verudela and dates back to the 19th century. Like all other fortresses in the area, it was built with the aim of protecting the city and its important arsenals.\n\nAt the entrance there is a drawbridge over a moat, protected by two cannons. It is normally closed to visitors, so you can only see the outside.\n\nWhile about 8 km north of Pula, you can see Fort Punta Christo, another large and well-preserved fortress, built in the same years as the others in the area.\n\nIt boasts a beautiful view of the bay of Pula and the Brijuni archipelago, making the fortress an excellent observation point and defense against enemies. After the Second World War, the fortress fell into disrepair. Today it is open occasionally for cultural events, exhibitions and concerts. Or, like many forts in the area, for parties.\n\nRovinj\n\nJust 40km from Pula you can visit Rovinj, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia and one of the most famous summer destinations on the coast.\n\nIts wonderful old town is located on a small peninsular promontory on the Adriatic Sea, dominated by the beautiful St. Euphemia Church. It is worth getting lost in the maze of narrow streets of the old town, stopping to eat some fish specialties in one of the many taverns, and taking a look at the interesting Rovinj City Museum dedicated to the history of the town and the ancient city gate, called Balbi Arch.\n\nPula Curious Facts to Know Before You Go\n\nPula is undoubtedly one of the most charming towns on the Istrian coast. The iconic Pula Arena is its most famous testimony to its glorious past as an important Roman colony, but the city is a unique blend of cultures and architectural styles from different eras.\n\nIn ancient times this region was inhabited by the Illyrians and the Istri, who had their capital here, called precisely Pola. Its name became Alba Julia under the Romans, and then went back to being called Pola or Pietas Iulia under the Octavian dynasty.\n\nLater Pula became an important Byzantine and Venetian city. The Venetian rule lasted until 1797, when Pula merged into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and later into the Austrian Empire (later Austro-Hungarian Empire), during which it became an important center of naval industries.\n\nFrom 1918 to 1943 Pula and Istria were part of the Kingdom of Italy. During WWII, after the Italian armistice of 1943, it was occupied by Nazi and Fascist troops. During the German occupation the city was the scene of the war of resistance led by the Yugoslav Partisans and supported by the allied bombing and which led to the tragic Foibe massacres against the local ethnic Italian population.\n\nAfter the end of WWII, Pula fell under Anglo-American control and became an exclave of the Italian area of ​​influence, until 1947, when it was definitively assigned to Yugoslavia and then to Croatia after the Croatian declaration of independence in 1991.\n\nHow to get to Pula\n\nHow to get to Pula by plane\n\nThe small Pula Airport is located 6 km from the city center, and mainly operates domestic flights to Zagreb, Split and Zadar.\n\nRight in front of the airport there is the bus stop for the Pula bus station, located about 1 km from Pula Old Town.\n\nHow to get to Pula by ship\n\nThere are fast ferries operated by the Venezia Lines company which in about 4 hours go to Pula from Venice (Italy).\n\nHow to get to Pula by bus\n\nThe Pula Bus Station, located about 1km north of the city center, is well connected to the main cities of Croatia, Slovenia and Northern Italy. There are buses to and from Rovinj, Rijeka, Zagreb, Zadar, and Split, as well as some buses operated by FLIXBUS for various European destinations.\n\nHow to get to Pula by car\n\nPula is easily reachable by car both from Italy and from the main cities of Croatia and Slovenia. Those coming from Italy, from Trieste for example, will have to cross Slovenian territory and then enter Croatia. From here you can continue on the A9 (E751) motorway (toll) or on the D21 road."
