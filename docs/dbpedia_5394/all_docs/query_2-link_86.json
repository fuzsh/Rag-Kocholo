        "text": "Marčana is a village and municipality settled north of Pula, on the intersection of Pula-Labin and Vodnjan-Krnica roads. Historical sources show evidence of the dense population of this area and the rather turbulent history during ancient times. Marčana was first mentioned in written sources in 1243 in Pula’s Oath of allegiance to Venice. At the time, Marčana was part of Pula and later came under the authority of the Republic of Venice in 1331. Since this area was affected by a plague outbreak on several occasions during the 15th century, Marčana and its surroundings lost almost all its inhabitants. Through the course of the next century, the Republic of Venice systematically populated the area by relocating refugees from Greece and Dalmatia, who were fleeing from the Ottomans.\n\nIn the centre of Marčana stands the astonishing 15-century parish church of St. Peter and Paul, with a bell tower dating back to 1846. Marčana is also famous for the medieval church of St. Anthony of Padua expanded in the late 16th century and was consecrated in 1709."
