        "text": "#worldpharmacistsday #kabarakuniversity #pharmacy I am more than honored to be part of this honorable body of Pharmacistsâ€™ and for the platform to have a career in this profession We had a very wholesome engagement this weekend; 23/09/2023 in our intervarsity network where University of Nairobi ,United States International University - Africa ,Kabarak University Mount Kenya University - MKU, Kenya Methodist University, Kisii University ,Kenyatta University ,Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology took part in various competitions and team building activities. We had a panel discussion with various pharmacistsâ€™ who have been in the profession for over 25years and they shed light on various aspects of pharmacy and how it has evolved over the years in Kenya. Some of the points discussed were: ðŸ’¡There are many gaps in the health care system especially with the rise in population and diseases. When there is leak in the healthcare system, it becomes corrupt and inconsistent in many ways and it is impotant to address this minor issues before they become major issues that cost individuals, families and nations a lot of irreprable damage. We need to treat the root cause of issues as opposed to putting band aids every now an then. That only hides the problem. It doesnâ€™t solve it. ðŸ’¡As pharmacists, our focus is to serve patients and we are critical in ensuring their lifestyle is improved based on how we handle them as we advise them on their regimen. Our focus should not be profit margins and sales of the day because then this beats our purpose. ðŸ’¡Pharmacy is diverse, dynamic and very flexible. In the near future, we will barely have pharmacists dispensing medicines in chemists and pharmacies. The question is :#whatcantapharmacistdo? not #whatcanapharmacistdo? We are needed in every sector there is; #Qualitycontrol and #qualityassurance, #regulatoryaffairs, #industry, #researchanddevelopment,#radiopharmacy,#hospitalpharmacy,#communitypharmacy,#procurement,#supplychainandmanagement,#pharmacovigilance,#pharmacogenomics just to mention some. Whatever institution you are in as a pharmacist, you have credible responsibilities. I am a passionate pharmacist! Loving this journey #vivalapharmacie #NUPSA #KePHSA #PSK"
