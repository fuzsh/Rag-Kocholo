        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nBrain hypoperfusion has been reported in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) animal models [1] and patients with AD [2]. The impaired function of the cerebrovascular system leads to brain hypoperfusion and accelerates brain tissue degeneration [3]. Interestingly, high levels of preactivated platelets have been reported in patients with AD [4], and platelet deposits have been shown in the neurovasculature of AD animal models and patients with AD [5]. Growing evidence suggests a role for platelets in the onset and progression of AD [6]. Platelets have been shown to contribute to neuroinflammatory responses [7], neuronal death [6], microthrombotic and ischemic brain complications [8], and cerebral amyloid deposition in AD experimental models and patients with AD [9].\n\nSeminal studies have suggested that circulating platelets express amyloid precursor protein (APP) but failed to convincingly prove the release of pathogenic amyloid β (Aβ) peptides by platelets in physiological or pathological conditions [[10], [11], [12]]. More recently, there have been reports regarding the ability of platelets to release Aβ peptides, although the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon remain poorly understood [[13], [14], [15]]. Taken together, there is sufficient evidence in the literature supporting a role for platelets as a potential source of Aβ peptides, but several questions remain regarding the events regulating the storage and release of Aβ peptides.\n\nIn this study, we have investigated this aspect of platelet biology. In our experiments, the release of Aβ peptides by platelets was induced by hemostatic agonists (ie, thrombin) or pathological stimuli associated with inflammation (ie, lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and was modulated by oxygen tension. Importantly, although previous studies reported the secretion of Aβ1-37 and Aβ1-40 peptides [12,13], here we show the release of the more fibrillogenic and pathogenic Aβ1-42. This article provides novel evidence of a potential exacerbating effect of inflammation and hypoxia on Aβ peptide release by platelets and potentially on amyloid plaque deposition. In view of our data, recent reports of protection from AD by antiplatelet drugs [16,17] may be explained as a consequence of the inhibitory effects of these drugs on platelet-dependent Aβ peptide release, which would ultimately reduce amyloid plaque deposition and slow down AD progression.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe release of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 by human platelets was studied using ELISA. In addition to low release of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 in resting conditions (<30 pg/mL), platelet stimulation by thrombin significantly increased the release of both Aβ peptides, with different kinetics. The release of Aβ1-42 was sustained for at least 120 minutes after stimulation ( A), whereas the release of Aβ1-40 displayed fast kinetics, peaking at 20 minutes after stimulation ( B). In addition, because the immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is expressed in platelets [18] and is involved in AD progression [19], the TLR4/CD14 agonist LPS was tested and displayed the ability to stimulate the release of Aβ1-42 ( A) and, to a lower extent, Aβ1-40 by platelets ( B). As previously shown [20], LPS triggered a moderate increase in P-selectin externalization without integrin activation and did not interfere with the stimulation of these 2 responses by thrombin (data not shown). Surprisingly, the pretreatment with LPS reduced the ability of thrombin to release Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 to levels similar to LPS alone (green line vs purple line in A, B).\n\nBecause of the low oxygen tension in the brain microvasculature blood [21] and the reduced neurovascular function that accompanies dementia [22], we assessed the effect of hypoxia on platelet release of Aβ peptides ( A, B). Interestingly, physiological hypoxia (ie, 2% O2 or 15 mm Hg) strongly potentiated the release of Aβ1-42 in response to the immune stimulus LPS ( A), whereas LPS-dependent release of Aβ1-40 and thrombin-dependent release of either Aβ1-42 or Aβ1-40 were reduced in hypoxic conditions ( B) compared with atmospheric oxygen (ie, 20% O2 or 150 mm Hg).\n\nTo clarify whether the release of Aβ peptides occurs as a consequence of de novo APP cleavage or a storage-and-release mechanism, we tested the effect of LY2886721, which selectively inhibits β-secretases (ie, the enzymes responsible for the amyloidogenic processing of APP to form Aβ peptides). Despite using a large excess of LY2886721 compared with the expected potency from published data in cellular assays (10 μM in our experiments compared with published IC50 values of <20 nM) [23], the release of neither Aβ1-42 nor Aβ1-40 by human platelets was affected ( A, B). Because β-secretases are essential for the generation of Aβ peptides in different cell types and cell-free systems [24,25], we suggest that Aβ peptides are already present in the platelets at the moment of the pharmacological treatment.\n\nImmunostaining of human platelets with antibodies selective for Aβ, P-selectin (α granule marker), CD63 (dense granule marker), and APP was used to understand the subcellular localization of Aβ ( A). Statistical analysis of the costaining revealed high levels of colocalization of Aβ with P-selectin, intermediate levels of colocalization with APP, and low levels of colocalization with CD63 ( B), which is compatible with Aβ storage in α granules. The intermediate levels of colocalization suggest the possibility of independent storage of APP and Aβ, with at least some α granules storing preferentially one or the other.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe expression of APP in human platelets has previously been suggested [10,11], and the release of Aβ peptides by platelets has been reported, albeit only partially described [[13], [14], [15]]. A solid study of the conditions and the cellular mechanisms leading to Aβ release by platelets is missing. Therefore, the relevance of platelet-driven Aβ secretion for the progression of AD has remained largely elusive.\n\nThe most recent and convincing study about this aspect of platelet biology suggested the release of Aβ1-40 in response to the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (ie, the receptor for thrombin) by a selective peptide [15]. On the contrary, we found clear evidence of platelet-dependent release of the more pathogenic form of the peptide upon, that is, Aβ1-42. Upon consideration, we found it difficult to support the view that Aβ1-40 is the main Aβ peptide released by platelets. In fact, the techniques used in the aforementioned study and similar previous studies [[13], [14], [15]] do not allow appropriate detection of Aβ1-42 and cannot distinguish between different Aβ peptides. Among the reasons for the underestimation of Aβ1-42 in biological fluids and platelet fractions, there may also be the inherent tendency of this peptide to precipitate and elude quantification in suspension. Our current study benefited from the use of isolated platelets, which eliminates the disturbance by plasma peptides for the detection of platelet-derived Aβ peptides. Moreover, we were able to use an ELISA approach specific for human Aβ detection that distinguishes between Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 and allows side-by-side quantification (ie, in the same samples) of the 2 peptides.\n\nWe found that Aβ release was low in the absence of an agonist and that the release of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 was significantly increased by stimulation of human platelets resuspended at physiological density. The release of Aβ1-42 was notably higher than that of Aβ1-40 (ie, ∼150 pg/mL for Aβ1-40 and ∼250 pg/mL for Aβ1-42). The higher level reached by Aβ1-42 seems to be due to the prolonged kinetics for the release of this peptide, which continues for at least 120 minutes after activation, rather than a higher release rate (which is similar between Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in the first 20 minutes after stimulation). This may imply a different mechanism of release for the 2 Aβ peptides, which is an unexpected and highly intriguing finding requiring further study.\n\nPlatelets are known responders to infection through the TLR4/CD14 immune complex [18]. Although there is no previous information regarding the effect of the TLR4/CD14 agonist LPS on platelet release of Aβ peptides, previous studies have reported the potentiation of platelet hemostatic responses by LPS [20,26]. In our experiments, the activation of TLR4/CD14 by LPS induced the release of Aβ peptides, albeit at a lower rate than that with thrombin. Our data suggest that platelets can release Aβ peptides independent of canonical hemostatic stimuli. Importantly, the release of Aβ1-42 peptides by LPS was significantly increased by hypoxia. Therefore, infection and inflammatory conditions may trigger platelet release of considerable amounts of pathogenic Aβ peptides if combined with hypoperfusion (which is a condition commonly associated with AD) [2,3]. Further research is required to ascertain the potential relevance of this observation for human health and especially for AD, for which infections [27,28] and/or inflammatory conditions [29] are recognized risk factors. Noticeably, there was no significant difference between the release of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 induced by LPS either alone or in the presence of thrombin. We can therefore hypothesize that LPS triggers a release mechanism that “overrules” the effect of thrombin. Further mechanistic studies are needed to test this hypothesis.\n\nOur negative data with the β-secretase inhibitor LY2886721 and the immunostaining results suggest that Aβ peptides exist in platelets in their cleaved form (ie, not only as part of APP). Although the possibility of unknown alternative proteases participating in the generation of Aβ peptides in platelets cannot be completely excluded at this point (eg, calpain [12]), it seems plausible that platelets already store β-secretase–dependent Aβ peptides at the time of isolation from blood. Aβ peptides colocalize with P-selectin but not CD63, suggesting their storage in α granules. Our costaining experiments showed consistent but incomplete colocalization of Aβ peptides and APP (Pearson r value, ≈0.5). This may suggest that different Aβ peptides are stored in different α granule subpopulations. The existence of different subpopulations of α granules characterized by different contents has been described previously [30]. The existence of subpopulations of α granules with different contents of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 peptides may also explain the difference in the kinetics and modulation of the release of these alternative forms of Aβ peptides. Further studies are required to confirm the possibility that APP and Aβ peptides are distributed in different α granules and determine whether there is a correlation between the distribution of these proteins with other cargo proteins of the α granules.\n\nTaken together, this research report presents a strong case for further investigations of the mechanisms of storage and release of Aβ peptides by platelets. These data may improve our understanding of AD and promote the discovery of a treatment to reduce or arrest its progression."
