        "text": "Pula is one of the largest cities in Croatia, located on the southern tip of Istrian peninsula as the main city of Istria region. The city is known for its buildings dating back to the days of the Roman Empire of which the most famous one is a well preserved Pula Arena. There are nearly 60 000 residents in Pula, making it the 8th biggest city in Croatia and its population density places it on the 5th place. The language spoken in Pula is Croatian, but due to its history it is not unusual to hear Italian language on the streets.\n\nFishing, along with shipbuilding and wine making makes a long tradition in Pula thanks to its position on the Adriatic coast and humid subtropical climate with the highest average temperatures of 24°C and lowest of 6°C. Summers in Pula are warm with slightly cooler evenings while winters are mild with a lot of humidity. The city has a very protected port where the sea is tame, however there are still two winds – bura which brings the cold from the north and clear weather, and maestral, a summer breeze blowing from the inland towards the sea.\n\nPula is a well-recognized tourist destination thanks to its rich history and culture, incredible beauty and amazing cuisine. If visiting Pula is on your schedule for this season, here are all the necessary information to help you plan your trip.\n\nGetting to Pula\n\nGetting to Pula by plane:\n\nIt is possible to get to Pula by plane since the city has its own airport. Pula Airport (PUY) is an international airport located in Liznjan, approximately 6 kilometers outside of the city. From the airport, it is easy to get to several small towns in Istria such as Medulin, Liznjan or Premantura, but the airport also serves as an alternative for certain parts of Slovenia and Italy. Pula Airport has one terminal offering flights to both domestic and international destinations. Among the airlines flying to Pula are Jet2, easyJet, British Airways, Ryanair, Lufthansa and more. As an alternative to get to Pula by plane, the nearest airport is in Rijeka, a little bit more than an hour and a half from Pula.\n\nGetting from Pula Airport to the city center can be done either by taking a taxi, which can be found outside the building next to the bus terminal, or by taking an airport bus which meets all the incoming passengers taking them to Pula, but there are also connections to Medulin, Verudela, Fazana or Rovinj. The airport is also connected via public bus line 23. Of course, if none of these options suit you, door-to-door private transfers can be pre-ordered, and those who prefer exploring the area on their own, can use some of the rent-a-car options.\n\nGetting to Pula by bus:\n\nMain Pula bus station is located less than 20 minute walk from the city center with numerous intercity and international routes. Pula is connected to Rovinj, Venice, Trieste, Rijeka and many more. Check the details of the suggested routes in the table below:\n\nGetting to Pula by train\n\nTrains in Croatia are operated by Croatian Railways (Hrvatske željeznice) which connect all major cities and towns, as well as most small towns and villages. Pula train station is located near the waterfront, with both domestic and international routes. There are daily trains to Zagreb and Ljubljana via Rijeka, also, the route connects Pula to Maribor and several other towns and places within Croatia. You can check the stations and departures here.\n\nGetting to Pula by ferry:\n\nPula port is located right in the center of town and all the catamarans are departing from there. Pula is connected to Croatian islands as well as with certain parts of Italy and Slovenia. Currently, there are 4 companies operating to and from Pula: TriesteLines, Venezia Lines, Catamaran Line d.o.o. and Adriatic Lines. During the season, especially in July and August, there are more routes than during the winter time with several departures per day. NOTE: There are no car ferries operating any route.\n\nHere is the list of ferries and catamarans departing from Pula harbour.\n\nVenice (IT) – Umag – Poreč – Rovinj – Pula\n\nPula – Venice\n\nCatamaran: Zadar – Silba – Ilovik – Mali Lošinj – Unije – Pula\n\nPula – Zadar\n\nPula – Unije\n\nPula – Mali Lošinj\n\nPula – Ilovik\n\nPula – Silba\n\nTrieste (IT) – Piran (SLO) – Porec – Rovinj – Pula\n\nPula – Trieste\n\nPula – Piran\n\nGetting to Pula by car:\n\nIf arriving with your private car, driving to Pula from Trieste or Koper lasts no more than 2 hours. If arriving from the direction of Zagreb, the ride using the highway lasts around 3 hours from the capital. In case of arrival from the South of Croatia, you can choose between the highway or the coastal road which lets you see the beauty of Adriatic coast and small towns on your way.\n\nIf you’ve decided for a car hire in Pula, almost all major international car rental companies, as well as a few local ones have their offices at Pula Airport. If you want to avoid queues and use the most out of your vacation, we recommend booking your car online.\n\nParking in Pula\n\nIt should not be a problem if looking for a designated parking lot since the city has many of them. Pulaparking d.o.o. is in charge of parking lots in Pula. There are 3 parking zones, and although it may look like the zones are intertwined, have in mind that Zone 3 is the most expensive one, while Zone 2 is the cheapest. SMS payment is available and you can find the information on parking machines located next to the parking lots. Looking for a free parking space can be a challenge but it is not impossible. Anyhow, always look for the parking signs and don’t park where it is forbidden because your vehicle will be towed and you will have to pay a fine to get it back.\n\nPula sights\n\nPula is widely known for its Roman ruins that have successfully survived for the last 2000 years. The city’s sights and monuments reveal its long history of Roman, later Venetian rule. If planning to visit this city, here are the most famous sights in Pula:\n\nPula Arena\n\nThe most recognized symbol of Pula and a ‘’must see’’ Pula attraction is Pula Arena, an entirely preserved Roman amphitheatre. It was constructed nearly 2000 years ago, and it is among 6 biggest surviving Roman arenas in the world. Of course, Pula Coliseum was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and besides being a great historical monument, it serves as a venue for many great concerts of various local and international artists.\n\nPula kastel\n\nSituated on a hill in the center of Pula, Kastel is a Venetian fortress built for the purpose of being the Venetian’s main stronghold in order to defend the harbour and maintain the control over the Adriatic. The fortress was built in the 17th century in the shape of a flower, and it is definitely among the things to see in Pula. Tourists can climb the walls and explore its cannons and a watchtower. Today, Pula fort contains Historical Museum of Istria which displays a collection of more than 75000 objects of cultural, historical, political, military and ethnographic significance.\n\nPula Forum\n\nForum is the main square in the center of Pula, a very popular gathering spot for both locals and tourists. Also, the square is a place where many concerts and other events take place. Forum is the ultimate representation of Roman influence, also surrounded by splendid Roman monuments.\n\nTemple of Augustus\n\nRoman ruins simply prevail in the center of Pula, and one worth the attention lies right on the Forum. Temple of Augustus is a well-preserved temple dedicated to Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The temple was built during the reign of Augustus over 2 000 years ago. After Romans embraced Christianity, the temple was converted into a church. In the 19th century, it turned into its present role of lapidarium.\n\nAquarium Pula\n\nThose interested in animal life can spend hours in the only zoo in Pula, Aquarium, housing hundreds of fish species from the northern and southern parts of Adriatic, as well as several species from the Croatian rivers and lakes. The aquarium is located in a 130 years old fort Verudela, a former defense complex of Austro-Hungary, a part of Pula fortress.\n\nBeaches in Pula\n\nAs the largest and most popular city on the peninsula, Pula also has its share of beaches which attract visitors every summer. Thanks to the mild climate, the sea temperature can reach 28°C in August, while in winter months it rarely goes below 9°C. Therefore, Pula is among favorite Croatian summer destinations.
