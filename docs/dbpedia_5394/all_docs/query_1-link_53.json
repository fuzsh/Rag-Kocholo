        "text": "This weekend we went to Hope Valley for our training weekend. The weekend was designed to prepare us for the trip in summer, allowing us to try cooking for and organising ourselves, testing our kit and building more of a team. Although the weather was not idea l, rain for the majority of the weekend and what felt like gale force winds on one evening, it was a great weekend that from my perspective really brought us together as a team and has made me even more excited for our trip in the Summer to Zambia and Botswana.\n\nHaving spent 5 hours on a coach to get to the Peak District we were immediately tasked with putting up our own tents in the last few minutes of daylight. An easy task for some. However none of the inhabitants of our tent had ever put one up ourselves, so we enlisted one of our more experienced team members to help us and about half an hour and a few bruises from tent poles later our tent was up and looking inviting.\n\nOne of the tasks throughout the weekend was cooking for 19 people, something that I think w e managed very well. We had a budget of £6 per person for the weekend so our elected shoppers came back with a variety of reasonably lightweight food and goodies seeing as we would have to carry the food around with us. Throughout the weekend we had meals like porridge, pitta breads and different varieties of a stir fry. We cooked everything ourselves using six trangias and washed them all up afterwards, not the most inviting task as the heavens opened and the wind started to pick up, although we did have the luxury of some sinks near the toilets just a short walk away. We all let out a sigh of relief when we saw the toilets with running water.\n\nThe trek was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting it to be either. We took our small bags out into the wilderness of the Hope Valley. It was spitting as we left so we all made sure that we layered up with fleeces and waterproofs which was good because later on the rain and wind really started to pick up, to the point where I was almost blown over by the wind at the bottom of the valley, not even at the summit. The trek was an opportunity for all of us to try out our kit like our boots, rucksacks and clothes and it was a good thing we did because I found out a bit too late into the trip that my boots aren’t waterproof anymore, so I suffered the pain of cold, wet feet for a large portion of the trip. At least now I know what to do before we leave for Zambia and Botswana! Although, it shouldn’t rain while we are away in Africa seeing as the average rainfall for Zambia and Botswana in July is 0mm.\n\nYou’ll be pleased to know that all 19 of us reached the top of Mam Tor, the top of the valley, where we were rewarded for sliding around the muddy uphill paths with an incredible view. I will admit now that I have stolen the picture off google images because all of our pictures were obscured with rain and clouds. Bearing in mind the trek was one of the parts of the expedition in summer that I was worried about, although it was only a small taste of what we will be doing in country, the trek this weekend really put me at ease about carrying my pack around Zambia and Botswana because even with the rain, the trek was one of the highlights of the trip.\n\nRegarding general camping life, I can’t say I’m excited about spending 3 weeks sleeping in a tent. All of the team agreed that we didn’t sleep very well at all on either of the nights, although there were different reasons for this. My lack of sleep was due to the near freezing conditions and rock hard ground which was barely helped by my roll mat. An important lesson that I have learnt from this experience is that layers will be my best friend while we are in Africa, where at night the temperature can drop to as low as 9°C, only about six degrees warmer than the temperatures that we experienced in the Peak District. After two days back at home I am already appreciating my bed and central heating more, so I can’t imagine what it will be like returning from Africa after three weeks.\n\nAt various points throughout the trip, our team leader took some time to go over the basic first aid we would need to know when we are in country, which for me was very interesting seeing as I had not done much first aid before. We learnt about the first responses to a first aid situation like clearing the airway and checking their pulse as well as the best ways to transport someone with an injury such as a broken leg or a damaged ankle. It also showed that it is actually very hard to move someone, no matter how easy people make it look on TV and in films! Hopefully it won’t be knowledge that we have to use while we are away but nonetheless it is worth knowing, especially if any of us want to go and travel ourselves after this trip.\n\nDespite the weather this weekend has been fantastic. Not only was it an opportunity to spend some more time with my team mates but it also made me feel less anxious about the trip to Africa in the Summer and converted the anxiety into excitement. The weather in general will be better and if the views in England were this good, imagine what they will be like in sunny Africa!\n\nWe’re back to a bit more information about Zambia and Botswana in the nest post where I will be talking a bit more about the culture of the locals, like their history, holidays and celebrations.\n\nI would also like to say thank you very much to Working Solutions Consultants for sponsoring me, it’s getting close to the actual trip now and it’s making me even more grateful for all the generosity of all of my sponsors.\n\nThis post will follow a similar structure to the last one as an overview and comparison between Zambia and Botswana’s economies and politics.\n\nAs both economics and politics encompass lots of different areas, I wouldn’t be able to list all of the relevant facts about the two countries so I have tried to select the most interesting ones. If you are interested in finding out more then this website goes into much more detail:\n\nhttp://www.indexmundi.com/factbook/compare/zambia.botswana/economy\n\nTo start off I’ll give a brief overview of both of the governments of Zambia and Botswana.\n\nBoth countries are members of the commonwealth and became independent from the UK within two years of each other, Zambia in 1964 and Botswana in 1966. Zambia and Botswana also changed their names with this independence, from Northern Rhodesia and Bechuanaland respectively.\n\nHaving become independent from the UK and its monarchy, both Zambia and Botswana have become constitutional republics, where a President is voted in every 5 years and they then choose their own Vice President. Similar to here in the UK, people can vote once they are 18 years old.\n\nBotswana , one of Africa’s most stable countries, is the continent’s longest continuous multi-party democracy. It is relatively free of corruption and has a good human rights record. Botswana’s president is Lieutenant General Seretse Khama (known as Ian Khama). He served as Vice-President of Botswana from 1998 to 2008 before taking office as President on 1st April 2008.\n\nZambia also has a reputation for political stability and a relatively open government. Michael Chilufya Sata was the fifth President of Zambia, from 23 September 2011 until his death in London in late October 2014 at the age of 77. The Vice President Guy Scott was named acting president until the new president was elected in January 2015. The new president is now Edgar Lungu, who was the Minister of Justice and Defence under Michael Sata throughout his presidency.\n\nAlthough the government and politics of the two countries looks fairly similar, their economies are very different. At $16,400 the GDP per capita of Botswana is almost ten times the GDP per capita of Zambia, at just $1,800(2013 figures). By way of a comparison, the GDP per head in 2013 for the UK was $37,000 whilst that of the US was $53,000.\n\nThe currency in Botswana is the Pula (BWP) which is subdivided into 100 Thebe. Pula literally means “rain” in Setswana, because rain is very scarce in Botswana, but can also be used to mean “blessing”. At today’s rates I would get 15 pula for each pound I exchanged.\n\nBotswana has maintained one of the world’s highest economic growth rates since independence in 1966. This is largely due to the fact that it is the world’s largest producer of diamonds, which makes up approximately one third of the Government’s revenue. Diamonds, along with copper and textiles, are some of Botswana’s major exports. However it is expected that diamond production will level off within the next two decades so the future for Botswana’s economy is not certain at the moment. This impact has already been experienced during the 2008 recession, when the demand for diamonds fell dramatically. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently the second highest in the world and is also a large threat to the further development of Botswana’s economy.\n\nThe currency in Zambia is the Kwacha (ZMW) which is subdivided into 100 Ngwee. The name kwacha was derived from the Bemba word meaning dawn, reflecting the Zambian national motto: “New Dawn of Freedom.” At today’s rates I would get 11 kwacha for each pound I exchanged.\n\nZambia’s economy has also grown in recent years, with the GDP growing by more than 6% per year. China has invested heavily in Zambia over the past 10 years, creating jobs and new infrastructure, with census data showing that currently there are about 100,000 Chinese people living in Zambia. Although Zambia’s economy does not benefit from the diamond industry it is the largest producer of copper in the African continent. In addition to copper it also exports tobacco and cobalt; however these are worth less than diamonds in today’s international markets. Although Zambia has a lower GDP than Botswana, surprisingly its unemployment rate fell dramatically from 50% in 2000 to 15% in 2008, and is now less than that of Botswana which has risen from 7.5% in 2007 to 17.3% in 2009.\n\nDespite a strong economy, poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia, made worse by high birth and death rates and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.\n\nMy next post will be a bit of a change from the last few, as I will be summarising our training weekend to the Peak District where we first get to try out our kit, trekking and cooking for ourselves in the lovely English weather we are experiencing at the moment. (Hopefully it will be more pleasant for the actual trip to Zambia and Botswana!)\n\nI have structured this post as a comparison of key statistics between Zambia and Botswana on topics such as the life expectancy, the general geography, and population. Where I can I have put the information into graphs to make it easier to contrast the two countries.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview of where Zambia and Botswana are. They are both landlocked countries in southern Africa and both share their borders with Namibia and Zimbabwe. The tropic of Capricorn also runs through central Botswana. The capital of Zambia is Lusaka and Botswana’s capital is Gaborone, both of which are shown on the map. While Zambia occupies approximately 750,000sqkm of land, Botswana only occupies 580,000sq km.\n\nThe populations of the two countries also differ, Zambia’s population is almost 7 times the population of Botswana at 14,638,505 in comparison with 2,155,784. To put Botswana’s population into perspective, the population of the entire country is just over a quarter of the size of London. The population is Zambia is also growing at a higher rate than Botswana at 2.88% as a result of a higher birth rate than death rate while in Botswana the population growth is lower at 1.26%.\n\nWhen compared to the UK where our population is approximately 64,000,000, we have around 4.5 times the population of Zambia, yet we live in an area that is 3 times smaller. Put simply, in the UK there are 263 people living in every sq km whereas in Zambia, the bigger and more populous of the two African countries, only 18 people live in each sq km.\n\nWhile 79% of us in the UK live in cities, both Zambia and Botswana have more rural populations. 39% of Zambians and 61% of Batswana live in a city, making Botswana the more urbanised of the two countries.\n\nIn most age groups, there are more men than women in both countries but the ratio of men to women drops over the age of 65 in both countries, showing that the female life expectancy in both Zambia and Botswana is higher than the male life expectancy.\n\nMale: Female Ratio\n\nZambia Botswana At Birth 1.03 1.03 0-14 years 1.01 1.04 15-24 years 1.00 0.99 25-54 years 1.02 1.12 55-64 years 1.00 1.03 65 years + 0.75 0.67 Total Population 1.00 1.02\n\nThe overall life expectancy in Botswana is higher than that of Zambia by 7 years, 61 years in comparison with 52 years. Although this is still 20 years less than in the UK, where we expect to live to the ripe old age of 81. The age at which people consider their freedom to end, well when they have children at least, is also much lower in both Zambia and Botswana than here in England. If I lived in either of these two countries I would be expecting to have my first child in two years. Luckily I live in England so I have, on average, 10 more years to prepare. I would also be having a lot more children if I lived In Zambia, where the fertility rate is on average 5.76 children per woman. Botswana’s seems a bit more reasonable to me, 2.3 children per woman, as this is not dissimilar to current level of 1.9 in the UK.\n\nI have only mentioned a handful of statistics that I found online while researching so if you were interested in finding out about Zambia and Botswana in more detail, there is a much more in depth comparison here: http://www.indexmundi.com/factbook/compare/zambia.botswana\n\nThe next post will focus more on the economics and the politics of Zambia and Botswana."
