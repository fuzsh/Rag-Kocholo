        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 60. No. 3 (HR) March 2023\n\nThe Cancelation of the Turbo Folk Concert in Pula: Origins and Public Response\n\nSummary\n\nThis article will discuss the recent case that included the cancelation of the turbo folk concert that was about to happen in Pula, Istria County. The concert was first canceled by the city mayor on the accounts of Pula’s pro-European and progressive orientation, probably meaning that music and performers who were supposed to play are considered somewhat else, and second by the Commercial Court in Pazin. The case included a public feud between the mayor and the director of Hiljadarka company, the concert’s organizer. Eventually, it was transferred to Osijek, a city in Eastern Croatia where, apparently, decision-makers should have a higher tolerance to such music.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTurbo-folk music has always been a subject of debate in the recent history of Croatia: while some parts of the country’s population deny such music and claim that it should not receive any attention either from young people or any other age or social group, other parts are transparent enough to openly say that there is nothing wrong with turbo-folk as long as it produces positive emotions among people. In late February, the news broke in the Croatian media that one such concert that was about to happen in Pula, Istria County, was canceled due to the decision of the city’s mayor Filip Zoričić. The concert was supposed to include the performance of several singers: Duško Kuliš, Dragan Kojić, Ana Bekuta, and Zoran Mićanović, in the Mate Parlov Sport Centre, a multi-purpose sports arena that was already leased by the concert’s organizer, Hiljadarka company. Eventually, the Commercial Court in Pazin, which has jurisdiction over Istria County, banned the concert; however, not on the accounts of the music, but unfulfilled prerequisites to hold such an event. Needless to say, the situation brought the interest of the public and social commentators, creating two camps with those who are against such bans and those who supported the decision of the mayor and the Court.\n\nThe Two Sides of the Story on Concert’s Cancelation\n\nWhen explaining why he decided to cancel the concert just a month before its designated date, the mayor of Pula, Filip Zoričić, claimed the following: “…I think that this musical expression does not belong to our climate, spirit and mentality of the city […] It is my duty to be open to everyone, and in the public space, while I am the mayor, we will promote and preserve the identity of civic, European and Mediterranean Pula, with all its rich multicultural and multi-ethnic values”[1]. As a response to his claims, the representatives of the concert organizer, Hiljadarka company, also issued a statement, underlining that the space in the Mate Parlov Sport Centre was agreed back in October 2022, with all the preparations already in place, including the payment of the venue and signed agreements with performers. However, in the attempt to shed light on the background of the mayor’s decision, the director of Hiljadarka Mario Cindori said that he eventually called the mayor who answered the phone intoxicated by heavy drinks and was using foul words directed at Cindori and all those who are listening to such music. Of course, mayor Zoričić denied all of this, mostly that he was under the influence of alcohol and that he was using profanity of any kind, but said that the discussion with Cindori was indeed heated[2]. Nevertheless, even if one looks at the official statement of the mayor, it seems somewhat misplaced and contradictory that a city, with all its multicultural and multi-ethnic values, did not find a place or venue for music of different kinds, most of all, taking into consideration that young people from all corners of Croatia are exposed to turbo folk music.\n\nThe Reaction of Politics and Social Commentators\n\nThe incident brought the attention of high politics and media, with one of the most popular evening information programs, Otvoreno (Croatian translation), dealing with this very topic. But the political and social commentators were more engaged with the “policy” of cancelation in a country and society that likes to think of itself as progressive and liberal, especially now after it has fully integrated into the European Union (EU) structures; therefore, the question was what could be next in line and how far one can go in abandoning or negating different points of view, be that in culture, music, or any other sphere of life. President Zoran Milanović, always vocal about various phenomena and ready to take the floor when asked, also gave his opinion about the matter, claiming that he does not prefer such music, but at the same time, would not go that far and cancel the concert in Pula; first, due to his negative stance on banning such manifestations; second, due to the fact that turbo folk music obviously enjoys popularity in Croatia[3]. Furthermore, a well-known social scientist and commentator, Boris Jokić, underlined that the decision of the Pula mayor can only provoke a countereffect with young people, who will start listening to turbo folk music or support the decision to hold such concerts just to oppose something which is imposed to them by higher authorities. Additionally, Jokić said that turbo folk music, in its origin, is a mixture of different other sounds and musical styles that come from various parts of the world; thus, it should be considered a global phenomenon[4], contrary to the belief of mayor Zoričić who has denied it due to the multiethnic and multi-cultural character of Pula.\n\nThe Position of Young People in Croatia\n\nWhat is important here is the fact that, as Jokić argued, such situations are often put in public to distract the citizens from some other, bigger concerns that are happening in Croatia. Not necessarily from the issues in the sphere of politics, but since this is an article in the field of social affairs, this incident can be seen as a spin that diverts attention from the issues that young people in the country are facing. For example, Croatia does not have a strategy or program for addressing the needs of young people, which is envisaged as a document that offers recommendations and guidelines for public institutions and decision-makers on how to contribute to the capacity building of young people. The last such document included the period from 2014 to 2017; therefore, for the last five years, the country has been without any program that would regulate the position of those who are supposed to spearhead Croatia’s progress in the future. Unfortunately, with the country’s integration with the EU structures and by the virtue of using EU programs such as Erasmus+, it also appears as if the destiny of young people is left to supranational institutions, while decision-makers in the country are more concerned with the examples such as the one that was discussed in this article in which young people are utilized by some to show how they can be corrupted by listening to particular kind of music. While the music definitely is important, it hardly makes the distinction between those who are considered good and those whose character is considered corrupted.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, one could think that an incident such as the one in Pula could happen some 10 or even more years ago; however, it turns out that even those coming from progressive parts of the country will use restrictive measures when they think it is necessary. As mentioned before, the case had an epilogue in court where the decision to ban the concert was confirmed, with the venue being transferred to Osijek by the concert’s organizer, which is a city in Eastern Croatia, a part of the country that is often considered least developed. This already brings new questions as to what such geographical division can mean and does it carry some implications for the people living in these parts of the country. Regardless of that, it seems that Croatia still has some miles to run to catch up with the values that the EU is promoting.\n\n[1] Matijević, Božena. 2023.
