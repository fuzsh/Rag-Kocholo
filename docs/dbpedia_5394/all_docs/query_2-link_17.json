        "text": "Istria, triangular peninsula that is part of Croatia and Slovenia. It extends into the northeastern Adriatic Sea between the Gulf of Venice (west) and the Gulf of Kvarner (east). The peninsula has an area of 1,220 square miles (3,160 square km). The northern portion is part of Slovenia, while the central and southern parts belong to Croatia. A tiny strip of coast at its northwestern base is the site of Trieste and belongs to Italy.\n\nIstria’s highly indented shoreline, 267 miles (430 km) in length, exhibits numerous drowned valleys. The west coast has a score of small offshore island groups, the most notable being Brioni (Brijuni). The terrain basically consists of a limestone plateau, much of which lacks water owing to its karst topography. The northeast section consists of the mountains of the Dinaric Alps, with a maximum elevation of 4,596 feet (1,401 meters) at Mount Učka. These modest heights slope gradually south and west in undulating terraces toward the Adriatic. Parts of the peninsula have thick forests, and places suffering from the ravages of timber cutting are being reforested. In the waterless karst areas a scrub vegetation prevails. A Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters.\n\nThe population of Istria, approximately two-thirds of which is Croatian, engages mostly in agriculture. Wheat, corn (maize), rye, oats, figs, fruit, and olives are grown in the fertile western and southeastern coastal areas, and cattle are bred. There has been an increase in viticulture, and fishing and shipbuilding are other activities. Salt is obtained from seawater at Piran and Portorož in Slovenia. Raša, in Croatia, is an important site for the mining of high-quality anthracite coal; and bauxite, building stone, and quartz are also extracted. Istria’s most important town and harbor is Pula, which has a well-preserved Roman amphitheater. Opatija and Brioni are best known as seaside resorts."
