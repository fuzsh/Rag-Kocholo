        "text": "Once on location we evaluate and stabilize the Patient.\n\nProcedures, such as re-positioning fractures, simple dislocations or suturing minor wounds will be done with the Patientâs consent on location. Depending on the outcome, the Patient will be provided with all necessary medication and will either stay at the site, or be flown out for further examination and treatment.\n\nIf communication is possible, the first feedback is given to our Headquarters, to contact the Insurance to organize any further transport, examination and treatment, providing a quick and continuous medical service.\n\nFor Patients who have to be further medevacâd by plane, we provide a fully medical equipped Holding Facility at Maun International Airport where we take care of the Patient until the next medical Crew has arrived.\n\nIf no communication is possible and if medically indicated, the patient is flown back to civilisation immediately. The following procedures will be as described above.\n\nIf the Patron has no Insurance or if the Insurance refuses payment for further treatment, we will deliver the patient to the nearest Government Hospital.\n\nOur Helicopter is a fully customized medically fitted Bell Jetranger 206 III and is based out of Maun International Airport, Botswana.\n\nOn a mobile basis we have all the Medications and Medical Equipment with us that a Patient would find in the emergency room of a General Hospital.\n\nWe can thus provide on location sufficient Pain Management, Stabilisation of Heart Insufficiency, manage acute life threatening emergencies like Myocardial Infarction and Stroke, support ventilation and give Oxygen in Respiratory Distress, prevent major side effects from Allergic Reactions, provide emergency treatment for severe diseases such as Malaria, Meningitis, Pneumonia, Abdominal and Urogenital Infections, as well as control Bleedings, Diabetes and Epilepsy, repositioning of Fractures and Dislocations under general intravenous Anaesthesia with continuous Monitoring of the Vital Signs (Pulse, Blood Pressure, ECG, Oxygen Saturation, Breathing Rate). The above is not exhaustive.\n\nOur fully up to date medical Equipment includes a Cardiac Monitor and Defibrillator with Pacemaker, a 12, 5 or 3 lead ECG, SpO2, CO2 and non-invasive Blood Pressure Measurement, Infusion Pumps and Syringe Drivers, Suction Unit with backup, Oxygen, Ventilator, Suture Kits, Urine- and Nasogastric-Catheters, Pulmonary Drains with Drainage Sets, Standard Rescue and Immobilisation Equipment and a special Helicopter Vacuum Mattress as well as a Scoop Stretcher.\n\nEven though we are in a remote area the range of our Emergency Medication consists of intravenous resuscitation applications like Adrenaline, Amniodarone, Antibiotics, Antihistamines, Anti-Nausea-Drugs, Atropine, Benzodiazepines, Beta-Blockers, Cortisone, Dopamine, Ephedrine, Furosemide, Insulin, Ketamine, Morphine, Muscle-Relaxants, Propofol, Salbutamol and Universal Snake Antivenin.\n\nIf a Patient does not have to be flown out we can supply the person with essential oral Pain Medication, Antibiotics, Antihistamines, Eye- Nose- and Ear-Drops, Heart-Medications, Prednisone as well as Wound Dressings, Bandages and Inhalers.\n\nQuick Tests like Blood-Sugar Measurements, Urine-, Malaria-, HIV- and Pregnancy Tests can be done on the spot.\n\nWe furthermore provide Primary Health Care contracts for companies with large compliments of Staff in remote areas.\n\nUnder such a contract we manage all health related issues pertaining to staff. Three Setswana speaking nurses can be contacted seven days per week during office hours from 08:00 am to 05:00 pm via Telephone, Radio, Skype or E-Mail. After office hours and in an emergency, the short code Number \"995\" can be used.\n\nIn camp the Managers are trained to take vital parameters from the Patients, like Pulse Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, Respiration Rate and Pain Score. These Parameters are vital to evaluate the Patient on an objective base and will be given to the nurses with all the other medical information needed. During the office hours our nurses can communicate directly with the Patients in Setswana or English to provide confidentiality.\n\nThe Patients are thus managed remotely and medication is prescribed from First Aid Kits that are also managed by OAR. The Nurses discuss each case with a Doctor and if no improvement is achieved within a reasonable amount of time our Doctors evaluate the need of flying the patient into town with the management of the company in question.\n\nOnce in town, the Patient first visits OAR Headquarters where the necessary referrals are written, before the Patient proceeds to either the Government Hospital or the individual Specialist. Upon the Patients recovery, the staff member once again needs to pass by the OAR Head Quarters, where the \"green light for working in the bush\" is given and where we keep thorough records of all Patients.\n\nWithin the normal parameters of confidentiality we provide the company with a monthly report and statistics of all events.\n\nAs we are Doctor based, we are entitled to collect medication for chronic diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes and HIV Patients so that they are not forced to fly every month into town for their refills, but only every third month, when they are entitled to their holidays and go for their regular blood checks and routine physical examinations.\n\nTo have clarity whilst treating Patients remotely, we suggest the content of the First Aid Kits to match our suggested stock lists. Companies can then order new stock through us, which we order and pack for the individual camps, to be collected from OAR Head Quarters.\n\nWithin this contract we endeavour to have a Nurse visiting each and every Camp of our clients at least once in every three months and a Doctor once a year. This personal interaction with the Staff and the Management of the Camps is very beneficial to the smooth operation of the service.\n\nIn 2015 over 3600 evaluations were done and kept on record of which around 1200 were at OAR Head Quarters, whilst the balance was done by Phone, Radio, Skype, E-mail and during Camp Visits.\n\nFor enquiries pertaining to our Primary Health Care Contracts, please contact our Head Quarters.
