        "text": "In the United States, Mother’s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May and this year will fall on 12 May.\n\nMother’s Day is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in March, April or May, as a day to honor mothers and motherhood.\n\nIn most countries Mother’s Day is a recent observance derived from the holiday as it evolved in the United States. When adopted by other countries and cultures it was given different meanings, associated to different religious, historical and legendary events, and celebrated on different dates.\n\nIn my country (Indonesia), we celebrate Mother’s Day, known as Hari Ibu, on December 22nd.\n\nWhy December 22nd ?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis year, Mother’s Day will be celebrated on May 8th in the US and some other countries like Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium.

It’s time to pamper her for all she has done for us over the years.\n\nIn my country, Mother’s day (or Hari Ibu) is celebrated nationally on December 22. It is the day of the first Indonesian Women Congress from December 22 to 25, 1928 conducted in Yogyakarta, Central Java. It was attended by 30 feminist organizations from 12 cities in Java and Sumatra. Feminist organizations have existed since 1912, inspired by Indonesian heroines of the 19th century, e.g. Kartini, Martha Christina Tiahahu, Cut Nyak Dien, Maria Walanda Maramis, Dewi Sartika, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, Rasuna Said etc.\n\nPicture from gunawank.wordpress.com\n\nThe idea to make the day official was started during the third Indonesian Women Congress in 1938. It was signed by president Soekarno under the Presidential Decree no. 316 year 1959. The day was originally aimed to celebrate the spirit of Indonesian women and to improve the condition of the nation.\n\nWhy Mother’s Signature Dish?\n\nContinue reading →"
