The location of the study was in five districts, namely Sulam entrepreneurs in Banda Aceh, Aceh Besar, Bireun, Lhokseumawe and West Aceh. The sampling method uses Proportional Stratified Sampling. Then random sampling was carried out in each city or regency with a total of 198 embroidery entrepreneurs. This research uses AMOS Structural Equation Model (SEM), as a data analysis tool. From the test, some results showed that Entrepreneurial Recruitment, Entrepreneur Training, and Entrepreneurial Orientation have a positive effect on Entrepreneurial Commitment and entrepreneurial performance. Whereas, there was found to be no positive effect of organisational innovation on entrepreneurial commitment and entrepreneurial performance. The entrepreneurial commitment variable acted as an intervening variable and mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial recruitment and entrepreneurial performance, namely Fully Mediated. The entrepreneurial commitment variable does not act as an intervening variable and does not mediate the relationship of entrepreneurial training with Entrepreneurial performance (Partial Mediated). The entrepreneurial commitment variable does not act as an intervening variable and does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial performance. The entrepreneurial commitment variable does not act as an intervening variable and does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial performance (Partially Mediated). The entrepreneurial commitment variable does not act as an intervening variable and does not mediate the relationship of organisational innovation with Entrepreneurial performance (Non-Mediated).

Saplana, aCollege of Nursing, Ateneo de Zamboanga University, La Purisima St., Zamboanga City, Philippines, Email: asaplandyam@adzu.edu.ph\n\nThe study aimed to apply Everett M. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory to heighten the research culture in selected Colleges of Nursing in Region IX, Philippines through the “Awareness and Motivation Session”. Utilising Rogers’ DOI Theory, this study looked into the possibility of whether the innovation, which was the “Awareness and Motivation Session,” was able to heighten the research culture among faculty in selected colleges of nursing by reinforcing their interest in research, and for faculty members to seek opportunities to engage in research activities. Quasi-experimental, pre-test/post-test research design utilising quantitative approach and complementary qualitative approach was employed in the study. Thirty-two (32) faculty respondents and four (4) administrators who were employed in Colleges of Nursing in Zamboanga City, Region IX were involved in the study, and were chosen through convenience sampling. An adapted questionnaire on faculty research productivity based on Bland et al. (2002) model was used with permission, for the quantitative part. To complement the results gathered from the questionnaire, a semi-structured interview utilising an interview guide was employed for the qualitative part. Both instruments underwent content validity and reliability. Findings revealed there was a significant difference on the perception of the faculty on research culture in the Colleges of Nursing in terms of institutional factors before and after the Awareness and Motivation Session, and increase in mean values of the leadership and individual factors. The AMS, used as an innovation to heighten research culture in the study, showed promise to be an effective initiative to heighten research culture among faculty in Colleges of Nursing. Furthermore, results have shown no significant difference in the perception of research culture in terms of individual and institutional factors between the faculty and the administrators of Colleges of Nursing in Zamboanga City. However, a significant difference in terms of leadership factor between faculty and administrators in Colleges of Nursing was presented. The Awareness and Motivation Session may be further enhanced to be more effective in heightening research culture in the Colleges of Nursing.

It serves as a training venue for nurse interns in adapting to clinical situations. This study aimed to determine the relationship that exists in the level of adaptation of nurse interns in acute care hospital practice and their demographic features. It employed a descriptive correlational study with the participation of eighty-two nurse interns who were about to complete the internship program from the University of Hail City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A two-part questionnaire tool was utilised, with the first part covering the demographic features of respondents and the second part adapted Casey-Fink Readiness for the practice survey tool. The questionnaire was validated by five experts, and 15 nurse interns who were not part of the actual group of respondents answered it for reliability testing, utilising the Cronbach alpha. The overall adaptation level of nurse interns in hospital practice is slightly able to adapt. There is no significant difference between the level of adaptation of nurse interns in acute care hospital practice when grouped according to age. However, there is a significant difference between the level of adaptation and their GPA and type of program. It was concluded that nurse interns from the bridging program and those with high-grade point average appear to have a higher level of adaptation in acute care hospital practice than those in the regular program and those with low-grade point average.

In order to cultivate such skills, it is necessary to embrace a form of teamwork based on cooperative learning in which students can interact with each other and exercise their skills in an appropriate environment. A key characteristic of cooperative learning is to assign a designated role to particular team members, making each important to contribute to the achievement of team mission. However, it remains unclear how many roles should be constituted in one team and how students with different personality types should be grouped together. This paper therefore adopts the framework of DISC personality and Kolb's experiential learning cycle to develop a synthesised model called COPE which composes of four crucial roles of teamwork: Communicator, Overseer, Philosopher and Empathist. Each of the roles can be well aligned with the four personality types which are classified by their focus when working towards the completion of a given mission (task-focused or people-focused) and their preferred mode of idea expression (expressive or passive). The COPE model offers designated roles for students to accomplish in classroom settings. In addition, it offers a cyclical rotation of the roles which is believed to be theoretically appropriate for students to learn to work with others effectively and to adapt themselves to work on a newly given role professionally.

This study uses a quantitative research approach with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis techniques using Lisrel software. The study was conducted on 120 students of the third level of the Study Program in DIII Nursing Stikes Hang Tuah, Surabaya who are undergoing the final practice in the form of a case study at Hospital Dr Ramelan, Surabaya. The results showed that the educational model of student caring behaviour is influenced jointly by knowledge in the form of personality and skills courses in the form of expertise courses through a combination of mediation together with the direct influence of student attitudes about caring, the direct influence of student subjective norms and the effect of indirect perception control student caring behaviour. The results of the research model are fit, which includes both. Implications: the results of the study found the concept that caring behaviour education for nursing students needs to be developed based on the principles of knowing moral integrity, moral feeling, and moral action through various learning approaches. Students need to be assigned assignments for study visits or internships at a hospital, according to the time available, as part of the lecture system, to gain more knowledge and skills. It is also necessary for leaders or related institutions to develop caring behavioural learning modules in health services in hospitals.

The Navy educational institutions are expected to adapt with the development of science and technology. It is aligned with the quality of educators available. Nowadays, available educators cannot focus one hundred percent on the job. This is because there are other tasks and workloads, so the role of service to students and institutions is not in accordance with professional standards. The aim of paper is give an analysis and strategy for the development of an educator’s competence in the Indonesian Navy (TNI AL). This research uses SWOT analysis and Fuzzy Multi criteria Decision Making method (F-MCDM). The result paper showed 4 (four) strategies for the development of educator competence. The strategies consist of seven points for the Strength-opportunity (SO) strategy; seven points for the II Weakness-Opportunity (WO) strategy; six points for the III Weakness-Threat (WT) strategy; and seven points for the Strength-Threat IV strategy (ST). Based on Fuzzy MCDM, this paper showed the weighted value of several strategies, such as: 0.2841 for Strategy I (S-O); 0.2844 for Strategy II (W-O); 0.2177 for Strategy III (W-T); 0.2138 for Strategy IV (S-O).

Lidah wetan Surabaya, Email: aanggaindrakusuma46@gmail.com, bharisetijono@yahoo.co.id, cEdytrack@yahoo.co.id\n\nVO2 max is the \"engine\" of an athlete. The better VO2 max, the better physical abilities of an athlete to play games for a long time without significant exhaustion. Badminton players, for example, must have excellent physical condition. The physical condition of Indonesian players, especially their VO2 max, however, tends to be relatively low. This study aims to examine: (1) the effects of jump rope and high jump training with 1:1 intervals on increasing VO2 max and anaerobic threshold; (2) the difference between the effects of jump rope training with intervals of 1:1 and high jump with intervals of 1:1 on VO2 max and anaerobic threshold. This research uses a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental method. The research design used in in this study is factorial design and data analysis using t-test and MANOVA. The results show that: (1) There is an effect of jump rope and high jump training with 1:1 intervals on increasing VO2 max and anaerobic threshold; (2) there is a difference in effects between jump rope training with 1:1 intervals and high jump with 1:1 intervals on VO2 max and anaerobic threshold. This study concludes that jump rope and high jump training with 1:1 intervals can increase VO2 max and anaerobic threshold, and that jump rope training with 1:1 intervals works more effectively.

Umrana, Harnina Ridwanb, Udin Udinc*, Samiruddin Td, a,b,dUniversitas Halu Oleo, Kendari, Indonesia, cUniversitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Email: c*udin_labuan@yahoo.com\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the actor's strategy in maintaining the integrity of the group against the conflicting placement of the capital of North Buton Regency, Indonesia. The method used is qualitative research aimed at describing, formulating, and analysing both natural and human social phenomena related to the problem of capital placement. The subjects of this study consisted of executive officers, legislators, elites, community leaders, and community members who were actors in 6 sub-districts in North Buton Regency, which is populated by 59,281 people. Primary data collection in this study was carried out using observation, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and documentation. This study uses descriptive analysis, so the data obtained is analysed empirically to be understood. The results of this study indicate that the actors in maintaining the integrity of the group are a source of inspiration in fighting for the interests of the surrounding community by using a variety of strategies that co-opts the community with the views expressed by the actors. The most prominent actor strategies played in maintaining the integrity of the group are the political invasion strategy, the economic invasion strategy, the power invasion strategy, and the socio-cultural invasion strategy. In the arena, there are always parties, both individuals and groups, who dominate with the power of their resources. Those who are not the dominant group must strive so that their capital can survive, develop, and then be preserved in order to perpetuate the existence of actors.

The type of research used is an explanatory type of research, which explains the symptoms caused by an object of research, namely by testing and analysing the influence of ownership structure, capital structure, investment opportunity set (IOS) on company value through dividend policy as its mediation. The population size of this research consisted of 151 manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange that operated between 2013-2017. Companies chosen in the observation period had distributed dividends and had managerial ownership of 32 companies for 5 years which equates to 160 firm years. The method of data analysis is Path analysis and Sobel test, which is used to test the mediating role of dividend policy variable. The findings of the research are that ownership structure, capital structure and IOS significantly influence the firm value, ownership structure, and capital structure; IOS have no significant effect on dividend policy and ownership structure; IOS have a significant effect on company value mediated dividend policy; capital structure has no significant effect towards company value mediated dividend policy; and that dividend policy has no significant effect on firm value.

Data was obtained from 476 employees in Bahrain’s service industry. The data was analysed using PLS-SEM’s measurement model and structural model evaluation. The results obtained from the running of PLS-SEM’s algorithm indicate that training and development, non-monetary rewards, and working conditions are significant determinants of talent retention. This implies that need-based training and development, relevant non-monetary rewards, and conducive working conditions should be entrenched in organisations in order to enhance talent retention in Bahrain and elsewhere in the world. While the impacts of training, pay-for-performance, non-monetary rewards and working condition on talent retention are relatively high, there are other unidentified variables that could have impacts on talent retention. Hence, future research should endeavour to identify those factors.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the predictors of employee innovation performance by investigating the effects of job design, training and development, compensation, and succession planning on employee innovation performance. It aims to do so by using employee ambidexterity as a mediating variable. Data, which was elicited from 350 individuals who hold managerial positions in Bahraini firms through a survey, was analysed using a Smart PLS-SEM’s approach (measurement and structural model evaluation). The overall results indicate that employee ambidexterity mediates the relationships between selected HR practices and employee innovation performance. This implies that job design, training & development, compensation, and succession planning are significant drivers of employee innovation performance in the current, increasingly competitive environment. This could be enhanced through a concurrent pursuit of innovation using both explorative and exploitative activities that are carried out by the employees of the organisations (i.e., employee ambidexterity). Lastly, implications for theory and practice and suggestions for future studies were discussed.

The novel portrays the deprived and Coloured sections of society. The residents of Brewster Place represent the lower class; primarily Black women who have come to Brewster Place in search of peace. They are constantly searching for home, both as a literal place to live and as a metaphorical state of mind. They share their struggles and make efforts to live in unity with compassion and consideration. They stick to Brewster Place as they find none to help out in the world. They narrate stories of narrow escapes from unfriendly and soul-destroying forces of their past. The novel also symbolises the failure of the American Dream, as characters weave dreams of macabre, dark and dismal visions; nightmares which any American would hate to come across in life. There are also instances of fractured relationships that further signify the characters’ quests to find home in a bewildering urban environment.

In the context of organisations, higher turnover intention has been a critical phenomenon, since further problems arise from it in companies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of job security on turnover intention with burnout as the mediator. This is causality research. The population consists of nurses of private hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia. The respondents are 202 nurses. The data in this study was primarily obtained using questionnaires. The data was analysed using Partial Least Square (PLS) and Sobel tests to determine the indirect effects. This study indicates that job insecurity affects turnover intention, job burnout, and burnout affected turnover intensions. A Sobel test determined that burnout could mediate the effect of job security on turnover intentions. The employees who experienced job insecurity tended to have higher levels of intention to leave the organisation. Moreover, burnout was found to be a mediating variable between job insecurity and intention to quit. Hence, increasing job insecurity encouraged higher levels of employee burnout, and subsequently increased the intention to find alternative employment.

The Wetu Telu tradition has been inherited down from many generations by Sasak ethnic groups, and has experienced a cultural endeavour in the era of globalisation, because it was considered not in accordance with the teachings of Islam in general. The endeavour arises between the ethnic Sasak group who want to maintain the Wetu Telu tradition as a local identity and those who want to apply Islamic culture in general. The endeavour raises concerns about the extinction of the Wetu Telu tradition and the Sasak ethnic group losing their identity. The issue that arises in this case is how Sasak people can maintain their local wisdom so as not to lose their identity. To analyse and explain the Wetu Telu culture as a local identity of the Sasak ethnicity, qualitative research methods were used to reveal the Wetu Telu cultural meaning as a Sasak identity and explain the rise of Sasak local wisdom in Lombok in the midst of globalisation. Qualitative research methods in this case use the historical paradigm, the theory of multiculturalism and the theory of hegemony. This research will be able to reveal the background of the Wetu Telu culture, the endeavour of identity and the rise of the Wetu Telu as the Sasak identity. The results of this study describe the emergence of Cultural Islam as a cultural adaptation between the Wetu Telu and the teachings of Islam in general.

In addition to natural disasters, man has contributed to the spread of pollution beyond the tolerable limits, causing an environmental damage that threatens the continuity of life itself. Environmental conditions are of such intensity that they necessitate a different lifestyle for their improvement, as well as the development of a sustainable environment. Since the demand to create fundamental changes in the behaviour of the individual and his/her habits towards the environment is urgent, the media comes to occupy an important position in the pursuit and realization of such changes. A new media branch has emerged, under the name of Environmental Media, which contributes, most notably, in developed countries, to raising public awareness about environmental issues. It thus alerts and encourages governments to be more attentive to environmental problems. Given the reality of media practice with respect to environmental issues in developing countries, there is a gap between these media practices and their resonance with individuals. Such effect is sought by media outlets through the spread of their message of guidance and enlightenment, bearing social and cultural weight on the educational and political abilities of the society to create values and good attitudes. Study Problem: The objective of this analytical study is to address the global role of the UAE in the protection of the environment, and the promotion of sustainable development through. This is achieved by highlighting through the media the efforts exerted by the UAE in facing problems of the environment and sustainable development, at the local and international level; and also by analysing media trends in addressing some of the problems of the environment and sustainable development. This study will also evaluate the role of the daily UAE press in this regard, particularly as they are presented in Al Etihad and the Gulf newspapers.
