        "text": "In the late 1990’s, a new genre of Sufi art began to emerge in Dakar, Senegal: the Sufi music video. Drawing on the local traditions of Arabic, Wolof, and Pulaar Sufi poetry, local praise-poetry traditions, as well as local and global genres of music video (especially hip-hop and reggae videos), these music videos have become one of the most popular forms of expression of Sufism amongst youth in Senegal. Many disciples have begun to use these music videos as a form of spiritual practice, deliberately watching and singing along with them as a means of cultivating a particular state of remembrance (dhikr), much as Arabic Sufi poetry was and is used to express and cultivate similar states of spiritual realization. In this paper, I will present and analyze two of the most popular contemporary Sufi music videos, which the disciples of Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse (d. 1975) brought to my attention during my research in Dakar in 2014. I will analyze the lyrics and the significant visual symbolism of the two videos, explaining and exploring their extensive references to classical and local Sufi doctrines and poetry, local praise-poetry traditions, and hip-hop and reggae, concluding with a theoretical discussion of the ways in which these videos perform, not only particular African Muslim identities, but also spiritual realization and sanctity.\n\nThe study explores the role of social media and technology in the inclusion of women in the performance of Sufi music. Qawwali performances have traditionally been a male art form, therefore, attention has been given to the digitization and fusion of Sufi Qawwali in Bollywood films and YouTube channels. The study shows that Bollywood has been a prominent space for performance of female Qawwal’s. Despite technological advancement and increasing contribution of YouTube channels in proliferating Sufi Music, it has done little to improve women’s participation in this male dominated space. Furthermore, the study is epistemologically bound to the cultural, social and historical context of Sufi Qawwali; while noting the absence of female vocals in Bollywood and social media’s mediation of Sufi music. Keywords: Qawwali, Gender, Sufi Music, Technology, Social Media, YouTube Channels\n\nThe film is a medium of communication as well as an effective medium of da’wah and can be well received by all levels of society, especially Muslims. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film is a biopic film that tells the story of the life journey of Siti Walidah, who is often known as Nyai Ahmad Dahlan. This research aims to find out what da’wah messages are in the Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film. The researcher uses the semiotic analysis of Charles Sanders Peirce, using three stages: the sign, the use of the sign (interpretant), and the reference sign (object). This study uses a descriptive qualitative method using a data analysis approach to answer the problems formulated. The data is obtained from several scenes that refer to the message of da’wah and similar previous studies. From the research that has been conducted, it is concluded that the Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film contains several messages of Islamic da’wah, including messages of aqidah (belief), moral messages, and sharia messages in the form of muama...\n\nIn the cultural space of the subcontinent Sufi rituals constitute an important area of research, stirring academic and non-academic inquisitiveness. And in this regard no aspect of Sufi ritualism has been more contentious than the practice of Sama (Sufi musical assemblies). Frowned upon by orders such as the Qadiris and Naqsh-bandis; regulated by the State in the name of Shariah (Islamic Law), Sama assemblies have been, for centuries, the defining spiritual exercise of many a leading Sufi silsila. But what constitutes the sama? How does the content(s) of such a ritual arouse spiritual sensibilities? Is there any definite structure for conducting such assemblies? These are some of the questions this paper will try to answer.\n\nFilm is one of mass media, as well as radio, television, and newspapers, have moral responsibility to provide educational value, goodness value as well as religious values. This purpose of this study is to analyze representation of Islamic values in Film Duka Sedalam Cinta. This research used a descriptive qualitative research method. It considers meaning as the main attention. The form of religious values in question is the Islamic values conveyed through message that exist in the film. The analysis method used is semiotics according to Fiske with the analysis unit consists of three levels: reality level, representation level, ideology level. The finding indicates that the representations encapsulate the perception of Islamic value in film Duka Sedalam Cinta may contribute towards establishing a more democratic and peaceful. Keywords—representation; islamic value; film; semiotic fiske"
