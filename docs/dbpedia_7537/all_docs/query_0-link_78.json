        "text": "MUHAMMADIYAH.OR.ID, SURAKARTA — President of Muhammadiyah Haedar Nashir graced the 107th Anniversary Celebration of ;Aisyiyah conducted at the Universitas Aisyiyah Surakarta on Sunday (May 19). Other Muhammadiyah Chairpersons, including Agung Danarto, Busyro Muqoddas, Dahlan Rais, and Muhammad Sayuti, joined Haedar at the event. President o ‘Aisyiyah’s Salmah Orbayinah was also present.\n\nIn his speech, Haedar extended his heartfelt congratulations to Aisyiyah for reaching its 107th year. He commended the organization’s remarkable contributions in serving the community, the nation, and humanity as a whole. Haedar highlighted Aisyiyah’s dedication to taking tangible action and its ability to transcend time. He noted the organization’s reach, extending not only to urban centers but also to remote areas and even the international stage.\n\nProfessor Haedar, a professor of sociology, emphasized Aisyiyah’s pioneering role in establishing the global Islamic women’s movement. He explained that Aisyiyah’s approach to women’s issues is firmly grounded in fundamental Islamic values. These values serve as a compass for Aisyiyah in its work.\n\nAisyiyah’s presence has significantly impacted the lives of women in Indonesia. The organization has empowered women to move beyond the traditional confines of domesticity and actively participate in public life. Aisyiyah champions the concept of gender equality, advocating for women’s rights to participate fully in the public sphere.\n\nPrior to Aisyiyah’s establishment, Indonesian society held a conservative view on women’s roles. Women were largely confined to the domestic realm. However, in the early 20th century, Western liberal influences began to challenge this traditional perspective, leading to a greater degree of freedom and autonomy for women.\n\n“Aisyiyah has charted a unique course, adopting a middle ground position (wasathiyah) between these two extremes. This approach is as standing “between the rights and left,” a position that defines Aisyiyah’s unique perspective,” said Haedar.\n\nHaedar urged Aisyiyah to preserve and enrich its core values of moderation. He emphasized the importance of Aisyiyah’s wasathiyah philosophy, which he linked to the genuine progressive values championed by Nyai Walidah. These combined principles form the bedrock of Aisyiyah’s women’s movement.\n\nWhile not directly influenced by Western thought, Nyai Walidah was deeply immersed in studying the Quran under the guidance of her father and Kiai Ahmad Dahlan. This dedication to Islamic scholarship led Nyai Walidah to develop a progressive and middle-ground ideology that continues to shape the women’s movement.\n\nNyai Walidah’s forward-thinking perspective was evident in 1926 when she became the first woman to deliver a speech at the 15th Muhammadiyah Congress in Surabaya. This act shattered traditional expectations and demonstrated that women were not merely passive observers but active participants capable of leadership.\n\nThe shared vision of Muhammadiyah and Aisyiyah for a progressive Islam was further refined at the 48th Congress (Muktamar) , leading to the creation of the Treatise of Progressive Islam and the Treatise of Progressive Islamic Women."
