        "text": "Geneological perspective differences on the Jakarta Charter had become the main cause for some Islamic groups to have an endless struggle in embodying Islamism and Islamic ideology formalism as the basis of their philosophy and ideology. Compromise and radicalism are part of the movement of these groups. This study aims to examine the supporters’ movement of the understanding of Islamism and Islamic Idiology formalism in order to get involve in Indonesian political system. The phenomenological constructivism approach is used in understanding the views of New Order Regime and Reforms Regime in dealing with Islamism and Islamic idiology formalism which are taken from interview and document analysis. The results of the study show that the radical issues are far more than the normal level of the Indonesian Islam movement. The concerns of certain groups which are oriented towards the Islamic movement in Indonesia are more co-opted in an anti-Islamic global network sponsored by the United...\n\nThis article discusses Muhammadiyah and the statehood politics in Indonesia. Through the literature study method, this article reveals that Muhammadiyah is a social organization that grows and develops in tandem with the socio-cultural and political growth and development in Indonesia. In his journey, Muhammadiyah concentrated more on his social work, but he could not be separated from the correlation with power of politics. The consistency of the non-partisan missionary movement does not reduce the interest of Muhammadiyah activists involved in practical politics. Based on his khittah, Muhammadiyah is not a political organization and will not become a political party. However, with the belief that Islam is a religion that regulates all human life in the world, naturally all matters relating to the world become the fields of Muhammadiyah&#39;s work, including matters of state politics. This article underlines that religious modernity can be used as input for political development in...\n\nUnlike many of Islamic organizations, where they have some international agenda, Islamic social organizations in Indonesia have unique characteristics allowed them to play an important role in Indonesian society. Although, Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama have some differences in basic thoughts and mechanism of actions but they are in the same competition to serve the society. This specific case made these two organizations more long lasting and trustworthy. This study included explanation of values, political characteristics and feature of these two Islamic organizations in addition to the role of both of them in shaping political aspects in Indonesia. This study was conducted by adopting qualitative approach through interviews with regional leaders and scholars in East Java Province. Narrative approach was used to finalize the results and writing report. This study reveals the political role of Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama through forming political parties, participation in election, adopting Pancasila, education, economic activities, and religious occasions in shaping the political identity in the country. The formers, scholars, regional leaders of both organizations have an effect on followers and society to choose representatives in DPR (People's representative council), MPR (People's consultative assembly) and DPD (Regional representative council).\n\nThis study aims to reveal and explain the political relations between Islam and the state in Indonesia. The study was conducted on the inspiration that emerges from the writer's observation, after doing a historical study on the growing phenomenon since the end of Western colonialism in the mid 20th century. The phenomenon that is, the difficulty of Islam in Indonesia, even in other Muslim countries to develop appropriate synthesis between Islamic movements and political ideas with countries in the context of their respective localities. In Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country, the political relations between Islam and the state is often characterized by sharp tensions, even hostile. With respect to the position of the Muslim majority, drove us to the question. Why Islam is the majority of it is difficult to get a place as a state religion? Why the state is still difficult to make Islam the basis of the state? The fact is what attracted the attention of researchers, thus was born a question \"whether Islam can be in line with modern political system, in which the idea of the nation-state is one of the constituents. The results showed that in Indonesia Muslim group active in the political movement regards the state with suspicion. The group is looking at countries are doing double standard policy on political Islam in Indonesia. On the one hand supports the formation of a secular Muslim societies, and on the other hand did not leave the room or the slightest opportunity for the growth of political Islam. As a result, frequent political tension between Islam and the state, especially during the reign of Sukarno and Suharto regime. Key Words:Islamic relationship, politics and the state in indonesia, a historical analysis.\n\nThe Indonesian political elites tend to use Muslims for their personal interests , instead of making Islam as their moral guide in the political arena, despite Nurcholish Madjid's (Cak Nur) secularization is needed. For this reason, this research discusses the political ideals of Cak Nur, especially the idea of secularization in the midst of the current political Islam in Indonesia. Using a descriptive method, literature study, and a qualitative approach, the results of the study showed that Islam essentially is not merely a formal structure or composition and collection of laws of the state and government. Islam is the embodiment of tawḥīd. It is a spiritual force that can give birth to a soul that is ḥanīf, inclusive, democratic, and respects society's pluralism. Therefore, an understanding of more advanced Islamic teachings, such as Cak Nur's secularization concept which according to Cak Nur's does not lead to secularism; as well as the need for freedom of thought, an idea of progress, and openness to ideas are a necessity in Indonesia. As such Moslem should use a secular lens to view worldly matters that need rational and objective thinking, rather than using faith, Islamic law, ʻaqīda (creed), and ʻibāda (worship) which are spiritual matters. Abstrak: Alih-alih menjadikan Islam sebagai panduan moral saat berpolitik, para elit politik Indonesia masih cenderung memanfaatkan umat Islam untuk kepentingan individual. Padahal, dalam cita politik Islam Nurcholish Madjid, selanjutnya diringkas dengan Cak Nur, perlu adanya pemisahan antara urusan dunia dan agama (sekularisasi). Untuk itu, penelitian ini mendiskusi cita politik Islam Cak Nur, khususnya gagasan sekularisasi di tengah arus Islam politik di Indonesia masa kini. Dengan menggunakan metode deskriptif dan kepustakaan, serta pendekatan kualitatif, hasil penelitian menunjukkan, Islam yang hakiki Al-Risalah 98 bukan semata merupakan struktur atau susunan dan kumpulan hukum yang tegak berdiri di atas formalisme negara dan pemerintahan. Namun Islam sebagai pengejewantahan tauhid yang merupakan kekuatan spiritual mampu melahirkan jiwa yang ḥanīf, inklusif, demokratis, serta menghargai pluralisme masyarakat. Oleh karenanya, pemahaman terhadap ajaran agama Islam yang lebih maju, yakni dengan konsep sekularisasi yang menurut penjelasan Cak Nur bukan mengarah ke sekularisme; serta perlunya kebebasan berpikir, idea of progress, dan sikap terbuka adalah sebuah keniscayaan untuk diterapkan di Indonesia. Dengan begitu, umat perlu melakukan profanisasi masalah-masalah duniawi yang pendekatannya membutuhkan sikap objektif dan rasional dari masalah-masalah iman, hukum Islam, akidah dan ibadah yang bersifat spiritual.\n\nIslamic awakening in Indonesia would be best explained as a crisis of modernity, which emphasizes the material life, domination of rationalism and reluctance of spiritual dimension. These are significant contributing factors to the Islamic awakening. This could be obviously discerned from the increasing numbers of middle class Muslims who attend religious discourse and commit the religious practices. This paper attempts to discuss the indicators of Islamic awakening in Indonesian politics. It has been divided into two significant sections; first on the proponents and idea of Islamic awakening; second, it also draws the indicators of Islamic awakening in Indonesia in the early 1990s, which compel the different turn of Islam (the new hope for Islam) in Indonesian politics.\n\nThis research aims to review the Islamic politics of the Kiai affiliated with the religious organization called Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) examining the Kiai&#39;s Islamic politics focusing on the social-historical arguments and strategies promoted by the religious elites to keep their role in the lives of Muslims. Within the political dynamics of modern Islamic lifestyle, Kiai still holds their position as honorable figures. The methodology of this study uses the social history school as a research method to see the social background in the Islamic political history of the kiai as well as contains a critical aspect to analyze the dynamics of the kiai&#39;s Islamic politics. This study is carried out by reconstructing socio-political events involving traditionalist kiai on the Indonesian political stage from the independence period until the 2019 election. The main finding in this study is that the Islamic politics promoted by the Kiai are based on the Islamic teachings about social conce...\n\nAs the culminating point of long history of penetracion de pacifique of Islam across the archipelago of Indonesia (Nusantara), several Kingdoms of Islam emerged in the early 19th century of modern Indonesia. The kings not only perform the functions in political domain but also in religious matters; with the rulers being the guidance of Islamic law (syari’ah). Gaining the independence of the country in Mid 20th century ( 1945), this historical legacy continues to be tackled by the post-monarchy state of Republic Indonesia under the Ministry of Religious Affairs—but its legal basis was a controversy when the Indonesian Constitution,UUD 1945, was agreed upon, without explicit mention of the duties to be performed by Muslims to implement the Islamic law. Now that power politics in 2019 poses heated debate over the khilafah ideology and political system vis-a-vis Pancasila, it is interesting to look into deeper insights of the legacy of Khalitullah Panatagama. From the duality of nomocra..."
