For the sake of brevity I refer to my prefaces in those volumes. A few essentials my be repeated here. Not all manuscripts mentioned in the present volume were viewed by autopsy. The sheer number of manuscripts makes this impossible. At a later stage this may be achieved, but trying to achieve this at the present stage of inventorizing would seriously hamper the progress of the project. When a manuscript was not inspected this can be seen from a simple typographical device. Whenever the indication of the shelf-mark is put between round brackets, I have not, or not extensively or sufficiently, inspected the manuscript, and its entry in the inventory is based mostly or entirely on secondary sources, be they published or not. These have, of course, always been indicated. When the shelf-mark is put between square brackets and preceded by an asterisk, this means that I have had the manuscript in my hands, at least once but probably more often, and that the description contains elements that can only be seen in the original manuscript. Such autopsy does not mean that I am, automatically, the author of all information given under that particular class-mark. The basic elements for each entry of the present inventory are: 1. class-mark, 2. language(s), 3. details of physical description, 4. survey of the contents, 5. provenance, 6. location on the shelf. Depending on the nature of the material, exceptions and divergences are made from this strict arrangement. The collective provenance of a series of manuscripts may be concentrated into a short text, preceding that series, without being repeated under each class-mark. When Dr. P. Voorhoeve in 1946 took over responsibility for the Oriental collections in the Leiden Library he found a great number of as yet unregistered manuscripts in the office of his predecessor, Dr. C. van Arendonk. The latter had not been able to cope with the enormous influx of manuscripts, and more in particular the materials in the Snouck Hurgronje bequest, which entered the Library in 1936. Working away this back log had a high priority for Voorhoeve, but that meant that not all manuscripts were registered in an orderly or in an exact chronological way. After ample consideration I have decided to include references to Edi S. Ekadjati, Naskah Sunda. Inventarisasi dan Pencatatan. Bandung 1988. That work is meant to be a catalogue of Sundanese manuscripts, but it is written in a totally unorganized way, and it shows a vast quantity of imprecise indications and not seldom plain errors of every level on almost every page. I advise the reader of this volume, and of volume 9 for that matter, of this inventory to stay away from that book, but if he does not do so, I can only hope that the few corrections\n\nthat I have written down in my own descriptions of the manuscripts that Dr. Ekadjati has given in hios catalogue will suffice to him from stumbling into the most evident of mistakes. Another, yet very different, remark is necessary for the descriptions of Javanese manuscripts that Th.G.Th. Pigeaud has made. As the reader of the present volume will see, I have made abundant use of these. Pigeaud’s descriptions are often not more than a short series of keywords concerning the contents of a particular volume, whereas he usually mentions that an epitome (of in the hand of the former owner, C. Snouck Hurgronje) is available. For most of those manuscripts that I choose to describe by autopsy I have opted for a full English translation of the contents of these epitomes in Dutch, especially for the primbons, the notebooks. In the ideal case I should have done that for all manuscripts with such an epitome. However, for practical reasons that should wait for a later, updated version of the present volume (and part of volumes 7 and 9 as well). The huge amount of the manuscripts coming from the Snouck Hurgronje legacy of 1936 contain all sorts of information concerning earlier and previous provenances. It would have been useful to mention all of these in the present volume, but, again, for practical reasons I have not done so. Such information would have been very useful for a better knowledge of the history of the constitution of the Leiden collections, and it also would have contributed to a more detailed chronological overview of the life and work of Snouck Hurgronje in his DutchIndian period. I realize that I may have, by that decision, missed part of the internal coherence of the Snouck Hurgronje legacy, and I can ony hope that, at a later stage, I will be able to update my inventories in this way. I end with an important note. Although the inventories which I am publishing here contain descriptions of public and private collections, which will no doubt profit of the existence of electronic versions of my work, none of my inventories has ever been made at the express insistence or by the specific demand of these institutions. The very idea to compile such inventories, the invention of their structure, the acquisition of the necessary information from a multitude of primary and secondary sources, the way of publishing, all this is my idea and my work alone. It is therefore my sole property and I assert the moral right of the authorship of form and content of these inventories, with reference, of course, to what I have said elsewhere about the method of compilation. Prof. Jan Just Witkam, Interpres Legati Warneriani Emeritus\n\nLeiden, 15 December 2019\n\nINVENTORY OF THE ORIENTAL MANUSCRIPTS OF THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LEIDEN VOLUME 8 MANUSCRIPTS OR. 7001 – OR. 8000 REGISTERED IN LEIDEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN THE COURSE OF 1946 Continuation of MSS Leiden Or. 6977 - Or. 7121: mostly Arabic manuscripts of the Legacy of C.

Snouck Hurgronje from MS London, IOL, catalogue Loth, No. 667. See Voorhoeve, Handlist, p. 131. Provenance: C. Snouck Hurgronje legacy, 1936.

The same text as MS Calcutta, Catalogue Ivanow-Hidayat Husain, No. 814. According to Brockelmann, GAL S I, 923, a copy in the Asafiyya Library in Hyderabad mentions Fakhr al-Din al-Razi as the author, and the same attribution is found in a printed text with Urdu translation (Calcutta, n.d., but after 1847 [845 D 1], and probably a reprint of the edition Calcutta 1846, mentioned by J.F. Blumhardt, Catalogue of Hindustani books IOL, p. 257). Nur al-Din al-Raniri (d. 1658) mentions this work together with al-Durra al-Fakhira as written by al-Ghazzali (d. 505/1111), GAL G I, 423 (see P. Voorhoeve, ‘Three old Achehnese Manuscripts’, in BSOAS 14 (1952), pp. 335-345, esp. p. 342. It is identical with Ahwal al-Qiyama, edited by M. Wolff (Muhammedanische Eschatologie. Nach der Leipziger und der Dresdner Handschrift zum ersten Male arabisch und deutsch mit Anmerkungen hrsg. von M. Wolff. Leipzig 1872 [844 D 22]). Concerning the titles under which it is known and the various authors to which it is ascribed, see GAL S I, 346 (but the statement that al-Taftazani is quoted in it is erroneous), and G. Levi della Vida, Elenco … Vat., No. 242. Voorhoeve did not find any manuscript in the catalogues which was older than 866 AH (14611462, Berlin, Ahlwardt 2780). In the IOL manuscript and in the Calcutta edition, the part found in Wolff’s edition, p. 73, line 5 – p. 104, line 4, is missing. In the two Leiden copies from Java (MS Leiden Or. 5690 (11), above, and MS Leiden Or. 7164 (6), below), the lacuna at the same place is even larger. The present manuscript was copied from MS London, IOL, cat. Loth No. 690. The Persian interlinear notes have been left out. See Voorhoeve, Handlist, p. 57. Provenance: C.

Facsimile text on small pieces of transparant paper, pasted onto the verso sides or in the margins (e.g. f. 4b, 26a, 27a). (1) ff. 1a-25a.

Collated with L (= MS London, British Library, Or. 3138 (3)) and MS Berlin, Ahlwardt 5032. This manuscript was used for G. van Vloten, Tria opuscula auctore Abu Othman Amr Ibn Bahr al-Djahiz Basrensi, Leiden 1903, pp. 86-157. See Voorhoeve, Handlist, p. 369.

And a note from the Bnf, Paris, dated 20 December 1952, thanking for the loan of the present manuscript. Also a sketch drawing (black, green, red) of a naked person, seen from the back. Earlier provenance: Although this manuscript entered the Leiden library through the Snouck Hurgronje collection, it is possible that the manuscript first belonged to Gerlof van Vloten (1866-1903), the editor of several texts by al-Gahiz, and that it came after van Vloten’s death in the possession of M.J. de Goeje (1836-1909). From the latter’s collection it may have come into the possession of Snouck Hurgronje. Provenance: C. Snouck Hurgronje legacy, 1936.
