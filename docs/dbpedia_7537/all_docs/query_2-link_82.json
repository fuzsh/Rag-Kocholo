The focus of this study was emphasized in the context of the establishment, basic ideas, spirit, orientation, charity, implications, and a variety of aspects related to the presence or essence of Muhammadiyah as an Islamic reform movement. It’s been long time since the author considered to write about Muhammadiyah comprehensively with a focus on reform. The consideration was simple. On the one hand, it seems there is inadequate literature focused primarily on the reform of Muhammadiyah. At the same time, since the beginning, the character or nature of Muhammadiyah is a reform movement, so it will be definitely an important discourse and reference for both internal and external Muhammadiyah. In finalizing this book, the author deliberately wrote the article through MajalahSuaraMuhammadiyah on the Frame rubric. The first consideration was the discipline to maintain the writing’s spirit, and the second it remained framed in the initial intention to write Muhammadiyah as a reform movement in more comprehensive writing. Therefore, the material in this book was developed from the articles of MajalahSuaraMuhammadiyah and several new subchapters. A number of references were derived from books and documents of Muhammadiyah both the old and new literatures, which were intended to provide a more complete reference dealing with Muhammadiyah as a reform movement. The authors attempted to complete and as accurate as possible in writing this book, but it seems still far from perfect. After the publication, in the future, it will be comprehended, corrected, and improved after the availability of newer data and reference. Therefore, the authors look forward to feedback and criticism from the readers. However, through this book, at least the author tried to figure out and uncover the real Muhammadiyah as a reform movement.For the author, there always be a faith or understanding that examined from any angles, Muhammadiyah is a reform movement. The comprehensive exposure of Muhammadiyah will provide an obvious iii\n\ndescription of this organization established by Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan in 1912. However, whether this picture is an intact or merely a fraction, may be followed by the space for dialogue and discussion likewise other studies. In writing this book, the author definitely cannot be detached from the subjectivity as a Muhammadiyah’s activist, which is realized by the author. Nevertheless, the author gives his best effort to provide data, fact, and analysis based on argumentation, in which it is not intended as an apology. Experience as a Muhammadiyah’s activist and scientific spirit became the background of the author to write this book, which represented the inter-subjective experience of the author. In the social science, as the approach introduced by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, social reality is depicted to be less objective, but somehow becomes the meeting point between subjectivity and objectivity within the inter-subjectivity construction. It is expected that this book will present a new color ofMuhammadiyah as a reform movement from an internal figure and at the same time who attempt to make a distance. Eventually, by the publication of the book, the author would like to express the gratitude for everyone, particularly to MajalahSuaraMuhammadiyah. The author also expressed his gratitude to Mas Nurhadi, the library staff of Muhammadiyah Central Executive in Yogyakarta, who assisted the collection of data and shabby old books, as well as to the authors whose books became the references. This book is finally completed as the encouragement of the author’s closest and beloved companion: Noor, the author’s wife, and Hilma and Nuha, the author’s children. The author hoped that this book would give benefits, although, it might be merely a spark of thought. Nashrun min Allah waFathunQarib.

Deliar Noer, James L. Peacock, William Shepard and some scholars categorize Muhammadiyah as the Islamic modernism. Alfie and Wertheim classify it into the Islamic reformism. Abubakar Atjeh calls it a movement back to the Salaf (Muhyi Atsari al-Salaf). Clifford Geertz, George Kahin, Robert van Neil, and others, incorporate Muhammadiyah into the socio-cultural movement. The substance or content of these predicates although expressed in a variety of terms could be defined as the reform movement or tajdid. Basically, the nature of Muhammadiyah is tajdid or the reform movement. Despite some statements dealing with the reform of Muhammadiyah which was frequently claimed to be particularly distinguished in charity and ad-hoc suchasthe finding of precise direction of Qibla, the establishment of social institutions of education, social and health services, and others but the spirit and the basic idea owned by Kyai Dahlan rooted in tajdid or reform. No matter how it tends to be focussed on charity and particularly ad-hoc, eventually it deep-rooted in the basic ideas of reform derived from Kyai Dahlan as its founder. In addition, the reform of amaliah (actions/good deeds) also appears to have broader implications or effect on the reform, even it supposed to be a breakthrough at the time. Nurcholish Madjid (1990: 407)\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nasserted that despite the nuance of amaliah in the reform of Muhammadiyah, it ultimately points the real manifestations of Islam which is charity. In addition, even since the reform is not systematized in an complex and comprehensive framework which will be a redundant demand or assessment to be addressed to Kyai Dahlan the value of an idea although it seems simple and is not formed in an intact writing might be as precious as others, in addition to its high valued mosaic at that time. Especially after witnessing the impacts of the reform, which were actualized in a wide-range of success stories of Muhammadiyah movement, and still in on going process followed the decades of the establishment. Given the fact that reform is not merely seen from the nursery of the sparkling ideas, but also on the impact of the effect as well as the snowball effect of the reform initiated in the whole trip of Muhammadiyah movement in the amid of the era dynamics. It has been proven that decades after the seeds of reform, numbers of Islamic groups have followed Muhammadiyah’s footsteps, including its counterpart traditional groups. In a sense, Islam requires tajdid or the reform in the midst of this new era, indeed.\n\nA.\n\nReform Movement Muhammadiyah as a reform movement inherent in the recognition of the public objective and substantially (in terms of the content) at the same time, can be proven from the basic idea of Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan as the founder. Moreover, it can be referred to the solemn thought that is set forth or institutionalized in the organization movement as well as in the form of the good deeds integrated into the society life. These three aspects of reform are intertwined into the emergence of Muhammadiyah movement system as a reform movement in Indonesia in particular and in the Islamic world in a wider scale. Muhammadiyah reform has linked itself to the chain of Islamic reform movements in Indonesia as well as in the Islamic world, which marked the revival of Islam in the beginning of the 20th century. Kyai Dahlan, who studied traditional Islamic had settled and performed hajj in Mecca twice at the peak of Wahabi and certainly never experienced modern Western teaching, became a mujadid (reformer) precisely with the excellent idea beyond his boundaries of education and life experience. His\n\n2\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nreform concept and strides are represented by several breakthroughs such as the alignment of Qibla direction, Feast prayers on the open field, the understanding of tajdid, as well as his original initiative on the understanding and implementation of surah Al-Ma’un. Ahmad Dahlan also pioneered the importance of publication by establishing Suara Muhammadiyah magazine in 1915; modern Islamic education that combines Islamic studies and general knowledge through classical methods of Western; and founded Muhammadiyah scouting Pandu Hizbul Wathan in 1918. In addition, a quite monumental but less popular was his achievement in establishing the Islamic women’s movement, ‘Aisyiyah, in 1917 among the public who assumed it as a taboo. It was supposed to be a leap at the time. The thought of Kyai Dahlan might seem simple from the current point of view, but rich in substance and such a tremendous breakthrough at the time. Therefore, Nurcholish Madjid, who well-known as a main figure of Islamic neo-modernism and outstanding Islamic thinkers of Indonesian, fully respects Kyai Dahlan. Nurcholis Madjid (1983: 310) considered that the reform initiated by Ahmad Dahlan was a breakthrough or leap which was not preceded by any pre-conditions. It happened because Dahlan is the figure of a true seeker who was able to capture the soul of Al-Manar and to actualize it within the era. Despite some people view Ahmad Dahlan as a prominent man of action and his splash of thinking is solely narrow as mentioned by Kyai Hadjid in Seven Philosophy Teachings of Kyai Ahmad Dahlan and Seventeen Group Qur’anic verse, what Nurcholish Madjid has been stated is an objective statement upon the ideas and work of the founder of Muhammadiyah. Muhammadiyah and Kyai Dahlan as the founder are frequently associated to the link of Islamic reform movement in the Islamic world, as pioneered by Ibn Taymiyyah, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, Jamaluddin al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and Rashid Ridha in the hopper of Islamic modernism or reformism of the 20th century. Despite a number of reform points as pioneered by Kyai Dahlan, it has its own characteristics which differs it from other reform movement and character in the Islamic world, in addition, the association of Muhammadiyah with other Islamic world reform movements has strengthened the i dentity and public recognition of the nature, position, and role of Muhammadiyah as an Islamic reform movement. However, the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nreform movement of Kyai Dahlan and Muhammadiyah had contributed to the revival of Islam which was shuffled from underdevelopment and colonization. Spirit and original idea of Muhammadiyah can be traced back from the objective formulation enclosed in the first Statuten which was formulated and proposed to the Government of the Dutch East Indies in 1912. According to KyaiSudja’ (2009: 75), the Statuten was proposed after the Islamic organization was declared in Loodge Gebauw Malioboro, Yogyakarta on Saturday night of the last week of December 1912 a hundred year ago. In Statuten Muhammadiyah (Article 2) it is stated that the objectives of Muhammadiyah were: a. To spread the teachings of the Religion of His Majesty Prophet Muhammad (May the Lord bless him and give him peace) among the indigenous inhabitants in the Residency of Yogyakarta, and b. To promote the religious life to the members (Muhammadiyah Statuten, 1912). The term of to promote is a powerful sign of Islam spirit of reform which is supported and packaged with disseminating attempt of expansive da’wah. Since then, the term of Islamic modernism continues to stand as a reform message of Muhammadiyah, which was often put forward by Kyai Mas Mansur at his leadership era (1938-1942) and later was incorporated in the decree of the 37th Muhammadiyah Congress of 1968 in Yogyakarta as one of the characteristics of Islamic society that is “dynamic”. In da’wah, Muhammadiyah cannot be separated from the spirit of reform. The breakthrough of the initial generation was the quite prominent da’wah in actions or deeds (da’wah bi lisan al-hal or da’wahbil-hal) instead of merely using verbal da’wah or tabligh (da’wah bi lisan al-maqal or da’wah bi-lisan) which were comprehended in Al-Ma’un movement on charity and services for the poor, and in the spheres of education, health, social services and community empowerment. Verbal da’wah, nevertheless, was updated into a non-conventional method, among others is the emergence of Suara Muhammadiyah magazine (1915) and numerous publications which was a new phenomenon propaganda since most of da’wah was done in one way communication. The establishment of PKO (Penolong Kesengsaraan Oemoem, or literaly, Assistance for the Relief of Public Suffering) which later became PKU (PembinaKesejahteraanUmat) or Weisshouse as the orphanage and service for the poor, were the evidence of the reform in\n\n4\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nda’wah by Muhammadiyah. Muhammadiyahda’wah reached a new realm by founding the women’s movement of ‘Aisyiyah in 1917, which put Muslim women as perpetrator in social religious movement. Yet the religious figure and the society were gender bias and put women in a domestic area like the common character of patriarchal culture dominance. In other words, Muhammadiyahda’wah is not merely a call or preaching, but in a broader sense, it patterns a social civic and position Islam as a religion of liberation, empowerment, and enlightenment within the society. Islam is presented in amaliah institutionalized in the society rather than simply verbal and literature, so it can be considered as a new form of Islamic social order. In the beginning of the establishment, Muhammadiyah as a reform movement had to face the opposition from the traditionalist which presume it for bringing up a new ideology but later it attracted the public attention within ten years after its establishment in 1912 and grew rapidly afterward. In 1922, ten years after its establishment and a year before Kyai Dahlan passed away, Muhammadiyah as an organization of Islamic reform had been widespread to various areas outside Yogyakarta indicated by the emerge of the early generations in Pekalongan, Garut, Padang Panjang, Makasar, in some areas in East Java, and so on. Furthermore, in 1927 it even grew over Indonesia or the Dutch East Indies at the time, such as in Alabio (South Kalimantan), a number of regions in Celebes, and Sumatra, including Aceh. In the early 1930s, Muhammadiyah went through the eastern part of Indonesia among them were the area in Nusa Tenggara Timur as in Ende and Flores. Da’wah and charitable activities of Muhammadiyah continued to grow bigger and larger. After Indonesia’s independence in 1945, Muhammadiyah even grew and infiltrated the entire sphere of the nation, in which Muhammadiyah became a large, even the largest, modern Islamic organization in Indonesia.\n\nB.\n\nThe Largest Organization A century after the establishment, Muhammadiyah has grown and developed into the largest Islamic organization in Indonesia as well as in the Islamic world. In various forums, The Chairman of Muhammadiyah, Din M. Syamsuddin, conveyed his testimony during his visit to the United States that the media called Muhammadiyah as The Largest Islamic Reformist Organization.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nNurcholish Madjid (1990: 331), from the standpoint of succeeded charitable efforts of Muhammadiyah, stated that the Islamic movement established by Kyai Dahlan as the largest modern Muslim organizations in Indonesia, as well as in the Islamic world. James L. Peacock, an anthropologist of the United States, pointed that Muhammadiyah is the strongest Islamic organization in Southeast Asia. In addition, ‘Aisyiyah is the largest women’s organization in the world. James L. Peacock (1986: 26) described the organization, as follows: “In the half century since the reform development in the Southeast Asia, the movement grew in various ways in the diverse regions. Only in Indonesia Muslim reform movement becomes a major and regular force. In the early 20th century, there were a several minor movements, Indonesian reform joined into few regionalist movements and a strong national movement, Muhammadiyah. With hundreds of branch throughout the islands and millions of members across the country, Muhammadiyah is the strongest Islamic movement in the Southeast Asia. As a movement that promotes in purifying true Islam, Muhammadiyah has also given a great contribution in the field of social and education, health care, orphanage, in addition to thousands of schools which assign Muhammadiyah as a private non-christian institution of social, religious, and education in Indonesia. The women’s organization, Aisyiyah, is perhaps the largest Islamic women’s movement in the world. Shortly, Muhammadiyah is a major and the most powerful organization in the fifth largest country of the world “. The statement regarding to the strength of Muhammadiyah is scientific objectively significant to provide another perspective, since Muhammadiyah is frequently assumed as the second largest Islamic organization in Indonesia assessed from the quantity of the members. Given the evidence that Muhammadiyah might be the second largest organization in membership, it is appropriate to place Muhammadiyah in the first rank when modernism and charity efforts within the society become the parameters. It is important to be a concern due to categorization without any objective criteria and merely rely on public opinion is difficult to be called a scientific assessment, as well as it has implications in upgrading the one and degrading another. The claim of greatness is actually insignificant, particularly for Islamic movements with ongoing strategic agenda for the people and nation. However, in the context of a comparison between organizations, obvious parameters are required instead\n\n6\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nof simply relying on the estimation or common sense of membership, which implies the parameter of quantity instead of quality. Muhammadiyah definitely can be noticed as the largest Islamic organization in Indonesia certainly, if despite the number of members (quantity), the parameter is altered into the quality aspect of charitable efforts, human resources, and the influence of the reform movement. Categorizing an organization as the largest derived from the ascertain number of members is obviously a form of reduction in assessing the existence of a movement, objectively. It will be more objective when an organization is recognized from its comprehensive aspects more or less depends on the basis of assessment to avoid an absolute justification. Muhammadiyah might be the most powerful in certain aspects, while other Islamic movements might also be the largest in their specific aspects, therefore it can be concluded that assessment is factual and relative, that is based on reality and relative existence. James L. Peacock, Nurcholish Madjid, and other experts certainly indicate particular objectivity in measuring the quality of Muhammadiyah, and it is possible that they also apply other analysis in assessing the quality of other organizations outside Muhammadiyah. Criticism dealing with the parameter in measuring the power of a movement or organization is essentially required to be re-evaluated in a discourse, not for the aim of snobbery or questioning something that leads to fanaticism, but for the sake of analysis objectivity beyond the public opinion which has been already constructed in the status-quo as evolved over the years. The U.S. media ratings as quoted by Din Syamsuddin and the statements of Nurcholish Madjid and James L. Peacock could be viewed as a new discourse which is more objective in assessing the existence of a socioreligious movement in the interest of scholarly objectivity. As for the interest on ukhuwah (the bond or relation between people), cooperation, and synergy among the Islamic organizations as well as religious and social organizations in Indonesia and the world in general, it becomes another consideration of sociological interests in building collective life order instead of scholarly study interest. Similarly, current development of Islamic organizations endures a kind of quality convergence in which the trend of thought and action surely is another area of the present study. Nowadays as Muslim organizations,\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nboth advanced and recent, enclose more proliferating ideas and works than Muhammadiyah, it has incapability to consign Muhammadiyah in the second class organization. Given the fact, at the same time, the Islamic movement which was born in Kauman Yogyakarta Kauman in the past century also had experienced the dynamics of thought and progress. While some cursory analyses are often based on salient and controversial thing: one thing is often unrecalled that movement and civilization never take place suddenly, they require long-term intense dynamic process and struggle. Muhammadiyah with its advantages and disadvantages had a well-built footprint due to its growth and enhancement leading to an organized and systemized movement, hence, it has positive and constructive capital to build forthcoming civilization. A movement relying on a system is typically stronger than those which worship figure and community, although each Islamic movement in Indonesia has its own characteristic. An Islamic movement may have its specific superiority according to its speciality and orientation in advancing the life quality of the people, the nation, and mankind civilization\n\nC.\n\nDimension of Reform Muhammadiyah as a modern reformist Islamic organization is apparently positioned in a distinguished position and historical role in Indonesia, as well as in the world. This review, however, should not be eliminated with the advent of neo-modernism of Islam in 1980 which was assumed to be more affluent in ideas, as the pioneered trail of modernism or reformism in the early 20th century by Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan which was marked by the establishment of Muhammadiyah and other modern Islam movements were not less controversial. Milestones will always be crucial and valuable even when they are compared to the newer ones since they are the foundation and forerunner. It will be unwise if Islamic modernism or reformism in the early 20th century is compared to neo-modernism in the late 20th and the early 21st century. Nonetheless, it is required for the analysis on correlation and shifting of the chain of Islamic movement dynamics, with is aimed to figure out progressive works of reform. The criteria of modern and reformist Muhammadiyah, frequently adhoc, are considered to be more limited than the comprehensive thought of 8\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nthe present. It is essential to note that the ad-hoc reform at that time surely cannot be compared to the ample thoughts or reform of decades later as the times have been much different. Assessment should be put in proportion that in very limited circumstances and in backwardness era of Islamic world, Muhammadiyah was able to make a breakthrough of tajdid or reform, which turned out to be surprising and gained opposed reaction from the Traditionalist at the time. Phenomenon indicated that reform movement with its ad-hoc characteristic, also had a powerful spirit and ideas of breakthrough, thus it had to receive a tenacious opposition. The nuance of Islamic modernism or reformism is the most significant benchmark in assessing the influence and strength of Muhammadiyah, precisely after the dynamics of journey attached upon the identity and exclusivity of the Islamic movement established by Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan. Muhammadiyah movement in 1912 had generated several outcomes which forged tajdid or Islamic reform movement in Indonesia in particular and the Islamic world in general. Its ability to survive for a century and its influential range in social sphere as modern reformist Islamic movement with its tidal dynamics in their path has incised something precious for the revival of Islam in Indonesia. In the context of the Muhammadiyah society, it has shifted the traditional into a modern society. This book attempts to reveal Muhammadiyah as an Islamic reform movement in various aspects. The author wants to divulge the other side of Muhammadiyah which has been less utterly discussed and often biased since its reform movement shows a number of dimensions. Muhammadiyah movement will be analyzed from multi-aspects by presenting review regarding with the spirit of establishment, the figure of the founder Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan, the history with the world Islamic reform movements, and particular character or identity of Muhammadiyah. In addition, the religion, ideology, Khittah, thoughts and actions of da’wah, tajdid, Islamic society, Muhammadiyah women’s movement, organizational development and charitable efforts, as well as the future of Muhammadiyah. In some cases, the principles of Muhammadiyah are analyzed in the context of its establishment epoch, to give a tone of its movement dynamics in the midst of the age. With the exposure of these aspects, it is expected that Muhammadiyah will be portrayed in a complete and thorough reform movement, even if it is not entirely intact.

It was proposed to be granted by The Dutch East Indies in AD, or Dzulhijjah 8, 1330 in Islamic calendar. Founder of Muhammadiyah is devout intellect reformist teacher, Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan, born Muhammad Darwisy. Muhammadiyah was established in the form of legalized organization or association, called Persyarikatan under the name of “Persjarikatan Moehammadijah”. The term of Persyarikatan, on Berita Tahoenan in 1927 was explained as: “Sjarikat means a group of people to carry out the aim collectively, along with the non-members as well as the donors, who respect Muhammadiyah and work cooperatively; as if they own Muhammadiyah by taking similar responsibility. It is the magnitude of Muhammadiyah which obtain so much attention, like a light in the dark which brings and implements the true Islamic religion.” ((Muhammadiyah Central Executive, 1929: 30). It was affirmed that “Establishing an association for good deeds is allowed in Islam, such as in: trade, agriculture, animal husbandry, and so on; the yield as well as the loss is endured by each member of the association. Collective people in an association to perform religious duties which must be endured collectively (fardhukifayah) is not only allowed; it is even commanded by Allah Ta’ala in The Qu’ran Surah Ali-Imran verse 104. “(ibid: 28).\n\nThe Establishment\n\n11\n\nSteadily, Muhammadiyah is widely known by the public as well as researchers and writers as the Islamic reform movement or tajdid. Its nature of tajdid also known as the reform and Islamic modernism movement, scopes in realizing the real Islam is inherent with the spirit of progress and modernity. In addition to tajdid or da’wah, this organization has engaged in disseminating and embodying Islam in various aspects of society, except in the political realm. Da’wah, for instance, is conducted prevalently through da’wahbil-hal such as education, health care, social services, economic and other charitable efforts that are directly beneficial for society instead of merely sermons or bi-lisan preaching.\n\nA.\n\nThe Meaning of Muhammadiyah Muhammadiyah, literally means “follower of Muhammad”, was previously named in Indonesian old spelling “Moehamaddijah”. In the 19th Congress of 1330 in Minangkabau referred to the 14th Congress the spelling of the organization was confirmed, which was “MOEHAMMADIJAH”. After The Indonesian Independence, the perfected spelling is used which changed the name into “Muhammadiyah”, as it is applied as default afterward. From the beginning, the suffix syllable of the name is only a letter of “j” or “y”, which is “Moehammadijah” or “Muhammadiyah”, instead of “Moehammadijjah” or “Muhammadiyyah”. This one letter of “ja” or “ya” is reasonable due to its convert into Bahasa as well as its accurate oral pronunciation, it was deliberately preferred by Kyai Dahlan and his companions since Kyai Dahlan was highly proficient in Arabic. Thus, the name of “Moehammadijah” or “Muhammadiyah” becomes a terms in Bahasa with the nuance of Indonesianness since the beginning of its establishment. As it is now undisputed and has been pronounced as “Muhammadiyah”, it is because its originality which has been legalized on the Articles of Statuten and Bylaw since its establishment. A change was made solely from the old spelling of “Moehammadijah” to the new spelling of “Muhammadiyah”. The selection of the name and the writing has been fused with the Indonesian sense that has become the standard name of MOEHAMADIJJAH or MUHAMMADIYAH. It is better to shift the discourse into the issue of the spirit and ideas, the more fundamental ones.\n\n12\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nThe name of “Muhammadiyah” io s intended to ascribe or connect the organization with the religion and the struggle path of Muhammad the Prophet. According to Kyai Syuja (20019: 77), it had been considered and decided by Kyai Dahlan himself after Istikharah prayers at the time his adherents and companions encouraged him to establish an organization which would realize his reform ideas. Kyai Syuja, as Kyai Dahlan’s close companions, stated that Kyai Dahlan considered the name as: “It is taken from the name of Muhammad, the Last Prophet and Apostle, as our role model. The expectation is hopefully, Muhammadiyah becomes the everlasting pilgrim, like Muhammad as the Last Prophet and Apostle. “Ya” in the name shall mean any person who became a member of Muhammadiyah can adjust her/himself to the personality of Prophet Muhammad”. Despite the word of Muhammadiyah (Muhammadiyyat), with “ta marbuthah”, indicates “mu’anats” (signified for women), Kyai Dahlan replied this question from Kyai Syuja that: “Muhammadiyah is not a woman’s name, it means the ummah of Prophet Muhammad, the followers of Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah” (Salam, 1968: 11). The ascription of Muhammadiyah to Prophet Muhammad according to H. Djarnawi Hadikusuma (ny: 7) implies that: “With the name, he intends to explain that the organization is supported by the ummah of Muhammad, and the principle is Islam, the religion which was brought by the Messenger. Whereas the goal is to understand and to implement Islam as taught and exemplified by the Prophet in order to live the world throughout the willingness of Islam. Thus the sacred and true Islamic can accelerate the advancement of the Muslims and the Indonesian in general “. In the tafsir(Quranic exegesis) of Ibn Kathir, the term of al-’ummat al-Muhammadiyyah is mentioned as the classic wayfarer describes the Qu’ran Surah Ali Imran verse 110: “You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient.” (Surah Ali Imran [3: 110]). In explaining this verse, Ibn Kathir stated that: yahbaru ta’âla ‘an hazdihi al-Ummâh al-Muhammadiyâh bi annahum khairâ al-ummâm, the revelation of God that the people of Prophet Muhammad is the best nation/ummah (Kathir, Section I: 391). Basically,\n\nThe Establishment\n\n13\n\nMuhammadiyah can be considered to be objectively referred if it is associated to the message of classical Islam of tafsir. Whether Kyai Dahlan was inspired from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, scientifically, the name of the Muhammadiyah has reference to Islamic repertory Sociologically, Kyai Dahlan named and chose the term of Muhammadiyah without any intention on enlarging ashabiyah a group fanaticism leads to Islamic exclusiveness. The truth is there is no fanaticism in which any people who follows the footsteps of Prophet Muhammad, in general, can be assumed as the follower of the Prophet. Nevertheless, the selection of the name to legalize the Islamic movement cannot be considered either to exaggerate ashabiyah or disintegrate the Muslims, since Muhammadiyah is positioned and functioned as a means or a tool to achieve the aim of Islam, to embody a true Islamic society. It supposes to be irrelevant if there is an opinion that a specific name for an Islamic organization is not required, except the name of Islam. Muhammadiyah is, substantively and connotatively, Islam and born to be an Islamic movements and interests. Hence, whether an organization or movement uses Muhammadiyah or another name on its presence, as far as it is intentionally established, projected, framed and aimed for the sake of Islam and Muslims, then it is licit and by no means to enclosure or divide Islam. If an organization is named Islam, for instance harakah Islamiyah or other Islamic organization labelled names, thus the organization both from the management and the movement surely has limited itself. Principally, it is not the name or the title which makes an organization essential, it is the nature and orientation of the movements that matters. It is attached to the meaning and characteristics of Muhammadiyah as an organization or movement is the symbol of Muhammadiyah. In the Muhammadiyah Statutes of Article 5 of Chapter II of 2005, it is stated that “The symbol of Muhammadiyah is a sun having twelve primary lights with the word Muhammadiyah in the middle that is circled by the two Arabic sentences expressing the Muslim creed (Asyhadu an lã ilãha illa Allãh wa asyhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allãh)”. The Articlr 2 of Bylaws explains the meaning of the symbol and flag of Muhammadiyah as follows: Symbol of Muhammadiyah as mentioned in Statutes article 5 is as follows:\n\n14\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nFlag of Muhammadiyah is rectangular measuring two to three with the picture of Muhammadiyah symbol in the middle. There is the word MUHAMMADIYAH below the symbol with green colour for the background and white colour for the text and picture, as follows:\n\nOther provisions concerning the symbol and flag are stipulated by Central Executive. Symbol and flag depicted and described above apparently show characteristics that distinguish Muhammadiyah from other Islamic movements. Symbol is a sign and signifier with its symbolic meaning for members of Muhammadiyah which makes it a part of the identification of the movement. In Indonesia, both in urban and rural areas, the symbol of Muhammadiyah along with its autonomous organizations and institutions is clearly displayed which shows the presence or absence of Muhammadiyah in the local area. Symbol is also a part of the Muhammadiyah spirit for the members. In addition to the symbol, Muhammadiyah has a set of instrument as a bound of the movements, such as the song. Despite the song was created later after the establishment, it is certainly a powerful adhesive of Muhammadiyah member collective psychology. Songs of the Sun, for instance, becomes very popular and embedded in the minds, thoughts, and feelings of the members, as well as the spirit. The content of the song is passionate, representing the dynamic Islamic movement, a part of the reform spirit of Muhammadiyah which tirelessly lights up the life like the sun shines up the earth and the universe. At the establishment on November 18, 1912, the purposes of Muhammadiyah are formulated as follows: a. To spread the teachings of the Religion of His Majesty Prophet Muhammad (May the Lord bless him and give him peace) among the indigenous inhabitants in the Residency\n\nThe Establishment\n\n15\n\nof Yogyakarta, and b. To promote the religious life to the members (Muhammadiyah Statuten, 1912). Despite Muhammadiyah was founded on the date and declared in the public meeting on December 20, 1912 in Gedoeng Loodge Gebauw Malioboro, it was not automatically obtained a legal recognition from the government of the Dutch East Indies which was extremely cautious and suspicious in giving permission. It was the assistance of Boedi Oetomo and through a long process that Muhammadiyah was finally approved which was recorded on Besluit Number 81 on August 22, 1914 as a legal entity capable to perform its endeavour among Muslims in the residency of Yogyakarta (Library and Documentation PP Muhammadiyah, 1995: 22). The formulation of purposes is called “Means of Association (MaksudPersyarikatan)” attestation results of the Dutch Indies were listed as follows: “a. to promote and encourage the teaching and learning of Islam in the Netherlands East Indies, and b. to promote and encourage (way of life) along a willingness of Islam to its members” (Muhammadiyah Statuten, 1914). The content or substance of the purposes had not changed until Kyai Dahlan passed away in 1923 and afterwards in 1943 during the Japanese occupation and in the early independence days in 1946. At the time of Japanese period, the purposes of Muhammadiyah were as follows: “In accordance with the trust to establish prosperity in the entire of Asia Raya, under the leadership of Dai Nippon, and indeed commanded by the God, the organization’s purposes as follows: a. To spread Islam as well as to teach live in harmony with guidance, b. To conduct good deeds for the public virtues, c. To promote knowledge and understanding as well as good deeds to its members; all of which are intended to educate the public”. At the time of independence in 1946, the objectives were as follows: The objective and endeavour of the organization is to uphold and revere Islam so as to realize a real Islamic society (Badawi, 1998). The adjustment of the content and editorial in the Japanese period was almost similar to later endurance in 1985 when it had to adjust the five principle of Pancasila due to the policy regime. In 1946, which was then confirmed at the congress in 1952, Muhammadiyah for the first time includes the purpose of the establishment of “the real Islamic society”. The concept was continued to the present, except in the Congress of 1985 in\n\n16\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nwhich the concept was replaced although it had similar essence by “a just and prosperous virtuous society blessed by the Almighty God”. These varied and dynamic objective formulations as the response toward the regime power and sociological conditions at the time, show both the flexibility and intelligence of Muhammadiyah in dealing with uptight circumstances. If the objective is elaborated in detail, the word “promote” in addition to the word “spread”, since 1914 has been added with the word “encourage” in the article of objective and endeavour of Muhammadiyah. These keywords are always included in the “Muhammadiyah Statuten”, in the period of Kyai Dahlan to 1946 i.e. 1912, 1914, 1921, 1931, and 1941. From the point of view of Djarnawi Hadikusuma, these simple words actually imply very deep and ample sense, that in the era of Muslims backwardness and deterioration to true teachings of Islam, the Muhammadiyah successfully uncover and explores the pure Islamic teachings and advise the Muslims in general to learn, and to the ulema to teach, in a desirable and encouraging atmosphere. The word “promote” recalls to the meaning of “tajdid” or “reform”, and the spirit of progress. As for the word “spread” obviously implies the spirit of expansion or dissemination, or has similar substances and connotations with da’wah.\n\nB.\n\nThe Factor of Ahmad Dahlan The establishment of Muhammadiyah cannot be separated with its founder, Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan, as it is the manifestation of the idea and charity efforts of him. After performing Hajj in Mecca in 1889 and settled for the second time, Kyai Dahlan began to grow the seeds of reform up in the country. This reform idea was gained from his period of study in Mecca, in which the teacher were originality from Indonesia, i.e. Sheikh Ahmad Khatib from Minangkabau, Kyai Nawawi from Banten, Kyai Mas Abdullah from Surabaya, and Kyai Fakih from Maskumambang; as well as he had been much affected by the writings of Islamic reformers i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, Jamaluddin al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and Rashid Ridha. Along with intelligence and fine interaction during his staying in Saudi Arabia and the inspired writings of the Islamic reformers, Kyai Dahlan went back to Indonesia with the germ of reform thought.\n\nThe Establishment\n\n17\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia, Kyai Dahlan carried out the spirit, ideas, reform movement, instead of conservative scheme. It is interesting, Ahmad Dahlan, who was born in the tradition of the ‘traditional’ and Javanese Palace culture filled with “grip” of the traditional conservative, went on the pilgrimage and settled in solid Wahhabism influenced country, and still he returned to the homeland as a reformer figure. It might seem it was impossible, except, he had the “energy” of critical intellectuals and the thirst for reform since the beginning. Apparently, Ahmad Dahlan was not keen on dogmatic science, despite learning in the historical center of Islamic power which was then condensed with rigid and stiff Islamic practice. Ahmad Dahlan is the figure of “the essential truth seekers, who captures what is implied in the interpretation of Al Manar”, as well as an unique reform as “his effort is not preceded by an introduction or particular pre-conditions” (Majdid, 1983: 310). The embryo of Muhammadiyah as an organization to realize his ideas in a social discourse was the result of the discussion between Kyai Dahlan and his colleagues from Boedi Oetomo especially who interested in the issue of religion brought up by Kyai Dahlan R. Budiharjo and R. Sosrosugondo. The idea was also a suggestion of one of his students in Kweek school Jetis where Kyai taught religion as the extracurricular of the school. The students often came to Kyai’s house and suggested that educational activities initiated by Kyai Dahlan would be better if was institutionalized instead of managing by Kyai himself, since there would be a continuity as Kyai passed away one day. Adaby Darban, an historian of UGM, found out that the name of “Muhammadiyah” was originally proposed by a relative and companion of Kyai Dahlan, Muhammad Sangidu the Sermon Giver in Sultan’s Mosque (Ketib Anom) and a reformist who later became the chief of the religious bureaucracy (Penghulu) inKraton. Meanwhile, the name was decided Kyai Dahlan once after his Istikharah prayer (Darban, 2000: 34). Given the fact the option to establish Muhammadiyah involved a high dimensional spiritualism as the nature of mind and the religious practices of the scholars or ulema prevailingly grew at the time. According to Adaby Darban (2000: 13), the concept of Muhammadiyah organization in addition to actualize the reform thought of Kyai Dahlan, is as practical-organizational to accommodate and overarch Islamic Elementary School Diniyah Islamiyah (Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Diniyah Islamiyah), which\n\n18\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nwas founded on December 1, 1911. This school was an advanced pilot from “school” (Kyai Dahlan’s activities in teaching explaining Islam), in which he taught his students informally with various subject from Islam to general knowledge, on the veranda of his house. According to Djarnawi Hadikusuma, the school built in Kauman Yogyakarta was a “Muhammadiyah School”, a religious learning process which instead of conducted in the mosque as the general activities of Muslims at the time, was held at a building belonged to the father of Kyai Dahlan. Facilitated by tables and blackboards, Kyai Dahlan taught the religion in a new way, along with other general sciences. As an idealistic, according to Djarnawi (wy: 68) the idea of establishing Muhammadiyah came from Kyai Dahlan himself encouraged by a verse in the Qur’an, which is Surah Al-Imran verse 104: “Wal takum minkum ummatuy yad’uuna ilal khairi wa ya’muruuna bil ma’ruufi wa yanHauna ‘anil munkari wa ulaa-ika Humul muflihuun (And let there be (arising) from you a nation inviting to (all that is) good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful) (QS Ali-Imran [3:104)”. Therefore on November 18, 1912, or 8 Dzulhijah 1330 in Islamic calendar in Yogyakarta, he finally established an organization named “Moehammadijah” From the above explanation, it can be retrieved that the establishment of Muhammadiyah is attached to the attitudes, thoughts, and actions of Kyai Dahlan as the founder. Dahlan is able to integrate an understanding of Islam to return to the Qur’an and the Sunnah with tajdid as the orientation that leads ijtihad for a progress, so as to give a distinctive character of the establishment and development of Muhammadiyah in the future. Kyai Dahlan, as well as other Islamic reformers, with their exceptional typical, had ideals in liberating Muslims from underdevelopment and build a progressive life. The idea is realized through tajdid (reform) which covers numerous aspects of tawhid, ibadah, mu’amalah, and understanding of Islamic teachings and Muslims life, emphasizing the authority of Qur’an and Sunnah, toward individual interpretation of Qur’an and sunnah (ijtihad). Adaby Darban (2000: 31) concluded his research findings as follows: “In the field of monotheism, K.H.A. Dahlan wants to purify: the Islamic faith from the effects of shirk; the worship (ibadah) from bid’ah; in commercial and civil acts or dealings under Islamic law (muamalah) from khurafat; as well as in understanding the Islamic teachings in which he remodelled taqlid the\n\nThe Establishment\n\n19\n\nacceptance of the traditional interpretations propounded by the ulema and advocated ijtihad individual interpretation of Qur’an and sunnah. Although in this case there were some reviewers of Muhammadiyah i.e. Abdul Munir Mulkhan who had recorded that the purification by the eradication of superstition, bid’ah, and khurafat was not performed totally by Kyai Dahlan; even though basically in the terms of the creed and worship Kyai Dahlan indeed emphasized the authority of the Qur’an and Sunnah as the sole legitimate basis for the interpretation of religious belief and practice. According to Deliar Noer, Kyai Dahlan and Muhammadiyah are also more moderate and tend to be hearty compared to other Islamic movements such as Persatuan Islam. Kyai Dahlan’s reform idea has an aspect of purification in refine the creed from shirk, bid’ah, khufarat, and superstition, also in the religious practice. The most popular example is the finding of the exact direction of Qibla. In 1898, Kyai Dahlan tried to convince 17 ulema in Yogyakarta regarding to the exact qibla direction, by making 5-cm white line in the great mosque of Kauman Yogyakarta, but he failed and only made a fuss. He, then, renovated his family’s mosque and had it as a prayer space using the exact Qibla direction, although it was forcedly damaged by the indigenous people of Kauman after the prohibition from Penghulu with the reason it had different Qibla direction with the great mosque of Kraton Yogyakarta. A similar idea can be demonstrated in the aspect of worship, namely the implementation of the festive prayer Idul Fitri and Idul Adha in the open field, which initially faced lots of resistance, but finally was followed by the people. The phenomenon of these two prayers in the open field becomes the characteristics of Muhammadiyah, but eventually become a common practice of Muslims in Indonesia. It is interesting, that the alignment direction of Qibla in addition contains the aspect of purification, also the aspect of reformation due to its application of the science of astronomy in understanding and practicing the teachings of Islam. The pioneer of modern education, that combines religious studies and general sciences, is among them which are considered as “reform”. According to Kuntowijoyo, education initiated by Kyai Dahlan, is a kind of reform which is capable to integrate aspects of “faith” and “modern” in order to produce educated generation of Muslims who are able to live\n\n20\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nin the modern era without tearing their personality up (Kuntowijoyo, 1985: 36). Modern Islamic educational institutions even become the main feature of the establishment and development of Muhammadiyah, which distinguishes it from the other Islamic boarding schools (Pesantren) at the time. Later, modern Islamic education is implemented and adopted to be general Islamic educational institution. It was a successful reform movement producing educated generation of Muslims, although, if it was compared to the achievement of the present generation of Muslims it would be different due to its disparate context. The original Islam reform movement of Kyai Dahlan can be referred to the understanding and practice of Surat Al-Ma’un. The message on Surat Al-Ma’un, is another example of the most monumental social-welfare charityoriented reform, which produces the institution of Penolong Kesengsaraan Oemoem (PKO). It is called “transformative theology” in contemporary Islamic discourse, the view of Islam based on monotheism and human liberating and empowering practices. In this perspective of transformative, Islamic teaching despite solely deals with a set of worship rituals and Godhuman-interaction (hablu min Allah), it involves directly in overcoming concrete problems of society. This is the typical theology of Kyai Dahlan and Muhammadiyah, as a manifestation of reform idea and movement in Indonesia. The practice of Al-Ma’un, even though seems very simple, representing the institutionalized Islamic teaching in a social movement with its character of empowering and liberating. The movement of Al-Ma’un turns out to be an innovation without any preceding Islam reform movement. This is, undeniable, a inimitable reform movement by Kyai Dahlan and Muhammadiyah. By establishing Muhammadiyah, Kyai Dahlan had fortressed the Muslims for not being the victim of Zending Christian, by smart and elegant way instead of straight confrontation. Kyai, in several occasions, enquired some priests in Yogyakarta for having directly and plainly discussion and debate. By an indulgent on the similarity of Al-Qur’an with previous Holy Books, Kyai Dahlan suggested and encouraged “Ummah of Islam to examine the entire religion, rationally, to figure out the inherent truth of each religious teaching”. Kyai Dahlan, for instance, assumed that dialogue regarding to Christian was permitted to be held in the mosque (Jainuri, 2002: 78). It could\n\nThe Establishment\n\n21\n\nbe considered as both intellect and courageous, since it was an objective competition in religious movement. Kyai Dahlan himself had avoided confrontation but tended to competition in doing good deeds (fastabiqulkhairat) with a strong belief that if Islam is believed, understood, practiced properly Islam will be able to overreach others. Reform spirit of Kyai Dahlan by establishing Muhammadiyah was accompanied by the foundation of women’s movement of ‘Aisyiyah in 1917. The basic idea of this movement is that instead of just staying in domestic area, women should be given opportunity to contribute in the society, particularly to develop Islamic teaching as well as to improve their quality of life. It diverged the reform movement by Kyai Dahlan to other reformers i.e. Afghani, Abduh, Ahmad Khan, and other reformers (Ali, 2000: 349-353). This breakthrough represented wide-ranged mind-set and vision of Islam of Kyai Dahlan, associated with the role and function of woman as the yield of his intellectual spirit of tajdid even since he had never been acquainted with feminism in nowadays. It is an evidence the progressive thought of Kyai Dahlan who founded Muhammadiyah as a movement in refining and modernizing Islam. Muhammadiyah has presented a spacious dimension of Islam. According to Djarnawi, Kyai Dahlan through Muhammadiyah has revealed the Face of Islam as “a system of mankind life with its entire angles”. Kyai Dahlan in teaching Islam was truly profound, generous, critic, and intellect. Kyai Dahlan suggested the Muslims to pursue the essential truth, whether bad or good deeds, to eliminate blindly, consider and rationalize the essential of life, think either theoretically and practically (Hadjid, 2005). Kyai Dahlan persuaded the Muslim not to be taqlid the teaching of Islam as they had received, moreover, they had to comprehend Islam to the root by optimally exploit their common sense and ijtihad. In appreciating Al-Qur’an, as illustrated by Kyai Dahlan in divulging Al-Ma’un, the founder of Muhammadiyah suggested his pupils to learn the verses of Al-Qur’an one by one, two to three verses, to read and to examine with tartil and tadabbur: “What is the meaning? What is the interpretation? What is the message? Is it a prohibition and have you obey this prohibition? Is it an obligation and have we performed this obligation?”. This model of learning process was followed by KH. Mas Mansyur a devout intellect\n\n22\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nMuhammadiyah figure and a scholar of Al-Azhar Cairo who is well-known for his high perspective in various matters of life.\n\nC.\n\nThe Sociological Factors The establishment of Muhammadiyah, aside from its attachment to the spirit, idea, and actions of Kyai Dahlan as the founder, was also background derived from the social reality of the society, particularly the Muslims at the moment. The social reality was sociology factor behind the establishment of Muhammadiyah. In the context of social movement, the birth of a movement as well as an organization including with religious background, is always present in the adjacent context of sociology, never be in the void space or in vacuum state. The establishment of Muhamaddiyah, accompanied by intellectual and reform ideas of the founder, is initially stimulated by contentious reality of the Muslims as well as upon challenge which had to be faced and solved, wisely. These are among the factors of the establishment: (a) the Muslims have derailed from the Qur’an and Sunnah leading to the plentiful practices of shirk, bid’ah, and khurafat, which impact to the disgrace of Muslim community and the impurities of Islamic teaching among the society; (b) the absence of unity among the Muslims and the lack of brotherhood of Muslims (ukhuwahIslamiyah) since there is no Islamic organized institution; (c) the malfunction of Islamic education institution in building cadre due to the movement backwardness; (d) the short-minded fanaticism, taqlid onto conservative, formal, and traditional dogmas; (e) the awareness on potential threats to Islam and its future, as the result of penetration of Zending (Christian missionary) among the society (Salam, 1968: 33). Principally, Muhammadiyah was born in the social situation which triggered and stimulated this Islamic movement. The belief and practices of the religion shaded by the syncretism, the combining of the contradictory Islamic teaching and traditional ritual for instance, the practices of polytheistic (belief in or doctrine of more than one god or many gods, musyrik), superstition (belief in myths), deviations (worship without proper basis of Qur’an nor Sunnah, bid’ah), and khurafat (a kind of metaphysic or astrologer). The practices of Islamic teaching, moreover, has coalesced both\n\nThe Establishment\n\n23\n\nwith Animism, Dynamism, and Hindu values persisting among the indigenous inhabitants; which embrace by the Muslims uncritically even preserved as the name of respect and Islam acculturation toward traditional values. The underdevelopment endured by the Muslim society spans from economy (persistent poverty, dhu’afa), occupied politically or marginal, to traditional culture. In the time of the Dutch occupation (as advanced by the Portuguese), the penetration of Zending Christian missionary into the indigenous population was either directly and indirectly supported and protected by the colonial rule. This sociological reality is undeniable as religious propagation is a part of history of nations of all the time. Uptight and diffident situations became an inspiration for Kyai Dahlan to find a way outwhile offering a new one for the Muslimsin particularand the Indonesian in general. The stride, then, became an idea for establishing Islamic movement with its reformist or modernist complexion as an alternative movement. The backwardness and traditional sociology background encouraged Muhammadiyah to spread and promote Islamic teaching to the members in Yogyakarta residency, and nationwide later, which well-known as tajdid. The theme of the movement is a return to the pristine teaching of the Qur’an and Sunnah (al-ruju’ ila al-Qur’an wa as-Sunnah), similar theme to previous Islamic reformist movement pioneered by Ibn Taymiyyah, Muhammad ibn Abd alWahhab, Muhammad Abduh, Rashid Rida and so on. This was the touch of the chain of Islamic movement, while in several cases Muhammadiyah has different characteristic with the other Islamic movements. According to Mukti Ali, the background of Muhammadiyah can be extracted into four points: (1) the contamination or the mingled of Islamic religious belief and practises in Indonesia; (2) the inefficiency of religious education institutional system; (3) the mushroomed activity of Catholic and Protestant missionaries; (4) apathetic, even humiliating perspective from the intellectuals towards Islam. With these circumstances, thus the mission and orientation of Muhammadiyah are: (1) to purify Islam in Indonesia from the influence and practises of syncretism; (2) to reformulate Islamic doctrine into a modern perspective; (3) to reformulate Islamic teaching and education; (4) to defend and protect Islam from outside attack and influence (Ali, 1958: 20). Despite of several parties stated that Kyai Dahlan had never advocated reform ideas in a comprehensive writing and Muhammadiyah\n\n24\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\ntajdidis characterized with ad-hoc, yet this academic assessment should not neglect Kyai Dahlan’s intellectuality and breakthrough represented by the establishment of Muhammadiyah such a monumental movement at the time. The framework of neo-modernism Islam bloomed in the early of 1980 could not be used as a parameter either to evaluate or to judge modernism and reformism of Islam revived in the early of 1900, since each Islamic movement and other social movements has its particular context and era. Muhammadiyah was ascertained in a given era which made it possible for the movements to respond the problems of society through reform movements with rich context and influence, as stated by an American anthropolog, James L. Peacock in 1970. According to Peacock (1986: 26), Muhammadiyah has grown up into a nationwide Islamic reform movement, even a large one in the Southeast Asia, not to mention ‘Aisyiyah as the largest women’s movement in the world. In social context, Muhammadiyah becomes a major and primary organization. The establishment of Muhammadiyah, theologically, might be inspired by Islamic tajdid. Yet in sociological context, it was compelled by the backwardness of the Muslims and the Indonesian. Kyai Dahlan through Muhammadiyah had initiated an authentic Islam with a trajectory into the practices of true Islam, a blessing for the universe. The authentic Islam was not merely a discourse, it was practiced by a return to the legitimate basis of the Qur’an and Sunnah and its power to shift the old-fashioned life into a modern one. The phenomenon of Muhammadiyah is also depicted from the system of its organization, instead of the figure. The emerge of Islamic movement in the course of an organization was a breakthrough, at the time when the Muslim community was outlined by traditional culture represented by local institution such as Pesantren with the major dominance of Kyai as informal leader. Organization was noticeably a modern phenomenon of the twentieth century, which was genuinely adapted by Kyai Dahlan as a tool or instrument (washilah) to achieve the true Islam. Managing an Islamic movement through organization in the context of Muhammadiyah commencement was not solely technically matter since it had to be religiously referenced as the expectation of the ulema on rule of “when a compulsory cannot be done without a thing, it is then becomes a compulsory (ma la yatimm al-wajib illa bihi fa huwa\n\nThe Establishment\n\n25\n\nwajib).In principal, the establishment of Muhammadiyah as an organized Islamic movement was theologically allusion portrayed by the interpretation of Surah Ali Imran verse 104 which later is renowned as the “verse” of Muhammadiyah. The inspiration of Surah Ali Imran verse 104 brings Muhammadiyah to advocate Islam beyond “transcendence” which merely insists the belief awareness on monotheism, the relation between God-humankind. Furthermore, Islam is magnified as a dynamic strength toward social transformation in the reality of life, what has been described by Kuntowijoyo as “humanization” (urge people for virtue) and “emancipation” or “liberalization” (restrain people from evil deeds). In this case, Islam is actualized by down-to-earth Revealed religion, marked by the new dawn of Islamic Reformism or Modernism in Indonesia. Profound, intellect, modern basic ideas of the founder have made Muhammadiyah a powerful enormity movement which displays Islam as a reform religion. Its reform on purification (of Islam) has become a public mindset among the Muslims for the authentication of religious practices, which is a return to the pristine Qur’an and Sunnah. Ijtihad, education and social services system, moreover, have been adopted as state of mind among the majority Muslim, including of those who oppose the organization. Meanwhile, the activity and charity and services (amalusaha) scattered through the entire of the country have been gained by the Muslim as well as the society. Muhammadiyah becomes precious organization of the Muslim, nation, and world society as the realization of risala for people in the world.\n\nD.\n\nThe Beginning The early generation of Muhammadiyah (1912-1923), in the period of Kyai Dahlan’s leadership the establishment to the time he passed away in 1923, seemed simply plain yet it radiated extraordinary reform movement. At the time, the establishment of Muhammadiyah school in 1911, Sopo Tresno in 1914 which later became ‘Aisyiyah women’s movement in 1917, Pandu Hizbul Wathan scouting in 1918, Weisshouse or orphanage and Penolong Kesengsaraan Oemoem (PKO) in 1922 a month before Kyai Dahlan passed away, and the launch of publication SoearaMuhammadiyah magazine in\n\n26\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\n1915. In additional, the ideas of organized zakat (religious taxes, charity) and hajj, festive prayers in the open field, brochure publications and library activities, management of mubaligh and mubalighat to perform tabligh among the societies for Islamic da’wah, availability of mosque/mushala in the public areas and office building, and so on. According to H. Sudja’, the idea of Muhammadiyah University came firstly from M. Hisjam as H.B. Muhammadiyah School Council, in the “extraordinary meeting” on June 18, 1920 with Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan as the chairman. In addition to the finding of exact direction of Qibla which was controversial before the birth of Muhammadiyah (Sudja’, 1989: 31). In Muhammadiyah General Assembly in 1920, four chairmans of Hoofdbestuur Muhammadiyah were inaugurated, namely, (1) H.M. Hisyam, Head of H.B. Muhammadiyah School Department; (2) H.M. Fachruddin, Head of H.B. Muhammadiyah Tabligh Department; (3) H.M. Soedja’, Head of H.B. Muhammadiyah Penolong Kesengsaraan Oemoem ; and (4) H.M. Mochtar, Head of Library Department. At the time M. Hisjam was elected and questioned dealing with the sketch of his chairmanship, his answer was as follows: “Somehow I will bring our companions in school department to give our best effort in enhancing educationand process of learning which able to enforce the magnificent Muhammadiyah University to create Islamic scholars and lecturers for the benefit ofthe Muslims in general and Muhammadiyah in particular.”(Sudja’, 1989:31). Kyai Sudja’ explained in his book about the enthusiasm of the councils of School, Tabligh, Taman Poestaka at the time. However, as he was officiated was the Head of Penolong Kesengsaraan Oemoem (PKO), his ideas on building hospital, poorhouse (armeinhais), and orphanage (weeshuis), the councils sneered at him instead of acknowledging. He even asked Kyai Dahlan as the Chairman to describe his oddly idea to be explicable for the councils. Eventually, Kyai Sudja’ described by himself as follows:\n\nThe Establishment\n\n27\n\n“...In the Qur’an, Surah Al-Ma’un is remaining tangible and intact, the character, the sentence, the meaning, the interpretation are entirely the same since it was revealed by God, nothing is less. Although the holy book Qur’an has existed for centuries and Surah Al-Ma’un is read daily in prayers of Muslims in Indonesia generally and in Yogyakarta particularly, still there is no Muslim who pay fully attention to the heart of the Surah which is fundamental in the society life. Numbers of people non-Muslim community have built orphanages to cordially take care and nurture the poor and derelict orphans, with humanity as their solely spirit, instead of their responsibility toward society and religion. The spirit of humanity, yet, makes the people conduct these good deeds it will be astonishing if the Muslims ignore it, whereas Islam is the true religion for the whole humankind. Are we human? If they capable in doing (good) deeds, is there any reason we cannot do the same? Hum ridjal wa nahnu ridjal...” (Sudja’, 1989: 33). The dynamics of meeting and congress of Muhammadiyah represented aptly democratic process, although, new idea could not be accepted by the Muslims, frequently. However, the meeting had decided planning as scheduled by the chairman of the departments, which later became milestone of social movement. Feeling disappointed as his idea was underestimated, Kyai Sudja’ still admitted that the meeting was extraordinary. Each councils of Muhammadiyah is more organized in pursuing the objectives. Kyai Dahlan and eight members of H.B. Muhammadiyah effortlessly accomplished organization activities, especially in collaborating with the government, other organizations, as well as other associated regions. H.B. Muhammadiyah, at the moment, consisted of nine people including Kyai Dahlan as the Executive Director, Abdullah Sirad as the Secretary, Ahmad, Abdul Rahman, Sarkawi, Muhammad, Jaelani, Akis, and Mohammad Fakih as the members. In its early advancement, Muhammadiyah had expanded the organization target and range outside the residency of Yogyakarta but was impeded by the first Statuten legalized by the Dutch East Indies on June 15, 1914. The demanded request came from the donators and the readers of Swara Muhammadiyah outside Yogyakarta i.e. from Central Java, East Java, and Bali who supported and enquired Muhammadiyah to hold pengajian in\n\n28\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\norder to be the members. In addition, some of the members moved out from Yogyakarta and in the same time had eagerness to still be the members. The zest of the society toward Muhammadiyah widened more and more as they heard the speech of Kyai Ahmad Dahlan in the meeting of Boedi Oetoemo in Kauman Yogyakarta in 1017, as well as his role as Commissaries and Religious Supervisor of Sarekat Islam (Majlis of Library and Documentation PP Muhammadiyah, 1995: 33). The barrier on range became the reason H.B. Muhammadiyah proposed the Statuten amendment of Article 2 with newer ones, as follows: (a) to promote and to encourage the teaching and learning of Islam in the Netherlands East Indies; (b) to promote and to encourage life (way of life) along a willingness of Islam to its members. This proposal was accepted by the Dutch East Indies in Besluit No. 40 of August 16, 1920. The amendment of Article 4 and 5 “in the Residency of Yogyakarta” into “in the Dutch East Indies”, was also accepted in Besluit No. 36 of September 2, 1921. It was an open gate for the entire society in the Dutch East Indies to be the sympathiser and member of Muhammadiyah. Given the evidence Suara Muhammadiyah had an enormous impact as the expansion catalyst was published in Javanese, it was altered into Melayu language to accelerate the spread of information about Islam as well as Muhammadiyah. In 1921, Muhammadiyah had swollen its range of both member and organization in several areas of the Dutch East Indies. Perkumpulan were the main concern before the amendment of Statuten of 1914, as they performed the activities of Muhammadiyah in Yogyakarta. They were Sidiq Amanah Tabligh Fatanah in Surakarta, Al-Hidayah in Garut West Java, Nurul Islam in Pekalongan, and Al-Munir in Makassar South Sulawesi. The amendment brought a new opportunity to enlarge the range of Muhammadiyah since 1921. At the same year, the Branch of Srandakan and Imogiri (Yogyakarta); Blora (Central Java) and Surabaya and Kepanjen (East Java) were established. In 1922, there were six additional Branches in Surakarta, Purwokerto, Pekalongan, and Pekajanagan (Central Java), Garut (West Java), and Batavia (Jakarta). In 1923, three Branches were founded in Purbalingga, Klaten, and Balapulang in Central Java (Table 1).\n\nThe Establishment\n\n29\n\nTable I\n\nYear\n\n1921\n\n1922\n\n1923\n\nMuhammadiyah Branches in 1921-1923 Branch Date of Establishment 01.

Ranting (Sub-district) of Muhammadiyah as the part of Branch had not been formed, it was developed in 1923 after Kyai Dahlan passed away, as well as the growing number of Muhammadiyah members. Significant number of members was gained in 1916-1922, whereas in 1916 there was only 149 members, it multiplied into 3346 active members in 1922. Based on occupation, generally the members of Muhammadiyah were trader (38.6%) and government official/teacher (24.6%), religious court official (6%), labour (19.4%), journalist (11%), and private (0.6%). In 1920-1923, Muhammadiyah School was also initiated by the formation of SekolahAngka 2 in Kauman / Suranatan, Karangkajen, Pasargede / Kotagede, 30\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nand Lempuyangan; Sekolah Guru Qismul Arqa Kauman, Religious School in Suranatan, and Sekolah Angka 1 HIS Met de Qur’an. There was a total of 1,084 students in 1923. The zest and number of female students became a concern of Siswa Praja which later coordinated and divided the activities of the student into male and female by conducting leadership training in various activities once in a week. In 1921, Muhammadiyah Dormitories (Pondok Muhammadiyah) were founded as the boarding house facilitation for the students male students in Jayang prakosan who were mentored by Kyai Dahlan and female students in Kyai Dahlan’s house who was supervised by Nyai Dahlan. In advancement, there were additional dormitories for female students (in Kauman) and for male students (in Ngabean) in order to maintain the academic achievement of the students. They also sheltered the students of MULO and AMS, as well as the students of Taman Siswa with lower fee (ibid: 38). In the beginning of Muhammadiyah, it also had immense concern in writings and publications in the time when direct and personnel communication used to be a common (Sairin, 1995: 53). In addition to the publication of brochure and book, Taman Pustaka Muhammadiyah also published Soeara Muhammadijah magazine in Javanese and Melayu Language. The Executive Editorial, Fakhruddin, is a smart passionate and critical writer who dared to oppose the Dutch East Indies. Accompanied by Soerjopranoto, he even mobilized the workers of Madukismo Sugar Factory to fight against the colonial rule. The content of Suara Muhammadiyah (SM) was the teaching of Islam, the news of Muhammadiyah, problem answers and questions, organization stuff, and so on. This magazine became an effective bridge or media distributed not only in Yogyakarta but also in Central Java, East Java, and Bali. In 1923, after the language was changed into Melayu, the idea of Muhammadiyah was widely propagated. SM was quite an attractive media, in 1922, there was a question on “Is Islam is suitable with the human’s common sense?” in the topic of “Religion-Reasoning”. In the rubric of Answers and Questions, (Soeara Muhammadiyah, No. 3/1922: 15). The early generation of Muhammadiyah had developed around the nation after Kyai Dahlan passed away in February 23, 1923. It grew progressively that in 1927, there were officially 47 Branches, 10 Pra-branches, and 98 Sub-branches in the Dutch East Indies. The areas consisted of\n\nThe Establishment\n\n31\n\nLumajang, Ponorogo, Ngawi, Madiun, Pasuruan, Sumenep, Sampang Bangil, Situbondo, Batur, Jember, Bondowoso, Malang, Blitar, and Bangkalan, all of them in East Java. While in Central Java, it consisted of Cilacap, Bumiayu, Kudus, Banjarnegara, Kutoarjo, Temanggung, Tegal, Semarang, Boyolali, Banyumas, Majenang, Slawi, Ajibarang, and Sragen. In addition, there were new Branches of Kalianget, Bobotsari, Simabur, and Kraksaan. Across the Java, there were Branch of Gantoeng in Belitung, Makassar in South Sulawesi, Padang Panjang and Maninjau in West Sumatra. In-processed Branches in 1927 included Sigli, Kutaraja, Lhok Seumawe, Fort de Kock, Sekayu, Tebing Tinggi, Medan, Kuala Kapuas, Peta, and Bengkulen (BeritaTahoenan, 1927: 32-33). Massive dispersion of Muhammadiyah was mainly conveyed by its members from West Sumatra who had high social mobility around Indonesia. According to the Historian, Taufik Abdullah, Muhammadiyah was truly born in Yogyakarta, yet it developed in West Sumatra. However, the central figure of initial movement is Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan who successfully and genuinely conducted da’wah with his naturally calm and deep speech, as well as interaction with others. Personality and thought of Kyai Dahlan is a distinguished lure, at the time, it could melt down two pertinacious Mansur Mas Mansur of Surabaya and Sutan Mansur of Minangkabau who became the Chairmans of PB/PP Muhammadiyah afterward. Under the leadership of Kyai Dahlan in the beginning of the movement, almost the whole ideas of reform was initiated and set off, as the base for the subsequent generations. A number of breakthroughs might seem simple, yet it significantly affected and made up the future of Muhammadiyah. Expansive, flexible, and fresh ideas of Muhammadiyah were another magnet which attracted the public to at least have motivation to curios about Muhammadiyah. It is then essential to figure out the early generation ideas in the context of the emergence of the reform as well as its long-termed implications for the development of the movement and the society in the future.\n\n32\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nISLAM IN INDONESIA\n\nDemographically, Islam is the greatest strength in Indonesia. Despite Indonesia is a secular state, yet the number of Muslims in the country is beyond than any other country in the world (even of Islamic countries). In 2000, the Muslims in Indonesia reached 88.22% or approximately 177,528,777 of the total 201,241,999 population (Suryadinata, 2003: 104). Compared to the population of Saudi Arabia of 20.8 million (96.6% Muslim), Uni Emirat Arab of 2.1 million (96% Muslim), Egypt of 63.3 million (90% Muslim), Irak of 21.7 million (97% Muslim), Iran of 61.5 million (99% Muslim), Malaysia of 22.1 million (52.9% Muslim), and Brunei of 0.3 million (67.2% Muslim) in the same year (Brown, 2003: 23). Indonesia, frequently, is assumed as the greatest Muslim country of the world, even though, it is not officially an Islamic country. alteration Islam in Indonesiais formed through a history of elongated struggle, which cannot be eluded and is the link age of the development of Islamin the world. In the course of introduction of Islam to Indonesia, there were connections as well as alteration from extensive chain o fIslamic history. On one hand, there is the phenomenon of universal Islam as an idea and development of Islam since the religion grows and blooms from the Arabian Peninsula, on the other hand there are symptoms of local Islamic with its particular nuances and inherent to the process of society cultural struggles. Islamic history itself, both in the global and in Indonesia, shows tidal dynamics and non-linear struggle, a portrait of one Islam with colourful tones. Islam in Indonesia\n\n33\n\nA.\n\nIndonesian Islam Historically, Islam entered Indonesia peacefully and constructively, which was the awakening of indigenous inhabitants toward a three dimensional relation among God, society, and the universe. This relationship is determined by Islam the teaching on worldly perspective of comprehensive, universal, and in the sphere of reachable human rationalization (Maarif, 1996: 175). Given the fact Islam mostly approached from the coastal area, it crossed the threshold by facing Indigenous cultures relied upon the farmer society stratum of Animism (Dobbin, 2008: 185). Hindu was another constrain, as it had rooted severely among local communities. According to Harry J. Benda, particularly in Java, “Hinduisation” or “Indianization” exactly, had deeply penetrated along with its enduring reminisces (Benda, 1974: 36). The contradiction between Islam and Indigenous culture of animistic and Hindu carried on the diverse dynamic and nuance of Islam in Indonesia. Several historians stated that Islam was brought by Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia in the 7th century, while others suggested the spread of Islam the 13th century by Indian, Persian, Chinese Muslim traders initiated from the coastal areas and crucial ports in Indonesian archipelago (Abdullah, 1991: 34). The first Islamic kingdom in Indonesia is Samudra Pasai, which was established in the 13th century. By the 15th and 16th century, several Islamic kingdoms developed significantly, such as Malaka, Jambi, Demak, Cirebon, Banten, Ternate and Tidore, Banjarmasin, Mataram, and Islamic kingdoms in South Sulawesi i.e. Gowa, Bone, and so on. The glory of these kingdoms of Aceh, Banten, Mataram, Gowa-Tallo, and Ternate was attained by the 17th century, which was then followed by the deterioration era of majority Javanese kingdoms in the 18th century (Abdullah, 1991: 42). Since then, Islam has been developing in Indonesian archipelago until the evidence of the largest Muslims community in Indonesia. The achievement of Islam to be a majority strength which forms influential Muslim culture is inseparable from Islamisation or Islam dissemination through the culture in addition to the Islamic kingdoms. Islamisation in Indonesia was originally carried out through the process of socio-cultural and socio-economy by the missionaries and Muslim traders (Kartodirdjo, 1993: 7). It reveals a layered process of propagation leading to certain consequences and raising new realities of thestruggleof both Islamandsociety as reflected in the history ofIndonesia (Abdullah, 1974: 34). 34\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nTaufik Abdullah (1974, 1-8) noted that Islam in Indonesia had endured dynamics of the conflict between dogma and history religious doctrine and flexible reality of times hence Islamisation undergone connexion and changes as well as the answer to the era. Instead of merely an acceptance ofthe doctrine, Islamisation is a sacrifice to accommodate the changes and demands of the times by means of natural acculturation process without losing the essence and the principles ofthe teachings. In addition to the internalization of dogma (like the orthodox doctrine), it had to face the history and culture in a given time when Islam entered, grew, and developed. This complicated process brought the purification movement of Islam, which was relied on Islamic orthodox, functioned dynamically with reform as the answer of time challenges, manifesting Islam into a colourful religion in Indonesia. What so ever process and model of Islamization, it is undeniable that Islam strongly affected the indigenous culture, which in advance was influenced by animism, dynamism, and Hindu. However, the process of Islamization is never complete, it is on-going process diverging Islam in Indonesia alongside its particular socio-history as the background. What has mentioned as The Religion of Java (AgamaJawa) or well-known as “kejawen” by Clifford Geertz, in fact, illustrates the struggle of Islam in the midst of previous deep rooted religions and its lingering cultural circumstances. Although Islamic orthodox came into Arabian Peninsula after the establishment of Saudi Arabia (which synergized with Wahabbi movement), kejawen is an exceptional matter in the advanced Islamisation process leading to dichotomy or polarization between Islamsantri versus Islamabangan as mentioned by Geertz previously. The emerge of Islam in Indonesia is a remarkable phenomenon since the religion was assumed as foreign, yet Islam could be embraced by most of society peacefully, in addition to the dynamic of development history. The Wali are revered saints of Islam in Indonesia, they were outstanding for their tranquil Muslim missionaries and cultural tinge in their religious teaching. Historians and Sociologists came into the conclusion that the face of Islam in Indonesia is cultural itself. The characteristic of rigid Islam is either a flash or a fragment in Islamic history in Indonesia, in which its occurrence is frequently backed by socio-political factor and hardly ever pure from religious factor. In Paderi War and DI/TII, for instance, violence became an ambiguity dealing with the cross cutting of interest between religious sentiment and Islam in Indonesia\n\n35\n\nsocio-political factors, therefore they were not mainstreams in the history of Islam development in Indonesia. The struggle of Islam with previous religion (especially Hindu) might not completely succeed in the perspective of Islamic orthodox movement which emerged in the second period of the late 19th century. It could be associated to the dynamic of Islam in several regions with Hindu influences. Koentjaraningrat described the phenomenon, as follows: “In the regions where Hindu is non-dominant, Islam has a significant effect to the local community life of the adjacent areas, for instance, in Aceh, Banten, North Java Coast, and South Sulawesi. It is similar to the regions of Sumatra, such as, East Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Kalimantan Coast. On the contrary, Hindu dominant areas of Central Java and East Java, Islam has altered into a religion which is well-known as the Religion of Java (AgamaJawa). The religion of devout Muslims who belief and practice the teaching of true Islam is called IslamSantri. Moreover, IslamSantri is not merely found in the coastal area of Central Java and East Java, but throughout Java even though the followers are frequently dominant in particular area such as in the north coast of East Java. On the contrary, there are areas with minority followers, such as in Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Madiun and etc.” (Koentjaraningrat, 1976: 25-26). In several periods of history, especially after the 13th century, Islam had integrated with a number of kingdoms in the archipelago with the spirit of peacefully Islam and succeeded in doing so. In the colonial era, for instance in Maluku, the power of Islam was able to make up a peace pact with Christian community at the time, which further became the integration adhesive among heterogeneous Maluku society. It was similar to other areas in the Archipelago. Based on his book, Koentjaraningrat insisted that Islam had transformed into national integration entity in the history of Indonesian society. The birth of The Religion of Java, as mentioned by Clifford Geertz, displayed the other side of tranquil cultural integration by the emerge of Islam, although in a certain limitation it left a theological tension of Islam puritan and Islam Jawa (kejawen) in the process of da’wah. In overall, Islam\n\n36\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nbecame a vital and strategic factor in constructing national integration and devout piously culture in harmony. The path of Islamic history in Indonesia cannot omit the role of sufism missionaries, beside the Muslim traders who generally carried out shariaoriented Islam. Particularly in South Sulawesi at the time the Sufism early generation pioneered by Sermon Giver Khatib Bungsu and sharia-oriented pioneered by Sermon Giver Khatib Tunggal (both of them came from Minangkabau), divided their duties in promoting Islam. However, shariaoriented Islamic tended to be stronger and institutionalized in the form of Islamic kingdoms. However, Sufism spread thorough numbers of area and fused with local custom and culture (Nashir, 2007). Similarly to other areas in the archipelago, the struggle of Islam in Sumatra also cued a dynamic one. It included Padri movement in Minangkabau involving a tense among Islam puritan, Sufism, and indigenous group, which raised up an Islamic accommodation pattern of between sharia and local custom. Padri movement (1821-1838) and “white community (kaumputih)” (Mazhab Hambali or Wahhabi movement) in Minangkabau developed previously (1803-1807) adhered to the complicatet religious movement dynamics. Movement led by Tuantu Nan Rentjeh, Haji Miskin, Haji Piobang, Haji Sumanik, Tuanku Imam Bonjol (Petro Syarif), Tuanku Rao, and others in the context of both of religious movement and people movement with its puritan characteristic. Sjafnir Aboe Naim affirmed the Puritanism of Padri, as follows: “Their mission is to purify various influences of indigenous customs opposed to the teaching of Islam. The idea arouse during their acquaintance to the Wahhabi communal in Mecca as they went on pilgrimage. Their aim is total Islam Puritanism, which is an absolute devout onto the religion, fivetimes prayer, no-smoking, no-gambling, as well as no-cockfighting.” (Naim, 20008: 48). The spread of Islam in Sunda West Java also demonstrated its own vibrant, hence, it was included as a relatively potent Muslim base, similar to Aceh, South Sulawesi, South Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, Southern Central Java, Yogyakarta Special Regions, and East Java. Islam entered Parahiyangan Sunda in the form of acculturation, although Sundanese society was relatively open minded in welcoming Islam. The social system of the society, which is horizontal, meaning that it is moderately democratic allegedly\n\nIslam in Indonesia\n\n37\n\nto its originality of cultivator (peladang) and the absence of any kingdom influential culture aside from Pakuan, Pajajaran, and Banten kingdom had ever occupied this region). The culture of cultivator (peladang) tends to be more flexible compared to the culture of rice field (persawahan). In addition, the society without any presence of dominant culture of Hindu kingdoms yielded to supple egalitarian nature, rather than the society within the kingdom authority which tended to be tightly monolithic filled with cosmologic mystic standpoints. Thus, in general Sundanese without any significant obstacles received Islam and was popular as pious Muslim society (Jackson, 1990; Dijk: 1993; Dengel: 1995). Islam development in each part of the archipelago might never be the same. Dealing with this statement, Benda suggested as follows: “...Even as, statistically, 90% of Indonesian is Muslim, the teachings of Islam are highly differentiated. It can be assumed that the foreign nature of Islam orthodox remains in a few of areas. The process of culture change will never be accomplished since it requires certain associated points. Let’s assume Islam came straightforwardly from Middle East (as stated by previous historians) by rooting monotheism and clean up the entire preceded belief and practice, it might be impossible to determine a place to penetrate the teaching, especially in Java. Principally, Islam had been existed in several parts of Indonesia centuries before the massive movement of Islamisation. Muslim foreigners had lived in the ports and Islamic kingdoms in North Sumatra since the 13th century, and might be earlier. However, it was in the 15th and 16th century that Islam represented primary religion and culture in the archipelago. It was a possibility that this quite suddenly change was caused by the spread of Sufism as the motivator of progressing Islam in Asia, even China. Additionally, Islam mystique in Indonesia was brought by Indian Muslims rather than Arabian Muslims. Subsequently, this double reflection of Islam meets the point in Indonesia, especially in Java which was strongly affected by Indian.” (Benda, 1874: 41). Consequently, the spread and development of Islam in Indonesia has endured gradual dynamic and process of struggle among various teachings\n\n38\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nand cultures, instead of static and linier. In the context of change, the history shows the continuity of improvement in the Islamization process as well as in Muslim circumstances. Each stage may be hinted by diverse situations including the fluctuation of religious, socio-economic, politic, and cultural factors. Islam in the manifestation of Muslim’s life might not be ideal and singular, hence, Islam is always present in various realities along with their rise and fall.\n\nB.\n\nThe Colonial Era Indonesian including the Muslims as the majority citizens had ever suffered from the colonial of Portuguese, Dutch, and Japan. By the entrance of Portuguese in 1551, which was followed by the Dutch preceded by the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) and by the Japan occupation a few years just before the Independence, the indigenous people of Indonesia severely suffered from lengthy terrible pain under the colonial rule. Even though if the conquest of Aceh in 1914 is referred to be the end of the colonial era, yet the reality of being occupied had been endured for 350-years, such a very long dreadful experience. Among the three colonial rules, the Dutch was the longest one. Some observers might think there is a bright side from the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia as they carried on irrigation, transportation, and education, particularly after the policy of elite politic in 1887. However, there are more downsides, by the numbers of wars and the devide at impera politic brought by the Dutch, conveying Indonesian into unbearable loss and damage. Indonesia became a poor uneducated nation and a lower-class society even in its own country. Abundant natural wealthy of Indonesia was highly consumed by the colonial, on the contrary, Indonesian were merely heavers as mentioned by Soekarno. The intrusions of the Dutch through Vereenigne Oost Indische Compagnie (VOC) in 1602 to its declined power in 1798 and afterward the sovereignty of colonialism had extremely afflicted Indonesian people. The system of Cultuur Stelsel (enforcement planting, tanam paksa) until 1877 and the colonialism policies put the wave of oppression, poverty, and starvation to the indigenous inhabitants. Enforcement planting (tanam paksa) resulted\n\nIslam in Indonesia\n\n39\n\non vast starvation in several areas (Kahin, 1995: 15). The colonial economic and politic strength were more suffocated. However, in 1889, the Dutch colonial rule started to apply Elite politic. It was merely a partial favour, though, since meticulously the society order had been destructed by enduring occupation, definitely. In the 19th century, the countries in the world had modernized their life aspects, yet Indonesia was still trapped in traditionalism sphere. Unpleasant situations yielded from colonialism i.e. poverty, poorly educated, oppression, underdevelopment, blended with traditional state of mind resulted on static (jumud, status quo), apathetic, fatalism, and mythological perspective. Superstition, khufarat, and supernatural dimmed the light side of society, brought the tendency of anti-progress. It was similar to the Muslim circumstances, the majority community at the time. The Dutch colonial rule pertained to the politic of Dutch East Indies Islam which seemed to appreciate worship and social activities, yet it surreptitiously turned down the potential of Muslim in enhancing its strength to fight against colonialism. The Dutch was threatened by the Islam spirit of jihad fi-sabilillah. It became a reason the colonial rule inhibited Islam to be a dynamic religion. Traditional belief and practice of the Muslim apparently were allowed continuously. In addition, Islam politic as advised by Snouck Hurgronje was preserved deliberately on order to lock the Muslims in ignorance and backwardness. The politic of devide at impera in devastating rebellions and Islamic kingdoms, moreover, caused similar effects to the Muslim. Islam, undeniable, was a religion of non-dynamic and non progressive. Indonesian Muslim might formally be the follower of Islam but honestly they were far away from the pristine basis of Islam, the Qur’an and Sunnah. Shirk, superstition, khurafat, and bid’ah developed in the Muslim society. Rationality was tabooed and modernization was assumed to be Western. The standpoint of modern or rationalization is called as Western and by being “Western” means kafir. It leads to the ignorance and underdevelopment of the Muslim comoaring to other developed nations. In the midst of backwardness both in understanding and practice as well as other aspects of life of Islam, Muhammadiyah was established along with modern Islam movement in the early of 20th century. In the same time with the Revival of Islam throughout the world in battling over the colonialism 40\n\nMuhammadiyah a Reform Movement\n\nand backwardness, similar Islamic movement occurred in Indonesia to fight against colonialism as well as to conduct reform in the Muslim life. The Revival of Islam is popular as Islamic modernism and reformism, reform movements in every feature of life toward the progress and glory of Muslims in Indonesia.\n\nC.\n\nThe Revival of Islam The Revival of Islam was grounded from both the struggle against the Dutch and internal dynamic within the Muslim society since the early 19th century. Even though the Dutch colonial rule had succeeded in having a power over most part of the archipelago, nevertheless, there were several continuous resistances from Islamic kingdoms and Muslim society. In Minangkabau, the first period of the Revival movement took place in Kota Tua Agam in 17841803, which was led by Tuanku Nan Tua. He performed religious movement as well as trading to adjust the Islamic law in the villages and to organize the Muslim traders. The outstanding subsequent period was Padri movement in 1803-1819 led by Haji Miskin, Tuanku Nan Rentjeh, and the most prominent Tuanku Imam Bonjol with his strictly Wahhabi purification movement, beside his substantial resistance toward the Dutch (Dobbin, 2008: 198). The most sophisticated of the revival and reformist movement in Minangkabau was pioneered by Ahmad Khatib, Hadji Rasul, and Ahmad Taher who were well-known for their embryo of modernism aimed to return Islam to the Qur’an and Sunnah not only in West Sumatra but also throughout Indonesia and Southeast Asia (Federspiel, 2004: 43). By the 19th century, a group of Muslim had related to Middle East and had higher opportunity to perform hajj after the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, which stimulated Muslims to revive and became new ammunition to fight against colonialism. In the moment, there was a new wave of Islam orthodox with its purpose to purify Islam. Islam orthodoxy had an influence in replacing over mystic and syncretism previously possessed Indonesia"
