The plot of Sang Pencerah’s was the forward-backward plot.The plot of Sang Pencerah’s film is tell about a man,named K.H.Ahmad Dahlan (Muhammad Darwis) that content the patriotism spirit of the young generations in their idea representatives.\n\nMuhammad Darwis (Ahmad Dahlan) was the son of Kyai Abu Bakar that also one of mosque official in the big mosque of Kauman village.The Kauman village was the big village,in Yogyakarta, that was the central of Islamic doctrine activities or Islamic religious proselytizing activities. The village was leading by a Muslim leader,named Kyai Penghulu Kamaludiningrat also as an Islamic religion organizer .In that time, the Islamic religion in the Kauman village had an effection from Syeh Siti Jenar’s Islamic religion doctrine that placed the king as a symbol of Allah/God.And made the people became to believe it.They belief the king’s word was Allah/the God’s word and Islamic doctrine law also turned to the mystical/myth doctrine.Meanwhile,the proverty and stupidity also was tyranicaling in that time, because of the Dutch government’s torcing plant politics. That made the religion organizer couldn’t aspire it because they were very busy with the mystical doctrine that defied with the Al-Quran and Islam prophet’s doctrine,Muhammad saw.\n\nIn that time,Muhammad Darwis was 15 years old and he saw many kinds of the wrong tradition that combined with the Islamic religion.Therefore,Darwis decided to go to the Mecca to deepen his knowledge about Islamic religion.Before he went to Mekkah,his uncle adviced him in order that he studied at Mecca was mean to bring the changing for Kauman village.Not like the teachers of Islamic religion that had studied before at there,but they still followed the wrong tradition of Kauman village.\n\nAfter he finished his study in Mecca,he came back to the Kauman village.At the time,he was 21 years old and he also changed his name,Muhammad Darwis became Ahmad Dahlan.The name of Ahmad Dahlan was given by his teacher when he was still study in Mecca.Then,he married with Siti Walidah.\n\nOne day,he saw that his religion,Islamic doctrine was still turning to the wrong direction,Syirik and Bid’ah. That was making him worried to his religion.Then,he decided to change the doctrine to be a true doctrine.And he also wanted to make the people in Kauman village to realize about that.At the same time ,he thought that it was his mission and responsilibilities as a good Muslim man.Soon,he made a Islamic religious school (surau),named Langgar Kidul and a group to do his mission.The people in his group were his wife,Siti Walidah,his family,and his faithful follower/students.His wife always support him although his family and his brother in-law,except Kyai Lurah Nor.They often convinced AhmadDahlan and gave a motivation to him when his spirit low down.The Nationalis Group of Budi Utomo also support his mission.And because the support of them,Ahmad Dahlan decided that he never wanted to give up but he must finished and made his mission to be success.\n\nIn the first time,he did his mission with used the stopwatch to make the people realize that the mosque direction to Mecca was wrong.And that made a Islamic religion organizer,Kyai Kamaludiningrat became angry and defied his doctrine.But,Ahmad Dahlan didn’t care about that and he just continued his mission.See that,Kyai Kamaludiningrat became so angry and he ordered to the Kauman’s people to destroy Ahmad Dahlan’s religious school.Because,he thought that Ahmad Dahlan had damaged the tradition in Yogyakarta and taught the wrong Islamic religion doctrine.\n\nTherefore,Ahmad Dahlan and his wife,Siti Walidah decided to go out from the Kauman village.But,his sister didn’t accept his decision.Because,she said that his family still needed a lot of ideas from Ahmad Dahlan.His sister also promised that he would built a new religious tranining center of Islam (surau) for Ahmad Dahlan as the place to pray and the place for the childrens to learn how to read the Al-Quran sentences.With the donation from his sister and his wife,finally Ahmad Dahlan could built his new religious school (surau) that used to tell the people in Kauman village that Islam not only taught about the tauhid but also could made the peaceful life in society.Ahmad Dahlan had success to tell an important messages from the kernel of Al’maun letter that became his movement in organizing the people in Kauman village that was poor and misery to have a good and healthy life.\n\nIn his mission and his movement,he also wanted to give his knowledge to the other people.And he tried to teach about the Islamic religion lesson in the Dutch government school.In the first time,the school manager not sure that it could be success,but Ahmad Dahlan persuaded him in order that he would gave a chance for him to teach the Islamic religion lesson.And finally Ahmad Dahlan had allowed to tried taught the lesson as the test.In the test time,when he gave a greet,but no anyone of the students that replied his greet.Then,Ahmad Dahlan gave a greet again in several times.And,when Ahmad Dahlan gave the third greets ,one of the students expelled his flatus voices.Ahmad Dahlan didn’t angry with that,but he just continued to explain about the greatness of Allah that gave the holes to the humans for getting out the gasses in the stomach.Because of his good teaching mehtod,the students like to teach by him.And in a formally,Ahmad Dahlan became a teacher in the Dtuch government school.\n\nIn spite of that,his family and his follower/student like Sudja didn’t agree with that case. The people had thought Ahmad Dahlan as a unbeliever Islam teacher and teacher because he had been taught in the Dutch government school. And he also had accused as a Islamic kejawen teacher because he close by the Jawa educated people,in Budi Utomo Organization.But the accusing didn’t make Ahmad Dahlan’s spirit low down to erected his religion,Islam that its doctrine deviated to the wrong direction from the Islam doctrine that had before it.The students in the Dutch goverment school to learn a lesson from Ahmad Dahlan because they knew that Ahmad Dahlan would built the religious school in his religious training center of islam religion (surau).For Ahmad Dahlan,Islam was Rahmatan Lil Alamin religion that gave the peaceful for everyone included the non-Muslim people during he still built the society peaceful life.For him,the first thing that must be prejudiced Islamic people were the good characters,honestly life and had the solidarity or the tolerance to each other people,like Muhammad saw prophet.\n\nIn gradually, the progress of Ahmad Dahlan’s religious proselytizing that had a lot of controversial can changed everything that connected with the wrong Islamic doctrine not only in Islamic people perception,but also in West ethnic people perception to the Islam religion.With his lovely wife, Siti Walidah and his faithful follower/students were, Sudja, Fahruddin, Hisyam,Syarkawi and Abdulgani,Ahmad Dahlan made th Muhammadiyah Organization in order to educate the Islamic people to thinking forward that suitable with the period evolution.Once more again,Ahmad Dahlan’s religious proselytizing had defied by the Kauman’s Islamic organizer .The Muhammadiyah Organization had thought as a the wrong Islamic religion and Kyai Kamaludiningrat also thought that Ahmad Dahlan would be a resident.The presence of this organization had appeared the conflict between Ahmad Dahlan and the people of Kauman village.Together with the time,finally Kyai Kamaludinigrat was realizing his mistake .And he agreed with the inovation that did by Ahmad Dahlan.Because of that,the Muhammadiyah Organization had until now. And the wrong (sesajen ritual) cultural tradition until now still do it of Yogyakarta's region. That reflects that tradition have culturized in society so won't get lost although largely have realised if that tradition in opposition to teaching and syariat is islam.

Sang Pencerah’s film,we know that the struggle life of Ahmad Dahlan to built a good religion,Muhamadiyah Islamic, is not easy but it is very difficult.Every time the people insulting him as an unbeliever Islam district teacher ,but that is can’t make his spirit to be low down.Moreover that,he continue his struggling until the Muhamadiyah Islamic religion become a new Islamic religion.This scene give an advice to us that as the new generations, we don’t easy to give up,although when the trouble always coming to us.\n\nb.Don’t stop to learn/study something new\n\nAs we know in the film tell us about Ahmad Dahlan that after he get a title name as a teacher of Islamic district,he come back to Mekkah to continue his study.Moreover,after he come back to his own country,Indonesia,he study again with Budi Utomo about the organizasing and he also study how to be a good teacher.This is mean that the knowledge was a very special thing until we must always find it until we die.Actually,in this scene give us an advice that we don’t feel enough with the knowledge that we have now.\n\nc.Teaching and Educating (how to be good and patient teacher)\n\nIn this film,Ahmad Dahlan teach us how to be a patient and good teacher.He show it,when he teaches the religion to the students in the government school.He didn’t only teach them but he also educate them to be a good Muslim people and discipline students.He teach with the patient heart as a good teacher.\n\nvReligion Values (Islamic)\n\n1)Faith to Allah or Almighty God\n\nIn this film, we can see Ahmad Dahlan give a lecture to the Muslim people to have a faith just to Allah,not to the king or not to the unliving things.And in the Islamic religion doctrine also teach the faith not only to Allah,but also to the to prophet, faith to destiny (qada and qadar).\n\nHe say,\n\n”Al Islaamu huwa Adiin,yang berarti Islam adalah agama Rahmatan lil ‘aalamin yaitu merahmati siapapun yang bernaung dibawahnya baik orang Islam maupun bukan Islam.Merahmati artinya mengayomi,melindungi,membuat damai,tidak mengekang,tidak membuat takut dan tidak membuat rumit dengan upacara dan sesaji.Dalam hadis Qudsi ,Allah berkata: “Bahwa sesungguhnya Aku (Tuhan) begitu dengan mahklukku,maka berdoalah padaku dengan sungguh-sungguh dan mohon ampun,maka niscaya Aku akan mengabulkan”.Jadi,dalam berdoa itu harus sabar dan ikhlas bukan kepada Kyai,khatib,imam,apalagi sesaji tetapi langsung pada Allah”.\n\nIn this film,Ahmad Dahlan also explain to his students/his followers what the meaning of the religion.He say that the religion is a something that give a peaceful in our life.And the people that have the religion is the people that can feel the estetic thing,peaceful,cheerful life and the happiness life.Because in the fact, the religion is like a music can make the people feel happy.\n\n2)Relation with Allah swt.\n\nIn this film,we can show Ahmad Dahlan do his relation with Allah swt. through his pray and religious proselytizing.Because of that,he think that he must erect the true Islamic doctrine.\n\n3)Do the religious proselytizing with love.\n\nFrom Sang Pencerah’s film,we can show Ahmad Dahlan do his religious proselytizing in that time that it is still combine with the Hinddhu culture by using the love language,until although he has the different opinion with some Muslim canonist in its area.In that time,Ahmad Dahlan still respect them.And with the love language,he become very tolerance to the distinction that has in that time.There is a scene in Sang Pencerah’s film that show one of the Kauman’s people who said to Ahmad Dahlan that he want to make the praying event to memorize the 40 days of his parent death day.But he/she doesn’t have the money to buy the thin cakes and the other cakes.And Ahmad Dahlan reply him that he must not to buy the thin cakes or reading the Al-Yasin letter.But,the important thing is he must pray for his parent with the deeply heart.And the God (Allah saw) may accept hispray for his parent.Not have the forbidden from the God (Allah saw) in this case.And He only want to tell that Islam is easy.\n\nvSocial Values\n\n1) Vanishing the fanatism\n\nIn our oponion after analysing this film through many mass media,we have one conclusion that can we take from the film.The conclusion is “the cause from the broken of the people life especially in Indonesian people life is cause by the fanatism.Why is it like that?Because the person that have the fanatism character will be an arrogant person and think that the other group/person is wrong.Until when have a dialogue,often it will not finishing the problems.Because the person that have the characteristic like in above,will dominate by his egoism character until the person doesn’t want to accept an oponion from the others.\n\n2) Make a good relation with family and society\n\nFrom this film, Ahmad Dahlan and his family have a good relation.They are supporting to each other and always together to face the life problems.And in the film,Ahmad Dahlan also take care his relation with the society in his village.Although, only half of the society in his village,that not good to him,but he still make the good relation with them.\n\n3)Move in the goodness life and the life repairing\n\nIn the Sang Pencerah’s film,we can show Ahmad Dahlan and his five followers/students have an initiative to build the Muhammadiyah Islamic Organization that it is a social organization at the time to help the poor people.With helping them and giving them the education.Something like this that must have in the soul of the new generations in this modern era.Because,something that we need in this time is move and move.Certainly,the education problems in this time is the meadow of the government.But,it is also our homework as the nation elements. When the government is still feel tired with this problem,so we as the new generations have to do something to make our education nationality become a success education and have the qualities.The critics can you give to us but it must also the solution.So,don’t only to give the critics,but doesn’t have the contribution.\n\nvMoral Values\n\n1)Patiently,strong, and persistently in defend something true\n\nIf we sure something that it is true,we must defend it with our persistenly heart.In the Sang Pencerah’s film show how do Ahmad Dahlan defend the true Islamic religion doctrine that suitable with the Al-Quran and the Islam prophet doctrine.Although he ever called as a unbeliever Islam teacher,but he still strong and patiently in defend the religion values that he thinks true.\n\n2)The wife’s duties in her husband struggling life\n\nThere is a scene that show that Ahmad Dahlan’s spirit ever low down.But,his wife give the motivation to him with saying this sentences,”Intansrullohu yansurkum wayutsabbit aqdamakum”,and his wife says again that she will always support what does Ahmad Dahlan have do.So,from this film we can show the romantical of Ahmad Dahlan and his wife.\n\n3)Helping the poor people\n\nIn this film,we can see in one of the scene that Ahmad Dahlan helps the poor people like the poor childrens with give them the food to eat and the education.This is the scene:\n\nf)Diction(Language Style)\n\nDiction is the language style that use to extend his ideas with using a language media with the precious words and sentences.The diction in Sang Pencerah’s film as one of the film’s creation that come from the life realities that have in the society life.In the Sang Pencerah’s film use the formal and non-formal language as the language medium,in order to make the watcher enjoin it and understand it.\n\nI.Ahmad Dahlan Ideas in Sang Pencerah’s Film\n\nThere are the ideas of Ahmad Dahlan in Sang Pencerah’s film,in 3 broad:\n\na.Religion\n\nØChanging the mosque direction to Mecca, that first its direction is directing the West direct to be 23 degree with slanting direction from its first position.\n\nØErecting back to the Al-Quran and As Sunnah\n\nØDissapearing the tradition practice that having the wrong direction of Islamic religion for the people who do it.\n\nb.Social\n\nØBuild the Muhammadiyah Organization that source on Al-Quran and Al-Hadist by give the procendence to the society needs than the individual needs.\n\nØMatching with Al Ma’un letter,Ahmad Dahlan teach the people how to serve and help the poor person.\n\nc.Education\n\nØBuild a religious school as a place to teach the Islamic religion lesson although in its film is still in his surau (religious training center of Islam) that use to teach about the education to the childrens in his village.\n\nII.The Film’s Impact to the People (Watcher)\n\na)The Positive Impacts\n\n§The people will respect to the other people\n\n§The people will feel afraid with the coming of the judgement day between the god and the humanskind.\n\n§And they will try to do the good behaviour after watch this film.\n\n§From the film,an Islamic religious proselytizer in delivering his religious proselytizing can impersonate as the figure of player in film production,without to discourse and sermon as well as in the Islamic meeting.And at the second hand,audiences (watcher) didn’t perceives that they are receiving the lecture from the figure of the religious proselytizer.\n\nb)The Negative Impacts\n\n§The people become worry if the missunderstanding happen in their life between one person and the other person.Because,the film’s story is contrary with the Islamic law and it also damage the faithful of Islamic people.And it had been the faithfulling of the Islamic people that the judgement day will come.But,actually no one people that know when the judgement will coming,only the God (Allah) that know about that.\n\n§This film is made as the religious proselytizing’s media and the film audiences (watcher) just receive it with the passive .Because,the film is one of the performance or the consalation that already being enjoyed by the people.\n\nIII.Sang Pencerah’s Novel\n\nThe picture of Sang Pencerah’s Novel:\n\nThe parts of the Sang Pencerah’s novel\n\nThe forward part of Sang pencerah’s novel\n\nThe backward part of Sang pencerah’s novel\n\nIV.The Concerning of Sang Pencerah’s Film with HAM (The Humans Fundamental Rightful Authority)\n\nSang Pencerah’s film is the film that tells about a famous figure who try to defy the wrong tradition that torment the people and change itto the true tradition. But actually this film contents the things that sensitif and edge out evokes social conflict . And each effort that is attributed to troubleshoot it always tipped on failing. But, stage managers successful make its film is accepted by all circle, and also get stamp as film that inspiratif.\n\nIt exacerbated by moslem religionist clan over there that thrust ceremony that lift the weight abangan's clan (caste that follows islam, but doesn't perform teaching as a whole), so islam over there doesn't become blessing but, as something which is discouraged.\n\nIf we study we will see that quick effloresce feudal system at Jogjakarta's region. Caste system's face is remaining royal Hindu Buddhist still membekas is reassured high rank positions Jogjakarta. This beget religionist over there few uppish. So, sometimes they are not responsive opinion another one since there is that taste they are better of other people.\n\nV.Criticism of Sang Pencerah’s film\n\nvDirection aim and Epistimologi New\n\nCriticism ‘ Pencerah ’ to directions tenor streamlining divide me enough pull. Picture that tersaji adequately represents one epistimologi bethinks that prevailing deep modernists Islamic tradition as Muhammadiyah. Its method: (1 ) refer on authentic text, (2 ) utilize minds and scholarship, (3 ) utilize hearts / intuitions as spiritualnya's footing.\n\nMethod upon in line with concept Bayani (truth text),Burhani (truth mind / iptek),Irfani (truth intuitive) one that affixed deep Manhaj Tarjih Muhammadiyah and Islami's Life Guidance Muhammadiyah's Citizen.\n\n‘Pencerah ’ figures that Kyai Dahlan does to revise direction aim with refer that authentic manual salat has to go to to aim direction, Kakbah at Makkah's city. While to determine direction aim, Kyai Dahlan utilizes Compass and The World Map as a result era developing. And while is asked about method truth surety it, at answer him that “God are conditioner level with another, we just get conspectus ” .\n\nMethod bethinks this also in line with how Bukhori and Moslem develops epistimologi Hadist's research Authentic with develop criticism tradition. Criticism to text (matan), criticism to perawi and context (logic), and also been ended up by istikharoh, get surrender self to God after it maximal conspectus as one intuitive truth search.\n\nVia ‘ Pencerah ’ descries Hanung consistence figures that at the moment wants to revise direction, Kyai Dahlan is an old young man 21 years. So fairly a young man which apparently fails to make sure that ulama's ceremony then is figured ‘ mbalelo ’. She is with not mentaati formal direction aim that terminologicals it false, so comes round Breach direction (mushola) its own.\n\nBut, apparently comment of audience then amends, Kyai Dahlan is looked on is not as Pencerah, but becomes Rebel that don't able. Egoist because as which person keukeuh on truth that be believed and unalives to ulama any other that different.\n\nIs not normal a young man gets age 21 do things that gets konfrontatif's image pleads what do be believed right? Since for a portion audience, harmony, although ambushing on kejumudan bethinks to be looked on its better.\n\nEventually necessarily essence harmonisasi is one process mutually criticism in the context “ Mutually remember to remind in truth and patient ”.\n\nvCriticism to Tradition\n\nWhile there is sharp enough comment while ‘ Pencerah ’ criticize sesaji's purpose on that as javanese Islamic clan practice. Eventually that is done only criticizes, don't muzzle. Try to ask out bethinks re, within reason Descartes what does teach that “ Me bethink therefore I there is ”, or bases sentence is Al Qur first ’ an asks out man to read (Iqro ’).Is not is human esensi is that ever menkritisi her, its forbear, its society?\n\nBe epistimologi upon that necessarily applies to disillusioned man. Bethink with look for otentik's basic is next result accuracy , utilizing mind to look for truth.And questions it with heart to reach goodness . Criticize that berdo ’ a with sesaji what duly, really and well where its false? This is actually that clarification.\n\nUnhappily, there is that have that view Kyai Dahlan's Figure at Pencerah unreasonably becomes Pencerah, since in presepsinya a pencerah is person that don't cause conflict at deep masyarkat. Be this is tercerahakan's public eye difference, where is competition culture, dialectic and dialogue among thinking that becomes to consume their daily. Here is next have front with them that on behalf harmony but shut up self difficult disillusioned.Thing upon also happens on criticism about Nyadran, Tahlilan, Yasinan, selamatan … send away for that Kyai Dahlan asks out to think up back to (are not forbidden) that practice what there is basic it in dogma, or regards its economy aspect and other as it descries it also reap negative comment from khalayak its agent.\n\nIn brief, its gets up tradition criticize is one of masyarkat's tradition characteristic that disillusioned.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nCLOSING\n\nI.Conclusion\n\nSang Pencerah’s film is one of Indonesian film that proper to watching by the all people.This film is connecting with the film’s theme that bulging the nasionalism to the Muhammadiyah Islamic religion.The presence of this film is hopely to awake the watcher to understanding to each other between the different of the common Islam religion with the Muhammadiyah Islamic religion.And Muhammadiyah Islamic religion is a religion that give from the God (Allah saw) and it is a good religion.So, the people properly to respect it.This film has the positive and negative impacts to the people that watching it.\n\nBesides that,this film also give the unique consolation for its watcher because it content the Islamic elements. From this film,the watcher also can get a lot of the life values.Such as,the religion,social,education and moral values for the reflection in their life.With the presence of this film, not only for the Muhammadiyahpeople but for theMoeslem people in whole of Indonesian country with the hopeless that the Moeslem can be aware and seeing who is the big enemy in this time. Not the heathens people or the people from the other religion.\n\nMeanwhile for us, as the Moeslempeople that still bovine (stupid) and blind to the meaning of Islam.Available with our analysis from Sang Pencerah’s film ,we have some important note for the reflection to the Sang Pencerah’s production film team or the other production film team,which are:\n\n1)Sang Pencerah’s film try to ordering the audiences (watcher)about Ahmad Dahlan’s struggling life that content about teh spirit of the young man ,their patriotism representating their ideas.This things will be the inspiration to give the renewal for the nations and follow the character of Ahmad Dahlan.\n\n2)Through Sang Pencerah’s film,with the hopeful to the society that they can be persuade to researching the humanist story to know more about the figure that very closely with his tolerance attitude to the religion and with show this film,we can know the figure of Ahmad Dahlan that also bring the changing for the all of Islamic religion people.\n\n3)We as the analyzer hope that have the same problem analysing as the contrasting in order the creation objectivities can be responbilting by the person that creature it.\n\n4)Basically,the analysing result very depends with the analyzer method by his/her view in showing the film that certainly it must strengthened with many references from the books as the scientific writing pad .\n\nII.Suggestions\n\nAl-muslimu mahjũbun bil muslimin. It is the copy quotation that had told by Ahmad Dahlan to his followers/students when they talking about the bad condition of the Islamic people in that time.And he think that the cause of making the Islam religion be destroy is the Islamic own people or the Moeslem people.That is from mean,the Moeslem people characters and their behaviours are not suitable with the Islamic religion doctrine and Al-Quran,also the examples from Muhammad saw prophet.So,we as the undamage Moeslem peoples that still have a healthy brains and good intellectual,it is best to us to know about the condition of the Moeslem people in the colonial era and how hard the Muhammadiyah Islamic Organization’s struggling to opposition the society opinion that is contrary with the true Islamic religion doctrine. And from this film, all of it will be get it.So,let us together to make our nation become a new nation that have a good brains intellectual,good character/ behaviour and the develop of an ideology.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1)For the film maker,you all must acentuate with the religious proselytizing and the story ideas in making the film.And for the audience,you all must be thrifty in understanding the meaning of the film that had present until you can understand the positive value of the film.\n\n2)To academicians that have the smart thinking can give the new peripheral analysis to understanding the meaning of the messages from the mass media,especially the film.\n\nIII.Solution\n\nIt is the time to having the person or the new generations that have the same character with K.H.Ahmad Dahlan,not only for his puring and the clearing of social system that have the religion practices,but also for the government and the social system in the society that we think it is wrong.Allah saw will not only changing the of the ethnic’s fate,if they don't try to change their fate. Although,maybe we only a few person or one person that yearns the changing for the more clearing and the more peaceful life.Never to be irritated,evenless feel stranging to the other people. We can see in the film through Fahrudin, KH Ahmad Dahlan's student that gives the moral value and religion value as the tremendous messages to us in order that to make our spirit become smolder and don’t low down.So,for the Moeslem people especially for the people of Muhammadiyah Islamic religion don’t feel like that.Because, actually the people that feel stranging are the lucky people that changing all about the wrong things in our life.for God or Allah saw,everything is not impossible in this world.Many things that we think it can’t be happen but for God it can be happen.\n\nIV.Closing Word\n\nSuch that, we can explain about the analysis of Sang Pencerah’s filmthat it is the main subjectdiscussion in this KBA task.Certainly,this paper or this task still have many lackness and its weakness.Because of the limited knowledge and the reducing of the referencesthat connected with the task title.\n\nWe as the writers very hopeful to the readers to give the critics and suggestions (tips) to us in order that we can make our next analysis task to be perfect in the next chance. Hopefully this analysis paper or task can be useful good for the readers especially for us as the writer .\n\n,."
