        "text": "The Phoenix Suns made an unbelievably great trade to acquire a top 20 player in the league in Jason Richardson while dropping a bad contract and dead weight in Boris Diaw and Raja Bell.\n\nDiaw has not been the same player since he won the most improved player award and Amare Stoudemire came back to the suns. Once Amare came back, Diaw became a timid player who would rather pass to a three-point shooter than lay in a basket from four feet.\n\nAs Eddie Johnson would always say, “Boris is the only person that can guard Boris.” The Problem for Diaw is that Stoudemire is the Suns’ future.\n\nRaja Bell has openly showed his frustration and unwillingness to change with the suns and their new coach. In all reality, Bell is looking like he is 38 and not 32. He gets accolades for his defense, but by watching him every game, he looks lost and like he’s not giving his all. Something had to change.\n\nThe suns new GM Steve Kerr somehow pulled out this fantastic trade. He got rid of two average players to get a great player. On paper, the Suns now look as good as the Suns team with Joe Johnson with a strong starting lineup.\n\nThis brings me back to Steve Nash. The guy is still a stud. However, the statements he is making, and his unnecessary turnovers this year are making people wonder; does he even want to be in Phoenix anymore?\n\nNash felt the Suns unfairly moved D'Antoni this offseason when the reason he left is because he doesn’t believe in teaching defense, developing a bench, or young players. His philosophy had to go for the Suns to get past the second round of the playoffs and to stay a top team in the West.\n\nNow Nash feels blindsided that the Suns traded his two best friends from the team. Steve, do you want to win a NBA championship, or play on a team with your friends? As a professional athlete making ten million dollars a year, you need to quit whining like a college freshman and make this team a winner. You have all the parts necessary for a championship.\n\nThe Suns have a great GM, coach, starting lineup, and even a deeper bench than the past. Steve, do not lose the heart you have shown your fans for the past four years. Most of your die-hard fans still believe you can bring the Suns to the NBA finals. With the addition of Jason Richardson and the release of Bell and Diaw the Suns can now rise again to an elite team."
