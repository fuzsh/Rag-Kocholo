        "text": "SAGINAW, MI – After taking 100 jump shots, a 14-year-old Jason Richardson stood alone on the blacktop court of Sherman Park.\n\nAs the sun was setting on the Carrollton Township neighborhood, he looked up at the rim with a new thought.\n\n“I wonder if I can dunk now?” he said.\n\n“And when I did it, I literally ran down to my grandma’s house and dragged the whole family back to the park. I’m talking aunts, uncles, brothers, cousins. I brought ‘em all down there and just started dunking constantly.”\n\nA new day had dawned for Richardson. And the basketball world would never be the same again.\n\nGREATEST DUNKERS IN MICHIGAN HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY\n\nRichardson’s above-the-rim brand of ball would spring him to wondrous heights at Saginaw Arthur Hill and Michigan State University, and a 14-year career in the NBA – energizing teammates, entertaining fans and electrifying arenas along the way.\n\nNow a 39-year-old hoops legend, Richardson stands alone once more as the greatest dunker in Michigan high school basketball history, as nominated by readers and selected by MLive sports writers.\n\nRichardson became a master of elevation and levitation, doing things on the basketball court that left heads spinning and fans grinning. He packed highlight reel after highlight reel with his soaring and scoring, thundering the ball through the rim in a nightly show of force and dominance.\n\n“I wanted to rip the rim off every time I dunked,” he said. “I always watched Dominique (Wilkins) and the way he attacked the rim, that’s what everybody remembers. When the game was on the line, I wanted to do something spectacular so you didn’t forget about it.”\n\nRichardson left a trail of incredible stories everywhere he went, unleashing an array of superhuman slam dunks that sent the excitement level in the gymnasium rocketing through the roof.\n\n“The fans always went nuts for Jason,” said Greg McMath, who was an assistant coach at Arthur Hill during the Richardson era. “The crowds would be standing up because they knew at any time Jason was going to do something freaky and special. Everybody would be on the edge of their seat. All they had to do was wait five minutes, something was coming.”\n\nRichardson grew up watching Wilkins and Michael Jordan turn the dunk into an art form on TV, and seeing big brothers Duane and Damion put that notion into action right before his very eyes.\n\n“I remember putting a wire clothes hanger on the door, getting a sock and practicing the dunks that I saw those guys do,” Richardson said. “I always envisioned doing the things they were doing in the NBA dunk contests.”\n\nIt wasn’t long between his first dunk at Sherman Park and first in-game display, which came during his freshman year when he played junior varsity at Saginaw Nouvel.\n\n“It was a fastbreak, they threw the ball to me and I went up and dunked,” he recalled. “It wasn’t quite a dunk, if you ask my uncle Brian Bowen, because it rattled in. But I counted it.”\n\nRichardson transferred to Arthur Hill and rose to prominence as one of the state’s premier players. As a senior in 1999, he led the Lumberjacks to their first state finals appearance in 47 years. The 6-foot-6 forward garnered McDonald’s All-American honors and was named Mr. Basketball as the top prep player in Michigan.\n\nPlaying alongside another legendary leaper in DeAndre Hulett – and against the likes of Eugene Seals, Anthony Roberson and Charles Rogers – Richardson helped send the Arthur Hill vs. Saginaw High rivalry into a new stratosphere. The 1999 game was moved to Saginaw Civic Center and drew 6,000 fans for one of the most memorable moments in series history.\n\nWhile Saginaw won the game 78-64, everybody left talking about Richardson’s unfathomable dunk, coming off an alley-oop pass that point guard Tyron McMath fired from nearly three-quarters of the court away.\n\n“Tyron gets the ball, and I put my arm up for him to throw it early. I had the advantage of a step and I thought I could catch it, dribble in and dunk,” Richardson said. “But Tyron throws it toward the rim, and it was perfect -- the pass was better than the dunk. I just went up and got it and… Boom! They had to pause the game because the fans were running out of their seats. It was like an out-of-body experience for me.”\n\nRichardson’s prep career would feature a series of remarkable dunks, be it of the 360, windmill, tomahawk or alley-oop variety. He said he saw each dunk as an opportunity to energize his team, deflate the opposition and let everybody know exactly who they were dealing with in this game.\n\n“For me, it is kind of a pride thing,” he said. “My senior year against Flint Northwestern, I was having a terrible game and they were beating us by 20. I was just named McDonald’s All-American and the fans were calling me a Burger King All-American. I knew I had to do something to let them know ‘Yeah, I’m having a bad game, but you’ll never forget me.’\n\n“The ball came off the rim and I swear it felt like my whole waist was over the rim. I was trying to tear that rim down. I was so mad and so frustrated. I came down and just screamed at the fans – and they all got up and started clapping for me.”\n\nRichardson’s high-flying act would continue at each progressing level. He helped Michigan State capture the 2000 national championship as a freshman, then earned second-team All-American honors as a sophomore.\n\nHe was taken with the No. 5 overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors and launched a 14-year professional career. A member of the NBA All-Rookie Team, he made his grandest splash by winning the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in back-to-back seasons. He would go on to score 14,644 points with 4,265 rebounds and 2,284 assists in his NBA career but was forever known for his dunking.\n\n“It can be a blessing and a curse,” he said. “I won two straight dunk contests and the third year, I didn’t really want to do it. I didn’t want to be labeled a dunker. I could dribble, I could shoot, I wanted to be known as a complete player.”\n\nToday, Richardson and his wife, Jackie, are residing in Denver and keeping an eye on the next wave of basketball talent as daughter Jaela and sons Jaxon and Jase all follow in their father’s footsteps. At 14, Jase recently reached a familiar milestone by throwing down his first dunk. It was an occasion that made his famous father take a new look at an old skill.\n\n“My wife said ‘Yeah, he’s dunking, but it’s not spectacular. When you did it, your head was at the rim.’ I said ‘Jackie, that’s not normal. Not everybody’s head is at the rim. That’s just something I had in me.’ And, until I was saying that, I don’t think I ever realized that,” Richardson said.\n\n“I’ve done it so much and for so long that I never really thought about it. But, looking back, I’m pretty glad that I was able to do it.”\n\nRELATED READING\n\n3-pointer changed high school basketball, for better or worse\n\nIs 4-point shot too crazy to consider?\n\nSmaller ball created big change for girls basketball"
