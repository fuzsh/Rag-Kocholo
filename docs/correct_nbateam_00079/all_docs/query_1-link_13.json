        "text": "Former Arthur Hill and Michigan State basketball star Jason Richardson, currently playing with the NBA's Phoenix Suns, was recently moved from the team's starting rotation into a backup role. For the first time since his rookie year eight years ago, Richardson will be used as a reserve, and he's having trouble understanding the move by Phoenix coach Alvin Gentry.\n\nGentry said the change was not for anything done poorly by Richardson, who had not been a reserve since his rookie season for any reason other than returning from injury or arriving close to game time after the Suns trade.\n\n\"Obviously, I don't want anything like that to happen,\" Richardson said. \"I think I'm a good player who can do things.\n\n\"I don't know what's going on. I've never come off the bench my whole career. If that's something they want me to do, I'm willing to do it. I'm the type of guy that just wants to win. I'm a professional. I'm always coming to do my job and play hard.\"\n\nWhat the Suns gain in adding Lopez to the defensive first five, they could lose some with Barbosa rather than Richardson. Plus, the Suns are 12-2 when Richardson scores 20 points.\n\n\"It's kind of mind-boggling,\" Richardson said. \"It bothered me a little bit. I'm going to go out there with minutes I get and do what I can to help the team win.\n\nIt's a little unfair, but if that's what it's going to take to make our team successful, that's the major thing with me.\""
