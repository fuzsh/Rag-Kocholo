        "text": "ORLANDO – The NBA has changed Jared Dudley’s uniform and residence for four consecutive years since his original Suns stay ended after 4 ½ seasons.\n\nIt also has changed his game.\n\nBasketball has come full circle for Jared Dudley, the Boston College power forward who could not get playing time in Charlotte or Phoenix until Alvin Gentry became the Suns head coach and, with his first move, added the swingman with the braids to the rotation.\n\nThe braids quickly came off but the wing label lasted until he left Phoenix and the league placed more emphasis on shooting in big men, creating the “spread four” power forward.\n\nGET THE SUNS APP: iPhone | Android\n\nIn Milwaukee, Washington and now Phoenix, Dudley has filled that role as one of the game’s better shooters with enough court savvy to battle with many power forwards.\n\n“A guy like Jared is well-suited to play the 'four' these days,” said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, the former Suns general manager who traded for him and Jason Richardson in 2008. “There aren’t a lot of guys who are going to overpower him down on the block with post-ups. Most of the league is spreading the floor and shooting 3s and it’s been good for him.”\n\nGentry was the first one to think Dudley deserved a regular role but he never imagined Dudley holding down the power forward spot then at 6 feet 7.\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Gentry, now the New Orleans head coach. “We talk about it all the time. He’s the least athletic 'four' in the history of the game. But he did win the bets with his dunks that one year when he said he’d have 10.\n\n“He’s just a really smart player. He refined his game to be in this league. Sometimes, that’s tough to do. He can still shoot the ball with range. He’s very efficient. He’s a really smart player. I think he ‘s really good with young players. I know (Suns coach) Earl (Watson) really wanted him back and I can understand why.”\n\nDudley, 31, signed the richest contract of his career to return to Phoenix when he also had offers from Utah and Brooklyn.\n\nGUARDS: Suns go heavy on 3-guard look minus T.J. Warren\n\nWashington did not pursue re-signing him, except to make a free-agency call to put him on the back burner while it pursued Kevin Durant, Al Horford and others.\n\n“If anything, I might owe (Wizards President) Ernie (Grunfeld) a bottle of wine for taking me to help get me in this situation to play with John Wall and show everyone what I could at the 'four',” Dudley said upon his Monday return to Washington.\n\nDudley has delivered with his skills on the court and his leadership off the court and backed up his stated willingness to move to the bench when a rookie was ready to start. Marquese Chriss’ timeline was fast-forwarded to add size and athleticism to the starting lineup and fortify the bench with Dudley’s glue game.\n\nRELATED:Eric Bledsoe links Suns', NBA's youngest starting 5s\n\nDudley is shooting a career-high 49 percent from the field and, entering Wednesday's game, had his best 3-point percentage (44.2) since the Suns’ conference finals season of 2009-10. Since the lineup switch eight games ago, prior to Wednesday's game in Orlando, Dudley’s bench numbers (10.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game with 51.6 percent shooting) topped what he was averaging as a starter (6.4 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game with 44.1 percent shooting).\n\n“He’s been amazing, especially for our second unit coming in and being able to stabilize and quarterback the second unit offense and defense,” Suns coach Earl Watson said. “He understands his limitations but he does the best he can do within his abilities. That’s a great role model for our guys to have in the locker room.”\n\nMORE SUNS: Rookie Tyler Ulis stays sharp for rare chance\n\nDudley is averaging 25.2 minutes per game, right in line with his career average of 24.3. He exceeded 30 minutes per game only once, on his last Suns team in 2011-12.\n\n“If I wasn’t playing and wearing a suit, we’re trying to bring Marquese along,” Dudley said. “His development is key for this franchise moving forward.”"
