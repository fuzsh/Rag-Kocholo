        "text": "Former Arthur Hill star Jason Richardson is the Phoenix Suns' leading scorer in the post-season, but is overshadowed by teammates Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire.\n\nPrior to the Suns' Game 3 against the Los Angeles Lakers, Richardson's career playoff average was 19.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists. This season, he has been the NBA best post-season 3-point shooter, making more than 50 percent from the arc.\n\nazcentral.com: \"When he's involved, it seems to get everybody involved,\" Suns coach Alvin Gentry said. \"Obviously, when you look at the record (the Suns are 31-5 when Richardson tops 20 points), we try to get him going early in the game. He's played really good basketball for us.\""
