        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPHOENIX — Jason Richardson scored 29 points, reserve Hakim Warrick had a season-high 25 and the Phoenix Suns kept the Los Angeles Clippers winless on the road with a 116-108 victory on Friday night.\n\nThe victory was the Suns’ ninth in a row over the Clippers and extended their home winning streak against Los Angeles to seven. No visiting Pacific Division team other than the Los Angeles Lakers has left US Airways Center with a win since April 17, 2007 — a total of 27 games. Besides the Clippers, the Suns have won 10 straight at home against both Sacramento and Golden State.\n\nSteve Nash added 16 points and 10 assists for the Suns, Channing Frye scored 16 with four three-pointers and Grant Hill had 12.\n\nEric Gordon topped the Clippers with 32 points, Ryan Gomes had a season-high 20, and Blake Griffin had 20 points and 14 rebounds. Brian Cook had 16 points and 10 rebounds in the Clippers’ eighth consecutive road loss of the season and their 12th straight over two years.\n\nJust like in their previous game, the Suns got out quickly, opening a 25-point advantage in the first quarter at 42-17 — their highest-scoring period of the season. They led by 21 in the second quarter before settling for a 67-51 halftime lead. At that stage, Richardson already had 22 points, hitting nine of 12 shots, including four-of-six three-pointers.\n\nAfter an opening basket by the Clippers, Richardson reeled off nine straight points, and the Suns were off and running. A field goal and a three-point play by Hill gave the Suns a 14-4 lead and Los Angeles never got within single digits again until the third period.\n\nWarrick also was a big contributor in the first half, scoring 16 points with five rebounds, while Hill had 10 points and five assists.\n\nUnlike their previous game, when they squandered leads of 23 points in the first half, 18 after three periods and 12 entering the fourth quarter before losing in double-overtime to Chicago, the Suns did not falter this time.\n\nGomes connected on three three-pointers in the first half and led the Clippers with 13 points, while Gordon scored 11 but hit only 4-of-11 shots.\n\nThe Clippers whittled the deficit to four points twice in the third quarter, the last at 75-71, before the Suns went on a 23-10 run, ending the period with a 98-81 lead. During that burst, Frye made two three-pointers and Richardson and Nash one apiece. Throughout the game, both teams were extremely accurate on three-pointers, the Suns finishing 12 of 25 and the Clippers 11 of 24.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the closest Los Angeles got was 114-108, but its rally fell short."
