        "text": "Two decades ago, Jason Richardson was among the most exciting players of the early years of the Tom Izzo era at Michigan State as he helped the Spartans go to two Final Fours and win a national championship as a high-flying, athletic guard.\n\nNow, his son is set to follow in his footsteps.\n\nJase Richardson, a four-star 2024 guard, announced his commitment to the Spartans on Sunday.\n\nIn a televised commitment on ESPN2, Richardson said he was drawn to Michigan State by Izzo’s history developing point guards.\n\n“With A.J. Hoggard, Tyson Walker, watching them last year, I feel like he’s done a great job developing his guards and getting them ready,” Richardson said.\n\nRichardson, a 6-foot-3, 180-pound combo guard, chose Michigan State over Alabama, Cincinnati and others. He’s rated as the No. 35 player in his class in the 247sports composite rankings.\n\nAfter overcoming a significant knee injury midway through his high school career, Richardson returned to the court this past summer and put up strong numbers. At Nike’s Peach Jam summer basketball tournament in July, he scored more than 20 points per game while shooting 56 percent from the field and dishing out 4.2 assists.\n\n“Just a lot of energy,” Richardson said when asked what he will bring to Michigan State. “I feel like I’m a high-energy guy. Definitely going to bring some offense. I feel like I’m a playmaker, I can really (make plays) for the team and be an all-around guy for the team.”\n\nJason Richardson went from a two-year Michigan State career from 1999-2001 to 13 years in the NBA that included winning back-to-back slam dunk contests.\n\nThe younger Richardson is set to play his senior season for Columbus High School in Miami this winter after previously playing for Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas.\n\nMichigan State now has three players committed for the 2024 season. Only three of 14 Big Ten teams had that many 2024 commits as of Sunday.\n\nRichardson joins four-star Massachusetts wing Kur Teng and three-star Ohio forward Jesse McCulloch in the Spartans’ 2024 class.\n\nThe trio an formalize their commitments in early November on college basketball’s early signing day."
