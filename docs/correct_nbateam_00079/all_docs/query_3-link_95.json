        "text": "With the Warriors not participating in the league’s Orlando return, the next important date on Golden State’s calendar will come on draft day. For the first time since 2002, the Warriors will be on the clock in the top five.\n\nBefore October’s draft rolls around, Warriors Wire is rewinding through Golden State’s draft history to highlight the most memorable selections — trades, surprises, busts, sleepers and everything in between.\n\nLong before the Warriors added Draymond Green in the second round of the 2012 draft, Golden State found success with another Michigan State product in 2001.\n\nJuly 27, 2001\n\nThe Washington Wizards started the 2001 draft selecting Kwame Brown out of Glynn Academy in Georgia. Fast forward four picks, and the Golden State Warriors were on the clock.\n\nWith the No. 5 overall selection in the draft, Golden State general manager Gary St. Jean selected Jason Richardson out of Michigan State. Later in the draft, the Warriors added Notre Dame’s Troy Murphy and Arizona’s Gilbert Arenas.\n\nAs a sophomore in Tom Izzo’s program, Richardson was named a second-team All American, averaging 14.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.2 steals per contest. Alongside fellow first-rounder Zach Randolph, the duo helped lead the Spartans to the 2001 NCAA Tournament Final Four.\n\nWatch highlights from Richardson’s run in East Lansing via YouTube:\n\nAs a rookie, Richardson started 75 games averaging 14.4 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.3 steals per game. Richardson’s impressive debut campaign earned him a nod to the NBA’s All-Rookie First Team.\n\nThe Michigan State product showed off at the 2002 All-Star Weekend in Philadelphia, earning Most Valuable Player of the Rising Stars Challenge and winning the Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nWatch highlights from Richardson’s Slam Dunk Championship via YouTube:\n\nOutside of the Golden State trio and Randolph, other notable selections from the 2001 draft class included Tyson Chandler, Spain’s Paul Gasol, Duke’s Shane Battier, Arkansas’ Joe Johnson, Arizona’s Richard Jefferson and France’s Tony Parker."
