        "text": "Former Arthur Hill star Jason Richardson has become one of the leaders of a surprising Phoenix Suns' team so far this season.\n\nThe Suns now officially join Boston as having a \"Big 3\" at the offensive end of things. Jason Richardson has turned out to be the perfect complement to, if not initiator of, the Suns offense. The Suns are 7-0 in games in which he goes for 20 or more points. Please remember that when cooking up trade scenarios involving his \"fat\" contract.\n\nMore on Jason Richardson: After a rough 2008-2009 campaign on defense, J-Rich seems to have stepped up his game. He might be the Suns most reliable starting on-ball defender and hasn't been burned too many times on his help defense either. 16 games in to a season marked by consistent leadership from the bench (and on the court for that matter), it's a lot easier to why the Suns traded for him last year."
