        "text": "December 10, 2008 – Dr. Dime\n\nBreaking News: The Phoenix Suns have just acquired a two-time NBA Slam Dunk Champion! If you thought the Suns were athletic before get a load of their new look line-up that boasts Amare Stoudemire, Matt Barnes, and Jason Richardson. That’s right, the Suns have traded defensive specialist Raja Bell and utility player Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats for Jason Richardson.\n\nCouple that Suns line-up of Stoudemire, Barnes, and Richardson with two past league MVP’s in Steve Nash and Shaquille O’Neal and you have one versatile set of starters. Richardson isn’t just an athletic jumper though, he’s got one of the better outside strokes in the league and is an underrated defender. I expect this move from the Bobcats to a contending team like Phoenix should re-energize Richardson’s outlook and motivation on the court.\n\nFor the Bobcats this move makes a lot of sense as they have an abundance of scoring wing players, a weak perimeter defense which Raja Bell will help to steady, and could use a versatile player like Boris Diaw to help with interior scoring and ball movement from the inside out.\n\nOne other thought….tonight Phoenix should be really short handed against the LA Lakers without O’Neal, Bell, Diaw, Singletary, and without their new acquisition."
