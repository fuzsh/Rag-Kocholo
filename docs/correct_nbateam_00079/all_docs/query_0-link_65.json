        "text": "After being arrested for allegations that he was driving 55 mph above the speed limit with his unrestrained toddler son in the car, The Phoenix Suns have suspended Jason Richardson for one game without pay.\n\nIn a brief statement late Monday afternoon, the Suns said Richardson would miss Tuesday night’s home game against the Los Angeles Clippers “for conduct detrimental to the team.”\n\nA Scottsdale police officer first saw Richardson driving 67 mph in a 40 mph zone Sunday night and followed him, police said Monday. That’s when the officer clocked him at 90 mph in a 35 mph zone and pulled him over.\n\nPolice said Richardson admitted to speeding and identified himself as a Suns player. The officer saw Richardson’s three-year-old son in the back seat of the car and that he was not in a child seat.\n\nRichardson said he had taken his son to dinner and was on his way home.\n\nHe was arrested and charged with reckless driving, excessive speeding and failure to use a child seat. He was released from jail after a few hours.\n\nPolice said Richardson’s fiancee responded to the scene of the stop and took custody of the boy.\n\nIt was Richardson’s second run-in with the law since the Dec. 12 trade that brought him to Phoenix from Charlotte in exchange for Raja Bell, Boris Diaw and Sean Singletary.\n\nRichardson was cited Dec. 21 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nInformation from the Associated Press contributed to this report."
