Channing Frye had 10 points, matching his career best with a 10th straight double-figure game, and grabbed 10 rebounds.\n\nMonta Ellis scored 38 points for the Warriors, who have lost four straight at home and seven of eight overall. David Lee added 25 points and Dorell Wright had 10 points and a season-high 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Suns led 52-49 at the half.\n\nThe teams both surpassed the century mark for the 18th straight time in their series, dating to January, 2006.\n\nRichardson and Hill combined to shoot 73 percent (19 of 26) from the field, while the rest of the team combined for 44.6 percent.\n\nPhoenix took a 75-72 lead into the fourth quarter.
