        "text": "Jason Richardson is founder and CEO of Bad Birdie, an irreverent apparel brand that targets \"a new generation of players,\" he said. Richardson discusses his young company and some lessons learned on his entrepreneurial journey.\n\nThe First Call: Please give us a short overview of your company.\n\nJason Richardson: Bad Birdie is a modern day golf apparel brand ushering in a new generation of players who prioritize a good game and a better time without compromising performance.\n\nTFC: What is your handicap index?\n\nJR: 10\n\nTFC: What time do you wake in the morning, and what time do you typically start the workday?\n\nJR: 530 a.m. wakeup, then gym, then office by 9 a.m.\n\nTFC: What are key elements to leadership or to being a good leader?\n\nJR: I view becoming a better leader like chasing infinity. There's no final number/score you can hit, just a continuous chase for improvement. I seek wisdom from other people outside Bad Birdie with more experience, read books and always ask for feedback from my team.\n\nTFC: What changes, if any, have you made based on the events of the past year?\n\nJR: We're investing a lot in growing our team and building out more systems and structure to make sure we grow with clear vision and accountability.\n\nTFC: What's the secret to your success?\n\nJR: I like to think of everything in a growing versus dying mentality. Everything in life -- your business, your garden, your relationships -- is either growing or dying in some way (even if very small movements in either direction). If you continue to pursue growth, you'll see long-term success.\n\nTFC: Who is your role model?\n\nJR: I don't have one specific role model, but follow a lot of other young founders in the D2C space.\n\nTFC: Knowing what you know today, what professional advice would you give a younger you?\n\nJR: Believe in yourself more.\n\nTFC: What’s the last book you read?\n\nJR: “Good to Great” by Jim Collins.\n\nTFC: What’s the last movie you saw?\n\nJR: \"Remember the Titans.\"\n\nTFC: What’s on your playlist?\n\nJR: Been jamming to Lany recently.\n\nTFC: When I’m not at work, you can find me ...\n\nJR: Happy hour with my wife.\n\nTFC: What is your greatest extravagance?\n\nJR: Fancy coffee.\n\nTFC: What was your path to the golf industry?\n\nJR: My first job as a kid was a caddie at Forest Highlands in Arizona when I was 12-years old. In high school, I worked for an eBay store in Scottsdale called Golf Shafts Depot where we sold pull-out shafts that were left over from local clubfitters. I had a 10-year hiatus from golf until I started Bad Birdie in my apartment"
