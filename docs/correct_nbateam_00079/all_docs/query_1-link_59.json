        "text": "Jason Tilton returns to the Beach as the program’s Special Assistant. Tilton previously spent two seasons as the program’s Director of Basketball Operations before moving to the NBA as a Video Coordinator for the Phoenix Suns.\n\nA Southern California native who helped lead the Irvine-based Woodbridge High School basketball team to a CIF title in 1997, Tilton returns to the West Coast after spending three years at St. John’s University on Steve Lavin’s staff as a graduate and administrative assistant while earning his master’s degree. As a member of the staff with the Red Storm, Tilton was responsible for co-directing the men’s basketball program and overseeing a number of operations, as well as assisting with the basketball team’s social media platforms and community and fundraising efforts.\n\nPrior to his time at St. John’s, Tilton spent one season with the Los Angeles Clippers as a video coordinator, cutting scouting material and assisting the Clippers coaching staff. That position came on the heels of a season with familiar Big West foe Cal State Fullerton, where he served as the Director of Basketball Operations on the staff of Bob Burton.\n\nWhile completing a bachelor’s degree at UCLA, Tilton spent four seasons as a team manager and one as an administrative assistant with the Bruins from 1997-2002 during Lavin’s tenure as head coach."
