        "text": "SAN ANTONIO — Tim Duncan had 20 points and 15 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs won their ninth in a row, 118-110 over the Phoenix Suns, who played undermanned again Monday night following their blockbuster trade.\n\nGary Neal scored 22 off the bench for the Spurs, who improved the NBA’s best record to 24-3 and are one victory from their second double-digit winning streak already this season.\n\nJared Dudley had 27 points for the Suns, who were still waiting to unite with trade acquisitions Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat and Mickael Pietrus. They’re expected to be ready for Phoenix’s next game Thursday against Miami.\n\nPhoenix played a night after upsetting Oklahoma City. But using only eight players, the Suns saw their halftime lead rapidly dissolve into a near-blowout.\n\nFatigue could have been a culprit. Grant Hill, who had 30 points and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes on Sunday against the Thunder, scored 19 points in 39 minutes. The 38-year-old entered the game averaging around 30 minutes.\n\nSteve Nash added 17 points and 10 assists for Phoenix.\n\nThe Spurs are on another long winning streak after putting together 12 consecutive victories earlier this season. It has put the surprising Spurs atop the NBA in the midst of a historic franchise start for the four-time champions.\n\nTony Parker scored 19 points, Richard Jefferson had 17 and Manu Ginobili had 15 as every starter for the Spurs was in double figures. DeJuan Blair had 10 points and eight rebounds.\n\nPhoenix returned to San Antonio for the first time since its stunning sweep in the West semifinals last May, but after the latest Suns shake-up, it wasn’t exactly a rematch.\n\nPhoenix on Sunday completed a six-player trade with Orlando, sending Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkoglu and Earl Clark to the Magic. Carter and Gortat arrived in Phoenix on Monday while their new team was still in Texas.\n\nSuns coach Alvin Gentry — who joked before the game that he came back to San Antonio with the same team except for “that Amare guy” — said before Monday’s game that he’s already thought about how he’ll use his newcomers.\n\nFor a few stretches against San Antonio, the short-handed Suns didn’t look desperate for their new trio just yet. Phoenix took a 54-53 halftime lead after finishing the second quarter on a 21-7 burst, holding the Spurs to just three field goals in the final seven minutes.\n\nBut a bumbling start to the second half doomed Phoenix. And quickly.\n\nPhoenix scored on just two of its first 14 possessions of the third quarter, evaporating a one-point lead into a 19-point deficit in a span of only six minutes.\n\nJosh Childress scored 15 points and Robin Lopez had 14 for the Suns. Channing Frye had just three points for the Suns on 1-of-10 shooting.\n\nNotes: Spurs G George Hill is expected to miss several more games while recovering from a sore right big toe. Hill, the top scorer for the Spurs off the bench, is wearing a boot on the foot. ...The Suns have already used seven different starting lineups after using eight all of last season."
