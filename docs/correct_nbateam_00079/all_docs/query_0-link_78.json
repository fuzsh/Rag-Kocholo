Booker's smooth shooting stroke and off-the-dribble scoring prowess have made him one of the most potent offensive weapons in the league. In addition to his scoring acumen, Booker is also a gifted playmaker, creating opportunities for his teammates. As an individual testament to his talent, he was named an NBA All-Star in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nBirthplace : Pineville, North Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nPhoenix Suns: 1977–1988\n\nWalter Davis, known as \"The Greyhound\" for his speed and grace on the court, was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in 1977 and made an immediate impact with his scoring ability. A six-time NBA All-Star and the Suns' all-time leading scorer, Davis helped carry the team to numerous playoff appearances during his tenure. His smooth jumper and knack for getting to the rim made him a nightmare for opposing defenses. Davis' stellar performance earned him the 1978 NBA Rookie of the Year award, solidifying his status as a Suns legend.\n\nBirthplace : Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Phoenix Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets, Miami Heat, Utah Jazz\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nPhoenix Suns: 2001–2005\n\nDrafted in 2001, Joe Johnson quickly blossomed into a versatile scoring threat for the Phoenix Suns. With his size, shooting touch, and ability to create his own shot, Johnson helped revitalize the Suns' offense during his time with the team. A key player during the Suns' resurgence in the mid-2000s, Johnson was a vital component alongside Amar'e Stoudemire, Steve Nash, and Shawn Marion. While Johnson would eventually leave the Suns, his time with the team was marked by exciting play and impressive individual prowess.\n\nBirthplace : Torrance, California\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Guard\n\nPhoenix Suns: 1975–1980, 1983–1984\n\nDrafted by the Boston Celtics in 1972, Paul Westphal joined the Phoenix Suns via trade in 1975 and instantly became one of the key contributors to the team. An electrifying scorer and exceptional playmaker, Westphal led the Suns to their first NBA Finals appearance in 1976 in a thrilling series against his former team. A five-time NBA All-Star and four-time All-NBA selection, Westphal's number 44 jersey was rightly retired by the Suns, immortalizing his contributions to the franchise.\n\nBirthplace : Traverse City, Michigan\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, Phoenix Suns\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nPhoenix Suns: 1988–1995, 2001–2002\n\nDan Majerle was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the 1988 NBA Draft and became an integral part of the team's success throughout the 1990s. Known for his tenacious defense and exceptional three-point shooting, Majerle earned the nickname \"Thunder Dan\" due to his thunderous dunks. A three-time NBA All-Star and a two-time All-Defensive Second Team honoree, Majerle was a crucial component on the Suns' 1993 Finals team that battled against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nBirthplace : Elmhurst, Illinois\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Phoenix Suns\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nPhoenix Suns: 1986–1992\n\nAcquired in a trade in 1986, Jeff Hornacek quickly emerged as one of the most reliable shooting guards in Phoenix Suns history. Boasting a fundamentally sound game and unparalleled court vision, Hornacek thrived as both a scorer and a playmaker. His unselfish play and high basketball IQ made him a fan favorite during his tenure with the Suns. While not laden with individual accolades, Hornacek's impact on the Suns was invaluable, making him a beloved figure in franchise history."
