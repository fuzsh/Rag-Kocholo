        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Jason Richardson has spent plenty of time in the NBA. He is in his 12th season and now on his fifth team.\n\nJust a handful of games into his Sixer career, he finds himself right at home already.\n\n“Everything is beyond my expectations as far as the organization, the city and the team,” Richardson said. “Everything has been great here, I’m loving it so far. Enjoying the city, definitely enjoying my teammates. Looking for a long and enjoyable season.”\n\nAnd so far, the feeling has been mutual.\n\nPhiladelphia loves it sports teams, and it didn’t take long for the new shooting guard to find that out.\n\n“The level (of love) is high,” Richardson said. “You go places where you think you can be in disguise and people know who you are. They let you know how passionate they are about sports in general here.\n\n“Not just basketball, but baseball, football, hockey, all the sports. But that’s a good sign when you have fans and a city so excited about the team, it makes you want to go out there and play hard and win games.”\n\nAfter making his Philly debut in the home opener against the Nuggets, Richardson sprained his ankle in the opening minutes against the New York Knicks, causing him to miss the back end of the home-and-home as well as the recent three-game road trip.\n\n\"It was tough,\" Richardson said of missing those games. \"I'm the type of player that hates sitting down, feel like I'm not helping my teammates. But we have the type of team that if someone goes down, somebody else can pick up the slack. I think Dorrell (Wright) came in and did a great job with the starting role, we didn't miss a beat.\n\n\"They won three games on the road, I'm just really proud of the team the way they adjusted.\"\n\nRichardson returned to the lineup last Monday against the Milwaukee Bucks, and it looked liked he hadn't missed any time.\n\nHe dropped 20 on the Bucks in a 105-96 loss, shooting 8-of-16 from the floor and 3-of-8 from downtown.\n\nThat hot shooting carried over to the first quarter against the Detroit Pistons Wednesday, as he hit three early 3's. Unfortunately, they were the only shots he made all game, finishing the night 3-for-12 from the floor.\n\n“We’re not worried about (bad shooting nights),” Richardson said. “We have plenty of guys that can shoot the ball and score the ball, it just happens like that. Sometimes you hit a streak where you can’t hit a shot.”\n\nDespite the horrible finish against the Pistons, Richardson came out on fire Friday against Utah.\n\nThe veteran guard had another 20 point game, going 5-for-7 from behind the arc and 7-of-12 overall as the Sixers got back to their winning ways defeating the Jazz, 99-93.\n\nRichardson is learning how to play with his new teammates and how to navigate the city. But the one thing he hasn’t figured out yet; where to get a good cheese steak.\n\n“Not yet, I don’t eat beef,” he said with a smile. “So I have to find a chicken cheese steak spot.”"
