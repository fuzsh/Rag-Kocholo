        "text": "East Lansing, Mich. â€“ Michigan State basketball extended an offer in the 2024 recruiting class to a player who sounds extremely familiar to Spartan Nation.\n\nTom Izzo and his staff offered a scholarship to Jason Richardson Jr., an unranked point guard from Bishop Gorman High and the son of former MSU star Jason Richardson.\n\n\"Thanks to Coach Izzo and the MSU coaching staff for believing in the player I'm working to become,\" he wrote via Twitter.\n\nAt 6-foot-2, Richardson will attract attention from Spartan fans due to his last name but holds multiple offers from Arizona State, Washington, UNLV, and Western Illinois.\n\nHis father was a member of the 2000 national championship team that defeated Florida, 89-76. He was a reserve playing critical minutes while leading the team in scoring (14.7 ppg) as a sophomore. During the 2000-01 season, he was one of 15 finalists for the Naismith Award and the USBWA Player of the Year Award and one of 20 finalists for the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nPlease make sure you tell us your thoughts when you like our Facebook Page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE.\n\nDo you want the latest and breaking Michigan State news delivered straight to your email for FREE?
