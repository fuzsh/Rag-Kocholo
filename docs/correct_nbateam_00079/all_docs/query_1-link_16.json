        "text": "Jason Richardson announced his retirement from the NBA in an Instagram post on Wednesday night, less than a week before he was set to start training camp with the Atlanta Hawks:\n\nThe 34-year-old finishes his 13-year career after playing in just 52 games over the past three years due to injury.\n\nRichardson told Yahoo Sports that he had knee pain four to five days ago and an MRI revealed bone spurs. He wanted to retire on his own terms, and didn't want the injury to become debilitating.\n\nRichardson agonized over the decision for six hours before telling Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer that he planned to lace 'em up for good.\n\n\"Coach Bud was really cool,\" Richardson said. \"He respected my decision and we wished each other well.\"\n\nRichardson played in 857 career regular-season games (842 starts) with the Golden State Warriors, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic, Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nHe averaged 17.1 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.2 steals in 34.1 minutes. Though he never enjoyed much postseason success outside of the 2007 \"We Believe\" Warriors and the 2010 Suns, Richardson averaged 17.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals in 34.1 minutes.\n\nRichardson, who was drafted by the Warriors with the No. 5 overall selection in 2001 out of Michigan State, is best known for winning back-to-back dunk contests in 2002 and 2003.\n\n\"The dunk contests are what people know me for,\" Richardson said. \"I played on teams with Golden State that I was scoring 17 to 18 points a game on, but we weren't winning. So I will always be known for the dunk.\"\n\nThe Hawks start training camp on Monday."
