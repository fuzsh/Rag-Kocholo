Former Golden State Warriors and Phoenix Suns shooting guard Jason Richardsonannounced his retirement from the NBA on Wednesday.

“Today is a bitter sweet moment for me. I'm officially announcing my retirement from pro basketball,” Richardson wrote on Instagram. “I like to thank the organizations and fans in Charlotte, Phoenix, Orlando, Philly and especially The Bay Area for their loyal support the past 14 years. Walking away was the hardest decision I had to make but choosing my health and spending time with my family is more important to me! God bless!”

Richardson spent 14 years in the NBA, most notably with the Warriors, where he blossomed into a 20-point scorer and Dunk Contest champion. Richardson spent six seasons with Golden State, then joined the Phoenix Suns after two years in Charlotte.

In just over two seasons with the Suns, Richardson morphed into a key role player on the teams led by Steve Nash. Richardson then made stops in Orlando and Philadelphia, where he ended his career after coming back from knee surgery. Richardson signed a non-guaranteed contract with the Atlanta Hawks in August, but appears ready to move on from the NBA.
