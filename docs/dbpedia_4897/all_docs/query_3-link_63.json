        "text": "Project Analyst, Revenue Cycle Strategy\n\nOverview of Journey at UCSF:\n\nMy journey at UCSF actually started in 2013 when I was hired as a Medical Assistant in the Arthritis and Rheumatology Clinic in the ACC building at Parnassus. I then left UCSF and pivoted my career into the business side of healthcare – during which I spent several years as a healthcare consultant – before returning to UCSF in February 2019. Upon rejoining UCSF, I was hired as a Project Analyst to ensure Revenue Cycle readiness for the UCSF Health strategic expansion and integration projects that have only increased in number/scope since that time. I love my role because it allows me to connect with so many different stakeholders across the organization and every project UCSF takes on is different, which means I’m always learning new things!\n\nWhat’s on your reading list?\n\nI just finished reading “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens, which was incredible. It’s actually being made into a movie that is coming out in a couple months, so I’m excited to see how the story is portrayed. I’m now reading Ho’oponopono by Ulrich E. Dupree. Ho’oponopono is a Hawaiian ritual of forgiveness through which people can gain a better understanding of how we are all connected and foster peace in our lives by letting go of the past through forgiveness of ourselves and others using the four tenets of: I am sorry, Please forgive me, I love you, and Thank you.\n\nWhat’s your ideal weather?\n\nI grew up in the Pacific Northwest, so I’m a big fan of rainy days and thunderstorms! But, if it’s not raining, I’d say a “balmy” 70°F sunny day is perfect.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself early on in your career? To a woman entering your field today?\n\nI’d give my former self or any woman entering my field today the advice of: Give yourself the time and space to explore a variety of career options, even within one field. When I entered Healthcare shortly after graduating college, I only really saw career options through a direct patient care lens, but I have been blown away at the breadth of career options within Healthcare. Additionally, I’d advise spending much of your early career asking a lot of questions and taking on projects and roles that might feel a little challenging or scary. These opportunities can teach us much more than staying within our comfort zones. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes or be told “no.” Both of those things will happen eventually, and a lot of growth comes from those moments.\n\nWhat do you like to do outside of work?\n\nI’ve joined a gym near my house that focuses on weightlifting, and it has been really fun learning the proper techniques and seeing tangible increases in my strength. I also love playing board games, bargain hunting, handmaking crafts with my Cricut, and hanging out with my husband Matt and our two cats Betty Lou and Pickles."
