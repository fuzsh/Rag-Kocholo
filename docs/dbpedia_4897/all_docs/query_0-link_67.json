Beginning in spring 1998, it is being maintained and updated by Darcy Partridge. Andy J. Williams (now Andy Affleck) was the original creator and obtained some of the early input from the show creators and writers. Extra material and suggestions come from members of the Friends mailing list and newsgroup.\n\nMany additional comments are included from Friends' Season 1 Supervising Producer Jeff Greenstein and Friends' Senior Script Editor Alexa Junge.\n\nPlease see question 0.03 for further information about our informants.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n0.03 All about our contacts at Friends\n\nWe currently have NO contact at Warner Bros. or NBC.\n\nDuring the first season of the show, then-Supervising Producer Jeff Greenstein contacted the original author of this FAQ and began a two-way dialogue about the show. Over time, an arrangement evolved in which the author would collect questions from the readers of the mailing list and newsgroup, send them on to Jeff who would in turn answer them and mail back his responses, which are quoted in this FAQ. At the end of the first season, Jeff left Friends to work on his new sitcom \"Partners\" for FOX (which aired for the 1995-96 season) and Senior Script Editor Alexa Junge took over as our contact at the show under the same arrangement. (Note: I briefly corresponded with Jeff more recently... he was one of the writers of Desperate Housewives at the time.)\n\nLater, Alexa turned over the role of contact to Mark Kunerth, one of the writers, but also instructed us that we would no longer enjoy the privilege of submitting questions. We occasionally received information in advance about upcoming show titles, air-date, and credits, but this was a one-way flow of data.\n\nMark has been involved in Friends and other shows (I believe he wrote for Veronica's Closet), and due to his busy schedule, he passed the torch on to another. However, communication with our new contact was sporadic. Eventually, it was rare to hear from him, so we gave up trying to maintain an official contact.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n0.04 I have a question about X...\n\nIf you have a question about the show that is not answered in this FAQ or in the accompanying Episode Guide:\n\nKeep in mind that since we can no longer submit questions to the production team, we may not be able to give you an answer.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.0 Filming, Writing, and other Production Issues\n\n1.00 Where can I get copies of episodes on Video or DVD?\n\nUSA \\ Canada\n\nFind out about season-by-season video releases and other Friends video collections through this link:\n\nhttps://www.friends-tv.org/videos.html\n\nU.K./Europe\n\nIf you are in the UK or Europe and want Friends on DVD or VHS, follow this link!\n\nElsewhere\n\nWell, Friends can be purchased all over the world, so I'll leave the searching up to you!\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.01 When can I see Friends? Can I stream it?\n\nFriends originally aired Thursdays at 8:00 PM Eastern/Pacific, 7:00 PM Mountain/Central on NBC. Now, it can be seen in various times and places through syndicated reruns, and various streaming services like Amazon On Demand.\n\nIn 2020 it has found another streaming home, on HBO MAX!\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.02 All about attending tapings\n\nHow sad, there are no more tapings! Normally, tickets for all television shows are free. The only catch is that tickets for popular show are usually \"sold out\" many months in advance. In fact, Warner Bros did not make tickets for the 9th or 10th season available to the general public.\n\nThe company that handled tickets for Friends is \"Audiences Unlimited.\" They have a helpful Web Site at http://tvtickets.com. They also handled tickets for the short-lived spin-off, \"Joey.\" They still handle tickets for many other shows.\n\nYou can also call Audiences Unlimited (818) 506-0067.\n\nAudiences Unlimited.\n\n100 Universal City Plaza, Bldg. 153\n\nUniversal City, CA 91608\n\n(818) 506-0067\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.03 All about the episode titles (What's 'TOW' mean?)\n\nThe episode guide lists all the titles, gives plot synopses, quotes, and credits.\n\nAll \"Friends\" episodes all begin with \"The One with...\", \"The One Where...\", \"The One At...\" (\"TOW\" or \"TOA\"). As to why, Jeff Greenstein had this to say:\n\nJeff Greenstein: \"When Marta & David & Jeff & I did 'Dream On', we used to spend a lot of time thinking about titles, because they were on-screen at the top of each episode. On \"Friends\", we decided that was a waste of time. We figured, why not name each episode after the thing that people will ostensibly be talking about around the water-cooler the next day?\"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.04 How far in advance are storylines planned?\n\nJeff Greenstein: \"We knew there was going to be a Phoebe/Ursula story [See 3.03] from the get-go. In the case of Paolo, we started that \"arc\" without knowing exactly where or when it would end up -- the decision to have him make a pass at Phoebe [1.12] was actually arrived at pretty late in the game. However, an upcoming two-part arc involving Rachel, Barry [Rachel's ex-fiancÃ© and Mindy [Rachel's Bridesmaid & Barry's girlfriend] was conceived of all at once.\n\n\"To answer your initial question, then... it varies. \"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.05 All about submitting/acquiring scripts\n\nOn submitting scripts:\n\nJeff Greenstein: \"We only accept script submissions through agents. Sorry. That's the standard deal.\"\n\nOn acquiring scripts:\n\nAlexa Junge: \"If you are interested in plot synopses and the like, the best thing would be getting the 'Friends Companion' or to read the Episode Guide. If you are looking for script format because you're interested in writing for TV, there are loads of books that can fill you in. You might also try contacting the Writers' Guild (though I don't know if they'll be much help if you're not a member) or the Museum of Broadcasting in New York.\"\n\nYou can sometimes find unofficial transcriptions of scripts on the Internet, but WB Studios is tracking down most of those sites and closing them down.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.06 How is the stage set up?\n\nFirst, here's the answer from producer / writer Jeff Greenstein regarding season 1:\n\nJeff Greenstein: \"There are two standing sets -- Monica and Rachel's apartment, which occupies the center of our stage, and the coffee house, which is stage right. Those stay up all the time, 'cause they're in every show.\n\n\"Stage left is a space where we put our larger 'swing sets' (sets that are only needed for one episode). In any given week, that could be Chandler and Joey's apartment, Carol and Susan's apartment, or the fancy restaurant in 'Candy Hearts' [1.14].\n\n\"Those three sets face the audience. There's additional space for sets off to the side and behind -- if we have to build sets there, we feed the scene live to the audience on overhead monitors.\"\n\nSecond, here's a rough drawing (not totally accurate or to scale) and description based on a visit to the set during season 9. Specifically, it was on October 11, 2002, for the taping of episode 907, The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song.\n\nMonica's apartment and Central Perk are still as described above by Jeff Greenstein, with the apartment being central in front of the audience, and Central Perk being stage right. Joey and Chandler's apartment is still stage left, with the hallway separating the apartments. I believe Joey's apartment is mostly left up all the time now, rather than being a \"swing set\" because that set was still up during the recent filming of an episode, even though the set wasn't used at all for that episode. But I suppose it still depends on how much space might be needed for temporary sets.\n\nThe space wrapping around to the sides of the audience is used as well. At the October 11 visit, the side on the audience's right was occupied by Ross's apartment, and by the living room of Richard's apartment. I think they had to move some of Ross's apartment, between scenes, to have Richard's living room fully set up. The space on the audience's left was used for Mike's (Phoebe's boyfriend) parent's apartment. I believe that space is often used for Phoebe's apartment, because I saw a set-dresser touching up the paint on the floor with a can labelled, \"Phoebe's Apt.\" Mike's parents set was quite large, with several rooms, hallways, etc. In fact, it was so large that I'm sure it slightly encroached on the space normally used for Joey and Chandler's apartment, although we could still see most of their apartment back there. Incidentally, between almost every scene, several crew members would hang out at Joey's and play foosball. I have a feeling the crew leaves Joey's apartment in place as much as possible, at least for this reason.\n\nIncidentally, Monica's \"secret closet\" is usually a door to the backstage area. The shelves of junk that were in it for episode [8.14] (The One With The Secret Closet) was just a one-time arrangement.\n\nOther interesting set facts:\n\nThe purpose of the big poster behind Monica's TV is to hide a large rectangular hole, through which the crew sometimes films. Similarly, there is a rectangular section of wall next to Monica's front door which detaches to leave a \"window\" for cameras to shoot through. When not filming from that angle, that section is put back and a poster is mounted over it to hide the seams.\n\nThe street outside of Central perk is indeed part of the set (not filmed outdoors). The street, apartments across the street, cars, and live pedestrians were visible during shooting.\n\nMonica's guest bedroom (formerly Rachel's room) is usually not set up. A fake entry to it is there, and at times a camera films action in the living room from \"inside\" that entry way. Monica's room is not normally set up, either. Most likely, when those rooms are needed, they are actually set up elsewhere. Otherwise, part of Central Perk would have to be taken down to make room.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.07 All about the theme song\n\nThe theme song is called \"I'll Be There For You.\" For information about the Soundtrack Albums, see my Music Page.\n\nThere was a great deal of debate on the internet over whether the first line was \"So no one told you life was gonna be this way\" or \"So no one told you that was gonna be this way.\" Alexa Junge put the argument to rest with the following:\n\nAlexa Junge: \"the lyric question is 'No one told you LIFE was going to be this way...' But it's not a dumb [question] - there was momentary debate even between Marta [Kauffman] and David [Crane] who didn't want to believe they wrote two consecutive lines with the word 'Life' in them. But they did.\"\n\nAlso: There are only four claps; and D.O.A. stands for \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nThe Theme song is sung by the Rembrandts. An extended version can be found on their 1995 album, \"L.P.\" The music is by Michael Skloff and the lyrics by Allee Willis\n\nSo no one told you life was gonna be this way [four claps]\n\nYour job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.\n\nIt's like you're always stuck in second gear\n\nWhen it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year\n\nBut...\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(When the rain starts to pour)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(Like I've been there before)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n('Cause you're there for me too)\n\nThen, the extended version continues with:\n\nYou're still in bed at ten and work began at eight\n\nYou've burned your breakfast; so far, things are going great\n\nYour mother warned you there'd be days like these\n\nBut she didn't tell you, when the world has brought you down to your knees,\n\nthat...\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(When the rain starts to pour)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(Like I've been there before)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n('Cause you're there for me too)\n\nBRIDGE:\n\nNo one could ever know me, no one could ever see me\n\nSeems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me\n\nSomeone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with\n\nSomeone I'll always laugh with\n\nEven at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!\n\nIt's like you're always stuck in second gear\n\nWhen it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year!\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(When the rain starts to pour)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n(Like I've been there before)\n\nI'll be there for you\n\n('Cause you're there for me too)\n\nCarl Sobeski figured out the following guitar chords:\n\nFret Fret Fret A G C#m +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ 1 | | | 1 1 5th 1 | | | 1 1 3rd | 1 | | | 1 4th +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | | | 2 | | | | | 2 | | | | | | 2 | +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | 3 4 | | | | 3 4 | | | | | 3 4 | | Bm D E +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | 1 | | | 1 2nd | 1 | | | | 5th | | | 1 | | 1st +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | | | | 2 | | | | | | | | 2 3 | | | +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ | | 3 4 | | | | 3 3 3 | | | | | | | A G So no one told you life was gonna be this way A C#m Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.

Jennifer Aniston was not topless in front of the studio audience. The scene was pre-shot on a closed set (just the cameraman and director) and a cut-together version of the scene was shown to the audience on show night. (That's where the laughs came from.)\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.09 What was the life-cycle of the typical show?\n\nJeff Greenstein:\n\nBrainstorming. Just the writers sitting around, throwing out ideas, seeing what strikes a chord. This takes four or five days, during which time we'll generate a dozen or so things that feel like stories. Story-breaking. We take each story and break it down into individual scenes. This generally takes a day or two per story, depending on its scale. Mix-'n'-match. This is often the toughest phase of the process -- picking from the bunch of stories we have, and seeing what goes with what. (The basic rule is three stories per episode.) We also have to make sure each of the six characters is serviced in each show, and that the stories jibe in terms of time sequence. This phase may also include some additional brainstorming and story-breaking as we try to fill in the gaps in each episode. For a typical episode, this would take another coupla days. Outline. We divvy up the episodes and each writer goes off and does an outline. The producers give them notes on the outline, and then they're off to... Write a first draft. Generally the writer has about a week to do this. The producers give them notes, and then they... Write a second draft, which we then begin... \"Tabling\". This is all the writers in a room, going through the script line by line, scene by scene, making it better. Punching up jokes, making sure the story is telling itself properly, etc. This takes about four (often very long) days, at the end of which we have a finished script we're all pretty happy with.\n\nThen a whole new phase begins: Production.\n\n\"Table read.\" This happens on a Wednesday around noon. The actors sit around a table with us and read through the script. This hopefully gives us some idea what's working and what's not. It's also a chance for the network, the studio and the director to give us whatever thoughts they have. Based on this, the writing staff spends the rest of the day and night doing a group rewrite. Thursday run-through. After the actors have spent much of the morning and early afternoon working with the material, they run through the whole show for the writers and producers. This is our first chance to see the show \"on its feet\". Early notes are given to the actors on performances, we see if the changes we made Wednesday night are working, and then we spend Thursday evening rewriting the script *again* Friday (network and studio) run-though. Again, we get a feel for what's working and what isn't. The network and studio contribute their thoughts. The director and cast may offer additional ideas. The dreaded Friday night rewrite ensues. Monday camera blocking. The director runs through the show with the cast, figuring out what his or her shots are going to be, finalizing the actors' blocking, etc. There may be some marginal changes at this point if a particular joke just isn't getting there, but at this point the script is pretty much locked. Tuesday night -- we shoot the damn thing! [Note: As of October 1996, taping has been moved to Friday nights. We will try to get a revised schedule of this process to replace this one -ajw, 10/10/96] Post-production. Cutting, recutting and mixing the show can take anywhere from a week to three weeks, depending on how close to the air date we are. It's on TV! You see it and post messages to the mailing list.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.10 Was Marcel dancing or was that a tape loop?\n\nOne scene in \"The One with all the Poker\" [1.18] shows Marcel dancing to \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\".\n\nJeff Greenstein: \"It's a tape loop. Monkey's a very talented monkey, but she ain't no dancer.\"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.11 Flubs, gaffes, and improvisations\n\nOne reader asked if the pillow falling from the balcony in TOW George Stephanopoulis [1.04] was scripted or a just wonderful flub by JA.\n\nAlexa Junge: \"The pillow falling thing evolved on the stage. It may have come from the director, James Burrows or the actors or as a result of all their comic heads working together. I don't know for sure. All I know is we came by to see a run-through and were surprised by the wonderful bit and it stuck.\n\n\"Actual flubs are rare, but every so often something unexpected will happen at a taping that's too precious to pass up. In a recent episode (TOW 5 Steaks & an Eggplant) [2.05] Matt was supposed to go to the phone and say 'Bob, here' but he fell so fantastically, that's the take that ended up on the air.\"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.12 How did the cast/crew feel about the move to 8PM Pacific/Eastern?\n\nAlexa Junge: \"Last year, the show benefited enormously from following both 'Mad About You' and 'Seinfeld' [at 9:30PM Pac/East on Thursdays]. Once 'Friends' was a hit, the move [to 8PM Pac/East on Thursdays] was a terrific compliment since now we could actually help 'anchor' the night's prime-time lineup. As for the ratings, they've been fantastic.

Studio Facilities, 4000 Warner Blvd, Burbank, California, 91522. That exterior set is known as Park Blvd.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.16 Who is in the black and white poster in Chandler and Joey's apartment?\n\nThe black and white poster (with 2 men, one with a white cloth tied around his head) is of comedians Laurel and Hardy. The shot is apparently from the 1928 film, \"Leave 'em Laughing,\" in which Hardy's teeth are mistakenly removed. (Thanks to John H. for identifying the movie).\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.17 Where did the furniture from Central Perk and Monica's apartment come from?\n\nI don't have much of this type of information. When the show was still in production, I would have suggested you write to someone like the Set Decorator, care of the Friends office at Warner Bros. Studio. However, that's not a valid approach anymore. Sorry!\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.18 Where can I get other information about character's clothes, set pieces, decorations, paint colors, etc.?\n\nI don't have much of this type of information. When the show was still in production, I would have suggested you write to people like the Costume Designer, Set Decorator, Prop Master, etc., care of the Friends office at Warner Bros. Studio. However, that's not a valid approach anymore. Sorry!\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.19 What happened to the wooden-beam support framework that was between the kitchen and living room of Monica's apartment?\n\nOriginally, there was a support framework in Monica's apartment, built from dark wooden beams, that came up vertically next to the refrigerator, then horizontally across the \"ceiling\" toward the audience, then vertically back down to the floor. James Burrows, the director of the pilot and a number of other episodes, said in an interview he originally had it in for visual reasons - to make it more interesting and give the eye something to see in the foreground. Where did it go?\n\nWell, it's not completely gone. The vertical section next to the refrigerator is still there, as is about 2 feet of the horizontal section. But the rest of the horizontal section was removed, as was the vertical post nearer the audience.\n\nThe framework was interfering with production. It cast odd shadows, it interfered with the boom mike, and it was often blocking certain camera shots and angles.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.20 Where can I get a penguin doll like Joey's Hugsy?\n\nThe Hugsy used originally in episode 5.14 is a bit different from the Hugsys used later in episodes 8.07, and 9.17. Both are Mummford the Penguin, created by Debbie Mumm. In 5.14 it had a hat and scarf, and was relatively standard looking. I think this was the original Mummford. I've seen this kind on eBay occasionally. The ones used later had a gold vest, a different hat, goggles, and no scarf. This type was sold at Mervyns in 1999... maybe other times and places as well.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.21 Who draws the pictures on the Magna Doodle by Joey's door?\n\nHere's comments on this by Todd Stevens, Friends Supervising Producer, and Greg Grande, Set Decorator:\n\nTodd: Over time various cast members and crew have contributed to the drawings on JOEY's apartment door. Two of our crew artists are Greg Bruza who is a set dresser and another is Paul Swain in our electrical dept. Sometimes the drawings do represent some inside information that even I am not aware of. The actual piece of set dressing is a \"TYCO MAGNA-DOODLE\".\n\nGreg Grande: Yes, the Magna Doodle, most weeks, is done by our resident electrician Paul Swain. He seems to be the cartoonist on the crew. However, over the past several years we have had participation from other crew members, and yes, even the cast a few times early on. Early on Greg Bruza and myself as well as others had contributed to the doodle board. Lately it's been Paul Swain.\"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.22 How many Emmy awards did the show or it's cast win?\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, Michael Lembeck, 1996\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Lisa Kudrow, 1998\n\nOutstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, Bruce Willis, 2000\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series, 2002\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Jennifer Aniston, 2002\n\nOutstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, Christina Applegate, 2003\n\nThese and other awards and nominations for the show are documented at this wikipedia article.\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n1.23 Will there ever be a Friends reunion show or Friends movie?\n\nIt depends on what kind of \"reunion show\" you might be thinking of.\n\nThe cast (and creators) are indeed getting back together to discuss and celebrate the show, in connection with the show's new streaming home on HBO Max. This \"Special\" will be streamable on HBO Max, in addition to the original 10 seasons.\n\nAs far as an new chapter in the lives of our favorite characters: Recently, comments made by creator Marta Kauffman and some cast members seem to indicate that their interest or willingness to reprising these roles has passed.\n\nAs far as I can tell, a Friends *movie* has not really been a serious consideration. Any statements online about a Friends movie in development have always been false rumors. Jennifer Aniston was quoted by The Hollywood Reporter as saying, \"Friends is in your living room; Friends is not in a movie theater. It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n2.0 Character/Actor Information\n\n2.01 All About the Main Characters\n\nDavid Schwimmer as Ross Geller Courteney Cox as Monica Geller Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Karen Green Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay\n\nThe main characters are detailed here. Facts about them are followed by a Episode Guide link into the episode from which the information was gleaned.\n\nRoss Geller (David Schwimmer): Ross is Monica's brother. He has a Ph.D. in paleontology. Originally in the series, he worked for a museum [1.02]. He lost that job in season 5, due to his \"rage problem.\" Later he became a guest lecturer at NYU (episode [6.04]). This led to a full-time teaching position there.\n\nRoss's wife divorced him after she came out as a lesbian [1.01]. Much of season one involved her pregnancy (discovered in episode 1.02). She finally gave birth to Ross' son Ben [1.23] and both she and her partner want Ross to be involved with the child to some degree [1.02] despite the fact that he doesn't really get along with his ex-wife's wife. But that may be changing. He not only gave away the bride at her wedding but he even danced with her new wife. [2.11]\n\nRoss speaks very precisely [1.03] and is somewhat shy. He had a pet monkey named Marcel [1.10] who he had to send to zoo when it hit puberty [1.21].\n\nRoss has been madly in love with Rachel since the ninth grade. At the end of the first season, he gave up on Rachel and began seeing Julie, whom he knew in Grad School and re-met on a trip to China [2.01]. When he found out that Rachel was interested in him, he broke up with Julie but blew it with Rachel when \"the list\" he made to help him decide between Julie and Rachel fell into Rachel's hands. [2.08] But they got over their differences and became a couple [2.14]. However, they broke up because their relationship was stressed by Rachel's busy schedule and Ross's jealousy [3.12][3.15]. The next morning Rachel changed her mind and a reconciliation looked likely, until she found out that Ross has slept with Chloe, the navel-ringed copy store girl [3.16]. Rachel couldn't forgive Ross but he claimed innocence since they were on a break. Because of their strong feelings, they briefly got back together at the beach [3.25] but it wasn't long before they right back to the same arguement (We were on a break!) [4.01]. In season 4, Ross met Emily Waltham [4.14], a woman visiting from London, and after a very hasty courtship, they decided to get married [4.19]. However, at the wedding in London, Ross accidently spoke Rachel's name instead of Emily's [4.23][4.24]. Although they still went through with the wedding, their relationship quickly disintigrated. Emily decided she can never trust Ross, so they got divorced.\n\nRoss and Rachel's friendship began improving again, and in the final episode of the fifth season, they got drunk in Las Vegas and ended up getting married [5.24]. Early in the sixth season that was corrected with a divorce. Another notable occurance was when Rachel and Ross arranged to be each other's \"backups\" if they weren't married by the time they're 40 [6.25].\n\nIn early season 8, we learned that Ross fathered Rachel's child during a \"one-night stand.\" Both had internal conflicts about where they wanted or thought the relationship should go, but neither one seemed to admit that they still want to be together. At the end of season 8, after the baby is born, Ross was apparently ready to propose to Rachel. However, a strange turn of events led Rachel to agree to marry Joey, even though he didn't really ask (nor did he intend to).\n\nIn season 9 Joey backed out of the picture so Ross could have another chance with Rachel, but that didn't go to well and by the end of season 9, a relationship between Joey and Rachel began.\n\nBy the beginning of the 10th season, Ross was 35, based on his statement about 9 years earlier in the pilot episode, \"I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!\", and his consistent statement in episode [5.09], \"I am 30 years old, and I'm about to be divorced twice.\" In episode [9.02] his birthday is stated as October 18th. That is consistent with episode [2.05], which aired in October 1995, had him celebrating his birthday at the Hootie concert. But I don't blame Joey for thinking Ross' birthday was in Maytember, because I'm not sure anyone really could keep track of it. In episode [1.04], which takes place on October 20, 1994 (Ross's anniversary of his \"first time\" with Carol), Ross stated his birthday was \"7 months ago,\" which would place it in March. And Ross told Gunther his birthday was in December, in episode [4.05]. Maybe Ross just likes getting presents all year round?\n\nMonica E. Geller (Courteney Cox): Monica is Ross' sister. She was a cook at a trendy restaurant, Iridium, on 65th and Broadway [1.01] until she was fired for accepting a kickback, which was against restaurant policy [2.05]. She's had a few different chef positions througout the rest of the series, including head chef at Alessandros, and in season 9, head chef at Javu.\n\nShe rents the apartment where much of the show's action takes place. It is quite an amazing apartment for someone with her career history. Jeff Greenstein suggested that it might be an illegal sublet (see question 2.06), and this was confirmed in \"TOW the Ballroom Dancing\" [4.04].\n\nShe cannot seem to get her mother to approve of her at all [1.02][1.08]. The others consider her to be very bossy, anal-retentive, competitive, and controlling.\n\nMonica has dated a number of men in the show, usually with bad luck. If she likes them, they turn out to be schleps [1.01]. If she doesn't like him, her friends love him [1.03]. And, just once, he turned out to be way too young [1.22]. And sometimes too old. She dated her father's friend Richard Burke (played by Tom Seleck) who is much older than she is [2.15] but they broke up [2.24]. Then she dated Pete Becker, a millionaire in the computer software industry [3.18]. Eventually, things were going very well for them (he even bought her a restaurant [3.21]). However, she broke it off when she discovered he's an obsessively stubborn person who doesn't know when to quit [3.24]. After she left Pete she had a brief catering business with Phoebe [4.06], but then got the position of head chef at Alesandro's restaurant (which she had given a bad review, so all the staff hate her) [4.09]. She briefly dated Richard Burke's son [4.08], but it was too weird. She and Chandler ended up in bed together in London, after spending most of Ross' rehearsal dinner (for his wedding to Emily) consoling each other [4.24]. That these two would get together has been desired by fans and hinted by various sub-plots. I.E. [3.25], [4.01].\n\nMonica and Chandler continued their romance and tried to keep it a secret. But eventually everyone found out [5.14]. While in Las Vegas, they decide to get married. While waiting their turn at the chapel, they discovered Ross and Rachel (who were very drunk) had just been married [5.24]. That derailed everything (they weren't ready anyway) but they decided to move in with each other early in the sixth season. At the end of season 6, Chandler finally proposed again (although it almost didn't happen)[6.24]. They were married at the end of season 7. Their wedding date was May 15th, 2001 even though the marriage episode aired on May 17th. This is known from a statement Monica made in episode [7.17].\n\nMonica will be approximately 34 at the start of season 10. This is based upon her statement that she was 28 during season 3, and that she was \"25 and 13 months\" (26 for those who are slow) in \"TOW The Ick Factor\" [1.22] (near the end of season 1).\n\nChandler Muriel Bing (Matthew Perry): Chandler was a data processor who didn't care for his job. However, in the middle of the first season he recevied a promotion [1.15] to be manager over other data processors. His job was officially, \"Statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.\" In Season 9 he quit that job and is now a Junior Copywriter at an advertising agency. Some of this co-workers in season 1 thought he was gay, as did some women in college [1.08]. So did Mr. Heckles, the former neighbor who lived (and died) downstairs [2.03]. Chandler has a very hard time asking women out [1.06] as well as breaking up with them, I.E. the horrid Janice [1.05]. He seems to get stuck with Janice repeatedly [1.10] [1.14][2.24-3.08][4.15]. Chandler enjoyed a long (by his standards) and promising relationship with Kathy, who was originally Joey's girlfriend but was a much better match for Chandler. Unfortunately, it didn't last [4.05-4.13]. He and Monica ended up in bed together in London, after spending most of Ross' rehearsal dinner (for his wedding to Emily) consoling each other [4.24]. That these two would get together has been desired by fans and hinted by various sub-plots. I.E. [3.25],[4.01].\n\nMonica and Chandler continued their romance and tried to keep it a secret. But eventually everyone found out [5.14]. While in Las Vegas, they decide to get married. While waiting their turn at the chapel, they discovered Ross and Rachel (who were very drunk) had just been married [5.24]. That derailed everything (they weren't ready anyway) but they decided to move in with each other early in the sixth season. At the end of season 6, Chandler finally proposed again (although it almost didn't happen)[6.24][6.24]. They were married at the end of season 7. Their wedding date is May 15th, 2001 even though the marriage episode aired on May 17th. This is known from a statement Monica made in episode [7.17].\n\nChandler's mother writes romance novels and embarasses Chandler greatly [1.11]. He used to smoke and sometimes still has trouble [1.03][3.17][3.18][9.05]. He lived with Joey across the hall from Monica and Rachel, until he moved in with Monica is season 6.\n\nChandler's age, as of early season 10, will be 35. This is based on the fact that in episode [4.07] (6 years earlier) he mentioned he was 29: \"I'm 29. Who needs a savings account?\"\n\nJoey (Joseph) Francis Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc): At first, Joey lived with Chandler across from Rachel and Monica. He still lives there, but his roommate has changed frequently. He is an aspiring actor who continually gets rather pathetic roles. These include Pinocchio in a children's production [1.01] as well as Sigmund Freud in a musical of Freud's life [1.06]. He was also the poster boy for VD [1.09]. His almost-breakthrough role (which he messed up) was as Al Pacino's butt-double in a movie [1.06]. He finally got a break and appeared on Days of our Lives as a doctor [2.10], until the writers killed him off [2.18]. But later in his career he got hired back to play the same character (turns out he wasn't dead, just in a coma). Later, astonishingly, his character received a brain transplant from another character that was being killed off. How can he still be Dr. Drake Ramorey without his original brain?\n\nHe had a part in a movie with Charles Heston [4.14]. Near the end of season 5, he got the lead in a movie called Shutter Speed [5.22]. However, when he got on location in Las Vegas for filming, he found the film had been closed down due to lack of funds. So he got a job a Caesar's Palace. Joey's presence in Vegas is what leads to everyone else coming to Vegas for a weekend, which was were the final episodes of season 5 took place[5.23][5.24]. Joey also had a big part in a War movie (Over There) later in season 7, which was released late in season 8.\n\nJoey is kinda slow intellectually. He is quite active with the females, but never has a lasting relationship. He was also ordained a minister, over the internet.\n\nDuring season 8 Joey developed feelings for Rachel, but held them back because he didn't want to interfere with chances of Rachel and Ross getting together. Once Ross told him to go ahead and tell Rachel, he did... but found out Rachel didn't feel the same way. At the end of season 8, a strange turn of events led Rachel to believe Joey was proposing marriage to her... and she accepted. But that was sorted out and their relationship was back to normal - - that of friends. But late in season 9, Rachel developed feeling for Joey, and by the end of season 9, they got together during the gang's trip to Barbados.\n\nSometime during the 10th season, Joey should turn 36, since he was 28 as of \"The One Where Joey Moves Out\", a 2nd season episode). This is confirmed in episode [6.19] when (during a discussion of Spring Break) it was mentioned that he was 13 in spring of 1981. That makes him 34 in spring of 2002, and on schedule to turn 36 during season 10. However, there are inconsistencies. In episode 7.01 it's mentioned that he's 31 (which would make him 34 at the beginning of season 10). That seemed to be confirmed the next year in episode [8.02], where Chandler reminds Joey that he is 32. But then again, in 7.14 it's established that Joey is older than Chandler (whom we already know is 35). So which episodes do you believe? (Hint: None of this is real, so you don't have to believe any of them if you don't want to.)\n\nRachel Karen Green (Jennifer Aniston): Rachel, until the start of the series, had never held a job and had always lived off daddy's money [1.01]. At the start of the show she had just left Barry, her husband-to-be, at the altar and ran to (and moved in with) the only friend she could think of (at least the only friend who wasn't invited to the wedding): Monica [1.01]. It took her a while to get into the groove of living and working in the big city. She worked as a waitress until mid-third season, when she quit [3.10], then got a job at Bloomingdale's [3.11]. Later she got a job at Ralph Lauren [5.17][5.18] as the Coordinator of the Women's Collection. But late in Season 10, her boss caught her pursuing work at Gucci, and she got fired. She didn't get offered the job at Gucci, either. But then Mark (same guy that got her the job at Bloomingdale's) offerred her a job at Louis Vuitton, in Paris.\n\nRachel has dated many guys (much to Ross' chagrin), including Paolo, an Italian man who could barely speak English [1.07-1.12], and much later, Joshua, a well-to-do young customer at Bloomingdales [4.13-4.20]. For all of the first season, she was oblivious to Ross' crush on her. At the end of the season Chandler let it slip and she decided to go for it. However, by that time Ross had found a new girlfriend (Julie). When she got drunk and told Ross that she was over him, he decided to leave Julie. However, a list [2.08] of pros and cons about Rachel (which Ross was using as part of his decision between her and Julie) upset her and she turned away (but, of course, later forgave him and they got together). However, they broke up because their relationship was stressed by Rachel's busy schedule and Ross's jealousy [3.12][3.15]. The next morning Rachel changed her mind and a reconciliation looked likely, until she found out that Ross had slept with Chloe, the navel-ringed copy store girl [3.16]. Rachel couldn't forgive Ross, but he claimed innocence since they were on a break. Because of their strong feelings, they briefly got back together at the beach [3.25] but it wasn't long before they broke up (still arguing about the alleged \"break\" they were on [4.01]. In season 4, Ross met Emily Waltham [4.14], a woman visiting from London, and after a very hasty courtship, they decided to get married [4.19]. However, at the wedding in London, Ross accidently speaks Rachel's name instead of Emily's [4.23][4.24]. While they still went through with the wedding, this event planted the seed which eventually led to their divorce.\n\nRoss and Rachel's friendship began improving again, and in the final episode of the fifth season, they got drunk in Las Vegas and ended up getting married [5.24]. Early in the sixth season that was corrected with a divorce. Another notable occurance was when Rachel and Ross arranged to be each other's \"backups\" if they weren't married by the time they're 40 [6.25].\n\nAt the end of season 7, we learned Rachel is pregnant. In early season 8, we learned that Ross is the father. Both had internal conflicts about where they wanted or thought the relationship should go, but neither one seemed to admit that they still want to be together. At the end of season 8, after the baby is born, Ross is apparently ready to propose to Rachel. However, a strange turn of events led Rachel to agree to marry Joey, even though he didn't really ask (nor did he intend to). That was sorted out and everything went back to the status quo. But during seasons 8 and 9 there has been signs of a possible relationship between Rachel and Joey, which finally happens during the gang's trip to Barbados at the end of season 9.\n\nRachel's parents have problems of their own as well. Her mother (having married her own \"Barry\") envied Rachel's free life, and for that and several other better reasons has divorced her husband [2.11][2.22].\n\nRachel's age is a bit... um... flexible? She should be about 34 by the end of the 9th season, even though the writers claim she only turned 30 in episode [7.14]. My figure of 34 is based on several things:\n\nWe know her birthday is on May 5th, because Gunther asked her in episode [4.05]. This is further confirmed by the fact that she has had several birthday parties near the end of several seasons [1.24] [2.22] (and seasons usually end around May). Rachel stated that she is 28 in episode [4.16] and therefore would have turned 29 at the end of that same season.\n\nI suppose you could argue that she was rounding up to the nearest full year. But, hey, women don't do that.... especially women like Rachel. Maybe you could say season 4 was a bit out of sequence, and ep 416 was after her birthday (breaking with the precident of seasons 1 and 2). After all, in seasons 7 and 9 she had her birthday parties in mid season, instead of the end of the season. But even if we adjust the calculations down by a year to account for this, there's still an additional year discrepancy. One other inconsistency in her birthday information is that in episode [7.22], the cop looking at her driver's license commentented that she is an Aquarius, but that would put her birthday in January or February. Rachel, if born May 5th, would be a Taurus. Maybe the writers or Jennifer Aniston thought that having Rachel be a bull was not consistent with her character.\n\nIn season 9, Rachel's birthday was celebrated during the January 16, 2003 episode 9.12. This isn't very consistent with May 5th, but it is definately consistent with being an Aquarius.\n\nPhoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow): Phoebe is way out in left field most of the time. Often the cause of strange looks and shrugs from the others, Phoebe left home early in life after her mother committed suicide; she moved to the city where her albino male roommate committed suicide; she got her act together when she discovered aroma-therapy [1.01]. She is a masseuse [1.12] and also sings at Central Perk, often about death. She is very spiritual (not necessarily in a religious sense). She cleanses auras [1.01] and believes she can sometimes read thoughts of people or sense the presence of departed friends or family. She once was inhabited by the spirit of an old lady who died on her massage table [2.11]. She had a friend whom she believes was reincarnated as a pencil [1.08]. She lived with her grandmother [1.04] for much of the show, but her Grandmother died [5.13]. Phoebe still lives in the apartment she shared with her.\n\nHer sister, Ursula Pamela Buffay, is a waitress at Riff's, a restaurant featured in 'Mad About You' [1.02], but they do not get along [1.16-1.17].\n\nMany plots that focus on Phoebe involve her complicated family relationships. In addition to Ursula, we have had episodes that centered around her husband [2.04], her search for her father [2.09], her brother (Frank, Jr.) [3.05], Frank Jr.'s wife and home-ec teacher (Alice) [3.18], her discovery of her birth mother [3.25][4.01], and the surrogate pregnancy she went through for Frank, Jr. and Alice [4.11]-[5.03], and finally meeting her father at her grandmother's memorial service [5.13].\n\nPhoebe hadn't had many long term relationships until season 9, when she met Mike Hanigan. That relationship lasted several months until she decided there wasn't a future in it, because he's been through a painful divorce and never wanted to be married again. But at the end of season 9 he decided he'd be open to the idea, as a reaction to news that David (the Scientist Guy) was going to propose to her. Mike proposed first. Phoebe turned him down, because she doesn't need to marry him right away... she only wanted to know there was a possible future.\n\nPhoebe's age is hard to pin down, but she's probably 35 by the end of season 9. Here's how I come up with that: In TOW They All Turn Thirty, [7.14], there's a flashback (how long back, we don't know) to Phoebe's \"30th birthday,\" where Ursula shows her a birth certificate proving she's really 31 at that time. The previous season (in episode 6.16) Chandler mentioned that Phoebe was 31. This was before she learned she was really a year older than she believed. This means she was really 32 in season 6, and would therefore be 35 in season 9. Phoebe's birthday falls on February 16th, which she tells Frank Jr. in episode [3.05]. However, in episode [9.05] her birthday is celebrated (with a nice dinner out) on Halloween. She admits she couldn't get reservations on the actual night of her birthday, so she got them on Halloween instead. Either the restaurant was booked up for 8 months, or the writers forgot what had been established before.\n\nBy the way, Frank Jr's birthday is October 25th.\n\nAccording to Phoebe, she will die on October 15th, 2032 (revealed in episode [7.03]).\n\nReturn to Questions\n\n2.02 Supporting Cast & Guest Stars\n\nLouisa Abernathy..............Lydia [6.18] Phil Abrams...................The Anxious Wedding Guest [8.02] Jorge Luis Abreu..............The Waiter [10.09] Jay Acovone...................Fireman Charlie [1.14] Scott Adsit...................The Director [7.19] Nikita Ager...................Hayley's Roommate [9.04] Lori Alan.....................Sonya [9.13] Jason Alexander...............Earl [7.13] Sasha Alexander...............The Interviewer [8.19] Kristian Alfonso..............Hope Brady [6.15] Charles Thomas Allen & John Christopher Allen.....Ben [2.20][2.24][3.04][3.08][4.05][4.18] [5.11][5.18] Hope Allen....................Karen Lambert [4.04] Krista Allen..................Mabel [8.12] Hira Ambrosino................The Nurse [10.13] Eva Amurri....................Dina [7.15] Sam Anderson..................Dr. Harad [5.03] Shayne Anderson...............Customer #1 [9.19] Dane Anthony..................The Bandleader [8.01] John Apicella.................Mr. Bowmont [6.24] Christina Applegate...........Amy Green [9.08][10.05] Lee Arenberg..................The Man [5.10] Kristen Ariza.................The Receptionist [9.13] Allisyn Ashley Arm............Leslie Buffay [10.02] Jack Armstrong................Bob [1.05] Alexis Arquette...............the Waiter In Drag [7.22] David Arquette................Malcolm [3.03] Lex Arquette..................The Customer [6.13] Jeffery Asch..................The Writer [7.15] Matthew Ashford...............himself [9.20] Jennifer Aspen................Michelle [9.13] Ethel Ayler...................Hospital Administrator [3.19] Debra Azar....................The Spa Receptionist [9.21] Hank Azaria...................David the Scientist Guy [1.10][7.11][9.06] [9.22][9.23] Edo Azran.....................Young Ross [3.04] Obba Babatunde................The Director [3.12] Iris Bahr.....................Glenda [10.03] Tom Bailey....................Bob [5.10] Bob Balaban...................Frank, Sr. [5.13] Alec Baldwin..................Parker [8.17][8.18] Alex Ball.....................The Ralph Lauren Employee [10.14] John Balma....................Professor Jarvis Oberblau [9.24] Anita Barone..................Carol Willick[1.02] Matt Battaglia................Vince [3.23] Helen Baxendale...............Emily Waltham [4.14]-[4.19][4.21]-[4.24] [5.01][5.04][5.06][5.20] Yasemin Baytok................The Poughkeepsie Woman [4.10] Heidi Beck....................The Delivery Room Nurse [5.03] Joel Beeson...................The Hombre Man (Todd) [2.02] Gina Belafonte................The Second Guest [7.11] Catherine Bell................Robin [2.06] Matt Bellner..................The Crew Member [6.04] Andrea Bendenwald.............Megan Bailey [7.17] Doug Benson...................Tom [5.07] Jim Bentley...................Another Tour Guide aka Ted [4.11] and also..................Professor Friesen [6.19] John Eric Bentley.............Waiter #2 [9.14] Shelley Berman................Mr. Kaplan, Jr. [3.10][3.11] Warren Berlinger..............Bob [2.16] Anne Betancourt...............The Saleslady [4.20] Jack Betts....................Tom [7.15] Shashi Bhatia.................Acting Student #1 [3.07] Andrew Biglore................Wayne [6.21] Tim Bohn......................Jonathan [2.14] Corrine Bohrer................Melanie [1.24] Brooke Boisse.................The Potential Roommate [6.03] Alex Borstein.................Bitter Woman On Stage [9.20] Vincent Boyle.................Another Passenger [10.17] Selma Blair...................Wendy [9.10] Janet S.
