        "text": "The popular medical drama from the 1980s, \"St. Elsewhere,\" is celebrating its 40th anniversary on Wednesday.\n\nBefore \"Grey's Anatomy,\" viewers across America were enamored by the doctors who worked at St. Eligius Hospital in Boston and watched as they faced the day-to-day challenges of being in the medical field.\n\nStarting in 1982, \"St. Elsewhere\" aired for six seasons and helped launch the careers of some of today's biggest stars like Denzel Washington. Fans will also recognize the show's actors from their favorite series like, \"Friends,\" \"Boy Meets World\" and \"Better Call Saul.\"\n\nHere is a look back at what the cast of \"St. Elsewhere\" has been up to since the show ended in 1988.\n\nDENZEL WASHINGTON LEFT KATIE COURIC 'SHAKEN' AFTER 'UNCOMFORTABLE' 2004 INTERVIEW, SHE SAYS\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nWhile appearing on \"St. Elsewhere,\" Denzel Washington began his film career, starring in many successful films, including \"A Soldier's Story,\" \"Power\" and \"Hard Lessons.\" Just one year after the end of the series, Washington won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in 1989 for his role in \"Glory.\"\n\nHe continued to act throughout the '90s, appearing in critically acclaimed films \"Mississippi Masala,\" \"Malcolm X\" and \"Philadelphia\" as well as the romantic comedy \"The Preacher's Wife\" alongside Whitney Houston.

Israel, Esq.\" and in 2022 for his role in \"Macbeth.\" He has a total of 10 Academy Award nominations and two wins.\n\nIn 1983, Washington met his wife, Pauletta Pearson, on set of his first show, \"Wilma,\" and together they have four children, John David, Katia, and twins Olivia and Malcolm.
