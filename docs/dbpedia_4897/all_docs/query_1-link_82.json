        "text": "Born February 17, 1935, British actress Christina Pickles has been gracing fans for decades with her television performances. Pickles originally got the acting bug with the theater, where she spent the 1960s performing on Broadway in plays such as George Devine's \"The Way of the World,\" \"War and Peace,\" \"The Misanthrope,\" \"Hamlet,\" and \"Sherlock Holmes,\" to name a few, (via IBDB).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1970s, she made her television debut in the show \"Guiding Light,\" and soon got roles in \"Another World,\" \"Seizure,\" and \"Rush It.\" Her big break happened when she starred in the hit medical series, \"St. Elsewhere.\" She continued to work in television for the next decade, before being cast as the recurring role of Judy Gellar on the legendary show, \"Friends,\" (via IMDb).\n\nEver since \"Friends,\" Pickles has worked in film and TV alike for decades. At 80 years old, the Emmy winning actress seems to be enjoying her life and career to the fullest. But what has Pickles done with her money?\n\nChristine Pickles has a net worth of around $1 million, according to Net Worth Height. Pickles has a semi-private life, with not much known about how she spends her hefty paychecks. However, she does live in Los Angele in a gorgeous home, per Virtual Globetrotting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Closer Weekly, the star explained how she moved from NYC to Los Angeles based on the advice from her friend. Her and her husband fell in love with the first home they saw in Brentwood. It was a cottage that contained four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a pool, where she still lives to this day.\n\nHowever, the \"Friends\" alum's marriage didn't last the home renovations. \"It was only four tiny rooms, so we opened them up, raised the ceiling, changed the floors...and it's true, that ruined my marriage!\" She laughed. \"But that's all right. I think doing a house tells you who you are.\" No matter, because she's been in a beautiful romance with Australian reporter Ian Masters, (via Closer Weekly).\n\nAdvertisement"
