        "text": "/This article may include spoilers/\n\nIt is no secret that the two shows are very similar. It is widely discussed among the fans but it was also referenced in How I Met Your Mother in the episode “Swarley”.\n\nSo while it seems rather obvious that the show How I Met Your Mother was heavily inspired by the cult favorite Friends, there were some appearances in both shows that may or may not have been included on purpose by the writers, as a sort of an Easter Egg. You may have noticed some of them, but did you spot them all?\n\n1. Maggie Wheeler\n\nOne of the most obvious persons to appear in both shows was Maggie Wheeler. She portrayed the famous character in the show Friends, known for her hilarious lough and a phrase ‘oh my god’ — Janice. She was also seen in How I Met Your Mother (episode — “Dowisetrepla”), as a real estate agent who was presenting an apartment for sale to the group.\n\n2. Sherri Shepherd\n\nIn How I Met Your Mother the actress had portrayed a colorful and hilarious character named Daphne who was a massive part of the last season of the show. She was traveling with Marshall to a wedding, having a journey full of adventure and conflicting emotions.\n\nHowever Sherri Shepherd also had a minor role in the show Friends, episode “The One with Phoebe’s Uterus”. She portrayed Rhonda — a blue-blazered tour guide in the museum where Joey and Ross worked together.\n\n3. Christina Pickles\n\nRoss and Monica’s mother was played by Christina Pickles. She was an emotionally cold woman who had always favored her son over her daughter. On the other hand in How I Met Your Mother she portrayed Lily’s sweet grandma who always had gifts for her granddaughter and her husband (Episodes: The Slutty Pumpkin Returns & Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap).\n\n4. Thomas Lennon\n\nThomas Lennon was known in How I Met Your Mother as Klaus. He was a part of season 8, episodes “The Pre-Nup” & “Farhampton” depicting Victoria’s almost husband. However he was also a part of a hilarious encounter that happened in the episodes “The One in Vegas” part 1 & 2 on Friends, where the group was in Las Vegas. He portrayed Joey’s hand twin, a card dealer in the casino.\n\n5. Cristine Rose\n\nLate in the show, in the season 9 episode “The One with Ross’s Inappropriate Song” on Friends, we meet Mike’s mother — a rich, stuck-up woman from Upper East who wasn’t in support of his son’s relationship with Phoebe. On How I Met Your Mother Cristine Rose also played a role of a mother. For a change, she was a more free spirited mom of the main character — Ted.\n\n6. Phill Lewis\n\nPhill Lewis had a minor role in both shows. In Friends he was introduced as Chandler’s marketing boss. He appeared in three episodes in the 9th season, during which Chandler tried his best at his new, dream job. In How I Met Your Mother the man portrayed a loan officer in the episode “Dowisetrepla” where he uncovered the secret Lily has been hiding from her husband.\n\n7. Jane Carr\n\nJane Carr appeared in How I Met Your Mother in “Nannies” as Mrs. Buckminster. She was the perfect, nurturing nanny that was out of the couple’s price range. In Friends in “The One with Ross’s Wedding: Part 2” Rachel met a ticket agent at an airport who was portrayed by Jane Carr.\n\n8. Anne Dudek\n\nAt the beginning of How I Met Your Mother Anne Dudek is seen in the episode “Return of the Shirt”, playing the role of Ted’s ex-girlfriend — Natalie, with whom he had broken up on her birthday. Twice. In the episode “The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss” in Friends the actress portrays Precious, Mike’s girlfriend, who also gets broken up with on her birthday.\n\nCoincidence? I think not.\n\nThese were all characters that I’ve noticed while watching the two TV shows. Did you notice them all?"
