        "text": "SUNTORY \"THE PREMIUM MALTS\", PILSNER, 5.5% ABV, JAPAN, 12OZ\n\nThe man behind the development of The Premium Malts, had a single dream - to create the world's greatest beer. Taking the pilsner that originated in the Czech Republic and Germany as their model, he and his team began their research. Over 10 years, they worked to craft a beer with the world-class features they were looking for - a superlative, delicate, hoppy aroma, a firm body, and a deep, rich flavor.\n\n$10\n\nOXBOW BREWING CO. \"DUNORD\", FARMHOUSE ALE, 6.5% ABV, ME\n\nMixed-fermentation farmhouse ale brewed with elderflower and blended with Chambourcin grape juice.\n\n$14\n\nWILD EAST BREWING \"ALFRESCO CUCUMBER\", KOLSCH, 5% ABV, NY\n\nOur Alfresco Kolsch-style ale is conditioned on fresh, locally sourced cucumbers. It has just the right amount of balanced cucumber flavor and aroma to create a highly drinkable, totally unique beer.\n\n$10\n\nMAIN BEER CO. \"MO\", PALE ALE - AMERICAN, 6% ABV,ME\n\nTangerine, apricot, and orange with notes of passionfruit, pine, and malt sweetness.\n\n$10\n\nTRILLIUM BREWING CO. \"THE RIVERWAY\", IPA - AMERICAN, 7% ABV, MA\n\nDual-hopped with two favorites from the Pacific Northwest, Citra and Mosaic each display their distinct tropical traits. We taste orange sherbet, meyer lemon, and juicy peach. A gentle sweetness that never nears cloying is embraced by a refined bitterness rounding out each sip.\n\n$13\n\nBELLWOODS BREWERY \"JELLY KING(PRICKLY PEAR & PINK GUAVA)\", SOUR - FRUITED, 5.6% ABV, CA\n\nIt's rare that we release an entirely new Fruit Jelly King flavour but today we debut a duo of tropical delights that have never danced the sour/hoppy tango before. Jelly King Prickly Pear and Pink Guava has arrived. It's a delicious mish mash of strawberry, melon, citrus, and pineapple notes in short, fruit punch. Yum.\n\n$15\n\nHUDSON VALLEY BREWERY \"SYZYGY\", SOUR IPA, 8% ABV, NY\n\nSour DIPA with raw wheat, malted oat, milk sugar, blackberries, hibiscus flowers & vanilla bean; hopped w/ Citra.\n\n$12\n\nIVAN RAMEN x KCBC \"WAI WAI\", HAZY IPA, 6.9% ABV, 16OZ, NYC\n\nKCBC X IVAN RAMEN COLLAB! Made with Citra, Mosaic, Idaho 7, Centennial & Cascade Hops, Barley & Wheat.\n\n$13\n\nSTORMALONG CIDER \"THE BIG APPEAL\", HARD CIDER, 5.5% ABV, 12OZ, MA\n\nA crisp, semi-sweet, hard cider made 100% with freshly-pressed, whole, NY apples. Juicy, with a perfect balance of tart and sweet and fresh apple flavor.\n\n$11\n\nOEC BREWING \"YUZU PILS\", PILSNER WITH YUZU, 5.2% ABV, 12OZ, CT\n\nNuances of freshly baked bread and golden honey course through every sip. Luscious, sweet citrus sings throughout with wild grass and herb harmonies, ending in a clean, snappy finish.\n\n$11\n\nNINE PIN CIDER \"MONTMORENCY CHERRY\", CIDER, 5.7% ABV, 12OZ, NY\n\nMontmorency cherries are tart and tangy, perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of apples in a co-fermented hard cider. The cherries used in this cider are from Bittner-Singer Farms in Appleton, N.Y., just south of Lake Ontario in Niagara County.\n\n$12\n\nTRANSMITTER BREWING \"BNY5\", AMERICAN PALE ALE, 5.5% ABV, 16OZ, NY\n\nThese beers are a tribute to the hardworking and proud men and women who have labored on the Brooklyn waterfront from the early 18th century to the present day.\n\n$14\n\nBRASSERIE CANTILLON \"CLASSIC GUEUZE\", LAMBIC, 5.5% ABV, 375ML, BELGIUM\n\nBeer with a slightly acidic and fruity taste, delicate and woody fragrance and a dry finish that lingers on the palate.\n\n$38\n\nBRASSERIE CANTILLON \"FOU' FOUNE\", LAMBIC - FRUIT, 5% ABV, 750ML, BELGIUM\n\nBlend of lambics aged 18 to 20 months and of Bergeron apricots.\n\n$75\n\nBRASSERIE CANTILLON \"SANG BLEU\", LAMBIC - FRUIT, 6.5% ABV, 750ML, BELGIUM\n\nLambic blend with blue honeysuckle, or haskap, berries. For the past two years, we’ve been making a fruited blend with Camerise berries in small quantities. These berries are slightly sweet with a beautiful acidity.\n\n$75\n\n3 FONTEINEN \"CUVÉE MIEL\" No.67, LAMBIC-GUEUZE, 7.9% ABV, 750ML, BELGIUM\n\nThe Cuvée Miel is a special version of the Cuvée Armand & Gaston. This geuze is a blend of one-, two-, three- and four-year old lambikken that have been infused with honey on the coolship. While blending, we added some more local honey. The weighted average age of this blend upon bottling was more than 24 months. 100% 3 Fonteinen brewed lambik.\n\n$65\n\n3 FONTEINEN \"PERZIK GEEL\" No.14, LAMBIC-FRUIT, 6.7% ABV, 750ML, BELGIUM\n\nAs local harvest has been non-existent for the last three summers, we looked farther to find the juiciest of peaches. Hence, for this Perzik, we macerated freshly hand-picked yellow peaches from an organic producer in the north of Spain.\n\n$99\n\n3 FONTEINEN OUDE GEUZE \"PLATINUM BLEND\" No.42, LAMBIC-GUEUZE, 6.7% ABV, 375ML, BELGIUM\n\nThis Platinum Blend is a blend of jonge lambikken and four-year oude lambikken only, originating from four different brews and two different barrels. One quarter of the blend consists of lambikken brewed with our own sourced heirloom cereals from different spots in Brabant. The weighted average age of the blend is a good 21 months and the oldest lambik was brewed at the beginning of 2017. 100% 3 Fonteinen brewed lambik.\n\n$39\n\nBIRRIFICIO AGRICOLO BALADIN \"XYAUYÙ KIOKE\", BARLEYWINE, 14% ABV, 500ML, ITALY\n\nXyauyù Kioke combines two great craft traditions in the world of fermentation: the art of beer making meets the art of producing craft soy sauce. The Kioke is an open cypress wooden barrel produced by Yasuo Yamamoto (Yamaroku Shoyu) in Japan, on the island of Shodo, and is used for the fermentation of soy sauce. Xyauyù was created in Piozzo, Italy, at the Baladin farm brewery, from Teo Musso’s desire to explore the universe of oxidation. The beer, once fermented and aged for 18 months, is open-air matured inside a new Kioke barrel, i.e. which has never been used for the fermentation of soy. The barrel gives resinous cypress notes and a slightly acidic touch, for a unique aromatic profile.\n\n$200"
