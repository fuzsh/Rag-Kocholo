        "text": "#10: “The All New Mickey Mouse Club” (1989-95)\n\nThis revival of the “Mickey Mouse Club” managed to secure some of the biggest actors and musical acts early! The show had future pop superstars Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and Christina Aguilera. Additionally, major actors like Keri Russell and Ryan Gosling starred alongside them. Other notable music acts like JC Chasez (Timberlake’s future bandmate in NSYNC), R&B star Rhona Bennett, and singer/songwriter Matt Morris were also part of this club of future greats. Disney always has its mouse ears to the ground when it comes to talent, but whoever cast this show deserves special praise!\n\n#9: “Miami Vice” (1984-90)\n\nWhen it comes to ‘80s cop shows, “Miami Vice” was one of the biggest and most bombastic. Although a few of the series’ regulars, like Don Johnson and Edward James Olmos, would go on to greater fame, where the casting really shines is in its guest stars. A-list stars galore appeared on “Miami Vice” early in their careers - Bruce Willis, Liam Neeson, Julia Roberts, Helena Bonham Carter, Benicio Del Toro - we could go on and on! Going back and watching it now, it’s wild to see the huge stars of today play minor parts, often for just one episode.\n\n#8: “Undeclared” (2001-02)\n\nOne of several cult classic (and prematurely canceled) shows made by Judd Apatow (more on that later), “Undeclared” followed the lives of several college students. The main cast members include many future stars, like Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, and “Sons of Anarchy”’s Charlie Hunnam. Even the recurring and guest casts featured some big names. Jason Segel and Amy Poehler appear in several episode stints, and future sitcom stars Jenna Fischer and Simon Helberg show up too. Fox may not have given “Undeclared” a chance, but it’s clear that other networks’ shows recognized the talent on hand.\n\n#7: “Taxi” (1978-83)\n\nNot only was this sitcom critically acclaimed in its day, it also introduced several household name actors to the world. Judd Hirsch, Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, and Christopher Lloyd all had their big breaks on “Taxi” in starring roles. There were plenty of notable guests as well, with future “Cheers” actors Rhea Perlman and Ted Danson appearing, along with early turns from stars like Mandy Patinkin and Tom Hanks. Many of the main cast’s characters may have looked at driving taxis as temporary work, but their actors turned the job into lifelong careers!\n\n#6: “St. Elsewhere” (1982-88)\n\nEvery decade has its gritty medical drama, and for the 1980s, that show was “St. Elsewhere.” Although its primary leads were established actors, the large ensemble featured then-unknowns who would become major stars and recognizable character actors in the near-future. Denzel Washington, Howie Mandel, Mark Harmon, David Morse, Ed Begley Jr., and Christina Pickles all rubbed shoulders with each other as they tackled problems every week. Alfre Woodard and Bruce Greenwood also lent their fictional medical expertise to St. Eligius Hospital. The cast of “St. Elsewhere” was truly something else!\n\n#5: “The Twilight Zone” (1959-64)\n\nWith an anthology series, you never know who’ll be appearing any given week, which can lend itself well to star-studded casts. “The Twilight Zone” is no exception. While many of the actors to appear in this spooky sci-fi series were already famed actors of the day, plenty of them, in a twist we’re sure you see coming, became famous later on. These weren’t limited to actors who made it big in the sci-fi genre, like “Star Trek” stars George Takei, Leonard Nimoy, and William Shatner. “The Twilight Zone” also featured early parts from Carol Burnett, Robert Redford, Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, and countless others. This show broadened our minds and expanded the careers of a cavalcade of talented actors.\n\n#4: “The Wire” (2002-08)\n\nThis masterful portrait of the life and crimes of the residents of Baltimore has remained acclaimed for decades since its debut. Part of this is due to how grounded and real the show feels. Nevertheless, several of its then-unknown stars have become larger-than-life figures in the entertainment industry. A young Michael B. Jordan got his start here. You may recognize Aidan Gillen from “Game of Thrones,” or Dominic West from “The Crown.” And if we listed everything Lance Reddick or Idris Elba have been in since, we’d be here all day! “The Wire” boasts a cast as incredible as everything else about it - and many call it the best TV show ever made for good reason!\n\n#3: “Freaks and Geeks” (1999-2000)\n\nAnother prematurely canceled Judd Apatow sitcom, the cast of “Freaks and Geeks” may have been as awkward and unknown as their characters when it aired. But now? They include some of the biggest names in Hollywood! The leads included Linda Cardellini, Busy Philipps, Jason Segel, and the first of many collaborations between Seth Rogen and James Franco. The show also featured early appearances from actors like Rashida Jones, Shia LaBeouf, and Lizzy Caplan. “Freaks and Geeks” may be a cult classic show, but its cast has definitely achieved mainstream appeal.\n\n#2: “Band of Brothers” (2001)\n\nThis WWII miniseries had serious star power behind the scenes, given that it was created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. But it also featured a laundry list of future superstars! The ensemble cast has plenty of famous TV stars, including Damian Lewis, Michael Cudlitz, and Scott Grimes. The minor and recurring roles are even more impressive, with actors like Simon Pegg, Tom Hardy, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy popping up as minor characters. Even Jimmy Fallon, new to “SNL” at the time, makes a brief appearance. Plenty of recognizable faces from the last 20 years show up here and it only solidifies the series’ reputation as the greatest miniseries ever made.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Deadwood” (2004-06)\n\nIt’s Like a Who’s Who of “Hey! I Know Them!” Actors\n\n“Party Down” (2009-10; 2023)\n\nActors Like Adam Scott & Jane Lynch Before Their Breakout Roles\n\n“The Outer Limits” (1995-2002)\n\nThis Revival of the Sci-Fi Anthology Featured Stars Like Ryan Reynolds\n\n“Home and Away” (1988-)\n\nHeath Ledger & Chris Hemsworth Got Their Starts on This Australian Soap\n\n#1: “Saturday Night Live” (1975-)\n\nChances are, if you name an American comedic actor or comedian, they got their start on “Saturday Night Live” - or will have after this is posted. The long running comedy variety show has featured generations of the funniest and most successful comic actors on the planet! Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Bill Hader, the list goes on and on and on! And that’s not even including the guest hosts and musical acts! You probably can’t go two steps in the entertainment industry without running into multiple people who’ve starred on “SNL!”\n\nIs there a show whose cast was ahead of its time that we got ahead of ourselves by forgetting? Remind us in the comments!"
