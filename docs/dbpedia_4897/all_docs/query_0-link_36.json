        "text": "I have read some wonderful books published by McNally Editions so far such as Han Suyin’s Winter Love, Maxine Clair’s Rattlebone, Ursula Parrott’s Ex-Wife, and Lion Feuchtwanger’s The Oppermanns, and I am now a fan. Based on these successes, I purchased a few more titles from McNally’s list of which Phyllis Paul’s Twice Lost was one, and what an amazing novel it turned out to be.\n\nSet in an idyllic village called Hilbery, Phyllis Paul’s Twice Lost is a wonderfully odd and beautifully written novel of deception and manipulation, twisted realities, and ulterior motives steeped in gothic atmosphere and liberally peppered with hints of mystery and suspense.\n\nOn a summer’s day after a carefree tennis party, eighteen-year-old Christine Gray and her friend Penelope are helping a young girl Vivian Lambert find a piece of jewellery that she seems to have lost. The girls hunt in the overgrown, menacing, and shadowy garden in vain and halt the search altogether as dusk descends upon them.\n\nVivian unsettles Christine greatly; she is a neglected, needy child who on the one hand arouses compassion but whose shifty demeanor also repels Christine; she is uncomfortable around Vivian wanting to get away from her as soon as possible. Promising to help her look for the missing jewellery the next day Christine accompanies Vivian home and is shocked at Vivian’s allegations of ill-treatment by her father and stepmother. Disturbed, Christine bids a hasty farewell to Vivian once they are close to Vivian’s home; after what she has heard Christine is reluctant to speak to Vivian’s parents. That very night though Vivian mysteriously disappears, and this tragedy goes on to haunt Christine in her adulthood.\n\nWe are then introduced to two characters central to the story – the Antequins, Thomas and his illegitimate son Keith; newly established residents at Carlotta House, the same house with the garden where Vivian lost the piece of jewellery and was also possibly last seen. Thomas is a successful author whose gothic fiction is selling well led by the persuasive skills of his son, a leech or parasite of sorts. Keith is an unremarkable man but with a talent for networking that helps catapult his father’s fame and writing career to new heights, no mean feat given how dull and simple Thomas’s personality is.\n\nA reclusive writer, Thomas has no knack for publicity and his late wife was a woman who in all respects possessed qualities befitting a mother thereby only accentuating Thomas’ lackluster reputation. Keith is struck by how the author and the man are as different as chalk and cheese; Thomas might be uninteresting as a person but his writings highlight a man with a singular imagination. Sensing an unmissable opportunity Keith latches on to Thomas offering to be his right-hand man taking charge of all the administrative and publicity aspects of Thomas’ writing career. Having never met his son before, Thomas is surprised and wracked with guilt when Keith unexpectedly lands at his door one day. However, the prospect of making amends as well as the relief of receiving assistance compels Thomas to welcome Keith into his life. But his son is a leech and difficult to shake off, a realisation that belatedly dawns on Thomas.\n\nHalf alarmed, half bewitched, Thomas had fallen easily into the trap. Indeed, it was a temptation, to a man whose practical inefficiency amounted to imbecility, thus to sell his freedom. Not that he had realised what he was about. Though at first greatly upset by this sudden resurgence of his past, the simple man was also touched, moved by fatherly affection, and, perhaps more than anything else, flattered by the impressive young man’s acknowledgment of himself.\n\nKeith ensconces himself into his father’s life in an insidious manner, and a feeling of claustrophobia begins to envelop Thomas. Having his career and life meticulously planned and cleverly controlled by Keith, Thomas is now hell-bent on breaking away from his son who is turning out to be a master manipulator. Fixated on the idea of taking back control of his life, Thomas decides to buy the dilapidated Carlotta House. However, with the Lambert girl’s unfortunate disappearance around the same time and the reputation of the house tarnished with it, Thomas’ plans might be in peril, although he goes ahead anyway but not without being unwittingly mired in the tragedy; a burdensome secret he jots down in a diary whose pages are tantalizingly torn thereafter.\n\nThus, in one fell swoop, the Lambert tragedy ensnares both Christine and the Antequins in its frightening web; a tragedy that will haunt these three characters and weigh heavy on their soul in entirely different ways.\n\nMeanwhile, out of spite towards his son, Thomas marries the eighteen-year-old Christine despite the significant age gap; the marriage is an immediate failure with Christine moving back to London, the separation instigated by Keith who sows seeds of mistrust in Thomas. And yet, Thomas has the last laugh when on his death, his will bestows all his wealth to Christine barring Carlotta House which with malicious glee he leaves to Keith knowing fully well his son’s loathing of the house and its remote location, far away from the literary world and cultured milieu of which he desires to be an integral part.\n\nBut no scheming, planning or expenditure of charm could cause literary society to flow into such a backwater. Keith Antequin was not, in himself, a magnet of sufficient power to draw such congenial company about him. Stranded here, he was cut off from his proper milieu, from the West End bars and clubs where the artistic, journalistic and stage worlds met, where his own kind congregated, where the useful, entertaining and necessary intelligence circulated; cut off from the pleasant, informal little lunches where the real business was done, where things were managed, the vital contacts made. Among the weeping trees, in the grey, dripping weather, when no one came to the house for days on end, he was a prey to his nerves and the melancholy which so easily afflicted him.\n\nAs the novel progresses, about halfway the story takes a sinister turn when after many years a woman makes an appearance calling herself Vivian Lambert. Is she for real, alive and not dead? Is she an impostor? Or is she a figment of the imagination? This dilemma will go on to form the crux of the story; questions that will psychologically affect the core characters differently based not just on facts but their perceptions and what they fervidly wish to believe.\n\nPhyllis Paul’s characters are brilliantly drawn – the innocent, timid, melancholy Christine whose world is rocked by this tragedy as she dangerously tethers on the abyss of madness; the monstrous Keith Antequin, an overly ambitious man full of double standards, whose outward persona conveys a perception of unwavering devotion and loyalty to his father but inwardly resents him deeply, jealous of his fame and brilliance. So obsessed is he with his all-consuming ambition of making a name in the literary world that he is willing to go to any lengths…\n\nWe are also introduced to an ensemble of eccentric, intriguing characters – the Lamberts, Vivian’s parents: the self-absorbed Mr Lambert whose obsession with old junk particularly cars and seemingly worthless items of jewellery borders on the irrational completely ignoring his daughter’s well-being in the process. His wife Rosalie, Vivian’s stepmother, is too engrossed in her social life to care about Vivian, and for this, she is subject to her neighbours’ backbiting and insults, a scenario that only worsens after Vivian’s inexplicable disappearance. There’s Christine’s mother, a gentle dreamy soul who having led a contented married life is distressed by Christine’s tragic circumstances. We also meet Lia Freemantle, an unconventional, peculiar woman who at the start of the novel leaves on a journey for South America whose lack of moral scruples disturbs Christine. Last but not least is Helena, Keith’s wife, who despairs Keith’s obsession with ideas but loves the scent of mystery and the supernatural.\n\nIn Phyllis Paul’s offbeat world, the children are menacing and unlikeable, particularly notorious as harbingers of doom. Vivian, of course, is a prime example, but later on, we are introduced to Keith’s daughter Mirry, a shifty and calculating girl as well as Keith’s distant nephew, a seemingly dim child with a penchant for crookedness and concocting lies (“Quiet and docile, and a dullard at school, this strange boy was capable of very ingenious arrangements for his own well-being”).\n\nTwice Lost, then, is stunning; a wonderfully odd and compelling novella about deception and warped reality, the stories its characters make up, or the outward persona they display to meet a desired end be it fame, success or money, the outward façade of calm and stability belying the darkness lurking within. But in many ways, it is also a novel about the characters’ capacity for self-deception, a version of events they deliberately or subconsciously believe to assuage guilt or feelings of inadequacy. Other themes that take centre stage in this rich, layered novel are control and manipulation, guilt, neglect and ostracization, the trappings of an artistic career (fame, ambition, and failure), dysfunctional families, and how the innocent are pliable to the wickedness of the world at large.\n\nAn air of foreboding and unease permeates the novel; the narrative is bathed in a blend of sinister shadows and luminous light as if wrapped in a hazy veil that heightens the sense of claustrophobia and a palpable sense of danger; the presence of a sinister force likely to derail the fragile peace of a tranquil setting is ever present. This half-filtered, murky light is also representative of the nebulous personas of the characters – certain facets of their personalities revealed, the others hidden, their thoughts and actions obscured like fog enveloping a city.\n\nThe light of a November afternoon closing mistily and showing a carmine, rayless sun through the stripped boughs, entering the hall sparely through one tall window, gave to pale skin a faint, delicate incandescence like a symptom of fever: a light which allied itself with gloom in some strange manner.\n\nIn the final pages, a vivid, haunting, and atmospheric scene in the gloomy living room of Carlotta House sets the stage for the ensuing finale; a brilliant set piece that adds to the gothic feel of the novel and ratchets the tension complete with a dreary wintry vista (“the icicles started to drip, yet prolonged themselves”) and the cryptic presence of a girl outside the window who may or may not be an apparition, an occurrence that sows the seeds of manipulation, self-doubt and inexplicable fear in the characters assembled.\n\nThe room grew shadowy, the fanning light of the flames began to pulse visibly upon walls and furniture, and with backs turned to the wintry garden they did not realise how much of the suspended daylight was due to the reflection from the snow outside the large bay which came down to floor level. The soft and blanching light under a dark sky had endured from early morning, scarcely changing. Tea had been brought in, Keith called and apprised briefly of Rosalie’s story – and in the midst of the slight bustle, the little petulant treble of Mirry was suddenly uplifted.\n\n‘Mummy, there’s someone out there, a girl. Standing in the snow.’\n\nDeeply atmospheric and unsettling, there’s poetry to Paul’s flowing, baroque sentences whether she’s describing the beauty and languor of the pastoral surroundings or capturing the interior dramas of her unique characters. An element of creeping dread punctuates the story as the central characters struggle with disturbed dreams and muddled, distorted memories, stalled in a state of limbo as the enigma of the young girl’s perplexing disappearance continues to haunt them. Paul brilliantly holds together the narrative in a way that does not leave any dangling loose threads and yet they aren’t neatly tied either imbibing the storytelling with the kind of ambiguity that accentuates its strange power.\n\nPsychologically astute, intense, disconcerting, and deliciously compelling, Twice Lost is a fascinating, singular novel that deserves a wider readership. Phyllis Paul was a very private, reclusive writer who nearly died in obscurity and although she has written eleven novels, these books seem to have sunk into oblivion and are incredibly hard to find. That said, based on how good Twice Lost is, I hope more of her books are reissued in the future.\n\nWe are already midway through the year, and I have discovered some gems from NYRB Classics thanks to Kim McNeill’s wonderful reading project, #NYRBWomen23, and I am glad to say that Silvina Ocampo’s Thus Were Their Faces joins this list.\n\nHelen Oyeyemi’s introduction to Silvina Ocampo’s story collection Thus Were Their Faces is one of those rare instances where it is rewarding to read it first before delving into the stories. Of course, I skipped the sections where she specifically discussed certain stories, but it is still a good piece for a reader like me who had never read Ocampo before and therefore found it helpful to gain some perspective on how I should approach her work and her distinctive, eccentric worldview. We are told that in 1979, she was denied Argentina’s National Prize for Literature because the panel of judges deemed her stories too cruel. Meanwhile, around a year earlier in 1978, in his note at the end of the book, translator Daniel Balderston recounts his first meeting with Ocampo when he went to meet her husband, the noted author Adolfo Bioy Casares. Balderston met the couple often in Buenos Aires since then, and during one of their numerous conversations, the idea for this compilation of her stories was born. Ocampo insisted that they choose her cruelest stories for this project, a sharp contrast to the way the judges would go on to view her work in subsequent months.\n\nIn this anthology, Balderston has included around 42 stories from a substantial body of work, an exhaustive but brilliant collection that vividly gives a flavour of Ocampo’s astonishing imagination where she revels in challenging the conventional and distorting the way the reader sees things. With such a vast compendium of stories, it is not possible to review each one, so I selected a few of my favourites along with brief write-ups on some of the others to give the reader an idea of what to expect.\n\nWe begin with“Forgotten Journey” and “Strange Visit”, two short sketches that dwell on the bewildering mysteries of childhood and the loss of innocence. “Forgotten Journey”, notably, gives us a glimpse of a child’s imagination that is so at odds with the real world. Our young narrator tries to recall the day she was born believing that babies came from department stores where mothers picked them up and brought them home. As she grows older, the cruel truth of birth is revealed to her by a friend, but she finds the revelation so shocking that she prefers to find comfort in the lie reiterated by the nursemaid. And yet her anxiety, those unnamed childhood fears, refuse to be quelled (“The window was almost shut, and when her mother told her that the sun was glorious, she saw the dark sky of night where no bird sang”).\n\nNext, running to over 60 pages, the novella-length “The Impostor” is a dark, atmospheric tale of friendship and madness shimmering with mystery and menace. The story begins with our narrator Luis Maidana travelling on a train to the town of Cachari with The Swans Ranch as his final destination. At this ranch resides Armando Heradia, and Luis plans to stay with him for at least two to three weeks despite never having met Heradia before. The reason for Luis’s stay is part of a mission entrusted to him by Armando’s father who is worried by his son’s supposedly erratic behaviour and his desire to be left alone. Luis’s task involves nurturing a friendship with Armando, observing him, and reporting any untoward findings to the father.\n\nMr Heradia had recommended that I proceed with extreme care, behaving wisely and with my most subtle intelligence, so as to befriend Armando Heredia and be a positive influence on his difficult character. Such hopes were confusing to me.\n\nLuis is unsurprisingly dubious about the weeks ahead of him, not particularly looking forward to them. When he reaches the ranch, the gloom and isolation of the house only add to his unease. It is an uninviting dwelling by all counts, appearing mostly askew and haunted, and other than Armando and maybe a couple of staff, the place seems mostly uninhabited.\n\nThe merciless sun lit up the sky and a thick wooded area, the tops of the trees clearly coming into outline against the white clouds. A burning wind was blowing across the dry grass. That was the abandoned ranch. Above the roof of the house stretched a eucalyptus tree; some wildflowers grew on the roof. Vines devoured the doors, the eaves of the porches, the window railings. I had seen something similar in a film. A house full of spiderwebs, the doors falling off their hinges, with ghosts.\n\nNevertheless, Luis gradually begins to settle into the house’s rhythms, enjoying and basking in the abundance of nature surrounding it, and getting closer to Armando. Days are spent horseback riding, swimming, and indulging in other leisurely activities and as Luis and Armando become comfortable in each other’s company they begin sharing confidences.\n\nEvery friend, sooner or later, reveals to us some unexpected defect. Heredia was revealing my cowardice, or rather the fear I felt of appearing cowardly.\n\nBut all this only seems like a lull in the storm and as the story progresses periods of calm are punctuated by sinister and violent developments complete with an array of dreams that so blend with reality that the lines appear blurred. The tension between Luis and Armando escalates as the forces of infatuation and deceit begin to threaten their fragile friendship. Is Armando gripped with madness as alleged by his father or is Luis the one gradually losing control over his mind? The Imposter, then, is a great example of Ocampo’s unique storytelling skills, an intense montage of gothic elements, strangeness, and suspense with a surprising reveal towards the end.\n\nWe then come to the shorter pieces which begin with “The House Made of Sugar”, one of my favourite stories in the collection; a masterful and enigmatic exploration of a doomed marriage and the idea of doubles. Cristina is a woman whose life is defined by superstitions (“Superstitions kept Cristina from living”).\n\nA coin with a blurry face, a spot of ink, the moon seen through two panes initials of her name carved by chance on the trunk of a cedar: all these would make her mad with fear… There were certain streets we couldn’t cross, certain people we couldn’t see, certain movie theaters we couldn’t go to. Early in our relationship, these superstitions seemed charming to me, but later they began to annoy and even seriously worry me.\n\nThis story is narrated by her husband who informs us that as soon as they marry and start house-hunting, Cristina is insistent that they look for a brand new apartment because “according to her, the fate of the previous occupants would influence her life.” A request that doesn’t leave the couple with too many options, they visit all possible neighbourhoods in the city, even the distant ones, but do not find any that meet Cristina’s specific requirement. But finally, the husband finds a little house “that looked as if it were made of sugar” whose “whiteness gleamed with extraordinary brilliance”, a house that entrances Cristina. The husband soon discovers that it isn’t exactly new, it had been previously occupied and subsequently remodeled, but he decides to keep this fact to himself, a breach of trust that is bound to have consequences. Soon, Cristina’s personality undergoes subtle changes as it becomes clearer that she is transforming into Violeta, the previous occupant of the house. We are led to believe that the husband is the rational person here, but it is soon apparent that he is a mass of contradictions himself (“I made her see that she had a broken mirror in her room, yet she insisted on keeping it, no matter how I insisted that it was better to throw broken mirrors into water on a moonlit night to get rid of bad luck”). Unnerved by this chain of events, he begins to obsess about Violeta deluded by a misguided sense that he is protecting Cristina (“I don’t know who was the victim of whom in that house”).\n\nIn “Voice on the Telephone”, the setting is an innocuous children’s party that culminates in a horrific finale. Perhaps the opening dialogue is a grim portend of things to come, as the narrator warns someone on the telephone to not invite him to children’s parties because they depress him. There’s a reason for this, of course, a reason rooted in the narrator’s childhood, which he subsequently goes on recount both to the reader and the person at the other end of the phone. Coming from a privileged background, he particularly recollects a certain moment in time when his mother throws him a birthday party complete with presents, birthday cake, invitations to girls and boys of his age, and other assorted paraphernalia. But our narrator is an unusual child who favours “rugs, chandeliers, and glass cabinets in the house to his toys” and seems to prefer the company of adults rather than friends his age. At the birthday party, the mothers of the children gather in a separate room to chat and relax, and our narrator hides in a corner and observes them fascinated. When he is discovered by his mother and banished from the room, he plays a significant role in the tragedy that subsequently ensues.\n\nThe title story “Thus Were Their Faces” is another unforgettable story that subverts the reader’s assumptions. We are introduced to forty children whose faces so resemble one another that it is difficult to distinguish them. But it was not always that way – in the beginning “each child’s pain was individual and terrible, as was their happiness, which made their happiness itself painful.” Soon they are visited by an angel who tells them of their identical faces in a surprising revelation after which the children see themselves as one in thoughts as well as actions. An unexpected twist comes at the end when a plane crash and a subsequent news item throw light on the common trait that binds the children together whose fate after the accident seems linked to a possible strange celestial vision.\n\nIn “Lovers”, we see a shy, reticent couple spend an idyllic afternoon in a park relishing and savouring their picnic tea with its assortment of sumptuous, elaborately described cakes, not missing even a crumb – the ritual of eating masking the awkwardness between the two. Thereafter they talk, but their sporadic conversations verge on the bizarre with discussions focusing on incidents of death, decay, and drowning. After food and conversation, it seems time for the lovers to get intimate, but even then it seems their overall discomfort could get in the way.\n\nElsewhere, in “The Clock House”, a hunchbacked watchmaker is lulled into a village feast as the prominent guest where he becomes the victim of a monstrous turn of events; in “The Photographs”, a girl with prosthetic boots is subject to a battery of photographs with her family and is so exhausted by the end that she appears ‘asleep’ at the dinner table; in “The Objects” we meet a woman who is not troubled by the idea of losing things because of an “anxious foreboding that these objects would someday rob her of something more precious than her childhood”: in “The Fury” we are privy to random acts of cruelty between two girls and a narrator who “to avoid a scandal, managed to commit a crime.” In “The Expiation” we see a wife caught in a weird triangle that involves her husband who is obsessed with his performing canaries and his friend who openly desires her and hallucinates of being blinded by the birds; in “The Velvet Dress”, a woman finds the burden of her black velvet outfit too much to bear literally; while “And So Forth” is much gentler in tone, a lush descriptive tale of the growing love between a man and a mermaid.\n\nRevenge, casual cruelty, heartaches of childhood, prophecy and eerie soothsayings, madness, and the fluidity of dreams are some of the themes explored in this vast, varied collection. Trancelike and deliciously wicked, quite a few of these short pieces are imbued with a Saki-esque quality in their chilling portrayal of the characters’ fates; an uncanny, mocking gaze where the macabre bleeds into the mundane. Displaying a unique vision, many of the tales do not always have neat conclusions but are instead unsettling mood pieces that conjure up a surreal, richly-textured world peopled with peculiar, whimsical characters who often meet grotesque endings. We meet embalmed dogs, mermaids and angels, harassed hunchbacks, disconcerting doubles, clairvoyant children, jealous lovers, fiendish friends et al strikingly depicted by the might of Ocampo’s pen.\n\nThese are stories that shimmer with dreams, visions, and fantastical happenings showcasing Ocampo’s vivid imagination, a flair for the sinister, and her refusal to conform to conventional structures of storytelling. As is the case with short story collections, not each and every story will necessarily resonate but many do stick in the mind, and the interesting thing is that each reader might have a list of favourites that is a tad different from someone else’s. Highly recommended!\n\nI hadn’t heard of Elspeth Barker until in the last few months her only novel O Caledonia featured regularly in various monthly book stack photos on Twitter, and then my curiosity was piqued. Having now read it, this book blew me away and is sure to find a place in my year end list.\n\nThere’s a scene in the final pages of the novel, when Vera, the mother, takes Janet, her eldest daughter and child to a shop to select a dress for the hunt ball. Having turned sixteen, Vera is keen to launch Janet into society, and the hunt ball has been planned for this very purpose. Despite the strained relationship between Vera and Janet, Vera harbours hope, however slim, that this shopping expedition might just turn out to be an occasion for bonding. Vera chooses a beautiful white delicate gown for Janet to try on, but Janet is unhappy. Instead, she selects a loud purple dress that Vera thinks is hideous but which she accepts with resignation, a reminder that the gulf between mother and daughter will forever remain unbridgeable.\n\nEnamoured by purple, her absolutely favourite colour, Janet loves the dress and genuinely believes it to be an expression of her individuality and she does stand out at the party but as a figure of scorn rather than of admiration.\n\nThis, then, is the fate to always befall Janet in Elspeth Barker’s O Caledonia, a brilliant, immersive, haunting tale of an intelligent often misunderstood young woman who unable to conform to societal expectations seeks solace in books, animals and her wild, vivid imagination.\n\nThe book opens with an arresting scene in an isolated Scottish castle. The play of filtered light on the stained-glass window refracts a splash of vibrant colours on the great stone staircase. And at the bottom of the stairs lies Janet clad in her mother’s black evening gown “twisted and slumped in bloody, murderous death.” Regarded as a difficult, troublesome girl by her family, she is soon forgotten, but the only living creature who pines for her is Claws, Janet’s beloved jackdaw who mournfully roams around her room searching for her in vain only to finally die (“At last, in desolation, like a tiny kamikaze pilot, he flew straight into the massive walls of Auchnasaugh and killed himself”).\n\nThe rest of the book then is a flashback that spans sixteen years as the reader is given an account of Janet’s short, turbulent life and the events leading to her death.\n\nJanet is the first child born to Hector and Vera in wartime on a “fog-bound winter night in Edinburgh.” Once Hector is called away to the front, Vera moves with Janet to an Edwardian mansion by the sea owned by Hector’s parents. From an early age, Janet displays a lively imagination, an aptitude for books and learning and a special bond that she shares with her grandparents, especially the grandmother. But as the family keeps expanding, Janet is quickly sidelined and her fiery, rebellious nature increasingly makes her feel like an outsider within her own family. In subsequent years, Francis is born, and then Rhona to be followed by Lulu and Caro and Janet becomes contemptuous of her siblings failing to attain any kinship with them.\n\nThe fact that Janet is sometimes an awkward girl, clumsy with the tasks thrust upon her often instigates the ire of her mother and Nanny, a strict, God-fearing nurse employed to look after the children. Surrounded by a family that fails to understand her because she refuses to bend to its set, conformist ways, Janet turns inward, seeking refuge in her books and her thoughts, and developing a keen love for animals. The feeling of isolation only heightens, when her grandmother, the only family member she was very close to suddenly dies.\n\nBut then the war is over, and the family subsequently moves to a solitary Scottish castle called Auchnasaugh, a property left to Hector by his uncle on the condition that his cousin Lila is allowed to stay on there. Hector has no problem with the arrangement, but Vera is livid though helpless to do anything about it.\n\nAuchnasaugh, the field of sighing, took its name from the winds which lamented around it almost all the year, sometimes moaning softly, filtered through swathes of pine groves, more often malign, shrieking over the battlements and booming down the chimneys, so that the furnace which fed the ancient central heating system roared up and the pipes shuddered and the Aga top glowed infernal red. Then the jackdaws would explode in a dense cloud from their hiding places on the roof and float on the high wild air crying warning and woe to the winter world. ‘A gaunt place,’ said the village people, and they seldom passed that way.\n\nVera detests Auchnasaugh, but Janet loves it passionately. The remoteness and solitary quality of the castle reflects Janet’s state of being, the sense of aloneness she experiences even amongst people.\n\nIndeed, for her Auchnasaugh was a place of delight and absolute beauty, all her soul had ever yearned for, so although she could understand that many a spirit might wish to return to it, and she hoped that in time she too might do so, she felt the circumstances and mood of such visitations could only be joyous. She had no fear of its lofty shadowed rooms, its dim stone passages, its turrets and towers and dank subterranean chambers, dripping with verdigris and haven to rats. So running now down the narrow twisting road through the forest, she looked forward to the moment when it dropped to the dark, secret glen, where the great hills rose steeply on each side and halfway up one of them, hidden by its trees, stood the castle.\n\nShe is most comfortable in the company of her eccentric cousin Lila – a despondent, lonely whisky-swigging woman accused of being responsible for her Russian husband’s death and branded as an outcast. Lila’s narrow world is defined by her filthy room (a den of discarded food and assorted bric-a-brac among other things), heavy drinking and a passion for growing mushrooms and other forms of fungi, and her raggedy cat Mouflon. For the most part, Lila stays out of the family’s way, but an occasional presence only fuels Vera’s anger further.\n\nAbout the room were many other desiccated trophies bracket fungi like Neanderthal livers, long-dead roses in jam-jars green with algae, bracken and rowan berries hung in shrivelled swags round the mirror frames, straw hats pinned to the walls, dust lying heavy on the brims, turning their wreathed flowers a uniform grey. The crumpled rugs s bore a patina of cigarette ash, the ashtrays brimmed, books lay open on the floor and tables, stained with coffee, dog-eared and annotated. These books were in Russian, for Lila, like the Heraclea, originated there.\n\nIf Janet had her way, she would have happily continued to stay on in Auchnasaugh, but that is not to be. She is sent to a boarding school, St Uncumba’s, for further studies where her sense of isolation only deepens (“But nothing could assuage the cold, familiar dereliction of night in the dormitory, with the sea below the cliff and the sea wind whipping the sleet against the windows”). Despite what she perceives as a claustrophobic, two-dimensional world, Janet finds within her a way to survive, but she is forced to admit much to her dismay that even to be accepted by her classmates is to pander to their expectations. She cannot flower or let her own personality develop because that would make her an object of ridicule. For instance, Janet abhors sports, but those showing a prowess in games are lauded, while on the rare occasion when Janet displays her keen intelligence, she is immediately made to pay for being a show-off.\n\nJanet began to hate the sea. There was so much of it, flowing, counter-flowing, entering other seas, slyly furthering its interests beyond the mind’s reckoning; no wonder it could pass itself off as sky; it was voracious marine confederacy. She saw how it diminished people as they walked along the shore; they lost their identity, were no more than pebbles, part of the sea’s scheme. Once there had been a great forest below the cliffs; there the hairy mammoth had browsed and raised his trunk and trumpeted. There had been mountain crags and deep, sweet valleys of gentle herbivores. The sea had come and taken them.\n\nIn Janet, Elspeth Barker has created a wonderful, brilliant character – nonconformist, dreamy and a misfit within the conventional boundaries of society. She is a doomed young girl but her fierce determination to remain true to herself and staunch refusal to be molded as per the dictates of others makes her utterly remarkable. A deep love for reading, an alternate world conjured up by her imagination and an intense fascination with the natural world propels her forward when all else around her seems bleak. She is drawn towards Lila, because she is subconsciously aware of how similar they are, how they are shunned by so-called “normal” people. And yet, as she grows older so does the raging conflict within her – although she hates people and the idea of being sociable, there’s a part of her that desires to be accepted and included, but on her terms and not theirs.\n\nLoneliness, a troubled mother-daughter relationship, sibling rivalries, the feeling of being an outcast within your own family and a misfit in society, a lone woman’s struggle for acceptance, the yearning to live life on your own terms are some of the major themes featured in O Caledonia articulated in a style that is so original and striking.\n\nThe biggest highlight of O Caledonia though is Barker’s stunning writing. It’s truly a feast for the senses dotted with rich, kaleidoscopic imagery, lush language, dazzling manner of expression, and haunting dreamlike vibes. For instance, there’s Nanny bearing down “with a face like the North Sea.” A purple silk flower has “petals lapped in all shades of mauve, violet, heliotrope.” At the beach, the children run on “the mirror-bright sand filmed in water”, and the beach itself “spread in a great curve, fringed by mournful dunes.” There’s the giant hogweed grove at Auchnasaugh, whose great heads of flowers “swayed in menace against the windy sky and its serpentine stems reared triumphant and rutilant.” During a particularly exquisite summer Janet watches the “silent golden day bring glory to the sombre pines.” And then the view from Janet’s dormitory window “where the grey sea imperceptibly merged into the grey sky” that was like “living at the end of the world.” Here’s another example…\n\nFuller’s was the good thing about trips to the dentist. With faces frozen by the sleety wind and the jaw-scrunching needle they would step from the you granite street and the granite sky into a warm lamp-lit haven. The carpets were pink and dense so that moved soundlessly; there were no windows; you could forget the outer world. Teaspoons clinked on porcelain saucers, tiered stands shone, laden with the snowy glory of Fuller’s walnut cake. Reverently the waitress raised the silver dome from a fragrant mound of buttered toast, flaccid and dribbling with amber rivulets.\n\nDeeply atmospheric with a trancelike quality, O Caledonia is steeped in gothic overtones – a draughty, solitary castle perched atop a hill in the wilds of Scotland; the vast, immense, unyielding sea that heightens Janet’s loneliness; lonely moors; wintertime accentuated by shrieking owls, leafless beeches and a hush, stark landscape. A gorgeous evocative mood piece, O Caledonia pulsates with elements that are reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle, and even Molly Keane’s Good Behaviour.\n\nO Caledonia, then, is a poetic and beautiful novel, an ode to individuality, nature and literature with an unforgettable heroine at its heart. Highly, highly recommended!\n\nShirley Jackson is an author who has been on my radar for quite some time but whose books I never got around to reading until now. And I am so glad I did.\n\nI started with We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the last novel she wrote and published, and what a fabulous book it turned out to be.\n\nThe first chapter in We Have Always Lived in the Castle is brilliant. Here’s how it opens and draws the reader in…\n\nMy name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.\n\nMary Katherine (Merricat) Blackwood is walking to the village to borrow books from the library and buy supplies from the grocery store. Merricat lives on Blackwood Farm with her elder sister Constance and their Uncle Julian. Constance is uncomfortable going beyond the confines of their home (possibly due to agoraphobia) and Uncle Julian is quite frail both physically and mentally.\n\nSo the task of doing the grocery shopping falls on Merricat. It is a ritual she follows every week, but not something that she enjoys doing. The reason is all too clear. She hates bumping into the villagers, who jeer at her and pass comments behind her back. The children are even worse as they chant strange rhymes when she walks past.\n\nMerricat, said Connie, would you like a cup of tea?\n\nOh no, said Merricat, you’ll poison me.\n\nAlready the reader is aware that something is amiss and feels a bit of the fear that Merricat is experiencing.\n\nWhy do the villagers behave the way they do? The answer lies in a gruesome incident that occurred in the Blackwood family six years ago. The sisters’ parents, aunt and younger brother die of arsenic poisoning when having dinner at the family home and Constance is charged for this crime. Merricat is not present then, and Uncle Julian manages to survive.\n\nDue to lack of evidence, Constance is acquitted, but the stigma surrounding the Blackwood sisters remains. Fearing the taunts of people outside, the three of them lead a solitary existence in their home, and rarely mix with outsiders.\n\nSome of the wealthier inhabitants in the village do make the effort keep in touch. One of them is Helen Clarke who visits the sisters every Friday for tea.\n\nThe elder sister Constance comes across as a gentle person and keeps herself busy by cleaning the house and cooking scrumptious meals for the family. Uncle Julian is gradually losing his faculties and is obsessed with the details of that fateful day when the Blackwood family was poisoned. He is jotting it all down in his papers hoping to publish it as a book.\n\nBut the star of the book is really Merricat. As a narrator, she is very strange and fascinating; traits which are accentuated by her skewed and childlike way of viewing the world at large. For the most part it feels as though we are reading the narrative of a child only to be reminded that Merricat is actually a young adult of eighteen.\n\nMerricat adores Constance and is fiercely protective of their simple and solitary way of living. She indulges in her own make-believe world, a world to which she will one day be transported and find some modicum of safety and happiness. Here she is talking to Constance…\n\n“On the moon we have everything. Lettuce, and pumpkin pie and Amanita phalloides. We have cat-furred plants and horses dancing with their wings. All the locks are solid and tight, and there are no ghosts. On the moon Uncle Julian would be well and the sun would shine every day. You would wear our mother’s pearls and sing, and the sun would shine all the time.”\n\nHer life is made up of routines that involve going to the market, helping Constance with the cleaning, running wild and spending time by herself on the vast family property, the cat Jonas being her only companion.\n\nMerricat’s limited world is made up of superstitions. She believes chanting certain words or smashing mirrors will ward off evil influences on the family. She leaves totems around the family property all in a childish effort to seal the family off from strangers.\n\nOn Sunday mornings I examined my safeguards, the box of silver dollars I had buried by the creek, and the doll buried in the long field, and the book nailed to the tree in the pine woods; so long as they were where I had put them nothing could get in to harm us.\n\nUntil one day Merricat’s world is shaken up when their cousin Charles Blackwood shows up. This sparks off a chain of events that disrupt the lives of all the three inhabitants of the house.\n\nCharles had only gotten in because the magic was broken; if I could re-seal the protection around Constance and shut Charles out he would have to leave the house. Every touch he made on the house must be erased.\n\nThe two sisters are both different and similar at the same time. Constance in some sense is the grown up as she buries herself in the comfort of preparing meals and doing household chores. Merricat is the untamed one, as she spends considerable time outdoors even sleeping in the woods in her secret hiding place sometimes. And yet they are similar – both shun outside contact, while at the same time find solace in everyday rituals.\n\nAll the Blackwood women had taken the food that came from the ground and preserved it, and the deeply coloured rows of jellies and pickles and bottled vegetables and fruit, maroon and amber and dark rich green stood side by side in our cellar and would stand there forever, a poem by the Blackwood women. Each year Constance and Uncle Julian and I had jam or preserve and pickle that Constance had made, but we never touched what belonged to the others; Constance said it would kill us if we ate it.\n\nEven though this is an unsettling novel, Jackson expertly sprinkles doses of dark humour. There are two set pieces which are particularly wonderful and both of them involve Uncle Julian. The first is in the early pages when Helen Clarke visits the Blackwoods for the customary Friday tea. This time she brings another guest unannounced – the meek Mrs Wright. Mrs Wright, against her better judgement and manners, is fascinated by the poisoning case and Uncle Julian sensing this exploits her curiosity to maximum effect. The other set piece involves Charles, the two sisters and Uncle Julian where the latter feels threatened that Charles is out to destroy his beloved papers. These flashes of comedy are perfect in relieving some moments of claustrophobia.\n\nThere are two themes that are strongly on display in the novel.\n\nThe first is how badly conventional society perceives those who are cut from a different cloth largely labelling them as outcasts. It’s a society riddled with prejudices where people who deviate from certain accepted norms are not looked upon kindly.\n\nThe novel also examines how as individuals we can be resistant to change and the degree to which we will react if we feel threatened. We see this in Merricat’s behaviour who will go to any lengths to preserve her distorted ideal of family happiness.\n\nJackson’s writing is simply brilliant. She is great at creating atmosphere that is seeped in gothic elements – the creeping sense of dread as we read about the fate of the Blackwood sisters in their large home – even if there are no actual ghosts present. Her dialogues also crackle as does her penchant for wit.\n\nIn my Library of America edition of Jackson’s work, there is a chronology of her writing and personal life which makes for fascinating reading. At the time of writing this novel, Jackson was essentially housebound and in frail health, and I can’t help but think that some of what she was experiencing possibly found its way into this book.\n\nIndeed, I can firmly say that We Have Always Lived in the Castle will easily find a place in my ‘Best of’ list this year.\n\nThe last month has been quite busy and hectic. And while I have managed to read some wonderful books, I have not quite had the time to write about them. That is why in this particular post, I have chosen to review two books instead of one. I have greatly enjoyed both and they are strong contenders for my Best of the Year list.\n\nSo here goes…\n\nJourney into the Mind’s Eye – Lesley Blanch\n\nHere’s what the NYRB Classics blurb says:\n\n“My book is not altogether autobiography, nor altogether travel or history either. You will just have to invent a new category,” Lesley Blanch wrote about Journey into the Mind’s Eye, a book that remains as singularly adventurous and intoxicating now as when it first came out in 1968.\n\nAt a very young age, Lesley Blanch is dazzled by The Traveller and his stories of seventeenth and eighteenth century Russia. There is an aura of mystery around The Traveller and not much is revealed about him for much of the book other than that he is an older man, Russian with Asiatic features, and around the same age as Lesley’s parents. He periodically visits their home. But because of him, she develops a deep passion for Russia and Siberia, and has dreams of one day embarking on a journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway – a dream that comes to dominate her life.\n\nIn a way, the Traveller becomes an important man in her life. In her late teens, on a trip to Paris and later to Dijon, they consummate their relationship. Later, Blanch joins him, his aunt and his two sons on a family idyll to Corsica for two months. And then the Traveller disappears.\n\nBut in no way does that diminish Blanch’s passion for Russia and the Trans-Siberian railroad. Infact, she continues to visit the homes of Russian emigres in Paris to whet her desire for all things Russian and hold on to her vision of the Russia of yore.\n\nLife goes on, and Blanch meets the French author Romain Gary. Enthralled by his Russian origins and deep voice, she marries him. Gary at the time is in the diplomatic service, and so they travel widely staying in places such as New York, Los Angeles, and Bulgaria to name a few. And while not her beloved Russia, these are postings that Blanch enjoys greatly, Bulgaria being the highlight during her time with Gary.\n\nGary then leaves her for the actress Jean Seberg. However, Blanch does not dwell on this too much. In a sentence, she only mentions matter of factly of their marriage ending in a divorce.\n\nMore importantly, now that she is on her own once again, it renews her vigour to finally visit Russia and embark on her much anticipated Trans-Siberian journey.\n\nHere’s the Guardian:\n\nHer avoidance of a conventional life in London led her on quixotic voyages geo-graphically and emotionally. In 1931 she became one of the rare tourists to Stalin’s Soviet Union. Dragged around monuments to Soviet progress, she perplexed her guides with questions about the homes of 19th-century writers, all the while glancing over her shoulder and around corners for that beloved Asiatic face.\n\nBlanch’s dream of travelling on the Trans-Siberian railroad does come true, and this is not really a spoiler given what’s so rewarding about this book is the journey and not the end result. But after a very long hiatus, will she meet the man who shaped her life – the Traveller?\n\nJourney into the Mind’s Eye is a wonderful book and Blanch’s passion for Russia and Siberia sparkles on every page. It is a hybrid work of memoir, travelogue, history, and displays Blanch as startlingly ahead of her time. It certainly fuelled my appetite for travel to far flung places!\n\nBitter Orange – Claire Fuller\n\nWhen the book opens Frances Jellico has just arrived at the crumbling English mansion Lyntons. We are told that the mansion has been purchased by an American Mr Lieberman who has yet to visit the place. However, he wants an estimate of the treasures at the mansion. For a fee, Frances is appointed to study the architecture of the gardens and bridges and compile a report.\n\nFrances at the time has just lost her mother and so this position could not have come at a more opportune time.\n\nOnce there, she comes across her neighbours – the hedonistic couple Peter and Cara. There’s more. Frances also discovers a peephole in the floorboard of her bathroom, which allows her to spy on both of them.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Cara are enthusiastic to befriend Frances and she is thrilled. Frances is shown to be a plain, ordinary woman, overweight and not attractive in the conventional sense. Peter and Cara are quite the opposite: good-looking and glamorous.\n\nIncreasingly, they spend most of their days together – having lavish meals prepared by Cara, drinking wine after wine from bottles taken from the cellar downstairs, smoking cigarettes and languidly soaking up the summer sun.\n\nAnd then the cracks start becoming visible – atleast Peter and Cara’s relationship is not as hunky dory as it originally appears. It all culminates in a tragedy that has a lasting impact on Frances’ life.\n\nClaire Fuller has penned a dark and atmospheric tale with gothic overtones that is gripping and hard to put down. The summer is wonderfully evoked and the characters are also well drawn. At its heart, Bitter Orange is a tale about loneliness, obsession and wanting to belong.\n\nThat Frances wants to belong is quite obvious given her diffident personality and the fact that she is now alone and left to fend for herself. So much so that as the days carry on, she becomes obsessed with both of them taking a deep interest in their relationship, and what it means to her.\n\nBut in a sense, Peter and Cara are struggling to belong too, to find their bearings. Cara, particularly, is prone to bouts of anger and is quite clear that she does not want to go back to her home and a stifled existence in Ireland. She is yearning for a different life, with the firm belief that Italy will make her dreams come true. Peter is in some sense adrift too. He leaves his first wife for Cara, but is it is decision that will give him satisfaction?\n\nBitter Orange was thoroughly engrossing and I will be exploring more of Claire Fuller’s work."
