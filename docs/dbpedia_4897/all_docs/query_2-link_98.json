        "text": "Credit: Amblin/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\n‘Casper’ Cast: Where Are They Now? Christina Ricci, Devon Sawa and More\n\nCasper became an instant after its 1995 debut — and it still resonates as a spooky Halloween staple.\n\nBased on the Harvey Comics character of the same name, Casper starred Bill Pullman as James Harvey, a spirit specialist who moves to a haunted mansion in Maine with his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) after the death of his wife.\n\n[sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"dbZMfRY74G-2836947-14453\"]\n\nAs the father-daughter duo quickly realize they're sharing their space with four ghosts — Casper (voiced by Malachi Pearson and played in his human form by Devon Sawa) and his three uncles. While Casper quickly falls in love with Kat, their budding relationship runs into complications thanks to his troublemaking relatives — who are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure the house stays theirs.\n\nWhile Casper became a cult classic and shot Ricci to stardom, the Yellowjackets actress, who was 13 when the film premiered, looks back on her performance with disdain.\n\n\"If you actually watch Casper, I'm terrible,\" the Sleepy Hollow star said during an appearance on the “WTF With Marc Maron\" podcast in August 2022. \"People get so upset when I say that. And I'm like, 'No, it's a wonderful movie. It's a childhood treasure. But I am terrible in it.'\"\n\nKeep scrolling to see where the cast of Casper is now:\n\nCredit: Shutterstock(3); YouTube\n\nJoe Alaskey, Brad Garrett, Joe Nipote\n\nAlaskey, who lent his voice to Stinkie, was the voice of a multitude of Warner Brothers characters over the span of his career including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Tweety and Speedy Gonzales. He also voiced Plucky Duck on Tiny Toon Adventures from 1990 to 1995 and Grandpa Lou Pickles on Nickelodeon’s Rugrats. Alaskey died of cancer in February 2016 at the age of 63.\n\nGarrett, who voiced Fatso in the family-friendly Halloween flick, is most well-known for his role on the CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond and was nominated for an Emmy Award after portraying Jackie Gleason in the television film Gleason in 2002.\n\nGarrett has also lent his voice talents to A Bug’s Life, Stuart Little, Finding Nemo, Garfield, Ratatouille and Tangled and has won three Emmy awards.\n\nBeyond his role as Stretch in Casper, Nipote is best known for starring as Frankie Waters in NBC & UPN's Viper for five seasons. In 2014 he voiced Jean Lafoote, the \"crunch berry-seeking pirate” in the animated web series, Cap'n Crunch."
