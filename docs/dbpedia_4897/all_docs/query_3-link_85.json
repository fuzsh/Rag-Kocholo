The comedy series is about a cantankerous 80-year-old washed up actress who lives alone and lonely in Hollywood until she hires a clueless young man to run errands for her. The series deals with the unlikely friendship and the crazy misadventures these two mismatched partners in crime get into. The series also features guest star turns from Allison Janney, Octavia Spencer, Peri Gilpin, Priscilla Barnes, and Jim Rash. Highlights of Cubine's career as a producer include BRAVE NEW JERSEY starring Tony Hale and Anna Camp, LUCKY with Colin Hanks, Ari Graynor, Jeffrey Tambor and Ann-Margret, Miramax's OUR VERY OWN, starring Allison Janney, Cheryl Hines, Jason Ritter, Keith Carradine. OUR VERY OWN received a 2005 Independent Spirit Award nomination for Janney and went on to win many festival awards.
