        "text": "Jennifer Aniston was born in Sherman Oaks, California, to actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow. Her father was Greek, and her mother was of English, Irish, Scottish, and Italian descent. Jennifer spent a year of her childhood living in Greece with her family. Her family then relocated to New York City where her parents divorced when she was nine. Jennifer was raised by her mother and her father landed a role, as \"Victor Kiriakis\", on the daytime soap Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). Jennifer had her first taste of acting at age 11 when she joined the Rudolf Steiner School's drama club. It was also at the Rudolf Steiner School that she developed her passion for art. She began her professional training as a drama student at New York's School of Performing Arts, aka the \"Fame\" school. It was a division of Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts. In 1987, after graduation, she appeared in such Off-Broadway productions as \"For Dear Life\" and \"Dancing on Checker's Grave\". In 1990, she landed her first television role, as a series regular on Molloy (1990). She also appeared in The Edge (1992), Ferris Bueller (1990), and had a recurring part on 4x Herman (1991). By 1993, she was floundering. Then, in 1994, a pilot called \"Friends Like These\" came along. Originally asked to audition for the role of \"Monica\", Aniston refused and auditioned for the role of \"Rachel Green\", the suburban princess turned coffee peddler. With the success of the series Friends (1994), Jennifer has become famous and sought-after as she turns her fame into movie roles during the series hiatus.\n\nCourteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama, into an affluent Southern family. She is the daughter of Courteney (Bass) and Richard Lewis Cox (1930-2001), a businessman. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy's girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.\n\nShe became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.\n\nWhile modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) as a young d√©butante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Die Spezialisten unterwegs (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Familienbande (1982).\n\nIn 1989, Familienbande (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven's horror/comedy Scream - Schrei! (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox's film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.\n\nHardly the dumb blonde of Romy und Michele (1997), Lisa was born in Encino, California on July 30, 1963. Her mother, Nedra S. (Stern), worked as a travel agent, and her father, Lee N. Kudrow, is a physician. Her parents are both from Jewish families (from Belarus, Russia, and Hungary). Lisa was raised in Tarzana and played varsity-level tennis in high school and college, and is a pool shark who has mastered some of the more difficult trick shots (so beware). She graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychobiology. At first, she wanted to pursue a career in research, so she returned to Los Angeles to begin working with her father. However, Lisa got inspired to perform by one of her brother's friends, comedian Jon Lovitz, and so the tall (5' 8\") blonde-haired, green-eyed beauty entered show biz. Lisa auditioned for the improv theater group, The Groundlings, based in Los Angeles. Cynthia Szigeti, a well-known improv teacher, took Lisa under her wing. In that class, Lisa became a friend of Conan O'Brien. Graduating with honors in 1989, Lisa became a full-fledged member of The Groundlings. Breaking into TV, she got a recurring role as Ursula, the ditsy waitress on Verr√ºckt nach dir (1992). This led to her starring role on Friends (1994). In the debut season (1994-95) of Friends (1994), Lisa earned an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series; in 1998, she won that award for her role as Phoebe, the ditsy but lovable folk singer. Lisa has also been nominated for Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and American Comedy Awards for her performances.\n\nLisa made the transition to the big screen with a lot of success. In 1997, she starred opposite Oscar winner Mira Sorvino in the above-mentioned Romy und Michele (1997). Lisa garnered more praise for her film work when she got the New York Film Critics Award for her starring role in The Opposite of Sex - Das Gegenteil von Sex (1998).\n\nLisa married Michel Stern, an advertising executive, on May 27, 1995. On May 7, 1998, they were blessed with a son, Julian Murray; they live in Los Angeles.\n\nJames Michael Tyler was born in Mississippi. The youngest of five children, he was raised by a retired United States Air Force captain father and a homemaker mother.

While getting his B.S., Tyler joined the Clemson Players and found a love of theatre and started acting. He went on to receive an MFA in Acting from the University of Georgia.\n\nAfter a brief stint selling cars in Olympia, WA, he moved to Los Angeles, CA. Upon arriving in Hollywood, he worked in both the service and entertainment industries. He was a bar-back at the Palace, sold keyboards at Guitar Center, and was a barista at the Bourgeois Pig. He also worked his way up as an extra and production assistant. Ultimately, Tyler gained acclaim playing the role of Gunther in \"Friends\".\n\nWhen not acting, Tyler liked to play Rocket League on PS4 and record music in his home studio.\n\nHe was a founding member, along with Keith King, of the collaborative improvisational band \"Red Felt Pig\".\n\nTyler preferred to be called by his middle name, Michael.\n\nHe lived in Hollywood with his wife Jenn and their leopard gecko, Rodni.\n\nElliott Gould is an American actor known for his roles in M*A*S*H (1970), his Oscar-nominated performance in Bob & Caroline & Ted & Alice (1969), and more recently, his portrayal of old-time con artist Reuben Tishkoff in Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's 13 (2007).

His family were Jewish immigrants (from Romania, Belarus, and Russia).\n\nGould's portrayal of Trapper John in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H (1970) marked the beginning of perhaps the most prolific period of his career, highlighted by such roles as Philip Marlowe in Altman's Der Tod kennt keine Wiederkehr (1973) and Robert Caulfield in Unternehmen Capricorn (1977).\n\nOn television Gould has the distinction of having hosted Saturday Night Live (1975) six times and helmed E/R (1984), a situation comedy set in Chicago about a divorced physician working in an emergency room, which aired for one season.

She sets the bar for all at an entirely new height with this year's \"Outstanding Actress, Short Form, Comedy or Drama, Short Form\" for her critically lauded performance in \"Break a Hip\" earning a remarkable seventh Emmy nomination for a superior performance. Earlier, Christina earned an Emmy nod for her hilarious role on \"Friends\" as 'Ross' and 'Monica Geller's' mom adding to five nominations for her historic role on precedent-setting \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nProbably best known for her portrayal of \"Nurse Helen Rosenthal\" on the NBC hit hospital drama \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Judy Geller,\" the dysfunctional mother of Monica (Courtney Cox) and Ross (David Schwimmer), on the NBC smash comedy hit \"Friends,\" Christina was Emmy-nominated five times for \"St. Elsewhere\" and once for her indelible role on \"Friends.\"\n\nChristina just added her seventh Emmy nomination this summer for her hilarious and touching performance as \"Biz\" in the short-form comedy series \"Break A Hip.\" Guest stars and riveting performances surround her indelible character including those from Oscar winners Allison Janey, Octavia Spencer and Jim Rash as well as a laugh-out-loud turn from Peri Giipin. It was Christina five years ago that learned about the infectious storyline of \"Break A Hip\" and its protagonist, 'Biz,' insisting producer/director Cameron Watson turn this into the Short Form hit series you see today. It's the best in its space at a time when all of us are living longer and know a 'Biz' in our lives.\n\nChristina trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London before moving to New York where she was a member of The APA Repertory Company and enjoyed a luminous career starring on and Off-Broadway.

After a few years in Orinda, California, the Sibbett family moved to the idyllic island of Alameda where destiny bellowed at her daily in the form of a gruff neighbor. It was here that her best friends' father would announce daily upon her always shy, red-cheeked arrival, \"Here is Jane Sibbett -- Star of Stage, Screen, Radio, and Television!\" In the late 70s Jane did become a teenage DJ and station manager at K-RAT in Sacramento, California, as well as make her theatrical debut at the Eagle Theater. Though always dreaming of being a writer, Jane so loved being able to lose her still shy self in acting, she applied to enter the theater program at UCLA, gaining a spot on the prestigious Acting Continuum under magnificent Jennifer Penny Rountree. Upon graduating from UCLA, Jane continued working with the women of the Continuum, going on to act, write and co-produce several long running, much lauded plays in Los Angeles. Jane's acting career continued to keep her busy enough that even her honeymoon with writer/producer/director Karl Fink had to be squeezed into a hiatus week before the wedding. She and her husband remain busy and blissful in ongoing collaboration with one another and their three children on an animal packed farm in Southern California. (However, they divorced in 2016.) Jane's best friends remain so after nearly 40 years and their father, who heralded Jane's destiny, is most gratefully still looking for his due in her continuing success.\n\nAisha Tyler is an award-winning director, actor, comedian, New York Times bestselling author, podcaster and activist.
