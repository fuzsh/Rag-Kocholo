        "text": "The One in Massapequa\n\nMonica becomes inarticulate while giving her toast at a 35th wedding anniversary party for her parents, Jack (recurring guest star Elliott Gould) and Judy (recurring guest star Christina Pickles), and regrets volunteering to make the speech instead of Ross. Phoebe brings her latest boyfriend, Parker (recurring guest star Alec Baldwin), an effusive optimist who is so enthusiastic about everything that he makes people crazy. Meanwhile, Ross is astounded when Jack and Judy ask him and the pregnant Rachel to pretend to be married, in order to prevent a potential scandal.\n\nSisters Without Subtext\n\nJessica is pleased to hear her sister has decided to go to college but does not support her decision to pursue an art degree; Marvin and Honey take Eddie, Emery and Evan to visit a retirement home."
