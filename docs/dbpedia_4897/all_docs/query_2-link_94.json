Be sure to join next weeks conversation so that you can gain access to the growing documentation of best practices, questions and feedback on AI tools in their growth in the #Automotive industry. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of some of the topics covered: Vendors, take the advice you can give to your dealer clients when it comes to tailoring your pitch. Dealers, remember to just do one thing. We know your head is spinning from everything you learned at DigitalDealer, but keep the momentum by implementing one small thing now. Dealers and vendors, a mutually beneficial partnership starts by providing clean data and truthful information as an exchange to build a foundation on which the relationship will grow. Before you bring on an AI tool to assist, make sure that you have your house in order. Ensure your processes are not only dialed in, but in writing. By tightening up your process, you will save some time in the store, and you will set your dealership and the AI up for success by allowing it to learn how your dealership functions and grow from that knowledge."
