        "text": "Note: I read this book long before it was turned into a hokey made for tv movie and it was actually pretty damned good. Unfortunately, made for tv movies being what they are, they kinda took some liberties with the script — as in they added a Pro Anorexia Is (obviously) Evil subplot that didn’t exist in the book — but what can ya do, right?The movie is about two sisters, Frannie (played by Christina Hendricks) and her younger sister Shelly (Susan May Pratt) who has shipped herself off to a psychiatric hospital to get treatment for her anorexia. Susan May Pratt has played an anorexic/eating disordered person at least twice in her acting career, and it’s really no wonder, she’s a fucking twig. Let’s hope it was just due to temporary typecasting causing her to slim down for the two roles and not her having an Actual Real Life Eating Disorder — I’ll be honest, I’ve seriously wondered while watching this and Center Stage if she really was anorexic.\n\nFrannie and Shelly’s mother (played by Barbara Hershey) is Clearly Evil and a Certified Bad Mother, obsessed with dieting and weight — not just her own, but Frannie’s as well. She put Frannie on diets, including taking her to Weight Watchers (or a Weight Watchers type of group), since she was a child. Shelly gets oddly jealous of this mother-daughter sadomasochistic relationship and decides that she wants to diet too. So we see a young Shelly begging to be put on a diet and her mother praising her for having the “legs of a gazelle” but then taking the skin off her chicken and saying, “Here, you’re dieting. Feel better?”\n\nWhen the girls get older, Frannie has little time for Shelly, she’s in college, busy banging guys and carrying on the futile dieting tradition passed on from mother to daughter, hating her body, but trying to live her life. When she gets fired from her job (or a series of jobs, as per the book) after college, she’s forced to move back home with her parents, who clearly hate one another, and her sister, who has developed a serious eating disorder while she was away. Shelly is seen as the “perfect” sister, so there’s at least a little animosity there, but Frannie still stands up to their mother for Shelly when Evil Dieting Mom tries to convince Shelly not to admit herself to the hospital, and visits her sister often while she’s on the ED unit, even getting to know some of the Wild And Crazy Nut House Inmates! ™ during said visits — one of these visits even includes a scene of celebratory dancing and singing with Frannie and the hospital inmates.\n\nThe movie goes back and forth between Frannie’s shitty love life, haphazard attempts to find work, family drama (is Evil Mom cheating on Dad in Constant Denial?), and visits to see her Shelly while she’s locked up in the eating disorder unit. There are more subtle as a brick to the face references to Pro Anorexia, as well as other shenanigans on the ward — the girls photocopying some Molotov cocktail of a laxative recipe to pass around, for example, as well as Shelly mentioning that the girls on the ward sneak in laxatives, diet pills, etc — by the way, points for somewhat realism when it comes to the ED unit and the shit the girls get away with.\n\nFull disclosure: in the past I’ve spent time in such programs and yes, the patients did get away with quite a lot of shit at times. ED behaviour runs rampant even while people are hospitalized and patients do sometimes share tips, etc. Not a great environment when you’re trying to get help, to say the least.\n\nAt one point we find out that Shelly has been cutting herself in a very dramatic “accidental” slip where her sleeves rise up to reveal cuts on her arms, and her sister understandably freaks out. Most of the movie is Frannie trying to help Shelly, including taking her out on a pass from the hospital to eat lunch at a diner — which is disastrous — but also trying to get her own shit together. Until disaster strikes.\n\nShelly is finally allowed out of the bin and comes home, but nothing has really fucking changed. Her parents are still a mess, her mother is still a controlling, weight obsessed bitch who tries to steal her daughter’s limelight, and Frannie makes snide remarks about Shelly being “super woman” at the dinner table, because she’s sick of feeling inferior to her, I guess. It’s a shit show, to say the least, which ends horribly.\n\nWhen Frannie goes into Shelly’s room later on that night to apologize for her “super woman” comment, she realizes something is very, very wrong. Shelly is completely unconscious and has overdosed on their mother’s Valium. Frannie tries to shake her sister awake but fails and screams for help. Her mother and father rush into the room and her dad goes into emergency mode, telling them to call 911 and trying to give Shelly mouth to mouth while his wife freaks out crying and begging him to make her breathe. It’s quite harrowing.\n\nShelly is taken to the hospital and before we know it, she goes from being in a coma to, well, dead. Due to the damage her eating disorder had done to her body, she just wasn’t able to bounce back from the overdose.\n\nBut that isn’t even the end of the movie! Oh, no, we get to watch as Frannie’s life completely spirals after the death of her sister. Her mother leaves her father, and Frannie, who is still living at home, goes into a huge depression — barely eating in spite of her father’s urging, snapping at her best friend for not being her sister, experimenting with purging — until her father catches her and there is a very touching scene where at first he just turns away from the scene and closes the bathroom door, but then changes his mind, snaps out of his denial and goes back, telling her he won’t go through this again, he won’t watch another daughter kill herself.\n\nHer father is having a hell of a time, too, as evidenced when he has a bit of a breakdown while grocery shopping with Frannie and starts pouring his heart out to the check out clerk about his daughter who died. Frannie tells him after that he doesn’t have to be embarrassed or ashamed (something along those lines) about what happened and he assures her that he isn’t ashamed of his feelings, it’s Frannie herself who is.\n\nFrannie goes through some of Shelly’s belongings and finds a letter from one of her sister’s pals on the ED unit that includes a list of Pro Anorexia sites. She checks the links out on Shelly’s old computer, freaks out and prints a bunch of stuff off, bringing it in to her sister’s former therapist as well as the girls Shelly knew in the hospital (who are still there) and giving EVERYONE shit for killing her sister, or at least not stopping her from killing herself. We get a speech on the evils of encouraging eating disorders (no shit).\n\nAt last, Frannie starts volunteering at the old folk’s home where her grandfather lives and her life starts to turn around. Her father gets back into the dating game, her mother has her own place and starts settling the fuck down. Frannie meets a guy who is the grandson of her grandfather’s roommate and they start dating. There are some bumps along the road, but things finally start going well in Frannie’s life. The movie ends with Frannie and her parents going to Shelly’s grave and Frannie saying a little speech to her sister’s headstone.\n\nThis movie is quite a wild ride. I’m writing this mostly from memory, since I haven’t seen it in it’s entirety years, but I have watched it a number of times and have read the book, which has the same name, multiple times as well. The acting isn’t always the greatest but Susan May Pratt and Christina Hendricks actually do a pretty bang up job working within the emotional framework of the subject matter — for example, Susan spends the majority of the movie breaking down and crying and is very convincing, and Christina does a good job of seeming concerned, bewildered, sarcastic, etc. The script has it’s definite cheesy moments, and the Pro Anorexia subplot was obviously inserted last minute due to the timing of when the film was made and various news sources doing breaking stories on “The Underground Cult of Pro Anorexia Websites Destroying Our Youth” and what have you.\n\nAll that said, the movie has some damned good moments, there are some scenes that are very touching and heart wrenching and I felt that the subject matter was dealt with in a fairly realistic fashion, especially considering the made for tv movie format. It’s certainly 100 times better and more realistic than, say, Starving in Suburbia, the absolute shit show of a lifetime movie that made eating disorders look more like demon possession. So A+ for being miles better than Starving in Suburbia in retrospect and bonus points for handling the really hard subject matter (eating disorders, self harm, suicide) in a pretty sensitive and somewhat accurate manner. The production company really lucked out though, since the book by Jillian Medoff is responsible for the mostly realistic dialogue, and Christina and Susan really did pretty damned good job with the material.\n\nNote: I may be completely off when I say the movie was pretty good, because I’ve seen so many absolute SHIT made for tv movies recently that have set the bar for excellence really damned low. You will have to watch and see for yourself if watching these movies has warped my mind to the point where I think even absolute trash is high quality cinema.\n\nNotable Quotes:\n\nFrannie (narration): “In our family, fat assumed a meaning as deadly as cancer. Getting fat was worse than losing your job, worse than being jilted at the alter, worse than growing up in a trailer park with no shoes.”\n\nYoung Frannie (waiting to get weighed at a Weight Watchers style group): “Mom, where does all the fat go when we lose it? Mom, where does it go?”\n\nMother (whispering, points to another woman): “It goes on her.”\n\nHigh School Frannie (to her reflection, after tallying up what she’d eaten that day): “You’re a fat pig. You don’t get to eat anything tomorrow. I hate you, you fat pig.”\n\nFrannie (horrified, to Shelly, after hearing her purge): “Did you just make yourself throw up?”\n\nShelly: “It takes discipline to be thin.”\n\nFrannie (at a family meeting before Shelly is admitted to hospital, after her mother has given a laundry list of reasons why Shelly shouldn’t go into treatment): “If Shelly feels she needs to check into a hospital then she should, end of story.”\n\nMother: “She should be with people who love her.”\n\nFrannie: “And is forcing us to go on diets and talking about it all the time and getting furious if we gain a pound, is that loving her?”\n\nMother (to Shelly’s shrink): “I was very overweight as a child, my mother fed me too much because, well, for her that was showing love. I tried to teach my girls that food’s not a substitute for love. I did what I thought was best and I won’t apologize for it.”\n\nShelly: “I just want them to understand that I didn’t mean this to happen.”\n\nMother: “We know honey, that’s why you should be home with us.”\n\nShelly (furiously shakes her head, choked up): “That’s not what I meant.”\n\nTherapist: “Right now we want to stop Shelly’s weight loss, then we’ll decide her next step. If you really want to help Shelly, you’ll support her decision.”\n\nMother: “She’s my child and I want her home. She’ll go into a mental hospital over my dead body.”\n\nShelly (crying): “Bang, bang. You’re dead.”\n\nMother (visiting Shelly in the hospital with Frannie): “Do they monitor you in here?”\n\nShelly: “People sneak laxatives, diet pills, caffeine pills, some girl even drank detergent. She couldn’t stop vomiting, but she lost a pound, so, I guess she thought it was worth it.”\n\nMother: “Would…would you feel it was worth it?”\n\nShelly: “Why do you always ask questions that you think are so probing but are actually moronic?”\n\nMother (while visiting Shelly, after she’s left the room to get meds): “I hate hospitals, this place makes me so depressed.”\n\nFrannie: “Makes you depressed? Think about how Shelly feels.”\n\nFrannie (narration, about the state of her life): “My little sister had checked herself into a mental hospital, and I was doing exactly what was expected of me: nothing.”\n\nMother (while she and Frannie are grocery shopping, Frannie is just about to put ice cream in the cart after confronting her mother about flirting with one of her co-workers): “Ice cream?” (yanks it from her hands and puts it back) “Frannie, your father and I have been married 27 years.”\n\nFrannie (takes the ice cream back out of the freezer): “I hope that means something to your marriage counselor, I found the card mom, when were you going to tell me?”\n\nMother (reaches to take the ice cream out of her daughter’s hand a second time): “You’re just like my sister, nosey and critical.”\n\nFrannie (as she and her mom both try to wrestle the ice cream away from one another): “Are you going to leave dad for Daniel? I think I have the right o know.” (ice cream falls and hits the floor of the aisle)\n\nMother: “Frannie stop it, just stop it. I’m not having an affair with Daniel.”\n\nFrannie: “I’m sorry mom, let’s just get some low-fat yogurt.” (takes low-fat yogurt out of freezer)\n\nMother (grabs the low-fat yogurt angrily and shoves it back in the display, reaching for the ice cream instead, dumping it into the cart): “What the hell?” (walks the fuck off)\n\nFrannie (to Shelly on the phone): “You know something, Shell? I’m proud of you. I think it takes a lot of courage to do what you’re doing.”\n\nShelly: “I can’t believe you said that, that’s so nice.”\n\nFrannie (almost laughing): “Yeah, it was nice. Well, you’re my sister, the only one I’ve got.”\n\nShelly: “I want us to be true friends, Frannie, like real sisters.”\n\nFrannie: “Me too.”\n\nFrannie (finding out her grandfather is being put in a nursing home): “I see a pattern here, everyone around me gets institutionalized.
