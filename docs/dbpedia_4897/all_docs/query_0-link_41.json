        "text": "This book is a gem of a recipe book/memoir but more importantly, it’s a tale of survival, grit, and integrity. Chantha is from Cambodia. She was the child of a middle class family whose father owned an auto shop and whose mother was a housewife who was a hard worker and an excellent cook. Chantha lived a blessed life until she was nine. She was the youngest child and soft by her own admission. She attended Catholic school and spoke French. Her older sister also worked in the home and took care of the family alongside her mother.\n\nSadly, when Chantha was nine, horrible changes came to Cambodia with the rise of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Her whole life was turned upside down. For many years. Decades even.\n\nShe lost her father to a stomach ailment. The family fled to Saigon and lived there for a while. Some went right away and some delayed their trip for a while, until what was left of the family was reunited. Eventually, things fell apart in Saigon as they had in Cambodia. This area of the world was quite volatile in that decade and Chantha was caught in the middle of it. When Saigon became unsafe, the wandering years began for Chantha.\n\nThis memoir is heartbreaking in many ways but is also a tale of one woman’s resilience and how she found her way to success and a happy life. She made harrowing escapes from some situations and almost starved to death on many occasions. But through it all, she kept hope in her heart for the most part—She did have a few moments of despair, but soldiered on. She also made her own way on the world from the pampered young daughter who thought she had no skills to the tough woman who worked as a cook in a brothel, worked as a suture sewer in a refugee camp and worked other occupations to keep herself and her companion alive. She also studied English and worked for Doctors without Borders to help bring relief to the people around her.\n\nIn each chapter there are recipes she either recalled from her mother and sister or she created herself with the ingredients to hand in the hard times.\n\nAlso in the book she shows the reader the sense of humor she kept throughout her life in some “recipes” that are more like humorous comments about life and her experiences.\n\nOverall, this book is sometimes hard to read due to the privations this lady endured, but it is ultimately a story of one woman’s ability to hold strong and make her way in the world when she was left all on her own by the vagaries of fate.\n\nBy the time the reader gets to the end, one can’t help but be proud of this lady and all she has accomplished in life. And the recipes are well worth the price of the book. This is truly a great read that makes the reader think about how much people can endure and still come out on the other side as a whole and fulfilled person.\n\nBLURB:\n\nTake a well-fed nine-year-old with a big family and a fancy education. Fold in 2 revolutions, 2 civil wars, and 1 wholesale extermination. Subtract a reliable source of food, life savings, and family members, until all are gone. Shave down childhood dreams for approximately two decades, until only subsistence remains. In Slow Noodles, Chantha Nguon recounts her life as a Cambodian refugee who loses everything and everyone–her home, her family, her country–all but the remembered tastes and aromas of her mother’s kitchen. She summons the quiet rhythms of 1960s Battambang, her provincial hometown, before the dictator Pol Pot tore her country apart and killed more than a million Cambodians, many of them ethnic Vietnamese like Nguon and her family. Then, as an immigrant in Saigon, Nguon loses her mother, brothers, and sister and eventually flees to a refugee camp in Thailand. For two decades in exile, she survives by cooking in a brothel, serving drinks in a nightclub, making and selling street food, becoming a suture nurse, and weaving silk. Nguon’s irrepressible spirit and determination come through in this lyrical memoir that includes more than twenty family recipes such as sour chicken-lime soup, green papaya pickles, and p t de foie, as well as Khmer curries, stir-fries, and handmade b nh canh noodles. Through it all, re-creating the dishes from her childhood becomes an act of resistance, of reclaiming her place in the world, of upholding the values the Khmer Rouge sought to destroy, and of honoring the memory of her beloved mother, whose “slow noodles” approach to healing and cooking prioritized time and care over expediency. Slow Noodles is an inspiring testament to the power of food to keep alive a refugee’s connection to her past and spark hope for a beautiful life.\n\nThis book was quite clever in its premise and execution. It’s set up like a documentary series about a cold case involving the murder of the stepfather of one of the filmmakers.\n\nThe story is set up as a series of production notes, articles about the murder, and interviews on camera with various people who have information about the case. The filmmaker is in the background for most of it, but appears a few times to set the scene for the people on the program.\n\nThe other characters are various professionals who have experience as either law enforcement, journalists, or other crime backgrounds. We have a retired detective inspector, a criminal prosecutor, a journalist, forensic psychologist, crime scene investigator, a retired NYPD detective as well as the producer of the show and the filmmaker with his two sisters.\n\nNewspaper articles, text messages, emails, true crime aficionados in message forums, and dialogue in the documentary make up the majority of the book. There are no chapters per se and this is a fun way for the reader to get the story and try to figure out the clues as well as who may have something to hide.\n\nI loved this book and the way it was presented. It was unique and enjoyable. I did figure out who did it but I usually do. The ride to get to the solution is what I enjoy and this one was an intriguing one. While I did figure out whodunit, I was wrong on the why dun it. LOL\n\nThe presentation of this story was ingenious and original. I really enjoyed it.\n\nBLURB:\n\nIt was a case that gripped the nation. In December 2003, Luke Ryder, the stepfather of acclaimed filmmaker Guy Howard (then aged 10), was found dead in the garden of their suburban family home.\n\nLuke Ryder’s murder has never been solved. Guy Howard’s mother and two sisters were in the house at the time of the murder—but all swear they saw nothing. Despite a high-profile police investigation and endless media attention, no suspect was ever charged.\n\nBut some murder cases are simply too big to forget…\n\nNow comes the sensational new streaming series Infamous, dedicated to investigating—and perhaps cracking—this famous cold case. Years later a group of experts re-examine the evidence – with shocking results. Does the team know more than they’ve been letting on?\n\nTrue crime lovers and savvy readers, you can review the evidence and testimony at the same time as the experts. But can you solve the case before they do?\n\nThe story starts with a 14 year old missing girl in 1956 in Iceland. She was working for a couple on a small, uninhabited island off the coast of Reykjavik. When she fails to check in with her weekly call to her parents, a police detective is called out to investigate what may have happened to her. Unfortunately, the case goes cold and many years pass.\n\nEvery ten years or so, articles are in the paper about the girl who disappeared. And questions asked about where she could be. Is she dead or did she run away?\n\nThe book then flashes forward to thirty years later to a young journalist who is determined to solve the mystery. His poking into the situation happens to coincide with the two-hundredth anniversary of the city of Reykjavik.\n\nAs the young man investigates, someone starts sending him messages that lead him to believe he might be able to solve the mystery once and for all. He hopes his career will be cemented as a serious journalist if he can do so.\n\nExcitement ramps up for the reader as well as the journalist at this point.\n\nI love these type mysteries—set in Scandinavian or Nordic places. I like to watch the ones on streaming services as well. It seems the way Nordic and Scandinavian writers craft their tales have an appeal that speaks to me. I’m always quick to grab these off the shelf in the bookstore. Their mysteries pull me in. And the descriptions of their harsh winter climates are very evocative and lend themselves to a greater sense of urgency and mystique. This one was no exception.\n\nWell written with a great plot by a team that includes a bestselling Icelandic author and the prime minister of Iceland, I recommend this one for a cold winter’s day of reading and mystery.\n\nBLURB:\n\nWhat happened to Lára?\n\nIceland, 1956. Fourteen-year-old Lára decides to spend the summer working for a couple on the small island of Videy, just off the coast of Reykjavík. In early August, the girl disappears without a trace. Time passes, and the mystery becomes Iceland‘s most infamous unsolved case. What happened to the young girl? Is she still alive? Did she leave the island, or did something happen to her there?\n\nThirty years later, as the city of Reykjavík celebrates its 200th anniversary, journalist Valur Robertsson begins his own investigation into Lára’s case. But as he draws closer to discovering the secret, and with the eyes of Reykjavík upon him, it soon becomes clear that Lára’s disappearance is a mystery that someone will stop at nothing to keep unsolved . . .\n\nThis book is a wow. I loved it. Great mystery and an enjoyable read.\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of Daisy. Her grandmother is a children’s book author who owns a house on the coast of Cornwall separated by a spit of land from the mainland. For many hours each night, the small island where the house is located is inaccessible as the high tide of the Atlantic Ocean cuts off the path onto the island.\n\nA tarot reader from Land’s End predicted Daisy’s grandmother’s death in her 80th year. The book takes place on October 30 and 31st and the 31st is the grandmother’s 80th birthday.\n\nGrandmother invites all her family to the house for the birthday celebrations. Her son, an orchestra conductor, her former daughter in law, a failed actress, Rose- the veterinarian daughter, Lily- the daughter who has never worked and is rude and self-obsessed. The great granddaughter named Trixie is fifteen. And Daisy is there as well.\n\nAlso invited is a young man, Conor, who was a childhood friend of the three grandchildren, Rose, Lily and Daisy.\n\nThe set-up of this story is much like the Agatha Christie book “And Then There Were None.” Isolated setting, people who mostly don’t have much to do with each other and some who actively are unkind to each other, a cast of characters who all arouse suspicion, and, of course, the requisite murders.\n\nSome fun quirks of the story are that the grandmother has 80 clocks in the hallway that all go off every hour. She also has a time clock like is used with employees and she gets her guests to clock in and clock out when they visit.\n\nI really enjoyed this one. Lots of twists and turns. There are some flashbacks to the childhoods of the granddaughters and they tie into the plot nicely.\n\nI’m usually good at figuring these books out and I’m happy to say, other than a few small things, I didn’t on this one. Maybe that’s a big reason I enjoyed it so much (it was a bit of a Deus ex machina resolution though) Besides the great writing and building of suspense throughout the tale. Highly recommended to the point I encourage you to drop what you’re doing and dash out to the store a get a copy post-haste.\n\nBLURB:\n\nDaisy Darker was born with a broken heart. Now after years of avoiding each other, Daisy Darker’s entire family is assembling for Nana’s 80th birthday party in her crumbling gothic house on a tiny tidal island. The family arrives, each of them harboring secrets. When the tide comes in, they will be cut off from the rest of the world for eight hours.\n\nBut at the stroke of midnight, as a storm rages, Nana is found dead. And an hour later, the next family member follows…\n\nTrapped on an island where someone is killing them one by one, the Darkers must reckon with their present mystery as well as their past secrets, before the tide goes out and all is revealed. As seen on the TODAY show and picked by Book of the Month, Daisy Darker’s family secrets and Alice Feeney’s trademark shocking twists will keep readers riveted.\n\nI received a copy of the book from Kensington Publishing in exchange for a fair review. It’s a contemporary romance. Or more accurately, it’s a rom-com. And it definitely deliveries on the comedy part as well as the romance. It’s one of the type of the genre I like. I’m not a huge fan of romances that have manufactured conflict and this book definitely has some great conflicts between not only the heroine and hero but also with a number of other characters in the story. It made for a rich tale with a lot of drama as well as a lot of fun.\n\nThe heroine, Kate, has a pet dog, named Eric of all things, who adds to the scenes he’s in and is a great character himself. He also helps to move the story along.\n\nKate, a marketing manager, has her life turned upside down when she catches her fiancé in his office in a compromising position. This situation finds her deciding to get drunk to drown her sorrows. While in that state, she posts some damning things on line about her fiancé. Plot twist: His law firm just happens to be one of the largest clients of her employer.\n\nAfter losing her job, she takes another at an isolated, off the grid resort. A place that’s deep in the woods and is in desperate need of renovations. Never mind it’s soon going to be the off season and her task is to attract more business as occupancy of the resort drops dramatically in the winter months.\n\nAn almost impossible task, an office that’s woefully inadequate, and a cabin that’s hard to heat add to Kate’s woes and problems. While most of the other employees are friendly and approachable, there are a few who aren’t.\n\nThe stage is set for a lot of drama as well as humor.\n\nThe author is very witty and the dialogue —both the heroine’s internal thoughts and the interactions between her and the other characters—are well done and keep the story moving at a nice clip.\n\nI enjoyed this fun read and hope for more from this writer as this was her debut. The underlying message of belief in self and redemption from mistakes made is served up in fine fashion.\n\nBLURB:\n\nThe morning after a humiliating post-breakup social media post (#sponsoredbywine), Kate Rigsby learns she’s lost her marketing job along with her almost-fiancé. Worse, she realizes how little she truly cared about either. Craving a reset, Kate flees the big-city life she spent many years building—and almost as many doubting—to take a temporary gig at Treetops, a swanky, off-the-grid creative retreat in Muskoka, complete with meditation circles, deluxe spa, and artisanal cocktails. At least, that’s what the brochure promises . . .\n\nThe reality is a struggling resort that’s stuck in the 1990s, fax machine included. Kate’s office is a bunker, her boss is a nightmare, and at night she shares a freezing hut with her seventy-pound Goldendoodle. Then there’s the sexy, off-limits coworker whose easy smile and lumberjack forearms are distracting Kate from the already near-impossible task of making this snowbound oasis profitable.\n\nOn the upside, the surroundings are breathtaking. The Treetops crew is quirky and (mostly) kind. And somehow, Kate’s starting to feel new enthusiasm for her career—and her life. In fact, she’s daring to challenge herself in ways she never dreamed of before.\n\nWith wit and heart, Reasonable Adults explores the crossroads we all face—and how a detour born of disaster can take us just where we need to go.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for the copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review.\n\nJolene Garcia is a reporter for a television station who is sent to a radio station to cover the scene of a death of one of their talk radio hosts. Jolene is ambitious and wants to get the scoop on the story.\n\nWhen another reporter, one who scooped her on an Emmy award the year before, grabs an interview with the man everyone wants to talk to and the same woman later breaks the news that there might be poison involved, Jolene is on an even more urgent quest to get the story first.\n\nInitially, I liked Jolene as she seemed klutzy and quirky. As the book went on, I started to dislike her. She was definitely ambitious and didn’t hesitate to be unkind or rude when she was stressed or jealous. Her back story explained some of her behavior but her alienation of colleagues and friends was annoying and made her dislikable.\n\nThe story itself was great. Lots of mystery and wondering how the talk show host died. A plethora of suspects were woven into the story and made the book fully rounded and a good read.\n\nThe obligatory detective friend who gets annoyed at the amateur sleuth and the obligatory bone-headed move by the same amateur sleuth was true to the tropes of the genre.\n\nOverall, I liked the story and it was well worth the read. I just wish the protagonist was a bit more pleasant and a little less jealous and unkind.\n\nThree and a half stars.\n\nThis is a follow up book from Bloomsbury Girls which I read and reviewed for Rosie’s Book Review team. I appreciate St. Martin’s Press and NetGalley for providing an ARC copy of this book for me to read and review.\n\nThe story is set in the 1950s and is the continuation of the life of one of the women who worked at the bookstore in Bloomsbury, London. Vivien, in addition to working in the store, is also a playwright and chose to leave for Italy for a period of time when her success as a playwright was called into question. She took a job working at a film studio in Rome and worked on rewriting some of the screenplays being filmed there. Rome is still recovering from WWII and all the various issues that time period caused in Italy.\n\nWhile there, she has to deal with the censorship of the Vatican as they have full control of what is acceptable or not in what film audiences are allowed to see.\n\nVivien also meets some interesting people and forms friendships with them. As well, she forms a romantic entanglement with an older man.\n\nThe story is richly layered with individual characters who are uniquely drawn and have multi-faceted personalities.\n\nVivien is a character we grew to admire in Bloomsbury Girls and this book finds this reader still rooting for her and hoping she gets resolution of a matter that has haunted her since the war. One of the young men she meets while working at the studio also has an interesting story line about events that happened to him during the war. Both of them were characters this reader grew attached to and hoped for the best outcome.\n\nThe author is very talented and the prose is beautifully written. The flow of the story is well done as well. This book does not have to be read after Bloomsbury Girls as the story is complete without it being necessary to know the events of the other book. Some of the characters are recurring, but it’s not vital to know those back stories. I do love how real life famous people are woven into the tale. Sophia Loren and Ava Gardner even make appearances. Such fun to addition to the story.\n\nA lovely read.\n\nWhat a fun book this was. I read it on a car trip back in September and kept thinking I’d already reviewed it when I realized the other day that I hadn’t posted the review. I did receive this book from Kensington Publishing in exchange for an unbiased review. I thoroughly enjoyed it as a light read that made a long car ride very enjoyable.\n\nWhen your first date with someone ends in a prophecy about you as well as the death of an old lady, you wonder what else might go wrong in the potential relationship. No matter how interesting the date was, is there an inherent risk in trying to go out again with this person?\n\nThis book was written by a husband and wife team. The husband was a real life child star and was one of the two brothers in the Pete and Pete show that was popular on Nickelodeon Channel. The male protagonist in the story was also a child star and that forms part of the challenges he has in the dating world. Wondering if he’s liked for himself or for his former role and fame. His older brother is a big movie star now and our hero, Rudy, also has some angst about that success of his brother—making for an edgy relationship between them.\n\nThe female protagonist, Lucy, is witty, klutzy, and has a plethora of crazy date stories and failures. She works at odd jobs which find her in all kinds of scrapes. I have to confess, I wasn’t too sure about this book in the first chapter as she seemed so over the top and silly. I wasn’t convinced I was going to like her but I pushed on and, after Chapter one, I found her to be quite a charming character and someone I could root for.\n\nThis was such a cute story and read. It also had some deep messages about forgiveness and finding ways to make life work when expectations don’t quite come to fruition.\n\nHumorous and engaging, yet full of wisdom. I recommend this one."
