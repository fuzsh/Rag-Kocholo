        "text": "I love cucumbers. Refrigerator pickles? A critical kitchen necessity. Chinese cucumber stir fry? A simple but surprising triumph. Tzatziki on everything? One of my greatest joys.\n\nAlas, my love is but a feeble ember next to Logan Moffitt‚Äôs roaring flame. He loves cucumbers. He lives cucumbers. And, if you are what you eat, he is cucumbers.\n\nIn the first of his mesmerizing cucumber salads to go viral, he begins by saying, ‚ÄúSometimes you need to eat an entire cucumber,‚Äù and then proceeds to mandoline-slice a whole English seedless into a quart container.\n\nHe adds his favored ingredients: soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, green onions, sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and ‚ÄúMSG, obviously.‚Äù Then he shakes it up, and slurps it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy and delicious,‚Äù he says.\n\nMoffitt describes himself as ‚Äúaddicted,‚Äù but the internet might love his videos even more than he loves cucumbers; every single one of his dozens of takes has view counts in the millions. The current most popular, with over 20 million views, is one he compares to a New York smoked salmon-avocado bagel. You‚Äôll hear his signature deadpan refrain ‚Äî ‚ÄúStart by slicing your entire cucumber,‚Äù all the way through to ‚Äúsome MSG, obviously.‚Äù\n\nAs much as viewers enjoy watching, it sounds like they‚Äôre enjoying tasting, too. In another viral combo with peanut butter, soy sauce, chili crunch, rice wine vinegar, garlic, sesame and MSG, one commenter says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like cucumbers but I find myself craving it bc of these videos.‚Äù Another is excited to report that she ‚Äújust bought 5 cucumbers bc of you,‚Äù to which Moffitt quips back, ‚ÄúYou need more than 5.‚Äù Part of the ritual is his enthusiastic and infectious, ‚ÄúMmmm!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI went to buy msg on Amazon and the ‚Äòfrequently bought together‚Äô product was a mandolin slicerü§£,‚Äù reports one commenter on his ‚ÄúCucumber is brat‚Äù feta salad.\n\n‚ÄúDo you think he bought a math problem amount of cucumbers and his fridge is just like full of them,‚Äù wonders another, on a soy-sesame original redux video.\n\nOne of the things that puts a lot of commenters over the edge is his frequent exhortation to drink any remaining dressing ‚Äî with a straw ‚Äî so you might be wondering about whether he‚Äôs serious. Some of his narrative consists of inside jokes, and he is definitely in on them, but I think this is true love.\n\nWhen I caught up with native Ottawan and recent communications grad Moffitt, he said it‚Äôs a lifelong affair for him, one he has eaten near daily since childhood.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt post much about it until I realized how large the cucumber community was and how many people related to how I feel about cucumbers,‚Äù he explains. Still, he‚Äôs as perplexed about the interest as anyone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really understand why the videos all are so successful, but I‚Äôm glad they are, because I enjoy making them, and I‚Äôm glad to provide viewers with an interesting, fun and healthy snack to have.‚Äù\n\nDoes he eat anything else? Sure ‚Äî entire onions, entire blocks of tofu and cereal ‚Äî specifically, cucumber cereal.\n\nOK, that‚Äôs a bit of hyperbole. Moffitt is actually an adventurous eater and home cook, attributing some of his skills to watching another longtime favorite, Korean food maven and YouTube star Maangchi. His first cucumber salad bears more than a passing resemblance to her Spicy Cucumber Salad (oi-muchim), and he told me he has been watching her videos and cooking her recipes for his family for years.\n\n‚ÄúAs my passion slowly turned into my work,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thankful to say I‚Äôve been able to go to South Korea and experience the culture for myself.‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs try it! Given my personal ranch and tzatziki proclivities, I‚Äôm going to test another of his most viral: a ‚Äúcreamy cucumber‚Äù version with full-fat, plain skyr (Icelandic-style yogurt), ranch dressing mix, lemon, fresh dill, some pepperoncini brine ‚Ä¶ and MSG, obviously. Garlic and green onions are optional. Since I don‚Äôt love cucumbers quite as much as Moffitt does, I‚Äôm just going to make half of this monstrous cucurbit in a smaller container so that I can try another recipe, too.\n\nMoffitt suggests using English cucumbers, which have a thinner, more tender skin and less prominent seeds, which is what makes them ‚Äúburpless.‚Äù He says he cuts the cucumber on the second mandoline setting directly into the container, but he has the dexterity of youth and the skills of long experience, so consider using a cut-resistant glove and the mandoline‚Äôs own catch bowl if (like me) you‚Äôre not as confident. You can also slice thinly with a knife. Then, shake, shake, shake! It might look like it‚Äôs too full to mix, but Moffitt has proof of his chosen technique here. (Pro-tip: hold the lid tightly when shaking to prevent spatters.)\n\nIt‚Äôs delicious! But I found I personally enjoyed it more after letting the flavors meld in the fridge for a couple of hours. It does soften the texture, but I think the more flavorful effect is worth it; your mileage may vary. (I also liked the more tzatziki-like, dressing mix-free version.)\n\nWith the second half, I made his original version, where the MSG really earns its stripes, in my opinion.\n\nA lot of commenters wonder whether you have to add the MSG (monosodium glutamate). I tasted with and without, and it definitely kicks up the flavors. Unless you personally are sensitive to it, it won‚Äôt hurt you to add it, and you might find its umami booster lets you use less salt overall, but you can leave it out if you‚Äôd prefer.\n\nAlthough I was all out of the regular cukes, I still had some mini ones, and the soy-peanut butter recipe that has commenters buying cucumbers by the bushel was haunting my dreams. I tried slicing one on the thinnest setting and shook it with one-third of the amounts shown. I personally liked it best this way; the different cucumber surface-to-sauce ratio makes the dish more highly flavorful and softer-textured.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm impressed with myself,‚Äù he says in that video, and since I ate the whole thing for breakfast standing over the sink, so am I.\n\nLogan Moffitt‚Äôs Viral Creamy Cucumber Salad\n\nIngredients\n\n1 whole English cucumber, sliced on mandoline setting 2\n\n1/3 cup full-fat, plain Icelandic-style yogurt (skyr)\n\njuice of half a lemon\n\n2 tablespoons pepperoncini brine\n\n1/2 packet ranch dressing mix\n\n1 dill frond, snipped\n\n1/2 teaspoon MSG\n\n1 clove garlic, microplaned (optional)\n\n2 green onions, snipped into short sections (optional)\n\nPreparation"
