        "text": "The Luso World Cinema Blogathon is an annual event hosted by Spellbound with Beth Ann and Critica Retro. I’ll admit that I didn’t know anything about Luso cinema, in fact, I didn’t know what “Luso” meant. Research revealed that “Luso” is a prefix used in relation to Portugal and Portuguese culture. From reading through the list of actors/actresses of Portuguese heritage, I learned that one of my favorites, Mary Astor, fits this description.\n\nMary Astor was born Lucile Vasconcellos Langhanke in Quincy, Illinois on May 3, 1906. Her father was German and her mother was American. Mary got her Portuguese heritage from her mother. Mary was homeschooled by her mother until 1919 when she sent a photo of herself to a beauty contest and became a semi-finalist. When she was 15, she began taking drama lessons and appearing in local productions. Mary submitted her photos to other beauty contests, eventually catching the attention of an employee at Famous Players-Lasky. She was then signed to a six-month contract at Paramount. Mary would eventually make her screen debut in 1921 at the age of 14.\n\nMary’s career in silent film had its ups and downs. In 1929, she briefly found herself out of work as her voice was deemed too deep for talkies. However, she appeared in a play with her friend Florence Eldridge (wife of Fredric March) which ended up getting her back into films. She started being cast in films again and was on her way to stardom. In 1935, Mary had an extra-marital affair and was later embroiled in a bitter custody dispute with her ex-husband. In many cases, an adulteress’ career would be over, but the scandal seemed to have little effect on her career. Mary would eventually win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1941 for her role in The Great Lie.\n\nMary Astor’s career reached its peak in the 1940s with her Oscar win and appearance in the film noir classic, The Maltese Falcon, as Brigid O’Shaugnessy. As what happened with a lot of actresses back then, as soon as Mary hit 40 she was seen as a “mother” figure and was often cast in more matronly roles such as matriarch Anna Smith in Meet Me in St. Louis and Marmee in Little Women. Some of Astor’s best roles however come during this time when she took on against-type parts, such as playing a prostitute in Act of Violence or a madam in Desert Fury. Mary made her final appearance in 1964 in the small, but important role of Jewel Mayhew in Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte.\n\nMary Astor had a lot of great roles in her long career. Here are my top 5 favorite Mary Astor performances:\n\n#1 Dodsworth (1936). In this film, Mary plays “the other woman,” a role which typically isn’t sympathetic and is usually villainous. However, in Dodsworth, Mary’s performance as Edith Cortright and relationship with Walter Huston’s Sam Dodsworth is so beautiful that she is seen as the woman that Sam deserves. In this film, Sam and his wife Fran (Ruth Chatterton)’s daughter is all grown and married. Fran cannot accept being old enough to have a grown and married daughter. Sam retires and hopes to live a life of leisure with Fran. They’re planning on starting their retirement with an extended European vacation. While on the ocean liner, Sam meets Edith and Fran meets a young Englishman (David Niven) with whom she flirts. Sam ends up spending much of his time on the boat with Edith. While in Europe, Fran wants to be part of the jet set, spending her time living the high life while pretending to be much younger. Sam just wants to see the sights. As the Dodsworths find themselves growing apart, through a chance encounter, Sam reunites with Edith.\n\nMary’s performance in Dodsworth is very charming and sweet. She is what the film needs to offset the vain and materialistic Fran. While she is the “other woman” so to speak, Sam is such a nice guy and Fran is so awful, that we as the audience want Sam and Edith to be together.\n\n#2 The Palm Beach Story (1942). Mary Astor’s performance in this film is unlike any other part that I’ve seen her play. While she doesn’t seem like the obvious choice to appear in a Preston Sturges screwball comedy, Mary is right at home. In this film, she plays the oft-married Princess Maud Centimillia. At the start of the film, she’s on her way home to Palm Beach, FL with her latest conquest, Toto. She pulls up to the dock in her yacht and immediately wants to drop Toto for Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea). Tom is in town looking for his wife, Gerry (Claudette Colbert) who has traveled to Palm Beach from New York. While on the train to Florida, Gerry meets the Princess’ brother, John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee). John is instantly smitten with Gerry and takes her back to his home to give her a place to stay.\n\nMary Astor’s performance as the Princess is hysterical. Even though she’s taken Toto as her lover, she wants nothing to do with him as soon as she spots Joel McCrea. Her disdain for Toto is so clear and obvious, but he’s a dope and doesn’t pick up on it. The Princess constantly has to think of errands to send Toto on so she’ll go away. She’s also very funny when Gerry introduces her husband as “Captain McGlue” in an effort to hide the fact that he’s her husband. When Tom later reveals that he is not Captain McGlue, the Princess says: “Thank heaven for some things. That name!”\n\n#3 Red Dust (1933) In this film, Mary plays Barbara Willis, the wealthy wife of Gary (Gene Raymond) who is sent to oversee a rubber plantation in French Indochina. The manager of the rubber plantation is Dennis Carson (Clark Gable). Another visitor to the plantation is Vantine (Jean Harlow), a young prostitute on the lam. Vantine is instantly smitten with Dennis and he seems interested in her until he sees Barbara. Barbara is the polar opposite of Vantine. She is brunette, more classy and ladylike. In contrast, Vantine is a bleached blonde, a brash, and outspoken. Gary ends up coming down with malaria, which puts him out of commission and more importantly, away from Barbara. Dennis spends the week of Barbara’s visit seducing her until she finally succumbs to his advances. Meanwhile, Vantine looks on with intense jealousy.\n\nThis is a very sexy part for Mary Astor. She is given the chance to have the hot and heavy affair with the hunky Clark Gable. The entire film is sweaty and it feels sweaty. At one point, Barbara is caught in the rain and is drenched. She then shares a sexy kiss with Gable.\n\n#4 Midnight (1939) In this film, Mary plays the wealthy Helene Flammarion, the wife of Georges Flammrion (John Barrymore). She is very openly having an affair with ladies man, Jacques Picot (Frances Lederer). At the beginning of the film, Eve Peabody (Claudette Colbert) crashes a concert attended by members of the Parisian high society. She ends up running into Marcel Renaud (Rex O’Malley) who invites her to play bridge with himself, Helene, and Jacques. Eve introduces herself as “Madame Czerny.” Georges enters the room and sees Eve. He pretends to recognize Madame Czerny.\n\nGeorges comes up with a scheme to break up his wife and Jacques. He proposes to Eve that she try and break up Jacques and Helene. If she succeeds, Georges will give her a good payoff to reward her for her efforts. He will also give her 50,000 francs and invites her to his and Helene’s home in Versailles for the weekend. Georges also puts Eve up in a suite at the Ritz and buys her a new wardrobe, worthy of her persona as Madame Czerny. Meanwhile, cab driver Tibor Czerny (Don Ameche) is looking for Eve, having fallen in love with her while her drove her around town. When he finally finds her, he is amused that she’s taken on his surname as her fake royalty name.\n\nWhile Mary Astor is more of a side character in this film, she is very funny in her part as John Barrymore’s unfaithful wife. She has absolutely no discretion in her affair with Jacques. Mary excels in these parts playing a bit of a goody two shoes, but also classy and a bit rigid. She’s also great at delivering her lines with a bit of bitterness, cynicism, while also being very funny.\n\n#5 The Maltese Falcon (1941). This is perhaps Mary Astor’s most famous role, that of femme fatale Brigid O’Shaugnessy in John Huston’s directorial debut and Humphrey Bogart’s breakout role. In this film, Brigid introduces herself to Bogart’s Sam Spade as “Miss Wonderly,” but he soon figures out that she’s lying about her identity. She comes to Sam wanting help in finding out the whereabouts of her missing sister. All Brigid can say is that she came to town (San Francisco) with Floyd Thursby. Sam puts his associate, Miles Archer, on the case. Miles is murdered while investigating Thursby’s whereabouts.\n\nSam sets out to investigate Archer’s death, but is soon thrust into an even larger (more interesting) mystery. He goes to Brigid, now calling herself Brigid having abandoned the “Miss Wonderly” moniker, to find out more information about Thursby. Brigid confesses that she made up the story about her sister and revealed that Thursby was her partner. She also puts forth the theory that Thursby probably killed Archer. When Sam returns to his office, he encounters Joe Cairo (Peter Lorre) who is wanting help looking for a statue of a black bird.\n\nThe black bird investigation proves to be a lot more interesting, especially when it turns out that Brigid is acquainted with Joe Cairo. Sam also learns that Cairo and Brigid are part of a gang led by Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet). Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.) is Kasper’s gunsel and eventual fall guy. The ending of the film where Sam calls Brigid out and says she was responsible for Archer’s death. This is Mary Astor’s time to shine. In the scene, she is heartbroken that Sam Spade, with whom she thought she was in love, sends her up the river. She pleads with him to not turn her over to the police, but to no avail. He “consoles” her stating that she’ll probably be out in twenty years. As she descends in the elevator, Brigid’s face is covered by the shadows of bars on the windows.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: If you haven’t seen “Dark Passage,” the ending will be spoiled in this article. It is impossible to talk about Agnes Moorehead’s role in this film without discussing the ending. In a happy coincidence, “Dark Passage” is scheduled to air on TCM’s Noir Alley this Saturday, May 4th at 9:15 pm (Pacific) and on Sunday, May 5th at 7:00am (Pacific).\n\nBOB (to MADGE): Why don’t you leave people alone? You’re not satisfied unless you bother people. Either it’s your family or your friends, people you don’t know…No feelings for you. No feeling at all, except I’m annoyed whenever I see you.\n\nBruce Bennett as “Bob” and Agnes Moorehead as “Madge Rapf” in Dark Passage (1947)\n\nThis quote pretty much sums up every character in Dark Passage‘s relationship and feelings about Madge Rapf, portrayed by the brilliant Agnes Moorehead. She is the town busy body, known to everyone and liked by no one. She gets on everyone’s nerves with her persistence, suspicion, and tendency to insert herself into everyone’s business.\n\nMadge Rapf is the ultimate woman scorned.\n\nAt the start of the film, Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart, whose voice is heard, but isn’t shown until about halfway through) escapes from the notorious San Quentin prison. As the audience, we only see the events transpire from Vincent’s perspective. He is picked up by a passing motorist, who soon starts to ask too many questions and is knocked unconscious by Vincent. Another motorist, Irene Janson (Lauren Bacall) picks Vincent up and smuggles him past the police roadblock and takes him to her apartment in San Francisco. Irene explains that she followed his case closely and knew who he was when she spotted him. She further explains that her father had been falsely convicted of murder, something that she believes has also happened to Vincent. Irene states that her father’s false conviction has inspired her to take an interest in instances of injustice.\n\nHere’s where Madge comes into the story. Madge, it turns out, is acquainted with Irene and Bob (Bruce Bennett). Bob is a friend of Irene’s who wants to be romantically involved with her. How Madge knows Irene isn’t made clear, but she knows her, because she seems to know everyone. It is also revealed that Madge is well acquainted with Vincent and was the star witness at his trial. Her testimony, in which she claimed Vincent’s late wife had identified him as her killer, is what clinched his guilty verdict and placed him into a cell at San Quentin. Madge had made romantic advances toward Vincent, and when he rejected her, she delivered the false (but incriminating) testimony out of spite. She has resented Vincent ever since. When Madge hears about his escape and then thinks she hears his voice in Irene’s apartment, she becomes convinced that Vincent is going to murder her.\n\nVincent, needing to hide in plain sight from the police, takes the advice of a cab driver to visit the office of a disgraced plastic surgeon. At around 3am, Vincent arrives at the surgeon’s office and receives a “new look.” The new look is obviously the face of Humphrey Bogart, so that he can be seen in the film. There is an amusing scene earlier in the film where a photo of Vincent Parry is seen in a newspaper article. The man in the photo looks absolutely nothing like Bogart, which just goes to show how skilled the plastic surgeon is.\n\nBefore getting outfitted with a new face, Vincent had visited the apartment of his friend George, who lived near the doctor’s office. He asks George for a place to stay while he recovers from the surgery. Upon Vincent’s return, he finds George dead on the floor–a victim of murder. Vincent eventually ends up at Irene’s apartment. She assists him during his recovery and helps him with his new look and gives him a new name. Because this film stars married couple Bogie and Bacall, their respective characters start to develop romantic feelings toward one another.\n\nEventually, Vincent becomes suspicious of Madge, knowing that she has been hanging around Irene’s apartment. He also knows that she knows he’s around somewhere. Vincent shows up at Madge’s apartment to confront her over the deaths of both his wife and George. He presents a document outlining his accusations towards Madge and attempts to coerce her to sign it, which would serve as her confession. Madge refuses, knowing that without her confession, Vincent has no proof of his claims. Madge, still the woman scorned, is also upset that Vincent is in love with Irene.\n\nMADGE to VINCENT: I’ve cried myself to sleep at night because of you. She’s (Irene) got you now. She wants you very badly doesn’t she? She’s willing to run away with you and keep on running and ruin everything for herself. But she wouldn’t care because she’d be with you and that’s what she wants. Well she doesn’t have you now. She’ll never have you. Nobody will ever have you! And that’s the way I want it! You’re nothing but an escaped convict. Nobody knows what you wrote down. They’ll believe me! They’ll believe me!\n\nAgnes Moorehead as “Madge Rapf” to Humphrey Bogart as “Vincent Parry” in Dark Passage (1947)\n\nThen, in the ultimate power play of a woman scorned, Madge jumps out the window and falls to her death. Vincent has a throwaway line where he tells Irene that Madge “stumbled and fell out the window,” however, it is fairly obvious that Madge jumped on purpose. Before she falls, she is seen grabbing something from the desk, presumably something with which to break the window. Then, she jumps. The window was closed and Madge wasn’t very far from it when she “fell.” There’s no way that Madge would have stumbled with such force that she would have broken the glass. The production code prohibited villains from getting away with their crime through suicide. Presumably, including the dialogue about Madge falling out the window was the film’s way of circumventing the production code.\n\nThe ending scene of Madge’s wrath is expertly performed by Agnes Moorehead. The contempt she feels towards Bogart’s character is so well acted and is felt by the audience. I also appreciate that she’s a bit over the top so that we can safely conclude that this woman is a bit bonkers so we don’t feel too bad for her that she dies. I love movies with scenes that come out of left field. The first time I saw Dark Passage, I didn’t expect Madge to jump. With Bogart there, it seemed like shooting Madge would be the obvious solution. For her to dramatically jump out the window instead, right after her speech where she explains that she won’t do anything to help him, was incredibly shocking and awesome.\n\nLast Sunday, April 21, the 15th Annual TCM Classic Film Festival came to a close. It was an amazing 3.5 days of classic film in sunny Hollywood. As a credentialed member of the media, this is just one of a few posts I have planned chronicling my time at the festival. In this post, I thought I would provide an overview of the festival. I’m planning on following up with post with a four-part series describing my experience at the festival, including the films that my husband and I saw and our overall impressions of this year’s festivities.\n\nThursday, April 18, 2024\n\nDuring the afternoon, about four hours before the official festivities, attendees went to their first panel–So You Want to Put on a Classic Film Festival. In this panel discussion, organizers of the TCMFF past, present and future were on-hand to explain all the logistics and planning that goes into planning a festival of this magnitude. This panel replaced the traditional “Meet TCM” panel of years past.\n\nThe red carpet was rolled out on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre for the opening night film–Pulp Fiction. Almost the entire cast was expected to reunite at the festival, including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Harvey Keitel. The four main stars were scheduled to be interviewed onstage by Ben Mankiewicz prior to the screening. Aside from the stars of Pulp Fiction, other festival guests, including Floyd Norman, Mario Cantone, Cora Sue Collins, Lesley Ann Warren, Dana Delaney, and Kate Flannery also walked the carpet. George Chakiris was even present, though he did not present any films at the festival. He apparently made a cameo at the annual trivia contest, So You Think You Know Movies, hosted by frequent festival guest, Bruce Goldstein.\n\nThe opening party was held in Club TCM before attendees were off to either walk the red carpet, or to get in line for their first official events of this year’s festival. Clue (1985) with guest Lesley Ann Warren kicked off this year’s poolside festivities.\n\nFriday, April 19, 2024\n\nFriday morning brought about the return of Disney’s El Capitan Theatre to the festival. Disney Legend Floyd Norman was on-hand to discuss One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) with TCM favorite, comedian Mario Cantone. At the multiplex, Bruce Goldstein, Shane Fleming, Steve Levy, and Bob Weitz, presented six Vitaphone shorts to a sold-out crowd. The shorts were projected in 35mm with the sound played back on their original 16″ discs. The discs were placed on a turntable built by the Warner Brothers Post Production Engineering Department. Meanwhile, over at Grauman’s Chinese Theater, Jodie Foster was the subject of the hand and footprint ceremony. Foster’s friend, Jamie Lee Curtis gave a tribute before the festivities. After the ceremony, Foster introduced Silence of the Lambs, the film in which she won her second Best Actress Oscar.\n\nTCMFF favorites, Ben Burtt and Craig Barron, presented their annual sound and special effects presentation with Them! (1954). Billy Dee Williams, subject of one of this year’s tributes, was at Club TCM to discuss his decades-long career. Movie historian Leonard Maltin was present during the afternoon to present Three Godfathers (1936), and then later a silent double feature Dad’s Choice (1928) and Paths to Paradise (1925) with one of the nation’s leading silent film accompanists, Ben Model, providing the soundtrack.\n\nIn the evening, director Steven Spielberg was onstage at Grauman’s with Ben Mankiewicz to discuss the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Gidget (1959) was the featured poolside film. Later that evening, director David Fincher was on-hand to introduce the IMAX restoration of his serial killer classic, Se7en (1995).\n\nSaturday, April 20, 2024\n\nSaturday morning started off with the return of nitrate films at the newly restored Egyptian Theatre, making its triumphant return after an extended closure. Film historian Alan K. Rode introduced Edward G. Robinson in Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948). Later, the second and final nitrate of the festival, Annie Get Your Gun (1950), was presented.\n\nThe afternoon was sheer pandemonium at the TCL Chinese Multiplex with the screenings of A Little Romance (1979) with star Diane Lane, and The Big Heat (1953) with Gloria Grahame-super fan, Dana Delaney. The Mae West pre-code, She Done Him Wrong (1933) with an introduction by the hilarious Mario Cantone, was sold-out almost instantly. Those avoiding the insanity were probably over at Club TCM attending an event with makeup artist, Lois Burwell, the subject of the other tribute at this year’s festival.\n\nLater in the afternoon, film historian Donald Bogle was at the Egyptian to introduce The Mad Miss Manton (1938) with Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda, and Hattie McDaniel. After this screening, film historian Jeanine Basinger was presented with this year’s Robert Osborne Award. She also introduced Westward the Women (1951) with Robert Taylor. Meanwhile, over at Grauman’s Chinese Theater, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were onstage introducing The Shawshank Redemption (1994) for it’s 30th anniversary. Inside the multiplex, comedian and Family Guy-creator, Seth MacFarlane, helped present a series of nine Fleischer cartoons that were recently restored through his foundation. These cartoons hadn’t been seen since their debut back in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe final poolside screening of the festival was Footloose (1984) in honor of its 40th anniversary. Meanwhile over in the multiplex, members of the cast of Little Women (1994) were reuniting for the film’s 30th anniversary. Closing out the evening was Jeff Daniels at the Egyptian introducing Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Former TCM Underground programmer, Millie De Chirico, introduced the final midnight film of the festival, Heavenly Bodies (1984). Good news! This film will be released on blu ray later this year!\n\nSunday, April 21, 2024\n\nThe final day of the festival started with Fred MacMurray’s daughter, Kate, introducing Double Indemnity (1944) at Grauman’s Chinese Theater. She was also on-hand Friday morning to introduce her father in The Caine Mutiny (1954). Over at the Egyptian, cinematographer Caleb Deschanel presented a 70mm screening of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Later that afternoon, director Alexander Payne introduced a 70mm screening of John Wayne’s The Searchers (1956). Back at Grauman’s, soap opera star Kin Shriner discussed his love of TCM and the film Sabrina (1954) with Dave Karger. Over at the multiplex, 97-year old Cora Sue Collins introduced the precode, The Sin of Nora Moran (1933). Miss Collins played the child version of Greta Garbo’s character in Queen Christina (1933).\n\nDuring the festival on Sundays, a handful of timeslots are saved for repeats of films that sold out during the other days of the festival. They are labeled on the schedule as “TBA” and are typically announced Saturday afternoon. This year’s TBAs were The Big Heat (1953), The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936), The Good Fairy (1935), The Model and the Marriage Broker (1951), and Only Yesterday (1933).\n\nThe closing event of the festival was the always-hilarious 97-year old Mel Brooks. Brooks is a 7-time guest of the festival and did not disappoint. Brooks was on-hand to not answer Ben Mankiewicz’s questions and to do his own shtick. He did eventually introduce this year’s closing film, Spaceballs (1987)–a spoof of Star Wars with It Happened One Night‘s plot, with some Alien, Alice, and The Wizard of Oz sprinkled in.\n\nThe festivities were capped off with a toast by the five TCM hosts: Ben Mankiewicz, Eddie Muller, Jacqueline Stewart, Dave Karger, and Alicia Malone in Club TCM. The guests were handed glasses of champagne to toast not only the 15th anniversary of the festival, but also the 30th anniversary of TCM!\n\nHere’s to many more years of the festival and TCM!\n\nMy post for this event is coming a little early, as I am leaving for the TCM Film Festival in Hollywood tomorrow night! I wanted to make sure I got my article finished before I leave, as I probably won’t have time to do so while I’m in California. I hope to see William Holden in Sabrina while I’m at the festival, but we’ll see. But I digress, today I am not talking about Holden in Sabrina, I am talking about Holden in his breakout role in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nPrior to 1950, Holden’s career was languishing. His first starring role came in 1939’s Golden Boy, co-starring Barbara Stanwyck. Despite Stanwyck’s enormous help and use of her star power to keep Holden from being fired from the production (a kindness that Holden never forgot and repaid his gratitude by sending her flowers every year on the anniversary of Golden Boy‘s first day of production), this film did not prove to be the breakout hit Holden needed to be considered a movie star. He did appear in films with A-list actors such as Humphrey Bogart, Jean Arthur, Ray Milland, Veronica Lake, to name a few, but none of these films would provide Holden with an opportunity to breakout.\n\nAfter returning from serving in World War II, Holden was placed in a variety of smaller films, where he played what he called “smiling Jim” roles. Holden grew weary of such films and wanted something that would actually challenge his acting ability and give him a different type of role to play. He found that in 1949 when he was offered the role of Joe Gillis, a down on his luck screenwriter in Billy Wilder’s next film, Sunset Boulevard. Wilder’s first choice, Montgomery Clift, had dropped out of the film’s production. Holden wisely saw Wilder’s film as his opportunity to do something different and accepted the role.\n\nSunset Boulevard was the perfect showcase for what would become Holden’s trademark onscreen persona–the handsome and charming, yet flawed man who was cynical of the world around him. His persona is similar to Humphrey Bogart’s except that Holden was classically handsome and could charm anyone with a flash of his smile. Both Bogart and Holden’s characters were often cynical, but Bogart often imbued his performances with a vulnerable quality. Holden’s characters tended to be more heroic and called upon to do the right thing, even if he himself didn’t believe in it. In ‘Sunset,’ Holden ultimately has to do what’s right for Betty Schaefer and his friend (and her fiancé) Artie–even if it’s not what he would have wanted for himself.\n\nWilder’s film features a very unusual and somewhat macabre framing device–the story’s narrative is told by the corpse of Joe Gillis (Holden), who at the beginning of the film, is seen floating facedown in the pool at silent film star Norma Desmond’s mansion. Wilder’s previous film noir, Double Indemnity, also used a narrator who recounted the previous events leading to that moment. Except in that film, the narrator, Walter Neff, is still alive and is dictating his story into his boss’ Dictaphone. In ‘Boulevard,’ we see the lifeless frozen in time face of Gillis as he goes into his story:\n\nJOE: Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. It’s about five o’clock in the morning. That’s the homicide squad – complete with detectives and newspapermen. A murder has been reported from one of those great big houses in the ten thousand block. You’ll read about it in the late editions, I’m sure. You’ll get it over your radio and see it on television because an old-time star is involved–one of the biggest. But before you hear it all distorted and blown out of proportion, before those Hollywood columnists get their hands on it, maybe you’d like to hear the facts, the whole truth. If so, you’ve come to the right party. You see, the body of a young man was found floating in the pool of her mansion–with two shots in his back and one in his stomach. Nobody important, really. Just a movie writer with a couple of B pictures to his credit. The poor dope! He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end, he got himself a pool–only the price turned out to be a little high. Let’s go back about six months and find the day when it all started.\n\nWilliam Holden as “Joe Gillis” in Sunset Boulevard\n\nThe film then segues into the beginning of the flashback. Joe Gillis is at Paramount trying to sell a story idea he’s written, hoping that the studio will buy it and hire him to write the screenplay. A studio “reader,” Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) is already in the office talking to the studio head, advising him to turn down the story. Unfortunately for Betty, Joe overhears the conversation and is upset. Later, when returning home, Joe notices that he’s being followed by a pair of men looking to repossess his car. Trying to outrun and hide from the men, he turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion, and hides his car in the garage.\n\nJOE: Wait a minute, haven’t I seen you before? I know your face…You’re Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.\n\nNORMA: I *am* big, it’s the *pictures* that got small.\n\nWilliam Holden as “Joe Gillis” and Gloria Swanson as “Norma Desmond” in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nHowever, the mansion is not deserted! It in fact belongs to former silent film star, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Norma hasn’t made a film for over twenty years, but still believes she’s every inch the major Hollywood star. She ambles around in her cavernous mansion, filled with luxurious and expensive decor. Photographs of Norma (real photographs of Swanson during her silent film career) in her heyday are prominently placed throughout the home. Evenings are filled with Norma watching herself perform in her films. Norma is determined to make a comeback, despite hating the word “comeback.” She prefers to think of it as a “return,” a return to the millions of people who won’t forgive her for deserting the screen. Norma’s comeback is set to be a new adaptation of Salome, a script that she has written for herself.\n\nNorma’s butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim), exists solely to feed into Norma’s disillusions about her level of celebrity. He gives into her every whim, whether it’s holding a funeral for her dead monkey or organizing a New Years Eve party, complete with an orchestra, for no guests. Max to his credit, is cognizant of Norma’s mental state and takes precautions, such as removing the door knobs so that she cannot lock herself inside when she decides to harm herself. Despite how crazy and funny Norma seems on the outside, inside this is a woman who is struggling and is in desperate need of some therapy and mental help. Norma is a tragic figure in this film.\n\nHaving heard that Joe is a writer, Norma hires him to help her with her Salome script. Joe finds the writing abysmal, but with his car about to be repossessed, and his rent in arrears, he realizes that he cannot afford to turn her offer down. Norma has Max set up a room for Joe and soon he’s part of Norma’s life. Norma is ecstatic having Joe around and treats him to champagne, and invites him to engage in one of her favorite pastimes–watching her own movies.\n\nNORMA: We didn’t need dialogue. We had faces!\n\nGloria Swanson as “Norma Desmond” in Sunset Boulevard\n\nThe deserted mansion implies that Norma is a bit of a recluse. She does have some visitors, such as “the Waxworks” i.e., her silent film friends who come by once a week to play bridge. This is such a fun sequence, if only to see Buster Keaton, who was known to be an excellent bridge player. He memorably says “Pass” twice during the game. Joe’s continued presence in the home inspires Norma to have Max dust off her old car, a 1929 Isotta Fraschini. By this point, Joe’s work on Norma’s script is long done, and he continues to live with Norma, indulging her fantasies and delusions. She’s tired of Joe’s “dreadful” shirt, his boring sports jacket, and his baggy pants. Norma takes Joe shopping for a brand new wardrobe, and this is the scene that cements Joe’s new status in Norma’s life–kept man. The salesman at the men’s clothing store has a memorable line that sums up Joe’s entire situation when he’s hesitant to allow her to buy him an expensive Vicuna overcoat over the less expensive camel’s hair:\n\nSALESMAN: As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?\n\nJoe does take the Vicuna and with that starts the second act and one of the most memorable sequences in the film, Norma’s New Years Eve party. She has Max hire an orchestra, put together an enormous spread of food and champagne, everything that would make for a great party. Joe comes down the grand staircase in a beautiful tuxedo with tails and marvels at the scene. He takes Norma’s hand and while dancing, he innocently asks where the other guests are. There are no guests she exclaims, gleefully. Joe realizes that Norma has fallen in love with him. Hmm. Apparently he didn’t realize that when she bought him a brand new wardrobe? Then comes one of my favorite Norma Desmond quotes when she tries to offer Joe a New Years Eve gift:\n\nJOE: Norma, I can’t take it. You’ve bought me enough.\n\nNORMA: Shut up! I’m rich. I’m richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I’ve got a million dollars.\n\nWilliam Holden as “Joe Gillis” and Gloria Swanson as “Norma Desmond” in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nJoe eventually leaves and heads to the New Years Eve party of his friend, Artie Green (Jack Webb). As an side, I think this film is the most animated performance I’ve ever seen from Jack Webb. But I digress. Artie’s party is definitely a more raucous and less refined affair than Norma’s party for two. While at the party, Joe runs into Betty again and learns that she’s Artie’s fiancée. However, the two start talking “shop” and discussing Joe’s story idea. Betty comes up with a concept that works with Joe’s idea but changes the setting and characters’ occupation. The two seem to develop an affection for one another as they discuss Joe’s story and get excited by its potential. Eventually though, Joe has to leave and return to Norma.\n\nThis scene sets up the overall main conflict of the film: Norma’s obsession with Joe versus Joe and Betty’s burgeoning love affair. When Joe returns home from Artie’s, he learns that Norma attempted suicide over his leaving. Feeling guilty, Joe goes to Norma’s room and ends up wishing her a Happy New Years and kisses her. Talk about mixed signals.\n\nThroughout most of the remainder of the film’s running time, Joe is secretly leaving Norma’s home in the evenings and meeting up with Betty at Paramount. The two are excitedly working together on a story treatment that they hope to sell to the studio. Betty tells Joe about her dreams and past which only endears her to him. She also wants to be a screenwriter and hopes this story may earn her a promotion from reader. Joe is endeared by Betty’s youth and optimism and finds himself falling in love with her. This causes him to feel conflicted, as he doesn’t want to steal his friend’s girlfriend.\n\nJOE: How old are you anyway?\n\nBETTY: Twenty two.\n\nJOE: That’s it–there’s nothing like being twenty two. Now may I suggest that if we’re ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me…now back to the typewriter.\n\nWilliam Holden as “Joe Gillis” and Nancy Olson as “Betty Schaefer in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nNorma’s opportunity to make a “return” seems to come when she’s contacted by Gordon Cole at Paramount. He wants Norma to come down to the studio and talk about Cecil B. DeMille’s next film. Norma had Max deliver her completed draft of her Salome script to DeMille, so naturally, she thinks that Mr. Cole wants her to come down to discuss it. Norma makes her triumphant return to Paramount, despite only being allowed in because the old studio guard recognized her. When she arrives, DeMille is in the middle of shooting a scene for his next film. He has her sit down and while she waits, the lighting man recognizes her and shines a spotlight on her. Then other employees are heard in succession, saying Norma Desmond’s name. This sets up one of my favorite lines in the movie:\n\nPARAMOUNT SECURITY GUARD: Why I thought she was dead!\n\nThe final act of the film is where Norma’s obsession with Joe and Joe and Betty’s late night story writing plot lines come to a head. Norma begins to become suspicious of Joe’s late night trips. She finds out about Betty and becomes extremely jealous and telephones her over and over. Joe overhears Norma talking to Betty and interrupts the call. Knowing that he needs to end things with Betty as to not hurt Artie, he tells her to come over to Norma’s home. When he does, he essentially explains to her that he’s the kept man of Norma Desmond and runs her out of his life by pretending to brag and gloat about the lavish lifestyle he’s living with Norma. While we’re led to believe that Joe is just saying these things to drive Betty away and back to Artie, one has to wonder if he truly believes his lie. Despite thinking Norma was nuts at the beginning and just accepting what he thought would be easy money, Joe seems to enjoy his time with Norma. He lives lavishly, enjoys nice food, champagne, her pool, she has everything he wants. It’s easy to see why Norma would be in love with him. He’s young, he’s handsome, he’s charming, he has everything an aging woman would want. I could write a whole article about how Norma Desmond is truly the victim of Sunset Boulevard, despite murdering Joe. But that’s for another day.\n\nMax finds out the truth about why Paramount wanted to see Norma on the lot. It wasn’t for Salome, but rather they wanted to use her car in a film. Upon hearing the reason, Cecil B. DeMille cannot in good faith hurt Norma’s feelings and tells Gordon Cole to find another car. Once again the people in Norma’s life protect her from the truth. Joe FINALLY grows a back bone and some self-respect and decides to leave Norma’s home. Except she’s a woman scorned and she will not let him leave. While walking past the pool, Norma shoots Joe three times and he collapses, face first into the pool. That brings us back to the beginning of the film.\n\nJOE: Well this is where you came in. Here’s that pool again, the one I always wanted.\n\nWilliam Holden as “Joe Gillis” in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nNorma Desmond’s final scene in Sunset Boulevard is spectacular. The police are on the scene, ready to take Norma in for murder. Hedda Hopper is there, wanting her paper to take her story direct, live from Norma’s bedroom. Reporters with newsreel cameras, to capture Norma’s arrest are huddled around. Every one is there, except Norma’s grip on reality. Her madness has finally reached its peak. Max, no longer complicit in maintaining Norma’s fantasy life, uses her delusions of grandeur against her to lure her into the waiting police car. As Norma’s former director, Max positions himself amongst the newsreel cameras, telling Norma that they’re here to start shooting Salome.\n\nNorma’s descent down the stairs is completely surreal. As she makes her way to the bottom, everyone else in the scene remains completely still. Norma makes her way towards Max, arms reaching out towards the camera. She’s ready to make her triumphant return. Norma makes a speech about how happy she is to be back in front of the camera. She looks completely bonkers as she finally makes her way to her mark to start filming her scene. Reaching out one more time towards the camera she says in an oft-misquoted line:\n\nNORMA: All right, Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up.\n\nGloria Swanson as “Norma Desmond” in Sunset Boulevard\n\nBeware of the blob, it creeps\n\nAnd leaps and glides and slides\n\nAcross the floor\n\nRight through the door\n\nAnd all around the wall\n\nA splotch, a blotch\n\nBe careful of the blob\n\n“The Blob” performed by The Five Blobs in “The Blob” (1958)\n\nAnd so begins the greatest movie theme song of all time–the theme song to the 1958 sci-fi classic, The Blob. The theme song was written by Burt Bacharach and Mack David. Bacharach of course would later go on to win two Best Song Oscars, most notably for “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. However, for my money, “The Blob” is his best tune, an earworm so catchy that it’ll stay with you days, even weeks after watching the film. My husband and I saw this film at The Hollywood Theatre on our 11th anniversary a couple years ago. It was awesome seeing it up on the big screen.\n\nThe Blob starts out like many other 50s sci-fi films. A pair of teenagers, Steve (Steve McQueen, in his screen debut) and Jane (Aneta “Miss Crump from The Andy Griffith Show” Corsaut) are necking at lover’s lane. They see what appears to be a meteorite cascading through the sky and hear it crashing. Steve and Jane drive off to see what it was, but an old man and his dog get to it first. The old man finds the meteor and pokes it with a stick. When he does, it splits open and a mysterious bloblike creature (i.e. “the blob”) escapes and attaches itself to the man’s arm. In pain and unable to get the blob off, the man runs out into the road, nearly being hit by Steve. Steve and Jane take the man to see Dr. Hallen.\n\nDr. Hallen subdues the man with an anesthetic and sends Steve and Jane back out to the site and look for information. While Steve and Jane are gone, Dr. Hallen decides that the old man’s arm must be amputated. During this entire time, between the blob’s escape from the meteor and staying at Dr. Hallen’s, the blob has grown in size. Before Steve and Jane return, the blob fully absorbs the old man, Dr. Hallen, and his nurse Kate. This scene features a lot of delightful screaming by Kate. Screaming, while standing completely motionless and not trying to escape at all, is a common trope in 50s sci-fi. The blob grows and becomes more red with each subsequent victim.\n\nAt this point, Steve, Jane and his other “teenage” friends try to warn the police about the blob. I am not convinced that any of the teenagers in this film are actually teenagers. Steve McQueen was 28 and looks every inch of it. Aneta Corsaut was 25. I can see why McQueen wanted to avoid discussing this film. His screen debut is not flashy, it’s not a star-making role. McQueen doesn’t really do anything in this film other than warn the adults about the blob. The real star of this film is the blob. He should have gone onto bigger and better things.\n\nBut I digress. The police investigate Steve’s claims but are unable to locate the blob or any victims. They assume that Steve is playing a prank on the police and ignore his subsequent warnings. As these films tend to go, Steve and Jane have continued run-ins with the blob and find more and more victims. The police continue to ignore them until they have their own encounter and see the blob with their own eyes.\n\nIn The Blob‘s most famous sequence, one that is also featured in Grease, another film that features near-30 year olds playing teenagers, the blob is seen creeping through the vents in the projection booth of the local Colonial Theater. Steve and Jane continue to warn everyone of the danger, but to no avail. They are vindicated when the blob completely absorbs the projectionist, and then takes over the theater. The crowd flees the theater in panic, while the blob oozes through the front doors. As an aside, at the annual Blobfest in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, people can participate in a reenactment of this scene. Participants can run screaming, out of the now-restored Colonial Theater, trying to escape being consumed by the blob.\n\nAt the film’s conclusion, the now enormous blob completely absorbs a diner, complete with customers inside. The police, now finally believing Steve’s claims, try to figure out how to take the blob down before he consumes the entire town. They try to electrocute the blob, but all that accomplishes is setting a fire elsewhere. Steve notices that the blob recoils when coming in contact with the cold CO2 fire extinguisher liquid. He comes up with a plan to acquire as many fire extinguishers as possible from a variety of sources. Copious amounts of fire extinguishers in hand, the firefighters, police and students spray the blob. Now frozen, the Air Force is contacted to carry the heavy frozen blob to the Arctic. However, he’s not dead.\n\nThe best thing about this film is the blob. He’s some sort of alien that crashes to earth. His only way to stay alive is to eat people. With every person consumed, the blob grows in size and becomes more and more red. At the beginning of the film, he was a tiny blob, maybe 5″ in diameter and was semi- translucent. By the end of the film, he’s grown to gargantuan portions and is a deep deep red. I love that the film has no resolution. The blob, while frozen, is not defeated. Freezing him was a temporary solution.\n\nThe film warns that the blob will stay away as long as the Arctic stays cold. Oops. With the arctic melting, are we in danger of the blob’s imminent return? The answer is a resounding “yes,” because apparently at the aforementioned “Blobfest” in Pennsylvania, fans of the blob can meet the star of the movie, the blob himself, in person! It’s only a matter of time before he wrecks havoc again.\n\nI first saw The Birds in the 90s when I was in middle school. It was supposedly “very scary” but I didn’t find it scary in the slightest. In fact, back then and even now, I find parts of it very funny. Because of Hitchcock’s known fondness for macabre humor, it’s hard to know whether Hitchcock purposely intended for these scenes to be funny. There are also parts of this film that I find very bewildering. I also love the birds in The Birds and think that they are 100% the heroes of the film.\n\nThe Birds, based on Daphne du Maurier’s 1952 short story of the same name, starts with socialite and known party girl, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) in a San Francisco pet shop. She seems to just be browsing. The shop proprietor, Miss Inch from The Parent Trap, steps away for a second. While she’s out of earshot, lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) enters the shop looking for a pair of lovebirds for his sister Cathy’s (Veronica Cartwright) birthday. Mitch recognizes Melanie as the party girl whose picture he saw in the newspaper. It seems she had been arrested for pulling a practical joke and due to her notoriety as a raucous socialite, she made the local newspaper. Knowing that she doesn’t work at the pet shop, Mitch pretends to mistake her as an employee and asks her technical questions about birds. She tries to pretend that she knows about birds, but fails. Mitch tells her that he knows about her and leaves. Resenting that Mitch made her out to be a fool, Melanie purchases the lovebirds and decides to deliver them to Mitch herself.\n\nMelanie ends up following Mitch to his weekend home in Bodega Bay, about an hour outside of San Francisco. When she arrives in town, she asks around town for the location of Mitch’s home as well as the name of his sister. She’s directed to the home of the local school teacher, Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette) who is Cathy’s teacher. In addition to learning Cathy’s name, she also learns that Annie is Mitch’s ex-girlfriend who broke up with Mitch over his overbearing mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy). Melanie also earns an invitation to stay with Annie at her home. As an aside, the whole Mitch/Lydia dynamic is odd. First of all, she seems much too old to be Cathy’s mother. It would be more believable if Cathy were Mitch’s daughter. This change in the storyline wouldn’t affect the plot. But aside from that, there are also scenes between Mitch and Lydia, where they oddly seem like romantic partners versus mother and son. I find some of their scenes strange.\n\nAnyway, Melanie ends up renting a boat and rowing across the bay to Mitch’s farmhouse. She breaks into his home and delivers the lovebirds. She then returns to her boat so she can wait for Mitch to enter the home and find the lovebirds. He does and quickly finds Melanie. When Lydia meets Melanie, she is cold to her, because she resents any woman in her son’s life. She is very much the jealous lover even though she’s Mitch’s mother. Anyway, it is after Melanie’s burglary of Mitch’s home is when the birds start attacking!\n\nMelanie is hit by a seagull upon returning to shore to return the boat. Mitch sees her and tends to her injury. Later, the children at Cathy’s birthday party are attacked by a flock of birds. Throughout the film, there are random bird attacks, which are unexplained. Never once in Hitchcock’s narrative does he try to offer a rational explanation for the bird attacks. The randomness and severity of the attacks is what lends the horror to The Birds. Hitchcock also opted to not use any sort of soundtrack or score, instead choosing to only utilize the sound of the birds to punctuate the action in the film. There are also large chunks of the film where there is no sound at all, except the diegetic and ambient sounds present within the film.\n\nThe absolute best example of Hitchcock’s use of silence and specific diegetic and ambient sounds is in the climactic scene when the birds attack the children at the school. To get this off my chest, I have to say that the song that the kids sing is so annoying and so awful, that I don’t blame the birds for attacking. The birds were doing the audience a favor. That song is irritating. I applaud the birds for putting an end to it. This is why they are the heroes of the film. Hitchcock also uses silence and diegetic sound very effectively at the film’s end, when the Brenner family walks an injured Melanie out of the house into the car, while the birds sit perched in silence. It’s very eerie and uncomfortable.\n\nEarlier in this article, I mentioned there are scenes that I find funny. Some scenes I think are intentionally funny, like the lovebirds leaning into every curve while Melanie is driving. One scene that I doubt is supposed to be funny but is funny is the scene when Mitch and Melanie are trying to find Cathy after the bird attack at the school. They go to Annie’s home and find Annie dead on the stairs, victim of the bird attack. Then, Melanie asks “Where’s Cathy?” Suddenly, Cathy pulls open the curtains and is sobbing in the window. For whatever reason, Cathy’s hysterical crying combined with the dramatic curtain pull makes me laugh. I know that’s probably terrible. Unfortunately, I cannot find a photo of Cathy in the window to support my statement. The other part that makes me laugh is the distressed mother in the diner. I also love that the other diners, like the bird lady, casually discuss the murderous birds. The distressed mother’s children are unaffected by the talk, but the mother is determined that her children are scared to death. I choose to believe that this mother deserves the stress as payback for wrecking Henry Fonda and Vera Miles’ lives with her false accusations in The Wrong Man.\n\nOne of the highlights of The Birds is the big explosion at the gas station. The birds attack a gas station attendant and he and the other employees run inside. Because of the attack, the gas attendant drops the gas hose on the ground, leaving a trail of gasoline. The birds start to attack and Melanie takes refuge in a phone booth. The scene of Melanie in the phone booth with birds hitting the glass walls is one of the famous scenes in the film. This scene concludes in spectacular fashion with a customer lighting a cigar at the gas station, igniting the massive trail of gasoline. A huge explosion levels the gas station. Melanie returns to the diner. Then, the distressed mother launches into her diatribe, accusing Melanie of bringing about the bird attacks and being evil.\n\nMOTHER: Why are they doing this? Why are they doing this? They said when you got here, the whole thing started. Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? I think you’re the cause of all of this. I think you’re evil. EVIL!\n\nDoreen Lang as “Hysterical Mother in the Diner” in The Birds (1963)\n\nI love that The Birds does not have a resolution. As far as we know, the birds are still out there, running Bodega Bay.\n\nA week ago Thursday (March 28), TCM finally dropped the full schedule for the upcoming TCMFF. Since then, I have been pouring over the schedule, discussing the various schedule conflicts with my husband. We’ve identified the screenings that we absolutely cannot miss, screenings that we’re interested in, but don’t necessarily have to do, and other screenings to which we’re indifferent. This year’s schedule is absolutely killer, despite presenting some agonizing conflicts. This schedule is so good, it feels like it was designed just for me. Last year, we attended the festival with the awesome Spotlight passes. This year however, I am attending with a Media pass and my husband will have the comparable Classic pass. We will be getting experience with the line queuing and the numbering system. I’ve read about how the lines work in previous festivals and understand the protocol. Last year, I wanted to make sure we saw something in every venue so we could see what they’re like. This year, I want to make sure to see something in the two new venues–El Capitan and the Egyptian.\n\nHere is the tentative schedule that my husband and I agreed upon, though in many cases, it is subject to change.\n\nWednesday\n\nWe’re flying into Burbank from Portland Tuesday night. Luckily, our flight is a little less than 2.5 hours, so it won’t be too daunting. Originally we were going to fly into LAX on Wednesday afternoon. However, with a 1:30pm arrival time on Wednesday afternoon with a media event scheduled ~4:30pm, I decided that it would be too stressful to try and get across Los Angeles to Hollywood in 3 hours. I could already feel myself becoming anxious trying to be on time and at the time I was still 1.5 months away. Regardless, I rearranged our plans so that we’d already be in town on the day we have a lot planned.\n\nOn Wednesday, my husband and I will need to pick up our passes. I am hoping that we may have time Wednesday morning to possibly go to Larry Edmunds book store. We will also be attending the Facebook TCMFF Group party at the Hollywood Heritage Museum. The museum has an MGM costume exhibit that we plan to see during the party. My husband and I will need to leave the party briefly to go back to the Roosevelt for the 4:30pm media event. Afterwards, we’ll head back to the party. We then have a 7:30pm Musso & Frank reservation. Will this be the year that my husband finally orders the Welsh rarebit that he’s been dying to try? We’ll see. Last year he was supposed to try it and then ordered a pork chop instead.\n\nThursday\n\nI have a lunch reservation at Miceli’s on Las Palmas Ave. for late Thursday morning. It is where Lucille Ball went in 1956 to learn how to toss pizza dough for the “Visitor From Italy” episode of I Love Lucy. I will try to go to Larry Edmunds this day if I don’t make it on Wednesday. I also want to go to Amoeba Music, but we won’t have a car this year. The walk is about 30 minutes, which isn’t bad, but we’ll need to see if we have time. The festival doesn’t officially kick off until 5:00pm with the opening night party. We’ll definitely be attending that. Prior to the party is a panel about the ins and outs of running a festival and then later the annual trivia event. Both sound interesting, but we’ll see if we go to either.\n\nRight off the bat, first block of the schedule and there’s a major conflict. Pulp Fiction can already be removed as it is the opening night film reserved for Spotlight and Essential passholders. When White Heat was announced, that was the film that I wanted to see… but then the schedule came out and Clue is scheduled opposite White Heat. Clue will be a poolside screening and Lesley Ann Warren, aka Miss Scarlett, will be present. I love Clue. It is hysterical. I am curious whether they’ll show all three endings in a row during the screening. Frankly, they should because it is the only way to watch this film. I am anticipating the Clue screening to be packed to the point where we probably won’t get a seat; but it’ll probably be our only chance for a pool screening if we were to attend any of the three awesome pool screenings that are planned.\n\nPick: Clue\n\nPlan B: White Heat\n\nOur two main choices for the second and last block of the evening are In Cold Blood in theater 1 at the multiplex or Gambit at the Egyptian. I’ve never seen In Cold Blood and I love true crime, so this would be a great pick. The con with this pick is if we see Clue, it ends at the time that In Cold Blood starts. We don’t want to leave Clue early, because seeing all the endings is the whole point of the film. You watch the entire film to get to this ending. I am also not a fan of leaving screenings early, as I don’t really want to come home having seen 75% of a dozen films. With that said, if we see Clue, it only makes sense to see Gambit, as we’ll have 30 minutes between screenings. If we see White Heat, we’d have 30 minutes to make it to In Cold Blood, or we could just stay at the Egyptian and see Gambit.\n\nPick: Gambit\n\nPlan B: In Cold Blood\n\nFriday\n\nThe first full block of the day is an easy decision. 101 Dalmatians is the only film scheduled at Disney’s El Capitan Theater and I want to see the inside. We’ve seen the outside of this theater every single time we’ve been in Hollywood (at least a half a dozen times) and have never been inside. Disney animator, Floyd Norman, is scheduled to appear with the hilarious Mario Cantone. I also discovered that Mr. Norman and I have the same birthday! El Capitan is also next to Ghirardelli, so a coffee/ice cream breakfast might be the perfect choice for this event. Were 101 Dalmatians not scheduled, I’d probably go see The Caine Mutiny or the Vitaphone feature.\n\nPick: 101 Dalmatians\n\nPlan B: There is no Plan B.\n\nThis block is a tough one. I would go see The Little Foxes, however it starts when 101 Dalmatians ends. Like I said before, I don’t particularly want to leave a movie early. The big con to this is that Mario Cantone is also introducing ‘Foxes’ which stars Bette Davis. Cantone does a hysterical Bette Davis impression. I have to hope that maybe The Little Foxes will be a TBA on Sunday. I would go see Them!, but it starts 15 minutes after ‘Dalmatians’ ends. I’m not sure that we’ll be able to get in on time to see the screening. Leonard Maltin is introducing Three Godfathers which I’ve never seen; but it’s in theater 4, so I’m not sure we’ll get in. The TCM Archive Project is the panel that looked the most interesting to me. I’d also never heard of The Model and the Marriage Broker before it was announced. This is a block that could really go any way and we couldn’t come up with a definitive plan. We might try to get into Them! and use the panel or maybe ‘Model’ as a back-up option if Them! is full. We may also use this block to get lunch if we’re hungry.\n\nPick: Them!\n\nPlan B: The TCM Archive Project panel, The Model and the Marriage Broker, or lunch!\n\nIn this block, my choice is It Should Happen to You with Jack Lemmon and Judy Holliday. This is such a fun film and would be a great afternoon movie. The Hearst newsreel presentation seems interesting, but I don’t know if it’s interesting enough to give up Jack and Judy. I like That’s Entertainment, but it’s really just a big clip show. I don’t know that I need to see it in the theater.\n\nPick: It Should Happen to You\n\nPlan B: There is no Plan B at the moment.\n\nThis Gidget poolside screening is killing me because it’s perfectly staggered between two movie blocks. I love Gidget. I have seen it dozens of times. This seems like a no-brainer. I suggested this movie as a poolside in last year’s after the festival survey. I feel like I manifested this event to happen. However, I don’t think we’ll be going to this screening. If James Darren, Moondoggie himself, were scheduled to attend, it’d be a no-brainer, Gidget is what I’d watch. However, Moondoggie is not the scheduled guest. Without Moondoggie, the excitement for this selection is a little diminished. I love Rear Window, but I’ve seen it in the theater four times. I’m not sure that I need to see it again at the cost of seeing something else. I’ve never seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Steven Spielberg will be in attendance. This film is also scheduled at Grauman’s, so it seems like the perfect venue to see it.\n\nPick: Close Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nPlan B: Gidget\n\nIf I go see Gidget, then none of these films even matter. However, we probably won’t be seeing this film and will probably be at Grauman’s for Close Encounters of the Third Kind. With that said, my choices for this block are Jailhouse Rock and It Happened One Night. We could stay at Grauman’s and see Se7en, but I don’t know that I can watch that movie so late at night. It’s pretty gruesome. I think I’d rather end the evening with something a little more upbeat. My husband and I have seen Jailhouse Rock in 35mm in the theater before. I’ve seen It Happened One Night in the theater, but my husband hasn’t. There’s also a film scheduled in Sunday’s block which uses the plot of ‘Night’ in its narrative, so it’d be a nice companion piece. Also, if I don’t see White Heat on Thursday, seeing It Happened One Night would be my chance to see the Egyptian, if I haven’t already.\n\nPick: It Happened One Night\n\nPlan B: Jailhouse Rock\n\nThere’s only one midnight film–it’s a film devoted to sharing the dangers of drinking and smoking. It sounds pretty funny and it’s short. It’s also the midnight film that fits best in our schedule. I think if we see Jailhouse Rock, which ends at 10:45pm, my husband is going to want to go back to the room, he won’t want to wait an hour for another film so late at night. It Happened One Night ends at 11:30, so it’s possible to make it to this screening. However, we need to get up early for the greatest screening of the entire festival on Saturday AM, so it’s possible that we’ll skip the midnight movie and go back to the hotel for bed. We went to last year’s midnight movie, Xanadu, and it was amazing.\n\nPick: The Road to Ruin (it’s the only choice, lol)\n\nPlan B: Going back to the hotel for bed\n\nSaturday\n\nMY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME, The Long Long Trailer, is scheduled during the Saturday morning block. It’s a no-brainer. This is the film we’re seeing. It’s in the tiny theater 4, so we’ll have to get in line early. I am not missing this screening. It has been my absolute dream to see my favorite movie of all time in the theater. If The Long Long Trailer wasn’t scheduled and it was some other movie, I’d be going to the nitrate screening at the Egyptian, Night Has a Thousand Eyes. However, ‘Trailer’ is scheduled, I cannot give up this choice. I am not willing to risk seeing something else with the hope of it becoming a TBA on Sunday. The. End.\n\nPick: The Long Long Trailer\n\nPlan B: There is no plan B. I have to see The Long Long Trailer.\n\nThis block features my only other chance to see a nitrate, Annie Get Your Gun at the Egyptian. However, I don’t really like this movie. I find Betty Hutton really annoying. Do I go to a movie I don’t really like just to see a nitrate? My husband said he was indifferent to nitrate and expressed the idea that I shouldn’t go see a movie I don’t like if I could see something else. That is a fair statement. Mario Cantone will be introducing Mae West in She Done Him Wrong during this same block. I can only imagine his Mae West impression (if he does one), so I feel that this might be worthwhile. It’s also in the same theater as The Long Long Trailer, so it’d be easy to get in line early. We could also get in the theater 4 line again to see Queen of the Mob which sounds interesting, or go to lunch. I am also interested in The Big Heat with Dana Delany if we don’t see Mae West.\n\nPick: She Done Him Wrong & Queen of the Mob\n\nPlan B: The Big Heat or Annie Get Your Gun, or forgo ‘Mob’ and get lunch.\n\nI love North by Northwest, but I’ve seen it in the theater a few times. The Phenix City Story is a film noir that I’ve never seen. My choice in this block is The Mad Miss Manton at the Egyptian with Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. That’ll probably be where we’ll be.\n\nPick: The Mad Miss Manton\n\nPlan B: North by Northwest or maybe The Phenix City Story.\n\nThis is probably the toughest block in the entire festival. The Shawshank Redemption has Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in attendance. It is a great movie. This is what my husband was all excited to see when it was announced, but then he saw the schedule and saw the animation presentation. He loves animation and when he saw that these are animated shorts that haven’t been seen for decades and it’s presented by Seth MacFarlane, he was torn. I am also interested in International House, as it’s a precode presented by Bruce Goldstein who was awesome during last year’s presentation of Footlight Parade. I’ve never heard of this movie, but it sounds really good. I’m hoping that it’ll be a TBA on Sunday. I also love Footloose and it kills me that it’s at the pool during this time, but Kevin Bacon isn’t going to be present, so some of the luster of that selection is lost. I think my husband has decided to forgo ‘Shawshank‘, which I’m sure will be absolutely packed, in favor of the animation presentation.\n\nPick: Back From the Ink: Restored Animated Shorts\n\nPlan B: The Shawshank Redemption or International House\n\nThe Saturday evening block is a little up in the air. I think we have it narrowed down to two choices–On the Waterfront and Dog Day Afternoon. Both films start about an hour after the animation shorts series ends. Both films end at midnight though, which is the same time that the midnight film, Heavenly Bodies, starts. There are two midnight films scheduled during the festival and if I were to attend one, ‘Bodies’ would be it. My husband and I have seen ‘Waterfront’ in the theater before. I don’t think either of us have seen ‘Afternoon’. This film is also being introduced by Jeff Daniels, who would be cool to see. We could also see Summer Stock, though we’ve both seen it many times. I despise the “Heavenly Music” number though. Seeing Summer Stock would be the easiest way to see the midnight film.\n\nPick: On the Waterfront or Dog Day Afternoon\n\nPlan B: Summer Stock\n\nLike I said before, the midnight screening is Heavenly Bodies. Our seeing this film is contingent on what we see in the block preceding it. If we see Summer Stock, we’ll probably hop back in line for the midnight film. If we see either On the Waterfont or Dog Day Afternoon, we’ll head back to the hotel to go to bed.\n\nPick: Heavenly Bodies\n\nPlan B: Bedtime\n\nSunday\n\nSunday morning is the last day of the festival and what better way to kick of the day than with Double Indemnity at Grauman’s? I’ve seen Double Indemnity in the theater multiple times, but I love this movie and I’ve seen the outside of Phyllis Dietrichson’s home in the Hollywood Hills. We could easily spend the entire day in Grauman’s because every movie scheduled is awesome; but we’ll see. It all depends on the TBA films.\n\nPick: Double Indemnity\n\nPlan B: No plan B\n\nMy choice in this block is to stay at Grauman’s and catch Sabrina. However, should the TBA be something that I’m interested in, I’ll probably go there. I’ve seen Sabrina in the theater before.\n\nPick: Sabrina\n\nPlan B: Possible TBA depending what it is\n\nThis block has three TBAs so this schedule could really go any way. As it stands, my choice is Chinatown at Grauman’s, as it is the quintessential Los Angeles film. However, I could be swayed to one of the TBAs depending what it is. I love Almost Famous too, but I don’t know that I absolutely have to see it at the festival. I saw Almost Famous in the theater in high school when it came out in 2000.\n\nPick: Chinatown\n\nPlan B: One or more of the TBAs depending what they are\n\nThe final block of the night is devoted to Spaceballs with Mel Brooks himself in attendance. When Mel was announced, it became my husband’s and my absolute #1 pick for the festival. Were Mel not attending, we’d be at the Egyptian seeing Sherlock Jr. We absolutely cannot give up a chance to see 97 year old Mel Brooks in person. Spaceballs is also the film I alluded to earlier when discussing my choice to see It Happened One Night. Spaceballs, while appearing to be a Star Wars parody, uses the plot of ‘Night’ to structure the main plot of its narrative. After Spaceballs, we’ll be at the party. I can only hope that the TBA isn’t something I absolutely wanted to see like White Heat, because that TBA will be SOL.\n\nPick: Spaceballs\n\nPlan B: There is no plan B\n\nGrumpy Old Men and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men, are more or less The Odd Couple 25 years later. Felix and Oscar are no longer roommates in New York City. They’re now neighbors living in the small midwestern town of Wabasha, Minnesota. Felix and Oscar are still alone, but are single and ready to mingle. The two men are polar opposites in every way, but are friends despite how incompatible they seem on the surface. They are the epitome of a “mismatched couple.”\n\nGrumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men are more or less one film, as the second film continues the story a few months after the events in the first film. Grumpy Old Men spans winter and spring and Grumpier Old Men covers summer and autumn. My family always watches both these films on Thanksgiving after our annual viewing of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Grumpy Old Men features Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we’ve found we can’t watch the first film without immediately watching the other. I have always accepted the events of both films taking place over a calendar year, despite the actual films being released two years apart. Both films are chock full of mismatched couples, covering a wide span of relationship types, from friendship to romance.\n\nIn the Grumpy Old Men series, Jack Lemmon plays John Gustafson, a widower and former teacher living alone in his beautiful Craftsman home in Wabasha. He survives off frozen meals and canned food and doesn’t seem thrilled about it. His daughter, Melanie (Darryl Hannah) and granddaughter come to visit often. His daughter’s relationship with her husband is on the rocks, and John isn’t upset to see it fall apart. John’s father, John Sr. (Burgess Meredith) is in his 90s and spends much of his time settling feuds between John and Max. John, Sr. is the polar opposite of his son. He eats unhealthily, smokes, and uses crass language. John’s biggest struggle in this film is that he owes a large sum of back taxes to the IRS and spends much of the film trying to dodge the collector.\n\nMeanwhile, John’s neighbor and exact opposite Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), also a widower, spends his time in his messy home watching television, happily eating frozen and canned food, and terrorizing John by playing pranks on him. Even Max and John’s pets are contrasting. Max’s dog is a drooling, smelly, one-eyed bulldog named Lucky who is regularly encouraged to terrorize John’s cat named Slick. Max’s son, Jacob (Kevin Pollak) is running for mayor. He is also the opposite of Melanie, John’s daughter. Aside from the obvious male/female difference, Melanie is tall, Jacob is short. He also harbored a crush on Melanie as a child and sees his golden opportunity when her marriage falls apart.\n\nTensions between John and Max heat up when a new neighbor, Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves to town from California. She purchases a home catty corner from John and Max. Compared to the more conservative residents of Wabasha, Ariel is a breath of fresh air and a curiosity to the other residents in town, specifically the men. She purchases all kinds of exotic homeopathic medicines and remedies from the local pharmacy–so exotic in fact that they have to be mail-ordered. Ariel paints, sculpts, cooks exotic foods, and zips around town on her bobsled. She runs outside in her leotard to make snow angels and overall has a zest for life. She always wants to take chances and risks on anything that is a new experience. John and Max both seem resigned to letting things happen to them, versus making things happen for them. The men are both enchanted by Ariel, because duh it’s Ann-Margret, so she’s also gorgeous, and try to do their best to woo her. In the end, John wins and Max is upset and disappointed.\n\nThe tension over Ariel brings to light the root cause of John and Max’s feud–after high school, John married Max’s high school sweetheart. John tries to smooth over the situation by saying that his wife ended up cheating on him and was not a prize. He further reiterates to Max that he lucked out with the woman he eventually married. However, Max is still hurt that once again, John has ended up with the woman he was interested in. Despite being opposites, Ariel’s interest in John ends up being a boon to his life as her love for life leads him to try new things and helps pull him out of his rut of loneliness that he was experiencing throughout much of the beginning of the film.\n\nHowever, Max might have lost out on Ariel, but he has a happy ending yet to come in Grumpier Old Men. His polar opposite, an Italian woman named Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti (Sophia Loren), the cousin of local resident “Spaghetti Ragetti,” opens up a “ristorante” in Wabasha. Because it’s Sophia Loren, she is of course absolutely gorgeous and turns the heads of every man (and woman) in town. She’s also of course, European, which also makes her standout in this small midwestern town. Maria arrives during the summer in Wabasha and purchases the now vacant bait shop. The bait shop’s proprietor, Chuck (Ossie Davis) had passed away during the winter, in Grumpy Old Men. Both John and Max are upset that their beloved bait shop is being converted into a restaurant. Presumably they are upset as this forces them to accept that their friend Chuck is really gone.\n\nJohn and Max do their best to ruin Maria’s restaurant. They switch out her red paint with yellow while she’s repainting, they change around signage to divert drivers away from the restaurant, everything they can to ruin it. Their efforts almost succeed when Maria has no customers on her opening night; however, when Ariel hears about what they’ve done she forces them to apologize. As one can imagine, this behavior does not present Max in the most appealing light, but he eventually charms Maria into going out on a date with him. Here is this man, definitely not conventionally attractive, with this gorgeous sophisticated Italian woman. Max buys her cheap jewelry (unaware how cheap it really is), tries to cook dinner for her but ends up with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and really puts forth an effort. They keep up an antagonistic front, with Maria calling Max an “ox” and him calling her a “nag.” In the end they fall in love and their name-calling transforms into “ox” and “nag” being pet names for one another.\n\nDespite all the differences between the various couples (friendship, family and romantic) described within this article, the core commonality they all have is love. John loves his father, John Sr. Max and John love each other despite their feud. When John has a heart attack and is hospitalized on Christmas Eve, Max is at the hospital to see him. When the nurse asks him if he’s a friend or family, Max hesitates and then says poignantly, “friend.” Ariel is at John’s beside pleading with him to stay with her. John and Max love their respective kids and each other’s kids. Melanie and Jacob eventually fall in love and elope. John and Max love their respective spouses, Ariel and Maria, despite the rocky starts both couples had. Even John Sr. finds love when he starts wooing Maria’s mother, “Mama,” (Ann Morgan Guilbert) a very conservative traditional Italian woman. At first she’s put off by John Sr.’s crass pick-up lines and innuendo, but eventually finds him charming. At the end of the Grumpy Old Men films, love triumphs over anything else.\n\nI hate pickles. I find them disgusting and hate when the complimentary pickle spear finds its way onto my plate at restaurants. I don’t like the pickle water bleeding onto the neighboring food and making it also taste like pickles. I can tolerate pickles chopped up in things, like tuna salad, but only if the amount of the other ingredients outweighs the amount of pickle.\n\nMy hatred of pickles makes “The Pickle Story” episode of The Andy Griffith Show especially funny. This episode originally aired on December 18, 1961 and the plot is simply that Aunt Bee’s (Francis Bavier) homemade pickles are disgusting. At the beginning of the episode, Aunt Bee is visited by her friend, Clara Johnson (Hope Summers), Mayberry’s reigning pickle champion at the county fair for the last eleven years in a row. She hopes that this year’s batch will win her twelfth blue ribbon. This scene also introduces the episode’s cliffhanger: Clara announces that this year she’s increased the amount of allspice in her pickle recipe. Will this lavish use of allspice put Clara’s blue ribbon in jeopardy?\n\nWell if it does, Bee won’t be the one ending the streak. After offering Clara a pickle, Bee looks at her with a look of hope and optimism–maybe this will finally be the batch that will usurp champion Clara’s domination of the pickle competition at the county fair. Clara takes a bite of the pickle and winces. The funniest part of this episode is the music that plays every time someone tastes Bee’s pickles. Clara tries to use the compliment sandwich technique of offering critical feedback. She tells Bee that while her pickles are very pleasant and nice and she wouldn’t change a thing, she recommends that Bee use younger cucumbers so her pickles wouldn’t be so soft. Clara also suggests that Bee tone down her brine as it’s heavy and steep an extra sprig or two of parsley in vinegar prior to adding it to her brine. She also suggests that Bee drain her pickles more, use fresher spices and boiling her vinegar longer. But other than that, Bee’s pickles are nice, Clara says.\n\nClara’s thinly disguised distaste of her pickles is lost on Bee as she eagerly heads down to the Sheriff’s office to bring lunch to Andy (Andy Griffith) and Barney (Don Knotts). At first the men are excited to see Bee but their enthusiasm quickly fades when they realize that she’s brought a jar of her awful “kerosene cucumbers.” Andy and Barney know what fate awaits them and they try to act excited, but are horribly failing. Bee is completely oblivious. Barney tries to feign being full, but Bee won’t hear of it. Andy and Barney are forced to placate Bee and eat her pickles and the hilarious music plays. She then tells them that she made eight quarts. Eight quarts of these godawful pickles.\n\nThis starts a scheme where Andy and Barney try to get rid of Bee’s pickles and replace them with store-bought pickles which are far superior. There’s a funny scene where Andy tries to shoo a fly off the pickle and Barney discovers that it died! Bee’s pickle brine was so bad a fly died. That evening, Barney comes over to Andy’s house while Bee is over at Clara’s house to take all the jars of pickles. Bee unexpectedly enters through the kitchen door, just as Barney is trying to leave. She spots Barney’s suitcase and asks if he’s going on a trip. Barney, the smooth operator that he is, explains that yes, he is going on a trip and he came over to borrow Andy’s suitcase, because “[his] is at the cleaners.” Despite Bee accepting the story and wishing him a good trip, Barney keeps awkwardly blathering while Andy is dying on the inside.\n\nBarney finally leaves and we see a montage of scenes of him stopping motorists and handing them a jar of pickles saying that their exemplary driving made them the winner of Mayberry’s Safe Driving Award. A poor driver from Portland, OR (where I live, more or less) is handed a jar of Bee’s horrible, mushy, briny pickles. I appreciate that “Oregon” was pronounced correctly in the episode and not as “Or-eh-gone.” Anyway, Andy makes the switch and he, Barney and Opie all gladly eat Bee’s pickles. One evening at dinner, while eating a pickle, Bee expresses happiness over how good “her” pickles are and announces she’s going to enter them in the county fair. As an aside, in the dinner scene, the pattern on Bee’s dress perfectly matches the pattern of the wallpaper behind her and I always find it funny. Anyway, Andy is horrified that Bee is planning to enter something that she didn’t make.\n\nBarney doesn’t see what the big deal is, but Andy explains that he cannot in good conscience allow Bee to unknowingly enter pickles she didn’t make. It is decided that Bee must make more pickles. Barney is horrified at the thought of purposely forcing Bee to make more pickles, but he ultimately relents. This sets up a hilarious scene of Andy, Barney and Opie eating jar after jar of pickles, so that 1) there aren’t any pickles left to enter in the contest; and 2) So that Bee sees them enjoying “her” pickles and wants to make more. Andy, Barney and Opie all have their own theme music that slows down as they eat more and more pickles. Andy’s music is more or less a modified version of the show’s theme song, Opie’s is more childlike, and Barney’s is in the middle. By the last jar of pickles, each character looks like they’re going to be sick and the music has slowed down to a labored dirge.\n\nDespite having watched the boys eat all her pickles, Aunt Bee is horrified to see that all her pickles are gone. She quickly makes more and soon it’s time for the fair! The judging scene is funny. The judges get to Bee’s jar, pull a pickle out, sniff it, apprehensively taste it and concur that it must have been made from kerosene. In the end, Clara’s gamble with her wild use of allspice pays off and she earns her twelfth blue ribbon. Bee also announces that because everyone loved her pickles so much, she made a double batch! 16 quarts of pickles. Andy then resigns himself to a lifetime of eating terrible pickles. “Learn to love them,” he says, stoically.\n\nIn the hysterical tag scene, Andy is eating breakfast and spreads some marmalade on his toast. Barney comes in and asks if he’s painting. Andy says no and concludes that it’s Opie’s glue. Barney disagrees and says that it smells like ammonia. He then sits down to some breakfast and smears some of the marmalade on toast. Barney is about to take a bite and is almost overcome by the fumes. Andy opens the container of jam on the table and realizes that it is the source of the smell. They open the cupboard and are horrified to see a dozen jars of Aunt Bee’s latest concoction.\n\nThis episode is absolutely hysterical. From the music that plays each time someone eats one of Bee’s awful pickles, to almost all of Barney’s dialogue. Clara’s constant boasting of using allspice is hilarious. It’s as if she discovered some secret ingredient that’s elevated her recipes and she can’t help but brag about it. Poor Andy is caught in the middle between not wanting to hurt Bee’s feelings but also not wanting to eat anymore of her disgusting pickles. Barney just hates Bee’s pickles and doesn’t want to eat them. He doesn’t care. Opie doesn’t have a big role in this episode, but he is memorably stuck eating jar after jar of pickles. Bee is absolutely oblivious (or in denial) throughout the entire episode, as anyone with eyes could see that people don’t enjoy eating her pickles.\n\nAs a native Oregonian, I still think about that poor soul from Oregon who was unwittingly gifted a jar of Bee’s kerosene cucumbers."
