        "text": "The One in Massapequa\n\nMonica becomes inarticulate while giving her toast at a 35th wedding anniversary party for her parents, Jack (recurring guest star Elliott Gould) and Judy (recurring guest star Christina Pickles), and regrets volunteering to make the speech instead of Ross. Phoebe brings her latest boyfriend, Parker (recurring guest star Alec Baldwin), an effusive optimist who is so enthusiastic about everything that he makes people crazy. Meanwhile, Ross is astounded when Jack and Judy ask him and the pregnant Rachel to pretend to be married, in order to prevent a potential scandal.\n\nThe One with the Tea Leaves\n\nRachel devises a lie about her unborn child that she hopes will break the silence between her and Joey; Phoebe reads tea leaves and predicts she will soon encounter the man of her dreams.\n\nHellraisers and Heartbreakers\n\nEd's old pal visits pitching a new security system. But when the installation of the new equipment uncovers that a computer hacker has tapped into the system, a suspicious Big Ed and Danny search for him. Mary welcomes a new comic to the hotel.\n\nCriminal Stories\n\nRenowned New York Ledger columnist Jimmy MacArthur (Alec Baldwin) is given full access to Sergeant Benson (Hargitay) and the squad for an inside look at the city's Special Victims Unit. When the rape case of a young Muslim woman (guest star Summer Bishil) escalates to a hate crime, Jimmy stays one step ahead of the investigation and declares the entire crime a hoax. With the victim under fierce public scrutiny, Benson struggles to keep the case on solid ground and fears a rapist will go free.\n\nDegas Away With It\n\nEd uses his past connections and some old-school tactics to hunt down the man who stole a priceless work of art from the Montecito. His frantic search leads to an uncomfortable reunion with his former partner, Jack Keller (Alec Baldwin)."
