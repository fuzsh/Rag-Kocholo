        "text": "The Colony Theatre is thrilled to present the second production of its 37th season of shows - its first ever with six productions instead of five! Hal Linden & Christina Pickles will star in the classic, ON GOLDEN POND, written by Ernest Thompson and directed by Cameron Watson (Trying, Grace and Glorie). ON GOLDEN POND will preview on Wednesday, July 27; Thursday, July 28; and Friday, July 29 at 8:00pm and will open on Saturday, July 30 at 8:00pm and continue through Sunday, August 28 at The Colony Theatre, 555 North Third Street (at Cypress) adjacent to the Burbank Town Center.\n\nLovable curmudgeon Norman Thayer is as tart-tongued as ever. His spirited wife, Ethel, delights in all the small things that have enriched their lives. Together, they are returning to their summer home on the lake for the forty-eighth year and are soon visited by their adult daughter, her uptight fiancé, and his rebellious teenage son. ON GOLDEN POND is a heartwarming story about revisiting the past and forging new bonds across generations. This modern classic remains an inspiring celebration of the universal challenges we all face, and the ultimate triumphs of life, love, and family. The award-winning Colony Theatre was founded in 1975 as a 99-seat Equity-waiver theatre in Silver Lake. Over the years the company was so successful artistically, and built such a large subscriber base, that in 2000 it was able to move into a 270-seat theatre created for it by the City of Burbank, becoming one of only 5 mid-size professional theatres in the LA area that produces a year-round season of plays and musicals, and that employs actors under contract with Actors' Equity Association. Since the move to Burbank, The Colony was named one of \"25 Notable U.S. Theatre Companies\" by the Encyclopedia Britannica Almanac for 8 years in a row and voted \"Best Live Theatre in LA\" in The Daily News 2006 Readers' Choice poll. The company's audience is so loyal that in an era when subscription is declining dramatically, and when the industry-wide \"gold standard\" renewal rate of 80% is considered unattainable, for the past two seasons The Colony has achieved a subscription renewal rate over 90%. This season, at a time when many theatres are shortening their seasons and canceling performances, The Colony is expanding, for the first time in its history presenting six shows instead of the usual five. ABOUT THE CREATIVE TEAMErnest Thompson (Playwright) Other plays include The West Side Waltz (starring Katharine Hepburn), A Sense of Humor (Jack Lemmon), Amazons In August, White People Christmas (which Mr. Thompson directed at LA's Zephyr Theatre), The Elixir (directed by and starring Mr. Thompson at the Isis Theatre Company in Idyllwild), the short play collections Answers, Valentines for Two, and The Penis Responds (which Mr. Thompson directed and starred in Off-Off-Broadway). Films include \"On Golden Pond\" (Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda, Academy Award, Golden Globe, Writers Guild Award), \"Sweet Hearts Dance\" (Susan Sarandon), \"1969\" (Robert Downey, Jr., directed by Mr. Thompson), \"The Lies Boys Tell\" (Kirk Douglas), \"Out of Time\" (Showtime, Daytime Emmy nomination Best Director), \"The West Side Waltz\" (directed by Mr. Thompson with Shirley MacLaine and Liza Minnelli), and the live TV production of \"On Golden Pond\" (Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, directed by Mr. Thompson). Through his company, Whitebridge Farm Productions, he has directed and stars in \"Time and Charges,\" now in postproduction, and about to direct and star in \"Heavenly Angle.\" At his farm in New Hampshire, Mr. Thompson teaches workshops for actors and directors and weekend boot camps for writers, eight of whom arrive on a Friday night with blank files and by Sunday afternoon are having their newly created plays read by professional actors in a front of a live audience. www.ErnestThompson.us or www.WhitebridgeFarmProductions.com. CAMERON WATSON (Director) returns to The Colony for his fourth production. He previously directEd Grace & Glorie, which garnered four Ovation Award nominations including Best Production and won the Ovation Award for Best Actress (Beth Grant); Educating Rita; and Trying, which received eight Ovation Award nominations and won for Best Actor (Alan Mandell) along with the Garland Award for Best Director.
