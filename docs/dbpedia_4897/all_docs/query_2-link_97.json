        "text": "01 of 50\n\nAbbott Elementary (2021–present)\n\nQuinta Brunson's lauded mockumentary, following five disparate teachers at an under-funded Philadelphia public school struggling to help their students, achieves something the form rarely does: It actually makes you laugh. Abbott Elementary is reminiscent of cult classic sitcoms like Arrested Development twisted with the warm, universal appeal of Modern Family. —Declan Gallagher\n\nWhere to watch Abbott Elementary: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read our review)\n\nCast: Quinta Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Lisa Ann Walter, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Janelle James, Chris Perfetti, William Stanford Davis\n\n02 of 50\n\nAwkwafina Is Nora From Queens (2020–present)\n\nA funnier, edgier take on the Broad City formula — a tremendously high mark to match, let alone surpass — Awkwafina's Comedy Central showcase is prime comfort viewing. It follows the titular Nora (Awkwafina) who, along with her cousin, father, and eccentric grandmother, tries to navigate life in Flushing, Queens. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens: Max\n\nCast: Awkwafina, Bowen Yang, Lori Tan Chinn, B.D. Wong, Jennifer Esposito\n\n03 of 50\n\nBarry (2018–2023)\n\nBill Hader masterminded this highly decorated dark dramedy, which wrapped up its final season in 2023. There's no better time to binge the hilarious, often tragic exploits of its title character, a hitman (Hader) who worms his way into an acting class, and as a result, gets a second chance at life. As the batty instructor, Henry Winkler has rarely been better. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Barry: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Bill Hader, Henry Winkler, Sarah Goldberg, Stephen Root, Anthony Carrigan\n\n04 of 50\n\nBatman: The Animated Series (1992–1995)\n\nAs the streaming home of DC media, Max has numerous Batman films and shows on its platform. And while everyone has their preferred take on the character, few would argue that Batman: The Animated Series is top tier, if not the best. This is the gold standard for superhero television, from its striking visuals to the writing to its signature voice performances. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Batman: The Animated Series: Max\n\nCast: Kevin Conroy, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Loren Lester, Bob Hastings, Robert Costanzo, Mark Hamill, Arleen Sorkin\n\n05 of 50\n\nBig Little Lies (2017–2019)\n\nThe level of A-list talent on this Emmy-winning adaptation of Liane Moriarty's best-selling novel is still astonishing in retrospect. Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Zoë Kravitz, and Laura Dern star as a group of five Monterey women involved in a murder investigation, though each has more than their fair share of drama in their personal lives, too. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Big Little Lies: Max\n\nCast: Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Zoë Kravitz, Laura Dern, Alexander Skarsgård, Adam Scott, Iain Armitage, Kathryn Newton, Meryl Streep\n\n06 of 50\n\nBoardwalk Empire (2010–2014)\n\nMartin Scorsese and Terence Winter's rip-roaring prohibition-era crime epic follows Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson (Steve Buscemi), Atlantic City's treasurer who also happens to supply its illicit liquor. Working with gangsters such as Al Capone and lining the pockets of the metropolitan elite, Nucky soon becomes the most fearsome figure on the East Coast — and one of the most notable television characters of the 2010s. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Boardwalk Empire: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Steve Buscemi, Michael Pitt, Michael Shannon, Kelly Macdonald, Gretchen Mol\n\n07 of 50\n\nChernobyl (2019)\n\nYou might not expect one of the worst nuclear tragedies in history to make for enjoyable, or even watchable, television. Yet Craig Mazin's searing limited series — a disaster drama deconstructing the calamity and its aftermath — manages to be all of those things. It's also one of the best-written shows in recent memory. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Chernobyl: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård, Jessie Buckley, Emily Watson\n\n08 of 50\n\nThe Comeback (2005; 2014)\n\nThis terrifically uncomfortable mockumentary show (created by Sex and the City's Michael Patrick King) had one season in 2005 before getting brought back for a fan-generated reboot in 2014. The series follows the hubristic exploits of faded actress Valerie Cherish (Lisa Kudrow) as she tries to get her career back on track with a hip new sitcom and a reality television crew in tow. The Comeback gives its star many opportunities to flex her significant comedy muscles in an edgier setting than Friends allowed for. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Comeback: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Lisa Kudrow, Malin Åkerman, Laura Silverman, Robert Michael Morris, Damian Young\n\n09 of 50\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm (2000–2024)\n\nLarry David became everyone's favorite curmudgeonly father over 12 seasons of antagonism, so much so that his real life blends with that of his onscreen counterpart. Curb is ambling and often shapeless (especially as it goes along) but the general thread of Larry insulting everyone he encounters with seemingly innocuous remarks and igniting petty grievances somehow never gets old. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Larry David, Jeff Garlin, Cheryl Hines, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove\n\n10 of 50\n\nDeadwood (2004–2006)\n\nSet in the lawless, Civil War-era mining town of the title, David Milch's startlingly violent (and profane) Western revitalized the genre across three seasons and a movie. It demonstrated that horse operas could be more than John Wayne, one-liners, and saloon brawls. Following an assortment of characters wandering through town to make a buck, Deadwood made stars out of Timothy Olyphant (as Sheriff Seth Bullock) and Ian McShane (as dastardly Al Swearengen). —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Deadwood: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, Robin Weigert, Molly Parker, Dayton Callie\n\n11 of 50\n\nEnlightened (2011–2013)\n\nOne of HBO's most underrated series in its long legacy, Enlightened follows Amy Jellicoe (Laura Dern), a California woman who suffers a mental breakdown and is subsequently treated at a wellness facility. She emerges renewed as she returns to work, where she uncovers corporate malfeasance and becomes a self-proclaimed \"agent of change.\" Dern has arguably never been better in her portrayal of all the beautiful complexities of Amy's messy life. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Enlightened: Max\n\nCast: Laura Dern, Luke Wilson, Diane Ladd, Sarah Burns, Timm Sharp, Mike White\n\n12 of 50\n\nEuphoria (2019–present)\n\nSam Levinson's signature series profiles a cadre of high schoolers living on the absolute razor's edge of humanity, indulging in drug use and sexual situations that would curl even Caligula's toes. It's harrowing viewing, and occasionally uncomfortable for the wrong reasons, but you'd be hard-pressed to stop watching. Season 3 is set to premiere in 2025. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Euphoria: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney, Hunter Schafer, Alexa Demie, Barbie Ferreira, Maude Apatow, Angus Cloud, Jacob Elordi\n\n13 of 50\n\nFantasmas (2024–present)\n\nJulio Torres delivers his unique brand of surrealism in this eye-popping, mind-bending comedy. The multihyphenate stars in the series as himself, a writer living in a heavily corporatized future who must go on a quest to prove his existence or else be evicted from his home. The absurdism of the premise is a feature, not a bug, and Torres brings a similar level of imaginative style as his previous HBO series (Los Espookys) and his critically acclaimed film, Problemista (2024). Plus, be ready to spot numerous famous faces including Emma Stone, Natasha Lyonne, and Bowen Yang. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Fantasmas: Max\n\nCast: Julio Torres, Martine Gutierrez, Tomas Matos, Joe Rumrill\n\n14 of 50\n\nFriends (1994–2004)\n\nThe classic sitcom about six chums tryin' to make it in the Big Apple is available in its entirety on Max for all of your binging purposes. Not all of it has aged brilliantly, but some of it is funnier than you might remember. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Friends: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer\n\n15 of 50\n\nFull Circle (2023)\n\nSteven Soderbergh directed this magnetic limited series — about a kidnapping in New York City and its ripple effects — is a tight, six-episode punch. Soderbergh is ultimately a humanist filmmaker, and that rings truer than ever in this labyrinth mystery which places its characters first. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Full Circle: Max\n\nCast: Claire Danes, Timothy Olyphant, Zazie Beetz, CCH Pounder, Dennis Quaid\n\n16 of 50\n\nGame of Thrones (2011–2019)\n\nThe groundbreaking fantasy series about the various dynasties struggling for power over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros is perhaps the network's best-known output after The Sopranos. Based on George R. R. Martin's tomes, Game of Thrones continues to captivate audiences. Now that the smoke has settled from its controversial final season, the show can be enjoyed on its own merits — which are substantial. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Game of Thrones: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Rose Leslie, Gwendoline Christie, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey\n\n17 of 50\n\nThe Gilded Age (2022–present)\n\nFor those with a Downton Abbey-shaped hole in their heart, its creator Julian Fellowes has returned with this delicious, Emmy-nominated period piece. Set during the financial boom of New York City in the late-1800s, The Gilded Age centers on the conflict between old money and new money, as represented by sisters Agnes (Christine Baranski) and Ada (Cynthia Nixon) and married couple Bertha (Carrie Coon) and George (Morgan Spector), respectively. In the middle of it all is Agnes and Ada's niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson), who tries to maneuver the strict social mores of the time. With \"glitz, gorgeous costumes and sets, soapy drama, and biting one-liners,\" The Gilded Age is escapist fun for costume drama enthusiasts. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Gilded Age: Max\n\nCast: Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, Louisa Jacobson, Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski, Denée Benton, Taissa Farmiga, Harry Richardson, Blake Ritson, Thomas Cocquerel, Simon Jones, Jack Gilpin\n\n18 of 50\n\nGirls (2012–2017)\n\nLena Dunham's millennial answer to Sex and the City — featuring an equal number of social outrages and dating talking points — has its share of pitfalls, but it manages to accomplish the same thing its parent show did for its generation. In showing a way of modern living for younger generations rarely depicted with such realism, Girls was quietly revolutionary. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Girls: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Lena Dunham, Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet, Jemima Kirke, Adam Driver\n\n19 of 50\n\nHacks (2021–present)\n\nJean Smart reinvigorated her career in the clever, barbed portrait of a Joan Rivers-style comedian trying to get her act back on track while mentoring a millennial (Hannah Einbinder) with a bad attitude. It walks a brilliant line between nostalgic showbiz paean and modern cringe-comedy. The series has been renewed for a fourth season. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Hacks: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, Mark Indelicato, Paul W. Downs, Megan Stalter\n\n20 of 50\n\nHarley Quinn (2019–present)\n\nMuch like 2020's Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn manages to get what was always so tantalizing about the character exactly right. Consistently, it seems, the best versions of superheroes are their animated counterparts. Kaley Cuoco makes a brilliant fit as the voice of Harley Quinn, a queenpin trying to carve out her independence in Gotham City. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Harley Quinn: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Kaley Cuoco, Lake Bell, Alan Tudyk, Tony Hale, Christopher Meloni\n\n21 of 50\n\nI Hate Suzie (2020–present)\n\nBillie Piper stars as Suzie Pickles, a singer-turned-actress (like Piper) who has some nude photos of her leaked onto the internet (unlike Piper). The ensuing show is a darkly comic meditation on modern womanhood, celebrity, and the often uneasy entwinement of the two. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch I Hate Suzie: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Leila Farzad, Billie Piper, Daniel Ings, Nathaniel Martello-White, Chelsea Edge\n\n22 of 50\n\nI May Destroy You (2021)\n\nMichaela Coel's phenomenal, groundbreaking work stands as one of the most staggeringly original series HBO has shepherded. It's a powerful testament to recovery, friendship, and the power of writing as it follows Arabella (series creator and writer Coel) in the aftermath of a sexual assault. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch I May Destroy You: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Michaela Coel, Paapa Essiedu, Marouane Zotti, Weruche Opia, Lewis Reeves\n\n23 of 50\n\nJerrod Carmichael Reality Show (2024–present)\n\nFollowing his coming out as gay in his 2022 comedy special Rothaniel, Jerrod Carmichael opens up his life to public scrutiny in this eye-opening reality series. The documentary series focuses on Carmichael embracing his sexuality more openly, figuring out his priorities, and struggling to find acceptance from his devoutly religious mother. \"Reality Show feels like Carmichael’s attempt to force himself to change through radical, often excruciating transparency,\" EW's critic writes, \"It's part performance art, part cognitive behavioral therapy.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jerrod Carmichael\n\n24 of 50\n\nThe Knick (2014–2015)\n\nSteven Soderbergh's credible, rollicking tale of surgeons at New York's premier hospital at the turn of the 20th century might be the most underrated show here. It's equal parts historical drama, medical thriller, and body-horror — Boardwalk Empire by way of Cronenberg. It's the greatest television work yet from Soderbergh, one of the finer American filmmakers by some distance. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Knick: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Clive Owen, André Holland, Juliet Rylance, Jeremy Bobb, Eve Hewson\n\n25 of 50\n\nThe Larry Sanders Show (1992–1998)\n\nThe original meta-comedy, The Larry Sanders Show details the narcissistic machinations of the eponymous character behind the scenes of his fake talk show. It's ground zero for many soon-to-be-influential comedians, including Judd Apatow and Janeane Garofalo. As the anchor, Garry Shandling is unimpeachable. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Larry Sanders Show: Max\n\nCast: Garry Shandling, Rip Torn, Jeffrey Tambor, Janeane Garofalo, Penny Johnson\n\n26 of 50\n\nThe Last of Us (2023–present)\n\nThis buzzy, apocalyptic zombie series — perhaps one of the best works ever based on a videogame — lit up HBO during its first season with unexpected storytelling and primal central chemistry between Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey. There's no better time to rewatch as we wait with bated breath for season 2 in 2025. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Last of Us: Max\n\nCast: Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey\n\n27 of 50\n\nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver (2014–present)\n\nComedian/commentator John Oliver has collected a boatload of Emmys for bringing his righteous, riotous perspective to the issues plaguing the world today, including hot-button topics like income inequality, ongoing wars, and reproductive rights, and deeper dives into the world of cryptocurrencies and televangelism. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Max\n\nCast: John Oliver\n\n28 of 50\n\nThe Leftovers (2014–2017)\n\nDamon Lindelof's series details the aftermath of a mass event in which a small portion of the world's population suddenly disappears into thin air. Those that are left, are, well…you get it. The show spun three seasons of cerebral, compelling world-building which managed to more or less stick its landing without letting down the audience. It remains one of Justin Theroux's finest performances, a tantalizing mix of traditional leading-man bravado and humble vulnerability. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Leftovers: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Justin Theroux, Carrie Coon, Margaret Qualley, Amy Brenneman, Liv Tyler\n\n29 of 50\n\nMare of Easttown (2014–2015)\n\nKate Winslet's brilliant performance (and another by Jean Smart) highlights this creepy, tragic examination of family grief. As the town detective, Mare (Winslet) traverses a fresh murder case that may link to a cold case — and could tie closer to her family than she ever considered. Director Craig Zobel infuses Mare of Easttown with such a specific sense of time and place that by the time you get to the end, you'll be craving a walk around the block in bright sunlight. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Mare of Easttown: Max\n\nCast: Kate Winslet, Angourie Rice, Evan Peters, Julianne Nicholson, Jean Smart\n\n30 of 50\n\nOlive Kitteridge (2014)\n\nA cantankerous older woman affects the lives of those in her small town in this four-part series. Adapted from Elizabeth Strout's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, Olive Kitteridge tells the story of its title character (Frances McDormand) and her appeasing husband, Henry (Richard Jenkins), over multiple decades. Olive's bluntness has both positive and negative effects on those in her community and within her own home. Centering on relationships and the difficulties of life, the miniseries takes an understated, character-driven approach that rings true. Olive Kitteridge won eight Emmys, including Outstanding Limited Series. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Olive Kitteridge: Max\n\nCast: Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins, Zoe Kazan, Rosemarie DeWitt, John Gallagher Jr., Jesse Plemons, Bill Murray, Peter Mullan\n\n31 of 50\n\nOur Flag Means Death (2022–2023)\n\nThis two-season favorite puts a comedic spin on the story of Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby), a.k.a. the Gentleman Pirate. Forgoing his privileged life, Stede opts for one on the high seas as the captain of the Revenge. On their hapless adventures, Stede and his crew meet the notorious captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi), but unexpected feelings emerge between the two very different leaders. The series quickly amassed a passionate fanbase throughout its first season, particularly for its depiction of LGBTQ characters. \"What starts as a seemingly goofy sitcom soon reveals itself as something far more amorous,\" EW's critic writes, \"and with far more heart.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Our Flag Means Death: Max\n\nCast: Rhys Darby, Taika Waititi, Ewen Bremner, Joel Fry, Samson Kayo, Nathan Foad, Vico Ortiz, Matthew Maher, Kristian Nairn, Rory Kinnear, Con O'Neill, Guz Khan, David Fane, Samba Schutte\n\n32 of 50\n\nPerry Mason (2020–2023)\n\nAn old-fashioned noir with a dose of modern kink and nihilism, this retooling of Erle Stanley Gardner's classic sleuthing lawyer is sumptuously designed and wittily played. It's sort of a post-Tarantino Dashiell Hammett. As Mason's sidekick Della Street, Juliet Rylance brings vigor to a character not done justice in previous adaptations. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Perry Mason: Max\n\nCast: Matthew Rhys, Juliet Rylance, John Lithgow, Tatiana Maslany, Robert Patrick\n\n33 of 50\n\nPushing Daisies (2007–2009)\n\nPeruse any list of shows that were canceled too soon and you're bound to find this shining gem that ended after two seasons on ABC. Pushing Daisies follows a gentle pie-maker named Ned (Lee Pace), who has the power to regenerate the dead for one minute without consequence — so long as he sticks to the time limit. He teams up with a private investigator to solve crimes, but things become complicated when Ned revives his childhood crush, Chuck (Anna Friel), and refuses to let her die permanently. Sugary-sweet with just the right hints of tart, Pushing Daisies is a visually arresting series that still lives on in our hearts. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Pushing Daisies: Max\n\nCast: Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Chi McBride, Kristin Chenoweth, Ellen Greene, Swoosie Kurtz\n\n34 of 50\n\nThe Rehearsal (2022–present)\n\nNathan Fielder's uproarious, genuinely unbelievable show — in which he prepares everyday people for uncomfortable conversations and personal milestones by holding a rehearsal of the event — lies somewhere between a sketch program and hidden camera show. It unfolds in such a way that it is indescribable. However, it's sure to get you both laughing and cringing in equal measure. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Rehearsal: Max\n\nCast: Nathan Fielder\n\n35 of 50\n\nThe Righteous Gemstones (2019–present)\n\nDanny McBride and David Gordon Green's riotous take on the American religious industry, following a family of grifting televangelists, is one of the most creative and outré things HBO has ever produced. It's unmissable television, and we envy any potential first-time viewers out there. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Righteous Gemstones: Max\n\nCast: Danny McBride, John Goodman, Adam DeVine, Edi Patterson, Tim Baltz\n\n36 of 50\n\nSex and the City (1998–2004)\n\nThough it began as a hipper, more barbed comedy than the fairy tale it would become, Sex and the City managed to remain consistent throughout its six seasons. It was somewhat radical in its depiction of Miranda's (Cynthia Nixon) unwary motherhood, while Carrie's (Sarah Jessica Parker) indecision over Mr. Big (boo, and indeed hiss) and Aidan (The One) can still generate conversation. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Sex and the City: Max\n\nCast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon\n\n37 of 50\n\nSix Feet Under (2001–2005)\n\nBeing depressed was never quite as fun as it was on Six Feet Under. Creator Alan Ball's tale of the Fisher family, who own a particularly busy funeral parlor in Los Angeles, is his masterwork. It's a perfect combination of his morose whimsy and dark social satire. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Six Feet Under: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Peter Krause, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Michael C. Hall, Rachel Griffiths\n\n38 of 50\n\nThe Sopranos (1999–2007)\n\nA show about gangsters and the mafia for those who aren't at all interested in either subject, The Sopranos still remains HBO's landmark series. It's fantastically well written, occasionally hard to watch, but often surprisingly warm and funny. Taking the standard Scorsese model and transposing it into a warped suburban dramedy, the lauded saga follows mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) as he navigates panic attacks in therapy, home life with his fiery wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and New Jersey's criminal underworld. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Sopranos: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Lorraine Bracco\n\n39 of 50\n\nSouth Park (1997–present)\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone's everlasting series about a cadre of foul-mouth school chums has spoofed current events — seemingly in real time — since 1997 (plus a movie). You'd be hard-pressed to find a show that has more cultural relevance or staying power than South Park. The work has a reputation for being ceaselessly vulgar (which, in fairness, it is) but what many people don't discuss is how clever it is, too. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch South Park: Max\n\nCast: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Isaac Hayes, April Stewart, Adrien Beard\n\n40 of 50\n\nStation Eleven (2021–2022)\n\nBased upon Emily St. John Mandel's novel of the same name, this all-too-credible postapocalyptic drama follows survivors of a devastating pandemic as they try to rebuild what's left of society. The show is patiently paced, mirroring its source material, and though the premise is largely horrific, Station Eleven is guided by a sense of hope and optimism. Perhaps its biggest asset is how eminently bingeable it is, though you wouldn't think that at first brush. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Station Eleven: Max\n\nCast: Mackenzie Davis, Himesh Patel, Daniel Zovatto, David Wilmot, Matilda Lawler\n\n41 of 50\n\nSteven Universe (2013–2019)\n\nSteven Universe has become one of the most beloved animated series of the 21st century thanks to its well-earned uplifting message, bright animation, and dynamic voice performances. The series follows the titular young boy who fights to protect Earth alongside a trio of friendly aliens known as the Crystal Gems. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Steven Universe: Max\n\nCast: Zach Callison, Estelle, Michaela Dietz, Deedee Magno Hall\n\n42 of 50\n\nSuccession (2018–2023)\n\nThe saga of the Roy (definitely not Murdoch) family, which unfolded over four fraught seasons, provided Max viewers on the internet at large with much to discuss. We won't spoil anything here, because it's all just so good. Succession is modern-day Shakespeare with better suits. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Succession: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, Matthew Macfadyen\n\n43 of 50\n\nThe Sympathizer (2024)\n\nA man known only as the Captain operates as a spy for North Vietnam in this riveting story adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen. Shortly before the fall of Saigon, the Captain flees to America where he continues to send secret intel to the North Vietnamese. Grappling with the precarious nature of his identity, the Captain struggles under the weight of pressures placed on him. Featuring a compelling lead turn from Hoa Xuande and multiple scene-stealing performances from Robert Downey Jr., The Sympathizer is a mesmerizing drama series with a lot on its mind. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Sympathizer: Max\n\nCast: Hoa Xuande, Robert Downey Jr., Toan Le, Fred Nguyen Khan, Duy Nguyễn, Vy Le, Ky Duyen, Phanxinê, Kieu Chinh, Alan Trong, Sandra Oh\n\n44 of 50\n\nTrue Detective (2014–present)\n\nNo one will argue that True Detective is consistent across its anthology seasons, but all four have their attributes. Season 1 is undoubtedly the best, a cryptic and chilly serial killer thriller with dashes of the occult and supernatural. But seasons 2 and 3, which follow more traditional pulp trajectories, contain boundless thrills and some genuinely innovative narrative turns. Then there's season 4, subtitled Night Country, which embraces the supernatural and centers primarily on women, compared to its masculine-heavy predecessors. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch True Detective: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Kitsch, Vince Vaughn, Mahershala Ali, Jodie Foster, Kali Reis\n\n45 of 50\n\nVeep (2012–2019)\n\nIf The West Wing is too saccharine for you, try Veep. Julia Louis-Dreyfus anchors this over-the-top satire as an under-appreciated vice president who seems to be met by embarrassment at every turn. Its depiction of bumbling, fumbling White House staff used to seem gleefully exaggerated until 2016, when real headlines quickly eclipsed Veep's manic imagination. As foul-mouthed ensemble comedies go, there really isn't anything better. Veep gives you something to chew on while providing the giggles of an over-caffeinated adolescent. —D.G\n\nWhere to watch Veep: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Anna Chlumsky, Matt Walsh, Tony Hale, Timothy Simons\n\n46 of 50\n\nWatchmen (2019)\n\nQuite possibly the best thing to have Damon Lindelof's name on it, this adaptation of Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel redeems the much-derided 2009 movie. In a world where superheroes have been outlawed, the eponymous vigilantes struggle to fight for what's right. Featuring yet another terrific performance by Jean Smart, along with wonderful Emmy-winning turns by Regina King and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Watchmen sucker-punched audiences with its potent blend of popcorn entertainment and social commentary. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Watchmen: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Regina King, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jean Smart, Don Johnson, Jeremy Irons\n\n47 of 50\n\nThe West Wing (1999–2006)\n\nThe show that single-handedly revitalized walking and talking in hallways, Aaron Sorkin's whip-smart dramedy follows the president (Martin Sheen) and his White House staffers. The West Wing fashions a world of politics we all wish was real. Sure, there are disagreements, but it's nothing a quickly delivered, inspired monologue can't handle. Plus, everyone looks so damn handsome doing it. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The West Wing: Max\n\nCast: Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Richard Schiff\n\n48 of 50\n\nThe White Lotus (2021–present)\n\nMike White's series about privileged vacationers descending on a gorgeous but unlucky locale is predominantly spoken of for Jennifer Coolidge's involvement, but it must be said that each season is one of the finest ensemble drama/comedy/mystery mash-ups in recent memory. Plus, the scenery can't be beat. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The White Lotus: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Jennifer Coolidge, Murray Bartlett, Connie Britton, Alexandra Daddario, Jake Lacy, Natasha Rothwell, Sydney Sweeney, F. Murray Abraham, Meghann Fahy, Michael Imperioli, Theo James, Haley Lu Richardson, Will Sharpe\n\n49 of 50\n\nWinning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty (2022–2023)\n\nAdam McKay's propulsive, imaginative series about the rise of the Lakers under Jerry Buss is a spirited recollection of the period. It's brilliantly shot to evoke its era, features some of John C Reilly's most nuanced work, and is sorely missed in the wake of its premature cancellation. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty: Max\n\nCast: John C. Reilly, Quincy Isaiah, Gaby Hoffmann, Jason Clarke, Adrien Brody, Rob Morgan, Jason Segel, Sally Field"
