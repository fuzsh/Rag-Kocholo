        "text": "Herbert Edelman, a Brooklyn-born character actor best known for his portrayal of archetypal New Yorkers, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 62 and lived in Oxnard, Calif.\n\nThe cause was emphysema, his family said.\n\nMr. Edelman studied acting at Brooklyn College, and headed straight for the stage after graduating. He made his professional debut in 1961 with a touring company of the Brecht-Weill musical \"The Threepenny Opera,\" taking the part of Walt Dreary. He appeared in both the Broadway production and the film version of \"Barefoot in the Park,\" and in the musical \"Bajour.\"\n\nHe was cast in \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad\" in Boston and toured in \"Carnival\" and in Murray Schisgal's \"Luv.\" He also had a featured role in the 1968 film \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!\" with Peter Sellers.\n\nHe was in a long roster of television series, most notably the situation comedy \"The Golden Girls,\" in which he played Bea Arthur's former husband, a role that brought him an Emmy nomination, and in \"Murder She Wrote.\""
