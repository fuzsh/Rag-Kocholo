        "text": "The cast of Friends is honoring the memory of costar Matthew Perry, who died this weekend at 54 years old.\n\nPerry, who played Chandler Bing on the iconic sitcom, was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home on Saturday afternoon, law enforcement officers confirmed to several outlets, including the Los Angeles Times. An official cause of death has not been provided.\n\nWarner Bros., which produced Friends, issued a statement about the star in response to the news. “We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry,” it reads. “Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.”\n\nFriends cast members and guest stars have taken to social media to mourn the shocking loss. Below, see all of their heartfelt tributes so far.\n\nMaggie Wheeler\n\nThe actor—who played Chandler's on-and-off girlfriend Janice Hosenstein throughout the sitcom's 10-season run—posted a still from the series in which she and Perry stand arm in arm.\n\n“What a loss,” she wrote. “The world will miss you Mathew Perry. The joy you brought to so many in your too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared. ♥️”\n\nMorgan Fairchild\n\nFairchild—who played Chandler’s mom on the sitcom—shared an image from the episode “The One with Monica and Chandler’s Wedding.”\n\n“I’m heartbroken about the untimely death of my ‘son,’ Matthew Perry. The loss of such a brilliant young actor is a shock. I’m sending love & condolences to his friends & family, especially his dad, John Bennett Perry, who I worked with on Flamingo Road & Falcon Crest. #RIPMatthew.”\n\nKathleen Turner\n\nKathleen Turner, who played Helena Handbasket, Chandler’s transgender father, on Friends, is also mourning her onscreen child’s passing.\n\nThe actor told People that she is “very sad for Matthew” and remembered a sweet moment they shared. “He came to see one of my Broadway shows and he came backstage,” Turner recalled. “When he saw me, he yelled out, ‘Hey, Dad!’ and everyone thought it was pretty cool. I think it was for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”\n\nThough the last time Turner saw Perry was at least 10 years ago, she said she always liked him. “He had a good sense of humor and a good heart. He liked other people, which, to me, is terribly important, especially for an actor.”\n\nHank Azaria\n\nAzaria was a recurring guest star on Friends as Phoebe Buffay’s on-and-off love interest David (the scientist guy).\n\nOver the years, Azaria and Perry became very close, and Azaria said Perry greatly helped him deal with his own battle with addiction—even taking Azaria to his first AA meeting. Upon learning of Perry’s death, Azaria shared a heartfelt video tribute to his friend on Instagram, in which he recalled the great times they had together, and what a genuine, loving person Perry was when he was sober.\n\nCalling Perry his “first friend” in Los Angeles, Azaria praised the comedian, saying that they were “really more like brothers for a long time.”\n\n\"We drank a lot together, and we laughed a lot together. We were there for each other in the early days of our career,” Azaria said. “He was as funny as he was on Friends and on other things too, in person he was just the funniest man ever.”\n\nAzaria noted that Perry was a comedic genius and “lived to laugh.” The only thing he wishes, he said, is that Perry had found it in himself to remain sober, and that the world had gotten to see more of him.\n\nSee the emotional post here.\n\nElliot Gould\n\nElliot Gould, who played Ross and Monica Geller's father, and Chandler Bing's father-in-law, in Friends, remembered Perry warmly in an Instagram post. “I was saddened to hear the news about Matthew Perry‘s passing,” he wrote next to a throwback photo of them together. “I first met Matthew in 1994 when I joined the NBC sitcom Friends. Matthew was kind, thoughtful, smart, funny, and just a terrifically, talented actor. Matthew told me he was so honored to be working with me. What he didn’t know until I told him, was that it was my privilege to play his father-in-law. My heart goes out to his wonderful family. He will be missed by so many but he will never be forgotten.”\n\nAisha Tyler\n\nThe actress played Ross Geller's short-term, fellow paleontologist girlfriend, Charlie Wheeler, in the sitcom. Upon Perry's death, she shared a message on Instagram in his honor. “He had a gentleness and generosity of spirit that was unparalleled,” she wrote next to a black-and-white photo of Perry. “I learned how to tell a joke perfectly just by watching him work. And I will never forget the moment he leaned in, on my first night of taping Friends, to tell me warmly, 'get ready for your life to change.' Rest well, Matthew Perry. Thank you for the kindness and laughter. 🫶🏾💫”\n\nApart from his Friends cast members, other former costars and fans of Perry have paid tribute to the late actor, including Say Anything costar Ione Skye and singer Charlie Puth. Skye shared a throwback photo of herself with Perry, as well as a screenshot of their last text conversation. Meanwhile, Puth, a longtime Chandler Bing fan, honored the actor by singing the Friends theme song at one of his concerts."
