        "text": "There’s nothing quite like a Shakespearean romance modernised by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Add some ‘90s heartthrobs, like Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and you’re in for a treat.\n\nCase and point, the 1996 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nAnd given the film’s 25-year anniversary, it’s got us thinking: what are cast up to now?\n\nHere’s a look at what the original stars have been up to since.\n\nWatch: the trailer for Romeo and Juliet, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via 20th Century Fox.\n\nClaire Danes (Juliet).\n\nAt just 13, Natalie Portman was originally cast to play Juliet. Technically, Juliet is 13 in the play, but alongside a 21-year-old DiCaprio as Romeo, it didn’t look right.\n\n“Fox said it looked like Leonardo was molesting me when we kissed,” Portman told the New York Times.\n\nSo, Claire Danes did a screen test and the rest is history.\n\n“She’s a really mature girl for her age,” DiCaprio told Entertainment Weekly of Danes in 1996. “She was the only girl when we did the audition who came straight in my face to do the lines. [They were] not nearly as truthful as Claire’s performance.”\n\nThere were rumours the main stars didn't get along off-screen, but in 2015, Danes said there was a “spark” between her and DiCaprio and the two didn’t know how to handle it. She said they sometimes ignored each other on set because of this.\n\n“It was too big for us to really accept,” she said according to Glamour.\n\nDanes has maintained a steady career since, with a role on Homeland from 2011 to 2020 and in films Les Misérables, The Hours, The Family Stone and Temple Grandin.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (Romeo).\n\nDiCaprio was barely in his 20s when filming Romeo and Juliet, and had a typically... 20-year-old attitude towards Shakespeare.\n\n“I can’t say that I was neither here nor there with [Shakespeare]. All I knew was that, just like any other person my age, you hear Shakespeare, and you’re like, ‘oh god, those long-winded plays that you just don’t understand and have no clue about,’” he said in an Access Hollywood interview.\n\nWhen filming the 1996 movie, DiCaprio wasn’t actually that well known, compared with his co-star Claire Danes.\n\nIn fact, Titanic was only released the following year.\n\nDiCaprio is now arguably one of the most famous actors in Hollywood, renowned for a range of films including The Revenant, Inception, Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wallstreet.\n\nHe has been incredibly vocal on the issue of climate change, especially when it comes to The Great Barrier Reef.\n\nHe is also a big fan of Greta Thunberg!\n\n“It was an honour to spend time with Greta. She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet,” he wrote on Instagram.\n\nDiCaprio worked again with director Baz Luhrmann on the 2013 adaption of The Great Gatsby. But of course, DiCaprio is also very well known for his much younger girlfriends.\n\nJohn Leguizamo (Tybalt).\n\nJohn Leguizamo has had an incredibly varied and successful career.\n\nFilms include Ice Age, Moulin Rouge!, John Wick and Ride Along, and Leguizamo has also worked as a playwright and screenwriter.\n\nThe Colombian-born actor’s career has been characterised by barrier-breaking roles. In recent years, Leguizamo has been focused on projects championing Latin and Black people.\n\nAs he said in a recent interview with AVClub, “how can a child see themselves as a hero if he doesn’t see himself? Latin kids are the least represented in children’s picture books, and we’re the largest ethnic group in America.”\n\nHarold Perrineau (Mercutio).\n\nSince Romeo and Juliet, Perrineau has appeared in the Matrix franchise, Lost, The Best Man, 28 Weeks Later, Zero Dark Thirty, Claws, The Rookie and Sons of Anarchy.\n\nDash Mihok is an American actor.\n\nMajor roles following on from Romeo and Juliet include Silver Linings Playbook, The Day After Tomorrow, Law & Order and Gotham.\n\n“There have been some roles that I’ve done just because I needed to pay my rent that I wasn’t thrilled about, but whether I’m playing the soldier or doing Shakespeare: I can get into it,” Mihok said in an interview with Dujour.\n\nBrian Dennehy (Ted Montague).\n\nBrian Dennehy’s most famous roles were mainly before Romeo and Juliet, some notable ones including First Blood and Cocoon.\n\nSince Romeo and Juliet, Margolyes’ career continued to skyrocket.\n\nNotable roles include Professor Sprout throughout the Harry Potter franchise and appearances on Call the Midwife and Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries.\n\nShe also has her own show on the ABC, Miriam Margolyes: Almost Australian, which follows her on a 10,000km two-month journey across Australia, where she shares some pretty iconic opinions.\n\nListen to No Filter: In this conversation, Miriam talks about coming out as gay to her Jewish parents in the 1960s, why she and her partner live in different countries and body image.\n\nMargolyes has been in a long-term relationship with her partner Heather Sutherland since 1968. Margolyes’ connection with Australia is through her partner.\n\nPaul Sorvino (Fulgencio Capulet).\n\nPaul Sorvino is an American actor, opera singer, businessman, writer, and sculptor.\n\nRecently he has been seen on Godfather of Harlem, Bad Blood and The Goldbergs.\n\nSorvino’s most recognisable roles continue to be in Law & Order and Goodfellas.\n\nThe actor’s daughter, Mira Sorvino, spoke to The New Yorker during The Time’s Up Movement. She was one of the many women who accused Harvey Weinstein of inappropriate conduct, Weinstein later sentenced to 23 years in prison over rape and sexual assault convictions.\n\nMost would recognise Pickles from her role on Friends, as Monica and Ross’ mother Judy Geller. So, fans were thrilled to see her earlier this year at the Friends reunion show with Elliott Gould, her on-screen husband as well.\n\nAmazingly, Pickles won her first Emmy award at the age of 83 in 2018 for Break a Hip.\n\n“I’ve sat in an audience six times with my little speech, which I’ve never gotten to give. I was used to being rejected. This time I wasn’t,” she said to TV Insider.\n\n“To hear my name I thought, ‘oh God, am I imagining this?’ Cameron [Watson], our writer/director/producer, turned to me and said, ‘you won!’ I leapt to my feet and went up on stage. I was very, very happy.”\n\nPaul Rudd (Count Paris).\n\nThis is 40, Clueless, Ant-Man, Anchorman, The 40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Night at the Museum, The Perks of Being a Wallflower: we could go on and on.\n\nPaul Rudd has evidently had an incredibly brilliant film career since Romeo and Juliet.\n\nWe also know Paul Rudd as one of the nice men in Hollywood. As the New York Times wrote in their 2015 profile on the actor: “one thing you always hear about Rudd is that he is ‘likeable’.”\n\nBehind his fame is a man who lives a pretty quiet life compared with his Hollywood colleagues. From his family to his friendships, you rarely see Rudd in the tabloid press.\n\nRead more: A kidnapping and a much younger Juliet: 14 behind-the-scenes secrets from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nFeature Image: 20th Century Fox + Getty + Mamamia.\n\nLove the joy of Christmas?
