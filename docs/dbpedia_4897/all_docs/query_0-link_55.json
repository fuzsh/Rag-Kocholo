        "text": "Anna Maria Chlumsky (; born December 3, 1980) is an American actress. She began acting as a child, and first became known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the film My Girl (1991) and its sequel, My Girl 2. Following her early roles, she went on hiatus from 1999 to 2005 to attend college.\n\nChlumsky returned to acting with roles in several independent films, including Blood Car (2007) and In the Loop (2009). She portrayed Amy Brookheimer on the HBO television series Veep (2012–2019), which earned her six nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, among other accolades.\n\nEarly life\n\nChlumsky was born in Chicago, the daughter of Nancy (née Zuncic, a singer, actress, and former flight attendant) and Frank Chlumsky Jr. (a chef and saxophonist). She was raised in a Catholic family, and is of Czech and Croatian descent.\n\nCareer\n\nChlumsky entered show business at an early age, modeling with her mother in an advertising campaign; it was her lead roles in My Girl (1991) and My Girl 2 (1994) that earned her praise for her acting. Her initial film role was a bit part in the family comedy Uncle Buck (1989), starring John Candy and her eventual My Girl co-star Macaulay Culkin. She also appeared in Trading Mom (1994) with Sissy Spacek, and in Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain (1995) with Christina Ricci. Throughout the 1990s, Chlumsky starred in several films and TV series.\n\nChlumsky took a break from acting to attend the University of Chicago, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies in 2002. After college, she was hired as a fact-checker for the Zagat Survey and moved to New York City, which was followed by a position as an editorial assistant for a HarperCollins science fiction-fantasy imprint. However, she felt her career in the publishing industry was lackluster and unsatisfying, and ultimately returned to acting after she completed formal training at the Atlantic Acting School in Manhattan.\n\nChlumsky appeared as Mary Calvin in a 2007 episode of Law & Order; and as Lisa Klein in 2010 episode. She appeared in the 30 Rock episode \"The Fighting Irish\" as Liz Lemler, a romantic rival of protagonist Liz Lemon, who receives flowers meant for Lemler. Chlumsky was in four episodes of the ABC dramedy Cupid in 2009. Later that year, she starred in the Lifetime movie 12 Men of Christmas as Jan Lucas.\n\nShe starred in the Off Broadway production of Unconditional by Brett C. Leonard at The Public Theater, which opened in February 2008; it was produced by the LAByrinth Theater Company. She also starred in Lanford Wilson's Balm in Gilead in 2005 at the American Theatre of Actors in New York City.\n\nIn 2009, she appeared in Armando Iannucci's BBC Films political satire In The Loop, co-starring with Peter Capaldi, Tom Hollander, Chris Addison, James Gandolfini, and Mimi Kennedy, a quasi-spinoff of Iannucci's BBC TV series The Thick of It. She plays Liza, a State Department assistant in the movie.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2019, Chlumsky played Amy Brookheimer, aide to Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character in HBO's Veep, also produced by Iannucci. In June 2012, she starred in the world premiere of David Adjmi's 3C at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in New York.\n\nDan Aykroyd, who played her father in the two My Girl films, has said that a script for a third film has been in development since 2003. In 2012, Chlumsky \"put to rest\" any rumors that such a film was in development. In addition to her role on Veep, Chlumsky has appeared in multiple television series between 2011 and 2013, including White Collar, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and NBC's adaptation of Hannibal.\n\nChlumsky has appeared on Broadway in You Can't Take It with You, and beginning in 2015 as editor Iris Peabody in the comedy Living on Love, with Renee Fleming, Jerry O'Connell and Douglas Sills.\n\nIn 2017, Chlumsky appeared in the fourth season of AMC Networks' Halt and Catch Fire as Dr. Katie Herman, the love interest of Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy).\n\nChlumsky had a main role alongside Julia Garner in Shonda Rhimes' Netflix limited drama series Inventing Anna. Chlumsky voices Charlotte Pickles in the 2021 Paramount+ revival of Rugrats.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn October 2007, Chlumsky announced her engagement to Army Reserve member Shaun So, who also served a tour of duty in Afghanistan. They met as students at the University of Chicago in 2000. They married on March 8, 2008, in Brooklyn, and have two daughters, born July 2013 and August 2016.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1989 Uncle Buck School Child Small Role 1991 My Girl Vada Sultenfuss 1994 My Girl 2 Trading Mom Elizabeth Martin 1995 Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain Jody Salerno 2005 Wait Cara Short film 2007 Blood Car Lorraine 2008 Eavesdrop Chelsea 2009 In the Loop Liza Weld The Good Guy Lisa My Sweet Misery Chloe 2010 Civil Unions: A Love Story Unnamed Short film 2011 The Pill Nelly 2012 Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship Sabrina 2015 The End of the Tour Sarah 2019 Hala Shannon Taylor 2022 They/Them Molly Erickson / Angie Phelps TBA Bride Hard Post-production\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 A Child's Wish Missy Chandler Television film Miracle in the Woods Gina Weatherby / Field Pea 1998 Cupid Jill Episode: \"Meat Market\" Early Edition Megan Clark Episode: \"Teen Angels\" 2007 Eight Days a Week Riley McGann Unaired series 30 Rock Liz Lemler Episode: \"The Fighting Irish\" 2007\n\n2010 Law & Order Mary Calvin,\n\nLisa Klein \"Charity Case\"\n\n\"Innocence\" 2009 House Rules Scotty Fisher Television film Cupid Josie 4 episodes; reworking of original Cupid series 12 Men of Christmas Jan Lucas Television film 2010 The Quinn-tuplets Rachel Quinn Unsold pilot Covert Affairs Vivian Long Episode: \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" 2011 Lights Out Charlie Episodes: \"Headgames\", \"The Shot\" Three Weeks, Three Kids Jennifer Mills Television film White Collar Agent Melissa Matthews Episodes: \"Where There's a Will\", \"Countdown\" 2012–2019 Veep Amy Brookheimer 65 episodes;\n\nMain role (Seasons 1–7) 2012 Army Wives Jessica Anderson Episode: \"Tough Love\" Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Jocelyn Paley Episode: \"Twenty-Five Acts\" 2013–2014 Hannibal Miriam Lass 4 episodes 2016 Robot Chicken Kelly / Nurse (voice) Episode: \"Western Hay Batch\" 2017 Halt and Catch Fire Dr. Katie Herman 5 episodes 2021 Rugrats Charlotte Pickles (voice) Main role 2022 Inventing Anna Vivian Kent Main role\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Association Category Work Result Ref. 1991 Chicago Film Critics Association Most Promising Actress My Girl Nominated MTV Movie Awards Best Kiss (shared with Macaulay Culkin) Won Best On-Screen Duo (shared with Culkin) Nominated Young Artist Awards Most Promising Young Newcomer Won 1994 Best Performance by a Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture My Girl 2 Won 1995 Best Young Leading Actress – Feature Film Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain Won 1997 Best Performance in a TV Movie/Pilot/Mini-Series – Leading Young Actress A Child's Wish Nominated 1998 Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series – Guest Starring Young Actress Cupid Won 2012 Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Veep Nominated 2013 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Nominated 2014 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Nominated 2015 Gracie Awards Outstanding Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Comedy or Musical Won Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Nominated 2016 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Critics' Choice Television Awards Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Nominated 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated Online Film & Television Association Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Won 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated\n\nSee also"
