        "text": "Christina Pickles (born February 17, 1935) is an English actress, best known for her long-running role of Nurse Helen Rosenthal in the hospital drama St. Elsewhere, for which she was nominated for four Emmys.[1]\n\nLife and career\n\nChristina Pickles was born in Yorkshire, England. She is the niece of radio presenter Wilfred Pickles and the sister of judge James Pickles. Her niece Carolyn Pickles is also an actress.[2]\n\nShe has appeared in such television shows as Roseanne, Matlock, Diagnosis: Murder and Murder, She Wrote, as well as the soap operas The Guiding Light and Another World, though it was her role in the NBC medical drama St. Elsewhere (1982 - 1988) with which she is most identified. She remained on St. Elsewhere for its entire six-year run, and was nominated for four Emmy awards for her work on the series.\n\nPickles played the mother of Harmon Rabb, in the television series, \"JAG\". She also appeared as \"Judy Geller\", the mother of Ross and Monica Geller, in the U.S. sitcom Friends, making appearances throughout the ten-year run of the series and receiving an Emmy nomination for her role in 1995.\n\nPickles has appeared in many films including Masters of the Universe, Rush It, The Wedding Singer, Sol Goode and George of the Jungle 2. She also appeared in 1994's Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love as Tippy. However, of all her film work, she is probably best remembered Caroline Montague in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. She also voiced Elsie the Elasmosaurus in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island. She also appeared on the show How I Met Your Mother as Lily Aldrin's grandmother in 2009 and 2011. On radio Pickles is a frequent guest on the public radio program Selected Shorts. She was romantically linked with actor Herb Edelman (who played her onscreen significant other on St. Elsewhere), from the mid-1980s until his death.\n\nReferences\n\nChristina Pickles at the Internet Movie Database\n\nOfficial website"
