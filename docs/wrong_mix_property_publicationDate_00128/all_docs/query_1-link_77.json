        "text": "I read A Night Without Stars (the second and closing Chronicle of the Fallers book), and thought it was also good, but not as good as the first.\n\nYears ago I read his short stories collection A Second Chance at Eden and was impressed.\n\nThat's about it! I should read some more of his, but as you know there's always other books to be read.\n\nThe Abyss Beyond Dreams is actually a pretty poor place to start. Pandoras Star/Judas Unchained is where the Commonwealth books start, and hence the best book to read first. Then follow that up with the Void Trilogy before getting to The Abyss Beyond Dreams. Events in previous books are often referenced and will make a lot more sense to you if you have already read them.\n\nOr if you want to start somewhere else entirely, read The Reality Dysfunction. First book in an unrelated trilogy. I actually liked this series more.\n\n^^ Hamilton himself said of The Abyss Beyond Dreams \"I wrote it in such a way that someone coming fresh to my work could pick it up and not be totally lost in references as to what happened before.\" I did this and had no problems understanding the story.\n\nThat said, my opinion's limited on where to start with him as I've only read 3 of his books.\n\nI too started with A Second Chance at Eden, and loved it, especially the opening story Sonnie's Edge, and the last, Escape Route. Next I found a copy of Judas Unchained in a Pattaya second-hand bookshop, and dived right in. After a while I realised it was a sequel, so I put it down until I'd acquired and read Pandora's Star. Since then I've read all of Hamilton's output, some books twice or more. My favourite is the sometimes maligned Great North Road. Not to everyone's taste, it appears! It has a very strong female character, as do many of Hamilton's novels; look out for the amazing Paula Myo in the Commonwealth books.\n\nHamilton's word is split between several different universes which are unrelated to one another:\n\nThe Greg Mandel Universe\n\nThe Greg Mandel Trilogy: Mindstar Rising, A Quantum Murder, The Nanoflower\n\nThe Night's Dawn Universe\n\nA Second Chance at Eden (short story collection)\n\nThe Night's Dawn Trilogy: The Reality Dysfunction, The Neutronium Alchemist, The Naked God\n\nThe Commonwealth Universe\n\nMisspent Youth (stand-alone)\n\nThe Commonwealth Saga: Pandora's Star, Judas Unchained\n\nThe Void Trilogy: The Dreaming Void, The Temporal Void, The Evolutionary Void\n\nThe Chronicle of the Fallers: The Abyss Beyond Dreams, Night Without Stars\n\nStand-Alone Works\n\nFallen Dragon\n\nGreat North Road\n\nManhattan in Reverse (short story collection, including a couple set in the Commonwealth universe)\n\nYou can read any of the stand-alones, or start with Mindstar Rising, A Second Chance at Eden, Misspent Youth (this isn't his best novel, so I'd say skip it) or Pandora's Star. My main recommendation would be The Reality Dysfunction, as, despite it's imposing size, I think it's his best novel.\n\nSomething to consider that people here have not mentioned.\n\nThe Greg Mandel Universe is Noir set in the future.\n\nThe Night's Dawn and Commonwealth are space opera. Commonwealth is extreme far future with tech that might as well be magic. I haven't read the other in a while.\n\nGreat North Road is a police procedural set in the future.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what to call Fallen Dragon.\n\nBut there's a definite genre split in Hamilton's work that should be considered in light of personal preferences.\n\nThank you so much for all of the feedback guys. I had started to read a bit of The Abyss Beyond Dreams, then decided to stop and read Pandora's Star first instead. I'm a bit over 100 pages in and loving it so far!\n\nVery good choice.. I was going to recommend to start with Pandora's Star. It got me into Hamilton and I guess you can say the wider world of science fiction, as well. I think I'd rank it in his top 3 of all time."
