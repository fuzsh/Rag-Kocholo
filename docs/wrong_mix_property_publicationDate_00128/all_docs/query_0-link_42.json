        "text": "Earning comparisons to such sci-fi/fantasy greats as Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov, and George R. R. Martin, Peter F. Hamilton is a one-of-a-kind voice in space opera. His interstellar adventures are hugely ambitious, wildly entertaining, and philosophically stimulating. Now Hamiltonâs centuries-spanning Commonwealth Sagaâthe linked novels Pandoraâs Star and Judas Unchainedâis available in one epic eBook bundle.\n\nÂ\n\nContains a thrilling preview of Peter F. Hamiltonâs upcoming novel, The Abyss Beyond Dreams, set in the same universe as the Commonwealth Saga.\n\nÂ\n\nPANDORAâS STAR\n\nJUDAS UNCHAINED\n\nÂ\n\n2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars, contains more than six hundred worlds interconnected by a web of transport âtunnelsâ known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: over one thousand light-years away, a star . . . disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, the Second Chance, a faster-than-light starship commanded by Wilson Kime, a five-times-rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat.\n\nÂ\n\nOpposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood. Shortly after the journey begins, Kime wonders if the crew of the Second Chance has been infiltrated. But soon enough he will have other worries. Halfway across the galaxy, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth . . . and humanity itself.\n\nÂ\n\nPraise for the Commonwealth Saga\n\nÂ\n\nPandoraâs Star\n\nÂ\n\nâShould be high on everyoneâs reading list . . . You wonât be able to put it down.ââNancy Pearl, NPR\n\nÂ\n\nâAn imaginative and stunning tale of the perfect future threatened . . . a book of epic proportions not unlike Frank Herbertâs Dune or Isaac Asimovâs Foundation trilogy.ââSFRevu\n\nÂ\n\nâRecommended . . . A large cast of characters, each with his own story, brings depth and variety to this far-future saga.ââLibrary Journal\n\nÂ\n\nJudas Unchained\n\nÂ\n\nâAn interstellar suspense thriller . . . sweeping in scope and emotional range.ââSan Antonio Express-News\n\nÂ\n\nâHamilton tackles SF the way George R. R. Martin is tackling fantasy. . . . Thereâs a sense of wonder here thatâs truly unchained.ââSF Reviews\n\nÂ\n\nâRichly satisfying . . . wonderfully imagined . . . Hamilton adroitly leaps from the struggles of one engaging, quirky character to another.ââPublishers Weekly (starred review)"
