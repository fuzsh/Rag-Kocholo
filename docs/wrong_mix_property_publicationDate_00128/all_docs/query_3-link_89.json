        "text": "I am very excited about the new book since Peter Hamilton is one of my top 3 established sf&f authors by far (alongside Weber and Bujold with N. Asher coming strongly at #4) and I own all of his books, most in hc, some in double editions hc and pb.\n\nNight's Dawn remains my favorite overall and probably my favorite series of all time (though on the same par with HH by Weber, Miles by Bujold and 163* by Flint and co but all of these are still ongoing), just for sheer panorama, though I liked and reread many times pretty much all his books.\n\nUntil now though large scale his space opera was still an extension of the present, so I am very curious how the new series set up so far in the future will be, though from the excerpt, I expect it will be good. Also I am eager for the stories in the DV universe, first one to appear in the New Space Opera anthology that will be published in several days. That book is also a must from the authors list, so I will read it as soon as available.\n\nYes, will do, Mith; I'm about two thirds through reading.\n\nIn brief: So far, so good: some interesting developments from the two previous (and some intriguing links!).\n\nIf you like Peter's previous books, I can't see why you won't like this one; as the style is no different. All the usual Hamilton touches: lots of characters, widescreen views (both inside and outside the Void); inside the Void reads in a lot of ways like a Fantasy novel, with it's rural/quasi-medieval imagery (but with some very important SF touches). Would be interesting to see Peter write a Fantasy novel, based on this, though this is clearly SF. The counterview is the life in the Commonwealth, with all of its future cultures and weaponry.\n\nNegatives: Those who don't like Peter's style though may not as impressed. And I'm very aware that Peter's endings can sometimes be a let down for me.(Guess I'll see!) Not to mention that I didn't like the character of Ozzie as much as some; Peter himself told me he was a difficult character to write in Pandora's/Judas, and was completely rewritten from what he started as. Getting used to the common use of phrases like 'For Ozzie's sake!' or 'For the love of Ozzie' takes some getting used to.\n\nHobbit\n\nJust got the New Space Opera anthology and first read Mr. Hamilton \"prequel\" to Dreaming Void, the short story Blessed by an Angel and it's absolutely brilliant.\n\nHumanity is now split in 2 (about 700 years from the original novels), the \"higher\" humans in the core worlds, have everything material assured by replicators and bionomics inside their bodies, so they dedicate themselves to thought, hence they are called \"angels\" by the \"regular\" humanity on the external worlds which prefer a regular physical mode of existence, still have economic worries and so on, this culture being called The Advancer (a more sophisticated form of the Commonwealth culture of the earlier novels) and of course 10's of millions of advancers convert somewhat imperfectly to higher per year, since to be truly higher you gotta be born that way.\n\nMost angels are content to let the regular humans live their lives, but there are some who try to actively convert regular humans, and they come covertly to various worlds where an Advancer organization called The Protectorate hunt them down since they oppose what they see as \"forced\" conversions...\n\nEnter a somewhat decaying advancer world settled in the aftermath of the Starflyer war, one such rogue angel, some dizzy teenagers and a protector team, and you got a story...\n\nWhetted my appetite for The Dreaming Void...\n\nThe whole anthology looks great by the way with many interesting stories."
