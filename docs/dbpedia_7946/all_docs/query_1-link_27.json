        "text": "Theater has the power to entertain, but it also has the power to shed light on some of the most difficult situations and subject matter of the human condition.\n\nThatâs what actor Chris Sarandon hopes to get across to West Virginia University theater students and the local community when he returns to the Creative Arts Center Sept. 17-19 to present staged readings of the play âNot Someone Like Me,â by Susan Rice, a collection of monologues about the real experiences of women who have been physically and sexually assaulted and how they continue to cope with the aftermaths of their attacks.\n\nThe readings, directed by Sarandon, will take place Sept. 18 and 19 at 7:30 p.m. in the Creative Arts Centerâs Antoinette Falbo Theatre.\n\nFollowing each performance, Sarandon and the cast will also take part in a âtalk backâ with Deborah Beazley, program coordinator for WVUâs Sexual Assault Prevention Program.\n\nBoth the readings and the talk backs are free and open to the public.\n\nSarandon is the first College of Creative Arts alumnus to take part in the collegeâs new Alumni Residency Series, in which noted alumni of the schools of art and design, music, and theatre and dance will return to work with students.\n\nThe play he is bringing to WVU is one he has been working for several years to bring to the attention of the public.\n\nâI donât think itâs possible to overemphasize just how pervasive sexual assault is in our culture,â Sarandon said.\n\nâAs one of the storytellers in the show says, âthe silence of survivors is supported by a collective anxiety about rapeâa crime so shameful that its victims are made mute, and those who would listen, deaf.â\n\nâItâs an ugly secret and we hope through bringing this show to colleges and advocacy groups across the United States we will shed light on this difficult subject and hopefully promote change.â\n\nSarandonâs involvement with the project began when playwright Susan Rice, a longtime friend and colleague of Sarandon and his wife, actress Joanna Gleason, approached them with the idea of adapting excerpts from the 2004 HBO documentary film, âRape in a Small Town: The Florence Holway Story,â into a play.\n\nThe play Rice wrote soon grew to include source material from the book âAfter Silenceâ by Nancy Raine, as well as transcripts of interviews with other sexual assault survivors.\n\nRice asked Sarandon to direct the production and he has been actively involved with it since the beginning, seeing it go through many stages of development, including a reading at New York Theatre Workshop.\n\nThe performance at the WVU Creative Arts Center will be the first time it has been presented at a university. The cast will include students and faculty members from the Studio Acting Program in the School of Theatre and Dance.\n\nSarandon, an alumnus of that school, was named to the Academy of Distinguished Alumni at WVU in 1998. Born and raised in Beckley, West Virginia, he earned a degree in speech and drama at WVU, graduating magna cum laude in 1964.\n\nHe may be best known for playing Prince Humperdinck in âThe Princess Bride,â as well as for his role as the vampire Jerry Dandridge in âFright Nightâ and Detective Mike Norris in the first entry of the âChildâs Playâ Series. He also provided the speaking voice of Jack Skellington in âThe Nightmare Before Christmas.â\n\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the 1975 film âDog Day Afternoonâ with Al Pacino.\n\nHe first became interested in acting as a student at WVU, where he performed in productions of âJulius Caesar,â âTartuffeâ âLittle Mary Sunshineâ and as Romeo in âRomeo and Juliet.â His mentor was WVU theater professor emeritus Charles Neel.\n\nFollowing his graduation from WVU, he earned his masterâs degree in theater from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.\n\nOver the years, his work as an actor has included work in regional theater, television, primetime TV movies and major films. In addition to âDog Day Afternoon,â he appeared in the thriller âLipstickâ (1976) with Margaux Hemingway, âThe Osterman Weekendâ (1983) with Dennis Hopper, and âProtocolâ (1984) with Goldie Hawn.\n\nHe has appeared on Broadway, as well as making regular appearances at Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw festivals in the United States and Canada.\n\nHis work on television has included recurring roles on the long-running medical drama âER,â as well as âThe Practice,â âCharmed,â and âJudging Amy.â More recently he has appeared as a guest star on âLaw and Order: Special Victims Unitâ and âThe Good Wife.â\n\nThe staged readings of âNot Someone Like Meâ will be in the Antoinette Falbo Theatre at the WVU Creative Arts Center, Sept. 18 and 19 at 7:30pm, with talk backs following each performance. Admission is free.\n\nThe show includes graphic details of sexual assault. Parental guidance is suggested.\n\nFor more information, visit theatre.wvu.edu, call 304-293-2020, or email theatre@mail.wvu.edu.\n\n-WVU-\n\nsf/9/8/14\n\nCONTACT: Charlene Lattea, College of Creative Arts\n\n304-293-4359, Charlene.Lattea@mail.wvu.edu\n\nFollow @WVUToday on Twitter."
