        "meta_description": "Susan Sarandon\n\tA text from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\n\tSusan Sarandon (born October 4, 1946) is an American actress. She has worked in films and television since 1969, and won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the 1995 film Dead Man Walking. She had also been nominated for the award for four films before that and has received other recognition for her work. She is also noted for her social and political activism for a variety of liberal causes.\n\t\n\tEarly life\n\t\n\tSarandon, the eldest of nine children in a Roman Catholic[1] family, was born as Susan Abigail Tomalin in New York City, as the daughter of Leonora Marie (née Criscione) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin (26 September 1917 – 26 March 1999), who worked as an advertising executive, television producer, and nightclub singer during the big band era.[2][3] Sarandon's father was of English, Irish and Welsh ancestry, and her Italian American mother's ancestors emigrated from the regions of Tuscany and Sicily.[2][4][5] Sarandon attended Roman Catholic schools.[1] She grew up in Edison, New Jersey,[6][7] where she graduated from Edison High School in 1964. She then attended The Catholic University of America, from 1964 to 1968, and earned a BA in drama and worked with noted drama coach and master teacher, Father Gilbert V. Hartke.\n\t[edit]Career\n\t\n\tIn 1969, Sarandon went to a casting call for the motion-picture Joe, with her then-husband Chris Sarandon. Although he did not get a part, she was cast in a major role of a disaffected teen, who disappears into the seedy underworld.[clarification needed] (The film was released in 1970). Between the years 1970 and 1972, Sarandon played Patrice Kahlman on the short-lived soap opera A World Apart, and on Search for Tomorrow, in the role of Sarah Fairbanks. She appeared in Fleur bleue (The Apprentice) (1971) and also appeared in Lady Liberty (1971), by Mario Monicelli, opposite Sophia Loren.\n\tIn 1974, she co-starred in The Front Page, with the comedy duo Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and Lovin' Molly with Anthony Perkins. She appeared in the cult favorite musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). That same year, she played the female lead in The Great Waldo Pepper, opposite Robert Redford. In 1978, Sarandon played the mother of a child prostitute, who was played by Brooke Shields, in Pretty Baby.\n\t\n\t\n\tSusan Sarandon's hand and foot prints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre\n\tHer most controversial film appearance[citation needed] was in The Hunger in 1983, a modern vampire story in which she had a lesbian sex scene with Catherine Deneuve. The film was a critical and commercial flop but gained a cult following.[citation needed] Sarandon played one of the leads in the 1987 dark comedy/fantasy film The Witches of Eastwick, opposite Jack Nicholson. Sarandon starred in the 1988 film Bull Durham, which became a huge commercial and critical success. In 1989, she co-starred with Marlon Brando in A Dry White Season.\n\tSarandon received five Academy Award nominations, for best actress, in Atlantic City (1980), Thelma & Louise (1991), Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and The Client (1994). In 1995, she won the award for her performance in Dead Man Walking.[citation needed]\n\tAdditional performances in film include Little Women (1994), Compromising Positions, Stepmom (1998), Anywhere but Here (1999), Cradle Will Rock (1999), The Banger Sisters (2002), Shall We Dance (2004), Alfie (2004), Romance & Cigarettes (2005), Elizabethtown (2005) and Enchanted (2007).\n\tSarandon has appeared in two episodes of The Simpsons, one as herself (\"Bart Has Two Mommies\") and another as a ballet teacher, \"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\". She has made appearances on comedies such as Friends, Malcolm in the Middle, Mad TV, Saturday Night Live, Chappelle's Show, 30 Rock, and Rescue Me.[citation needed]\n\tSarandon has contributed the narration to some two dozen documentary film, many of which dealt with social and political issues;[citation needed] in addition, she has served as the presenter on many installments of the PBS documentary series, Independent Lens. In 2007, she hosted and presented Mythos, a series of lectures by the late American mythology professor Joseph Campbell.[8]\n\tSarandon joined the cast of the adaptation of The Lovely Bones, opposite Rachel Weisz, and appeared with her daughter, Eva Amurri, in Middle of Nowhere; both of the movies were filmed in 2007.[9][10]\n\tIn June 2010, Sarandon joined the cast of new HBO pilot The Miraculous Year. She will play the role of Patty Atwood, a Broadway director/choreographer.[11]\n\t[edit]Personal life\n\t\n\tSarandon began a relationship with fellow college student Chris Sarandon, in 1964, and they married on September 16, 1967.[12] After their separation, Sarandon discussed their relationship in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine in 1978, in which she stated \"I no longer believe in marriage.\"[13] They divorced in 1979 and she retained Sarandon as her stage name.[14]\n\tIn the late 1970s, Sarandon had a two-year relationship with director Louis Malle, who directed her in Pretty Baby and Atlantic City.[12]\n\tIn the mid-1980s, Sarandon dated director Franco Amurri, with whom she had a daughter in 1985, actress Eva Amurri.[14]\n\tFrom 1986 to 2009,[15] Sarandon was in a relationship with actor Tim Robbins, whom she met while she filmed Bull Durham. They had two sons — Jack Henry (born 1989) and Miles Guthrie (born 1992).[14]\n\tSarandon and Robbins often worked together on the same social and political causes. In 2006, Sarandon received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award.[16] She was honored for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, an advocate for victims of hunger and HIV/AIDS and a spokesperson for Heifer International. Sarandon also participates as a member of the Jury for the NYICFF, a local New York City Film Festival that is dedicated to screening films for children between the ages of 3 and 18.[17] In 2006, Sarandon and 10 of her relatives (including her then-partner Tim Robbins and her son Miles) travelled to Wales to trace her family's Welsh genealogy. Their journey was documented by the BBC Wales programme, Coming Home: Susan Sarandon.[5] In 2006, she also received the \"Ragusani nel mondo\" prize, since she had recently discovered her Sicilian roots, in Ragusa, Italy.\n\tOne of her favorite hobbies is playing table tennis. She is involved in a New York Table Tennis Club, Spin; a club that she frequents when she doesn't film.[18]\n\t[edit]Political activism\n\tSarandon is noted for her active support of progressive and left-liberal political causes, ranging from donations made to organizations such as EMILY's List,[19] to participating in a 1983 delegation to Nicaragua sponsored by MADRE, an organization that promotes \"social, environmental and economic justice.\"[20] Sarandon has also expressed support for various human rights causes that are similar philosophically to ideas found among the Christian left.[21]\n\tIn 1995, Sarandon was one of many Hollywood actors, directors and writers who were interviewed for the documentary The Celluloid Closet, which looked at how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In 1999, she was appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In that capacity, she has actively supported the organization's global advocacy, as well as the work of the Canadian UNICEF Committee.\n\t\n\t\n\tSusan Sarandon in April 2007\n\tDuring the 2000 election, Sarandon supported Ralph Nader's run for President, serving as a co-chair of the National Steering Committee of Nader 2000.[22]\n\tDuring the 2004 election campaign, she withheld support for Nader's bid, being among several \"Nader 2000 Leaders\" who signed a petition that urged voters to vote for Democratic Party candidate John Kerry.[23] After the 2004 election, Sarandon called for US elections to be monitored by international entities.[24]\n\tSarandon and Robbins both took an early stance against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Sarandon stating that she was firmly against the concept of the war as a pre-emptive strike.[25] Prior to a 2003 protest sponsored by the United for Peace and Justice coalition, she said that many Americans \"do not want to risk their children or the children of Iraq\".[26] Sarandon was one of the first to appear in a series of political ads sponsored by TrueMajority, an organization established by Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream founder Ben Cohen.[27][28] Also in 2003, Sarandon appeared in a \"Love is Love is Love\" commercial, which promoted the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n\tIn 2004, she served on the advisory committee for the group 2004 Racism Watch.[29] She hosted a section of the Live 8 concert in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2005. In 2006, she was one of eight women who were selected to carry in the Olympic flag at the Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games, in Turin, Italy.\n\tAlong with anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Sarandon took part in a 2006 Mother's Day protest, which was sponsored by Code Pink;[30] she has expressed interest in portraying Sheehan in a movie.[31] In January 2007, she appeared with Robbins and Jane Fonda at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. in support of a Congressional measure to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.[32]\n\tIn the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sarandon and Tim Robbins campaigned[33] for John Edwards in the New Hampshire communities of Hampton,[34] Bedford and Dover.[35] When asked at We Vote '08 Kickoff Party \"What would Jesus do this primary season\", Sarandon said, \"I think Jesus would be very supportive of John Edwards.\"[36]\n\tOn March 12, 2011 Susan spoke before a crowd in Madison WI during a protest[37] of Governer Scott Walker and his \"Budget Repair Bill\".\n\t[edit]Filmography\n\t\n\tFilms\n\tYearTitleRoleNotes\n\t1970JoeMelissa Compton\n\t1971Lady LibertySally\n\t1971The ApprenticeElizabeth Hawkinsaka \"Fleur bleue\" (in Canada)\n\t1974Lovin' MollySarah\n\t1974The Front PagePeggy Grant\n\t1975The Great Waldo PepperMary Beth\n\t1975The Rocky Horror Picture ShowJanet Weiss\n\t1976DragonflyChloeaka \"One Summer Love\" (USA: reissue title)\n\t1977Checkered Flag or CrashC.C.

        "text": "Susan Sarandon\n\nA text from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSusan Sarandon (born October 4, 1946) is an American actress. She has worked in films and television since 1969, and won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the 1995 film Dead Man Walking. She had also been nominated for the award for four films before that and has received other recognition for her work. She is also noted for her social and political activism for a variety of liberal causes.\n\nEarly life\n\nSarandon, the eldest of nine children in a Roman Catholic[1] family, was born as Susan Abigail Tomalin in New York City, as the daughter of Leonora Marie (née Criscione) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin (26 September 1917 – 26 March 1999), who worked as an advertising executive, television producer, and nightclub singer during the big band era.[2][3] Sarandon's father was of English, Irish and Welsh ancestry, and her Italian American mother's ancestors emigrated from the regions of Tuscany and Sicily.[2][4][5] Sarandon attended Roman Catholic schools.[1] She grew up in Edison, New Jersey,[6][7] where she graduated from Edison High School in 1964. She then attended The Catholic University of America, from 1964 to 1968, and earned a BA in drama and worked with noted drama coach and master teacher, Father Gilbert V. Hartke.\n\n[edit]Career\n\nIn 1969, Sarandon went to a casting call for the motion-picture Joe, with her then-husband Chris Sarandon. Although he did not get a part, she was cast in a major role of a disaffected teen, who disappears into the seedy underworld.[clarification needed] (The film was released in 1970). Between the years 1970 and 1972, Sarandon played Patrice Kahlman on the short-lived soap opera A World Apart, and on Search for Tomorrow, in the role of Sarah Fairbanks. She appeared in Fleur bleue (The Apprentice) (1971) and also appeared in Lady Liberty (1971), by Mario Monicelli, opposite Sophia Loren.\n\nIn 1974, she co-starred in The Front Page, with the comedy duo Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and Lovin' Molly with Anthony Perkins. She appeared in the cult favorite musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). That same year, she played the female lead in The Great Waldo Pepper, opposite Robert Redford. In 1978, Sarandon played the mother of a child prostitute, who was played by Brooke Shields, in Pretty Baby.\n\nSusan Sarandon's hand and foot prints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre\n\nHer most controversial film appearance[citation needed] was in The Hunger in 1983, a modern vampire story in which she had a lesbian sex scene with Catherine Deneuve. The film was a critical and commercial flop but gained a cult following.[citation needed] Sarandon played one of the leads in the 1987 dark comedy/fantasy film The Witches of Eastwick, opposite Jack Nicholson. Sarandon starred in the 1988 film Bull Durham, which became a huge commercial and critical success. In 1989, she co-starred with Marlon Brando in A Dry White Season.\n\nSarandon received five Academy Award nominations, for best actress, in Atlantic City (1980), Thelma & Louise (1991), Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and The Client (1994). In 1995, she won the award for her performance in Dead Man Walking.[citation needed]\n\nAdditional performances in film include Little Women (1994), Compromising Positions, Stepmom (1998), Anywhere but Here (1999), Cradle Will Rock (1999), The Banger Sisters (2002), Shall We Dance (2004), Alfie (2004), Romance & Cigarettes (2005), Elizabethtown (2005) and Enchanted (2007).\n\nSarandon has appeared in two episodes of The Simpsons, one as herself (\"Bart Has Two Mommies\") and another as a ballet teacher, \"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\". She has made appearances on comedies such as Friends, Malcolm in the Middle, Mad TV, Saturday Night Live, Chappelle's Show, 30 Rock, and Rescue Me.[citation needed]\n\nSarandon has contributed the narration to some two dozen documentary film, many of which dealt with social and political issues;[citation needed] in addition, she has served as the presenter on many installments of the PBS documentary series, Independent Lens. In 2007, she hosted and presented Mythos, a series of lectures by the late American mythology professor Joseph Campbell.[8]\n\nSarandon joined the cast of the adaptation of The Lovely Bones, opposite Rachel Weisz, and appeared with her daughter, Eva Amurri, in Middle of Nowhere; both of the movies were filmed in 2007.[9][10]\n\nIn June 2010, Sarandon joined the cast of new HBO pilot The Miraculous Year. She will play the role of Patty Atwood, a Broadway director/choreographer.[11]\n\n[edit]Personal life\n\nSarandon began a relationship with fellow college student Chris Sarandon, in 1964, and they married on September 16, 1967.[12] After their separation, Sarandon discussed their relationship in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine in 1978, in which she stated \"I no longer believe in marriage.\"[13] They divorced in 1979 and she retained Sarandon as her stage name.[14]\n\nIn the late 1970s, Sarandon had a two-year relationship with director Louis Malle, who directed her in Pretty Baby and Atlantic City.[12]\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Sarandon dated director Franco Amurri, with whom she had a daughter in 1985, actress Eva Amurri.[14]\n\nFrom 1986 to 2009,[15] Sarandon was in a relationship with actor Tim Robbins, whom she met while she filmed Bull Durham. They had two sons — Jack Henry (born 1989) and Miles Guthrie (born 1992).[14]\n\nSarandon and Robbins often worked together on the same social and political causes. In 2006, Sarandon received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award.[16] She was honored for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, an advocate for victims of hunger and HIV/AIDS and a spokesperson for Heifer International. Sarandon also participates as a member of the Jury for the NYICFF, a local New York City Film Festival that is dedicated to screening films for children between the ages of 3 and 18.[17] In 2006, Sarandon and 10 of her relatives (including her then-partner Tim Robbins and her son Miles) travelled to Wales to trace her family's Welsh genealogy. Their journey was documented by the BBC Wales programme, Coming Home: Susan Sarandon.[5] In 2006, she also received the \"Ragusani nel mondo\" prize, since she had recently discovered her Sicilian roots, in Ragusa, Italy.\n\nOne of her favorite hobbies is playing table tennis. She is involved in a New York Table Tennis Club, Spin; a club that she frequents when she doesn't film.[18]\n\n[edit]Political activism\n\nSarandon is noted for her active support of progressive and left-liberal political causes, ranging from donations made to organizations such as EMILY's List,[19] to participating in a 1983 delegation to Nicaragua sponsored by MADRE, an organization that promotes \"social, environmental and economic justice.\"[20] Sarandon has also expressed support for various human rights causes that are similar philosophically to ideas found among the Christian left.[21]\n\nIn 1995, Sarandon was one of many Hollywood actors, directors and writers who were interviewed for the documentary The Celluloid Closet, which looked at how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In 1999, she was appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In that capacity, she has actively supported the organization's global advocacy, as well as the work of the Canadian UNICEF Committee.\n\nSusan Sarandon in April 2007\n\nDuring the 2000 election, Sarandon supported Ralph Nader's run for President, serving as a co-chair of the National Steering Committee of Nader 2000.[22]\n\nDuring the 2004 election campaign, she withheld support for Nader's bid, being among several \"Nader 2000 Leaders\" who signed a petition that urged voters to vote for Democratic Party candidate John Kerry.[23] After the 2004 election, Sarandon called for US elections to be monitored by international entities.[24]\n\nSarandon and Robbins both took an early stance against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Sarandon stating that she was firmly against the concept of the war as a pre-emptive strike.[25] Prior to a 2003 protest sponsored by the United for Peace and Justice coalition, she said that many Americans \"do not want to risk their children or the children of Iraq\".[26] Sarandon was one of the first to appear in a series of political ads sponsored by TrueMajority, an organization established by Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream founder Ben Cohen.[27][28] Also in 2003, Sarandon appeared in a \"Love is Love is Love\" commercial, which promoted the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n\nIn 2004, she served on the advisory committee for the group 2004 Racism Watch.[29] She hosted a section of the Live 8 concert in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2005. In 2006, she was one of eight women who were selected to carry in the Olympic flag at the Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games, in Turin, Italy.\n\nAlong with anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Sarandon took part in a 2006 Mother's Day protest, which was sponsored by Code Pink;[30] she has expressed interest in portraying Sheehan in a movie.[31] In January 2007, she appeared with Robbins and Jane Fonda at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. in support of a Congressional measure to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.[32]\n\nIn the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sarandon and Tim Robbins campaigned[33] for John Edwards in the New Hampshire communities of Hampton,[34] Bedford and Dover.[35] When asked at We Vote '08 Kickoff Party \"What would Jesus do this primary season\", Sarandon said, \"I think Jesus would be very supportive of John Edwards.\"[36]\n\nOn March 12, 2011 Susan spoke before a crowd in Madison WI during a protest[37] of Governer Scott Walker and his \"Budget Repair Bill\".\n\n[edit]Filmography\n\nFilms\n\nYearTitleRoleNotes\n\n1970JoeMelissa Compton\n\n1971Lady LibertySally\n\n1971The ApprenticeElizabeth Hawkinsaka \"Fleur bleue\" (in Canada)\n\n1974Lovin' MollySarah\n\n1974The Front PagePeggy Grant\n\n1975The Great Waldo PepperMary Beth\n\n1975The Rocky Horror Picture ShowJanet Weiss\n\n1976DragonflyChloeaka \"One Summer Love\" (USA: reissue title)\n\n1977Checkered Flag or CrashC.C.

Ela cresceu numa grande família católica de nove filhos. Graduou-se em 1964 pela Edison High School e estudou na Universidade Católica da América, em Washington DC, onde bacharelou-se em Artes.\n\nEnquanto estava na faculdade, Susan conheceu Chris Sarandon, com quem se casou em setembro de 1967. Eles se divorciaram em 1979 e ela continuou a usar \"Sarandon\" como seu nome artístico. Na metade dos anos 80, ela namorou o diretor italiano Franco Amurri, com quem teve uma filha, a atriz Eva Amurri. Também namorou o ator Sean Penn e o diretor Louis Malle.\n\nDesde 1988, Sarandon vive com o ator Tim Robbins, a quem ela conheceu nas filmagens de Bull Durham. O casal teve dois filhos: Jack Henry e Miles Guthrie. Tanto ela quanto Robbins estão envolvidos em causas políticas socialistas.\n\nNo dia 23 de dezembro de 2009, o casal anunciou sua separação, publicada pela revista People.\n\nEm 2003, Susan apareceu no comercial \"Love is Love is Love\", promovendo a aceitação de indivíduos gays, lésbicas e transgêneros.\n\nEm 2005, participou do Live 8, em Edimburgo, na Escócia. Em 2006, participou da cerimônia de abertura dos Jogos Olímpicos de Inverno de 2006.\n\nSarandon e dez de seus parentes, incluindo Tim Robbins e seu filho Miles, viajaram para Gales para obter informações sobre a genealogia galesa de sua família. A jornada foi comentada no programa da BBC de Gales Coming Home: Susan Sarandon.\n\nSusan Sarandon é também uma amiga próxima de Julia Roberts.\n\nFilmografia\n\nA Wikipédia possui o:\n\nPortal Cinema\n\n2009 - The Lovely Bones (Um Olhar do Paraíso)\n\n2008 - Speed Racer\n\n2007 - Mr. Woodcock (Em Pé de Guerra)\n\n2007 - Enchanted (Encantada)\n\n2007 - In the Valley of Elah (No Vale das Sombras)\n\n2006 - Irresistible (Identidade roubada)\n\n2005 - Elizabethtown (Tudo acontece em Elizabethtown)\n\n2004 - Romance & Cigarettes\n\n2004 - A Whale in Montana\n\n2004 - Noel (Anjo de vidro)\n\n2004 - Alfie (Alfie - O sedutor)\n\n2004 - Shall We Dance?
