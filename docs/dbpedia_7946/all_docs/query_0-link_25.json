        "text": "What started out as a $24 million box office failure has turned into one of the most popular cult classic holiday movies of all time. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, a movie that took over 10 years to make, has become an inspiration to millions of people around the world.\n\nBut what does this film have to do with West Virginia?\n\nChris Sarandon was born in Beckley, West Virginia on July 24, 1942. He began acting at young age, performing in plays and musicals throughout his career. Sarandon attended West Virginia University with a major in speech, eventually performing in several plays. He continued his education at Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, earning a Master's degree in theater (IMDb.com, Inc., 2022).\n\nAs an actor, Chris Sarandon has stared in many cult classic movies, such as The Princess Bride, Child's Play, and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. He has also performed on and off Broadway.\n\n​\n\nTo learn more about Chris Sarandon's history, click on the \"Chris Sarandon\" button below.\n\n​\n\nTo read an interview with Chris Sarandon, click the \"interview\" button below.\n\nFrom the creative and twisted mind of Tim Burton, The Nightmare Before Christmas has grown in popularity and recognition since it's creation in 1993. What was once considered a box office flop has now become a classic holiday film that continues to defy the norm.\n\nTim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a dark and fantastical tale of holiday magic and one character's ambition to change the course of Christmas forever. A mixture of stop-motion animation and CGI, the film creates a whimsical contrast between two of the world's most celebrated holidays.\n\n​\n\nTo learn more about the film and its creation,\n\nclick on the button below.\n\nSo, what does Chris Sarandon, WVU Libraries, and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas have in common?\n\nWVU graduate Chris Sarandon donated scripts, movie posters, VHS tapes, and more to the West Virginia & Regional History Center at WVU.
