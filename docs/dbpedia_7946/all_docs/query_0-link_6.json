Her career, spanning over five decades, boasts a remarkable range of roles that have earned her critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for Dead Man Walking. Raised in Edison, New Jersey, Sarandon began her acting journey with soap operas in the early 1970s. However, it was her role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1975 that catapulted her to stardom.

She has been vocal about numerous political and social issues, contributing to causes such as anti-war movements, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental conservation. Despite facing criticism at times, she remains undeterred, using her platform to advocate for change. This multifaceted persona makes Susan Sarandon a truly influential figure in the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nBrian Williams, an emblematic figure in American journalism, is renowned for his engaging reportage and authoritative news delivery style. Born on May 5, 1959, he grew up in New Jersey and embarked on a career in media that has spanned over four decades. Williams dropped out of college to intern at the White House during President Jimmy Carter's administration and took his first steps into broadcasting at KOAM-TV in Kansas. In 1993, Williams began his long-standing association with NBC News, initially serving as Chief White House Correspondent and anchor of the Weekend Nightly News. His exceptional reporting skills were recognized when he succeeded Tom Brokaw as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004. Under his stewardship, the program won four Edward R. Murrow Awards and was consistently among the highest-rated news broadcasts in America. However, Williams's career hit a snag in 2015 following a controversy concerning his misrepresentation of events occurring during the Iraq War.

He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1990 to 1992, as the Mayor of Woodbridge Township from 1991 to 2002 and in the New Jersey Senate from 1994 to 1998. He was the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1997 but was narrowly defeated by Republican incumbent Christine Todd Whitman. He ran again in 2001 and was elected by a large margin.In early 2002, Governor McGreevey was criticized for appointing his secret lover, Israeli national Golan Cipel, as homeland security adviser even though Cipel lacked experience or other qualifications for the position. On August 12, 2004, McGreevey came out as gay and announced he would resign the governorship, effective November 15, 2004. This made McGreevey the first openly gay governor in United States history. In 2007, McGreevey was accepted by the General Theological Seminary in New York City to obtain his Master of Divinity degree, a requirement to becoming an Episcopal priest. He volunteered service through Exodus Transitional Community to former prisoners seeking rehabilitation at the Church of Living Hope in New York City. In July 2013, McGreevey was appointed head of Jersey City's Employment & Training Program (JCETP). In January 2019, the board of the non-profit voted to terminate his employment."
