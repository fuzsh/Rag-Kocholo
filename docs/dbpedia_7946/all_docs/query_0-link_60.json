        "text": "Eva Csölleová, Vítek Formánek\n\nTvůrčí duo ve složení fotografka - korektorka Eva Csölleová a spisovatel - redaktor Vítek Formánek. Zkušenosti mají s prácí pro časopisy jako Cinema nebo Interview. Vydali desítku knih u nás i v zahraničí. Zaměřují se na interview se zajímavými lidmi či osobnostmi kulturní scény z celého světa.\n\nJordan-Kane Lewis was born in Nuneaton, Northern Warwickshire, England, on December 18, 1998. During his early years, his family frequently relocated, primarily in the vicinity of Sheffield. He spent several years residing in a pub in Unstone before his family eventually settled in the town of Dronfield. It was in Dronfield that he spent the remainder of his youth, nurturing his passion for films by creating homemade shorts. Jordan-Kane commenced his film studies at the age of 12 at Dronfield Henry Fanshawe before advancing to college and university to further pursue his passion for film. He is best known for A Touch of Vengeance (2022) & Nothing Goes (2023).\n\nThor Pedersen hails from Denmark and did his national service as Royal guard. He visited every country in the World on shoestring budget and without using air transport. That was one of the reasons, why we asked him for interview and he duly obliged within a week.\n\nBritish born-American-based director Mick Jackson (4. 10. 1943) must be a fine man. When we wrote him after 11 years and asked him for autograph and request for interview, he replied with long personal letter and gave us happily his e-mail. We sent questions and he replied with 12 pages which is unheard of these days from film department people.\n\nwww.unitedfilm.cz creative duo Vítek Formánek and Eva Csölleová has reached their creative Mt. Everest and had their book published in USA by explorer, publisher and motivative speaker Aaron Linsdau. The book WASTED LIVES OF UNSUNG HEROES brings stories of brave Czech airmen who fought in Britain during WWII and suffered back home in communist regime for fighting on \"wrong\" side. Published stories are tribute to these heroes and western readers may not even be aware of them.\n\nErik Johansson (1985) is a Swedish photographer and retoucher, self- made man, who currently lives and works in Prague and is an author of incredibly beautiful surrealistic photos, where he connects two worlds. He graduated from university in Gothenburg and has master degree in Interactive design. He was very approachable and helpful and despite his busy schedule, the interview was completed within couple of weeks."
