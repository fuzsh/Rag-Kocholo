        "text": "Christopher Sarandon (born July 24, 1942) is an American actor. He voiced Jack Skellington in Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nSarandon was born and raised in Beckley, West Virginia, the son of restaurateurs Christopher \"Chris\" Sarandon and Cliffie (née Cardullias). His father, whose surname was originally \"Sarondonethes\", was born in Istanbul, Turkey, of Greek ancestry; his mother is also of Greek descent.\n\nSarandon graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley. He earned a degree in speech at West Virginia University. He earned his master's degree in theater from The Catholic University of America (CUA) in Washington, D.C..\n\nCareer[]\n\nAfter graduation, he toured with numerous improvisational companies and became much involved with regional theatre, making his professional debut in the play The Rose Tattoo during 1965. In 1968, Sarandon moved to New York City, where he obtained his first television role as Dr. Tom Halverson for the series The Guiding Light (1973–1974). He appeared in the primetime television movies The Satan Murders (1974) and Thursday's Game before obtaining the role of Al Pacino's transgender wife in Dog Day Afternoon (1975), a performance which earned him nominations for Best New Male Star of the Year at the Golden Globes and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nSarandon appeared in the Broadway play The Rothschilds and The Two Gentlemen of Verona, as well making regular appearances at numerous Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw festivals in the United States and Canada. He also had a series of television roles, some of which (such as A Tale of Two Cities in 1980) corresponded to his affinity for the classics. He also had roles in the thriller movie Lipstick (1976) and as a demon in the movie The Sentinel (1977).\n\nTo avoid being typecast in villainous roles, Sarandon accepted various roles of other types during the years to come, portraying the title role of Christ in the made-for-television movie The Day Christ Died (1980). He received accolades for his portrayal of Sydney Carton in a TV-movie version of A Tale of Two Cities (1980), co-starred with Dennis Hopper in the 1983 movie The Osterman Weekend, which was based on the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name, and co-starred with Goldie Hawn in the movie Protocol (1984). These were followed by another mainstream success as the vampire-next-door in the horror movie Fright Night (1985). He starred in the 1986 TV movie Liberty, which addressed the making of New York City's statue of Liberty.\n\nHe is best known in the film industry for his role as Prince Humperdinck in Rob Reiner's 1987 movie The Princess Bride, though he also has had supporting parts in other successful movies such as the original Child's Play (1988). In 1992, he played Joseph Curwen/Charles Dexter Ward in The Resurrected. He also provided the voice of Jack Skellington, the main character of Tim Burton's animated Disney movie The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), and has since reprised the role in other productions, including the Disney/Square video games Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II and the Capcom sequel to the original movie, Oogie's Revenge. Sarandon also reprised his role as Jack Skellington for several Disneyland Halloween events and attractions including; Halloween Screams, the Frightfully Fun Parade, and the Haunted Mansion Holiday, a three-month overlay of the Haunted Mansion, where Jack and his friends take control of a mansion in an attempt to introduce Christmas, much as his character did in the movie.\n\nSarandon appeared in TV again with a recurring role as Dr. Burke on NBC's long-running medical drama ER.\n\nIn 1991 he performed on Broadway in the short-lived musical Nick & Nora (based on the movie The Thin Man) with Joanna Gleason, the daughter of Monty Hall. Sarandon married Gleason in 1994. They have appeared together in a number of movies, including Edie & Pen (1996), American Perfekt (1997), and Let the Devil Wear Black (1999). During the 2000s he made guest appearances in several TV series, notably as the Necromancer demon, Armand, in Charmed, and as superior court judge Barry Krumble for six episodes of Judging Amy.\n\nIn 2006 he played Signor Naccarelli in the six-time Tony award-winning Broadway musical play The Light in the Piazza at Lincoln Center. Most recently he appeared in Cyrano de Bergerac as Antoine de Guiche, with Kevin Kline, Jennifer Garner, and Daniel Sunjata. He is on the Advisory Board for the Greenbrier Valley Theatre in Lewisburg, West Virginia. In 2016 he performed in the Off-Broadway production of the Dave Malloy musical Preludes as Anton Chekhov, Tchaikovsky, Alexander Glazunov, Leo Tolstoy, Tsar Nicholas II, and The Master.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nSarandon has been married three times: he married actress Susan Sarandon in 1967, the couple first met while attending The Catholic University of America together in Washington, D.C.. The marriage lasted for twelve years; the pair divorced in 1979. After divorcing from Susan, he married his second wife, fashion model Lisa Ann Cooper, in 1980. The couple had two daughters and one son: Stephanie (born 1982), Alexis (born 1984) and Michael (born 1988).[7] The marriage ended in divorce in 1989 after nine years of marriage. In 1994, he married his third wife, actress and singer Joanna Gleason. The couple met while performing in Broadway's short-lived 1991 musical Nick & Nora; they returned to the stage together in 1998's Thorn and Bloom. They also collaborated in several films together, such as Road Ends, Edie & Pen, Let the Devil Wear Black, and American Perfekt.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes/Awards 1965 Samurai Spy The Shogun The Sound of Music Peck von Trapp The Greatest Story Ever Told Carter The Cincinnati Kid Flik Doctor Zhivago Omar 1966 Blow-Up Hummings 1967 The Dirty Dozen Dr. Ackerman In the Heat of the Night William Sidney Bonnie and Clyde Luke Matthews Cool Hand Luke George Johnson The Graduate Mike Buck 1968 Planet of the Apes Dave Negli Bullitt Vic Vaughn 1970 M*A*S*H Warden Stack Patton Raf Perry The Hawaiians Stack Kelly's Heroes Inch 1971 McCabe & Mrs. Miller Beatty Edmund 1973 Westworld Benjamin Brolin Mean Streets Harvey Robert 1974 The Towering Inferno Jeff Jersey 1975 Dog Day Afternoon Leon Shermer Nominated—Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated—Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\n\nNominated—New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor 1976 Lipstick Gordon Stuart 1977 The Sentinel Michael Lerman 1979 Max Max Oswald Fred Cuba Juan Pulido 1980 The Day Christ Died Jesus Christ A Tale of Two Cities Sydney Carton\n\nCharles Darnay 1981 Excalibur Woody Broken Promise Bud Griggs Outland Billy Time Bandits The Treasure 1983 Never Say Never Again Sean Fox The Osterman Weekend Joseph Cardone 1984 This Is Spinal Tap Harry Paul Once Upon a Time in America Burt Woods The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension John Weller Protocol Michael Ransome 1985 This Child Is Mine Craig Wilkerson Return to Oz Prince Luke Silverado Mike Head Fright Night Jerry Dandridge Nominated—Saturn Award for Best Actor 1986 Liberty\n\n[1] || Jacque Marchant ||\n\n1987 Spaceballs Clive The Princess Bride Prince Humperdinck Mayflower Madam Matt Whittington 1988 Bloodsport Luke Warden Killer Klowns from Outer Space Hershel John Child's Play Detective Mike Norris Goodbye, Miss Fourth Of July George Janus 1989 Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure John Fox Collision Course Philip Mandras Slaves of New York Victor Okrent Tailspin: Behind the Korean Airliner Tragedy John Lenczowski 1990 The Stranger Within Dan Whispers Tony 1991 The Doors Angus McTeague Thelma & Louise Pip The Resurrected Joseph Curwen\n\nCharles Dexter Ward The Last Boy Scout Johnny Whistler 1993 Dark Tide Tim The Nightmare Before Christmas Jack Skellington (voice) Tombstone Professor Raoul 1994 David's Mother Philip Speed Randall The Client Hank Airheads Samuel Natural Born Killers Patrick Timecop Lawliet 1995 Terminal Justice Reginald Matthews Just Cause Lyle Morgan Rob Roy Blair Sullivan Die Hard with a Vengeance Lincoln Clyde Braveheart Mel Bale Heat Fungus Man 1996 No Greater Love Sam Horowitz Broken Arrow Danny Luke Edie & Pen Max A Time to Kill Otis Chain Reaction Dr. Nathan Waldman Bordello of Blood Rev.
