        "text": "The Department of Drama at The Catholic University of America is a nationally recognized program that offers training and preparation for professional careers in theatre. Renowned since its founding in 1937 by the famous “show-biz priest,” Reverend Gilbert Hartke, the drama department has grown over many decades to produce some of the leading theatre artists of our time.\n\nMany stage, film and television stars got their start at Catholic University's Drama Department. Philip Bosco, Ed McMahon, Susan and Christopher Sarandon, John Slattery and Jon Voight all trod the boards here. Outstanding directors trained here, such as the Tony Award winning Walter Bobbie, and the Artistic Director of Arena Stage, Molly Smith. Several Pulitzer Prize winning playwrights started here, including Michael Cristofer (The Shadow Box), Jason Miller (That Championship Season), Paula Vogel (Indecent, How I Learned To Drive), in addition to the groundbreaking Mart Crowley (The Boys in the Band), Joseph Walker (The River Niger), John Pielmeier (Agnes of God) and Jerome Ragni (Hair). Walter Kerr, the Pulitzer-prize winning critic and playwright, was also one of our distinguished alumni.\n\nOur professionally-oriented faculty trains students how to collaborate and create new and classical work that easily competes with the best theatres in the Washington D.C. region. The rich theater community of the area includes some of the country’s leading professional stages like Arena Stage, Shakespeare Theatre, Woolly Mammoth Theatre, Roundhouse Theatre, Folger Theatre, Signature Theatre, Ford’s Theatre, Center Stage, just to name a few. Our location provides opportunities for students through residencies, auditions, and internships."
