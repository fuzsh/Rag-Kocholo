        "text": "What is Susan Sarandon's Net Worth?\n\nSusan Sarandon is an American actress who has a net worth of $60 million. Susan Sarandon is one of the most successful actresses of her generation. She has won a number of awards over the course of her career, including an Academy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Susan is also the co-founder of SPiN, an international chain of table tennis clubs and bars.\n\nSarandon's early career in the 1970s saw her in diverse roles, but it was her performance in the cult classic \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975) that brought her widespread recognition. This role highlighted her versatility and willingness to take on unconventional characters. In the 1980s, she continued to build her portfolio with significant roles in films like \"Atlantic City\" (1980), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination, demonstrating her ability to capture complex emotions and characters.\n\nThe 1990s marked a high point in Sarandon's career. Her role in \"Thelma & Louise\" (1991) became iconic, symbolizing female empowerment and solidifying her status as a leading actress in Hollywood. Her portrayal of a nun in \"Dead Man Walking\" (1995) earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, recognizing her profound ability to convey depth and humanity.\n\nSarandon's choice of roles often reflects her personal beliefs and activism. She is known for her strong political views and has been involved in various social and humanitarian causes, using her platform to advocate for change. This aspect of her personality is sometimes reflected in the roles she chooses, which often feature strong, independent women.\n\nBeyond her dramatic roles, Sarandon has also excelled in comedy and action genres, showcasing her flexibility as an actress. She has worked with some of the most renowned directors and actors in the industry, earning multiple awards and nominations throughout her career.\n\nIn recent years, Sarandon has continued to take on challenging roles in both film and television, never shying away from complex or unconventional characters. Her performances in TV series and miniseries have been critically acclaimed, proving her adaptability to different mediums.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSusan Abigail Tomalin was born on October 4th, 1946, in New York City. Raised in New Jersey alongside eight siblings in a Roman Catholic household, Susan attended Catholic schools from a young age. Her father was an advertising executive and a television producer.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1964, she attended The Catholic University of America and studied drama. During her college years, she studied drama under famed coach Gilbert V. Hartke and earned a BA in drama. During this period, she paid the bills by working as a hairdresser and a house cleaner. Susan met her husband, Chris Sarandon, during college, and she changed her name to Susan Sarandon after they married. Even after their divorce, she maintained the surname Sarandon as her stage name.\n\nEarly Career\n\nSarandon started her film career with a major role in 1970's \"Joe.\" She played a teen who becomes involved with drugs and degeneracy. In the early 70s, she continued her acting career with roles in soap operas such as \"A World Apart\" and \"Search for Tomorrow.\" In the mid-'70s, Susan returned to film when she joined the cast of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\" This film led to a leading role for Sarandon in \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" and \"Pretty Baby.\" By the early 80s, she was earning Academy Award nominations for roles in movies like \"Atlantic City.\"\n\nSarandon then raised eyebrows when she appeared in the erotic horror film \"The Hunger,\" in which she filmed a lesbian sex scene with Catherine Deneuve. Towards the end of the 80s, she appeared in \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" which received positive reviews from critics. While Sarandon was clearly making a name for herself in the film industry, she truly put herself on the map in 1988 with a critically acclaimed performance in \"Bill Durham.\" The film was also a commercial success at the box office.\n\nSuccess\n\nSarandon continued to wow critics with a number of roles in the 90s. She was nominated for Best Actress after her performance in \"Thelma & Louise,\" a cult-classic film that is still popular today. She was nominated once again for Best Actress after performances in \"Lorenzo's Oil\" and \"The Client\" before finally taking home the award in 1995 for her role in \"Dead Man Walking.\" In the film, she plays a nun who visits a murderer who has been sentenced to the death sentence.\n\nDuring the 90s, Sarandon also appeared in films like \"White Palace,\" \"Stepmom,\" \"Little Women,\" \"Anywhere But Here,\" and \"Cradle Will Rock.\" In the 2000s, Susan continued to be a major force in Hollywood with roles in movies like \"Igby Goes Down,\" \"Bernard and Doris,\" \"The Banger Sisters,\" \"Shall We Dance,\" \"Alfie,\" \"Romance & Cigarettes,\" \"Elizabethtown,\" and \"Enchanted.\"\n\nOne of her most notable films during the 2000s was \"Lovely Bones,\" a supernatural thriller about a girl who watches over her family after being murdered. The Peter Jackson film divided critics, but it won a number of awards. Sarandon also appeared alongside her real-life daughter in \"Middle of Nowhere,\" a coming-of-age comedy that was released in 2008.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Sarandon appeared in a number of television shows. Her guest-starring credits include \"Friends,\" \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" \"30 Rock,\" \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mike & Molly,\" \"Chappelle's Show,\" \"Mad TV,\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\" During this period, she also established herself as a voice actress and appeared in two episodes of \"The Simpsons.\" Susan has narrated over 24 documentaries, many of which deal with political and social issues. She is also an experienced host, having presented PBS' \"Independent Lens\" and \"Mythos.\"\n\nDuring the 2010s, Sarandon appeared in an HBO pilot for \"The Miraculous Year,\" although the series was never picked up. Throughout the decade, she appeared in films like \"Arbitrage,\" \"Tammy,\" and the \"Meddler.\" She also continued her voice acting career, landing a notable role in the video game \"Dishonored.\" Towards the end of the decade, she appeared in the first season of FX's \"Feud.\"\n\nActivism\n\nSarandon is well-known for her work as a political and social activist. Over the years, she has been involved in various anti-war movements. She has also been critical of many presidents and presidential nominees, including Hillary Clinton. Over the years, she has lent her support to figures like Bernie Sanders. She is also a supporter of various civil rights movements and has campaigned to end the death penalty in America.\n\nSPiN\n\nSusan Sarandon is the co-founder of the table tennis franchise SPiN. She co-founded the business with her boyfriend at the time, Jonathan Bricklin, and three other co-founders. Launched in 2009 in New York City, SPiN was born from a simple yet innovative idea: to create a space where people could gather, play, and socialize, with ping pong at its core. The concept quickly gained popularity, appealing to a diverse crowd ranging from casual players to serious enthusiasts and even celebrities. The club's stylish, eclectic decor, combined with the lively atmosphere of competition and camaraderie, made it a unique destination in the heart of the city.\n\nSusan Sarandon, a table tennis enthusiast herself, brought not only her star power but also her vision of creating a fun, inclusive environment. Her involvement helped raise the profile of SPiN, turning it into a trendy spot for both leisure and high-profile events. The club hosts tournaments, private parties, and corporate events, and its popularity led to the expansion into other cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Chicago. To date, there are nine SPiN locations.\n\nRelationships\n\nSusan Sarandon's first marriage was to Chris Sarandon in 1967. They divorced in 1979. After dating celebrities like David Bowie and Sean Penn, Susan established a long-term relationship with filmmaker Franco Amurri. They had a daughter together named Eva Amurri, who later became an actress.\n\nIn 1988, Sarandon began a relationship with Tim Robbins. They lived together for the next 11 years and had two sons together. After breaking up with Robbins in 2009, Sarandon dated Jonathan Bricklin for the next six years.\n\nReal Estate\n\nFollowing her split with Tim Robbins, Sarandon paid her ex $3.2 million in order to have complete ownership over the six-bedroom duplex the couple shared in Chelsea, Manhattan. That same month, she also splurged on a $1.75-million, one-bedroom penthouse in Greenwich Village. In July 2020, Susan listed the six-bedroom Chelsea duplex for $7.9 million."
