        "text": "Susan Sarandon was born Susan Abigail Tomalin on 4 October, 1946 in New York City, to Lenora Marie (Criscione) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin, a television producer and advertising executive. The actress was the eldest of her eight siblings, and was raised Catholic, attending Roman Catholic schools while she was growing up. She later attended the Catholic University of America (because her parents missed the deadline on all her other college applications) and earned a B.A. in drama. It was also here where she met her first and only husband, Chris Sarandon, an aspiring actor. Believe it or not, Susan Sarandon got her first role by accident, when she followed Chris to an audition for Joe, where she walked away with the role of Susan Compton. The duo later divorced in 1979, and Sarandon decided to keep Chris’s surname as her stage name.\n\nThe actress got her first break in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it wasn’t until ten years later when she landed in a role in Bull Durham where she finally became a star. At this point, she was in her forties, and the studio thought that Sarandon was too old for the part. Nonetheless, she flew herself out to read for the director to prove them wrong, dressed in a form fitting off-the-shoulder red-and-white dress. The rest, as they say, is history."
