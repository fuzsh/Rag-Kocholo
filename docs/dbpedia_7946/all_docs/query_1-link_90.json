        "text": "Susan Sarandon\n\nActress, in a relationship, 65\n\nMy father, Phillip, was a singer in the days of the big bands. He was a handsome guy, of Welsh and English background, and had a great voice. He went off to war, where he did the entertainment for the troops, came back, got my mother pregnant with me [the eldest of nine children] – and there went his dreams out the window.\n\nHe then got in on the early days of TV – as a stage manager, not as an actor – and eventually traded all that in to become a vice-president of Ogilvy & Mather advertising agency. So he was one of the “Mad Men”; now I see that series and it makes me wonder what exactly was going on.\n\nHe had a kind of theatrical bent to him, he was agnostic, he was a Democrat, so in that sense I’m much more like him than my mom, who is very Catholic and a Republican. He passed away about 15 years ago.\n\nMy ex-husband, Chris Sarandon, is a kind, patient man. We became friends when he was a graduate student and I was a 17-year-old freshman. He was the first man I slept with, at 19, and I was so grateful for the support and education he gave – turning me on to black-and-white films and poetry and everything else – that I married him at 20. I was living at my grandparents’ house and going to college in Washington, DC, and at that time you couldn’t live together, especially at the Catholic University of America. It was an amicable split [in 1978, after 11 years together]; I don’t talk to him often, but when I do it’s great.\n\nI then had a relationship with [French director] Louis Malle, who was 14 or 15 years older than me and had two kids. I was just so interested in everything his life was about. Then I saw Private Benjamin and the French guy in that had the same apartment as Louis, and I thought maybe he wasn’t so special, maybe he was just as much of a French cliché as some Americans are clichés. It was a very interesting time, but I didn’t want to get married. At a certain point I decided to do a play instead of following him to France where he was editing Atlantic City, and that was the end of that.\n\nI was staying with Gore Vidal in Italy when I got pregnant on the Spanish Steps with [Italian director] Franco Amurri, who was 12 years younger and had never lived outside his family’s house until he came and lived with me. I wasn’t supposed to be able to have kids and hadn’t used birth control in years, so the pregnancy was a complete surprise.\n\nI didn’t know Franco that well, so I said, “If you want to come around, fine”, and he took me up on that approach. Eventually it wasn’t enough, but I fell in love with Italy and his family. My daughter, Eva [born in 1985], ended up majoring in Italian studies, and when she got married Franco’s whole family came to the wedding, even though he hasn’t been around that much.\n\nTim Robbins and I were incredibly productive, both in raising three fabulous children and doing important work together – including Bull Durham [the 1988 film that brought them together], which was a fabulous experience. So the 23 years we spent together were really good. We accomplished a lot.\n\nJonathan [Bricklin, Sarandon’s 30-something co-owner of New York table tennis club SPiN] and I are partners in a lot of different areas.\n\nI find all men very different. The age, the nationality, the colour: they’re all just details. It all depends on the formative years and their personality. Having sons [Jack, born in 1989, and Miles, 1992] has made me like men more, because the socialisation process for boys is so brutal. Having a girl, you know what you have to give her, what she’s up against.\n\nGuys don’t have a clue. They are so entitled: society is so geared toward making boys think everything is owed to them. And any kind of sentiment or emotional vulnerability is just pounded out of them. What they’re taught about what it means to be a guy is so narrow.\n\nI look at my 20-year-old and he seems to be a different generation: more male and female and not adhering to some of the rules that have been in place – although that could just be him and growing up in New York. But it’s tough to be a guy – they just don’t get it.\n\nSusan Sarandon stars in Arbitrage, in cinemas now."
