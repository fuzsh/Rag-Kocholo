        "meta_description": "Big thank you to the legendary Chris Sarandon for coming on my show for an interview! Chris talked about starting out in theater at the Catholic University of America, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Leon Shermer in Dog Day Afternoon, and his introduction to Horror as a viewer. He explained why Horror was looked down upon by actors at a time and how that viewpoint changed in the 80s. He got into his legendary role as the vampire Jerry Dandrige in the original Tom Holland's 1985 Fright Night, his favorite scenes from the film, and that if Tom Holland was doing the sequel he would have most likely reprised his role as Jerry Dandrige. He discussed his role as Detective Mike Norris in Tom Holland's 1988 Child's Play and his iconic voiceover of Jack Skellington in Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. He revealed the moment when he thought that The Nightmare Before Christmas and his role as Jack Skellington would become a mega hit amongst audiences. He announced that his memoir Heroes, Vampires, and Villains should be releasing next year sometime in 2022 as well as his own podcast. We finished the interview talking sports. Chris is a fan of the Yankees, Giants, and Knicks.
