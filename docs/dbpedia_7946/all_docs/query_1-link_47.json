        "text": "Actress Susan Sarandon never has shied away from a challenge. She's played a witch, nun, dying mother, drunken grandmother, a fugitive and even herself on the television show, \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nThere's another role that she's taken on for decades and has no plans to give up: activist. The 64-year-old has said that at the root of both acting and activism is imagination. She's able to imagine herself in someone else's shoes - and wants to use her fame to help them.\n\nEarly years\n\nSusan Sarandon - the activist - arrived on center stage before the actress. The former Susan Tomalin was studying drama at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. at the start of a turbulent era.\n\n\"You know, I just came of age at a time when, if you had any brain at all, the end of 60s, beginning of the 70s, they stopped, we stopped a war. You had sex drugs and rock and roll but you were also in the streets and it made a difference,\" she says. \"There's no one else in my family that has this problem. I'm the only one.\"\n\nSarandon grew up the eldest of nine children, sleeping in bunk beds in a crowded but happy house in Edison, New Jersey. Her father was a big band singer before becoming an advertising executive, and was often belting out tunes. She was barred from singing due to a voice that her father deemed terrible. Yet in 1975, in one of her first big roles, Sarandon acted and sang as Janet, a good girl gone bad, in \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\"\n\nGaining ground\n\nSarandon kept honing her craft, becoming an art-house favorite. Louis Malle's \"Atlantic City\" in 1980 earned her an Academy Award nomination. At that point, her marriage to her college sweetheart, Chris Sarandon, had ended but she kept his surname.\n\nIn the mid-80s, she had a daughter with an Italian director and was living in Rome. After reading a script that captivated her, she decided to fly to the U.S. at her own expense to fight for the role. Paul Zinder, associate professor of the American University of Rome, says that ended up being the movie that catapulted Sarandon into the major leagues.\n\n\"If you're to look at Sarandon's kind of coming out party, it was Bull Durham in 1988,\" says Zinder.\n\nIn the film, Sarandon plays an English teacher and baseball devotee who selects a minor-league player each year to seduce and educate about poetry, baseball and life.\n\n\"What was unique about Sarandon's role in that film is that she is, first of all, non-conventional looking for a Hollywood sex goddess, so to speak,\" says Zinder. \"However, her confidence was quite clear to everyone who watched that film and really her comedic gifts as well related directly to her sexual confidence.\"\n\nHollywood directors noticed, putting her among the A-list actresses.\n\nFunctional fame\n\nSarandon realized her fame could serve another function.\n\n\"After I became a celebrity, it just seemed to make so much sense to be able to use my celebrity to get press to go somewhere where they weren't going to cover the early days of AIDs, for instance, or sex trafficking.\""
