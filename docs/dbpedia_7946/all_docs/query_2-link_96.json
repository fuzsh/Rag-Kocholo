        "text": "Susan Sarandon (born Susan Abigail Tomalin on October 4, 1946) is an Academy Award winning American actress.\n\nBorn in New York, New York, she attended the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC in 1964, where she met and married fellow student Chris Sarandon. In 1970 she went to a cattle call for the film Joe with Chris and, although he did not get a part, Susan received the major role of the disaffected teen who disappears into the seedy underworld. She did not follow up on the success of that movie, however, and it was five more years before she appeared in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the cult classic. That same year, she played the female lead in The Great Waldo Pepper, opposite Robert Redford.\n\nEven then, it was not right away that she became a star. She was nominated for an Oscar in 1980 for Atlantic City, but even then she did not become a household name. That took 1988's Bull Durham. It was while filming that movie that she met actor Tim Robbins, with whom she established an unmarried relationship that continues.\n\nSarandon received four Academy Award nominations in the 1990s, finally winning in 1996 for Dead Man Walking. Sarandon and Robbins are noted for their involvement in liberal political causes.\n\nSarandon has three children: actress Eva Amurri (born 1985) by Franco Amurri; and John Henry (born 1989) and Miles (born 1992) by Robbins.\n\nHer recent movies include Stepmom (1998), Anywhere But Here (1999), Cradle Will Rock (1999) (portraying Mussolini's mistress), and The Banger Sisters (2002).\n\nAcademy Awards and Nominations\n\n1996 Won Dead Man Walking\n\n1995 Nominated The Client\n\n1993 Nominated Lorenzo's Oil\n\n1992 Nominated Thelma and Louise\n\n1982 Nominated Atlantic City"
