Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed his longtime economic adviser to be the next prime minister in the face of US pressure to reform the Palestinian Authority as part of Washington's postwar vision for Gaza. The president announced the appointment in a statement released by his office.

Mohammad Mustafa, a US-educated economist and political independent, will head a technocratic government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that could potentially administer Gaza ahead of eventual statehood. But those plans face major obstacles, including strong opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israel-Hamas war that is still grinding on with no end in sight.

It's unclear whether the appointment of a new Cabinet led by a close Abbas ally would be sufficient to meet US demands for reform, as the 88-year-old president would remain in overall control.

'Right-hand man of President Abbas'

The White House on Thursday welcomed Mustafa's appointment, calling on him to deliver "credible and far-reaching reforms" as he prepares his cabinet.

"A reformed Palestinian Authority is essential to delivering results for the Palestinian people and establishing the conditions for stability in both the West Bank and Gaza," National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.

Yet Khalil Shaheen, political analyst and writer, said Mustafa's closeness to Abbas limits prospects for major change. "In the end, the man (Mustafa) remains the right-hand man of President Abbas... Abbas wants to say that he supports reforms, but they remain under his control," Shaheen said.
