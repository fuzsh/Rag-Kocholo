        "text": "President Abbas praised the efforts made by the World Council of Churches (WCC) to support the Palestinian people to gain their freedom and independence, highlighting its important role in delivering the suffering of the Palestinian people to the world.\n\nThe President briefed the delegation on the latest developments in the occupied Palestinian territory and in Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem – and stressed the immediate urgency for a ceasefire.\n\nHe further stressed the need to oblige Israel to stop attacks on Islamic and Christian sanctuaries and properties in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nThe general secretary observed the unique role and mandate of the WCC in listening to, and amplifying, the voices and testimonies of member churches and partners in the Holy Land, not least today, and he affirmed the WCC’s ongoing commitment to work for just peace for all people.\n\nPillay underlined the urgency for international partners and political authorities to work together for a strategic intervention to find a way to stop and prevent what is happening in Gaza at the moment. He said: “It is clear that collaboration is required in the efforts to end the war in Gaza, provide humanitarian support for all people affected, ensure the freedom of religion, and encourage the necessity of dialogue to create a secure and safe future for both Israeli and Palestinian people.”\n\nPillay also spoke to the pivotal role and responsibility political leaders must take in upholding the dignity of every human being and respecting the principles of international law. President Abbas affirmed that his government is prepared to participate in dialogue processes with the Israeli government to establish a peaceful and stable future for all people.\n\n“As a worldwide fellowship of churches, we will continue to accompany the churches and the people in Palestine and Israel on their journey with prayer, action, and hope for a better future,” Pillay said."
