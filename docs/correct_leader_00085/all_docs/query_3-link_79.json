        "text": "You're reading analysis from the Palestine Briefing, where we break down Palestine's top political, security and business stories each week. To read the full newsletter, sign up here.\n\nDiscussions about the postwar governance of Gaza are gaining momentum within the Arab world, with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority all heavily involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations. The United States and Jordan — who held a well-timed summit to discuss, among other things, Amman’s role in the day-after events — appear to also be part of the frantic search for solutions and accepted formulas.\n\nAs part of this shuttle diplomacy push, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas along with his top two aides, the secretary-general of the PLO's Executive Committee and liaison with Israel, Hussein al-Sheikh, and the head of his intelligence service, Majed Faraj, headed to Qatar to discuss plans for the postwar governance of Gaza.\n\nMultiple reports say that the meetings between Palestinian and Qatari leadership were aimed at getting Hamas consensus on a new Palestinian government and the entry of Hamas into the PLO in the long term.\n\nSources in Ramallah and Cairo tell Al-Monitor that the Qataris appear to have convinced Hamas’ political leadership of the need for a new — and unified — technocratic government to rule the day after the war, though it's unclear what Hamas will get in exchange for its thumbs up."
