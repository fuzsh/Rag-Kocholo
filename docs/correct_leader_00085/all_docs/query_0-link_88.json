        "text": "We welcome the contacts between Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of Palestine and leader of Fatah and Mr. Halid Mashaal, leader of Hamas with the participation of other Palestinian groups on 21-22 December 2011 in Cairo and the decisions taken as a result of these contacts towards advancing the Reconciliation Agreement signed among Palestinian groups at a ceremony last May which was attended also by Mr. Ahmet Davutoğlu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey. We are particularly pleased by the news reports about Hamas’ participation in the Palestine Liberation Organization. We believe that the constructive approach adopted by Hamas had a significant role in reaching this outcome. In this vein, we express our appreciation to all the parties for their contributions in achieving this result, particularly the Egyptian authorities.\n\nWe wish that all Palestinian groups will continue to act with spirit of unity and solidarity and to ensure a lasting national reconciliation in Palestine as soon as possible in line with the decisions taken.\n\nNational reconciliation in Palestine is of critical importance in terms of ensuring just, comprehensive and sustainable peace and stability in the Middle East which is passing through a process of democratic change and transformation. An inclusive government with high democratic legitimacy in Palestine is needed not only for accommodating legitimate demands and expectations of the Palestinian people but also for reviving the peace process on a credible ground. In this context, all members of the international community should support, without prejudice, the national reconciliation process which will be concluded by free, fair and transparent elections in Palestine.\n\nAs expressed on the occasion of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ visit to Turkey on 19-21 December 2011 prior to his Cairo contacts, Turkey will continue to promote efforts towards achieving unity and solidarity in Palestine and to contribute in any way it can to a lasting and just settlement to the Palestinian question."
