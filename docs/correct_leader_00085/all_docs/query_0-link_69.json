        "text": "On August 25, 2011, the Chinese Special Envoy to the Middle East Wu Sike who is visiting Palestine met with President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nWu said that China supports all the efforts which help promote the peace process in the Middle East. China hopes that Palestine and Israel break the deadlock in peace talks and resume the talks as soon as possible and that Palestine ultimately builds an independent state on the basis of the two-state solution.\n\nAbbas noted that Palestine always upholds peace talks to be the important foundation and the only way out to solve the Palestinian issue and never takes the seeking of United Nations' support for an independent Palestinian state as the alternative of peace talks. Palestine will adhere to the strategic choice of peace talks and push forward the peace process in the Middle East."
