        "text": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss the fallout from Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel, especially repercussions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nDuring their meeting, Blinken reiterated \"the United States’ unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel\" and \"detailed U.S. efforts to coordinate with partners to prevent the conflict from widening,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a readout.\n\n\"The Secretary extended his condolences to the families of Palestinian civilian victims of this conflict, and reiterated that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s legitimate right to dignity, freedom, justice, and self-determination,\" Miller said.\n\nBlinken also thanked Abbas for his efforts to \"further calm\" the region and he \"reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to cooperation with the Palestinian leadership and people on efforts to ensure security for all,\" Miller added.\n\nThe secretary's trip to Jordan, along much of Israel’s eastern border, comes after he met with officials in Israel, as well as people directly affected by the attack and war, which has killed more than 1,300 in Israel, including at least 27 Americans. In Gaza, more than 1,500 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, with fears of a humanitarian crisis mounting.\n\nBlinken also met in Jordan with King Abdullah II, who has been in touch with President Joe Biden since the crisis in Gaza erupted. The Jordanian leader has served as a key mediator in Middle East-related negotiations for decades.\n\nBlinken and Abdullah discussed \"the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel,\" Miller said in a separate statement. They also talked about “efforts to secure the release of all hostages and prevent the conflict from widening.\"\n\nBlinken “underscored that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination and discussed ways to address the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza while Israel conducts legitimate security operations to defend itself from terrorists,” Miller added.\n\nAbbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the West Bank. His Fatah movement is a rival of Hamas, which controls Gaza.\n\nFollow live updates from NBC News here.\n\nAbbas is under pressure from Palestinians because of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip and the devastating Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack. The Israeli military on Friday ordered residents of northern Gaza to evacuate south, raising fears that a potential ground assault may be imminent.\n\nWhile Blinken met with Israeli officials Thursday, Abdullah spoke with Abbas separately and discussed “ways to stop the all-out aggression against our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,” according to the Palestinian News & Information Agency, or WAFA.\n\nDuring their conversation, Abbas called for an immediate end to aggression toward Palestinians and the need to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, as well as water and electricity in the enclave that Israel cut off as part of a total siege. The news agency said Abbas called for political action to end Israel’s occupation but also said that on both sides of the conflict, civilians, prisoners and detainees should be released.\n\nAbbas reaffirmed his belief that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the legitimate group representing all Palestinians, not Hamas, a reminder of how opposed the two groups are.\n\n“We emphasize the policy of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which renounce violence and adheres to international legitimacy, peaceful popular resistance, and political action as a path to achieving our national goals of freedom and independence, leading to ending the occupation and embodying the independence of our Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders,” Abbas said in a statement.\n\nIt’s unclear how much influence Abbas might have under the current circumstances, as the PLO and Hamas have largely been adversaries for almost two decades, with Hamas dismissing all agreements between the PLO and Israel.\n\nIn a 2006 election, the secular Fatah party of which Abbas serves as chairman lost its majority in the Palestinian territories to Hamas. Hamas took violent control of Gaza in 2007 and, since then, there has been ongoing conflict between Hamas and the PLO.\n\nBlinken, who has been addressing concerns about the residents of Gaza, said Thursday that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed “possibilities for safe passage for civilians who want to leave or get out of the way in Gaza.”\n\n“That’s a conversation, a discussion, that we will pursue in the coming days, including with some of the countries that we’ll be visiting,” he said.\n\nAfter Jordan, Blinken is expected to meet with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar."
