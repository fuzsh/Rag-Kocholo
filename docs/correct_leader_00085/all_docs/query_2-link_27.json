As Palestinians, we have the right to self-determination and an independent state,” he said. \n\nIt came as he addressed leaders at the WEF in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He criticized Israel for its campaign in Gaza, saying they are committing crimes, and called on the US to prevent an invasion of the Gaza city of Rafah. \n\nAbbas, who has led the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for 20 years, has had little control over the situation in the Gaza territory since Hamas took over in a coup in 2007. While Hamas calls for the destruction of Israel and replacing it with an Islamic Palestinian state, the PA officially still somewhat cooperates and coordinate with Israel, and has been part of on-again, off-again peace talks for a two-state solution for 30+ years. Abbas has refused to hold elections for 17 years and has a 90 percent+ disapproval level among Palestinians.\".",
