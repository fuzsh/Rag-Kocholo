        "text": "Domestic affairs\n\nAbbas was forced to confront deep divisions within the Palestinian territories in 2006 after candidates backed by Hamas, a militant Islamic party, won a majority of seats in legislative elections. A short-lived Fatah-Hamas unity government gave way to violence, and in 2007 Hamas established exclusive control in the Gaza Strip while Abbas took control of the West Bank by presidential decree. Although several deals toward reconciliation were reached during Abbas’s presidency, reintegration was never fully implemented before rifts would reemerge.\n\nAmid ongoing tensions with Hamas, Abbas at times faced criticism for neglecting the Gaza Strip. During the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2008, he was accused of being slow to condemn Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip despite being quick to blame Hamas for its role in the conflict. In 2017, as a reconciliation agreement with Hamas began to falter, Abbas imposed sanctions on the Gaza Strip, reinforcing more than a decade of sanctions against the territory imposed by Israel and Egypt.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

When his term expired in 2009, he claimed to have constitutional authority to serve for another year, until legislative elections would be held, since Palestinian law dictated that legislative and presidential elections be held at the same time. Elections were indefinitely delayed, however, and Abbas remained president well beyond his term’s expiration. Crackdowns in the West Bank affected not only organizers and journalists who had criticized Abbas but also individuals who had criticized him in posts on social media.\n\nPeace process and international relations\n\nPeace talks between Israel and the PA were renewed in November 2007, and direct negotiations continued into 2008. At the peak of these negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert—whose premiership was coming to an end amid a corruption scandal—offered Abbas more than 93 percent of the territory the Palestinians claimed in the West Bank, and both sides seemed to agree in principle on other key issues, such as the division of Jerusalem. Abbas was left without full details of the proposal, however, and refused to sign the deal on the spot. The following day, Tzipi Livni was elected to replace Olmert in party elections, but she was unable to form a coalition to become prime minister, and negotiations stalled as Israel went to early elections. Abbas participated in direct peace talks with Olmert’s successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, in 2010. Netanyahu refused to pick up where Abbas had left off with Olmert, however, and the talks quickly came to a halt after Netanyahu refused to extend a moratorium on the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nFollowing the talks’ failure, Abbas shifted his efforts toward gaining international recognition for a Palestinian state. In September 2011 Abbas submitted a request to the United Nations Security Council asking for the admission of an independent Palestinian state to the United Nations. The action—which was opposed by Israel and the United States—had become necessary, he argued, because the U.S.-mediated peace negotiations had placed too little pressure on Israel to make concessions for peace.\n\nA year after the failure of the Palestinian bid for full membership in the UN, Abbas announced that he would seek the UN’s implicit recognition of Palestinian statehood by submitting a draft resolution to the General Assembly requesting that the status of the Palestinian mission to the UN (officially called Palestine within the UN) be upgraded from “permanent observer” to “nonmember observer state.” The designation, while falling short of full UN membership, would allow the Palestinians access to international bodies and treaties that might enhance the permanence and leverage of the PA. The resolution passed on November 29, 2012, with 138 countries in favour, 9 opposed, and 41 abstaining. The resolution also urged Israel and the Palestinians to resume stalled negotiations toward a two-state solution. Israeli officials opposed Abbas’s bid for recognition, saying that such unilateral actions by the Palestinians would hold up negotiations with Israel. In April 2015 the “State of Palestine” was admitted to the International Criminal Court.\n\nIn September 2015 Abbas announced in a speech to the UN General Assembly that Palestinians were no longer bound by the Oslo Accords that he had helped negotiate, accusing Israel of having repeatedly violated the agreement. The practical effects of his declaration remained unclear, however, since he stopped short of naming specific actions to be taken, such as dissolving the PA or ending security coordination with Israel.\n\nAmid optimism that a new U.S. president might jump-start the peace process, Abbas and the PA welcomed the new president, Donald Trump, to the West Bank in May 2017. Trump, meanwhile, announced that his administration was developing an “ultimate deal” peace initiative. In December, however, relations between the PA and the United States were marred when the Trump administration announced that the U.S. embassy in Israel would move to the disputed territory of Jerusalem—a maneuver perceived by many as taking sides on one of the most contentious outstanding issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas responded by saying that the PA would reject U.S. mediation and the forthcoming peace initiative. Relations continued to sour in 2018 as the United States, the largest donor of foreign aid to the Palestinians, began to cut funding to the PA and to other aid programs for the Palestinians. In September of that year, the United States ordered the closure of the Washington, D.C., office of the PLO, which served as the diplomatic representative of the PA to the United States.\n\nIn January 2021, anticipating a chance to repair relations with the United States after the inauguration of Joe Biden as that country’s president, Abbas announced plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in May and July, respectively. Many observers believed that the plans were intended to shore up the Abbas-led government’s popular legitimacy while signaling the PA’s resolve to pursue a two-state solution. Biden, meanwhile, quickly restored some U.S. aid to the Palestinians and vowed to reopen the PLO office in Washington, D.C., thereby indicating his own commitment to the PA’s role in the peace process. In the lead-up to the elections, however, Abbas faced challenges within Fatah: seeking a rare opportunity for a change in leadership, prominent figures within the organization formed factions that were set to compete separately in the elections. In late April he announced that the elections would be delayed indefinitely because of concerns that Israel would prevent voting in East Jerusalem—a reason cited in the cancellation of elections in the past.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
