        "text": "Domestic affairs, the Gaza Strip, and relations with Hamas\n\nArafat remained president until his death in 2004; Abbas succeeded him as chairman of the PLO and was elected president of the PA in 2005. Elections for the PLC were held in 2006, and Hamas won a surprise victory over Fatah. Hamas and Fatah eventually formed a coalition government, with Hamas legislator Ismail Haniyeh as prime minister, but violence between their forces escalated in the Gaza Strip. After a week of fighting, Hamas forces defeated Fatah forces and took control of the Gaza Strip, which led Abbas to dismiss Haniyeh and the Hamas-led government and declare a state of emergency in June 2007. Fatah and Hamas made several attempts at reconciliation throughout Abbas’s presidency, but reintegration of Hamas into the PA was never implemented fully before rifts would reemerge.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 19, 2024, 11:46 PM ET (AP)\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: Drone strike hits Tel Aviv, killing 1 and injuring at least 10\n\nJuly 3, 2024, 2:16 PM ET (AP)\n\nIsrael turbocharges West Bank settlement expansion with largest land grab in decades\n\nJune 22, 2024, 6:42 PM ET (AP)\n\nAt least 39 people killed in Israeli strikes across northern Gaza, officials say\n\nAbbas appointed Finance Minister Salam Fayyad as prime minister of the emergency government. Fayyad pursued a neoliberal state-building agenda to develop government institutions and spur economic growth in preparation for a fully functioning independent state. Many Western governments and foreign observers hailed “Fayyadism” as constructive for a future Palestinian state and as nonconfrontational toward Israel. Fayyad had little support among Palestinians, however, who saw his endeavours as an ephemeral and wasted effort in the absence of real diplomatic progress that could guarantee these institutions stability and permanence. Indeed, although his policies delivered initial success, diplomatic tensions in the early 2010s caused Israel and others to withhold funds from the PA, leading to a financial crisis. Fayyad resigned in 2013.\n\nRami Hamdallah, then president of Al-Najah National University in Nablus, was appointed in his place as caretaker. The following year, upon agreement with Hamas, Hamdallah (who was not affiliated with either Fatah or Hamas) was reappointed prime minister, this time to head a unity government and implement a reconciliation process with Hamas. The PA began taking over some government functions in the Gaza Strip in 2017. As the reconciliation faltered, the future of PA leadership became more uncertain, and unrest grew in the West Bank over a controversial new social security program. Fatah recommended to Abbas in January 2019 that he sack the unity government. Days later Hamdallah resigned, though he remained in a caretaker role until a new government could be formed. He was replaced in March by Mohammad Shtayyeh, a chief negotiator of the Oslo Accords.\n\nAbbas faced criticism throughout his presidency for his authoritarianism and his neglect of the Gaza Strip. Apart from ruling by presidential decree after he dismissed the legislature in 2007, he remained president long after his term expired, at first claiming he should stay an extra year in order to hold presidential and legislative elections simultaneously. But elections were continually delayed because the PA could not hold elections throughout all the Palestinian territories. Moreover, the PA occasionally cracked down on dissidents, including individuals who criticized Abbas on social media. He at times scolded or punished Hamas, seemingly without regard for the Palestinians under its governance. In 2008 he quickly condemned Hamas for its role in a conflict with Israel while he was slow to condemn Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip; in 2017, after a reconciliation agreement with Hamas faltered, he imposed sanctions on the Gaza Strip, contributing to a humanitarian crisis there that had resulted from decade-long sanctions from Israel and Egypt.\n\nPeace process and relations with Israel\n\nDuring a summit in early 2005, Abbas and Sharon, now Israel’s prime minister, agreed to suspend hostilities, ostensibly ending the second intifada. In September, Israel completed a unilateral troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the PA assumed control of the territory.\n\nNegotiations between the PA and Israel on final status issues were renewed in November 2007, and direct negotiations continued into 2008. At the peak of the negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert—whose premiership was coming to an end amid a corruption scandal—offered Abbas more than 93 percent of the land in the West Bank, and both sides seemed to agree to other key issues on principle, including the division of Jerusalem. However, Abbas was not provided with full details of the proposal, and he refused to sign the deal on the spot. The following day Tzipi Livni was elected to replace Olmert as party leader, but she was unable to form a coalition to take over as prime minister, and Israeli-PA negotiations stalled as Israel went to early elections. Netanyahu, who returned to the post of prime minister in 2009, refused to pick up where Abbas and Olmert had left off. Aside from two unfruitful attempts at negotiations in 2010 and 2013–14, the peace process remained largely stagnant throughout Netanyahu’s premiership.\n\nRelations with the international community\n\nAfter the round of direct talks between Israel and the PA in 2010 broke down, Abbas shifted his efforts toward gaining international recognition for a Palestinian state. In September 2011 he submitted a request to the UN Security Council asking for the admission of an independent Palestinian state to the UN. The action—which was opposed by Israel and the United States—had become necessary, he argued, because the U.S.-mediated peace negotiations had placed too little pressure on Israel to make concessions for peace. The bid for recognition by the Security Council stalled when it became clear that the United States would veto it and that several other members would abstain from voting.\n\nA year after the failure of the Palestinian bid for full membership in the UN, Abbas announced that he would seek the UN General Assembly’s implicit recognition of Palestinian statehood by submitting a draft resolution requesting that the status of the Palestinian mission to the UN (officially called “Palestine” within the UN) be upgraded from “permanent observer” to “nonmember observer state.” The designation, though falling short of full UN membership, would allow the Palestinians access to international bodies and treaties that might enhance the stability and leverage of the PA. The resolution passed on November 29, 2012, with 138 countries in favour, 9 opposed, and 41 abstaining. The resolution also urged Israel and the Palestinians to resume stalled negotiations toward a two-state solution. Israeli officials opposed Abbas’s bid for recognition, saying that such unilateral actions by the Palestinians would hold up negotiations with Israel. In April 2015 the “State of Palestine” was admitted to the International Criminal Court.\n\nIn 2017 the administration of U.S. Pres. Donald Trump began developing a new peace initiative that he touted as the “ultimate deal” and the “deal of the century.” Although the PA initially received Trump and his peace initiative with optimism, relations between the PA and the United States soured in December after the latter announced that it was moving its embassy in Israel to the contested city of Jerusalem. Many perceived the action as taking sides on one of the most contentious issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Abbas announced that the PA would no longer accept U.S. mediation. In 2018 the United States, the largest donor of foreign aid to the Palestinians, began to cut funding to the PA and aid programs for the Palestinians. In September of that year, the United States ordered the closure of the PLO office in Washington, D.C., which served as the diplomatic representative of the PA to the United States.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
