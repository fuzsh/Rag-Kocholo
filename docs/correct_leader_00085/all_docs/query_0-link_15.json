        "text": "National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Ramallah with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Sullivan expressed his deepest sympathy for Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives in Gaza since October 7th. He discussed U.S. efforts to increase the flow of life-saving humanitarian assistance for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and stressed the importance of enhancing the protection of civilians. President Abbas and Mr. Sullivan discussed efforts to promote stability in the West Bank, including ongoing actions against terrorism and incitement, as well as recent measures to counter extremist settler violence against Palestinians. Mr. Sullivan reemphasized President Biden’s longstanding vision for a more peaceful, integrated, and prosperous Middle East region, and ultimately a path to a two-state solution that provides for equal measures of justice, freedom, and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\n###"
