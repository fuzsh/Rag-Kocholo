        "text": "Ramallah:\n\nUS top diplomat Antony Blinken said the Palestinian Authority (PA) should play a central role in the future of the Gaza strip, a US official said after a visit to the occupied West Bank on Sunday, as Blinken tours the region amid spiraling tensions over Israel's war with Hamas.\n\nBlinken passed through Israeli checkpoints to meet PA President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah on his second visit to the region since Palestinian Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.\n\nAs Israel continued a campaign of air strikes that Gaza health officials say has killed nearly 9,500 Palestinians, Secretary of State Blinken rebuffed calls for a ceasefire from Arab officials on Saturday after appealing, unsuccessfully, to Israel for more limited pauses to the fighting a day earlier.\n\nAs well as seeking to ensure the conflict does not spread in the region, Blinken is trying to kickstart discussions on how Gaza could be governed after the complete destruction of Hamas that Israel says is its aim.\n\nBlinken told Mahmoud Abbas that Washington believes the PA \"should play a central role in what comes next in Gaza,\" said a senior State Department official who briefed reporters traveling with Blinken.\n\nThe official said the future of Gaza was not the focus of the meeting but that PA officials appeared willing to play a role.\n\nMahmoud Abbas told Blinken that Gaza is \"an integral part\" of the state Palestinians want, according to an account of the meeting from the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, which suggested any PA role in governing Gaza would have to be part of a wider settlement of the decades-old conflict.\n\n\"We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,\" Mahmoud Abbas was quoted by WAFA as saying.\n\nThe two met for about an hour but did not address the media.\n\nMahmoud Abbas told Blinken there should be an immediate ceasefire and that aid should be allowed into Gaza, according to spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh.\n\nBlinken said the United States was committed to getting aid into Gaza and restoring essential services there, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a readout of the meeting.\n\n\"The Secretary also expressed the commitment of the United States to working toward the realization of the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for the establishment of a Palestinian state,\" Miller said.\n\nTROUBLED AUTHORITY\n\nBlinken has suggested an \"effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority\" would make the most sense to ultimately run the strip but admitted that other countries and international agencies would likely play a role in security and governance in the interim.\n\nMahmoud Abbas' PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has seen its popularity shrivel amid allegations of graft, incompetence and widely hated security cooperation arrangements with Israel. It is unclear who will succeed the aging and ailing Mahmoud Abbas, 87, a staunch opponent of Hamas.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan said on Saturday after meeting with Blinken that it was premature to talk about the future of Gaza, as they called for an immediate ceasefire to address the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the strip's 2.3 million residents.\n\nBlinken argued that a ceasefire would only allow Hamas to regroup, but is trying to convince Israel to agree to location-specific pauses that would allow much needed aid to be distributed within Gaza.\n\nWhile Hamas tightly controls besieged Gaza, the West Bank is a complex patchwork of hillside cities, Israeli settlements and army checkpoints that split Palestinian communities.\n\nViolence was already at a more than 15-year high this year but has surged further since the war began, with more than 170 attacks on Palestinians involving Jewish settlers recorded by the United Nations.\n\nBlinken credited Mahmoud Abbas for tamping down tension in the West Bank and told him he had pressed Israeli officials for accountability, the senior State Department official said."
