        "text": "'It Ends With Us'\n\nRelease Date: Aug. 9\n\nWith Colleen Hoover quickly becoming a household name in the world of romance books, fans are eagerly anticipating the first adaptation of one of Hoover’s bestsellers, It Ends With Us. The film adaptation stars Blake Lively as Lily Bloom, who has a chance meeting with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni), which sparks an intense connection. But eventually she sees sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents’ relationship. Meanwhile, her world is turned upside down after her first love Atlas Corrigan (played by Brandon Sklenar) comes back into her life. Amid high fan expectations, Hoover had to address controversy of casting choices: In the 2016 book, Lily is 23 and Ryle is 30, while Lively is 35 and Baldoni is 39. In a conversation with Today’s Jenna Bush Hager at Hoover’s Book Bonanza festival in Texas, the author said the choices fans have been concerned about were her decision. “Back when I wrote It Ends With Us, the new adult [genre] was very popular,” she said. “You were writing college-age characters. That’s what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young. I didn’t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years.” Hoover continued, “There’s not a 20-something neurosurgeon. As I started making this movie, I’m like, ‘We need to age them out, because I messed up.’ So, that’s my fault.” Hoover also defended the wardrobe choices after criticism circulated online after set photos spread on the internet.\n\n'Tell Me Lies'\n\nSeason two available to stream on Hulu on Sept. 4.\n\nMore drama and lingering secrets are in store for college students Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen (Jackson White) if the trailer for Tell Me Lies season two is any indication. In the preview for the next installment of the Hulu series, Lucy and Stephen return to college after having a dramatic breakup at the start of summer. Though the two haven’t spoken, they seemingly are quick to return to their addictive, tumultuous dynamic. But this time Lucy may want revenge for Stephen breaking her heart as she also fights for redemption. Tell Me Lies was adapted from Carola Lovering’s 2018 novel of the same name. Lovering serves as a consulting producer on the series. Meaghan Oppenheimer serves as executive producer and showrunner. Emma Roberts, her Belletrist co-founder Karah Preiss and Matt Matruski executive produce under the Belletrist banner. Laura Lewis and Stephanie Noonan executive produce for Rebelle Media. Shannon Gibson and Sam Schlaifer also serve as executive producers. The Hulu Original series is produced by 20th Television.\n\nMore Announced Adaptations\n\nMore and more books are being announced to be adapted for screen. Below, THR shares books that are set to come to life but release dates and more info are still TBD.\n\nWuthering Heights\n\nSaltburn filmmaker Emerald Fennell will adapt the classic gothic novel.\n\nEmily Henry\n\nThe romance novelist’s five books — Beach Read, People We Meet on Vacation, Book Lovers, Happy Place and Funny Story — will all be adapted for the screen. THR has a guide to the popular books.\n\nBlood Runs Coal\n\nCillian Murphy is attached to star in and produce the adaptation of the nonfiction book that Universal has acquired. The project is based on the 2020 book Blood Runs Coal: The Yablonski Murders and the Battle for the United Mine Workers of America.\n\nNever Lie\n\nNetflix has acquired the rights to Freida McFadden’s best-seller. 21 Laps Entertainment, the production banner founded by Deadpool & Wolverine filmmaker Shawn Levy, and Netflix will team up to adapt the book.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\n\nLionsgate has unveiled plans for a new Hunger Games movie, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, based on franchise writer Suzanne Collins’ new novel. Set in the Hunger Games universe, Sunrise on the Reaping returns to the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, and timed for the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. The 50th Hunger Games are noteworthy given that the victor was Haymitch Abernathy, the only winner from District 12 prior to Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark’s dual win 24 years later. Haymitch, who like all victors went on to become a mentor to tributes from his district, was played by Woody Harrelson in the Hunger Games adaptations.\n\nHis & Hers\n\nTessa Thompson will play a lead role and executive produce His & Hers, a Netflix limited series based on a novel of the same title by Alice Feeney. William Oldroyd, Bill Dubuque and Dee Johnson are writing the series with Oldroyd also set to direct the first episode and Johnson serving as showrunner. The series comes from Fifth Season and Jessica Chastain’s Freckle Films, which acquired the rights to Feeney’s book after its 2020 publication.\n\nEvery Summer After\n\nAmazon’s Prime Video has ordered an adaptation of Carley Fortune’s best-selling novel of the same name. Leila Gerstein is adapting the novel and will serve as showrunner, executive producing with Fortune. Amazon MGM Studios is producing.\n\nRemarkably Bright Creatures\n\nNetlfix has picked up a film package that adapts Remarkably Bright Creatures, the popular novel by Shelby Van Pelt. Sally Field is in talks to star in the feature that is to be directed by Olivia Newman, known for helming Where the Crawdads Sing. Newman is also writing the script with John Whittington.\n\nThe Paris Widow\n\nA TV series based on Kimberly Belle’s thriller novel The Paris Widow is in the works, kicking off a first-look deal signed between producers Brittany A. Little and Larissa Bell and Little Bell Productions and Universal Television. Little and Bell will executive produce the series adaptation alongside Talitha Watkins at ColorCreative, the production company she co-founded with Issa Rae and Deniese Davis. Novelist Belle will also produce."
