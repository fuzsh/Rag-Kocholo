        "text": "Although he has never won an Oscar, and he makes sure everybody knows it, Bob Hope was honored last night for his film career by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. A crowd of 2,700 trouped to Avery Fisher Hall to thank him for the memories.\n\nWhat made the tribute unusual was that it consisted mainly of a 70‐minute film of excerpts from Mr. Hope's films, selected and narrated by a comedian from another generation, Woody Allen. Mr. Allen titled the film “My Favorite Comedian.”\n\n“It feels pretty good, I'll tell you,” the 76‐year‐old Mr. Hope said in a pregala interview. “It's great to have your past spring up in front of your eyes, especially when it's done by Woody Allen; because he's a near‐genius. Not a whole genius, but a near genius.”\n\nMr. Hope, who was accompanied by his wife, Dolores, received a standing ovation when he walked to his seat in the hall's first balcony. He responded by blowing kisses at the audience.\n\nThe guests, some of whom paid as much as $1,000 for four tickets, included Diane Keaton, Michael Murphy and Anne Byrne, from Mr. Allen's latest film, “Manhattan,” which he was cutting at the same time he wasediting the Hope anthology; Kurt Vonnegut and Jill Krementz; Lilli Palmer and her husband, Carlos Thompson; Mary McFadden; Sylvia Miles; Shelley Winters; Carrie Nye; Andy Warhol; Bess Myerson, and Lewis and Basha Rudin.\n\nDick Cavett served as master of ceremonies, and said that his friend Mr. Allen was absent because he “breaks out in a rash” whenever he has to attend big events like the gala.\n\nMr. Cavett told the black‐tie crowd that the tribute was “to rectify a slight artistic wrong. Bob Hope has been praised for his monologues and humanitarianism, but his screen work has long been neglected. Were there any justice, he'd have at least a pair of Oscars.”\n\nMr. Cavett added that he had two theories why Mr. Hope's screen work had been overlooked:\n\n(1The radio theory: “Since Hope first became a star on radio, many people thought of him just as a radio comic who's verbally gifted.”\n\nRex Harrison Syndrome: “Like Rex, Bob makes what is terribly difficult look so easy that it is underrated.”\n\nThe film anthology included clips from 17 of Mr. Hope's 53 feature movies, including five of the “Road” films that he appeared in with the late Bing Crosby; as well as such popular Hope pictures as “The Lemon Drop Kid,” “My Favorite Brunette,” “Son of Paleface,” “Casanova's Big Night” and “Fancy Pants.”\n\nMost of them spanned the period from 1938 to 1954, because, according to Mr. Allen, “late Hope is not especially interesting.”\n\nThe anthology included comments on film by both Mr. Allen and Mr. Cavett. When a clip showing Mr. Hope and Bing Crosby riding on a camel in “Road to Morocco,” appeared on the screen, Mr. Allen's voice said: “I saw this film in 1992, when I was only 7 years old, but I knew from that moment on what I wanted to do with my life.”\n\nMr. Allen also threw in a clip from one of his own pictures, “Love and Death,” with Diane Keaton, to show how Mr. Hope's humor had influenced his own work. He ended the anthology\n\nThe New York Times/Sara Krulwich\n\nDick Cavett joined Bob Hope in singing “Thanks for the Memory,” Mr. Hope's theme song. with a clip from “The Big Broadcast of 1938,” in which Mr. Hope and Shirley Ross sing the number that later was to become Mr. Hope's theme song, “Thanks for the Memory.”\n\nMr. Hope, who received a second standing ovation when he strolled on stage after the film, told the audience: ‘I enjoyed it.” Then he broke into a 20minute monologue. “I never thought the ‘Late Show’ would come to Lincoln Center,” he said, referring to all the old film clips.\n\n“I don't know where Woody dug up these clips,” he added, his celebrated ski nose gleaming under the lights. “1 was never able to find where Paramount buried them.”\n\n“I want to thank Woody for being careful with the love scenes,” he went on. “I always worry when someone tinkers with perfection.” The audience roared.\n\nJoanne Koch, executive director of the film society, said she had gotten the idea for the Hope tribute one night last spring, while watching Mr. Cavett and Mr. Allen talk about their admiration for the comedian on one of Mr. Cavett's television shows.\n\nMrs. Koch said that Mr. Allen watched 21 Bob Hope films “from start to finish” to put together the anthology. She said that while he was watching one of the films, he cried out, “Oh, God, I put that in 'sleeper!’ “\n\nAlthough Mr. Allen had said he was “diametrically opposed” to Mr. Hope's conservative politics, their differences apparently did not affect the tribute.\n\n“That's stuff's never meant anything to me,” Mr. Hope said in an interview. “I've had writers who were diametrically opposed to me. It's such a little thing. I think we all want the same thing — a country that runs pretty good.”\n\nDiane Keaton, who was mobbed by photographers when she arrived, said that although Bob Hope had not been a major influence on her life, she attended the tribute “for its sheer entertainment value.”\n\n“I knew the film would be beautifully edited,” she added, “and I wouldn't miss it.”\n\nMichael Murphy, who plays Miss Keaton's married lover in “Manhattan,” said he was amazed to learn tiat Bob Hope made 53 films — “more than the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields combined.”\n\nMr. Hope, whose real name is Leslie Townes Hope, was born in 1903 in Eltham, England, is the seventh person to be honored by the Film Society since “name galas” were begun in 1972. The previous honorees were the late Sir Charles Chaplin, Fred Astaire, Alfred Hitchcock, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, and George Cukor.\n\nThe gala, which concluded with a cheese and dessert party at the New York State Theater, was expected to raise between $40,000 and $50,000 for various Film Society programs."
