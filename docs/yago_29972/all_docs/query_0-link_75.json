        "text": "This is a 1959 Lydia Lane article. Enjoy!\n\nLilli Palmer it one of the most popular actresses in Germany. When I lunched with her at the fashionable Humplemayer’s restaurant, she was Riven the red-carpet treatment. , Miss Palmer was in Hollywood this winter to play Clark Gable’s wife in “But Not for Me.” This was the first time she had been there in eight years. ‘”I was amazed how young everyone looked since the last time I met the m,” Lilt exclaimed. “I didn’t notice anyone looking older.” “I’m sure they said the same of you,” I said, admiring Miss Palmer’s trim figure and fresh, radiant skin. “I’ve never been in a panic about age,” she went on, “and I don’t believe I ever shall. Something Alexander Korda told me when I first started in the theater made quite an impression. I was 18, and felt this was the most perfect Re. My face was round and unlined, and I felt pretty. But Korda said, ‘Don’t worry about how you look now, but think about what you’ll be at 40.’ “It is true, with a mature face there is a different bone structure and the marks of living are seen. The King of England did not give up his throne for a girl of 18. This world-shattering romance was inspired by a mature woman. “I think it is so much wiser to take an attitude that you are going to become more attractive with each increasing birthday. I’m fortunate that my mother was an example of this. She was beautiful, and she never, worried about growing old. She seemed to enjoy every year of her life. That is the way it should be,” she exclaimed. “What a waste! Anxiety over departing youth!”\n\nMiss Palmer ordered a three-course lunch and ate slowly, with a connoisseur’s delight for good food. “How do you keep such a nice figure?” I asked. I’m very active. I swim, ski and play tennis, and I adore riding. I don’t overeat. I’ve never had a large appetite, and I don’t care for white breads, anything fried, sweets or any of the usual fattening foods. Fortunately. I’ve never had to diet, but if I had to I would.” I asked Miss Palmer the secret for her extraordinarily lovely skin. “I believe in cold water and ice. You can preserve things in ice. Animals trapped in glaciers are in perfect condition centuries later. I believe it firms, and that is the reason I use it. But I use hot water first to open the pores and then wash my skin with soap. I like creams to keep my skin soft There are many interesting experiments in cosmetic chemistry, and I believe in taking advantage of these but this cream routine doesn’t have a desperate hold on me. “The secret of youth is enjoying life; the day is never long enough for me.” Miss Palmer glowed with enthusiasm as she spoke of returning to her home in Portofino.\n\n“We have our own vineyard, and we make our own wine. The house is so high that only a gypsy can travel the perilous little route to it. The only visitor I ever had who wasn’t frightened was Helen Keller. She left a greater impression on me. She stayed for a week end and showed us such wit and wisdom that we completely forgot she can’t see or hear. What joy of living! I’ve never seen anything like it,” Lilli exclaimed. ‘The way she has surmounted her difficulties makes you count your blessings.” Miss Palmer spoke m glowing terms of her husband, actor Carlos Thompson, who was born in Buenos Aires of Swiss ancestry. “He speaks German perfectly and has become very popular here, but nationality isn’t what counts,” she observed. “I’m attracted to people because of their talents, whether it’s talent for living, gardening or the fine arts. But there are comparatively few talented women,’ she lamented, “and without a talent it becomes difficult to get through a day.” Though Miss Palmer has multiple interests, she loves to paint and is aware of the necessity of having a quiet life. ‘That is why I love Portofino. Neither of us sees people or feels any compulsion to do anything. We get up at six and are in bed very early. You can see why we return here refreshed, relaxed and with renewed enthusiasm for our work. No matter where we are, we all must learn the importance of doing nothing once in a while,” Lilli declared."
