        "text": "Lilli Palmer (German: [ˈlɪ.li ˈpal.mɐ]; born Lilli Marie Peiser; 24 May 1914 – 27 January 1986) was a German actress and writer. After beginning her career in British films in the 1930s, she would later transition to major Hollywood productions, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in But Not for Me (1959).\n\nOther notable roles include in the comedy The Pleasure of His Company (1961), the Spanish horror film The House That Screamed (1969), and in the miniseries Peter the Great (1986), which earned her another Golden Globe Award nomination. For her career in European films, Palmer won the Volpi Cup, and the Deutscher Filmpreis three times.\n\nEarly life\n\nPalmer, who took her surname from an English actress she admired, was one of three daughters born to Alfred Peiser [de], a German Jewish surgeon, and Rose Lissman (or Lissmann), an Austrian Jewish stage actress in Posen, Prussia, Germany (Poznań, Poland).\n\nWhen Lilli was four her family moved to Berlin-Charlottenburg. She was a junior table tennis champion as a young girl.\n\nCareer\n\nIn France, she appeared in an operetta at the Moulin Rouge, and then to London, where she began her film career. While performing in cabarets, she attracted the attention of British talent scouts and was offered a contract by the Gaumont Film Company. She made her screen debut in Crime Unlimited (1935) and appeared in numerous British films for the next decade.\n\nShe married actor Rex Harrison on 25 January 1943, and followed him to Hollywood in 1945. She signed with Warner Brothers and appeared in several films, notably Cloak and Dagger (1946) and Body and Soul (1947).\n\nShe periodically appeared in stage plays as well as hosting her own television series in 1951.\n\nHarrison and Palmer appeared together in the hit Broadway play Bell, Book and Candle in the early 1950s. They also appeared in the 1951 British melodrama The Long Dark Hall, and later starred in the film version of The Four Poster (1952), which was based on the award-winning Broadway play of the same name, written by Jan de Hartog. She won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress in 1953 for The Four Poster.\n\nHarrison and Palmer divorced in 1956; they had one son, Carey, born in 1944.\n\nPalmer returned to Germany in 1954, where she played roles in many films and television productions. She also continued to play both leading and supporting parts in the U.S. and abroad. In 1957, she won the Deutscher Filmpreis for Best Actress for her portrayal of Anna Anderson in The Story of Anastasia, called Is Anna Anderson Anastasia? in the UK. In 1958, she played the role of a teacher opposite Romy Schneider in Mädchen in Uniform (Girls in Uniform), the remake of the 1931 film of the same title.\n\nPalmer starred with Fred Astaire and Debbie Reynolds in The Pleasure of His Company in 1961.\n\nShe starred opposite William Holden in The Counterfeit Traitor (1962), an espionage thriller based on fact, and opposite Robert Taylor in another true Second World War story, Disney's Miracle of the White Stallions (1963). On the small screen, in 1974 she starred as Manouche Roget in the six-part television drama series The Zoo Gang, about a group of former underground freedom fighters from the Second World War, with Brian Keith, Sir John Mills and Barry Morse.\n\nPalmer published a memoir, Change Lobsters and Dance, in 1975. Reminiscences by Vivian Matalon and Noël Coward (Matalon directed Palmer in the premiere production of Coward's trilogy Suite in Three Keys in 1966) suggest that Palmer was not always the patient and reasonable person she represented herself as being in this autobiography. She wrote a full-length work of fiction presented as a novel rather than a memoir, The Red Raven, in 1978.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPalmer's first marriage was to Rex Harrison in 1943. They divorced amicably in 1957, so that he could marry ailing actress Kay Kendall before her untimely death. Palmer agreed since she was already involved with her future husband, Carlos Thompson.\n\nPalmer was married to Argentine actor Carlos Thompson from 1957 until her death in Los Angeles from abdominal cancer in 1986 at the age of 71. She was survived by her husband, son, sisters, and her ex-husband.\n\nPalmer is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. A portion of the ashes of her first husband, Rex Harrison, were scattered on her grave.\n\nAccolades\n\n1953: Volpi Cup for Best Actress for The Four Poster\n\n1956: Deutscher Filmpreis (Silver) for Best Actress in Teufel in Seide\n\n1957: Deutscher Filmpreis (Silver) for Best Actress in Anastasia, die letzte Zarentochter\n\n1959: Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination for But Not for Me\n\n1972: Goldene Kamera for Eine Frau bleibt eine Frau (ZDF TV)\n\nStar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7013 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n1974: Great Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Großes Verdienstkreuz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland)\n\n1978: Deutscher Filmpreis (Gold) for Lifetime Achievement\n\n1986: Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film nomination for Peter the Great\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1935 Crime Unlimited Natacha 1936 Wolf's Clothing Lydia 1936 The First Offence Jeannette 1936 Secret Agent Lilli 1937 Good Morning, Boys Yvette 1937 The Great Barrier Lou 1937 Command Performance Susan 1938 Crackerjack Baroness Von Haltz 1939 A Girl Must Live Clytie Devine 1939 Blind Folly Valerie 1940 Sunset in Vienna Gelda Sponek 1940 The Door with Seven Locks June Lansdowne Also known as: Chamber of Horrors 1942 Thunder Rock Melanie Kurtz 1943 The Gentle Sex Erna Debruski 1944 English Without Tears Brigid Knudsen Also known as: Her Man Gilbey 1945 The Rake's Progress Rikki Krausner Also known as: Notorious Gentleman 1946 Beware of Pity Baroness Edith de Kekesfalva 1946 Cloak and Dagger Gina 1947 Body and Soul Peg Born 1948 My Girl Tisa Tisa Kepes 1948 No Minor Vices April Ashwell 1949 Wicked City Tania 1951 The Long Dark Hall Mary Groome 1952 The Four Poster Abby Edwards 1953 Main Street to Broadway Lilli Palmer 1954 Fireworks Iduna 1956 Devil in Silk Melanie 1956 The Taming of the Shrew Katherina TV movie 1956 The Story of Anastasia Anna Anderson 1956 Between Time and Eternity Nina Bohlen 1957 The Night of the Storm Marianne Eichler 1957 The Glass Tower Katja Fleming 1958 A Woman Who Knows What She Wants Julia Klöhn, Lehrerin & Angela Cavallini 1958 The Lovers of Montparnasse Beatrice Hastings Also known as: Modigliani of Montparnasse 1958 Girls in Uniform Elisabeth von Bernburg Also known as: Mädchen in Uniform 1958 Life Together Odette de Starenberg Also known as: La Vie à deux 1959 But Not for Me Kathryn Ward 1960 Mrs. Warren's Profession Mrs. Kitty Warren 1960 Conspiracy of Hearts Mother Katharine 1961 The Pleasure of His Company Katharine Dougherty 1961 The Last of Mrs. Cheyney Mrs. Cheney 1962 The Constant Wife [de] Constanze Calonder 1962 Leviathan Mother Also known as: Dark Journey 1962 The Counterfeit Traitor Mrs. Marianne Möllendorf 1962 Le rendez-vous de minuit Eva / Anne Leuven 1962 Adorable Julia Julia Lambert 1962 L'amore difficile Hilde 1963 Miracle of the White Stallions Vedena Podhajsky 1963 Torpedo Bay Lygia da Silva 1963 Das große Liebesspiel [de] Actress 1964 Le Grain de sable Anna-Maria di Scorza 1965 Operation Crossbow Frieda 1965 The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders Dutchy 1965 God's Thunder Marie Brassac Also known as: Le Tonnerre de Dieu 1966 Zwei Girls vom Roten Stern [de] Olga Nikolaijewna Also known as: An Affair of States 1966 Der Kongreß amüsiert sich [de] Princess Metternich Also known as: Congress of Love 1966 Le Voyage du père Isabelle Quantin Also known as: Father's Trip 1967 The Dance of Death Alice 1967 Jack of Diamonds Herself 1967 The Diary of Anne Frank Edith Frank TV movie 1968 Sebastian Elsa Shahn 1968 Oedipus the King Jocasta 1968 Nobody Runs Forever Sheila Quentin 1969 Hard Contract Adrianne 1969 De Sade Mademoiselle de Montreuil 1969 The House That Screamed Señora Fourneau Also known as: La residencia 1970 Only the Cool Helen 1970 Hauser's Memory Anna Hauser TV movie 1971 Murders in the Rue Morgue Mrs. Charron 1972 What the Peeper Saw Dr. Viorne 1975 Lotte in Weimar Lotte 1978 The Boys from Brazil Esther Lieberman 1980 Weekend Judith Bliss TV movie 1980 Kinder Mother TV movie 1982 High Society Limited Hilde 1982 Imaginary Friends Ellen Pitblado TV movie 1985 The Holcroft Covenant Althene Holcroft 2018 The Other Side of the Wind Zarah Valeska (final film role)\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1938 Starlight Episode: \"Richard Hearne\" 1938 S-s-s-h!
