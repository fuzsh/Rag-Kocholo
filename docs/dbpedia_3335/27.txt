Remember Sani Emmanuel? That prolific footballer that made headlines for his performances in the 2009 u-17 FIFA World Cup....Well he has now come out to reveal why he retired prematurely from his football career even though Chelsea football club of England and Lazio FC of Italy wanted to sign him.

Emmanuel was awarded the Golden Ball as the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup hosted by Nigeria, scoring five goals to help the Golden Eaglets of Nigeria reach the final of the competition, and after the Under-17 World Cup, Emmanuel had successful trials at Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur but the moves never went through.

Emmanuel has now revealed how his injury stopped him from progressing and how many professional footballers he turned to for help couldn't help him.
