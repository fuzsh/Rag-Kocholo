This blog may have been quiet for some time. But preparation has been going on down under for the big day, the d-day and that is TODAY, Saturday 24th October 2009. Today marks the start of the FIFA Under 17 World Cup hosted in our country, Nigeria. The Eaglets are set to play against Germany in front of a 60,000 sell out crowd at the Abuja National Stadium.

Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets seek to be the 2nd nation in history to defend their title back-to-back and we believe that the selected squad are more than equal to the task. Nigerians world over have experienced heartbreak during the Super Eagles qualifying matches, with the hope for World Cup Qualification hanging on a thin thread depending on the performance of other nations. They experienced bitterness and disappointment at the Flying Eagles display in Egypt – the giant of Africa not establishing itself at all, barely scraping through the 1st round and then crashing out to Germany in the 2nd.

This is it. This is the opportunity for Nigeria to put firmly itself back on the map when it comes to football on this planet.

Knowing that football is not just about hard work and tactics but also the need for favour and grace from above, the Eaglets coach, John Obuh took his whole team to visit TB Joshua for prayers. The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations was their first landing place after the team disembarked from their journey to Qatar for training and practise matches.

Two of the 21 players selected to represent Nigeria this time around are from My People FC. Midfielder Onazi Ogenyi and Striker Emmanuel Sani are among the players that TB Joshua sponsored to Sweden tomplay professional football with Bodens BK. They spent some months there and returned home to Nigerian soil to represent their country in the World Cup.

Let’s all keep praying and support our boys to fly higher, making Nigeria and Africa as a whole, proud.
