We are one body – both those who voted for me and those who didn’t. Nobody will be left out. We are genuinely going to be reunited as FCT SWAN to plan a better future.”\n\nThe inauguration of the new FCT SWAN exco was wrapped up with the handover of the association’s assets to the new exco by the immediate past chairman, Mr Ndubueze Chidoka.\n\nGovernment Secondary School (GSS) Karu emerged overall champions in the Barrister Nyesom Wike FCT School Sports Festival which came to a rousing conclusion Thursday 14 March 2024 at the Main Bowl of the MKO Abiola National Stadium Abuja.\n\nThe fiesta began on 22 February 2024 with zonal preliminaries staged at eight centres across the six Area Councils of the FCT; Abaji, Kwali, Kuje, Gwagwalada, Tunga Maje and Tudun Wada Dutse-Alhaji.\n\nRemarkably, the championship, which was resuscitated twenty-five years after it was last held was opened to public and private Primary, Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary Schools, in the nation’s capital.\n\nIn all, eight hundred and forty athletes, who placed first, and in some cases second, at the zonal preliminaries converged on the City Centre, from March 10th, and accommodated at the hostels of the FCT Science, Technology, and Innovation Center, where six Chaperones and fifteen Members of the Organizing Committee were detailed to provide care.\n\nThe competition featured Board events like Scrabble, Chess, football, Volleyball, Handball, Track and Field, Table Tennis and Badminton.\n\nWhile the football events for Primary and junior Secondary were stood down for what the Director FCT Secondary Schools Sports Department, Mallam Hashimu Adamu Ojah called “a good course,” FOSLA Academy Karshi won the football gold in spectacular fashion on Wednesday, piping GSS Dutse-Alhaji 1-0 in a closely fought final.\n\nHaving hammered Vocational Enterprise Institute (VEI) Kuje 7-1, FOSLA, founded and owned by former President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Alhaji Sani Lulu Abdullahi, emerged overwhelming favourites to win the Gold Medal.\n\nBut the permutation looked to evaporate almost instantly as soon as the game kicked off; largely due to the heroics of the goalkeeper of Dutse-Alhaji Precious Dahunsi whose spectacular saves ensured that scores were kept low.\n\nThe match winner was Benjamin Alfa who spotted Jersey No 11.\n\nHe scored from the penalty spot in the 25th minute of play to ensure that FOSLA Academy lived up to their reputation, as FCT and National Principal Cup Champions.\n\nEarlier, GSS Tunga Maje who despite not being able to make it to the podium as overall bests, had their athletes medaling in many of the events.\n\nIn the football Senior Secondary category, they won the Bronze Medal match by edging out VEI Kuje 5-4 on penalties, after a one-all scoreline in normal time of the match that preceded the final at the Old Parade Ground, Area 10, Garki.\n\nA key attraction on the final day were wheelchair races and race-walk by special athletes from School of Children with Special Needs Kuje and School for the Gifted, Gwagwalada.\n\nBoth events overly underlined the aura of inclusivity; as the dignitaries, other students in the stands, as well as games officials, games masters and mistresses, the media and a handful of parents, cheered along as the athletes wheeled and walked across the finishing line.\n\nThe roll call of Special Guests consisting Principals and Vice-Principals of various schools, Directors and Heads of Departments of Agencies and Boards of the Education Secretariat was headlined by the presence of the Mandate Secretary, Social Development Secretariat, Ibrahim Aminu; and the Mandate Secretary Education Secretariat, Danlami Hayyo who represented the FCT Minister, Barrister Nyesom Ezenwo Wike to declare the festival closed.\n\nAbout 840 athletes are due to arrive in Abuja’s City Centre, from the eight centers, where the preliminaries of the Barrister Nyesom Wike FCT School Sports Festival 2024 held.\n\nThe arriving athletes are winners and in some cases runners-up of their respective events at the zonal prelims that held from February 22nd to 2nd March 2024.\n\nThe zones are Abaji, Kwali, Kuje, Gwagwalada, Tunga Maje, Tudun Wada, Karshi and Dutse-Alhaji; in the three categories – viz Primary, Junior and Senior Secondary Schools!\n\nArrangements have been concluded for the accommodation and feeding of the athletes at the FCT Science Technology Innovation Facility, located in Utako District, Abuja; where six Chaperones and fifteen members of the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) had been carefully chosen to cater for their well-being and welfare, until March 15th, when they will be handed back to their respective schools.\n\nAction in the Finalé of the Games starts on Tuesday 12th to Thursday 14th March 2024 and the Sports loving FCT Minister, Barrister Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has indicated his willingness to attend the Closing Ceremony, and hand out Awards, to deserving athletes and schools.\n\nThe grand finalé, will hold at the Main Bowl of the MKO Abiola National Stadium, and it’s adjoining facilities.\n\nNigeria’s premier Dambe promotion Dambe Warriors League DWL pulled off another stunner with the 8th installment of its fight series in Abuja.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated Circuit Fight 08 tournament wowed the surging crowd at the arena which couldn’t contain the overflowing fans that turned up.\n\nWhen the awaited clashes fights eventually fired off with lightweight division, the spectators went into delirium as Zayyanu and Yar Mage continued their dominance in the category.\n\nBoth fighters remain undefeated on 3-0 win loss record this season with Zayyanu dismantling Chindo while Mage beat Kudawa.\n\nAdditionally, Autan Ali Kanin Bello rediscovered his winning ways with a convincing knockout of Dogon Sisco, who has yet to find the winners circle since Season Two began and is at risk of being relegated from the League.\n\nIn the Middleweights, Shaaban and Ramadan continued their quest to match up in Superfight.\n\nRamadan destroyed Ondo by way of knockout in the third round, while Shaaban emerged victorious over Zazu on points by a score of 81-75. If\n\nThe most shocking result of the division though was the knockout of Bahagon Dogo Maitakwasara at the hands of aging legend Dan Nigeria, much to the delight of the packed arena.\n\nThe Heavyweight division proved that the cream will always rise to the top.\n\nSeason 01 champion Dogo Maitakwasara dethroned top-ranked Dogon Shamsu with a vicious first round knockout, while Ali Kanin Bello remained undefeated and dominated Dogon Sani by a score of 87-77.\n\nElsewhere, Garkuwan Dutse found the winners circle with a convincing defeat of Dage, who is yet to find success in the second season and is facing relegation.\n\nDWL Season 02 Sponsors Bet9ja, Hero Hunter Power Bikes, Infinite Energy Drinks, Indomie, Hypo, Power Oil, Colgate, Pop Cola, Amstel Malta, and Aiico are proud to bring the vision of Dambe Warriors to reality and are looking forward to bringing the excitement to Kano on February 4th.\n\nFor support and news stories: woramangra@yahoo.com or via WhatsApp on +2348084193706.\n\nNigeria’s Falconets have berthed in this year’s FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup finals after a brace by Opeyemi Ajakaye eventually brought down hard-fighting Burundi in a final round, second leg qualifying encounter at the MKO Abiola National Stadium on Saturday evening.\n\nScoreline over two legs tallied to a 3-0 aggregate victory for Nigeria in the final round of the African qualifying race.\n\nThe Falconets had won the first leg 1-0 in Dar es Salaam six days ago.\n\nAs was the case in the first leg in Dar es Salaam, the Nigerian girls created opportunity after opportunity, but failed to put them away to make their vast superiority count.\n\nAs early as the 2nd minute, Opeyemi Ajakaye, who was top scorer for the FIFA U17 World Cup bronze-winning Flamingos two years ago, volleyed wide when it appeared easier to score.\n\nIn the quarter-hour, Chiamaka Okwuchukwu swung the ball into the visitors’ box from the wing, but the team’s leading scorer Janet Akekoromowei failed to convert the opportunity.\n\nIt was Okwuchukwu’s turn to miss in the 34th minute, when she could not convert a pull-out by Ajakaye.\n\nEight minutes after restart, Ajakaye went on a solo run into the visitors’ eighteen-yard box, only to end with a weak shot that was easily collected by goalkeeper Amissa Inarukundo.\n\nThe deadlock was broken in the 78th minute by Ajakaye, who made hay with an assist by Akekoromowei.\n\nAjakaye then scored the second goal on the dot of time to put the Falconets through to the final tournament in Colombia later this year.\n\nNigeria has been ever-present at the FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup, since it was launched as an U19 tournament in Canada 22 years ago, finishing as runners-up in 2010 and 2014, and reaching the semi-finals in Japan in 2012.\n\nFor support and news stories: woramangra@yahoo.com or via WhatsApp on +2348084193706.\n\nThe Honourable Minister of Sports Development, Senator John Owan Enoh undertook an inspection tour of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Wednesday, to assess the state of facilities in the edifice.\n\nThe minister, alongside the ministry’s permanent secretary, Alhaji Ismaila Abubakar were led by Director of Facilities and Stadium Management at the Federal Ministry of Sports Development, Engr. Alanamu Abolore, as he inspected all packages of the stadium.\n\nEnoh visited the Mainbowl of the stadium, the Velodrome, facility building, athletes’ hostel, Federation and Elite Athletes Department (FEAD), Power Technical Building, as well as other facilities in the edifice.\n\nAddressing newsmen during the tour, the minister stated that “we embarked on this tour because whatever one wants to do, we have to do it from a standpoint of knowledge, and that is what I am doing. Yesterday (Tuesday) was my first day at work and I had the opportunity to take reports and briefings from all the departments, after which I left the office at about 10pm. We are trying to be as systematic as we can, with the process.”\n\n“Facilities and infrastructures are a key component of sports, as they are variables that drive both elite performance and grassroots development,” Enoh added.\n\n“It is therefore very important that we get it right. We must maintain the current infrastructures that we have, and look towards making them better, to match what we have across the world.”\n\nThe minister stated that the Moshood Abiola National Stadium has the capacity to become one of the best multi-purpose sports complexes in Africa, as he promised to give required attention to infrastructural development.\n\n“Amidst the so much that I have seen here, the positives and the negatives, this stadium is a very definitive national monument. There is about nothing that you will find elsewhere, that you cannot find here,” he said, “However from 2003 till date, the facility has gone through a lot.”\n\n“The ministry under my leadership will do all that it can, to get every part of the stadium functional, including the athletes hostel, because athletes must have the best, to be the best,” said the new Minister.\n\nMr John Enoh also added that he will visit other facilities across the country, to assess their state and take definitive actions on their development.\n\nDuring his tour, the Honourable Minister visited the training camp of Referee assessors, who are in Abuja for a development programme.\n\nSpeaking at the visit, the Minister encouraged referees to constantly update themselves with the new knowledge of the game, and make positive impacts on the domestic leagues in Nigeria:\n\n“Over the years, referees in Nigeria have been heavily criticized over their performances in our leagues but I want to trust that we will build on the recent successes achieved and win the confidence of our people.”\n\nJohn Enoh added that “Referees are critical stakeholders of the game, and we need them to be at their best at all times, for the growth of our football.”\n\nThe minister was received by the chairperson of the referees committee, Faith Irabor, who thanked him for his prompt visit."
