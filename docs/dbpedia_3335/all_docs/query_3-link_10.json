        "text": "My name is James Billiter and I am a rising Senior at University High School in Irvine, California. I will graduate in 2024 and I would like to play college soccer as an outside back while earning my degree in Business Administration. My unweighted GPA is a 3.42 and I took the ACT as a Sophomore and received a composite score of 26. I play for Marcelo Aguirre's Laguna United Elite Academy and UPSL U17 club soccer team in Southern California as well as Uni's Varsity soccer team. Marcelo has been my club coach for over eleven years and he is a great coach who develops his players. My dad is our assistant club coach and he played DIII soccer back in the 90's so he has been preparing me for the expectations required to be a collegiate student-athlete.\n\nMy Laguna team just won the UPSL U17 Championship in California and I had two goals and two assists this spring. I am an offensive outer back who pushes the attack and creates opportunities from either outer back position. In the fall, I was third on our team in scoring with one goal and five assists in ten games as our left outside back. At Uni, I led the league in assists for the second straight year as the left and right outside back. Our high school team won league for the third straight year and advanced to the round of 16 in CIF.\n\nI am interested in real estate and data analytics so I have been interning for RE/MAX Premier Realty for the last two years. Last summer, I took two summer courses at local Junior Colleges and am taking two more summer classes at Irvine Valley Junior College so that I am ready for college and ensure I graduate in four years.\n\nI am actively looking to find the right college soccer program where I can contribute to the team and earn my degree. Off the field, I enjoy going to the beach, surfing and golfing.\n\nJames Billiter\n\n949-677-8165 cell"
