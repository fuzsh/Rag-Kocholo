        "text": "Lagos – Brazil today stands tall among footballing nations not by being the most successful nation with five World Cup trophies, but by being a reservoir of talents.\n\nHaving won the FIFA World Cup a record five times, even when countries like The Netherlands are still looking for their first global title, Brazil cannot be pushed aside with the wave of the hand.\n\nThis is because Brazil has shown several times that their triumphs were not flukes having participated in every World Cup till now and performing creditably well in virtually all of them.\n\nBut contrary is the case with Nigeria. While Nigeria are the most successful nation at the U-17 tournament, the primary stage of FIFA developmental programme, with five titles, Brazil are not.\n\nIn fact, when Edson Arantes do Nascimento, popularly known as Pele, predicted in 1985, after Nigeria her first U-16 World Cup, that at the turn of that century Nigeria will win the World Cup, little did he know that his prediction will not come to pass almost half a century when it was made. Nigera have even won four more titles, but these successes have not impacted positively on the Super Eagles.\n\nThe reason why FIFA introduced age grade competitions in 1977 was to development the game through the discovery of talents early in life who will then be nurtured to play at the senior level.\n\nIn line with the ideal of the underage tournaments, several players have been spotted and have gone ahead to make waves at the senior cadre. The likes of Argentina legend, Diego Armando Maradona, and his countryman, Lionel Messi, Oleg Salenko, Luis Figo, Emil Kostadinov, Proscineski, Boban, Rui Costa and Marco Van Basten, among others, were spotted at the age grade competitions, even as some, if not all of them, did not win anything at those developmental levels.\n\nAndre Iniesta, Fernando Torres, Xavi, Ike Casila, all Spanish nationals were all product of underage championship who won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa.\n\nThese countries believe that the reason for the introduction of age grade tournaments was for discovery of talents, hence no emphasis on winning. Of the 23 players that conquered the world for France at the just concluded World Cup in Russia, only a few of them have played at any underage tourney. It should be noted that France won their first and only U17 and U20 FIFA World Cups in Trinidad and Tobago and Turkey in 2001 and 2013 respectively.\n\nHugo Lloris, their first choice goalkeeper in Russia, debuted for his country at the U-18 team on 11 March 2004 in a friendly match against Germany. Later, the U-19 team that won the 2005 European U-19 Cup. But he never won the FIFA World Cup at those levels. Samuel Umtiti, who won the World Cup in Russia, was a product of the U-17 having represented France at the U-17 to U-21 levels.\n\nBenjamin Mendy was an integral part of the French U-16 and U-17. He was a member of the France U-17 team that reached the quarter-finals at the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Blaise Matuidi has represented France at U-19 and U-21 levels but not even a global title at that level he could boast of.\n\nOther players that won the 2018 World Cup like Oliver Giroud, Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann, N’golo Kante, and Steven Nzozi, among so many of them, played for France at the cadet levels without any title to show for their exploits. This is aside the fact that these players are the ones making waves at major clubs in Europe.\n\nOne wonders why they rule the waves while Nigeria with several successes at the youth cadre best outing was a second round performance at the World Cup.\n\nFrance, like other European countries understand that age group tourneys are avenues to discover talents and expose them to international football early in life.\n\nEye brows have been raised as a result of Nigeria successes from within and outside the country.\n\nRaul Gutierres, the coach of Mexico, whom Nigeria defeated twice in 2013 to win their fourth title, expressed serious reservation about the true age of Golden Eaglets players, saying that they were doing things no real U-17 could do.\n\n“It’s the same with the Nigeria team, so with Mali, that beyond their physical development, decisions made by many of their players is not of an U-17 player,’’ the coach told mediotiempo.com then.\n\nLending credence to Gutierres’ position, a look at how the success of the Golden Eaglets has not impacted on the Super Eagles, or even the Flying Eagles and the U23 Eagles will throw more light on the ugly part of Nigerian football.\n\nWith five triumphs at the U17 level, it will be unthinkable to realize that Nigeria is still searching for its first gold medal at the U20 level, even as all the country deploy virtually the same set of players used at the cadet level to the U20 level.\n\nAccording to DAILY INDEPENDENT research, ninety percent of Nigerian players’ peak at the time they play the cadet championship, meaning that the players start experiencing diminishing returns when their performance should be for upward swing.\n\nAdokie Amiesimaka, former Super Eagles winger, said more on these sometimes ago, while accusing the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) of complicit because age cheats, he noted, give the country advantage.\n\n“Stanley Okoro, for instance, has no business in that team (2009 U17 World Cup in Nigeria), which everybody knows; he cannot be anything less than 33 or 34,” Amesiemaka, while criticizing the age of Nigerian players at the World cup.\n\n“Olarenwaju Kayode was also my player in the Sharks feeder team in 2002, he played alongside Fortune Chukwudi, both of them were mates, he too cannot be less than 29 or 30. Abdul Ajagun was one of the highest goal scorers in the league. He was also in Command Secondary School in Kaduna or so, he dropped out of school in SSS2 in the 1990s and so cannot be U-20.”\n\nThe 1980 Africa Cup of Nations winner said further: “age grade teams are meant to help develop a serious senior national team, but we are not doing that. I passed through the age grade level, I played for my secondary school, played for the Lagos team in the National Sports Festival, I played for the national academicals team, and I played for the university and the senior national team. I went through a process and that is how it should be, that is the truth.”\n\nAnthony Kojo Williams, former NFA chairman, spared no words in condemning the trend when he granted interview on the issue sometimes ago.\n\n“I don’t see Nigerian football getting out of the quagmire, the problem it is in, today, is because corruption is getting deeper and deeper. From time to time we get flashes where we do well in some competitions with overage players and we celebrate. That was one of the issues I looked at; we can’t keep using overage players. We used over-age players for junior championships, I know that. Why not say it? It’s the truth. We always cheat. It’s a fact. When you cheat, you deprive the young stars that are supposed to play in these competitions their rights.”\n\nA player cannot play beyond a certain age and that has been the case with Nigeria moving from the U17 to the Super Eagles via the Flying Eagles and the U23 Eagles.\n\nChrisantus Macaulay, who won the Golden Boot at the 2007 U17 World Cup in South Korea, for example, has since faded out. Meanwhile, Bojan Krkic, who played in that same tournament, had won the Champions’ League with Barcelona; while Toni Kroos had gone on to win the World Cup and Champions League. Kroos was 20 when he made his debut for Germany. He won the Golden Ball at that U17 World Cup in Korea in 2007, which Nigeria won.\n\nNigeria’s Dele Ajiboye’ who saved two penalties in the final match of the same competition, is a fringe goalkeeper of the Super Eagles, even as his opposite number in that final, David De Gea of Spain, is Manchester United’s very dependable goalkeeper and Spain first choice at the last World Cup in Russia.\n\nOf that squad that played and won the 2007 U17 World Cup, it was only Lukman Haruna, who was able to break into the Super Eagles, but later struggled and eventually eclipsed by real younger players.\n\nFigo played Under-20 in 1991 and only just retired in 2013, even though he did not excel at the U17 level. Xavi, Casillas, Robbie Keane, Ashley Cole, Santa Cruz, Seydu Keita, Ronaldinho, etc. played in Nigeria ‘99 U20 World Cup where they emerged champions but none of the players had earlier won the U17.\n\nBut Nigerian players at the Nigeria ’99 fizzled out as quickly as they appeared. Players such as Pius Ikedia, Julius Aghahowa, who won silver and bronze ball, ended their senior careers in 2002, even though Joseph Yobo was able to make it to 2014.\n\nSani Emmanuel, it will be remembered, was voted the best player at the FIFA U17 tourney in Nigeria, in 2009. While Ogeyi Onazi and Kenneth Omeruo, who were initially fringe players in that U17 team, found their ways into the Super Eagles, the Nigeria 2009 MVP lost it all, supposedly due to poor age management.\n\nThe cases before or after these ones also look quite startling and discouraging.\n\nGoing further, Phillip Osondu was the best player at the 1987 U-17 World Cup, after which he was signed by Anderlecht, only to drift out of the game after questions were raised about his age.\n\nWhat then is the problem? “Righteousness exalts a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people,” admonishes the Holy Bible in Proverbs 14 v 34.\n\nChief Adegboye Onigbinde, a two time former Super Eagles coach and a former FIFA and CAF technical committee member blames the Nigeria Football Federation for it.\n\nOnigbinde described administration of Nigerian football as a disaster on the premise that those running it were the ones ruining it, premising his assertion on the deliberate action of the administrators to see to the nonexistence of the Technical Department.\n\n“We are not developing our football,” he said in an interview with Saturday Independent.\n\n“There is no developmental programme in this country, yet we want to qualify for every competition and also do well. All we need to do now is start developing our football and you cannot do that without a functional technical department.\n\n“Football is a technical matter and in this country, we have relegated the technical aspect to the background.”\n\n“Developmental football has become a thing of the past in Nigeria. The Glasshouse is no more interested in raising players for the future, which is why we only have tired legs in our national team today. What we have today are average players; none of them is exceptionally good like we had in the past.\n\n“Our football administrators are only after what gets into their pockets,’ he continued. ‘I stand to be corrected, but I can’t remember the last time the NFA sent our national team coaches on training. A country like Egypt has sent well over 560 of her coaches on training and Ghana has sent more than 200 in recent time, yet we expect Nigerian coaches to perform magic.\n\n“Nigerian football has no foundation, there’s no developmental programme, you cannot get it right unless you do it the right way, the administrators should sit down and re-organise their administrative set up,” he said.\n\nThe win at all cost syndromes have been blamed for the use of over aged players at the agegrade tourneys.\n\n“When the only thing the NFF understands is winning how will the coaches not go for players that he knows will win him the title,” said a coach who pleaded anonymity.\n\n“Until we de-emphasise winning at the age grade and see them as avenues for discovering and developing talents, we will continue to witness such failures at the senior cadre.\n\n“The press is also not helping matters. When the media start giving these players too much publicity when they have not achieved anything, when parents see the national team as an avenue of escaping poverty, then the rest is better imagined,” the coach noted.\n\nThe ownership structure of the football clubs has to a great extent not helped matters. These clubs are owed by state governments and they are not interested in developing talents. The clubs are supposed to have feeder teams but how many of them truly have it?\n\nThe governors want the clubs to achieve success at the shortest possible time because they are an avenue of shoring up the governor’s image.\n\nThose appointed by the governors are to a great extent neophytes in football administration. Their only interest is lining their pockets and travelling so as to get their estacodes.\n\nIt is obvious that Nigeria, over the years, has been celebrating mediocrity over excellence. We have deployed all strengths to celebrate our inability to see beyond our noses and learn from the mistakes of the past, particularly when Nigeria was banned in 1989 over the same issue. In every U17 World Cup we won, we pop up champagnes and celebrate 22 men, who muscled their way over who should ordinarily be their juniors. Consequently, the Super Eagles, which should be the eventual beneficiary of the Golden Eaglets’ conquest, have been left even more miserable due to dearth of quality players."
