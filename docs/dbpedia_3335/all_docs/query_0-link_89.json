        "text": "This is an honest account. It actually shocked me as much as it probably will you, but it’s true. Just for the records, I am not a person who believes in miracles. Church, to me, is for the gullible. But that’s changing.\n\nIt was Friday 22nd January and a good friend finally convinced me to come with him to a church called Synagogue in Ikotun, a dirty Lagos suburb. Although I’m a chronic cynic and had\n\nheard every form of negative rumour pedalled against the pastor there, I was also intrigued at the mystique surrounding the place which has become a source of argument for Nigerians.\n\nWe pulled up within the church premises, got out and guess who I saw. Getting gingerly out of a white jeep was Joseph Yobo. Unmistakable. It was the Everton ace I had been watching a couple of days ago being battered by Benin and limping off the pitch in Angola. Out for the rest of the tournament they had said, a recurring hamstring injury. I watched him as he hobbled out, supported by a man who looked rather like him and another girl. My first impulse was to try and get a handshake, but one hefty security bloke with a stripy white shirt was following closely and shielding him from public disturbance. From a distance, I saw him go into a room on what looked like the second floor of the massive place.\n\nObviously, I decided to hang around the area to see what would happen. I mean, it’s not every day you see someone like Yobo, especially not in a place like Synagogue when news had it he was back in England for medical treatment. What happened next genuinely astounded me. Sometime later, I saw Yobo walking out, a huge smile on his face. I was taken aback as he neared and it became all the clearer – he was no longer limping, but walking freely. He was with two young men, one whom I soon recognised to be Nigeria’s U-17 MVP and ace striker Sani Emmanuel, the other his Eaglets colleague Ogenyi Onazi. And that was it. He drove off and I later went home, pretty confused to be honest.\n\nCome Sunday I was compelled to return to the church, expectant to see Yobo testifying to the congregation about what had happened. Of course it was only after the service I read in the news he had returned to Angola to join the Eagles. Healed and ready for action. But I spotted the man and lady who had brought him there. I later learned it was Yobo’s brother and his wife, who had also come with Yobo’s mother for the service. Thanksgiving I guess. The service was both intense and incredible – a real eye-opener for sceptics. I must say I’m beginning to believe in this TB Joshua.\n\nNow, my reason for writing this is simple. I am sure Yobo will play in the semi-finals against Ghana come Thursday, and I want the world to know that I am a witness why. With his surprise return to Angola, some are attributing the remarkable recovery to medical treatment in England or France, but I know the actual truth. I saw him with my two eyes. It was in The Synagogue Church in Lagos where Yobo was revived!\n\nWhat touched me also is that Pastor T.B. Joshua never stood in church that Sunday to tell people who had visited him or the miracle that had happened. I was almost expecting him to brag about it, as most other pastors probably would. I guess he knows Yobo is old enough to explain himself. And I think he is also communicating that he is not the one who did it. Humble man.\n\nAs for Yobo, I want to believe he is waiting until he plays before sharing this testimony. I was actually expecting him to call a press-conference or something similar upon returning to Angola to tell people why he’s back. But I’m sure he will. After all, if you hide your miracle, there’s no way it can last. And it’s good to acknowledge God as the source.\n\nSo, whatever the outcome of this year’s African Cup of Nations, there is one thing I now know. There are miracles. For those thinking the age of miracles has past, I think Yobo is in the best position to tell you his own experience.\n\nSOURCE:- Africa News\n\n51.492659 -0.054239\n\nAmidst stunning revelations of Pastor T.B. Joshua’s prophetic involvement in FIFA’S U-17 and U-20 World Cups, another event of international magnitude has been added to the growing list of accurate prophecies pronounced by the Nigerian cleric…\n\nPlease watch the prophecy of Prophet TB Joshua on this page\n\nOver a month earlier, T.B. Joshua had spoken forth a prophetic message regarding a strange event to occur at a place bearing the name, ‘Fort’. “This message is not even for Nigeria, but a super nation,” said the prophet during a live Sunday Service, alluding to the revelation about to be unveiled. “The name, ‘Fort’. We should pray for that name,” he continued. “It’s a parable because I’m seeing a strange person carrying something.” The pastor then demonstrated his hands cocked as if holding a gun. “We are praying for the whole world here”. The service was broadcast live via Emmanuel TV.\n\nOn Thursday, November 5th 2009, a soldier carrying two handguns opened fire on fellow soldiers at the Fort Hood Army Base in Texas, USA, killing 13 people and wounding 30 in a tragic event that elicited shock and grief throughout the nation and beyond. The incident in Fort Hood, the largest active duty armored post in the world, stands as the deadliest ever on a military base on American soil. Arguments have run awry as to the motive of such massacre, the perpetrator being a fellow American soldier, Dr. Malik Nadal Hasan, a trained psychiatrist and major decorated with a number of prestigious military awards.\n\nAddressing the nation, President Barack Obama Barack Obamasaid on the horrific shootings: “These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk and at times give their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis. It’s difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas…But it’s all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims.”\n\nComing on the heels of recent confirmations of Joshua’s prophetic insight in the football arena from the likes of Sellas Tetteh, coach of Ghana’s victorious U-20 team and John Fashanu, Nigerian Ambassador for Sports and Tourism, events continue to unveil the authenticity of such prophetic pronouncements\n\nSource: All Voices | News source\n\nOn the heels of the recent controversy sparked by insinuations that Nigerian Pastor TB Joshua had claimed glory for the Black Satellites World Cup victory through his prophetic insight to Coach Sellas Tetteh, a similar event seems to have thrown a spanner in the works of the pastors critics…\n\nA mere fortnight after the Satellite debate was at its hottest, revelations have emerged how coach of the current Nigerian U-17 Team, John Obuh, also received prophetic insight from T.B. Joshua concerning the Golden Eaglets last match with Argentina in the ongoing FIFA U-17 World Cup. Prophet Joshua also debunked the allegations of claiming glory for the Satellites triumph, referring to such statements as blasphemous and uncalled for.\n\nOn Sunday 4th November, a recorded conversation between the Nigerian cleric and Eaglets coach John Obuh was played back to The SCOAN congregation, an event broadcast live to the world via Emmanuel TV. Obuh was said to have called Joshua on Thursday, the day before the Argentine match on Friday.\n\n“I told you in under 2 to 5 minutes they will score,” Joshua was heard telling the coach. “I want to assure you – your people are going home one ahead. That is the promise of God. But for five minutes they will be very dangerous – let us mark our home. 15 minutes to go will be for us – we must make use of it.” Coach Obuh told Joshua he had already informed the players of the prophecy. Another conversation was then played between Joshua and the Eaglets assistant coach Abimbola Samuel in which he told him in a local Nigerian dialect, “Your boys will work a penalty when it is 15 minutes to go…”\n\nAs events would have it, the match followed in the footprints of the revelation, Argentina scoring in the first two minutes, Nigeria winning a penalty in the last 15 and eventually winning by one goal to top their group and advance convincingly to the knock-out stages.\n\nSpeaking to the enthralled congregants, Joshua clearly defined the role of a prophet in such scenario, demystifying the rumour that he was attempting to ascribe glory to himself. “I cannot help anyone to win any match – I am just a servant,” he carefully explained. “A prophet is to tell God’s opinion. It’s a blasphemy, sin against Holy Spirit if you say a prophet is the one who helped someone win a match. I am a gentle donkey. I am just a donkey Jesus is riding on. If somebody drops beautiful clothes, attires on the floor for the donkey to march on, it is not the donkey they dropped the attire on the floor for, but the One on top.”\n\nHe further explained how the opinion of God can guide the team concerned, but the prophet who delivers such message has no say whatsoever in the matter. “There is nothing I can do – I am just a servant. I cannot touch it, I cannot alter it. It is God that can alter anything. A prophet doesn’t make a team win – a prophet only tells you the mind of God. When we know God’s opinion, it will help us to guard against mistake and error…”\n\nThe storm that erupted in Ghana over the Satellites Saga seems not to have deterred or discouraged the Nigerian pastor, who is widely known as one of the most persecuted pastors in Africa. Using his own life experience, he encouraged the viewers and those present that they must pass through both schools of persecution and praise as part of the necessary preparation for the journey ahead. “I feel strong in challenges, believing that personal improvement and fulfilment come through the continual process of learning from both negative and positive experiences,” he explained.\n\nRecalling the words of his late mother that have been a source of inspiration for him, Joshua lyrically expounded, “When times are stable, and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.” “People will challenge you, question you, try to get you off track,” he bluntly told the audience. “Don’t listen to the temptation to act out of character.”\n\nOn the presumption that such precise prophetic revelations can be dished out according to his own will, Joshua made it clear that the God of all nations who reveals such mysteries shows no partiality, attending equally to all who come to Him in humility and sincerity. “A prophet is a prophet to all nations irrespective of where he is from, and God is the Father of all – and He treats His children equally. For those who come to Him in humility, He opens His heart – and if you receive a prophet because he is a prophet, you receive a prophet’s reward…”\n\nOn the reason for the seemingly sudden burst of prophetic revelations about football, the pastor explained it is simply part of God’s mission to save souls, especially those of young people. “God wants to win the souls of young people – and young people today are into games such as football,” he clarified. “If they now see God’s hand in their midst, they will begin to believe God. It’s a game that unites other religions and Christians, even pagans – everyone unites when it is time of the game.”\n\nSpeaking on the qualities of true ministers of God, Joshua pointed to the importance of contentment, saying it is the lack of contentment that often causes people to engage in petty and unnecessary criticism of others. “When you are content – you will not compare yourself to others, you will not stand and begin to accuse your fellow brother or pray to rebuke and destroy them… The principle of a contented man is ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ ” Instead of criticising from afar, men of God should do what is good to change the bad they see, Joshua admonished.\n\nThe same service also witnessed the testimony of an armed robber who had come to the church last week armed with a gun, and the presentation of a brand new Mercedez car to a physically challenged man who had been begging for food with his three children for many months, his electrical shop having burned down a week after his wife tragically died. The reformed robber was supported with N200,000 while the physically challenged man had earlier been given N330,300, all part of Joshua’s extensive charitable activities.\n\nSOURCE: All Voices\n\nSource: All Voices | News source\n\nRecently the Ghanaian media landscape witnessed a raging debate, mostly abrasive, over whether Prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nation’s is boasting to be the God that led the Ghana’s Black Satellite’s to victory, when Ghana became the first African team to win the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Cairo, Egypt. It was indeed Africa! The same attitude was demonstrated when President Atta Mills became the president of Ghana few month ago.\n\nWe appreciated the debate which went into the discourse, due to unbelievers but wished that it had not degenerated to the level it has, involving the press, politicians, Pastors as well as individual who have labeled the accused Prophet TB Joshua in front of news papers and online news sites with sadistic words of which some are strong worded.\n\nMy question to the press; I thought when a story comes to the knowledge of the public, it is expected that it must have gone through a thorough analysis and check by the relevant authorities. Then comes the part that ensures that all involved parties in the news are given a fair sense of hearing so that both sides of the story are not only heard but the final story that is released to the public allows for them to make an informed conclusion? When these above stated guidelines are disregarded, a major part of the ethics of the profession of journalism can be said to have been thrown out of the window; that is the case of Peace Fm, Daily Guide and certain individual running this senseless propaganda.\n\nAll these disparagement came to the limelight when the current president John Atta Mills saw the need of putting God first in leading his people. The fact is that, Ghana has had 12 head of States since the independence in 1957, who can tell me which of them has publicly honored a man of God and to seek God’s opinion on the decision they take in ruling their people ? Perhaps those whom have turned the name of TB Joshua into chewing stick, derogatory his name would love it if Atta Mills visit the Volta region to consult a fetish priest, maybe you would eulogize him then.\n\nHistory of Past and present head of state\n\nOO\n\nPresident\n\nDate of\n\nbirth\n\nDate of\n\nascension\n\nAge at\n\nascension\n\nEnd of\n\nterm\n\n1\n\nQueen Elizabeth IIQueen Elizabeth II[a]\n\n1926-04-2121 Apr 1926\n\n6 Mar 1957\n\n30y 10m 13d30y 10m 13d\n\n1 Jul 1960\n\n2\n\nNkrumah, KwameKwame Nkrumah[b]\n\n1909-09-2121 Sep 1909\n\n1 Jul 1960\n\n50y 09m 10d50y 9m 108d\n\n24 Feb 1966\n\n3\n\nAnkrah, Joseph Joseph Arthur\n\nAnkrah\n\n1915-08-1818 Aug 1915\n\n24 Feb 1966\n\n50y 06m 06d50y 6m 6d\n\n2 Apr 1969\n\n4\n\nAfrifa, AkwasiAkwasi Amankwaa\n\nAfrifa\n\n1936-04-2424 Apr 1936\n\n2 Apr 1969\n\n32y 11m 09d32y 11m 9d\n\n7 Aug 1970\n\n5\n\nOllennu, Nii AmaaNii Amaa\n\nOllennu[c]\n\n1906-00-001906\n\n7 Aug 1970\n\n64y 00m 00dabout 64y\n\n31 Aug 1970\n\n6\n\nAkufo-Addo, EdwardEdward\n\nAkufo-Addo[d]\n\n1906-06-2626 Jun 1906\n\n31 Aug 1970\n\n64y 02m 05d64y 2m 5d\n\n13 Jan 1972\n\n6b\n\nBusia, KofiKofi Abrefa\n\nBusia[d]\n\n1913-07-1111 Jul 1913\n\n1 Oct 1969\n\n55y 02m 20d55y 2m 20d\n\n13 Jan 1972\n\n7\n\nAcheampong, IgnatiusIgnatius Kutu\n\nAcheampong\n\n1931-09-2323 Sep 1931\n\n13 Jan 1972\n\n40y 03m 21d40y 3m 21d\n\n5 Jul 1978\n\n8\n\nAkuffo, FredFred\n\nAkuffo\n\n1937-03-2121 Mar 1937\n\n5 Jul 1978\n\n41y 03m 15d41y 3m 15d\n\n4 Jun 1979\n\n9\n\nRawlings, JerryJerry\n\nRawlings [e]\n\n1947-06-2222 Jun 1947\n\n4 Jun 1979\n\n31y 11m 13d31y 11m 13d\n\n24 Sep 1979\n\n10\n\nLimann, HillHilla\n\nLimann\n\n1934-12-1212 Dec 1934\n\n24 Sep 1979\n\n44y 09m 12d44y 9m 12d\n\n31 Dec 1981\n\n11\n\nRawlings, JerryJerry\n\nRawlings [e]\n\n1947-06-2222 Jun 1947\n\n31 Dec 1981\n\n34y 06m 09d34y 6m 9d\n\n7 Jan 2001\n\n12\n\nKufuor, JohnJohn\n\nKufuor\n\n1938-12-088 Dec 1938\n\n7 Jan 2001\n\n62y 00m 30d62y 0m 30d\n\n7 Jan 2009\n\n13\n\nAtta Mills, JohnJohn\n\nAtta Mills\n\n1944-07-2121 Jul 1944\n\n7 Jan 2009\n\n64y 05m 17d64y 5m 17d\n\nOO\n\nPresident\n\nDate of\n\nbirth\n\nDate of\n\nascension\n\nAge at\n\nascension\n\nEnd of\n\nterm\n\nQuestion to men of God; I would like to believe they are preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and doing all that he did during and\n\nbefore his crucifixion, if so did He preach condemnation? Did He not deliver and healed the sick? Did He not prophesy to the people? Why then has TB Joshua’s name become a subject of disparage among them? Why not ask God who is TB Joshua?\n\nDespite the whole yarn after Ghana worn the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Cairo, Egypt, Prophet TB Joshua never lay claim of the glory, but said “The coach called me in the morning of the battle in Egypt and said I should join them in prayers. I considered this as a great honor because there are many great men of God in Ghana that had also been standing in the gap for the team. And I was one of these called to join in prayer for the team. There are great men of God in Ghana. We are all prayer warriors…” It has becomes obvious that you all conspire to spoil the name of TB Joshua at all cost. We should remember all fingers are not equal and God gives as He will, and we should let the pain of one to be the pain of all.\n\nGhana U20 coach Sellas Tetteh admitting that a Nigerian Prophet T.B. Joshua decided which players he should play at the U20 World Cup. Joshua told Tetteh to make Andre Dede Ayew the key to his selection as he was the luckiest player in the U20 World Cup winning squad.\n\nTetteh admitted that they were in constant touch with Joshua throughout the tournament and he said the pastor’s predictions were true.\n\n“Before God and man I was in constant touch with Pastor Joshua all the predictions he made were realized,” Tetteh said. But Ayew who was at the centre of Joshua’s predictions says all the glory must go to God because people of all faiths contributed to the team’s success. And that was what Prophet TB Joshua said “There are great men of God in Ghana. We are all prayer warriors”… Ayew never said that he didn’t receive a call from TB Joshua; he only said all the glory must go to God. Following the words of Ayew, it is obvious he spoke to TB Joshua.\n\nIf you listen to Prophet TB Joshua, he also said all the glory must go to God. He never glorified himself but only to testify of the goodness of God. I believe he recorded the conversation just for events like this. If the miracles of Jesus were not recorded in the bible, we will not read that he made the blind to see nor made the crippled to walk. This shows that he is a Man of God indeed and a true prophet. I don’t think the man of God is giving glory to himself; rather he is glorifying the Lord for the power and anointing giving to him. Why don’t you stop criticizing and leave everything to God to judge. Prophet T B Joshua has prophesize match before and it came to past, I see no reason why you should doubt him this time. Before the match between Nigeria vs. Mozambique, he talked about it and even said he saw a goal which would be scored with the head. And it came to past that the only goal scored by Victor Obinna Nsofor of Nigeria was with his head. It is no longer arguable, with the class in which the critics have enveloped themselves; it shows the totality of their kid’s style propaganda.\n\nHad I known always comes at last; hence I have chosen to warn you as a son of the soil to stop spoiling the name of TB Joshua"
