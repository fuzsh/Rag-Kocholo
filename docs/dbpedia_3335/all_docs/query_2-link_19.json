        "text": "If you follow basketball at the high school ranks it is no secret that over the years the state of Arizona has produced a lot of NBA talent. The likes of Richard Jefferson, Mike Bibby, Deandre Ayton and so many more grew up in Arizona. All went on to great careers; some even went on to the basketball Hall of Fame. While those players were great their time has come and gone. Itâ€™s time for fans and teams alike to get ready for the next wave of great talent from the state of Arizona.\n\nMeet Stephen Emmanuel\n\nFor one player, his name may have not been in the mix of top names in the class of 2024 like Ian Jackson or Dylan Harper but lately, he is beginning to make a case for himself. His name? Stephen Emmanuel. Emmanuel, a seven-foot center, currently resides in Glendale where he plays at Dream City Christian School. Dream City in Glendale a place where players can come from all around the country. Dream City play teams from around the United States. Last season Dream City played a national schedule and came across with a record of 33-5 thanks to players like Emmanuel.\n\nPath to the bigs\n\nWhile the high school circuit is a great way to showcase your talents across your state there is another path that many players take. EYBL or Elite Youth Basketball League, is a Nike-run basketball circuit. The top youth players go and showcase their talents in front of college and NBA scouts and personnel. EYBL is considered to be the top way for youth players, boys, and girls, to get noticed.\n\nStock rising\n\nEmmanuel played on the EYBL circuit and has risen through the ranks as fast as any player in the nation. The most recent stop the EYBL had for his age group was in Augusta, Georgia the week of July 10th, and boy did Emmanuel turn some heads. While at Peach Jam, Emmanuel averaged seven points, nine rebounds, and three blocks per game. Those numbers helped him win defensive MVP of the tournament.\n\nNot only did Emmanuel win the defensive MVP at Peach Jam but his stock rose through the roof. According to Rivals, just a few short months ago in March, Emmanuel was unranked, meaning he was not in the top 150 players in the nation. As of the latest Rivals rankings on June 20th, Emmanuel has risen up to be the 117th-best player in the nation. Heâ€™s ranked as the 15th-best center in the country.\n\nIt appears that Emmanuel is setting himself up for a big senior season at Dream City. If he can continue the path he is on he will be gaining the attention of many more schools. So far, four schools have offered Emmanuel. Those are Arizona State, Kansas, Seton Hall, and just a few days ago Kansas. More offers will be showing up at his front door this upcoming season.\n\nWhere will he go? That we do not know but we have plenty of time to sit back, relax, and watch him rise through the ranks of high school basketball."
