        "text": "Wise Man Christopher, with his usual fervour, issued his message which he titled, ‘The Weapons Of Our Warfare’ to the congregation and cited many portions of the Bible to make his case clear. In his words, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but spiritual through God in pulling down every demonic stronghold. The Word, he clarified, is not on the written page of the Bible but in the lips of the believers. As Christians, you need to fill your mind and heart with the Word to speak it. In Matthew 4 : 1-11, Jesus gave Christians the battle plan when He spoke directly to the devil in the wilderness. You need to learn the value of God’s Word on your lips to confront the devil victoriously. In Ephesians 6:17, the Bible tells us that those who overcome satan will be required to use the power of the spoken Word. David, in 1 Samuel 17:45 – 50 used the Word of God in his heart as a weapon to defeat Goliath. David’s first victory was therefore in the choice of the right weapon, which was the Word of God on his lips. As Christians, Jesus has given us the Word of God as a special weapon that no power of satan can withstand. Whatever your giant or mountain, you, as a Christian, can address it with the Word of God and achieve total victory. Prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit is the most formidable weapon, the wise man concluded his message.\n\nWOMAN EFFECTUALLY DELIVERED FROM EATING HER HAIR\n\nA week after her deliverance, Mrs Josephine Eseme Jimmy, standing beside her husband, happily gave thanks to God for her deliverance as, according to her, the urge to eat her hair had completely disappeared. Josephine came to The SCOAN the previous Sunday for deliverance from addiction to eating her hair, including those on her head, armpits and private parts. She said the addiction took form after she heard a voice ordering her to eat her hair. The unusual behaviour was cultivated before her marriage and had continued since then for a length of 23 years. After her confession, Josephine was delivered in the mighty name of Jesus by Prophet T.B. Joshua who told her that she was free and would not eat her hair anymore. She said that in her dream two days after the deliverance, the demon appeared to her to lure her to the old act but immediately, the man of God also appeared and the demon ran in fear. The man of God then held her and she woke from sleep. That was the end of her addiction to eating her hair. The couple thanked the prophet one more time for being used by Jesus to bring about her deliverance. In reaction, the prophet once more established the difference between authority and power. In his words, knowing facts about Jesus does not change your relationship with Him. He however added that your reward for a relationship with Jesus is power.\n\nSPIRITUAL HUSBAND’S HOLD RELEASED IN JESUS’ NAME\n\nA video clip on the events of the previous Sunday service showed Wise Man Daniel as he laid hands on the congregants. A woman among them,Mrs Alberta Boakye from Ghana reacted by manifesting the spiritual husband in her.\n\nThe spirit, speaking through her, said Alberta was his wife who disobeyed her to marry an earthly husband. The spirit added that it had destroyed the husband’s ministry for that reason. The spirit also said their second child could not learn because of the punishment by the spiritual husband. She was then delivered after prayer from Wise Man Daniel. Standing by her pastor husband as she gave her testimony, Alberta revealed that she sensed the spiritual husband in her life at the age of 16 when it used to have sex with her in her dreams. The spirit had been a thorn in their marriage of ten years, causing her to inflict emotional pain on her husband all the time. Under the influence of the spirit, she became the husband and took delight in issuing orders to her husband and beating him. She was however relieved to be free after her deliverance.\n\nIn response to the prophet, Pastor Nicholas the husband chronicled all the shameful treatment his wife inflicted on him under the influence of the spiritual husband. She would wake up and ask her husband in the dead of night to clean the house and wash the dishes. When she knew it was fasting time for her husband, she would deliberately set food before him to break the fast unjustifiably. Either she would meet the husband in the church to fight and embarrass him or prevent him by force from going to church after he was ready. On such occasions, the pastor whose church had branches in other countries, would call his fellow pastors in the church to ask them to carry on as he was still ‘waiting on God’. He lost his congregation to other churches and the branches closed because of the wife’s abnormal behaviour. A king of the community who attended his church withdrew his membership because of the wife’s behaviour. After praying for the deliverance of the pastor, Prophet T.B. Joshua assured him that he would assist him to reactivate his ministry and re-open the branches. Asked to comment on her husband’s confession, Alberta, in unmistakable remorse said, ‘I feel bad and sad’ and bemoaned satan for all that her husband had suffered in her hands. Prophet T.B. Joshua ended the episode by explaining that it was the evil spirit inside the wife that was responsible and now that she was delivered, her husband should not remind her of the past.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM THE SPIRIT OF MASTURBATION\n\nA man from Delta, Nigeria, Solomon Ogheneovo by name, told the congregation of himself as a victim of the spirit of masturbation for 24 years. He thought that getting married would stop the embarrassing act but in fact, it continued. Even after marriage, he masturbated at least every day. After unsuccessful efforts, which included fasting and prayer, on his part to stop it, he finally decided to seek the face of the Lord in The SCOAN. After receiving the Anointing Water, he gathered his family and they prayed with it. That prayer, according to him, marked the end of his masturbation. He thanked God for using the prophet to bring an end to this torment in his life.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MENSTRUATION\n\nMrs Mercy Anthony told listeners how she regained her menstruation which ceased for seven years, completely unresponsive to her efforts to reactivate it. She said a good Samaritan gave her a virtually empty bottle of the Anointing Water which she topped with water, prayed with and ministered on herself. Following that, her menstruation miraculously reappeared. She ended her testimony by advising all her listeners to trust God who has an answer to whatever problems they might have.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MEMORY AND FETCHES PROMOTION\n\nRahamat Yusuf Suleiman had an accident in April which, among other injuries, affected her memory. This affected her reading and preparation for her promotion examination in her workplace. The result was that she failed the examination and was denied promotion. After efforts elsewhere to find a cure had failed, she sent a friend to The SCOAN for the Anointing Water.\n\nOn receiving the Anointing Water, she prayed with it and sprayed it on herself, particularly her forehead. Soon after, to her amazement, she vomited an earthworm. The Anointing Water gave her total healing and following her prayer with it before going for another promotion examination in her workplace, she found the questions the same as the ones she had read, making her pass the examination with ease. As she gave her testimony, Rahamat displayed her promotion letter which was the outcome of her success in the examination. Rahamat advised her listeners to go to the Lord always for a solution to their problems.\n\nCHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR THE AGED, DISABLED AND CHILDREN WORLDWIDE\n\nThe Emmanuel TV Team and Partners as usual filled trailers with gifts of rice, flour and other food items and transported them to the elderly and physically challenged both within Nigeria and internationally.\n\nTwo of the many states in Nigeria that were visited by The Emmanuel TV Team were Yobe and Borno in the far north of the country. The team set off with two trailers each filled to capacity with rice and flour, in addition to cash gifts. The venue for the meeting with the Emmanuel TV Team was General Hospital Leprosy Centre, Maiduguri. People gathered from all around Borno State to attend the meeting.\n\nThe team sent by T.B. Joshua presented the community leaders with cash gifts and the bags of rice were distributed among everyone, regardless of race, faith or background. The Bible teaches us that we should love our neighbours as ourselves. In the same vein, various gifts were also dispatched to the needy and elderly people in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. In the Asian continent, Lahore, Pakistan was also visited with bags of rice, flour and other gift items.\n\nFINANCIAL AID TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS\n\nIn the course of the service, five visually impaired students from the University of Jos were led to the platform where they narrated their financial problems as students, one after another.\n\nYakubu, a student of Special Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, was the first to bare his mind about his financial needs as a student and concluded that he needed the sum of N92,000.00 to pay his school fees and solve other problems as a student. The rest, in turn, also spoke, explaining that as students, even the money to release their results was hard to come by. Upon listening to their complaint, the prophet directed that their needs be met. Consequently, a total sum of N284,300.00 and bags of rice were disbursed among them.\n\nMASS PRAYER FREES ALL\n\nPraying in the power of the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua led the congregation and viewers worldwide in a powerful time of mass prayer. Many vomited the poisons long buried in their systems, thus receiving their freedom. The prophet prayed for the total release of his listeners in many areas of their lives, including their finances, businesses, marital lives among others. He also prayed for the restoration of their destinies and health. In the course of the mass prayer, the prophet issued prophecies to some people who, in reaction came forward to confirm the prophecies. Confirming that the entire congregation had been delivered and was free, the prophet proceeded to say the grace and bring the service to a close.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nTO HIS POWER NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE\n\nIn a spirited sermon to awaken the congregation to the power of God,\n\nProphet T. B. Joshua reminded the Church of the greatness of God and His ready disposition to forgive sins, however grievous some of these sins may be. In his words God is capable of doing anything and also forgiving any sin. To His power nothing is impossible. Breaking in on the choral music which had been reverberating all over the Church and to which the congregation responded in unison with elegant steps, Prophet T. B. Joshua enthusiastically spoke on the forgiving spirit of God with copious illustrations. In his words, the past is forgiven. We have seen a sinner’s character healed, the drunkard becoming sober, the harlot becoming chastened and the liar becoming truthful. “What then is the fear?” he asked the congregation. He spiritedly reminded his listeners that if they trust in God, that trust will save them. Trusting in the suffering of Christ is enough to save us, deliver us and make us whole. He concluded the sermon by advising the congregation to remain in trust.\n\nWHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED?\n\nThe Wise Man introduced his message with a series of questions. How do we achieve a desired goal? Who wants to be saved? What must I do to be saved? He aptly referred the congregation to Acts 16: 29-32 which provided the answer to his questions: Believe in the Lord and you will be saved. According to him, God has promised salvation for whoever shall trust His Son. Race, age brackets, academic qualifications, wealth or any other attribute cannot save us outside Christ. If you are willing to be saved, Jesus is willing. Jesus brings hope and succour to those who trust Him. He is the bread to the hungry and road map to the lost. Whatever you are, you need Christ to be saved. God has a role to play in your salvation just as you too have a role to play. It takes your willingness and God’s ability to bring about your salvation.\n\nOur hearts and minds must be reset to agree with God’s plan for our lives. You must get rid of those things that derail you from God. You cannot experience peace under the dominion of satan. Satan is sin. Another name for satan is sin.\n\nQuoting Psalm 51:7 as a reference text the Wise Man admonished the congregation on the need to be cleansed of sins. According to him King David saw the need to be cleansed. Wash me with water whiter than snow and remove all impurity. David knew he would not have place in God’s kingdom unless he was washed from sins. In his sins, David could not see anything other than the fruit of sin: failure in the family, in the battle field etc. Unless you are cleansed of your sins, your blessing will receive challenges. The attitude of repentance and faith in your heart keeps you closer to God. Mistakes are correctable. If you make a mistake, don’t run from God; run to Him. Because David ran to God in spite of his sins, he remains one of the greatest Kings in Israel today. Your Father in Heaven has anticipated your sins and prepared for you. You have not committed an unpardonable sin. Our lives are in God’s hand and we cannot please Him without a thorough reformation of heart and life. God requires a heart that does not bear grudges. Doubts and unbelief put us on the wrong track. Jesus loves you just as He does any of His children. Jesus is able to forgive all our sins, he concluded.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF APOSTLE PAUL HAS ARRIVED IN MACEDONIA\n\nWise Man, Harry and his wonderful performances in Macedonia attracted his comments. The prophet told the congregation that the crusade in Macedonia attracted a large turn out of participants. It was so wonderful and even comparable to those spiritually hosted by the prophet himself in Indonesia and Singapore. It had to be extended to the following day i.e. Sunday and Monday. Wise Man, Harry also revealed to Prophet T. B. Joshua his vision to be in Macedonia especially close to Paul and Silas’s prison for tourists to see the wonders of God.\n\nA clip on the wonderful works being performed by Wise Man, Harry surfaced on the screen and the congregation watched with rapt interest.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF BROKEN HOMES\n\nMr and Mrs Ifah brought out their children and Mrs Ifah, the spokesperson accused their daughter, Judith of witchcraft before the entire congregation. She narrated how a baby of hers died mysteriously after a period of excessive stooling. She painted a picture of lack of peace in their family and of the sickness of her husband which had defied healing.\n\nThe daughter, Judith Ifah confessed to being a witch and added that it was the result of the fruit juice which she accepted from one of her classmates. She said she told her mother the dream she had after taking the juice and her mother prayed for her. She revealed that the giver of the juice asked her to bring their baby to the coven and that was the cause of the baby’s death. She said that she ate the baby. She also revealed how she was advised to use a rope to tie her father to his bed and cause his health to deteriorate. All these feats would attract to her a second position in the witchcraft world.\n\nIn reaction, Prophet T.B. Joshua advised parents to bring up their children in the way of the Lord to have peace. The child in question was left in the hands of satan because of the parents’ carelessness. The prophet pronounced Judith a witch or demon possessed as presented by the parents.\n\nHe then asked the parents to lay hands on her and ask every unclean spirit to leave her. That was how Judith was delivered. The prophet however warned both parents not to call her a witch after the deliverances.\n\nINTERNET VICTIM\n\nA lady by name Memory, from Zimbabwe but living in South Africa confessed how she was hoodwinked promises of monetary offers on the internet. She was taught incantations which she mastered but none of the promises materialised. Instead, her marital home became bedevilled with problems to such an extent that she used the police to eject her husband from the home. She then pleaded with the man of God for deliverance. At the exclamation of the name, Jesus by one of the evangelists she fell down and was delivered.\n\nACCUSATION OF WITCHCRAFT\n\nOne Emmanuel Chijoke and his relations all of the Abraham family from Enugu complained about the problems of setback and deaths in their family attributing all this to their mother.\n\nThe genesis of the accusation was a crusade in Abuja at which one of Emmanuel’s cousins was a participant and where he was told by a man of God there that their mother was the brain behind all the woes in the family. The said man of God was then invited to Enugu where he confirmed his earlier vision that their mother was a witch and that only her head and shoulders was human; the chest down to the feet was vulture in appearance. Surprisingly to the family, their mother could not refute the accusation by the man of God. She complained that at that time, her eyes, ears and mouth were muffled and she could not talk.\n\nShe then challenged the family to take her to anywhere and they would realise that she is not a witch. This was the reason they came to the SCOAN.\n\nIn his verdict, the man of God pronounced the woman witchcraft negative and ordered the children to kneel down to her in apology.\n\nFOOT ULCER HEALED\n\nBefore the prayer line, the participants of which were zoomed on the screen,\n\na lady, 20 year old Miss Sulman who was healed of foot ulcer came to give testimony and also made to show herself to those in the prayer line to reassure them of their healing.<img src=”https://thetbjoshuafanclub.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/10-10-10-g-4.jpg?w=200&#8243; alt=”” title=”10-10-10 [G] (4)” width=”200″ height=”300″ class=”aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1990″ />\n\nHIV AIDS TESTIMONIES\n\nThree men and three women who were healed of HIV AIDS came to give their testimonies. Among them who spoke was 27 year old Mrs Motunrayo Sowemimo,\n\nwho was tested positive with Hiv aids type one in the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja.\n\nAfter the prayer line where she was declared free, she said she became stronger and ate with more relish.\n\nShe went back to the same hospital for another test but thanks to God, she was Hiv negative this time.\n\nSCHOLARSHIP BENEFICIARIES\n\nMiss Oduwole Olayinka, a youth worker in the church who came bagged 1st class (Electrical/Electronics), University of Lagos also got a scholarship award from the Church to do a Master degree in one of the best universities in the world. She consequently applied for admission and was offered same in three good universities in the United Kingdom. These were the Universities of Southampton, Edinburgh and that of Surrey.\n\nShe picked the University of Southampton as the best and the Church paid a total sum of £13,900 as her fees. Later and in consonance with the man of God’s crave for the best, the University College, London, offered her admission. Without hesitation, she changed her mind and picked the latest offer. A total sum of £18,245 was paid as fees for her to start classes on the 11th of October 2010.\n\nThe man of God seized the opportunity to advise the congregation to always look for the needy to help rather than waiting at home for the needy to come to them. In this way, according to the prophet, they would not be helping the wrong people.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nA touching interview in Nigeria’s daily sports paper, Complete Sports, with My People FC’s Sani Emmanuel, who has learned from Prophet TB Joshua that we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give… Excerpts\n\nGolden Eaglets striker Sani Shehu Emmanuel rose from the depths of obscurity to worldwide recognition when he came off the bench to score five goals and helped his team to second place at the just concluded U-17 World Cup.\n\nIn this interview with MIKE NDIDI, Emmanuel narrates his story from the squalor of a one-room apartment to life as an altar boy in Prophet T.B Joshua’s church and now, on the verge of a major breakthrough in professional football.\n\nHe regrets the death of his mother but remains grateful to the Synagogue Church of All Nations where he has found home and is desperate to help other kids out of poverty as soon as he makes it big in his chosen career.\n\nCongratulations for winning the MVP award and Silver Shoe. How do you feel getting into this stage?\n\nI am glad because I have always wished and dreamt that God would crown my effort with success though I was not happy we lost the cup.\n\nTell us about your background?\n\nI am from Edo State, specifically I hail from Auchi in Etsako East Local Government Council. I was born and raised in Kano but my parents moved over to Abuja in 2003. My father is a Muslim but I am a Christian because I am now born into a Christian family.\n\nWhat do you mean that you are born into a Christian family?\n\nThe man of God, Prophet T.B Joshua has been responsible for the up-keep of my whole family..\n\nHow did you make the U-17 National team?\n\nI was playing for my church Synagogue Church of all Nations’ team, My People Football Club when I was invited to the national U-17 national team screening exercise after a friendly match with the U-17 team. But before now I played for a local team in Abuja from where I joined Abuja YSFON team. The same year I won a scholarship to Naval YSFON Academy in Calabar but I couldn’t complete my Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination. I dropped out in S.S. 3.\n\nHow was your stay at the Academy in Calabar?\n\nIt was very brief and I returned to the Synagogue of All Nations. I am an Altar boy. The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B Joshua took an exceptional liking for me and offered to help me.\n\nTell us about your family?\n\nMy mother and father got separated when I was still a very small boy but unfortunately my mother is late now. She died when I was still very young. We are nine in number and I am the seventh child in the family of which five are boys and four are girls.\n\nHow many of your brothers play football?\n\nAll of us, except my elder brother who the man of God, Prophet T.B Joshua is sponsoring in school. Although none of them has attained the level God has taken me to, I still have one of my brothers who is a goalkeeper and he is presently with My People FC and the rest are staying with my father in Abuja.\n\nWhat is your father’s occupation?\n\nMy father is a tailor and we were struggling to survive. You won’t believe it that we hardly fed every day. We lived in a deplorable place in Maraba in Abuja. My father does his tailoring business in a small hut in the front of our house where he puts his sewing machine every day. I never attended Primary School in my life and it was when I went to Calabar that they put me in school. So I never enjoyed any basic education like my fortunate colleagues. Prophet T.B Joshua is today catering for my family.\n\nYou were described as a super-substitute, how do you feel about this?\n\nGod was very faithful to me and each time I was introduced into a match I always had the conviction that I would score.\n\nYour predecessors, the 2007 Golden Eaglets won the FIFA U- 17 World Cup in Korea and were rewarded with houses and national honours. What will you wish to be honoured with, even though you only managed to win silver.\n\nI can’t begin to mention. Before I came to the U-17 National team like I earlier said I am from a very poor family. But thank God today, He has used the nation (Nigeria) to bless me. I will continue to be very grateful for getting the opportunity to play in the U- 17 National team.\n\nIf you are rewarded with 100 million naira for winning the U- 17 World Cup, what will you do with the money?\n\nFirstly, I will go to the orphanage and donate a substantial sum out of the money because I passed through a lot of difficulties growing up as a child. I couldn’t feed and I could not go to school because my father could not afford my school fees and I have always prayed and wished that one day I could touch the lives of the less privileged ones.\n\nHave you been contacted by any agent for a foreign deal?\n\nProphet Joshua had earlier sponsored me to Europe for trials. I was in Sweden for four months before I came back to join the national U-17. I have always wished for a football career in Europe and I belief now that I have distinguished myself in the U- 17 national team, offers will start coming to begin a soccer career in Europe.\n\nWhich Coach has had the biggest influence on your football career?\n\nAll the coaches I have played under.\n\nWhat is your greatest regret and who did you missed the most that you would have loved to share this moment of joy with you?\n\nMy regret is that my mother is not alive to see what I have turned to be in life.\n\nWhat is your best meal?\n\nRice and stew.\n\nWhat are your favourite cars?\n\nI am not a car freak and it has never crossed my mind to own a car anyway.\n\nThank you for talking to us.\n\nThe pleasure is mine, sir.\n\nSOURCE: Complete Sports\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nHumility simply means total dependence on God for everything…\n\nOn the heels of the recent controversy sparked by insinuations that Nigerian Pastor TB Joshua had claimed glory for the Black Satellites World Cup victory through his prophetic insight to Coach Sellas Tetteh, a similar event seems to have thrown a spanner in the works of the pastors critics…\n\nA mere fortnight after the Satellite debate was at its hottest, revelations have emerged how coach of the current Nigerian U-17 Team, John Obuh, also received prophetic insight from T.B. Joshua concerning the Golden Eaglets last match with Argentina in the ongoing FIFA U-17 World Cup. Prophet Joshua also debunked the allegations of claiming glory for the Satellites triumph, referring to such statements as blasphemous and uncalled for.\n\nOn Sunday 4th November, a recorded conversation between the Nigerian cleric and Eaglets coach John Obuh was played back to The SCOAN congregation, an event broadcast live to the world via Emmanuel TV. Obuh was said to have called Joshua on Thursday, the day before the Argentine match on Friday.\n\n“I told you in under 2 to 5 minutes they will score,” Joshua was heard telling the coach. “I want to assure you – your people are going home one ahead. That is the promise of God. But for five minutes they will be very dangerous – let us mark our home. 15 minutes to go will be for us – we must make use of it.” Coach Obuh told Joshua he had already informed the players of the prophecy. Another conversation was then played between Joshua and the Eaglets assistant coach Abimbola Samuel in which he told him in a local Nigerian dialect, “Your boys will work a penalty when it is 15 minutes to go…”\n\nAs events would have it, the match followed in the footprints of the revelation, Argentina scoring in the first two minutes, Nigeria winning a penalty in the last 15 and eventually winning by one goal to top their group and advance convincingly to the knock-out stages.\n\nSpeaking to the enthralled congregants, Joshua clearly defined the role of a prophet in such scenario, demystifying the rumour that he was attempting to ascribe glory to himself. “I cannot help anyone to win any match – I am just a servant,” he carefully explained. “A prophet is to tell God’s opinion. It’s a blasphemy, sin against Holy Spirit if you say a prophet is the one who helped someone win a match. I am a gentle donkey. I am just a donkey Jesus is riding on. If somebody drops beautiful clothes, attires on the floor for the donkey to march on, it is not the donkey they dropped the attire on the floor for, but the One on top.”\n\nHe further explained how the opinion of God can guide the team concerned, but the prophet who delivers such message has no say whatsoever in the matter. “There is nothing I can do – I am just a servant. I cannot touch it, I cannot alter it. It is God that can alter anything. A prophet doesn’t make a team win – a prophet only tells you the mind of God. When we know God’s opinion, it will help us to guard against mistake and error…”\n\nThe storm that erupted in Ghana over the Satellites Saga seems not to have deterred or discouraged the Nigerian pastor, who is widely known as one of the most persecuted pastors in Africa. Using his own life experience, he encouraged the viewers and those present that they must pass through both schools of persecution and praise as part of the necessary preparation for the journey ahead. “I feel strong in challenges, believing that personal improvement and fulfilment come through the continual process of learning from both negative and positive experiences,” he explained.\n\nRecalling the words of his late mother that have been a source of inspiration for him, Joshua lyrically expounded, “When times are stable, and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.” “People will challenge you, question you, try to get you off track,” he bluntly told the audience. “Don’t listen to the temptation to act out of character.”\n\nOn the presumption that such precise prophetic revelations can be dished out according to his own will, Joshua made it clear that the God of all nations who reveals such mysteries shows no partiality, attending equally to all who come to Him in humility and sincerity. “A prophet is a prophet to all nations irrespective of where he is from, and God is the Father of all – and He treats His children equally. For those who come to Him in humility, He opens His heart – and if you receive a prophet because he is a prophet, you receive a prophet’s reward…”\n\nOn the reason for the seemingly sudden burst of prophetic revelations about football, the pastor explained it is simply part of God’s mission to save souls, especially those of young people. “God wants to win the souls of young people – and young people today are into games such as football,” he clarified. “If they now see God’s hand in their midst, they will begin to believe God. It’s a game that unites other religions and Christians, even pagans – everyone unites when it is time of the game.”\n\nSpeaking on the qualities of true ministers of God, Joshua pointed to the importance of contentment, saying it is the lack of contentment that often causes people to engage in petty and unnecessary criticism of others. “When you are content – you will not compare yourself to others, you will not stand and begin to accuse your fellow brother or pray to rebuke and destroy them… The principle of a contented man is ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ ” Instead of criticising from afar, men of God should do what is good to change the bad they see, Joshua admonished.\n\nThe same service also witnessed the testimony of an armed robber who had come to the church last week armed with a gun, and the presentation of a brand new Mercedez car to a physically challenged man who had been begging for food with his three children for many months, his electrical shop having burned down a week after his wife tragically died. The reformed robber was supported with N200,000 while the physically challenged man had earlier been given N330,300, all part of Joshua’s extensive charitable activities.\n\nSOURCE: The Ghanaian Journal, Modern Ghana, All Voices\n\nRead Full Post »"
