        "text": "May 31, 2003\n\nSTANFORD, Calif. - The University of Oregon men's and women's track and field teams had a field day qualifying-wise in the second and final day of the first-ever NCAA Western Regional Championships, held at Stanford's Cobb Track and Angell Field.\n\nThe Duck added seven individual qualifiers (and the 4x400 relay) to their NCAA invite list and featured a pair of sprint champions, while the UO women added three individual qualifiers and boasted their second victory of the meet. The top five finishes from every event will automatically qualify for the upcoming NCAA Championships (6/11-15 in Sacramento), while an additional 6-8 athletes will be invited from across the nation this week based on a season best list for those non-qualifiers that didn't advance from this weekend's four regionals.\n\nSaturay's qualifiers raised the men's likely NCAA invite list to 13 (Santiago Lorenzo-decathlon, Jason Hartmann & Ryan Andrus - 10K; and Adam Kriz - hammer, Eric Logsdon-5K from Friday's West Regional opening day), while the Oregon women should have at least an eight-person party (Abby Andrus - heptathlon; and Elisa Crumley & Roslyn Lundeen - javelin), Becky Holliday and Niki McEwen - pole vault from Friday's West Regional opening action).\n\nOn the men's side Saturday, the Duck sprint crew led the way with wins courtesy of senior Samie Parker in the 100 (10.25w, w:.8) and freshman Jordan Kent in the 200 (20.99, w:.8), to go along with four more sprint and hurdle qualifiers and another field event invite. Parker claimed the first win of the meet for the Men of Oregon with his third fastest time of his career (10.25w, w:.8) and only slightly slower his Pac-10 prelim (10.18) and final (10.25w) efforts two weeks ago.\n\nOregon's second-fastest 100 man ever entered the meet seeded third (and fifth nationally) based on season bests, yet led the prelim efforts from Friday's qualifying round (10.34).\n\n\"I said the same thing after Pac-10s, I wanted to go out and just take care of business and just worry about myself,\" Parker said, I was relaxed coming in and was ready to run. My starts have been getting better, and I started out alright today. In the middle phase, I stayed relaxed and knew I was out there, and finished it off the same way.\"\n\nParker - the football team's leading receiver last fall with 49 catches (14.8 avg.) and 8 touchdowns - is enjoying his finest outdoor season on the oval after his second, fourth-place honors indoors in the NCAA 60-meter dash. I knew I can compete with the best sprinters if I had the training, so I'm not surprised by how things have went,\" Parker said. \"I have some work to do before nationals and am looking forward to mixing it up with the nation's best.\n\nEqually at home in the blocks was another two-sport star, as freshman Jordan Kent had a breakthrough effort in the 200. Running out of lane eight, the Eugene native and Churchill High School graduate dashed to a .10-second personal best at the finish line (20.99) after leading much of the first half of the race, then surged again in the final stretch to hold off USC's Wes Felix (second, 21.06).\n\n\"It's nice to feel like a sprinter again,\" Kent said. \"I came in here healthy and ready to go, and have to credit Felix for pushing me to a PR. Most people complain about lane eight, but it fits me pretty well because of my height. I tried to get out and make sure I stayed relaxed and not push too hard. I knew I was fighting for the lead after the first 100, but was surprised I still was there at 150. Hopefully I can do better at NCAA's, but this was a lot better than I expected coming into the meet.\n\nThe sixth-fastest pre-meet seed, Kent raced the event only once this weekend as the final-only event featured only eight qualifiers who had met the season standard of 21.20. Saturday's race was only his fourth half-lap race of two-month season, as the first-year Duck improved on fifth-place finish in the Pac-10 Champs (21.47), while his season best of 21.09 came in his Oregon Twilight win early in May.\n\n\"After watching the Pac-10 meet on TV, I looked really slow and sluggish two weeks ago,\" Kent said, \"so I took a few days off after the meet and rested a minor groin injury. The last seven weeks, I've felt better after every weekend of training, and have now added some endurance work. I knew I needed to be patient and be smart in my training, and it would come around eventually.\"\n\nKent also made his first season appearance on the 4x400 relay and provided an extra boost as the Ducks qualified for the NCAA finale the hard way by winning the slower section. The unit of freshmen Travis Anderson, Matt Scherer and Jordan Kent and junior Brandon Holliday cruised to a 1 1/2-second season best and three-second heat victory to eventually rank second overall (3:08.05) among the two heat's nine entries. Stanford won the faster heat with a one-second-faster time (3:07.23).\n\n\"The 4x400 qualifying was the crowning moment for me,\" Kent said. \"It's been a long time since I ran a relay leg that far. I was hoping that I could finish it off and not drop a 48-second bomb and ruin our time.\n\n\"Another freshman sprinter, Matt Scherer, opened the day with his second personal best in as many days in the 400. The Sumner, Ill., native took another .06 seconds off his personal best from Saturday and ranked fourth in Saturday's final (46.56). That time moved him up three positions to seventh all-time for the Ducks, only two days after he entered the meet seeded 12th based on his Pac-10 then-season best of 46.87.\n\nIn the hurdles, freshman Eric Mitchum continued to impress and took third in the 110 hurdle final (13.95) behind seniors Ryan Wilson of USC (13.54) and Tim Bodganof of Cal (13.66). Mitchum's time was only .20 seconds of f his personal best from the Pac-10 meet (13.75) and stood as his seventh sub-14.00 effort in 12 races this season.\n\n\"This wasn't any easy meet, especially when you're a freshman trying to act a lot more mature,\" Mitchum. \"I didn't worry about the pressure, and just tried to stay focused. I must have done a decent job, since I don't remember anything from the race (even though he hit the first three hurdles). The time wasn't great, but I'm glad I advanced, and I competed hard.\n\n\"Later in the afternoon, junior Brandon Holliday's season took an upswing with a fifth-place finish in the 400 hurdles with a .45-second season best (50.73), while UCLA swept the top three places led by senior Kyle Erickson (first, 50.14). Holliday avenged a fall in the Pac-10 prelims of the event after winning the league title as a sophomore in 2000.\n\n\"The time wasn't that great today, since was hoping for a PR,\" Holliday said, \"but it was top five and that's all that matters right now. I hit hurdle five and that scared me a little, and I wasn't sure initially how I would recover from that. But I stayed focused and tried to keep my head up because I was worried about hurdle eight which has been my enemy in three meets this year (Texas, Pomona, Pac-10's). Yesterday's prelim gave me a lot of confidence, partly because I haven't had a real race since the Oregon Invite at the end of April. Then today, I was glad to get lane three today - that's my favorite. After Pac-10s, I felt a lot less pressure this time around since there is no extra team scoring factors to worry about. I didn't see the other (UO) sprinters' races today, but everybody kept telling me about it before my race, so that helped get me focused and more confident. Coach said at that point we only had three sprinters qualified so we needed a fourth so Samie could have a roommate at NCAA's, so I'm glad I could accommodate him.\"\n\nIn the field, former NCAA javelin champion and redshirt senior John Stiegeler earned his second NCAA trip. The Coos Bay, Ore., native uncorked an eight-foot season best (fourth, 228-2), in an event won by Boise State's Rob Minnitti (241-4) over Cal Poly's Ryan James (second, 240-7). Stiegeler's mark improved on his prior season best of 220-0 from his Pepsi Team Invite win in April and was his third meet at 219-11 or better this season in five appearances.\n\nAlso in the javelin, junior and Pac-10 champ Adam Jenkins fell four feet shy of a second Duck invite but still netted a one-foot best (seventh, 222-4). The Gladstone, Ore., native is still up for consideration for one of 6-8 at-large bids for the NCAA finale that will be awarded this week, and he ranked 28th in the nation last week with his prior best of 221-4 from the Oregon Invite.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Brett Holts earned his first NCAA invite in the steeplechase by running most of the race close to his final position (fifth, 8:50.70) in the heat and overall. The Bend, Ore., native and harrier All-American also claimed his second-fastest career effort, and just shy o f his best of 8:48.81 from the Cardinal Qualifier at Stanford earlier in May. Idaho's Jan Eitel won the heat and event (8:45.49).\n\nIn other distance action, freshman Ryan Flaherty capped his season with an eighth-place finish in the 800 final (:53.47), while USC's Raphael Asafo-Agyei won the tactical final (1:50.05). Flaherty ended the year with a season best of 1:49.65 that was less than a second shy of the UO all-time list, while he finished third in his recent Pac-10 debut (1:50.36).\n\nAmong other men's results, senior triple jumper Foluso Akinradewo ranked seventh overall (50-11 1/2, w:.6) with his third-best mark of the season, and sophomore Derek Strubel added 13th (48-9). Senior James March added 13th in the shot put (54-10 1/4) with his second-best mark of the season. The Hillsboro, Ore., native made his championship debut after throwing Pac-10 qualifiers in the shot put (55-7) and discus (171-10) during the regular season,but couldn't attend the meet due to a maximum meet travel roster of 24 athletes. In the pole vault, redshirt senior Jason Slye tied for 1th (16-1 1/4), while redshirt freshman Jon Derbuy tied for 18th (16-1 1/4). Junior Trevor Woods no-heighted at his opening height of 17-3.\n\n\"We had an outstanding series of individual efforts one after another, especially on the track,\" Oregon men's coach Martin Smith said. \"The two champions on top of the other qualifiers was an extra icing on the cake. The neatest thing was the 4x400 relay. They were again forced to run in the slow section (like Pac-10's) in what was ultimately a time trial by themselves - yet still advanced by running faster than almost every team in the fast section. John (Steigeler) boosted his confidence a little today with a season best and buys himself another meet to get stronger, and Adam had a personal best. Eric (Mitchum) showed a lot of grit in the 110 hurdles after hitting several of the first hurdles pretty hard. He kept his concentration, and stayed with it and found a way. Brett also ran a smart, competitive steeple and is one of four qualifiers from that group for nationals, and joins Eric (Logsdon, 5K), Jason (Hartmann, 10K) and Ryan (Andrus, 10K). The conditions were great and Stanford should be commended for putting on a good meet.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Duck women featured three NCAA invites and top-five finishers Saturday from field event action - including a win in the discus - while several others took aim at season and personal bests.\n\nIn the discus, senior Mary Etter claimed her fifth and most important win of the season with a two-foot, six-inch season best of 179-7. The Everett, Wash., native earned her fourth NCAA trip in the event and is a two-time All-Ameican thanks to eighth-place finishes as a freshman in 2000 and junior in 2002.\n\n\"I didn't feel so hot coming in,\" Etter said, \"and I started to get down emotionally even before it started. But then I realized what I was doing, and told myself, 'No, you're not going to count yourself out - this is your last meet, an there's no reason you can't throw well.' I got a low 170-foot throw early so I knew I'd probably advance with that, so that made it easier. It was funny - I thought my second throw was going to be an 180 but it was only a 160, while on my third throw I didn't use my legs yet still threw my best of the day. In the finals, I was consistently over 170 even without any pull in my technique. There's still more there - when I use my legs and start to have a pull, I might actually get a good shot at the school record (180-9). The win wasn't such a big deal, more than I competed head-to-head with the nation's best throwers and do well.\n\nEttered entered Saturday's final ranked fifth nationally in the event, and edged returning NCAA champion Chaniqua Ross of UCLA who took second (176-10) with a mark nearly three feet behind Etter.\n\nThe upset bug also bit senior Amanda Brown who springboarded off a ninth-place ranking in the triple jump to finish second (41-5) with a 7 1/2-inch best. The Eugene, Ore., native and Sheldon graduate didn't enjoy an auspicious start, however, and owned a halfway best of 39-10. However, once she made the final, she took advantage of the extra attempts despite not practicing the past two weeks because of a right ankle injury.\n\n\"It was a rough prelim,\" Brown said, \"and I didn't think I had a shot at advancing. But as I watched the other flight jump poorly, it started to hit me that I had a shot. Luckily, I really paid attention to their technique since it was the top flight, and I incorporated some of their tricks for the first hop of my technique. In the prelims, I was moving too fast and rushing through it, but once I saw them with a smoother hop on the first try, I tried it and it felt so much better. Even though my ankle hurt with every step, especially after I tweaked it on my second jump, I just blocked it out and kept going straight ahead.\"\n\nBrown's dedication paid off as she nearly bested all of her Pac-10 competition after the former Duck basketball player (at least for her freshman season) took sixth in the conference finale the past two seasons.\n\n\"You could tell the others weren't up for this meet as much as Pac-10s,\" Brown said. \"Way back at the start of the season, I kind of knew this meet would give me a much better chance of qualifying for nationals. Looking back over my career, I believe things happen for a reason and I guess today maybe it showed that I was meant to be a track athlete and one that would go to nationals.\"\n\nSimilar qualifying rumblings occurred in the hammer ring as senior Jordan Sauvage followed a similar method for her ticket to Sacramento. The North Bend, Wash., native had upped the school record to 191-4 in the opening week of April - a mark that ranked her eighth coming in Saturday - but had only topped 180 feet once in the past month. That changed Saturday as Sauvage improved on a prelim effort just past 179 feet that ranked her eighth overall, and climbed to fifth with a daily best on her fifth (183-11) to eventual rank fifth in the final standings.\n\n\"Wow, I'm still in shock,\" Sauvage said. \"Coming in, I shouldn't have been able to make the finals with a 179-foot prelim throw, but it was a crazy day. A lot of people couldn't get it going. Normally I start off with my better throws earlier, but today I felt better and more confident as I went along. I came in as an underdog, so I wasn't nervous. In the final after my fourth throw, I realized that there were three people from 179-181 feet battling for fifth place, so I attacked my fifth try. I had nothing to lose and it just happened. On the sixth attempt, I tried to go all out, but the ball got a little behind me. The worst part was having to wait for all the other throws those last two rounds to go (since she was throwing early in the round) and hoping they wouldn't pass me. Coming in, I was more focused on finishing my career with a good mark, and not so much about nationals. But once I was in the prelims, it really started to hit me that this was my last meet, so I made an attempt to really re-focus and give it everything. I've been doing well in practice, so I was hoping to throw farther today, but I can't complain. The conditions were great out - even though it was really early (10 am), there was still a fair share of hammer addicts cheering you on, but not too many.\"\n\nIn the center of the track, senior high jumper Jenny Brogdon improved on her 17th-place seeding to tie her personal best of 5-9 1/4 and rank ninth among the 27-jumper field. The LaGrande, Ore., native had jumped that mark only once before, in her runner-up finish in the Pac-10 Championship last year. This time, she tested her coach's and teammatess patience by relying on two attempts to clear 5-5 1/4, and three attempts at 5-7 3/4 and 5-9 1/4.\n\n\"I'm so happy to come away with a personal best,\" Brogdon said. \"Even though I needed some third attempt tries, that didn't bother me. I was more determined, and since it was my last meet, I would't consider the alternative - another miss. At 5-5 1/4 on my first try, I got up a little high but was a step too close so I adjusted and got it on the next one. At 5-7 1/4, I told myself that this was the time I needed to step up because that's usually the dividing line between the field. At 5-9 1/4, I felt calm and focused, so much that I still didn't feel my tendinitis injury and got it on the last one. My first try at 5-10 wasn't so good, but they got better as I went on and almost got it.\n\nBrogdon wrapped up a season that smacked of consistency and featured final clearances at her season best of 5-7 in six outdoor contests, including the Pac-10 Championshis (eighth), to go along with another mark at the same height indoors.\n\n\"Looking back, I would have loved to have gone higher, especially since I had always dreamed of going six feet since I was a freshman,\" Brogdon said. \"But this was a solid way to end it, and to be the #6 all-time jumper in school history - only five others can say they've gone higher.\"\n\nAmong Saturday's other Duck competitors, senior steeplechaser Alicia Snyder-Carlson missed her season best by only seven seconds (25th, 11:04.46) after entering the meet seeded 31st with a season best of 10:57.72. Junior Jill Hoxmeier made her first appearance at the championship level and took 27th in the discus (140-9). The Aloha, Ore., native entered the meet seeded 32nd based on her season best of 151-9 from the Cardinal Qualifier at Stanford three weeks ago (5/9).\n\n\"We had probably our best day in a long time,\" Oregon women's coach Tom Heinonen said. \"We competed hard and well, and it started off with Jordan Sauvage ranking top five and throwing herself into NCAA's. Jenny Brogdon PR'ed in the high jump. Amanda Brown scraped her way into the final, then had a huge PR on her fifth jump. Mary Etter came in not feeling good but still threw well when most of the field had off days. Alicia Snyder-Carlson ran near her personal best and was competitive. I'm really proud of the kids we have going to nationals because they definitely earned it. Everyone qualified that we needed to, and getting Jordan and Amanda was a huge bonus. I think a lot of coaches will learn to like this meet because it forces athletes to perform well head-to-head at the end of the season, and there's a lot of surprises that happen along the way which is also good for the sport.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the Ducks will await to see if any other athletes are extended at-large invites to raise the field sizes from 20 to 26 to 28 entries. The top men's candidate, junior Adam Jenkins may improve from his 28th-place ranking in the nation from last week (221-4) thanks to his one-foot improvement Saturday (222-4). On the women's side, the Ducks with the best at-large chances would be senior Eri Macdonald and junior Kirsten Riley who ranked 33rd and 25th nationally last week, albeit Riley was in a tie for that position. The NCAA championships committee will likely invite a total of 26-28 athletes per individual events.\n\nFull West Regional meet results are available at the www.GoStanford.com website, and more NCAA Regional and Championships information is available at the www.NCAAsports.com website\n\nAfter Saturday, the Duck M&W have 10 days before the NCAA Championships return to California for the first time since 1968. Sacramento State will host the four-day meet at Hornet Stadium, Wed.-Sat., June 11-14. The USA Championships return to Stanford the following week, Thu.-Sun., June 19-22, as will the USA Junior Championships, Fri.-Sat., June 20-21.\n\nFINAL RESULTS\n\nNCAA Track & Field West Regional\n\nCobb Track and Angell Field\n\nStanford University\n\nStanford, California\n\nSaturday, 5/31/2003\n\nAttendance: 1,500\n\nConditions: Breezy, sunny, temps in mid-to-upper 70s.\n\nMEN'S TEAM SCORES - 1, UCLA, 101. 2, USC, 92. 3, Oregon, 71. 4, Stanford, 69. 5, BYU, 67. 6, Arizona State, 45. 7, California, 40. 8, Boise State, 38. 9, Arizona, 32. 10, CS Northridge, 22. 11, Northern Arizona, 19. 12, Washington, 17. 12, Washington State, 17. 14, Utah State, 16. 14, Cal Poly, 16. 16, Idaho, 14. 17, Weber State, 10. 17, Riverside, 10. 19, Eastern Washington, 7. 20, Idaho State, 6. 20, Cal State Sacramento, 6. 20, CS Fullerton, 6. 20, Portland State, 6. 24, Irvine, 4. 25, Fresno State, 3. 26, Long Beach State, 2. 27, Portland, 1.\n\nWOMEN'S TEAM SCORES - 1, UCLA, 138., 2, Stanford, 77. 3, USC, 76. 4, Arizona State, 55. 5, Oregon, 48 1/2. 6, Washington State, 43. 7, BYU, 42. 8, San Diego State, 39. 9, Arizona, 34. 10, Cal Poly, 30. 11, Washington, 26. 12, California, 23. 13, CS Northridge, 19. 14, Idaho, 16. 15, Idaho State, 14. 16, Boise State, 13. 17, Weber State, 10. 17, Northern Arizona, 10. 19, Santa Barbara, 7 1/2. 20, Portland State, 5. 21, Utah, 4. 22, Utah State, 3. 22, Long Beach State, 3. 24, Southern Utah, 1.\n\nMEN'S RESULTS\n\n100 - (w: 2.8) 1, Samie Parker, Oregon, 10.25. 2, Rashad Allen, Northridge, 10.36. 3, Bennie Chatman, Washington St., 10.40. 4, Hung Nguyen, Northridge, 10.48. 5, Luiz Mello, Arizona St., 10.52. 6, James Sattem, Portland St., 10.63. 7, Ricci Dula, California, 10.66. --, Francis Ngapout, Boise State, DNF.\n\n200 - (w: 0.8) 1, Jordan Kent, Oregon, 20.99. 2, Wes Felix, USC, 21.06. 3, James Finks, Boise State, 21.09. 4, Hung Nguyen, Northridge, 21.15. 5, Matt Nielsen, BYU, 21.65. 6, Paul Smith, BYU, 21.67. 7, Landon Benson, N.
