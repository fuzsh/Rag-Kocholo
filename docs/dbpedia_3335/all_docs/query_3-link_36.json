        "text": "My goal is to play at a Division 3 school at least. I know I would make a good candidate for the team because I strive to do better. Whenever I miss up, the next day I focus on that mistake and improve my skills to make sure I do not make that mistake again. I am a team player, where I do not blame one person for a mistake but I blame the team because they could not help that one player recover. What makes me different from others in character is that I do not get cocky when I start over someone else, instead I just see it as a chance to show my skills, and when I don't start I see it as a message to work harder during practice and sessions. I might not be the fastest or the strongest but I can be the smartest where I can see the field in front of me, and tell my teammates how to possession themselves to make the best possible play."
