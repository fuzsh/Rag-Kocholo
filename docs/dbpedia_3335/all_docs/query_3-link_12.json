        "text": "Captain of the first Nigerian team to win a world cup title: Nduka Ugbade (born 6 September 1969).\n\nNduka Ugbade was captain of the Nigeria U-16 male soccer team that won the 1985 Kodak/FIFA Football World Cup in the U-16 category(later referred to as JVC/FIFA at the following edition after which it metamorphosed to its current name and status -Coca Cola/FIFA U-17 WC). The event was held in China and brought Ugbade into prominence after Jonathan Akpoborire (5mns) and Victor Igbenoba (80+mns)scored unreplied goals for Nigeria against West Germany, securing what was Nigeria's and Africa's first major win in football on the global stage.\n\nFour years later in the U-20 category, he was also part of Nigeria national football team at the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship that placed second and won silver medals at the FIFA U-20 Football World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Nigeria lost to Portugal in the final match, but Ugbade and his team mates were the toast of the spectators after posting spectacular wins over hosts Saudi Arabi, highly favored United States, and the USSR against which the Nigerian team recovered from a 4-0 deficit to level 4-4 with Ugbade scoring the fourth and the country winning on penalties. This win is fondly referred to in Nigerian football history as the \"Damman Miracle\".\n\nIn August 2011 he was appointed by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to be one of the two assistant coaches for the Golden Eaglets (Nigeria under-17 national football team).In 2013 his team won the silver medal in the CAF U-17 championship tournament in Algeria.\n\nThe 1985 team which is the first Nigerian 18-man team to win the U-16 world cup : Lucky AGBONSEVAFE, Tenworimi DUERE, Nduka UGBADE, Fatai ATERE, Binabei NUMA, Kingsley AIKHIONBORE, Salisu NAKADE, Sani ADAMU, Jonathan AKPOBORIE, Victor IGBINOBA, Billa MOMOH, Imama AMAPAKABOR, Baudwin BAZUAYE, Joseph BABATUNDE, Chukwuma NWOHA, Mohamed YAHAYA, Hilary ADIKI, Dele ABUBAKAR. Coach: Sebastian BRODRICK-IMAUSEN.\n\nThe first Sub-Saharan African and First Nigerian to win African Cup of Nations both as a Player (1994) and as a coach (2013) - Stephen Okechukwu Keshi is a retired Nigerian football player. He was born in 23 January 1962 and was captain of the squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup and played in five different African Nations Cup tournaments, helping Nigeria to win the 1994 African Cup of Nations.\n\nHaving finished his professional playing career, Stephen Keshi got special coaching education in the USA.\n\nFrom 2004 till 2006 he headed the Togo national team and led them to their first ever FIFA World Cup championship in 2006.\n\nKeshi also coached the Mali national team from April 2008 for two seasons but was sacked in January 2010, after Mali's early exit in the group stages of the African Cup of Nations. He was appointed the head coach of the Nigeria national team since 2011 leading Nigeria to qualify for the African Cup of Nations. He is only the second African to win the African Cup of Nations both as a player and as a coach, the first being Egypt's Mahmoud El-Gohary in 1959 as the game's top scorer and in 1998 as a Egypt's National team Coach. Keshi is also the first Nigerian captain to qualify Nigeria for the world cup.\n\nIn 2014, Kechi became the first Nigerian indigenous coach to lead Nigeria to the Round of 16 of a FIFA World Cup finals completion at the Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup finals. Nigeria played against Iran (0 – 0), Bosnia-Herzegovina (1 – 0) and Argentina (2 – 3) to reach the knock out stages of the competition. The two previous times Nigeria reached the knock-out stage of the FIFA World Cup competition was in 1994 (coached by Clemens Westerhof of the Netherlands) and 1998 (coached by Bora Milutinovic of Yugoslavia).\n\nThe first Nigerian footballer to be awarded the CAF African Footballer of the Year award: Rashidi Yekini (1993).\n\nYekini was born in Kaduna on 23 October 1963. After starting his professional career in the Nigerian league, he moved to Côte d'Ivoire to play for Africa Sports National, and from there he went to Portugal and Vitória de Setúbal where he experienced his most memorable years, eventually becoming the first division's top scorer in the 1993–94 season after scoring 21 goals; the previous campaign he had netted a career-best 34 in 32 games to help the Sadinos promote from the second level, and those performances earned him the title of African Footballer of the Year in 1993, the first ever from the nation.\n\nYekini took home the prestigious Bola de Prata trophy given out by O Bola newspaper. It was the first top scorer title for Setubal since Francisco Rodrigues did the double between 1943 and 1945. No Vitoria Setubal player has since won the top scorer title. He died in Ibadan on 4 May 2012 at the age of only 48\n\nThe African Footballer of the Year award, presented to the best African footballer each year, has been conferred by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1992. An earlier African Footballer of the Year Golden Ball award was given out between 1970 and 1994 by France Football magazine. The changes resulted in parallel Golden Ball awards given out to Abedi Pelé and George Weah in 1993 and 1994 by the magazine although the CAF sponsored awards for those years were won respectively by Rashidi Yekini and Emmanuel Amuneke, as well as two awards given to Abedi Pelé in 1992. France Football discontinued the election from 1995 after the European Ballon d'Or - also awarded by the magazine, had been opened to all players in the European leagues.\n\nNigerian National Federation for American football championed by Amobi Okoye Foundation, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) and USA Football, establishing Africa's first (American football) football Federation (March 13, 2011): run by Amobi Okoye\n\nAmobi Okoye (born June 10, 1987 in Anambra, Nigeria) is an American football defensive tackle for the Houston Texans of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Texans 10th overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Louisville.\n\nOkoye was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, a member of the Igbo ethnic group. He moved to Huntsville, Alabama, United States when he was 12 years old. After only spending two weeks in middle school, he tested into the 9th grade. He first started playing football as a sophomore at Lee High School, knowing virtually nothing about the game before his high school coach suggested he go play Madden NFL football to learn. By the time he was a senior, he won first-team All-State honors as both a defensive lineman and offensive lineman. Because he shares the same surname as former Kansas City Chiefs running back Christian Okoye, some sources have claimed that the two are related. Amobi says they are not related, but the two families live on adjoining land in Nigeria\n\nAt age 15 Okoye chose the University of Louisville over Harvard, privileging the strong football program of the former over the academic reputation of the latter. Nevertheless, he plans to attend graduate school at Harvard eventually.\n\nAt Louisville, Okoye majored in biology. He later switched his major to psychology and graduated a semester early, thereby completing his degree in three and a half years. At 16, he became the youngest player in the NCAA. Okoye played in all 13 games as a true freshman at defensive tackle and was credited with 17 tackles and a sack. He recorded then-career-best three tackles against Tulane and recorded his first career sack against UTEP.\n\nOkoye was drafted by the Houston Texans as the tenth pick of the first round of the 2007 NFL draft. He is the youngest player to ever be drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft at only 19 years old. He was the highest draft pick to come out of the University of Louisville since the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nOkoye signed a six-year deal with the Texans on July 26, which allowed him to begin training camp with his teammates the next day. With his first start, Okoye became the youngest player to appear in an NFL game since 1967.\n\nOkoye was named Defensive Rookie of the Month for September 2007 after leading the AFC with four sacks. He is the youngest player ever to receive the award.\n\nThe first Nigerian British-Born American football defensive player to have won a Super Bowl ring (February 3, 2008 at the Super Bowl XLII games held at the University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona): Ositadimma \"Osi\" Umenyiora. He joined Scott McCready and Giants teammate Lawrence Tynes as one of three British-born players to have won a Super Bowl ring. Osi was born in Golders Green, London on November 16, 1981 to Nigerian parents. His family moved back to Nigeria and later to Auburn, Alabama, where he started playing football in high school. He is of Igbo descent, and his full first name means in Igbo \"from today on things will be good\"\n\nOsi Umemyiora attended Troy State University and started 46 of 48 games for the Trojans. As a senior, he was named All-America honourable mention and All-Independent 1st team selection by The NFL Draft Report.\n\nBy the end of the New York Giants’ 2007 season, Umenyiora's 13 sacks helped the Giants to an NFL regular season-leading 53 sacks. The Giants had a surprise victory in Super Bowl XLII over the New England Patriots, in part because of their strong pass rush performance. Umenyiora had four tackles in that game, three of which were solos. Umenyiora made a second Pro Bowl appearance in 2007.\n\nOn January 5, 2005, Osi's team, the New York Giants played against the New England Patriots at the National Football League (NFL) Super Bowl XLVI championship games held at the Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana for the 2011 season winning 21 - 17.\n\nOn March 27, 2013 Umenyiora signed a two-year deal worth $8.55 million with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe first Nigerian to captain an Ice Hockey team in NHL history: Jarome Iginla (born July 1, 1977).\n\nJarome is a Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). A six-time NHL All-Star, he is the Flames' all-time leader in goals, points, and games played, and is second in assists to Al MacInnis.\n\nHe became the first 18-year-old to play for the Flames since Dan Quinn in 1983 when he appeared in two games for the Flames in their series against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympics Ice Hockey event, he scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.\n\nHe is also considered the first black captain in NHL history along with Dirk Graham. Dirk Milton Graham (born July 29, 1959) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Chicago Blackhawks and Minnesota North Stars in the National Hockey League. He is considered the first black hockey captain(along with Jarome Iginla), given that one of his parents is bi-racial. Late in 1988–89, Graham was named team captain, the first player of African descent to become team captain in the National Hockey League. He captained the team all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1991–92, where they were swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nThe First Nigerian to win the United States’ National Basketball Association (NBA) leagues’ Most Valuable Player (MVP) award: Hakeem Olajuwon (born January 21, 1963)\n\nOlajuwon is the third of six children and acquired the basic values that pushed him to succeed from his parents, who were middle-class and owned a cement business in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nIn 1993-94 he had a storybook season, becoming the first player to be named NBA MVP, NBA Defensive Player of the Year and NBA Finals MVP in the same season. The following season he rallied the Rockets from a sixth seed in the playoffs to their second straight NBA crown, making Houston the fifth NBA franchise ever to win back-to-back titles. He was also the first foreign-born player to win the league's MVP award.\n\nDuring his 18-year career, Nigeria-born Hakeem Olajuwon staked his claim as one of the greatest players in NBA history. Long considered a physical marvel since his days at the University of Houston, his aesthetic and productive play - highlighted by his Houston Rockets' back-to-back NBA titles - earned him a place among the game's best.\n\nNigeria’s first and only medal at the inaugural World Championships in Athletics: Ajayi Agbebaku (Bronze – Triple Jump)\n\nThe inaugural World Championships in Athletics were run under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations and were held at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, Finland between August 7 and August 14, 1983.\n\nAjayi Agbebaku was born on January 6, 1955 and is a retired Nigerian triple jump athlete.\n\nHis personal best jump was 17.26 metres, achieved in July 1983 in Edmonton. This is the Nigerian record as well as second in Africa, only behind Ndabazinhle Mdhlongwa. He holds the African indoor record with 17.00 metres, achieved in January 1982 in Dallas. The 1983 Summer Universiade, also known as the XII Summer Universiade, took place in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada between July 1 and 12, 1983. More than 2400 athletes from 73 countries participated.\n\nNigeria's first official participation at the Commonwealth Games: 1954\n\nIn the 1950 Games, Joshua Majekodunmi of Nigeria & Alan Paterson of Scotland tied for the silver medal in the High Jump, however Nigerian athletes first participated officially in the Commonwealth Games in 1954 and they won several medals. In the High Jump, Emmanuel Ifeajuna (yes, the same Major Ifeajuna, a hero of the 1966 coup d'etat) created a new British Empire and Commonwealth Games record by clearing the bar at 6 ft. 8 in, earning him Nigeria's first Commonwealth Games Gold; Nafio Osagie took the bronze in the same event. The Nigerian team also set a new record in the 4 X 100 yards relay by recording the same time of 41.4 seconds as Canada very narrowly beat them into the silver medal position. Another narrow defeat which gave Nigeria a silver medal was on the Hop, Step and Jump (now called Triple Jump) in which Peter Esiri jumped 50 ft 0 in., one inch less than the winner. Nigeria’s third silver medal was won in the Long Jump by Karim A. B. Olowu. That same team also won 3 bronze medals; one each in High Jump, Long Jump and Boxing and came fourth in the 100 yards.\n\nNigeria qualified for the first time to represent Africa in a senior World Cup and did it in grand style. She became the first country to win her first World Cup match and the first to advance beyond the first round in her attempt. Although the Eagles lost in the second round\n\nThe feat performed by the Golden Eaglets in Japan is memorable. For the second time, Nigeria won the FIFA under -17 championships making her the First and only country to achieve such feats. In a world of football giants like Brazil, Italy, Germany and Argentina, the feat of the Golden Eaglets and Nigeria is indeed spectacular.\n\nSports began to take serious roots in the country in 1963 when the National Sports Commission (NSC) began to function under Abraham Ordia as secretary. The 60’s were a period of laying foundations and the only visible achievement was the qualification of Nigeria's Green Eagles for the Olympic Games held in Mexico in 1968.\n\nThe first Time Nigeria won the African Cup of Nations (1980): The bronze medals won in 1976 and 1978 in the African Cup of Nations were improved upon in 1980. The Christian Chukwu led Green Eagles won the Cup for the first time in Lagos.\n\nNigeria's Junior Eagles qualified for the first time to represent Africa (alongside Ivory Coast to represent Africa from the CAF 1983 African Youth Championship) in a Junior World Cup in Mexico. Although, Nigeria did not go beyond the first round having lost 0-3 to Brazil she beat highly rated USSR 1-0 and held Netherlands to a goalless draw. The 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship, the fourth edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship, was held in Mexico from June 2 to June 19, 1983.

He is responsible for what could be described as a \"golden\" period in Nigerian football. Players such as Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Nwankwo Kanu, Rashidi Yekini, Daniel Amokachi and others, who all went on to successful careers with various high-profile European clubs, entered the world spotlight while playing under Westerhof.\n\nWesterhof began his career as an assistant coach with Feyenoord Rotterdam in the Dutch Eredivisie.

The team played warm up games in England against various amateur teams like Dulwich Hamlet, Bishop Auckland and South Liverpool. Nigeria’s National Football Team was named ‘the Red Devils’ pre-independence, the name of the team, changed to Green Eagles after independence, originated from the country's coat of arms that has an eagle perched atop a shield. In 1994 the 'Green Eagles' gave way once again to 'Super Eagles' after the national team conquered the rest of Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations and also qualified for the World Cup for the first time, however, some claim the change of name was as early as 1988 when the Eagles got to the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations and lost to Cameroon (Credit: Segun Odegbami - 27/02/2012)."
