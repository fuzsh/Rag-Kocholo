        "text": "Not only did its teams impress at the World Cup, but young Africans plying their trade for Europe's top clubs is becoming more and more common place.\n\nJust look at Lacina Traore or Dominic Adiyiah. They're two talented young African footballers who are some of Europe's top prospects and could very well become Africa's next great strikers. Many clubs send scouts to watch African football leagues more often.\n\nLet's take a look at five young footballers in Africa who have everything it takes to be among the continent's next great strikers.\n\nKermit Erasmus currently plays for Supersport United in South Africa and has been widely considered South Africa's next great striker, even drawing comparisons to the likes of Pele and Wayne Rooney.\n\nThe young striker has represented South Africa at the youth levels and scored an impressive 10 goals in 15 appearances, earning him his call-up to the senior squad.\n\nErasmus also had a short stint in Europe with Dutch club Feyenoord, where he was loaned out to second division Excelsior. There he had considerable success, scoring 11 times in 30 matches but the 20-year-old failed to impress and returned to the South African Premier League, where he will look to boost his reputation.\n\nVery few know Ange Dnagbo, but those who do have touted him as Cote d'Ivoire's next great striker, after Didier Drogba, of course.\n\nJust 19 years of age, he plays for the prestigious Ivorian club ASEC Mimosas, though he was a youth product of Sewe Sports.\n\nHe has been scouted by Birmingham City, Portsmouth, Bolton and Tottenham Hotspur, but was unable to secure a work permit, thus halting his move to Europe.\n\nOkay, I cheated! Osas Idehen is currently playing for Vicem Hai Phong in Vietnam, but just a few months ago he was in Africa playing for Nigeria's Enyimba FC.\n\nAt that club, he scored an amazing 25 goals in 30 appearances, earning him his Nigerian call-up, in which he scored a brace against Congo DR.\n\nThe talented young striker has immense pace and a brilliant eye for goal, but after an unsuccessful trial with Danish club Brondby he was offloaded back to Africa.\n\nNow he is playing in Vietnam, an unarguably smaller stage, even though he has everything it takes to ply his trade in Europe.\n\nAlthough Zimbabwe isn't one of Africa's larger footballing nations, their future is looking very bright given the talented young player they have in Knowledge Musona.\n\nThe Kaizer Chiefs striker is only 20 years old but has been very effective this season for the South African club, notching an impressive 10 goals in 17 appearances.\n\nThough somewhat small in stature, he possesses a deadly eye for goal and it is reported he is being sought after by some of Europe's top clubs.\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest African prospect at the moment, it's a wonder than Sani Emmanuel isn't playing in Europe yet.\n\nHe had a short stint with Bodens BK in Sweden, where he was very impressive, and has earn a call-up to Nigeria's youth squads.\n\nEmmanuel put up an extremely impressive performance at the 2009 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, in which he scored five games in as many matches. He has had trials at Chelsea, Tottenham, Panathinaikos and a few other European clubs.\n\nHis trials at Chelsea and Tottenham were successful, but he could not reach a deal due to work permit issues. He has since return to My People FC in Nigeria, but it shouldn't be long before he is at one of the world's top clubs."
