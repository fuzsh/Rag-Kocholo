        "text": "Wayne Rooney\n\nAfter exploding onto the scene as a teenager playing for his boyhood club, the world woke up to a new English superstar. Rooney would play for one of the biggest and most storied teams in English football, scoring a hat-trick on his debut in the UEFA Champions League. Easy. Wayne Rooney was a pure goalscorer, of all kinds of goals. A world class playmaker and team player, he would muck in wherever he was needed. Rooney won five Premier League titles, three League Cups, an FA Cup, a UEFA Champions League, a UEFA Europa League and a FIFA Club World Cup. He ended his playing career as his club and England’s leading scorer. He would’ve become ICON in any era.\n\nRobin van Persie\n\nIn Robin van Persie’s long career, he was known world over as a deadshot number 9 with highly refined technical ability - which saw him score some incredible goals. Van Persie started his career with Feyenoord, where he won the UEFA Cup at just 18 years old. North London would be his next destination, linking up with fellow ICON Thierry Henry to devastating effect. A Premier League classic goal against Charlton saw his legacy light up. But his last two years in North London saw van Persie become the player he dared to be. In the 2010-2011 season, he scored 18 goals. A career high. The next season, he hit an unprecedented 30 goals in 38 games. A move to the North of England followed - where van Persie would win the Premier League title in dramatic fashion. A stint at Fenerbahce for three seasons followed, before a return to Feyenoord. Van Persie also ended his career as the record scorer for the Netherlands. The perfect way for Van Persie to cement his undoubted legacy in the game.\n\nIker Casillas\n\nThe most successful goalkeeper in Real Madrid’s grand history, the story of ‘’San Iker’’ is a classic football fable. A lifelong fan, he joined Real’s youth team in 90-91 and rose through the ranks. Casillas was an integral part of some of Madrid’s greatest ever sides, regularly pulling off extraordinary saves that would rival the exploits of Madrid’s attackers. Eventually, Casillas would rise as Real Madrid’s captain, leading them to La Decima, the feat he described as ‘’bigger than the FIFA World Cup’’ - another trophy he picked up in his illustrious career along with two UEFA European Championships as Spain's number 1. In an amazing 25 years at Madrid, Casillas won three UEFA Champions Leagues, three FIFA Club World Cups, two UEFA European Super Cups, five LaLiga trophies, two Copa del Rey and four Spanish Super Cups. There will only be one Iker Casillas.\n\nCafu\n\nA key cog in some of Brazil and Europe’s greatest sides, Cafu’s attacking play down the right of the defence made him a legend of the game and inspired all his sides to triumph. Playing in Brazil, he won an incredible 11 domestic titles in just four years. After a stint in LaLiga, his time at AC Milan from the 2003-2004 season would bring him a Serie A title, and a famous UEFA Champions League title in 2006-07. There, he forged iconic partnerships with players like Maldini and Costacurta in a feared defensive backline. Cafu has the honour of being Brazil’s most-capped player with 142 appearances for the Seleção, in addition to being the only player to appear in the final of three FIFA World Cups™ - winning two of them in 1994 and 2002. A truly unique set of honours, for a truly unique ICON."
