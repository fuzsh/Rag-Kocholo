        "text": "The USA lost their opening match in the Chile U-17 World Cup, 2-0 to Nigeria, thanks to second-half goals from Chukwudi Agor and Victor Osimhen. The USA simply looked outclassed for the majority of the match and when Auston Trusty was ejected late for stomping on Osimhen, it completed a miserable day for the Yanks.\n\nUnable to break the pressure brought by the defending champions, the Americans looked quite a cut below the average, particularly in the back. Agor’s goal came off a dreadful defensive error â as it happens, from Trusty. Trusty shanked a clearance in the box into traffic, and John Nelson was unable to sweep it away on the second attempt. Agor simply ran onto it and blew the ball past William Pulisic in the net. Osimhen, Nigeria’s leading scorer in qualifying, exploited the centerbacks again to put the game to bed on the hour, simply heading the ball past Trusty and Hugo Arrelano to fire home cleanly.\n\nThe young Americans’ odds in this tournament were always long. Despite fielding a largely professional squad, the USA had missed out on the last edition of this biennial tournament, and only barely squeaked back into this one. Richie Williams’ squad survived a six-round penalty shootout in March against Jamaica just to get into Chile, and were rewarded with a tough draw into what is arguably the tournament’s group of death. The Americans also have not won a knockout game in the U-17 World Cup since 1999 and alongside the defending champions, the USA will have to face the hosts and a tricky Croatia side.\n\nOn the evidence of today’s game, the Americans will unfortunately continue what has been a bad run for the program overall. US Soccer is already reeling from shambolic losses to Mexico and Costa Rica by the full national team, and the Olympic side is not favored in their one game playoff against Colombia to get to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Many of the failings those teams showed â a lack of tactical and technical acumen, an inability to play at pace â were also on display here, indicating perhaps that the youth pipeline is quite dry.\n\nRead more – FoxSports\n\nA study by research outfit, CIES Football Observatory, has revealed that Nigeria is the fifth highest exporter of football talents in the world and the biggest in Africa.\n\nThe report, the eight in the CIES Football Observatory’s monthly report, which focuses on international migration in football, reveals that Nigeria’s figure of 596 players scattered in leagues across the world, is only lower to biggest exporter, Brazil (1,784), Argentina (929), France (758) and Serbia (607).\n\nThe analysis includes a record number of 6,135 clubs and 458 leagues of 183 countries worldwide.\n\nWhile Brazil is the most represented origin among foreigners both in Europe (1,137 players) and in Asia (437 players), Argentina is the main exporting country at Latin American level (511 players compared to only 124 Brazilians).\n\nThe CIES Football Observatory report entitled “Exporting countries in world football” provide an overview of migration of footballer’s around the world.\n\nIt said the dataset was not precisely defined but included “6,135 clubs and 458 leagues of 183 countries.”\n\n“18,660 foreign players of 194 origins,” representing 13 per cent of the total number of players included in the analysis, have been identified.\n\nOn regional basis, Brazil by far provides the largest foreign contingent in Asia, with Asian clubs tending to favour foreigners from outside the continent, including Africans, who are well represented in the AFC.\n\nWhile Brazil dominates exports to other parts of the world, Argentina exports the highest number of players to South America, with about 30 per cent of the foreign players in the region’s leagues.\n\nIn Europe, Brazil has the largest foreign contingent (8.5 per cent), followed by France and Serbia. But the most foreigners (56.1 per cent) come from other European nations.\n\nThe body devotes a section of its report on the U.S., which shows a “marked diversification of international recruitment.\n\n“The further development of football in the United States will, without doubt, be accompanied by an increase in transfers on a worldwide level. In the race for new talent, US teams will progressively become tougher rivals for European, Asian and South American clubs.”\n\n– TheGuardian\n\nDefending Champions of the FIFA U-17 World Cup, the Golden Eaglets of Nigeria landed in Chile yesterday with FIFA officials hailing Nigeria for their records in the youth World Cup.\n\nThe Emmanuel Amuneke-tutored record-seekers (Nigeria) have won the U-17 World Cup a record four times.\n\nNigeria’s intimidating record in the tournament include:\n\nWinners – Four time at the debut in 1985, 1993, 2007 and in the last edition in the UAE in 2013\n\nFirst Runner-Up – Three time in 1987, 2001 and 2009\n\nHighest points per game (three points for a win, one for a draw) in the history of the competition of 2.34 ahead of Ghana and Brazil with 2.12 and 2.04 respectively\n\nTotal goals scored – 126 in just 10 tournaments\n\nHighest wins of 41 games out of 56 total games played\n\nGolden Ball for Most Valuable Player of the Tournament won record 3 times by Philip Osondu in 1987, Sani Emmanuel in 2009 and Kelechi Iheanacho in 2013.\n\nGolden Shoe for Highest Goal Scorer in the Tournament won twice behind Mexico’s three time record in 1993 (Wilson Oruma) and 2007 (Macaulay Christanus)\n\nFifa Fair Play Award won a record four times in 1993, 2001, 2009 and 2013.\n\n16 years, 11 months and ten days will be the average age of the Nigeria squad when the tournament kicks off on Saturday 17 October, the youngest at Chile 2015. Emanuel Amuneke will be hoping his young charges continue the good progress made by Manu Garba’s champions from 2013, with 12 out of the 21 in their UAE 2013 squad featuring at the FIFA U-20 World Cup earlier this year in New Zealand.\n\n1708 goals have been scored in the history of the tournament, with Chidera Ezeh of Nigeria notching the 1700th strike in the UAE 2013 semi-final, 10,324 days after Brazilian Bismarck scored the very first goal of China PR 1985.\n\nThe landmark achievements and statistics were not all about Nigeria.\n\n11 players have gone on to win the World Cup after featuring at the U-17 edition, with Toni Kroos (who appeared at Korea Republic 2007) and Mario Gotze (Nigeria 2009) joining the list after their victory in Brazil last year. The nine other world champions are Frenchman Emmanuel Petit, Brazil’s Ronaldinho, Italy’s Gianluigi Buffon, Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti and Spain’s Iker Casillas, Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta and Xavi.\n\nSouth Africa, will be making their debut at a U-17 World Cup in Chile. Syria and Belgium return for their second appearance after both debuting at Korea Republic 2007, while USA and Brazil make a record-continuing 15th appearance at the global U-17 finals.\n\n2000 is the year in which Mali’s Mamady Diarra, who plays for Yeelen in his home country, was born, making him the first player to be named in a squad for a men’s World Cup tournament (U-17, U-20 or senior), who was born after the turn of the millennium.\n\n172 goals were scored in the previous tournament, UAE 2013, a record high for the U-17 World Cup. That record was achieved in 52 games, meaning an average of 3.31 goals per game, bettered only by Japan 1993 (3.34), Peru 2005 (3.47) as well as the record goals per game scored at Egypt 1997 and Finland 2003 (3.66).\n\n55 centimetres is the difference in height between the shortest and tallest player at Chile 2015. Guinea midfielder Karim Conte stands 140cm tall, with New Zealand defender Hunter Ashworth towering above him at 195cm. Only 12 players at last year’s senior World Cup stood taller than the Kiwi.\n\nVanguard\n\nLiverpool completed the signing of 18-year-old Nigerian centre-forward Taiwo Awoniyi this summer, and the former Imperial Academy star is primed for a bright future in the Premier League.\n\n“This is the biggest club in the world and I’m privileged to be here,” he said on his arrival.\n\n“I’ll try to develop myself very well so that when I come back to Liverpool I’ll be able to add value to the team.\n\n“When I’m in the red shirt, I will always give my very best to make the fans happy.”\n\nSpending the 2015/16 season on loan with 2 Bundesliga side FSV Frankfurt with a view to securing a UK work permit, Awoniyi is saying all of the right things after spurning reported interest from Porto and AS Monaco.\n\nBut who is Liverpool’s new striker, and what can he bring to Brendan Rogers’ side?\n\nIf his father had his wish, Awoniyi would not be a footballer.\n\n“It was miserable for me any time my dad caught me playing football or got to know that I went to play football,” the 18-year-old recalled of his upbringing in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital in western Nigeria.\n\n“In school, I was a very intelligent student and my dad wanted me to be a doctor. My teachers and my fellow students called me doctor but they also knew that I was very good when it came to playing football.\n\n“My father tried severally to stop me from football but my other siblings and twin sister especially, always covered up for me.”\n\nBut following his son’s big-money move to Merseyside, Solomon Awoniyi will be proud that the lofty centre-forward has achieve a degree of success.\n\nMaking his name in the Imperial Academy, founded in 2009 by former Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Seyi Olofinjana, Awoniyi was soon picked up by Nigerian international bosses, garnering the praise of former Arsenal striker, Nwankwo Kanu.\n\nDrawing comparisons to legendary Nigerian forward Rashidi Yekini, Awoniyi has remained humble.\n\n“I am not under any pressure. I will play my game and whatever will be will surely be,” he said in July.\n\n“It is an honour to be compared to a legend like Rashidi Yekini and for Nigerians to expect so much from me.\n\n“I will not shy away from any responsibility given me but only God can tell what I will be. All I know is that I will continue to work hard and leave the rest to God.”\n\nAn intelligent, well-grounded young player, Awoniyi still harbours hope of earning a university degree in the future, but his education may have to take a backseat while his footballing potential skyrockets.\n\nTaiwo Awoniyi came to limelight after winning the FIFA U-17 Football World Cup with his Nigerian team mates in the UAE two years ago.\n\nRead more on ThisIsAnfield\n\nNigeria and Liverpool forward Asisat Oshoala has been named as the BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year.\n\nThe 20-year-old forward is the first player to win the new award from the BBC World Service, voted for by football fans around the world.\n\nShe beat Spain’s Veronica Boquete, German Nadine Kessler, Scot Kim Little and Brazilian Marta to the honour.\n\n“I would like to say thank you to the BBC, to my fans around the world and to everyone who voted,” she said.\n\nThe award is the first of its kind hosted by a global broadcaster.\n\nShe beat Spain’s Veronica Boquete, German Nadine Kessler, Scot Kim Little and Brazilian Marta to the honour.\n\nOshoala, who was the youngest player to be shortlisted, was the leading scorer at the Under-20s World Cup in Canada last summer and was voted the tournament’s best player.\n\nHer performances led Nigeria to the final, where they were narrowly beaten by Germany, and she was also a major influence in the senior Nigeria team who won the African Women’s Championship in October.\n\nThat ensured their qualification for this summer’s World Cup in Canada, which begins on 6 June with full coverage on the BBC.\n\nOshoala said the honour was a big lift for Nigeria before the World Cup and would help inspire young players in her homeland.\n\n“It’s a really good thing for us as a team because we now know that we have something great and now we want to go at the trophy,” she said. “We can do it, we did it in 2014 we can also do it this year as well.\n\n“There is going to be a lot of motivation for women’s football in Nigeria now because of this award because there are a lot of fans out there.\n\n“Support for women’s football in Nigeria is now growing very high.\n\n“I know my Liverpool Ladies coach is going to be happy right now. Before I left the UK he called me and said to me ‘don’t worry I hope you win the award and we’re going to celebrate it when you come back’.”\n\nOshoala signed for Liverpool Ladies in January 2015, becoming the first African to feature in the Women’s Super League, with manager Matt Beard calling her “one of the world’s top young footballers”.\n\nMary Hockaday, controller of BBC World Service English, paid tribute to Oshoala.\n\n“At still only 20, she’s proved herself a formidable talent on the pitch,” she said. “I’m proud BBC World Service is supporting the women’s game and thrilled with the interest in the award.”\n\nBBC Sports"
