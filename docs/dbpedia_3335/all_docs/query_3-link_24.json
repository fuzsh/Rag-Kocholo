        "text": "UTEP Notes | Conference USA Notes | OU Notes\n\nMINERS TO KICK OFF SEASON NO. 100 AT NO. 7 OKLAHOMA\n\nThe UTEP football team will embark on a historic season, the 100th in school history. The Miners will tangle with no. 7 Oklahoma in Norman to commence the 2017 campaign. Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. MT at Oklahoma Memorial Stadium while the contest will be televised on FOX (El Paso local KFOX). UTEP and Oklahoma last played on Sept. 1 to open the 2012 season in the Sun Bowl. The Miners took an early 7-0 lead, but the Sooners responded with 24 answered points on their way to victory. The Miners are coming off a four-win 2016 campaign, while the Sooners won the 2016 Big 12 Championship and defeated Auburn, 35-19, in the Sugar Bowl to finish 11-2 last season. UTEP, under fifth-year head coach Sean Kugler, features All-American offensive lineman senior Will Hernandez, along with senior linebacker Alvin Jones, an All-Conference USA performer in 2016. Hernandez and Jones were also selected to the 2017 Preseason All-Conference USA team. Oklahoma returns senior signal caller Baker Mayfield and his 104 career total touchdowns (88 passing, 16 rush). OU had an interesting offseason as the school's all-time winningest coach Bob Stoops (190 career victories) – after 18 seasons – suddenly stepped down as head coach on June 7. New head coach, 33-year old Lincoln Riley, was announced the same day after he served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach the previous two seasons.\n\nSERIES HISTORY\n\nThis is the fourth meeting between the teams, all since 2000. Oklahoma leads the series 3-0 and has outscored the Miners 147-21. But the last meeting between the programs in 2012 at the Sun Bowl was highly competitive. UTEP led 7-0 early and was within 10-7 entering the fourth quarter before OU pulled away with a pair of late touchdowns. The Sooners hold a 2-0 edge in games played in Norman, winning 55-14 in 2000 and 68-0 in 2002. OU was ranked 19th heading into the 2000 matchup, second in 2002 and fourth in 2012.\n\nTHE LAST MEETING\n\nLandry Jones threw two touchdown passes and Damien Williams ran for a 65-yard score in the fourth quarter, as heavily favored Oklahoma outlasted UTEP, 24-7, in the Sun Bowl on Sept. 1, 2012. Nathan Jeffery put the Miners on the board first with a 24-yard return of a blocked punt for a touchdown six minutes into the game. Oklahoma tied the contest late in the first quarter on a 68-yard pass from Jones to Kenny Stills. The score remained 7-7 until 10:05 remaining in the third quarter, when OU's Mike Hunnicutt broke the deadlock with a 38-yard field goal. The Sooners put it away with a couple of touchdowns in the fourth quarter after the Miners failed to capitalize on limited scoring opportunities. UTEP was held to 255 yards and missed three field goals. Oklahoma, meanwhile, amassed 427 yards but 151 came in the final period. A key play came in the fourth quarter when Oklahoma stuffed UTEP on a fake punt to set up an 18-yard touchdown pass from Jones to Brannon Green and a 17-7 lead. Jones finished 21-of-36 passing for 222 yards. His UTEP counterpart, Nick Lamaison, was 6-of-23 for 39 yards. Jeffery rushed 21 times for 177 yards to pace the Miners.\n\nCONNECTIONS\n\nUTEP DB Devin Cockrell and Oklahoma DT Matt Romar are from Port Arthur, Texas. Both are redshirt seniors this season and played at Memorial High School together. UTEP players TE David Lucero and K Brady Viles are recent transfers from Arizona Western College and played the 2016 season with the Matadors. Oklahoma OL Erick Wren transferred from Arizona Western College (2013-14). UTEP LB Treyvon Hughes and Oklahoma K Nick Horiates both attended Hebron High School (Carrollton, Texas). UTEP Athletic Director Bob Stull and Oklahoma Athletic Director Joe Castiglione were both at Missouri during the 1993 season. Stull was head coach, while Castiglione was the Athletic Director.\n\nABOUT OKLAHOMA\n\nIn 2016, the Sooners started slow with losses to Houston (33-23) and Ohio State (45-24) in the first three games to begin 1-2. OU would rebound in a big way to win its next 10 contests, including a 38-20 victory over Oklahoma State to capture the Big 12 Championship and a Sugar Bowl triumph against Southeastern Conference power Auburn, 35-19 on Jan. 2, 2017. Baker Mayfield lit up the stat sheet with 40 passing touchdowns (ranked sixth in the nation) and 3,965 yards passing (ranked ninth nationally). Mayfield rushed for another six scores and 177 yards. Dede Westbrook (current Jacksonville Jaguars WR) hauled in 80 passes for 1,524 yards and 17 scores. Tight end junior Mark Andrews (31 rec., 388 yards, 2 TD) returns as the leading receiver from 2016. Joe Mixon (current Cincinnati Bengals RB) rushed for 1,274 yards and totaled 15 touchdowns, while Samaje Perine (current Washington Redskins RB) rushed for over 1,000 yards and 12 scores. Sophomore running backs Abdul Adams (53 att., 283 yards) and Rodney Anderson (missed 2016 due to injury) will be looked upon to fill the void in the backfield. First-year head coach Lincoln Riley (offensive coordinator in 2016) will also look to a trio of newcomers in freshmen running backs Kennedy Brooks and Trey Sermon, and junior transfer running back Marcelias Sutton. Defensively, senior DE/LB Ogbonnia Okoronkwo returns after leading the squad in sacks (9.0) and ranking third in tackles (71) in 2016. Senior LB Emmanuel Beal also returns as he ranked second on the team in tackles (81) last season.\n\nSEASON NO. 100 FOR UTEP FOOTBALL\n\nThe 2017 campaign will mark the 100th season of UTEP football and will commence when the Miners kick off at Oklahoma on Sept. 2. In honor of their centennial campaign, the Miners will wear a commemorative decal on their helmets. There will also be centennial tributes in the game program, on the video board and via social media over the course of the season. Though the centennial for The University of Texas at El Paso was in 2014, the football program suspended play for four seasons due to the World Wars. No games were played in 1918 (WWI) and from 1943-45 (WWII). The 1914 season marked the first for the Miners. The Miners played their first-ever game on Oct. 24, 1914 – a 7-6 victory against the YMCA.\n\nMORE C-USA RECOGNITION\n\nSeniors OL Will Hernandez and LB Alvin Jones were announced to the 2017 All-Conference USA Preseason team on July 17. For Hernandez and Jones, it's their fourth C-USA honor after both were named to the 2016 All-C-USA team, 2015 All-C-USA honorable mention team, and the 2014 All-C-USA freshman team.\n\nATHLON SPORTS TAKING NOTICE\n\nIn Athlon Sports' 2017 College Football Preview, the publication recognized six Miners. Notably, All-American senior OL Will Hernandez was named to the Athlon Sports Preseason All-American third team. Senior LB Alvin Jones earned Athlon Sports All-C-USA first team recognition, while senior DB Devin Cockrell and junior PR/WR Terry Juniel earned second team honors. Junior OL Derron Gatewood and senior P Alan Luna received recognition on the fourth team.\n\nDAVE CAMPBELL'S ALL-TEXAS FIRST TEAMERS\n\nDave Campbell's Texas Football magazine has been printed since 1960 and has been dubbed \"The Bible of Texas Football\". In the 2017 edition, a pair of Miners were recognized to the All-Texas College Football first team. OL Will Hernandez was honored as a first team offensive player, while LB Alvin Jones earned a spot on the first team defense.\n\nPHIL STEELE'S 2017 PRESEASON UPDATE\n\nIn the 23rd edition of Phil Steele's College Football Preview, seven Miners are recognized by the respected publication. Will Hernandez (guard), Greg Long (tackle) and Alvin Jones (linebacker) were honored as 2017 Preseason Conference USA first team selections. Terry Juniel (punt returner) garnered a third team selection, while Joshua Fields (running back), Jayson VanHook (linebacker) and Alan Luna (punter) received fourth team selections. Steele also rates UTEP's linebackers as the fifth-best in C-USA.\n\nSTEELE'S BREAKDOWN OF THE UTEP O-LINE\n\nPhil Steele rated UTEP's offensive line as no. 1 in Conference USA heading into the 2017 campaign. The Miners ranked tied for third in the league in sacks allowed (22.0) and ranked fourth in sacks allowed per game (1.83). Overall in the country, the Miners' offensive line unit is ranked no. 40 by Steele in his top 56. UTEP is one of five schools not from a Power Five conference to make the top 40. Will Hernandez ranked no. 6 as one of the top 61 guards on the Top Draft Eligible Players list. Hernandez was also named second team All-American on Phil Steele's 2017 Preseason All-American team.\n\nHARD WORK PAYS OFF\n\nAfter day one at Camp Ruidoso, head coach Sean Kugler announced on Aug. 8 that walk-ons RB TK Powell, WR Keynan Foster, LB Johnny Jones, FB David Jackson and FB Robert Pufhal each earned scholarships for their performances on the field and in the classroom.\n\nFILLING THE VOID\n\nHead Coach Sean Kugler will have some big shoes to fill after UTEP's all-time leading rusher Aaron Jones declared for the 2017 NFL Draft. The Miners have seven running backs listed on the roster. Sophomore Walter Dawn Jr. is listed as the no. 1 running back on the depth chart and will provide versatility on offense as he has shown the ability to catch the ball. Sophomore TK Powell will make his return to the field after missing all of last season. Powell gave the coaching staff a glimpse of his abilities after he rushed for 124 yards on 16 attempts (7.8 avg.) against LA Tech on Nov. 21, 2015. Sophomore Kevin Dove rushed for 101 yards on 19 carries (5.3) and a touchdown his freshman year and El Paso native freshman Joshua Fields torched the opposition for 5,151 yards in his three-year varsity high school career. Freshman Ronald Awatt rushed for 1,382 yards his senior season and saw extensive playing time in the Spring Game on April 14. Another El Paso native, sophomore Jonathan Millan, will provide depth while sophomore Quardraiz Wadley is out indefinitely with an injury.\n\nMETZ'S NUMBERS IN '16\n\nRyan Metz played in 11 games, starting seven during the 2016 season. Metz completed 64.7 percent of his passes, the second-best completion percentage during a single season in program history. Metz tossed 14 touchdowns, the most by a Miner since 2010. Metz also led the squad with 1,375 yards on 130-of-201 passing with only four interceptions. In fact, the El Paso native increased his touchdown passes from 2015 (six touchdowns) and decreased his interceptions from the season prior (seven). Metz's 141.14 passing efficiency rating was the program's fifth-best single-season performance, while it ranked sixth in Conference USA.\n\nBIG PERFORMANCES FROM RYAN\n\nRyan Metz produced solid numbers during a 5OT win at UTSA. Metz tied his career high with three touchdown strikes against the Roadrunners and threw for 211 yards on 15-of-23 passing. Metz was named one of eight Manning Award Stars of the Week following his performance in San Antonio. Metz assembled two more solid outings in front of his hometown fans, throwing three more touchdowns against Houston Baptist and registering two passing scores, including a career-long 72-yard toss against North Texas. Metz showed fancy feet as he tallied a career-long 42-yard dash against the Mean Green.\n\nPROTECTING THE FIELD GENERAL\n\nThe offensive line for the Miners brings experience to the depth chart this season. The unit lost two starters from a year ago but return senior Will Hernandez, senior Tanner Stallings and junior Derron Gatewood to the lineup. Leading the way for the squad will be Hernandez, who became the first UTEP offensive lineman to garner All-American honors. The senior has started every game (37) at the left guard position during his three years with the Miners. Senior Derek Elmendorff, after playing in all 12 games last year, has plenty of game experience with 19 career starts at the right guard position. Sophomore Greg Long will provide depth to the line after the El Paso native was named to the All-Conference USA freshman team. Long started a game at right guard before starting three at left tackle. Junior Jerrod Brooks will add experience at the right tackle position after starting the first half of the 2016 season, along with transfer senior Logan Tuley-Tillman, who has seen multiple reps with the first team offense. Last season the offensive line surrendered 22.0 sacks, which tied for third in C-USA (1.83 p/g). Over the last four years (2013-16) the Miners have allowed 74 sacks in 49 contests (1.5 p/g). In the previous four seasons (2009-12), UTEP quarterbacks went down 109 times in 49 games (2.2 p/g).\n\nBREAKING DOWN THE O-LINE\n\nThe starting five offensive linemen, according to the most recent depth chart, are LT Logan Tuley-Tillman (6'7\", 320 pounds), LG Will Hernandez (6'3\", 330 pounds), C Derron Gatewood (6'2\", 305 pounds), RG Derek Elmendorff (6'3\", 310 pounds) and RT Greg Long (6'4\", 270 pounds). The average weight of the starting five is 307 pounds, while the average height is just under 6-foot-4.\n\nALL-AMERICAN STATUS\n\nOL Will Hernandez has started every game in his three years with the Miners. Last season, Hernandez was the first Miner offensive lineman to receive AP All-American second team and FOX Sports' All-American honors. The senior was also the first UTEP offensive lineman since 2009 to earn All-Conference USA first team recognition. Hernandez's national recognition didn't stop there, as he garnered Pro Football Focus Pass Protector of the Year. The Miners capped the season with two showings of over 500 yards of total offense, including a season-best 384 yards rushing in a victory over North Texas.\n\nWILL'S PRESEASON ACCOLADES\n\nWill Hernandez was selected to the 2017 AP All-America second team on Aug. 22 as the senior has racked up multiple preseason honors. Hernandez was announced to the 2017 Outland Trophy Watch List and earned a spot on the 2017 Preseason Conference USA team. Multiple football publications, including Dave Campbell's Texas Football, Phil Steele's College Football Preview and Athlon Sports have Hernandez on their preseason teams.\n\nRISING DAWN\n\nIn his first season as a true freshman, Walter Dawn Jr. played in all 12 contests for the Miners. The 5-foot-6 speedster provided versatility as he played at the running back and wide receiver positions, and returned kickoffs in the process. Dawn Jr.'s breakout performance came in the Alamodome on Oct. 22, 2016 when he made a trio of trips into the end zone. The first score was Dawn Jr.'s first career touchdown – an eight-yard jet sweep to the left, while his second score was on a 74-yard reception (UTEP season-long). The third touchdown came in the third overtime on a 12-yard dash. Dawn Jr. finished with 59 yards on 15 carries and two scores, six receptions for 121 yards (20.2 avg.) and a touchdown, and 220 yards on 13 returns.\n\nCATCHING PASSES\n\nWith the 2016 leading pass catchers graduating, UTEP will look to senior Tyler Batson, juniors Kavika Johnson, Terry Juniel and Warren Redix, and sophomore Eddie Sinegal to produce in 2017. Sinegal caught 29 passes for 338 yards and registered the team's only 100-yard game after a 102-yard performance at LA Tech. Redix has recorded four career touchdown receptions, including a trio of end zone trips in 2016. Redix has hauled in 41 receptions for 286 yards in his two-year career at UTEP. Redix's big highlight was catching the game-winning touchdown falling out of bounds in UTEP's 5OT victory at UTSA. Juniel saw a lot of reps at the wide receiver position at Camp Ruidoso, while Johnson will provide a big target (6'1\", 205 pounds) for UTEP quarterbacks. Batson is also a big target (6'2\", 200 pounds) and has shown he can make big plays after snagging 21 passes for 395 yards (18.8 avg.) and three scores two years ago. Batson took one of those touchdowns 76 yards against Florida Atlantic on Oct. 24, 2015. A pair of 6-foot-1 transfer wide outs were added to the roster as Alan Busey (Chabot CC) and Nesly Ovincy (McNeese State) will run routes for the Miners. Keynon Foster, who transferred from Florida A&M prior to 2016, will provide more depth at the position.\n\nTHE BIGGER PASS CATCHERS\n\nSenior TE Sterling Napier and a pair of transfer tight ends, David Lucero and Josh Weeks, will try to fill the big shoes of Hayden Plinke after he set a single-season record for a UTEP tight end by snagging eight touchdown receptions, while adding a two-point conversion. Napier scored his first career touchdown at Florida Atlantic last season. Lucerco comes from Arizona Western College where he played in all 12 games. Prior to that, Lucero played at Boise State in 2015, seeing action in 11 contests and made a positive impression on the coaching staff at Camp Ruidoso. Weeks is a transfer from BYU and saw multiple reps in both scrimmages in Ruidoso. Junior Augie Touris and sophomore Jorge Rodriguez will also see action at the tight end position.\n\nSLASH\n\nJunior Kavika Johnson is listed as the no. 1 slot receiver on the depth chart, but has shown the ability to do a little bit of everything. Johnson played in all 12 games, while making his lone start under center at no. 11 Texas. Johnson's highlight came at UTSA when he completed a UTEP season-long 74-yard touchdown pass. Johnson threw for 131 yards on 12-of-21 passing, added 95 yards on 11 receptions and rushed for 42 yards. During his true freshman season in 2015, Johnson tossed three touchdowns and rushed for 209 yards with a score.\n\nBALL SECURITY\n\nUTEP tied for fourth in C-USA by turning the ball over only 16 times. The Miners tied for third with UTSA and WKU in interceptions lost (eight). The Miners lost eight fumbles and were one of 11 teams to lose single-digit fumbles.\n\nALVIN'S IMPACT\n\nAlvin Jones, who was named to the 2017 Preseason All-Conference USA team, returns after leading the team in tackles the last two seasons. In 2016, Jones played in 10 contests, making eight starts and missing two games due to injury. The El Paso native earned All-Conference USA second team honors after leading the team with 93 tackles (44 solo) and ranking tied for 11th in C-USA in total tackles. Jones also led the team with 72 tackles on rushing plays and ranked fourth in C-USA in tackles per game (9.3). The Burges High School graduate added 6.0 tackles for loss (28 yards), 2.5 sacks (22 yards) and a pass breakup. Jones opened his junior campaign with a 12-tackle performance against rival NM State and capped his stellar season with another 12-tackle outing, while registering a sack and 1.5 tackles for loss during a dominant victory against North Texas.\n\n16 FOR 16…TWICE\n\nAlvin Jones brought his best to the table when he established a career-best with 16 tackles (seven solo) against FIU on Oct. 8, 2016 in the Sun Bowl. The total tackles against the Panthers were the most by an individual UTEP player since the 2013 season (17 tackles). Five weeks later, Jones amassed 16 more tackles (11 solo) at Rice, while chipping in with a sack against the Owls.\n\nDOUBLE-DIGIT STOPS\n\nAlvin Jones has reached double digits in tackles nine times during his career. Jones's first double-digit performance came against UTSA on Oct. 3, 2015 with a 10-tackle outing. Jones racked up 11 tackles in four different contests in 2015 (at NM State; vs. Rice; at Old Dominion; vs. LA Tech). In 2016, Jones registered double-digit tackles in four contests (12 vs. NM State; 16 vs. FIU; 16 at Rice; 12 vs. North Texas).\n\nKEEPING UP WITH ALVIN'S CAREER\n\nSenior Alvin Jones has 241 career tackles (seventh-most at UTEP since the 2000 season), 10.5 career sacks (needs 1.5 to crack the program's all-time top 10 list) and 29.5 career tackles for loss (needs 1.0 to etch name on all-time top 10 list). Jones's 14.5 tackles for loss in 2015 rank tied for ninth on the single-season list, while his 5.0 tackles for loss at NM State on Sept. 19, 2015 was the most by a UTEP player since the 2000 season. Jones has led the Miners in tackles the past two seasons, tallying 93 stops in each campaign, while in 2014 Jones ranked second with 55 takedowns.\n\nLOVE FOR LOVILOTTE\n\nSenior Dante Lovilotte made an immediate impact after ranking second on the defense with 89 tackles in his first season with the Miners. Lovilotte, a transfer from Kilgore College, started all 12 contests at the linebacker position in 2016. Lovilotte also chipped in with 6.5 tackles for loss, half a sack, three breakups, four quarterback hurries and a forced fumble. Lovilottes's 7.42 tackles per game ranked 15th in Conference USA, while his total tackles ranked tied for 17th. Lovilotte produced three double-digit tackle games, including a career-best 11 tackles against Army. Lovilotte racked up 10 stops at Texas and another 10 against Old Dominion.\n\nSOLID FRESHMAN CAMPAIGN\n\nJayson VanHook provided depth at the linebacker position and was especially noticed when he tallied seven tackles and a sack at no. 11 Texas early in the season. VanHook recorded a season-high eight stops against FIU. VanHook earned a spot on the Conference USA All-Freshman team after tallying 36 tackles (17 solo) and 5.5 tackles for loss (18 yards).\n\nEXPERIENCED LB CORPS\n\nDefensive Coordinator Tom Mason will have a trio of senior starting linebackers heading into the season. MIKE LB Alvin Jones and BUCK LB Dante Lovilotte will make their return to the lineup but will be joined by transfer from Wake Forrest WILL LB Julian Jackson. Another senior WILL LB, Lawrence Montegut, is listed behind Jackson. Three sophomores are listed as the SAM LB – Dylan Parsee is no. 1 on the depth chart, while Jayson VanHook and transfer Kalaii Griffin are listed behind Parsee.\n\nDC'S IMPACT\n\nDevin Cockrell returned to the gridiron after missing the 2015 season with an injury. Cockrell's 2016 campaign produced 58 tackles to lead all UTEP defensive backs, while ranking fourth overall on the defense. Cockrell also tallied 3.0 tackles for loss, a breakup, quarterback hurry and a fumble recovery. The redshirt senior started all 12 games in 2016 and produced solid outings in his return. At UTSA, Cockrell registered a season-high 10 tackles. In his return game against rival NM State, Cockrell didn't seem to miss a beat as he recorded six tackles. At Rice, Cockrell came up with seven tackles – his second-most during the season.\n\nIN THE NIK OF TIME\n\nNik Needham produced a breakout sophomore campaign, registering a career-high 11 pass breakups. Needham's 11 pass breakups also tied for eighth during a single season in UTEP history. Needham opened the 2016 campaign with three pass breakups against NM State, which tied for third most during a single game in program history. Needham will enter his junior year with 16 career breakups, needing four to crack the program's top-10 list. Jahmal Fenner leads the all-time list with 25 breakups. Needham also tallied a career-best in tackles (54) and tackles for loss (2.0).\n\nROGERS THAT\n\nJustin Rogers saw action in 11 contests as a true freshman in 2016. Rogers earned Conference USA All-Freshman honors after posting 17 tackles and, most notably, eight passes defended (ranked second on team; tied for 22nd in league). Rogers came up with his first career interception against FIU on Oct. 8 in the Sun Bowl, while it was the first pick for the UTEP defense in 2016.\n\nDEFENDING THE PASS\n\nThe UTEP pass defense was active in 2016 as it ranked no. 2 in passing yards allowed (2,508) and no. 3 in yards allowed per game (209.0). The Miners kept LA Tech's potent pass offense in check at Ruston last season, allowing 191 yards through the air. The Bulldogs had entered the contest averaging 386.2 yards per game. LA Tech's 191 yards marked its fewest of the season as it averaged 363.4 in 2016. The lowest passing yards allowed by the defense came against Houston Baptist, which threw for 90 yards on 8-of-27 passing.\n\nDEEP IN THE DB POSITION\n\nThe 2017 roster will have 15 defensive backs listed. Redshirt senior Devin Cockrell returns the most experience, while senior Alex Jean Charles will play in his second season with the Miners after transferring from Phoenix College. Juniors Kalon Beverly, Adrian Hynson and Nik Needham round out the returning upperclassmen. Sophomore Michael Lewis, who produced solid numbers in 2015 but sat out in 2016, makes his return to the gridiron. The other two sophomores are Jerrell Brown and Justin Rogers. Redshirt freshman Broderick Harrell, freshman Deaumonjae Banks, freshman Joseph Pickney, redshirt junior Elijah Perales, and a trio of transfers in juniors Khalil Rashaad-Brown, Kahani Smith and senior Jesse Montgomery will make their UTEP debuts.\n\nNEW LOOK D-LINE\n\nThe 2017 starters on the defensive line include a pair of sophomores in DE Denzel Chukwukelu (6'4\", 290 pounds), NT Chris Richardson (6'3\", 300 pounds) and junior DE Luke Elsner (6'4\", 240 pounds). The trio of defensive linemen are a different look from last season's opening day depth chart (DE Mike Sota, NG Gino Bresolin & DE Brian Madunezim). A pair of freshmen in DE Dedrick Simpson and the physically imposing DE Keith Sullivan (6'7\", 260 pounds) will back up Chukwukelu, while freshman NG Trace Mascorro (6'1\", 270 pounds) is listed behind Richardson. The Buckingham brothers -- junior Christian (6'4\", 280 pounds) and sophomore Sani (6'4\", 290 pounds) -- will back up the other side of the defensive line.\n\nTOTAL DEFENSE IN 2016\n\nDuring defensive coordinator Tom Mason's first season, the UTEP stop troops ranked fifth in Conference USA in total defense (419.3 yards allowed per game).

Opponents also ran 822 plays, third-least in the league.\n\nYIELDING THE CHAIN GANG\n\nThe UTEP defense ranked no. 3 in Conference USA in first downs allowed (265). The Miners also ranked third in first downs allowed (108) via the pass and fourth in first downs allowed via the penalty.\n\nDAS BOOT\n\nEl Paso native Alan Luna returns for his third and final season after the senior punter earned honorable mention All-Conference USA honors. Luna booted 62 punts for 2,542 yards. Luna ranked fifth in C-USA in yards per punt (41.0) and seventh in yards. Luna averaged a career-high 51.0 yards on six punts (306 yards), including a career-long 69-yard boot against Southern Miss. At LA Tech, Luna tied his career best by placing three punts inside the 20-yard line, with a pair inside the 10-yard line. Luna was named a 2016 Ray Guy Award nominee after averaging 50.0 yards on four punts (200 yards) against Old Dominion.\n\nLUNA CAREER NOTES\n\nAlan Luna ranks ninth on the program's all-time list in career punt yards (5,427) and career punts (127).

Juniel was the team's leading punt returner, tallying 203 yards on 22 returns (9.2 avg.) with a pair of 43-yard returns. Juniel led C-USA in returns and return yards while he showed skills at the wide receiver position, catching nine passes for 83 yards with a long of 42 yards. Juniel opened his UTEP career with 104 yards on six punt returns, including a 43-yard return against NM State. His 104-yard outing ranks eighth-best during a single game in program history.\n\nCOMMITTED TO LESS PENALTIES\n\nSince Sean Kugler arrived at UTEP, the Miners have reduced yellow flags thrown onto the field.
