        "text": "STANDISH, Maine – Head Coach Rob Sanicola '99 has released the men's basketball recruiting Class of 2022.\n\nSanicola, who will be on the Monks' bench for his 16th season when the 2018-19 campaign begins in November, is bringing in a talented group of incoming freshmen. The class features six players – four guards and two forwards - who collectively earned a long list of accolades during their respective high school careers.\n\nSaint Joseph's graduated just two players – forwards Quinn Richardson-Newton and Aaron Hall – from a team that went 16-10 overall and an 11-5 mark in Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) play last winter. Richardson-Newton was a four-year starter who scored 1,007 points with 533 rebounds in 102 career games and Hall, who transferred to SJC prior to his junior season, was a two-year starter who tallied 452 points, 259 rebounds, and 60 blocked shots in 51 career contests.\n\nThe 2022 class figures to bolster a strong corps of returning players, as seven individuals are back after logging significant playing time during the 2017-18 campaign. Seniors Darian Barry (Rochester, N.H.) and Ian Mileikis (Auburn, Maine) headline the group of returners after combining to net over 31 points per game last winter. Berry, a First Team All-GNAC honoree, averaged 17.0 points and 5.7 rebounds per game while shooting 41.6% (79-190) as a junior while Mileikis, a Second Team All-GNAC recipient, scored 14.6 points with 5.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per contest last year.\n\n\"Our first recruiting priority is always to get the best student-athletes in Maine and we feel as though we accomplished that with Nick Curtis, Griffin Foley, David Keohan, Zac Manoogian and Brendan Hyde,\" adds Coach Sanicola. \"We also try and get outside the region as this year we headed down to the sunshine state, friend of the program, Nation Academy. We are excited to bring in a great young man from Florida, Nation Academy's Isaiah Paul.\"\n\n\"This class will add some much needed depth and versatility to our roster,\" Sanicola continued. \"Each guy can play multiple positions both offensively and defensively. They are an extremely tough and competitive group who all love basketball. Each guy competed in-state (high school) and regionally (club) at a high level. With the development of our returners, coupled with this years recruiting class, should be a great group to grow and compete with next season.\"\n\nMEN'S BASKETBALL CLASS OF 2022"
