        "text": "June 2, 2022\n\nLiam Miksic - Men’s Track & Field\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Freshman Liam Miksic has been named the Sgt. Pepperoni’s Anteater of the Week for his performance at the NCAA West Preliminary Track & Field Championships.\n\nMiksic, who finished 19 spots ahead of his ranking entering the meet, came in 17th in the West Region. He got out to a strong start, taking the lead in Flight 1 with a first-round toss of 205-03 (62.56m). Miksic stayed out front until late in the second round when he dropped to third, but he wasn’t done, launching a nearly seven-foot personal record on his third and final attempt to move back to the top of his flight at 215-11 (65.81m). Miksic’s PR ranks second in program history.\n\nThe Spring Lake, New Jersey, native, wrapped up an impressive collegiate debut season at last week’s NCAA regional. He placed among the top-10 in all nine of his regular-season meets with individual victories at the Vince O’Boyle Track & Field Classic and The Battle in the OC. He also earned all-conference honors with a third-place performance at the Big West Championships. Miksic threw for over 190 feet in every meet and surpassed 200 feet seven times.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nDarien Zhao - Men’s Golf\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Sophomore Darien Zhao has been named the Sgt. Pepperoni’s Anteater of the Week following his top-three finish at the Big West Men's Golf Championships.\n\nZhao carded a 54-hole score of 2-under 214 at the par-72, 7,056-yard La Quinta Country Club. He placed third overall, marking UC Irvine’s best individual showing since David Kim tied for third in 2018.\n\nZhao went under par in the first two rounds (70-71), before registering a 1-over 73 through the final 18 holes. Over the course of the tournament, the San Diego native led the field with 41 pars, while firing eight birdies.\n\nZhao, who finished below par in seven of his last 10 rounds, closed out the season with a team-best 73.13 scoring average.\n\nMay 5, 2022\n\nMike Mkrtchian - Men’s Tennis\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Mike Mkrtchian has been named the Sgt. Pepperoni’s Anteater of the Week after playing a key role in UC Irvine’s Big West Men’s Tennis Championship run.\n\nMkrtchian went 3-0 at No. 4 singles to help the ‘Eaters to their first conference tournament title since 2011. In the opening round, he delivered the match-clinching point in UCI’s 4-2 win over UC Davis. The Reseda, California, native dropped the first set against Andras Necz, and found himself down, 5-2, in the second but continued to battle, winning a deuce point to save match point at 5-2 and 5-3. He carried that momentum all the way to a 3-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 victory.\n\nThe following day, Mkrtchian took control from the start, defeating Cal Poly’s Fernando Fonseca, 6-4, 6-3, in the semifinals. His point gave the ‘Eaters a 3-0 lead in an eventual 4-0 triumph.\n\nOn championship Sunday, Mkrtchian had another resilient performance against UC Santa Barbara’s Kai Brady, who he had lost to earlier in the year. After splitting the first two sets, Mkrtchian trailed 6-5 in the final frame before finding another gear to emerge with the 6-4, 0-6, 7-6 (4) victory. That shifted the momentum back to the Anteaters as it brought them even at 2-2 before they closed out the 4-2 upset over the 55th-ranked Gauchos.\n\nUC Irvine will open the NCAA Tournament with a first-round match against 17th-ranked San Diego on Friday, May 6. First serve is set for 10 a.m. at USC’s Marks Stadium.\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n\nCollin Welp - Men’s Basketball\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Senior Collin Welp has been named the Sgt. Pepperoni’s Anteater of the Week after leading the UC Irvine men’s basketball team to a 68-51 Big West-opening win at UC Riverside last Saturday (Jan. 8).\n\nWelp kicked off conference play with 30 points (11-17 FG, 8-8 FT), eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and a block against the Highlanders.\n\nWith UCI trailing by one at the half, it was Welp who carried the squad over the final 20 minutes where he scored 25 of his season-high 30 points. The 6-foot-9 forward put on a clinic in the second half, going a perfect 10-for-10 from the field and 5-of-5 at the charity stripe.\n\nLast Saturday marked Welp’s second career 30-point performance, and first since 2019 when he put up 31 against Eastern Michigan.\n\nOn the season, Welp is averaging 15.4 points per game, which ranks fourth in the Big West.\n\nUC Irvine is back on the road this week, traveling to Honolulu for a 7 p.m. (HT)/9 p.m. (PT) conference showdown with Hawai‘i on Thursday, Jan. 13.\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nAndre Henry - Men’s Basketball\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Andre Henry has been named the Sgt. Pepperoni’s Anteater of the Week following his performance in the UC Irvine men’s basketball team’s 86-54 win over Bethesda.\n\nAfter missing the first five games, the 6-foot-4 guard made his presence felt in his season debut, scoring a team-high 15 points off the bench. Henry went 4-for-8 from the field and 6-for-8 at the free throw line. He finished just shy of a double-double, pulling down a career-best nine rebounds.\n\nHenry also had three assists, two steals and zero turnovers against the Flames.\n\nUCI returns to action this Saturday, Dec. 11, traveling to Fresno State for a 4 p.m. showdown.\n\nNovember 3, 2021\n\nDesiree Mendoza - Women’s Soccer\n\nIRVINE, Calif. – Desiree Mendoza has been named the Anteater of the Week for her clutch performance in the UC Irvine women’s soccer team’s regular-season finale.\n\nEntering the game three points behind Cal Poly in the standings, the ‘Eaters needed a win against the Mustangs to clinch a share of the Big West title, and they delivered. Mendoza was the offensive catalyst in the 2-0 victory, putting UCI on the board early as she scored the eventual game-winner on a one-timer to the far post in the seventh minute. Mendoza then assisted on UC Irvine’s second goal, delivering a perfect corner kick into the box where Destinee Manzo rose up for the header (54’).\n\nMendoza was also named the Big West Freshman of the Week for her effort.\n\nUC Irvine (13-5-0, 8-2-0 BWC) now heads into the Big West Tournament as the No. 1 seed, and will host fourth-seeded UC Santa Barbara on Thursday, Nov. 4, at Anteater Stadium. Kick-off is slated for 7:30 p.m.\n\nOctober 13, 2021\n\nAxel Adler - Men's Soccer\n\nIRVINE, Calif. - Junior Axel Adler has been named the Anteater of the Week after helping the UC Irvine men’s soccer team secure four crucial points and move into a tie for second in the Big West standings.\n\nOn Saturday, Oct. 9, UCI handed Cal Poly its first conference loss of the season despite being down a man for 40 minutes. After a red card was issued to the ‘Eaters at the 49:49 mark, they dug deep, building from a goal kick for the eventual game-winner just 10 minutes later.\n\nThe sequence started with Christian Bond-Flasza finding Francesco Montanile on the right wing. Montanile then sent a cross into the box where Adler beat a defender and the goalkeeper to the ball, punching it to the back of the net with his left foot. It was the 6-foot-1 forward’s first career goal. Adler finished the evening with three shots, two of which were on frame.\n\nAdler also had a shot on goal in 35 minutes played of a 1-1 double overtime tie at first-place UC Santa Barbara (Oct. 6).\n\nUC Irvine (4-7-2, 2-1-1 Big West) is back in action this week, hosting UC Davis tonight (Oct. 13) and making its way to CSU Bakersfield on Saturday, Oct. 16.\n\nOctober 6, 2021\n\nJoy Umeh - Women’s Volleyball\n\nIRVINE, Calif. - Sophomore Joy Umeh has been named the Anteater of the Week after leading UC Irvine women’s volleyball to a pair of Big West wins.\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 1, Umeh had a career-high 20 kills, while hitting at a nearly .300 clip, in a 3-1 (26-24, 18-25, 25-23, 25-22) victory over UC Davis. Six of her kills came in an 8-2 run to start the fourth set, giving the 'Eaters a lead the Aggies were unable to overcome. Umeh also had two block assists and two digs.\n\nThe following day, Umeh put away a match-high 14 kills in a 25-21, 25-22, 18-25, 25-18 win over UC Riverside. She added a pair of block assists against the Highlanders.\n\nFor the week, the 5-foot-8 pin hitter averaged 4.25 kills per set (.274), upping her season average to a team-best 3.54 kills per set.\n\nThe Anteaters (11-4, 4-1 Big West) will be looking to extend their win streak to four matches this weekend as they host league-leading Hawai’i (7-5, 4-0 Big West) in a 5 p.m. showdown on Saturday, Oct. 9."
