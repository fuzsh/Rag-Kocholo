        "text": "I think the recent fallout of young English players and other young British players is most clearly seen, not in the Premiership teams, but in the lower leagues and more specifically non-league. You might hear supporters of lower-league clubs talking about \"gems\" they've found in non-league and these kids must have come from somewhere.\n\nEverybody knows how many kids don't get professional contracts at the top clubs and these guys often get picked up by small clubs and get the opportunity to fully develop and play first team football.\n\nA great example of this is Charlie Austin's success at Swindon. He left Reading in 2004, at the age of 15, and after playing for several local or non-league moved from Poole Town to Swindon, after scoring an astonishing 48 goals in 42 appearances. He has continued in this rich vein goals scoring form at Swindon netting 19 times in 33 appearances.\n\nClearly something is wrong with the youth system if such a talented individual misses out and gets released, the reasons for this (According to Wikipedia, a far from reliable source) was \"for being too small.\" which is ludicrous, Messi has a growth deficiency and was still kept on at Barca and Jermain Defoe is far from being the tallest man in the world.\n\nThis may be a valid (if not slightly strange reason) to release a player once they've reached maturity at say 18 or 19 but 15? I don't know about you but I've grown a fair amount since I was 15.\n\nGoing back to Charlie Austin he's now 6ft 2in (Again according to Wikipedia) not so small any more eh?\n\nI think that having these foreign players brought in does have a detrimental on English players, but only up to a certain point.the quality of football in Leagues 1 and 2 has grown drastically as they can now pick up young lads with bags of potential for nothing after being released from the bigger clubs to make way for players being brought in.\n\nThe impression I've got from reading interviews from players who have experienced this effect is that they are much more driven and are just desperate to play first team football, especially after dropping into non-league. As a Bournemouth fan I can point out Anton Robinson as a prime example of this, he played every game last season in a highly competitive midfield for a team that won promotion, it was his first ever taste of league football.\n\nLarger clubs need to be looking into the non-league system now, because there are some really quality players in there. I'm not saying they will necessarily develop into International players but it does show how not all hope is lost for the young Englishmen out there.\n\nMorning all, thanks for reading/commenting. Some replies:\n\noozatden (1) - Good point, and one Chris Waddle makes frequently on 5 Live. If I could think of one word to define our performances in SA it would be joyless. There was no spark, no invention and very few smiles. They looked too tight and far too worried about failing, as opposed to being excited about achieving something - beating a man, completing a clever pass, making a run, whatever. And you're right about Rooney. When it comes to international football, apart from a purple patch in qualifying last autumn, he has probably regressed since his introduction in Portugual. He terrified defences at Euro '04 and we fell apart after he got injured. What's happened? Why can't he reproduce his MU form more consistently for England?\n\nslightchange (4) - This, I think, is the most fundamental issue for English football to tackle but the question is how. The interesting thing about German football in recent seasons is that the number of foreign players in the Bundesliga has fallen. Only a few years ago they had a very similar native/foreign split to the PL, about 40/60. Without checking the numbers again, I believe last season it was more like 55/45. How has this happened? I asked Franz Beckenbauer this last week and he said it was to do with German clubs lacking the finances of the big English and Spanish clubs to sign top foreign talent and a marked improvement in the quality of young German talent. This last factor is exactly what Sir Trevor Brooking has been talking about for some time. We shouldn't be talking about banning/capping foreign players in the PL, we should be talking about improving the overall quality of young English talent.\n\nbearded_shrimper, Villain Hi-Ho, JMck (5,6,7) - I've grouped you together because I think you're talking about the same thing, this issue of imported ready-made talent blocking the progress of young English players. To be honest, it's a very contentious subject and one that cuts straight to the heart of the club v country debate.\n\nOn the one hand, I understand why clubs feel they have to buy in the best available talent, regardless of passport, to survive/prosper in the PL and beyond. It's a cut-throat business and they are effectively competing with rival firms here and abroad. There is also the argument that British football has been enriched by great foreign talent and that our players can only learn from the likes of Bergkamp, Cantona, Henry, Ronaldo, Zola etc\n\nBut on the other hand, there is little doubt that this makes life more difficult for young English players trying to make the transition from youth to senior football. This, in turn, makes an England manager's life more difficult as his pool of available talent is reduced, often dramatically so in certain key positions.\n\nWe could debate this one all day but I also find it very strange that a club with an academy as highly-regarded as Man City's would pay so much for a holding midfielder surplus to requirements at Barcelona.\n\njonathan-AFCB (8) - Good point re: Charlie Austin. He is very much an example of how talent can be recycled/given another chance. I think we are fast approaching a point when many Football League clubs will give up youth development entirely and simply focus their efforts on picking up the best of the rest from top-flight academies. And let's be clear about this, the wastage rates at the academies is high and decent players are often discarded by clubs for very club-specific reasons (no vacancies in a particular position, wrong style of play, personal beef with manager/coach etc). Making sure these guys aren't lost to the game is paramount. Glenn Hoddle's \"second chance\" academy in Spain is an example of this.\n\nlittlejklc & gunner_zp etc (9 & 10) - You're right, more should have been made of the U17 success - it was our first real international title since 1993, which says it all really. But I am encouraged by recent age-group results on the European stage. OK, we have only won one competition but we've been making finals pretty regularly and we weren't even doing that before. In fact, we were struggling to qualify for these championships. That we are now I think is down to the academies starting to bear fruit. An 18-year-old now has probably been in the system for a decade.\n\nExlimey (13) - Upon reflection, I think you're right. A 4-0 defeat is horrible however you dress it up. We shouldn't accept that kind of thing, particularly at the hands of our so-called rivals. But the point I was trying to make is that having seen Germany turn Argentina over too (and you could argue we got closer to them than they did) the hand-wringing etc might have been overdone. Don't get me wrong, I'm still fuming about our performances in SA. But it's the whole campaign that irritates me. And most of the previous campaigns in my lifetime too!\n\nrjaggar (14) - I always enjoy your contributions. Sadly, as Steve Tudor (21) has worked out, Future Game isn't available online so that's why I haven't provided a link to it. In fact, I'm still waiting for my copy to arrive in the post. Hope to have it this week, though, and will blog on it in my usual reporting style then.\n\nRight, must crack on with some other stuff now. Cheers, Matt\n\nThere are a lot of mindless comments in this discussion thread about English player quotas.\n\nIf the coaching standard in England for children is rubbish in international terms, then the high chance is that most children won't be good enough to compete with the best international stars in club football in this country no matter how much they practice. That won't change so we are basically saying: English boys, don't bother trying because we set the system up to discriminate against you. Young boys, especially from less well off backgrounds, can't just suddenly up sticks to Spain, Germany or France to get good coaching unless they are a Lionel Messi. They must deal with what we do here. So you lot are saying: football is now a theatre for the well-to-do and we don't care about English kids. Sorry and all that: that's what you're saying.\n\nIt's a bit of a waste of time discussing England teams if that's the standpoint of English people.\n\nI'd also like to add Mr Slater that there was a wonderful article by Jurgen Klinsmann yesterday about how we, the English, need to find our own team identity. It was beautifully respectful, mindful of boundaries and empowering to a fault.\n\nA shame that your site totally destroyed the usefulness of that article by running another, today, by George Weah. A man who didn't play in this country but who played for Capello in Italy. There is no place for Weah commenting on the football in a country he didn't play in, World Player of the Year or not and I can only assume he is speaking for Capello who feels too undermined to speak for himself.\n\nPlease inform your editor what poor judgement that article showed.\n\nIt had all the hallmarks of a father telling his 14 year old son that he must find his own identity before finding a woman for life, then telling him 6 months later he'd found someone who he was going to marry as a matter of course.\n\nI'm sure that fits absolutely with the English identity, doesn't it?\n\n@32. At 12:00pm on 06 Jul 2010, Stevat wrote:\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with you, introducing a rule to enforce teams to play British players is absolutely pointless. It will only serve to reduce the quality of the league and so the quality that the young players have to reach to get into the league. We should be looking at coaching at youth levels, and contrary to the article maybe we should be encouraging the young players to enjoy themselves rather than taking it so seriously. The coaches at that level seem obsessed with winning, rather than developing talent. I remember seeing a documentary about the Ajax academy years ago, talking about how each player is played in every outfield position until they reach 16, and how they don't even play 11-a-side until they are 15.\n\nThese are the sort of things we should be considering. I remember playing 11-a-side aged 9, what is the point in that? I also remember how the mentality of the coaches and the parents often took the fun out of it. If you tried to beat a man at right back, or play the ball out to a midfielder rather than lump it up the field you were pilloried for it.\n\nThe much more sensible approach is to look at youth football and make massive wholesale changes. No large numbered games until they reach a decent age, smaller pitches to encourage players to work on control and technique. Maybe then in a few years we will have players capable of making Premier League teams based on merit.\n\n-------------\n\nYou are missing the point. Obviously youth coaching needs to improve, we have been given figures recently outlining the lack of top professional coaches is comparison to Europe. However there are good young players at English clubs now who cannot get a game because of mediocre foreign players. Im not suggesting 7 of a starting 11 should be English as naturally the quality would drop but please tell me how any top talent is going to rise to the surface when clubs like Man City are spending as they are, can you see them bringing anyone through their academy this season? Unless the \"instant success\" culture in this country is curbed then we will never produce more top quality players because no matter how outstanding a player may be in comparison to his young age of say 18 there will be a experienced, seasoned foreign player there already in place.\n\nWe are not talking about the top foreign players but the very average ones, and there are plenty of those in the top two divisions. And there will not be a generation like the Spanish have currently got waiting around the corner every 10 years, thats not realistic. Not all positions require Messi-esque technical ability or eye of the needle passing but all round-sound football skills and calm heads under pressure.\n\nIt amazes me how we can ever think we will produce great players when they are rarely afforded oppurtunities to play. If, like for example the Arsenal academy, most teams trained in the manner that the first team does as regards tactics and technique then surely they will be more than capable of a few appearances to prove their worth by the age of 19 or 20. Most of these kids are at there clubs from 10 years old, are we saying that our leading premier league clubs cant coach kids?\n\nI noticed someone mentioned the much banded about \"Quota\". The reason it hasn't come into force is because no-one has really thought it through properly enough.\n\nFor example, in EU law you can't say to a club you can only sign 3 players of non GB nationality, as that contravenes employment laws, but... if the premier league really wanted to, they could state that no more than 3 non GB players are included in a matchday squad. That way Man City, Arsenal and whoever else could sign as many foreigners as they liked, but could only play 3 at any given time.\n\nThe other thing I think should be implemented is a squad size cap. In Spain its 25 players over the age of 18. I think there may also be a stipulation in there that at least 4 are players that have been brought through the clubs youth ranks. Either way, it means that the mighty Barcelona and Real Madrid can only pick from a squad of 25 players (over 18) in their domestic league, and so while this means they may have the best 25 players, there is no benefit to doing a Man City or Tottenham and going out trying to sign everyone in sight because at least that way no-one else can. A player wouldnt go to a club where he was obviously going to be out of that 25 player limit and so not get a game for the entire first half of the season (you can change which players are in your 25 at christmas).\n\nHaving a squad cap would mean less decent players sitting on over paying clubs benches. This would hopefully mean that some of the emerging talent 18 + would not get swallowed up and largely forgotten like they do now.\n\nMost of the posts here are simply silly. Foreigners are not ruining the England team. If you disagree, please explain all of the horrible England teams that existed long before the increase in foreigners in the Prem. England is not on the level of the true top football nations and has never been. Take the fairly lucky one off 1966 home win out and England is a clear second tier nation and usually performs at that level.\n\nQuota systems will do nothing to help England but will reduce the quality of the Prem and could actually make the situation worse for young English players. The \"home grown\" system increases the value of clubs bringing in foreign talent as early as possible so I'd expect the number of English players to actually decrease at top academies under this system. That makes it less likely that potential world class English lads will get the early coaching needed to reach their potential. There is no evidence that top quality English players are getting forced out of the game by foreigners. I'd suggest that the talent is simply not there and that England's performance in the last few World Cups is exactly equal to the level of talent available so expectations are a problem.\n\nReducing foreigners will not help the poor coaching found in England, will not fix the many clubs using outdated tactics, and will not remove the agricultural tackles/fouls that make English leagues unfriendly to possession-focused players and clubs. The often lauded physical, constant running game seen in England when combined with pressure on match officials to let players get away with fouls that would result in cards and sending off abroad make it very difficult for all but the best clubs to play the style of football that works at the World Cup. That is why you see so many mid to bottom table Prem clubs that lack even basic skill on the ball and the situation gets worse as you drop down leagues.\n\nEvening all, a few more short replies:\n\nJohnnyGray26 (30) - Agreed. Travel is supposed to broaden the mind. I think it's just become too easy for our best players to stay at home and collect big cheques (from their clubs and sponsors). But I also wonder if foreign clubs look at our players and say 'they're just not worth it, not at those prices anyway'.\n\nneil_h (31) - It would be nice, wouldn't it? Problem is that the clubs operate across borders, so any solution to this must involve Uefa and Fifa. Blatter's 6+5 idea isn't perfect but it's probably the best we've got.\n\nStevat (32) - You're right about the importance of playing for fun but the youngsters I'm talking about are more in the 5-11 group...they shouldn't be worrying about results. There's nothing wrong with competition per se but we need to introduce it once the basics have been properly mastered.\n\ntoms7 (33) - I think a balance has to be struck between learning and the needs of the first team AND actually winning things (because winning is ultimately the aim of the game and is more fun than losing). I'm quite happy for the people in their late teens to be focused in victory, I was, it's the younger teens playing percentage football that worry me.\n\nrjaggar (34) - I have no idea what you are talking about. Sorry.\n\nErfstadt Exile (35) - Your comment about the German U21s doing to our U21s what their seniors did to our seniors is very interesting. I think that is what Brooking & the FA are talking about when they say they want all English academies working from the same plan. Wouldn't it be great if our youngsters were trained to play in a similar coherent pattern?\n\ndougd22 (36) - Good point. But what is they say about a country deserving the media it gets?!? I'm not excusing the worst excesses of our football press but is it a case of reporting something that's not there or just holding a mirror up to the nation? I don't know the answer, by the way!\n\nJamTay (37) - I suspect you may be right. That said, I do worry about the move towards a game without tackling or any kind of physical challenge. I still think that's an essential component of the game. But I agree that it can be overdone and we place too much emphasis on it in our country.\n\njuninhowept (38) - The numbers are very worrying and sadly speak for themselves.\n\nMatthew Jackson (40) - That is a very good point and it's one I've heard plenty of foreign players make themselves ie a stint in English football has sharpened their skills/toughened them up. Wouldn't it be nice if our players could go abroad to improve their tactical knowledge, ball retention, technique etc??\n\nAnd on that note I will leave it. Thanks again, M\n\n@49. At 5:11pm on 06 Jul 2010, Stevat wrote:\n\nFirstly the Home Grown ruling won't pacify the nationalistic majority that seem to be on here, as it simply implies they have to have trained at the club under the age of 18. Most Premier League Academy squads have a multitude of nationalities in their squads, so it won't make a bit of difference. You could in theory have 8 home grown French players playing for your club next season to satisfy the quota.\n\nIn any case, I'm not missing the point. If you take away a free market, and enforce a quota of English players all you are doing is reducing the level of quality that young players need to achieve to be picked on merit. Rash decisions like this won't help the national team at all, even in the 70s and 80s when there were very few foreign players, we still had a rubbish national team. To blame the decline of our team on foreign players is both ignorant and pointless. If the young English players were better than their foreign counterparts, then they would be getting played would they not? They won't be better until we coach them in the right way. No youth football should be competitive, should be about fun and playing in every position possible and learning as much as possible. You shouldn't be allowed to play 11-a-side until you're 15 or 16 - get them as many touches on the ball as possible.\n\n-----\n\nThe money at stake within the Premier league prevents anyone from taking risks and actually giving young players a chance. I am not talking about the \"home-grown\" ruling, that is a con in itself in it's current form.\n\nPlayers who come under the clubs stewardship at say 11, have more than ample time to be developed into complete players by 18, particularly if they followed to a degree the outline you mentioned of better training. As I previously mentioned, everyone is fully aware of the need to improve training methods etc but the foreign players joining the academies are receiving the same training as English players, yet at Arsenal there are more promising English under 18's than all other nationalities put together, so I for one am am not buying into the idea that young foreign players coming into the academies at 13, 14 are any better than our English juniors. There is no evidence of this at all, in fact most of the younger foreign players established within the first teams of top clubs have been signed for actual transfer fees at 17, 18 when they are nearing the end of their developement, it's not that they are coming through the academies and are naturally better than English lads.\n\nTraining methods do need improving, Im not disagreeing with you on that Stevat but the number of average foreign players is the problem. I also think we should encourage young players of 17 or 18 to go on loan abroad to play in 2nd tier, dutch, french or spanish football for a time, to broaden their horizons as far as football is concerned.\n\n@50 I really wonder how Messrs Ferguson and Wenger are going to get round this one lol.\n\n-----------\n\nWell I can't speak for Fergie, but I think you'll find that Arsenal's squad actually already fulfills this criteria with regards to young players...say what you like about his policy of signing youngsters, but Arsenal are pretty much ready for this kind of ruling if it came into force already.\n\nA good example is Wilshire, a very promising player who has been with the club since he was 8, if memory serves! In fact, I'm quite suprised at how few mentions Arsenal have got. For example, giving young players a chance: Well obviously Wenger is known for his policy of playing young players in the Carling Cup, but outside of this...\n\n(The numbers mean Starts/Sub appearances)\n\nJack Wilshire (ENG) spent half the season on loan at Bolton playing first team EPL football. (11/2)\n\nJay Simpson (ENG) spent the whole season on loan at QPR (37/5)\n\nHenri Lansbury (ENG) spent the whole season on loan at Watford (35/4)\n\nJay Emmanuel-Thomas (ENG) 3 month loan with Blackpool (7/5), then finished the season with Doncaster (12/2)\n\nKyle Bartley (ENG) spent the second half of the season on loan at Sheffield Utd (10/4)..and spent half of that period out injured as well as making a first team debut in the Champions League against Olympiacos!\n\nThese are just ones I can easily find the figures for, but in addition Gavin Hoyte spent the season at Brighton and Mark Randall was at MK Dons, both as regular starters, i'm lead to believe. Luke Freeman, one of the top scorers in the Premier Academy League has already agreed a season long loan at Yeovil Town for the 10/11 season!\n\nMy main point is, people should look at the model Wenger has implimented at Arsenal and wonder why more clubs haven't done the same. Yes, in the first team we only have one established English player in the form of Walcott, with Gibbs and Wilshire knocking on the door, (although I would point out that under the rule of a player between 16-21 having to have been signed by a team for 3 years minimum alot of the foreign youngsters like Nordtveit and Barazite and even first teamers such as Denilson, Traore and Vela would qualify just fine) but because of his emphasis on youth development and blooding youngsters early we have a large group of talented ENGLISH players coming through, with first team experience as well as the habit of winning in the Reserve and Academy leagues. I'm not saying they're all going to make it at Arsenal, or become future England players, but look at Bentley...he did alright after coming through the Arsenal system, didn't he? Muamba seems to be doing pretty well, also!\n\nMaybe if more clubs were doing this the future of English football would be even brighter? Obvious as an Arsenal fan my main experience is with my club, but I'd be honestly suprised if many, if any, other big clubs could boast the same level of English talent with any experience coming through the ranks?\n\nI'd love to hear if there are some examples! Matt? Any thoughts?\n\nWhilst reading this thread I've yet to hear anyone make a comment over the \"45 minute\" rule that is in place on clubs with academies. It was the introduction of this rule, in some part led by London clubs bemoaning United's \"Class of 92\" containing the likes of Beckham, that has had an effect on where clubs look to bring in young talent.\n\nIf we rid ourselves of this damaging rule, the clubs with the better academies will once more be able to collect the talent from any where in the country without having to consider all the costs that it does now. I'm sure that over a period of time the amount of non UK youngsters coming into the game would decrease with this rule gone. I also feel that the EU should look at ways of conforming the laws of it members state so that clubs across Europe can sign players to first pro contracts at the same age. This might lesson the instances where by English clubs have signed players as they are able to before the current parent clubs can. This would make it a level playing field for all.\n\nWith that said, I'm also of the thinking that our youngsters need to play small sided games, and learn to techniques over power and strength. This may sound harsh, but if we start now, we may have a generation by 2022 to challenge for the World Cup. I've already written off 14 and 18 due to the way we coach youngsters over here.\n\nAs for the comments over the media, I agree they whip the nation into a frenzy every time and then turn on who ever. I still recall the effigy of Beckham outside Upton Park in 98. The media played it's part in that and continue to do so, as it pays them to do so. The majority of football fans would have known that this team wasn't good enough, in the 60 years since England's first entry into the World Cup, I'd say 58 (pre Munich Air Crash), 62 (same as before about the crash), 66 and 2002 where the best occasions where by we had a chance to win the World Cup. Out of them 4 occasions injury or disaster ruined our chances. We have to be realistic and not get whipped up by the media when ever England play. The current arguements etc, over the coach and now foreign players is crazy, the coach is one of the best in the world, and the foreign players can't be blamed for not qualifying in 74, 78 or 94 can they?\n\n#66 - I really don't think it's lack of technical ability that prevents English players from moving abroad. If that were the case, you wouldn't see Real Madrid being linked with Gerrard and Cole every year. It really is obvious that the main reason is that most Englishmen cannot adapt to a life abroad, in a different culture. Footballers are usually less well educated than people in other professions, and therefore the chances of them learning a whole new language is practically nil.\n\nI mean, blimey, most Brits abroad resort to the age-old technique of saying \"DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?!\" really loudly to locals, so it's no surprise to see English players not wanting to take a chance when they can still have fish and chips, beer and the Sun newspaper while playing in Manchester, Birmingham or London. As a people the British are generally rather afraid of trying anything new and can often be wary of experiencing a new culture, as evidenced by the thousands of people who travel to places like Mallorca or the Costa del Sol every year - and do *exactly the same things they do at home*, with the only difference being that it's a bit hotter.\n\nThe most successful English exports have been those players who have been able to assimilate; Gary Lineker and Steve McManaman both picked up spanish pretty quickly and did really well in Spain. (incidentally, McManaman has been a revelation on US tv coverage of the World Cup - really well informed and interesting.)\n\nI really think it would help the English national side if more of its players were prepared to take the chance and move abroad, but I really don't think it'll happen unless they get the proverbial offer that's too good to refuse.\n\nThe trouble is that the casual football supporter wants success for the country; the devoted football supporter wants success for their team and it is the devoted football supporter who pays the bills.\n\nI would class myself as a casual football supporter. I have followed my team, which is in the Premier League, for over 50 years. I am pleased when they do well, I am pleased when even one of the team gets a chance to play for England, but I have only ever been to a handful of matches. I would love it if England could make a better showing in International Tournaments.\n\nA devoted fan goes every week to support their team and quite naturally wants to see them win. Some devoted supporters want to see good exciting football as well, but the win is the most important thing. They would like England to do well, but that is only every couple of years and they watch their team every week. They expect to see the finished product playing every week. They don't have the patience to see a young player develop, when they know that a more experienced (and more skillful) import can be bought at the price of a couple of weeks gate receipts. They pay to see winners not training matches.\n\nI cannot criticise the devoted supporter as it is their money that pays for my passing entertainment. However the result is that few English players get the chance to develop.\n\nA other concern is that even if a young player does get a chance in the first team one of two things happens. Either their talent is immediately recognised and the burden of expectation starts to crush them, or they are not allowed to develop as they have it beaten into them that their job is to get the ball to ........ and their potential is not fully explored.\n\nMy final question is to find that tipping point when those players with undeniable talent stop being motivated by the love the game and are driven by an overbloated celebrity status and the money it brings. They are the ones who are ruining the game. They are the ones who want to be praised for the wonderful tricks and skill they have, but will go over at the slightest touch or use their skill to trick another player into fouling them."
