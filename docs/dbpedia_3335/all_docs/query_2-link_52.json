        "text": "Dynasty Alumni in Professional Baseball\n\nEmmanuel Burriss (Class of 2003)\n\nEmmanuel or \"Manny\" was the first Washingtonian to ever be chosen in the first round of the MLB amateur draft. Manny started working with Coach Williams at the age of eleven, where he showed a strong work-ethic and a love for the game. While attending Woodrow Wilson, he gave opponents teams fits by putting pressure on the defense with his speed and showing incredible range in the field. Manny starred as a shortstop for the 2002 and 2003 Dynasty teams. He went on to be drafted 33rd overall by the San Francisco Giants in 2006, after his junior year at Kent State University. Manny spends his winter's at the Washington Baseball Academy training with Coach Williams and other members of the Dynasty coaching staff. Manny currently serves as an infielder for his hometown team, the Washington Nationals.\n\nYordy Cabrera (Class of 2010)\n\nYordy played for Dynasty in the summer of 2008, following his sophomore year at Lakeland High School in Florida. His Dominican roots brought him to D.C. where many of his relatives reside. Yordy was a quiet kid and let his play do the talking. He showed great range at shortstop and third base along with an ability to hit for power. Soon after his stay in DC, Yordy put himself on the radar of many scouts. He became a high school Aflac All-American and an Under Armour All-American. In 2010, he turned down a scholarship offer from the University of Miami and elected to sign a professional contract with the Oakland Athletics after being picked in the second round of the MLB Draft.\n\nSam Mulroy (Class of 2008)\n\nSam played for DC Dynasty from 2004-2008. He was an excellent athlete, and excelled in pressure situations. His work-ethic and calm demeanor allowed him to perform at a high level. Sam was one of our most versatile players during his time with Dynasty. He played outfield, infield, and pitched, but primarily served as a catcher. Sam's decision to focus on catching during his sophomore year in high school ended up paying big dividends for him. He was a highly sought after recruit, and ended up at Princeton University after graduating from the Maret School. Sam was a star performer at Princeton and his hard work paid off when the Los Angeles Angels selected him in the 32nd round of the 2012 draft.\n\nJared Williams (Class of 2002)\n\nPound for pound Jared was one of the best Dynasty players of all-time. He had a small frame and was often overlooked as a result. Jared hit for power and played every game like it was his last. After playing for Dynasty, Jared went on to Wagner College where he instantly became an impact player. After graduation, he spent a year attending major league tryouts and working on his craft. As a result of his hard work, Jared got signed and played independent minor league ball in the South Coast League. He is now one of the most feared hitters in the DC Wood Bat Semi-Pro League.\n\nDerrick McPhearson (Class of 2004)\n\nDerrick was an incredible athlete and an outstanding outfielder for DC Dynasty. He was a great competitor and one of the most physically gifted athletes to come through our program. Derrick never ceased to amaze his teammates at Dematha and Dynasty; it was incredible to see his talent on display. Speed and arm strength were his biggest assets. Derrick attended the University of Illinois on a football scholarship, and went on to sign a free agent contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2008.\n\nIvor Hodgson (Class of 2004)\n\nIvor spent three summers patrolling the outfield for Dynasty's 19U team. He was a smooth fielding centerfielder who covered a lot of ground and lead our teams in outfield assists all three season. Coach Williams always liked Ivor's potential on the mound and he served as a spot starter and closer for the squad. In 2004, he was named first team All-Met by the Washington Post Ivor was drafted as a pitcher by the Kansas City Royals in 2007.\n\nJoel Gonzalez (Class of 2004)\n\nJoel was an outstanding catcher for the 19U Dynasty team. To this day he is one of the top five catchers ever to come through our program. Joel refused to take a day off and often insisted on catching double and triple headers. Joel had a great eye at the plate and reached base in 33 consecutive games, which remains a team record at the 19u level. He went on to play professionally in Puerto Rico in 2005.\n\nGerard Hall Jr. (Class of 2005)\n\nGerard started began playing for Dynasty when he was in the 8th grade. He played on one of our original Dynasty teams. Gerard was a small kid with an oversized work-ethic. He went on to star at Gonzaga College HS, where he was an All-Met Shortstop. In his final season with Dynasty, he helped lead the team to the ECTB National Championship game. In the final day of the tournament, Gerard hit homeruns from both the right and left side of the plate. After receiving numerous college offers, he elected to play ball at Old Dominion University. After his senior year, Gerard signed with the Kansas City Royals in 2009 and played professionally through the 2014 season.\n\nRolando Lozado (Class 2005)\n\nRolando was one of the first players to come out of our academy in Venezuela. He spent the summer of 2005 in a Dynasty uniform and collected a record 11 victories as a right handed pitcher. Rolando showed pinpoint control and a knee buckling curveball to match. He was signed as a free agent by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006.\n\nMike Sheridan (Class of 2005)\n\nMike was a smooth fielding first baseman, and one of the best hitters Dynasty has ever seen. He was a natural athlete, and also played varsity basketball at Gonzaga. Mike understood how to play the game and worked tirelessly to improve his overall speed and agility. Mike was a part of one of the best teams Dynasty has ever put on the field in 2005, serving as the everyday first baseman and third hitter. He went on to star at William and Mary, where he became an All-American. As a sophomore at William and Mary, Michael was statistically the hardest player to strikeout in the nation. After his Junior year, the Tampa Bay Rays made Michael the first pick of the 5th round in the 2008 draft.\n\nJose Sanchez (Class of 2007)\n\nJose was a tremendous pitcher and outfielder for Dynasty. He spent three summers on the 19U team, where he played every outfield position and never missed his start in the rotation. Jose made a huge commitment to play with us and traveled to and from Stafford County for games and practices once his family moved from DC. Jose was only 5 foot 7 inches 145 lbs, but threw a fastball that was consistently clocked in the upper 80’s and even reached 90 miles per hour as a senior. He went on to become a Junior College All-American and helped lead his team to a JUCO National Championship appearance. Jose signed a free agent contract with Kansas City in 2009.\n\nMatt McPhearson (Class of 2013)\n\nMatt completes the first Dynasty brother duo to play professionally (Derrick McPhearson). Matt would frequent the Dynasty games to watch his brother Derrick fly around the outfield and on the bases. Matt certainly made a name for himself while leading his #1 ranked high school team and national power Riverdale Baptist (MD) in 2013. Matt also played for Coach Antoine Williams for several years on the DC RBI team. In 2010, Matt helped lead the DC team to the World Series Championship game vs. the Dominican Republic. Don’t let his quiet demeanor fool you, as he is a fierce competitor with a knack for making plays. He was dubbed the fastest prospect eligible for the MLB amateur draft in 2013 by Baseball America. After his senior year of high school, Matt was drafted in the 5th round of the 2013 draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nDynasty Alumni in College Baseball\n\nClass of 2002\n\nJared Williams – Wagner University\n\nJack Lyons – Lehigh University\n\nDan Smith – Cornell University\n\nClass of 2003\n\nEmmanuel Burris – Kent State College – Washington Nationals\n\nRobert Rosenbaum – Colby College\n\nAnthony Taylor – Waynesburg College\n\nClass of 2004\n\nAladino Gonzalez – PG Community College\n\nBruce Goodwin – Bowie State\n\nChuck Evans – Morehouse College\n\nDaniel Diaz – PG Community College\n\nDerrick McPhearson – Illinois University – Milwaukee Brewers\n\nJoel Gonzalez – PG Community College\n\nJon Boher – Emory University\n\nClass of 2005\n\nByron Peyster – Washington and Lee University\n\nEmerson Mogollon – MC Germantown\n\nGerardo Hernandez – West Virginia Tech\n\nIvor Hodgson – Mount St. Mary’s – Kansas City Royals\n\nJabari Graham – Alcorn State\n\nMarcus Stoiber – Occidental College\n\nMike Sheridan – William and Mary – Tampa Bay Rays\n\nRafael Turner – Radford University\n\nClass of 2006\n\nAlex Brown – Colby College\n\nDoug Bower – University of Miami Ohio\n\nGerad Hall Jr. – Old Dominion University – Kansas City Royals\n\nRobert Rosenbaum – Hamilton College\n\nWill Krasne – Stanford University\n\nWillie Leibner – Rhodes College\n\nClass of 2007\n\nAlex Kirby – Bucknell University\n\nChris Mauro – Sewanee University\n\nJonathan Ledesma – Montgomery College Rockville\n\nJose Sanchez – MC Germantown – Kansas City Royals\n\nRobbie Shiver – Ohio Wesleyan\n\nLee Tackett -- Washington and Lee University\n\nClass of 2008\n\nAndrew Whitener – Princeton University\n\nFrancis Brooke – Northwestern University\n\nKieran Flannery – Indian River Community College\n\nMatt Grieb – Catholic University of America\n\nSam Mulroy – Princeton University – Los Angeles Angels\n\nWillis Bradwell – Morehouse College\n\nClass of 2009\n\nAndrew Mauro – Dickinson College\n\nBobby Appleby – Muhlenburg College\n\nBrett Ossola – Case Western University\n\nCarlos Perez – Randolph Macon\n\nDan Sabatano – Liberty University\n\nWalter Albee – Brown University\n\nClass of 2010\n\nCameron Phillips – Lehigh University\n\nCameron Windham – Amherst College\n\nDuncan Taylor – Bowdoin College\n\nGerard Taylor – University of Maryland\n\nHarrison Farmer – Furman University\n\nIvan Perez – Limestone College\n\nJustin Coulter – Haverford College\n\nRaphael Sanchez – Concord University\n\nCarlos Perez – Randolph Macon\n\nClass of 2011\n\nAndrew Hutson – Oberlin College\n\nHenry Sisson – University of North Carolina\n\nBen Whitener – Oberlin College\n\nSam Stevens – Cornell University\n\nAndrew Yin – Wesleyan University\n\nClass of 2012\n\nRobinson Mateo – Southern A&M University\n\nEddie Peguero – Mt.
