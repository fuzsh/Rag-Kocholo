The Nigerian Rugby national team are called the “Black Stallions”.\n\nThe “Green Eagles” eventually became known as the “Super Eagles” after another successful outing by the team.\n\nThe advent of Age grade competitions and Women’s football meant that national teams were created and they also had to be named like the existing teams. In Nigeria the Under 20 men’s team was nicknamed the “Flying Eagles” (all eagles fly though). Then came the Eaglets in 1985 who were renamed the “Golden Eaglets” after their inaugural campaign in China saw them winning gold at the FIFA U16 World Championship.\n\nThe Nigerian Women Senior national team are known as the Falcons, while their Under 20 counterparts are known as the Falconets, the Under 17 Women’s team are called the Flamingos.\n\nBut the main focus of this writer is the Nigerian national under 23 men’s team popularly addressed as the “Dreamteam” the current crop of the young nigerian footballers are now being called “Dreamtean 6” and this is nothing but laughable.\n\nThe Nigerian Under 23 team was first called the “Dreamteam” during the build up to the Atlanta 96 Olympic games were an all-star squad was assembled to represent Nigeria at the football event of the Olympic games.\n\nThe Original Dream Team\n\nThe moniker “Dreamteam” was “borrowed” from the AllStar basketball team that represented the USA at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and this was truly a “Dreamteam” both on and off the court.\n\nA team that had Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers, Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics, Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls, just to name a few, No one could ever argue with the fact that this was truly a “Dreamteam” by all standards.\n\nThe Nigerian “Dreamteam”\n\nThis team had a blend of Nigeria’s Super Eagles and some extremely talented footballers all assembled together from different teams at home and abroad.\n\nJoseph Dosu (Julius Berger fc) and Emmanuel Babayaro of Plateau United coincidental were the only “homebased” players in the team, all the other outfield players were based in various parts of the world, Sunday Oliseh played for Fc Köln in Germany, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha played for Eintracht Frankfurt also Germany the team Everton of England Striker Daniel Amokachi, Kanu Nwankwo was with Ajax Amsterdam. Emmanuel Amuneke was then with Sporting CP in Portugal. The “Dreamteam” also had Victor Ikpeba of AS Monaco in France.\n\nThe Presence of the Above listed players and others not listed earned the team the Moniker “Dreamteam” we have decided to had the full team list below for emphasis:\n\n1 GK Emmanuel Babayaro Plateau United\n\n2 DF Celestine Babayaro Anderlecht\n\n3 DF Taribo West Auxerre\n\n4 FW Nwankwo Kanu Ajax\n\n5 DF Uche Okechukwu Fenerbahçe\n\n6 MF Emmanuel Amuneke Sporting CP\n\n7 MF Tijani Babangida Roda\n\n8 MF Wilson Oruma Lens\n\n9 MF Teslim Fatusi Ferencváros\n\n10 MF Jay-Jay Okocha Eintracht Frankfurt\n\n11 FW Victor Ikpeba AS Monaco\n\n12 DF Abiodun Obafemi Toulouse\n\n13 FW Garba Lawal Espérance\n\n14 FW Daniel Amokachi Everton\n\n15 MF Sunday Oliseh Köln\n\n16 DF Kingsley Obiekwu Go Ahead Eagles\n\n17 DF Mobi Oparaku Anderlecht\n\n18 GK Dosu Joseph Julius Berger\n\nThis team indeed lived up to all the hype surrounding it and went on to win the elusive football gold medal for Nigeria at the Atlanta Olympic games in 1996, claiming the scalps of major football powerhouses Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThis writer believes that without a doubt this was the true “Dreamteam” and the team’s achievements justified this, But truly this is where the Football federation should have created a proper identity for this team, but eighteen years down the line Football commentators, analyst, and even the fans are stuck with the dilemma of renaming the Nigeria U23 team “Dreamteam 6” (which means that there’s been six different “Dreamteams”).\n\nIts time for the NFF to name the Nigerian Under 23 properly, enough of this Dreamteam business, Most of the players in the current Under23 team and even the teams that came after the Atlanta 96 team have been made up of virtually unknown players so what makes it a “Dreamteam” ?\n\nAre we going to continue adding numbers to the so called “Dreamteam” every time a new team is put together?\n\nDreamTeam? No, Its Time For The NFF To Rename This Team\n\nIn kick –starting its pledge to ensure that the Senior National Team, Super Eagles is engaged for all the FIFA –free days available next year, the Nigeria Football Federation has secured two international friendly matches for the team prior to the 30th Africa Cup of Nations finals.\n\nNFF General Secretary, Barrister Musa Amadu, confirmed on Wednesday that the Eagles will confront two teams they battered on the way to a third African title in South Africa early last year, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in January 2015.\n\nThe Super Eagles will confront 1992 African champions Cote d’Ivoire, whom they edged 2-1 in the quarter finals in South Africa, on 9th January, and take on fellow Eagles of Mali, who were overhauled 4-1 by the Nigerians in the semi finals in South Africa, four days later.\n\n“We are working round the clock to make sure that the Super Eagles will have opponents for all the FIFA windows available in year 2015, and we are happy that the two games with the Ivorians and the Malians are sealed.\n\n“The Elephants and the Les Aiglons are on their way to the 30th Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, so they are sure to give our team good games.”\n\nAlready, Assistant Coach Daniel Amokachi has drawn a list of 24 players who will do battle for shirts for the two matches.\n\nGombe United goalkeeper Chigozie Agbim leads the invitees, with Azubuike Egwuekwe, Kwambe Solomon, Umar Zango, Rabiu Ali, Emem Eduok, Kingsley Sokari, Mfon Udoh, Gbolahan Salami and Gambo Muhammad also called.\n\nPlayers are expected to report at the Bolton White Apartments, Abuja on Sunday, 28th December with their international passports and four passport photographs.\n\nGoalkeepers: Chigozie Agbim (Gombe United); Daniel Akpeyi (Warri Wolves); Theophilus Afelokhai (Kano Pillars)\n\nDefenders: Solomon Kwambe (Sunshine Stars); Idris Aloma (El-Kanemi FC); Chimma Akas (Sharks FC); Nelson Ogbonna (Heartland FC); Azubuike Egwuekwe (Warri Wolves); Erhun Obanor (Bendel Insurance); Bright Esieme (Enyimba FC); Umar Zango (Kano Pillars)\n\nMidfielders: Ammel Angel Wilfred (Kogi United); Joseph Nathaniel (Sharks FC); Charles Henlong (Giwa FC); Stanley Dimgba (Warri Wolves); Rabiu Ali (Kano Pillars); Chinedu Udeaga (Enugu Rangers); Emem Eduok (Dolphins FC); Kingsley Sokari (Enyimba FC)\n\nForwards: Mfon Udoh (Enyimba FC); Gbolahan Salami (Warri Wolves); Osaguona Christian (Enugu Rangers); Gambo Muhammad (Kano Pillars); Christian Obiozor (Enugu Rangers)\n\nNFF Lauds Seina Marine, ARIK On Support For Referees’ Training\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation has applauded Seina Marine Limited and ARIK airline for the support both companies are offering to 20 Nigerian elite referees going to the United Kingdom for the arbiters’ next capacity enhancing programme.\n\nNFF President, Amaju Melvin Pinnick said: “Seina Marine Limited is bankrolling the cost of the three –week exercise as well as the stay of the 20 referees in London.\n\n“On their part, ARIK Airline has offered to fly the referees at only half the fare and we are very appreciative of this gesture. I can tell you that this is the beginning of what is sure to be useful relationships between Seina Marine and NFF, as well as ARIK Airline and NFF.\n\n“There were 10 referees involved in the first batch that returned to the country on Sunday. There will be 20 referees in the second match that will leave the country on January 25, 2015, for another two –week capacity building exercise.”\n\nIt is confirmed that 17 highly –qualified persons, including coaches and ex-internationals will fly to the United Kingdom mid –January for a three –week match reading technique and backroom analysis exercise, aimed at helping all the National Teams in international engagements.\n\n…Congratulates MFM On World Cup Triumph\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation has congratulated the MFM Football Club on its victory at the inaugural Church World Cup which ended in Goa, India on Sunday.\n\nIn a letter of congratulations addressed to the General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr. Daniel Olukoya on Wednesday, and signed by General Secretary, Barrister Musa Amadu, the NFF lauded the feat and affirmed that it was worthy of recognition and good mention.\n\n“The new Executive Committee of Nigeria Football Federation is determined to celebrate excellence in all spheres of the Nigeria game, and the laudable achievement of your football team, which has brought honour to our dear country, deserves recognition and good mention.\n\n“We also want to express deep appreciation of the NFF and the Nigeria football family for the keen interest of the General Overseer and the entire leadership of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries in football, and also commend your huge investment in the football sector, which has seen MFM Football Club become one of the strongest teams in the Nigeria National League – the second tier of our country’s domestic football.\n\n“The NFF believes that the excellent feat of MFM FC in India will encourage the leadership of your church to invest even more in football for the benefit of the youth of our nation.”\n\nSuper Eagles midfield gem, Ogenyi Onazi, has set his sights on victory in Congo over the host in next weekend’s Nations Cup qualifier but has stated that there are conditions to be met if victory must come Nigeria’s way next Saturday.\n\nOnazi, who was expected in Nigeria on Sunday night, said Nigerians desirous of the Nations Cup ticket must all join hands and pray and that the football community must be united to achieve success. “Once I arrive Nigeria, I will go to my father in the Lord to pray with me, because I want the Nations Cup ticket and I know we can win in Congo. We must also cooperate and forget past differences to achieve our aim”, he said on phone from his base in Italy.\n\nPreparations for the make or break Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Congo Brazzaville in Point Noir is expected to be kick-started on Monday following the arrival of invited Nigerian league stars to Abuja on Saturday, after a highly impressive 1-0 win over Ghana in the maiden Restoration Cup at the ultra-modern Akwa Ibom International Stadium last Friday.\n\nThe players who came into camp with Head Coach Stephen Keshi, his assistants and other members of staff of the national team are goalkeeper Chigozie Agbim, Warri Wolves skipper, Azubuike Egwuekwe, Solomon Kwambe, scorer of the epoch making goal in Uyo, Emem Eduok, Nasara United’s Tony Edjomari, Christian Osaghuna Ighodalo, Gbolahahan Salami and new comer Kingsley Sokari.\n\nThe players are nested at their usual abode in Bolton White Apartment, Zone 7, Abuja and Keshi said all invited players should be in camp by latest Monday. “We have no time for this game and the players know, so all of them must be here early enough for the trip to Congo”, he declared.\n\nBobby Breaks Into Eagles Afcon Squad\n\nAs predicted by many, exciting Enyimba International midfielder, Kingsley Sokari alias Bobby has broken into the Super Eagles squad for the two remaining qualifiers against Congo and South Africa next week and this is official.\n\nBefore now, Assistant Coach, Dan ‘the Bull’ Amokachi had said the player is as exciting as former Super Eagles skipper, Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha, a view also held by other assistant coaches, Hyandonou Valere and Ike Shorunmu. But he also put a caveat. “We must allow our boss, Stephen Keshi to make the final decision”.\n\nLast Friday at the Uyo International Stadium inauguration game against the Black Metoers of Ghana, Keshi had a first-hand opportunity to assess the player and his final verdict was that the player is excellent and good enough for the main team. He subsequently ordered him on the plane to Abuja for the remaining two games and Bobby is presently at the Bolton White Apartment with the rest of the stars from the Nigerian league. Invited foreign based stars are expected to start trooping in from Sunday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Administrator, Dayo Enebi Achor, has said he believes in the ability of the present squad to nick one of the tickets in the group A of the Afcon qualifiers this weekend in Point Noir. “We have a strong technical crew, formidable players and solid backroom staff, coupled with a new NFF that is visionary and focused, I think with hardwork we can get the ticket” he declared.\n\nThe New board of the NFF met a few hours ago and to far reaching decisions aimed at reposition the game of football and also reconciling aggrieved members of the “football family” amongst other things.\n\nBelow is the communiqué that was drafted after the meeting:\n\nCOMMUNIQUE OF MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF NIGERIA FOOTBALL FEDERATION HELD IN ABUJA ON WEDNESDAY, 15TH OCTOBER, 2014\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Nigeria Football Federation held a meeting at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja on Wednesday, 15th October, 2014 to discuss important issues in Nigerian football and resolved as follows:\n\n1) The Committee, unanimously, praised the excellent contributions of the technical crew of the Senior National Team, Super Eagles, led by Mr. Stephen Keshi, to the glorious accomplishments of the team in the past three years, and hailed Keshi, Daniel Amokachi and Ike Shorounmu as true national heroes.
