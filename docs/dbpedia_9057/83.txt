NoiseyÂ recently announced the long-awaited reunion of The Movielife, one of Long Island’s most beloved pop-punk/hardcore bands. While the group briefly got back together in 2011, the reconciliation was short lived.

As far as most emo fans are concerned, the band hasn’t shown any real signs of life since they first called it quits in 2003; though, some of the members went on to create music in other bands. For example, singer Vinnie Caruana formed I Am The Avalanche and guitarist Brandon Reilly started Nightmare Of You.

Apparently timing is everything because it wasn’t until Caruana and Reilly started hanging out recently that the idea of reforming The Movielife moved from being a hypothetical conversation to real possibility. The current lineup includes Caruana, Reilly, bassist Phil Navetta, guitarist Dan Navetta and drummer Evan Baken.

The first reunion show planned will be February 7, 2015, at Irving Plaza in New York City. More dates are expected to follow.

As for what else fans can expect from the emo legends, here some highlights from the interview:

– When The Movielife briefly reunited in 2011, Caruana never thought they’d do it again.

– While the band has yet to rehearse, let alone make a setlist, there’s a good chance they’ll play something from every album.

– Right now, the band has no plans to write new musicâbut never say never.

– Reilly is really looking forward to playing “Takin’ It Out And Choppin’ It Up.”

Speaking of favorite Movielife songs, here are a few of the band’s classics that should get you in the mood for a good ol’ circle pit.

Tickets for the band’s Irving Plaza show go on sale this Friday, December 19 at 12 PM EST.
