        "text": "Space, 2017\n\nAs we are informed in the opening sequence via voiceover by Rebecca Ferguson’s character, a crew aboard the International Space Station has been tasked with retrieving Pilgrim, a capsule returning from Mars with soil samples. It’s obvious from the beginning that the crew is expecting something momentous from its lowly cargo, hence the scene’s tension and dramatic music not normally associated with space botany (unless you’re Matt Damon). The filmmakers could have taken a cue from any number of better movies — the more mundane the setup, the more exciting the reveal once things get nasty.\n\nRyan Reynolds, in full wisecrack mode like a child who keeps doing something annoying because he desperately craves attention, has been given the task of single-handedly capturing the out-of-control space capsule with the space station’s robot arm — but for some reason, he has to do it while spacewalking, thus dramatically complicating the procedure and endangering his life. It’s possible he is simply overcompensating for the last time he made it into space as Green Lantern, but even catching the capsule with a giant green catcher’s mitt would have made more sense than this. At any rate, Reynolds makes the catch, physics be damned, and there is much rejoicing.\n\nThe crew’s exobiologist, played by Ariyon Bakare, wastes no time digging into the Martian soil. Given the relatively eggheaded setup — peering at microscopic organisms, vs. giant alien eggs and facehuggers — the filmmakers waste no time confirming that yes of course, there is life on Mars, even if it’s a single-celled organism. Bakare’s first instinct is not to study it in any detail, but to try to wake it up, despite the significant concern the crew expresses minutes earlier for making sure no extraterrestrial life forms make it back to Earth. But tiny sleeping aliens aren’t very exciting. With a twitch, the tiny space organism comes to life, prompting a celebration that feels neither advisable nor particularly earned.\n\nAn early scene in which a panel of Earth children ask the crew questions about their newfound alien buddy — a setup transparently designed to introduce the various characters — is somehow even more excruciating to watch than the real thing would be. The wooden script tries to inject some banter among the crewmates, but even the impressive cast can’t make it feel natural. Only Hiroyuki Sanada manages to make any of it believable — with an explanation of how astronauts poop in space.\n\nAnd then a huge crowd in Times Square — which has apparently turned out to celebrate the discovery of a space amoeba, because there’s nothing Americans love more than science — watches as a little girl announces that a nationwide school contest has voted to name the little Martian “Calvin.” This will make more sense later on as it wreaks havoc on the station, not unlike his comic strip namesake (sadly, the movie doesn’t make even an oblique reference).\n\n“Character” “development”\n\nRyan Reynolds’ standard contract most likely requires that he be the class clown of any movie he’s in, and he gets his chance to deploy his million dollars’ worth of snark in the film’s first act. The filmmakers apparently decided that, with Reynolds being the cutup on deck, Jake Gyllenhaal needed to be as lifeless as possible, a duty he performs admirably all the way to the end of the movie. Not only does Reynolds seem like the only one having any fun, but he has the good sense to check out of the movie early, the better to get to making more Deadpool movies.\n\nBy contrast, Gyllenhaal — who is about to break the record for longest time spent in space — has become something of a misanthrope in his time in the station, solemnly lamenting to Ferguson all the bad things people on Earth do to each other (and he hasn’t even seen Donald Trump’s America, having been in space so long). Much like Sandra Bullock in Gravity, he takes comfort in the isolation of space, though Life doesn’t even attempt to convey the sort of tranquility that made that movie so hauntingly beautiful. (It also could badly use a Clooney.) Gyllenhaal mostly just comes across as grumpy and bored, which does little to make you care about him once the tentacles start flying.\n\nBakare is also an odd candidate for a space mission, as he reveals early in the movie that he is wheelchair-bound on Earth, showing us his atrophied legs as he climbs into his sleeping capsule. I’m all for greater representation for the disabled in popular culture, but even in zero gravity, being unable to use his legs at all seems like a significant risk in such a small crew, and astronauts are among the most physically scrutinized of all professions. But OK, let’s say Bakare’s character is Earth’s foremost exobiologist and simply must be aboard the ship — given the various other less-than-realistic technical touches aboard Life’s ISS, including a Prometheus-like holographic ship schematic and complex 3D position trackers, why not give Bakare some sort of robotic exo-legs? The special effects guys already had to give him CGI legs, why not make it actually make sense, and get the chance to show off more cool tech?\n\nHiroyuki Sanada’s character is a bit more of an enigma, but we do learn a little about his home life. In a scene of attempted character development, Sanada watches his wife on Earth giving birth on a tablet screen and interacts with her in real time, suggesting a robust digital connection with Earth — which the crew not only seldom uses to communicate with mission control, but which proves surprisingly fragile only a little later in the film.\n\nBack to the lab\n\nOnly five minutes after we’re first introduced, our friend Calvin has already grown “trillions” of cells, and the crew remarks that every cell functions as muscle, eye and brain. Setting aside how exactly they determined all that at this point in the movie, having spent so little time studying the organism, this doesn’t cause the scientists the slightest bit of alarm? Curious though they may be, deliberately growing a potential alien threat doesn’t really seem like an advisable goal for Earth’s space agencies. But with so little contact between the crew and Earth, apparently they are free to cook up whatever alien menace they see fit. Though he knows nothing about what this fast-growing creature is capable of, Bakare plays with Calvin’s “proto-appendages” like a doting father, protected only by thin plastic gloves. Naturally this bites him in the… hand, not much later.\n\nAs day 25 dawns, we hear a shipwide alarm, sending the crew to the lab to find gas leaking from a tank. At this point, we see how flimsy the ship’s quarantine system actually is — unlike real quarantine systems with airlocks, decontamination showers and other failsafes, the ISS lab is just a room with a glass box, which happens to contain an alien life form the crew has been diligently growing for weeks. Reynolds just opens the door and walks into the room to shut off the gas, exposing the rest of the station to whatever might be in the room. He switches character abruptly into the voice of reason, scolding Bakare for acting like Calvin is his “buddy,” the first time this idea has occurred to anyone on the ship. Ferguson, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, goes into a tirade about how it’s her job to “protect these firewalls,” which obviously don’t actually exist. Helpfully, she does more or less point this out, which makes the whole exercise feel even more silly. But it’s about to get sillier.\n\nAfter Calvin goes dormant, presumably trying to escape to a better movie, Bakare decides to shock it with an electric prod (which every space station has on board, natch). You can pretty much see where this is going. Calvin, now about the size of a couple of strips of bacon, springs to life and wraps around Bakare’s hand with alarming strength, squeezing and then breaking it. (Suddenly those plastic gloves don’t seem like such a good idea.) Reynolds and Gyllenhaal are about to break in to save him (quarantine, schmorantine) when Bakare passes out, floating weightlessly in the middle of the lab (he spends a surprising amount of time in the film incapacitated). Calvin tries to escape through the glove, first pushing on it and then snapping the electric wand and using it to cut through the glove and escape into the lab (even rubbery little aliens can see how poor your procedures are, guys).\n\nNow that Calvin has broken though the lab’s first and only real line of defense, the crew has a decision to make: do they contain the threat in the lab, or do they risk the entire crew, mission and ship to rescue Bakare? After watching Calvin brutally kill a poor rat the crew has strapped down in the lab as a sort of coal mine canary, they make a painful but obvious decision — they must keep Calvin contained and of course I’m joking Reynolds flings open the door, rushes into the room and pulls Bakare out. Just as they get him out, Calvin wraps around Reynolds’ foot, and the team suddenly remembers the concept of quarantine and shuts Reynolds in the lab with Calvin. Joke your way out of this one, smartass!\n\nNow it’s time for Reynolds to earn his action movie star paycheck, as he goes into battle with the cute little alien, first with an oxygen candle and then a makeshift flamethrower, because fire in an oxygen-filled can in space is definitely your friend.\n\nNow it’s time for Reynolds to earn his action movie star paycheck, as he goes into battle with the cute little alien, first with an oxygen candle and then a makeshift flamethrower, because fire in an oxygen-filled can in space is definitely your friend. As he chases it around the lab with yes a goddamn flamethrower on a spaceship he has several opportunities to bail out through the hatch, but he’s committed and this is just too good a way to die to stop now. Calvin waits until he’s out of fuel, then dramatically climbs down Reynolds’ throat. We don’t get a full chestburster-style bloodbath, but definitely some CGI zero-G splatter as Reynolds is released from his contract.\n\nBut wait, remember the flamethrower yes there was a glorious flamethrower? It’s not done with us yet, boyo. Still lit, it floats up to the ceiling and sets off the fire suppression system, which somehow didn’t mind Reynolds’ flametastic antics a moment ago, but who even cares at this point right? Calvin bursts out of Reynolds’ now-jokeless mouth to see what’s going on, and we see it has grown inside Reynolds to the size of a small squid in the space of about 60 seconds (kind of like one of those sitcoms where they have different actors playing successively older versions of a character, so they suddenly age 10 years and everybody pretends not to notice).\n\nCalvin senses an opening, literally, and tries to escape through the gas vents, because of course those lead directly into the rest of the ship somehow and not into a compressed gas canister. The crew frantically and somewhat hilariously tries to close the vents one by one as Sanada gets some of the movie’s best cheesy sci-fi movie lines (“The CPU overrode us,” “The system won’t give me access to it,” “I can’t control them all at once”). All that’s missing is a computer voice calmly insisting “I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.”\n\nOf course, the slippery alien manages to squeeze through the last vent, which inexplicably means “It could be anywhere now,” which of course makes no sense. Attempts to explain “That’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works” fall on deaf ears as the movie plods forward. And we’ve got so much more to do! So let’s continue.\n\nSpacewalk with me\n\nAs the crew tends to Reynolds’ body (he’s in a better place now, no matter where he is), they decide to send a message to mission control about the alien (this is the last time they attempt to communicate with Earth, whose sole input on the mission has consisted of “affirmative” and “congratulations”). But oops, wouldn’t you know it, the transmitter suddenly fails in some kind of alien ex machina, or perhaps they just hit their Verizon data cap with all that live birth streaming.\n\nBut oops, wouldn’t you know it, the transmitter suddenly fails in some kind of alien ex machina, or perhaps they just hit their Verizon data cap with all that live birth streaming.\n\nThat means Russian crew member Olga Dihovichnaya has to spacewalk to fix it, because of course she does. She gets to make a few Russian references in another attempt at shallow character development, as she climbs around on the ship’s hull. She opens an outside valve and surprise! Out pops Calvin, who proceeds to wrap around her leg and damage her suit, causing coolant to leak into her suit and fill her helmet. She starts to drown as she frantically tries to get back to the airlock, though it’s not at all clear what they’re planning to do once she reaches the airlock with Calvin in tow.\n\n(As a side note, I initially thought this scene was pretty far-fetched, but apparently something like this actually did happen once to Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, which was probably the inspiration for this scene. That makes it one of the few plausible scenes in the movie.)\n\nIt’s actually a pretty harrowing scene, and it ends in an unexpected way — as Gyllenhaal tries to let Dihovichnaya in the airlock, she works against him, preventing him from opening the door, knowing she must not let Calvin back in (as is the case throughout the film, Gyllenhaal isn’t the least bit concerned about containing Calvin). But it begs the question — if she is determined to prevent Calvin from getting back into the space station, and if she knows she’s going to die, why not just push herself away from the ship and make sure it doesn’t get back inside?\n\nAll this leads to a somber moment for the crew — the death of Reynolds didn’t cause so much of a stir, because fuck that guy apparently, but Dihovichnaya dying was too far. Bad Calvin! But the crew doesn’t have long to grieve, because they have to make sure Calvin doesn’t wiggle its way back onto the ship.\n\nI don’t think that’s how rocket engines work\n\nIn a second sequence reminiscent of an Aliens-style “they’re inside the room” scenario, they decide the only way Calvin can get back into the ship is through… the thrusters. Now, I’m not a rocket scientist, but I’m fairly confident a rocket propulsion system filled with highly toxic gases is not directly connected to the interior cabin of a space station. Just spitballing here. But stay with me here, because it gets better.\n\nSanada, supposedly a highly qualified astronaut, starts firing the space station’s thrusters based on temperature readings that supposedly indicate where Calvin is trying to “get in” (to where? Where does a rocket thruster lead to?). And what do thrusters do when you fire them? They burn fuel, and move the ship! So in trying to prevent the alien from crawling into a hole that leads nowhere, Sanada inadvertently burns off most of their remaining fuel, and sends the space station into a decaying orbit. He manages to correct the situation, but not before demonstrating the “humans are the weakest link” message that is the key takeaway from this movie.\n\nNow Calvin is somehow back inside (best to just go with it), and the crew decides they have to do the one thing they know will prevent the alien from reaching Earth — vent all the oxygen and suffocate Calvin, along with themselves. So they open the station’s valves and wait for the inevitable. But inevitably, something goes wrong—Bakare suddenly goes into cardiac arrest, and the team rushes to revive him with a defibrillator. They shortly discover the cause of his distress—Calvin has stowed away around Bakare’s leg, under his jumpsuit (sort of like space Spanx, I guess), apparently unperturbed by being violently shocked three times. We now see Calvin’s final form, which includes not only flowing fin-like tentacles but — because the filmmakers couldn’t resist — a mean little monster face. Because even though the alien is surprisingly inventive and original, people want their monsters to have mean faces. Otherwise how would you know they’re the bad guys? It’s just like real life.\n\nBecause even though the alien is surprisingly inventive and original, people want their monsters to have mean faces. Otherwise how would you know they’re the bad guys? It’s just like real life.\n\nA frantic chase ensues. Sanada hides in his sleeping pod, narrowly escaping Calvin’s grasp, while Gyllenhaal and Ferguson circle back to tend to the ailing Bakare. But what about Sanada, Bakare asks, just before he breathes his last? Oh don’t worry, Ferguson replies, he’s fine — we stopped venting the air out of the station. Wait, what? Your entire plan was to suffocate Calvin and yourselves along with it, and you just changed your mind? So now what? No time to dwell on that question, because we have another Alien scene to rip off!\n\nEarlier, we saw Gyllenhaal attaching a tracking sensor to himself, and now we see the (obvious) reason: so Calvin can swallow one, and we can have a cool scene where we watch him float around our aforementioned holographic ship blueprint, which also exists for no reason other than this scene! I love it when a plan comes together. Sadly there isn’t enough crew left for a cool “You’re going the wrong way!” exchange.\n\nWith their newfound alien squid tracker, Gyllenhaal and Ferguson manage to trap Calvin in the compartment with Bakare’s body, which they can vent and presumably suffocate Calvin. But literally just then: more humans arrive, with a fresh plot device delivery! Though it’s not clear how many days have passed (if any) since their attempted distress call, a Soyuz capsule shows up — but it soon becomes clear it’s not a rescue mission. As the ship roughly attaches to the station, Ferguson explains that the Soyuz is in fact “Firewall three” — nevermind that neither of the other firewalls were really firewalls. The ship’s mission is to push the ISS out of orbit, probably the most intelligent thing a human has done in the movie so far. Ferguson goes on to explain the concept at length to Gyllenhaal, who looks at her like she’s explaining the plot of Cloud Atlas. So how’s our squishy lil’ buddy going to get out of this one?\n\nThe plot thins\n\nBut wait! We still have one dumb human not in the scene, and Sanada isn’t going to just sit in his sleeping pod and let the others save humanity. I actually found this scene somewhat difficult to follow the first time I saw it, given the poor lighting, nondescript compartments and quick cuts, but stay with me here.\n\nFeeling the Soyuz docking, Sanada assumes the ship is here to rescue them, and he heads toward the compartment where it’s docked, which also happens to be where Calvin is trapped (of course). Ferguson and Gyllenhaal see him on the tracker, and rush to stop him.\n\nSanada, clearly seeing that he is the last thing standing in the way of a human victory, springs into action. First he opens the compartment where Calvin is trapped, releasing the alien, and then opens the hatch to the Soyuz, something the Soyuz pilot apparently didn’t anticipate despite the fact that his mission is to kill everyone on the station. Calvin sees a fresh meatbag to attack, and ignores the vulnerable Sanada to go after the Soyuz pilot, who is wearing the same kind of spacesuit Calvin has previously been unable to penetrate. Despite the fact that it has no sharp bits and has so far been largely incapable of harming a human except by squeezing and mouth invasion, Calvin somehow immediately turns the Soyuz pilot into a bloody mess.\n\nFor reasons that are unclear other than plot advancement, the Soyuz breaches its connection to the station, and the station’s air starts to escape. As the station violently vents its atmosphere for two full minutes (how much air is in this station?), Calvin attempts to climb up the humans and back into the station. Sanada, sensing he has done all he can to sabotage his fellow humans, grabs Calvin and is pulled into the Soyuz (which doesn’t make sense, as the air is venting between the Soyuz and the station). Ferguson and Gyllenhaal manage to clamber back into the station and shut the hatch, again trapping Calvin in an airless compartment. Despite venting what must have been all the air in the station, the last two humans (not to mention the otherwise alarm-prone ship computer) seem unconcerned about the oxygen situation.\n\nBreathing turns out to be the least of their worries, though, as they watch the drifting Soyuz break away and nearly take the rest of the station with it. Gyllenhaal realizes all this excitement has pushed the station back into a decaying orbit, in addition to the temperature dropping rapidly.\n\nThe next scene, though relatively inconsequential in the film itself, is one of the few good ideas Life has: Gyllenhaal reads part of Goodnight Moon, the children’s book given to Sanada earlier by Dihovichnaya as Sanada’s wife is giving birth (because if your spaceship crewmate is becoming a father, you bring baby gifts along with you into space). This scene is recontextualized in a trailer for Life, along with tense music, as a sort of elegy for Earth if the alien manages to get there (“Goodnight room, goodnight moon… goodnight light and the red balloon”) that’s actually pretty clever.\n\n“Goodnight Moon” becomes a sort of elegy for Earth if the alien manages to get there (“Goodnight room, goodnight moon… goodnight light and the red balloon”), which is actually pretty clever.\n\nSixteen oxygen candles\n\nBut back to our far-less-clever NASA crew, who are running out of time to screw all this up. Gyllenhaal hatches a plan to use the ship’s oxygen candles to lure the oxygen-hungry Calvin into a lifeboat with him and steer it out into space (despite the fact that Calvin can last much longer without air than they can). Gyllenhaal entices Calvin out of hiding with the candles, which Calvin hugs like they’re its favorite teddy bear, managing to get into the lifeboat with Calvin close behind. He launches his lifeboat as Ferguson enters the other one, the plan being that Gyllenhaal will manually fly his pod into space while hers automatically flies back to Earth.\n\nSo we watch as Gyllenhaal’s pod drifts into space, despite Calvin pinning back his arms and opening his helmet (behaviors it has never previously exhibited, but then Calvin is “smart,” as the crew repeatedly tells us, which pretty much means “it has read the script so it knows exactly what to do to move the plot forward”). There’s a difference between smart and “understands things it has never seen before,” such as ship propulsion mechanics and—but let’s just be finished with this sad mess.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferguson’s pod enters the atmosphere and gently floats to an oceanic splashdown — or so the filmmakers want to believe you will think, despite a tellingly long buildup that soon reveals, JK! Of course it was the other way around, and it is Gyllenhaal’s alien infested ship that has landed on Earth to be “rescued” by Vietnamese fishermen, while Ferguson’s flies stupidly into space, thanks to a collision with part of the deteriorating space station. Game over, man!"
