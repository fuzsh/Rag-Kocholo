        "text": "The continuous shot (known as a \"oner\") floats in and out of different areas of the space station, even turning upside down at one point to show just how insane the layout of the ISS is. All the while, the shot peeks out of the window into space to build the drama of the capsule getting closer and closer.\n\nEspinosa knew he wanted to do the oner as soon as he got the \"Life\" script.\n\n\"The oner in cinema history belongs right now to two genres: the gangster movie and the science-fiction picture,\" Espinosa recently told Business Insider. \"I did my gangster movie [\"Easy Money\"] and I didn't do a oner and I always blamed myself for it, that I didn't throw myself out there. So when I got this one, I thought I have to do a oner, to understand the claustrophobia and the ballet that these characters have to do to survive.\"\n\nThough he went in with the right intentions, the execution turned out to be a lot harder than he anticipated.\n\nFilming the shot took a month of preparation with the actors, who did everything from wirework to dance training to pull off the movements. And for everything to work perfectly, the sets had to rotate and be in sync. This allowed for the shot to be more continuous and for cuts not to be hidden (yes, many \"oners\" do have cuts â€” they're just disguised).\n\n\"Halfway through I thought that I had gone mad,\" Espinosa said, \"that this was completely impossible.\"\n\nLooking for guidance, he reached out to three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.\n\n\"He did it for 'Gravity' and he said, 'A oner in zero gravity equals vomit,'\" Espinosa said.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the director was in good hands. His cinematographer Seamus McGarvey is known for creating one of the greatest oners of all time in the 2007 movie \"Atonement.\"\n\n\"He was great support,\" Espinosa said of McGarvey."
