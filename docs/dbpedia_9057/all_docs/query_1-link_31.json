Something Different for Franklin, TN! We’re kicking it off Tuesday, July 9th! Punk rock AND a movie? But how?\n\nVinnie Caruana, lead singer of The MovieLife & I Am The Avalanche will play a full acoustic set of all his classic jams. Come hear the songs that have been anthems for many sweaty club nights, stripped down acoustic on our refurbished vintage stage! Then grab your popcorn and get back to your seat to see his movie pick of “Three Amigos”! Laugh out loud and quote along!\n\nThis is more than just a show. It’s Something Different! Doors open at 6 PM! We’ll have a DJ on stage playing true punk, real emo, and classic indie songs. Videos will be on screen. Don’t miss our FREE raffle for some cool stuff! Hang with your friends and learn about a new band. Check out some cool records in the lobby from Franklin’s own Luna Records! And up first on stage is More Weight! A local band that even includes an employee of the theatre! So come on out and support the next generation! We are excited to bring you the very first Something Different - that new fun hang you’ve been looking for!"
