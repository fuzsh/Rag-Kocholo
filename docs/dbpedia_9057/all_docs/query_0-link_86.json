        "text": "Okay, I have a little confession to make. When the movie, Life As We Know It staring Katherine Heigl (as Holly Berenson) and Josh Duhamel (as Eric Messner) first came out a few years back, I didn‚Äôt go see it even though it was filmed right here in Atlanta. The reason? The previews of the movie reminded me too much of another Katherine Heigl movie I had seen years before and didn‚Äôt care for called, Knocked Up.\n\nRecently, when I came across Life As We Know It on Netflix, I decided to give it a watch. The movie was okay and definitely better than Knocked Up, but it began with a super sad event as both parents (Alison and Peter) of the baby featured in the movie (Sophie) are tragically killed in an automobile accident. De-pressing!\n\nDespite that dark cloud hanging over the rest of the movie, Life As We Know It, did have one thing going for it: a fabulous movie house! And guess what?!\n\nWe‚Äôre going to tour that wonderful movie house today, with a bonus tour of the real house that was used in the exterior shots and acted as inspiration for much of the interior set of the movie! Let‚Äôs get started!\n\nThe actual home featured in the movie is located at 4172 Club Drive NE, Atlanta, Georgia, an area of Atlanta with beautiful old homes. Here‚Äôs a view of the front of the home as seen in the movie, Life As We Know It.\n\nAnd here it is in real life as it appeared in a real estate listing when it went on the market a few years ago. It is a beautiful home, isn‚Äôt it? I love the front porch; even though it‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs elegant and very fitting for this Colonial style home built in 1945.\n\nThis is a rear view of the home as seen in the movie.\n\nHere‚Äôs how the back of the actual home looks in real life. Looks like they may have used the table and chairs in the movie and just swapped out the cushions and umbrella. Or, perhaps the owners purchased a new red umbrella by the time the home was listed for sale.\n\nMovies are rarely filmed inside real homes because there‚Äôs just never enough space to get all the equipment and lighting needed inside a real home. The foyer designed on set for the home looked like this in the movie.\n\nNotice how closely the movie foyer mimics the real foyer in the Atlanta home. For the movie it was made a fair amount wider. There‚Äôs no way you could get a table on either side of the door in the real home like we see in the movie.\n\nNotice how they changed the look of the stair rail, too. I think the wood stair rail is probably more in keeping with the Colonial style of the home, which may be why they chose it for the filming.\n\nFrom here out, we‚Äôll being touring the movie house. We‚Äôll follow that with a full tour of the actual home in Atlanta. I liked this view of the entry with the lamp lit up.\n\nThe set interior for the movies gives us nice wide views into many of the rooms of the home. Because we got so many great shots like this of the interior while viewing the movie, I fully believe the producers and set designers knew this house was going to be a big part of the movie and a hit with the audience. Virtually the whole movie takes place inside the home so it‚Äôs definitely another ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù in the movie.\n\nI‚Äôve never seen French doors done like this, but I love it! It‚Äôs kind of like having sidelights for doors.\n\nIn this scene, we get a view of the living room when a CPS (Child Protective Services) worker visits to assess Sophie‚Äôs living situation. Without going into a long explanation of the story behind the movie (see Wikipedia for that) the gist of the story is that after Sophie‚Äôs parents (Alison and Peter) are killed, Holly and Eric get a big surprise when they find out they were made co-godparents of Sophie in the will. Holly and Eric are like oil and water, about as different as it gets. On top of that, they can barely stand each other. So things get interesting when they try living together as caregivers/parents for Sophie.\n\nAnother view of the living room during a birthday party to celebrate Sophie‚Äôs first birthday. Love all the built-in shelving and the French doors we see throughout the movie.\n\nMuch of the lighting in the movie is very subdued. That may have been intentional to fit with the somber story-line of the movie. Here‚Äôs we get a view into the dining room. Several of the rooms have beautiful coffered ceilings.\n\nWe get a view into the kitchen in this scene with Alison and Holly, a scene that obviously takes place prior to the car accident.\n\nI really liked the kitchen in the movie. I‚Äôm crazy about white cabinetry, especially when combined with glass-paned doors. One interesting tidbit about the movie: Did you know they used triplets for Sophie‚Äôs part? Their names are Brooke, Brynn and Lexi and they are absolutely adorable!\n\nHere‚Äôs a nice view of the other side of the kitchen with more of those fabulous glass-front cabinet doors. I think I would have them on every cabinet in my kitchen if I could get away with it. I just about do now as seen in THIS post. üôÇ\n\nThe interior is nice and open right through to the breakfast area. Notice the rock fireplace there on the left.\n\nIt‚Äôs a spot where Holly and Eric have some frank conversations. Those are the strangest half-shutters I‚Äôve ever seen. When you design and build shuttersto cover the lower half of a window, you never stop at the height seen here. You always take it up to the sash or halfway point of the window. That looks so weird. They obviously didn‚Äôt consult a shutter company when designing the sets! üòâ\n\nI always love it when movies do this, give us a view into the home as if we‚Äôre passing by and just happen to get a peek inside.\n\nReminds me of this scene from our tour of the movie, Under the Tuscan Sun\n\nWe don‚Äôt get a lot of views of the upstairs of the home.\n\nThis was the best view we got of the master bedroom. Love how they put a fireplace in the master‚Ä¶so romantic but unfortunately wasn‚Äôt lit for this scene.\n\nI never could get a great shot of nursery, but I managed to snag this one view showing the ceiling that‚Äôs covered in fluffy white clouds.\n\nHope you enjoyed some views of the home from this romantic comedy!"
