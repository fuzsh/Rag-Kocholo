        "text": "Punk rock band The Movielife originated in Long Island, New York in 1997 with founding members Vinnie Caruana on vocals, guitarists Alex Amiruddin and Eddie Reyes, bassist Nick Ghanbarian, and drummer Evan Baken. Early on, Reyes left the group to later form Runner Up and subsequently Taking Back Sunday. Ghanbarian also left and would go on to join Bayside. Around 2003, the group disbanded and announced their official reunion in December of 2014.\n\nNow over 20 years later, The Movielife head out with New Found Glory, Bayside, and William Ryan Key of Yellowcard on a multi-date tour through North America, titled The Sick Tour. They recently stopped at House of Blues Chicago for two back-to-back nights, and from start to finish, did not disappoint. Check out their set below from night one.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, Cities in Search of a Heart, was released September 2017 through Rise Records."
