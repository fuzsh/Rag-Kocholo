        "text": "Vinnie Caruana’s debut solo album, Survivor’s Guilt, was released by Equal Vision Records in the U.S. and distributed by Big Scary Monsters in the UK. The album was pressed on a handful of variants. There are a whopping six variants in total, three for the U.S. and three for the UK.\n\nThe three U.S. variants are baby blue limited to 300 copies, opaque light yellow limited to 500 copies and grey with white splatter limited to 700 copies. The baby blue is a tour exclusive and the pressing info is per a sign at his merch table, so that number may or may not be accurate. The yellow is a retail exclusive and the grey with white splatter is exclusive to Equal Vision web store hosted by MerchNow.\n\nThe UK variants are pink limited to 100 copies, grey with white splatter limited to 300 copies and black limited to 300 copies. The pink is a UK tour exclusive, but Vinnie only did five UK shows the pink variant was available at. It’s more of a baby pink that a hot pink. The grey with white splatter is only available from big Scary Monsters online as far as I can tell, and the black is available online from Big Scary Monsters and UK indie record stores like Banquet Records. I’m also not sure if there are any difference between the UK splatter and U.S. splatter, but the mock ups for each look completely different. The UK splatter mock up looks like an actual picture of the completed record while the U.S. splatter mock up still looks like a computer rendering, even after the record was released.\n\nAll the U.S. variants come with a hype sticker indicating the color of the record. All U.S. copies come with a download card for high quality 320 kbps MP3s. An insert ins included with U.S. copies as well, which has the lyrics printed on both sides along with the liner notes taking up a portion of one side as well. I can’t speak to any details like this for the UK pressing as I don’t own a copy.\n\nPrices for the U.S. pressing range from $20 before shipping from MerchNow, between $19 to $23 at indie record stores to around $20 at online distros. But if you shop around and be patient you can get a great deal on this record. I bought it for $14 shipped taking advantage of coupon codes and already lower prices at one distro. Odds are though that this record will sit around for a while and it will get marked down. If it hasn’t sold out at this point it likely won’t for a long time, and considering his earlier EP, A City By The Sea hasn’t sold out after almost two years, Survivor’s Guilt will likely fall into the same boat.\n\nBefore anyone jumps down my throat for buying an Enjoy The Ride Records (ETR) release know that I didn’t buy this directly from ETR, I won it on ebay for $10 shipped over one year after it was released. This soundtrack, for the film Bridge And Tunnel, was pressed as a single LP limited to 500 total copies. It comes in a die-cut jacket with an insert, which slides into the jacket to add artwork to the cover through the die-cut portion. Neither a download code nor a CD copy of the soundtrack are included with the vinyl version. The vinyl version is the only physical release however, so a CD not being included is understandable.\n\nThere are 50 copies pressed on “label blowout” and 450 copies on clear. To be clear, all copies are on random colored vinyl, the label blowouts are just a clear base with random colors swirled in along with the center labels broken into fragments. The process to make a “label blowout” variant is pretty simple, the plant presses two records on top of each other and the lower label essentially explodes and gets broken up into the finished record as it’s pressed. For the 450 random colors variant, the colors I have seen are clear, red, green, brown and blue. There is some marbling in some copies, some came out as splatters and some as swirls.\n\nThe soundtrack features new and unreleased songs from Vinnie Caruana of The Movielife and I Am The Avalanche fame, John Nolan of Taking Back Sunday and Straylight Run fame, Bayside, NGHBRS and Happy Body Slow Brain. I bought this soundtrack to keep my Vinnie Caruana, Movielife and I Am The Avalanche collections complete.\n\nETR pulled out all the gimmicky stops with trying to move this release, but he still has copies lying around he can’t seem to give away. First of all, you couldn’t buy one of the “label blowouts” on their own. They were randomly given out in orders, but if you ordered more than one copy hoping to up your chances of getting a “label blowout,” the guy who runs ETR may have given one to you if you asked him to. So that pretty much outs the “label blowout” variant as a sales ploy to get people to buy more copies of the release. The next couple gimmicks happened well after the record was released and ETR was still sitting on unsold copies. ETR had John Nolan sign 10 copies of the record, but only made eight available to the public. In the summer of 2015 ETR had former WWF/WWE wrestler Virgil, who appears in the film, to autograph 5 copies of the soundtrack and hand number them.\n\nThe oddest thing is the random sales ETR has on this soundtrack. When it first came out he charged $20 for it. Then when it didn’t sell out he lowered the price to $15 and advertised it to death on social media. Then when they still didn’t sell he bumped the price back up to $20. Fast forward a few months and he is again running a sale on this for 15% off the $20 original price tag, so on sale again for $15. Meanwhile his business partner at Looney Tunes record store/Brookvale Records has been trying to sell a copy on Discogs for $10 for months with no luck.\n\nTo date I Am The Avalanche has released all three of their albums on vinyl, on three different labels. An interesting fact that you can drop on your music snob friends. It should be pointed out that I Surrender Records, who released this, the band’s latest album, also released their last album as well, they did not release it on vinyl however.\n\nWolverines received quite a few variants, and before it was even released was on its “second pressing.” I say “second pressing” because it’s not like the album went OOP and the label decided to press more copies. They decided to press as many copies to meet demand, and there are a two different ways to look at that. You could be happy the album won’t be hard to find and is available for all the band’s fans to buy and support them, or you could be upset that your “rare” record is no longer as rare as it originally was. I can see arguments for both sides, but the later makes you look like a selfish prick. I’ve been known to voice my displeasure at labels/bands who do shady things like press up more records than advertised, release more variants after pre-orders start or sell out, lie about pressing info to drive up sales, and false advertise or lie in general. The case with Wolverines somewhat falls into the category where I voice my displeasure, but it’s not egregious enough to worry about. In reality there is nothing to complain about because the label never said the magic words “limited pressing,” “one and only pressing” or “one time pressing.”\n\nAnyway, back to more pertinent info, the pressing info. For the “first press,” there were 200 copies on black/white swirl (I Surrender exclusive), 500 on translucent red, 300 on non metallic gold (hand-numbered, tour exclusive), 300 on white (euro exclusive), 200 as a picture disc (Banquet Records UK exclusive). There are also 300 copies on pink, which was announced and put up for sale about one week after the black/white swirl and red copies sold out through I Surrender. This was not announced as part of the first or second pressing, they just appeared one day.\n\nMore confusion lies with yet more variants I Surrender put up for sale without any major fanfare. You had to follow their social media platforms to find out about it, I think they actually only posted about it on their instagram account. Otherwise you would’ve just stumbled across them in their webstore. Two new colors were added to the “first” and/or “second pressing” (I throw quotes on it because it’s not a true second pressing since the album was not even released yet), clear limited to 200 copies and green limited to 500 copies. I consider it part of the “first pressing” and not the first pressing because the label added copies willy-nilly to meet demand. Again not something I agree with, adding more copies to a pressing after it sells out, but not something to get too worked up about or complain about since they’re keeping a record readily available. The “second pressing”, formally labeled such by I Surrender (I throw quotes on it because it’s not a true second pressing since the album was not even released yet), has two variants; highlighter yellow limited to 544 copies and “warm” red limited to 548 copies.\n\nAn important note is that this record does not come with a download code. You only get a digital download of the album if you order directly from I Surrender Records, who emails you a download code after purchase.\n\nIn late 2013 Enjoy The Ride Records announced one their releases, which was a joint effort with Fadeaway Records, a not defunct, but dormant label. It was a compilation on a grand scale. It wound up being a triple LP featuring unreleased songs from many popular indie scene bands. Profits from the comp went towards cancer research. Some of the bands on this comp included Brand New, Saves The Day, Motion City Soundtrack, Hot Rod Circuit, Nightmare Of You, Far , Fred Mascherino of Taking Back Sunday and Terrible Things fame, The Honorary Title, Vinnie Caruana of The Movielife and I Am The Avalanche fame, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra fame, Matt Pryor, Reggie And The Full Effect, Head Automatica, Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance fame, and Kevin Devine. It was comprised mostly of bands producer and head of Fadeaway Records, Michael Dubin, worked with or had some connection to over the years. The comp was simply entitled Friends.\n\nThe record is housed in a triple panel gatefold jacket and comes with an insert to boot. Each copy is also hand numbered out of the variant total, not the total amount of copies pressed. All copies were also pressed on colored vinyl, some sort of splatter was used for the several variants this comp has. There were some, what I feel were shady goings-on with the variants.\n\nThere is a “1st press” and a “2nd press” of this record. I use the quotes because they really are one combined pressing. The “1st press” sold out, rather slower than expected, and right on the heels of it selling out, before the “1st press” even shipped, a “2nd” pressing was announced and put up for pre-order. Anyone with common sense would say how can there be a second pressing when the records from the first pressing were not even done and pressed yet.\n\nThe nonsense with the variants continued even after all the “pressings” were announced, as the “1st press” had a friends press, limited to 100 copies. When the comp was first announced there was no mention that there would be a friends press, only that the comp would be limited to 500 copies. Since it took so long to sell out the actual 400 copies of the pressing that were available to the public didn’t matter. It continued still with the“2nd” pressing, as it had a friends press of sorts, which was called an “extra special variant.” I’m not making that up for giggles, the two labels responsible for this comp actually called it that; “extra special variant.” This “extra special variant” was split into two groups; 50 copies were randomly given out in orders for the “2nd pressing” and 50 copies could only be pre-ordered at the compilations’ record release show. Yes, a compilation album comprised of unreleased songs had a release show, where I should point out none of the bands featured on the comp played.\n\nSo the pressing info for this comp is as follows: “1st press” – 400 copies on red/white/black splatter and 100 copies on red/clear/white splatter (friends press). “2nd press” – 500 copies on milky clear/red/blue/yellow splatter and 100 copies on black/blue/white splatter (“extra special variant”). Again, a triple panel gatefold jacket houses the records. An insert is also include.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this comp is the price gouging and downright ripping off of people. The comp cost $40 before shipping, a bit outrageous but since it was a triple LP and came in a nice jacket with an insert it became a bit easier to swallow. My justifiable pricing, a price which I consider acceptable for multi-disc releases is $10 per LP. So in that train of thought this should be closer to $30 than $40. Again, the finer points of the release somewhat justify the price tag. After hearing how much it cost to produce this comp, which was stated publicly by the head of Fadeaway Records on a public message board (and which I took a screen shot of for posterity), each copy cost at most $20 to produce. I understand the business model of doubling your money or don’t bother, but in this case that markup is a bit drastic.\n\nThe shipping charges are where I have a major problem; I find them unacceptable. Fadeaway Records charged $9 for shipping, and they wound up shipping it media mail, which as well all known is the cheapest shipping method available for records. The actual cost on my mailer said $3.65; factor in material costs (guy who runs the labels packaged orders himself so no employee costs) and shipping shouldn’t have been more than $6, and that’s being generous.Fadeaway Records justified the price points as, direct quote; “The proceeds are going to charity. Any overages on shipping will be donated to charity.”\n\nI have no problems with charitable donations, but customers, anyone really, shouldn’t be forced to pay more money so someone else can make a bigger donation to charity. If I wanted to donate more of my money to charity I would donate the money directly to the charity of my choosing myself. That decision shouldn’t be made by someone else and it definitely shouldn’t be made by a bias third party.\n\nVinnie Caruana’s debut solo release, an EP entitled City By The Sea was released by a handful of labels. I Surrender Records handled the digital and CD versions and Run For Cover Records (RFC) handled the vinyl version in the U.S. while Xtra Mile handled all European aspects of the release. As expected there was a delay with the records from RFC, which has become something you can set your watch to. The length of the delay this go around was almost 3 months.\n\nThere are several variants for the record, three colors for the U.S. pressing and one color for the European pressing. RFC pressed 300 copies on gold vinyl, 300 copies on black featuring hand numbering and blank center labels, 500 copies on silver/black marble and 700 on green/white marble. The silver/black marble is the only opaque color with the gold and “green/white marble” are translucent. he “green/white marble” turned out to be a translucent solid green. The black copies were only sold on Viinie’s acoustic basement tour and come autographed on top of the hand numbering, which are both done on the blank white center labels. Xtra Mile had 300 copies on clear vinyl. The U.S. pressing features an etched b-side while the Euro pressing does not.\n\nSo far the only color to sell out is the gold from the U.S. pressing. All remaining colors from the U.S. pressing are available from RFC but if you order via another source I am not sure what color you will get. Most of the time if you order outside the label directly you get the least rare color, but with this record that is not the case as I ordered from Interpunk and received the silver/black marble.\n\nPeace’d Out is a side project of sorts featuring Vinnie Caruana (I Am The Avalanche & The Movielife) on vocals Steve Choi (RX Bandits) on guitar, Roger Camero (No Motiv) on bass and Casey Deitz (The Velvet Teen) on drums. The sound of the band is much, much harder than the type of music most people associate with these guys. Many would call Peace’d Out a hardcore band, but I usually don’t slap labels on bands.\n\nThe band’s first release is this self-titled EP, which came out in late 2012. It’s only being sold on vinyl and digitally, however a CD version of the EP does come with the black variant of the 10″ and only the black version. The EP was pressed on four colors, with most being exclusive to certain retailers or only obtainable by chance after buying a certain color. There were 200 copies pressed on pink, which was exclusive to the band/label (Sound The Siren) webstore. The pink copies were being sold for $3 more than the other color, black, being sold in their store. Pink copies cost $15 while black copies cost only $12. Pink copies are completely sold out and is the other color to sell out as of writing this. There were 500 copies pressed on blue, which is a Hot Topic exclusive. There were 1000 copies pressed on black, which are widely available and is the color every place is selling other than Hot Topic. Lastly there are 100 copies pressed on oxblood red, which are randomly inserted in place of black copies. I’m not 100% sure if the only way to get a chance to get an oxblood red was by ordering from the band/label webstore. One unique thing about this record is the a-side is etched, so the entire EP is pressed onto the b-side.\n\nI Am The Avalanche’s long overdue sophomore album was finally released earlier this week and it is the first of their albums to be pressed on vinyl. (Their s/t album is also on the way soon) The album is already in its second pressing, even though the band is still selling copies from the first press on tour. The first press did sell out online though during the pre-order phase, but without knowing how many copies the band was given to sell on tour it’s impossible to know how many copies were actually up for grabs during pre-order. The first 100 pre-orders of the first pressing, regardless of color ordered, were given a letterpress print that is hand numbered /100. The print is just a makeshift band logo, done like in a soccer club crest, in red ink on a small piece of paper.\n\nThe first pressing featured four color variants, gold limited to 50 copies (which cost $10 more than the other three colors), “orange creme” (which is basically orange) limited to 100 copies, blue/green mix limited to 140 copies and white limited to 200 copies. The second pressing is only on two colors; light blue swirl limited to 200 copies and green limited to 200 copies. According to the the label the blue/green mix from the first press and light blue swirl from the second press look completely different from each other. The second pressing was announced pretty much right on the heels of the first press selling out online, and it started shipping about a week after being put up for order, even though the band took a good chunk of the first pressing to sell on tour. Obviously a calculated move on the label’s part. I’m all far the availability of records to everyone, but when a second pressing is announced and ships almost immediately after the first pressing selling out, well not even technically sold out or even out of print, you have to question the label’s motives. So even though the record currently has two pressings, you can still easily buy a copy from the first pressing, and there is still the possibility of leftover copies from the first pressing being put up online if they band doesn’t sell them all on tour.\n\nClifton Motel Records was given the rights to press Avalanche United on vinyl from I Surrender Records, the label who actually released the album. The way Clifton Motel does business really irks me, mainly due to what was mentioned above. Seemingly pulling a page out of the Mightier Than Sword playbook, (maybe not so coincidentally the two labels are Brooklyn based) Clifton Motel charges $10 more for the rarest variant, just because it’s the rarest variant. And this is not the only release they’ve done it with. They tried to spin that fact in their favor on message boards, but there is no excuse or reason to charge $10 more for certain colors/variants. They argued that the reason for the price jump was a letterpress print and that the jackets are autographed, but said letterpress print was given away to the first 100 pre-orders regardless of color ordered. I know this because it said it in the item description and also because I received one of the prints, free of charge, even though I ordered a copy on orange. So apparently the band members’ autographs cost $10, when I could meet them before, during or after a show and have them sign anything for free. Especially considering how lame the prints are. Glad I got one for free and didn’t “pay the extra cost” for one.\n\nRegardless of what my opinion is, which many other people felt the same way about, 50 people still coughed up more money just for the gold variant. Some are voicing their displeasure on message boards after realizing they paid $10 extra for basically nothing, while others are happy with it, so it’s a mixed bag of emotions with this first pressing and how it was done.\n\nA new development is that multiple people claim their copies of this record skip in a few places, and it’s not limited to just one color. Often times skipping can be a personal problem. It can can be contributed to someone’s set up, mainly where the tone arm may not be adjusted properly or possibly another problem somewhere in the set up. A dirty and/or new record that needs cleaning could also be the culprit. The people claiming skipping issues have tried a few different things to see if the problem is on their end, but to no avail. While the label has not admitted there is a pressing flaw/error with first press copies, they are asking people who have skipping problems to contact them."
