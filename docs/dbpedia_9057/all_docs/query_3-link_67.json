        "text": "Bryan: “Think You Should Leave” on Netflix.\n\nEdwin: I, for sure, don’t keep up with current television. Outside of the Weather Channel I pretty much live off reruns: “Home Improvement,” “Friends,” “How It’s Made,” “New Yankee Workshop,” “Woodright’s Shop”… I’m boring.\n\nSteve: “Breaking Bad” is the GOAT. “Righteous Gemstones” is my new favorite.\n\nJerred: I have two small boys at home, so I tend to watch a lot of “Paw Patrol.” Luckily, I’m getting them into the classics like “Looney Tunes” and “Tom & Jerry” but damn if that stuff isn’t violent. It puts modern cartoons to shame hahaha!\n\nEdwin: I first gained interest in music when I was about seven. I first started playing bass when I was nine in school orchestra and jazz band. Blink-182, above all else, was the first band that really stuck with me and opened the gateway to SO many bands and genres. Mark Hoppus, to this day, remains as the one single musician that has influenced me the most.\n\nSteve: I began playing guitar around age fifteen. MTV was full of Grunge at that time, so it was easy to catch the bug. I grew up on Long Island, and I was most influenced to take the stage by the local scene happening in the late 90s – The Movielife, Silent Majority, Latterman, and dozens of others showed me it was possible to be young, make music, and make something special from it.\n\nJerred: I grew up in an absurdly religious household and my Mom would only let me buy records from the Christian book store. I got into Punk by discovering MxPx and other Tooth N’ Nail bands which proved to be a gateway drug, leading me down a path to Green Day and Blink-182 which, in turn, led to Bad Religion and NOFX. Punk’s one hell of a drug!\n\nBryan: Pretty much when I first heard “Nevermind” by Nirvana. Obviously, that opened a lot of doors into other Alternative and Punk music, but that’s when I first realized that it was possible to learn an instrument and start a band with friends.\n\nEdwin: A crazy melting pot of talent and genres; so many great artists around the area. There is definitely something for everyone here.\n\nJerred: It may not be what it used to be in the eyes of Punk purists but there’s no shortage of amazing artists and incredibly talented musicians in and around D.C. It’s kinda like a glass half empty or full scenario. It’s easy to focus on the fact that venues all over the city have been disappearing. But, at the same time, we’ve been incredibly fortunate for a new generation of spaces like The Pocket and The Pie Shop to start popping up and filling the void created with the loss of places like The Pinch. We have a beautiful vibe here and I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of the community in the DMV!\n\nBryan: Honestly, it’s a little rough for lower or middle tier melodic or poppy Punk bands. The big acts still do great, but it can be a hard place to break into for new bands. We try to do what we can by booking a few shows and hosting Breakin’ Even Fest. I wish more package tours would leave slots for local openers, as we have some great locals like Curse Words, Teen Cobra, BraceFace, Menage A Garage, Fail Sons, and a bunch more I’m forgetting.\n\nSteve: Hiking, biking, travel with family, and trying to build things. I built some shelves under my staircase in the fall – they turned out level, and that’s good enough for me!\n\nEdwin: Outside of music, I enjoy hiking and rock scrambling. I also tend to dabble in wood crafting and lutherie.\n\nBryan: My wife and I go to the movies a lot, like a few times a month. And I’m a huge fan of the Baltimore Orioles. I’m trying to see them play in every MLB stadium.\n\nJerred: I’m an avid runner. I try to squeeze in at least 15-20 miles a week if I can. It gives me a chance to clear my head and sweat out some of my daily demons or at least that’s what I tell myself. Let’s be honest though, it’s so I can eat like shit and drink too much!"
