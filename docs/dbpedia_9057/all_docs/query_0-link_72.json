The movie follows Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) and Claude Banks (Martin Lawerence) through different tribulations that leads them to getting arrested and charged for a crime they did not commit. Interesting enough, the movie takes place in the 20th century, around the 1930s to be exactly. During this time, the Jim Crow laws were being instituted in the South, which created barriers for African Americans. A quint-essential example of racial prejudice took place when Claude and Ray went into the diner and asked for coffee and a couple slices of pie. However, they were turned around because the all-White established did not serve negroes.\n\nFurthermore, the movie takes place in Mississippi, which is arguably one of the most segregated states in the country. As a matter of fact, the last school to desegregate in Mississippi was Cleveland High School in 2016. Claude and Ray find themselves in prison, surrounded by other Black males, and being monitored by the warden, a White man with a Black trustee.\n\nWatching \"Life\" through a post-realistic lens reinforces the negligence that Blacks are subjected too. Research from the Prison Policy Initiative showed that Black males, especially youth are disproportionately represented in the penal system, yet Blacks make up less than the U.S population. Continuously, Black students account for 15% of the student body for K-12 schools in the US, yet they are suspended and expelled at higher rates than any other race. To change the trajectory of Black students and how they are mistreated, we must incorporate social and emotion learning (SEL) into our classrooms, and to have representation of teachers that is representatives of our students and their cultural experiences. Data from the Pew Research Center recorded that 80% of teachers are White, they mostly work at underserved schools, and have limited experience working with Brown and Black students. These teachers are widening the margin, instead of trying to close the gap. Through a post-realistic lens, we can start to move the needle toward a more just and equitable education for Black youth and society."
