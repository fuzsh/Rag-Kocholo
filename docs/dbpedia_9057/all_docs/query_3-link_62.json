        "text": "FRIDAY\n\nJust because the action doesn't get going until 6 p.m. doesn't mean that Bamboozle Friday is an attenuated experience. On the contrary: the first night of the Bamboozle is a pretty good indication of where the festival is heading. Pop-punk has made way for hip-hop, metal, deathcore, mashups, aggressive dance music, and general electro-mischief. This won't be the rowdiest night of the Bamboozle – there's no way to top Sunday's two-fisted lineup – but this party is starting with a bang.\n\nThe Headliners: At last year's Bamboozle, Wiz Khalifa performed a brief set to a modest but enthusiastic crowd. Twelve months later, he returns as a conquering hero, and proof positive that the Festival's reputation as a cultivator of young talent is no mere hot air. Wiz's combination of Snoop Dogg's concerns (mostly marijuana and cars), 2 Short's insouciant drawl, and Stargate's gleaming Top 40 production has made him one of the biggest stars in contemporary hip-hop. \"Black and Yellow\" was the unofficial anthem of this year's Superbowl; \"No Sleep\" has followed it up the charts. Art-rock act 30 Seconds to Mars is the most unremarkable of the Bamboozle headliners, but they've developed a passionate fanbase, and a cinematic, arena-ready sound that has made them America's answer to MUSE.\n\nStars on the Undercard: Beantown frat-rapper Sam Adams comes across as a rougher version of Asher Roth – less likely to carry your books than he is to shake you down on your way to your dorm room. They love him in the colleges: with little to no airplay, \"Boston's Boy,\" his first release, made its debut at the top of the iTunes sales charts. Travie McCoy made his name with the Gym Class Heroes, a band that fused power-pop and hip-hop several years before B.o.B. hit with the same combination of sounds. On his own, he's incorporated hard-rock and reggae, and \"Billionaire,\" his lead solo single, made the U.S. Top 5. Jordan Witzigreuter of the Ready Set supplied some good, dumb fun to pop playlists last summer with \"Love Like Woe,\" a hand-clapping, stuttering, slightly incomprehensible synthpop number about a confusing relationship.\n\n'Boozle Continuity: Before the Far East Movement made history as the first Asian-American rap act to top the Billboard charts with \"Like a G6,\" they appeared on the B-Boy stage. This year, Dev, whose icy, dispassionate hook made \"Like a G6\" so irresistible, returns to New Meadowlands for a set of her own.\n\nCan't Miss: Kentucky's Emarosa, which began as a generic hard rock band, evolved into one of the most intriguing acts on the pop-punk circuit after adding the elastic-voiced Jonny Craig. Just last week, Emarosa announced that Craig, who has a history of substance abuse, has been pitched out of the group. Reason for concern, sure, but this is an act that thrives on turmoil. Expect the band's Bamboozle show to be scalding: it has something to prove.\n\nSleepers: Neon Hitch isn't a name that most Americans know, but we've heard her work: the British-based electropop songwriter contributed to hits by Ke$ha and 3OH!3. She's a performer, too, and her debut album \"Beg, Borrow or Steal\" comes out in bold day-glo colors later this year. Should you want to paint it black instead, hard-rock doesn't get much more ferocious than Oceano.\n\nLocal Color: The BREAK Contest is a festival-sponsored talent show that gives unsigned bands an opportunity to crash the Bamboozle lineup. Woodbridge progressive-rock trio Audio Insight are one of the winners. And as you'd expect from musicians influenced by Rush and King Crimson, the members of Audio Insight can really play.\n\nBreakout Acts: The Cali Swag District may be making noise with \"Teach Me How to Dougie,\" but it was the New Boyz who fired the first shot of the Los Angeles dance-rap revolution. \"You're a Jerk\" was the street hit, and debut album \"Skinny Jeanz and a Mic\" demonstrated there was much more to the hip-hop duo than party beats. Their second album comes out later this summer. Ninjasonik is a bizarre, compelling electro-rap combo that has used distressed, end-of-the-world samples, blunted mantras, minimalism, and maddening repetition to carve out a place of prominence in the New York City underground. The menacing \"Tight Pants,\" which sounds like a drugged, snarling version of Das Racist, became a leftfield YouTube hit last year.\n\nBurning Question: The Bamboozle organizers aren't throwing a Hoodwink event this year. Instead, they've folded the Hoodwink – which features impersonations, off-the-wall theatrics, and Bamboozle favorites masquerading as other bands – into the festival. There'll be a Hoodwink stage, and Rad Bromance, an all-male Lady Gaga cover band, will be on it. Will it be any good? There's no way to know. Some curiosities are worth indulging, though, and this is one of them.\n\nAnother Burning Question: Is the Bamboozle ready for a school prom? More to the point, is it ready for a school prom hosted by Boyz II Men? The Philadelphia soul combo last hit the Top 40 in 1999 – back when most of the Bamboozle audience was still in elementary school. The band's supporters have always called \"End of the Road\" and \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" timeless; we'll see how much transgenerational appeal these lite radio standards have.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nThis is the day for the pop-punk purists; the old-school Bamboozle fans; the kids who can't wait for the Warped Tour to make its return to Oceanport. Bamboozle welcomes back an armada of guitar-pop favorites, including one beloved group – Long Island's the Movielife – that hasn't played a show in seven years. But Saturday is more than just a look backward. The electropop and hip-hop turn that the festival has taken is inscribed on this lineup, too, as some of the hottest rappers in America step to the microphone.\n\nThe Headliners: Amityville quintet Taking Back Sunday has handled this task before. The influential pop-punk band headlined the first day of the first festival held at the Meadowlands: Bamboozle 2006. At the time, Taking Back Sunday epitomized the Bamboozle style – celebratory, catchy, emotional, a little whiny, firmly grounded in the tradition of muscular '90s alt-rock (Get-Up Kids, Promise Ring, Jimmy Eat World's \"Clarity\"). Meanwhile, the Gaslight Anthem have quickly risen to the status of New Jersey's favorite homegrown punk band, and one that draws from traditional, lyrics-driven guitar rock: the Boss, the Clash, the Replacements. \"American Slang,\" their latest set, even contains a musical love letter to the Court Tavern in New Brunswick. They've earned this spot through hard work and constant touring, and it'll be a thrill to see the Jersey quartet on the Bamboozle's biggest stage.\n\nStars on the Undercard: New Found Glory could easily be playing a headline slot. The Florida pop-punk band's last four albums have all made the U.S. Top 20; attend a pop-punk show at Starland Ballroom, and you're sure to hear \"My Friends Over You,\" the single from 2002's \"Sticks and Stones\" album, between sets. They lack the gravity of Taking Back Sunday and the storytelling grandeur of the Gaslight Anthem, but they're always a good time; should one of the headliners miss a flight, the Bamboozle has a reliable understudy in the wings.\n\n'Boozle Continuity: Lots of it. New Found Glory first played the mainstage in 2007. That same year, Thrice headlined Bamboozle Left, the festival's Californian spinoff. Alkaline Trio, Gatsby's Amercian Dream, and Circa Survive all appeared at the final Asbury Park Bamboozle in 2005. One of the festival's missions is to create a self-sustaining coterie of bands. Saturday is when the Bamboozle heroes come home.\n\nCan't Miss: The Movielife is one influential pop-punk band that was never invited to the party, although the group surely would have been if it hadn't gone on hiatus just as the Bamboozle was gathering steam. Lead singer Vinnie Caruana, who now fronts I Am the Avalanche (Bamboozle class of 2008, incidentally), has appeared at the festival twice, but never with his old bandmates. That changes in 2011, as the Movielife reunites in front of a crowd predisposed to welcome them back with cheers.\n\nSleeper: Sadly, fetching punk rockers Lemuria won't be at the festival, but An Horse may be the next best thing. The Australian duo welds brushwire melodies to scratchy guitar and primitive drumbeats; it's the kind of modest pop that strolls right into the room without bothering to knock, and before you know it, you're happy you've invited it over.\n\nLocal Color: You'll find plenty on the mainstage. But if you're craving a foretaste, Toms River rockers River City Extension make their Bamboozle debut earlier in the evening. Sometimes described as \"shambolic,\" the folk-rock octet isn't nearly as loose as that sounds. These musicians are just exuberant, and they've got plenty to say – think of the band as a cheerier, more approachable version of Titus Andronicus, and you won't be too far off the mark. They put on a terrific live show, too: Bamboozle won't intimidate them.\n\nBreakout Acts: With Paramore down for the count (at least until the band replaces the departed Farro brothers) guitar-pop is missing a strong female voice. Enter Taylor Jardine, frontwoman of We Are the In Crowd. She's far less showbiz than Hayley Williams, but her powerful pipes are radio-ready. The rest of the nation is slowly discovering what Mississippi has known for a long time: Big K.R.I.T. means business. The Southern rapper, who was named part of XXL Magazine's Freshman Class of 2011, is no newcomer – he's been turning out first-rate, sharply-drawn Third Coast hip-hop with a conscious tilt for years now. \"Return of 4Eva,\" his latest mixtape, ought to give him the national recognition he deserves.\n\nBurning Questions: Another member of the Class of 2011, Lil B of the Pack recently announced his intention to release an album called \"I'm Gay.\" (Note: Lil B is not gay.) The attention-craving California rapper loves to rile up his virtual audience with stunts and tweets; offline, he's a work in progress. The two blunted vocalists in Das Racist, composers of the viral hit \"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,\" straddle the line between conceptual artists and joke-rappers. Their punchlines sting, but their live shows have gotten mixed reviews. Can these two oddball hip-hop acts prove that they're more than just Internet sensations?\n\nSUNDAY\n\nIt was one of the unforgettable moments of Bamboozle 2010: Drake, the first emcee to headline the festival, encouraging his massive audience to rap loud enough that Lil Wayne, then incarcerated at Rikers Island, could hear it. Well, Weezy must have heard. John D'Esposito called Lil Wayne the easiest headliner he ever booked – the New Orleans emcee was so excited to come to the Meadowlands that he handled the negotiations himself. Even without the Carter, Bamboozle would have put together another strong lineup on a fraction of Coachella's budget. Scoring Lil Wayne, however, was an absolute coup, and further evidence of the Meadowlands festival's muscle.\n\nThe (Other) Headliners: He co-wrote FloRida's \"Right Round,\" B.o.B.'s smash \"Nothing on You,\" and the unprintable Cee-Lo hit that's bound to be an eternal, naughty wedding band standard. On his own, he topped the charts with \"Just the Way You Are.\" Hawaiian-born singer Bruno Mars has gone from an unknown member of a production team to one of America's most reliable hitmakers in a little more than a year. It isn't all new pop listeners who attend Bamboozle – kids drag their parents, too. This year, there'll be at least one act that the old folks are sure to recognize: vintage heavy metal act Motley Crue. Their showmanship, and their ability to handle a hook while headbanging, has been an inspiration for two generations of theatrical rock bands. A Day to Remember is one of those groups. The Ocala quintet holds together extremely fissile material: hard-riffing metal and speedy pop-punk. It shouldn't work, but it does, and the band has been rewarded with a fanatical following.\n\nStars on the Undercard: In 2007, the Plain White T's topped singles charts in America, Canada, and Germany with \"Hey There, Delilah,\" a fragile acoustic ballad. None of their subsequent efforts have been anywhere near as successful, but the Chicago group remains a popular concert attraction and a familiar sight for MTV Hits viewers. We the Kings have released two singles that should have been bigger than they were: \"Check Yes Juliet\" and \"Secret Valentine.\" They might have been a bit too wimpy to get traction with fans of pop-punk, but they're wildly romantic, and mainstream radio and video channels pushed them hard. They'll get another shot at the brass ring later in 2011. Brilliant, nihilistic crack-rapper Pusha T has a different challenge – he needs to confirm that he can thrive without the moderating influence of his Clipse partner and older brother Malice. His jaw-dropping verse on Kanye West's \"Runaway\" was an awfully positive sign.\n\n'Boozle Continuity: Decaydance Records has supplied Bamboozle with some of its most reliable attractions, including Panic! at the Disco, Hey Monday, Cobra Starship, and Fall Out Boy. This year, imprint owner (and Fall Out Boy bassist) Pete Wentz will debut a new act of his own: the Black Cards, an electropop group that he now calls his primary project.\n\nCan't Miss: The singing Dupree sisters were supposed to be stars, but they went missing in action after falling out of favor with their major label. They're free now, and Eisley, their band, has come back strong with \"The Valley,\" one of the finest releases of 2011 so far. It's an album that documents the Duprees' heartbreak and disappointment – and their perseverance – in frank language.\n\nSleeper: How much excellent music does Valencia have to put out before America takes notice? The Philadelphia quintet gave the world letter-perfect pop-punk on the \"This Could Be a Possibility\" album, returned with \"We All Need a Reason to Believe,\" a gorgeous chronicle of grief withstood, and followed that up with ten songs of singalong glee on \"Dancing With a Ghost.\" Eventually, Valencia will be recognized; let's hope the band is still together when that happens.\n\nBreakout Acts: Mashup deejay Girl Talk was one of the surprise hits of Bamboozle 2010. The organizers are hoping to repeat that success with the Hood Internet, a hipper, somewhat chillier practitioner of the mashup form. They'll be spinning all three nights of the festival. Without ever releasing a full-length, Freddie Gibbs has become the voice of Gary, Indiana. The gangsta rapper's stories are uncompromising, his rhyme style is deft and speedy, and his charisma is undeniable.\n\nLocal Color: Ridgewood has become known as the home of a coterie of critically acclaimed college rockers — Real Estate, Julian Lynch, and the Vivian Girls, among others. But the most successful group from the pretty suburb remains Senses Fail, a vehicle for Buddy Nielsen's shattered storytelling. \"The Fire,\" the band's ferocious latest, plays like a suicide note. Nielsen is still here. His tales of his trips to the brink, however, have the ring of truth to them."
