        "text": "About the Documentary\n\nDirector Jared Leto crafts a sweeping yet intimate cross-section of America shot on a single July 4th in 2017 with 92 film crews fanning out across each of the United States and Puerto Rico to capture A Day in the Life of America. A gargantuan production shot over a single 24 hour period across the country, the film weaves a wide range of beliefs and backgrounds into a rich tapestry of life.\n\nBlack Louisianans talk about historic inequities that greeted soldiers returning to their homes after World War II, while a transgender woman recounts her coming out to her Hasidic Jewish community. A First Nations ceremony takes place in South Dakota while a Muslim girl in Minnesota trains at a boxing gym. A blunt young woman reflects on the opioid epidemic’s repercussions in West Virginia while, eerily, preparations are made for the hateful and ultimately murderous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia a month later. One man in Chicago describes the versions of the United States he witnesses: “One that’s great and beautiful and idealistic. And there’s an America that doesn’t quite mesh up with the ideals.”\n\nContrasting the myths and ideals of America with the harsh reality for most people, A Day in the Life of America is a deep and unflinching look at a country on the verge of upheaval.\n\nThe Filmmaker\n\nFull Credits"
