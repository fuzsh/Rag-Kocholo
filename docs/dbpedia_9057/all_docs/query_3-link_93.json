        "text": "Top Tens: Justin from Kid You Not's Top Ten Punk Rock Influences\n\nHot Water Music\n\nWe’ll start off with our own Florida heroes. Growing up in Jacksonville, not far from Gainesville, I heard a lot about and from this band in the early days. We had a really good local scene at the time, but it was mostly pop-punk bands. When I first heard this, it was a breath of fresh air. It was new, it was exciting, and I wanted to dive more into this specific world of punk rock – a world I didn’t know existed outside of the classics like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, and the popular punk at the time like NOFX, Pennywise, Greenday, etc. My favorite record of theirs to this day is “A Flight and A Crash”. That album was the game changer for me; when I heard that opening guitar riff and urgent vocals, all I could think of was holy shit – these guys are the real deal, who were only getting better with each album. They were already a huge part of the Florida scene, but I knew that album was the next step up.\n\nDescendents\n\nAll I can say is Everything Sucks. By the time I got around to the Descendents, they were already a punk-household name. I never paid much attention to them aside from a song here and there I’d hear from some friend’s burned compilation CD. I loved my raw oldschool punk rock, but they were a little too raw for me at the time (as far as recording quality). But then I heard all the excitement and hype of this new album of this long-awaited new album, their reunion record. Everyone else’s excitement peeked my interest so I grabbed the album when it came out. Damn! This was not the same band I remembered. Now, I go back in their catalog and know that it was always the same band, but “Everything Sucks” had that extra polish to it that I gave it my full attention.\n\nJimmy Eat World\n\nThis is a band that will always be a favorite. Back in the mid-late 90s, Deep Elm Records (who happen to now be the label we are signed to – talk about coming full circle in life!) put out these compilation albums called “The Emo Diaries”. I was big into comps at the time, as it was the perfect way to discover new bands pre-internet. I remember them being great, but I didn’t pay much attention to them outside of that comp. Fast forward a couple years, and I was just starting high school. I started hanging out with a new group of friends, and was discovering new bands in the scene they were a part of. “Clarity” came out, and that’s all they talked about. I remembered the bands, but also don’t remember being completely blown away. After a while, one of those friends finally burned me a copy of this new album. And that is when my world changed. Everything about “Clarity” is just so beautifully done. This was the one album that I myself continued to pass along – burning copies, telling people they needed to hear this.\n\nSamiam\n\nThis is another band I was first introduced to from that same “Emo Diaries” comp as Jimmy Eat World. I remember thinking they were really great as well. However, that’s where I stopped with them as well. While buying all these comps to find new bands was great, it always left me wanting more. I was too young for a job, so once I found those bands I enjoyed, I couldn’t just go out and buy their albums. And there was no internet at the time like today, so you didn’t have the ability to go find more from these bands. So we would just wear these comps out to death. Just like Jimmy, fast forward a couple years to high school. Samiam puts out a new album called “Astray”. Again, friends share a copy. And I’m hooked. I didn’t know at the time about their short stint on a major label, and I’m sure they never got regional radio airplay where I was. So it was a surprise when I first really started listening to them, hearing all these elements of this emo movement, but they had the grit and polish of something I could hear on the radio.\n\nJawbreaker\n\nJawbreaker, I’m ashamed to say, is one that I really came late to. They were a band I always heard about, but for some reason ignored. My first introduction to them was “Dear You”. I have no excuses as to why I didn’t bother listening to them before that, but I wish I had been one of the cool kids. I know there’s always a lot debate as to which was better – pre-Dear You or after. For me, that album is my favorite. Maybe it’s because I didn’t listen before that and develop that love for them. But I do prefer the vocals on that album.\n\nFace To Face\n\nAn all-time great right here. “Don’t Turn Away” was my first by them, and remains my favorite. As a bass player, I really love listening to the bass runs on this album. In the 90s, this was everything I loved about punk rock. It’s just a solid record start to finish. Kid You Not played our first show opening for them, and that moment will stick with me forever.\n\nLess Than Jake\n\nThis was another band that I knew about early on because of how close I grew up to Gainesville. While they played the area often, I didn’t pay much attention to them until “Losing Streak” was first released. I remember first hearing that record, and knew there was something special there. It was different than anything I had heard at that time. It’s was punk, but it wasn’t fully. It was ska, but not really. You could just hear so many different things in what they were doing. They didn’t fit perfectly into any box. There was this energy about them, about that album, that to this day still resonates with me. I also always loved how grounded they were in their local scene, evident by the stories in their songs. I can admit that when \"Losing Streak\" and then \"Hello Rockview\" came out, I was borderline obsessed with Less Than Jake. This is one band that will forever be at the top of my list no matter when in life you ask me.\n\nMotorhead\n\nI love me some Motorhead. When I was in Jr. High and Highschool, I was listening to lot of different things. While I loved my punk rock, I also loved metal. Motorhead were this amazing blend of punk, metal, and rock ‘n roll. They were at the center of the crossroads that connected them all. I don’t know I know of a band that has more been embraced by both the punk and metal communities. I grew up hearing the normal singles that everyone does, such as Ace of Spades and Eat the Rich. I remember Lemmy in the movie Airheads, and understood the jokes about him being God. But it wasn’t until my teenage years that I really decided I wanted to dive into the catalog of this legendary band I always knew about. The first album I decided to pick up was “Bastards”. As with many on this list, that first album has become my favorite. Although, most Motorhead album don’t sound all that different than each other; they knew what they were good at, and that’s what they did. I remember listening to “Bastards” and loving it from the start. But towards the middle of that record, when I first heard Born To Raise Hell – that was my “oh fuck!” moment. That’s where I got hooked. That’s where I decided I needed to dig deeper into the Motorhead catalog, one that would make me a lifelong fan.\n\nMillencolin\n\nI’ve never listed to a ton of the 90s-style skate punk. But Millencolin have been one of my favorites from day one. The first album I picked up of theirs was “For Monkeys”. Here was this Epitaph skate punk band, but they also had more melodies. I also felt they were poppier than everything else I had heard on the Punk-O-Rama comp (where I first heard them). But on top of all that, they also just had some killer guitars. They are also one of the few bands I feel have just gotten better with every album. While they don’t release albums all too often, they have consistently grown and sounded better each time they do.\n\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds\n\nWhile this is the least punk band on this list, there’s no denying that Nick Cave is fucking punk. I never really got into his older band The Birthday Party, but I love every single thing he’s done with the Bad Seeds. Again, growing up mostly in the mid-90s, one of my favorite movies was Scream. This is where I first took notice. Nick Cave was another name I had heard for a long time from others, but never paid attention to. Then I saw Scream (as well as picked up the soundtrack), and Red Right Hand just stood out. It was dark, haunting, and suave, and badass all in one. I love just listening to the stories he tells, and getting lost in all the amazing musical arrangements of his albums. Cave’s style has certainly changed and developed over the years on various records, but when you’re listening to one there’s no denying his signature voice and lyrical themes. It’s really hard for me to pin down an album as a favorite, as there are so many at the top. The first one I bought to dive into was “Murder Ballads”. I think “Push the Sky Away” is his most accomplished and rounded out album. There’s so much beauty in the instrumentation on that album as compared to the darker tones that contrast previous albums.\n\nKid You Not are playing The Fest.

Ever since May when the legendary UK punk band announced they were getting back together, not just for a reunion tour but to be a proper band again, I've been overcome with excitement. I'm a massive Lightyear fan and have been yearning for them to get together again since they got together for some shows at Slam Dunk 2015. When they announced the London show at The Garage I bought our tickets immediately and counted the days excitedly for what I was assuming would be one of the best gigs of the year. To give you an example of just how excited I was to see Lightyear again - I was more excited to see Lightyear than I was to see the Descendents for the first time earlier in the year. I was really really excited.\n\nBefore we got to Lightyear though we had three support acts to work our way through. First up were London's Eat The Evidence. Being a show in London on a Saturday, there was an unfortunate early start to the show which meant the crowd wasn't as big as it could have been for the five piece. But this didn't stop an excitable and energetic show from these ska punks. The majority of the crowd that had gathered seemed to really enjoy their sound. Something a bit different about Eat The Evidence is that they use an accordion on some of their songs, you don't see too many ska bands who do that - off the top of my head I can only think of the one. Eat The Evidence were so excited to be playing with Lightyear, they actually bought tickets for the show before they got booked on it. The highlights of their set for me were a song about the British Isles named Fruit Of The Loot which included a ukulele with a homemade-looking whistle attachment (DIY or die!), a longer song about old bands you were in named Delusions Of A Grunger and final song Tories Go To Waitrose. This was a fun way to start the show.\n\nNext to take to the Garage stage were a band named Unqualified Nurse Band who were from Derby. Having never even heard to this three piece before I was interested to see what they would be like. Unqualified Nurse Band played a kind of alternative punk rock music that felt kind of odd to be on this bill. I imagine that happens a lot to them because it was very difficult to pigeon hole them into any particular genre. Whatever the genre might have been, one thing I was sure of that this was a very talented band. With all three members of the band taking turns on lead vocals and the bass player and the guitarist swapping instruments at times, it was clear that these guys knew what they were doing and were definitely one of the more professional bands I've ever seen. I'm not used to seeing bands with such a musical proficiency! I did think it was a bit of a shame that the drummer was so difficult to see on stage because of the lights and smokiness of the room. You didn't really notice it was him singing until you saw that it wasn't either of the guitar players. He had a cracking voice.\n\nFollowing Unqualified Nurse Band were another band who had recently reformed to play some shows - Fire Apple Red. I'll be honest, I had absolutely no idea who Fire Apple Red were before they took the stage. Clearly I was in the minority as there were plenty of people around me who were screaming out every word with the band. It turns out Fire Apple Red are a five piece hardcore band who were formally signed to Good Clean Fun Records and Visible Noise. This was a set I really enjoyed, I love watching melodic hardcore live even if it's a genre I wouldn't naturally choose to listen to at home. The anger and the rawness of the music works so incredibly well in a live setting and the energy from the band spilled over into the crowd - everyone just had a wonderful time. The band were having the best time as well as some of the biggest grins I've seen from any band ever adorned their faces. It had been ten years since Fire Apple Red had played shows together so it must have felt so good to be together again. Great stuff.\n\nNow it was time for the moment the everyone in the, now packed out, Garage had been waiting for. Bloody Lightyear were about to take to the stage! A part of me thinks that I'm nowhere near good enough at doing words to really describe just how amazing it was and I just want to say \"It's Lightyear\" and leave it there but I'm going to give it a jolly good go.\n\nComing on stage after a recorded introduction stating that they'd had no hits and Ice T had once said they were \"okay\", the infamous seven piece from the golden age of UK punk took to the stage with Data's Double Chin. Iin true Lightyear fashion, Neil managed to break his trumpet within the first thirty seconds of the song and a piece of it when flying into the front of the crowd. Luckily the start of the song doesn't feature too much brass. From there on the Lightyear classics just kept on coming and coming. Lightyear are the kind of band where you sometimes forget just how many songs of theirs there are that you love until you get to see them all live. As much as I enjoy recorded Lightyear the band are truly at their best, and arguably better than anyone, when you get to experience them live. It wasn't long into their set when my all time favourite Lightyear song got a run out. Three Basics is a song about the importance of music in society and is just incredible live. There are so many incredible lyrics in this song that have me shouting back at the band with my fists held high. Everyone else's favourite Lightyear song, A Pack Of Dogs, didn't take long to follow. Taking everyone by surprise by its appearance in the middle of the set as it's usually the closing song. The stage began to fill with brass players from various bands, allegedly it was organised a few minutes before the set began but I'm not so sure - I don't think The Garage stocks so many brass instruments back stage. A Pack Of Dogs, of course, got the biggest reaction of the night with the floor becoming a huge skank pit singing along gleefully to Lightyear's love letter to the 1980s. After hearing my two favourite tracks it was now a bit of \"what are they going to play next?\" Classics including Twat Out Of Hell, Life Jacket Water Wings, Tread Lightly, Speaking Clearly, Nuff Cuts, Uri Gellar Bent My Heart, Whispering Ron vs Maz and Blindside all went down wonderfully with the crowd. Of course the morris dancing interlude during Blindside, as well as the pantomime horse, got huge cheers from everyone at the Garage. The old jokes remain the best. The main part of the set finished with Positive Outlook, another of my absolute favourites. It's a song about friendships that last forever so it was an apt choice given that one Lightyear are celebrating their 20th anniversary and two because they've been seeing so many old friends on this tour. During this song there was a bit of a switch up on the stage with the guitarist taking over drumming duty, the drummer taking lead vocal duties, Chas swapping places with the soundman who took to the stage to sing with the band. Fire Apple Red's bass player took over Bars' job so he could get to the front of the stage and do some singing himself. It was all a bunch of fun nonsense shenanigans that you would expect from Lightyear. If this main part of the show wasn't quite enough there was an encore which included one of the band's oldest songs Spot Check and lastly That's The Way It Goes, Big Nose which someone on the barrier had been shouting for most of the evening.\n\nOh and they also played a new song during their set. I'm so excited for some new material.\n\nLightyear were so so so so good. It's been a long time since I came out of a gig feeling such a high. For the whole journey home I was smiling like a lunatic and humming or whistling their songs. The fact that the band are back properly is the best piece of musical news we've had for years. You might worry that an older band coming back for more than just a reunion might tarnish their legendary reputation. That won't be further from the truth for Lightyear. I can't wait to see what they do next!\n\nThis gig review was written by Colin Clark.

Hateful Monday were one of the best new discoveries for me on that playlist so I was over the moon when the lovely Lauren Mills of Mills On Wheels PR sent me a copy of their brand new album to review. Titled Unfrightened, the eleven track album was released back in September (sorry, I'm slow) and promised to be an absolute cracker.\n\nUnfrightened begins with a song titled As Far As I Can Remember. From the outset I am in love with this song. Beginning with the lyrics \"As Far As I Can Remember, I've Always Been A Punk Rocker, As Long As It Keeps Me Alive, I Know Things Gonna Be Alright.\" Gosh I love those lyrics, I relate to them instantly. The song is about finding strength in punk rock music, something I'm sure we all do. Musically this is skate punk perfection. It's fast and hard hitting and bursting with melody. The song is packed with incredible lyrics with my favourite being \"Now That We're Older And Our Hairlines Start Receding, I'm Still Grateful For This Music That Gave My Life A True Meaning.\" \"I Always Have A Place To Go, Looking Forward To The Next Show\" is another pretty special lyric. After that incredible start we have the song Monuments To Mediocrity. Starting out with a great one-two punch of guitar and drums before lead singer Reverend Seb's fantastic vocals join the fun. The track is about not being held down and striving to be the best that you can possibly be. The song is a really uplifting number that will also fill you with a motivation that only punk rock can do. Igor Gonzola's drumming on the song is absolutely superb. The third song on the album is 9pm (At The Gas Station). This track is about your friends growing up and their priorities changing from going to gigs and parties to more \"grown up\" activities such as looking after your kids and getting that urgent email sent on time. It's about longing for those simpler times. The analogies used in the song are perfect for getting across the message in the track. Hateful Monday write some amazing lyrics.\n\nI loved the tempo and the punchy delivery on the fourth song, Dorian Gray Syndrome. The delivery in particular fills the song with an infectious energy that you can't ignore. It's another song that looks at the topic of growing up. In this case realising how much you've changed since you were a child. Stateless Society sees Hateful Monday's 90s skate punk influences really shine through. The sound of this song definitely feels like an ode to The Offspring. As you may have guessed Stateless Society is more of a political track rather than a song about growing up. The guitars at the start are heavy and really give the impression that Hateful Monday really mean business here. This is definitely an angry, fuck you kind of song. It's also a complete banger. After that anger we are treated with a slower and much sadder, perhaps to the point of mournful, song. It's called Not Forgotten and it's a song dedicated to fallen friends. The electric guitar is replaced by what sounds like a ukulele, on my first listen of Unfrightened this really took me by surprise but it quickly grew on me. Not Forgotten is a truly beautiful song. After this poignant moment, next up is the hilarious I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S (The Greatest Song Ever Written). This is a short forty-four second hardcore blast of a song that basically states all of the best bands have just have initials for names except for Bad Religion and, of course, Hateful Monday.\n\nThe eighth song on Unfrightened is called Heart & Pen. This song feels deeply personal but it reeks of positivity and is extremely uplifting. I guess that is sometimes the point of a personal song, to help inspire others. Heart & Pen is a midtempo song about finding the strength to write down all of the demons in your head and singing them out loud as a kind of cathartic therapy. The second verse in particular stood out lyrically - \"I Could Never Express My Emotions Very Well, The Torments In My Head That Made My Life A Living Hell, I'm Glad I've Had The Chance To Be Able To Write It Down, It Helped Me Stay Alive, I'm Proud I Did It On My Own.\" Life Events is about the trials and tribulations of living with mental health issues. There is a real douse of the Millencolin skate punk sound we all love. Hateful Monday don't just rip off the Swedish legends though, they take their sound and really make it their own. Igor Gonzola's drumming is again a highlight of the song, with the constant pounding really driving the song forward. Another highlight of Life Events was on the final verse when another singer, I'm assuming guitarist Jean-Rem, takes lead vocal duties before Reverend Seb repeats the verse. This creates a really interesting sound and keeps the listener hooked until the very end. The penultimate song on Unfrightened is named Nuclear Optimism (Is So 50's). The track starts off with quite the punk rock explosion, which is apt given the song is about the damage that nuclear power is causing the world. The shift in song structure is brilliant. From the explosive start to get people's attention to a more calm, melodic approach to try and educate within the song. The last song is La Purge which is an instrumental track to finish off Unfrightened.\n\nGosh I loved Unfrightened. There is a feeling of nostalgia about the album but it also feels fresh and current. The topics are relatable to the 30 year old punk rockers and do nothing but make you feel better about how your life is going. If this record doesn't make an appearance on my end of year top ten albums list then there have been ten perfect albums released between now and the end of the year.\n\nStream and download Unfrightened here: https://hatefulmonday.bandcamp.com/album/unfrightened\n\nLike Hateful Monday here: https://www.facebook.com/hatefulmonday/\n\nThis review was written by Colin Clark.\n\nGig Review: Reel Big Fish and Anti Flag at The Forum, Kentish Town 17/10/17\n\nThe Fireball Whiskey Fuelling The Fire tour was back in London last week for what I believe was the third year in a row. Each year Fireball Whiskey grab some of the biggest names in American ska and punk and team them with some up and comers from the UK punk scene. This year's featured Reel Big Fish, Anti Flag and The Mad Caddies teaming up with Fireball's hottest band of 2017, Sweet Little Machine, and a competition winner for each different night of the tour. London was lucky enough to have two shows, two nights in a row at The Forum in Kentish Town. Due to having an all-dayer at the New Cross Inn on the Sunday, Emma and I decided it would be smarter to go to the second London date on the Tuesday Night.\n\nOpening up the night were competition winners The Bottom Line and then Sweet Little Machine. The Bottom Line played high energy pop punk that ticked all of the pop punk boxes. There was hand clapping, in sync jumping and plenty of whoa-ohs. The highlight of the set for me was their cover of the Wheatus classic Teenage Dirtbag. I'd previously seen Sweet Little Machine supporting Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and Masked Intruder back in February and was impressed by their pop rock sound. Now they've released their debut full length album Monsters and played a bunch of songs from it. Sweet Little Machine are clearly a very polished band who seem born to play at big club shows. I can't actually imagine them playing in the backroom of a pub. Frontman Alex is a born showman and expertly owns the stage and, at times, the floor. I feel like it won't be long before Sweet Little Machine are household names.\n\nCalifornia band The Mad Caddies have a long time been favourites of mine and, after seeing them at Slam Dunk festival earlier in the year, Emma was now firmly on board the Caddies ship too. The Mad Caddies are now in their 22nd year as a band and probably sound better than ever. Their unique mix of punk, ska, reggae and polka immediately gets the London crowd moving, whether it's skanking, moshing or simply just tapping your toes. It's impossible to remain still when the Caddies are on stage. The Caddies set had a good mix of the band's slow and fast songs. The slower songs included Lay Your Head Down, Brand New Scar, Souls For Sale and Shoot Out The Lights, while the fast ones included Leavin', Contraband, No Hope and of course, the silliest of songs, Monkeys. Monkeys is one that really gets the crowd moving. I always think that the Mad Caddies are of the most underrated bands of their era, often overlooked when people talk about the best bands from that era of punk and ska. That's a shame because they are always incredible when they play live and they have a back catalogue of music of such quality that most bands should be jealous of. I mean they didn't even play two of their most popular songs tonight (Drinking For 11 and Road Rash) and not a single person seemed disappointed. The Mad Caddies could have easily headlined this tour themselves and are complete legends. Hopefully they'll be back in the UK soon for their own headline tour.\n\nPittsburgh punk rockers Anti Flag seemed like a strange choice to be sandwiched between ska punk juggernauts The Mad Caddies and Reel Big Fish but for some reason it worked wonderfully. I think this was because Anti Flag are simply an incredible live punk band. Taking to the stage and launching into one of their biggest hits, This Is The End (For You My Friend), gets the Kentish Town Forum crowd going crazy immediately. Bass player and co-lead vocalist Chris #2 is like a man possessed as he bounds around the stage between screaming out the words. In the few times that it's possible to take your eyes off of him you see guitarist and other co-lead vocalist Justin Sane dancing around the stage with a similar intensity. Anti Flag have always been a band that spread their political message through their music and they waste no time getting to the hard stuff with the classic Fuck Police Brutality. Anti Flag really are a band that pull no punches with their lyrical content. It's not long before Chris #2 has the crowd screaming the chorus back to the band. A particular highlight for me, and perhaps many others, was when they played Turncoat. A song that first got me, and probably a lot of other people, into the band. Another highlight was when the band played new tune When The Wall Falls which is actually a ska punk song. I never thought Anti Flag would write a ska song. There was a nice moment where the Reel Big Fish horn section took to the stage to add some brass to the track. Other highlights in the set included The Press Corpse, 1 Trillion Dollar$, their cover of Should I Stay Or Should I Go, Die For The Government and set closer Brandenburg Gate. During Brandenburg Gate, Chris #2 and drummer Pat Thetic climbed into the crowd, complete with instruments and microphone to complete the set in some style. It created a fantastic image of solidarity between the band and the crowd. Like I said earlier and like you probably were already aware, Anti Flag are a political band. At times using their set to talk about all the bad things that are happening in the world at the moment and about fighting back. I liked how it never felt preachy - nobody likes to be preached at - it's just inspiring. Justin Sane made a fantastic point by saying that despite all of the atrocities in the world he feels like the people fighting back are winning because of all the positive changes that have happened within society over the past twenty years. I hadn't seen Anti Flag in about five years before tonight and they were well worth the wait. One of my favourite sets of the year.\n\nFinally it was time for ska punk legends from the 90s - Reel Big Fish! I'd wager that everyone at The Forum has probably seen Reel Big Fish at some point over the years and knows all of the antics the band get up to on stage. I'd also wager that despite knowing the antics, they all loved it just as much or maybe even more than the first time they saw it. Reel Big Fish have been doing the same thing for years and years but fans always flood to go and see them live again and again. Why? Because they are so so bloody good at what they do! Coming on stage to the sounds of Olé before launching into the classic Everything Sucks, the floor at The Forum becomes one huge skank pit with the room dancing along and singing with glee. Having not released a new album since 2012s Candy Coated Fury this was truly a best of set with favourites spanning the band's whole 25 year career and of course the odd cover thrown in for good measure. Led by singer, guitarist and all around entertainer Aaron Barrett, the band go through classic after classic with each song seemingly getting a bigger reactions than the last. Everyone Else Is An Asshole had a huge sing-along followed up by Trendy which just sent the crowd into a wild frenzy. Drinkin' is a song they don't seem to play that often but was obviously a perfect for this Fireball Tour. Your Guts (I Hate You) is just a perfect song to give everyone a bit of a rest and just have a big old smiley sing song. It's actually quite an angry song but you can't help but smile when you hear it. After a brilliant cover of Brown Eyed Girl there was a lovely surprise when Laila from UK ska punk band Sonic Boom Six came out to help the band with the female part of She Has A Girlfriend Now. Ever the show-woman Laila potentially upstaged Barrett during the song with an extremely polished performance of the song. After another extremely happy but impossible not to smile song in the form of Another F.U. Song it was time for the hits. Like at Slam Dunk back in May, the band teased the crowd by playing parts of famous 90s tracks Smells Like Teen Spirit, My Own Worst Enemy, 500 Miles and The Impression That I Get before eventually going into their own song Sell Out. Probably the song that got the biggest reaction of the entire night. Following this up with crowd favourite Toots & The Maytals cover Monkey Man and finishing the main set with Beer was perfect. The fun wasn't finished there though. It wasn't long before Barrett and then eventually the rest of the band returned to the stage for what's probably my favourite Reel Big Fish song, Where Have You Been. Then we did get what I thought was the biggest surprise of the night was when the band started the many versions of S.R. This was surprising given that they'd already played the long version of the 90s songs and we were into the encore. Who plays a 10 minute long song in the encore? Reel Big Fish, that's who. Finally it was time for the show to actually finish but not before one last cover, probably the band's most well known track, Take On Me. What a great way to finish the night.\n\nThis was a great night of punk and ska music. All for the incredibly cheap price of £12.50 (the ticket price was actually £10 but then booking fees). There was a great sense of nostalgia around the night with three classic bands that I grew listening to. Seeing them all play together was just a 2002 dream come true.\n\nThis gig review was written by Colin Clark. Photos taken by Emma Prew.\n\nGig Review: The Bombpops at New Cross Inn 15/10/17\n\nWhat's the best cure for feeling incredibly rough, full of cold, a banging headache, a sore throat and very little sleep? A punk all-dayer at the New Cross Inn is probably not the most obvious answer but it's the approach I went for. Fat Wreck Chords' The Bombpops were in South London as part of their European tour, so Be Sharp Promotions and Umlaut Records put on an all day show featuring another stacked line up – as a punk all-dayer at the New Cross always does.\n\nWayfairer was the first act of the day. This was my third time seeing Wayfairer this year and this was arguably the best I've seen him. As he played his acoustic punk tunes I found myself completely captivated by his songs. There is a fantastic storytelling element to his music that really works so well in a live setting. Playing songs from his two excellent EPs, Drifting and Losing My Cool, as well as a customary Alkaline Trio cover to finish things off. Wayfairer is always a great way to start the day.\n\nNext up was Second In Line. I'll avoid the obvious joke about the second band on being named Second In Line, mostly because it's probably been made before and I'm probably the only person who finds it funny. Second In Line are a four piece from the Thames Valley area who have been around on and off since 2002. After the nice acoustics of Wayfairer, Second In Line really woke the New Cross up with their fast, gruff and grumbly punk rock tunes. They are clearly a band who don't take themselves too seriously judging by their song topics. The majority of the songs they played were about pop culture such as Saved By The Bell, Back To The Future, Golden Girls and one song named John Candy Is Dead where singer Gareth reeled off a list of dead celebrities. The final song was my favourite though, I'm not sure of its name but the chorus of \"Raise A Beer For Me, Crack A Smile For Me\" really put a smile on my face.\n\nOn A Hiding To Nothing are definitely one of mine and Emma's favourite new discoveries of 2017. Like Wayfairer this was our third time seeing them this year and again this was probably the best. This show at the New Cross was also the final date of their five date tour of the UK. This may have been why they felt so tight, they were in tour shape. Having seen them three times since May it was great to finally be able to really get the songs and be like \"yeah, I know this one.\" Their incredibly fast skate punk is just a joy to watch live and it's clear that the band love what they do. Something I really love about On A Hiding To Nothing's music is how fresh it feels. There are plenty of bands who play fast skate punk but On A Hiding To Nothing make the genre feel like their own with lead singer Ali's distinctive vocals backed excellently by Hassan and Jack. If you've not seen On A Hiding To Nothing Live you must soon, if nothing else to watch bass player Jack's high energy high kicks. It was good to see him making sure he stretched properly before the set too!\n\nNext up were a band that are very important to the history of Colin's Punk Rock World. I won't go into the story again but without Müg it's fair to say that this blog probably wouldn't exist and I'd have much more spare time. Having said that you may be surprised that I've actually only seen Müg play live once, way back in 2013 supporting Elway at the Black Heart in Camden. That night the band played an excellent cover of Lily Allen's Not Fair (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong). I was telling this story to Müg guitarist Mark Bell before their New Cross set and he told me that that was probably the only time they ever played that song to a crowd, so I guess I got very lucky on that night. I've also just discovered what that Lily Allen song is actually about - gosh it's rude!\n\nAnyway, Müg. They were bloody great! Starting out with what is actually my favourite song of theirs, World Of Weirdos, their half an hour set went by far too quickly. It's always lovely to see a band who love what they're doing and enjoy having fun on stage together. It's easy to see the band are all great mates and not just people in a band together. This really helps create an excellent chemistry on the stage. Müg are another band who have taken the skate punk sound and found a way to make it sound distinctly their own. Lead singer Kingly's vocals soar brilliantly and he delivers with every single word. They played a selection of Müg favourites, a brand new song that isn't properly finished yet as well as throwing in covers of NOFX's It's My Job To Keep Punk Rock Elite and Lagwagon's Mr Coffee for good measure. It's a small crime that I went so long without seeing Müg live. They're a great band who do wonderful things for the punk scene in the UK via Umlaut Records.\n\nUp next were in my opinion London's best band - The Burnt Tapes. I feel like I'm not alone in that opinion as while The Burnt Tapes were sound checking, Paul of Be Sharp Promotions came up and shouted in my ear \"I fucking love these guys.\" The man is definitely not alone in those sentiments. The regret punk four piece are easily having the most successful year of their musical careers so far and are picking up new fans wherever they play. After their set finished we popped out for some food and I overheard a couple saying how much they enjoyed the band having never listened to them before. Whenever I write about The Burnt Tapes I feel like I gush a little too much about my love of the band so I will just stick with this was another brilliant set from the band. (Despite Pan breaking a guitar string early on - thank goodness Mark Bell was, as ever, on hand to act as guitar tech.) I've seen the band more than any other this year so I'm pretty used to their set by now so it was a lovely surprise to hear a new song that the band have been working on thrown into the mix. Their last EP was only released in June so I thought it was great to hear the band are still pressing on working on new stuff rather than resting on their laurels. The Burnt Tapes are the best. (Sorry, I gushed a little bit.)\n\nWe managed to get back from getting a bite to eat just in time to catch the beginning of Dowzer's set. The four piece pop punk band from the Netherlands are Umlaut's latest addition to an incredible roster of talent and have just put out the band's newest album, So Much For Silver Linings. Despite some technical difficulties, the Dutch quartet played a fast paced set of great pop punk tunes. The use of two lead vocalists is something I always enjoy when I listen to bands, it gives that great feeling of being included. Everyone likes to feel included. It's also always good to see band members with big smiles on their faces - at times bass player Sandra Heeren looked like she was close to laughter as they ploughed through their set. Unfortunately due to the technical difficulties the set had to be cut short but I have to say the last song of the set was my favourite. I think it was called Broken Record but I may be wrong.\n\nRecently reformed pop punk band The Famous Class were on next. The four piece (who are potentially the tallest band I've ever seen) are a pop punk band who I'd previously seen supporting the Mad Caddies in Islington years ago. Now they're back with two new members basically because front man Stu saw Goober Patrol play the New Cross Inn stage and fancied a bit of it for himself. Judging from their set there was no performance rust as they played song after song and put in one hell of a performance. It was quite pleasing to hear they they've also been working on new songs so this isn't a one and done kind of deal - The Famous Class are back for good, for now. The real crowd pleasing moment was for their cover of Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up, joking that they did it way before the Foo Fighters ever did. There was a nice surprise towards the end of their set when a confetti bomb was let off and covered the crowd. It's cheesy but those things always create an awesome sight.\n\nAdding something a bit different to the day's line up were Manchester's Dead Neck. The three piece play technical hardcore punk rock music opposed to the more pop punk sound that had dominated the much of the day. This was also the first time the band have played with this particular line up, with a new drummer joining singer and bassist Andy and guitarist Dan. Dead Neck are always a treat to watch live with their high octane songs sounding even better live than they do recorded. The crowd adored them with two folks in particular, who were obviously big fans and mostly there to see Dead Neck, really giving it some on the dance floor in front of the band. Midway through their set they played arguably their most well known song - the awesome Oriental I. Before starting the song Andy humorously said \"if you know the words to this song, then good for you\" rather than the usual \"sing along if you know the words.\" This got a chuckle from me. He used the same line for their cover of NOFX's It's My Job To Keep Punk Rock Elite. I found this funny not just because I found the joke funny the first time but also because they were the second band of the day to cover the classic track. I'm very easily amused. Dead Neck finished their set with a hugely positive song named Cooking With Nunchucks, a song about trying things that you think are impossible - you never know, it might work put. Dead Neck were absolutely great and are a band I need to listen to much much more.\n\nFinally it was time for The Bombpops. After quickly changing the amps and drum kit, with a little help from the Burnt Tapes' Tone (possibly the nicest guy in punk rock) the band were ready. Playing sugary sweet pop punk similar in style to bands such as Masked Intruder and Bad Cop Bad Cop, the band have been on a long European tour and were playing London for the first time. It's quite a big deal for New Cross to be putting them on. Something that always strikes me seeing these types of bands live is how much harder they play and sing than they do when recorded. This extra attitude really adds an element to the sound that makes me enjoy them even more. Co-front women Poli van Dam and Jen Razavi own the stage taking turns in singing and both completely slaying on their guitars. Poli in particular really stood out, having a great amount of charisma on the stage that made it hard to ignore her. At one point she began blowing kisses to a \"cute boy\" who was looking in to the New Cross Inn from the outside. As seems to be the rule with Fat Wreck Chords bands, there was plenty of stage banter between songs with the band covering topics of it being more acceptable to use the c word in the UK than back home, how much they enjoy cider and their own Californian accents. There was also a tribute to the late great Brandon Carlisle who wrote The Bombpops a song. As I watched the band and the day afterwards, I thought about what an inspirational band The Bombpops are. Sadly there are not enough women in punk rock at the moment so to see The Bombpops making a name for themselves not just in America but in Europe as well is fantastic. They are proof to anyone that you shouldn't let a thing like gender hold you back from what you want to do. Sadly we had to duck out of the gig a couple of songs before the end, as I was feeling increasingly rougher and we had a long journey home to Bedford but we did hang around long enough to see a great cover of The Beastie Boys - You Gotta Fight For Your Right To Party. A fantastic way to finish another great day of punk rock at the New Cross Inn.\n\nThis gig review was written by Colin Clark. Photos taken by Emma Prew.\n\nTop Tens: Mark from Our Lives In Cinema's Top Ten Punk Rock Influences\n\n1) Rocket From The Crypt\n\nRFTC are without a shadow of a doubt the best band the world has ever known. It’s not a subjective thing either; it’s cold, hard fact and can be proved with science. My first exposure to them was through both Kerrang and the NME. Kerrang’s review of ‘Scream, Dracula, Scream!’ went so far as to tell the reader to steal the record if necessary... 12 year old me thought that was as cool as it gets. The NME featured ‘Born In ’69’ on a free cassette and it was every bit as badass as I’d imagined. John Reis/Speedo is a songwriting genius. I’d say ‘Pigeon Eater’... a B SIDE, is their greatest moment. Probably the greatest 3 minutes of sound ever recorded.\n\n2) Jeff Rosenstock\n\nJeff and ‘Bomb The Music Industry!’ are the reason I wanted to start playing music again after a five year break. I wasn’t even remotely aware of his existence until hearing ‘Hey Allison’ from 2016’s ‘We Cool?’ on some random Spotify playlist. I think he’s likely the genre’s best songwriter and he’s been crazy prolific. It’s been so fun wading through such a varied and consistently excellent back catalogue of music. His most recent album ‘Worry’ is the best record he’s put together so far and it has the perfect mix of lyrical excellence, poppy hooks and crazily awesome punk music executed by a dude with admirable ethics and limitless passion. My favourite song of his is ‘Stuff That I Like’ from ‘Scrambles’.\n\n3) At The Drive In\n\nThe best thing to come from me loving Korn and Slipknot so much as an edgy teen was my devotion to producer Ross Robinson and I eagerly anticipated ‘Relationship Of Command’ because of his involvement. I remember seeing ATDI smash their way through ‘One Armed Scissor’ on ‘Later: With Jools Holland’ with a completely confused Robbie Williams watching from the audience. It was pretty much the most exciting performance of anything I’d ever seen up until that point.\n\n4) The Blood Brothers\n\nSuch a ridiculously talented, genre-defying band. Insane and imaginative music, incredibly vivid, allegorically poetic lyrics, two perfectly paired frontmen with utterly unique voices. For me, when I think of punk I think of The Blood Brothers. They have a bunch of amazing records but the Ross Robinson produced ‘Burn Piano Island Burn’ is the best place to start.\n\n5) Nirvana\n\nNirvana were the first band I ever loved that wasn’t part of my dad’s record collection. When I first started getting into rock music it was just after Kurt’s death. At school we’d all swap tapes of what we thought ‘cool’ music was. I got tapes of Guns & Roses, Green Day, Metallica, The Sex Pistols, Pearl Jam... and ‘Nevermind’. It’s just wall to wall bangers from start to finish. It’s not a popular opinion but I rate ‘Bleach’ ahead of ‘In Utero’ too. If there’s ONE band I wish I could’ve seen live it’s them.\n\n6) Coheed & Cambria\n\nDuring my years working for HMV I found two bands by randomly playing stuff in store that had a massive impact on my life. ‘In Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth: 3’ was a revelation. As somebody who is allergic to most things labelled prog-rock, I was staggered at just how much melody and triumphant chorus Claudio was able to pack into all of his songs, even within the context of a sci-fi concept record. For me, even though I don’t relate to them lyrically as such... Coheed’s first 3 albums are untouchable.\n\n7) The Hold Steady\n\nThis was my second life changing band discovered at HMV. I found the cover art to ‘Boys And Girls In America’ really appealing for some reason. I think Craig Finn is a genius lyricist and I try to learn as much from him as I can. He’s such a great storyteller and live performer and he has an ability to convey so much wit, warmth, sadness, romance and nostalgia in his songs. Live, as someone who’s closer to my own age than say Joyce Manor, he made me feel like I could still credibly be in a rock band. He’s very unabashedly himself and enthusiastic as a live presence.\n\n8) The Beatles\n\nBands that I dislike that people I have known have been annoyed at me for hating: The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath. Yet somehow I seem to continually run into people who claim to hate The Beatles. They are liars. They did more in 7 years than most bands have managed in 20. ‘Abbey Road’ is clearly their best record.\n\n9) U2\n\nOk ok ok I get it. Everybody hates Bono. I hate Bono too. He’s a smug, self appointed messiah figure. And nobody should be called ‘The edge’. However...\n\n1. They’re not Coldplay.\n\n2. They had massive tunes in the 80s.\n\n3. For their first 3 albums they were sort of punk but not really.\n\n4. Don’t pretend you don’t like all the singles from ‘The Joshua Tree’.\n\n5. It’s actually my Dad’s fault.\n\n6. I’ll defend ‘Achtung Baby’ until the day I die. That is a SEXY album full of gigantic tunes.\n\n10) Weezer\n\nLike most Weezer fans, my relationship with their music is reasonably complicated and I feel pretty psychologically abused by them at this point. Listening to ‘Pinkerton’ as an adult after giving it some distance is weird. The lyrics are pretty creepy and cringe worthy but maybe that’s the point? The ‘Green Album’ is my favourite, I just love how simplistic and timeless it is. I think we can all do without almost everything from ‘Make Believe’ to ‘Hurley’. ‘The White Album’ was a real return to form I thought, but the last 3 singles are up their with the worst crap they’ve ever put out. You never know where where you stand with Rivers Cuomo.\n\nStream and download Our Lives In Cinema here: https://ourlivesincinema.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nLike Our Lives In Cinema here: https://www.facebook.com/Ourlivesincinema/\n\nAlbum Review: Cities In Search Of A Heart by The Movielife (by Richard Mair)\n\n14 years after their last album, influential pop-punkers The Movielife return with their 4th full length. After calling it quits after the release of the excellent \"40 Hour Train Back To Penn\" the band's stock has continued to rise whilst many of their peers (Saves the Day, Alkaline Trio, New Found Glory to name a few), have seen their returns diminish and increasingly sketchy outputs tarnish their once great reputations. Having a small and consistently excellent back catalogue has enabled the band to cement their status as legends; whilst their releases (with the exception of \"It's Go Time\" to be fair - which sounds far too light weight and underproduced by comparison), have stood the test of time well. There is obviously a lot riding on this release to not only manage expectations of those old fans, but also to draw new listeners in - moving them from a nostalgia act to one that's relevant for a newer audience, who may not be as aware of their legacy or importance to the pop-punk scene. So how does 2017 Movielife compare to that of yesteryear?\n\n... The answer is surprisingly well. Sure it's not as bratty and pop-hardcore in the vein of \"This Time Next Year\", nor is it as defiant and damaged as \"40 Hour Train Back To Penn\", but shows a maturity and self-awareness that can only come with age and with time away from each other - notably driving forces, vocalist Vinnie Caruana and guitarist Brandon Reilly. What they have crafted here is a natural progression built on their separate growths and careers, but retaining that original Movielife magic.\n\nThe obvious difference lies in the vocals. I've always loved the rapid, shouty rasp of Vinnie Caruana, and here it's been toned down slightly. The most obviously traditional Movielife song with this regards is opener \"Ski Mask\", which catapults the album to a breakneck speed immediately; with this regard it's very reminiscent of \"I Hope You Die Soon\"; albeit of a slightly longer run time (clocking over 1:30)! It's clearly a nod to the old times and an explosive start to the album, followed by a song that will be seen as an anthem over coming years \"Mercy Is Asleep At The Wheel\"; its heavy opening and verses are very post-hardcore in style before it shifts into a huge chorus. Again reminding the listener of their hardcore roots; personally I see this as a joining of their pop-punk drive-thru era sound combined with the more hardcore stylings of their Revelation releases and it's probably the most realistic interpretation of who The Movielife actually are.\n\nI always found them out of place as a Drive-Thru band, and despite my love for \"40 Hour Train...\" and \"Gambling Problem\" I always get the impression that maybe there was some outside influence to push the more pop elements of the songs at the expense of their hardcore leanings; where as \"Cities in Search of a Heart\" seems much more in keeping with earlier releases. Take \"Sister Saint Monica\" for example which is much more driven by hardcore beats and subtle beat downs, whilst still retaining their melodic elements; these more hardcore leanings seem to be more noticeable this time around.\n\nThe obvious outlier on the album is \"Pour Two Glasses\", it's acoustic, orchestral approach drawing obvious parallels with \"Sailor Tattoos\". It's a nice interlude in the middle of the album, and instead of breaking the flow as can often happen with such songs, acts as a good change of pace and helps balance the first half of the album.\n\nLyrically, \"Cities In Search Of A Heart\", draws on many of the themes the Movielife are known for, in particular the need to find a place to belong or being away from home. Given the band's history and the infamous van accident that placed so much stress on the members relationships prior to their initial split, it's no surprise some nods throughout the album evoke an element of closure to that sad episode - particularly \"Mercy\".\n\nIt should also be noted that Vinnie has also always had a self-awareness of how one person's actions can impact on those around them and whereas the rose tinted nostalgia that filled songs like \"Hey\" have been replaced by an acknowledgement of his own failings in \"Ghosts In The Photograph\". It's a really honest juxtaposition that is evident across this new album; it suggests a further realisation on how you can damage others through your actions. It's an album littered with guilt and remorse but also with The Movielife you get a commitment to put things right and also to take responsibility for your actions.\n\nClosing song \"Hearts\" is a genuine slow-burner, driven by Vinnie's vocal delivery and shows a vulnerable humanity and a feeling of space and isolation. If the album starts with the most Movielife song it ends far removed from their past as they can go. That's not a bad thing again reinforcing their growth as musicians and people over the intervening 14 years. In between there are other highlights, particularly \"Laugh Ourselves To Death\" with its building and soaring chorus and the full-on \"You're The Cure\".\n\nIf I was to list the bands that have been important to me over the years, The Movielife would definitely feature. Their lyrics have always been especially relatable; I've known some \"Handgrenades\"; I can fully comprehend \"10 Seconds Too Late\"; and \"Kelly's Song\" could easily refer to my relationships. This album will be no different. If I compared their early output to Saves The Day, New Found Glory and Alkaline Trio when trying to manage expectations for this latest release I'd argue it's reminded me more of later Make Do and Mend or even Bayside; it's mature, grown-up and reflective. Sure, overall it's slower and more measured, but whilst their previous efforts helped define my early twenties this is exactly what I want from Vinnie and the boys in my mid thirties.\n\nOrder Cities In Search Of A Heart here.\n\nLike The Movielife here: https://www.facebook.com/themovielifeofficial/\n\nThis review was written by Richard Mair."
