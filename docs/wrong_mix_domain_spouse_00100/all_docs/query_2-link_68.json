        "text": "On July 24, 2019 the world lost an extraordinary woman, Sandra Jane Donoho Crawford. Born on February 3, 1936 in Frankfort Indiana to the late Robert Floyd and Thelma Lucille “Lucy” (Quinn) Donoho. She was a graduate of Frankfort High School in 1953 and went on to Purdue University where she was a member of Delta Gamma Sorority, and was active on the campus in the Gold Peppers, Pan-Hellenic council, Association of Women Students, mock politician convention, WRH (Women’s Residence Hall) Governing board and YWCA, graduating in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. Following graduation, she was awarded a scholarship from Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, for study and training in their pilot Cytology Technician program, where upon completion she became the 14th Registered Cytotechnologist in the nation.\n\nJune 25th, 1960, she married John William Crawford and together they raised two children, Diana and David, as well as nurturing many others. She was a mother, counselor and confidant to many of all ages, bettering lives with her everyday acts of kindness and compassion. Her home was always open, no matter the hour, and there was always room at the table. She was able to pack more into one day than seemed humanly possible and still, graciously find time for others, making them feel loved and valued. She was a tireless volunteer, dedicating many hours to her children’s schools, her local community and organizations. In 1960, she was a Charter member of the Epsilon Sigma Chapter of Tri Kappa, serving as President 1962-63 and several other offices. She was a dedicated Scouter, leading her daughter Diana’s troops through Girl Scouting and son David’s Cub Scout and Webelo packs and continued to nudge him all the way to Eagle Scout.\n\nSandra was a woman of great faith and humility with a heart to serve her Lord and fellow man. She lived her faith daily, in acts great and small, demonstrating the change she wished for the world. Her dedication to and impact on the church was incalculable. She was a founding member of John Knox Presbyterian Church in Speedway Indiana in 1962. She was an ordained Elder and held positions on the Session as well as numerous committees: Ministry, Nominating, Mission and Outreach, Fellowship, Christian Education, Building, Pastoral Search and others. She was a Sunday School and Vacation Bible School teacher for over twenty years. During her children’s High School years, she and John chaperoned a youth mission trip to rebuild the church in Kayenta Arizona. In later years they worked on Habitat for Humanity homes in the Indianapolis area. Beyond her own church, she served in leadership roles and was a member of virtually every committee in Whitewater Valley Presbytery. She was the Moderator of Synod of Lincoln Trails Synod School Committee and taught classes at Synod School Camp several summers. In 1987, she served as Moderator of Whitewater Valley Presbytery. She was Moderator of General Assembly Nominating Committee and served on the committee itself from 1992-1997. Additionally, she was Commissioner to the Presbyterian Church’s General Assembly, twice attending the National gathering.\n\nSandra was a devoted gardener and steward of the earth who loved and tended to all of God’s creatures, great and small. She enjoyed tole painting and was an enthusiastic quilter who hosted the weekly “Quilties” bee for over 15 years stitching love into numerous charity quilts.\n\nShe is survived by John, her husband of 59 years, her two children, Diana Crawford Kategiannis (Indianapolis, IN), and Dr. David Lee Crawford (Peoria, IL); five grandchildren, Christiana Grace Kategiannis, Katrina Lucille Crawford, Roxanne Giselle Crawford, Adam Emmanuel Kategiannis and Ginger Rosemary Crawford to carry on her legacy of faith, love, service and everyday excellence.\n\nA private, graveside service was held Saturday, July 27, 2019 at Calvary Cemetery.\n\nSandra’s family would like to invite all she knew, served and loved to join them at 3:00 pm on Saturday, August 10th to celebrate God’s love throughout her extraordinary life. The service will take place at John Knox Presbyterian Church, 3000 N. High School Rd., Speedway, Indiana.\n\nMemorial contributions can be made in her name to John Knox Presbyterian Church or to your favorite place of worship to further God’s work here on earth."
