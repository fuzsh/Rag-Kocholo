        "text": "A David W Cherry [C1a8c1p3], son of David Cherry and Nancy ____, was born in 1824 in Hardin Co TN. He married Ann Eliza Malone in Winston Co MS on 18 August 1848. She was born in TN in 1832. They lived in Winston Co in 1850, where his parents had moved soon before. David was dead by 1870 and Ann then lived in Kemper Co MS. Her son Isaac was then working on the next door neighbor's farm. David and Ann had five children, the last four in MS-\n\na. Isaac F Cherry, b 1849\n\nb. Nannie Cherry, b 1855\n\nc. Emma Cherry, b 1856\n\nd. David Cherry, b 1861\n\ne. George Cherry, b 1865 (W,9jk,73mn,360r)\n\nA J Cherry [unknown], married Rachael A McCauly in Haywood Co TN on 17 December 1861. He apparently died by 1867 (in the Civil War?), because she married D D Mays on 5 February 1867 in Haywood Co. Rachel was born about 1843. (29m)\n\nAaron Cherry [C1a2f], son of John Cherry III and Sarah Spring (Aaron was a son of Samuel Maund Cherry and Frances Ballentine, per Thigpen), was born in 1717 in Norfolk Co VA. He lived in Bertie Co NC in 1755, 1757, and 1769 since he was on the county tax lists then. Aaron married Mary Pierce. If she was the mother of his children, she must have been born by the early 1720s. Aaron died without a will. After his death, his widow Mary married James Warren in Bertie Co on 21 June 1788 (see Bethia Cherry [C1a3c]). James later provided the bond for the marriage of his step-son Thomas Cherry and Thomas' second wife Rachel Outlaw. Aaron had the following children (order probably incorrect)-\n\n1. Theophilus Cherry, b late 1730s?\n\n2. Erastus Cherry, b abt 1745\n\n3. Sarah Cherry, b bef 1750\n\n4. Rebecca Cherry, b bef 1750\n\n5. Frances Cherry, b bef 1750\n\n6. Robert Cherry, b 1749\n\n7. George Cherry, b bef 1750\n\n8. Solomon Cherry, b abt 1750\n\n9. Thomas Cherry, b abt 1755\n\n10. John Cherry?, was a witness to possible brother Robert Cherry's 1809 Edgecombe Co will. Robert had a son named John who received an inheritance in the will, so shouldn't have been a witness to the same will. Perhaps witness John Cherry was a brother of Robert. (95,JY)\n\n11. William Cherry (was named as an uncle to Solomon's son William Walton Cherry (source 93). William was graduated from the University of NC in 1800 in a class of three, was a trustee of the university from 1804 to 1809, and had a brilliant career as an attorney until his early death at the age of 27. Therefore his birth date was after 1782. Could he be the William Cherry who married Peggy Baker in Bertie Co on 13 November 1801?) There was no William Cherry in Bertie Co in 1810. (57,93,C,WD,6meht)\n\nAaron Cherry [C1a3f2a], son of Thomas Robert Cherry and Sarah Rhodes, was born in 1760 in Bertie Co NC. Aaron was living in Bertie Co in 1781 since he was on the county tax roster then, and was still there in most of the 1790s (a son was born there). Aaron moved to Edgecombe Co near the end of the 1790s. He was in Edgecombe Co in 1800 through 1830. In 1830 he was living close to Charles Wilkinson and Lunsford R Cherry, had ten slaves, and was apparently married, with no children in his household. Aaron married in the early 1790s. He left a will in Edgecombe Co dated 16 January 1835 (Book F, page 182). In it he named his wife Elizabeth and children. Aaron died in Edgecombe Co on 1 October 1835 and his estate was in probate the following month. His executors were Charles W Knight and Jesse C Knight. Aaron gave to his son Lunsford R Cherry a Negro Elisha after Aaron's wife's death, to son Lewis K Cherry he gave the \"land and plantation whereon I at present reside\" after wife Elizabeth dies, and a Negro boy named Ben, and to daughter Sarah R Jones \"my Negro woman Hatty & her increase, and my Negro girl Milly & her increase after the death of my beloved wife Elizabeth Cherry.\" Aaron named his \"worthy friends\" Charles W Knight and Jesse C Knight to be the executors.\n\nAaron married Elizabeth Holmes Knight on 22 July 1798. She was born 3 March 1773 and died on 14 January 1841, daughter of John Joshua Knight and Ann Lucretia Cherry [unknown] (per 77 & PA), or was a daughter of John Knight and Elizabeth Stokes (per 151). James Knight, in his 20 July 1844 will, made a gift to the \"2 eldest sons of Linsford R Cherry.\" William R Cherry acted as security. Elizabeth's will (Book F, page 250), dated 12 March 1840, was probated in February 1841 in Edgecombe Co. She left all property to her daughter Sallie, and a legacy of $1,000 to the heirs of son Lewis. In 1840 she was not the head of her household, so must have been living with one of her children. Elizabeth's obituary was also noted in the January 16 edition of the Tarboro Press. Aaron had two sons under the age of 10 by 1800 (and 15 slaves). He and Elizabeth had three children-\n\n1. Lunsford Rhodes Cherry, b 22 Jul 1798\n\n2. Lewis Knight Cherry, b 21 October 1799\n\n3. Sarah Rhodes Cherry, b 30 Jul 1802\n\nOn 26 Jan 1846 Nancy Ward, Lydia Austin, Joseph John Porter, Nancy Porter, Joseph John Pippin, James Knight, John Knight, Celia L Staton, Jesse C Knight, Lunsford R Cherry, and Sally R Jones sold their interest in the estate of William W Knight deceased to Charles W Knight (Edgecombe Co deed book 24, page 223). All names here mentioned concerning the estate sale must have been heirs to the late William W Knight. Since Lunsford's wife Elizabeth Knight had died in 1841, before her father's estate was settled, Lunsford inherited his wife's inheritance, and then sold it to a brother-in-law in 1846. Not all of the sellers were children of William W Knight; some must have been grandchildren, or children-in-law as was the case with Lunsford.\n\nJohn Knight of Susex Co left a will dated 23 Jul 1786, which was in probate on 3 Feb 1791. In it he named nine children: Isaac Knight (born 1757); Lucretia Cherry Knight (1760-1826, married Joseph John Pippin); Walker Knight (1762-1833); Lewis Knight (1763, married Mrs Edith _____ Foster in 1797, and married Rebecca Vaughan in 1805); Francis Epps Knight (1766-1808, lived Edgecombe Co); Rhoda Knight (born 1768); Sylvanna Knight (1770-1843, married Sarah _____ and lived in Washington Co GA); Elizabeth Knight (1773-1841, married Aaron Cherry); Charles W Knight, (1775-1848, married Charlotte Bell and lived Edgecombe Co); Charlotte Knight, lived Edgecombe Co; John Knight, lived Edgecombe Co. The just named Lucretia Cherry Knight and Joseph John Pippin had children: Nancy Pippin, who married Luke Ward; Lydia Pippin married a Mr Austin; Martha Pippin married Eli Porter and had son Joseph John Porter and daughter Nancy Porter; and Joseph John Pippin Jr. (JA,57,77, 83,64, 94,95, C,151, 5pehij,6t)\n\nAaron Cherry [C1a2f9d], son of Thomas Cherry and Rachel Outlaw, was born in the latter half of 1795 in Bertie Co NC. He was named in his father's September 1812 will, and was living in Snake Bite Township in Bertie Co in 1870, when he was 74. In 1850 he was single (age 54), living four doors from Mrs Elizabeth _____ Cherry (age 63, and perhaps a widow of one of his brothers?), and the James Duers family (age 66) with whom Elizabeth was living. In 1840 this same Elizabeth was living between William J Cherry and Theophilus Cherry; Aaron was then still unmarried, living close to his brother James Cherry [C1a3f9e]. Aaron married Elizabeth Harmon in Bertie Co on 4 November 1852. Bond was provided by William J Cherry [?], and witnesses were Jeremiah Bunch Jr, Richard T Harmon, and Charles Harmon. Elizabeth was born in 1824 in NC. In 1860 Aaron and his family were living three doors from his younger brother Thomas. Aauron died by 24 February 1873; on that date the Bertie Co court allowed widow \"Elizabeth D B Cherry\" to take a year's worth of provisions from Aaron's estate,including $300 for her and $100 for each of their three children still at home-\n\n1. Mary E Cherry, b 1854\n\n2. Margaret E Cherry, b 1857\n\n3. Keddy Ann Cherry, b 1859 (69,57,105,C,6knqrm)\n\nThere were three Aaron Cherrys in Edgecombe Co in 1830.\n\nAaron Cherry [C1a8h1k], son of Levi Cherry and Sarah _____ of Edgecombe Co NC, was born about 1798 in Edgecombe Co, and was named as an heir in his mother's 1835 estate records. (Aaron was age under 10 in the 1810 Edgecombe Co census; age between 16 and 26 in the 1820 Edgecombe Co census; age in the 20s in the 1830 Edgecombe Co census; age in the 40s in the 1840 Edgecombe Co census; age 53 in the 1850 Edgecombe Co census, while his wife was age 54 then). Aaron married Eliza _____ by 1820. She was born in NC in 1796, and in 1830 they were still in Edgecombe Co, two doors from his mother. He was too old to be a son of any of Levi's sons, and because his home was so close to Sarah, it is assumed that Aaron was her son. Aaron and Eliza had no children by 1830 or 1840. In 1850 he was still in Edgecombe Co. In 1850 Mrs Anna Thigpen (Anna Cherry, Aaron's sister) was living nearby. Living with Aaron and Eliza was Eliza Harris, age 18. Aaron died on 15 November 1858, \"age about 60,\" from burns. (77,5pjkn)\n\nAaron B Cherry [C1a8i3d1h], son of Alford Cherry and Sarah Miller, was born in 1848 in Warren Co KY. He married Mary Tom Young in Warren Co on 17 December 1872. She was born 19 September 1853, daughter of James Hudnell Young (1825-1871) and Louisa Miller (1827-1901). Aaron and Mary lived near Greencastle in 1880, close to his brother Elijah. Aaron and Mary had two children by then-\n\n1. Elliot Cherry, b 1875 in Warren Co KY (57s)\n\n2. Laura Cherry, b 1878 in Warren Co KY (57s) (57iknqc)\n\nAbigail Cherry [C1a8m], daughter of Lemuel Cherry and Gatsey Ann Llewellyn, was born about 1742 in Beaufort Co NC. She was alive in July 1754 when her father's will was written. (57,WD,4p)\n\nAbner Cherry [C1a5e6], son of Job Cherry and Abiah Ventures, was born about 1768 in Tyrrell Co NC. He was not the head of his own home in 1790, but by 1800 had married and was living in Martin Co near his father's household. Abner was named in his father's will as an executor in February 1811 (as was Jesse Cherry). He inherited a lot and house in Williamston, \"formerly belonging to Jonathan Cherry.\" On 27 October 1806 Abner sold two Negro girls named Silvey and Besse, aged about 17, to James Everett Jr for £450. This transaction was witnessed by James Ward, John Ward, and Jesse Morris. The Wards may have been relatives of Sarah Biggs; see page 796. Abner also was an executor, along with Darling Cherry, for the estate of John Winberry in 1815 in Martin Co.\n\nOn 10 November 1807 Abner Cherry sold 96½ acres to George Roebuck, both of Martin Co, land bounded on one side by property of William Biggs. He was still in Martin Co in 1810. In 1832 an Abner Cherry won land tracts in the 1832 \"give away\" of the Cherokee Indian land, in Bibb Co GA. Abner's wife was born circa 1775 and they had three children by 1800, and at least eight by 1810. There is a marriage record in Bibb Co between an Abner Cherry and Sarah Trent dated 25 February 1828. Because the Abner of this biography was by this time about 60 years old, this 1828 marriage could have been of a son (or grandson?). The senior Abner lived at Macon, Bibb Co GA in 1830; only a young teen granddaughter and a daughter (or daughter-in-law?) age in the 30s were at home with him. This young woman was of age to be Abner’s eldest daughter, or a widow of one of Abner’s sons. Abner had at least eight children (some ages may be for the wrong child)-\n\na. dau Cherry, b 1795-1800 (1eh)\n\nb. Job S Cherry, b 12 Dec 1798 (1eh)\n\nc. Edmund Cherry, b 1795-1800 (1eh)\n\nd.

Other winners, many of whom had names linked with familiar NC Cherry names, were: Abner Cherry, Happy Cherry, Howell (Harwell?) Cherry, Isaac Cherry, Lemuel Cherry, Spencer Cherry, Wilie Cherry, and others.\n\nJob Cherry also lived at Macon, Bibb Co in 1830. He was in his 20s, and may have been Abner’s son. (91,77,115,116,120,C,1aehp,53j)\n\nAbner Cherry [C2d1c3b12], son of Amos J Cherry and Alice J Noe, was born 2 May 1889 at Radford Station, Christian Co IL, the county at the southeast side of Sangamon Co. Abner was still single in 1910, boarding at Springfield in the James Stringham home (the census taker wrote his name as Adler, not Abner). He died in August 1968 in Cook Co. Abner married Margaret J Murry about 1912. She was born 30 July 1890 in IL, and died at Springfield in July 1980. Abner was a teamster in 1917 and 1920 for the local coal mine company at Springfield. In 1942 he lived at Arlington Heights, Cook Co and had a grocery store there called Cherry Market. They had two daughters-\n\na. Alice M Cherry, b 1913 (68w)\n\nb. Mary R Cherry, b 1916 (68w) (W,M,68uw)\n\nAbbot Cherry [C1a6b2a2e4], son of Nehemiah W Cherry and Mary Ann Rogers, was born in 1855 in Stewart Co TN. (37yq)\n\nAbraham Mack Cherry [C1a7d4c2c3], son of Andrew Cherry and Louisa J Newman, was born 27 September 1887 in TN. He always used just his middle name; his first name was revealed when he registered for the WW I draft. In 1910 Mack lived with his brother George in Clay Co. He married Mandy Baley Jones in 1912 and they lived in Clay Co. She was born in TN on 23 October 1895, and died at Indianapolis, IN on 9 July 1974; her daughter Bernice also lived at Indianapolis. Mack died in Clay Co on 4 April 1941. They had eleven children-\n\na. Louan Cherry, b 3 Apr 1913\n\nb. Maullene Cherry, b Jun 1915\n\nc. Bransford L Cherry, b 4 Jan 1918\n\nd.

(77) (77,M,64vwfx)\n\nAby V Cherry [unknown], probably a daughter or granddaughter of Joshua Cherry or his brother Job Cherry Jr, was born in NC in 1802. Perhaps her name was actually Abiah Ventures Cherry, named after the mother of Joshua and Job. Aby V Cherry married William Parker in Caldwell Co KY on 6 February 1829. Joshua and Job both lived there in the mid-1810s (Caldwell Co deed book B, page 67), so Aby could have been a descendant of either. There was a William Parker in Hopkins Co in 1830, the county just east of Caldwell Co, but that William and his wife were both too old to be Aby Cherry’s family. There was a Robert Parker in Caldwell Co in 1830, the only Parker in the county. William Parker was the head of his household in 1840 in Caldwell Co, and again in 1870. He was born in NC in 1805, and had first married Sally Marsh in Caldwell Co on 23 May 1826. The 1840 census shows that William had a son born 1826-1830 with his first wife (Robert P Parker; see daughter Mildred’s biography). By 1850 William and Aby had seven children, all born in Caldwell Co-\n\n1. John S Parker, b 1831. He married Louisa Early in Caldwell Co on 11 January 1855. She was born in KY in 1836. They lived in neighboring Lyon Co in 1860 and had two children before Louisa died. John then married Sarah L George in Lyon Co on 27 January 1863; she was born in KY in 1844. John had at least eight children-\n\na. Thomas J Parker, b Oct 1856 in Lyon Co, died 26 June 1858 in Caldwell Co. (47d)\n\nb. Rebecca E Parker, b 1859 (105q)\n\nc. William Hezekiah Parker, b 19 Nov 1863 in Lyon Co, died near Hopson, Caldwell Co on 1 August 1942. His death certificate’s informant was Robert Parker of Princeton, KY, and said that William H was a son of \"John S Parker\" and \"Sarah George.\" William had married Emma _____. (105s,47d)\n\nd.

He drank acid to kill himself. Joel was married when he died. He was a drayman. \"E G Parker\" was the informant for his death certificate, and said that Joel’s parents were \"John Parker\" and a Ms \"Georges.\" Joel was buried in East End Cemetery.

(47k) Delilah Parker married Charles S Galloway in Cladwell Co on 28 August 1849. He was born in KY in 1825. In 1850 they lived in Alexander Co IL. His wife Delilah was then age 24, born in KY. They had a son-\n\na. Samuel S Galloway, b Feb 1850 in KY. (565n) (47m,565n)\n\n3. Thomas W Parker, b 1834 (47kn)\n\n4. Mildred D Parker, b 8 May 1836. She married Henry Clay Bozarth in Cladwell Co on 18 July 1855. He was born in Christian Co on 26 July 1837, son of Dr Alfred Milton Bozarth (1815 KY) and Mary Ann Dunn (1822 KY), and died at Waco, TX on 18 May 1877. Mildred died in 1912, probably at Eddyville, Lyon Co where she lived in 1910. In 1910 Mildred was the housekeeper for Robert P Parker, age 84 (born 1826) and born in KY of NC born parents. He was probably Mildred’s elder half-brother. She and Henry Bozarth lived in Lyon Co for years and had five children-\n\na. child Bozarth, b & d abt 1857 (105u)\n\nb.

Philadelphia Parker, b 1838. She married John P Smith in Caldwell Co on 19 January 1856 and they lived in Lyon Co in 1860. John P Smith was born in Lyon Co on 18 March 1836, son of Ransford Smith and Katherine Howard, and died at Princeton, Lyon Co on 2 March 1911. He was still married when he died. John was buried at Princeton. He was a retired merchant when he died. In 1860 Philadelphia’s sister Gabriella lived with them. Caldwell and Lyon Counties KY are neighboring counties.

She was born 23 February 1842 in Warren Co, daughter of Dolphine Miller (1815-1876) and Elizabeth Ann Runner (1817-1904), and died there on 1 August 1866, after three children. She was buried in Green River Union Cemetery at Richardsville, Warren Co. Adam married a second time, to Martha Jane Goode at Greencastle, Warren Co on 1 January 1867, and had children with her. Martha was born in KY on 23 March 1849, daughter of Samuel Venable Goode from VA and Elizabeth Ann Taylor from NC, and died 18 July 1888 in Warren Co from consumption. She was buried in Green River Union Cemetery at Richardsville, Warren Co. His third wife was Clara Dunn, married about 1889. Clara was born in KY on 14 March 1849, daughter of William Dunn, and had three children from her prior marriage, but none with Adam. They lived at Greencastle, Warren Co in 1900 and 1910. Adam died at Richardsville, Warren Co on 2 May 1927 from cancer. E A Cherry of Bowling Green was the informant for his death certificate. Adam's wife \"Mrs Clara Cherry\" died of a stroke at Richardsville on 5 February 1935. In 1930 Clara lived next door to Adam's eldest son at Greencastle. Minnie Cherry of Richardsville (step-son Luther Cherry's wife) was the informant for her death certificate. Adam and Clara were buried in Fairview Cemetery. His eleven children were-\n\n1.
