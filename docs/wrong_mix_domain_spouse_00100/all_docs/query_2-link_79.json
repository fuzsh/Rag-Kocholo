        "text": "By studying the people associated with my McBride and Hemmings ancestors, names not usually associated with Indians, I believe I showed a probable kinship with the Goings. By studying other Indian/mulatto names not usually associated with the Goinstown Indians but who lived close by, may give clues as to what tribe or tribes the Goings were associated with and where they came from.\n\nI had read somewhere, maybe in the Gowens Foundation material, that the Goinstown Indians seem to pop up out of nowhere on the western division of the 1850 Rockingham Co., NC census. They go on to say that you can find some on earlier censuses but others were there all along but were afraid of being counted. Perhaps, the Cherokee Trail of Tears took place around 1838. Anyway, 1850 seems like a good point of time to start.\n\nThe Journal of Southern Indian Studies Vol 40, 1991 p25.\n\ngives the prominent names in Goinstown are Goins, Hickman, Harris, Richardson and Kimmons. I believe that the article is referring to names found in the Goinstown area today. In the 1850 Rockingham Co, Western Division census the names you see listed as mulattos are Goings, Gibson, Belton, Harris, Moore, Edwards, Guin and a few others.\n\nGoinstown is in the northwest corner of Rockingham Co on the Stokes Co line and going to Virginia (Henry Co and very close to Patrick Co). Several researchers also include the surrounding area of Stokes Co, NC and Patrick and Henry Counties, VA as part of Goinstown. It does seem reasonable to think that other Indians close by would be connected especially if they share a common name such as Goings.\n\nThe Snow Creek district of the 1850 Stokes Co census is beside the Goinstown area of Rockingham Co. and adjoins Patrick Co. In dwellings 785 and 786 are two Sizemore families who are classified as white but carry a significant entry in the Guion Miller Rolls as does the Poindexter and Scott families in the surrounding area.\n\nTo the left of Snow Creek and also adjoining Patrick Co is the Peters Creek District of the 1850 Stokes Co census with another group of Indians listed as mulattos. At dwelling numbers 48, 49, 51 and 61 are various Goings families. At number 50 is a Beazley family, at 89 a Franklin family, Hickman at 175, Riddle families at 205 and 207 and Pike at 219. The Sauratown District has mulatto Goings families at dwellings 1187 and 1188 along with mulatto Riddles at 1198. Although classified as white, Poindexters live at dwelling 1072.\n\nThe presence of Indian/mulatto Gibson, Riddle, and Beazley families in Goinstown and next door in Stokes Co might be an indication of tribal connections. I believe Gibson has been tagged as a Saponi name as well as Riddle. I believe Beasley has been linked on this forum to Granville and Person Counties again suggesting a Saponi link.\n\nIn the Southern District of the 1850 Patrick Co along the Stokes Co border mulatto Harris and Goin families share a dwelling at 253. Beside them from 254 to 257 are various Ayres and Harris families listed as white. A mulatto Goin family lives at 214 and mulatto Goings at 656, 660, 672, 698, and 722. A mulatto Guinn family is at 614. Many other Goings families listed as white along with Ayres/Ayers, Bowman, Guinn, Thompson, and Scott families who can be found living next door to each other or very close by. Some Thompson familes in Patrick today are considered to be Indian or have a lot of Indian blood.\n\nThe significance of the Sizemore name can be found in Guion-Miller application number 417. From the government document for 417, “Sizemore…applicants claim through Ned (or Edward), John (or Doctor Johnny Gourd), Joseph Sizemore and William Sizemore, …. These applications number about 2000, representing approximately 5000 individuals. The claimants reside chiefly in northwestern NC, northeastern TN, southwestern VA and southern WV, and northwestern and western AL…it appears that Ned Sizemore, John Sizemore, and Joseph Sizemore were brothers, but the exact date or place of birth could not be definitely determined. It is probable, however, that they were born somewhere between 1740 and 1760. Some accounts fix the place of birth as Halifax Co, VA while others say it was Halifax Co, NC, while another account states that Ned Sizemore “was duly enrolled upon the rolls of the Cherokee Nation taken and made in the year 1748, in the Catawba Reservation…”\n\nStokes Co appears prominently in the testimonies such as “Joseph Sizemore … must have come to Stokes Co about 1821 or 1821, but Doctor Johnny Gourd (known as an old Indian doctor) came out here several years before he did.”\n\n“Old Ned Sizemore lived on a creek called Blackwater that ran into Clinch River right at where he lived in Lee Co, VA.” Thus some of the Sizemores were moving into the same areas that other know Indian groups had moved to. Specifically, Gibsons and Collins, names associated with Saponis had movied into the same area ( http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/jarvis.html).\n\nHow can you make sense of the Halifax Co, VA , Halifax Co, NC, Catawba River and Cherokee locations? According to http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/nations/catawba.htm “In 1826 nearly the whole of their reservation (Catawba) was leased to whites for a few thousand dollars, on which the few survivors chiefly depended. About 1841 they sold to the state all but a single square mile, on which they now reside. About the same time a number of the Catawba, dissatisfied with their condition among the whites, removed to the eastern Cherokee in western North Carolina, but finding their position among their old enemies equally unpleasant, all but one or two soon went back again.” From http://www.ibiblio.org/dig/html/split/report47b.html “After 1730, many of the Saponi left the area to take residence with the Catawbas. However, they were not happy there and returned to Virginia in 1733, accompanied by some Cheraws.” It could be that the Sizemores were Saponis or Cheraws who had joined with the Catawbas, were unhappy and remembering their kin went back to visit remnant Saponi populations in Halifax Co VA (the Indians of Person Co spill over into Halifax Co, VA) or Halifax Co, NC before moving to Stokes Co. (The time frame 1826-1841 just before the 1850 Rockingham Co census when all of the Goinstown Indians show up could be significant. From http://sciway3.net/clark/freemoors/Catawba.html, “By 1822 the number of souls on the Catawba reserve was recorded at approx. 450” and “A report of David Ivey, the agent to the Catawba, puts their number in 1826 to be an incedible 110.thats a loss of over half of the population within 4 years!” (Goinstown could be the place where part of the missing Catawbas had gone.)\n\nAnother significant Guion-Miller application for the Goinstown area which includes Patrick, Stokes and Surry Counties is number 664 for Sarah Mashburn. According to the government document, some of the applicants ancestors were living in Cherokee territory in the 1835-1851 time frame. There were about 800 applications representing 1500 individuals which led back to common source, Chief Donohoo. According to application number 664, “Chief Donohoo was born in Va, probably near or on the James River, about the year 1700; that he married a white woman by the name of Mary Wentworth, and had a daughter who was given the name of Elizabeth or Betty, who married a white man by the name of William, commonly called Bill Pledge – that this Betty Pledge had two children who took the name of Pledge, to-whit, Elizabeth or Betty, the second, and Frank Pledge, and that she also, either before or after her marriage to William Pledge, had two other children, John Ayers and Junalusky. Betty Pledge, the second about the year 1760 or 1765, married Thomas Poindexter…raised a large family…and their descendants are scattered through the Counites of Stokes, Surry, Yadkin, and Forsythe, NC. It further appears that Frank Pledge removed to the same general locality with Poindexters and his descendants are also located in that vicinity, as are some of the descendants of Junalusky and John Ayers.” The Scott family figures prominently in the descendants from Ann Radford Poindexter marrying Daniel Scott around 1780 in Surry Co, NC. Evidently, Scott used to be a common name among the Catawbas, but by 1847 most of the Scotts had disappeared from the Catawbas according to http://sciway3.net/clark/freemoors/Catawba.html.\n\nA few of the applicants sued after being rejected and managed to actually get Cherokee roll numbers. Descendants of the applicants have formed a tribe http://www.neetribe.org/ with powwows http://www.powwows.com/calendar/calendardisplay.php?eventid=5037. From their website “descendants of Chief Donnaha, a Cherokee Chief whose Tribe and Clans lived along the Dan River, Yadkin River, Catawba River and upper parts of the Pee-Dee River of North Carolina.” The river locations sure sound like Saura/Cheraw locations if the information is correct. I believe there is a lot confusion as to whether John Ayers and his brother was really Cherokee, and the granting of the roll number may have been in error.\n\nFrom a county government website http://www.stokescounty.org/stokesyesterday.htm “The Dan River is said to be named for an early Saura Chief, Danapaha. The North Carolina Gazetteer repeats this tale. (I would have thought that it might have named after the Dan River of the Old Testament and the city of Dan being the northern limit of the Promised Land. William Byrd did survey the area and received land here which he named Eden.) Anyway, http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/NA-CHEROKEE-NC/2004-03/1078587149 and http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/NATIVEAMERICAN-CHIEFS/2004-02/1077561256 suggests a link between Danapaha and Donohoo.\n\ncontinued"
