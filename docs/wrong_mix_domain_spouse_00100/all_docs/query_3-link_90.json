        "text": "Fans of Mary-Louise Parker, who played the drug-dealing matriarch in Showtime’s hit “Weeds,” should prepare to see her in a very different role. She’s been picked up to star in the newest Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, “Christmas in Conway.”\n\nParker will play an ailing woman named Suzy Gainsborough, whose husband attempts to build a Ferris wheel in their backyard for the perfect Christmas present, as he proposed to her many years ago on one.\n\nIt might seem like quite a giant switch for the Golden Globe winner, who is best known for her role as a suburban mother turned cannabis dealer. However, this is far from Parker’s first Hallmark film. She also starred in “Cupid & Cate,” “Saint Maybe” and “A Place for Annie” before her “Weeds” gig.\n\nParker has kept herself busy since “Weeds’” last episode after eight seasons aired last year. Coming up, she is in “Red 2” and “R.I.P.D.,” both of which are airing in theaters later this year.\n\n“Christmas in Conway” will be directed by John Kent Harrison as his 8th Hallmark Hall of Fame film and written by Stephen P. Lindsey and Luis Ugaz. Filming begins August 5 and it will premiere on ABC later this year."
