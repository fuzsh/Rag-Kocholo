Just when I stopped looking for the perfect person, the perfect person showed up.\"\n\nThe couple, who have kids from previous relationships, said they wanted to take their time as they have their kids to take into account.\n\nAs per the outlet, Combs said: \"We had both come to the point in our lives where we were very dedicated to our kids, and okay with the fact that we would probably raise them as single parents.\n\n\"We went on proper dates. We courted for quite a while. We both have kids so we were careful and cautious and slow.\"\n\nAfter a year of dating, the two got engaged in 2017.\n\nIn September 2019, the two tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony in Carmel, California.\n\nWas Holly Marie Combs married previously?\n\nPrior to Mike Ryan, Holly Marie Combs was married twice.\n\nIn 1993, Combs married former actor Bryan Travis Smith. The two were married for four years before calling it quits in 1997.\n\nIt wasn't until February 2004 that Combs married David W. Donoho, who worked in the camera and electrical department on the set of Charmed.\n\nTogether they welcomed three sons: Finley, Riley, and Kelley.\n\nThe two were married for nearly eight years before divorcing in November 2011."
