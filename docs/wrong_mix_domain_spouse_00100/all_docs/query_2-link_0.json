He is a professor of statistics at Stanford University, where he is also the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor in the Humanities and Sciences.[1] His work includes the development of effective methods for the construction of low-dimensional representations for high-dimensional data problems (multiscale geometric analysis), development of wavelets for denoising and compressed sensing. He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.\n\nDonoho did his undergraduate studies at Princeton University, graduating in 1978.[2] His undergraduate thesis advisor was John W. Tukey.[3] Donoho obtained his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1983, under the supervision of Peter J.
