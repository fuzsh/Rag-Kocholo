        "text": "Acclaimed actress Mary-Louise Parker has won a Tony, an Emmy, an Obie and a Golden Globe for her expressive, hilarious and haunting performances. She seems to own any stage she’s on or any film and TV show she’s in, and now she’s about to take over the printed page with her much heralded (and great-titled) first book, “Dear Mr. You.”\n\n“Dear Mr. You” boasts both innovative style and profound substance. It is her life in letters, scribbled to all the men, both real and imagined — who have shaped, unsettled, built up or torn down who she is or who she might become. Each of the 34 missives unspools a bit more of what Parker feels is essential in life, from the willingness of a friend’s husband to become her lifeline, to a director and mentor who showed her both how to live and how to act.\n\nWe get to follow Parker on her journey as a girl fantasizing about being saved by the Beatles while wearing a halter dress and as a Sartre-reading young woman warding off the advances of a stranger because she’s really already scooped up. She writes to her lovers, to her son and even to a cabdriver she’s rude and caustic to, who shows her that “you never know what happened to someone that day,” and so it’s always a good idea to be kind. Later, she’s the besotted mother of two kids, and her dreams for her progeny are as fierce as those for herself.\n\nThe book is deeply personal, but not all the men she writes to are real, or even people she has actually known. “Dear Grandpa,” an ode to the grandfather who died before she was born, is riveting and alive, as she imagines him going through war and sending a bottle of whiskey hidden in a moldy cake to his son in a foxhole. “Dear Firefighter” addresses one of the 9/11 heroes covered in ash and the connection and astonished sorrow she feels with him.\n\nBesides being deeply moving, Parker is also adept giving the funny bone a tickle or two. In one chapter, she talks in a voice “only ants can hear.” She cautions “Dear Future Man Who Loves My Daughter” with a wry set of rules, advising him “Do not have another face hiding. Yeah. I would really not,” even as she shows the vast love and esteem she has for her girl. Parker’s writing is full of poetry, too, with lines as startling as breaking glass. Space is entirely poetic, she says, and “you can watch night wave across Earth from its baby beginning notes.” There are no answers to difficult tragedies, she writes, but there are “four thousand versions of songbirds.”\n\nOf course, as in any collection, some of the letters are more powerful than others.\n\nIn “Dear Gorgeous,” she concocts the perfect man, who of course, doesn’t exist, and although it’s slyly written, it feels a little bit like filler because it doesn’t have the depth of other chapters.\n\nBut then you get to “Dear Oyster Picker,” the last and most powerful of all the letters, and you could find yourself both devastated and uplifted. Parker begins addressing another man she’s never met, one who picks oysters, and it soon becomes clear why this oyster picker is so crucial to her life, because this piece is really about her dying father, who wants nothing more than a last delicious feast. Parker calls everyone she knows, and as she tries, she unravels the story of her father, how after losing his job, he seemed to lose his identity, too. She began to notice how the placement of the pictures in the house changed, hiding the holes he’d punched, and how he came back to being her core of strength.\n\n“You are no longer a literary device,” she tells the oyster picker, but someone who meant so much to her father that he now means even more to her, and she saves the oyster shells in a bowl.\n\nFlashing backward and forward in time, and into and out of all these lives, “Dear Mr. You” is really about finding the beauty, the humor — and the sorrows — in our lives and the lives of others, and being glad and grateful for all of it. So here is my letter: Dear Ms. Parker, Thank you for this dazzling collection."
