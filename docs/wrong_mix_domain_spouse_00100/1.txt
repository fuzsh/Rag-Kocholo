David Donoho (September 13, 1965) is the ex-husband of Holly Marie Combs and was a key-grip on Charmed.

Notes[]

It was thought that he made a little appearance on Charmed in the Season 3 episode, Coyote Piper as the man that Piper flirts with while dancing on the bar in P3, but he clarified on his Twitter account that it wasn't him.
