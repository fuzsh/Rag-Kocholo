Upon retirement, they built their home on Lake Tapps, in Auburn, WA. They enjoyed traveling around America and Canada in their RV and visited several places in Europe and Asia. Louise was always a gracious hostess. Everyone enjoyed her cooking as well as her wonderful wit and sense of humor. Their home was full of laughter. They were active in local communities and in the churches they attended. Dale and Louise were married 59 years before his passing in 2007.

Both were consistent in their Christian walk and were wonderful parents for their three children: Judy (Dean Bame), Phyllis (Mike Williams), and Clair (Karen) Parker. Louise thoroughly enjoyed her 5 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. She was very special to them, and they made special efforts to call and visit her whenever possible.

A private graveside service will be held at Tahoma National Cemetery, Kent, Washington.
