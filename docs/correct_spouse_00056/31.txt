Rose McGowan has broken off her engagement to director Robert Rodriguez an inside source told RadarOnline.com exclusively.

McGowan recently filmed Rodriguez’s action-packed Machete- which co-stars Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Alba and Robert De Niro- in Austin, Texas and will next star in the she-devil comic book adaptation Red Sonja. Rodriguez is set to produce the film so maybe a reconciliation isn’t completely out of the cards?

Reps for the couple did not immediately respond for request to comment.

The couple officially announced their engagement in October 2007 after becoming romantically involved in 2006 on the set of the Planet Terror segment of Grindhouse, which was directed by Rodriguez and starred McGowan as a stripper with a machine-gun leg.

It was widely speculated at the time that their relationship was the reason Rodriguez divorced his wife of 16 years, producer Elizabeth Avellán. The director later issued a statement saying that he and Avellán had separated long before production began on the film.

McGowan, 36, and Rodriguez, 41, went public with their relationship in May 2007 when they arrived hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival. They have been together ever since, despite false rumors that they had split up last year after financing for a Rodriguez-planned Barbarella remake starring McGowan fell through.
