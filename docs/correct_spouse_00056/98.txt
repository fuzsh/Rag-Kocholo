UPDATE: Go figure, it seems the reports of the McGowan and Rodriguez break-up are untrue and despite the group lovefest over the news plans are apparently still in place to move forward with all three films the couple intended on making with McGowan in the lead. People carries a quote from McGowan’s rep saying, “The production of all three films is moving forward with Rose to star,” and a second source said, “She and Robert are fine.” This could be smoke and mirrors or it could be a case of “The New York Post” getting it wrong. I am voting on the latter, but praying for the former. Original article follows…

The opening line of “The New York Post‘s” article announcing the break-up of director Robert Rodriguez and actress Rose McGowan is oh, so very telling of how silly the whole thing was in the first place:

Rose McGowan’s breakup with her fiancÃ©, director Robert Rodriguez, could be good news for some other actresses, who could end up with the leading roles she was set to play in his movies.

Does this mean McGowan won’t be starring in the Red Sonja film that was just announced five days ago? And what about that Barbarella film the two were supposed to do together. I mean, after all, Rodriguez told USA Today recently, “Rose is a pistol. She’s whip-smart, has attitude to burn, is sexy, extremely strong, yet has a vulnerable side that would surprise her closest friends. That description also fits Red Sonja.”

Does this mean that now that the two aren’t together Rose no longer fits the description? Wanna know how petty and meaningless their relationship actually was if any of what the Post says is true?

But sources say the couple, who we reported last October were engaged, have split, partly over the problems Rodriguez had finding financing for “Barbarella” – the 1968 cult classic in which Jane Fonda played a sexy space adven- turess – with McGowan in the title role.

If this doesn’t speak volumes to what seems to be Rodriguez using McGowan as a sex toy then I don’t know what does. For the past two years we have heard about how much the two loved each other and all the movies they planned on making together (Red Sonja, Barbarella and Woman in Chains!), but now it seems big Bob Rod was just waxing ass and tossing the former Marilyn Manson lover to the side once he was done.

What was ruined? Well, outside of the potential for three shitty films there was Robert’s 16 year marriage, but no one really cares about marriage anymore do they?
