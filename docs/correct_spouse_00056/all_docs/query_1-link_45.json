        "text": "Why the fuck would he \"re-introduce\" Rose to her rapist though? That's messed up.\n\nYeah, that's pretty sickening.\n\nEverything about the op-ed is really weird tbh. Like the fact that he thought it would be morally just for Weinstein to pay for Rose's career re-launch without really going into the horribleness of making her work for him again?????\n\nAlso the fact that he blames \"helping her\" for his marriage dissolving????\n\nIDEK.\n\n\"Making her\"? Everyone knew the Weinsteins were producing the film, rose accepted the role knowing it. it's not like their involvement with the project was a nasty surprise thrown upon her after she signed on and couldn't get out.\n\nHis op-ed was messy for a lot of reasons but this was not one of them.\n\nAnd he believed her about the assault based on HW’s reaction. Like. What!??\n\nMte omg\n\nhis logic and reasoning skills are non-existent tbh\n\nmte wtf\n\nMaybe she said it was ok to do because she wanted to see his reaction too? It doesn't say her thoughts on it.\n\nEverything about his reasoning seems wtf worthy to me\n\nMaybe its the wording?\n\nPerhaps she hadn't told him at that point because he had just met her and they went over to harvey to make him uncomfortable about the blacklisting (but perhaps he didnt know his reaction was really towards the assault, but in his mind it was just that harvey didnt like rose for some reason and thats why he thought she felt she was blacklisted?)\n\nAnd in retrospect he realizes the reason harvey was flustered?\n\nIf not... He's a complete asshole.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nIt’s a fucking MESS of a response. I’m stunned.\n\nMfte its a mess\n\nMTE\n\nRight? He seems very intent on painting himself as a hero/martyr/victim.\n\nright how did none of his people stop this\n\nDoes he want a pat on the back or something? He's still an asshole.\n\nThe Truth is that Rob Rodriguez is as much of a Trash can as Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro Inarritu, Guillermo DelToro, Diego Luna and Gael Bernal Garcia. A fucking city dump.\n\nWhy are you only mentioning latino men??\n\n(no subject) - seeyoutuesday Expand\n\n(no subject) - savage_land Expand\n\n(no subject) - seeyoutuesday Expand\n\n(no subject) - jensonanckles Expand\n\nGross\n\nYou're so anti-Mexican, I don't doubt you voted for Trump only because he's just as anti-Mexican.\n\n(no subject) - savage_land Expand\n\n(no subject) - seeyoutuesday Expand\n\nwhat a saint\n\nThinks that he/others should have done more\n\nYa think. Go FUCK yourself scumbag.\n\nSo you were the real hero, Robert\n\ngood to know\n\nBecause my ex sold our movie to my rapist for distribution\n\nDon't know if this is accurate, but I think Marilyn Manson was supposed to do a movie with the Weinsteins back in 2005/2006/2007\n\nSounds like he was taking advantage of being her lifeline.\n\nThe layers to this situation...each more disturbing than the last.\n\nThis makes him look so much worse imho. He looks like, maybe, two or three levels below Weinstein on the POS scale.\n\nhmmmm...right...makes \"sense.\"\n\nSomething in the milk isn't clean on this.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nSo....Marilyn Manson?\n\nhe isn't a director or producer though. as far as i know the only movie he was ever in with rose is jawbreaker, and he only had a cameo in that"
