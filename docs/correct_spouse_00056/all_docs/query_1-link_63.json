        "text": "News reports related to allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Harvey Weinstein continue to arrive at a rapid pace. Late Friday evening, two actresses, Annabella Sciorra and Daryl Hannah, joined more than 50 other women in publicly accusing the disgraced movie mogul of sexual misconduct.\n\nEarlier in the day, two other prominent accusers were back in the spotlight, as Ashley Judd's ABC News interview continued to reverberate through the media and Rose McGowan addressed the Women's Conference in Detroit.\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein has filed suit against his own company for access to his email and personnel records, signaling that he may use them to pursue a wrongful termination case or other legal actions against the company.\n\nFriday's developments as they happen:\n\nActress Annabella Sciorra accuses Weinstein of rape in New Yorker report\n\nSciorra, known for such films as Reversal of Fortune and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, tells Ronan Farrow, who wrote an earlier groundbreaking story on the scandal, that Weinstein violently raped her in the early 1990s and repeatedly sexually harassed her over the next several years.\n\nHannah, whose film credits include the Kill Bill films and Steel Magnolias, discusses two incidents involving Weinstein from early in the last decade. She alleges Weinstein once pounded on her hotel-room door, forcing her to escape by a back entrance. When he did it the next day, she says she barricaded herself in the room with furniture.\n\nIn another instance, she says Weinstein asked to touch her breasts.\n\nBoth women discuss the excruciating decision to speak openly, including fears of personal and professional harm that could come with public statements.\n\nSciorra speaks of how scared she was during a conversation she had with Farrow months ago when she denied Weinstein had done anything inappropriate.\n\n“I really, really panicked,” she says. “I was shaking. And I just wanted to get off the phone.”\n\nAfter The New York Times and The New Yorker published their blockbuster reports of Weinstein's alleged abuses earlier this month, she called back Farrow and decided to go public, despite continuing concerns.\n\n“Now when I go to a restaurant or to an event, people are going to know that this happened to me,” Sciorra tells Farrow. “They’re gonna look at me and they’re gonna know. I’m an intensely private person, and this is the most unprivate thing you can do.”\n\nThe story also details efforts many women say were made to keep them from going public with their allegations.\n\nA Weinstein spokeswoman tells The New Yorker that he \"unequivocally denies any allegations of non-consensual sex,\" echoing earlier statements made in response to accusations.\n\nDirector Robert Rodriguez says he cast Rose McGowan in 'Grindhouse' to stick it to Weinstein\n\nDirector Robert Rodriguez is finally saying what he knew about Rose McGowan's battle with Harvey Weinstein following her alleged rape at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah.\n\nRodriguez, whose credits include Sin City and Machete, shared his account in a Variety story published Friday.\n\nHe says he first met the Charmed actress at a party held during the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where she told him she wished she could have been in Sin City, which was screening that year. However, she told him she couldn't even audition because she was blacklisted from working on any Weinstein-produced movies.\n\n\"When I asked what she meant by that, and how could she possibly be blacklisted,\" Rodriguez recalled. \"She told me the horrifying story of what Harvey did to her seven years earlier.\"\n\nHe added, \"My first reaction was one of shock. I recall clearly what I said next, “My God, why didn’t you say anything? People would have stood up for you! And where was your fiancé during all this? I would have at least beaten the crap out of Harvey if I had heard that.” Rose said they didn’t know what to do. She confided that a female attorney had told her that because she had done nudity in movies that no jury would believe her and that it would turn into a he-said-she-said case.\n\nRodriguez told her he knew of a loophole they could exploit: \"I made movies all those years for Dimension and Bob Weinstein,\" he explained in the Variety piece. \"So I explained that if I cast her in my next film, Harvey couldn’t suddenly tell me no, because my first question would be “Oh, really? Why can’t I cast her?” And I was sure he would not want to tell me why.\n\nThat next film as 2007's Grindhouse/Deathproof, a double-feature he was writing with Quentin Tarantino, a frequent Weinstein collaborator.\n\n\"I wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her OFF the blacklist,\" he wrote, \"and the best part is that we would have Harvey’s new Weinstein Company pay for the whole damn thing.\"\n\nRogriguez says they were careful not to rub their scheme in Weinstein's face out of fear of retribution for violating McGowan's non-disclosure agreement and concern he would refuse to promote Grindhouse.\n\n\"To our horror, Harvey buried our movie anyway,\" he said because McGowan was the lead actress, \"and because we did not want to risk getting sued, we never spoke publicly about the matter. It would have been much easier on both of us if we could have just revealed why we were doing it.\"\n\nHe says he hopes the scandal will result in the passage of legislation that will render NDAs \"legally null and void in situations where rape and assault have been committed and where power is so unequally distributed.\"\n\nHe added, \"Since I’ve seen a distinct lack of stories coming from men who may have tried to do the right thing, I wanted to come forth to say that no matter the consequences, no matter how far you have to stick your neck out, no matter what you have to lose, that we must fight the good fight. Everyone has to make a stand and take action.\"\n\nRose McGowan to Women's Convention: 'Name it, shame it, call it out'\n\nActress Rose McGowan implored women to fight sexual harassment and assault by calling out harassers and naming names, though she didn't do either during her remarks at Friday's opening of the Women's Convention, reported The Detroit Free Press' Georgea Kovanis.\n\nShe proclaimed, \"For all of us who have been told we're nothing ... for all of us who have been grabbed by the (expletive), no more! Name it. Shame it. Call it out. Join me, join all of us ... as we do what's right for us, for our sisters, for this planet, mother earth.\"\n\nFriday morning's speech marked McGowan's first public appearance since she said via Twitter that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein raped her. She has become a major voice in the fight against sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nWhile she did not mention Weinstein by name, she said that the men in control of Hollywood, of making images that are reflected back at us — images of women — should not be in charge.\n\n\"I have been silenced for 20 years,\" McGowan said of her alleged sexual assault. \"I have been slut-shamed. I have been harassed. I've been maligned and you know what? I'm just like you. What happened to me behind the scenes happens to all of us in this society and that cannot stand, and it will not stand. We are free. We're strong.\"\n\nShe urged the audience to be roses in their own lives. \"The actual flower,'' she said. \"It is about all of us being roses in our own lives. Because we have thorns and our thorns carry justice and our thorns carry consequence. No more will we be shunted to the side, no more will we be hurt. It's time to be whole, it's time to rise. It's time to be brave.\"\n\nAfterward, she told Kovanis why she didn't use Weinstein's name in her speech, despite urging other women to call out their attackers.\n\n\"I don't like a monster's name,\" McGowan explained. \"It's a horrible name to say; it's a horrible name to hear. It's a name that has haunted me. And if I feel like saying it in print, I will. I do not feel like having that ugly thing come out of my mouth.\"\n\nMore: A complete list of the 58 accusers\n\nRose McGowan calls out Lisa Bloom as a 'snake who sold out other women'\n\nNor did McGowan mention civil-rights attorney Lisa Bloom, whom she had called out Lisa Bloom on Facebook for hounding her and trying to bribe her into saying Weinstein had changed his ways.\n\n\"Did you think of how it would affect victims to see you champion a rapist?\" McGowan asked in her essay. \"How it felt to those you once “fought for,” for them to know that you used them. You remember them right? They were the victims of assaults, women you’d previously helped. You lied to those hurt women and hid your true character. You wanted a shortcut to fame. You sold your book to be made into a mini-series, where you’d be the next Erin Brokovich (sic), right? But your avarice has taken you down. And I am glad.\"\n\nMcGowan, 44, also alleged that Bloom had been in contact with her literary agent, \"saying there’d be money for me if I got on the ‘Harvey’s changed’ bandwagon.\"\n\nShe described Bloom's pitch: \"You told her that I should care about HIS reputation. How HE has a family now and HE has changed. Well, guess what? I’ve always had a family and that didn’t stop him from assaulting me.\"\n\nShe told Bloom, \"You and your vile partner in evil, your co-counsel, (Weinstein attorney) Charles Harder, have been hounding me for months now. Terrorizing me at every turn. Trying to silence me.\"\n\nShe called Harder the \"nasty heavy\" to Bloom's \"silvery tongue of faux-concern.\"\n\nShe also brought up the legal bill she just received for the latest chapter in her battle with Weinstein.\n\n\"I now have to pay for two incredibly wealthy men $24k for haggling over my deepest pain,\" she wrote. \"I have to pay for two men to have coffee and croissants at a fancy restaurant to discuss my ASSAULT and what would happen to me if I DIDN’T SHUT UP FOREVER.\"\n\nBraden Pollack, a representative for Bloom, countered that she has never spoken to McGowan, her literary agent nor her lawyer.\n\nMcGowan is currently at the Women's Convention in Detroit where she gave opening remarks and will take part in a panel about protecting victims of sexual assault under Title IX.\n\nAshley Judd: Society is at a “tipping point” on sexual harassment\n\nOn the same day her interview with Diane Sawyer blanketed ABC News, Ashley Judd was honored at the Women’s Media Center Awards in New York on Thursday.\n\nThe actress, who recounted her 1997 Harvey Weinstein encounter in a New York Times exposé published Oct. 5, which prompted the outpouring of dozens of additional reports and accusations in the weeks since, says the continuing flurry of allegations against the powerful producer means society is at a “tipping point” on sexual harassment.\n\n“This will be the end of it if we decide that’s what we want,\" she emphasized, adding that she has felt loved, adored and supported after coming forward with her story.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred, who represents several of Weinstein's accuser, praised Judd to the Associated Press, noting that she has started an “important conversation nationally” and “anyone who preys on women in the workplace is on notice.”\n\nContributing: Georgea Kovanis, Detroit Free Press; Associated Press"
