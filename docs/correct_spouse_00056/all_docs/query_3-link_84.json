        "text": "Assembly District 53 includes Montclair and Pomona, along with parts of Chino, Ontario and Upland.\n\nSince 2014, the district has been represented by Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona. Unable to seek another term due to term limits, Rodriguez is running for mayor of Pomona instead.\n\nFour Democrats — including Rodriguez’s wife, Michelle Rodriguez, and Pomona City Councilmember Robert Torres, son of Rep. Norma Torres, D-Pomona — and one Republican now seek to replace Rodriguez in the Assembly.\n\nCandidates are listed in this article in the order in which they will appear on the March 5 ballot, as determined by the San Bernardino County Registrar of Voters. We asked all candidates the same questions. Below are their responses.\n\nJavier Hernandez, Democrat\n\nOccupation: Nonprofit executive director\n\nWebsite: Hernandez4Assembly.com\n\nCampaign donations since Jan. 1: $56,213.50 as of Feb. 21\n\nIf elected, what would you do to respond to the housing crisis in the district?\n\n“I will act to respond to our housing crisis on three fronts: protecting renters and existing housing options, building more affordable housing, and investing in resources that will transition our unhoused population into sustainable lives. I will pass legislation to protect renters and secure funds to build new affordable housing. I will invest in mental health facilities and addiction treatment services for vulnerable unhoused communities to transition them into sustainable housing.”\n\nWhat would you do in the Legislature to address crime in the district?\n\n“As an Assemblymember, I will prioritize common sense, community-driven solutions that bring permanent change and tackle the root causes of crime. I will invest in community resources to ensure we have safe, livable neighborhoods, including youth services and mental health services that prioritize crime prevention and set our residents up for success. By bolstering programs and creating opportunities for our residents, we can reduce crime and enhance quality of life.”\n\nWhat would you do, if elected, to improve the district’s employment and job prospects?\n\n“As an Assemblymember I will work to bring good paying jobs to AD53. I’ll expand career technical education programs for all residents. I’ll invest in our infrastructure to attract high quality good-paying green jobs to our district, advocate for protections for all workers to organize without fear of intimidation or retaliation, and fight to ensure workers have livable wages. I’ll secure resources to support small businesses and local entrepreneurs to create high road employment opportunities.”\n\nRobert Torres, Democrat\n\nOccupation: Pomona City Council member\n\nWebsite: RobertTorres.org\n\nCampaign donations since Jan. 1: $69,795 as of Feb. 21\n\nIf elected, what would you do to respond to the housing crisis in the district?\n\n“We need new ideas and a fresh approach to deal with the affordable housing crisis. In the state Assembly, I will work to eliminate outdated laws so we can build more housing faster, create good-paying construction jobs, and prioritize housing that is affordable for working families.”\n\nWhat would you do in the Legislature to address crime in the district?\n\n“I will invest in local police, firefighters and paramedics to reduce emergency response times and keep our neighborhoods safe. I am also committed to expanding after school programs to increase tutoring, mentoring and recreational programs that keep kids off streets, out of trouble and away from drugs and gangs.”\n\nWhat would you do, if elected, to improve the district’s employment and job prospects?\n\n“I am a former union member and am 100% committed to protecting workers’ rights. In the Assembly, I will fight for good-paying jobs with benefits, safe working conditions, paid family medical leave, equal pay for equal work. And I will always put the interests of working families first.”\n\nMichelle Rodriguez, Democrat\n\nOccupation: Public safety commissioner\n\nWebsite: MichelleForAssembly.com\n\nCampaign donations since Jan. 1: $50,758.20 as of Feb. 21\n\nIf elected, what would you do to respond to the housing crisis in the district?\n\n“I plan to partner with local groups and government to kick-start programs that stop homelessness before it starts; and keep families in their homes. We need to incentivize building affordable places to live for working class families, boost financial aid for students struggling with housing costs, and push for more affordable housing projects near transit and parks. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home, close to their jobs and their family.”\n\nWhat would you do in the Legislature to address crime in the district?\n\n“Given my background in law enforcement standards and my personal experiences growing up in the 53rd District, public safety is personal for me. I will ensure first responders are fully staffed with the right resources, that our community services respect cultural differences, and to get neighbors involved in watching out for each other. I also plan to fund community policing initiatives, putting officers back into neighborhoods to build trust and ensure safety for residents and businesses.”\n\nWhat would you do, if elected, to improve the district’s employment and job prospects?\n\n“Good jobs that pay well are key to solving many of our problems, from living costs to keeping families together. In the Assembly, I’ll be focused on creating a climate that supports our local businesses so they can grow. This will mean supporting programs that connect young people with jobs and skill training, assist small businesses so they can access programs to help them thrive, and protecting the rights of workers.”\n\nNick Wilson, Republican\n\nOccupation: Law enforcement educator\n\nWebsite: NickWilsonCA.com\n\nCampaign donations since Jan. 1: $5,947 as of Feb. 21\n\nIf elected, what would you do to respond to the housing crisis in the district?\n\n“Lower the cost and increase the rate of new construction, reducing state regulation of new housing construction, cut bureaucratic red tape to allow the economy to rebalance. Allow free enterprise to grow economy and remove the excessive policies that have stunted California’s capacity to flourish. I support statewide restrictions on rent control in order to encourage investment in new rental housing. Reduce frivolous litigation that slows the speed and increases the cost of new housing construction.”\n\nWhat would you do in the Legislature to address crime in the district?\n\n“Work to repeal Prop 47, Prop 57, SB2 (law enforcement decertification). Support law enforcement, allow them to do their jobs without handcuffing them. Criminals must be held accountable, the failed criminal justice experiment has abandoned cops, crime victims and have harmed communities left in sustained fear. Prevent the closure of more prisons and rampant release of inmates. Work with law enforcement to ensure they have the tools they need.”\n\nWhat would you do, if elected, to improve the district’s employment and job prospects?\n\n“Reduce high taxes and fees on cars, energy, gas and food items that have pushed many Californians to the brink of poverty. Incentivize the construction of new housing, allow more opportunities for homeownership and access to rental housing. Encourage job creation through free enterprise, not subsidies and government regulation; incentivize businesses to stay and invest in California. Promote an economy based on equal opportunities, not outcomes.”\n\nCarlos Goytia, Democrat\n\nOccupation: Division One Director, Three Valleys Municipal Water District\n\nWebsite: ElectCarlosGoytia.com\n\nCampaign donations since Jan. 1: $4,575 as of Feb. 21\n\nIf elected, what would you do to respond to the housing crisis in the district?\n\n“As a young man, I’ve been unhoused and know the trauma and violence of being housing insecure. Discussion around solutions often focus on a single policy and the issue of wage stagnation is far too often ignored in the housing debate. Wage stagnation should be included in a comprehensive approach to housing that, as well as affordable housing supply, provides protection for renters to prevent displacement, and promotes economic prosperity for hard working families.”\n\nWhat would you do in the Legislature to address crime in the district?\n\n“Crime within the youth community was a recurring instance in the City of Pomona, and working with the City Council to support youth programming, including youth sport and youth and adult programs which tremendously helped lower the rate of crime. Expanding on these programs in the state Legislature would allow me to expand on this work for the rest of the 53rd Assembly District.”\n\nWhat would you do, if elected, to improve the district’s employment and job prospects?\n\n“Creating a trade technology center/campus with environmental sustainability job training programs partnering with various labor unions would simultaneously tackle the increasing urgency for climate change mitigation while addressing the lack of thriving wages. Using my network as a water district director and through the labor community would allow me to get the conversation started.”\n\nNote: This story has been corrected to reflect that Freddie Rodriguez is ineligible for another term in the California State Assembly due to term limits.\n\nMore on the 2024 elections\n\nHere are the new maps for Inland Empire legislators’ districts\n\nWho’s running for office in San Bernardino County in March 2024 election?"
