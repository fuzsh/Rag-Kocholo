        "text": "ROSE McGowan shot to fame in the 90s in the horror movie Scream, followed by the TV series Charmed.\n\nSince then her life has been well documented, which includes her high-profile relationships.\n\nWho has Rose McGowan dated?\n\nRain Dove - 2018 to 2019\n\nRose confirmed her romance with non-binary Rain in July 2018.\n\nModel Rain, who is 15 years the actress's junior, prefers the pronoun \"they\".\n\nTalking to PinkNews in 2019, Rose revealed that Rain came over to her house in February 2018, following an incident with a transgender protester at a reading from her book, Brave, in Manhattan's Union Square.\n\nBut it wasn't meant to be, and after a series of allegations involving texts, the couple split.\n\nDavey Detail - 2012 to 2016\n\nVisual artist Davey proposed to Rose in July 2013, after a year of dating.\n\nThe couple were married in a \"romantic and ethereal\" ceremony at the Paramour Mansion in Los Angeles in October that same year.\n\nHowever in February 2016, Rose filed for divorce from her husband of nearly three years.\n\nThe actress cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the couple's split.\n\nThe star listed the date of their separation as May, 1 2015 – meaning they were married for a year and a half before deciding to split.\n\nRobert Rodriguez - 2006 to 2009\n\nRose started dating director Robert back in 2006.\n\nHowever, they didn't confirm their romance until they were spotted holding hands at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDuring their romance Rose starred in his movie Grindhouse.\n\nThe couple also got engaged, but called time on their relationship in October 2009.\n\nDavid Zinczenko - 2002 to 2005\n\nRose dated journalist Dave for three years before splitting \"amicably\" after their long distance romance proved too much.\n\nDue to filming Charmed at the time of their relationship, Rose was Hollywood-based, while Dave was the editor of New York City’s Men’s\n\nHealth magazine.\n\nAt the time, a friend of theirs told Page Six: “The bottom line was that Dave couldn’t leave New York and Rose couldn’t leave Los Angeles.”\n\nHowever, there were claims the real reason behind their split was when she was linked to Brit TV presenter Steve Jones.\n\nMarilyn Manson 1997 to 2001\n\nThe most high profile of all her romances was when she dated heavy metal rocker Marilyn Manson.\n\nRose was engaged to Manson for two years, but separated from him in 2001.\n\nThe couple were together for around three-and-a-half years in total.\n\nIn January 2021 Manson's ex Rachel Evan-Wood made allegations of abuse against him and, at the time, Rose said she stood behind those claims.\n\nRose shared an Instagram post on February 1, 2021, in which she addressed the allegations made by Evan and other women.\n\nShe wrote: “I am profoundly sorry to those who have suffered the abuse & mental torture of Marilyn Manson.\n\n“When I say Hollywood is a cult, I mean the Entertainment industry including the music industry is a cult.\n\n“Cult’s protect the rot at the top. Theirs is a sickness that must be stopped.\n\n“The industrial fame complex chooses who they protect & who they’ll let be their victims. For profit.”\n\nShe continued to say that she stands with Evan “and all of those who have or will come forward”.\n\nManson vehemently denied the allegations in a statement he posted on Instagram.\n\nIn September 2021, Marilyn Manson's rape accuser's lawsuit was dismissed after a judged ruled the statute of limitations had passed."
