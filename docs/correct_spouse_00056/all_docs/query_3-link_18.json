        "text": "... aka Lisa Picard Is Famous (2001) (USA)\n\nDiscussion of The Rodriguez Films\n\nEl Mariachi (1992) This movie is a fantastic example of what $7,000 can do. Rodriguez was writer, director, producer, camera, sound, and everything else. The only reason he didn't star in it was because there would be no one to hold the camera. And speaking of producing, a large part of that seven thousand was earned from Rodriguez giving himself up to science projects. The story follows a man who has come into a small town looking for work as a mariachi. Mistaken for a killer, who carries his guns around in a guitar case, a local gang chases him down and tries to kill him. Also interesting: most of the guns used were water guns and the few real ones were borrowed from the local police department. (Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nDesperado (1995) A huge budgeted sequel to El Mariachi. The time the mariachi comes back to the town that took everything he loved for some revenge. The gang that tried to kill him and ended up killing his girlfriend in the first movie is the target in this one. El Mariachi was so well received as an independent film, that funding for this big commercial project came along very easily. Again, the action is huge and explosive. Very fun to watch. This film also established relationships between Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, and Rodriguez and ever lovely Salma Hayek. Big ups to Salma. I love you, girl. (Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nFour Rooms (1995) It's hard to express feelings for this film. On one hand, there's nudity. On the other, it sucked. Rodriguez directed the third of four segments titled \"The Misbehavers\". The story is about a couple of bad kids stuck in a hotel room while their parents attend a New Year party. Rodriguezs contribution was certainly on of the better efforts in the film, but couldnt save this stinking ship. (Segment written and directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (1996) Totally bitchin' movie. One of action's greatest. After making buddies with Tarantino in Desperado, the two teamed up for this film. It starts off as a rough gangster movie and ends up as a vampire killing romp. With some of the greatest Tarantino dialog and some of Rodriguezs finest action, this movie was bound to be cool. I believe that Leonard Maltin put it best as \"a celebration of excess\". How true. (Directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nThe Faculty (1998) Another great action/horror movie from Rodriguez and this time you could throw in a little of the sci-fi. The movie is about a high school that is quickly taken over by some sort of alien parasite. A small handful of unaffected students remain and it's up to them to save to world. This script was actually pulled off of a five-year stint on the shelf before screenwriter Kevin Williamson was given the job of spicing it up. If you've enjoyed Rodriguezs earlier works, you'll surely like this one too. (Directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000) This straight to video feature is a far cry from the first film, but leaps and bounds better than the second. Actually, this prequel pretty well follows the story line of the first one, only this one is about the origins of Santanico Pandemonium. It is set back in the old gunslinging west and ends up in a brothel where the vampires live. Check it out if you liked the first one. (Story written by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nSpy Kids (2001) I'm all about Robert Rodriguez. And when I heard that he was doing this movie I thought that it was great that he was trying to expand his career and not confine himself to be a genre filmmaker. I thought this all the way into the theater. I also understand that this movie wasnt exactly aimed at my demographic, but could it have been any stupider? I mean damn. I enjoy kids movies as much as the next guy, maybe more. But this movie was rough to watch. It was inspired by Rodriguezs short segment in his earlier project, Four Rooms, and is about two kids that venture out to rescue their captured spy parents. This is the last movie that Rodriguez shot on film. He did his post production work at George Lucass Skywalker Ranch, and was there introduced to the advantages and freedoms of digital filmmaking. (Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nSpy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams (2002) Well, surprisingly enough this sequel was actually more enjoyable than the first film. It was no cinematic classic by any means, but is wasnt all that bad. It tells the story of the Spy Kids next adventure through an amusement park, under the sea, an to a mysterious disappearing island. there a mad scientist has created a device that can either control or destroy the entire planet. He just wants to be left alone to tinker with his devices in place, but when word get out about his invention his cloaked island starts crawling with all ages of spies. This is Rodriuezs first digital film and only the second to be shot on the high definition progressive scan digital camera (the first being Lucass Attack of the Clones). We give Rodriguez credit for the amazing roles he takes on in this and every picture he works on, and this film is no exception. Here he has almost a dozen credits and even co-wrote the songs for the films soundtrack. (Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nSpy Kids 3: Game Over (2003) As the tagline says Third Mission. Third Dimension. This film is literally a 3-D virtually reality adventure. An evil toy maker has developed software to take over the minds of the planet's youth and its up to the Spy Kids to thwart his efforts. They are transported into the game (at which time the audience is prompted to dawn their classic blue and red cardboard glasses) and they have to defeat the program level by level. As it is now Rodriguezs mainstay of filmmaking, the entire project was shot on digital film, but the vivid images and colors are bleached out by the cheap and gimmicky 3-D glasses. The film has not been as well received as the other two Spy Kids movies, and lets hope that it marks the end of the franchise. (Directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) Being the third film in the series (El Mariachi 3 or Desperado 2), this film holds little in common with the previous two besides similar characters. The first film is a story about mistaken identity. The second of revenge. Both revolve around one character, El Mariachi. The third film is so packed with different characters and subplots that is seems that our good friend El is merely playing a supporting role. The story centers around a powerful druglords attempt to overthrow the Mexican government and is told via a number of different characters views. Its not he best film in the series, but overall it is pretty enjoyable. The action is explosive and the camera work is fantastic. Rodriguez found a lot of freedom in the digital cameras he used, and he seems to revel in it. But, by the time youve figured out what everyone is up to, and why they are up to it, you find it wasnt worth the effort. Rodriguezs friend and fellow God of Filmmaking Quentin Tarantino suggested the film and the title. He pointed out the similarities between Rodriguezs career and that of Sergio Leone. He compared Rodriguezs El Mariachi and Desperado to Leones A fist Full of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Tarantino said that the logical progression would be Once Upon a Time in Mexico to balance with Once upon a Time in the West. (Written and Directed by Robert Rodriguez)\n\nACOUSTIC SPACES ~ Austin Texas Acoustic Spaces (Austin, Texas; www.acousticspaces.com) recently finished the design and sound system upgrade for film director/producer Robert Rodriguez's private mixing stage, also located in Austin.\n\nThe new sound system includes BSS Audio's Soundweb system, Crown Audio's Studio Reference One amplifiers and Pioneer's Cinema Series.
