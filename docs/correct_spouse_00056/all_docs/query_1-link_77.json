        "text": "Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez has spoken out about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment allegations.\n\nRodriguez has a long history with Weinstein’s company Miramax and was previously in a relationship with Rose McGowan, who said she was assaulted by Weinstein in 1997.\n\n“I find the behavior of Harvey Weinstein truly disgusting, both what he did and how he covered his tracks, and it makes me wonder how many others can’t come forward and tell their full story because of legal and personal intimidation,” Rodriguez said in a statement obtained by Variety. “His repulsive behavior was an abuse of power. Thankfully, he’s now discovering what true power is.”\n\nRodriguez worked with the Weinstein’s and Miramax on a number of his films, including “The Spy Kids” series, “Roadracers,” “Four Rooms,” “From Dusk Til Dawn,” and “Sin City.”\n\nThe New York Times reported that McGowan reached a $1000,000 settlement with Weinstein after an encounter in a hotel room during the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPopular on Variety"
