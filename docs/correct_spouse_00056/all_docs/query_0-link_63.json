        "text": "In 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez attempted to engineer a cult hit. Grindhouse was a grim and grisly horror double-feature – two barely-linked exploitation films stitched together in one package, one screening after another. Tarantino and Rodriguez would direct one half each, both of their films emulating the violent, low-budget B-movies that once dominated dilapidated cinemas in the Seventies.\n\nGrindhouse, made up of Tarantino’s automobile slasher Death Proof and Rodriguez’s zombie thriller Planet Terror, was also produced by Harvey Weinstein, and starred Rose McGowan, the actress turned activist, who last year accused Weinstein of rape. It was supposed to be a very big deal.\n\nOver a decade on from its release, Grindhouse didn’t have the cult legacy its makers presumably intended. There are few girls sporting machine gun legs at comic conventions, emulating McGowan’s character in the film, few movies indebted to its grungy, “back alley porn theatre” aesthetic. Rather Grindhouse’s legacy has been more unexpected, emerging as the intersection for many of the scandals currently engulfing Hollywood, as well as the catalyst for the admirable vitriol of its leading lady.\n\nAt the time, Grindhouse was a notorious flop. Despite a gonzo cast that included everyone from Bruce Willis to Josh Brolin to Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, audiences found its premise confusing (“Two movies? With an intermission?”) and its 191-minute runtime alienating. Released in April 2007, it barely made half of its $65 million budget back, while it was decided to release both Death Proof and Planet Terror separately on the international market, the latter barely hitting cinemas in the UK.\n\nIn an ideal world, Grindhouse would have been McGowan’s high-profile return to feature film, the actress cast as Cherry Darling, a go-go dancer and amateur stand-up comedian whose leg is torn off in a zombie attack and replaced by a machine gun. Her attention-grabbing visage, assault rifle sticking out of her stump, formed the crux of Grindhouse’s marketing.\n\nIn articles at the time, Rodriguez told the press that he had created the character for McGowan as a tribute to her diverse skill set, having met her at an industry party and realised that Hollywood hadn’t truly utilised her talent. In 2017, amid the tidal wave of allegations levelled against Harvey Weinstein, Rodriguez elaborated on the story, revealing that there was more to it than what he was allowed to share at the time.\n\nIn an essay for Variety, Rodriguez said that when meeting McGowan at a party in 2005, she had expressed annoyance that she wasn’t cast in his comic book adaptation Sin City (produced by the Weinsteins), and alleged that she had been blacklisted by Weinstein and barred from auditioning for any of the projects he was producing, citing a confidential settlement the pair had made in 1997. McGowan has long accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. Weinstein has repeatedly denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\n“I revealed to Rose right then and there that I was about to start writing a movie with Quentin Tarantino, a double feature throwback to Seventies exploitation movies, and that if she was interested, I would write her a bad ass character and make her one of the leads,” he writes. “I wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her off the blacklist, and the best part is that we would have Harvey’s new Weinstein Company pay for the whole damn thing.”\n\nIt’s here that McGowan and Rodriguez’s respective versions of events splinter. In McGowan’s forthcoming memoir Brave, as previewed in Vanity Fair, she accuses Rodriguez of using the information she told him in confidence to play “mind games” with her, writing a scene in the film in which McGowan’s character is threatened with rape. She has also repeatedly declared that Rodriguez sold Grindhouse to the Weinstein Company in an act of betrayal against her.\n\nRodriguez, on the other hand, has disputed McGowan’s claims, telling USA Today in a statement that he did not sell Grindhouse to the Weinsteins after McGowan came on board (“They had a first look on my next project, and I owed them two more after that,” he writes.) He also states that McGowan could have chosen not to star in the film if she had problems with its backers.\n\n“There was certainly ample time for Rose to decide not to be in a film funded by the Weinsteins and reject the movie and the script before shooting ever began,” he wrote. “And if she ever had a problem with making the movie for them I would have completely understood, changed the role, and cast someone else.” He also stated that the scene in which McGowan’s character overpowers her would-be rapist was intended to be “empowering”.\n\nWhatever the actual truth, the so-called “empowerment” of McGowan’s character was reportedly missing when it came to the Grindhouse set, with McGowan telling Buzzfeed in 2015 that she has terrible memories of shooting the film.\n\n“I just don’t like being treated as less-than,” she said. “I don’t like being treated as basically a couch that talks — and as important. I don’t like being humiliated, or somebody trying to make you humiliated.”\n\nThere were other problems on set, namely that the pair were rumoured to be an item. It was also announced during filming that Rodriguez’s wife, producer Elizabeth Avellan, was filing for divorce. To Buzzfeed, McGowan said: “It was always reported on that we got together on that set, but that’s a lie. I was in a relationship with him a year prior to the movie, actually.”\n\nThe divorce sent ripples through the Texas film community, where Rodriguez and Avellan were considered its reigning king and queen, having set up the filmmaking hub Troublemaker Studios in Austin.\n\nMcGowan and Rodriguez would become engaged in late 2007, embarking on a creative partnership together that would result in countless ultimately unmade projects, from a Barbarella remake to a reboot of the Brigitte Nielsen swords-and-sandals epic Red Sonja. They would split in 2009.\n\nWriting in Variety, Rodriguez appeared rueful of his choices in regards to Grindhouse and his relationship with McGowan.\n\n“Looking back over the years,” he wrote, “I have wondered if I would have made the same choices, knowing the bleak outcome. We all suffered greatly on the film, and the journey ended up costing us all more than we ever bargained for. For me personally, it cost me my marriage of 16 years, my family [and] a large dose of sanity.”\n\nTo Vanity Fair, McGowan also referred to the film as an experience that made her “[lose] my grip on sanity,” particularly the ways in which Planet Terror and its promotion exploited and traded on her sexuality. The film opens with McGowan performing a two and a half minute striptease, while the film was promoted with a Rolling Stone cover depicting McGowan and her Death Proof co-star Rosario Dawson wearing nothing but straps of bullets. McGowan has said in recent years that the shoot inspired her eventual retreat from Hollywood.\n\n“I just had this bouffant hairdo, this big bubble hairdo, this weird Photoshopped forehead that they gave me — I don’t know why exactly, because my forehead was fine, last I checked — and this dark fake tan,” she told The Wrap. “I’m chest-to-chest with Rosario Dawson and an ammo belt around my hip was the only clothing I had on. And I was like, 'Who is that?'”\n\nShe would go on to say that it made her realise the sexualisation actresses are convinced to submit to in order to shift product.\n\n“It’s always part and parcel of it, you’re expected as a woman, this is what you trade off of, this is how you sell tickets to the movies, this is your part of it,” she explained. “Your job as a promoter is this: They’re not sticking a guy on the cover doing it, unless it’s like Seth Rogen doing a joke. So as a woman I’m expected to sell myself, my body, my image, my sexuality, in order to get your ticket sales up. It’s kind of f----- up. And it’s like, wait, I wasn’t aware that when I signed on to act, I had to sell myself that much.”\n\nIn recent months, McGowan has repeatedly said that her career choices throughout the Noughties were determined by her thirst for revenge; almost a long con that would finish with McGowan finally bringing down Weinstein.\n\n“Even with Rodriguez, as brutal as it was, it was all gathering data,” she told Vanity Fair. “Unfortunately, I am the data. It was a sacrifice. But I knew from a very early age that this messaging system was very, very wrong and needed to be brought down.”\n\nShe told a press event this week, while promoting her new documentary series Citizen Rose, that even her decision to join the cast of Charmed was a choice made with Weinstein in mind.\n\n“I did [Charmed] so I could gain a foothold internationally in all areas so when the [Weinstein] news broke, I could have a foothold and people would pay attention in every region across the globe,” she said. “This is a long plan.”\n\nMcGowan’s statements are occasionally histrionic, and the targets for her wrath sometimes questionable, but in the last two years she has unexpectedly turned what was once considered little but an overly-ambitious flop movie into ground zero for one of the most culture-shattering events in modern history, its effects already seen around the world."
