        "text": "Robert Rodriguez is a homebody, a family man and a revolutionary.\n\nRaised with 10 siblings in San Antonio, married for 13 years and dad to three young sons, he's a nice-guy film director with a child's sense of fun.\n\nBut he also mixes homegrown resourcefulness with high-tech tricks, making low-budget flicks whose scenes look like a million bucks.\n\nLatest is the colorful, wildly imaginative Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, a PG-rated family film that earned an estimated $25.3-million in its first five days. A sequel to his surprise hit of last year, the $112-million-grossing Spy Kids, it's got kid agents Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara crossing oceans to a mysterious island overrun by bizarre creatures.\n\nRodriguez filmed for two days in Costa Rica, shooting against beaches and a volcano. He shot the rest of the globe-hopping Spy Kids 2 in his own backyard, Texas.\n\nYou might not expect such family fare from the man who helmed the action hit Desperado and the horrific mayhem of From Dusk Till Dawn. But after carving a career in these genres, Rodriguez seems happiest turning his childhood dreams into on-screen realities.\n\n\"I really wanted to do family movies like I grew up with _ Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Willy Wonka, Escape From Witch Mountain,\" he said. \"I call this The Island of Lost Dreams because it's as if every dream I had as a kid I stuck in this movie.\"\n\nHe also tried to \"keep it entertaining while having wholesome lessons. Parents can watch it, and kids love the empowerment.\"\n\nThe set was a family affair, too. Stars, including \"spy parent\" Antonio Banderas, brought along their kids, and Rodriguez's wife, Elizabeth Avellan, was a producer.\n\nAs for Rodriguez, he was director, screenwriter, producer, composer, editor and special-effects supervisor.\n\n\"By doing so many jobs, it's actually easier,\" he said. \"You don't need Hollywood, where the whole methodology is overblown. The technology today makes moviemaking personal. Anybody can do it. The business can reinvent itself.\"\n\nRodriguez is proud that he shoots in Texas and can \"make a movie feel huge without a big budget. People say, \"I can't make movies because I don't have $100-million and a big crew,' but you don't need that.\"\n\nInstead, you just need a rubber band.\n\nThough he riddles Spy Kids 2 with fancy gadgets, Rodriguez also uses an elastic band to show kids that what really counts is their imaginations.\n\nYet he also wants the best of both worlds. Like George Lucas, Rodriguez embraces the digital revolution. After shooting Spy Kids 2 and the upcoming Once Upon a Time in Mexico digitally, he says he'll never shoot on film again.\n\nLike Lucas, he's tried convincing Steven Spielberg, but the world's top director is sticking with film.\n\n\"He's just a vinyl-records guy,\" Rodriguez said. \"He grew up with film and loves its imperfections. For the rest of us mortals, we're doing ourselves a disservice by shooting on film. It's an archaic medium.\"\n\nRodriguez believes the DVD explosion will spur more demand for digital movies.\n\n\"Film prints are terrible, and exhibition is terrible. People see DVDs that look better than what they see in theaters. They see the difference (between) VHS and DVD, and the theater screen looks like VHS.\"\n\nAs a result, he tries to use the \"latest digital cameras and the most high-tech equipment. I still solve my problems in low-tech, creative ways, but the technology frees you to be creative.\n\n\"If it becomes so technical it takes you away from creativity, that's when I abandon it. That's when the rubber band's better. You just need to know the difference.\"\n\nWhen Spy Kids' success sparked a sequel, Rodriguez told its studio, \"I'm going to make a much bigger movie with twice as many effects, but I don't want a bigger budget.\" Again he spent about $30-million, low by Hollywood standards.\n\n\"At a certain point, more money doesn't do you any good,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"Besides, you get more freedom working cheap. The studio lets you do what you want, and you can really think like a child,\" he said. \"You can be more daring and use any impulse that comes into your head.\"\n\nSpy Kids 3 is due in theaters July 23, 2003. Rodriguez will shoot it later this year _ in the Austin area, of course."
