        "text": "[quote=“Geoi”]\n\nI thought Douglas Aarniokoski was just a 1st AD.\n\n[/quote]\n\nI think this will be his solo debut.\n\n[quote=“Yasmin”]When will this deluded fucktard realise that not everyone, especially the movie going public, think the sun shines out of Rose McGowan’s fat arse. She can’t carry a film, hence her not being cast in many of them. [/quote]\n\nYou seem to take this a little too personal. I thought she carried Planet Terror pretty well for what it was. Besides, the USA Today article makes it seem as if somebody offered her the role and then she showed the script to Robert. Anyway, I read a couple of the comics yesterday and it doesn’t really seem like the type of role that’s going to be too demanding. I don’t think they’re looking to make an art house film about a chain mail bikini clad warrior girl.\n\nWith the character not having the biggest built in audience the studio probly figured they’d need a somewhat well known actress to make up for it. How many halfway decent semi well known actresses out there would be willing to wear this all day?\n\nThe only other two I can think of are Keira Knightly and Rosario and Dawson and neither of them fit the look.\n\nHe’s a loser. He’s a such a loser that he needs to be immortalised in the dictionary, in pictorial form under the description LOSER.\n\nHe might have a few decent movies, but he’s no Tarantino, he’s no Scorsese, he’s no Coen. He has such a lazy approach to filmmaking and most of his work has very little substance or complexities that you find in movies delivered by those filmmakers.\n\nIf anyone else but him had have gone to a major movie studio with the screenplay of Sharkboy and Lava Girl (Based on an idea of a 6 year old kid) do you think it would have been made? Fuck that. It would have been screwed up and shoved into a bin, where it belonged. Instead, Robert, having far too many resources at his fingertips, not only gets to make this movie, but mentally brainwashes the Weinstein brothers into distrubuting it. I think part of me died when I watched that with my niece and nephew.\n\nNow he’s coming up with ideas to remake any movie starring his mistress which embarassingly for them, no studio is willing to pick up, despite what they’re telling the press.\n\nHe is not ‘cooler’ than most filmmakers out there, he’s probably a huge laughing stock among his peers, given how lazy, shoddy and downright awful the majority of his films truly are. Do you honestly believe he inspires anyone but a student filmmaker who could probably deliver a better film than he could?\n\nI don’t think Ethan and Joel Coen will sit down to watch Once Upon A Time In Mexico and say to each other… “See that bro? That’s what we shoulda been doin’ all this time… just to be as cool as that Rodriguez guy”\n\n[quote=“Yasmin”]\n\nHe’s a loser.

How do you get that? The guy writes, directs, edits, casts, and even does the fucking score for most of his movies. That’s not to mention how fast and cheap he manages to make his movies. Lazy film makers are the guys who work so slow they have to have two or three crews just to get the film in the can in under three months.\n\n[quote=“Yasmin”]If anyone else but him had have gone to a major movie studio with the screenplay of Sharkboy and Lava Girl (Based on an idea of a 6 year old kid) do you think it would have been made?

I think part of me died when I watched that with my niece and nephew. [/quote]\n\nThat’s because no other director would have been able to do it for less than $100 million. Plus Robert had street cred when it comes to kids movies. The Spy Kids movies were extremely profitable considering their low budgets.\n\n[quote=“Yasmin”]Now he’s coming up with ideas to remake any movie starring his mistress which embarassingly for them, no studio is willing to pick up, despite what they’re telling the press. [/quote]\n\nLike I said before, when it comes to Red Sonja, it seems pretty clear that the studio came to them and Rodriguez is only producing. The Barbarella remake was brought to him by Dino De Laurentiis and his wife.\n\n[quote=“Yasmin”]I don’t think Ethan and Joel Coen will sit down to watch Once Upon A Time In Mexico and say to each other… “See that bro? That’s what we shoulda been doin’ all this time… just to be as cool as that Rodriguez guy”\n\n[/quote]\n\nThat’s just mindless. Every film maker has to be on par with the Coen Brothers or they’re lazy and shoddy? Seriously, you put him up against three directors who make completely different movies. Compare him to Michael Bay or Peter Berg. Current action directors. Even still The Coens, Tarantino, and Scorsese aren’t most directors, they’re three of the best and Scorsese hasn’t been “cool” for a long time. I’m not even sure how you got to a point where you were lumping four completely different artists together. That’s like putting Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, and Babe Ruth on the same pedestal."
