        "text": "Finally.\n\nAfter repeated denials, Robert Rodriguez and the sexy Rose McGowan have finally gone public with their relationship.\n\nThe two arrived together to the premiere of Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof in Cannes last night, after rumors that they hooked up during filming of Rodriguez’s Planet Terror.\n\nThe two had previously denied any on-set knocking of boots, as rumors went rabid that Rodriguez cheated on his then-wife – and Planet Terror co-producer – Elizabeth Avellan with the former Charmed witch.\n\nAt the time, reps for the film said that Elizabeth Avellan and Robert Rodriguez had split “long before” production began.\n\nBut now, it’s out in the open that Rodriguez has seen Rose McGowan nude.\n\nIn doing so, he joins the likes of her ex, Marilyn Manson, her Grindhouse co-star Rosario Dawson and anyone who picked up the most recent Rolling Stone.\n\nHome wrecker or not, the Grindhouse babe has got a new man – and probably a good shot of snagging the lead role in Robert’s remake of the film Barbarella.\n\nWe’d like to recommend Antonella Barba for the part – though it would get a little confusing trying to write the press releases for the film if she got the role."
