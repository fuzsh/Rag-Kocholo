        "text": "Well, it’s about time.\n\nActress Rose McGowan is finally engaged to director Robert Rodridguez, a source close to the sometimes nude actress confirms.\n\nMcGowan, 34, met Rodriguez, 39, in 2006 when he directed her in the Planet Terror portion of the Grindhouse double feature.\n\n“We are best friends,” McGowan told People last June. “We instantly became really good friends.”\n\nEngagement rumors have swirled for months as the couple attended Hollywood events, and recently Rose McGowan has been spotted sporting a diamond ring on the finger you usually wear one on.\n\nRose McGowan previously was engaged to Marilyn Manson. Robert Rodriguez is divorced from producer Elizabeth Avellan, with whom he has five children."
