        "text": "Rose McGowan has filed for divorce from Davey Detail, her husband of two years, according to court papers obtained by TMZ.\n\nThe Charmed alum, 42, cited âirreconcilable differencesâ in the documents and is reportedly asking the judge to reject any claim for spousal support. She and visual artist Detail, 33, tied the knot in October 2013.\n\nâWeâre getting married October 12th at a mansion,â she told Us Weekly in the weeks leading up to her wedding. âIt used to be a nunnery, so itâs perfect for me. As everyone knows, I am a nun!â\n\nAt the time, McGowan called Detail âmagic.â\n\nâHeâs made me a better woman,â she told Us. âAnd Iâve made him a better man!â\n\nPrior to her relationship with Detail, McGowan was engaged to Marilyn Manson and Machete Kills director Robert Rodriguez.\n\nThe actress caused a stir on social media last November after calling out Caitlyn Jenner for her Woman of the Year acceptance speech after the former Olympian joked that the âhardest part about being a woman is figuring out what to wear.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nâCaitlyn Jenner you do not understand what being a woman is about at all,â McGowan wrote on her Facebook page several days after the transgender starâs speech. âYou want to be a woman and stand with us â well learn us. We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. Youâre a woman now? Well fâking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.â\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp6Oaeq6vxqiumqZdm7atsdJmnaiqXZm2t7vRnJxmnqKkum601KyZmqaUYrGiwsSyZJ2dpJa2rXnAn6ueql2pxLB52J6Yq6tdpLNuucCrqaKZl5p6uH2VbGxsaV8%3D"
