        "text": "\"Rob attended Challenge with my older brother as well. They graduated in the same platoon. My brother almost enlisted along with him but got denied by MEPS for health problems. Living in queens during the 911 ordeal I was 11 at the time.\n\nI knew growing up I also wanted to serve my country, and help bring those terrorists to justice. I went to school with his niece, and we was good friends. I hung around outside his house in queens because he lived a block down from me. When I turned 18 I too graduated from the Challenge Academy except I graduated from the Florida Challenge Academy . I wanted to join the service but did not enlist till sort of late at 31. Once in a blue I remember him, I remember why I wear the uniform. It¬ís unreal how long it¬ís been 20 whole years. May he rest in peace alongside his loving mother.\"\n\nSPC. Macias Danny of Plant city,FL,US\n\n\"Robert and I met while we both participated in the NYNG program and we¬íre in the same platoon back in ¬ë99. Rod was full of passion, fierce in everything he did and that¬ís why he was nicknamed Mighty Mouse. Once we both graduated for the program as almost all adults, lost contact until the night I received the call that we lost little Rod. The sunken feeling learning of his passing sent chicest and anger they my body. As a 9/11 responder and almost being lost that day myself, have attended the service for so many brothers and sisters in arms. As a Senior NCO now in the US Army, there isn¬ít a day I carry Roberts memory and legacy. Hope your watching over all of us bud. On this Memorial Day ¬ë22 I continue to remember you and always will brotha. May you continue to Rest in everlasting Peace\n\nSFC AROD\"\n\nAlexander Rodriguez of Bronx, NY\n\n\"I seen Roberts picture on someone¬ís IG page today and realized this is such a small world and googled his name and found this page. I met Robert back in 1999. We both started a military school called NYNG challenge program which after graduation he entered the Marines. Me and Robert became friends right away and stood in contact after and always use to call me to update me on his journey in the marines. I was so proud of him.He had a beautiful spirit and very tough. He did more push-up then anyone in school and was the smallest..\n\nOne sad morning I was home watching the news and his name was said and his picture came up explaining his passing and a memorial was being held. I was devastated to hear this horrific news. Robert was a true hero and will always be missed. God bless his family.

Since i was a Marine and live in NY and to honor a fallen hero, I purchased your sons flag (the donation goes to a Veterans fund) if you would like the flag, I would gladly give it to you. if you do not want it I will display it at home in his honor and sacrifice so many made. I also purchsed this flag so my children and others would remebre the sacrifice so many made and the impact it had on so many families. Sorry for your loss.I assume you can leave a response on this site\"\n\nTony of NY\n\n\"\"LIL\" Rod... What's good Son? Robert was on my tank crew for a while and actually my gunner for a short time. The guy was like 5ft tall but had the heart of a lion and size did not matter to him. He loved the Marine Corps and Loved being a tanker. He taught me about the New York ways of life as well as Puerto Rico/Ricans. LiL Rod always had a smile on his face...even when some days just sucked. He always seemed to find the good in things even if odds would be stacked up against us. Before we got the green light to go to Iraq him and I slept near each other in Kuwait... And I'd tuck him every night like a little baby. LoL. I told him since my sons were in California and I missed them... He'd have to help me out. LoL He would get annoyed with me... Then just laugh. I'd always ask him if he was ok though, it was stressful sometimes waiting there in Kuwait, he'd always reply he's cool. He'd eventually start giving me crap for always checking up on him and drew a picture of me asking him if he was ok and gave it to me. I still have that picture til this day. I guess I'm rambling here. I just miss you guys.

Me being the silly platoon renegade atheist and you trying to fix me. I actually miss those talks now. It has been over a decade since we lost you and it feels just as strange and empty to have lost you now as it did then. I wish I had could have done something, anything. I am sorry, Rod. You were always proud to be a Marine. Over the years I have not forgotten how resolved you were. Take care, Marine.\n\nSemper Fi!\"\n\nJason Hightower of Newbury Park, CA\n\n\"Cpl.

He came into the BAS quite often (I was a Navy Corpsman) and over time we got to know each other fairly well. He was younger than me and a LCpl at the time. He was funny and witty and had a great personality. Like most people he loved to pick on me :)\n\nOn several occasions while he was on gate duty he jokingly refused to grant me permission onto the base. He would say stuff like \"I'm sorry sailor this is a Marine Corps Base we have no need for squids here\". Sometimes he would just smile, wink and grant me access.\n\nI transferred to the ER and only saw him a few times after that. He would come in sometimes when we had drunks and problem patients etc. During one visit he proudly showed me that he picked up Cpl and joked about how he was now my superior.\n\nHe then transferred to another unit and I never saw his beautiful smile again.\n\nI was working nights in the ER and came into see one of the nurses reading the base newspaper, and he was on the cover. I said laughingly \"what did Rodriguez do now?\" The nurse just looked at me and said very seriously \"he's dead Allyson, he was KIA\" I think I cried but I don't remember for sure, I was just in shock, not understanding how he could be dead when I just saw him a few weeks prior.\n\nThe point of this long post is just to say I never forgot you Rodriguez! It's been almost 11 years since I first met you and almost 10 years since you died defending our freedom and as long as I am still breathing you will always be remembered.

I was a classmate of his in I.S119 he was very funny and so outgoing we played what he loved football and talked about the marines.I remember running down the hall to the lunch room and fight to get the end seat of the table and we would arm restle and boy was he a strong kid and was in such great shape.After JHS he went his way I went my way but 1 day I was walking to a deli around the corner from my home and this kid was riding a bike and we glaced at each other but I thought no way is that robert and I turned my head the other way and heard breaks from a bike and I turned around and he was comimg to me and we were so happy to see each other and he had a such a beautiful smile you could never forget a person like him we talked for a few minutes and huged and said see you around but that was it I never saw him again.Me and my friend from time to time would talk about our old classmates and robert would always be brought up and we wondered what was he doind with his life but little did we know he was a hero and he had passed. On march 19,2010 a classmate of ours told me about his death a fellow marine of his. I can't put into words how deeply he is missed and how sorry I am to the Rodriguez family.GOD BLESS\"\n\nAnthony Diliberti of Glendale Queens,NY\n\n\"To the family of Robert Rodriguez,\n\nI knew Robert only briefly, though the three months we spent together seemed like an eternity at the time. We were in the same platoon on Paris Island (1st Battalion, Delta Company, Platoon 1030). I wanted to write you a message to express my sadness and to offer my condolences. I know that he has been gone for some time now, but I am sure you miss him as much as ever. You meet a lot of characters when you go to bootcamp on Paris Island, and a lot of them have a lot of heart. The New York guys were always quick to let you know where they were from, and always quick to put their heart on display. But even in a platoon full of New Yorkers, Robert was a standout, and pound-for-pound I think he had more heart than just about anyone else there.\n\nDuring our first month or so, when we would line up to file into the chowhall, he was last in line because the lineup was done according to height. The drill instructors--one in particular--loved to push Robert's buttons by instructing the platoon leave the chowhall almost as soon as he sat down to eat. As Robert began to take his first few bites of food, we would all hear the command to get up and leave the chowhall. I would often glance over to see Robert trying to stuff a few bites into his mouth before we left, visibly annoyed that we were leaving before he had really gotten a chance to eat. But when we would leave the chowhall and go to the next training event, all was forgotten and Robert was focused on the next task. He was clearly not going to let anybody dampen his fighting spirit and, food or no food, he was going to tackle the next challenge.\n\nAfter about a month or so, everybody in the platoon had warmed up to each other (and the drill instructors finally decided Robert had earned the privilege of sitting long enough to get a decent meal). That's when I got to see Robert's sense of humor, and I feel fortunate that I had the honor. He was quick to tell a joke, and quick to flash his big smile when the platoon was left unsupervised for a few moments. I am sure that this is the Robert you knew best, and the one that is most sorely missed.\n\nI hope all is well with your family. I want you to know that Robert will not be forgotten. RIP Robert.\"\n\nBrendan Duffy (formerly Sergeant Duffy, USMC) of Burlingame, CA\n\n\"I remember seeing the News when CPL Rodriguez passed. Something about him caught my eye. He looked so familiar.

We all lovingly called him Marquito. I am a few years older than he was and remember him as a rumbunctious and happy young boy. When I'd come visit he'd always sit on my lap and I'd tikle his nose with my hair. The last time I saw him was around the year 2000. He had already gone through basic training. He had matured into a young man. He had dreams for the future and was headed in the right direction in life. One thing i can say about him is that he LOVED his family, especially his mother and his oldest sister, whom he lovingly refered to as his hyda madrina. Five years after his passing it still seems like just a bad dream. He is always in our thoughts and will remain in our hearts forever...\n\nRIP Marquito\"\n\nVivian turralde of Ridgewood, NY USA\n\n\"Familia Rodriguez:\n\nI remember like it was yesterday when Roberto and I was on the John Adams Wrestling team, I even sit and laugh when I think of when we used to sneak out of school early to play some handball on those hot summer days.

When i first met robert it was in the challenge progrem there me and robert became friends, we were assiend to the same racks which we shared for five months. Robert would always look down from his top rack to my rack which was below his and robert would talk about the military after challenge, and he would ask if i would like to join the marines with him after challenge on the buddy system which would allow us to train together and go on to do the same job together. He was always sure of himself and never secound guessed unlike me, always keep in great shape and loved the marines. He would talk about his uncle who was a marine and how proud he was of him, he always had stories to tell about him. He would also talk about his sister who was a nyc police officer, he would say how he wanted to follow in her footsteps and become a city cop as well. I also had future planes in becoming a cop, robert and i had great times together in and out of challenge after robert compleated his trainning in the marines i remember him calling me letting me know that he was home on leave, i was happy to hear from him each and everytime he was home. We had so many great times we met friends such as carl a friend from challenge we also went to the porto ricon day parade an i even remeber when he met my father for the first time my father really liked robert he always told me how robert's a good guy and very respectful i would tell my father thats my friend i know. I also remember when i went with him to get tatoos, we talked most of the time on the phone while he was in palms ca trainning.

Every time I saw him at the gate while he was on watch with PMO he would always have his uniform on proper, his PMO 782 gear all nice and tight, always looked squared away. Even while most marines were short timing, hating Bn PT, Field Days and general BS, Rod was always motivated. He wanted to either become a Gunny and do his 20 or join the NYPD. I think he could've done anything he wanted, he was that type of guy. It would've been hot if he got out and joined the NYPD like his sister. It would've been cool to have a good friend from the marines as a cop in ny. But either way we are all better people for having known you. You gave your life for freedom.\"\n\nSgt Cho of Delta Tanks\n\n\"To the friends and family of Robert M. Rodriguez:\n\nI would like to express my sincere condolences for the loss of your loved one.

Rodriguez, was a motivated marine with lots of potential. I was in rods tank platoon in 2001 when he first came to charlie company, 1st tank battalion. I came across his picture on the internet and i was stunned. I hadnt seen him since 2002. I have some pictures of Rodriguez at his first Marine corps ball. I want to give them to his family. They can contact me at joshkennard@yahoo.com. On the other hand, Rodriguez was a little guy with a big heart and much courage.He will surely be missed in the tanker community.\"\n\nJ.

When he went over to be a Military Policeman for a while, I would always come through the gate and he would say \"OOH RAH Staff Sergeant\". He would do the same to my wife and I loved that. If you were ever down, you could always look to him to put a smile on your face. He did some great things for the Marine Corps and he will be greatly missed.
