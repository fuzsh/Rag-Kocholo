        "text": "Does anyone remeber McGowan dating Marylin Manson? That motherfucker is one of the biggest asshole in the planet, he’s a fag, his music sucks, and he’s just a fucking freak. I can’t beleive any woman would fuck him. I give it 2 months or less. It’s not going to last.\n\nO0 O0\n\nhas anyone seen these extra smiley dealies, kinda cool\n\nI thought this was another rumor created by Bio but its true.\n\nI think i have just lost a lot of respect for RR for cheating on his wife of 5 kids I give the marriage a month.\n\nYou guys are being really hard on them. I like Rose McGowan. She seems like a cool girl. And RR may have cheated on his wife but that doesn’t mean he cheated on his kids. He’s a great dad.\n\nExamples: He makes movies for his kids, he turned his son’s movie idea into a movie, and he shot extra footage of his son surviving in Planet Terror to make him feel good.\n\n[quote=“Biohazard”]\n\nhas anyone seen these extra smiley dealies, kinda cool\n\n[/quote]\n\nI’ve seen them\n\nIt was obvious that they’re going to marry. RR is a serious man and the fact that he divorced his wife tells that Rose wasn’t just “another girl”. I think they’re a good couple. Don’t like Rose very much though.\n\nI’m not even a big Rodriguez fan. Why the hell should I care who he marries? I wouldnt even care if he never made another movie. Yeah thats right, I said it.\n\n[quote=“ThaDuke”]\n\nExpect to see Rose in the rest of RR’s movies now; Just like we’ll get to see Sherri in the rest of Rob’s.\n\n[/quote]\n\nYour forgetting one thing Rob & Sherri have been together for years and RR & Rose have only been together for a couple of months which if you ask me they will break up before Rose can say “I’m Hired!”\n\nBlah Blah Blah Marriage Blah. Who caaaaaares? I may be a big fan of QT but I dont really care about his personal life. I wish him the best. If he gets married or doesnt etc thats his business not any of ours.\n\nI dont like RRs movies that much and I dont have to just because Im a QT fan. QT and him are best friends, so that means I have to be a RR fan? Not at all."
