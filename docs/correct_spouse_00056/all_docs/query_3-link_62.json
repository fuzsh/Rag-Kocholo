With sixteen films (including two shorts) “shot, chopped, and scored” (his identifiers often appearing at the beginning of his films) since his first breakout success El Mariachi in 1992, he has single-­handedly carried U.S. Latino filmmaking into twenty-­first-­century global cinema. Rodriguez is a Latino filmmaker who is at once an insider and outsider to the mainstream entertainment machine. With the exception of only a couple of missed years, he has created a film every year—and in some years, more than one film. This flow continues today. Two years after the release of Spy Kids 4D in 2011, his Machete Kills came out in a 2013 release while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For was in postproduction; the first installment, Machete, came out in 2010. Rodriguez has captured the attention of the media since the making of his first film, El Mariachi. The news of his shooting the film in 14 days and on a $7,000 budget created a blitz of buzz terms like “mariachi style” and “guerilla filmmaker.” The media loved, too, that he came up with part of the money for the making of the film by checking into a local pharmaceutical company where he was a paid human lab rat for its drug trials. While Rodriguez has been a near-constant fixture in the mainstream media, the systematic scholarly study of his films is only just beginning. There has been a sprinkle of academic essays on his work, and only two book-­length studies. With only three of his films yet released (El Mariachi, Desperado, and From Dusk till Dawn), in 1998 Mary J. Marvis recognized that Rodriguez should be the subject of a very light biographical book series for children on significant Latino figures. With Europeans having taken an early interest in Rodriguez, it is not surprising that the first book-­\n\n2 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\nlength scholarly study of his films should appear in Italy—a big producer of westerns (spaghetti) and horror (zombie) films; in several of Rodriguez’s films one can see much inspiration coming from directors such as Sergio Leone and Dario Argento, among others. In 2009 Fabio Migneco published Il cinema di Robert Rodriguez. However, written in Italian and as of yet untranslated, Migneco’s book remains limited to a European publishing market. The editing of this book with Zachary Ingle’s edited collection of substantive interviews, Robert Rodriguez: Interviews (published by the University of Mississippi Press), along with my single-­authored book, The Cinema of Robert Rodriguez with the University of Texas Press, marks a shift in the tide. Ingle expands his contribution in a chapter included in this volume. Yet another author in this volume, Christopher González, is special issue editor of POST SCRIPT: Essays in Film and the Humanities, which focuses on the films of Robert Rodriguez. The aim of this volume is to attend to nearly all of Rodriguez’s films in ways that enrich our understanding of how each is made (choice of lens, angle, sound design, and edit, for instance) and consumed (our perception, thought, and feeling). Individually and collectively, the volume aims to turn the spotlight onto Rodriguez’s films as an area that necessitates serious scholarly study. It aims to fling open the doors and windows to more scholarship to come.\n\nFilmmaker in Time That Rodriguez was born in 1968 is significant. He would grow up during a sociohistorical epoch when he could realize his dream to become a filmmaker. I mean by this that Rodriguez was definitely born at the right time. Already in his early teens, technologies for recording and watching film were becoming more and more cost-accessible to the average middle-­ class family. As a young adult, he witnessed the advances in filmmaking technology moving decisively away from the expensive, cumbersome cameras and editing machines of yesteryear. Already in making Desperado (1995) he had learned to use the lightweight, infinitely maneuverable Steadicam. By the early 2000s he was able to get his hands on and master digital filmmaking technology along with postproduction computer graphic editing software. Rodriguez came of age as a Latino filmmaker in the era of VHS, allowing him access to films for studying as well as the video camera recording and editing equipment to make the films. If he had been born during\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 3\n\nKubrick’s day or even before during the time of Kazan or Eisenstein, the cumbersome cameras and other laborious technical machines involved in the shooting, editing, and screening processes would have likely been out of his reach—too costly even for a middle-­income Latino family living in the Southwest.\n\nLatino Auteur Rodriguez is an auteur, of sorts. We think of Rodriguez’s brand of auteurism, however, as more of the guerilla filmmaking variety. His auteurism is to have total control over the final product, but in a do-­it-­yourself way. As a former professor of Rodriguez’s, Charles Ramírez Berg writes in “A Teaser before the Show” (the foreword to The Cinema of Robert Rodriguez), The “Mariachi Aesthetic,” the movie-­making method Robert devised to make El Mariachi, was revolutionary. Strip the list of things you think you must have to make your film down to zero—because that laundry list is only preventing you from getting to the business of actually making your movie. Instead, make a list of the resources you do have, then fashion a movie around them. (x–xi)\n\nIndeed, as Rodriguez often mentions in his “Ten Minute Film School” episodes (often included as a feature in the DVDs of his films), he usually learns with great technical proficiency all the skills involved in the making of a film to maintain creative control over the final result as well as to save money. For instance, rather than send the film out postproduction for a composer to come up with a sound design that takes up much time and money, he learned how to compose on the spot. Rather than hire a Steadicam operator for Desperado, he learned how to do it on the spot. The same can be said of his learning all the other elements of the filmmaking process. The net result: his films are made inexpensively (relative to Hollywood budgets) and have a distinctive Rodriguez quality to them. As Ramírez Berg sums up of his career thus far, “He’s spending way more than $7,000 per picture, yet the Mariachi Aesthetic remains intact: the innovation of ideas as well as vitality of creation realized in his cinema of possibilities continue to trump concerns over exorbitant blockbuster budgets” (“A Teaser before the Show” xi–xii). With Rodriguez we have an auteur in the sense of a creative mind who has a total vision and a total control of the making of the whole with a specific\n\n4 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\naudience in mind—an audience that seeks above all else to be entertained. He pushes the envelope on cinematic language, creating the seemingly unimaginable in films like Sin City, but in ways that still aim, as the sine qua non, to entertain.\n\nRodriguez’s Browning of America Rodriguez exists within a larger U.S. Latino filmmaking tradition that includes notables such as Miguel Arteta, Carlos Ávila, Jesse Borrego, Patricia Cardoso, Peter Bratt, Paul Espinosa, Hector Galán, Sandra Guardado, Aurora Guerrero, Cristina Ibarra, Cheech Marin, Ramón Menéndez, Sylvia Morales, Gregory Nava, Edward James Olmos, Lourdes Portillo, Alex Rivera, Nancy De Los Santos, Jesús Salvador Treviño, and Luis Valdez, among others. At the same time, he represents a new generation of Latino filmmaker—one that doesn’t necessarily only include in its focus explicitly, say, Latino issues: generational divisions and assimilation (Luis Valdez’s 1987 La Bamba or Gregory Nava’s 1995 Mi Familia, for instance); disenfranchisement and sense of noncitizen status (Allison Anders’s 1993 Mi Vida Loca and Edward James Olmos’s 1992 American Me); urban- and rural-­set exploitation and oppression (Gregory Nava’s 1984 El Norte and Paul Espinosa’s 1995 adaptation of . . . and the earth did not swallow him); the border and immigration policy (Cheech Marin’s 1987 Born in East L.A. and Gregory Nava’s 2006 Bordertown, for instance). Several film scholars have used broad brushstrokes to characterize these and other films that make up the corpus of Latino cinema. Such a cinematic tradition, Chon Noriega remarks, “seeks to define difference . . . against the backdrop of the ‘non-­Chicano,’ and it does so in the name of an ethnic nation, community, or culture” (xxxi). Rodriguez’s cinema is this—and more. Indeed, several scholars in this collection comment on how Rodriguez’s sense of Latino identity and experience is arguably more expansive, or the expression, in Christopher González’s words, of a “post-­post-­Latinidad.” Elsewhere, Charles Ramírez Berg gives rich nuance to the different phases of Chicano/Latino cinema, positioning Rodriguez in ushering in the most recent phase: one that seeks to make visible the Latino condition, even to mainstream it. The first phase (1969–1976) was characterized by an “anti-­stereotyping aesthetic” (Latino Images 5) whereby Latino directors sought to resist, overturn, and complicate Hollywood’s stereotypical representations. Directors who make films with a “rebellious, not\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 5\n\nseparatist” (186) spirit typify the second wave. This second wave of films is laced with anger, but it is ultimately “channeled into more accessible forms” (186). The third wave gains visible momentum in the 1990s and emphasizes oppression, exploitation, or resistance. Ramírez Berg gives Rodriguez’s “Bedhead” and El Mariachi as examples of films that take for granted Latino-­ness in the United States. Ethnicity simply is. In this third wave of Latino cinema, as Ramírez Berg states, “political content is embedded within the deeper structure of the genre formulas the filmmakers employ rather than being on the surface” (187). In many ways Rodriguez’s at once spotlighting and mainstreaming Latinos is a reflection of what is going on with Latinos in the United States generally. Latinos exert a huge demographic weight in the United States. At 50 million-­plus and counting, our presence is huge (hence Rodriguez’s naturalizing our presence). Yet, in the media we are still few and far between (hence Rodriguez’s continuing to put a spotlight on Latinos). When we are present, the mainstream media like to depict us as preternaturally hot-­tempered, violent, and ravenously sexual. Indeed, as Mary Beltrán discovers, while we see sprinkles of Latinas appearing in “interesting and compelling roles” (108), the general trend is that they continue to be held fast to the spitfire stereotype. It is the case that Rodriguez represents a new model of Latino filmmaking today—one whereby the director can (1) choose to completely make natural the presence of a character’s Latino ethnicity—it simply is as it is for Anglo characters in most films; (2) cast Latino actors in Latino roles—or any other role (he insisted on casting the then-unknown Salma Hayek in Roadracers and also insisted that the Hollywood-­produced action/Western Desperado include a large Latino cast; indeed, Latino actors such as Hayek, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, and Antonio Banderas, among others, appear again and again in all his films; and, with the filmmaking under his total control, he would consider Latinos infinitely moveable, casting Jessica Alba as the Irish stripper in Sin City and then as the Latina stepmom in Spy Kids 4D); and (3) choose to highlight Latinidad, or Latino-­ness, in ways that playfully foreground or overturn the stereotypes.\n\nNew Millennial Latino Filmmaker Rodriguez’s life very much reflects the growing of this generation of Latinos with an urban worldview: massively diversified in its cultural products\n\n6 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\nand tastes. Born June 20, 1968, Rodriguez grew up in a large family (nine siblings) in the urban environment of San Antonio, Texas. His father, Cecilio, worked as a traveling salesperson, selling cookware, china, and crystal; his mother, Rebecca, worked as a nurse. The education of Rodriguez’s varied film tastes started early. He learned to play the guitar and the saxophone. And, living in an urban environment offered the possibility of the mother’s taking the children to the movies at the local barrio (or neighborhood) revival house, the Olmos Theatre. In an interview with Peter Travers he recalls how “we’d sit with food hidden under diapers and watch movies two or three times” (Rolling Stone 3/18/93, Issue 652). Rodriguez would watch double and sometimes triple features, from the films of the Marx Brothers to those of Alfred Hitchcock. In Rebel Without a Crew, he considers these outings to be some of the most significant of his early childhood memories. As a teenager, this home-­school-­styled film education would continue with the renting and watching of movies on VHS tapes. Some of his favorites included George Miller’s The Road Warrior (the second film in the Mad Max series) and John Carpenter’s Escape from New York. As Alvaro Rodriguez so gracefully puts it in the Afterword to this volume, he and Rodriguez escaped the “sweltering South Texas heat” not only to immerse themselves in the storyworld of Manhattan-­Island-­ cum-­maximum-­security-­prison but so that Rodriguez could catalogue for Alvaro’s “eager ears a run-­through of how Carpenter shot this sequence and that, already informing what would become his own style.” His fascination with understanding how films could tell stories and create certain responses in audiences began to realize itself materially in his own making of stop-­motion stories with his father’s Super 8 camera. When his father came home with a new four-­head JVC videocassette recorder and camera, he was able to set aside the more technologically arduous Super 8. He began shooting videos of everything, including clay animations and short action comedies with his siblings. It had an audio dub feature that allowed him to erase then rerecord sound over the films; he learned to edit with the camera and how to lay the music over later. To make the visual and audio synching easier, he also learned to shoot as little footage with as few takes as possible. To become more and more efficient at this, he trained himself more and more to see, as he states, “the movie edited in my head beforehand” (Rebel x). He continued to hone his filmmaking (and cartooning) craft while attending St. Anthony’s High School Seminary, a private high school in San Antonio. He was hired to cover the football games, creatively shooting audience expression and spiraling footballs. And it was here that he would meet another\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 7\n\naspiring filmmaker, Carlos Gallardo. Both wanted to become better and better filmmakers. Gallardo wanted to cut his teeth making action features (“The Guy from the Land Down Under”) and Rodriguez to sharpen his making shorts and trailers that would eventually allow him to make a feature action film—with a Latino protagonist. In 1986, Rodriguez enrolled at the University of Texas, Austin, which would prove to be more than just a place for higher-­minded learning and thinking. It became yet another training ground for Rodriguez as a comic strip author/artist (his popular “Los Hooligans” strip based on his siblings ran in the Daily Texan for three consecutive years) and as a filmmaker. UT Austin housed the very well regarded and extremely competitive Radio-­Television-­Film (RTF) program. Rodriguez knew that to take his craft to the next level, he had to be able to train on 16mm cameras. Working three jobs while carrying a full load, however, didn’t serve his GPA well. With only thirty open spots and a hundred applicants, he knew he would have to use other means to open the door to the RTF program. On his own time and using borrowed Super-­8 and video recording camera equipment and then a camcorder that he bought with money he earned from a cholesterol experiment and then antidepressant drug studies, he made a series of shorts titled Austin Stories. One of these was “Bedhead,” which he circulated at small film fests, picking up several notable awards. He showed the film to Professor Charles Ramírez Berg and Steve Mims, who taught production in the RTF program. His homegrown low-­tech video making and editing skills—and self-­discipline and perseverance— paid off. He was in the RTF program—by other means. In the RTF program Rodriguez grew the support and admiration of Mims and also the seminal Latino film theorist Charles Ramírez Berg. Rodriguez also gained access to the 16mm camera equipment he longed to train on. With the success of his $800-­made short “Bedhead” Rodriguez figured out that even if he used a 16mm camera with its more expensive film stock, if he used the same shooting and editing techniques that he used with “Bedhead” he could make a feature film for $7,000. (By this time, he had already made nearly thirty short narrative films.) He checked himself in for more drug clinical trials (with ruled index cards, notepad, and a copy of Stephen King’s The Dead Zone) to earn part of the money (Gallardo also contributed) to make the film, and, with a borrowed Arriflex 16mm, Rodriguez and Gallardo went south of the border to make a film. The idea was to make a film to sell to the Spanish-­language video market; to make an inexpensive feature length film that he could, as he remarks, “quietly fail on, and learn from my mistakes” (Rebel 4). With only four-\n\n8 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\nteen days of borrowed time on the Arriflex, they went straight to Ciudad Acuña where Gallardo had family connections and where they might piggyback off of resources available by Alfonso Arau’s crew, who were filming Like Water for Chocolate. At a fever-­pitched pace, Rodriguez shot El Mariachi in just shy of fourteen days (as it turned out, the Arriflex was needed back on day 13) and for the budgeted $7,000. After much hard work editing and synching the sound, he was ready to peddle his wares in LA. Rodriguez recounts this part of the story much better than I could in Rebel Without a Crew, but suffice it to say that pounding pavement didn’t lead to the result he’d hoped for. Rodriguez didn’t sell El Mariachi to the Spanish video market. As Ramírez Berg states, “his plan failed because El Mariachi was too good” (“A Teaser before the Show” ix). Indeed, not expecting much after he dropped off his short film “Bedhead” and a two-­minute trailer for El Mariachi with the International Creative Management talent agency, they called him back. By April 1992 Robert Newman, Rodriguez’s agent, had used it to lasso a film deal with Columbia: the $7-million budgeted follow-­up, Desperado, along with national distribution of El Mariachi. (See Macor Chainsaws.) In Rebel Rodriguez remarks, “The main reason was that I wanted to make a modestly budgeted Hollywood picture with a Latino action hero, something I’d always wanted to see in movies since I was a kid” (194). After a $100,000 investment in a 35mm blowup of El Mariachi, it picked up awards at the Sundance Film Festival and other film fests and then grossed $5 million as a mainstream release; it went on to make an additional $1.5 million with its English-dubbed VHS version that sold in the video market. Not only has El Mariachi been credited with energizing the indie-­film director scene of the 1990s but its cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance is such that it has recently been added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Moreover, for Latinos in U.S. film, as Ramírez Berg states, “There had never been a prodigious Latino talent like Robert in the Hollywood system—someone who wrote, directed, coproduced, edited, recorded and edited the sound, edited the music, and acted as cinematographer and camera operator on his first film. This was an unprecedented and unexpected kind of Latino filmmaker, a Mexican American combination of Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg” (“A Teaser before the Show” x).\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 9\n\nMatters of Mind, Borders, and Borderlands Robert Rodriguez’s corpus is extensive. He works within—and against— film genres and character types. He comforts audiences. He also turns upside down and inside out audience expectation. The chapters collected here begin to open our eyes to the manifold ways in which Rodriguez’s films operate both internally (plot, character, event) as well as externally (audience perception, thought, and feeling). I have not included a chapter on his more studio-­straitjacketed film, The Faculty (1998). Brought in as a hired hand of sorts by the Weinstein brothers to save a runaway train (delays, rewrites, and much more led to the film’s hemorrhaging of money), the producer and studio constraints made it very difficult for Rodriguez to realize his creative vision in this film. The film is discussed further in the final piece to this volume, “Five Amigos Crisscross Borders on a Road Trip with Rodriguez,” as well as at length in my book The Cinema of Robert Rodriguez. I have created three main rubrics to contain chapters that seek to explore, respectively, these internal and external aspects of his films. “Matters of Mind and Media” includes two chapters that use the research in psychology (psychoanalytic and cognitive) to shed light on how Rodriguez’s films complicate Latin identity as well as how they succeed in making new audiences’ preconceptions of the world. The second grouping of chapters, “Narrative Theory, Cognitive Science, and Sin City: A Case Study,” offers tools and models of analysis in the study of Rodriguez’s and Frank Miller’s (credited as codirector) film re-creation of a comic book. And the third section, “Aesthetic and Ontological Border Crossings and Borderlands,” includes four chapters that consider how Rodriguez innovatively conveys content in his films that critique fixed notions of Latino identity and experience as well as open eyes to racial injustices. The fourth and final section, “It’s a Wrap,” contains two chapters that round out the volume by attending to Rodriguez’s connection to Quentin Tarantino as well as discussing at greater length and in a polyphonic manner films of Rodriguez that were mentioned earlier in the volume but not fully fleshed out. In many ways, however, these are pedagogically imposed divisions. As the chapters evince, while some might be more oriented toward questions of form and audience reception (perception, cognition, and emotion) and others more toward content (plot, character, and event), individually and taken as a whole they remind us that the actual experience of the films is of a gestalt whereby form and content are inseparable. The chapters also\n\n10 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\nvariously situate the films in time and place—the sociohistorical and regional contexts of their making, distribution, and reception. The volume opens with Sue J. Kim’s consideration of both Rodriguez’s youth-­oriented films such as Shorts and Sharkboy and Lavagirl as well as his adult-­oriented action films such as El Mariachi and Machete. Rather than see these sets of films in opposition to one another as many do, in “From El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach” Kim reveals how they “invoke social-­political issues, such as immigration and multiracial families.” For Kim these films destabilize preconceptions of generic convention, stereotype, and filmmaking agent: “Who can tell the stories. . . ? What even constitutes a movie?” Moreover, she considers how these films ask audiences to parse (or chunk) meaning-­making units in ways that lead us to think of new ways of existing in the world. In a more close-­up focus on the Spy Kids films Phillip Serrato attends to the evolution of the character Juni (Daryl Sabara). In his chapter “You’ve Come a Long Way, Booger Breath: Juni Cortez Grows Up in the Spy Kids Films,” Serrato analyzes how Juni grows from boy to man during the decade in which all four of Rodriguez’s Spy Kids films were released. Building on the insights from psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, Serrato considers how issues of Latinidad, sexuality, and gender play into Juni’s development from a sense of self as incomplete to a sense of self experienced as a whole. However, his nuanced analysis also reveals just how Rodriguez gives a gendered twist that shakes upside down this masculine whole. Ultimately, Serrato argues that the Spy Kids films in toto at once construct and then dismantle socially constructed expectations concerning (Latino) masculinity. The next series of chapters deliberately focus on one film, Sin City, as a scholarly and pedagogical test case of sorts: it allows for teachers, scholars, and lay readers to see how different approaches to the same primary text can throw light on and enrich our understanding of the same film artifact. Each of the three chapters, then, shows that various formal aspects of Rodriguez’s and Miller’s film Sin City trigger certain kinds of responses— including the response of appreciation and awe. As an introduction to the kind of nuanced analysis one can accomplish with the tools of film narrative theory and advances in the cognitive sciences, Patrick Colm Hogan’s “Painterly Cinema: Three Minutes of Sin City” offers a detailed analysis of the opening three-­minute sequence, “The Customer Is Always Right.” For Hogan, Rodriguez participates in and extends what he identifies as a painterly cinematic tradition—that tradition in world cinema whereby directors would take, as their referential model, painting. Rodriguez is a\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 11\n\npainterly filmmaker who uses the graphic novel as his referential canvas. Hogan’s understanding of how we process “lateral inhibition” in visual perception and attentional orientation, among other neuroanatomical processes, allows him to enrich our sense of how Rodriguez creates painterly cinematic art that triggers specific emotional and ethical responses. For Hogan, Rodriguez’s Sin City enhances “story emotion and artifact emotion—particularly, aesthetic emotion” in ways that take audiences out of the habitual and humdrum and into the new and vital. Emily R. Anderson’s “Sin City, Style, and the Status of Noir” follows Hogan’s chapter. She establishes clear differences between the audiovisual storytelling format of film and that of the visual–verbal of graphic novel to show just how Rodriguez/Miller succeed in re-creating (or remediating, her word) a story that we identify clearly with the original graphic novel but that is innovatively new as a film. After careful consideration of how Rodriguez’s choice of lens and use of computer-­generated images (CGI), green screen, and postproduction animatic technology allows him to create the drawn look of the film, she then turns to a discussion of how the film differs from the graphic novel. If Rodriguez were to have translated Miller literally, she concludes, “he would be forsaking everything that is valuable in the remediation. Instead, he locates his film in the history of the medium with the constant references to film production and conventions, conventions he flouts or adheres to in unmotivated succession.” Wrapping up this section, Erin E. Eighan’s “Sin City, Hybrid Media, and a Cognitive Narratology of Multimodality” attends to how the genesis of the film from graphic novel leads to a making of a hybrid film that “bridges the continuous motion of film with the panels and gutters of comics, the human face with caricature, the sound with silence.” Eighan considers the difficulty of moving from one medium to the other, especially as it concerns the narrative effects of episodic sequencing and serialization. Turning to the research on dual coding theory (DCT) that reveals how we process two functionally distinct mental systems, Eighan determines how the film embraces instead a composite, polyphonic structure and sensibility that triggers “multiple sensory modalities and cognitive systems” in the audience. Christopher González’s “Intertextploitation and Post-­Post-­Latinidad in Planet Terror” opens the second group of chapters—those that more centrally consider how elements of content and form in Rodriguez’s films ask audiences to think and feel differently about matters of ethnic, racial, and national identity and belonging. Rodriguez clearly situates Planet Terror in the sci-­fi horror genre storytelling mode. However, González demonstrates how the two key elements that bookend the story—the faux-­\n\n12 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\ntrailer for Machete at the beginning and the image of the Mayan pyramid of Tulum, Mexico, that closes the film—ask that audiences re-­view (in their minds) the story with Latinos in mind. For González, Rodriguez adds significantly to the sci-­fi horror genre, whereby the crossings of humans into monstrous others function as social critique (race dynamics of Us vs. Them no longer hold). Moreover, that Rodriguez ends the film with Cherry leading an ad hoc tribe of humans to Tulum offers audiences the possibility of apprehending a new space of inclusion—a space of “post-­ post-­Latinidad.” This, for González, “presents viewers with the possibility of transferring a similar empathetic response for real people—people they know little to nothing about—to real human beings who otherwise might only register as statistics on a CNN ticker at the bottom of their television set.” Enrique García’s “Planet Terror Redux: Miscegenation and Family Apocalypse” also attends to this nascent post-­post-­Latinidad present in Planet Terror. Using as his springboard his students’ surprise with teaching Planet Terror as part of U.S. Latino cinema, he offers a nuanced analysis to defend this choice. For García, the crossings of genres (romance with sci-­fi and horror, for instance) and ontologies (transmogrification of human into monster) represent the collapse of the traditional family structure (Latino or otherwise) built on insularity, isolation, and a general fear of racial mixing. García considers how the film works much like the blaxploitation films of the 1970s—and character El Wray is Rodriguez’s badass—that brought awareness to sociopolitical issues such as racial oppression. Zachary Ingle’s chapter, “The Border Crossed Us: Machete and the Latino Threat Narrative,” takes as its focus another of Rodriguez’s B-­flick, exploitation-­styled films: Machete. And like García does with Planet Terror, Ingle considers how the style and the content of Machete situate it within a blaxploitation cinematic tradition (as well as that of Cheech Marin’s social satires) to shed critical light on the Latino threat narrative that weaves itself in and through Hollywood’s drug traffic films, the news media’s anti-­immigrant hype, and immigration policy making. While Machete could be seen at first glance as a film that exploits the use of gratuitous violence to entertain, for Ingle a second glance reveals it to be a powerfully political and earnest film that offers audiences a salient critique of racist ideologies. James J. Donahue’s “The Development of Social Minds in the ‘Mexico Trilogy’ ” explores how the films El Mariachi (1992), Desperado (1995), and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) not only turn upside down Hollywood’s stereotypes of the mariachi as source of entertainment—not just as musician, but in most cases as the comic buffoon—but also explore how\n\nRodriguez’s Cinema of Possibilities: An Introduction 13\n\nhe develops from “a loner to an integral part of a larger social unit.” In a careful analysis of Rodriguez’s use of eye-­line match, lens, and angle (especially the close-­up) Donahue unpacks how the formal structures along with the content convey this development from isolation into a sense of self as integral to the collective. In the first two films in the trilogy Rodriguez uses eye-­line matching and extreme close-­ups to convey the sense of his isolation yet with a potential for connection (or intermentality) with others. In an analysis of how Rodriguez chooses to exclude certain film techniques as well as to include others, like the final image of El Mariachi wearing a Mexican flag as a sash across his chest, Donahue demonstrates how the figure of El Mariachi realizes his social (or intermental) potentiality. The final section brings the volume to a close with two wide-­reaching critical exploratory pieces: in “Tarantino & Rodriguez: A Paradigm,” Ilan Stavans provides the Latino lens of lo cursi through which to engage with Rodriguez’s films, overturning misconceptions that he’s somehow lowbrow and in bad taste whereas Tarantino is highbrow and intellectual. And, in “Five Amigos Crisscross Borders on a Road Trip with Rodriguez,” Christopher González, Sue J. Kim, and myself, along with two new voices heretofore not present in the volume, Samuel Saldívar and Camilla Fojas, share ideas and insights that were either not covered or only glossed briefly in the chapters themselves. They include discussion of the late embrace of Rodriguez within the scholarly community; how his films complicate notions of Latinidad—or Latino-­ness; genre bending and questions of art and industry; his rejection of the studio system; his controversial use of non-­union crews; and issues of gender and ethnic representations in his films, including especially From Dusk till Dawn. On this road trip, these collective scholarly minds tie up many questions and issues that arise when thinking deeply about Rodriguez. And, like the volume as a whole, they also open up new avenues of exploration. The volume wraps with Alvaro Rodriguez’s eloquent “Postproduction in Robert Rodriguez’s ‘Post-­Post-­Latinidad’: An Afterword.” Alvaro invites us to join him on a journey that began for him when sitting in the back of a pickup in 1980 with his older cousin, Robert Rodriguez. He offers what I would call a flash fiction Künstlerroman (a fancy word for a narrative that tells of the education of an artist). Alvaro tells of his coming of age as a short story author and screenwriter as it intertwines with Rodriguez’s journey in the creating of his cinema of possibilities. Taken in its parts and as a whole, the aim of Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez is to open the doors wide for teachers, schol-\n\n14 Critical Approaches to the Films of Robert Rodriguez\n\nars, film students, filmmakers, and laypersons to understand deeply and widely Rodriguez’s films as well as his techniques of filmmaking generally. It aims to open more doors to all variety of attentive and innovative approaches—multimodal, cognitive, affective, intertextploitational—to future studies of the multifaceted film world of Robert Rodriguez.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach Sue J. Kim\n\nWhat happens on a cognitive level to keep people self-­contained and willing to accept their subjugation rather than engage in the panic of a fight-­or-­flight response, where you lash out to protect your life and the lives of your loved ones at all costs or, alternatively, when you decide to pursue a more sustained strategy of resistance? . . . Does the conviction of hope by one or a few cause a synaptic shift in the brains of others so that they rise against their own parasympathetic suppression and spring to action, inhibiting the amygdala’s fear and the paralysis that can result? Arturo J. Aldama, “Fear and Action: A Cognitive Approach to Teaching Children of Men ” (2011, 158)\n\nAs for my powers, I’ve learned that responsibility should be applied with them, and I’ll never abuse them like I did today ever, ever again. Rebecca, “Bedhead” (1991)\n\nIn his meditation on teaching Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men (2006), Arturo J. Aldama ponders the relationship between cognition and ideology in engaging with films in a political world. Although the gulf between cognitive studies, or studies of the brain and mind, and cultural studies, where much of academic ideological analysis and critique takes place, is still great, an increasing number of scholars are addressing the kinds of questions that A. J. Aldama raises here. Or, to put it in the terms of Rebecca, the heroine of Rodriguez’s early short “Bedhead,” what is the relationship between our cognitive “powers,” or capabilities and capacities, and our social and moral responsibilities to one another? Such questions can help us think about the corpus of filmmaker Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez’s ultraviolent exploitation homages, such as El Mariachi\n\n18 Matters of Mind and Media\n\n(1991) and Machete (2010), seem to contrast sharply with his family-­ friendly fare, such as the Spy Kids series; as Aaron Hill of The Village Voice puts it, “Robert Rodriguez works in exactly two filmmaking modes: fast, cheap, genre violence (the El Mariachi trilogy, Sin City, Planet Terror) and fast, cheap, CGI-­overloaded family adventure (the Spy Kids trilogy, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-­D).” But in this chapter, I argue that cognitive approaches to film can help identify surprising resonances among Rodriguez’s films, explaining their appeal and shedding light on their ideological dimensions. Rodriguez is an indie film hero for breaking into the movie business with his independent film, El Mariachi, famously made for $7,000. The film, which he had intended for the straight-­to-­video Spanish-­language audience, ended up winning the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993. Since then, he is, as one critic describes him, “arguably the most successful Latino director ever to work in Hollywood” (Berg 241).1 While some critics have seen an assimilationist trend in his late 1990s/2000s Hollywood productions, other critics and Rodriguez himself see his films as subversive, particularly in terms of race and immigration.2 Rodriguez tells the story of being told to Anglo-­ize El Mariachi, and he discusses his own ambivalence about the negotiations he had to make on Desperado.3 Nevertheless, many of his films either explicitly (El Mariachi, Machete) or implicitly (Spy Kids) invoke social–political issues, such as immigration and multiracial families. He is also largely credited with launching the Hollywood careers of Antonio Banderas (Spanish) and Salma Hayek (Chicana/Latina), and many of his cast and production crews straddle Hollywood and Spanish-­language cinema (via Texas). His films are hardly unproblematic, but in a largely culturally and ethnically homogenous film industry, both in front of and behind the camera, his success is noteworthy. While I do not claim that Rodriguez’s films constitute some kind of progressive call to arms, I do want to explore what Rodriguez’s films can show us about the relationships between cognition (including emotions), art, and ideology. I will first examine some of the ways that watching (and making) films involves basic cognitive processes that also are deeply embedded in—­ conditioned by while also reinforcing—sociopolitical contexts; Rodriguez’s films both draw on and slightly shift the conventional ways in which our minds use films as “problem-­solving tools,” thus possibly shifting our relationships to those contexts. In the second part of this chapter, after examining some approaches to cognition and emotion in film, I discuss some of the ways in which Rodriguez’s movies suggest that aesthetic\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 19\n\nform and historical context can play a significant role in what Ed S. Tan calls “film as an emotion machine.”4\n\n“Tools for Thinking”: Chunking, Typification, and Cause-­and-­Effect From its mid-­century origins, which primarily saw the brain as a computer-­ like input/output logic machine, cognitive studies—­particularly those branches attempting to meld the sciences, social science, and humanities— have moved towards explorations of brain and mind as complex, multivalent things that are historical, social, and embodied.5 In other words, while we can identify shared or basic cognitive functions and capacities, in the real world, actual thinking and being works in complicated ways, which is why considerations such as an unequal distribution of resources within and between nations need ultimately to be part of understanding how our minds function. Put simply, many scholars have moved beyond seeing cognition as simply an individual phenomenon. Although specific cognitive approaches range from the primarily neurobiological to those emphasizing social relations, and while methodologically we often have to isolate particular processes and patterns of thought to identify and study them, “postcognitivists” understand that cognition cannot really be separated from social relations (Herman, “Re-­Minding Modernism” 257). Thus, rather than thinking of cognition as a wholly individual process—what James Wertsch calls “individualistic reductionism” (qtd. in Herman, “Stories” 168)—we can think of cognition as actually “mediated action” (“Stories” 168). David Herman, Alan Palmer, and others argue that we should see the mind as “distributed,” understanding cognition not as “a wholly internal process unfolding within the minds of solitary, autonomous, and de-­situated cognizers,” but rather as a “transindividual activity distributed across groups functioning in specific contexts” (Herman, “Storytelling” 319). That is, cognition involves dynamic processes within an individual (emotion and reason, physiology and mind) and beyond the individual, who is in constant interaction with environment and history.6 Narratives of all kinds play an important role in shaping and mediating cognition. Herman writes, “Narrative, arguably, is at once a vehicle for and target of such distributed cognition, which is enabled by the shared construction and revision of stories, but which also eventuates in the fashioning and refashioning of accounts of how the world is, might be, or should be” (“Stories” 184). Cognitive approaches to film exam-\n\n20 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nine how and why viewers understand and become invested in a storyworld through the specific medium of cinema.7 Although some cognitive processes are similar to, for example, processing real-­life events and/or reading books (e.g., attributing underlying states of mind to the actions of others, or “mind reading”), viewers process and react to films on a variety of different levels unique to the medium. Not only does film use visuals and sound, but also by now film has as many generic conventions and norms as other art forms and modes of discourse. Even experimental films constitute a genre with norms (e.g., fans of David Lynch might have been more puzzled if Mulholland Drive had concluded by answering all the questions and tying up all the loose ends). Herman argues that stories themselves serve as important vehicles for thought itself, or “tools for thinking” (163–164); they train and retrain the brain to process information in a variety of socially impacted ways. In this chapter, I focus on three of the “problem-­solving activities” that Herman discusses: (1) “ ‘chunking’ experience into workable segments”; (2) “managing problems with the ‘typification’ of phenomena”; and (3) “imputing causal relations between events” (“Stories” 172).8 The latter two are specific instances of the first, but each particular cognitive process can be distinguished. I will explain briefly how each of these cognitive processes work and discuss them in relation to Rodriguez’s films, examining how these analytics can help us understand what is happening in the films and how the films can challenge and further refine our models of cognitive processes, which in the real world are inseparable from politics. In other words, we can better understand the cognitive processes involved by examining not only the content of the films, but also their form and the historical contexts that they refer to and draw upon. First, “chunking” is the basic cognitive process of separating “phenomenal reality into classifiable, knowable, and operable units,” of “extract[ing] from the stream of experience a delimited set of participants, states, actions, and events and structures into a coherent whole what might otherwise be reabsorbed back into the atelic and unbounded process of time’s passing” (Herman, “Stories” 174). We “chunk” in a variety of ways—temporally, visually, generically, modally, functionally, and so forth. One basic instance of chunking is reading English; I read and even write the words on this page not letter by letter (as I did when I was first learning to read) but word by word. My brain has been trained to chunk the individual letters and spaces into words as recognizable units; this “prechunking” enables me to process and recall information faster. If, however, I come across the word “DIEWELTISALLESWASDER-\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 21\n\nFALLIST,” I stop in my tracks; my brain has not been trained to automatically process such a conglomeration of letters. For the same reasons, most people can recall song lyrics (chunked into verses and choruses, linked to music and often rhyming) more readily than free-verse poetry. Herman argues that stories themselves are ways of chunking, both as a whole and in various ways within the story. He writes, [N]arrative affords representational tools for addressing the problem of how to chunk the ongoing stream of experience into bounded, cognizable, and thus usable structures. Stories organize experience by enabling people to select from among the total set of sequentially and concurrently available inputs; preprocess those inputs into internally differentiated chunks with . . . a beginning, middle, and end; and then use those temporally structured segments as a basis for further cognitive operations on new experiential inputs. (“Stories” 173)9\n\nExcellent (and entertaining) examples of chunking can be found early in El Mariachi. In the director’s commentary, Rodriguez gleefully explains some of the shortcuts they had to use due to lack of money. In the first jail scene, they simply cast the female guard who worked at the jail because it saved them the trouble of finding a real actress. They used a wheelchair borrowed from the hospital for a dolly shot (they had to hurry because the hospital needed it back). Rodriguez discusses how one of the actors, a local ranch hand, appears several times in the movie, in different disguises, as “bad guys” who are killed because of the dearth of actors. He points out a continuity problem in which, in one shot, the female guard’s hair is tied up, and then in a following shot, her hair is down: “This was one of those things where we knew that this movie was going to be cut so fast no one was going to notice things. So you’ll see that I take a lot of shortcuts. . . . [It] made me realize we can get away with a lot of things” (Robert Rodriguez). The first gunfight in a bar serves as a kind of case study in low-­budget filmmaking. Rodriguez details how they filled condoms with homemade dyed syrup and strapped them to the actors’ bodies. When the actors are shot, he points out how, if viewers pause the DVD, they can actually see the weight-­lifting belt holding the homemade squibs to the actor’s chest. The entire director’s commentary, during which Rodriguez talks nonstop, serves as a kind of “how-to” manual on low-­budget filmmaking.10 In other words, Rodriguez was able to make a film on a shoestring budget by drawing on the fact that our brains have been conditioned to chunk a series of film shots into a coherent narrative whole,\n\n22 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nwith consistent characters (or different ones, in the case of the ranch hand playing multiple bad guys) and plot developments, despite the fact that the filmmakers could not afford proper actors, special effects, equipment, or even a dolly. But in other ways, Rodriguez’s films “chunk” slightly differently from mainstream Hollywood or even many indie films in their form and content. That is, the films cannot use wholly idiosyncratic standards; then they would be unintelligible. But the films do make use of existing pieces to put together works that play exuberantly with conventions. One key way that Rodriguez’s films are unique is visual; even the critics of Rodriguez’s plot structuring ability acknowledge that his films have great cinematic verve. As Roger Ebert writes of Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Rodriguez is more interested in “great shots” and “camera work, which includes a lot of shots that are about themselves,” rather than “a coherent story.” Rodriguez “chunks” less by realism of the content than by the fun of cinematic form (shots, visuals, editing/juxtaposition). For instance, the opening scenes of Spy Kids 3 combine the conventions of film noir with a children’s movie. We first hear slow jazz music playing over several establishing shots of an empty water park, recalling both the opening scenes of The Maltese Falcon (shots of Sam Spade’s San Francisco) as well as the water park that featured prominently in Spy Kids 2. A high-­ angle shot (camera pointing downward) then shows litter (a brochure for “Agua Park”) and dead leaves on the ground, and a trench-­coated figure walks over the leaves as the wind blows. Then we hear the voice-­over by Juni Cortez (played by Daryl Sabara), a typical trait of film noir, using a pseudo-­hard-­boiled tone, examining the brochure (translating the agua as “water”), Juni says, “Cute. But I wasn’t here for cute. I was here because I’d gotten a call for my regular fee. $4.99.” He then describes himself as an “ex-­secret agent,” who’d been “burned by the agency,” and is now a “Private Eye” or “P.I.” Juni then approaches a well-­dressed (i.e., like a 1950s femme fatale) little girl (a very young Selena Gomez) who appears to be his client, and they speak to each other, although without making eye contact. This scene, which appears to us as one continuous unit, is a combination of disparate filmic conventions; in other words, individual film shots, music, lighting, dialogue, and other elements are “chunked” together into one apparently continuous scene while at the same time disrupting our usual categorizations and expectations. The ridiculousness of this conglomeration is what makes the scene amusing. For instance, when Juni describes himself as a detective, he makes a face of surprise; he looks down and calls himself a “gumshoe” at the very moment we see his\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 23\n\nshoe stuck in gum on the ground. Both “gumshoes” are appropriate to the genre (film noir and kiddie flick), but it is the combination that, using the term in the sense of the Russian formalists, “defamiliarizes” the conventions of both genres by mixing them unexpectedly together. Once we see such a combination of verbal and visual puns, moreover, we are partly conditioned to expect further, similarly silly chunkings. Such recombinations and revisions lead us to another specific type of chunking that Herman refers to as “typification.” We not only group things together (e.g., letters into words), but we also come to expect certain groupings, norms, and outcomes. Drawing on Alfred Schutz, Herman outlines the concept of typification, which serves a “broad variety of cognitive tasks—from the organization of objects into classes and members-­ of-­classes, to the learning of the lexical and syntactic patterns of a language, to the ascription of motives to others during social interaction. . . . The constant feature across all these tasks is the expectation-­creating modes of preprocessing that typification affords” (“Stories” 179). In other words, typification is a kind of shorthand we use (usually collectively and socially informed) for interpreting the world, which creates expectations and norms.11 For instance, we expect some conflict to arise early in a film (typical script for both adult action and children’s films). Since such norms are historically and socially conditioned, the issue of “typification” is not just an abstract mental function but can be an arena of political and cultural contestation. As such, Herman and others argue that narratives play a crucial role in both creating and revising typifications. He writes, “stories provide tools for solving the problem of how to balance expectations against outcomes, general patterns against particular instances—in short, the typical against the actual” (“Stories” 179). Stories not only shape what we see as normal and expected (forms of chunking to interpret the world) but also help account for things that do not fit into the norm. Herman writes, “Stories fill the breach when typification fails. . . . narrative is a means of redressing problems that arise when anticipated similar experiences do not materialize” (“Stories” 180).12 Furthermore, stories not only help explain deviations from typification; they also can challenge existing typifications and can thereby lead to new conventions and narratives, or new chunkings and prototypes.13 Herman writes, “the narrative representation of anomalous or atypical events can in turn reshape a culture’s or community’s sense of what is normal or typical, and thereby help build new models for understanding the world” (“Stories” 179). Stories can serve “retypifying” (building new norms) as well as “metatypifying” func-\n\n24 Matters of Mind and Media\n\ntions (question the bases for existing models and norms); that is, they may account for anomalies as well as question the basis upon which norms and prototypes are formed (179).14 Rodriguez’s films challenge typification in a number of ways related to form, content, and context. Most obviously, his films feature minorities (primarily Latinos), women, and children. Although the mere presence of people of color is hardly a revolutionary idea, the film (and television) industry still suffers from a shameful lack of minorities and women in front of and behind the camera. (See Charles Ramírez Berg’s Latino Images in Film.) Rodriguez’s films feature mixed-­race families (the Spy Kids series), Latino/as as both principal protagonists and antagonists (as opposed to the usual peripheral drug dealer or domestic worker), and women/girls as action heroes. Despite popular discussions of postfeminism and a “postracial” society, these are all things that we still do not see very often in most films.15 In shows like Law & Order and even the otherwise superlative Breaking Bad, Latino/as usually appear as depthless drug dealers and criminals (or service workers). Although many of Rodriguez’s female characters in the adult films are hypersexualized (in accordance with genre conventions), many of his prominent female characters in the children’s films are not: Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino), Demetra, Gerti Giggles, Lavagirl, Marissa Electricidad, and Marissa Wilson. In Shorts, although the protagonist, Toby Thompson (Jimmy Bennett), is a white male, the film also features the great Helvetica Black (played by Jolie Vanier, with a ridiculously catchy theme song) as the main antagonist/protagonist.16 Another of my favorite scenes comes from early in Spy Kids 4D, when very pregnant spy Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba), in hot pursuit of a villain, struggles to slide over the hood of a car. That is certainly not something we see every day. The form of Rodriguez’s films also questions the generally realist bent of Hollywood (and many indie) films by incorporating a myriad of forms. Rodriguez incorporates not only the formal elements of B-­films (quick cuts, fast dialogue, outsized action) but also the production ethic (fast and cheap). He uses elements of exploitation films (e.g., sexploitation and Mexploitation in Machete); narcotraficante films, a Mexican police genre that was widely popular in Spanish-­speaking film markets during the 1980s (Berg 226–227); spaghetti westerns (the Mariachi trilogy); video games (Spy Kids 3-­D); graphic novels (Sin City); and cartoons. Spy Kids 4D even included “aromascope” (i.e., in the tradition of “Smell-­O-­Vision”) in theaters. Behind the camera—or about the camera itself—Rodriguez also works to revise what we expect as norms. Rodriguez was one of the first\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 25\n\nproponents of digital filmmaking, which is cheaper and more accessible to anyone with a good computer and the right software. He cofounded Troublemaker Studios (originally Los Hooligans Productions) with producer (and former spouse) Elizabeth Avellán and introduced U.S. audiences to Salma Hayek, two of the few (but growing number of) women— let alone Latinas—with clout in the U.S. film industry.17 Rodriguez’s filmic universe challenges the dominant view of the world, not only in including minorities and women on-­screen and beyond, but also in the form of the films: fans of pop culture and the immature, trashy, and tasteless are all included in this universe. As Pierre Bourdieu wrote, “Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier” (6); Rodriguez’s films question the “metatypification” between high art and trash. At the same time, however, it is not just the atypicality of his films that makes his movies appealing. Rather, the particular combination of elements is what makes his films entertaining and interesting—for example, Latina Jessica Alba playing a pregnant spy in a scene that tweaks the conventions of action films (sliding needlessly over the hood of a car) in a children’s film that incorporates not only cartoonish elements (a talking dog! voiced by Ricky Gervais!) but also smell. Rodriguez’s films are, again, not necessarily revolutionary, but since what we see as typical or even possible is shaped in part by stories, narrative changes—even and especially in popular culture—can be linked to changes in how and even what we can think. What does a hero or villain look like? Who can be a film producer or director (i.e., who can tell the stories)? What even constitutes a movie? Because such typifications matter, revisions to the expected types are central to changing how we think about the possibilities of our world. Another form of chunking, cause and effect, involves joining objects and events together over time. As Herman writes, “One of the hallmarks of narrative is its linking of phenomena into causal-­chronological wholes; stories provide structure for connecting otherwise isolated data into elements of episodes or scenes” (“Stories” 170). The links between scenes and events do not have to be explicitly explained for us to attribute causal connections. Stories not only rely on our ability to relate cause and effect but also train us to link them together; thus, our “predisposition to find causal links between states, actions, and events in a sequentially presented way” is a form of cognitive “chunking” that is ingrained in us via stories in a social environment (“Stories” 176). Put another way, cause and effect is a heuristic for interpreting the series of words and events (in the case of film), visuals, and sounds that are presented to us. Rodriguez’s films play with our usual expectations of cause and effect,\n\n26 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nand they offer alternative cause-­and-­effect relationships. For instance, not only are the events in Shorts not presented chronologically, they are not even really linked by cause and effect (just the journey of the rainbow-­ colored wishing rock). This looseness of cause and effect has led some to critique Rodriguez; for instance, the plot of Once Upon a Time in Mexico has been described as “a maze” and “a convolution” (Travers, Once, and Winter, respectively, although Hartlaub describes the plot as “clever”). A. O. Scott of the New York Times writes that although Once Upon a Time in Mexico displays Rodriguez’s “inventive eye,” “ability to infuse digital video, so often flat and grainy, with uncommon depth and luster,” and action sequences of “eye-­popping flair,” “[t]he only thing missing is a coherent story—or even, for that matter, an interesting idea for one.” But the plots and emotional responses to the films are not limited to what happens in the story; as I will discuss in the next section, a good deal of the investment in the films comes less from investment in the characters as “real” (although they are not, however, wholly ironic) and more from the form (references to and play with generic conventions and technical innovations) and the cultural contexts (status of minorities, women, genre, and tastefulness/tastelessness) in which the films function. For instance, despite the flawed logic of the plots of many of the children’s films, I prefer them to the adult action films because they are interested in identifying the causes for the antagonists’ evildoing. Granted, the insights are not often earth-­shattering: Spy Kids’ Floop just wants to make a truly inventive, quality TV show; Spy Kids 2’s Gary and Gerti Giggles just want their father’s approval and attention, as does Helvetica Black in Shorts; in Spy Kids 3-­D, the Toymaker wants forgiveness; in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Minus wants better dreams; and in Spy Kids 4D, the Time Keeper just wants people to treasure the time they have with their families. Nevertheless, the recuperative plotlines for the villains suggest that addressable reasons exist for their discontent and antagonism. Similarly, the adult films—primarily the Mexico trilogy and Machete—show that immigration, the drug trade, and U.S. political, commercial, and cultural neo-­imperialism affect everyone—white and minority, male and female, young and old, on both sides of the U.S.–Mexican border (as opposed to being a menace by foreign others or domestic criminal elements). Albeit stylized (and arguably exploitative), the stories that Rodriguez tells go beyond the great white wall of Hollywood. That is, if the ways that we make cause-­and-­effect links are conditioned in part by fictional stories, then the predominant narratives we see from Hollywood and on television tell us that minorities and others (the poor, women, criminals) are simply vil-\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 27\n\nlainous and/or inscrutable, and we might not even realize different causes and effects exist. In these ways, Rodriguez’s films’ storyworlds combine “outsider” film genres and “outsider” politics, particularly on issues of race, in ways that both draw on existing ways of chunking, typification, and linking cause and effect, as well as prod us to think in slightly different ways. As ethnic studies and feminist film critics have been pointing out for years, the stereotypes and ideological messages we receive from films wreak serious damage. Understanding these processes in terms of how our minds function helps explain why ideological conditioning works, how we can change them, and why the work of a particular filmmaker, such as Rodriguez, appeals to various audiences.\n\nFilm Emotions as Fiction, Artifact, and Context Just as cognition is not wholly individual, emotion (as linked to and even part of cognition) is also not separable from social relations and history.18 In cognitive psychology, as Patrick Colm Hogan and others have discussed, appraisal theory is a predominant approach to emotions. In classical appraisal theories, “emotion results from a type of evaluation in which one judges the implications of a certain situation,” usually in relation to achieving some goal, and the emotion helps us to organize information and decide on actions (Hogan, Cognitive Science 140–141). In terms of film, the viewer may experience emotions that arise from identification with a character (usually the protagonist) and/or from the viewer’s “preferred outcome” for the character (Hogan, Cognitive Science 149); for example, I am angry when the protagonist suffers an injustice and happy when he or she overcomes obstacles to achieve a goal. Many further distinctions come into play; for instance, Frijda argues that action outcomes are part of appraisal while Ortony and others claim that action responses are not necessary for an appraisal that leads to emotion. Other researchers have discussed the role of memory and empathy in viewers’ reactions.19 While the details of such approaches vary, appraisal theory arises out of understanding reason and emotion not as mutually exclusive processes, but rather complexly interwoven processes that occur in the brain and the body.20 In examining emotion-­as-­appraisal in film, Ed Tan distinguishes between what he calls “fiction emotions” and “artifact emotions.” Fiction emotions are emotions evoked by the viewer’s immersion in the film story-\n\n28 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nworld, while artifact emotions are elicited by the experience of the film as an intentionally constructed art object. Tan argues that fiction emotions arise out of the “diegetic effect,” which is the viewer’s “experience of the fictional world as the environment” and “the illusion of being present in the fictional world” (52). Of course, we know what we are watching is not real, and as film scholars we also know that film is not a neutral or nonmediated medium. Nevertheless, Tan argues that the primary emotional impact of film for most viewers stems from the viewer’s investment in the characters and events in the “fictional world” or “storyworld.” He summarizes the diegetic effect’s influence on emotion: “the situational meaning structure in film viewing is related primarily to the situation in the fictional world. . . . Viewers experience the fictional events as if they were happening all around them; the events appear to be real, concrete, and taking place in the here and now” (Tan 53). Thus, the element of “appraisal” in film viewers’ emotions functions similarly to but slightly different from appraisal about one’s own goals, situations, and so forth. As film viewers, we do not believe these events are really taking place; rather, we experience “witness emotions,” in which the film viewer feels emotions based on the achievement or obstruction of goals for the protagonist(s). These usually are not as strong as real-­world emotions, but they may be, depending on the particular issues, values, and emotions at work. Oatley notes that the appeal of fictional story derives both from the excitation of our emotions and our immunity from harm. He writes, “In the theory of sympathetic emotions, our enjoyment of a fictional story derives from entering a narrative world in which we feel for those who suffer certain events. But we’re immunized from harmful effects of the events on our own person or on loved ones. By following the story, we achieve the satisfaction of narrative closure” (Oatley 160). Thus even fear and anxiety are pleasurable experiences because the viewer experiences tension and resolution without risking anything (which again is part of the appeal). But Tan also goes on to describe artifact emotions, which arise from the viewer’s experience of the artfulness of the film, such as pleasure in a swirling camera shot or musical soundtrack. He writes, “[T]he traditional feature film makes it clear to the audience that there is an editorial intelligence at work . . . , who has carefully ordered the events that they are viewing. As soon as they are aware, no matter how fleetingly, of the operation of that intelligence, they are in that instant aware of the film as artifact” (65). Because he focuses on realist film, for Tan artifact emotions are usually negative, indicating an aberration that indicates a break in the\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 29\n\nillusion (e.g., a love scene has gone on too long or a boom microphone accidentally enters the frame). Tan argues that these two levels of emotional responses—fiction emotions and artifact emotions—work together dynamically to create interest, which Tan (following Frijda) identifies as an emotion. So even though he touches on the role of film as artifact, his account focuses on fiction emotions. Drawing on but departing slightly from Tan’s conclusions, Greg Smith argues that film works to elicit emotion by creating “mood,” which thereby conditions the viewer to experience more intense, briefer emotions proper, which in turn help to sustain the overall mood. Smith calls this understanding the “mood-­cue approach.” Smith describes “moods” as “a longer-­lasting but less forceful emotional state with an orienting function that encourages us to express a particular group of emotions” (38). According to Smith, this filmic mood-­cue approach works in two stages. First, “emotion cues” at the beginning of a film create an “emotional orientation” toward the film as a whole; then the body of the film supplies a “periodic diet of brief emotional moments. . . . to sustain a mood” (44). This general mood interacts with the stronger, punctual emotions throughout the film to produce the viewer’s emotional experience. Smith continues, “Filmic cues that can provide emotional information include facial expressions, figure movement, dialogue, vocal expression and tone, costume, sound, music, lighting, mise-­en-­scène, set design, editing, camera. . . . , depth of field, character qualities and histories, and narrative situation” (43). In other words, Smith identifies a more fluid affective-­orienting zone somewhat in between Tan’s fiction and artifact emotions, and Smith accounts more for the formal elements of film in bringing about affective responses from viewers. Bringing Tan’s and Smith’s approaches to emotion in film into conversation with Rodriguez’s films illuminates similarities between his films and other considerations that impact film and emotion. As with many other feature films, Rodriguez’s films offer a way for viewers to experience emotions without any real risk to themselves. But it would be difficult to say that the emotional impacts of Rodriguez’s films arise more from the fiction emotions than the film as artifact. Rodriguez’s films clearly indicate both that the characters are truly invested in their own storyworld (diegetic level) while also that viewers should take an ironic relation to the film. The mood cues in Rodriguez’s films—dialogue, sound, composition, editing, camera angles, and so forth—exaggerate the formal and stylistic filmic elements to the extent that artifact emotions interact in complicated ways with fiction emotions. It is not that the fiction emotions do\n\n30 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nnot matter—for instance, the characters do not break the fourth wall to indicate that they know their world is not real—but many viewers’ emotional responses do not arise simply from investment in the fortunes of the protagonists and their struggles. This dynamic is as true in Machete as in Spy Kids 3-D.21 In fact, in many of Rodriguez’s films, while the outcome is never really in doubt, the story is nevertheless important. The viewer’s emotional investment in the narrative may not arise from the viewer’s immersion in the storyworld so much as the narrative’s reference to extratextual, real-­world phenomena like racism, immigration/border issues, multiracial families, globalization, patriarchy/feminism, and so forth. For instance, viewers’ reactions to El Mariachi and Machete register at the level of content (investment in the characters’ world), form (self-­conscious references to and ironic plays on cinematic predecessors), and context (e.g., the economic and cultural devastation wrought by the drug trade in Mexico and the right-­wing anti-­immigrant crusade). Such reaction is also applicable to films such as the Spy Kids series; although they do not refer as explicitly to highly charged political issues as Machete, we have young Latino protagonists, the mixed-­race family, and the appearance of Rodriguez’s frequent stars Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Danny Trejo. We can see this particularly in relation to how violence works in the films. Like his sometimes collaborator Quentin Tarantino, Rodriguez is known for his use of hyperstylized violence. As F. L. Aldama has put it, Rodriguez is a “comic book director” (“Adventures”), drawing on techniques from B-­movie grindhouse films, exploitation films, narcotraficante films, and action movies (ranging from Bruce Lee to Steven Seagal to Chow Yun-­Fat), to depict various kinds of comic-­book-­like violence. Whether in El Mariachi or Spy Kids, the violence is so hyperstylized that it becomes denaturalized. As Claudia Puig writes of Once Upon a Time in Mexico, “Plenty of blood is shed, lots of powerful artillery is fired, and action sequences provide astounding car crashes and fiery explosions. But Rodriguez is such a visual stylist, and the violence is so cartoonish, that the flurry of whizzing bullets and growing pile of bodies is not as offensive as it might be.” For instance, the first gunfight in the bar in El Mariachi, discussed above, is serious for the characters, but viewers can react to it on a number of levels. The first is on the level of diegesis, or identifying with the characters. But some viewers—including myself—react to Rodriguez’s budget filmmaking ingenuity as much as or even more than to the diegetic events. The relations between the films’ stylized violence and the\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 31\n\nemotions that viewers experience are complicated and myriad. When I watch El Mariachi (and even more so Rodriguez’s later films), I do not react to the violence in the same way as if I were actually being attacked or if I were witnessing real violence. I understand that the violence is “serious” for the characters at their diegetic level, but my relationship to violence in Rodriguez’s films is complicated. I experience pleasure at Rodriguez’s ingenuity in crafting the scene with little resources, and, given my critique of Hollywood, I also take pleasure from the context of the film (shot outside Hollywood for very little money, a model for other independent filmmakers). In other words, the hyperstylized violence can elicit complicated emotional responses that draw not only on the fiction and artifact emotions and mood cues, but also on various other intertextual and contextual elements. Political views, personal experiences, and aesthetic values all inform the reaction to the fiction and the form. Likewise, in the kids’ films, much of the action sequences are digital; in Shorts or Sharkboy and Lavagirl, I experience amusement at visuals during the children’s battles against Carbon Black (the children transform digitally into wasps, dung beetles, and other creatures) and against Mr. Electric. Diegetically, or in the storyworld, these battles are “real,” but I do not feel any sense of threat or anxiety; rather, the presentations of worlds in which children can transform into bugs or in which children rule the ocean and lava are what engage and entertain. Another example comes from a scene towards the end of Machete, which produces some kinds of emotions but not quite in the ways that Tan and Smith have outlined. In the film, Machete is a former Mexican federale, who retires after his wife is killed by a drug lord, Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal). Machete is hired to assassinate the virulently and violently anti-­immigrant Senator John McLaughlin, played by Robert De Niro, although, as we find out, the supposed assassination is meant to actually frame Machete and help the Senator’s political polls. Machete is aided by Luz, played by Michelle Rodriguez, who works with an immigrant aid movement known as “the Network.” She uses a taco truck as cover for the Network. Luz may also be “Shé,” the leader of the Network, who is planning an uprising against the anti-­immigrant forces. We believe her to have died, having seen her shot in the eye earlier. But in this scene towards the end of the movie, Machete and the Mexican immigrants go head-­to-­head in a battle against the anti-­immigrant border vigilantes at the latter’s compound. During the over-­the-­top fight scene, a hospital ambulance zooms into the compound and a doctor and two buxom nurses, with extremely short skirts and high heels, burst out and mow down the\n\n32 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nvigilantes with machine guns. The back door of the ambulance then slowly opens as an electric guitar starts to play in the manner befitting a Charles Bronson film. Rodriguez, now clad in a black leather bra, pants, and an eye patch, emerges in slow motion from the ambulance. As she walks into the battle, the doctor asks her, “How’s the eye?” and Rodriguez replies stoically, “What eye?” From the beginning of the film, the mood cues clearly indicate an ironic distance from the events; Machete is an homage to narcotraficante films, Mexploitation and sexploitation films (in the tradition of Russ Meyer), vigilante films, grindhouse films—cheap B-­movies churned out to appeal to a particular demographic and/or cash in on a particular cultural fad. But the film is also referring to extratextual issues that are very real, including anti-­immigrant racism, labor exploitation, and Machiavellian political manipulation of these issues. Some viewers’ emotional response to the film may be informed by the desire for resistance and punishment against the anti-­immigrant forces; other viewers may feel repelled that Rodriguez is using these issues for a commercial film; and some viewers may be ambivalently divided between both feelings. Some viewers may simply be aroused by the sexy nurses and Luz’s incredible belly-­baring leather outfit while others may be bored by the lack of character development. In other words, our response exceeds the level of fiction emotions (what happens to Machete and Luz against the racist anti-­immigrants) but is not limited to the level of film as artifact. Our reactions, emotional and otherwise, are conditioned by myriad other social–political, historical, and aesthetic considerations. By the same token, the end of Spy Kids 3-­D evokes emotions that are not limited to the diegesis. The Toymaker, played by Sylvester Stallone, had been banished to cyberspace by the OSS (Organization of Super Spies) for his previous crimes; having escaped, he now attacks a real city using an army of robots. All the previous characters from the previous Spy Kids films show up to help fight the robots, including parents Ingrid (Carla Gugino) and Gregorio Cortez (Antonio Banderas), grandmother Helga Avellan (Holland Taylor), Uncle Machete (Danny Trejo), “Uncle” Felix (Cheech Marin), mad scientist Romero (Steve Buscemi), amusement park owner Dinky Winks (Bill Paxton), and former villains Floop (Alan Cumming), Minion (Tony Shalhoub), and Donnagon Giggles (Mike Judge), along with his wife Francesca Giggles (Salma Hayek) and children Gerti and Gary Giggles. After a CGI-­enhanced fight scene, one giant robot remains, controlled by the Toymaker, and Carmen and Juni Cortez’s wheelchair-­bound grandfather Valentin Avellan, played by\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 33\n\nRicardo Montalbán, enters the robot for a final showdown. But instead of a grand battle, Valentin tells the Toymaker that although he (the Toymaker) lashes out due to guilt and fear of retribution for putting Valentin in the wheelchair many years ago, “Now, let me tell you all the good things that came of it: humility, spirituality, understanding. You’ve been living in fear of me all these years, but I’ve only been searching for you so I could tell you that I forgive you.” Valentin then persuades the Toymaker to forgive himself, and the Toymaker calls off the giant robot. As Valentin and the Toymaker emerge in peace, Donnagon asks, “So, wait a minute. Who won?” Valentin responds, “It’s not whether you win or lose,” and the Toymaker concludes, “It’s how you play the game.” The film ends with all the characters—heroes, villains, and secondary characters—joining in a paean to (extended) family. Some of the emotions evoked by this scene derive from the story; despite the CGI “violence,” everybody ends up friends, inviting warm and fuzzy feelings. But part of the response arises from extradiegetic elements, particularly the high caliber of actors, all appearing in this comic strip film. Antonio Banderas mugs it up and appears to be having a great time, as he does throughout the first three Spy Kids films; this element of sublime ridiculousness, in conjunction with the no-­stakes, digital cartoon “violence” and unexpected cameos by famous actors, elicits affective responses—amusement, interest, perhaps puzzlement or irritation. Disability also constitutes a context; audiences may respond positively or negatively to Valentin’s recasting of being wheelchair-­bound as a strength. In these ways, Rodriguez’s films suggest that there are more dimensions to emotional experience than those outlined by Tan and Smith, although their insights are also operative and useful. Viewers’ reactions to a film like Machete, despite and perhaps because of its status as ironic homage to all kinds of exploitation films (border films, sexploitation films, violence, etc.), may trouble the distinction between “witness emotions” and emotions-­for-­oneself, as well as between “fiction emotions” and “artifact emotions.” If one is an immigrant, then racial profiling, incarceration, and/or deportation may not be abstract dangers, even if the events in the film are recognized as fictional and not threatening. Likewise, if one is a child, the sense of powerlessness in an enigmatic and sometimes dangerous and/or painful adult world may not be a fiction, even if the child recognizes that the film’s storyworld is not real. Furthermore, Spy Kids 3-­D appeals to viewers through the visuals as much as the story, and it may tickle some adult viewers for additional extratextual reasons (Ricardo Montalbán! Sylvester Stallone!?). Viewers’ responses may be historical in\n\n34 Matters of Mind and Media\n\na number of senses; individual memories of past events can haunt and inform emotions in the present, and also collective memories and experiences can shape feelings about a narrative (positively or negatively). Political and historical events may inform emotional responses to a film, but so can filmic history, particularly Rodriguez’s films that ostentatiously refer to styles and genres of film. And these considerations may interact in a variety of ways; for example, Rodriguez’s recurrent use of actors Salma Hayek and Danny Trejo, even in films without such overt political references (such as Spy Kids), refers intertextually to his other films that do deal explicitly with border issues and refers beyond the films not only to the political issues in general, but also to Rodriguez, Hayek, and Trejo’s professed political stances (particularly on immigration). Our sense of the director impacts our response to the film with respect to not just our sense of Rodriguez as auteur, but also of his sociohistorical location and that of his casts and crews.22 Examining the range of possible cognitive and emotional operations involved in Rodriguez’s films troubles individualist assumptions about how we think and feel, and it can suggest further directions for research into the dynamics of cognition, emotion, diegetic content, cinematic form, and context. If stories constitute tools for thinking, and stories are culturally and historically shaped, then the cognitive processes involved in storytelling (or films) can be arenas of ideological contestation. Likewise, feelings are historically situated, political processes that operate even while interacting with the most seemingly childish or “tasteless” films. To paraphrase how Rebecca, the protagonist of Rodriguez’s early short film “Bedhead,” puts it, we all have cognitive powers of thinking and feeling in a historically shaped, social–political world, and in telling our stories— which include scholarly accounts—we can strive to use them responsibly towards a better world.\n\nNotes Earlier versions of this chapter were presented at the March 2012 International Conference on Narrative in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in the American Studies I.D.E.A. working group at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, in April 2012. I thank all the participants for their helpful feedback. 1. In 2005, Rodriguez codirected with Frank Miller the film adaptation of Miller’s graphic novel Sin City. Rodriguez has also collaborated a number of times with Quentin Tarantino, first in the genre-­bending From Dusk till Dawn (1996) and then in the Planet Terror portion of the Grindhouse homage (2007). In this\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 35\n\nchapter, I focus on Rodriguez’s solo-­directed films (many of which he also produces, writes, edits, and writes/plays music for). 2. For further debates on the politics of Rodriguez’s films, see Ramírez Berg (Latino Images in Film); Cameron; Flanagan; Leen; and Torres. 3. See chapter 10, interview with Rodriguez, in Ramírez Berg (Latino Images in Film). 4. Whereas psychoanalytic approaches to film have been predominant in film studies, recent decades have seen the flourishing of alternative approaches to film, particularly in relation to the cognitive sciences and psychology. For an introduction to some central issues, see Stam and Miller; for the most tendentious exchanges, see Bordwell and Carroll as well as Žižek. 5. For more sources on the history of cognitive studies, see F. L. Aldama, Toward; Hogan, Cognitive Science; Herman, Story Logic; G. A. Miller; Richardson and Spolsky; and Zunshine, Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies. 6. See also Hogan, Cognitive Science, chapter 2, for more on the “cognitive architecture” that cognitivists work to figure out and situate. 7. David Herman defines “storyworld” as “mental models of who did what to and with whom, when, where, why, and in what fashion in the world to which recipients relocate—or make a deictic shift—as they work to comprehend a narrative” (Story Logic 5). This term has come into use in narrative theory because it attempts to account for multiple dimensions, not just temporal order; Herman writes, “In trying to make sense of a narrative, interpreters attempt to reconstruct not just what happened . . . but also the surrounding context or environment embedded existents, their attributes, and the actions and events in which they are more or less centrally involved” (Story Logic 13–14). 8. The other two that Herman discusses in “Stories as a Tool for Thinking” are “sequencing” and “distributing intelligence across groups” (172). 9. Even stories not using normal temporal progression use some form of “chunking”—thematically, associatively, etc. But such texts tend to be more challenging to most readers precisely because non-­conventional narratives challenge the “chunking” patterns of conventional narratives. 10. Rodriguez has a series of “Ten Minute Film School” clips on his various DVD releases in which he discusses other techniques for low-­budget filmmaking. 11. Typification is a broader concept that can also include “prototypes.” A “prototype” is a “a sort of concretization of the schema with all default values in place” (58). A schema is a “hierarchy of principles defining a lexical term” (Hogan, The Mind and Its Stories 57); in other words, a schema is the essential requirements for a thing, its definition. But because prototypes “vary with context” (we always encounter them in some context), Hogan adds that what we actually encounter are “prototype effects,” rather than pure prototypes. So, for instance, a “schema” for a cat may be a small, domesticated mammal that walks on all four legs and has soft fur, whiskers, and retractable claws. The prototype for a cat is the image of a cat that pops into your head when you hear the word or that may appear as an icon for your desktop—or rather, these are “prototype effects,” because we always encounter the expectation/norm in some context. Furthermore, the prototypes and schema are obviously open to revision; there exist cats without fur, without claws, without whiskers, and without all four legs, and yet we would still classify them as\n\n36 Matters of Mind and Media\n\ncats. Hogan (The Mind and Its Stories) and Herman (“Stories”) argue that stories help us both create and revise such norms and expectations. 12. In fact, nontypicality is arguably what makes a story worth telling. If I tell you that my cat coughed up a hair ball, neither of us would consider this story very riveting; if, however, I tell you that my cat coughed up a hair ball made of gold—that would be a “tellable” story. 13. For instance, the Russian formalists’ account of automatization and defamiliarization of narrative forms is itself a kind of narrative that helps to account for innovations in literary form. Once we understand their account of the “evolution” of literary forms, nontypical narratives may become less abnormal and, in fact, can become conventional themselves. 14. Herman’s example is an oral story about a shape-­shifter; the story questions the boundaries between human and animal, as well as natural and supernatural. 15. For further discussion of the lack of women and minorities in films (and television), see Goldberg; Johnson; Martins and Harrison; and Sarkeesian, among many others. 16. The whiteness of Toby Thompson’s family can perhaps be read as critique of white upper-­middle-­class obsession with techno-­consumerism. 17. Avellán was inducted into the Texas Film Hall of Fame in 2007 as the first recipient of the Ann Richards Award and has gone on to produce films on her own (Internet Movie). 18. Physiological processes form part of the equation, but as F. L. Aldama argues: “[N]o matter how personal emotions are as bodily experience and subjective feeling, they are also interpersonal and social. Emotions are part and parcel of the social tissue in that they are present in the way people connect with each other and treat each other as members of society and, more generally, the human race. They join and attach individuals, they separate and antagonize them, and they function as a social tool” (F. A. Aldama, “Putting” 137–138). Attempting to mediate between, on the one hand, wholly universalist, physiological, and/or ahistorical accounts of emotions and, on the other hand, culturally relativist and/or strict constructivist accounts of emotion, David Herman theorizes “emotionologies,” or “the collective emotional standards of a culture as opposed to the experience of emotion itself ” (“Storytelling” 322). Narratives do not just emerge from existing cultural emotionologies; they also serve to instill, shape, and police those emotional understandings (324–325). 19. Appraisal is not the only model and not without controversy, but the debate is too complex to explore here. For further information, see Dagleish and Power; Evans and Cruse; Frijda; Lane and Nadel; and Ortony, Clore, and Collins. 20. The many debates over the definitions and delineations between different kinds and intensities of emotion are too many to get into here. For instance, Brian Massumi distinguishes between affect, which is “unformed and unstructured,” and emotions, which have “function and meaning” (260), whereas Frijda defines “emotions” as a motivational state linked to appraisal and action (The Emotions). For the purposes of this chapter, I use a broad definition of “emotion” to refer to any affective reaction to film. 21. Despite the special effects, Rodriguez’s alien/horror/teen flick The Faculty (1998) is arguably one of the most self-­consciously stylized of his films; on the sur-\n\nFrom El Mariachi till Spy Kids? A Cognitive Approach 37\n\nface, it appears to be a simple aliens-­take-­over-­a-­high-­school film. Yet discussions of the film, by professional reviewers as well as fans, involve a range of intertextual and contextual considerations, ranging from comparisons to Rodriguez’s previous films as well as the lack of Latino characters/actors (except Salma Hayek as a school nurse). 22. That we do not do so as often with white male directors suggests that the continuing unmarked privileged term still often serves as the norm.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nYou’ve Come a Long Way, Booger Breath: Juni Cortez Grows Up in the Spy Kids Films Phillip Serrato\n\nRobert Rodriguez brings to the silver screen the character Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) in his Spy Kids series of films, Spy Kids (2001), Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams (2002), Spy Kids 3-­D: Game Over (2003), and Spy Kids: All The Time in the World (2011). With this character, audiences witness the development of boy to man both as character and as actor. Initially, the boy Juni struggles to arrive at a confident sense of self. Feelings of inferiority, isolation, and abjection besiege him for most of the original trilogy and devastate his dignity and self-­esteem.1 By the end of the third film, however, audiences see a boy who has negotiated the assorted challenges that had previously made his childhood a particularly stressful experience. Upon his successful completion of the mission assigned to him in this film, Juni emerges with a respectability that had formerly eluded him. Most recently, the appearance of Juni as an adult in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World seems to round out the dramatization of his transformation from an abject little boy to an accomplished man. In this fourth installment, Juni is introduced as embodying the self-­confidence, emotional invulnerability, and professional distinction typically associated with— and expected of—mature masculinity. At first glance, the transformation of Juni over the course of the series seems to leave intact dominant ideals of masculinity. The trajectory of the films seems to privilege his development into an accomplished and respected young man. But in the fourth film it eventually emerges (in classic Robert Rodriguez fashion) that appearances are not what they seem. By the end of the fourth film, normative masculinity turns out to be more elusive, illusory, and undesirable than one might realize. In effect, what had, in the span of the original trilogy, been a fantasy of a disempowered\n\n40 Matters of Mind and Media\n\nboy’s rise to prominence, empowerment, and “proper” masculinity gives way to skepticism about this fantasy and a destabilization of the masculine ideals that it entails.\n\nUp from Abjection The first Spy Kids installment introduces audiences to Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) and their children, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni. According to a backstory provided in the form of a bedtime tale that Ingrid tells the children at the start of the film, Gregorio and Ingrid once worked for opposing spy agencies. When, by a twist of fate, each is assigned to assassinate the other, they end up falling in love. Of course they marry, and when they do, they retire from spy work so they can focus their energies on raising their children. Amidst the relative doldrums of domesticity, the two accept a mission that requires them to venture to the castle of Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), the host of the popular children’s television program Floop’s Fooglies. Floop, it turns out, is working on the side as a contractor for Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick), a villain who has hired Floop to create a robot army that will help him take over the world. Apparently, a number of spies from the OSS spy agency have tried to foil Floop’s work only to end up captured by Floop and transformed into one of his Fooglies, the bizarre characters who serve as Floop’s sidekicks on his show. When Gregorio and Ingrid return to action to stop Floop and Lisp and rescue the captured agents, they too are caught and detained by Floop. It then befalls Juni and his big sister to travel to Floop’s island and save their parents. While the circumstances within which Carmen and Juni find themselves set the stage for the possible maturation and empowerment of both characters, the film is primarily organized around Juni’s development of courage and self-­reliance. The empowerment that Juni exhibits by the end of this first film constitutes a dramatic change from his condition at the start. In the film’s opening sequence, viewers find him in the bathroom, a space intrinsically associated—especially in childhood—with shame and the abject. With a dejected expression that bespeaks a compromised self-­esteem, Juni stands before a mirror applying drops of medicine to the numerous warts that dot his fingers (see figure 1). Clearly, the eruptions on his fingers signify for him his abjection vis-­à-­vis his apparent aberration from normative, implicitly hygienic embodiment. That he is standing in front of a mirror and contemplating his image while he tends to his fingers is a crucial detail;\n\nJuni C"
