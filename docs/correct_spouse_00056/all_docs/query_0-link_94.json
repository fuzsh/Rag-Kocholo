        "text": "The\n\nfirst time I saw Rose McGowan was in the outrageously f*cked up\n\nlittle film called THE DOOM GENERATION. I was blown away by her utterly unbelievably assured sense of\n\nhumor and crude charm. This\n\ngirl was one to watch. Soon\n\nafter that, she made for one of the best horror victims ever in\n\nSCREAM and soon had many copycats of the tough chick who ends up\n\nbiting it. For awhile,\n\nit seemed she would become a b-movie queen with DEVIL IN THE FLESH\n\nand JAWBREAKER.\n\nThen\n\nthere was TV’s “Charmed” where she replaced Shannen Doherty and\n\nshe stayed for five seasons. And\n\nnow, thanks to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino she gets to\n\nkick some serious ass with a machine gun leg. In GRINDHOUSE,\n\nshe gives one helluva performance. Her\n\nwork in PLANET TERROR is nothing short of amazing, bringing real\n\ndepth and edge to Cherry Darling, along with an all-star cast that\n\nmake GRINDHOUSE one of the most outrageous movie experiences you\n\nwill have this year.\n\nWell,\n\nlucky for me, I got a chance to go one-on-one with Ms.\n\nMcGowan for the second time. With\n\nthe release of JAWBREAKER, I had dragged my wife just to get\n\nRose’s autograph — I’ve\n\ngot a very cool wife. Back\n\nthen, she was incredibly nice and charming. So it was no surprise that she is not only beautiful, but she\n\nis also smart, funny, and every other positive thing that I could\n\nthink of. Yes, I’m a fan and\n\nafter sitting down to talk about movies, celebrity, running around\n\nwith a machine gun leg and some dude dragging his wife with him to\n\nget her autograph, I had an fantastic time.\n\nRose\n\nis very outspoken and honest but there is no pretension here. Hey, she offered me some coffee when I arrived. I was a fan of hers before, and now she is just an awesome\n\nlady that I feel very lucky to have been able to hang out and shoot\n\nthe shit with. And as for\n\nCherry Darling… there is something very sexy about a woman with a\n\nmachine gun leg and a killer survival instinct… Is that wrong? You won’t think so when you see GRINDHOUSE.\n\nRose\n\nMcGowan\n\nSo\n\nI’ve gotta tell you something. About the time of “Jawbreaker” I made my wife drive over\n\nan hour to\n\nCosta Mesa\n\n[\n\nCalifornia\n\n] just to have you sign an autograph.\n\nAwww…\n\nwas I in the…?\n\nRemember,\n\nthe mall…?\n\nWas\n\nthat\n\nOrange\n\nCounty\n\n?\n\nYes.\n\nI\n\nthink that’s the only time I’ve ever done a signing anywhere.\n\nYeah\n\nand I said, ‘You know honey… we have to go… I mean, we HAVE to go.’ [A high five happens] And it’s my birthday tomorrow…\n\nHappy\n\nbirthday… kick ass!\n\nSo\n\nit’s a great weekend.\n\nI\n\nlove Courtney Shane [Her character from “Jawbreaker”], she was\n\nhilarious. She was very\n\nmisunderstood. People\n\nsaid she was so evil and I say, well, she was just a sociopath. And not to let sociopaths off the hook because O.J. [Simpson]\n\ncertainly did it, but he doesn’t think he did it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd\n\npeople are like, she was diabolical… yes, but accidentally. She didn’t think so. I\n\nactually based it on a Gene Tierney character in “Leave Her to\n\nHeaven”.\n\nReally?\n\nAnd\n\nshe… it was just beautifully shot, really funny movie, I mean not\n\nfunny intentionally but, a little bit. She marries a guy who has this little crippled son named\n\nTimmy and she basically starts 86’ing anything in her life that\n\ntakes any time away from them, you know, for the husband and wife. And so at one point she pushes Timmy off a cliff or\n\nsomething… into a lake. And\n\nhe says, ‘but why, why did you do it?’, ‘but darling, I\n\nthought we needed more time alone.’ So I completely based it on\n\nthat.\n\nDo\n\nyou dwell into the dark side a lot?\n\nNo.\n\nReally?\n\nNot\n\nat all. I think things\n\nare… in fact I was just telling my publicist about this website, cuteoverload.com,\n\nthat’s my favorite. It’s\n\njust all cute animals and puppies and miniature horses. I have a bursting huge file on my desktop of just cute baby\n\nanimal photos.\n\nYeah. I would have just thought, you know, gothic stuff…\n\nI’ve\n\nnever been gothic in my life, it’s hilarious. No, no, no. Cute\n\nbaby puppies, and I spend hours perusing baby Boston Terriers\n\non-line.\n\nYou\n\nknow what I found cool about you back at the “Jawbreaker”\n\nexperience is that, I walked in and said, ‘I’m a big fan of\n\nyours’ and you were like, ‘Really?’ [Surprised].\n\nI’m\n\nkind of still like, ‘Really?’ That was more with “Charmed”,\n\n“Charmed” is hilarious to me because you know there’s like a\n\nbig writer at Vanity Fair that loves the show and a seventy-five\n\nyear old, gruff\n\nNew York\n\ncabbie and they start telling me lines from the show. It’s such a peripatetic audience, it’s so all over, so\n\nwhen somebody is… you know, it’s still… it’s just anybody,\n\nyou’re just wandering around, you’re in your own head. If you’re in the aisle at the supermarket, you’re in your\n\nown brain and somebody comes up from the outside and I always kind\n\nof jump and go, really… It just startles me because I’m like\n\nanybody, you know…\n\nYeah.\n\nDo\n\nI need five lemons… and so the outside world… it’s funny, I\n\nnever… I don’t really ever think about people ‘liking me’. I probably think about people disliking me. [Laughing]\n\nWell\n\nthat’s…\n\nI\n\nthink that’s human nature…\n\nYeah…\n\nIf\n\nyou get fifty compliments and one mean thing you remember the mean\n\nthing.\n\nAnd\n\nyou have had your fair share of crap thrown at you in the media.\n\nNo,\n\nI think, you know people never know what somebody’s going through\n\nand I’ve learned a lot about the gray area. I used to be very black and white as well, like this is right\n\nand this is wrong and the thing is, nobody knows if my dad’s\n\nreally sick or this is happening but go for it… make fun of me for\n\nbad toe-nail polish cuz it makes you happy.\n\nYeah.\n\nDoes\n\nthat make you feel better about yourself, like, how does that\n\nactually affect your life as a human being?\n\nPeople\n\ndo get excited about seeing other people’s demise.\n\nObviously\n\nyou could take it back to the gladiators; you could take it back to\n\nanything, just society in general. I think so much of… you know it’s interesting, like,\n\n‘well, they wanted to become actors so they deserve to be taken\n\ndown a peg.’ Wait a second, I wasn’t trying to be an actor…\n\ncan’t I just skip out on that whole thing. [Laughing] Hey, how\n\nabout focus on others. [Laughing]\n\nNo, but it’s very\n\n“Lord of the Flies”-esque too.\n\nYes\n\nit is.\n\nVery\n\nmuch the media and just people in general… [An ice bucket on the\n\ncounter makes a noise as the ice melts] [We pause looking at the\n\nwater] Exactly! The ice\n\nbucket concurred.\n\nYes,\n\nexactly.\n\nI\n\nthink that so much of it is so “Lord of the Flies”, one person\n\npiles on and you see everybody else doing it as well. And the thing is, as I think it’s easier for people to do\n\nthat then reflect upon themselves and what things they’re maybe or\n\nmaybe not doing right in their lives.\n\nNow\n\nwith “Grindhouse”, was it always planned that you’d be in both\n\nfilms?\n\nNo,\n\nI auditioned for Quentin’s twice; [I] had to go back twice while I\n\nwas shooting “Planet Terror”. So no, I did not; it was not a forgone conclusion.\n\nWas\n\nit fun being able to do both films?\n\nAbsolutely…\n\nit was definitely a big arc.\n\nWhat\n\nwas it like working with Kurt Russell in “Death Proof”?\n\nIt\n\nwas great. And what’s\n\ninteresting actually, is that, it’s almost the way it’s been cut\n\nI have two different roles in “Death Proof” because Quentin\n\nwrote a 130 page script which is really about two hours so he had to\n\ncondense it for this. But\n\nonce it’s on DVD and the International release is a lot longer…\n\nand I have a lot more stuff with Kurt which develops his character a\n\nlot more.\n\nIn\n\nthe bar?\n\nYeah,\n\nhe and I were primarily together the whole time, that was pretty\n\nmuch all of our scenes. Other\n\nthan his stuff out on the porch, it was all he and I. So that will be seen a lot more but as it is its interesting\n\nbecause right now I’m playing the character of the girl who\n\nyou’re like, “Don’t go in the woods you dumbass!” [Laughing]\n\n“You’re going to get killed by the guy with the axe!” and now\n\nI’m playing, “Don’t go in the car you dumbass!” [Laughing]\n\nBut once you see the longer version of it, you kind of understand\n\nwhy I’m getting in the car. Currently,\n\nshe’s the girl you’re going to yell at, basically.\n\nWhat\n\nabout the machine gun leg in “Planet Terror”, what did you use\n\nfor it?\n\nI\n\nhad a really heavy gray cast and it kind of had like a ball bearing\n\non the heel, so if you had a table leg, or a machine gun or a rifle,\n\nyou would have a little nub so that was the ball bearing. And my toes were pointed in the air so I thought that maybe\n\nmy Achilles tendon was going to snap. And the other side is a four-inch high heeled boot.\n\nHow\n\ndid you walk like that?\n\nVery\n\nawkwardly… how did I run like that, how did I jump like that, how\n\ndid I role like that… yeah.\n\nHow\n\ndid you fly like that?\n\nI\n\nlove flying.\n\nDid\n\nyou have a crane or something?\n\nNah,\n\nI was on wires, it wasn’t a crane. But it was funny because I had to run to get up enough speed\n\nto be flown over the wall. So\n\nof course I had like the four-inch heel so…\n\nNow\n\nwhen I got to see “Grindhouse”, it reminded me of the first time\n\nI saw you at a\n\nmidnight\n\nshowing of “The Doom Generation”.\n\nI\n\nlove that movie. I had\n\nno idea what I was doing, I mean I’d never done a movie before,\n\nI’d never done anything. He’d\n\nsay stand on your mark and I’d go wander across room, I had no\n\nclue what was going on. But\n\nI don’t know, I thought it was hilarious of course.\n\nI\n\ndid too.\n\nIt\n\nwas a very tough film to shoot. I’m very happy for it now because it was boot camp. I learned so much on that, so fast it kind of instilled the\n\nwork ethic of not holding anything up and not wasting film. But I think it’s also just [an] empathy kind of the thing\n\nwith people that don’t come out of their trailers… I’m like,\n\nwhat about that guy that has to drive home for two hours just to see\n\nhis kid for like a half an hour before he goes to bed… Come on. And I think it all kind of goes in line with that. But working obviously with Robert [Rodriguez] and Quintin\n\n[Tarantino] was, I think for any actor was pretty much a dream and\n\nthe fact that I got to work with both of them.\n\n[Playing]\n\nCherry [Darling] was amazing and I think, probably til I die; she\n\nwill always be one of my favorite characters I’ve ever played. And I feel quite protective towards her, so hopefully nobody\n\nwill put her down. And\n\nif they do, she can just shoot them in the face with her machine\n\ngun. [Laughing] I think the whole thing in expecting to see this movie, I\n\nthink you should expect to laugh and dry-heave at the same time and\n\njust go in knowing… just sit in that roller coaster seat, you\n\nknow, buckle up and go along for the ride. And have fun… gosh. And\n\nI hope to see people with a machine gun leg for Halloween outfits\n\nnext year.\n\nClick\n\nhere for a ton of photos from the GRINDHOUSE premiere"
