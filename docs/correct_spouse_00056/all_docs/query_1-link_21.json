        "text": "When Rodriguez first met McGowan: âI met Rose in Cannes on May 19, 2005, at an amfAR after party. âSin Cityâ had just screened at the Festival the night before. Rose and I were talking, and she told me she was a film noir fan and that she wished she could have been cast in âSin City.â I asked her âWhy didnât you audition for it? You would have been terrific.â She said that she couldnât because she had been blacklisted from working on any Weinstein movies. When I asked what she meant by that, and how could she possibly be blacklisted, she told me the horrifying story of what Harvey did to her seven years earlier.\n\nRodriguez instantly wanted to cast her in Grindhouse: âIncensed at what I heard, I told Rose that she was not blacklisted from MY movies and that Harvey couldnât tell me who to cast. The reason was that Harvey didnât work on my movies, I made movies all those years for Dimension and Bob Weinstein. So I explained that if I cast her in my next film, Harvey couldnât suddenly tell me no, because my first question would be âOh, really? Why canât I cast her?â And I was sure he would not want to tell me why. I then revealed to Rose right then and there that I was about to start writing a movie with Quentin Tarantino, a double feature throwback to 70âs exploitation movies, and that if she was interested, I would write her a BAD ASS character and make her one of the leads. I wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her OFF the blacklist, and the best part is that we would have Harveyâs new Weinstein Company pay for the whole damn thing.\n\nThat same night, he spoke to Weinstein as McGowan was sitting there: âJust as I finished telling Rose this, I saw Harvey walking around the party! I called Harvey over to our table, and as soon as he got close enough to see that I was sitting with Rose, his face dropped and went ghostly white. I said, âHey Harvey, this is Rose McGowan. I think sheâs amazing and really talented and Iâm going to cast her in my next movie.â Harvey then dribbled all over himself in the most over the top performance Iâd ever seen as he gushed, âOh sheâs wonderful, oh sheâs amazing, oh sheâs fantastic, oh sheâs so talentedâ¦ You two should definitely work together.â And then he skittered off. I knew right then that every word Rose told me was true, you could see it all over his face. I looked over at Rose. Her mouth was open, and her eyes were wide. âWOW. Iâve never seen that before,â she said. I then told her that if she wanted a role that I would write it for her and Harveyâs company would have to fund it. Rose agreed, and the deal was done. I found it so commendable that she was putting the incident behind her and moving forward with her career. I wanted to help. We had a plan, and more importantly, we had a mission.\n\nEven though they kept quiet about their scheme, Harvey still buried them: âTo our horror, Harvey buried our movie anyway, and because we did not want to risk getting sued, we never spoke publicly about the matter. It would have been much easier on both of us if we could have just revealed why we were doing itâ¦. even though âGrindhouseâ received great reviews, Rose got terrific notices, and the film is still a fan favorite todayâ¦ it was heartbreaking to see Harvey simply bury the movie for its release."
