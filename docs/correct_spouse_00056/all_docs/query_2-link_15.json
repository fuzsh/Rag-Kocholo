The unprecedented project from the longtime collaborators (From Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms, Sin City) presents two original, complete films as a double feature. Quentin Tarantino’s DEATH PROOF is a white knuckle ride behind the wheel of a psycho serial killer’s roving, revving, racing death machine. Robert Rodriguez’s PLANET TERROR is a heart-pounding trip to a town ravaged by a mysterious plague. Inspired by the unique distribution of independent horror classics of the sixties and seventies, these two shockingly bold features are presented together on a drive-in style double bill, replete with fake trailers, missing reels and plenty of exploitative mayhem.\n\nThe impetus for Grindhouse began during a time before the multiplex and state-of-the-art home theaters ruled the movie-going experience. The origins of the term “grindhouse” are fuzzy: some cite the types of films shown (as in “Bump-and-Grind”) in run down former movie palaces; others point to a method of presentation -- movies were “grinded out” in ancient projectors one after another. Frequently, the movies were grouped by exploitation subgenre. Splatter, slasher, sexploitation, blaxploitation, cannibal and mondo movies would be grouped together and shown with graphic trailers. This was movie exhibition in its alternative heyday, simultaneously run-down and vividly alive.\n\n“They were old houses that that were more dilapidated than existed for the people in the big city neighborhoods, or they were all-night theaters that would play three or four movies,” Tarantino explains. “It would be a place for the bums to go and sleep. If you’re hiding out from the law you’d go there for the night. Then, at six in the morning they wake you up and send you out, and you’d walk around for ninety minutes and come right back in again.” But exploitation movies weren’t just for urbanites: “Drive-ins had the same shows, but were a whole different setting,” Tarantino says. “Grindhouse theaters were in more urban areas. Dallas would have grindhouses, and Houston would have grindhouses, but when you get into the outer regions of Texas, it’s more about drive-ins.” Theaters were booked independently. Film titles were changed from market to market and were promoted locally (especially in the case of the rural drive-ins). One print would travel from an old movie palace to a drive-in. “It wasn’t like the way movies are now, where a movie opens up on three thousand theaters playing everywhere at once,” Tarantino explains. “Exploitation companies would make maybe twenty prints for a big release. That was a huge release, actually. You would take those twenty prints to Houston, or Los Angeles. You’d just schlep them around the country, one place at a time. And they usually only played for a week. The grindhouses could get those movies that week they opened. They’d be backed by newspaper support, and be backed by television -- local channel support.” “Because they made so few prints that they would be scratched up and worn out, and have chunks chopped out of them by the time anybody saw them,” Rodriguez adds. “If you were lucky enough to get an exploitation movie at the beginning of its run, the prints could be OK. But after it played at the El Paso Drive-In Theater, God knows what condition it might be in. It depends on what part of the daisy chain you lived in as far as how good the prints were going to be by the time you got them,” Tarantino says. “But grindhouses would also get the big budget films that had been playing back in the day when movies played for six months,” Tarantino notes. “They would also get them on their way out of town. A STAR IS BORN came out in ’76, but you could easily see Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in A STAR IS BORN in the middle of ’77 playing with a kung fu movie.”\n\nThis unusual aberration from Hollywood production and distribution spawned some of the most shocking, exciting, and unusual movies of the ‘60s and ‘70s. Though the filmmaking was often pedestrian, this era was extraordinarily democratic and enthusiasm and drive spawned unrelenting creativity. Many grindhouse films were bankrolled for only a few thousand dollars. They “worked” because of their ingenuity, or their absurdity, or their unique, effective storytelling. Budgetary constraints and an absence of studio-mandated rewrites allowed fertile imaginations to flourish. “That shit was raw,” Tarantino exudes. “The shit was off the hook. Sexuality was wild. You couldn’t even believe some of the sexuality and brutality that they got away with in these movies, and gore. You literally had to pinch yourself and say, ‘Am I even watching what I’m watching?’” Exploitation cinema offered sanctuary for those whose tastes lied on the periphery. They also gave a voice -- albeit a sensationalistic, often stereotypical one -- to society’s under-represented: people of color, gays and lesbians found increased representation in the form of films like VAPORS (a one reel exploration of a gay bathhouse) and DOLEMITE (a blaxploitation classic). These films were marketed in a way that incited the most base of human impulses and preyed upon audiences most voyeuristic instincts. Grindhouse advertisements enticed audiences with the promise of gore and violence. ‘Shock value’ took on an entirely new meaning with the onslaught of rape revenge, slasher and cannibal films. Ads for Wes Craven’s THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT famously warned audiences: “To Avoid Fainting, Keep Repeating, ‘It’s Only A Movie. It’s Only A Movie. It’s Only A Movie.’” In accordance with the marketing misinformation that permeated the grindhouses of the 60s and 70s, knockoffs (of both titles and plots) were commonplace. The success of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT begat HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK and LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET. Neither film had anything to do with Craven’s original, though audiences were treated to similar homicidal depravities. Major releases also had their own grindhouse counterparts. JAWS, for instance, led a slew of animal-terrorizing-a-small-town films like TENTACLES, PIRHANA, and GRIZZLY. “There was a big disconnect as far as what they were selling and what they actually had,” Tarantino says. “These little exploitation companies like had geniuses doing the fonts for the titles, and for the posters. They had great artists. Just give me that much talent from those guys and put it anywhere else, and they would explode. But oftentimes they weren’t selling the movie they had, they were selling the movie they wished they had. We are fans of these types of films and we’ve been let down before.” But Tarantino and Rodriguez aren’t planning on letting anyone down. “This is a grindhouse movie made by people who love grindhouse movies. If you’re going to have a girl with a machine gun leg, it’s going to get used, and it’s going to get used well. That idea will be exhausted by the time the film’s finished,” Tarantino says. “The movie’s not a trick,” Rodriguez adds. “We’re not going to trick you in with the idea that it’s not going to be. It delivers.”\n\nWith this rich history as inspiration, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino set out to make two very different, very complete movies and distribute them together as a double feature. The idea for this project began simply enough, when Rodriguez spotted a double bill poster at Tarantino’s house and commented that he had the same poster at his home. Rodriguez mentioned that he’d long wanted to make a double feature, and Tarantino suggested that they collaborate on the project together. As the concept was developed further, the directors brought in some of their friends and collaborators to make “fake” trailers to be presented in front of and between their movies. “When I would come over to Quentin’s house, he would show trailers, a feature, some more trailers, all vintage stuff,” Rodriguez says. “He would show different types of movies, different types of film prints -- some of them really worn out, some of them really nice. That’s what we wanted to do. We thought, ‘Let’s make this experience that we have when we come over to Quentin’s house, for audiences all over the world. Fake trailers, two features, and make it a night at the movies.’” Tarantino describes the invitation of Edgar Wright, director of SHAWN OF THE DEAD and Eli Roth, director of CABIN FEVER and Hostel to join him and Rodriguez on GRINDHOUSE: “They just seemed natural guys to just step into the breech, especially where their interests were concerned. Eli would make a slasher film trailer using the one holiday that hadn’t been used: Thanksgiving.” “And Edgar was going to do a 70s-style British horror film trailer because he remembered that nobody opens their mouth in the trailers. You never wanted the audience to know that it’s a British movie,” Tarantino jokes. Rounding out the trio of trailer guest directors is Rob Zombie.\n\nTarantino and Rodriguez were not the only classic exploitation and b-movie aficionados on set. Many of the actors appearing in GRINDHOUSE had fond memories of the days of the double and triple feature. Freddy Rodriguez remembers: “When I was a kid in Chicago, my dad would take us to this big theater called The Tiffany, which used to play three karate movies for three bucks. We always joked that we would go in when the sun was up and come out when the sun was down and it was nighttime. We had a lot of fond memories going to grindhouse movies.” “I grew up in the central coast of California, where we had great drive-ins,” Josh Brolin says. “You’d see a Bruce Lee movie, and then a Charles Bronson movie. The best part to me was that you got two bangs for your buck.” Kurt Russell comments: “They’re trying to recreate a feeling, an evening. I refer to Quentin as the professor of ‘directology.’ I think that if Quentin could take the world into his cinema class he would say now this is the way movies were made, looked, and experienced in the late 60s and early 70s, if you went into the drive-in theater and saw two movies that night, this would be sort of the experience that you had, except with a modern-day storyline. They take it on it with an ode to those types of movies.” Greg Nicotero, who created the special effects makeup in both PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, had distinct memories of visiting the projection booth of his local drive-in: “The projectionist would cut out the cool frames of all the neat monster gags. I went to see John Carpenter’s THE THING at the drive-in, and I was talking to the projectionist, and he said, ‘Oh, check this out.’ And he had cut out a frame of the spider head just because he thought it was a cool monster. And I thought, ‘If a movie gets sent all across the country, and every projectionist takes a couple of frames out, or the film breaks and they don’t really care how they put it back together, you watch a print that’s been destroyed.” The irony of the wide distribution of this film in theaters is not lost on the filmmakers, but they have audiences’ safety in mind: “You’re going to go into a safe multiplex and watch this as opposed to a dangerous grindhouse, where you’d take your life in your hands,” Tarantino jokes.\n\nWith GRINDHOUSE, Rodriguez and Tarantino are at once nostalgic and progressive. With one foot in the past, the writer-directors create cinematic worlds that are wholly their own -- save for some crossovers. Rodriguez explains: “One of the things that excited us too is sometimes you’d see a double feature where Pam Grier was in both movies. She was a prisoner in one, and then she’s the warden in the other one. I thought; Wow, we could make that work.’”\n\nPLANET TERROR finds noir-inspired romance amidst a future-shock vision of a chemical apocalypse. Informed by ZOMBIE and DAWN OF THE DEAD, as well as by the work of acclaimed director John Carpenter, Rodriguez creates a fresh and dynamic original take on the zombie genre. A simple night in a small town in Texas gives way to paranoia and espionage and hidden identities in a complex, layered narrative. PLANET TERROR builds upon the quick-paced, frenetic energy of Rodriguez’s explosive hit, SIN CITY.\n\nTarantino’s fifth film references some classic chase movies, from H.B. Halicki’s self-financed GONE IN 60 SECONDS, which contained a non-stop, forty minute car chase, to VANISHING POINT, the nihilistic chase flick, to DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY, a Peter Fonda vehicle. But Tarantino, no stranger to mixing genres, fuses the chase and slasher genres and comes up with something original. One can look to classic slasher fare like Bob Clark’s BLACK CHRISTMAS, Herschell Gordon Lewis’s BLOOD FEAST, and HOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE PARK for the advent of the predatory psycho. DEATH PROOF is also Tarantino’s most linear film: events are presented chronologically and breaks in time are punctuated with title cards. Though the action is sequential, the contents of this unfamiliar structure are no less intriguing than that of any of his previous films. Jungle Julia and Zoë Bell (and the rest of his eight girl posse) turn the concept of the “final girl,” a staple of the slasher genre, on its ear. He gives characters a lifeline that would make Hitchcock’s Marion Crane seem like a cinematic stranger, and then builds a distinct narrative of revenge-by-proxy. As much as DEATH PROOF has a ‘70s sensibility, in fashion, transportation and in filmic tradition, the conditions of the characters are ultra-modern and personal. Tarantino delights in the details of these women’s everyday lives: expressions of romance abbreviated and delivered via text message, descriptions of hookups and dating rules, and exasperation with self-reflexive careers. All the while, an insurmountable tension builds with each sideways glance from the loner with the pompadour sitting at the bar…\n\nPLANET TERROR\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Rodriguez\n\nSynopsis\n\nRobert Rodriguez, co-director of SIN CITY, brings you PLANET TERROR, a retro-futuristic vision of horror that’s been weathered, stripped, and aged to perfection.\n\nIn PLANET TERROR, married doctors William and Dakota Block (Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton) find their graveyard shift inundated with townspeople ravaged by gangrenous sores and a suspiciously vacant look in their eyes. Among the wounded is Cherry (Rose McGowan), a go-go dancer whose leg was ripped from her body during a roadside attack. Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), her former significant other, is at her side and watching her back. Cherry may be down, but she hasn’t danced her last number. As the invalids quickly become enraged aggressors, Cherry and Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night, hurtling towards a destiny that will leave millions infected, countless dead, and a lucky few struggling to find the last safe corner of PLANET TERROR.\n\nPLANET TERROR also stars Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Naveen Andrews, Stacy Ferguson and Michael Parks. PLANET TERROR will be shown on a GRINDHOUSE double bill with Quentin Tarantino’s DEATH PROOF.\n\nAbout the Production\n\nSeveral years ago, when Robert Rodriguez first jotted down the ideas notes that would eventually become the screenplay for PLANET TERROR, he thought he would be resuscitating a dormant genre. “No one had made a zombie movie in such a long time,” Rodriguez says of his initial impulse to make PLANET TERROR. The visionary multi-hyphenate was a fan of zombie and horror films, but he wanted to write a movie that would be something truly different, surprising and unexpected. He sought to make a zombie film that was character-driven, frenetically paced and over-the-top. He continued fleshing out his ideas, but writer’s block and work on other projects stalled his efforts.\n\nGreg Nicotero, Rodriguez’s longtime collaborator and friend, describes the protracted gestation of the script for PLANET TERROR from his point of view: “I remember during SPY KIDS, maybe even as early as THE FACULTY, that Robert said, ‘I’ve got this cool idea for this zombie movie. I don’t know exactly what’s going to happen yet, but there’s going to be a doctor and his wife, and they’re going to be working in a hospital, and there’s going to be this really great scene where we see a girl on the road, and every time a car passes we reveal silhouettes of zombies getting closer and closer to her.’”\n\nRodriguez gave Nicotero the first thirty pages of this screenplay, which included these pulse-pounding moments. “I remember reading it and I said, ‘Where are you going to go from there?’\n\n“He said, ‘I have no idea.’”\n\n“I never got past those thirty pages,” Rodriguez says, “and of course zombie movies started coming out one after another.”\n\n21 DAYS LATER, DAWN OF THE DEAD, LAND OF THE DEAD and SHAWN OF THE DEAD invaded movie theaters and revived audiences’ appetites for screen representations of flesh-hungry monsters by offering new, unusual takes on the plight of the undead. Instead of discouraging Rodriguez, these movies whetted his appetite and challenged him to be even more inventive when writing. In the years that had passed, Rodriguez developed his child-like imagination with the SPY KIDS trilogy and with the smash hit SIN CITY. These films showcased his capacity to create a fantasy world that is unlike anything audiences had ever experienced.\n\nRodriguez returned to PLANET TERROR fully committed to fill his screenplay with “things that I hadn’t seen in other movies. A lot of it has to do with the characters.” Included in the population of Rodriguez’s tiny, anonymous Texas town are a barbecue-obsessed business-owner; a stoic and suspicious sheriff; a gun-legged go-go girl-turned-vigilante; a syringe-wielding, wobbly-wristed doctor on the run from her abusive husband; a pocket-bike riding mysterious hero, and a pair of psychotic identical babysitter twins. In PLANET TERROR, disbelief isn’t just suspended -- it’s annihilated. As with SIN CITY, stories weave in and out of each other and circumstances escalate to absurd, impossible levels.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez has a commitment for storytelling that is fresh and radical, PLANET TERROR has its roots in classic films beyond those of grindhouse era. The dialogue between Wray and Cherry is noir-inspired, and their love story is similarly elevated. The political paranoia and vague allusions to espionage are great throwbacks to films like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, KISS ME DEADLY and other cultural remnants of the McCarthy Era.\n\nNicotero received the script for PLANET TERROR, unaware that Rodriguez had resurrected the project: “Lo and behold, I get this script and I start reading it and I think, ‘Hey there’s a doctor, and his wife,’ and then I get to the scene with Tammy on the road and I think: ‘I’ve read this before.’”\n\n“You would think a zombie movie is just people running away from zombies,” Michael Biehn, who plays Hague, jokes. “But we all have our relationships with the other people in the movie that are very strong. The characters are really well written. I think that that’s what’s going to make it all pull together, because it’s a pretty crazy movie.”\n\nRose McGowan, who plays Cherry, was so in awe of the script’s unusual circumstances and such sharp, funny dialogue. She also couldn’t imagine how anyone could think of outfitting a character with a gun for a leg. (The image of McGowan and the leg has already become iconic among the fanboy set following the exciting debut of a teaser poster at Comic-Con in June of 2006.) “I asked him, ‘How did you come up with the fact that Cherry has a machine gun leg? He said, ‘Well, I was sitting in traffic…,’ and that’s where the explanation stopped. OK, I sit in traffic, too, and I don’t often have machine gun legs that pop into my head. But that’s just me.”\n\nRodriguez looked to his favorite films and television programs, his family, friends and his previous collaborators to assemble the impressive and diverse cast of PLANET TERROR. Marley Shelton, Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino worked with the director previously. Joining them are actors who are familiar to genre enthusiasts: Naveen Andrews of “Lost,” Rose McGowan of “Charmed,” Michael Biehn, who starred in ALIENS, THE ABYSS, and THE TERMINATOR, and Jeff Fahey, a favorite for THE LAWNMOWER MAN and BODY PARTS. Tom Savini, one of the founding fathers of horror movie makeup, portrays Deputy Tolo. Rebel Rodriguez, Rodriguez’s son, plays Tony, and Elise and Electra Avellán, Rodriguez’s nieces, make an impressive debut as the Babysitter Twins. This group of actors, along with Freddy Rodriguez and Stacy Ferguson, makes the high drama of PLANET TERROR seem real, believable and very, very scary.\n\nMcGowan has a global following for her scene-stealing roles in SCREAM and THE DOOM GENERATION and for her turn as Paige on the television series “Charmed.” She embraced the truly un-chartered dramatic territory that her role in PLANET TERROR would offer her. Cherry is on an emotional rollercoaster from the moment she appears on the scratched (digital) celluloid, crying on the stage of her go-go club. “She’s kind of a wanderer, and things never just really seem to pan out for her. She’s just really down on herself and her life.”\n\nCherry’s turmoil dovetails into a fateful run-in with her ex, Wray, played by Freddy Rodriguez. But Cherry’s bad night doesn’t end there: Her leg, one of the tools of her former trade, is ripped from her body in a roadside attack. That’s when the fun really begins. “PLANET TERROR is absolutely a wild ride,” McGowan says. “I don’t even really know how best to describe it. Cherry starts out as a normal girl whose life is a bit on the skids, and all of a sudden she has to save the universe.”\n\nMcGowan spent much of production shuttling between Austin and Los Angeles, where she was completing production of the final season of “Charmed.” Once the show wrapped, she was free to devote her attention to Cherry’s adventure.\n\nJoining McGowan is Freddy Rodriguez, who has become a sought-after character actor since his Emmy-nominated five season stint on HBO’s “Six Feet Under.” PLANET TERROR marks Freddy Rodriguez’s debut in a science-fiction or action film. He plays Wray, a tough loner whose identity is shrouded in secrecy. “Wray is kind of a mysterious character,” Rodriguez says. “The film takes place in Texas. Because of his appearance, the way he talks, and the way he behaves, Wray is clearly not from Texas. We really don’t know who he is or where he’s from. He’s kind of a loner. As the movie unfolds, you see different layers of Wray, and as the different layers are peeled away, and you see more and more of who he is.” McGowan, for one, was extremely happy with the pairing. “Freddy’s got this great edge in this character and he just really nails it. He’s very, very focused,” McGowan says. “He definitely has the ‘cool’ thing going on. He’s got swagger going into it, and swagger coming out of it.”\n\nMarley Shelton, who made a memorable appearance alongside Josh Hartnett in SIN CITY’s brilliant opening sequence, returned to Troublemaker Studios to play Dr. Dakota Block: “I’m an anesthesiologist, and I have a terrible relationship with my husband,” Shelton says of her character. “We have a stale marriage -- a Cold War marriage. On the night that the movie takes place I’m about to leave my husband, played by Josh Brolin.” Dakota, like Cherry, is prepared to take strides in reclaiming control of her personal life. Dakota also has her own set of unusual physical challenges to work through: “The funniest thing about my character is that for the first half of the movie I lose the ability to control my hands. Funnily enough, I can actually move my wrists in a really bizarre way. Stupid human tricks. Playing with Dakota’s frustration was really fun for me. She’s a doctor who’s rendered awkward. She’s someone who’s hyper efficient, a real type-A personality, who’s always in control and who is now out of control. She can’t protect herself, and she can’t protect her son, and she can’t escape.” (Not only can she not escape, Dakota can’t even turn a key: She busts her tooth within moments of her introduction. Shelton had to get used to having the eyes of crew members fixate on her blacked-out tooth during on-set conversations.)\n\nDakota’s problems are not just plot points or gimmicks for Shelton. She approached Dakota’s unusual circumstances with respect and believability and tempered her performance with humanity: “It’s a wild ride and her evolution is great. The more horrific, traumatic things that happen to her, the more sort of unbridled and unleashed she becomes in terms of connecting to herself, and reconnection with her father, and connecting to her son.” Shelton loves that her character has a devilishly heroic upswing: “I have a secret stash of hypodermic needles on my garter belt. Once my hands come back to life I’m able to use to defend myself against the evil rapist played by none other than Quentin Tarantino,” Shelton says. “One bad thing after another is happening to me, and I’m on the run, but I have this great comeback moment where I get to shoot my needle gun, and then twirl it in like old-school western movie fashion just like my dad, Quick Draw Earl McGraw would.” Tarantino and Rodriguez fans will remember Earl McGraw played by Michael Parks, appeared in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and KILL BILL and who has a cameo with Shelton in DEATH PROOF. Dakota Block exists in the Rodriguez-Tarantino shared movie universe that also includes Red Apple cigarettes and Chango Cervesa. She took her addition to this legacy very seriously. “That syringe moment shows that Earl trained his daughter well. She’s got chops. She can twirl a gun, which she probably learned when she was six years old. I was terrified of the gun twirling. I spent months trying to learn how to do it, and of course Robert made me look much cooler than I really am. He’s just brilliant at that.”\n\nJosh Brolin portrays Dr. William Block, Dakota’s suspicious and controlling husband. He shared many of his scenes with Shelton, who found the actor distractingly charming: “Our characters hate each other -- we’re killing each other, we’re fighting, we’re violent. But Josh is just the most magnanimous guy. He’s so charismatic and funny. Between takes we were cracking up.” Despite their kidding around, Shelton appreciated his similar commitment to the role and his dedication to making his character as “real” as possible. “He gained twenty-five pounds for the role. He plays this brooding Texan with a beer gut -- just this crazy guy who is a bitter, male chauvinist pig. He did an amazing job, and he’s so funny in the movie, and so menacing, and so scary.” Brolin has known Rodriguez for years, and the part of Block was written specifically for him. He wasn’t aware of the specifics of the project or of the imaginativeness of its plot, so he was pleased when he finally read the script for PLANET TERROR. “Why would you not be a part of something that’s that fun; that’s that involved,” the actor says. The character was a small role that was developed and fleshed out during a meeting between Rodriguez and Brolin. “He came in with a beard, and that whole character we kind of came up with based on him just coming in and reading,” Rodriguez says. “You don’t know he’s a villain until there’s a scene where he turns. You’re sympathetic to him until you realize he’s out of his mind. And this is before he’s turned into a zombie. He’s crazy and deadly before he even gets infected. So I wanted—I battled that a long time. I thought the character was someone who was never going to get infected. He was just going to be more dangerous than anyone just because he was out of his mind, jealous, and crazy, after his wife for cheating on him.”\n\nMichael Biehn plays Hague, a small town sheriff who must unite with Wray to overcome a zombie enemy. Biehn has been a screen presence for nearly thirty years. He has come against some crippling other-worldly forces throughout his career, having appeared in THE TERMINATOR, ALIENS and THE ABYSS. Though playing the stoic, brave Hague had its own creative rewards, showcasing the set to his son was a special perk: “When my fourteen-year-old was out here visiting he always wanted to see the zombies and explosions. He’d say ‘Dad, are they going to shoot zombies tonight? Are they going to kill zombies? Who’s going to get bloodied?”’ As with Brolin, the creation of the character of Hague was developed and tailor-made following the casting of Biehn in the film. Rodriguez comments: “I had only had the part half written when I met him and cast him, and then wrote the rest of it based on what I could do with him. It’s just like with Quentin and Zoë. Once you know someone, you can write for those specific people.” Jeff Fahey plays Hague’s brother JT, who is “fortunate enough to be the owner and proprietor of the best damn barbeque joint in Texas – period. He’s working on the perfect recipe in the midst of all of this,” Fahey says. “He’s just concerned with getting the perfect recipe, and he’s just about there, and then all hell breaks loose.” “The wonderful thing for me and for this character is that in the midst of all this insanity and this wild ride he’s got one thing on his mind and that’s that barbeque sauce.”\n\nStacy Ferguson, also known as “Fergie” from the immensely successful band “Black Eyed Peas” plays Tammy, whose fateful journey is cut short when her Volvo overheats on the wrong road. Ferguson filmed her role in PLANET TERROR while she was touring the globe and recording an album. In fact, the actor and singer made some extreme adjustments in order to accommodate the production schedule. She whisked up to Luling, TX set to shoot a scene with Jeff Fahey after performing a concert with the Black Eyed Peas to a sold out crowd in Dallas. Tammy is Ferguson’s third big-screen movie role, and PLANET TERROR completes an unusual hat-trick for the actor: “I was in a horror film when I was little called MONSTER IN THE CLOSET. I died in that. I died in my second movie, POSEIDON, and I die in this one. Three’s a charm.” Ferguson had an instant fan in Felix Sabates, who was deemed Coolest Dad In The World after introducing his daughters to Ferguson: “Fergie was just a ball of fire. She’s great. My daughters were here and Fergie took them to the dressing room. She was very, very nice to my daughters. And in my book if you’re nice to my kids you’re in.” Sabates was extraordinarily well-suited for the role, despite not being an actor by trade—he’s an ophthalmologist in Kansas City and an emergency room physician in Houston. He also does head and neck surgeries. He previously made a brief appearance in Rodriguez’s SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS, and graciously accepted the offer to portray a version of himself.\n\n“Probably the most fun experience I’ve had making movies was when I did SHARK BOY AND LAVA GIRL and the first five days I got to work with Rebel,” Rodriguez says of the casting of his son in the role of Tony. “When I was writing the script I had a little boy, and he was so inspiring because he has the bowl haircut that reminds me of from the kid from THE SHINING. In those horror movies kids always have that old bowl haircut, and they always have that same look.”\n\nTom Savini, who designed the zombie effects for the horror classic DAWN OF THE DEAD, portrays Deputy Tolo. Though he is best known as a horror makeup artist, he has proven himself as a gifted actor. “We built this character together,” Rodriguez says. “Tolo’s probably somebody who should have been sheriff but probably a little too shell shocked. He’ll shoot the wrong person. He might even shoot you (laughs) in a panic. He gets to do some heroic stuff, but he’s not like that the whole time like he was in FROM DUSK TIL DAWN. These people are being surprised that his range is really fantastic.” Nicotero, Savini’s former protégé, comments: “He’s a great actor. I was sitting on set the first night he was doing his big scene, when he loses his finger. I was so proud of him. We were sitting in the car driving back from set, and it was six o’clock in the morning. He was in the front and I was in the back, and I just patted him on the shoulder.”\n\nRodriguez wrote the roles of the Babysitter Twins for his nieces, Electra and Elise Avellán. He would ask his nieces about their after-school job (babysitting, of course) and kidded with the pair that their experiences may make it into one of his movies. Thankfully for children everywhere, Elise and Electra are nothing like the hyper-aggressive characters they play in PLANET TERROR. “I bet all the parents that ever hired us are going to say, ‘Wait, aren’t those the babysitters we had a year ago?’” Elise jokes. “’Is this what they do when we’re gone?’” Electra adds.\n\nFinally, Bruce Willis, who acted for Rodriguez in SIN CITY and Quentin Tarantino, who appeared in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN stepped in and took on cameo roles. Tarantino’s role offered him the opportunity to act opposite two of his DEATH PROOF stars, Marley Shelton and Rose McGowan.\n\nTarantino was honored to be asked to play such an interesting role in the film. “Rapist #1” also points to the originality of Rodriguez’s script. “It’s one of the things that happens in Robert’s movies that I like a lot: Two of the most dangerous characters that pose the most important threat to the heroes of the movie are not the infected people. It’s Josh Brolin’s character, and Rapist #1, who becomes a main villain for the third act of the movie.” “I don’t think Quentin was originally going to play the rapist,” McGowan says, “He was at the script reading. He was so good and treacherous and funny at the same time, I think he got hired on the spot.” “I think I have a lot of fans out there that don’t even know that I’m a director,” Tarantino jokes. “They just know me from acting in Robert’s movies.”\n\nSICKOS, SHORT SKIRTS, EXPLOSIONS AND BLOOD\n\nRodriguez’s script not only challenged his actors, but it also pushed the creative impulses of his frequent collaborators. The makeup effects employed in PLANET TERROR are a bold departure from the current crop of darkly nihilistic horror films. Instead, the blood-and-guts effects are fantastically graphic and eye-popping (sometimes literally). This was achieved through the makeup artists at KNB and award-winning makeup artist Greg Nicotero.\n\n“Robert and I share many things -- our love of JAWS, our love of John Carpenter movies, and our love of zombies,” Nicotero jokes. Both Nicotero and Savini are particular when using the term “zombie.” Both feel that, in the case of PLANET TERROR, it’s a misnomer. Says Nicotero: “It’s a big misconception because technically they’re not zombies. They don’t die then come back, and they don’t necessarily all eat flesh. We have a couple guys that eat brains, and people get torn apart and get disemboweled, but generally they don’t really die. They just become infected and become these mindless killers.” Savini agrees: “I don’t call them zombies. I call them ‘sickos,’ because they’re just sick people.” This painstaking attention to the world of the “zombie” is what makes Nicotero great at his job. “Robert and I threw some ideas around, and we did a bunch of tests but we stayed away from the traditional zombie look. They don’t all have shriveled skin and a grayish pallor with the sunken cheeks and the rotten teeth. We used medical text books of different skin rashes and skin diseases as our basis because the idea is that these people get infected with this nerve gas, and it starts with minor lacerations and little lumps and discoloration, and then it just grows from there.”\n\nNicotero continues to describe the zombie growth process---in detail: “It spreads and takes over the body. You develop these liquid filled bags of puss that are growing, these pustules, and all this horrible stuff. That would be ‘stage one,’ then you get into ‘stage two,’ which is much larger pustules, bigger wounds. Then, in ‘stage three,’ their heads are misshapen, their bodies are real built out and it’s all sort of twisted flesh that’s kind of melded and grown together.” “Greg and his crew work their asses off,” Savini who has known Nicotero since he was fourteen, says. “It reminds me of how hard we used to work.”\n\nDespite all of the work, there’s an element of playfulness to the art of filling mannequins with bottles of red-colored corn syrup. Josh Brolin comments: “Greg’s great. If you go to their shop, they have everything! They’re totally into the work, but they have a bunch of fun. It’s just a bunch of people having fun.”\n\nFun thought it may have been, did PLANET TERROR make Savini nostalgic for his horror effects makeup days? Not really: “Greg’s out there every night doing twelve zombies, then fifty zombies, then blood effects. I come in, I get make-up on, I have a trailer, and I get to sit around.”\n\n“Nicotero did my death scene in SCREAM, my second movie,” McGowan says. “I have kind of adored him ever since. He has a really great presence.”\n\nThe cast and crew of PLANET TERROR had to adjust to eating their lunch in the catering tent next to a zombie or two. “It’s not so hard when we’re on the set, when we’re filming. But when we actually go to lunch, they don’t have time to take off their masks. And I’ll be sitting there thinking, ‘Why do I need to sit next to a zombie?’” Elise Avellán says.\n\n“They’re just sitting there, dripping blood, and it’s hilarious. I love it. It’s amazing. It looks so real,” jokes Electra.\n\nPractical makeup effects are only one small portion of Rodriguez¹s effects process. For the rest of his movie magic, Rodriguez leans upon his team of artist at Troublemaker Digital. The real-world grit of GRINDHOUSE, however, posed new challenges for the team accustomed to the computer-generated worlds of SPY KIDS 3-D and SIN CITY. Troublemaker Digital's first hurdle was to digitally remove the lead actress' leg and replace it with a wooden, and later, a gun leg. The solution involved manufacturing an apparatus to place over McGowan¹s leg . The process also required the patience and imagination of the film¹s lead actress. The actor explains: \"I'm wearing a high heeled boot on one leg, and a greenscreen leg, on the other. Walking with the greenscreen leg is quite difficult. I'm at an angle and my body alignment is really weird. I had to do a lot of different exercises to be able to hold my leg up for long periods of time.\"\n\nThe other part of creating the look of PLANET TERROR involved an unprecedented digital ³aging² process that was engineered by Rodriguez. Each 20,000+ frame reel took an average of 12 hours to complete the damaged look. Stunt Coordinator Jeff Dashnaw and his team from Brand X Stunts worked in conjunction with Nicotero to create the goriest deaths possible. “We’re killing many, many creatures. I’ve had a little group of guys here, probably eight guys, and I think I’ve killed them all fifteen or twenty times each,” Dashnaw says. “We’re putting zombie clothes on everybody. It’s been pretty fun, and the actors are game.”\n\nIn addition to working with his own stunt people, Dashnaw enlisted the film’s actors to do many of their own stunts. “He’s been around for thirty years and has worked with everybody,” Freddy Rodriguez says of Dashnaw. “He’s worked with some great action heroes in the movie industry, and he’ll make you look good.”\n\nFreddy Rodriguez, who trained as a dancer, was eager to take on a role that required him to do some of his own stunts. “It’s very, very physical,” Rodriguez says. “This is the most physical film I’ve ever done. I’ve never played an action hero and I worked my butt off to get it right. I had a lot of fun doing the action sequences because they’re so new to me.”\n\nDespite the newness of action choreography, Freddy found that he had the capacity to quickly learn Wray’s trademark moves. Freddy Rodriguez comments: “To me, doing all the action sequences reminds me of dancing. It’s like putting choreography in your head and just going with it. That choreography is a lot of fun. It’s almost like going back to school.”\n\nMcGowan did many of her own stunts, including a jaw-dropping sequence in which Cherry is propelled through the air, in front of a gigantic explosion. Dashnaw is quick to praise McGowan for her bravery in taking on the stunt. “I think we flew her ninety or a hundred feet over a couple of walls and landed her on her stomach on an eight inch pad. I rehearsed it with her stunt double Dana Reed for several days. Rose stepped into it, we rehearsed the stunt with her a couple of times and it went off without a hitch. She was great.”\n\n“I loved flying through the air,” McGowan says. “I loved it. I was covered in gel from my head to my toes so that I wouldn’t catch on fire, because the explosions were really high. Obviously I couldn’t see the explosion because I was in front of it, but when I watched the playback I saw this huge mushroom cloud and thought, ‘Oh, dear.’”\n\nRobert Rodriguez made sure he captured McGowan’s memorable, breathtaking moment: “When you’re using cables and doing these really fantastical stunts, it’s amazing to have the actor do it. You see that it’s her. She’s very graceful. She’s a dancer so she’s adding her own physical character to it as well. It lends the believability to it.”\n\nMuch of the bold, keyed-up look of PLANET TERROR comes courtesy of Nina Proctor, who worked with Rodriguez on SPY KIDS, SPY KIDS 2, SPY KIDS 3-D, THE ADVENTURES OF SHARK BOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D, and SIN CITY.\n\nSIN CITY was a graphic novel; PLANET TERROR is all comic book: “Cherry ends up being a superhero,” Proctor says. “We’ve played with that idea with her costume -- the black leather skirt and black boots.”\n\nOn the other hand, Wray’s costume is characterized by an everyman simplicity. “We wanted Wray to be a normal guy – jeans and a thermal shirt and a leather jacket. We didn’t want to give away who he was. He could be any guy on the street. But he’s got these secrets in his past that we don’t know about, and we didn’t want to give any of that away. So we kept him very, very simple.” Many of these secrets are revealed through Wray’s tattoos, which are revealed when he removes this “normal” costume. Proctor cleverly chose not to upstage Wray’s outfit.\n\nShelton got to know and appreciate Proctor’s extreme attention to creating a character through costume when they worked together on SIN CITY. “She understands texture so well, and subtlety, and the way fabric moves, and cut, and design. She builds things from the ground up, and she’s just endlessly creative and tireless,” Shelton says of Proctor. “She will not stop until she nails it.”\n\nShelton worked with Proctor on every decision in the process. Her one outfit changes and adapts as this chaotic night ensues. “With Dakota we wanted to pay homage to this whole ‘70s vibe that the movie touches on, and yet still make her passably modern. I have an evolution. I start out really buttoned up, sort of a Hitchcock ice queen, with my hair up in a French twist, and my white lab coat, and very starchy. As the night unfolds, and things get more chaotic, and more traumatic, and uh, more dangerous, basically more awful things happen to me, I sort of ‘come undone.’ Nina has a real attention to detail that I connected with immediately. I was so excited to develop this character with her.”\n\nProctor had to create a costume that would endure all of Shelton’s many physical dilemmas, but would keep Shelton looking like a true grindhouse babe: “She falls out a hospital window, and then she has to rush home in the pouring rain, and she’s a wreck. But instead of really looking like a wreck she really starts to look, you know, more and more sexy.”\n\nThe grimy yet colorful palate continues with the brilliant production design of Steve Joyner. “I’ve been doing my own production design since SPY KIDS 2 and enjoying it because you kind of can start building sets, and conceptualizing the look of the movie while you’re writing the script,” Rodriguez says. “I don’t have anybody on that early except Stevie J. I took him to a prison and found these doors, and bars—paint peeling, and bubbled. I was taking pictures of all the different textures, and just going about why I like this, and why I like that. He got the whole look down perfectly.”\n\nThe cast is quick to point out the finer points of their trailblazing director’s use of technological advancements in order to create a streamlined, collaborative, comfortable environment. Shooting digitally afforded the cast the freedom from the constraints of running out of film or losing momentum from reloading. “He is a true visionary, and it’s such a pleasure to work with him,” Shelton says of Rodriguez. “I feel spoiled. We never have to deal with film. We don’t have to deal with film rolling out, we don’t have to deal with cutting. We don’t have to deal with a hair in the gate. It’s instant gratification because we can do take after take and sort of get our juices flowing, and get the performance right, and not have to stop for the technical clunkiness of film.”\n\n“Basically, he just turns the camera on during rehearsals,” Biehn says of Rodriguez’s comfortable, quiet process. “It’s just so relaxed, there’s never a sense that we have to ‘get it’ this time, or that film’s going to run out of the camera. It’s just magical for me. It’s just been great. It’s just the most relaxed situation I think I’ve ever been in, especially on a movie that’s kind of this big\n\nDespite the calm environment, Rodriguez’s PLANET TERROR wheels never stopped spinning (unless he happened to take a break to play his guitar). When he wasn’t directing, he worked with his editors on set, cutting a scene together on a laptop computer. “He’ll edit a scene as we’re shooting it, and then he’ll lay some music in underneath it,” Biehn says. “And you can watch it on the monitor and it’s just exactly what you’re going to see in the movie theaters.”\n\n“You just keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling. Sometimes we roll for an hour without cutting because you can just keep rolling,” he continues. “So you can find moments there that you might lose.”\n\n“Robert just breathes film,” Biehn says. “He just breathes it. I don’t know how else to say it. It’s great to work with somebody who has so much passion, and is so talented. Robert and Quentin are great to hang out with. They’re funny, they’re fun, articulate, they’re passionate, they’re both incredibly knowledgeable about movies past and present, and making movies. And they’re sweethearts, both of them.”\n\nThe Cast\n\nRose McGowan (Cherry): Rose McGowan had never uttered a word of English until the age of 10. Born and raised as a child in Italy, McGowan grew up surrounded by a large family in Florence and was as far away from the world of acting as one could be.

At seventeen years old, immediately after graduating from high school, Fahey chose to leave his family and answer the call of the “open road.” This “voyage of discovery” took him from Alaska to Europe, to Israel, where he worked on a kibbutz, to India, the exotic land where he turned 19 years old, to the Himalayas and Afghanistan. His great range and diversity as an actor may have found its roots during this exploratory period, when Jeff lived and learned of the lifestyles and cultures of the vast diversity of people around the globe. Working his way around the world by taking odd jobs at different ports, he worked as an ambulance driver in Germany, on the pipeline in Alaska, and on a fishing boat at some point in-between. In his early twenties, Jeff found himself once more in the United States and Jeff proved his adaptability and determination to succeed in Gratowski experimental theatre and the Studio Arena in Buffalo, New York. Through experimental theatre Fahey was introduced to the world of dance where he undertook the study of classical dance, modern dance and ballet with the likes of Martha Graham School, The Alvin Alley School and then with the Joffrey Ballet. At the Joffrey he was taken under the wing of legendary choreographer Agnes De Mille. The Joffrey Ballet led to stage roles, beginning with Broadway revival of Brigadoon, toured with Oklahoma, performed in Paris in West Side Story and in the West End in Orphans with Albert Finney. Upon returning to New York Jeff was set to star as ‘Gary Corelli’ in the popular daytime soap opera ONE LIFE TO LIVE. Jeff starred on daytime television in order to finance his own experimental theatre productions out of the Raft Theatre on Theatre Row. Jeff Fahey received his feature film break when he was offered the role of ‘Tyree’ in Lawrence Kasdan’s SILVERADO starring opposite Kevin Costner, Brian Dennahey, Kevin Kline, and Danny Glover. From his breakthrough in SILVERADO in 1984, and continuing in an unbroken line to the present day, Jeff Fahey has never experienced a lull in his acting career. Working along side of Robert Mitchum, Brian Denahey, Pierce Brosnan, Clint Eastwood, just to name a few and with directors like Larry Kasdan, Sandra Locke, John McKinsie, Clint Eastwood, Dan Petrie Sr. and Gary Sinise. In 1994, Jeff was offered the opportunity to star in the television series, THE MARSHAL, produced by his close friend, and acting colleague, Don Johnson. Fahey has said that more than any other vehicle he had acted in to date, his own personality, values, and feelings become encompassed in the character that was to evolve, and emerge, as Winston MacBride. Unique in its concept, the show starred only Fahey - as he liked to say in interviews at the time - \"one man, one hour\". Never one to wait for life to catch up to his aspirations and goals, Fahey now added producing to his resume. Jeff has brought his passion for film to the other side of the camera as a producer on the films CLOSE CALL, CHOOSING MATTHAIS, EXTRA MARITAL, THE UNDERGROUND, and THE SWEEPER. All of Fahey’s endeavors in producing have been both critical and financial successes. Fahey has recently been in Afghanistan and the Middle East to spearhead the opening of the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan, and to promote the women’s rights initiatives in Afghanistan. Fahey continues to seek out roles that allow him to stretch the bounds of his own individuality and to explore the human condition. His movies, therefore, represent an extremely eclectic mixture of type and content, as Fahey has repeatedly accepted the challenge of portraying multiple personas that are living and reacting to a variety of lifestyles and experiences.\n\nMichael Biehn (Sherriff Hague): Michael Biehn was born in Anniston Alabama and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska and Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Biehn worked in local theater productions and won a theater scholarship to the University of Arizona. After moving to Los Angeles he quickly found success in television.

In addition to GRINDHOUSE, Andrews has two exciting “big screen” film projects expected in 2007: Andrews stars as Jodie Foster’s fiancée in director Neil Jordan’s THE BRAVE ONE, an urban suspense thriller about a woman who recovers from a brutal attack and sets out on a dark psychological and physical journey for revenge and justice. The film also stars Terrence Howard and Mary Steenburgen and is produced by Joel Silver and Susan Downey. Warner Brothers has scheduled a June ‘07 release. Andrews will also be seen starring opposite Aishwarya Rai in the British film PROVOKED based on a true story about a woman who was jailed for killing her abusive husband. Miranda Richardson and Robbie Coltrane co-star. The film received accolades at this year's 2006 Cannes Film Festival and will be released in 2007. Though he was born and raised in London, and is of Indian descent, Andrews says he has found his true home in Hollywood. He began his entertainment career as a teen-age musician, guitarist and composer; then, he won entry to the prestigious Guildhall School of Drama during a time that also produced the screen stars Ewan McGregor and David Thewlis. Fresh out of university, he was cast in Hanif Kureishi’s look at the London rave scene, LONDON KILLS ME. He went on to put his musical talents to work in his next film, WILD WEST, starring as a Pakistani who dreams of finding country music success in Nashville, for which he was nominated for the Evening Standard Award for Most Promising Newcomer. Andrews then broke out into the international spotlight starring as Lt. Kip Singh, the Sikh with a talent for defusing bombs who finds a romantic connection with Juliet Binoche, the English Patient’s nurse, in Anthony Minghella’s Academy Award winning romantic epic THE ENGLISH PATIENT. Andrews’s accolades for the film included sharing the Screen Actor’s Guild Outstanding Performance by a Cast Award and the Best Supporting Actor Award at the Chrlotrudis Awards. On the heels of that success, he went on to star in a wide variety of films, including Mira Nair’s KAMA SUTRA, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, TRUE LOVE AND CHAOS, ROLLERBALL and DROWNING ON DRY LAND, starring with Barbara Hershey (with whom he is now partnered.) Adding to his growing reputation as an actor of broad range and appeal, Naveen recently took on leading roles in two diverse film projects: portraying a poet caught in a love triangle in Jane Weinstock’s modern romantic comedy EASY and starring as the eminently eligible bachelor Mr. Balraj in Gurinder Chada’s (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) riotously colorful Bollywood version of a classic literary tale, BRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Andrews has also found success playing memorable characters on high-profile television, beginning with the starring role of a 1970s London high-schooler in the BBC mini-series THE BUDDAH OF SUBURBIA, based on Hanif Kureishi’s comic novel. He was awarded the Best Actor Award at the San Remo Film Festival among other accolades for the role. He garnered further critical notice starring in THE CHIPPENDALE MURDERS, the true story of Steve Banerjee, whose founding of a male strip club for women led to betrayal and murder. Working again with director Mira Nair, Andrews starred as Dr. Abraham Verghese in the telefilm, MY OWN COUNTRY based on Varghese’s autobiography and in the telefilm “The Peacock Spring” based on Rumor Godden’s novel. This year Andrews starred as Menerith, who was torn between loyalty to his own civilization and his deep love for his step-brother, Moses (Dougray Scott). in the epic, four-hour ABC Premiere Event, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, filmed on location in Morocco. Andrews's ability to portray such a variety of roles and nationalities, combined with his depth, sensuality and musical talent makes him a true rarity.\n\nStacy Ferguson (Tammy): It has been three years since a girl named Stacy Ferguson walked into the studio to record the track “Shut Up” with hip-hop group The Black Eyed Peas, and her life has since changed forever. Though she already had peeped fame as the voice of Sally and Lucy in the cartoon series Charlie Brown, a cast member of Kids Incorporated during her teen years, and a member of the all-female pop trio Wild Orchid, nothing could compare to the slamming success of being recruited by BEP. Fergie first joined The Black Eyed Peas in 2002, and was on hand when the release of their first disc together, Elephunk, went triple platinum, thrusting the group into the spotlight. The mega-single “Let’s Get It Started,” earned The Peas their first Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Two years later the follow-up Monkey Business yielded five Top 40 hits including “Don’t Phunk With My Heart” and “My Humps” and has sold over four million copies. Once again, The Black Eyed Peas won the Best Rap Performance for “Don’t Phunk My Heart.” A few months later, at the 2006 MTV Awards, they won a moon man for best Hip-Hop Video. Yet, even after selling millions of discs, racking in the awards and touring constantly, Fergie is still not ready to slow down. On her stellar debut The Dutchess, the California native has constructed the perfect pop for musically diverse people. “I listen to everything from pop to reggae, old school hip-hop to soul ballads,” Fergie states. “Even now I can remember how happy I’d be as a kid whenever my parents played Temptations or Smokey Robinson songs on the stereo.” She continues, “This record is the realization of a dream I’ve had since I was seven, it’s almost hard to believe that the time has finally come.” A jamming master-mix of styles, Fergie and her producers (including will.i.am, Polow Da Don and John Legend) have created an album to suit even the most eclectic of tastes. As the first release off his newly formed will.i.am music group label, BEP’s leader and producer will.i.am is ready to kick start a new music revolution. Indeed, Fergie has nothing but love for the man that helped make her a star. “Will is a walking musical encyclopedia. He is not only a wonderful musician, but he can take samples others never even thought about and make them into wonderful songs.” Case in point would be the vintage Little Richard song (“The Girl Can’t Help It”) that will flipped into a mid-tempo love song “Clumsy” that is irresistibly sweet and addictive. “Me and will sat in the studio for two hours just listening to old songs,” Fergie explains. “When I heard the Little Richard beat, I knew we had found the right one. The vibe just worked for us.” The Dutchess opens with the second single “Fergalicious,” a quirky rump shaker that introduces the sexy hit maker to folks who have seemingly been sleeping in caves. A blissful romp that utilizes heavy bass and back in the day 808s to create a track that would sound perfect bumping from a custom ride. Fergie says, “When I was younger, I used to go to a club called Studio K and dance for hours to JJ Fad and MC Lyte. ‘Fergalicious’ is the song I wanted to make, because it has that throwback appeal that reminds me of being in junior high school.” Leading listeners to the dance floor with groovalistic savvy, is Fergie’s first single “London Bridge.” The song made history as it bulleted its way up the Billboard Hot 100 chart, reaching the #1 spot in 3 short weeks, the second highest jump ever recorded by Billboard. “London Bridge” also made its presence known in the digital realm as it topped the iTunes Top 100 songs chart as well. Teaming with Atlanta beat-master Polow Da Don, the duo created a masterful track that bumps wildly over rowdy rhythms, blaring sirens and catchy hooks. “We had so much fun recording ‘London Bridge,” Fergie recalls. “Polow is unafraid to have his music all up in your face. He makes tracks that are aggressive, but also very danceable.” In addition, showing his more chilled out side, Polow also produced the sleek song “Glamorous,” a track of upper mobility that features Ludacris. “It kills me how clever Ludacris is,” Fergie observes. “All you have to do is listen to him to see that he is fun and deep at the same time.” Going deep herself, Fergie reveals a rather dark side of her life on the ska influenced “Voodoo Doll.” Over blaring horns and precise percussion, Fergie poetically deals with her former demons. Touching on the subject of drugs, the rock-out of “Losing My Ground,” produced by Ron Fair and Rob Bolot, is powerful. “Being on crystal meth is like having devils and angels fighting in your head, and the devils usually win.” Journeying into West Indian riddims is the equally compelling “Mary Jane Shoes,” which features a rare appearance from reggae queen Rita Marley and the I-Three’s. “When Rita walked into the studio, I just knew that I was blessed,” Fergie remembers of the fateful day the two collaborated. Like a cool island wind, “Mary Jane Shoes” is as laidback as it is beautiful. “I had read Rita’s autobiography and thought she was an amazing woman. Rita does not work with many artists, so having her on my record was special.” The Dutchess closes with love song that Fergie recorded with R&B soul man John Legend. Like the theme song to a flick yet to be made, “Finally” is a sweeping ballad that has a genuine sweetness to it. Featuring Legend’s beautiful piano throughout the piece, Fergie says, “Me and John have been trying to get together for years. This was the last song we recorded, and to me it has the makings of a classic.” With perfect balance between darkness and light, Fergie delivers a stunning disc that leaves one yearning for more. All hail The Dutchess.\n\nElise and Electra Avellán (The Crazy Babysitter Twins): Elise and Electra Avellán are proud to make their feature debut in GRINDHOUSE as The Crazy Babysitter Twins. Born and raised in Venezuela, Elise and Electra moved to Dallas four years ago. The twins, now twenty, did not speak English prior to their arrival in the US. Following the completion of their high school education, Elise and Electra studied acting for a year in Austin. After shooting their roles in Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's eagerly anticipated double feature, Elise and Electra relocated to Los Angeles, where they are currently pursuing their acting careers. The roles of the Crazy Babysitter Twins were created for Elise and Electra by their uncle, Robert Rodriguez.\n\nThe Crew\n\nRobert Rodriguez (Writer/Director/Producer/Director of Photography/Editor): While a student at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, Robert Rodriguez wrote the script to his first feature film while sequestered at a drug research facility as a paid subject in a clinical experiment. That paycheck covered the cost of shooting his film. He planned to make the money back by selling the film to the Mexican home video market. The film was EL MARIACHI (1993), which Rodriguez wrote, directed, photographed, edited and sound-recorded – for $7,000. While shopping it to the video market, Rodriguez signed with a powerful agent at ICM. Columbia Pictures then bought the rights and signed Rodriguez to a two-year writing and directing deal. “El Mariachi” went on to win the coveted Audience Award for best dramatic film at the Sundance Film Festival, and was honored at the Berlin, Munich, Edinburgh, Deauville and Yubari (Japan) festivals. EL MARIACHI became the lowest budget movie ever released by a major studio and the first American film released in Spanish. Rodriguez wrote about these experiences in Rebel Without a Crew, a book published by Dutton Press. Although it was an astonishing debut for a 23-year-old, Rodriguez was already a seasoned filmmaker. The third of ten children born to Cecilio and Rebecca Rodriguez in San Antonio, Texas, he had prepared for film production classes at UT by making a series of his own home movies. Family members were recruited as cast and crew. His three youngest siblings starred in BEDHEAD (1991), a 16 mm. short film that was honored at many national and international festivals. Rodriguez also blossomed as a cartoonist at UT with “Los Hooligans,” a comic strip in the Daily Texan featuring characters based on his brothers and sisters. Rodriguez went on to write, produce, direct and edit DESPERADO (1995), a sequel to EL MARIACHI for Columbia. The film introduced American audiences to Antonio Banderas as a leading man, opposite Salma Hayek. Rodriguez also wrote, directed and edited THE MISBEHAVERS again starring Antonio Banderas in 1995, one of the four segments of Miramax Films’ FOUR ROOMS. He then teamed up with Quentin Tarantino on the outrageous FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996) for Dimension Films. Rodriguez directed a cast including Tarantino, who wrote the script. He also edited the film and served as executive producer. Rodriguez’s next directorial project was Dimension Films’ THE FACULTY (1998) starring Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood and Jordana Brewster. In 2001, Robert fulfilled a lifelong dream and created the family adventure film. SPY KIDS, a critically acclaimed and box office success, went on to break 100 million domestically. He followed that with SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS which won rave reviews and SPY KIDS 3-D, an adventure in 3-D. The third installment to the EL MARIACHI trilogy, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO, was released on September 12, 2003, which Robert shot, chopped and scored himself. He also served as writer of this film. In a matter of months Robert Rodriguez opened two movies at number one in the North American box office – SPY KIDS 3-D: GAME OVER and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. In 2004 Robert began his next endeavor FRANK MILLER’S SIN CITY, which is co-directed by the creator of SIN CITYhimself Frank Miller. SIN CITY features an all star cast including Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy and Benicio Del Toro, among many others. It hit theaters April 1st 2005. Also in 2004 he returned to his love of family fare with THE ADVENTURES OF SHARK BOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D starring funny man George Lopez. THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D was released in June 2005.\n\nElizabeth Avellán (Producer, PLANET TERROR): Elizabeth Avellán co-founded Los Hooligans Productions with Robert Rodriguez in 1991. EL MARIACHI, winner of the Audience Award at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, launched Avellán’s career as a producer. Shortly after that film’s tremendous success, she produced other popular films, such as: DESPERADO, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and THE FACULTY. Now Avellán is Vice-President of Troublemaker Studios, the production company that she and Rodriguez founded in 2000, which is based in Austin, Texas. Troublemaker Studios has since produced SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS, SPY KIDS 3-D: GAME OVER, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. Last year, Troublemaker released two very different films with much success: Frank Miller’s SIN CITY and THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL. Avellán was also an executive producer on In and Out of Focus, a documentary about balancing motherhood and a career in the film business. In addition, she executive produced SECUESTRO EXPRESS, a topical Venezuelan narrative about the dangerous trend of “express” kidnappings in her home country.\n\nSally Menke (Editor): Sally Menke most recently served as editor on Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL: VOL. 1 and KILL BILL: VOL. 2. Among her other credits are Billy Bob Thornton's ALL THE PRETTY HORSES and DADDY AND THEM. She also collaborated with Quentin Tarantino on RESERVOIR DOGS, JACKIE BROWN and PULP FICTION, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. She edited the segment \"The Man From Hollywood,\" from the full-length production FOUR ROOMS, as well as Oliver Stone's HEAVEN AND EARTH, The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe, Who Do You Think You're Fooling and Mulholland Falls. Her earlier credits include Cold Feet and Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nGreg Nicotero (Special Makeup Effects, PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF): The KNB EFX Group was formed in 1988 by Robert Kurtzman, Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero. In the last 18 years their talents have been highlighted in such films as DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE GREEN MILE, RAY, AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER and PULP FICTION. Emmy award winning effects artist Greg Nicotero began his career under the tutelage of director George Romero and effects master Tom Savini in Pittsburgh and quickly relocated to Hollywood. His skills as a coordinator helped him adapt easily to the needs of the film industry. Greg’s good natured personality and devotion has won over directors such as Frank Darabont, M. Night Shamalyan, and Quentin Tarantino. He has been responsible for storyboarding and designing effects sequences with Robert Rodriguez, Sam Raimi and Wes Craven from initial creature design to on set operation and 2nd unit direction. Greg’s overall effects knowledge has made him the perfect choice to supervise effects photography in the 20 years he’s been a make-up effects designer. Last year he was awarded a lifetime achievement award at the SITGES INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL in Spain and the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival MAKE-UP OF THE YEAR award for his work on SIN CITY. Since the company’s inception, Greg has excelled in a wide variety of effects. Prosthetics and character make-ups can be seen in everything from KILL BILL, to BOOGIE NIGHTS & ARMY OF DARKNESS. His work can currently be seen in Quentin Tarantino’s HOSTEL as well as THE HILLS HAVE EYES, directed by French Director Alexandre Aja. The work on Frank Miller/Robert Rodriguez’s adaptation of the graphic novels, SIN CITY has been getting praise for the character prosthetics created for Mickey Rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Nick Stahl and Rutger Hauer. Televsion staples such as DEADWOOD, 24 and LAW AND ORDER have showcased Nicotero’s work and continue to do so. This spring, the Mick Garris directed Stephen King adaptation of DESPERATION will feature some of KNB’S creepiest characters while Showtime’s MASTERS OF HORROR has reunited Greg with some of his past collaborators including John Carpenter, John Landis and Tobe Hooper. KNB has also met the demand for animal duplicates and animatronic “critters”. Kevin Costner gave them their first real challenge, to create the slain buffaloes for DANCES WITH WOLVES. Subsequently, they have provided ANIMATRONIC ANIMALS for ERASER, THE HULK, and CURSED, to name a few. Currently, the most ambitious project they have complete to date is, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA; THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE in which Greg and co-supervisor Howard Berger created literally hundreds of fantasy creatures ranging from prosthetic Satyrs and Centaurs to an animatronic Lion and dozens of Goblins and Crones.\n\nSteve Joyner and Caylah Eddleblute (Production Designers): Steve and Caylah have worked together in some form of art department assignment for the past eighteen years. They began working as set dressers together, then created their own Property Department where Robert Rodriguez took a chance on them with his 1995 release From Dusk Till Dawn. They have worked with Rodriguez ever since on movies including the three Spy Kids installments where they started working with fiberglass and molds which led them to building larger set pieces. They also worked on Once Upon a Time in Mexico,Sin City, as well as on Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown and Kill Bill. They just completed set design on the current collaboration between those two directors, Grindhouse.\n\nJeff Dashnaw (Stunt Coordinator): Veteran stunt coordinator Jeff Dashnaw is responsible for the action sequences in a multitude of feature films and television series. He has worked with Robert Rodriguez on seven of his films, including the SPY KIDS trilogy, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO, FRANK MILLER’S SIN CITY, and GRINDHOUSE. His television credits include coordinating stunts for episodes of CSI:MIAMI, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and ROSWELL. In addition, Dashnaw has also worked as a stunt double on such action-packed blockbuster hits as THE TERMINATOR, LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD 2, THE TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY, LETHAL WEAPON 3, THE MATRIX RELOADED and CRANK. His talents also run in the Dashnaw family – his wife Tracy and son JJ were responsible for performing some of the major action sequences on both segments of GRINDHOUSE.\n\nNina Proctor (Costume Designer): Nina Proctor, who serves as costume designer for GRINDHOUSE, the double bill featuring Robert Rodriguez’s PLANET TERROR and Quentin Tarantino’s DEATH PROOF, has collaborated with Rodriguez on six films including the SPY KIDS trilogy, FRANK MILLER’S SIN CITY and SHARK BOY AND LAVA GIRL THREE-D. In addition, Proctor has also worked on such films as ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, DR. T AND THE WOMEN, AMERICAN OUTLAW, and THE RETURN.\n\nDEATH PROOF\n\nWritten and Directed by Quentin Tarantino\n\nSynopsis\n\nFor Austin’s hottest DJ, Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), dusk offers an opportunity to unwind with two of her closest friends, Shanna and Arlene (Jordan Ladd and Vanessa Ferlito). This three fox posse sets out into the night, turning heads from Guero’s to the Texas Chili Parlor. Not all of the attention is innocent: Covertly tracking their moves is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a scarred, weathered rebel who leers from behind the wheel of his muscle car. As the girls settle into their beers, Mike’s weapon, a white-hot juggernaut, revs just feet away…\n\nAlso starring in DEATH PROOF are Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoë Bell, Rose McGowan, Omar Doom and Eli Roth. DEATH PROOF will be shown with Robert Rodriguez’s PLANET TERROR as part of the GRINDHOUSE double bill.\n\nAbout The Production\n\nDEATH PROOF is the fifth film from Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThough Tarantino categorizes DEATH PROOF as a slasher film, upon closer analysis, he amends the film’s genre classification: “It fuses the slasher film with high-octane car chase action, which was a big staple,” Tarantino says. “They’re fused so much so that the genres switch hand at some point in the movie. I don’t even know exactly where that point is, but there is some point in the film when you’re watching the last twenty minutes, you’re not watching what came before. You have actually switched genres and you’re into a different movie. You’re involved with the characters so you don’t notice it, but you’re actually in a different movie.” Though the concept seems unusual, those familiar with VANISHING POINT, DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY and GONE IN 60 SECONDS would notice a palpable shift from other 70s cinema prototypical slasher flicks like THE HOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE PARK and BLACK CHRISTMAS.\n\nBut to categorize the screenplay for DEATH PROOF as two distinct, genre-specific halves would be far too reductive. The film should also takes a cinematic leap by applying a period-specific film style (namely slasher and exploitation movies) and adding contemporary, independent, “badass” women in a genre in which scantily clad women were typically picked off one by one. In fact, the “final girl,” a character archetype associated with slasher movies, has an unexpected finality long before the closing credits. Moreover, self-reflexivity takes an unprecedented jump with the introduction of Zoë Bell, the person, the character, the stuntperson and the actor. The role of Zoë was written specifically for Bell, who was Uma Thurman’s stunt double in KILL BILL. In DEATH PROOF, she’s karma personified and delivered to a film production in Tennessee.\n\nFor all its differences, DEATH PROOF has motifs that are a trademark of Tarantino’s movie universe. There’s a familiar focus on people who work in the entertainment industry. The characters spend much of their time discussing popular culture. There are color schemes that are obvious nods to KILL BILL. Products like Red Apple cigarettes and even Earl McGraw make a return appearance.\n\nBut DEATH PROOF is also palpably different: the screenplay finds tension in leisure time, pleasure in examining the courtship process, and release in a blinding jolt of violence. It’s as much of a departure for the Oscar-winning writer/director/producer and now Director of Photography as any of his earlier films. “It’s the little simple things that get me because it really makes the movie,” Rosario Dawson, who plays Abernathy, says.\n\nMary Elizabeth Winstead, who plays aspiring starlet Lee, was taken by the complexity of the film’s female characters and the richness and authenticity of the dialogue. “They’re likeable, but they’re flawed at the same time, and the dialogue is real. He didn’t try to write ‘girlie’ dialogue. This is the way girls really talk. They swear as much as guys do, they get as dirty just as much as guys do. I think he understood that, which is very cool.”\n\nBut the attention to everyday minutiae isn’t merely for entertainment, or to shed light on our cyborg evolution. DEATH is in the details. Tarantino’s absorbing, entertaining dialogue builds a connection between the audience and a stalker’s prey. Dawson references one of the film’s most interestingly filmed scenes to exemplify this distinction: “No one would shoot a bunch of people sitting around a table talking about a newspaper article,” she says. “The scene seems really small, but he introduces really key points into the story in such subtle ways. Somehow you get sucked in because you’re just following the characters, and you get to learn about people in these conversational scenes. It’s striking, and it’s beautiful, and it’s incredible to watch.”\n\nDawson breaks the film down to its elements and comes up with this enthusiastic endorsement: “It’s going to be the best car chases, it’s going to be the most bad ass chicks you’ve ever seen, it’s going to be the most sinister, scary kind of killer who’s sinister and scary in the way that you’ve ever seen before. And it’s going to be fun. It’s going to be something you’ve never seen Quentin do.”\n\n“He takes the concept of grindhouse and then he subverts it with his very specific artistic preoperative,” Sydney Poitier, who plays Julia, comments. “He lifts it to this whole other level. It is a grindhouse movie but it’s also this other sort of indescribable, artistic expression. Quentin’s voice is Quentin’s voice, and it’s so influenced by the grindhouse era. We saw the movies that influenced him, and how they influenced what he created with this movie and with PULP FICTION and certainly with KILL BILL.”\n\nTracie Thoms, who plays Kim, adds: “It’s a slasher movie, a car movie, an action movie, and then a Quentin Tarantino movie, all at once. You have all the great dialogue that Quentin is brilliant at coming up with, and you have a crazy killer coming after you, and then you have a big car chase with dust and flips. There’s no CG. It’s just two cars going at it and ramming into each other repeatedly, and chasing each other. There’s a lot of action.”\n\nSTUNTMAN MIKE\n\nQuentin Tarantino announced the casting of Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike at Comic-Con, the yearly comic and genre film convention in San Diego, just weeks prior to the beginning of principal photography. Russell’s fans, who had admired his work in John Carpenter’s ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING hollered and cheered upon hearing the news of the casting. Tarantino comments on the choice of Russell for the role, given DEATH PROOF’s distribution with PLANET TERROR. “It seemed like there was a real symmetry to it. In the course of watching Robert make his movie, and watching the footage come out, and seeing it put together is that it started feeling like the John Carpenter movie he should have made in between ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING. It was unmistakable.” But the casting of Russell goes far beyond an appreciation for his work in Carpenter’s movies. Russell has shown tremendous range since his days as a child actor and DEATH PROOF provides him a departure from leading man-hood to create a truly evil, devious, deranged lunatic. Russell recalls a conversation he had with the director about the role: Quentin said to me, ‘I’d like for you to add this to your rogue’s gallery of characters.’ I said, ‘Boy I’d like to do that.’” Stuntman Mike has to charm and cajole and flirt, then incite fear and ultimately switch into someone who is maniacal and energetically terrifying. Creating a character who has such a wild range of emotion, and who is so deeply disturbed, was a true challenge for Russell: “The fun part has been working with Quentin in creating that character. It’s different from anything I’ve done. There were some key words here that I took to heart. One of the fun things I think is that character you do not see where the movie’s going, not for him anyway. His behavior is true to form, but quite radical.” Thankfully for his co-stars, Russell would leave Stuntman Mike in his scenes. “He comes in everyday with the biggest smile on his face, and he laughs, and he has so much joy when he does this,” Sydney Poitier says. “He made it feel so warm on set. Anytime he’s around he’s cracking up and Quentin’s cracking up. They just have these huge laughs. I can’t say enough good things about Kurt.”\n\nNOVA/CIVIC\n\nProduction for DEATH PROOF began on a blistering summer day in Austin, Texas. A group of three fresh-faced, gifted actors – Sydney Poitier, Jordan Ladd and Vanessa Ferlito -- crammed into a tiny red Honda Civic hatchback, and cruised along Austin’s Congress Avenue. Sydney Poitier plays Jungle Julia, the gorgeous Amazonian leader of this pack. Poitier is a graduate of NYU’s prestigious Tisch School and has appeared in several television programs, including “Veronica Mars” and “Ghost Whisperer.” Like the women that joined her in the Civic, Poitier went through a rigorous -- and extremely democratic -- audition process. Following a successful first audition in Los Angeles, Poitier was flown to Austin for a meeting and audition with Tarantino. Poitier had at least one cheerleader in the diminutive form of Jordan Ladd, who plays Shanna. The two actors had become friends through the audition circuit and through mutual friends. In fact, they had both auditioned for a Tarantino project earlier in their careers: “We both auditioned for Quentin for his CSI episode and neither one of us got it,” Ladd remembers. “When I read the script, the character of Jungle Julia, Sydney’s character, was described as a ‘six foot Amazonian goddess.’” Ladd took her audition as an opportunity to chat up Poitier’s abilities. “I said to him, ‘Did you read Sydney Poitier for this? Julia looks like her.’” “Jungle Julia is a drive time DJ for a radio station in Austin: Hot Wax 505,” Poitier says of her character. “She has this vast knowledge of music. She only plays her stuff – her collection she’s amassed over the years. Radio station be damned, it’s what she wants to play when she wants to play it. She’s become a local celebrity in Austin. She has a little bit of a following. She loves to be recognized, and she loves the attention, and seeks the attention. She’s a strong character, a very strong, powerful woman knows what she wants and knows how to get it.” Ladd ultimately won the role of Shanna, the film’s yellow rose of Texas: “I’m a girl from Austin who likes to have a good time,” Ladd says of Shanna. “I was described as a 'badass party animal.’” The California native tested out the authenticity Shanna’s accent with the crew in Austin. “The true test of whether or not I was pulling off the character was that none of the indigenous people of Texas thought my accent was bad. They said, ‘You sounded just like my sister.’” Ladd didn't have to go far to research the accent for the role: \"There’s one driver on the movie in particular named Peggy, who is an awesome lady with an incredible laugh, and an incredible accent. I slipped into Peggy’s accent when Shanna gets a little more inebriated. Her accent is just perfection.” Ladd and Poitier are joined by Vanessa Ferlito, who plays Arlene, the Brooklyn-born third of this hat trick. Tarantino had been a fan of Ferlito’s work since her brave debut performance in the independent feature ON_LINE. Ferlito met Tarantino while she was filming MAN OF THE HOUSE in Austin. She made quite an impact: Tarantino had Ferlito in mind when he wrote the screenplay for DEATH PROOF. “The role was written for me. When I read it, I asked, ‘Are you serious?’ I never expected it. We met by accident and suddenly he said ‘I have this role for you.’ It’s beyond, especially for an actor.” “She’s reuniting with her college buddies after several years,” Ferlito says of Arlene’s friendship with Julia and Shanna. “They’re feeling each other out, and feeling the relationship out. It’s hard when you’re apart for so many years. You’re so tight, and then you’re apart, and you evolve, and grow into these different women. We’re trying to figure that out in one night. You see the dynamic between the three girls and how much they’ve changed.” The role also gave Ferlito the opportunity to perform an intimate dance routine for Kurt Russell’s stuntman Mike. Russell recalls the experience: “I wouldn’t say she was nervous as much as she was anxious to do something really well. She didn’t want to do it wrong.” The three women formed a close bond prior to shooting of their first scene on Congress Avenue. They experienced a very social two week rehearsal period prior to the commencement of production. “It’s rare to get to rehearse on a movie, but there was so much bonding going on between the three of us that was so vital to the parts that we play in this movie,” Poitier says. “I think that was part of Quentin’s master scheme to throw us all together.” Indeed, reading lines and discussing characters was just part of the creative process: “It was like being in college again, staying in each other’s rooms until five in the morning talking about everything. It really solidified our personal relationships. That carried over into the characters. When we started work it was like everything was second-hand. Usually on the first day of work you’re nervous, and you have to work out the kinks, and you’ve got to find a rhythm with your other actors. It was there for us from the get-go. We had been hanging out and talking for two weeks, and really getting to know each other.” Ladd was chosen to be the entertainer between takes: “We keep each other entertained, that’s for sure,” Ferlito says. “We know how to like keep it new, and keep it fresh. I’ll just say, ‘Jordan, please do something to make me laugh.’ She’ll say, ‘What am I, the show monkey here?’”\n\nJoining the three actresses are their suitors: Eli Roth, Michael Bacall and Omar Doom. Ladd relished in the opportunity to cozy up with writer-director Eli Roth, who cast her in his breakout hit CABIN FEVER. “We didn’t know that CABIN FEVER would have the audience that it had, so we got to experience the horror genre and the ho"
