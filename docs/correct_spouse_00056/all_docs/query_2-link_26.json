        "text": "From major box office hits to cult classics, Austin has provided a spectacular landscape for filmmakers to bring their vision to life. Visitors have flocked to destinations featured in iconic locally made films like \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" With over 50 years of production, there are many film tourism locations in the Austin area to experience including those seen in \"Grindhouse.\"\n\nAbout \"Grindhouse\"\n\n\"Grindhouse\" is presented as a double feature, combining director Robert Rodriguez's \"Planet Terror\" - an exploitation horror film about a group of survivors who battle zombie-like creatures, and Quentin Tarantino's \"Death Proof\" - a slasher about a murderous stuntman who kills young women with modified muscle cars. Both films used some very iconic Austin locations.\n\nDetails: Dimension Films / Rated R / 191 minutes / Action, Horror, Sci-Fi, Exploitation\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez / Quentin Tarantino\n\nCast: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Zoë Bell\n\nPlanet Terror Streaming On: @YouTube, @PrimeVideo, @GooglePlay, @VuduFans, @MicrosoftStore, @iTunes, @Redbox\n\nDeath Proof Streaming On: @YouTube, @PrimeVideo, @GooglePlay, @VuduFans, @MicrosoftStore, @iTunes, @Redbox\n\nLocations\n\nScene: Guero’s Taco Bar\n\n\"Death Proof\" kicks off with a scene where radio disc jockey Jungle Julia (Poitier), Arlene (Ferlito) and Shanna (Ladd) meet at Guero’s Taco Bar on South Congress and plan their Austin evening.\n\nLocation: Guero’s Taco Bar (1412 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704)\n\nScene: Texas Chili Parlor\n\nPart of the prologue to \"Death Proof\" was filmed at the Texas Chili Parlor (the real deal for the exteriors and an exact replica set for the interiors), where Quentin Tarantino's character, Lewis, buys a round of Chartreuse shots for Jungle Julia (Poitier), Arlene (Ferlito) and Shanna (Ladd). Stuntman Mike (Russell) also shows up and offers to give Pam (McGowan) a lift home.\n\nLocation: Texas Chili Parlor (1409 Lavaca St, Austin, TX 78701)\n\nScene: Bone Shack BBQ & Jasper’s Farm\n\nZedler Mill in Luling played two major locations in both parts of Grindhouse. In \"Planet Terror,\" it was a stand-in for the production-designed Bone Shack BBQ, operated by JT (Fahey). And in \"Death Proof,\" it was the Jasper’s Farm backlot where Abbie, Kim, Lee and Zoe (Bell, Dawson, Winstead, and Thoms) check out the Dodge Challenger for sale.\n\nLocation: Zedler Mill (1170 S. Laurel Ave, Luling, TX 78648)"
