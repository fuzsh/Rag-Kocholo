        "text": "ESTATE OF ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, Deceased. (02/3747/A/B/C) — The 48-year-old decedent, Robert Rodriguez, was struck and killed instantly as a pedestrian at the corner of 86th Street and Avenue U in Brooklyn on March 10, 2002, when two cars collided. At the time of his death, he was employed as a porter earning $21,000 per year. Decedent’s surviving spouse obtained limited letters of administration and sued the two defendants for decedent’s wrongful death. She petitions here for approval of a proposed compromise of a wrongful death action, and to allocate and account for the proceeds. In addition to his spouse, decedent was survived by two children, one, Robert James Rodriguez (“Robert”), an adult, and the other, Nicholas Jay Rodriguez (“Nicholas”), a minor, for whom a guardian ad litem was appointed. The guardian ad litem raised several issues regarding the proposed distribution, which includes a structure for future payments, but these were resolved by a stipulation, which the guardian ad litem requests court authorization to enter into on behalf of his ward. That authorization is granted to the guardian ad litem, as discussed in further detail below.\n\nA settlement in principle of the underlying wrongful death action was reached in 2004. One defendant’s insurer, Allstate Insurance Company, offered $250,000 in settlement, while the other defendant’s insurer, Newark Insurance Company, had offered the limit of its policy, or $50,000. The Newark Insurance Company, however, filed for bankruptcy protection shortly thereafter. It was Newark Insurance Company’s bankruptcy that petitioner’s attorneys claim delayed this matter for several years. Pursuant to Article 76 of the Insurance Law, respondent New York Liquidation Bureau has confirmed that the Superintendent of Financial Services (formerly known as the Superintendent of Insurance) will pay the $50,000 policy limit that Newark Insurance Company offered before its insolvency."
