        "text": "As an experiment, I've been remaking the same ten episodes of Bad Goddess and Marller Gets a Spinoff over and over again with twenty different actors switching out as the Public Access Time Lord character Doctor What to showcase how an actors physical appearance and persona can completely change the outlook of a movie. These actors include Ted Raimi, John Waters, Rob Zombie, Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, Richard Brake, Andy Kaufman, Dian Bachar, Corey Feldman, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, Kevin J O'Connor, Steve Martin, Danny Trejo, Andy Dick, Joel Osteen, Randy Rainbow, Alan Cumming, and Austin Chief of Police Brian Manley.\n\nWhich brings me to: Robert Rodriguez.\n\nDespite directing ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL, there were logical reasons to consider him.\n\nDoctor What is sometimes played by Cult Film Directors, and Robert Rodriguez directed From Dusk Till Dawn and Grindhouse. He's an Austin Texas Director. More than a few of my friends from Zombie Life TV have worked as extras in his films, including Pablo Flores from the band Worm Suicide, who appeared in my movies Brenda Fest at Texas Mist and the Gore Noir Eighth Anniversary Special.\n\nThe First Two Seasons of Bad Goddess were conceived during my internship at Austin Public Access, which is where Robert Rodriguez edited El Mariachi back during his early days before he was famous. And he has a television contest show called Rebel Without a Crew where he challenges filmmakers to make their magic on the same low budget that he did. Nearly all of my movies are shot on a budget of zero. The only film on my resume that comes even close to having a budget is A Certain Magical Pimpdex Extended Edition, because of all the money I spent on buying the Source Material DVDs.\n\nBut even with all that, he wasn't my favorite choice... that is... until I realized, if you insert Robert Rodriguez into the episodes Love Bites and Anniversary Special as Doctor What, then suddenly it completely changes the purpose of the episode, and it becomes a commentary on his own relationship issues. And if you put Rose McGowan in The Moral Dilemma as Doctor What, then it changes the point of the episode and makes it about her vendetta against producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAnd then it hit me... The Hellsing Peccadillo is about a Showdown. If you insert Robert Rodriguez's ex-wife Elizabeth Avellan into The Hellsing Peccadillo as Doctor What, and Rose McGowan as the vampire Alucard, and Robert Rodriguez as Mara Marller, then suddenly the entire point and purpose of the movie changes into an Allegory Film about Robert Rodriguez's Divorce back during the shooting of the movie Grindhouse and how Social Media tried to smear Rose McGowan as a Homewrecker and a Monster because Robert Rodriguez made the mistake of trying to date his leading actress on the Rebound. When my own marriage fell apart, Michael Ludlow warned me not to date anybody for an entire year. I completely understand why. Basically, through creative casting, I've just turned my own fan film into a story about Two Female Time Lords engaging in a Cat Fight.\n\nMarller Gets a Spinoff: The Hellsing Peccadillo was NOT written for Robert Rodriguez. It was a star vehicle developed for blacklisted actor Stephen Geoffreys of Fright Night fame so that he could have a villain to battle within the vampire Alucard from the Hellsing anime series. No matter how many different versions of this movie that I'm going to make, it will ALWAYS be Stephen Geoffreys movie. Without him, the film wouldn't exist at all.\n\nThis idea is fucking fascinating. Elizabeth Avellan, Robert Rodriguez, and Rose McGowan might be initially annoyed with me for the concept, but if I actually went out and made this experiment in filmmaking, I assure all of them that the end result would be too weird for anybody to get upset over. Which is exactly what I just did. I went out and made it.\n\nDo you remember Pee Wee's Big Adventure? At the end of the movie, Pee Wee sells off the movie rights to his life, and when he watches the premiere of the film at the Drive-In, the actor they've cast to play him is this James Bond Secret Agent type that is nothing like him and they've turned his biopic into a Spy Thriller. This idea works on the same concept.\n\nThe Marller Gang cartoon characters are going to a movie premiere at Alamo Drafthouse, where Robert Rodriguez has directed a remake of their adventure The Hellsing Peccadillo. Only to their horror, when the lights go down, they are all shocked to find that instead of properly casting the movie, Robert Rodriguez has taken the lazy way out by casting all of his friends and family members in the roles of The Marller Gang that do not resemble their source characters in any way shape or form. And he has not made any changes to the screenplay dialogue to accommodate them. The context of the movie has been changed into an Allegory Film about his own Relationship Drama during the shooting of the movie Grindhouse. And I shall hereby dub this project RODRIGUEZ GETS A SPINOFF.\n\nTry also to remember that the context of Bad Goddess is it's made by a disgruntled intern who is using his cartoons to maliciously flip off his bosses for revenge so that they will fire him and he can collect unemployment. Using the satire element of the show to comically flip off all of the big name actors, producers, and directors that could have your career destroyed is exactly what you are supposed to do on this show.\n\nOnce again, this is NOT a film pitch. This experimental film has already been made, on a budget of zero at that, and hopefully you are about to watch it. You can watch it on YouTube, or you can download the DVD files here, burn them to DVD-R, and watch them on a TV set. Out of respect to the original Doctor What actor Stephen Geoffreys, both versions of the film are included on the DVD side by side as the film is relatively short.\n\nNote: You have to be logged into YouTube for the Video to work because of the Age Restriction. I have to keep the videos locked down like this to comply with COPPA. If you can't get them to work, there is also the FilmHub video links at the bottom of the page.\n\nRodriguez Gets a Spinoff: The Hellsing Peccadillo The Divorce Allegory Cut.\n\nMarller Gets a Spinoff: The Hellsing Peccadillo Extended Director's Cut.\n\nFilmHub Rodriguez Gets a Spinoff: The Hellsing Peccadillo The Divorce Allegory Cut\n\nFilmHub Marller Gets a Spinoff: The Hellsing Peccadillo Director's Cut"
