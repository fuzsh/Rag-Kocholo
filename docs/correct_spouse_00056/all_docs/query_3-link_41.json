        "text": "The father of Leandro De Niro Rodriguez was seen escorting his ex-wife to her West Village home Monday afternoon — one day after Leandro was found dead.\n\nArtist Carlos Rodriguez offered a touching sentiment to his son Leandro, the grandson of Robert De Niro, as he walked alongside the “Goodfellas” actor’s eldest daughter, 51-year-old Drena De Niro.\n\n“You can’t spell love without Leo,” he told The Post outside their Morton Street apartment.\n\nSeveral hours earlier, the former couple and another man believed to be Leandro’s uncle walked out of the building without speaking to the media.\n\nDrena was wearing a black shirt and blazer and a wrap on her head with a tan, black, and brown tessellated print and dark sunglasses. She put her head down and entered an SUV with the two men, which left in a three-car convoy.\n\nRodriguez returned to the home without the Zara suit bag he was carrying when the mourners left.\n\nLeandro, 19, was found dead Sunday at an apartment in Lower Manhattan where he was house sitting during a wellness check by a concerned friend.\n\nPolice are investigating the death as a possible overdose, law enforcement sources told The Post.\n\nThe teen’s lifeless body was sitting in a chair next to a white powdery substance believed to be cocaine, unidentified pills, and drug paraphernalia, the sources said.\n\nEarlier in the day Robert De Niro, 79, issued a statement to Page Six saying he was “deeply distressed” by the sudden death of his “beloved” grandson.\n\n“We’re greatly appreciative of the condolences from everyone. We ask that we please be given privacy to grieve our loss of Leo,” the eight-time Oscar winner said, through a spokesperson.\n\nA staff member at the Morton Street building remembered Leandro as “a very sweet boy,” who used to compliment him on how well he did his job — in contrast to many other well-heeled residents.\n\n“I saw him grow up,” said a porter named Richie, who declined to give his last name.\n\n“When he was little he would run up and hug me around the leg. As he got older, he became a very sweet guy,” Richie said of the young man, an actor in his own right who along with Drena had a role in the 2018 film “A Star is Born.”\n\n“He was always very mature for his age. He was a very smart kid. Just a very sweet guy.\n\n“We’re all shocked by what happened.”"
