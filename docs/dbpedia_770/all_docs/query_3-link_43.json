        "text": "Comedians Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont have separated after nine years of marriage the pair revealed in a statement today (April 12).\n\nIn the statement, the couple said they had “jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways”.\n\nThey continued: “As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being.\n\n“We will be making no further comment.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple have starred together Meet The Richardsons since 2020. The mockumentary sees them play “exaggerated versions of themselves”.\n\nThe duo also starred together on several outings of Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\nRecommended\n\nBeaumont was nominated in 2023 for a BAFTA TV award for Best Female Performance for her part in Meet The Richardsons. She also appeared on panel shows such as Have I Got News For You as well as comedy game show Taskmaster.\n\nRichardson was previously a team captain on 8 Out Of 10 Cats and launched the panel show Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, which ran on Dave for two seasons.\n\nHe also previously co-hosted with Russell Howard on BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\nSpeaking about the latest series of their show, Beaumont said: “I think this is the best one, to be honest. Every series we’ve got better and better.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple have previously discussed the challenges of working together, with Richardson saying: “To give us some credit, I think we are really good at what is quite an intense thing you know, working together on a project that does take the full year to write the series film the series, edit it and promote it.”\n\n“We’re always working on it and to balance that amongst still maintaining a private life isn’t easy, and I think we’re really good at it.\n\n“There’s times obviously it’s difficult because marriage is difficult anyway, you know, I could be a dentist and you know, Lucy could be a teacher and marriage is just difficult. So this extra element doesn’t make it any easier. But I do think we’re actually quite good.”"
