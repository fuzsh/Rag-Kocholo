        "text": "Comedian Jon Richardson is best known for his appearance on shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats, and Meet the Richardson’s - which he featured with his wife.\n\nThe 39-year-old has been very successful in his career since stepping into the industry back in the early noughties.\n\nJon, who is a Leeds United fan, leads a quiet life in Hebden Bridge, with his small family despite their big careers.\n\nRead more: Yorkshire takeaway boss rummages through customer's bin to find their 'missing' order\n\nFrom The Russell Howard Show, Have I Got News For You and more. There's more to Jon's life than you see on TV.\n\nWho is Jon Richardson?\n\nJon was born and raised in Lancaster but he lives in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire with his famous wife Lucy Beaumont and daughter Elsie Louise.\n\nHe dated his wife for two years before the couple married in April 2015. They were introduced to each other by mutual friend, famous comedian and writer Roisin Conaty.\n\nGrowing up, Jon attended Ryelands Primary School and Lancaster Royal Grammar School, a school which was founded between 1235 and 1256. It is also the UK’s thirty oldest schools.\n\nAt the University of Bristol, he studied Hispanic Studies for a year and a half, and then spent some time working as a chef. He swapped cooking for making people laugh as he pursued a career in comedy.\n\nIn May 2003, he won the BBC New Talent Comedy Search and the following year he reached the semi-finals of Laughing Horse New Act of the Year competition.\n\nFamous wife\n\nJon is married to famous comedian Lucy, from Hull. The mother of one turned to comedy after studying drama at the University of Hull.\n\nAfter university she worked as a teaching assistant but she ended up working at the university as a cleaner briefly when her first acting role fell through.\n\nMuch of her comedy routine mentions her working class background and she also appears on the mockumentary Meet The Richardsons with her husband.\n\nHer mum is playwright Gill Adams, who won the Fringe First Award for best new play in 1997 at the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nBattling OCD\n\nJon has spoken out after battling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder for years. In the past he has spoken about the seriousness of the condition and how he finally got it under control.\n\nHe has used his compulsive tendencies as the basis for much of his humour and back in 2013, he made a film on Channel 4 called A Little Bit OCD examining his need for perfection and cleanliness.\n\nThe Mirror reports he said: “I’ve had a lot of compulsions throughout my life which mainly started as a teen around the time I was doing exams.\n\n\"It’s when you start becoming in control of your own destiny for the first time and stop being a kid.\n\n\"OCD is a really serious condition – it’s a proper thing. It’s not just, ‘Oh, you like your pens to be straight’. For me, it would always go in tandem with being unhappy. The unhappier I was, the worse it got.\n\n“I remember a night when I was living in Swindon on my own, and I couldn’t sit on the couch because there were two cushions and I couldn’t sit equally between them.\n\n\"I could feel one was pushing in on one side more of my bum more than the other.\n\n“It got to the point where I couldn’t sit at all. I was standing up in my own flat with all this furious energy coursing through me.\n\n“I was very aware it was mad. But that’s not enough to make you be able to sit down on one side of the settee.\n\n\"You get yourself into a sort of limbo. You’re aware what you’re doing is stupid but powerless to do anything about it.\n\n“The key is just to do it, to sit down and realise nothing bad is going to happen. But at the time it was a burden.”\n\nRead next:"
