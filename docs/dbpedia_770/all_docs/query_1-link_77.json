        "meta_description": "Nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whom some regard as the first existential philosopher, has shaped philosophical, religious, and political thought into the twenty-first century.  His writings have influenced great poets, artists, musicians, and intellectuals from Kant to Foucault, including Freud, Mahler, Rilke, Camus, and Sartre.  He remains of interest to scholars and the general populace alike.  His works, such as Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, and Human, All Too Human, remain in print and are still being translated and widely read.  Select papers from the North American Nietzsche Society's annual conference are published in one issue per year.",

        "text": "Access current issues through Scholarly Publishing Collective, Project MUSE, or back content on JSTOR.\n\nThe Journal of Nietzsche Studies has become indispensable reading for all those who take Nietzsche seriously. It publishes the best work in continental and Anglo-American thought. In my experience every issue contains more than one article that forces one to reevaluate judgments that had been thought firm. —Tracy Strong, University of California, San Diego\n\nThe Journal of Nietzsche Studies is a peer-reviewed, English-language journal with an international readership, dedicated to publishing the best philosophical scholarship on the work and thought of Friedrich Nietzsche. The journal welcomes submissions that explore Nietzsche’s relevance to contemporary philosophical problems, as well as those deploying, and contributing to, the latest historical and philological resources.\n\nOriginally founded in 1991 as the journal of the Friedrich Nietzsche Society (UK), the journal is now owned by Penn State University Press and supported by Georgia State University, its editorial home.\n\nManuscripts intended for consideration should be electronically processed, double-spaced, with endnotes and a list of works cited. Manuscripts should not exceed 30 pages in length and should be prepared for blind review (i.e. the author's name and institutional affiliation should not appear in the manuscript). Electronic submission are preferred and should be uploaded to http://www.editorialmanager.com/jns/.\n\nAbbreviations and Citations of Friedrich Nietzsche's Works\n\nThe same citation format is utilized throughout the journal. References to Nietzsche's texts are given in the body of the articles. References to Nietzsche's unpublished writings are standardized, whenever possible, to refer to the most accessible edition of Nietzsche's notebooks and publications, Kritische Studienausgabe (KSA), compiled under the general editorship of Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari. References to the edition of letters, SÃ¤mtliche Briefe: Kritische Studienausgabe, are cited as KSB.\n\nRoman numerals denote the volume number of a set of collected works or standard subdivision within a single work, and Arabic numerals denote the relevant section number. In cases in which Nietzsche's prefaces are cited, the letter P is used followed by the relevant section number, where applicable. When a section is too long for the section number alone to be useful, the page number of the relevant translation is also provided. In the cases in which the Kritische Gesamtausgabe (KGW) and KSA are cited, references provide the volume number (and part for KGW) followed by the relevant fragment number and any relevant aphorism (e.g., KSA 10:12[1].37, p. 1 refers to volume 10, fragment 12[1], aphorism 37, page 1).\n\nThe following abbreviations are used for citations of Nietzsche's writings:\n\nA = The Antichrist\n\nAOM = Assorted Opinions and Maxims\n\nBGE = Beyond Good and Evil\n\nBT = The Birth of Tragedy\n\nCW = The Case of Wagner\n\nD = Daybreak/Dawn\n\nDD = Dionysian Dithyrambs\n\nDS = \"David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer\"\n\nEH = Ecce Homo (sections abbreviated \"Wise,\" \"Clever,\" \"Books,\" \"Destiny;\" abbreviations for titles discussed in \"Books\" are indicated instead of \"Books\" where relevant)\n\nFEI = \"On the Future of Our Educational Institutions\"\n\nGM = On the Genealogy of Morality/Morals\n\nGOA = Nietzsches Werke (Grossoktavausgabe)\n\nGS = The Gay Science\n\nGSt = \"The Greek State\"\n\nHC = \"Homer's Contest\"\n\nHCP = \"Homer and Classical Philology\"\n\nHH = Human, All Too Human\n\nHL = \"On the Use and Disadvantage of History for Life\"\n\nIM = \"Idylls from Messina\"\n\nKGB = Briefwechsel: Kritische Gesamtausgabe\n\nKGW = Kritische Gesamtausgabe\n\nKSA = Kritische Studienausgabe\n\nKSB = SÃ¤mtliche Briefe: Kritische Studienausgabe\n\nLR = \"Lectures on Rhetoric\"\n\nMA = Nietzsches Gesammelte Werke (Musarionausgabe)\n\nNCW = Nietzsche Contra Wagner\n\nPN = Portable Nietzsche\n\nPPP = Pre-Platonic Philosophers\n\nPT = Philosophy and Truth\n\nPTAG = Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\n\nRWB = Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\n\nSE = \"Schopenhauer as Educator\"\n\nTI = Twilight of the Idols (sections abbreviated \"Maxims,\" \"Socrates,\" \"Reason,\" \"World,\" \"Morality,\" \"Errors,\" \"Improvers,\" \"Germans,\" \"Skirmishes,\" \"Ancients,\" \"Hammer\")\n\nTL = \"On Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense\"\n\nUM = Untimely Meditations (when referenced as a whole)\n\nWP = The Will to Power\n\nWPh = \"We Philologists\"\n\nWS = The Wanderer and His Shadow\n\nZ = Thus Spoke Zarathustra (references to Z list the part number and chapter title followed by the relevant section number when applicable: Z:III \"On Old and New Tablets\" 1)"
