        "text": "The Museum of Contemporary Art Tucson is pleased to present GROPING in the DARK curated by Alex Young. GROPING in the DARK addresses human land use and the effects of the modification of Earthly matter upon interdependent ecologies of mind, society, and environment. The exhibition serves as an experimental presentational platform for artist-researchers whose ecological practices are informed by and actively agglomerate a diverse array of disciplines and media in examining world systems and developing new models of being-in-the-world. Spanning an array of inquiries into planetary scaled networks, agricultural engineering, multi-species entanglements, and the simultaneous expansion and collapse of anthropogenic space, the works collected for this exhibition take the form of in-depth ecological open works wherein their subjects are continuously observed, reexamined, acknowledged as far from fully knowable, and the assumed whole is always less than the sum of its parts. GROPING in the DARK is presented in response to our ecological moment and present reactionary political climate. In stark contrast to a backdrop of manifest anti-egalitarianism, hetero/cis-normative gender constructs, xenophobia, and speciesism, GROPING in the DARK gathers artist-researchers actively exploring plausible worlds through social ecology and multi-species intersectionality, migration, placemaking, and resilience.\n\nThe title of this exhibition is borrowed from the 1982 publication Groping in the Dark: The first decade of global modelling—produced as the conference proceedings for the Sixth International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis Symposium on Global Modelling—collaboratively authored by Donella Meadows, John Richardson, and Gerhart Bruckmann. Released ten years after Meadows co-authored The Limits to Growth—the foundational report on the findings of the World3 systems dynamics computer model simulating interactions between human population, industrial and economic growth, food resources, and the limits of earth ecosystems—Groping in the Dark was created as an experimental guide for the production of new world models and the modelling of new worlds. Constructed as a patchwork of disparate-yet-interconnected texts ranging from reports on major works and methodologies in global modelling, to ruminations on the contradictions and limitations of the burgeoning field, to a list of the editors’ respective biases—Groping in the Dark provided an abundance of entry points into then-current attempts to understand and create change within complex social and environmental systems. In a manner akin to its namesake, this exhibition joins practitioners and projects that employ diverse modes of thinking in the examination of how humans modify Earth systems and how we might better model new worlds.

Eric Simpson and Caleb Lightfoot , and SPURSE\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nEpicurean Endocrinology is a collaboration between Liz Flyntz and Byron Rich. Epicurean Endocrinology explores the effects of food on hormones, and hormones on food. Concerned with how food is gendered and how it is sexed, they use food and vernacular cooking to examine the intersections of food production, endocrine disruptors, corporate/institutional influence, and cultural ideology as they relate to biopolitics. By framing careful examination of the ways in which food affects hormone production and use in human bodies through the communal and culturally resonant act of cooking and consumption, Epicurean Endocrinology brings awareness to the ways in which endocrine disruptors permeate food through biological processes and by industrial agricultural externalities.\n\nLiz Flyntz is a curator, information architect, and occasional artist. She’s organized exhibitions and screenings about time capsules, money, ergonomic furniture, slogans, Radical Software, and rock n’ roll nostalgia for venues in NYC, DC, Baltimore, Olympia, and Weimar, Germany. The Present Is the Form of All Life, the book she co-edited about the time capsule works of media art and architecture group Ant Farm is available through DAP Press. She’s also written for The Creators Project, AfterImage, and Intercourse magazines.\n\nByron Rich is an artist, professor, and lecturer born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. His work exploring speculative design, biology futures, and tactical media ecology has been widely shown and spoken about internationally. He was the recent recipient of an Honorary Mention from Ars Electronica (2017), and runner-up at the Bio-Art & Design Awards in 2016. He pursued a BFA in New-Media from The University of Calgary before finding himself in Buffalo, New York where he received an MFA in Emerging Practices at The University at Buffalo.

His writing has appeared in international print and online journals and in the edited volumes Cities and Inequalities (Routledge, 2015) and Support Networks (Chicago Social Practice History Series, SAIC/University of Chicago Press, 2014). His recent work employs the form of documentary images and writing to address regional political ecologies and extractive agriculture.\n\nSarah Ross is an artist who works in sculpture, video and photo and teaches at The School of the Art Institute Chicago. Her projects use narrative and the body to address spatial concerns as they relate to access, class, anxiety and activism. Sarah also works collaboratively with Chicago Torture Justice Memorials and co-founded the Prison and Neighborhood Arts Project; two large scale cultural projects that work with survivors of police torture and currently incarcerated people. She has co-curated exhibitions at SPACES Gallery, Cleveland; Sea and Space Explorations, Los Angeles; and PS122, New York. Sarah is the recipient of grants from the Propeller Fund, Graham Foundation, the Illinois Art Council and she is currently an Open Society Foundation Fellow.

Their work spans amateur science, public workshopology, participatory performance, documentary, and speculative fiction. Maggic’s most recent projects Open Source Estrogen and Estrofem! Lab generate DIY protocols for the extraction and detection of estrogen hormone from bodies and environments, demonstrating its micro-performativity and potential for mutagenesis (i.e. gender-hacking) and toxicological embrace. They hold a BSA in Biological Science and Art from Carnegie Mellon University and a MS in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT Media Lab, and their work has been featured at several festivals and international venues including Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Transmediale; Berlin), Never Apart (Sight+Sound Festival; Montreal), Haus der elektronischen Kunst (Basel), Jeu de Paume (Paris), Institute of Contemporary Arts (Post-Cyberfeminist International; London), out sight (Seoul), Spring Workshop (Hong Kong) and CKSTER Gender Hacking Festival (Berne).

Her work explores how power is articulated through relationships, often focusing on the body and materiality in relation to narratives of state building, and histories of place. Manna received a BFA from the National Academy of Arts in Oslo and an MA in Aesthetics and Politics from California Institute of the Arts. She has participated in multiple festivals and exhibitions, including the Viennale International Film Festival, BAFICI, IFFR Rotterdam, Tate Modern, Marrakech Biennale 6 and The Nordic Pavilion, 57th Venice Biennale.

Trained in the discipline of architecture, Lightfoot’s work exists at the intersection of several fields. Collaborating with artists, architects, and classical archaeologists, his work addresses themes of land use, the built environment, culture, anthropology, and speculative design. Critical modes of representation and processes of engagement with places is a core research question that connects all of his work, implementing traditional tools as well as 3D modeling and digital post-processing. He has participated in several interdisciplinary field programs including Land Arts of the American West and the American team of archaeologist at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. He is also the coauthor of a book chapter entitled Describing Hermion/Ermioni.
