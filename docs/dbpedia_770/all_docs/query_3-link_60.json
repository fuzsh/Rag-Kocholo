        "text": "Rescheduled show from the 12th October 2020 and 27th November 2021, all original tickets remain valid. And now 10th March 2023. All original tickets remain valid\n\nResponse to the March 2023 reschedule:\n\nUnfortunately, due to the heavy snowfall, Jon is unable to travel to Dunfermline for tonight’s show. We are aware that this will be a massive disappointment to many as this show has been rescheduled previously due to the pandemic.\n\nIt will now take place on Friday 26th May 2023. Tickets will remain valid for the new date.\n\nResponse to the 2021 reschedule:\n\nJon Richardson: The Knitwit\n\nI’m very sorry to say that the Knitwit tour is going to be delayed by another year and will now start in September 2022.\n\nThe delayed reopening of clubs means quite simply that even were I to return to gigging immediately I couldn’t guarantee being ready to perform to the standard I expect when shows were due to begin in September and I don’t want to let down anyone who has paid for a ticket, especially when times are so hard.\n\nI am sorry for all those of you who were looking forward to coming along at the end of this year and I apologise also to the theatres and their staff who are depending on a return to normality to keep their doors open. I feel a great responsibility to you all and have had to make what I believe to be the best choice from two bad options.\n\nI recognise that for many of you this will be three years after you first bought tickets and I can only imagine how circumstances might have changed for you all in the meantime. As before you will contacted by your local theatre and offered a rescheduled date or a refund for your tickets. Please wait for the venue to contact you with the new date as they are working very hard to get shows rearranged.\n\nI apologise for a formal and sombre tone. I am in no doubt that not getting to hear my whining voice will not be the worst thing that happens to anyone this year, but still I am gutted not to be heading out on the road as promised. I hope to see you all next year with a show that will be worthy of your patience and loyalty.\n\nOff The Kerb Productions Present:\n\nJon Richardson: The Knitwit\n\nWill the recycling be put out on the right day? Who is going to smooth over the top of the margarine? How many lights are on upstairs when everybody is downstairs?\n\nWatch Jon pretend that these aren’t his foremost concerns as he leaves home on his first tour since the last one.\n\nBest known as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Cats Countdown (Channel 4), host of Dave’s Ultimate Worrier, and upcoming sitcom Meet the Richardsons.
