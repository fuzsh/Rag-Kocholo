        "text": "Will the recycling be put out on the right day? Who is going to smooth over the top of the margarine? How many lights are on upstairs when everybody is downstairs? Watch Jon Richardson pretend that these aren’t his foremost concerns as he leaves home on his first tour since the last one.\n\nJon Richardson is one of the UK’s finest live comedians, and he is back this autumn with an all new stand-up tour – The Knitwit. Be sure to catch him as he performs at some of the country’s top live venues, beginning at Chester Storyhouse on Tuesday 8th September, and ending at Warwick Arts Centre on Friday 11th December.\n\nJon has risen to the top of the comedy rankings with his brilliantly sophisticated, fastidious humour. His last tour, the critically acclaimed Old Man, saw him tour the UK for eighteen months between 2017 and 2018, and release his third best-selling comedy DVD. Jon has released two further DVDs of his earlier sell-out tours: Funny Magnet in 2012, and Nidiot in 2014.\n\nAs one of the most in demand comedy acts on TV, Jon is best known as team captain on Channel 4’s 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Cats Countdown as well as host of two series of Dave’s Ultimate Worrier. His other recent TV appearances include occasional host of The One Show, Would I Lie To You, Have I Got News For You, Insert Name Here, Hypothetical, Taskmaster, 2019’s The Great Celebrity Bake Off for SU2C, Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, Jon Richardson’s Guide To The End Of The World, plus the upcoming Channel 4 series Kevin McCloud’s Rough Guide To The Future."
