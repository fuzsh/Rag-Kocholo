        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n8 Apr 2024, 13:23\n\nCredit: Dave\n\nMeet The Richardsons returns to Dave tonight (Monday 8th April) and for comedian couple Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont, they get the shock of a lifetime when a brand new celeb moves in next door.\n\nThe mockumentary, which stars the hilarious duo as fictionalised versions of themselves, is back for another run of episodes, and series five kicks off with the pair discussing the love life of neighbour Phil.\n\nIn an exclusive preview clip of the debut of series five, Phil brings new girlfriend Joanne along to Jon and Lucy’s house, but the conversation quickly turns to who is moving in next door.\n\n“Do you think it’s the show, the Dave effect?” Lucy jokes, before rushing to the window to see a large moving lorry parking up outside.\n\n“Whoever it is, they’ve got better taste than us, look at all that stuff,” Jon says while peering through the curtains.\n\nThe couple are then shocked to see a box-fresh Tesla roll up onto the driveway, before they get an even bigger surprise, with former Pussycat Doll Kimberly Wyatt and real-life husband Max Rogers.\n\nBoth Jon and Lucy are left gobsmacked by their new showbiz street friends, but will they become fast pals once the couples meet?\n\nMeet The Richardsons began in February 2020, and was commissioned for a second series in August that year. Not only that, but the husband-and-wife duo were also front-and-centre of two Christmas specials and a third and fourth series after that.\n\nThe rib-tickling show has included the likes of Rob Becket, Alex Brooker and Jason Donovan, with many more massive names making appearances over the years.\n\nIn 2023, Lucy was nominated for Best Female Performance in a Comedy Programme at the BAFTA TV Awards, and Jon became an honorary member of Sheffield F.C after filming at the club."
