        "text": "Lucy Beaumont has been spotted for the first time since it was announced that she's separated from Jon Richardson.\n\nIt was announced last week that comedians Lucy, 40, and Jon, 41, have separated after almost a decade of marriage. The couple, who star in their own show Meet The Richardsons, issued a joint statement about their relationship and said they have decided to get divorced.\n\nJust days after the shock news, Lucy was seen outside the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff ahead of her sold-out show, wearing a brown shirt, a pair of grey jeans and black footwear. The comedian was seen carrying a WHSmith bag, with a water bottle seemingly among the items inside it.\n\nLucy resumed her latest stand-up tour with the show at the theatre this week. The former Taskmaster participant embarked on the Trouble & Strife tour last year and performed several shows last month too.\n\nLucy is now set to continue the tour in the coming days, with her due to be at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London on Friday and Saturday, before heading to Swindon next week. The tour doesn't have any dates after April until it resumes again later this year in October. Lucy is then scheduled to perform at various venues in the UK before concluding the tour in December, with the final performance due to be held at Connexin Live in her home city of Hull that month.\n\nLucy and her estranged husband Jon, who have been married since 2015, announced their separation in a joint statement last week. The former couple said their priority is \"managing this difficult transition\" for their daughter. They said: \"After 9 years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated. We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\"\n\nThe pair continued: \"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment.\"\n\nJust days later, Jon - who's known for having appeared on shows like 8 Out of 10 Cats - was spotted for the first time since the news. The comedian was seen attending an event in London. He was said to have been seen among the guests at a screening of an extended episode of the animated show Bluey held at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester Square.\n\nLucy and Jon had appeared together on several shows over the course of their marriage, including mockumentary series Meet the Richardsons. They also hosted Jon & Lucy's Party of the Year and later Jon & Lucy's Odd Couples."
