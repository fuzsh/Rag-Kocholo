        "text": "10 Ways to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse\n\nWritten by: Don Zolidis\n\nDirected by Melissa Goldman\n\nActors' Studio Production\n\nIt’s the end of the world, and hordes of rampaging zombies are about to kill you. What do you do? Try your hand at kung fu against the undead? Attempt to reason with creatures that would rather eat brains than use them? Turn to this handy and hilarious guide to survive the apocalypse! (Hint: “sacrifice the weak” is step number one.)\n\nCAST\n\nNarrator 1: Hannah Wurthmann\n\nNarrator 2: Macey Hamm\n\nChristy: Jera Sotero\n\nSusan: Izzy Mangren\n\nJimmy: Braedon Arnett\n\nSam: Spencer Baker\n\nZombie 1: Hope Varvel\n\nZombie 2/Jimmy Understudy: Jay Kaboff\n\nZombie 3: Erik Tanton\n\nAND\n\nZombie Prom\n\nWritten by: John Dempsey\n\nMusic by: Dana Rowe\n\nDirected by Jacob Deters\n\nMusic Directed by Caitlin Richardson\n\nChoreographed by Whitney Havice\n\nThis girl-loves-ghoul rock ‘n’ roll off-Broadway musical is set in the atomic 1950s at Enrico Fermi High, where the law is laid down by a zany, tyrannical principal. Pretty senior Toffee has fallen for the class bad boy. Family pressure forces her to end the romance, and he charges off on his motorcycle to the nuclear waste dump. He returns glowing and determined to reclaim Toffee’s heart. He still wants to graduate - but most of all, he wants to take Toffee to the prom. The principal orders him to drop dead, while a scandal reporter seizes on him as the freak du jour. History comes to his rescue, while a tuneful selection of original songs (in the style of 50s hits) keeps the action rocking across the stage.\n\nCAST\n\nJonny Warner: Kyle Klein II\n\nToffee: Tina Radi\n\nDelilah Strict: Emily Hogan\n\nEddie Flagrante: Andrew Simek\n\nCandy: Erin Kaufman\n\nCoco: Courtney Klein\n\nGinger: Alison Wiltgen\n\nJosh: Fred Scher\n\nJoey: Russell Zillman\n\nJake: Jay Kaboff\n\nENSEMBLE\n\n*Jenna Hall\n\n*Phia Marino\n\nLiz Martin\n\nNicolas Perez-Jandrich\n\nSamantha Wells\n\n* Denotes featured dancer\n\nVenue: Harold and Jean Miner Theatre\n\n7:30 pm Performances\n\nNovember 9, 10, 11, 17, 18\n\n3 pm Performances\n\nNovember 12, 19\n\nBoth shows are rated family\n\nPurchase tickets here\n\nTickets: Adult $25 | Student/Youth/Senior/Veteran $18 | 12 and under $12 | Opening night is half-price of an adult ticket ($12.50)\n\nAll Parkland Theatre tickets must be purchased either in advance online or from the ticket booth at the time of the performance. all sales are final - no refunds or exchanges. for more information, visit tickets.\n\nBecome a friend of Parkland Theatre.
