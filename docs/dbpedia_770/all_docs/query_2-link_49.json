        "text": "Their TV comedy Meet the Richardsons based on their real-life marriage has brought them legions of fans and awards but, just days after its fifth season debut, its stars Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont have announced they are to divorce.\n\nIn a statement shared on social media, they announced the split:\n\n“We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n“As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being.\n\n“We will be making no further comment.”\n\nThe couple, who married in 2015, debuted their mockumentary comedy in 2020. The show sees them play exaggerated versions of themselves, with other comedians and familiar faces on British TV making guest appearances.\n\nIndependently, both are comedians. Beaumont has appeared on numerous panel shows and bases many of her jokes on her home city of Hull in the north of England. Her role in Meet the Richardsons brought her a BAFTA nomination for comedy performance in 2023.\n\nRichardson was the host of Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, which ran for two series, also on Dave."
