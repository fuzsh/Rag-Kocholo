Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont.\"\n\nWho is Jon's wife Lucy Beaumont and do they have children?\n\nJon and Lucy lived in Hebden Bridge together with their daughter Elsie Louise, who was born in September 2016.\n\nLucy turned to comedy after studying drama at the University of Hull.\n\nShe also makes appearances on the mockumentary Meet The Richardsons with her husband.\n\nLucy and Jon also had another show, Jon & Lucy's Odd Couples which aired on Channel 4.\n\nThe celebrity panel game show sees the pair joined by two other couples who reveal their own marriage flaws while Lucy and Jon probe into their private lives.\n\nThe pair ultimately decide which of the couples has the best relationship."
