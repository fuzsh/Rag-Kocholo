        "text": "COMEDIAN Jon Richardson and his wife Lucy Beaumont have announced the end of their marriage after nine years.\n\nThe pair have become a well known couple after appearing on multiple shows together but their romance is no more. Here's what we know about Jon and his wife.\n\nWho is Jon Richardson?\n\nJon Richardson is a comedian born on September 26, 1982.\n\nHe grew up in Lancaster and attended Lancaster Royal Grammar School.\n\nHe later studied Hispanic studies at the University of Bristol for a year and a half before working as a chef.\n\nHe then swapped cooking for making people laugh as he pursued a career in comedy.\n\nIn May 2003, he won the BBC New Talent Comedy Search.\n\nHe rose to fame after joining 8 Out Of 10 Cats in 2011 taking over from fellow comic Jason Manford, and is now a regular captain on its spin-off, 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown.\n\nThe comedian has spoken out many times about his battle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\n\nHe uses his compulsive tendencies as the basis for much of his humour and in 2013 he made a film called A Little Bit OCD which examined his need for perfection and cleanliness on Channel 4.\n\nWhat TV shows has Jon been in?\n\nJon has made appearances in a number of well-known TV shows including:\n\nNever Mind the Buzzcocks\n\nMichael McIntyre’s Comedy Roadshow\n\nThe Museum of Curiosity\n\nHave I Got News for You\n\nStand Up For The Week\n\nWould I Lie To You?\n\nTaskmaster\n\nThe Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer\n\nJon has also guest presented on The One Show but is not the first comedian to have sat on the sofa - other presenters include Ed Byrne, Al Murray, Sarah Millican, Jo Brand and Omid Djalili.\n\nWhen did Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont marry?\n\nJon is married to famous comedian Lucy Beaumont.\n\nThe pair dated for two years before they married in April 2015.\n\nJon and Lucy were introduced to each other by mutual friend, famous comedian Roisin Conaty.\n\nAre Jon and Lucy still together?\n\nJon and Lucy announced they had separated on Friday April 12, 2024.\n\nReleasing a statement on Instagram, they said: \"After 9 years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated.\n\n\"We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n\"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive timeto protect her well-being.\n\n\"We will be making no further comment. Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont.\"\n\nWho is Jon's wife Lucy Beaumont and do they have children?\n\nJon and Lucy lived in Hebden Bridge together with their daughter Elsie Louise, who was born in September 2016.\n\nLucy turned to comedy after studying drama at the University of Hull.\n\nShe also makes appearances on the mockumentary Meet The Richardsons with her husband.\n\nLucy and Jon also had another show, Jon & Lucy's Odd Couples which aired on Channel 4.\n\nThe celebrity panel game show sees the pair joined by two other couples who reveal their own marriage flaws while Lucy and Jon probe into their private lives.\n\nThe pair ultimately decide which of the couples has the best relationship."
