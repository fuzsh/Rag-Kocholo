Senior cornerback Tyler Hall capped his career earning All-Mountain West Conference honorable mention for the second straight season.\n\nIn 2018, Wyoming’s defense was among the best in the nation, finishing the season No. 19 in total defense (326.2), No. 25 in rushing defense (129.5), No. 28 in scoring defense (22.0) and No. 32 in pass defense (196.7).

He was a member of the NDSU staff from 2009-13, spending the 2009-10 seasons as a student assistant before becoming a graduate assistant coach in 2011. During his time on the NDSU coaching staff, the Bison won three consecutive national titles in 2011-13.\n\nFrom 2011-13, Richardson helped NDSU to a 43-2 (.956) overall record and a 22-2 (.917) Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) mark on way to its three consecutive FCS national titles. The 2013 NDSU squad became the first undefeated (15-0) FCS National Champion since Marshall went 15-0 to win the 1996 title. NDSU extended its winning streak to 24 consecutive games with the 2013 FCS Championship, tying both the FCS and NDSU records for consecutive victories.\n\nAs a coach at North Dakota State (2011-13), Richardson helped the Bison lead the nation in scoring defense for three consecutive seasons, holding opponents to only 12.7 ppg in 2011, 11.5 ppg in 2012 and only 11.3 ppg in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 Bison defense also ranked third in the FCS in total defense (255.9); second in the nation in pass efficiency defense (97.5), third in rushing defense (91.3) and eighth in passing yards allowed (164.6).
