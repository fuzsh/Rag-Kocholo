        "text": "An outstanding defensive guard and tackle on UCLA's top-10 football teams in the 1960s, John Richardson found success on the football field and in the business world after his college career ended. Richardson was the ninth-round draft pick of Miami in 1967 and played defensive tackle for the Dolphins and St. Louis Cardinals before retiring following the 1973 season. He went on to build a business marketing and distributing firm, representing top furniture manufacturers in the western United States."
