        "text": "Research Introduction\n\nAs an analytical chemist, I focus primarily on application of specific types of chemical instrumentation to make measurements that help to solve interesting applied problems in chemistry. Some of these projects delve into other areas of chemistry including physical chemistry, forensic chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry and chemical education.\n\nResearch Projects\n\nMy student collaborators and I have been (and continue to be) involved in a number of different projects ranging over almost all areas of chemistry. A few specific ones are listed below.\n\nApplication of nanoparticle materials to development of new chemical sensors.\n\nDevelopment of mathematical models to describe interesting physical phenomena such as gelation, diffusion, and long-range electron transfer. This work has resulted from a fruitful collaboration with Dr. Jeb Kegerreis, who works with designing mathematical models to help us describe these phenomena. An interesting example is recent work that used theory to help elucidate the gelling properties of aerogel materials by examining how the optical properties of embedded nanoparticles change during the gelling process.\n\nDevelopment of new laboratory methods and experiments for chemical instrumentation, quantitative analysis, and physical chemistry courses. One example is another collaborative project with Dr. Kegerreis in which we developed a new physical chemistry laboratory experiment to help students better understand the Fourier Transform algorithm, which is utilized in many different areas of chemistry.\n\nResearch in forensic chemistry. Here, we look for useful applications of chemical instrumentation methods to better detect and evaluate illicit drugs in various matrices. A recent example was a project done in collaboration with Dr. Dan Predecki and the staff at the Cumberland County (PA) Crime Lab, which explored the use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) as a means of detecting and quantifying fluorine-containing synthetic cannabinoids.\n\nSelected Publications\n\n(SU student coauthors in bold)\n\n2015, Journal of Chemical Education, T.
