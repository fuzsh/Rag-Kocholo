        "text": "Elma Faye Howell was born July 18, 1938, in Sumner, Oklahoma to John William and Alma Margaret Howell in the family farmhouse. She passed from this earth on Sunday February 5th in her family's farmhouse east of Stillwater, Oklahoma. Faye and her twin sister, Ella May Howell (Dunford) were born within minutes of one another. She has an older sister, Delcie, and a younger sister, Linda Jane. Faye, as she was known in the Sumner and Perry communities, attended Sumner Schools all her twelve years. She graduated in the \"Class of 1956\" along with her future husband, Ray, and twin-sister, Ella May. She and Ralph Ray Richardson were married on August 29, 1958, at the Sumner Baptist Church in Sumner, Oklahoma.\n\nRay and Faye raised three boys and from 1968 on, resided on the banks of Black Bear Creek north of Perry, Oklahoma. She was involved as a bookkeeper for the farm and the many family businesses that the Richardson family had through the years. Faye was the quintessential farm wife and mother. She made sure her family always had a hot meal and attended all events of the boys through their school years. In 1987 she went to work at the Edmon Low Library at Oklahoma State University and worked there for 27 years before retiring. She loved the farm and everything associated with farm life. She and her twin sister, many times, were seen driving the wheat trucks back and forth from the grain elevators. She loved to draw by freehand, always grew some type of flowers, and enjoyed taking part in social activities. There were many family events shared together on the banks of that creek, at Ray and Faye's home through the years.\n\nRay preceded Faye in death in May of 1999. Faye married Ernest Gorath the day after Thanksgiving in 2012. They made their home southeast of Perry, Oklahoma. She continued the farm life and thoroughly enjoyed helping the Gorath's no matter what endeavors she encountered.\n\nIn the last few years of her life, she suffered from Alzheimer's and was moved to a facility at the Renaissance in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Some days before she passed away, her boys brought her out to the farm to let her have her last days and hours in the environment she so cherished, the farm. She was surrounded by family and loved ones up to the end of her life and passed away in a peaceful manner.\n\nFaye is survived by her husband Ernest Gorath of Perry, Oklahoma. She has three sons, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Sons include: William Ray (Billy) and Shonna Richardson of Stillwater, Oklahoma, Gary and Sandra Richardson of Perry, Oklahoma, and David and Shelly Richardson of Champaign, Illinois. Grandchildren include: Jennifer and Ben Stone, Gina and John Wealer, Heston and Amanda Richardson, Bailey and Kyle Parmley, Rachel, Abigail, Reese and Leslee Richardson. Great-grandchildren include: Elijah, Samantha and Emily Stone, Christian and Max Wealer, and Foster and Blaine Richardson.\n\nSisters include Delcie Seat of Edmond, Larry and Linda Fischer of Oklahoma City, and brother-in-law Richard Dunford of Perry. She is also survived by many nieces and nephews on each side of the family.\n\nFaye was preceded in death by her first husband, Ralph Ray Richardson, parents, John William and Alma Margaret Howell, and her twin-sister, Ella May Dunford.\n\nFuneral services will be held Wednesday, February 8th, 10:00 am at the First Baptist Church of Perry with Pastor Kim Hays officiating.
