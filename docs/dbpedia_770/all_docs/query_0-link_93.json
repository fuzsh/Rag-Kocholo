        "text": "An accomplished singer and regular on the Chicago music Scene. Angie can be seen regularly playing with many great Chicago big bands. Angie has been a lifelong student of voice and it shows! One half of the NFP 1-2 punch of female lead singers. Angie can sing the softest ballad to the heaviest rocker. Angie's favorite charities are - Holy Cross and Loyola Academy.\n\nBeth is the other half of our dynamic duo of singers. Beth has sang most of life and performs regularly with her church and various other groups. From Aretha Franklin to the Jackson 5, Beth is a powerhouse singer and a musical force within the band to be reckoned with!\n\nJohn co-founded the band back in 1997 following a Fourth of July party in Deerfield, Illinois with his wife Angie and two of its former members, Steve Schwartz and Gary Schaffel. John brings an unmistakable energy and enthusiasm to the group. John played in bands all of his life (Syntori, Idle Minds, The Celtniks) John took guitar lessons in 5th grade and improved his skills by learning guitar riffs listening to his favorite group, The Beatles. He fell in love with Angie after she winked at him from the audience at a Syntori gig in 1985 and their mutual love for each other and Music led them to form Not for Profit. John is fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with all of the charities for which NFP has played and the dedicated organizers who truly make a difference.\n\nJim plays lead and rhythm guitar along with lead and harmony vocals. Jim is a self-taught musician and has been playing off and on in bands since high school performing at everything from small parties to outdoor festivals. Jim also serves as the band's technical resource. He considers the time he has spent as a member of NfP as one of the most fulfilling experiences of his musical career and looks forward to continuing the journey for years to come. Jim supports all of the charitable groups the band works with but has a special affinity for cancer research and any organization that supports children's causes."
