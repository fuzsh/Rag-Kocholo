        "text": "We call John the “Mayor of Dillsburg”, not just because he is a lifelong resident, but because he actually IS the Mayor of Dillsburg! He did move to Virginia to attend Bridgewater College and then he attended the Aetna School of Insurance in Hartford. He has now been a part of the Gunn-Mowery team since 2008 and writes policies ranging from a small store to a large manufacturer. His 36 years of insurance experience, make him the perfect agent for all of your insurance needs.\n\nWhen John’s children were little, he was the Manager of Dillsburg Youth baseball and was an assistant coach and referee for Dillsburg Youth soccer. He is a former Master of Eureka Masonic Lodge in Mechanicsburg, he served as chairman on the Dillsburg Planning Commission and was the former President of the Dillsburg Borough Council. Currently, John is a member of the Dillsburg Lions Club and Chairman of the New Hope Ministries Scholarship Committee. To relax, John enjoys gardening, playing golf and traveling with his wife and high school sweetheart, Lisa."
