        "text": "Rusty rails, flashing lights, pouring rain. Can't see the end of that old crawling, creaking train. Just as soon as all the boxcars roll on by, See you later, Southern Central, gotta fly. The rain has stopped and up ahead it's misty blue. From the clouds come seven bending bands of hue. I'm so lonesome for my darling's winsome smile That I'm counting every inch of every mile. Well the days have turned to years, We've laughed a lot and shed our share of tears. And after all this time I can say our love's extraordinary and sublime. The day is done and the light is fading fast. I've lost track of all the cities that I've passed. In my mind I've drawn my bow and aimed my dart, Shot it cross the sky into my honey's heart. With the wink of the rising crescent moon And the stars to guide me, I'll be home real soon. Gonna dive into my baby's deep blue eyes, Not come out until we see the next sunrise. Well the days have turned to years, We've laughed a lot and shed our share of tears. And after all this time I can say our love's extraordinary and sublime.\n\nGood times, laughter, misery. Every passion on the street. Every time the door flew open, I was on my feet To join up with the young and bittersweet. Young hearts rising and sinking deep. Each one hiding, and hard to keep. Every time one heart gets broken, another skips a beat. So join the club of young and bittersweet. Good times, laughter, misery. One will wander, one will weep. Every tender heart could suffer in the summer heat. Welcome all you young and bitter, Welcome all you young and bitter, Welcome all you young and bittersweet."
