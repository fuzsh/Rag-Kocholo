        "text": "Comedians Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont have announced they are divorcing after nine years of marriage.\n\nIn a statement, the couple said they had \"jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways\".\n\nThey added: \"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being.\n\n\"We will be making no further comment.\"\n\nThe couple have starred together in the mockumentary Meet The Richardsons - in which they play \"exaggerated versions of themselves\" - since 2020.\n\nThe duo, who have a daughter, also starred together on Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\nBeaumont was nominated in 2023 for a BAFTA TV award in the best female performance in a comedy programme category for her part in Meet The Richardsons.\n\nHowever, in an interview last year, Beaumont said their on-screen personas for the show, in which they often bicker, were not a true reflection of their real-life relationship.\n\n\"It's been great, but I see comments on social media and people don't seem to realise it's not real,\" she told the Sunday Post.\n\n\"I don't henpeck - we wouldn't have lasted this long if I was as mean to him in real life.\"\n\nOn the concept for the show, she added: \"You don't want to see a smug couple in love, in a nice house, with a stable career and a lovely little child. Who wants to see that?\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Guardian last year, Richardson said: \"Every couple argues, but we have an end product for our arguments.\n\n\"We hone them, then put them on TV. And then it's like: 'Oh, perhaps we weren't arguing - perhaps we were just working on a routine.'\"\n\nBeaumont, a stand-up comic from Hull, whose routines often feature anecdotes about her home city, has appeared on panel shows such as Have I Got News For You.\n\nShe also appeared as a contestant on the 16th series of the comedy game show, Taskmaster, which was broadcast last year.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nRead more entertainment news from Sky News:\n\nEx-Little Mix star says she's never lived with long-term partner\n\nHarry and Meghan land two new Netflix shows\n\nRichardson, also a stand-up star, known for his dry humour, was previously a team captain on 8 Out Of 10 Cats.\n\nIn 2018, the Lancaster-born comedian launched the panel show Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, which ran on Dave for two series.\n\nHe previously co-hosted with Russell Howard on BBC Radio 6 Music."
