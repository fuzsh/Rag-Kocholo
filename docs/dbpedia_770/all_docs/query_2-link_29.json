        "text": "John Richardson begins his sixth season as cornerbacks coach for the Wyoming Cowboys in 2019 and his 11th year coaching at the college level. He originally joined the Cowboy coaching staff in 2014. In six of Richardson’s previous 10 seasons as a college coach, he has helped lead his teams to postseason play.\n\nWyoming’s 2018 defense was among the best in the nation. The Cowboys ranked No. 19 in the nation in total defense (allowing opponents only 326.2 yards per game), were No. 25 in the NCAA in rushing defense (129.5 yards per game), ranked No. 28 in scoring defense (giving up only 22.0 points per game) and were No. 32 in pass defense (196.7 yards per game). The UW defense also ranked No. 16 in the country in fewest first downs allowed to opponents (223). Richardson coached cornerback Tyler Hall, who earned Honorable Mention All-Conference honors as a junior in 2018.\n\nThe Cowboy defense enjoyed an exceptional season in 2017, and Richardson coached Second Team All-Mountain West cornerback Rico Gafford. Gafford went on to play in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, an All-Star game for college seniors leading up to the NFL Draft. Gafford signed a free-agent contract with the Tennessee Titans following the 2018 NFL Draft. He was picked up by the Oakland Raiders later in the 2018 season, and is listed as a wide receiver on the Raiders’ roster heading into the 2019 season.\n\nWyoming’s defense ranked No. 1 in the nation in takeaways in 2017, forcing 38 opponent turnovers. The Pokes ranked No. 9 in the country in scoring defense, allowing opponents only 17.5 points per game. UW ranked No. 1 in the NCAA in fumbles recovered (18), No. 2 in the nation in interceptions (20), No. 8 in defensive touchdowns scored (4 TDs), No. 13 in pass defense (174.9 passing yards allowed), and No. 23 in total defense (335.2 total yards allowed).\n\nAs a unit, the 2016 Cowboy defense scored five defensive touchdowns to rank No. 1 in the Mountain West and No. 3 in the nation. Wyoming recovered 12 opponent fumbles, ranking No. 1 in the MW and No. 15 in the NCAA. The Cowboys’ 15 interceptions were second best in the conference and 22nd nationally. UW’s 27 total forced turnovers ranked No. 2 in the Mountain West and No. 10 in the country. Of Wyoming’s 15 interceptions, five were made by Richardson’s cornerbacks.\n\nIn 2015, Richardson coached a Wyoming defense that ranked 26th in the nation in fewest passing yards allowed, giving up only 196.9 passing yards per game to opponents.\n\nPrior to coming to Wyoming, Richardson coached the North Dakota State cornerbacks in 2012 and ‘13. He was a member of the NDSU staff from 2009-13, spending the 2009 and ‘10 seasons as a student assistant before becoming a graduate assistant coach in 2011. During his time on the NDSU coaching staff, the Bison won three consecutive national titles in 2011, ‘12 and ‘13.\n\nFrom 2011 through 2013, Richardson helped NDSU to a 43-2 (.956) overall record and a 22-2 (.917) Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) mark on way to its three consecutive FCS national titles. The 2013 NDSU squad became the first undefeated (15-0) FCS National Champion since Marshall went 15-0 to win the 1996 title. That 15-0 record by the Bison also set a North Dakota State school record. NDSU extended its winning streak to 24 consecutive games with the 2013 FCS Championship. That tied both the FCS and NDSU records for consecutive victories. The University of Pennsylvania set the FCS record of 24 consecutive wins from 1992-95. Montana later tied the record from 2001-02. The NDSU record was originally set from 1964-66.\n\nAs a coach at North Dakota State in 2011, ‘12 and ‘13, Richardson helped the Bison rank No. 1 in the nation in scoring defense for three consecutive seasons, holding opponents to only 12.7 points per game in 2011, 11.5 points per game in 2012 and only 11.3 points per game in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 Bison defense also ranked: No. 3 in the FCS in total defense (255.9 yards per game); No. 2 in the nation in pass efficiency defense (97.59 rating); No. 3 in rushing defense (91.3 yards allowed per game); and No. 8 in passing yards allowed (164.6 yards per game).\n\nIn addition to leading the nation in scoring defense in 2012, NDSU: led the nation in total defense (234.5 yards allowed per game); was No. 1 in fewest first downs allowed (12.67 per game); ranked No. 2 in pass defense (140.6 yards allowed per game); and ranked No. 4 in rushing defense (93.9 yards allowed per game).\n\nIn 2012 and ‘13, Richardson coached Consensus First Team All-America cornerback Marcus Williams. Williams signed a free-agent contract with the Houston Texans following the 2014 NFL Draft. NDSU defensive back Bryan Shepherd also signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins following the 2014 NFL Draft.\n\nA starting cornerback, himself, at NDSU in 2007 and ‘08, Richardson made 85 tackles over his two-year career, with 57 solo tackles, 19 passes defended, two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. He began his college career in his home state of California at Mt. San Antonio Community College.\n\nOriginally from Compton, Calif., Richardson completed his bachelor’s degree in sports and recreation leadership in December 2010. He earned Missouri Valley Football Conference Honor Roll honors his senior year of 2008.\n\nHe and his wife, Sahfiya, have one son, John Michael, and one daughter, Simone Faith."
