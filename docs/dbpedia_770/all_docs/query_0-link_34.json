        "text": "The evening’s festivities begin at 6p.m., which is earlier this year, with musical entertainment on the main stage which will be located along Kirby Ave between First & Oak Streets. There will also be children’s activities (bounce house/inflatables). Parking is available in the State Farm Center SE Parking Lot and Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) parking lots, and around research park. New this year is a mobile Sensory Museum made possible by the City of Champaign and C-U Autism Network. To learn more about the Mobile Sensory Museum visit https://thatkidplace.com. or check out the video at https://youtu.be/tDaXaLXpOzg. Following the music, at around 9:10 p.m., there will be some announcements & presentations. After the announcements, there will be the singing of our National Anthem, an invocation, and then the retiring of our nations flag by a color guard. Immediately following, the always entertaining fireworks display. Drones are not permitted; the area is a no-fly zone for drones.\n\nThe Freedom Celebration Fireworks Location\n\nThe launch location will be lot E-14 west of the State Farm Center.\n\nOnce again this year, we will have a spectacular fireworks display! Pyrotecnico will treat us to a show they have carefully choreographed and synchronized with a custom soundtrack. They’ve put together some great shows for us in the past and this year is sure to be no different!\n\nThe fireworks will begin at dusk, approximately 9:15 PM. Should inclement weather affect the scheduled start time of the fireworks, in the interest of safety and public enjoyment, the Board of Directors and Committee will attempt to make a decision as to whether to delay the fireworks to a more advantageous time. Every attempt will be made to make this decision as early as possible to notify the public of any changes. Should a delay be required, all local media will be notified of the change.\n\nBe sure to come early and sit close to the stage. You will be entertained by this year’s live band and when the evening show is completed, this is the best way to hear the synchronized music track. Should you find yourself out of range of the stage, be sure to bring a radio and you can hear the fireworks music on NewsTalk1400 WDWS AM and Lite Rock 97.5 WHMS. We would like to remind you, that This is a NO DRONE ZONE. If caught using a drone could result in a fine.\n\nMusical Entertainment: SuperNova Champaign\n\nSupernova: Your Ultimate Party Band, Meet SuperNova, and electrifying all-female fronted cover pop band guaranteed to light up any event!
