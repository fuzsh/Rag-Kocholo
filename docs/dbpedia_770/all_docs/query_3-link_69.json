        "text": "One of the most individual, accomplished and hilarious stand-ups, Jon Richardson is best known as the team captain on Channel 4’s Cats Does Countdown, as well as the host of his critically acclaimed show Ultimate Worrier, which sees Jon address anything and everything that worries him.\n\nJon also starred in the sitcom Meet The Richardsons, written by Lucy Beaumont and Tim Reid, which received record breaking figures for DAVE across the series.\n\nConstantly in demand for TV and radio, Jon’s TV credits include co-hosting The One Show, as well as appearances on Have I Got News For You, Live At The Apollo, Would I Lie To You? and Taskmaster. He can also be heard on his new podcast Jon Richardson And The Futurenauts, where Jon takes Mark Stevenson and Ed Gillespie through his daily worries, from food to climate change.\n\nJon Richardson started out in comedy after dropping out of Hispanic Studies at Bristol University. After a year working as a chef, he realised that he wanted to do stand-up, so entered and won his heat of the BBC New Talent Comedy Search in 2003.\n\nHe reached the semi-finals of the Laughing Horse New Act of The Year competition in 2004. Quickly developing throughout 2004, Jon was one of six acts to reach the final of the J20 Last Laugh Comedy Search. Having impressed a sell-out crowd in Bristol he marked the end of his first year in comedy with a performance at the Criterion Theatre in London's West End.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared on the Comedy Zone at the Edinburgh Festival, completed a 60-date support tour with Alan Carr and made an appearance on Paramount's The Comedy Store. Jon then went on to be nominated for a prestigious If.Comedy award for Best Newcomer for his show Spatula Pad at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nThis was followed in 2008 with a successful Edinburgh run of his second solo show, Dogmatic and winning the award for Best Breakthrough Act at the 2008 Chortle Awards. In the November 2008 issue of Q Magazine, Jon was voted by its readers as one of the top five comedians of the year to look out for in 2009.\n\nOff the back of winning the 2008 Chortle Breakthrough Act Award, Jon Richardson embarked on his first UK solo tour in 2009, 'This Guy At Night'. The show was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards main prize. That year, he appeared on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind The Buzzcocks. He also appeared on Have I Got News For You, David Mitchell's The Bubble, Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow, The Comedy Store, Comedy Shuffle and Out To Lunch.\n\nHe co-hosted a Sunday morning radio show on BBC 6 Music with fellow comedian Russell Howard, and continued to present the show himself after Howard left, until 2010.\n\nJon Richardson suffers from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), a fact that was joked about many times when he presented alongside Russell on BBC 6 Music radio station, and a topic he uses to garner a lot of his stand-up comedy material.\n\nIn 2010, Jon presented a thirty-minute long BBC Three programme about compulsions and weird habits, entitled 'Different Like Me'."
