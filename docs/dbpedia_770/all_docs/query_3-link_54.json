        "text": "The stand-up comedian couple Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont have announced that they are divorcing after nine years of marriage.\n\nThe pair, who have starred in their at-home mockumentary Meet the Richardsons since 2020, described their split as “amicable” in a joint statement.\n\nThey said: “After nine years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated.\n\n“We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n“As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment.”\n\nThe couple have one seven-year-old daughter, Elsie Louise, who was born in 2016.\n\nThey began dating in 2013 after meeting through fellow comedian Roisin Conaty, before they married in April 2015.\n\nIn their comedy show, they play “exaggerated versions of themselves” as they deliver a window into their home and work lives. It returned to UKTV’s Dave on April 8 for its fifth series.\n\nBeaumont, who is an actress as well as a stand-up comedian, was nominated for a Bafta TV award for the show in 2023 for the female performance in a comedy programme category.\n\n‘Fighting is not real’\n\nShe explained last year that viewers of the show do not “seem to realise that their fighting is not real”.\n\n“I don’t henpeck – we wouldn’t have lasted this long if I was as mean to him in real life. You don’t want to see a smug couple in love, in a nice house, with a stable career and a lovely little child. Who wants to see that?”\n\nShe added: “The world we’ve got around us is slightly bizarre but I think people still feel like they recognise themselves in it, which is good.”\n\nThe comedian also described Meet the Richardsons as “an excuse for us to channel tensions into comedy” but that the laughter helps the audience “realise it’s all nonsense”.\n\nDuring her career, the 40-year-old has featured on a number of comedy panel shows, including Have I Got News for You, Would I Lie to You? and The Last Leg.\n\nRichardson, 41, is also known for his appearances on panel shows and was previously a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats.\n\nIn 2018 he launched the panel show Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier, which ran on Dave for two series, and he has previously co-hosted with Russell Howard on BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\nThe couple also entertained viewers together when they starred on Celebrity Gogglebox."
