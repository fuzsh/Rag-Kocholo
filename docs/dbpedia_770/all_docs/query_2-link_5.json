        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nJohn Richardson\n\nTitle\n\nCornerbacks Coach\n\nJohn Richardson, who joined the Arizona coaching staff ahead of the 2023 season, has followed new UW head coach Jedd Fisch to Seattle, where he'll serve as the Huskies' cornerbacks coach in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, he helped lead a unit that included three cornerbacks that earned honorable mention: Ephesians Prysock (who has since transferred to UW), Tacario Davis and Treydan Stukes. Those three helped lead the Wildcats to its best season in years, as the Wildcats finished 10-3 and beat Oklahoma in the Valero Alamo Bowl.\n\nBefore moving to Tucson, Richardson had spent the previous three years at Washington State, as cornerbacks coach in 2020, and then adding the roles of assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn his first season in Pullman, the WSU defense produced four players that earned some level of All-Pac-12, including cornerback Jaylen Watson, who earned honorable mention and helped the Cougars lead the league with eight forced fumbles in a shortened 2020 season.\n\nRichardson arrived at Washington State after spending the previous six seasons as the cornerbacks coach at Wyoming. Richardson helped the 2019 Cowboys finish sixth in the country in red zone defense, No. 11 in the country in rush defense (107.1) and scoring defense (17.8), No. 40 in tackles-for-loss (83) and No. 43 in total defense. Senior cornerback Tyler Hall capped his career earning All-Mountain West Conference honorable mention for the second straight season.\n\nIn 2018, Wyoming’s defense was among the best in the nation, finishing the season No. 19 in total defense (326.2), No. 25 in rushing defense (129.5), No. 28 in scoring defense (22.0) and No. 32 in pass defense (196.7). Hall earned All-MWC Honorable Mention as a junior in 2018.\n\nThe 2017 Cowboy defense become one of the best groups in the country as they led the country in takeaways (38), ranked ninth in scoring defense (17.5), were first in fumbles recovered (18), second in interceptions (20), eighth in defensive touchdowns scored (4), No. 13 in pass defense (174.9) and No. 23 in total defense (335.2). Richardson coached second-team All-Mountain West cornerback Rico Gafford who went on to play in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl and signed a free-agent contract with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAs a unit, the 2016 Cowboy defense ranked first in the country with five defensive touchdowns, No. 10 with 25 takeaways, No. 15 with 12 fumble recoveries, No. 22 with 15 interceptions including five from Richardson’s cornerbacks. In 2015, Richardson coached a Wyoming defense that ranked No. 26 in the nation in fewest passing yards allowed (196.9).\n\nPrior to going to Wyoming, Richardson coached the North Dakota State cornerbacks in 2012-13. He was a member of the NDSU staff from 2009-13, spending the 2009-10 seasons as a student assistant before becoming a graduate assistant coach in 2011. During his time on the NDSU coaching staff, the Bison won three consecutive national titles in 2011-13.\n\nFrom 2011-13, Richardson helped NDSU to a 43-2 (.956) overall record and a 22-2 (.917) Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) mark on way to its three consecutive FCS national titles. The 2013 NDSU squad became the first undefeated (15-0) FCS National Champion since Marshall went 15-0 to win the 1996 title. NDSU extended its winning streak to 24 consecutive games with the 2013 FCS Championship, tying both the FCS and NDSU records for consecutive victories.\n\nAs a coach at North Dakota State (2011-13), Richardson helped the Bison lead the nation in scoring defense for three consecutive seasons, holding opponents to only 12.7 points per game in 2011, 11.5 in 2012, and 11.3 in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 Bison defense also ranked third in the FCS in total defense (255.9); second in the nation in pass efficiency defense (97.5), third in rushing defense (91.3) and eighth in passing yards allowed (164.6). In addition to leading the nation in scoring defense in 2012, NDSU led the country in total defense (234.5), allowed the fewest first downs (12.6), ranked second in pass defense (140.6) and fourth in rushing defense (93.9).\n\nIn 2012-13, Richardson coached consensus first-team All-America cornerback Marcus Williams. Williams signed a free-agent contract with the Houston Texans following the 2014 NFL Draft and defensive back Bryan Shepherd also signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins following in 2014.\n\nRichardson was a two-year starter at cornerback for NDSU (2007-08), where he recorded 85 tackles over his two-year career, along with 19 pass breakups, two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. He began his college career in his home state of California at Mt. San Antonio College.\n\nOriginally from Compton, Calif., Richardson earned Missouri Valley Football Conference Honor Roll honors his senior year of 2008 and completed his bachelor’s degree in sports and recreation leadership in 2010 from North Dakota State.\n\nHe and his wife, Sahfiya, have one son, John Michael, and one daughter, Simone Faith.\n\nCOACHING HISTORY\n\nWashington\n\n2024-present: Cornerbacks\n\nArizona\n\n2023: Cornerbacks\n\nWashington State\n\n2021-22: Assistant Head Coach, Recruiting Coordinator & Cornerbacks\n\n2020: Cornerbacks\n\nWyoming\n\n2014-19: Cornerbacks\n\nNorth Dakota State\n\n2012-13: Cornerbacks\n\n2011: Graduate Assistant\n\n2009-10: Student Assistant"
