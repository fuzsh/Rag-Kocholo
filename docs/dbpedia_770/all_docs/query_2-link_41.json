        "text": "Lucy Beaumont has opened up on the breakdown of her marriage to Jon Richardson. The comedy world was left stunned as they announced they are getting a divorce after nine years wed.\n\nThe couple, who are parents to their seven year old daughter Elsie, took to Instagram with a heartfelt joint statement on Friday: \"After 9 years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated. We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n\"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment.\"\n\nBefore becoming a power couple, comedians Lucy and Jon were already big names in the comedy circuit but were set up by none other than GameFace and After Life's Roisin Conaty back in 2013. They tied the knot two years later in April 2015 and welcomed their bundle of joy, Elsie, into the world shortly after.\n\nFans have loved watching them play hilariously heightened versions of themselves in the mockumentary Meet The Richardsons since 2020, and they've even given us laughs on Celebrity Gogglebox together. In a candid interview with The Sunday Post, Lucy addressed the public's perception of her relationship with Jon on Meet The Richardsons: \"It's been great, but I see comments on social media and people don't seem to realise it's not real.\n\n\"I don't henpeck, we wouldn't have lasted this long if I was as mean to him in real life. You don't want to see a smug couple in love, in a nice house, with a stable career and a lovely little child. Who wants to see that?\n\n\"I wasn't doing it if we were going to be like that. We'll show the other side where we're just at each other constantly. It's a more truthful portrayal. The world we've got around us is slightly bizarre, but I think people still feel like they recognise themselves in it, which is good.\"\n\nLucy's tongue-in-cheek comments hinting at marital issues emerged during an appearance on Channel 4's Eight Out Of Ten Cats Does Countdown. Host Jimmy Carr introduced Lucy and Jon as contestants, prompting Lucy to reply with a quip: \"I don't see this for life.\"\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter as Carr and Lucy played off their perceived relationship dynamic. Adding to the comments, Lucy said: \"Isn't it a song - just passing through? Is it? ... You meet in your life old souls, new souls... A***holes.\"\n\nShe then spoke about her and Jon stating that they \"had a lovely life together\", but left us guessing by stating: \"Who knows what will happen in the future.\""
