        "text": "Sir John Richardson (1924–2019), son of Sir Wodehouse Richardson, was born in London. He studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, then began writing for the New Statesman, Burlington Magazine, and other British journals. In 1950 he and the modern art collector and scholar Douglas Cooper moved to a château in the south of France, where Picasso was a frequent visitor. In 1980 Richardson began writing A Life of Picasso. The first volume was published in 1991, the second in 1996, the third in 2007, and the fourth in 2021. He was appointed Slade Professor of Art at Oxford in 1995 and knighted by H.M. the Queen in 2012. Photo: Brian Gilmartin"
