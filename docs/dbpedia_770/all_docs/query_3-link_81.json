        "text": "Jon Richardson has been spotted for the first time since announcing his shock split from wife and fellow comedian Lucy Beaumont.\n\nThe pair stunned fans by revealing they had separated after nine years of marriage in a joint statement.\n\nDays after breaking the sad news, Jon put on a brave face as he emerged at a family event for children's TV cartoon Bluey, alongside a number of other famous stars.\n\nJon, who shares a daughter with estranged wife Lucy, joined the celebs at a screening of a special extended episode of Australian show Bluey at the Odeon Luxe in London's Leicester Square.\n\nDressed in head to toe black, Jon posed for pictures ahead of the premiere. His sighting came days after he and wife Lucy released a joint statement insisting their decision to separate was made \"jointly and amicably\".\n\nThey wrote: \"After nine years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated,\" they each posted on Instagram. We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n\"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment.\"\n\nJon and Lucy were introduced through a fellow comedian Roisin Conaty and went on to combine their personal and professional lives by starring together in Meet The Richardsons, where they play \"exaggerated versions of themselves\" in a \"fictional view of their life together\". The show returned for its fifth series to Dave's UKTV on 8 April.\n\nAfter announcing his split from Lucy to the world, Jon put on a brave face as he attended the global premiere of the special extended Bluey episode, ‘The Sign’, which landed today on Disney+, Disney Channel and Disney Junior across the world.\n\nHe was joined byCall The Midwife star Helen George and JLS star turned farmer, JB Gill. They were joined by EastEnders ' Matt Di Angelo , former Paralympian and TV broadcaster Ade Adepitan, reality TV star and model Bianca Gascoigne and her mum Sheryl Gascoigne.\n\nFollowing news of his marital breakdown, a clip of Jon's wife Lucy joking about divorcing him resurfaced on social media.\n\nLucy made quips about issues in their romance during an appearance on Channel 4 ’s Eight Out Of Ten Cats Does Countdown in 2022. Introducing Lucy as one of the show contestants, host Jimmy Carr remarked: \"Lucy and Jon are married. So I know Lucy, everyone watching at home is dying to know... What made you decide to settle?\" And Lucy then quipped: \"I don't see this for life.\"\n\nContinuing, Lucy said: “Isn't it a song - just passing through? Is it? … You meet in your life old souls, new souls... A***holes.\" She went on to declare that she and Jon “had a lovely life together” - but then foreshadowed: “Who knows what will happen in the future.\" Jone even then joked at the time: “Are you breaking up now?\"\n\nLucy and Jon first started dating in 2013 and went on to tie-the-knot two years later. Jon had proudly announced their engagement back in 2014, declaring: \"It's odd when we met. You obviously get that instant spark of romance and all that, but then also, with me and Lucy, we were very comfortable together very early... I am very lucky. If I'd have read that I met someone and - within a couple of dates - we were going out, and then we went on holiday together, and then she moved in a few months later, I would have scoffed at it.\"\n\nHe added at the time: \"Fundamentally I've come back feeling that me and Lucy will probably get married, which - in terms of the view I've held all my life, never mind over the past week - is f**king enormous. It's almost like 'U-turn' isn't enough.\""
