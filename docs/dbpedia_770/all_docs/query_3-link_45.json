        "text": "JON Richardson and Lucy Beaumont have revealed that they've SPLIT after nine years of marriage.\n\nThe pair, who share one daughter together, tied the knot in April 2015.\n\nA statement shared by PA news agency today said: \"After 9 years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated. We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n\"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being.\n\n\"We will be making no further comment.\"\n\nFunnyman Jon, 41, and Lucy, 40, started dating in 2013 after they met each other through friend Roisin Conaty.\n\nThe pair said 'I do' two years later.\n\nIn 2016 they welcomed their daughter Elsie Louise into the world.\n\nThe couple have starred in a number of TV shows over the years.\n\nThey've appeared in Dave's mockumentary style programme Meet The Richardsons since 2016.\n\nLast year they presented Channel 4's Jon & Lucy's Odd Couples.\n\nJust last month comedian Lucy revealed the 'downside' to working with her husband in a chat with OK!.\n\n\"It’s a great working environment because it feels like a big group of friends.\n\n\"It’s a shame that you can’t see the crew off camera because most of them have worked on the show from the beginning. It’s like a holiday for them.\"\n\nShe also hinted that current series of Meet The Richardsons will be the last.\n\nLucy added: \"This will probably be the last one, and we’re going out on a high.\"\n\nIn 2023 Lucy opened up about what it was like working with her partner.\n\nShe previously said: \"'We like working together and enjoy Meet The Richardsons and we really wanted to make something that people could relate to.\n\n\"Meet The Richardsons is basically an excuse for us to channel tensions into comedy and you see that in the studio, someone might start saying something thinking they’re going to land a blow but as soon as us and the audience start laughing at them, they realise it’s all nonsense.\"\n\nBut last year Lucy joked about a divorce from Jon Richardson a year before their news.\n\nTalking on Eight Out of Ten Cats Does Countdown, she joked: \"I don't see this for life.\""
