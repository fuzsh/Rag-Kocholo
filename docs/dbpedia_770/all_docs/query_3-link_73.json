        "text": "Jon Richardson has been spotted for the first time since his shock split from wife and fellow comedian Lucy Beaumont. The couple, who were married for nine years, recently announced their separation in a joint statement.\n\nJust days after sharing the heartbreaking news, Jon was seen at a family event for children's TV cartoon Bluey, mingling with other celebrity guests. Jon, who shares a daughter with Lucy, attended a special screening of an extended episode of the Australian show Bluey at the Odeon Luxe in London's Leicester Square.\n\nDressed all in black, Jon posed for photos before the premiere. This appearance comes just days after he and Lucy released a joint statement saying their decision to separate was made \"jointly and amicably\".

They added: \"We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\n\n\"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment.\", reports OK! Jon Richardson and his wife Lucy Beaumont, who have previously opened up about their marital spats, were originally matched by their comedian friend Roisin Conaty.\n\nThey've been charming audiences on-screen in Meet The Richardsons. The show, which casts the couple as \"exaggerated versions of themselves\" in a \"fictional view of their life together\", has just kicked off its fifth series on Dave's UKTV on 8 April.

The event was a glittering affair, with celebrities such as Call The Midwife's Helen George, JLS's JB Gill turned farmer, EastEnders' Matt Di Angelo, Paralympian and broadcaster Ade Adepitan, and reality TV star Bianca Gascoigne alongside her mother Sheryl Gascoigne gracing the red carpet.\n\nIn the midst of the whirlwind surrounding his private life, a playful snippet of Jon's partner Lucy cracking jokes about divorce has emerged once more. During an appearance on Channel 4's Eight Out Of Ten Cats Does Countdown last year, Lucy elicited laughter from the audience when host Jimmy Carr introduced her with: \"Lucy and Jon are married. So I know Lucy, everyone watching at home is dying to know... What made you decide to settle? \"\n\nTo which Lucy wittily replied: \"I don't see this for life.\" Lucy went on to add: \"Isn't it a song - just passing through? Is it? ... You meet in your life old souls, new souls... A***holes.\"\n\nShe left fans speculating over a possible reunion with Jon as she admitted: \"We had a lovely life together\" and added: \"Who knows what will happen in the future.\" Jon even said: \"Are you breaking up now? \".\n\nThe couple started their romance back in 2013 and were married two years later, with Jon excitedly announcing their engagement in 2014: \"It's odd when we met. You obviously get that instant spark of romance and all that, but then also, with me and Lucy, we were very comfortable together very early... I am very lucky. If I'd have read that I met someone and - within a couple of dates - we were going out, and then we went on holiday together, and then she moved in a few months later, I would have scoffed at it.\"\n\nHe further added: \"Fundamentally I've come back feeling that me and Lucy will probably get married, which - in terms of the view I've held all my life, never mind over the past week - is f**king enormous. It's almost like 'U-turn' isn't enough.\""
