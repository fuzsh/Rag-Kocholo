        "text": "Comedian and actress Lucy Beaumont has opened up about her divorce from Jon Richardson after stepping back on stage at London's Bloomsbury Theatre. The 40 year old Task Master and Gogglebox star, who was performing on Saturday, 21 April, as part of her first stand-up tour titled 'The Trouble and Strife', didn't shy away from discussing the recent headlines about her split from her husband of nine years.\n\nCommenting on the irony of her solo show's name, which is Cockney rhyming slang for 'wife', Lucy joked with the audience, \"I didn't have time to change the show\". She also went on to deliver more details about the timeline of their split, revealing why they made the joint public statement when they did.\n\nOn Friday, 12 April, the couple - who share daughter Elsie, seven, - released a statement confirming their separation, which read: \"\"After 9 years of marriage, we would like to announce that we have separated. We have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go our separate ways.\"\n\nAddressing the so-called elephant in the room at her gig on Saturday, Lucy revealed that they had decided to part ways \"last year\", but only made it public recently because a publication was about to break the story after it \"found out\" the private news.\n\nAccording to Metro's review, which said Lucy \"thrived on stage\", Lucy reassured fans that she and Jon were still on friendly terms, saying: \"We're friends. It's the best for everybody.\"\n\nIn their initial split statement, Jon and Lucy, who was crowned Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014, said their daughter was their only priority. \"As our only priority is managing this difficult transition for our daughter, we would ask that our privacy is respected at this sensitive time to protect her well-being. We will be making no further comment\", they said.\n\nThe couple was originally set up by fellow comedian After Life star Roisin Conaty and tied the knot in April 2015, welcoming a daughter a year later, although she has remained out of the limelight, reports the Mirror.\n\nTheir split of course raising questions about the future of their hit show, Meet The Richardsons, which airs on Dave. Since its inception in 2020, Jon and Lucy played \"exaggerated versions of themselves\" and the fifth series hit UKTV Play on April 8, 2024.\n\nWith speculation rising that the show could end following their news, fans wait with bated breath to see if the duo will continue to work together."
