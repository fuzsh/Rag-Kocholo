MusicalMastery.org\n\nSteve Pettey, Cinde Pettey\n\nOboe\n\nThe oboists of the Dallas Winds were a thing long before the Dallas Winds was born. Cut throat competitors (maybe just a little) then later high school sweethearts, they first met in Alabama All State Band when Steve was in 8th grade and Cinde was in 9th. They collaborated regularly in the Huntsville Youth Orchestra, Huntsville Symphony Orchestra, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville Wind Ensemble throughout their high school careers. Steve bought a ring his senior year of high school and the engagement was on. As music majors at the University of Southern Mississippi, Cinde became interested in computer science (a pretty new thing at that time), and as a presidential scholar, she had no trouble completing both degrees in 5 years. Steve’s degree program was jazz, though not with the oboe per se. He filled his schedule playing lead alto sax in the top jazz band, jazz tenor sax in the second, principal oboe in the orchestra and wind ensemble, and piccolo in the concert band. Rumor has it that he did also practice on occasion. Upon graduation, they looked at a map and randomly chose Dallas as a good place for both computer science and music. This worked out very well. Steve met saxophonist Don Fabian on a dance band gig, who mentioned that there was a weekly rehearsal band being formed at SMU and they needed oboes. Steve showed up to the second rehearsal and with the caliber of the ensemble and Howard Dunn on the podium, thought that he should stick with it. Cinde joined in later that summer. Their daughter, the first baby of the Dallas Winds, was born just three weeks prior to the first concert and was in the audience! 35 years later: Though Cinde has retired from her telecom engineering job with Ericsson after 27 years, she is still playing and teaching lots of young oboists. Steve has also been the principal oboist of the Plano Symphony for 35 years along with being a core member of the Dallas Summer Musicals orchestra since 1991, and taught many thousands of oboe lessons, and made over one bajillion oboe reeds. Steve and Cinde have three grown children (Sarah, Gordon and Earl), two cats (Poly and Frank), and are the proud grandparents of Evelyn, Eileen and Keldon Stanford (all Sarah’s). Steve loves cooking and woodworking, and Cinde loves gardening and sewing. They both love travel and sailing!
