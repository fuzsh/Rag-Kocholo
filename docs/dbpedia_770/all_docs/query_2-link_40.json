        "text": "I was very saddened to hear that Sir John Richardson died today at the age of 95. I just received an advance copy of his new book John Richardson: At Home last week and I was hoping to meet him at a signing or attend a speaking engagement. His loss is sad because his level of taste, as well as those of Lee Radziwill and Marella Agnelli, will never be replicated and there is most certainly not anyone who can compete with his scholarly achievements. His legacy as the biographer of artist Pablo Picasso will probably never be replicated by any other biographer mostly because he was actually friends with his subject. He was also friends with Peggy Guggenheim, Anthony Blunt, Andy Warhol, Lucien Freud, and other, many of whom created works of art of him. The only comfort in his passing is that he lived a wonderful long and interesting life.\n\nThe Art Newspaper sat down with Richardson shortly before he died to discuss his new book and the homes it features. It’s definitely worth reading until John Richardson: At Home is published on March 26, 2019 by Rizzoli.\n\n“I loathe the decorator look. I think you’ve got to express yourself and in whatever form that takes it should reflect one’s on taste. Period rooms tend to bore me. The more historically correct that they are, the more museum-y they look. I like to mix things up so that they galvanize each other to life.”\n\nThe photos here are from Richardson’s home in Connecticut that was featured in T Magazine in 2014 and was sold in 2018. You can watch a video interview of Richardson here.\n\nJohn Richardson: At Home will be released March 26, 2019 from Rizzoli.\n\nIn the library, a pair of Piranesi prints on doors flanking a 19th-century mirror in the manner of William Kent and a table covered in a print by Lisa Corti from John Derian.\n\nA carved wooden bird found at a local junk shop and an 18th-century vase on the Louis XVI campaign desk where Richardson worked in the office library on the Connecticut property."
