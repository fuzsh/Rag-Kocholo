        "text": "Their arrival in the Ubben Basketball Complex signified the hope for the future.\n\nFreshmen D.J. Richardson, Brandon Paul, Tyler Griffey and Joseph Bertrand formed a recruiting class ranked No. 14 by Rivals, and they allowed Illini-heads the chance to think big down the road. That's OK. Richardson was already doing the same thing.\n\n\"We're just freshmen,'' said the former Peoria Central High School star who played last season at Findlay College Prep in suburban Las Vegas. \"By our junior years, we'll be some monsters.''\n\nThey've already been productive this season, even though the freshman class endured the swoon normally known as the freshman wall. But as Illinois moves closer to crunch time in February and prepares to host Indiana on Saturday, the Illini freshmen are starting to heat up.\n\nEven if the problem isn't solely an issue with the Illini youngsters, a team so reliant on underclassmen battled inconsistency. Any hope of reaching the NCAA Tournament is based on big play from the freshmen, particularly Richardson and Paul, after they endured a mid-season slump.\n\n\"Once they fight through that, they see the light at the end of the tunnel,'' Illinois coach Bruce Weber said. \"They get a feel for the game. We're much better with those guys playing well. We need (Paul) to play well. He adds offensive skill and ability to create that some of the other guys don't have.''\n\nRichardson suffered through an 0-for-15 shooting slump during a three-game span, then averaged 16.3 points over the past three games while shooting 52 percent from the floor and 50 percent from the 3-point line. The prep school experience allowed Richardson to make a seamless transition to college, where he's apparently enjoying himself if a trip to the coach's radio show told Weber anything.\n\n\"D.J. came along, hung out and talked to people,'' Weber said. \"He was trying to get a date. At least he's having fun enjoying college. Sometimes guys are trying to be too cool. Just enjoy it.''\n\nAfter setting a school record by scoring 22 points in his freshman debut, Paul's 12- and 10-point performances in the past two games were the first time he reached double figures in league play. Paul scored 20 points combined in his first five Big Ten games.\n\n\"It was a little tough,'' he said. \"I'm still a freshman. I have a lot to learn. I have to stay on being consistent and moving forward. I had a little rough patch. I talked to coaches, players and my family. I just try not to think too much on the court.''\n\nSaid Weber: \"He had to accept what we were telling him, let the game come to him. I need him on the court. He does so many good things.''\n\nWeber was so determined to play Griffey at Penn State, he started him in place of Mike Davis. Griffey already provided an eye-opener with 12 points and seven rebounds in a loss at Michigan State.\n\n\"I needed to play him,'' Weber said. \"If I start him, it guarantees him some time. I held Demetri (McCamey) accountable. If I hold him accountable, I have to hold Mike Davis accountable. Griffey gets stuck. He deserves to play. He works harder than anyone.''\n\nThere's been no division between the upperclassmen and the rookies.\n\n\"You look at these guys,'' said junior Bill Cole. \"They're not the typical freshmen. They're not afraid to take big shots. That's the difference between these freshmen and a lot of other freshmen. They relish the opportunity and take the big shots.''\n\nIndiana was idle mid-week after a 58-43 loss to Iowa on Sunday.\n\nNOTES: Waukegan senior Jereme Richmond, a longtime Illini commitment who signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Illinois, was suspended for a game against Maine South on Friday along with two other teammates after being involved in a fight outside the high school, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. According to the newspaper, the Waukegan Police Department said video footage shows that 12 people were actively involved in the fight and about 50 people were gathered around watching the fight. None of the three players were arrested or face criminal charges. … Illinois' game at Purdue was set for Feb. 20 with a 3 p.m. tipoff. Broadcast was scheduled for ESPN.\n\nJohn Supinie can be reached at Johnsupinie@aol.com.\n\nILLINOIS VS. INDIANA\n\nIllinois (13-8, 5-3) vs. Indiana (9-10, 3-4)\n\n1 p.m., Assembly Hall (16,618), Champaign (ESPN2, Illini Sports Network)\n\nILLINOIS (13-8, 5-3) ppg rpg\n\nF Mike Davis Jr. 6-9 10.9 9.2\n\nF Bill Cole Jr. 6-9 3.8 3.1\n\nC Mike Tisdale Jr. 7-1 11.8 6.0\n\nG Demetri McCamey Jr. 6-3 14.9 3.1\n\nG D.J. Richardson Fr. 6-3 11.2 2.8\n\nINDIANA (9-10, 3-4) ppg rpg\n\nF Tom Pritchard So. 6-9 4.6 4.1\n\nF Christian Watford Fr. 6-8 12.7 6.0\n\nG Jeremiah Rivers Jr. 6-5 6.4 5.2\n\nG Verdell Jones III So. 6-5 13.5 3.9\n\nG Jordan Hulls Fr. 6-1 5.4 2.1\n\nNoteworthy: Indiana leads the series 82-81 after Illinois won the last three meetings between the two teams. Bruce Weber is 9-4 against Indiana during his tenure as Illini coach. The Illini rallied from a 15-point deficit in the second half in a 66-60 win at Indiana on Jan. 9. … McCamey needs nine points to become the 42 player in school history to reach the 1,000-point mark. He's been on the floor for 93.3 percent of the minutes in the last six games. … Jones is averaging 16.3 points in Big Ten games. Indiana sophomore Matt Roth, who broke a bone in his foot in late November, is out of the walking boot and limited to shooting drills. He's expected to take a medical redshirt.\n\nKey for Illini: Get off to another fast start, no matter who is ini the starting lineup.\n\nKey for Hoosiers: Stay out of foul trouble if they plan to play tough inside, like they did in the first meeting earlier this month.\n\nKey quote: \"I would have never thought Billy (Cole) would be a captain going into the season. He emerged and did what's asked. He played hard. He earned the respect not only of the coaches but also the players.'' -- Illinois coach Bruce Weber.\n\nPrediction: Illinois 74, Indiana 60"
