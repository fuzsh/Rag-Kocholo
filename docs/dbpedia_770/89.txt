John Richardson, MB, BS, (1915-2002) was a British family practice physician who spent many years caring for and researching ME patients. He was a founding Member of the Newcastle Research Group, a member of the Melvin Ramsay Society, and the Environmental Medicine Association. He served as the Chairman of the 1989 Cambridge Symposium on the Clinical and Scientific Basis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.[1] and the book that followed, The Clinical and Scientific Basis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, edited by Byron Hyde, was dedicated to Dr. Richardson.[2]

Dr Richardson organized the first World Symposium on M.E. at Cambridge University in 1991 in collaboration with Dr. Byron Hyde and the Newcastle Research Group in the UK.[3]

In 2001, Dr Richardson wrote a book describing the relationship between exposure to enteroviruses or toxins such as organophosphates and onset of myalgic encephalomyelitis and other organ pathologies.[1]

Richardson's research was involved in demonstrating an association between ME, enterovirus infection, and hypothalamic dysfunction,[4] brainstem hypoperfusion,[5] and brain pathology at autopsy.[6]

Just prior to his death in 2002, he produced a physician's guide[7] on diagnosing and treating ME patients.
