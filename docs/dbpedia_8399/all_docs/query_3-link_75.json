        "text": "Global Electricity Review 2024\n\nRenewables generated a record 30% of global electricity in 2023, driven by growth in solar and wind. With record construction of solar and wind in 2023, a new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 was likely the pivot point, marking peak emissions in the power sector.\n\nSubmission: Boggabri Coal Mine Modification\n\nSubmission to Australia’s Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water on the proposed modification of Boggabri coal mine and the potential for it to have a significant, under evaluated impact on fugitive emissions increases.\n\nAustralia\n\nG20\n\nCoal Mine Methane\n\nquotation\n\n\"SFOC’s coal power team is deeply appreciative of our ongoing collaboration with Ember. Ember’s analysis and insights on international coal and climate issues have helped us place the Korean issues in a larger global context and added value to our work on multiple occasions. Ember’s team supported us with insights and contacts that really helped push our campaign along.\"\n\nSeukyoung Lee\n\nCoal Transition Lead, Solutions For Our Climate\n\nquotation\n\n\"By releasing the 'Asia Data Transparency Report', Ember has not only provided us with crucial insights but also ignited a much-needed debate in Pakistan. Their data transparency report has provided us an opportunity to initiate a conversation with government departments and relevant entities to consider making their data publicly available and accessible. This newfound pressure has catalyzed extensive efforts to develop public dashboards, and our team is using it as motivation to actively engage in bridging the data gaps highlighted by Ember's report.\"\n\nMuhammad Mustafa Amjad\n\nProgram Manager, Renewables First\n\nquotation\n\n\"Ember’s 'The UK's coal to clean journey' sets a best practice example for countries like South Korea that are aiming to accelerate power sector transition in the next decade. Ember’s research and presentation provided the Korean audience, including its key decision-makers, with lessons learned for implementing an efficient renewable-oriented energy system.\"\n\nEsther Kye Lee\n\nHead of Communications, NEXT Group\n\nquotation\n\n\"Ember is one of our go-to organisations for when we need to understand technicalities of energy markets or the policy context. I’m always grateful for their flexibility, from prompt responses to queries through to giving time to help us dig into tricky issues.\"\n\nSimon Cran-McGreehin\n\nHead of Analysis, Energy Climate and Intelligence Unit (ECIU)"
