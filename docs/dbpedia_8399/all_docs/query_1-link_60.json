        "text": "Trump-aligned national security experts told Politico last week that, if elected, Trump is considering negotiating a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Russia getting some territory and NATO committing to not expanding membership to Ukraine or Georgia.\n\nSources told Politico that Trump is unlikely to quit NATO outright, but members worry that, if elected, he could downplay the US role, block aid for Ukraine, or try to strike an unpopular peace deal with Russia.\n\nUkraine and the majority of its allies don't want a peace deal that gives Russia territory. They say it's not right, as Russia invaded a sovereign country, and that Russia can't be trusted in such deals.\n\nUkraine has taken steps toward joining NATO but has not yet been given a clear road map. Estonia has been a strong backer of its membership, saying that it would help protect it from Russia.\n\nIn his comments, Karis said that \"if Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty are not respected, it will lead to new and larger wars in the future. Russia and other aggressors will only be emboldened to attack again.\"\n\n\"NATO has successfully overcome previous hesitations regarding military aid to Ukraine,\" he added. \"No limits should be set on further assistance.\"\n\nBeing a member of NATO would offer Ukraine strong protection due to the alliance's mutual protection policy, which means that if one member is attacked it can call on other members, like the US and UK, for help.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMany NATO states have called for Ukraine to be granted membership of the alliance.\n\nBut any single member, such as a Trump-led US, could block it, as new membership needs consensus support.\n\nTrump has long been critical of NATO, and threatened to withdraw from it during his presidency.\n\nTrump long complained that many NATO members did not spend the recommended 2% of their GDP on defense.\n\n(Members' spending has soared since — but experts told Business Insider that Trump's protests were not the reason.)\n\nThe Associated Press reported this week that European leaders are trying to \"Trump-proof\" NATO and its Ukraine support, in case he is reelected.\n\nMember states like Estonia are also preparing in case Russia attacks them next.\n\n\"Russia will be more hostile in the next decade than it was in the previous one,\" Karis said. \"NATO must be prepared for this. NATO has good collective defense plans, which need to be backed by necessary forces and weapons systems.\""
