        "text": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves (born December 26, 1953, Stockholm, Sweden) is a politician who served as president of Estonia (2006–16).\n\nIlves was born to Estonian refugees and raised in the United States. He completed a B.A. in psychology at New York City’s Columbia University in 1976. Two years later he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with an M.A. in psychology. After holding several jobs in the United States and Canada, Ilves moved to Munich in 1984 to work as an analyst and researcher for Radio Free Europe, eventually becoming head of the radio’s Estonian desk. Also in 1984 he made his first visit to Estonia. From 1993 to 1996 he served as Estonia’s ambassador to the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In 1996 Ilves moved to Estonia and began serving as the country’s minister of foreign affairs, a post he held until 1998 and again from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIlves’s political career advanced when he was elected to the Riigikogu, the Estonian national legislature, in 2002. He was elected to the European Parliament in 2004 and began negotiations that resulted in Estonia’s admittance to the European Union in 2004. He ran for the presidency of Estonia as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party and was elected in September 2006."
