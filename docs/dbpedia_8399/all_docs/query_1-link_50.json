        "text": "Ms Kaja Kallas has become Republic of Estonia’s first female Prime Minister on 26 January 2020. The newly formed 15-member cabinet under Kalla’s premiership includes a record seven female ministers (46.7% of the cabinet) with Hon. Ms Eva-Maria Liimets securing the title of the first female Foreign Minister of Estonia.\n\nWith the new government in place, Estonia has also become the only country in the world where both the president and the prime minister are women. (Rt. Hon. Kersti Kaljulaid is the current President of Estonia.)\n\nKaja Kallas is the leader of the Reform Party and comes from a political family as her father Siim Kallas was part of Estonian independence movement in 1987, co-founded the Reform Party and also served as the country’s Prime Minister (2002-2003) and as a European Commissioner (2004-2014).\n\nEstonia will continue to prosper and develop in the leadership of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and her strong cabinet members with the bilateral relationship between Nepal and Estonia poised to grow even further."
