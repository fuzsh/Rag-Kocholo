        "text": "Born 29 March 1929, Tallinn\n\nDied 14 March 2006, Tallinn\n\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia\n\n06.10.1992-08.10.2001\n\nÂ\n\nLennart Meri was born into the family of Estonian diplomat and latter-day translator of Shakespeare Georg Meri in Tallinn on 29 March 1929. He would leave Estonia at a young age with his family, changing schools nine times and languages four times. The school years he recalled most fondly were those he spent at the LycÃ©e Janson de Sailly in Paris.\n\nThe Meri family was back in Tallinn when Soviet forces occupied Estonia. Along with tens of thousands of their countrymen and neighbours from Latvia and Lithuania, they were deported to Siberia in 1941. Heads of families were separated from their loved ones and placed in concentration camps, from which few emerged alive. Lennart Meriâs first job, at the age of 12, was as a woodcutter. He also served time peeling potatoes and floating felled timber downriver.\n\nThe Meri family survived their Siberian ordeal and made it back to Estonia, where Lennart Meri graduated cum laude from the University of Tartu with a degree in history in 1953. However, the Soviet authorities would not allow him to work as an historian. Instead, he found work as a playwright in Estoniaâs oldest theatre, the Vanemuine, then as a producer of radio dramas for the countryâs national broadcaster.\n\nLennart Meri wrote his first book, which met with great success, about a trip he took in 1958 to the Tian Shan mountains of Central Asia and to the ancient Islamic centres of the Karakum desert. He had been forced to make a living from writing since his university days, when the Soviet authorities arrested his father for the third time. He and his younger brother, who had dropped out of school to become a taxi driver, managed to support their mother, and the future president would go on to complete his studies. But it was only through the writing of his first book that he found his calling. He would spend a quarter of a century travelling alone or leading expeditions he had organised to the most inaccessible regions of the Soviet Union, where he was drawn to the cultures of the indigenous peoples, the history of the exploration and colonisation of Siberia and the ever-deepening economic and ecological conflict between the needs of locals and the planned economy of Moscow. The books he wrote and the films he produced about his travels even made it beyond the Iron Curtain and have been translated into a dozen languages. One of them, the film Linnutee tuuled or âThe Winds of the Milky Wayâ â a co-production with Finland and Hungary that was banned in the Soviet Union â even won a silver medal at the New York Film Festival. Lennart Meriâs films and texts have been used as teaching material in schools in Finland, where he was named an honorary doctor of the University of Helsinki in 1986. Many years prior to that, in 1963, he had been approved as a member of the Estonian Writersâ Union, and he was inducted as an honorary member of the equivalent Finnish union in the 1980s.\n\nBetween travels, Lennart Meri translated the works of Remarque, Graham Greene, Vercors, Boulle and Solzhenitsyn. His books, films and translations made a significant contribution to the preservation of Estonian identity during a time of totalitarian Russification. His most famous work remains the book HÃµbevalge or âSilverwhiteâ, a wide-ranging reconstruction of the history of Estonia and the Baltic Sea, which depicted Estonians as active agents of an open world in Northern Europe.\n\nHaving waited for more than 20 years to be given permission by the Soviet authorities to travel beyond the Iron Curtain, Lennart Meri made the most of the opportunities that eventually opened up to him in Finland, using them as a platform to remind the free world of Estoniaâs existence. He forged trusted relationships with politicians, journalists and Estonians who had fled the Soviet occupation of their homeland. He was the first Estonian to protest outside of the country against the Soviet authoritiesâ intention to mine phosphorite in Estonia, which would have rendered a third of the country uninhabitable.\n\nThe environmental movement in Estonia soon grew into the Singing Revolution, in which the countryâs intelligentsia played the leading role. Lennart Meriâs speech âDo Estonians have hopes?â placed the problems of the nationâs existence front and centre and was widely reported on outside of the country. His transition from writer, film-maker and translator to politician was a smooth one and heralded the political sea change to come. In 1988 he founded the Estonian Institute, a non-government organisation, to foster cultural ties with the West and get young people looking abroad. Cultural representations established in Copenhagen, Stockholm, London, Bonn, Paris and Helsinki in the shadow of the Estonian Institute served as de facto deputations before becoming official embassies when the democratic West restored diplomatic relations with the Republic of Estonia in August 1991.\n\nNeither Estonia nor the West considered the Soviet or Nazi occupations to have interrupted the continuity of the Republic of Estonia or to have revoked its international rights and obligations. This is why Estonia is not classed as a ânew democracyâ, since the Republic of Estonia had been an active member of the League of Nations as far back as 1921. Lennart Meri signed acts on the restoration of diplomatic relations as Estoniaâs new Minister of Foreign Affairs. He had been appointed to the position on 12 April 1990 by Peopleâs Front leader Edgar Savisaar following the countryâs first free elections. Prior to that he and a number of co-authors had managed to publish a collection of documents entitled 1940. Eestis. Dokumente ja materjale (âEstonia 1940: Documents and Materialsâ, 1989), which sought, unsuccessfully, to convince Soviet parliament members that the basis of the occupation and Sovietisation of Estonia had been a criminal pact between Hitler and Stalin to divide Europe up between their totalitarian regimes.\n\nInstalled as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lennart Meriâs first task was to establish a working ministry. To this end he had to recruit young Estonians eager and able to learn, put in place a reliable channel for communication with the outside world and represent Estonia at important international conferences. This he did on many occasions, attending CSCE conferences in Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Berlin, Moscow and Helsinki and the founding conference of the Council of the Baltic Sea States in Copenhagen, meeting repeatedly with European and American foreign ministers and heads of state and speaking as the first guest from Eastern Europe at NATO headquarters in Brussels.\n\nFollowing a short stint as the Estonian ambassador to Finland (23 April-10 October 1992), Lennart Meri was elected President of the Republic of Estonia. He was sworn in on 6 October 1992. He was elected for a second term as head of state on 20 September 1996.\n\nDuring his periods as a writer and politician, Lennart Meri was named an honorary member of the Kalevala Society and a correspondent member of the Finnish Literature Society, a member of the boards of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and the International Advisory Council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, and a member of the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism. He was also a member of the Estonian Writersâ Union, the Estonian Filmmakers Association and the Estonian PEN Club, the patron of the University of Tartu Foundation, a winner of the Coudenhove-Kalergi European prize and Liberal International Prize for Freedom and the recipient of orders from a variety of countries, and in 1998 he was awarded the title of European of the Year. He was elected to the post of academic at the Estonian Academy of Sciences in 2001 and represented the Estonian government at the Convention on the Future of the European Union in 2002-2003.\n\nLennart Meri married twice. His second wife, Helle Meri (born 1949), worked as an actor at Tallinn Drama Theatre until 1992. His first wife, Regina Meri, emigrated to Canada in 1987. Lennart Meri had three children â two sons, Mart (born 1959) and Kristjan (born 1966), and a daughter, Tuule (born 1985) â and four grandchildren.\n\nLennart Meri is buried in the Forest Cemetery in Tallinn.\n\nRECOGNITION & DECORATIONS\n\n1977 | Silver medal at the New York Film Festival\n\n1986 | Honorary doctor of the University of Helsinki (Finland)\n\n1996 | Coudenhove-Kalergi European prize\n\n1996 | Freedom award of the EastWest Institute (New York)\n\n1997 | Annual prize of the Crans Montana Forum\n\n1998 | Silver medal of the Jagiellonian University of KrakÃ³w (Poland)\n\n1998 | European of the Year (La Vie newspaper, France)\n\n1999 | Liberal International Prize for Freedom\n\n1999 | Honorary doctor of the University of Lapland (Finland)\n\n1999 | Highest honour of the German Federation of Expellees\n\n2000 | Honorary doctor of St. Olaf College (USA)\n\n2000 | Honorary doctor of the University of Turku (Finland)\n\n2000 | Small Countries Award of the Liechtenstein Institute\n\n2001 | Max Schmidheiny Freedom Prize of the University of St. Gallen (Switzerland)\n\nÂ\n\nMEMBERSHIP OF UNIONS & ASSOCIATIONS\n\n1963 | Member of the Estonian Writersâ Union\n\n1966 | Member of the Estonian Filmmakers Association\n\n1975 | Honorary member of the Kalevala Society (Finland)\n\n1976 | Correspondent member of the Finnish Literature Society\n\n1977 | Correspondent member of the Finno-Ugric Society\n\n1982 | Honorary member of the Union of Finnish Writers\n\n1989 | Member of the Estonian PEN Club\n\n1993 | Member of the management board of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts\n\n1995 | Member of the management board of the International Advisory Council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\n\n1997 | Member of the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism\n\n1999 | Honorary member of the Home Neighbourhood Union of Finland\n\nÂ\n\nORDERS\n\n1993 | Order of the Star of Jordan, Collar\n\n1994 | Order of the Elephant of Denmark, Star and Collar\n\n1995 | Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose with Chain (Finland)\n\n1995 | Royal Order of the Seraphim with Chain (Sweden)\n\n1995 | Order of the Aztec Eagle (Mexico)\n\n1996 | Order of the Three Stars Commander Grand Cross with Chain (Latvia)\n\n1997 | Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic, Grand Cross\n\n1997 | Golden Order of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia\n\n1997 | Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, Grand Cross\n\n1997 | Order of Vytautas the Great of the Republic of Lithuania\n\n1998 | Order of the White Eagle of the Republic of Poland\n\n1998 | Order of the Falcon of the Republic of Iceland\n\n1998 | Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Saint Olav\n\n1999 | Order of the Redeemer of the Republic of Greece, Grand Cross\n\n2000 | Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, Grand Cross, Special Grade\n\n2001 | Companion of Honour of the National Order of Merit (Malta)\n\n2001 | Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour"
