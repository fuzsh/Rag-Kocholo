        "text": "Moscow has placed Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on Russia's wanted list, the first time a foreign leader has been put on the Interior Ministry's list, for \"destroying monuments to Soviet soldiers\" as relations between the Kremlin and the West continue to show signs of deteriorating.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Moscow confirmed the move on February 13, though it did not say when Kallas, Estonian Secretary of State Taimar Peterkop, Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys, and about 60 of the 100 members of the previous Latvian parliament were on the list.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Kallas was put on the wanted list for the \"desecration of historical memory.\"\n\n\"The Kremlin now hopes this move will help to silence me and others – but it won't,\" Kallas said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"I will continue my strong support to Ukraine. I will continue to stand for increasing Europe's defense,\" she said, adding that Russia's move was \"nothing surprising.\"\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and many other former Soviet republics and ex-Warsaw pact members have demolished Soviet-era monuments.\n\nThe three Baltic states were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and occupied by Nazi Germany before falling back under Moscow's rule until regaining independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nAll three are now members of the European Union and NATO, and strongly support Ukraine in its battle to repel invading Russian forces.\n\nKallas became Estonia's prime minister in 2021 and soon afterward pledged to dismantle as many as 400 monuments seen as an unwanted legacy from the Soviet era.\n\nNews of Moscow's move to put Kallas and other officials from EU countries on its wanted list comes almost a year after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, alleging responsibility for the war crime of unlawfully deporting and transferring children from Ukraine during the war.\n\nThe Russian Interior Ministry's list also includes ICC President Piotr Hofmanski.\n\nWith reporting by AP and Reuters\n\nA group of Russian antiwar activists held a gathering in the Montenegrin city of Budva on August 18 in memory of opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and to express their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nOne of the organizers of the gathering, a man who identified himself only as Artem, said the demonstrators also wanted to show support for Russian political prisoners.\n\n\"We are here to pay respect to Navalny for everything he has done for our country and to say that we support Ukraine,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\nAuthorities allowed the gathering on the main square in Budva with the condition that there be no banners or musical performances, the organizers said. Some of those gathered ignored the condition and carried pictures of Navalny and banners saying \"Russia without Putin, stop the war.\"\n\nThey also showed photos of 20 Russian political prisoners who they say were killed or died in prisons.\n\nNavalny, the most prominent among them, had been convicted in trials that he and his associates judged to be politically motivated before he died on February 16 in a prison in Russia’s Arctic under suspicious circumstances. Many Russians living in Montenegro turned out then to pay their respects to him.\n\nThose gathered on August 18 said there are still around 1,600 political prisoners in Russia, quoting data from the civil sector.\n\nA protest participant who gave his name only as Vasily said he and the others wanted to assure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"We do not forget you and we are proud of you, [proud] of people who have the courage to publicly say what they think,\" Vasily told RFE/RL.\n\nVasily also said he believes that the only chance for change in his country is Putin's departure from the political scene.\n\nAnother participant, Russian dissident and artist Marat Gueljman, said that a change of government is the only hope for Russians in the country.\n\nGueljman said three years ago, Putin's power in Russia was \"incredibly strong” and no one could have guessed then that the army of another country could be on Russian territory and that thousands of people would be in prison for opposing Putin.\n\n\"So, with this war, Putin made a mistake. No one can destroy the system better than the people who built it. Putin will destroy that system,\" Gueljman said.\n\nTop officials of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan marked 105 years of of the country's independence on August 18 by demanding mutual respect from the international community.\n\nAfghanistan gained its independence in August 1919 after the signing of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty, which ended British control over the country’s foreign affairs.\n\nAfghanistan currently remains unrecognized internationally, largely because of the restrictions the Taliban-led government has placed on women since it returned to power in August 2021.\n\nThe anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty was marked at a meeting of top Taliban leaders in Kabul broadcast live by the Taliban-controlled National Radio and Television.\n\nMullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban's acting defense minister, told the meeting that the government wants strong relations with the world based on mutual respect but will never give in to pressure.\n\nHe also said the Taliban, which seized power after the U.S.-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile, will never allow the Islamic State and other destructive groups to create chaos in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Whether they are Daesh (Islamic State) or other rebels, they should hear…that we have not surrendered to anyone's power at any cost. By any name, we have established the Islamic system in this land. We will defend it till death and the last century.\"\n\nThe international community has previously expressed concern about the presence of the extremist Islamic State group in Afghanistan, while the Taliban has said it is the only group capable of ruling and establishing security in the country.\n\nHamid Karzai, who served as the first elected president of Afghanistan from 2004 to 2014, marked the anniversary of the signing of the treaty by calling on the Taliban to allow girls and women to attend school and university.\n\n“I call on the caretaker Islamic government to open the doors of schools and universities in the country as soon as possible so that girls equipped with the jewels of knowledge can play their part in the development of the country alongside their brothers,” Karzai said on X. “Education and national unity are the forces that will keep the country strong.”\n\nSince returning to power in August 2021, the Taliban has banned girls and women from studying beyond primary school.\n\nThe United Nations said on August 15 that at least 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education and this has almost wiped out two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan, leaving the future of an entire generation in jeopardy.\n\nHungary has responded to a letter sent by Nordic and Baltic countries expressing concern about Budapest’s decision to make it easier for Russian and Belarusian citizens to enter Hungary.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on August 18 that the letter sent to EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson showed an alarming level of “disregard for fact.”\n\n\"We regret to see that our colleagues from Nordic and Baltic countries continue to pursue their campaign of lies directed against Hungary,” Szijjarto said on Facebook.\n\nThe letter, signed by ministers of eight Nordic and Baltic countries and sent to Johansson on August 15, expressed concern that Hungary’s decision “may constitute a serious security risk to all Member States.”\n\nAll eight countries -- Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden -- are in Europe’s Schengen zone in which travelers can cross internal borders without having to show their passports or other documents.\n\nEstonian Foreign Minister Marhus Tsahkna posted the letter on X on August 16, saying that easing entry for Russians and Belarusians “is not justified when Russia continues its war in #Ukraine & is intensifying hybrid actions against EU.”\n\nThe letter said this includes “sabotage, acts of violence, provocations at borders and instrumentalization of migrants.” It said all eight countries concluded at the NATO summit in July that “these actions constitute a threat to our security.”\n\nBut Szijjarto disagreed, saying in his response on August 18 that including Russian and Belarusian citizens in Hungary’s National Card program does not pose any security risk to the Schengen area because the Belarusian and Russian citizens who arrive in Hungary must still undergo thorough checks to enter and stay in the country.\n\n“Any claims to the contrary are outright lies from our Nordic and Baltic colleagues who have been blinded by their adherence to the pro-war camp,\" Szijjarto said.\n\nBudapest published details of its National Card program last month after it took over the European Union's rotating presidency.\n\nThe program is a new fast-track visa system for citizens of eight countries, including Russia and Belarus, to enter Hungary. Budapest has said many of those who enter would be employed in the construction of a nuclear power plant that is contracted to Russia’s Rosatom.\n\nJohansson voiced concern about the decision earlier this month in a letter addressed to Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter asking Budapest for clarifications. She said Russia is a security threat for the European Union and pointed to the need of \"more, not less vigilance.\"\n\nRussian citizens do not face a ban on entering the EU and the Schengen Area, which also includes non-EU members Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, if they possess a valid visa and have no ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine’s air force says a second bridge in Russia’s Kursk region has been struck as Kyiv tries to weaken Russia’s combat operations in the area.\n\n“Minus one more bridge,” Air Force Commander Mykola Oleschuk wrote on Telegram on August 18. “The air force continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precise air strikes, which significantly affect the course of hostilities.”\n\nMoscow has not yet commented on the strike, which came nearly two weeks into Ukraine's surprise counteroffensive into Russia’s Kursk region, altering the dynamics of the two-and-a-half-year war and causing 120,000 people to flee.\n\nRussian military bloggers previously posted an image of the first bridge that was hit. It spans the Seym River near the village of Zvannoye in Kursk.\n\nAccording to Russian security officials, the destruction of that bridge cut off part of the Glushkov district, making it more difficult for the civilian evacuation out of the region.\n\nOn August 16, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine of using American long-range rockets to destroy a key bridge in the Glushkov district in the Kursk region, killing in the process \"volunteers\" helping to evacuate civilians.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:01 0:00\n\nAnalysts say taking out bridges over the Seym is crucial for Ukraine to ensure a secure flank to its offensive in Kursk by making it difficult for Moscow to supply its troops south of the river.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian operation in Kursk \"is still inflicting losses on the Russian Army and the Russian state, their defense industry, and their economy.\"\n\nHe said in his evening address on August 18 that his top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, told him that the situation at the front is showing \"good results\" in all directions.\n\nIn addition, he said there were \"good and necessary results in the destruction of Russian equipment near Toretsk,\" a town in the Donetsk region north of the regional capital.\n\nUkraine's main task now is \"to destroy as much Russian potential as possible and conduct maximum counterattack work.\" This \"also applies to the creation of a \"buffer zone\" thanks to the operation in the Kursk region, he added.\n\nAleksei Kulemzin, the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Donetsk, said a man and a woman were killed by Ukrainian shelling on August 18, according to Reuters. The claim could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.\n\nFighting elsewhere in the Donetsk region prompted Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and minister of reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories, to urge citizens of Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, and Selydove to evacuate.\n\n\"The situation remains difficult in the Pokrovsk area. Therefore, I appeal to the residents of settlements in the immediate vicinity of the front line...please evacuate. If you are not involved in the defense of settlements, then you should leave for safer regions,\" Vereshchuk said.\n\nIn Russia, debris from a drone downed in the Rostov region caused a fire at a diesel fuel storage facility in an industrial warehouse in the early hours of August 18, regional Governor Vasily Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

At least two fires have been recorded on the territory of the facility, the General Staff said.\n\nIn Ukraine, authorities in the Kharkiv region said a 52-year-old woman was injured in Kupyansk as a result of shelling by the Russian Army. Private homes were also damaged, the local prosecutor-general's office said.\n\nIn addition, a nearby village was shelled, damaging equipment belonging to a utility company. There were no casualties, the press service of the prosecutor-general's office said.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the Russian Army used rocket-propelled grenades in the attack.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses had intercepted five Ukrainian drones overnight over Belgorod, Kursk, and Rostov. Kyiv does not usually comment on reports of drone attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, said on August 18 that Russia had launched its third ballistic missile against the Ukrainian capital this month.\n\nHe added that Russian forces had then launched a cruise missile toward Kyiv.\n\nPopko said on Telegram that the Russians had likely used a KN-23-type North Korean ballistic missile to target the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe head of Kyiv's regional military administration, Ruslan Kravchenko, said two private houses were destroyed in the attack and dozens of other homes were damaged. There were no injuries reported, he said.\n\nUkraine's air force said earlier that it had downed eight drones and five missiles in total over the Kyiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions.\n\nWith reporting by dpa and Reuters\n\nAs mass protests in Belgrade against the development of a lithium mine rattle Serbia's leadership, officials are looking to blame the West.\n\nWashington, for its part, said the protests are just an example of democracy at work, shrugging off accusations it somehow has a hand in it the events.\n\n\"Peaceful protest and the right of citizens to demonstrate and speak freely is an important part of democracy,\" the State Department said in a response to an RFE/RL request for comment to accusations in Belgrade and Moscow.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic earlier this week accused demonstrators who opposed the multibillion-dollar lithium-mining project of being part of Western-backed \"hybrid\" warfare against his government, without giving any evidence.\n\nMoscow has accused the West of being behind the protests, while Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin thanked the Russian security agencies for warning his government about alleged \"preparations for mass unrest and an attempted coup.\"\n\nSerbia and Russia maintain close ties even as Belgrade seeks to join the European Union. The United States last year designated Vulin for sanctions for his ties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn a response to RFE/RL on August 17, the State Department said any assertion that the United States supports anti-government protests in Serbia \"is false.\"\n\n\"We are not surprised that Russia, in contrast, has instrumentalized protests to pursue its own agenda in Serbia, as it does around the globe,\" the State Department told RFE/RL on August 17.\n\nThe protesters demand a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's $2.4 billion lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nIn 2022, the Serbian government rejected the project in the wake of massive public protests amid concerns over its impact on the environment.\n\nBut it reinstated the plan on July 16 this year, days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nJadar has the capacity to supply 90 percent of Europe's current lithium needs and make Rio Tinto one of the world's leading lithium producers. Serbia is seeking to process the lithium locally and use it for the production of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nSuch large-scale mining projects often trigger protests in Western countries by local residents who fear the ecological devastation outweighs any potential economic gains. In the United States, citizens have sought to stop lithium projects in Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nSerbia is no different. Citizens fear the Jadar mine will pollute water and land resources in a country that already suffers from significant environmental degradation, a legacy of communist rule.\n\nLithium is typically mined through a process called brine mining, which involves extracting lithium from underground saltwater reserves, opening up the possibility of water contamination.\n\nThe Serbian lithium project could play a critical role in Western EV supply chains as Washington and Brussels seek to reduce dependency on rival China.\n\nThe United States and Europe have put policies in place to significantly increase the number of EVs on the road in the coming years as they seek to reach emission targets.\n\nAs a result, global lithium demand is expected to surge. China is currently the third-largest producer of lithium after Australia and Chile but the largest lithium refiner and producer of batteries for EVs, giving it signficant influence over markets.\n\nThe project would also be a boon to Western investors in Rio Tinto.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian forces are continuing to make progress in Russia's Kursk region after launching a major cross-border offensive 11 days ago that caught the Kremlin's military leadership off-guard and altered the dynamics of the 30-month war.\n\nFollowing an update from Ukraine's top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, Zelenskiy said in a post on Telegram on August 17 that Ukraine had been \"strengthening\" its positions in the Kursk region and stabilizing more territory under its control.\n\nUkrainian forces have penetrated deep into Russian territory after sweeping over the border in a surprise attack on August 6, capturing dozens of settlements.\n\nThe surprise incursion, coming as Russia continues to advance in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, seemingly strengthens Kyiv's hand in any future peace negotiations.\n\nWATCH: Ukrainian troops near the city of Toretsk say they believe Russia will have to redirect resources back to its own territory, but they have yet to see a letup in the fighting.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:49 0:00\n\nRussia claims to have annexed four Ukrainian regions -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya -- in addition to the Crimean Peninsula. If Ukraine can continue to hold parts of Kursk and neighboring Russian regions, it could potentially seek to swap it for the allegedly annexed regions, experts say.\n\nThe Kremlin has been embarrassed by the incursion, the first foreign occupation of its territory since World War II, and has accused NATO of helping Ukraine plan the attack, an allegation Washington denies.\n\nThe Kremlin, which frames the war as one between Russia and the West, has often hinted at escalation in what analysts say is an attempt to intimidate Washington so it refrains from supplying Ukraine with powerful weapons, such as long-range precision rockets and F-16s.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces continued their surprising advance in Kursk, Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine of using U.S.-made long-range rockets to destroy a key bridge in the Glushkov district in the Kursk region, killing in the process \"volunteers\" helping to evacuate civilians.\n\n\"For the first time, the Kursk region was hit by Western-made rocket launchers, probably American HIMARS,\" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said late on August 16.\n\nAccording to Russian security officials, the destruction of the bridge cut off part of the district, making it more difficult for civilian evacuation out of the region. Ukraine’s incursion has so far led to the evacuation of more than 120,000 civilians, according to Russian authorities.\n\nBy comparison, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced as many as 7 million Ukrainians to flee their homes. Russia has also killed thousands of civilians through drone and missile strikes on nonmilitary sites like homes, shopping centers, and railroad stations.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nKyiv claims to have taken control of 82 settlements over an area of 1,150 square kilometers since its surprise cross-border incursion on August 6.\n\nThe United States so far deems the incursion a protective move that justifies the use of U.S. weaponry, according to officials in Washington.\n\nNonetheless, Ukraine still faces Western restrictions on the use of some weapon systems inside Russia, including long-range missiles like the U.S.-made ATACMS. The Biden administration views the use of ATAMCS inside Russia as escalatory. There has been no indication from Western capitals that Ukraine has violated those rules during the course of the war.\n\nThe Times of London reported on August 17 that the United States is also blocking Britain from supplying its powerful, long-range Storm Shadow cruise missile. The U.K. sent a corresponding request to the United States more than a month ago, but has not yet received a response, the paper reported.\n\nIn a post later in the day, Zelenskiy expressed regret that the U.K. was restricting the use of Storm Shadows, saying long-range strike capability \"is really a matter of principle for us.\" The Storm Shadow, which has a payload of 400 kilograms, can devastate targets more than 300 kilometers away. Kyiv wants to use them to strike Russian air bases that house fighter jets pounding Ukrainian troops and cities.\n\n\"It is crucial that our partners remove barriers that hinder us from weakening Russian positions in the way this war demands. Long-range capabilities are the answer to the most critical strategic questions of this war,\" he wrote.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on August 16 urged Washington and London to allow Ukraine to attack Russian territory with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nIn a separate setback for Ukraine, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on August 17 that Germany has halted any new financial and military aid to Ukraine due to budgetary constraints.\n\nIn an August 5 letter to Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and seen by the news outlet, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said new aid allocations can only be made if financing is guaranteed.\n\n\"Starting today, Olaf Scholz and the coalition government under his leadership are freezing financial and thus military support for Ukraine,\" Ingo Gadehens, a member of the opposition Christian Democrats, told the news outlet.\n\nAid that had previously been promised will be delivered. Going forward, funds for Ukraine will be allocated from the profits generated by Russia's frozen assets, the outlet reported.\n\nEnergy Facilities Targeted\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukraine on August 17 of planning to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant and blame it on Moscow.\n\nRussia would respond harshly in the event of such \"provocation,\" Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian-installed officials at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine said on August 17 that a Ukrainian drone dropped an explosive charge on a road outside the plant, endangering staff who use the road.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have repeatedly accused each other of sabotaging the operation of the plant, which was occupied by Russia soon after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nLast week, Zelenskiy accused Russia of causing a fire at a cooling tower of the plant, while Russian officials said Kyiv was deliberately trying to destroy the plant and sow \"nuclear terror.\"\n\nNon-nuclear energy facilities have been targeted by both sides during the war, with Russia damaging half of Ukraine power facilities and Ukraine damaging more than a dozen Russian refineries, some more than once.\n\nKyiv and Moscow were to hold \"indirect talks\" next week in Doha on halting attacks on energy infrastructure but it has been postponed due to the Kursk incursion, The Washington Post reported on August 17, citing people familiar with the developments.\n\nRussia Plans More Evacuations\n\nUkrainian forces on August 17 damaged another bridge over the Seim River, limiting the ability of Russia to supply its troops south of the river. Another road bridge and a pontoon bridge remain but are coming under Ukrainian fire.\n\nUkraine is seeking to capture the town of Korenevo, south of the river, to strengthen its position in Kursk.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine announced the capture of Sudzha, a town with a population of 5,000, the biggest to fall so far in the incursion. Korenevo is slightly bigger in size.\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine will establish a command office in Sudzha to coordinate aid and military affairs.\n\nRussian forces have so far struggled to mount an effective response to the incursion, which is widely seen as a major morale boost for Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces have already captured hundreds of Russian troops, who Kyiv plans to use in a prisoner swap, Zelenskiy said on August 17.\n\n\"By this morning, our country's 'exchange fund' has been replenished. I thank all our soldiers and commanders who are capturing Russian military personnel, thereby advancing the release of our warriors and civilians held by Russia,\" he posted on social media.\n\nAuthorities in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine and Kursk have said they will evacuate five villages starting next week.\n\n\"From August 19, we are closing access to five settlements, removing residents and helping them bring out their property,\" regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov announced on Telegram.\n\nWATCH: Skepticism prevailed in the Ukrainian border city of Sumy when locals were asked about government plans to accept refugees from Russia's Kursk region.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:16 0:00\n\nRussian Strike, Ukraine Hack\n\nAs it sought to beat back Ukrainian forces in Kursk, Russia continued its bombardment of Ukraine.\n\nIn the northeastern Sumy region, at least two people were wounded in a Russian missile strike early on August 17, according to emergency services.\n\nThe missile hit a parking lot near a high-rise apartment building, setting at least 10 vehicles on fire and shattering the windows and damaging the façade of the nearby buildings, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOvernight, Ukraine's air defenses shot down all 14 Russian drones launched in an overnight strike, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement early on August 17.\n\nThe Shahed drones were downed over six Ukrainian regions in the south and center of the country, including areas near the capital, Kyiv, according to the statement posted on Telegram.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate said its cyber-specialists together with the hacker group VO Team had successfully infiltrated an Internet provider to an enterprise belonging to Russia's nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn an August 17 statement, the directorate said they hacked Chelyabinsk Internet provider Vega, whose clients include the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics, disabling 1,173 switches and 10 servers.\n\n\"The information on the Vega servers has been destroyed. A number of strategic enterprises of the city were left without Internet and communication services for almost a week,\" the intelligence service reported.\n\nRFE/RL could not confirm the information.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Ukrainian and Russian services\n\nExiled Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she is pleased that 30 people have been pardoned in Belarus and released from jail but noted that the move barely makes a dent in the number of people imprisoned in the country \"in politically motivated cases.\"\n\n\"I am very happy about the release of a number of political prisoners,\" Tsikhanouskaya said on August 16 on Telegram. \"I am glad that families will finally be reunited -- and those who have not seen each other for weeks, months, and years will finally have the opportunity to hug and talk.\"\n\nBut she said the reality is that detentions in Belarus continue and the number of political prisoners is growing.\n\n\"More than 1,400 people are still behind bars in politically motivated cases. And there are those who will decide not to agree to the terms, and those who will never be offered them,\" she said. \"Therefore, we will continue to be their voices and do everything in our power to ensure that each of these people is released as soon as possible.\"\n\nA statement posted on the website of authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka's office earlier on August 16 said he signed a decree pardoning 14 women and 16 men who had been convicted of \"crimes of a protest nature.\" Some of those pardoned have serious illnesses or are retirement age, the statement said.\n\nThe Vyasna human rights center earlier this week said it had received evidence that political prisoners throughout the country were being forced to write petitions for clemency to Lukashenka.\n\nVyasna reported last month that representatives of the Prosecutor-General's Office went to colony No. 1 in Novopolotsk every day and force political prisoners to write petitions for clemency.\n\nIn addition to her message on Telegram, Tsikhanouskaya posted a statement on her website saying that she talks about political prisoners in Belarus at every international meeting she attends.\n\n\"You know that this issue is particularly personal for me. The regime has kept my husband, Syarhey Tsikhanouski, out of public sight for 527 days. Our children ask about their father every day, and all I can do is comfort them with the hope that he will soon come back home,\" she said.\n\nTsikhanouskaya, 41, is a former teacher who ran for president in Belarus in 2020 after her husband was barred by the regime from doing so and imprisoned.\n\nWhile the official results handed Lukashenka victory and his sixth consecutive term in office, the opposition and many Western governments and organizations say the poll was rigged and that Tsikhanouskaya was the actual winner.\n\nShe was forced to flee to Lithuania during a brutal crackdown on a wave of pro-democracy protests that erupted after the election.\n\nRomanian gymnast Ana Maria Barbosu was awarded the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics on August 16 in a ceremony in Bucharest amid controversy over who finished third in the competition.\n\n\"This result came after many years of work in the gym,\" Barbosu said, adding that the situation is \"tough\" for all the three gymnasts involved in the controversy, which arose after the bronze medal was awarded to U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles after her coach appealed her score at the end of the competition on August 5.\n\n\"It's a tough situation for us, with so many uncertainties and overwhelming emotions. I hope everyone understands that we did nothing wrong at the Olympics. And that the Olympic spirit is more important than any misunderstanding between the authorities,\" she added.\n\nOctavian Morariu, Romania's representative in the IOC, and Mihai Covaliu, president of the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, awarded Barbosu in the Bucharest ceremony.\n\n\"Today only one thing happened: Justice was done.... Well done, Ana Maria,\" Morariu said.\n\nOn the night of the competition Chiles's score was increased to 13.766 from 13.666 after her coach appealed her marks, and this moved her into third place, knocking Barbosu off the podium and leaving Barbosu in tears.\n\nDays later the Court of Arbitration (CAS) ruled that the inquiry was made past the 1-minute limit allowed under the rules of the International Gymnastics Federation, thus reinstating Chiles's original 13.666 score. The ruling bumped Barbosu back into the bronze position.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed on August 11 that Chiles must return the medal, but it is still unknown if Chiles has done so.\n\nThe medal that Barbosu received on August 16 is another medal sent by the IOC for the ceremony in Bucharest.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:59 0:00\n\nWhile the IOC said it would respect the CAS ruling, USA Gymnastics said in a statement on August 12 that it would \"continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to ensure the just scoring, placement, and medal award for Jordan.\"\n\nChiles herself has called the CAS panel's decision that she must return the medal \"unjust\" and has said she would \"make every effort to ensure that justice is served.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement quoted by the Washington Post on August 14 that it had time-stamped video proving Landi initiated the inquiry 47 seconds after Chiles's score was posted. USA Gymnastics said the footage was not available to the organization at the time of the hearing, and said that it was given less than 24 hours' notice of the hearing.\n\nUSA Gymnastics said it was notified by the CAS on August 12 that its rules do not allow for the award to be reconsidered \"even when conclusive new evidence is presented,\" adding that it was \"deeply disappointed by the notification.\"\n\nSince the CAS ruling, reports have surfaced that the chair of the panel appointed by the court to rule on the decision about the bronze medal originally awarded to Chiles included an official with ties to Romania. The reports cited documents that show Hamid Gharavi, a lawyer, previously represented Romania in international disputes."
