        "text": "Estonia sits snugly on the shores of the Baltic Sea with Finland to the north, Latvia to the south, Sweden to the west, and Russia to the east.\n\nThe country’s long coastline is dotted with 2,222 islands, a couple of them big enough to be their own counties, others so tiny you can sprint across them. Forests and wild areas cover about half of the country, including wide expanses of hauntingly beautiful wetlands. These landscapes are home to a number of birding hotspots. The largest of Estonia’s 1,500 lakes is Lake Peipsi (or Peipus), Europe’s biggest trans-boundary lake.\n\nFor the most part, Estonia is remarkably green and flat. The further down south you head, the more you’ll see rolling hills and gently undulating landscapes. Suur Munamägi, towering at a whopping 318 metres, marks the highest point in the country and all of the Baltics. It has no basecamp but the walk to the top is still delightful.\n\nEstonia is one of the smallest countries in Europe by both size and population. Of its 1.31 million people, 68% live in cities and towns, most notably Tallinn, home to roughly a third of the population (over 430,000 people).\n\nEstonians make up about two-thirds (68.7%) of the population. In recent years the international community has grown considerably, largely due to the thriving tech and startup ecosystem.\n\nEstonia is a parliamentary democracy in which the prime minister is the head of government. The head of state is the president, elected by the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) for a five-year term. The president is largely a symbolic figure but does get to appoint officials, has veto power, and is the supreme commander of national defence. Riigikogu has 101 members, elected for a period of four years. The government has executive power.\n\nEstonia regularly ranks among the most liberal countries in the world for political, economic, internet, and press freedom.\n\nYes, there are lots of lovely islands, lakes, and rivers in Estonia. But everyone has those. If you want something a bit more exotic, how about the world’s highest number of meteorite craters per square kilometre? The Kaali crater in Saaremaa is what remains of the last giant meteorite to hit an area populated by humans. It fell to Earth with the power of a nuclear bomb over 4,000 years ago.\n\nGranted, it’s not a high bar. Southern Estonia’s Suur Munamägi hill extends an astonishing 318 metres into the skies. Bring an oxygen mask! According to the Estonian national epic Kalevipoeg, Suur Munamägi was made by the giant Kalevipoeg as a pillow to rest his head on. Even if there’s not a lot of evidence to back up that claim, the hill is still a good six metres higher than the highest point in Latvia – a point of much pride for its northern neighbours!"
