        "text": "TALLINN, Estonia - Singapore and Estonia are geographically far apart but share many similarities, said President Tharman Shanmu­garatnam on June 25.\n\n“We think alike. We are both small and open nations, who embrace education and innovation as the ways to give our citizens the best opportunities in life,” said Mr Tharman at a banquet hosted in his honour by his Estonian counterpart Alar Karis.\n\nBoth nations are passionate about working with other countries and making cooperative efforts to strengthen the global public good, rather than being driven by immediate national interests, he added.\n\n“We are both uncompromising in our advocacy for a rules-based international order that governs trade and investment and the political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small.”\n\nMr Tharman is in Estonia for a two-day official visit. This is the first such visit to Estonia by a Singapore president.\n\nBefore travelling to Estonia, Mr Tharman met his Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella, as well as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, on June 24. He was also hosted to breakfast by Finnish President Alexander Stubb while in transit between Italy and Estonia.\n\nOn June 25, he was welcomed by Mr Karis at the Presidential Palace. In a private meeting, the leaders discussed the potential for collaboration between both countries, such as by encouraging companies to explore opportunities in each other’s markets.\n\nMr Tharman also laid a wreath at the Monument of the War of Independence before meeting Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The national monument was put up in memory of Estonians who died between 1918 and 1920, during the country’s War of Independence.\n\nAt the banquet, Mr Karis said: “Our dynamic and digital ecosystems make us both best gateways to our respective regions and beyond, paving the way for new technologies, ideas and collaborations.”\n\nHe added that there are great opportunities for Estonian and Singapore companies, especially in military-important fields like cyber security, defence and deep tech.\n\nMr Karis said: “Singapore and Estonia are small, but our visions and the skills to realise them are widely acknowledged. We have shown that small countries can not only exist but (also) thrive and live in global landscapes.”\n\nMr Tharman said: “We, in Singapore, have watched Estonia’s rapid development with admiration. In less than 35 years, you have achieved so much.”\n\nHe noted that both countries are relatively new friends, having established relations only in 1993, but are quickly making up for lost time.\n\nHigh-level engagements between both nations are becoming more frequent. For instance, Singapore welcomed then President Kersti Kaljulaid in 2021 at the Asia Tech x Singapore summit. In 2023, Ms Kallas also paid a visit to Singapore and jointly inaugurated the Estonian Embassy in Singapore with then Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\nMr Tharman added: “As I reflect on my visit to the Monument to the War of Independence this afternoon, I cannot help but be deeply moved by the indomitable spirit of the Estonian people.\n\n“Your struggle for independence and your journey since is not just a major chapter in your history. It is an inspiring story of how a nation has thrived by respecting its traditions and its people’s sacrifices, by upholding its own democratic values, and by innovating its way into the future.”\n\nIn a separate statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mr Tharman’s meetings with both Estonian leaders affirmed growing ties between Singapore and Estonia, including in areas such as education, cyber security and the green transition.\n\nThey also discussed regional and global developments, such as the role played by both Singapore and Estonia as small states in standing up for the international rule of law, and the need to avoid a progressive decoupling of the global economy. Estonia re-declared independence from Soviet rule in 1991.\n\nMr Tharman and his delegation’s programme includes having lunch with Estonian Speaker of Parliament Lauri Hussar on June 26, as well as visiting a cultural centre and having dinner with Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna."
