BPW Estonia experts have reached women in Norway, Finland, Moldova, Georgia, Moscow, Malta and many other places across the world.\n\nBPW Estonia initiated the program “Women in Business – GREEN AND CARING WORLD” in 2021 with the aim of creating and expanding a nationwide network of women entrepreneurs in Estonia. Network members are leaders in green business practices in their communities and society at large. The program’s goal is to increase the number of women entrepreneurs leading green business initiatives in Estonia. While the program’s initial year was focusing on raising awareness, in 2023 it is concentrating on developing practical skills in green entrepreneurship. Women participating in the program gain knowledge and expertise in green entrepreneurship, including how to make products and services environmentally friendly and create new green businesses. The program primarily supports small and medium-sized enterprises with the guidance of well-acknowledged mentors in the field of sustainability.\n\nBPW Estonia has developed during a program a Green Entrepreneurship Guide and envisions the emergence of a competitive green startup from their network.\n\nThe program started as an initiative of the BPW Estonia Tallinn Club and is part of the international network BPW International for business and professional women. By today, the program has expanded across the Europe and the world.\n\nIn 2023 the project is supported by Coca-Cola Foundation, Estonian Business School and Estonian Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.\n\nFounder of the program idea: Siiri Tiivits-Puttonen, member of BPW Estonia Green Club\n\nPartnership lead: Ester Eomois, member of BPW Estonia Enterpreneurship Club\n\nCommunications: Jolan Henriette Koduvere, member of BPW Estonia Green Club\n\nIn 2023 BPW Estonia initiated the program “Women Support Women – Estonia and Ukraine”. The aim of this project is to connect women entrepreneurs with Ukrainian refugees to support Ukrainian women in starting their lives and careers in Estonia. The project collaborates with organizations, social centers, and women’s groups supporting Ukrainian refugees.\n\nThe main partner of the project is the NGO Divergent Women, and it will run throughout 2023.\n\nOur project helps to bring people together, integrate Ukrainians into our society and to support those who have suffered greatly while grappling with language and economic barriers.\n\nDuring our project, a network will be established between Ukrainian and Estonian women who will regularly meet to encourage and support each other. Over the past year, we have also conducted webinars led by psychologists to support Ukrainian women both in Estonia and Ukraine. In collaboration with Garage 49, we are assisting 50 Ukrainian women in establishing their businesses. The network, in various forms of collaboration, encompasses 500 Ukrainian women.\n\nThe project is supported by the Coca-Cola Foundation.\n\nFounder of the program idea: Ester Eomois, member of BPW Estonia Enterpreneurship Club\n\nCommunications: Jolan Henriette Koduvere, member of BPW Estonia Green Club\n\nProject reports:"
