        "text": "Born 10 May 1928, Saaremaa\n\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia\n\n08.10.2001-09.10.2006\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was born on 10 May 1928 on the island of Saaremaa.\n\nAfter graduating from agricultural college, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel served as the senior agronomist in the Agricultural Department of the Executive Committee of the Saaremaa Soviet of Working Peopleâs Deputies from 1949-1950. He later worked as a teacher at the Tartu School of Agricultural Mechanisation, from 1955-1957.\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was appointed to the testing centre of the Scientific Research Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science in 1957, initially as its senior zootechnician, but ultimately being promoted to the position of director. From 1963-1969 he served as the director of the stateâs showcase collective farm in Tartu, earning a degree in agronomy from the Estonian Agricultural Academy during his second year in the position.\n\nIn 1969, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was elected rector of the Estonian Agricultural Academy, at which he not only fulfilled the everyday obligations of the head of the institute but also actively involved himself in scientific work.\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel held a number of high-ranking positions in politics from 1977 onwards: first he served within the stateâs political structures, then as part of its executive and legislative bodies. He was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR in 1983.\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel played an important part in the drafting of Estoniaâs Declaration of Sovereignty and in its adoption on 16 November 1988, which essentially triggered the collapse of the Soviet Union. He became known around the world as a defender of Estonian sovereignty against the might of the central government in Moscow.\n\nIn March 1990, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was elected by the people to the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR, whose members then installed him as their chairman at their first session. With his involvement, what was then the highest legitimate authority in the country adopted a decision on âthe national status of Estoniaâ. This decision declared the state power of the USSR unlawful in Estonia from the moment of its establishment and triggered a transition period leading to the restoration of the Estonian republic. Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel served as the chairman of the Supreme Council until October 1992.\n\nOn 12 May 1990, the Baltic Council was established on Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼telâs initiative. From the point of view of the fight for independence, the council would go on to play an important role in the formation of a united front between the three Baltic States. On 20 August 1991, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia adopted a decision on the national independence of Estonia, and less than a month later, on 17 September, the Republic of Estonia was accepted as a fully fledged member of the United Nations. The pitched but bloodless battle for independence in Estonia had borne fruit. Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel led the country throughout these years and was a key figure in uniting people and political forces to achieve their shared objective.\n\nAlongside his role as statesman, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel continued with his studies and research, earning himself a doctorate in agriculture in 1991. He is an honorary doctor of a number of institutions (Bentley College in the United States, the University of Helsinki in Finland, the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, the L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University in Kazakhstan and the Szent IstvÃ¡n University of Agriculture and Life Sciences in Hungary among them), a professor emeritus of the Estonian Agricultural University and an honorary member of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine. He has authored more than 100 scientific articles published in Estonia and abroad. He addressed the UN General Assembly as the Estonian head of state in 1991. He also spoke at the UN Climate Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which ushered in a new era in nature conservation around the globe.\n\nFrom 1991-1992, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was a member of the Constitutional Assembly, which was charged with the task of drafting a new constitution for the Republic of Estonia. He stood in the presidential elections of 1992, earning the backing of 43% of the electorate. With a record number of votes he was then elected to the Riigikogu in 1995, of which he was in turn elected Vice-President. He served as the chairman of the centre-right Country Peopleâs Party, which boasted one of the highest number of members of any Estonian political party, from 1994-2000. The party changed its name to the Peopleâs Union of Estonia in 1999.\n\nIn 1995, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was elected as the head of the Baltic Assembly delegation to the Riigikogu and as the chairman of the Presidium of the Baltic Assembly for a term of four years.\n\nIn parallel with his life in politics, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel is recognised for the public role he has played over the years. From 1981-1988 he was the chairman of the Estonian Nature Society, while from 1989-2002 he was the chairman of the Forselius Society, promoting education. In 1993 he founded the Institute for National Development and Cooperation, which set itself the objective of studying Estoniaâs primary development factors. That same year he became the president of the Estonian organisation of Green Cross International. The aim of the organisation within Estonia is to rid the country of contaminants and pollutants left over from the Soviet army and to deal with their consequences, and to maintain Estonia as a clean and environmentally friendly place for future generations. From that time until he was elected president, Arnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel also served as the chairman of the âKeep the Estonian Sea Tidyâ movement, which takes it upon itself to keep the countryâs more than 3500 km of coastline clean and to construct new and restore existing harbours for small craft.\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼telâs wife Ingrid is a doctor of humanities, an internationally renowned folklorist and the president of the Baltica folklore association. They have two daughters and six grandchildren.\n\nArnold RÃ¼Ã¼tel was elected President of the Republic of Estonia by the electoral college on 21 September 2001 and sworn in on 8 October 2001.\n\nMEMBERSHIP OF UNIONS & ASSOCIATIONS\n\n1981-1988 | Chairman of the Estonian Nature Society (honorary member since 1989)\n\n1989-2002 | Chairman of the Forselius Society (honorary chairman since 2002)\n\n1993-2001 | President of the Estonian organisation of Green Cross International\n\n1993-2002 | Chairman of the âKeep the Estonian Sea Tidyâ movement (honorary chairman since 2002)\n\n1994 | Member of the 20th of August Club\n\n1999 | Member of the NGO Konstantin PÃ¤ts Museum\n\n2002 | Honorary member of the Estonian Academic Agricultural Society\n\n2002 | Honorary member of the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation\n\n2002 | Member of the Association of Friends of Tallinn Botanic Garden\n\nÂ\n\nRECOGNITION & DECORATIONS\n\n1991 | Honorary doctor of Bentley College (USA)\n\n1991 | Honorary doctor of the Estonian Agricultural University\n\n1993 | Professor emeritus of the Estonian Agricultural University\n\n2002 | Honorary member of the Estonian Academic Agricultural Society\n\n2002 | Honorary doctor of the University of Helsinki (Finland)\n\n2002 | Honorary doctor of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine\n\n2002 | Decoration of Rotary International\n\n2002 | Order of the International Military Sports Council\n\n2002 | Andres Bello memorial medal\n\n2002 | Honorary doctor of the University of Naples Federico II (Italy)\n\n2002 | Academic and honorary member of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences (Ukraine)\n\n2003 | Decoration of the White Cross, 1st class of the Defence League\n\n2004 | Honorary doctor of the Szent IstvÃ¡n University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (Hungary)\n\n2004 | Honorary doctor of the L.N.
