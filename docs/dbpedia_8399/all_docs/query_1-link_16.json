        "text": "Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas laid to rest speculation over whether she would challenge Ursula von der Leyen for European Commission president.\n\nKallas said at a press conference on Thursday that she will not be the lead candidate for Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE)/Renew Europe in the European Parliament election in June, Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported.\n\n“I have considered this proposal very thoroughly, and it has both pros and cons. But I have informed the ALDE leadership of my decision not to take up the role,” Kallas said.\n\nInstead, she wants to remain Estonian prime minister and focus her efforts on her current job.\n\n“Running for a half-win would be unfair,” she said.\n\nKallas said she was flattered by the speculation, adding that it’s “likely a sign that we’ve been doing something right.” She also did not close the door on running for another top EU post in the future.\n\n“I cannot confirm that I will be prime minister forever, but I don’t think the speculation will end in any case. My name has been mentioned in different places,” Kallas said.\n\nKallas’ decision comes as her polling numbers have dipped to an all-time low. When the current coalition entered office in April 2023, support for her was close to 40 percent. A poll in January found that only 16 percent of people preferred her to remain as prime minister."
