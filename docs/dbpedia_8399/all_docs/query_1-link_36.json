        "text": "Italy and Estonia\n\nHistory\n\nItaly recognised the Republic of Estonia on 26 January 1921. The first Italian Ambassador to Estonia was Agostino Depretis who presented his credentials in February 1921. Before World War II, Italy’s Institute of Culture was active in Estonia. Historian Indro Montanelli, a grand figure in the Italian press, headed it.\n\nIn June 1921, Estonia’s first diplomatic representative in Italy Karl Robert Pusta, residing in Paris, presented his credentials. The first Estonian Ambassador to reside in Rome was Karl Tofer (1927-1931). In addition to the legation in Rome, Estonia had Honorary Consulates in Genoa, Milan, Naples, Palermo and Trieste.\n\nItaly, which never recognized the sovereignty of the Soviet Union on the Baltic States, re-recognised Estonia on 27 August 1991. Diplomatic relations between Estonia and Italy were restored on 31 August 1991. Italy sent a residing Ambassador to Tallinn and supported Estonia’s admission to the EU and NATO. This positive cooperation has continued in the wider context of the multilateral fora of which both are members.\n\nEstonia’s Embassy in Rome resumed work in September 1996, led by Chargé d’Affaires a.i. Ruth Lausma. In September 1998, Estonia’s first ambassador since the restoration of the Republic, Jaak Jõerüüt, presented his credentials. After that Estonia was represented from 2002 to 2006 by Jüri Seilenthal, from 2006 to 2010 by Andres Tomasberg, from 2010 to 2014 by Merike Kokajev, from 2014-2020 by Celia Kuningas-Saagpakk and Paul Teesalu was appointed as the Estonian Ambassador in 2020. Estonia is also represented in Italy by six honorary consuls.\n\nThe presence of industrious and well integrated, albeit small, Estonian and Italian communities in both countries also contributes to the excellent quality of the bilateral relations.\n\n2021 marked the centenary of the establishment of diplomatic relation between Italy and Estonia (26 January) and thirty years since their reestablishment after the newfound independence in 1991 (27 August).\n\nThe last few years have seen an increase in contacts between Head of States: on May 5/6 2017, June 26/27 2017, October 9 2017 and December 2/3 2020 President Mattarella received in Roma President Kaljulaid. Furthermore, President Mattarella, accompanied by the Italian Foreign Minister Moavero Milanesi, made a State visit in Estonia on July 4 2018, in a tour of the Baltic States (July 2-6), during the centenary of the country independence.\n\nAlso on a government level meetings have increased in the last few years, between Head of Government (meeting in Brussels in April 2017 between Prime Minister Gentiloni and his counterpart Ratas, that met again in Rome in November 2018), Foreign Ministers (meeting between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs Alfano and Mikser during the Rome Conference of July 6 2017 and, always in Roma, in February 2018. Meeting between Minister Moavero and his counterpart Mikser in Tallinn in July 2018, during a State visit) and Defence Ministers (Ministers Pinotti and Tsahkna met in May 2017 in Roma. Always in Rome, in October 2018, a meeting took place between Ministers Trenta and Luik).\n\nParliamentary relations are also excellent. In 1993, the first Italian-Estonian parliamentary group was established in the Riigikogu, confirmed by each legislature. The current is chaired by Hon. Signe Kiv. In the Italian Parliament a bilateral section of friendship with the Baltic States was created inside the Italian Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, chaired by Hon. Raoul Russo (FdI). From May 2018 it is also active an Association “Friends of the Baltic Republics” chaired by. Sen. Isabella Rauti.\n\nThe excellence of the bilateral relations is also confirmed by the fruitful co-operation in all multilateral fora, especially within the European Union. A good co-operation has also always been attained with regard to the mutual support to the two countries’ international candidacies.\n\nTechnical bilateral contacts are also common, and there is a positive cooperation between local authorities (lastly the visit from Venice Council Member Simone Venturini in Tallinn in March 2023).\n\nMeetings\n\nMarch 1994: Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta
