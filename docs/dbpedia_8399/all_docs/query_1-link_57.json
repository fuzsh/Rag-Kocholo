The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:02 p.m. in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Gordon H. Smith, [chairman of the subcommittee], presiding. Present: Senators Smith and Biden. Senator Smith. Ladies and gentlemen, we will call to order this committee hearing of the European Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations. It is a pleasure to welcome you all here, and particularly Assistant Secretary Marc Grossman, to testify on U.S. Baltic policy. Specifically, the subcommittee will review the current state of affairs in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and the goal of U.S. foreign policy in these countries. Mr. Grossman's testimony will be followed by that of three outside experts, Dr. Richard Krickus of Mary Washington College, Dr. Andrejs Plakans of Iowa State University, and Dr. Toivo Raun of Indiana University. We thank these gentlemen. I apologize if I mispronounced your names. We thank you for your willingness to help us better understand the state of affairs in these three important countries. In 1991, after nearly a half century of occupation, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania regained their independence, yet while these two halves of Europe are no longer separated by concrete walls or opposing armies, a division persists in the minds of many, who simply cannot comprehend the meaning of the end of the cold war. With the end of the cold war, every single nation in Europe has earned the right to choose democratically the direction of their policies, and the institutions they will join to ensure the prosperity and security of their citizens. Those who seek to block the aspirations of democratic Governments to develop the fullest potential of their own nations in this regard stand against the tide of history that brought down the Berlin Wall. I am encouraged by United States policy toward Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, a product of close consultation between the executive branch and Congress. Mr. Grossman, I commend you and your staff for developing a creative, realistic policy that offers the possibility of integrating Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania fully into the community of Europe and the United States. Last May, when 59 U.S. Senators voted to reject any arbitrary pause on consideration of future NATO members, the Senate sent an unmistakable message that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are not just the newest and will not be the last countries to be considered for NATO membership. I am confident that a substantial majority in the Senate still welcomes the aspirations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to join NATO, and will work closely with the administration over time to achieve that reality. In the interim, we seek new ways to promote the prosperity and strengthen the security of these three countries, and we must oppose any attempt by any other power to coerce these countries through force or economic pressure to change their democratic course. The cold war is over, and the ideology and geography of the former Soviet Union have, indeed, be consigned to history. I believe Senator Biden will join us shortly. He has just voted, and is on his way back, but Secretary Grossman, again we thank you, and we welcome, now, your testimony. STATEMENT OF HON. MARC GROSSMAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EUROPEAN AND CANADIAN AFFAIRS Mr. Grossman. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. It is a pleasure--really, it is an honor to appear before you today to discuss U.S. policy toward the Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I thought I would read a shortened version of a longer statement which we would obviously submit for the record, if that would be acceptable to you. Senator Smith. It is. We welcome that. Mr. Grossman. Let me first of all pick up on a point that you made in your opening remarks, which is that my first job, really, is to thank you and all of your colleagues in the Senate and the House for your strong support of our policy not only in the Baltics but in Northern Europe generally. Our joint efforts have led to many accomplishments and, in fact, we certainly encourage travel by Senators, and I know Mr. Beigun and I have talked about the possibility of a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff trip to the area, and we would certainly welcome that, because we believe that this policy is a result of close consultation and work that you and I and all of us have done together, so I thank you very much for those points. I would also like to thank you, if I could, for scheduling hearings tomorrow for our Ambassadors-designate to Estonia and to Latvia. Senator Smith. You are welcome. Mr. Grossman. Excellent nominees. Mr. Chairman, you have it right. This administration is proud of its Baltic policy. In fact, Secretary Albright often refers to the signing ceremony of the U.S. Baltic Charter in the East room of the White House this past January as one of the great days of her tenure as Secretary of State. At that signing ceremony, President Clinton said, ``that NATO's door is and will remain open to every partner nation, and America is determined to create the conditions under which Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania can one day walk through that door.'' Today, my job is to report to you on where we stand since the signing of the U.S. Baltic Charter of partnership on January 16 by President Clinton and the presidents of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. Indeed, just last week, Deputy Secretary of State Talbott led the U.S. delegation to the inaugural meeting of the partnership commission set up under the charter. [See appendix for the July 8, 1998 remarks of Mr. Talbott] Mr. Grossman. With your permission, I would like to just step back for a moment and review our goals, our objectives, and then our accomplishments. This administration's Baltic policy--you can sum anything up in a short phrase. This administration's Baltic policy can be summed up in three words: Champion of integration. We want the United States to be the champion of integration of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into European and transatlantic institutions. That is what the Baltic Charter is all about. Now, we have set ourselves the following goals in order to meet this requirement. First, we set out to manage the NATO enlargement process in a fashion that would not only increase the security of those who are currently invited to join the alliance, but also those who may join later or who may for their own reasons choose never to join. Second, we want to build a new Europe without dividing lines, as you say, where the old zero sum politics of the cold war are replaced by what Secretary Albright I think has very rightly called win-win mentality. Last week in Riga Strobe Talbott said, ``it is in the national interests of the United States that the Baltic States regain their rightful place in the European mainstream. The upheavals of the 20th Century have taught us that when any part of Europe is isolated, repressed, unstable, or torn by violence, the peace of the entire Euro-Atlantic community is at risk. We learned that lesson the hard way in the 20th Century, and we must apply it in the right way in the 21st.'' The third goal. The Baltic Charter sends the message that we and the Baltic States share a common vision of a new Europe and a new Euro-Atlantic community, and that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are part of that vision. The charter makes clear that the Baltics will not be excluded or discriminated against because of geography or history, or because of the injustices of the past. At the same time, the charter does not contain pre-commitments, but underscores that these States, like other aspiring countries, need to meet the same high standards that NATO sets for all new members, and the alliance as a whole must reach consensus that inclusion would serve our collective security interests. Let me highlight now our accomplishments and review our objectives for the future. Let me start, if I could, with some of the accomplishments in the political area. Mr. Chairman, one of the most important things we have done together in the political field is to provide a clear perspective for the eventual integration of these countries into European and Transatlantic institutions. We find that the leaders of these countries are no longer preoccupied that they might be left in some kind of a gray zone. Instead, they are focused on what they need to do to make themselves the strongest possible candidates for the future integration to European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. Politically, we are working together to consolidate the transition to democracy of these three countries. Let me give you some examples of how we are doing that. We are supporting the development of civil society, joining with the Soros Foundation to found and to fund the Baltic American Partnership Foundation, which will provide $15 million to develop and sustain local nongovernmental organizations in the Baltic States. In addition, we are assisting these countries, especially Estonia and Latvia, in the area of social integration, particularly in support of legislation that meets the OSCE's recommendations on citizenship, and so therefore we salute the Baltic States for the important steps that they have taken to translate these ideas in to reality. Throughout the debate on this important issue, the United States has supported those seeking to bring national legislation into conformity with OSCE recommendations and at the same time we have made it clear that the OSCE's recommendations are the only benchmark we recognize, and that we will not support any additional demands for moving the goal posts on these issues. We are also taking concrete steps to support the Riga Graduate Law School, which is being created by several Council of Baltic Sea States members. The school is an important effort to ensure that students from the Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, notably including ethnic minorities, will receive high quality legal training. One other point, Mr. Chairman. In May we salute the fact that Presidents Meri, Ulmanis, and Adamkus jointly announced that they would establish national commissions to study the period of the Holocaust and of the totalitarian rule in each of their countries. Our close political ties with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania extend to broad agreement on a number of key regional and world issues as well, and to cite just one example, earlier this year, when the United States sought support in the event that military action might be necessary against Saddam Hussein, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania all volunteered to send whatever support they could provide. Mr. Chairman, we have also had some accomplishments in the economic area I would like to report to you, because we see stronger economic and commercial ties with these three countries as critical to our overall strategy of integration, and to the prosperity and security of these countries. This spring, the economic bilateral working groups established under the Baltic Charter were held under the chairmanship of Under secretary of State for Economic Affairs Stu Eizenstadt, and with the Baltic countries we set priority issues to focus our efforts on energy, telecommunications, transportation, the environment. We are working closely with our embassies in the countries located on the Baltic. We are developing a regional economic and commercial strategy to bolster U.S. investment and to highlight the potential role of the three Baltic States as an economic platform from which companies can access markets in the European Union, the Baltic States, and in Northwestern Russia. Our strategy is designed to help the Baltic States regain the status and the role they once enjoyed as key trading partners at a time, now, when Northern Europe enjoys some of the fastest growing economies in Europe as a whole, but for this to happen, we need to encourage the Baltic States, and they need to see themselves as part of a larger market, not just the 10 million people in the Baltic States, but of 100 million people in the Baltic region, the five Nordics, the three Baltic States, Poland, Russia, especially Northwestern Russia. We will pursue that strategy bilaterally as well as through regional organizations, such as the Council on Baltic Sea States, seeking to reduce regional trade barriers and to create a more attractive environment for regional and American businesses. In this connection we are reaching out to our private sector to engage American businesses, and at the inaugural Baltic Charter Partnership Commission last week in Riga, we had more than 30 business leaders from the private sector who identified 12 specific recommendations and offered to work with Government authorities to set up goals and timetables to meet these objectives. We want to employ, to use, to buildup the successful methods developed in partnerships like we have with the European Union in the Transatlantic business dialog to address key concerns of the private sector and to identify ways that we can help improve trade and investment links between the United States and the Baltic links, and to help make good on this commitment, the Department of Commerce has agreed to increase staffing at our embassy in Stockholm, adding an officer with regional responsibilities for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. We also continue to support the Baltic-American Enterprise Fund, which provides an average of $1 million a month in loans and investments throughout the Baltic States, and in 3 years it has made over 100 business loans to and investments in small and medium-sized enterprises and approved more than 250 mortgages to individuals. In this connection, I also think it is important to highlight, and there is more in my statement for the record, our very good cooperation in combating organized crime in the area, because we think that these joint efforts to combat crime address a real problem, help build regional and Transatlantic ties among law enforcement professionals, and hold out the hope of improving the business environment for local entrepreneurs and American business people as well. And finally, we continue to support the efforts of the three Baltic States to join the European Union, and obviously we are not members of the European Union, but our goal is to assure that our support for their aspirations is clear and consistent. Last January, President Clinton committed the United States to work to help these countries to gain entry into the World Trade Organization on the appropriate commercial basis. Finally, Mr. Chairman, a few words about security accomplishments, because we have made security cooperation a top priority in our relations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Following Secretary Albright's visit to Vilnius last July, we agreed on the need to establish a long-term modernization plan for the defense forces of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania which would simultaneously strengthen their own self defense capabilities as well as their ability to contribute to European security, and last fall the Department of Defense took the lead in forming a team which was very successfully headed by Major General Buzz Kievenaar, who did a wonderful job that would assist the Baltic States in this effort. General Kievenaar's team assisted the Baltic countries in identifying current weaknesses in their defense forces, setting priorities as well as developing a force modernization plan that would allow them to develop small but modern and capable militaries. Each of the three Baltic States has welcomed these efforts, and is currently incorporating many of the details into their own national defense planning priorities. Of course, defense modernization is only one aspect of security in today's Europe, and together with our Baltic partners we have also identified confidence-building measures and arms control as two additional elements that could constitute an overall package approach to security in the region. Now, the Baltic Security Assistance Group, which is NATO members and non-NATO members, serves as a forum for coordinating donor assistance to the Baltic States, and we want to help the Baltic States improve their defense capabilities. It will also be an important forum for implementing the priorities identified by the DOD study and incorporate it into national defense plans. The program such as BALTSEA, the Baltic Battalion, the Baltic Air Space Management regime, the Baltic Squadron, and the Baltic Defense College, have already helped these three countries to make a concrete contribution to their own national defense as well as to broader European security. Troops from all three countries have served as peace keepers in Bosnia. Tomorrow, 16 July, some 2,000 U.S. soldiers will join them in this year's Baltic Challenge, an annual, in the spirit of PFP exercise. This year's exercise will be hosted by Lithuania and will include troops from 11 participating countries. Last and far from least, with the cooperation of the Congress we have significantly increased the amount of security assistance for the Baltic States under the Warsaw initiative program to $18.9 million. We hope to maintain a similar level for fiscal year 1999 to help the Baltics meet the challenges identified by the DOD study. Mr. Chairman, I said in my opening few paragraphs that we see our relationships with the Baltic States as part of our larger effort to do the right thing in Northeastern Europe, and to do that we need to talk, obviously, about Russia, and so I would like to just say a few words, if I could, about relations there. We all recognize that the relations of the three Baltic States with Russia is one of the most acute challenges we face in our common efforts to enhance democracy, prosperity, and stability throughout the region. For their part, the Baltic peoples harbor deep anxiety and suspicion about Russian motivations and the Russians, too, worry about the prospects of the Baltic States fulfilling their absolutely legitimate desire to join NATO. President Clinton and Secretary Albright believe that it is in the Russians' interests to get over this particular concern, and this applies to the issue of NATO enlargement in general, as well as the specific issue of possible Baltic membership in the alliance. In a speech last year at Stanford, Strobe Talbott said, and in the final analysis, Russia will have to make that adjustment by itself, by its own lights, and for its own reasons, but we and our European partners can help. We can help by applying the same general principle of inclusiveness in specific instances, and that means promoting Russia's involvement to the greatest extent possible in the cooperative development along the Baltic littoral. Working with the Baltic States, our goal is to convince Russia to see this area not as a zone of influence, not as a buffer against nonexistent enemies, but as a gateway outward to the new Europe, of which Russia seeks to be an increasingly active partner. Mr. Chairman, Northern Europe is an area where we can show- case the strategy that you talked about, which is creating a win-win situation in the new Europe. Recently, the Economist Magazine referred to the region as undergoing a Baltic revolution, a tide of reform and integration that has made this region one of Europe's most promising. Last September in Norway, in fact the very first thing I did as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, we launched our Northern European initiative so that we could participate in and promote these trends. Our initiative consists of three tracks. The first is to help Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania help themselves to become the strongest possible candidates for western integration. The second track is to build on the excellent ties and cooperation we enjoy with the Nordic countries on Baltic issues, and to expand such cooperation with others in the region such as Germany, Poland, and the European Union. The third and final track is to implement the kind of inclusive policy toward Russia that I described earlier. As a result, we have stepped up our efforts to support regional cooperation in these structures like the Council of Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Arctic Council, each of which provides an effective forum for working alongside all nations of the region, including Russia, on a host of economic, social, and environmental issues. Mr. Chairman, achieving our goals will be far from quick and far from easy, but we have a common set of objectives, and increasingly a shared strategy. Moreover, we are all impressed, filled with admiration of how much the countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have accomplished in the short time since regaining their independence. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Grossman follows:] Prepared Statement of Marc Grossman Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss U.S. policy towards the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Let me first thank you and your colleagues in the Senate and the House for your strong support for our Baltic policy. Our joint efforts have led to many of our accomplishments. I would also like to thank you for scheduling the hearings tomorrow for our Ambassador- designates to Estonia and Latvia. Mr. Chairman, this Administration is proud of its Baltic policy. Secretary Albright often refers to the signing ceremony of the U.S.- Baltic Charter in the East Room of the White House this past January as one of the great days in her tenure as Secretary of State. My own interest in the Baltic states goes back 15 years to when my spouse served as the State Department desk officer responsible for relations with the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whose occupation by the Soviet Union the United States never recognized. I had the opportunity to meet those courageous Ambassadors who kept hope alive, and to work with Members of Congress and other Americans interested in the cause of freedom. I could not help but sense the vitality of the Baltic peoples, their longing for freedom and their desire to regain their ties to the West. It has been a pleasure to renew my engagement with these countries and with northern Europe as Assistant Secretary of State. My first act overseas as Assistant Secretary of State was to represent Secretary Albright at a meeting of Nordic and Baltic Foreign Ministers to highlight our policy towards northern Europe in Bergeh, Norway in September 1997. Last month I represented the United States in Nyborg, Denmark at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Council of Baltic Sea States where I talked about ways the United States can contribute to greater cooperation and stability around the Baltic littoral. Today I report to you on where we stand since the signing of the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership on January 16 by President Clinton and the Presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. At that signing ceremony, President Clinton said ``NATO's door is and will remain open to every partner nation, and America is determined to create the conditions under which Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia can one day walk through that door.'' We are now making good on that commitment. Just last week Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott led the U.S. delegation to the inaugural meeting of the Partnership Commission set up under the Charter. Last Friday, Under Secretary Stuart Eizenstat was in Vilnius, representing the U.S. at a regional trade ministers conference to advance our participation in regional economic cooperation. With your permission, I'd like to review our goals and our activities. Policy Goals Mr. Chairman, this Administration's Baltic policy can be summed up in three words--champion of integration. We want the United States to be a champion of the integration of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into European and transatlantic institutions. That is what the Baltic Charter is all about. In diplomacy, as in other walks of life, there is at times a temptation to ignore or defer on difficult or sensitive issues in the hope that they may somehow become easier to deal with in the future. The Baltic issue is a sensitive one. Some would suggest it be put in the ``too hard'' box. This Administration has adopted a different approach. From the outset, it recognized the importance and the sensitivity of the Baltic issue, especially in the NATO enlargement debate. This is one reasonwhy we set for ourselves the following goals: First, we set out to manage the NATO enlargement process in a fashion that not only increased the security of those currently invited to join the Alliance, but also those who may join later or who may choose never to join. That is why Secretary Albright says that she has spent as much time thinking about those countries not yet ready to join Western institutions as those which already have been invited. Second, we want our European strategy to foster building a new Europe without dividing lines, where the old ``zero sum'' politics of the Cold War are replaced by what Secretary Albright calls a ``win- win'' mentality. During his visit last week to the region, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott said that ``it is in the national interest of the United States that the Baltic states regain their rightful place in the European mainstream. The upheavals of the 20th century have taught us that when any part of Europe is isolated, repressed, unstable or torn by violence, the peace of the entire Euro-Atlantic community is at risk. We learned that lesson the hard way in the 20th century; we must apply it in the right way in the 2lst.'' Third, we designed the Baltic Charter to send the message that we and the Baltic states share a common vision of a new Europe and Euro- Atlantic community--and that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are part of that vision. It makes clear that he Baltics will not be excluded or discriminated against because of geography or history and the injustices of the past. The Baltic states will enjoy a level playing field when it comes to their aspirations to join institutions such as the European Union or NATO. At the same time, the Charter does not contain precommitments. It is a politically, rather than a legally binding document. While the Administration can speak for itself, it cannot speak for NATO as a whole--nor for the U.S. Senate. The Charter also underscores that these states--like all other aspiring countries--must meet the same high standards that NATO sets for all new members. And, the Alliance as a whole must reach consensus that inclusion would serve our collective strategic interests. This is a race that the Baltic states have to run themselves. But they understand that this race is a marathon, not a sprint. The point is to stay in the race and finish. We can help coach them--and make it clear that one day we want them to successfully cross the finish line. Let me now highlight our accomplishments and review the objectives we have set for our future cooperation. Political Accomplishments Mr. Chairman, one of the most important things we have accomplished together in the political realm is to provide a clear and shared perspective for the eventual integration of these countries into European and transatlantic institutions. The leaders of these countries are no longer preoccupied that they might be left in some kind of ``gray zone.'' Instead, they are focused on what they need to be doing to make themselves the strongest possible candidates for their future integration into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. Politically, we are working together to consolidate the transition to democracy in these three countries. We are supporting the development of civil societies, joining with the Soros Foundation to fund the Baltic-American Partnership Foundation which will provide $15 million to develop and sustain local NGOs in the Baltic states. In addition, we are assisting these countries, especially Estonia and Latvia, in the area of social integration, particularly in support of legislation that meets the OSCE's recommendations on citizenship. In the Baltic Charter, all four of our Presidents affirmed a shared commitment to the rule of law and to the responsibility of all just societies to protect and respect human rights and civil liberties and vowed to work toward making inclusiveness and reconciliation watchwords for the future. We salute the Baltic states for the important steps they have taken to translate these ideas into reality. On June 22, the Latvian Parliament passed amendments to Latvia's citizenship laws to make the process of naturalization easier. To support the implementation of this new legislation, we have pledged $500,000 to a practical project which will assist the government of Latvia in carrying out the provisions of the new law. We also are taking steps to support the Riga graduate law school, which is being created by several Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS) member states. The school is an important effort to ensure that students from the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, notably including ethnic minorities, will receive high-quality legal training in a range of subjects to help consolidate the rule of law, human rights and democracy in the region. Throughout debate on this important issue the U.S. has supported those seeking to bring national legislation into conformity with OSCE recommendations. While we salute the progress that Estonia and Latvia have made, we all understand that there is always room for improvement. At the same time, we have made it clear that the OSCE's recommendations are the only benchmark we recognize and that we will not support any additional demands or ``moving of the goal posts'' on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to mention one final example which underscores the commitment of these countries to the cause of reconciliation and justice, values we embraced in the Charter. In May, Presidents Meri, Ulmanis and Adamkus jointly announced that they would establish national commissions to study the period of the Holocaust and of totalitarian rule in each of their countries. We salute them for that. Our close political ties with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania extend beyond bilateral issues. We are in broad agreement on a number of key regional and global issues. To cite one example, earlier this year, the United States sought support in the event that military action against Iraq might be necessary. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all volunteered to send whatever support they could provide. Economic Accomplishments Mr. Chairman, we also see stronger economic and commercial ties with these three countries as critical to our overall strategy of integration and to the prosperity and security of these countries. We have stepped up our efforts to expand our bilateral economic relations with each of these countries. We want to promote a regional economic and commercial strategy that would attract American business and investment and support the economic integration of each of these three countries into the European Union as well as the World Trade Organization. This spring the economic bilateral working groups established under the Charter were held under the chairmanship of Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Stuart Eizenstat. They brought together representatives of a broad range of agencies and departments, from Commerce to OPIC and from Energy to Treasury to review with their counterparts the status of key economic, trade, financial and commercial issues. Together, we set priority areas in which to focus our efforts: energy, telecommunications, transportation and the environment. Working closely with our Embassies in the countries located on the Baltic, we are developing a regional economic and commercial strategy to bolster U.S. investment and to highlight the potential role of the three Baltic states as an economic platform from which companies can access markets in the European Union, Northern Europe, and Russia. The countries of Northern Europe are among the wealthiest in the world--and they have gained that prosperity in large part through trade. Our strategy is designed to help the Baltic states regain the status and role they once enjoyed as key trading partners at a time when Northern Europe enjoys some of the fastest growing economies in Europe as a whole. But for this to happen, the Baltic states must see themselves as part of a larger market--not just of 10 million in the Baltic states, but of 100 million in the Baltic region--the five Nordics, the three Baltics, Poland and Russia, especially the northwestern part. We will pursue that strategy bilaterally as well as through regional organizations such as the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS), seeking to reduce regional trade barriers, and create a more attractive environment for regional and American business. We also have been working with our allies and the European Union to make sure that our initiatives complement or bring ``value added'' to EU assistance activities that support these regional goals. To that end, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat attended the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS) Trade Ministers' meeting in Vilnius July 10. He reinforced our message that the reduction or elimination of barriers to trade is critical to regional development and prosperity. In this connection we are reaching out to the private sector to engage American business. At the inaugural Baltic Charter Partnership Commission meeting last week in Riga, more than 30 business leaders from the private sector met to discuss creating a partnership between the public and private sectors to boost U.S.-Baltic economic ties. We want to employ the successful methods developed in partnerships like the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue to address the key concerns of the private sector and to identify steps that can help improve trade and investment links between the U.S. and the Baltic states. This group identified 12 specific recommendations to the governments of the U.S., Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and offered to work with government authorities to set up concrete goals and timetables to meet those goals. To help make good on that commitment, the Department of Commerce has agreed to increase staffing at our Embassy in Stockholm, adding an officer with regional responsibilities solely for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We continue to support. the Baltic-American Enterprise Fund, which provides an average of $1 million per month in loans and investments throughout the Baltic states. In three years it has made over 100 business loans to and investments in small and medium-sized enterprises and approved more than 250 mortgages to individuals. In this connection, I might also mention our cooperation in combating organized crime. In response to requests from the governments of Latvia and Lithuania, in recent months the FBI has supplied training teams to boost the skills of local investigators. More broadly, we have developed a strategy for cooperating regionally, notably with the CBSS Task Force on Organized Crime chaired by Sweden, to assist in the regional fight against crime. Such assistance and cooperation addresses a real crime problem, helps build regional and transatlantic ties among law enforcement professionals, and holds out the hope of improving the business environment for local entrepreneurs and American business people alike. Finally, we continue to support the efforts of the three Baltic states to join the European Union. While we are not members of the EU, our goal is to ensure that our support for their aspirations to join the EU is clear and consistent, while at the same time ensuring that US companies will not be unfairly disadvantaged as the Baltic states make necessary adjustments to bring them in line with the EU acquis communitaire. Last January President Clinton also committed the U.S. to work to help these countries gain entry to the WTO on the appropriate commercial basis. Security Accomplishments Mr. Chairman, we have also made security cooperation a top priority in our relations with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Following Secretary Albright's visit to Vilnius last July, we agreed on the need to establish a long-term modernization plan for the defense forces of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which would simultaneously strengthen their own self-defense capabilities as well as their ability to contribute to overall European security. Last fall the Department of Defense took the lead in forming a team (headed by Major General ``Buzz'' Kievenaar) that would assist the Baltic states in this effort. They conducted a baseline assessment of the current status of the national defense forces in each of these countries. Working together with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Kievenaar's team assisted these countries in identifying current weaknesses, setting priorities as well as developing a force modernization plan that would allow them to develop small but modern and capable militaries. The study's emphasis on defense basics and quality of life issues will also help our partners plan their assistance requests. Each of the three Baltic states has welcomed these efforts and is currently incorporating many of the details into their own national defense planning and priorities. Defense modernization is only one aspect of security in today's Europe. Together with our Baltic partners, we have also identified confidence-building measures and arms control as two additional elements that could constitute an overall package approach to security in the region. On the margins of the Luxembourg NAC, we and our Baltic partners reached agreement on a ``common agenda'' on CSBMs and possible arms control measures. The Baltic Security Assistance Group (BALTSEA) serves as the forum for coordinating donor assistance to the Baltic states. This group brings together NATO and non-NATO countries committed to helping the Baltic states improve their defense capabilities. At quarterly meetings Baltic officials discuss their priorities and needs with DOD officials and their counterparts and coordinate progress on projects such as the Baltic Battalion (BaltBat), Baltic Airspace Management Regime (BaltNet), the Baltic squadron (Baltron), and the Baltic Defense College (BaltDefCol) BALTSEA will also be a critical forum for implementing the priorities identified by the DOD study and incorporated into national defense plans. Such programs have already helped these three countries to make a concrete contribution to their own national defense as well as broader European security. Troops from all three countries have served as peace keepers in Bosnia. The Baltic states have been active in PfP programs. Starting tomorrow (July 16), some 2,000 U.S. soldiers will join them for this year's Baltic challenge, an annual ``in the spirit of PfP'' exercise. This year's exercise will be hosted by Lithuania and will include troops from 11 participating countries. Last, but far from least, with the cooperation of Congress, we have significantly increased the amount of security assistance for the Baltic states under the Warsaw Initiative program to $18.9 million. This was a fourfold increase over previous years and reflects in large part the construction of the Baltic Regional Airspace Initiative. We hope to maintain a similar level for FY99 to help the Baltics meet the challenges identified by the DOD study. Russia and the The Northern European Initiative (NEI) Mr. Chairman, I'd also like to say a word about another Baltic littoral country with which the three Baltic states share a complex and often tragic history. That country is Russia. We all recognize that the relationships of the three Baltic countries with Russia is one of the most acute challenges we face in our common efforts to enhance democracy, prosperity and stability throughout the region. For their part, the Baltic peoples harbor deep anxieties and suspicions about Russian motivations. The Russians, too, worry about the prospect of the Baltic states fulfilling their legitimate desire to join NATO. President Clinton and Secretary Albright believe that it is in the Russians' interest to get over this particular concern. This applies to the issue of NATO enlargement in general as well as the specific issue of possible Baltic membership in the Alliance. In a speech last year at Stanford University, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott said, ``In the final analysis, Russia will have to make that adjustment itself, by its own lights and for its own reasons. But we and our European partners can help.'' We can help by applying the same general principle of inclusiveness in specific instances. That means promoting Russia's involvement to the greatest extent possible in the political, commercial, environmental and other forms of cooperation developing among the states of the Baltic littoral. In the Baltic Charter we underscored our common interest in Russia's continued democratic development. Today we can support the forces of positive change in Russia by reaching out to that country in the same ways that the countries of the region are reaching out to each other. We regard expanded cooperation with Russia in this region as useful and productive--as long, of course, as it takes place within a framework of mutual respect for the sovereignty and independence of all nations, large and small. Working with the Baltic states, our goal is to convince Russia to see the Baltic states not as a zone of influence, not as a pathway for invading armies nor a buffer against non-existent enemies, but as a gateway outward to the new Europe of which Russia seeks to be an increasingly active part. Mr. Chairman, Northern Europe is an area where we can showcase our strategy of creating a ``win-win'' situation in the new Europe. Recently the Economist referred to this region as undergoing a ``Baltic Revolution''--a tide of reform and integration that has made this region one of Europe's most promising. Last September in Norway, this Administration launched a Northern European Initiative (NEI) to participate in and promote these positive trends. This is a region that includes some of our closest allies. While time does not permit me to detail our policy efforts in this area, I would like to note for the record that our working relations with the Nordic countries have become especially close in recent years. Our NEI consists of three tracks. The first is to help Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania help themselves become the strongest possible candidates for Western integration. A top priority has been to work together with other like-minded countries and to leverage our own efforts with those of other ``Friends of the Balts'' who share our vision and our goals. The second track is to build on the excellent ties and cooperation we enjoy with the Nordic countries on Baltic issues and to expand such cooperation with other actors in the region such as Germany, Poland and the European Union. Our objective is to form a broad based coalition of countries committed to working together to build democracy, prosperity and security in the region. The third and final track is to implement the kind of inclusive policy toward Russia I described earlier. As a result, we have stepped up our efforts to promote democracy, prosperity and security in the region by becoming involved in regional structures such as the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS), the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC) as well as the Arctic Council, each of which provides an effective forum for working alongside all nations in the region, including Russia, on a host of economic, social, and environmental issues. Conclusion Mr. Chairman, achieving our goals will be far from quick or easy. But we have a common set of objectives and, increasingly, a shared strategy. Moreover, we are all impressed and filled with admiration at how much the countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have accomplished in the short time since regaining their independence. Thank you. Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I wanted to give my colleague, Senator Biden, a chance for him to make an opening statement, but I want to do it first by singing his praises, because when the U.S. Senate took up the issue of NATO enlargement some of my colleagues made comments that, well, frankly, in light of history were rather offensive. Senator Biden, with great emotion and a lot of noise and a lot of feeling responded as truly a friend and a champion of the Baltic countries, so with that, I give you my colleague. Senator Biden. Well, thank you very much. Being educated to try cases, I was told if the witness said what you want, don't ask any questions, so I will put my opening statement in the record and wait for questions. I just would comment, though, that we have before us, I think, one of the most innovative members of the State Department. I have had a chance to work with him on other matters. He is what I think career diplomats should be. He knows the party line, follows what his President suggests, but is not at all timid in suggesting to the administration and to those who will listen innovative approaches to deal with problems. I am happy he is here. I know from my staff two of the three public witnesses who are going to testify, and we could not have a better panel to follow in terms of expertise on the Baltic states, and so I am anxious to hear the panel. [The prepared statement of Senator Biden follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend you for having scheduled this hearing. Too often the smaller countries of Europe are neglected up here. Moreover, as we all know, we tend to hold hearings in response to crises, rather than regularly reviewing important issues and countries. But today we will examine Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--three small countries that, fortunately, are not in crisis. The Baltic states remind me of the ``small is beautiful'' dictum. But not only attractive, they are also important to this country. They are important because among the countries formerly under Soviet rule, the Baltic countries ranked near the top of the suffering list. Second, among the new independent states, the three Baltic countries have emerged as the most successful economically. Third, the Baltic states occupy an important piece of European real estate. And last but not least, several million Americans have ties of kinship to Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania. As an American, I am proud that for a half-century our government never yielded to pressure to recognize the illegal occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. And as an American, I am delighted at the close and friendly relationships that have developed between the United States and each of the free and independent Baltic countries. I am eager to hear the Administration's views on U.S. policy toward the Baltic area from my friend Secretary Grossman. And I am also looking forward to in-depth analyses on current conditions in the three Baltic countries from our three expert academic witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Smith. Thank you, Senator, and your comments will be included in the record. Senator Biden. Thank you for the comments. Senator Smith. Secretary Grossman, when the Iron Curtain fell, Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic made it real clear that they wanted inclusion in the West. It seems to me one of the conspicuous ways they did that was to change their laws with respect to visas, so they did not even require a visa of Americans. That led to lots of exchanges and lots of goodwill and helped to build a political constituency for their inclusion in this country. I wonder if you can comment about whether this is being done in the Baltics, and I do not want to set you up, but you know my frustration currently with the numbers of calls we receive from businessmen, from Baptist religious workers, from Mormon missionaries who have been expelled under visa requirements seemingly designed more to keep out spies than people of goodwill bringing capital or a religious message. Can you comment on the status and what, if anything--how can we respond, as U.S. Senators, to encourage the kind of openness these other new members of NATO have shown so that we can help these countries help themselves be included in the West? Mr. Grossman. Thank you very much. Before I answer that, if I might just thank Senator Biden for his kindness. We do the very best we can. Senator, let me say, as you and I have talked about this subject before, that I believe your philosophy--your first few sentences are one, exactly, that we share. We think that openness, inclusion, integration, welcoming people whether they are Americans or Europeans, or they are missionaries or business people, is all part and parcel of becoming part of the West, so I could not agree with you more that our common objective ought to be seeking the kinds of visa regimes and other regimes in countries that are open and transparent, and allow our citizens to travel back and forth. In the specific case that you mention, Estonia, if I could I would just make three points. One is that we understand that Estonia enacted new visa legislation in January which does restrict the ability of U.S. missionaries and business people to stay for longer than 90 days in any 6-month period and, in fact, our embassy in Tallinn was the very first group to alert Americans to this problem and are working very closely with American citizens in this regard. We have had a conversation, actually a number of conversations with the Estonian Government about this, and they assure us that the effect of this law on missionaries and business people was inadvertent, and what we said in response is, it is very important that they understand that people who are there to do business, are there on legitimate, international business, should not be subject to a restrictive visa regime because, as you say, it is a very important part of integrating into new European structures. I can report to you that Strobe Talbott, who was in the Baltic States last week, made this a very specific point of his presentation, and we have repeatedly urged the Government of Estonia to interpret its legislation as broadly as possible and to see if they cannot find some way, or establish a special visa category to deal with some of these concerns. I think the fact that you have raised this with me here in this hearing, the fact that we have tried to do some work, will alert people to this concern, and we need to continue to work together on it. Senator Smith. My first message to Estonia and the other countries, specifically Estonia is, I am their friend. I want to help and I want to be their champion on these issues that are so important to their security and their inclusion in the West, but it is hard. It is very difficult when Americans are not, frankly--are not very welcome in some circumstances. So if you can counsel us, if you see us stepping beyond the line or whatever, as their friends, to make these changes--we respect that they are a sovereign nation and can make laws, but I think that kind of openness and exchange are sort of a predicate for making much progress on much larger issues like inclusion in NATO. So enough said about that. I recall from a history lesson that in 1939 Stalin and Hitler signed a pact that essentially annexed the Baltic countries to the Soviet Union. Has that ever been renounced in Russia? Mr. Grossman. I do not believe so, Senator. Senator Smith. Is there any effort to renounce that? What is the status of that? Is that sort of seen as gone with Russia, or with the Soviet Union? Does anyone in Russia regard that now--in their Government, do they regard these countries as part of a deal they made? Mr. Grossman. Well, of course, I mean, our perspective is, we have to speak for ourselves, and this was, it seems to me, one of the single most important and steadfast policies of the U.S. Government for many, many years. I think both the Senate and the House and the administration, we can all be proud of the fact that we never recognized the forceful integration of those countries into the Soviet Union, and I think that is an important thing to remember. I really cannot speak on behalf of the Russians today. Actually, I met a gentleman here just before the hearing from the Baltic-American Freedom League who talked to me about this and said that they had sent some letters around. I have not seen the letter about renouncing this pact. It is something we would be certainly interested in looking at. From my perspective, I think the most important thing that we can do now is see if we can encourage this win-win attitude in the area, and that is, see if we cannot include the Russians, find ways to work with Northwest Russia, help the clean up of some of the environmental and other areas. So we have had a principled policy for a long time. We really cannot speak on behalf of anybody else. As I said, I would be glad to look at any recommendations, but we want to be, as we say, the champions of integration here. Senator Smith. Well, maybe it is all just so much of a sad history, but I wonder if President Clinton is planning in his meetings with President Yeltsin any discussion of the Baltics, and this relationship we are trying to forge with them. Obviously, we care about Russia's feelings, but we do not acknowledge any claim on those countries, sovereign countries. Do you know if this will be part of the agenda, and what will likely be said? Mr. Grossman. Well, I am sure that the President will be prepared to talk about our strategy in Northeast Europe. It is a natural thing to talk about, precisely because it involves, and we hope it involves in a positive way, Northwest Russia. So I would think that on a list of issues--and obviously I cannot speak for the President and have not seen his agenda, but I would think that he would want to and we would want to highlight the importance of our relationship with the Baltic States, what we are doing in Northeastern Europe, and how this can positively affect Russia and Russia's interest in the area. Senator Smith. Senator Biden. Senator Biden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow up on your first question and put it in a little bit of context with the Secretary, who I know knows the nuanced portion of what I am about to ask. The chairman and I just had the honor of hosting a luncheon for the President of Romania. Romania badly wants to be included in the second, as you foreign policy types say, tranche. I call it second round. Mr. Grossman. We will call it second round. Senator Biden. Second round, good. I am glad, because those of us who deal in foreign policy attach phrases to our actions that make us sound more important than we are. The things we do are quite frankly less complicated than working out HCFA at HHS, but we think they are more important and we act very important about it. At any rate, the second round, and I have been impressed over the last 2 years how very sophisticated and sensitive Romania and Romanian Americans have been about what they believe would appeal to Western Europe and to the United States in looking more favorably on their candidacy. For example, had the present President of Romania not taken the initiative relative to the Hungarian minority in his country there would be no possibility, none--zero, none--of Romania's being included in the second round, third round, fourth round, fifth round, any round. Romanian Americans know that as well--and I will not go into details, because today's was a private lunch, but the president, demonstrating to all Senators of both parties the degree of sophistication that they had in terms of companies with whom they deal, and how they deal, and what they are doing. I do have a deep emotional attachment to the idea of the complete, total, de facto and de jure and independence of the Baltic States. What the chairman was referencing was that I was mildly outraged on the Senate floor when one of my colleagues referenced the relationship of the Baltic States to Russia in a way that absolutely ignored history. But I am dismayed, as well as the chairman, as to some of the things that the Baltic-American community and the Baltic States fail to understand they are going to have to do to get my colleagues to arrive at the point that he and I have arrived at about Baltic membership. The EU, I am told, has already told Estonia that unless they can figure out a way to more fully integrate Russian- speaking minority within the community, they are going to have a problem getting into the EU. If the EU, which is usually brain dead on matters relating to those kinds of sensitivities--and you can tell I am not a diplomat, I am a Senator--if they understand that, can you imagine what it would be here in the United States? So my question is, those of us who are supporters, when we say things like the chairman said, are we viewed as interfering with sovereignty? Are we viewed as trying to have the heavy hand of the United States of America dictate, or are we viewed in the way we mean it, that it is very important to understand the sensibilities Americans have about matters of that kind when we are asking American taxpayers to spend a lot more money to integrate a part of the world into the alliance? Most Americans are not going to sleep more easily knowing Estonia is a member of NATO, or for that matter that a large country like Poland is a member of NATO. Maybe they should, but they do not think of it that way. So could you, a man who has been around on these issues, try to explain to me, in layman's terms, why NATO enlargement to include the Baltic states is worth it. Unless I can go home in southern Delaware, where not a single Baltic-American lives, and explain to them why it is important--why it is important that their taxes go up to enhance their security and meet, in my view, a historical moral obligation, unless they can accept that, it is not going to happen. It is not going to happen. So I just wonder if you could just talk to me a little bit, just as if we were in a town meeting. I mean, tell me, how would you explain to the people at a town meeting in Portland, Oregon, or Wilmington, Delaware, what is the thinking? What is going on? Please let me say one other thing for the record. I am not suggesting there is any gross violation of human rights in any of the three countries. I am not suggesting that there is a motivation to exclude people. I am suggesting that there is an image problem. There really is an image problem. That is not very focused now, because nothing is being asked, but it will become center stage if and when we get to the point that I think we agree the chairman would like to see us get to relative to admission of the Baltic States, all three, into NATO. Just talk to me a little bit, because you are good at this. Mr. Grossman. Well, thank you very much, Senator. Let me just try to talk to you. We will just leave aside as much of the diplospeak as we possibly can. I think the answer to your question, are we heavy handed-- the answer is no. Senator Biden. Are we perceived as heavy handed? Mr. Grossman. No, that's what I mean. Are we perceived as heavy handed? I think the answer to that ought to be no. I mean, whether people perceive us that way or not, I do not know. You have, as a United States Senator, it seems to me, an absolute right to raise very important issues that are important not only to you, Senator Smith in terms of visas, but also to your constituents, because those are the questions you have to answer in Delaware. Senator Biden. We do not stay here unless our constituents get responded to. Mr. Grossman. Yes, exactly right. Senator Biden. We are their hire. Mr. Grossman. Right, and that's exactly the point, so I say no, I do not think that we ought to be perceived as heavy handed. We ought to be perceived, and this--I put us both on the same team. We ought to be perceived as doing exactly what we all want, which is what, which is to be champions of integration of these three countries. We ought to be perceived as exactly what we are, which is helping Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia be the best possible candidates to walk through the open door, and I think the practical answer to your question, Senator, is, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I mean, do you look back now and think that anybody perceived us as being heavy handed to try to move forward reform efforts in the Czech Republic, or Poland, or Hungary? No. Senator Biden. Poland basically came and said, would you like us to stand on our head? Would you like us to do cartwheels? What would you like us to do? I mean, what is it we have to do to prove this? Mr. Grossman. I think that is the answer to your question. One of the more--and again, like you, I do not want to sort of give out great diplomatic secrets about private conversations, but one of the things that really struck me at the meeting between the Polish prime minister and Secretary Albright last Friday was the Polish prime minister talking to the Secretary about all the things that Poland could do to export security outside of Poland, what could we do in this area, what could we do in that area, how can we help you, and I think that is what we are after. The answer to your question is, you ought to have standards. You ought to try to keep people to certain standards. It is, after all, our alliance. The President has to make a decision The Senate has to make a decision, and just like you did, you have to vote and discuss these things, and you ought to also have a plan, in my view, Senator, is--I know this is sort of hard to read--but this is our plan. This is my long answer to your question, which is, if we can do these things in the economic area and security area, the political area, and we can do them with the Baltic States, with the Nordics, to the extent possible with Russia, then when the time comes, when we have made them the best possible candidates and they can walk through that door, just like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, no one is going to remember that you were perceived as heavy handed. People are going to remember that you set good standards, you had a plan, people achieved them, and you got the right result. Senator Biden. For the record, if any group of nations from a moral or security standpoint warrants being in NATO, I cannot think of any three nations that meet these criteria more than the Balts, the Baltic nations, so I am looking forward to working with the leadership of each of those countries, and they have been very forthcoming, by the way. Because I think the day, God willing, and as they say in southern Delaware, and the crick not rising, the day is going to come sooner than later, I hope, when we are voting on it before the U.S. Senate. At any rate, I thank you. My time is up. I thank the chairman. Senator Smith. Mr. Secretary, to what degree is the tension between the Baltic States and Russia a product of one versus the other, and does Russia understand that maintaining that tension is a way to frustrate NATO membership for the Baltics? How do we avoid holding the Baltics responsible for problems emanating from Moscow? Mr. Grossman. Well, I think our objective, Senator, as I said, is to try to create as much as we can a kind of win-win philosophy out there, which is, if we can do some business with Russia, Northwest Russia, for example, on cleaning up nuclear waste, work on nuclear safety, and do that with the Baltic States, with the Nordic States, that is a plus, and our objective over time is to make this, as I say, a positive for everybody. Now, when things are hard, though--I do not want to be misunderstood. For example, when the Russians, for example, talk about economic pressure on Latvia, we want to be real clear, as we were at the time and would be again, that that is not acceptable and, worse, we think it is counterproductive. It does not work. So our dialog with Russia on this ought to be of two parts, which is to say, there are a lot of positives out there, and things you can do and things we can do together that ought to be good for everybody, but there is a line--economic sanctions, or economic pressure--that you should not cross, and we have not been slow to say that, and we have not been afraid to say that. Senator Smith. Is there blame on both sides? Mr. Grossman. Well, I think blame is--I do no know about the blame game. One of the things that we have said all along, and I have said in my testimony, is in countries like Latvia, for example, Latvia has to work hard to deal with its Russian- speaking minority, and that is why I made such a point in my testimony of drawing attention to the OSCE standards. You had Max Van der Stoel, their representative go and give a list of the kinds of things that needed to be done, and I was really lucky. I happened to be representing the United States at the Council of Baltic Sea States on 22 June when the Latvian parliament voted in favor of the two most important of these changes, and I had the good fortune to talk about it there, congratulate the Latvian foreign minister--Mr. Primakov was there as well--and we had a chance to really talk about these things. The Estonians, for example, of the 30 recommendations that the OSCE have given, they have completed 29 of them, and the thirtieth one is due for a vote by their parliament in September. It is one of the reasons, as I said in my testimony, that we are supporting this Riga Law School, because people ought to be able to go, people of all kinds of languages and backgrounds ought to go to law school and be able to defend themselves and protect their legal rights. So I sort of pass on that, but what we want to do is encourage people, as Senator Biden said, to live up to a certain set of standards. Senator Biden. Can I ask one question, Mr. Chairman? Senator Smith. Yes. Senator Biden. And you can pass on this question if you like, but the next panel cannot. They can, but I hope they will not, and it might not be able to be answered with any degree of certainty. In your view, if in each of the Baltic States, their leadership were told tomorrow they could join right now either the EU or NATO, but only one, which would they choose, in your view--Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia. What would you guess? If you do not have a view, or you would rather not express it---- Mr. Grossman. I do not have any idea. I mean, I pass. I have not thought about that one, and I do not know how to answer the question. Senator Biden. The reason I ask the question, I hope, is obvious. One of the things that is said, including today in the speech by the President of Romania on the floor of the U.S. Congress in a joint session, and was also the thing that was said to me in my visits to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia and a number of other places I have been recently, was that this is a heck of a lot less about security and feeling any direct threat from Russia or any former Warsaw Pact member, than it is about being integrated into the West, and NATO is a guaranteed anchor. Once in NATO, you are in the West. You have all the benefits that flow from that, including an economic advantage that grows out of a perceived sense of being not vulnerable to outside influence. So, I just wondered how, in your view, it might be viewed by the Baltic countries, or if it may be viewed differently in each country. I am not lumping them all together. Mr. Grossman. I think I would pass on your bigger question, but I think it is an important point that you make, which is to say, there is this question that integrating with the West is the big security, capital S, if you will, and I think that the days are long gone when you could kind of worry about your military security on Monday and Tuesday and democracy on Wednesday and Thursday, and your economy on Friday and Saturday. Things are simultaneous today, and that is why, it seems to me, people want to be a part of what we are doing. You say that they want to integrate with the West. I think the reason that people want to integrate is values and security, and one of the reasons we have chosen to do some political things, economic things, and some security things is that it is the whole package. When we talk about champion of integration, that is really what we mean. It seems to me that the more integrated you are, the more secure you are. Senator Biden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Smith. I share your observation, Senator Biden. As we have dealt with these countries of the former Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, their first desire is for security and then prosperity, and I think that is a human motive that all of us can understand. Being rich does not make you safe. You need to be safe. I have been amazed at that. Senator Biden. One of the ironies is, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize for our dialog here, but one of the ironies, it seems to me, for the witnesses, is that the more any one of the countries seeking admission to NATO--from the Balkans to the Baltics--talks about the political and economic security that flows from being a member of NATO, the more fodder it gives to those who do not want to see NATO expanded to say that we are turning this from a military allinace into a political institution. It has always been a political institution, but it is hard to get that point through. That is why I just wondered if you had a sense of what the driving motivation was, if it could be identified in any one of those countries, just for my own insight. I thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Smith. Mr. Secretary, thank you for answering our questions. We are grateful for your contribution to our desire to bring the Baltic countries into the western sphere. Mr. Grossman. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Senator Smith. We will now call up our second panel, Dr. Krickus, Dr. Plakans, and Dr. Raun. Senator Smith. Gentlemen, we welcome you. We are going to include into the record--I request unanimous consent, myself and my colleague--testimony from the Lithuanian-American community. The statement of the Central and East European Coalition, and the Joint Baltic-American National Committee. We are pleased to receive your comments and they will be part of the record. [The material referred to appears in the appendix.] Senator Smith. Let us begin, Dr. Krickus, with you. Welcome. STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD J. KRICKUS, DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE, FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA Dr. Krickus. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I welcome the opportunity to share with you my observations on Lithuania and American foreign policy priorities. For several years the administration and Members of Congress have said that the door to NATO is open to the Baltic democracies. The time has come to live up to that promise and accelerate it by extending membership to Lithuania. In much the same fashion that Estonia has earned the right to be the first of the three Baltic democracies to enter the EU, Lithuania has earned the right to enter NATO first. Through this step-by-step process, NATO membership for Estonia and Latvia will be facilitated. Providing membership to the Baltic democracies is consistent with two major American foreign policy objectives in post cold war Europe. The first is safe-guarding the zone of democracy which has appeared with the collapse of the Soviet empire. This is one of NATO's fundamental missions. An enlargement advances that goal. Second, while NATO moves eastward, Russia must be integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Opponents of the Baltic democracies in NATO claim they are not a vital U.S. interest and cannot make a military contribution to the alliance. To include them in NATO is to needlessly provoke Russia. There is no threat that justifies their membership at this time. Should one materialize, then we can waive them in. The above arguments are made by serious people, and they cannot be blithely ignored, but all of them have their roots in fears and ideas driven by the cold war, not today's world. Safeguarding democracy in Europe and empowering people who share our values is a vital interest. The West has the capacity to field many divisions armed with the most advanced weapons, but we do not know how to establish stable democracies. The most extensive military contributions that the Baltic countries can conceivably make to NATO is vastly less important than the advantages that flow from having viable democracies in the heartland of Europe. The most serious security problem that Russia faces is economic turmoil at home, which is linked to the failure of the economic oligarchs and the rich to pay their taxes. Russia's principal military threat is in the Caucasus, in the territories of the former Soviet Central Asian States, and in the long-term, China. It is in Russia's vital interest, then, to have good relations with an alliance of stable democracies on its European flank. Instability and the resurrection of antidemocratic movements in the heartland of Europe could have a pernicious impact on the ability of Germany and Russia to develop a relationship that is beneficial and nonthreatening to both States. Russian defense analysts are not happy with NATO enlargement, but they do not believe NATO represents a military threat to them. The disintegration of their armed forces and weapons systems have forced them to dwell upon real, not imagined threat to their security. For the Russian people, it is economic destitution that preoccupies them. They do not care about the Balts getting into NATO. Finally, the greatest threat to stability in Europe today is the upheaval promulgated by the transition from communism to an open society. Coping with this threat is NATO's most challenging mission. The prospects that neo-Soviets and ultranationalists will exploit Russia's daunting problems to gain power is a threat to all of Russia's neighbors. That is why the Baltic countries want to find a safe harbor in NATO. Their major worry is not a strike across their borders, but the turmoil that is wreaking havoc to their east. Today, President Yeltsin is talking about a coups d'etat, and his opponents are threatening to sweep his prime minister from power and to replace the Government with an emergency committee. Does that constitute a sufficient threat to honor our pledge and bring the Balts into the alliance? I think it does. Lithuania, as a recent Department of Defense report indicates, is the best qualified of the Baltic countries to enter NATO. It has the largest number of troops under arms, and it has made the largest contribution of resources to its armed forces. For example, in 2 years Lithuania intends to spend 2 percent of its GDP on defense. By contrast, Germany today spends a lesser percentage of its GDP on its armed forces. All of Lithuania's major political parties and a plurality of its people want to join NATO. As Poland's neighbor, Lithuania is contiguous to a State soon to be a member of the alliance. Lithuania has moved further toward democratization than any of the 15 former Soviet republics. It has a stable party system. It has conducted several fair and open legislative and Presidential elections. It has a liberal citizenship law and, as Freedom House has indicated, it has the freest press of all the former communist lands of Europe. The second major foreign policy objective in Europe is to integrate Russia into the Europe-Atlantic community. This is not likely to happen in one great leap, but through a series of small steps. I have just returned from a visit to Moscow and to Kaliningrad, and I would agree with many Russian and western observers that the exclave may serve as a test case for Russian-western cooperation. There has been a dramatic decline in the number of troops that are stationed in the Oblast. U.S. forces say they constitute about 23,000, while the Poles say 40,000 troops remain in Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad's neighbors may argue that the number is too high, but they all concede that the downsizing is good news and are less concerned about the militarization issue than even a year ago. Russian defense analysts claim that economic pressures alone are not responsible for the shrinkage. There is a second reason for it. They do not believe that the exclave is defensible. Note that they are making this claim even prior to Poland's becoming an active member of NATO. Moving NATO eastward has no bearing on Kaliningrad's security, nor Russia, for that matter. Some Russian commentators may continue to threaten to deploy nukes in Kaliningrad, but no serious security analyst in Moscow is thinking in these terms today. Meanwhile, Russian fears that western militarization and economic development proposals are meant to deny Russia control of the Oblast have declined as well. No Government in the region, German, Lithuanian, or Polish, challenges Russian control of Kaliningrad. EU experts I spoke to in Kaliningrad, however, fear the Oblast could become a black hole in the Baltic Sea region and, because of a deteriorating economic and social situation there, threaten stability in the Baltic Sea. They are recommending the EU go beyond the provision of technical assistance and provide the Oblast with capital development funds as well. It is my understanding that the U.S. Government does not intend to play a major role in economic development programs and other initiatives designed to stabilize the situation in Kaliningrad, but it can play an important supportive role. Through cooperative Russian-western programs in Kaliningrad, we may determine how joint efforts can help the Russian Federal resolve its economic, social, and ecological problems and build a free market economy. Of course, at some future time, when hard security questions reemerge, perhaps with the development of U.S. infrastructure installations in Poland, or as a result of reassessment of CFE, the American role in resolving the Kaliningrad question may take on greater and different dimensions. Through its quiet diplomacy and the investment of its entrepreneurs, Lithuania is contributing to the development of Kaliningrad and the recent visit of Russian foreign minister Primakov to Lithuania testifies to the warm relations that Vilnius and Moscow enjoy. As President Adamkus has recently indicated, he sees no problem that the constructive relations with Russia will be jeopardized by Lithuania's bid for NATO membership. Remember, in Article II of the 1990 treaty between Lithuania and Soviet Russia, both sides agreed to the following, quote, the high contracting parties recognize each other's right to independently realize their sovereignty in the area of defense and security in ways they find acceptable, unquote. Finally, from the vantage point of the United States, the following should be kept in mind: By including the Baltic democracies in NATO and striving to address Moscow's legitimate security concerns, the West can safeguard democracy in the heart of Europe. This objective is in the interests of the West, the former Soviet republics, and a democratic Russia as well. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Krickus follows:] Prepared Statement of Richard J. Krickus Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I welcome the opportunity to share with you my observations on Lithuania and U.S. foreign policy priorities. For several years the administration and members of Congress have said that the door to NATO is open to the Baltic democracies. The time has come to live up to that promise and accelerate it by extending membership to Lithuania. In much the same fashion that Estonia has earned the right to be the first of the three Baltic democracies to enter the EU, Lithuania has earned the right to enter NATO first. Through this step-by-step process, NATO membership for Estonia and Latvia will be facilitated. To provide justification for this initiative a little historical background is required. Estonia and Latvia were the first of the 15 Soviet Republic to form grass-roots movements which Mikhail Gorbachev believed would provide momentum for Perestroika. Lithuania followed their lead and in March 1990 restored the Lithuanian state which had been forcefully annexed into the Soviet Union in 1940. Recognizing that the Lithuanian rebellion represented a threat to the USSR, Gorbachev sought to crush it. On January 13, 1991 a massacre took place at a TV tower in Vilnius but through peaceful resistance the Lithuanian people prevailed and saved their independent government. What became known as Bloody Sunday set into motion events which led to the August 1991 coup and the collapse of the Soviet Empire in December of that year. No longer deeming Gorbachev their leader, the democrats embraced Boris Yeltsin. Gorbachev then agreed to a new union treaty which when implemented would drain power from the hard-liners in Moscow and pave the way for Baltic secession from the union. It was this prospect which led to the neo-Stalinist Putsch of August 1991. But events in Lithuania revitalized a badly demoralized Russian democratic movement and provided the Yeltsimtes with lessons to abort the August Putsch. The commander of the KGB Alpha unit which was responsible for Bloody Sunday later explained why his men did not attack the Russian White House in August. An attack which certainty would have crushed the democratic activists who gathered there. ``Vilnius was the last straw and our patience ran out. ... Honestly, had it not been for Vilnius we would not have refused to storm the White House.'' Democrats everywhere, Americans, Europeans and Russian owe a debt of gratitude to the Baltic peoples for helping end the Cold War. During that period about 100,000 Americans were killed in combat and three times that number were wounded in battle at a cost of billions of dollars to the national treasury. This awesome sacrifice has provided millions of Europeans with the prospect of living in open societies and to enjoy the fruits of a free enterprise economy. We must not deny them that prospect in the aftermath of the Cold War less those sacrifices be made in vain. Providing NATO membership to the Baltic democracies is consistent with two major American foreign policy objectives in post-Cold War Europe. The first is safeguarding the zone of democracy which has appeared with the collapse of the Soviet Empire. This is one of NATO's fundamental missions and enlargement advances that goal. Second, while NATO moves eastward, Russia must be integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Opponents of including the Baltic democracies in NATO claim: They are not a vital U.S. interest and cannot make a military contribution to the alliance. To include them in NATO is to needlessly provoke Russia. There is no threat that justifies their membership at this time. Should one materialize, then they can be waved in. The above arguments are made by serious people and they cannot be blithely ignored but all of them have their roots in fears and ideas driven by the Cold War era, not today's world. Safeguarding democracy in Europe and empowering people who share our values is a vital interest.

The disintegration in their armed forces and weapons systems have forced them to dwell upon real not imagined threats to their security. For the Russian people it is economic destitution that preoccupies them, they don't care about the Baits getting into NATO. Finally, the greatest threat to stability in Europe today is the upheaval promulgated by the transition from communism to an open society. Coping with this threat is NATO's most challenging mission. The prospects that neo-Soviets and ultra-nationalists will exploit Russia's daunting problems to regain power is a threat to all of Russia's neighbors.

Note that they are making this claim even prior to Poland's becoming an active member of NATO. Moving NATO eastward has no real bearing on Kaliningrad's security nor Russia for that matter. Some Russian commentators may continue to threaten to deploy nukes in Kalmingrad but no serious security analyst in Moscow is thinking in these terms today. Meanwhile, Russian fears that Western demilitarization and economic development proposals are meant to deny Russian control of the Oblast have declined as well. No government in the region, German, Lithuanian or Polish challenges Russian control of Kaliningrad.

Through its quiet diplomacy and the investment of its entrepreneurs, Lithuania is contributing to the development of Kaliningrad. And the recent visit of Russian Foreign Minister Gennadi Priinakov to Lithuania testifies to the warm relations that Vilnius and Moscow enjoy. As President Valdas Adainkus has recently indicated, he sees no problem that constructive relations with Russia will be jeopardized by Lithuania's bid for NATO membership. Remember in Article 2 of the 1991 treaty between Lithuania and Soviet Russia both sides agreed to the following: ``The High Contracting Parties recognize each other's right to independently realize their sovereignty in the area of defense and security in ways they find acceptable...'' From the vantage-point of the United States, the following should be kept in mind.

This objective is in the interest of the West, the former Soviet republics and a democratic Russia as well. Senator Smith. Thank you very much, doctor. Dr. Plakans. STATEMENT OF DR. ANDREJS PLAKANS, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY, AMES, IA Dr. Plakans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a longer statement that is submitted for the record. The shorter statement is basically a precis of that and I am going to be talking about Latvia, and I will be addressing the question of what has been done in the last 7 years since 1991 and what remains to be done and, given the time shortage, I am going to be talking more in my oral statement about the unfinished business of Latvia. As I see it, there are six areas in which the Latvian State has unfinished business. The first of these is the large proportion of the stateless inhabitants of Latvia, which constitute at this moment about 27.1 percent of the total population. This is of a population of 2.47 million. This situation, of course, as is known, grew out of the Soviet policy that reduced the indigenous Latvian population to about 52 percent of the total in the 1989 census and reduced Latvians to a minority status in seven out of the eight largest cities by that same date. This is a policy which most Latvians in Latvia perceive as having been deliberate russification of their country. The fear of national extinction has been part of Latvian thinking for a very long time, and it now informs the citizenship debate within Latvia. This fear, however, directly conflicts with another desired goal, the wish to join pan- European institutions and other international institutions. This requires careful negotiation for the expectations of all parties, the European institutions, the U.S., Latvians, and the stateless inhabitants of Latvia, to be reconciled. Unfinished business number 2 in my view involves the question of a strong central Government. By contrast with the stated goal of creating a vital private sector, the national Government in Latvia remains central to virtually every aspect of Latvian affairs. There are historical trends at work here. In the 1920's, immediately after the acquisition of the sfirst independence, there was only one institution, the new national Government, that could mobilize the population and resources for the necessary tasks of State-building. The Soviet period, of course, enhanced the role of the central Government and central planning beyond anything the pre-1940 republic contained. This very strong and continuing sense of dependence on the central Government in Latvia explains, I think, in large part why the cultivation of private initiative, the creation and maintenance of NGO's, and other appurtenances of a healthy private sector has been so problematic in Latvia and continues, in my view, to be problematic. The third area of unfinished business involves demography, demographic indicators. In every year since 1991, the total population of the country, of Latvia, has fallen by a few percentage points, thus diminishing from 2.6 million in 1991 to 2.4 million in 1997, due in large part Sto the immigration or re-migration of the Slavic language population. Moreover, during every year since 1993, the proportion of the older, past-working-age population has increased relative to the younger, before-working-age population. The fertility rate in the country has declined since 1991 in every age category. The number of abortions has increased from 128 per 100 births in 1991 to 148 in 1996. Senator Biden. Excuse me, doctor, 128 versus 100? Dr. Plakans. 128 abortions per every 100 births, live and still births, to 148 now. Senator Biden. So almost 50 percent more fetuses are aborted than taken to term. Dr. Plakans. The life expectancy at birth for both men, which is now 63.9 years in 1996, and women, 75.6 in 1996, has declined since 1991 at a somewhat more rapid rate than in other post communist societies. In short, the Latvian population is not replacing itself, and its slowly diminishing numbers are aging. In absolute numbers, there were more Latvians in Latvia in 1935, 1.46 million, than there were in 1996, 1.37 million, which is a drop of about 6.1 percent. These demographic characteristics are a source of no small worry to the Latvian Government, which has to think in terms of tax revenues, the labor supply, army recruitment, and the like, and they certainly feed the fear of national extinction in the general population. A fourth area of unfinished business concerns the law-based State. An immense amount of rapid practical thinking was needed in the period from 1990 to 1991, when separation from the U.S.S.R. Became a possibility, about how to transform Latvia from a Soviet republic in which law was frequently overridden by the Communist Party, to a State in which law was paramount and equal for all. The process of revising and adapting the 1922 constitution has been going on since 1991. The Latvians actually renewed the 1922 constitution rather than writing a new one, and this process of revision and adaptation continues at this writing. In fact, the difficulties encountered in all of this have led President Guntis Ulmanis to reflect recently that perhaps an entirely new constitution is needed, and this thought appears to be supported by about 52 percent of the population, according to latest opinion polls. Legal reform has involved primarily the extrication of the country's legal system from the now-defunct Soviet system, with one additional complication. Latvia's desire to become integrated with western, especially Western European, institutions, has meant that basic laws, as well as parliamentary legislation, has had to be coordinated with western codes and legal ideas, especially with such relatively new and somewhat mysterious matters as human rights. While the trajectory toward a law-based State is clearly present in Latvia, the time needed for this task has been much longer than anyone had expected. The fifth area of unfinished business involves political democratization. During the past 6 years there have been two peaceful parliamentary elections, 1993 and 1995, and a third will take place in October of this year. In both 1993 and 1995 voter participation was substantially above the 65 percent mark. There have been two rounds of municipal local elections in 1994 and 1997 and a single president head of State who was elected by the parliament in 1993 and reelected in 1995. Five prime ministers have headed cabinets during these years, and in each parliamentary election "
