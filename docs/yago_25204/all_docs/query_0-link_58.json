During this time, she also became the mistress of Sforza. In 1497, she gave birth to his son, Giovanni Paolo.[4] Sforza's affair with Crivelli caused much distress to his wife, who was considered accomplished and cultured. Upon learning of the affair, d'Este tried without success to have Crivelli banished from court.",
