        "text": "Author: * Leonora da Vinci - 4 on this thread out of 10 sitewide.\n\nDate: Dec 16, 2011 - 22:52\n\nBeatrice d'Este (1475-1497), as painted by Leonardo da Vinci and Ambroglio de Predis to commemorate her marriage in January 1490 at age 15 to the rich and powerful ruler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, age 38, to whom she had been betrothed since she was 5.\n\nIt was a double d'Este-Sforza wedding to ally the two families' kingdoms of Ferarra and Milan. So while Beatrice was marrying Lodovico, her 15-year-old brother, Alfonso d'Este, was marrrying Anna Sforza, Lodovico's 15-year-old niece and the sister of his nephew, the young duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza. He died four years later in 1494, probably poisoned by Ludovico in a plot to replace him as Duke of Milan. See \"Renaissance Milan\" for more details, including an aerial view of the rambling Sforza castle.\n\nLodovico looked on his young wife as a joyous and fascinating child, as \"lieta di natura et molto piacevolina. And though she was known to be fashionable, cheerful, intelligent, and lovely, it's doubtful if Beatrice was lovely or clever enough to compete with Ludovico's long-time mistress, the beautiful Cecilia Galeriani. Comfortably installed in another wing of the vast Sforza castle, Cecilia appears in this famous portrait of her by Leonardo, \"The Lady of the Ermine\" (or \"Weasel\"). Standing for \"purity,\" the ermine was added to Lodovico's coat-of-arms to join the eagle and the viper. Nicknamed, \"Il Moro,\" \"The Moor,\" you see him here in a detail from a double portrait of himself and Beatrice as donors in an altarpiece to the Virgin Mary painted for the Sforza chapel about 1495 by an unknown master. Despite his brutality and infidelities, Il Moro seems to have been quite religious.\n\nFor the first year of her marriage Beatrice was blissfully unaware of her husband's affair with Cecilia. One of her constant companions was Lodovico's brilliant young swordsman and general, Galeazzo di Sanseverino. In golden armor and peacock helmet, Galeazzo had been both sponsor and star of the great tournament in her honor at her wedding, and he soon became her courtier, protector, and friend. And so, for awhile Beatrice spent her time riding or hunting about the countryside with her ladies-in-waiting, her brilliant sister Isabella, and her gallant Galeazzo. -->\n\nThen one day Beatrice heard a rumor about Cecilia's presence in the castle; she heard how often the duke was seen in her company, and was told that before many weeks were over his mistress was likely to bear him a child. When Lodovico gave his wife a vest of woven gold she refused to wear it after hearing he'd given Cecilia one just like it. At last, she put her foot down and insisted he get rid of her. Which he did! Soon after Cecilia gave birth to his son, he arranged to have her married to an old friend and count, while another, an obliging duke, gave her as a wedding gift an old palace in Milan that she lavishly redecorated and in which she lived and studied and held court for decades until, at a ripe old age, she died..\n\nHaving got rid of her rival, Beatrice now set her own course as mistress of Milan, brilliantly upstaging Cecilia in everything except a ripe old age, She surrounded herself with scholars, poets and artists like Castiglione, who wrote the famous manual on how to become the perfect \"Courtier\"; the famous architect Bramante; her resident artist and engineer, the splendid Leonardo da Vinci; and the diplomat Niccolo da Correggio, who praised her as \"the first lady of the world.\"\n\nIt wasn't just flattery. In 1492 Beatrice visited Venice as ambassador for Ludovico to get the Venetians to support his life-long dream of replacing his nephew Gian Galeazzo Sforza as Duke of Milan. When that poor fellow died in 1494 - officially of \"immoderate coitus,\" but rumor said of \"Il Moro's poison\" - Lodovico's dream was legalized. The next year, after first supporting the invasion of Naples by Charles VIII of France, and then opposing his invasion of Florence and the rest of Italy, the new Duke and Duchess of Milan took part in the peace congress between King Charles and the Italian princes, where Beatrice entranced the French King with her charms and the Italian princes with her diplomatic skills.\n\nBeatrice was also a doting mother of her two sons, Maximilan and Francesco II, seen here with their parents in this detail from an altarpiece of Mary and the infant Jesus that they donated in 1494/5 to the Church of Saint Ambrogia near Milan.\n\nThen disaster struck, twice. First, Lucrezia Crivelli, the lovely daughter of a Milanese nobleman, joined the Duke's household as one of Beatrice's ladies-in-waiting. (Was she the lady you see at right that Leonardo may have painted, called \"La Belle Ferroniere\"?) Ludovico was smittem with her, and at once made her his mistress. To add insult to injury, everyone at court talked about the affair, while the ambassador from Ferrara wrote to Isabella that her sister's husband was spending most of his time with her. At the same time, Bianca Sforza, Ludovico's illegitimate daughter by an earlier mistress, who had been married off to the dashing general Galeazzo, and whom Beatrice had adopted and loved as her own, suddenly died.\n\nDepressed by her husband's affair with Lucrezia and Bianca's death, Beatrice seemed overcome by grief. Yet, on January 1, 1497, she looked fine while driving in her chariot through the castle park and portal and waving to the people on her way to the Dominican Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, where Leonardo was painting on the refectory wall his Last Supper. There she said her devotions at Our Lady's altar, and then, kneeling at her daughter's tomb, she prayed a long time for the poor girl's soul. Back at the castle that afternoon there was dancing in her rooms - until eight at night, when suddenly she felt sick. Three hours later she gave birth to a still-born son, and half an hour after midnight she died.\n\nThe next morning Ludovico sent a letter to his brother-in-law, Isbella's husband Federico Gonzaga, to tell him the terrible news: \"My wife was taken with sudden pains at eight o'clock last night. At eleven she gave birth to a dead son, and at half-past twelve she gave back her spirit to God. This cruel and premature end has filled me with bitter and indescribable anguish, so much so that I would rather have died myself than lose the dearest and most precious thing that I had in this world.\"\n\nIn the words of Julia Cartwright, her indefatigable biographer: \"Beatrice dies, without a moment"
