        "text": "Francesco I Sforza, 1450-1466 (4th Duke of Milan)\n\n- son-in-law of the last duke of Visconti -\n\nFrancesco (1401-1466), one of many illegitimate sons of the Condottiero Muizo Attendolo from Romagna, took up his father's mercenaries just as he did his nickname \"Sforza\" (sforzare = to exert, to force). Francesco was a very efficient and successful Condottiero switching sides a number of times between the Visconti in Milan, the Pope, and Venice. Military skill and political ruse made him a prominent and influential protagonist of Italian politics.\n\nFrancesco Sforza married Bianca Maria Visconti (ca.1424-1468) in second marriage. She was the only (and illegitime) daughter of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and was betrothed to him at the age of six. The Visconti dynasty took its name from the function of a governor acting in the name of the king, lat. 'vicecomes' (Viscount). They took control of Milan in the 13th century and continued to rule until 1447, when Filippo Maria Visconti died without male issue. His son-in-law Francesco I Sforza succeeded and established the reign of the House of Sforza.\n\nAs dowery, Francesco was given Pontremoli and Cremona and the promise to succeed to the dukedom. After the death of his father-in-law, Francesco was able to oust all other claimants to the duchy by military intervention. When the short-lived Ambrosian republic (1447-1450, from St. Ambrose, patron saint of Milan) ended in riots and famine, the senate accepted him as Duke in 1450. The other Italian states followed suit, unlike the Emperor, who only granted investiture to Francesco's son in 1494.\n\nThe friendship between Francesco Sforza in Milan and Cosimo de Medici in Florence made the first Peace of Lodi (1454) possible and led to the Italian League (1455), which established and kept peace between Venice, Milan and Florence, Naples and the Pope until 1494.\n\nFrancesco was a wise ruler domestically. He modernised both city and dukedom, rebuilt the fortress Porta Giovio, introduced an efficient tax system and founded the Ospedale Maggiore. His court attracted scholars and artists and became one of the most influential centers of Renaissance culture. He was much loved by his people and on his death in 1466 he left his successor an untroubled and wealthy land.\n\nBronze about 1441 by Pisanello (Antonio di Puccio Pisano) Ø 87 mm. Kress 5; Pollard (2007) 5.\n\nSpecimen in The National Gallery of Art, Kress Collection, Washington D.C.\n\nObv.: +FRANCISCVS·SFORTIA·VICECOMES·MARCHIO·ET·COMES·AC·CREMONE·Dominus\n\nbust in armor, coat of mail and a captain's hat.\n\nRev.: OPVS·PISANI·PICTORIS - Horse's head, stack of books and sword\n\nas symbols of soldierly virtues and scholarship.\n\nThis medal is from the period shortly after Francesco's marriage to Bianca Maria Visconti (1412), sole heiress to the dukedom. Francesco had received Cremona as dowry. The medal highlights his association to the Visconti \"vicecomes\".\n\nPisanello (ca. 1395 - 1455) worked as a draftsman, painter and medaillist at several courts between Naples and Milan. He is famous for his portrait medals, which he introduced as a new Renaissance art genre. He signed his cast reliefs as a painter: \"Opus Pisani pictoris\" - manufactured by the painter Pisano. Unfortunately, his frescoes and paintings did not stand the test of time as well as his medals and their recasts did.\n\nBronze 1456, by Gian Francesco Enzola. Ø 42 mm. Arm.I 44/6; Kress 92.\n\nObv.:\n\nFRanciscus SFORTIA VICECOMES MedioLanI DVX IIII BELLI PATER ET PACIS AVTOR MCCCCLVI\n\narmored bust right between ·V· - ·F·\n\n(V F = Vivas Francise or Votum Fecit [a promise made] ?)\n\nRev.: IOannis FRancisci ENZOLAE PARMENSIS OPVS - Under a tree, a greyhound seated;\n\na hand issuing from a radiant cloud nearly touches him; a bridle with open buckle lies on the ground\n\nand is tied to the tree by chain.\n\nThis is the figure of the 'impresa' called 'cane sotta il pino' (dog under a pine), created for Bernabo Visconti (1354-85), a passionate hunter and holder of greyhounds.\n\nAn 'impesa' consists of a figure (called body) and a motto (called soul).\n\nThe motto \"QUIETUM NEMO IMPUNE LACESSIT\" (eng. 'do not tease the sleeping dog' meaning 'no impunity for attack on peace') is missing on the medal. The figure of this impresa was used on the cloak of Francesco at his wedding to Bianca Maria Visconti, as presented on the Altar-picture of San Sigismondo church in Cremona from 1441.\n\nCompare the figure on a capital at the Rocchetta courtyard in Castello Sforzesco, Milan.\n\nNote on the imagery: In the heraldics of the 15th to 16th century, it became popular throughout Italy to design personal emblems. They had to consist of a symbol illustrating an event in the person's life and an inscription with a suitable motto or 'devise'. Often, one person would use a number of different symbols. These so called 'imprese' were used alongside the family's coat of arms. The 'imprese' were considered a new genre for which a number of rules applied (s. Paolo Giovio, Dialogo dell'imprese militari et amorose, 1555). A well composed 'impresa' was to be a little enigmatic, comprehensible to the initiated but not easily accessible to the crowd. The 'imprese' are found as decoration in print, in paintings, on clothes, in gardens, on and in buildings, and on coins and medals.\n\nCompare the painting by Bonifacio Bembo (19x13,5 cm) in the Codice Triv. 786, Biblioteca Trivulziana, Milan.\n\nMultiplo del grossone n. d.

It is accompanied by the motto: 'Merito et Tempore' (it. \"per merito e con tempo\") meaning 'on merit and with time'. This 'impresa' proclaims: Francesco will clean up the duchy of all ugliness.\n\nYou find this 'impresa' also on a coin from Francesco II Sforza.\n\nThe 'scopetta' picture is from:\n\nLe 'imprese' do Ludovico il Moro alla Sforzesca di Vigevano.\n\nFrancesco I Sforza and Ferdinando I d'Aragona of Naples (1458-1494) were the first\n\nrulers to mint coins showing their lifelike portrait.\n\nMedal about 1466 by Sperandio di Mantua.

Citizens of Milan knelt in front of him and received him in 1450 when he moved in.\n\nGaleazzo Maria Sforza, 1466-1476 (5th Duke of Milan)\n\n- son of Francesco I Sforza -\n\nAfter the death of Francesco I in 1466, his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza became Duke of Milan. In 1468, Bona of Savoy, sister-in-law of King Louis VI of France, became his second wife. As Galeazzo Maria's parents were both illegitimate, his wife's royal connections were particularly important. Galeazzo Maria loved pomp and luxury and was a patron of the arts and music. But he was of tyrannical, cruel and sadistic character. In 1476, his tenth year of reign, he was murdered by three Milanese nobles in the Church of San Stefano, a day after Christmas and during mass. This spectacular murder became the model for the Pazzi Conspiracy two years later, an attack on the Medici family in Florence Cathedral.\n\n'Leone Galeato'\n\nDoppio ducato (testone d'oro, n.d., about 1469) Ø 29 mm, 6,99 g.\n\nCNI 163/5; RM 243/2; Crippa 1; Friedb.689.\n\nObv.: (head of St. Ambrose) GALEAZ·M·SFO·VICECOMES·DVX·MLI·V· - bust to the right.\n\nRev.: (Visconti snake) PAPIaE·ANGLE·Q3·CO·AC·IANVE·DNS·ӡC·\n\na lion sitting on a fire and sheathed in a helmet with crest and feather headdress; the repeated motto reads \"ICH HOF\" (German 'I hope'); firebrands with two buckets at the side.\n\nIn the field: initials Gӡ - M for Galeazzo Maria (Gӡ = GZ).\n\n[ His namesake Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1385-1402) used already the abbreviation G3, see\n\nDenaro CNI p.98 n.99 : +·COMES·VIRTVTVM· _ cross // +·D·MEDIOLANI·3C'· _ G3 ]\n\nThe legend on both sides reads:\n\n\"Galeazo Maria Sforza Viscount (Vicecomes), 5th Duke of Milan (Mediolani), Count of Pavia (Papiae),\n\nAngera (at the south end of Lake Maggiore) and (AC) Lord (Dominus) from Genoa (Ianua), etc.(ӡC=ZC)\"\n\nThe pattern of this ducato pleased the duke and he ordered 10,000 pieces in January 1469.\n\nCompare the design of the revers to the figure on a capital at the\n\nRocchetta courtyard in Castello Sforzesco, Milan.\n\nYou see on the coin and on the capital the impresa 'Leone Galeato' (eng. helmed lion). This impresa dates back to Galeazzo II Visconti (1354), who had to spend about a decade in exile in Savoy. It may be interpreted as: 'Fury will be repressed by reason as long as fate demands'. The motto was often placed in a foreign language to make it seem even more puzzling. Firebrands with two buckets were added later to this impresa.\n\nGaleazzo Maria Sforza simply took over the 'impresa' of a predecessor of the same name.\n\nCompare the portrait of the avers to a painting from 1471, 65x42 cm (Uffizi, Florence).\n\n'biscione visconteo' with crowned helmet and dragon\n\nDucato n. d.

It was used alone or together with 'Leone Galeato'. Both imprese have the same historical background.\n\n'Imprese' were designed by scholars. They were very popular in Italy and enriched the design of coins especially in Milan, Mantua and Ferrara.\n\nA well known 'impresa' of emperor Charles V shows the\n\nPillars of Hercules with the band 'PLUS ULTRA'.\n\nThe 'biscione visconteo' is the Visconti coat of arms. It is a snake or viper about to devour (or to give birth to) a human. Its significance is still under discussion. With the Visconti's rise to power in Milan, it became a symbol for the city.\n\nThe Visconti-snake probably derives from the families name (canting arms): biscione sounds like Visconti.\n\nWhen the Sforzas became Dukes of Milan, they adopted both the 'biscione visconteo' and a number of Visconti 'imprese' for their own symbol as a political statement, stressing the dynastic continuity and the legitimacy of his claim to the duchy.\n\nThis testone ('testa' = head), issued since 1474, was the first silver coin to show a lifelike Renaissance\n\nportrait of a ruler. Other rulers quickly adopted the policy as it turned coins into a means for\n\npropaganda allowing them to spread their own image and fame.\n\nCrown and arms of the Duchy\n\nMezzo testone n. d.

The impresa li 'piumai' originated at the same time. It consists of the ducal crown with inserted olive branch (symbol for peace) and palm branch (for victory), expressing best wishes for peace and prosperity. The motto is 'piu mai' (eng. 'more than ever'). Quite rightly so, because wealth and power of Milan had arrived their zenith in 1394.\n\nSt. Ambrose, the patron of the city\n\nGrosso da 8 soldi. Ø 27 mm, 3,46 g.

His mother Bona di Savoia (1449-1503) acted as regent until 1481, when she lost the power struggle with her brother-in-law Ludovico Maria Sforza, nicknamed \"Il Moro\" (the Moor). Gian Galeazzo, aged twelve, was declared of age and crowned in 1480, since when Ludovico's appropriation of power was left unchallenged and Gian Galeazzo was effectively deprived of the duchy.\n\nBona di Savoia was exiled from Milan. She continued to act as patron of the arts. She commissioned the Sforza Book of Hours, one of the finest surviving Renaissance manuscripts, by the illuminator Giovan Pietro Birago (about 1490, now in the British Library).\n\nTestone, n. d.

In 1494, the equilibrium between Venice, Milan, Florence, the pope and Napels turned instable. Ludovico and other nobles took the unwise decision to invite King Charles VIII of France to assert his claim on the Kingdom of Naples. This initiated the Italian wars (1494-1559), which started as dynastic disputes over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples and developed into a European power struggle. All parties involved changed alliances several times.\n\nThe duchy prospered under the patronage of Ludovico. He advanced the building of canals and fortifications and the development of agriculture and silk production. The patronage of Ludovico and his wife Beatrice d'Este, daughter of the duke of Ferrara, turned Milan into the most sought after court for musicians, poets, artists and scholars. Leonardo da Vinci worked for Ludovico until his downfall in 1499.\n\nKing Charles VIII of France died in 1498. His successor Louis XII upheld hereditary claims to Milan and Naples, invaded Italy in 1499 and his superior army took Naples, Genoa, and Milan. Ludovico was able to escape and sought support from the emperor. A year later, he entered Milan with an army of Swiss mercenaries. When the Swiss mercenaries in both armies refused to fight each other at the siege of Novara, the French King allowed Ludovico's soldiers to retreat. Ludovico, however, fell into French custody and was held captive in France until his death in 1508.\n\nThe title of Ludovico il Moro contains 'ANGLUS DUX' instead of 'VICECOMES DUX'.\n\nDoppio Ducato n. d.

There is one 'scopetta' with band for the motto on Francesco's ducat and both rider and horse wear badges with a 'biscione'. Here, there are two brooms without band and only one Visconti snake.\n\nTestone n. d. Ø 27 mm, 9,67 g.

Beatrice was a most accomplished Renaissance princess and acted as patron of the arts like her famous sister Isabella d'Este in Mantua. She was only 21 when she died in stillbirth in 1497 and was much regretted by her husband and the people in Milan.\n\nThis 'Prova di testone' was issued to commemorate her in 1497. The marble bust of Giovanni Cristoforo Romano, created in 1490/91 on the occasion of her wedding, served as model (59,5 cm, the Louvre).\n\nHer two minor sons Massimiliano and Francesco fled to Innsbruck to the court of Emperor Maximilian I after the capture of their father in 1500.\n\nLook at this detail of the Sforza altar , (ca. 1494, 230x165 cm, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan): Ludovico and son Massimiliano kneel on the left, Beatrice and the younger son Francesco kneel on the right."
