        "text": "Author: * DIonysia da Vinci - 3 on this thread out of 83 sitewide.\n\nDate: Dec 14, 2011 - 20:52\n\nBeatrice d'Este, c. 1490? Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan, Italy.\n\nAs with many Leonardo attributions, this one has long had its problems. Julia Cartwright, in her classic 1903 biography of Beatrice d'Este denied that any such painting, at least by Leonardo, could have existed of her in 1491 when, at the age of 15, she married Ludovico Sforza of Milan. Cartwright argued that Beatrice's older sister, Isabella d'Este, would not have asked to borrow a Leonardo painting of another woman if she had known that he had painted her sister. She suggested this painting was a portrait of Ludovico's illegitimate daughter Bianca Sforze, who died shortly after being married to the dashing young courtier and general, Giangaleazzo de Sanseverino.\n\nThis sharp profile view of the young woman, in contrast to the 3/4 angle preferred by Leonardo & other portrait painters, was apparently the standard way of sending a man a view of a prospective bride - especially one \"engaged\" to him as a young girl (as Beatrice had been since the age of five? - before he could actually meet her in the flesh? Perhaps this was an older tradition that had not yet become displaced by the 3/4 view perfected by Leonardo and others?\n\nThis portrait appears in the Wikipedia article on Beatrice d'Este where it is attributed to Leonardo: \"Leonardo da Vinci presented her with a portrait of herself for her wedding gift, a beautiful piece of Renaissance art.\" But if you click on the accompanying image to see Wiki's larger image, the info beneath it lists the painter as Ambrogio de Predis. Yet it appears also on the slip cover of a handy little volume in my library, \"Leonardo the Artist\" (McGraw -Hill, 1980), and on pp 148-9 of an article in it by Andre Chastel (an authority not to be sneezed at!) it is described as a portrait of Beatrice by Leonardo, adding: \"On her dress Leonardo - or perhaps a pupil - added the lacework pattern used in his \"Salle delle Asse decorations.\"\n\nThen there is the question whether Beatrice d'Este was that attractive. Here's another profile painting of Beatrice which shows her as quite chubby, especially in the cheeks and chin. When Lodovico married her at 15 he found her cute but treated her mainly as a charming child and then would rush off to join his mistress Cecilia Galeriani, the beauty painted by Leonardo as \"The Lady with an Ermine\" (or \"Weasel\"). For awhile I thought this must be a portrait of someone else, or possibly of Beatrice after several years of marriage to Lodovico Sforza. Married to him at 15, she lived only 7 more years, dying in childbirth at age 22. Here is a marble portrait of her lying next to him on their tomb, and it shows a striking resemblance to this chubby-faced portrait.\n\nThere's a later portrait of her we can look at later which on the Internet is often mislabeled as \"Beata Beatrice II d'Este. \" But \"beata\" here means \"blessed,\" not \"beautiful\" and the name apparently refers to a 13th ancestor of our Beatrice who was \"beatified\" as a Catholic saint. Maybe out Beatrice was named after her?\n\nAny thoughts, blowback or other input on any of this?"
