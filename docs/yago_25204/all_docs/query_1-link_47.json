        "text": "Included by UNESCO in the 1995 World Heritage List as an exceptional example of a Renaissance City, Ferrara is situated in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region on the Po Plain about one-third of the way between Bologna and Venice. Even if you are not staying in Ferrara itself, good rail links allow quick and easy access from the neighbouring cities of Bologna, Modena, Parma and Piacenza. From Milan, a day trip is manageable since the FrecciaRossa takes about one hour to Bologna and from there, the Regionale Veloce takes another 30 minutes or so to Ferrara – although you may have to add on time waiting for the connection at Bologna station!\n\nFerrara is well worth a visit purely to see the 12th C Romanesque Ferrara Cathedral with its 3-tiered façade and marble bell tower.\n\nHowever, the city is forever linked with the princely noble Este family, ruling Ferrara for over 350 years between 1240 and 1597, so your visit should include the trail that takes you to places that allow you to absorb the history and influence of this Renaissance dynasty.\n\nThe Este family’s strong desire for power, personal achievement and long-lasting recognition transformed Ferrara from a medieval town to one of the foremost Renaissance cities. During their rule, amongst other ventures, the House of Este founded or built:\n\nFerrara University (founded in 1391 by Marquis Alberto V d’Este, with notable alumni Nicholas Copernicus, Doctor of Canon Law, 1503, and arts graduate, Girolamo Savonarola – later hanged and burned!),\n\nthe moated Estense Castle (begun in 1385 for Niccolò II d’Este, Marquis of Ferrara),\n\nPalazzina Marfisa d’Este, a Renaissance-style small palace (constructed in 1559 by Francesco d’Este, and inherited by his daughter, Marfisa in 1578),\n\nthe Diamanti Palazzo (notable for its cladding in diamond-shaped marble blocks and now home to the National Picture Gallery but originally commissioned in 1493 for Sigismondo d’Este, brother of the Duke Ercole I d’Este).\n\nand it was under Ercole I d’Este‘s direct guidance in the 1490s that Ferrara underwent a substantial urban expansion based on humanist principles of the ‘ideal city’ through his Addizione Erculea (Ercolean Addition). This was the time when many of Ferrara’s most famous buildings were constructed but more importantly, the work, undertaken by Ercole’s court architect Biagio Rossetti, marked the beginnings of modern town planning. The Addizione Erculea remains virtually intact and unchanged to the present day and is one of the main reasons for Ferrara’s UNESCO World Heritage Site award.\n\nThis brief list of the accomplishments of Este family members gives some indication of the generations of power and influence of the d’Este family within the raising of Ferrara’s profile in Northern Italy.\n\nPowerful, ruling families needed to weave webs of useful marriages across a not-yet-unified Italy to keep peace and curry favour with neighbouring regions. So, just like many contemporary European Royal Families marrying spouses across Europe to try to maintain peace and expand influence, the Este’s ensured intermarriage with ‘local’ powerful families to advance their own political position within the Italian peninsula.\n\nTypical of its time, take for example the marital intrigue surrounding three of six of Ercole I d’Este’s legitimate children:\n\nIsabella d’Este (1474-1539) was betrothed at age 8 and married at age 15 in 1490 to Francesco II Gonzaga of nearby Mantua forming an alliance between the two cities. As Marchioness of Mantua, the cultured and intellectual Isabella became one of the movers and shakers of the Renaissance, famous for her patronage of the arts, literature and music. The couple had eight Gonzaga children despite Francesco taking Lucrezia Borgia as his mistress in 1502. Isabella had a lifelong friendship with Leonardo da Vinci and in 1499 he sketched her portrait …\n\nIsabella’s sister, Beatrice d’Este (1475-1497), married Ludovico Sforza, future Duke of Milan, in 1490 at the age of fifteen, so deepening the alliance between Ferrara and the major powerhouse that was Milan. Unfortunately, Beatrice died in childbirth at the age of 21, giving birth to her third child, who was stillborn.\n\nAlfonso I d’Este (1476-1534) – the brother of Isabella and Beatrice – married Anna Sforza in 1491, but an unhappy marriage, also into Milan’s Sforza family, didn’t work out well and in 1502, after Anna had died in childbirth, Alonso married Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI (at a time when Popes acknowledged their children – even those who were illegitimate!). Between them, Alfonso and Lucrezia had eight Este children during this marriage, despite Lucrezia’s physically passionate dalliances with her brother-in-law, Francesco Gonzaga – Isabella’s husband. Oh, what a tangled web they wove!\n\nThe Este family of Ferrara finally ran out of legitimate heirs when 63-year-old Alfonso II d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, died in 1597 after three childless marriages with no known children – legitimate or otherwise. As a result of Alfonso II’s death, his cousin Cesare d’Este was declared ruler of Ferrara by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor – but, unfortunately for Cesare, he was not accepted as Ferrara’s ruler by the Popes. In 1598, Cesare d’Este and his family were “obliged to leave the city” which was then incorporated into the Papal States by Pope Clement VIII, with the power of the government of Ferrara ceded to the cardinal legate.\n\nA comprehensive family tree of the House of Este with descriptions can be found here.\n\nNow the street plans of many of Italy’s Renaissance cities were firmly laid out according to the former Imperial Roman cities on which they had been founded. Not so Ferrara, whose Roman links seem to have been non-existent. No, Ferrara’s urban structure and street plan had been medieval in origin but, by the time the Este family had relinquished power, their public patronage had transformed medieval Ferrara into one of Italy’s most important Renaissance city states. The House of Este had left the city with a legacy of major urban development, the Addizione Erculea (the Ercolean Addition), and architectural splendour, including castles, palaces, churches and monasteries – not forgetting several self-aggrandising monuments dedicated to the hubris of the Este family. Furthermore, cultural associations and contributions to the arts and humanities, including attracting artists such as Michelangelo, Mantegna and Piero della Francesca to the Este Court, certainly placed Ferrara up alongside other notable Italian Renaissance cities.\n\nFinally, you may wonder why there is a bronze bust of Florentine-born poet, writer and philosopher, Dante Alghieri (1265 – 1321) in Ferrara’s Parco Massari …\n\nWell, a tenuous link it may be, but it relates to an earlier Beatrice d’Este (this time 1268 -1334, daughter of the Marquis Obizzo II d’Este). This Beatrice is known for Dante’s allusion to her (albeit not named specifically) in Purgatorio, second canticle of his ‘Divine Comedy’. You can read more about this here.\n\nIn Ferrara & the House of Este (Part 2), we shall have a look at some of the sights to be seen around Ferrara’s Centro Storico, in particular in the environs of Piazza della Cattedrale, while Ferrara & the House of Este (Part 3) picks up further the influences that the House of Este had in making Ferrara the UNESCO World Heritage Site that it is today.\n\nCiao Tutti, ci vediamo nella Parte 2\n\n(… see you in Part 2)"
