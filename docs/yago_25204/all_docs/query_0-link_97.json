        "text": "The Sforzas were an Italian Renaissance family that ruled Milan for almost a century. The family was originally named Attendolo. The founder of the dynasty, Muzio Attendolo, changed his family name to Sforza, meaning “force.”\n\nThe Attendoli were prosperous farmers of the region called Romagna in north-central Italy (near Ravenna). Muzio Attendolo Sforza (1369–1424) was a condotierre, or soldier of fortune. Essentially he was a mercenary who fought for whomever would pay him. Muzio’s son Francesco Sforza (1401–66) was also a soldier of fortune. He grew up in the court of Ferrara and fought under his father until Muzio drowned in a battle in 1424. Francesco remained a soldier for the next 20 years. His wife was the daughter of the duke of Milan. When the duke died in 1447, leaving the city to the king of Naples, Francesco responded with war. He blockaded the city, starving it into submission. On February 26, 1450, he entered the city and became duke of Milan. He died on March 8, 1466, and was succeeded by his eldest son Galeazzo Maria Sforza.\n\nThough traditionally characterized as despotic and extravagant, Galeazzo Maria (1444–76) was a capable ruler. He took an active interest in agriculture, constructed canals for irrigation and transportation, and introduced the cultivation of rice. He also encouraged commerce, particularly the manufacture of silk and wool. Galeazzo Maria was a patron of musicians, artists, poets, and scholars and himself wrote treatises on hunting. In foreign policy, however, he was indecisive and left Milan in virtual isolation. Galeazzo Maria’s daughter Caterina Sforza would eventually rule the city of Forlí, first as wife and then as widow of Girolamo Riario.\n\nAt Christmastime in 1476, conspirators who hoped to start an insurrection assassinated Galeazzo Maria. He was succeeded by his young son Gian Galeazzo Sforza (1469–94) under the regency of his widow, Bona of Savoy. After a power struggle, Galeazzo Maria’s brother, Ludovico il Moro (“the moor,” so called because of his dark complexion), seized control.\n\nLudovico Sforza (1452–1508) was the second son of Francesco Sforza. He acted as regent for his nephew from 1480 until 1494. When Gian Galeazzo died, Ludovico assumed the title of duke himself. Although a somewhat tyrannical ruler, he was also an outstanding patron of the arts. Through carefully calculated alliances he consolidated his power. His wife was Beatrice d’Este, daughter of the duke of Ferrara. They had two sons, Massimiliano (1493–1530) and Francesco Maria (1495–1535).\n\nLouis XII, a descendant of the first duke of Milan, became king of France in 1498. He claimed the city for himself. The Milanese turned against Ludovico, and he was forced to flee. The French captured and imprisoned him in 1500. Ludovico died in captivity on May 27, 1508. His sons went into exile in Germany, but by 1513 Massimiliano was back in Milan with Swiss support. Three years later the French drove him out. Francesco, however, was set up as duke in Milan in 1522 by the Holy Roman emperor Charles V. At Francesco’s death without heirs in 1535, the city passed to the rule of Charles V.\n\nSeveral other branches of the Sforza family survived. The descendants of Sforza Secondo (a son of Francesco Sforza) became the counts Sforza. One of them was the anti-Fascist statesman and foreign minister of Italy, Carlo Sforza (1873–1952)."
