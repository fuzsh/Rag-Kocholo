        "text": "In 1490 Gian Cristoforo carved a portrait bust of Beatrice dEste (Paris, Louvre), the daughter of Ercole I dEste, Duke of Ferrara, for her betrothal to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The attribution of this bust derives from a letter of 12 June 1491 from Isabella dEste, requesting that Ludovico send Gian Cristoforo, who had done Beatrices portrait, to Mantua to work for her. The bust is inscribed with the imprese of a sieve surrounded by a diamond ring. The sieve was a symbol of Ludovico, the diamond of Ercole; entwined they suggest marriage and the hope of fertility.\n\nThe inscription reads: \"Divae Beatrici D. Herc. F.\" (To the divine Beatrice, daughter of Duke Ercole\").\n\nThis bust is the sculpture most securely attributed to Gian Cristoforo and, with his medals, provides the basis for the assessment of his style."
