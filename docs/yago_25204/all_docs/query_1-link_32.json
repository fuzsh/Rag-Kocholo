        "text": "â€“ Note that Iâ€™m currently reproducing the dress that Beatrice Dâ€™Este tomb statue is wearing. Click here to follow the progress! ðŸ™‚ â€“\n\nSleeping Beauty â€“ the real Snow White\n\n(scroll down â€“ more pictures ahead!)\n\nThe real Beatrice dâ€™Este, painted by Leonardo da Vinci. This painting was her wedding gift by DaVinci. Feel reminded of something? Well, just read on.\n\nWhen I was photographing my way through Victoria and Albertâ€™s cast courts, I suddenly found myself standing in front of Snow White. It was an experience so intense that I almost dropped my camera when I first saw her.\n\nThere was a Lady on a tomb who looked so lifelike that I first thought someone had simply taken a most beautiful woman in an even more beautiful gown, had dipped her with the gown in plaster and placed her on the tomb. I have no idea if the following pictures can possibly in any way show how beautiful this cast really is. If you fail to see what I have described above, I suggest visiting the V&A in London and see her for yourself in the Cast Court.\n\nI became so obsessed with that tomb that I eventually made a sculpted version for SecondLife. Also, Iâ€™m making a reproduction of the dress sheâ€™s wearing in real life.\n\nJust to explain what you see here:\n\nThis is a plaster cast (=a replica in plaster, taken from the original, which was chiseled in marble â€“ heaven forbid, I canâ€™t imagine how any person in this world could get anything this detailed from a block of marble! I will explain a bit more later, after I have shown you the pictures I have.\n\nThe Lady whose tomb was reproduced here is Beatrice Dâ€™Este, born 1475, died 1497 at the age of 22. She was the wife of Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, known as Il Moro\n\nThe master who created this tomb was Cristoforo Solari (active 1489-1520). The original tomb is in the church of the Certosa, Pavia, Italy â€“ some more interior pictures of that church here. It was made 1497-99. The original location of the monument was in the church of S. Maria delle Grazie in Milan â€“ thatâ€™s by the way the same church in which Leonardo Da Vinci painted the â€šlast supperâ€˜. Some pictures of the original marble tomb, side by side with her husbandâ€™s tomb can be seen here.\n\nNow â€“ on to what I find so utterly fascinating about this life-size plaster castâ€¦\n\nFirst, look at these pictures:\n\nThere are ribbons running down behind her shoulder, coming from what seems to be the shoulder strap of her gown. Now follow those ribbons with your eyes (you can see them in almost all the other pictures above) and observe how they behave. They donâ€™t seem to be made of marble, but of fabric â€“ theyâ€™re twisting, bending, *playing* along the sides of her body.\n\nNow see this:\n\nCan you see the hem of her skirt? Yes? The inside with the turned over hem, too? Itâ€™s draping, It seems full of life. I thought that I would have been able to take the exact hem width of her gown by simply running a measurement tape along her hem (and could actually prove that theory when I worked on the reproduction dress). Itâ€™s unbelievable.\n\nAlso note the seams on her shoes, where the leather sole would have been attached to the plateau wooden shoe soleâ€¦\n\nWatch the tassels!\n\nNot two of them drape alike; you can see this in all the pictures.\n\nAnd now the most surprising thingâ€¦\n\nâ€¦at first I thought her hands were partially covered with some kind of handkerchief, until I discovered thisâ€¦\n\nSee that thing under her hand? The thing thatâ€™s practically *looking* at you?\n\nSheâ€™s holding a flea fur!\n\nThis all having said, I also think that this particular tomb was the inspiration for this gown of Drew Barrymoreâ€™s character Danielle in the movie â€žEver afterâ€œ:"
