        "text": "City in Utah, United States\n\nCity in Utah, United States\n\nMidway is a city in northwestern Wasatch County, Utah, United States. It is located in the Heber Valley, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Heber City and 28 miles (45 km) southeast of Salt Lake City, on the opposite side of the Wasatch Mountains. The population was 6,003 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nA post office called Midway has been in operation since 1864.[5] The town was so named for its central location in an agricultural district.[6]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.7 km2), all land. The region in which Midway sits is known as the Wasatch Back. Midway is bisected from north to south by Snake Creek, which includes the Midway Fish Hatchery just before the creek joins the middle section of the Provo River above Deer Creek Reservoir.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Midway has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.[7]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1870378—188071889.9%18907697.1%190093922.1%19101,0036.8%1920805−19.7%1930745−7.5%19408017.5%1950711−11.2%19607130.3%197080412.8%19801,19448.5%19901,55430.2%20002,12136.5%20103,84581.3%20206,00356.1%2022 (est.)6,217[2]3.6%\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 census Midway had a population of 3,845. The ethnic and racial makeup of the population was 92.6% non-Hispanic White, 0.2% African-American, 0.5% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.9% reporting two or more races and 5.5% Hispanic.[9]\n\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there were 2,121 people, 687 households, and 550 families residing in the city.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.78% of the population.\n\nThere were 687 households, out of which 43.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.0% were married couples living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.9% were non-families. 18.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The members of the city council as of September 2019 are Lisa Orme, Steve Dougherty, Jeff Drury, Kevin Payne, and JC Simonsen.\n\nRecreation\n\n[edit]\n\nJust above Midway is the Wasatch Mountain State Park on Snake Creek. There are numerous hiking trails including the WOW (Wasatch over Wasatch) Trail which ascends from Snake Creek at the golf course up along Pine Canyon Road.\n\nSwiss Days\n\n[edit]\n\nMidway Swiss Days brings thousands of people to the town. The event was started in 1947 through the efforts of Luke's Hot Pots Resort owners, Joseph B. and Pauline S. Erwin. It was originally called Harvest Days. They formed a club known as the \"Midway Boosters,\" which is still active, and whose members promote city improvements and activities. In order to attract larger crowds to Midway, the idea of a Swiss theme was created by Orma W. Wallengren (a.k.a. Clair Peterson) whose family owned and operated the Homestead Resort, replacing the name and theme of Harvest Days with Swiss Days.\n\nNotable facts\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the film 127 Hours, the scene where Ralston and 2 girls drop into a hidden pool[10] was filmed at Homestead caldera at the Homestead Resort.[11]\n\nMidway was the city nearest the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics cross-country and biathlon events, which took place at Soldier Hollow. The community is also known for the large \"hot-pot\" or geo-thermal Homestead caldera at the Homestead Resort. There is year-round scuba diving in the caldera's 90-95 degree water.[12]\n\nThe Homestead is also the site of an 18-hole golf course designed by Bruce Summerhays, Senior PGA Tour Pro.\n\nMidway stood in for the fictional town of Everwood, Colorado, in the closing scenes of the episode, \"Foreverwood\", the series finale of the TV show, Everwood. Background shots overlooking the town were filmed from Memorial Hill, with the Wasatch Range in the background.\n\nMidway was highlighted in the 2019 Hallmark Movie The Mistletoe Secret.\n\nThe 1974 NBC TV series \"Movin 'On\" filmed an episode named 'Hoots' in Midway about a farm family who were Hutterites. The local farmers who were not of this descent wanted the family out of the area. Claude Akins was the star of the Movin' On series. This episode has been remastered and is available on DVD and on YouTube.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nUtah portal\n\nList of cities in Utah\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
