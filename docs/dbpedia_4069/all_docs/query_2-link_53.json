        "text": "Gamers, bloggers, and influencers alike need ultra-fast internet to stay connected. Depending on your location in Heber City, UT, Quantum Fiber may offer speeds up to 940 Mbps**, and in some limited areas up to 8 Gig. With Quantum Fiber, choose the speed you need to win every battle and rule your online world! ~**Speed may not be available in your area.Limited availability, service and speed in select locations only.~\n\nThe cost of fiber internet in Heber City, UT, will vary based on the speed you choose per speed availability in your area. To find available pricing, go to Q.com and click on the blue \"Check Availability\" button, then enter your address. Quantum Fiber is a prepaid internet service subscription that allows you to select your preferred monthly payment method—credit card, debit card, or PayPal. Just set it and forget it, and you'll see a charge each month for the monthly rate of your chosen internet speed.\n\nGo to Q.com and click on the blue \"Check Availability\" button in the upper right corner. If Quantum Fiber isn't available yet, complete the short form online. We'll send you an email as soon as it becomes available in.\n\nTo bring lightning-fast Quantum Fiber internet into your home or small business, you need a modem or what we call a \"network termination device.\" That's our fancy way of saying a permanently-placed modem (usually mounted on a wall). Please don't remove it if you cancel service or move away. This device functions as a fiber-optic network end-point and modem rolled into one. It decodes the optical signals that make your fiber internet work and has a built-in Ethernet port for a wired connection.\n\nFor WiFi coverage, you must pair this type of modem with 360 WiFi or your own router. Remember, if you choose 360 WiFi service, it's available with several Quantum Fiber speed plans at no extra charge.\n\nOnce Quantum Fiber is available at your address, just order the service online at Q.com. If Quantum Fiber hasn't been installed at your location yet, you'll have to schedule a technician appointment to have the fiber-optic lines and equipment placed, and WiFi service set up per your request. For WiFi, our technician will size up your space, determine how much WiFi coverage you need, and then set up a solution to suit how you live and work online. Before leaving, the technician will test your internet health and speed to make sure your service delivers what you requested. Usually, installation takes three to four hours, and a current resident, 18 or older, must be present—so be sure to plan ahead.\n\n360 WiFi is built for homes and businesses that need the utmost in WiFi connectivity. The mesh network uses a series of WiFi pods or access points spaced out around your home or business to deliver a strong connection where you need it. Then, 360 WiFi directs traffic as it talks to all your smart devices and prioritizes and routes them so that everyone and everything stays connected smoothly and efficiently. With 360 WiFi, you'll get improved WiFi security, the ability to manage who's connected, and even parental controls.\n\nYes! Connected Voice is designed with your connected life in mind. With Connected Voice, you can choose between two packages and get clean, crystal-clear digital quality with virtually every single call. No matter how you message, meet, or call, get everything you need on one amazing platform."
