        "text": "Solar Energy Data for 84032\n\nSee the chart below to see how different types of solar panel installations compare in 84032.\n\n* Amounts listed in kWh/m2/day (kilowatt hours per square meter per day).\n\n* See glossary & definitions below.\n\nSolar Energy Analysis for 84032\n\nBased on historical 84032 data, solar panels that always track the sun throughout the day will produce the maximum solar energy output in 84032. [1]\n\nThe region associated with 84032 has an average monthly Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) of 4.65 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day), which is approximately 20% less than the average monthly Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) of 5.84 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nSolar installations in 84032 that are always titled at the latitude of Heber City (Average Tilt at Latitude or ATaL) average 5.37 kWh/m2/day, or about 15% greater than the average monthly GHI of 4.65 kWh/m2/day and approximately 8% less than the average monthly DNI of 5.84 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nDirect Normal Irradiance (DNI)\n\nDirect Normal Irradiance: The total amount of solar radiation received per unit area by a surface that is always perpendicular to the sun rays that come in a straight line from the direction of the sun at its current position in the sky.\n\nSolar Radiation Analysis for 84032\n\nThe region associated with 84032 has a average annual solar radiation value of 5.53 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day). [1]\n\nThe month with the highest historical solar radition values in 84032 is June with an average of 7.03 kWh/m2/day, followed by July at 6.83 kWh/m2/day and September at 6.57 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nThe three months that historically average the lowest average solar radiation levels in 84032 are December with an average of 3.37 kWh/m2/day, followed by January with an average of 3.69 kWh/m2/day and February at 4.35 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nSolar Power Levels in 84032\n\nThe average monthly solar radiation level in 84032, of 5.53 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day) is approximately 41% greater than the average level of 3.93 kWh/m2/day in a city with historically low levels (WA) and is approximately 16% less than the average level of 6.61 kWh/m2/day in a city with historically high levels (NV). [1]\n\n→ Values listed as 0 (zero) are not available (N/A).\n\nSolar Power: 84032 vs. the U.S.\n\nBelow is a month-by-month comparison of how average 84032 solar radiation levels compare to average levels in a city with historcially high levels (NV) and a city with historically low levels (WA). [1]\n\n→ k/m/d = kWh/m2/day = kilowatt hours per square meter per day.\n\n→ Values listed as 0 (zero) are not available (N/A).\n\nSolar Output Analysis for 84032\n\n84032 has a average annual solar AC output value of 6139.79 kilowatt hours (AC). [2]\n\nThe month with the highest historical solar power output in 84032 is June with an average of 611.4 kWhac, followed by July at 609.88 kWhac and August at 587.33 kWhac. [2]\n\nThe three months that historically average the lowest average solar output levels in 84032 are December with an average of 338.05 kWhac, followed by January with an average of 373.35 kWhac and February at 393.31 kWhac.
