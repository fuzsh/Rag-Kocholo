        "text": "00euphoria00\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac\n\nIn the late 1960s, Fleetwood Mac was a success among British blues bands. The band was started by guitarist Peter Green, who recruited the rhythm section of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie. Green himself had replaced a departing member, Eric Clapton, as the lead guitarist of the \"Bluesbreakers\"; Green and McVie had appeared on Mayall's 1967 A Hard Road album. The band employed another bassist, Bob Brunning, until John McVie was persuaded to join the band. Slide-guitarist and Elmore James devotee, Jeremy Spencer, rounded out the lineup.\n\nIts full name was now \"Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer.\" The band released two albums of Chicago-based blues. It also released a single, \"Black Magic Woman,\" which, when re-recorded by Santana in 1970 (on his album Abraxas), became a top five U.S. hit\n\nStephanie Lynn \"Stevie\" Nicks (born May 26, 1948 in Phoenix, Arizona) is an American singer and songwriter, best known for her work with Fleetwood Mac and a long solo career.\n\nEarly career and Fleetwood Mac\n\nNicks met future partner Lindsey Buckingham while attending Menlo Atherton High School and along with two others formed a band called Fritz which became popular as a live act from 1968 until 1972. They were the opening act for, among others, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. After the band parted, Nicks and Buckingham remained as a duo releasing the album Buckingham Nicks in 1973. While not a commercial success it caught the attention of drummer Mick Fleetwood who was looking for a new guitarist for his band Fleetwood Mac. Stevie was reduced to cleaning houses at the time that Fleetwood Mac stumbled onto the duo. They invited the duo to join them, and the new ensemble released the album Fleetwood Mac in 1975. Nicks contributed songs including \"Rhiannon\" and \"Landslide\", originally written for the second Buckingham Nicks album. The team-up proved to be successful, as a revitalised Fleetwood Mac enjoyed its first #1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than five million copies.\n\nIts follow-up Rumours released in 1977 became one of the all-time best-selling albums, selling more than 19 million copies. With several Nicks songs such as \"Gold Dust Woman\", \"I Don't Want to Know\", and Fleetwood Mac's only Billboard Hot 100 number one single, Dreams, which was written by Nicks while she was taking a short break in another room as the band was recording during the making of the Rumours album. The recording of Rumours was a difficul time for the band as Stevie and Lindsay were splitting up as were Christine & John McVie which produced a tense but productive working environment with many of the songs seeming to directly address former partners.\n\nThe band's next album Tusk was more experimental in sound, and while successful, alienated some of its fans. Though the album sold four million copies, it was dramatically less successful than Rumours. The double album contained Nicks' \"Sister of the Moon\", \"Angel\", \"Beautiful Child\", and \"Storm\", along with the Top 10 hit \"Sara\", which reached #8 on the charts. Around this time Nicks had another hit with Kenny Loggins on \"Whenever I Call You Friend.\"\n\nSolo career\n\nNicks recorded her first solo album Bella Donna in 1981. Its lead single \"Stop Dragging My Heart Around\" was a collaboration with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and it reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Other singles included \"Leather and Lace\" (#6) with Don Henley, \"After the Glitter Fades\" (#32) and \"Edge of Seventeen\" (#11). Bella Donna reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and as of 1990 is certified quadruple (4x) platinum.\n\nFleetwood Mac reconvened for their 1982 album Mirage and Stevie contributed the hit \"Gypsy.\" The album quickly went double platinum.\n\nNicks released a second solo album titled The Wild Heart in 1983. It also went double platinum, reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, and featured three hit singles: the Prince inspired track \"Stand Back\" (#5); \"If Anyone Falls\" (#14); and \"Nightbird\" (#33). In addition, several more songs not released as singles were played on rock radio and made the Mainstream Rock chart: \"Enchanted\" (#12); \"Nothing Ever Changes\" (#19); and \"I Will Run to You\" (#35).\n\nIn 1985, she released the platinum Rock a Little (#12), scoring more hit singles: \"Talk To Me\" (#4); \"I Sing for the Things\" (#60) and \"I Can't Wait\". The \"Rock A Little\" tour following the release of the album was widely successful, resulting in a filmed concert at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, and a solo outing with Tom Petty and Bob Dylan in Australia. Though Nicks was at the top of her game professionally, a devastating drug addiction was taking a toll on her voice, career, and personal life.\n\nIn 1986, Nicks was treated for cocaine addiction at the Betty Ford Center. Later, Nicks was prescribed Klonopin, a sedative, to counteract her anxiety after ceasing her use of cocaine. This led to another addiction battle that she would not overcome until 1994.\n\nHer next album with Fleetwood Mac, titled Tango in the Night, included Nicks' song \"Seven Wonders,\" which reached #19 on the Billboard charts. Sandy Stewart wrote the song \"Seven Wonders,\" and because Nicks had only listened to the song a few times before recording it, the lines \"all the way down you held the line\" was misheard by Nicks as \"all the way down to Emmeline\". Fleetwood Mac had always had personality conflicts, but the tension between Buckingham and Nicks had grown unbearable; Buckingham quit the group right before their Tango in the Night world tour.\n\nThough set back by the departure, Fleetwood Mac eventually toured anyway, replacing Buckingham with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette for the release of their Greatest Hits album and a world tour in 1988. The new line-up would record two songs for the release, \"As Long As You Follow\" and Nicks' \"No Questions Asked\". The album has sold 8 million copies to date. The band also released a video featuring live performances and sound checks from a show at the Cow Palace in San Fransisco. However, several shows had to be delayed or cancelled and the tour was cut short due to Nicks bout with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (in addition to her dependence on tranquilizers).\n\nNicks had essentially been working nonstop for nearly 9 years, attenpting to juggle a solo career with her devotion to Fleetwood Mac. None-the-less, Nicks pressed on.\n\nIn 1989, she released her solo album The Other Side Of the Mirror. It spawned a major hit with the single \"Rooms On Fire\" (#16), but this was the only song to make the singles chart; \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" and \"Long Way to Go\" did achieve some Mainstream Rock radio play. Although sales were not as solid as previous releases, the album nevertheless went platinum. It also includes the release \"Two Kinds of Love,\" a duet with Bruce Hornsby.\n\nNicks returned to Fleetwood Mac in 1990, when they recorded Behind the Mask. Buckingham's absence was apparent. The album went gold and still hit the Top 20, but was nowhere near the level of success of previous Mac albums. After the \"Behind the Mask\" tour, Nicks left the group and Christine McVie retired from touring. Nicks was quoted as saying in reference to her departure: \"My role in that particular Shakespearean drama is over.\"\n\nIn 1991, Nicks released Timespace ( #30 on The Billboard 200 ), a \"best of\" album which included contributions from Jon Bon Jovi (\"Sometimes It's a Bitch\", for which a video was shot to promote the compilation), and Bret Michaels of Poison (\"Love's a Hard Game to Play\". The third new song, \"Desert Angel,\" was dedicated to the men and women serving in Operation Desert Storm. Nicks apparently had misgivings about the timing of the release and the new material on the album, but was put under pressure by her record label to record the songs and move ahead with the project. The album would eventuall go platinum in 1997.\n\nDuring the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, Bill Clinton used the Fleetwood Mac hit \"Don't Stop\" as his campaign theme song. Fleetwood Mac reunited to perform the song at his 1993 Inaugural Gala, where Nicks' weight gain, as a result of prolonged use of tranquilizers, was visible for the world to see.\n\nIn 1994, Nicks released the most poorly received album of her career, Street Angel (#45 on the Billboard 200 album chart). \"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\" from the album made #57 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Stevie was crushed by the poor reception to the album, and by the vicious attacks from critics regarding the weight she had gained while on the sedative Klonopin. Nicks then entered seclusion for several years following the Street Angel tour, beat her sedative addiction, and lost weight.\n\nRecent career and collaborations\n\nShe returned to the spotlight in 1997 when plans to help Lindsey Buckingham with a solo album turned into one final album with the Rumours-era group. This live album, The Dance, debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and Stevie's singles \"Landslide\" and \"Silver Springs\" (which had been originally planned for Rumours but shelved due to it's length, much to Stevie's regret) also did well, as did the concert tour. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed together one final time.\n\nStevie released a gold-selling boxed set, Enchanted, in 1998 and supported it with a U.S. tour. The tour did well and Nicks was back on top.\n\nIn 2001, Nicks reclaimed much commercial and critical success with her solo album Trouble in Shangri-La, which hit #5 on the Billboard 200, and was her highest charting album since 1983's The Wild Heart. The album went gold and has sold upwards of 650,000 copies. A dance remix of one of its two lead singles, \"Planets of the Universe,\" achieved #1 on the Billboard Club Play chart.\n\nA second greatest hits album from Fleetwood Mac, \"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\", was released in 2002 and quickly hit the Top 20 and became yet another platinum smash. Ultimately, this was followed by a studio album with John McVie, Buckingham, and Fleetwood (Christine McVie had retired from the road and the group), their first album together in 16 years (The Dance had been a greatest hits package with a few new songs sprinkled in for flavor). Say You Will was released in 2003. The album received positive reviews and was certified gold. Their tour of America, Europe and Australia ended in September 2004.\n\nAfter a few months' respite from the Mac's tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and then did a 10-show tour with Don Henley. Nicks continued the tour solo, playing over 20 dates nationwide during the Summer of 2005, ending it where it began, at Caesars Palace. There her set included the rarely-performed-live \"If Anyone Falls,\" the moving \"How Still My Love\" from Bella Donna and an impressive, high-energy rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"Rock and Roll.\"\n\nOn August 10th, 2005 her father, Jess Nicks, passed away.\n\nOne of the reasons for Nicks' continued career is the devotion she inspires in her fans. Such notables as Sheryl Crow, the Dixie Chicks, Michelle Branch, Tori Amos and Courtney Love have praised her work, and vice versa. She has done duets or guest vocals for several of their albums and they've returned the favor. The Dixie Chicks covered her 1975 classic \"Landslide,\" which became a smash and hit the Top 10. Smashing Pumpkins also had a significant hit with the song on modern rock radio. She recorded a duet with Chris Isaak on his 2004 Christmas album. She has also made appearances on a number of soundtracks, ranging from 1980 (the cult cartoon Heavy Metal), to 1998 (Practical Magic) and the hit Jack Black comedy School of Rock in 2003.\n\nA notable feature of her albums, especially her compilations, are her liner-note descriptions about each song, and what they mean to her.\n\nStevie is considered to have been one of the most beautiful women in the music industry. While she has had well-publicized affairs with men ranging from Buckingham to Mick Fleetwood to the late Warren Zevon to Eagles member Don Henley, Nicks has only married once, to Kim Anderson. Her best friend (his wife) had recently died of cancer, leaving behind a husband and young child, and Nicks felt it was her calling to marry Anderson and raise the child. They married in 1983, but the arrangement quickly fell apart and they split a year later.\n\nOne of the more persistent rumors which has trailed Nicks through the years is that she is a witch and is heavily involved in Wicca. While she has a love for the mythic (Rhiannon) and gothic and has no problem with any of these beliefs, she has never been associated with Wicca nor has she ever called herself a witch, although her work is copyrighted under the name Welsh Witch Music and themes of witchcraft recur throughout her lyrics.\n\nStevie currently resides in Paradise Valley, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, and in February/March 2006, toured Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer John Farnham. It's also rumored that a DVD release highlighting these concerts will be released at a later date.\n\nPop Culture\n\nIn 1998, Lucy Lawless parodied Nicks on Saturday Night Live, in a skit called \"Stevie Nicks' Fajita Round-Up.\" In the skit, Nicks ran a Tex-Mex cantina in Arizona, where all of her signature dishes were take-offs on her song titles. Also in the skit, she ties in her food choices to her drug addictions. Nicks herself had appeared as a SNL musical guest in 1983, performing \"Stand Back\" and \"Nightbird\".\n\nIn the episode \"Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants\" of South Park a goat is mistaken for her when she and Fleetwood Mac are scheduled to perform in Afghanistan for U.S. soldiers.\n\nIn 2002, she sang a spirited version of Elvis Presley's classic song \"Won't You Wear My Ring Around Your Neck?\" on VH1's Divas Live tribute to Presley and also performed \"Landslide\" with the Dixie Chicks earlier that evening. In 2004, she sang with Chris Isaak in his PBS Christmas special.\n\nNicks was ranked # 14 on VH1's list of most influential female artists in music history.\n\nA New York City tribute/concert/festival in honor of Nicks, called Night of 1,000 Stevies, began in 1991 and has grown larger each year. The extravaganza even inspired a 2004 film, Gypsy 83, about two fans who drive all the way from Ohio to perform in the show.\n\nNicks' solo track \"Edge of Seventeen\" contributed the guitar part for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\" and she appeared in the video as well. An interview about her role in the song and video is featured in the corresponding Making the Video documentary.\n\nThe song \"Edge of Seventeen\" was also featured in the 2003 comedy film School of Rock starring Jack Black. The character played by Joan Cusack says Stevie is her favorite artist.\n\nIn the 2003 version of the Disney film Freaky Friday, the mother character (Jamie Lee Curtis) exclaims at one point when she is wearing her daughter's (Lindsay Lohan) clothes, \"I look like Stevie Nicks!\" (prompting the response from her daughter, \"Who's he?\").\n\nIn 2003, DJ Linus Loves released a cover of \"Stand Back\" featuring singer Sam Obernik on vocals. Many consider that Obernik's unique performance of the track is somewhat closer to how the song was meant to be performed originally, with the lyrics fitting in with the music much better than Nicks' original.\n\nIn 2005, Nicks contributed new vocals to a remake of the Fleetwood Mac song \"Dreams\" by DJ and house music duo Deep Dish. The song appears on their album George Is On.\n\nStevie is mentioned in two different episodes of The Simpsons. The first is during a Halloween special in which Mr. Burns comments that Lisa's character possesses \"more wicked witchery than Stevie Nicks.\" The second is when Homer is in bed one morning, and consults his to - do list; two of the four items on the list are \"See Stevie Nicks naked\".\n\nAt the \"Fashion Rocks\" concert of September 2005 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, soul singer Joss Stone and singer Rob Thomas covered the Stevie Nicks / Tom Petty 1981 smash hit \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" to kick-start the Fall Fashion Week.\n\nStevie Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia in October 2005, at which one of the horse racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australia/New Zealand extension to her \"Gold Dust Tour\" in February and March 2006.\n\n00euphoria00\n\nThe Grateful Dead was an American psychedelia-influenced rock band formed in 1965 in San Francisco from the remnants of another band, \"Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions,\" the Grateful Dead were known for their unique and eclectic songwriting style—which fused elements of rock, folk music, bluegrass, blues, country, and jazz—and for live performances of long modal jams.\n\nSome of the band's fans followed the band from concert to concert for years. These so-called Deadheads were renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many followers referred to the band simply as The Dead.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's career began under the name \"The Warlocks\" in Palo Alto, California, but as another band was already recording under that name (interestingly, it was the future Velvet Underground), the band had to change its name in order to get a recording contract. After meeting their new manager Rock Scully, they moved to the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. Many bands from this area, such as Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother & the Holding Company, and Santana, went on to national fame, giving San Francisco an image as a center for the hippie counterculture of the era. (Also see entry for the San Francisco Sound.) Of these bands, the Grateful Dead had members with arguably the highest level of musicianship, including banjo and guitar player Jerry Garcia, blues musician \"Pigpen\" McKernan, the classically trained Phil Lesh and drummer Bill Kreutzmann [1]. The Grateful Dead most embodied \"all the elements of the San Francisco scene and came, therefore, to represent the counterculture to the rest of the country\".\n\nThe name \"Grateful Dead\" was chosen from a dictionary. Some claim it was a Funk & Wagnalls, others an Oxford Dictionary, but according to Phil Lesh, in his biography (pp. 62), \"...Jer (Garcia) picked up an old Britannica World Language Dictionary...(and)...In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'\"\n\nThe Grateful Dead became the de facto resident band of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, with the early sound heavily influenced by Kesey's LSD-soaked Acid Tests, as well as R&B. Their musical influences varied widely with input from the psychedelic music of the era, combined with blues, jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\n\nMembership\n\nDe facto bandleader Jerry Garcia was the lead guitarist for the band—-although he was often seen both by the public and the media as 'leader' or a primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, he was reluctant to be seen that way, especially since Garcia and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output. Jerry was a native of San Francisco and grew up in the Excelsior District. One of the main influences on his musical style was bluegrass music, and Garcia also performed-—on banjo, his other great instrumental love-—in the bluegrass band Old and in the Way with mandolinist David Grisman. Classically-trained trumpeter Phil Lesh played bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan played keyboards, harmonica and was also a group vocalist until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. All of the previously mentioned Grateful Dead members shared in vocal performance of songs, although none of them had a particularly strong or tuneful voice. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in 1968 was joined by a second drummer, New York native Mickey Hart, who also played a wide variety of other percussion instruments. Hart quit the Grateful Dead in 1971, embarrassed by the financial misdealings of his father, Dead money manager Lenny Hart, and leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Dead for good in 1975. Tom \"TC\" Constanten played keyboards alongside Pigpen from 1968 to 1970. Two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played grand piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean Godchaux, joined the Dead as a backing vocalist. Keith and Donna left the band in 1979, and Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist. Keith Godchaux died in a car accident in 1980. Brent Mydland was the keyboardist for the Dead for 11 years until his death in 1990. He became the third Dead keyboardist to die. Almost immediately, former Tubes keyboardist Vince Welnick joined on keyboards and vocals. For a year and a half, Welnick was often joined by special guest Bruce Hornsby on piano. Robert Hunter and John Perry Barlow were the band's primary lyricists. Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of LSD\n\nThe Grateful Dead are well-known for their near constant touring throughout their long career in music. They promoted a sense of community among their fans, who became known as Deadheads, many of whom followed their tours for months or years on end. In their early years, the band was also dedicated to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music and health care to all comers; they were the \"first among equals in giving unselfishly of themselves to hippie culture, performing 'more free concerts than any band in the history of music'\n\nWith the exception of 1975, when the band was on \"hiatus\" and played only four concerts together, the Grateful Dead toured regularly around the USA from the winter of 1965 until July 9, 1995—with a few detours to Canada, Europe and three nights at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt in 1978. (They also appeared at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and the even more famous Woodstock Festival in 1969; their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with The Allman Brothers Band and The Band, before an estimated 600,000 people at the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen.)\n\nTheir numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that had been initially played in concert. The band was famous for its extended jams, which showcased both individual improvisation as well as a distinctive \"group-mind\" improvisation where each of the band members improvised individually, while still blending together as a cohesive musical unit, often engaging in extended improvisational flights of fancy. A hallmark of their concert sets were continuous sets of music where each song would blend into the next (a segue). Musically this may be illustrated in that the band not only improvised within the form of a song, yet also improvised with the forms.\n\nWall of Sound\n\nThe Wall of Sound was an enormous sound system designed specifically for the Grateful Dead. The band were never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played, so in their early days, soundman Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley designed a PA and monitor system for them. Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical issues. After Stanley was placed in jail for LSD production in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but ultimately found them to be less reliable than the systems conceived by their former soundman. In 1971, the band purchased their first solid sound system from Alembic Inc Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a permanent basis that year; Healy was a superior engineer to Stanley and would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\n\nThe desire driving the development of the Wall of Sound was for a distortion-free sound system that could serve as its own monitor system. After Owsley Stanley was released from prison in late 1972, he, along with Dan Healey, Mark Raizene of the Grateful Dead's sound crew, and Ron Wickersham, Rick Turner, and John Curl of Alembic Inc accomplished this by essentially combining eleven separate sound systems. Vocals, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and piano each had their own channel and set of speakers. Phil Lesh's bass was quadraphonic, each of the four strings having its own channel and set of speakers. One channel amplified the bass drum, and two channels amplified the other drums and cymbals in stereo. Because each speaker was producing the sound of just one instrument or vocalist, the sound was exceptionally clear and intermodulation distortion between instruments was nonexistent.\n\nThe Wall of Sound was designed to act as its own monitor system, and it was therefore assembled behind the band so the members could hear exactly what their audience was hearing. Because of this, a special microphone system had to be designed to prevent feedback. The Dead used matched pairs of condenser microphones spaced 60mm apart and run out-of-phase. The vocalist sang into the top microphone, and the lower mic picked up whatever other sound was present in the stage environment. The signals were summed, the sound that was common to both mics (the sound from the Wall) was cancelled, and only the vocals were amplified.\n\nThe Wall of Sound used 89 300-Watt solid state and three 350-Watt tube amplifiers to produce 26,400 total Watts RMS of audio power. It was capable of producing acceptable sound at a quarter mile, and excellent sound for up to six hundred feet, when the sound began to be distorted by wind. It was the largest portable sound system ever built (although \"portable\" is a relative term). Four semi trucks and 21 crew members were required to haul and set up the 75-ton Wall.\n\nThough the initial framework and a rudimentary form of the system was unveiled in February 1973 (ominously, every speaker tweeter blew as the band began their first number), the Grateful Dead did not begin to tour with the full system until a year later in 1974. The Wall of Sound was very efficient for its day, but it did have its pitfalls in addition to its sheer size. Synthesist Ned Lagin, who toured with the group throughout much of 1974, never received his own dedicated input into the system, and was forced to use the vocal subsystem for amplification. Because this was often switched to the vocal mikes, many of Lagin's parts were lost in the mix. The Wall's quadraphonic format never translated well to soundboard tapes made during the period, as the sound was compressed into an unnatural stereo format and suffers from a pronounced tinniness.\n\nThe rising cost of fuel and personnel, as well as friction among many of the newer crew members (and associated hangers-on), contributed to the band's 1974 \"retirement.\" The Wall of Sound was disassembled, and when the Dead began touring again in 1976, it was with a more logistically practical sound system.\n\nSteal Your Face\n\nIn the words of Owsley Stanley:\n\nIn 1969 the Dead were renting a warehouse in Novato, California. I was sound man for the band at the time, and lived in Oakland. Bob Thomas, an old friend of mine had just moved from LA to the Bay area and needed a place to stay, and we needed someone to look after the warehouse, which had had a problem with break-ins.\n\nBob was a superb graphic artist whose work is now familiar to most Deadheads in the form of the Live Dead album cover and the Bear's Choice cover, on which the popular Dancing Bears appeared.\n\nThe Dead in those days had to play in a lot of festival style shows where the equipment would all wind up at the back of the stage in a muddle. Since every band used pretty much the same type of gear it all looked alike. We would spend a fair amount of time moving the pieces around so that we could read the name on the boxes. I decided that we needed some sort of marking that we could identify from a distance.\n\nI was in the habit of driving from Oakland to Novato in a little MGTF which had plastic side curtains, which were not very transparent, due to aging of the plastic. One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it, the top of the circle was orange and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment.\n\nAt the warehouse I told Bob the idea that I had, and he made a quick sketch. A mutual friend, Ernie Fischbach, who was visiting with Bob, said \"Give it to me, I'll show you an easy way to put it on the boxes.\" Whereupon he proceeded to cut holes in a couple of pieces of stencil paper. One was a circular hole, about 5 1/2 inches in diameter, and the other was a part of a circle 5 inches in diameter. But it was a half circle with a jagged edge. Then he held the stencil to an amp and sprayed a circle of white paint. Then with one side up, the red half circle went on top of the dried white paint and after wiping off the red and turning the stencil over, the blue was applied. This was the first version, and we put it on to all our gear. It helped make it easier to find our stuff in the crunch. I still have an old toolbox with one of the stencils on it.\n\nA few days later I was talking to Bob and suggested that perhaps the words \"Grateful dead\" could be placed under the circle, using a style of lettering that would appear to be a skull if you saw it from a distance (I guess I was influenced by too many posters of the time). Any way a few hours later he came down from the loft with the design we know and love.\n\nDeadheads\n\nMany of their fans, commonly referred to as Deadheads, would follow the band on tour. In contrast to many other bands, the Grateful Dead encouraged their fans to tape their shows. For many years, almost all of their shows would have dedicated taping sections. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes. In the 1980s, the band scored a top 40 hit with the song \"Touch of Grey\" (from In the Dark), which garnered a much younger and more mainstream fandom that was considered sharply different from the traditional Deadheads. These new followers were deemed \"Touchheads\" by the more established fans, a reference to their relative inexperience with the band. The late 1980s and 90s saw the Grateful Dead attracting a huge following that left many long time deadheads in doubt as to whether people were coming out for shows to see the band, or simply to be part of the atmosphere. Whatever their differences, the deadheads are often considered to be the most devoted fans in the rock world.\n\nThe parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert was as much a part of the event as the concert itself. One could find items for sale at many cars in the lot, from grilled cheese sandwiches to \"kind\" brews and nitrous balloons. (Some deadheads would earn their entire touring budget selling such items.) Concertgoers typically congregated in the lot for hours before a show, playing guitar, hacky sacking and getting high. After the show, a deadhead with the post-show munchies could probably find a grilled cheese sandwich made on a camping stove at the door of a VW bus by a friendly hippie.\n\nLive releases\n\nStarting in 1991, the Grateful Dead released numerous live concerts from their archives in two concurrent series: the From the Vault releases are multi-track remixes, whereas the Dick's Picks series (named for the band's late archivist, Dick Latvala) are based on two-track mixes made at the time of the recording. There have been at least 36 Dick's Picks releases as of November 2005. A series of videos began to trickle out of \"The Vault\", starting with View From the Vault (recorded in Pittsburgh on July 8, 1990 at Three Rivers Stadium) and View from the Vault II (recorded in Washington, DC on June 14, 1991 at RFK Stadium); these releases are accompanied by the simultaneous release of multi-disc soundtrack CDs of the same shows represented on the videos. All three series of releases continue to this day.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 the Dead began offering downloadable versions of both their existing live releases, and a new internet-only series, The Grateful Dead Download Series, that is available exclusively through both their own GDStore.com (which offers the albums in both 256 kbit/s mp3 files and FLAC files -- a preferred audio standard for those who archive Dead and other fan-made live recordings on the Internet) and the iTunes Music Store (which offers them in their 128 kbit/s AAC format). Not surprisingly, these Internet-only albums have met with the same success as their CD-based brethren.\n\nIn November of 2005, the Dead's management outraged fans by asking the operators of the popular Internet Archive (archive.org) to stop making concerts available for download, and to offer only streamcast recordings instead. The band's spokesman, Dennis McNally, claimed such a repository \"doesn't represent Grateful Dead values\" because it doesn't foster one-to-one connections between fans. However, David Gans, host of a syndicated radio program, \"The Grateful Dead Hour,\" speculates that the band is motivated by money, noting \"when they were making $50 million a year on the road, there wasn't a lot of pressure to monetize their archives.\"[5]\n\nThe removal of the Dead's concerts from Archive.org created a storm of protest, in addition to a rapidly spreading boycott of the band's remaining commercial products. Several days after the announcement that the concerts had been removed, Brewster Kahle of Archive.Org made a cryptic announcement that audience tapes of the concerts would again become available, though so-called board tapes would only be available as streaming audio. Kahle claimed that the whole affair had been a \"misunderstanding,\" but John Perry Barlow, one of the band's lyricists, claimed that concerts had been restored after several members of the band had backed away from their earlier opposition after realizing they had created a public relations \"catastrophe.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones were dominating the airwaves. Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York \"folk-rock\" band The Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to \"go electric.\" Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction. It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk-music revival of the late 1950s and early '60s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars. But the new Dead music was also naturally different from bands like Dylan's or the Spoonful, partly because their fellow musician Phil Lesh came out of a schooled classical and electronic-music background, while Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan was a no-nonsense deep blues lover and drummer Bill Kreutzmann had a jazz background. Listening to their first LP (The Grateful Dead, Warner Brothers, 1967), one is also reminded that it was recorded only a few years after the big \"surfing music\" craze; that California rock-music sound seeped in, to some degree, as well.\n\nThe Grateful Dead’s early music (in the mid 1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"psychedelic music\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. This was natural, because they played psychedelic dances, open-air park events, and closed-street Haight-Ashbury block parties. The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country/western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and more, frequently melding several of them. Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes—a form of psychedelia that might run the gamut from strange to exotically beautiful. Most connoisseurs believe that the Grateful Dead's true spirit was rarely well captured in studio performance.\n\nThe early records reflected the Dead's live repertoire — lengthy instrumental jams with guitar solos by Garcia, best exemplified by \"Dark Star\" — but, lacking the energy of the shows, did not sell well. The 1969 live album Live/Dead did capture more of their essence, but commercial success did not come until Workingman's Dead and American Beauty, both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back acoustic musicianship and more traditional song structures.\n\nDissolution and Continuation of the band\n\nFollowing Garcia's death in 1995, the remaining members formally decided to disband. Though some of them occasionally toured through the late 1990s under the name \"The Other Ones\", they mainly chose to pursue various solo projects, most notably Bob Weir's Ratdog, Phil Lesh and Friends and Mickey Hart's music for the 1996 Olympics. The remaining members occasionally got together under the pseudonym Crusader Rabbit Stealth Band during the late 1990s, infrequently playing unannounced shows. The mid-2002 fall tour of The Other Ones, with Bob, Bill, Phil and Mickey, was so successful and satisfying that the band decided the name was no longer appropriate. On February 14, 2003, (as they said) \"reflecting the reality that [was],\" they renamed themselves The Dead, reflecting the abbreviated form of the band name that fans had long used and keeping \"Grateful\" retired out of respect for Garcia. The members would continue to tour on and off through the end of their 2004 Summer Tour, the \"Wave That Flag\" tour, named after a lyric from the song, \"U.S. Blues.\" The band accepted Warren Haynes as their new lead guitarist. Haynes is best known for his work with Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band.\n\nBandmembers\n\nJerry Garcia - lead guitar, vocals (1965 - 1995)\n\nBob Weir - rhythm guitar, vocals (1965 - 1995)\n\nPhil Lesh - bass, vocals (1965 - 1995)\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums (1965 - 1995)\n\nMickey Hart - drums (1967 - 1971, 1975 - 1995)\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, vocals, harmonica, percussion (1965 - 1973)\n\nTom Constanten - keyboards (1968 - 1970)\n\nKeith Godchaux - keyboards (1971 - 1979)\n\nDonna Jean Godchaux - vocals (1972 - 1979)\n\nBrent Mydland - keyboards, vocals (1979 - 1990)\n\nVince Welnick - keyboards, vocals (1990 - 1995)\n\nGrateful Dead Band Members (By Year) (1965-1967) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\n(1967-1968) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n(1968-1970) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nTom Constanten - keyboards\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n(1970-1971) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n(1971) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\n(1971-1972) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nKeith Godchaux - keyboards\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\n(1972-1973) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nRon \"Pigpen\" McKernan - keyboards, harmonica, vocals, percussion\n\nKeith Godchaux - keyboards\n\nDonna Jean Godchaux - vocals\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\n(1973-1975) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nKeith Godchaux - keyboards\n\nDonna Jean Godchaux - vocals\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\n(1975-1979) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nKeith Godchaux - keyboards\n\nDonna Jean Godchaux - vocals\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n(1979-1990) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nBrent Mydland - keyboards, vocals\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n(1990-1995) Jerry Garcia - guitar, vocals\n\nBob Weir - guitar, vocals\n\nVince Welnick - keyboards, vocals\n\nPhil Lesh - bass guitar, vocals\n\nBill Kreutzmann - drums\n\nMickey Hart - drums\n\n**Grateful Dead Shakedown Street Lyrics**\n\nYou tell me this town ain't got no heart.

He was shot by a man named Lee Harvey Oswald\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy, the thirty-fifth President of the United States, took place on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, USA at 12:30 PM Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC). Kennedy was fatally wounded by gunshots while riding in a presidential motorcade within Dealey Plaza. He was the fourth U.S. President to be assassinated, and the eighth to die while in office.\n\nTwo official investigations have concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, an employee of the Texas School Book\n\nDepository in Dealey Plaza, was the assassin, with one government investigation concluding that Oswald acted alone and another suggesting that he acted with at least one other person. The assassination is still the subject of widespread speculation, and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories.\n\nBackground to the Texas trip\n\nKennedy had chosen to visit Dallas on 22 November for three main reasons: to help raise more Democratic Party presidential campaign fund contributions in advance of the November 1964 presidential election; to begin his quest for re-election; and as the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had barely won Texas (and had lost Dallas) in 1960, he sought to mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic Party members\n\nwho appeared to be fighting politically amongst themselves.There were concerns about security because U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been jeered, jostled, struck by a protest sign, and spat upon in a visit to Dallas on October 24. To prevent a recurrence, Dallas police had prepared the most stringent security precautions in the city's history.\n\nIt was planned that Kennedy would travel from the Love Field airport in a motorcade through downtown Dallas (including Dealey Plaza) to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart in suburban Dallas. The car in which he was traveling was a 1961 Lincoln Continental, open-top, modified limousine. Riding with Kennedy in the limousine were: his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy; Texas Governor John B. Connally, Sr, and his wife, Nellie; Secret Service agent and White House Detail Team #3 Assistant in Charge, Roy Kellerman; and Secret Service agent and limousine driver Bill Greer. No presidential car with a bulletproof top was yet in service in 1963 (plans for such a top were presented in October 1963; FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover already had three bulletproofed cars.)\n\nIn a November 22 Dallas newspaper there appeared a black-bordered, full-page advertisement paid for by Kennedy critics who were associated with the ultraconservative John Birch Society. Throughout Dallas, and especially along the motorcade route, several groups critical of Kennedy expressed their views and handed out flyers. A smattering of handmade protest signs were held aloft by motorcade viewers, but there were no major disturbances.\n\nThe assassination itself\n\nThe presidential motorcade traveled nearly its entire route without incident, stopping twice so Kennedy could shake hands with some Catholic nuns, then some school children. Shortly before the limousine turned onto Main Street a male ran towards the limousine, but was thrust to the ground by a Secret Service agent and hustled away. Just before 12:30 PM CST (18:30 UTC), Kennedy slowly approached the Texas School Book Depository head-on, then the limousine slowly turned the 120-degrees directly in front of the depository, now only 65 feet (20 meters) away.\n\nWhen the limousine had passed the depository Kennedy was shot at for an estimated 6 to 9 seconds. During the shooting the limousine is calculated to have slowed from over 13 mph to only 9 mph. The Warren Commission later concluded that one of the three shots likely missed the motorcade, that the first to hit anyone went through Kennedy and likely also caused all of Connally's injuries, and the last to hit anyone opened a fatal wound in Kennedy's head. Nearly all agree that Kennedy was hit with at least two bullets, and was killed when shot in the head.\n\nThere was hardly any reaction in the crowd to the supposed first shot, many later saying they thought they had heard a firecracker or backfire. Only after Governor Connally was injured and had screamed, \"No, no, no. They are going to kill us all!\" did the gravity of the situation become clear to the Secret Service limousine driver, Bill Greer. During the attack Greer had turned very quickly to look behind him and towards the screaming governor and/or President, then turned forward again. He then turned very quickly again rearward (the limousine brake-lights were filmed illuminating at this point), and, besides Jacqueline Kennedy, driver Greer was the only occupant of the limousine actually facing Kennedy when he suffered the fatal head shot.\n\nWhen Kennedy's head was struck, it moved slightly forward and down 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm). The cause of what happened next is an issue that has kept people investigating the assassination. As the wound to the right side of his skull opened up, his right shoulder twisted forward and slightly upward, then his torso moved quickly backwards and to his left side, until he bounced off the rear seat vertical cushion and slumped lifelessly leftward towards his wife. Only after Kennedy was mortally wounded did the limousine then speed up to exit Dealey Plaza to proceed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.\n\nOthers wounded\n\nTexas Governor John Bowden Connally, Sr., riding in the same limousine in front of the president, was also critically injured but survived. His injuries occurred a split second after Kennedy's first injury (probably as a result of the same bullet, although this is still disputed by some). Doctors later stated that when Mrs. Connally pulled the governor onto her lap, the resulting posture helped close his front chest wound (which was causing air to be sucked directly into a collapsed lung). The action helped save his life.\n\nJames Tague, a spectator and witness to the assassination, also received a minor gunshot wound to his right facial cheek while standing 270 feet (82 meters) in front of where Kennedy was hit..\n\nRecordings of the assassination\n\nNo radio or television stations broadcast the assassination live, as the area through which the motorcade was traveling was not considered important enough to broadcast. KBOX-AM did recreate the sounds of the shooting for an LP record it released with excerpts of news coverage of that day, but it was not an original recording. Except for the media positioned at the rear of the motorcade, most media crews were waiting, in anticipation for Kennedy's arrival, at the Trade Mart.\n\nHowever, Kennedy's last seconds of life through Dealey Plaza were recorded on silent 8mm film in the 26.6 seconds before, during, and immediately following the assassination by amateur cameraman Abraham Zapruder, in what became known as the Zapruder Film. The 486 frames of this film have been used in many studies, but the film has not been able to settle disputes concerning whether or not Oswald was the sole assassin.\n\nFor several minutes before, during, and after the assassination a Dallas police motorcycleman's radio microphone was stuck in the 'transmit' position and was recorded back at the police radio dispatcher's room on a Dictabelt.\n\nKennedy declared dead\n\nStaff at Parkland Hospital's Trauma Room 1 who treated Kennedy observed that his condition was \"moribund\", meaning that he had no chance of survival upon arrival at the hospital. At 1:00 p.m., CST (19:00 UTC), after all heart activity had ceased and after a priest administered the last rites, the president was pronounced dead. \"We never had any hope of saving his life\", one doctor said. The priest who administered the last rites to Kennedy told The New York Times that the President was already dead by the time the priest arrived at the hospital, and he had to draw back a sheet covering the President's face to administer the sacrament of Extreme Unction. Kennedy's death was officially announced some time later, at 1:38 PM CST (19:38 UTC). Governor Connally, meanwhile, was soon taken to emergency surgery where he underwent two operations that day.\n\nA few minutes after 2:00 PM CST (20:00 UTC), and after a ten to fifteen minute confrontation with cursing and weapons-brandishing Secret Service agents, Kennedy's body was taken from Parkland Hospital and driven to Air Force One. The body was removed before undergoing a forensic examination by the Dallas coroner, which was against Texas state law (the murder was a state crime, and occurred under Texas legal jurisdiction).\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (who had been riding two cars behind Kennedy in the motorcade through Dallas and was not injured, even after Secret Service agents pushed him to the floor of his limousine) was first in line of succession to become President of the United States upon Kennedy's death. Johnson took the oath of office on board Air Force One before it departed Love Field.\n\nThe autopsy\n\nAfter Air Force One landed at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside Washington DC, Kennedy's body was taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital for an autopsy.\n\nThe autopsy was conducted by three military doctors and witnessed by over thirty military men. Two FBI men have since revealed that Kennedy had a large wound on the right side of his head, another wound 5.5 inches below his suit coat collar top just to the right of his spine, and a third wound centered in the front of his throat at the bottom edge of his adam's apple. (The Warren Commission report contains this same information.)\n\nSeveral photos and x-rays were captured during the autopsy (several of which have disappeared from the official record). The autopsy photos are graphic. If you wish to view them, along with the skull x-rays, and medical drawings prepared by the Assassination Records and Review Board when it took testimonies from the Parkland Hospital medical witnesses, they are available here and here\n\nReaction to the assassination\n\nThe first hour after the shooting, before Kennedy's death was announced, was a time of great confusion. As it took place during the Cold War, some people at first wondered if the shooting were not part of a larger attack upon the USA, and there was concern about Vice-President Johnson's safety. People began to huddle around radios and TV's for the latest bulletins.\n\nThe news of Kennedy's death by assassination shocked the world. In cities around the world, people wept openly. People clustered in department stores to catch TV coverage, and others prayed. Motor traffic in some areas came to a halt as the news of Kennedy's death spread literally from car to car. Schools across the USA and Canada dismissed students early. A misguided fury against Texas and Texans was reported from some individuals. All three TV networks cancelled regular programs scheduled for the next three days in order to provide non-stop news coverage of the assassination.\n\nMemorial services for Kennedy were held worldwide. The US Government declared a day of national mourning and sorrow for the day of state funeral, Monday, November 25. Many other countries did the same.\n\nFuneral\n\nAfter the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Kennedy's body was prepared for burial and then brought back to the White House and placed in the East Room for 24 hours. The Sunday following the assassination, his flag-draped coffin was moved to the Capitol for public viewing. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket.\n\nRepresentatives from over 90 countries, including the Soviet Union, attended the funeral on November 25 (which was his son's third birthday). After the service, the casket was taken by caisson to Arlington National Cemetery for burial.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was arrested eighty minutes after the assassination for killing Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit. He was charged with murdering Kennedy late that evening. Two days later while in police custody, Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby.\n\nOfficial investigations\n\nDallas Police\n\nAfter arresting Oswald and collecting physical evidence at the crime scenes, at 10:30 PM CST 22 November (04:30 UTC 23 November) Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry was ordered by, in his words, \"people in Washington\" to send all of the physical evidence found, but not Oswald, to FBI headquarters.\n\nFBI investigation\n\nThe FBI was the first authority to complete an official investigation. On December 9, 1963, only 17 days after the assassination, the FBI report was issued and given to the Warren Commission while the FBI was still the primary investigating authority for the commission. The FBI stated that only three bullets were fired during the assassination; that the first shot hit President Kennedy, the second shot hit Governor Connally, and the third shot hit Kennedy in the head, killing him. The FBI stated that Lee Harvey Oswald fired all three shots.\n\nThe Warren Commission\n\nThe first official investigation of the assassination was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson on November 29 1963, a week after the assassination. The commission was headed by Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States and became universally (but unofficially) known as the Warren Commission.\n\nIn late September 1964, after a 10 month investigation, the Warren Commission Report was published. The Commission reported that it could not find any persuasive evidence of a domestic or foreign conspiracy involving any other person(s), group(s), or country(ies), and that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The theory that Oswald acted alone is also informally called the Lone Gunman Theory.\n\nThe commission also concluded that only three bullets were fired during the assassination, and that Lee Harvey Oswald fired all three bullets from the Texas School Book Depository behind the motorcade. The\n\ncommission's determination was that:\n\n• one shot likely missed the motorcade (it could not determine which of the three),\n\n• the first shot to hit anyone struck Kennedy in the upper back, exited near the front of his neck and likely continued on to cause all of Governor Connally's numerous injuries, and\n\n• the last shot to hit anyone struck Kennedy in the head, fatally wounding him.\n\nIt noted that three empty shells were found in the sixth floor in the book depository, and a rifle identified as the one used in the shooting was found hidden nearby. Rather than accept that more than two shots caused injuries, the Commission offered as a likely explanation that the same bullet that wounded Kennedy also caused all of Governor Connally's wounds. This single bullet then backed out of Connally's left thigh and was found in nearly pristine condition. This theory has become known as the \"Single Bullet Theory\" or, the \"Magic\" Bullet Theory (as it is commonly referred to by its critics and detractors). Some ballistic evidence has suggested that such a bullet trajectory was possible, but this point is a source of much debate.\n\nThe Commission also criticized weaknesses in security, which has resulted in greatly increased security whenever the President travels. The supporting documents for the Warren Commission Report are not all due to be released until 2017.\n\nThe commission's findings have not gained majority acceptance from the general public in the USA, and many theories exist that conflict with its findings. Currently, there is no single theory with which a large majority of people would agree. However, most polls show that most people do not agree with the Warren Commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.\n\nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\nAn official investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), conducted from 1976 to 1979, concluded\n\nthat the scientific acoustical evidence established a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy. Other scientific evidence did not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President, but it did negate some specific conspiracy allegations.\n\nTheir conclusion was that four bullets were fired during the assassination and that President Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The HSCA concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the first, second, and fourth bullets, and that (based on the acoustic evidence) there was a high probability that an unnamed second assassin fired the third bullet (but missed) from President Kennedy's right front from a location concealed behind the Grassy Knoll picket fence, 9 feet (approximately 3 meters) to the west of the picket fence east corner (exactly where an image is seen in the Moorman #5 polaroid photo captured at Zf-315 to 316, but not seen seconds later). The HSCA's test firings within Dealey Plaza in 1978 also acoustically matched this same Grassy Knoll fence location 9' to the west of the picket fence east corner where several witnesses claimed to observe gunsmoke.\n\nSummary of other evidence\n\nShot sequencing and origins\n\nThere was a clear consensus among the witnesses as to the number of shots: over 90% thought there were three or fewer shots. More witnesses thought the final two shots were bunched together than thought the shots were evenly spaced, or that the first two were bunched.\n\nOf the witnesses who gave some testimony as to the source of the shots, 35 thought the shots came from the direction of the Grassy Knoll, 56 thought the shots came from the direction of the School Book Depository, eight thought the shots came from an entirely different location (including two who thought the shots came from inside the limo). Only five witnesses thought the shots came from two different locations.\n\nWitnesses\n\nOn November 22, and in the months and years following the assassination, many witnesses in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination have come forward or have been identified, and have stated their observations about what happened during the crucial seconds of the attack. Many witnesses were known to investigators, but some were never called by the investigators to describe what they observed. Many witnesses who were photographed at the scene (including several photographers and film-makers) are still unknown and have chosen to not come forward and/or have died.\n\nIn many respects, the details of the events described by the identified witnesses match, but there are also conflicting details between information described by the witnesses. Some witnesses have also described details that no other witness has yet described. Among the important witness considerations were:\n\n• The reactions to the gunshots of all limousine occupants relative to each other and relative to what each limousine occupant testified they saw, heard, and felt during the assassination.\n\n• How many muzzle blasts a witness remembered hearing.\n\n• The origin of the muzzle blasts a witness remembered hearing.\n\n• The identities of two armed men and at least one other man seen on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\n\n• The identities of other potential witnesses, photographers, filmers and/or other located assassins and/or co-conspirators.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nMany people dispute the claim that Oswald was an assassin, or the sole assassin. Investigations, scientific testing, and re-creations of the circumstances of Kennedy's death have not, in the American public's view, settled the question of who plotted to kill him. A 2003 ABC TV News poll showed that only 32 percent (plus or minus 3 percent) of Americans who expressed a view believe that Oswald acted alone in the Kennedy assassination http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf; a Discovery Channel poll revealed that only 21% believe Oswald acted alone. http://poll.discovery.com/servlet/viewsflash?jfk=6&cmd=tally&pollid=jfk&results=data%2Fdsc%2Fpackage%2Fjfk.results.html&submit.x=51&submit.y=6; a History Channel poll gave a figure of 17%. http://www.historychannel.com/jfk/jfk_poll_results.jsp\n\nUnreleased documents\n\nUntil 2017, tens of thousands of pages of documents will remain classified and sealed, away from the public's availability and research, including:\n\n• 3+% of all Warren Commission documents\n\n• 21+% of the House Select Committee on Assassinations documents\n\n• An undeterminable percentage of CIA, FBI, Secret Service, National Security Agency, State Department, US Marine Corps, Naval Investigative Service, Defense Investigative Service, and many other US\n\ngovernment documents.\n\nAdditionally, several key pieces of evidence and documentation are known to have been cleaned or destroyed, or are missing from the original chain of evidence (e.g., limousine cleaned out at hospital, Connally's suit dry-cleaned, Oswald's military file destroyed, President Kennedy's brain not accounted for, Connally's Stetson hat and shirt sleeve gold cufflink missing, forensic autopsy photos missing, etc.)\n\nAll documents related to the assassination that have not been destroyed are scheduled, according to the 1992 Assassinations Records Review Board laws, to be released to the public by 2017. Just before the 1964 presidential election, President Johnson ordered the Warren Commission documentations to be sealed against public availability until 2039.\n\nOn May 19, 2044, the 50th anniversary of the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, if her last child has died, the Kennedy library will release to the public a 500-page transcript of an oral history about John F Kennedy given by Mrs. Kennedy before her death in 1994.\n\nThe attempted assassination of General Walker\n\nGeneral Edwin Walker was an anti-communist, segregationist, and member of the John Birch Society. Walker was commanding officer of the 24th Army Division under NATO, but was relieved of this post by JFK in 1961 for distributing right-wing literature to his troops. Walker resigned from the Army and returned to his native Texas. He ran in the six-man Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1962 but lost to John Connally, who went on to win the race. When Walker came to Oswald's attention in February 1963, the general was making front page news by joining forces with an evangelist in an anti-communist tour called \"Operation Midnight Ride\".\n\nOswald began to put Walker under surveillance, taking pictures of Walker's home and nearby railroad tracks, perhaps his planned escape route, using the same camera used by Marina to take the famous backyard poses (see below). Oswald mail-ordered a rifle (see below) using his alias Hidell (he had already ordered a pistol in January). He planned the assassination on April 10, ten days after he was fired from Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. He chose a Wednesday evening because the neighborhood would be relatively crowded because of services in a church adjacent to Walker's home; he would not stand out and could mingle with the crowds if necessary to make his escape. He left a note in Russian for Marina with instructions should he be caught. Walker was sitting at a desk in his dining room when Oswald fired at him from less than a hundred feet (30 m) away. Walker survived only because the bullet struck the wooden frame of the window, deflecting its path, though he was injured in the forearm by fragments.\n\nAt the time, authorities had no idea who attempted to kill Walker. Marina saw Oswald burn most of his plans in the bathtub, though she hid the note he left her in a cookbook, intending to bring it to the police should Oswald again attempt to kill Walker or anyone else. Oswald's involvement was unknown until the note and some of the photos were found by the authorities following the assassination of JFK. The bullet was too badly damaged to run conclusive ballistics tests, though neutron activation tests later proved that the bullet was from the same manufacturer as the one that killed Kennedy.\n\nThe rifle and Oswald’s marksmanship\n\nIn March 1963, Oswald (using the name of his ex-boss in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Alek J. Hidell) allegedly purchased a rifle and handgun that were later linked by investigators to the events of November 22, 1963.\n\nRifle\n\n6.5x52mm Mannlicher-Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle\n\nSerial number C2766\n\nWestern Cartridge 160 grain (10.37 g) ammunition\n\nSide-mounted Ordnance Optics 4 x 18 scope\n\nHandgun\n\n0.38 Special Smith & Wesson Victory revolver 2.25 in (57 mm) barrel\n\nSerial number V510210\n\nConverted from 0.38 S&W, shortened from 5 in (127 mm) barrel\n\nThe rifle was kept in the garage of family friends, Michael and Ruth Paine, at whose home Marina Oswald was living at the time. See Warren Commission report describing testimony of Michael R. Paine and his wife, Ruth Paine. http://www.jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/paine_m1.htm\n\nDuring his military career Oswald scored as a \"sharpshooter\" in December 1956, on two occasions achieving 48 and 49 out of 50 during rapid fire at a 200 yard (183 m) distant target, but failed to attain a marksmanship badge. Skeptics doubt the likelihood of Oswald being able to fire shots so accurately and rapidly with the weapon and from the position he was theorized to use to kill Kennedy moving at 9 to 12 mph (14 to 19 km/h). They argue that expert marksmen could not accomplish Oswald's alleged feat in their first try during the re-enactments by the Warren Commission (1964) and CBS (1967).\n\nIn those tests, the marksmen were attempting to hit the target three times within 4.5 seconds, which was the FBI's technical estimate of the minimum time in which three shots could be aimed and fired with that specific model of rifle. The use of this number has been heavily disputed, with modern analysis of a digitally enhanced Zapruder film suggesting that the first and final shots may have come as much as 8.4 seconds apart.\n\nEven so, many of CBS's 11 volunteer marksmen, who (unlike Oswald) had had no prior experience with a Mannlicher-Carcano, were able to hit the target three times in well under the time allotted.\n\nThe assassination of JFK\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission report on the John F. Kennedy assassination, Oswald shot Kennedy from a window on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where he was employed during the Christmas rush, as the President's motorcade passed through Dallas's Dealey Plaza at 12:30 pm on November 22. Texas Governor John Connally was wounded at the same time, along with an assassination witness, James Tague, who was standing some 270 feet (82 m) in front of the presidential limousine. However, critics of this account assert that photographic and filmed evidence indicate that there were at least one or two shooters in an area known as the grassy knoll behind a picket fence atop a small sloping hill in Dealey Plaza, to President Kennedy's right-front. This is because from the 8mm films, it appears that the direction of President Kennedy's body was in a decidedly back and left direction after the shot. However, if the films are viewed frame by frame, it can be seen that there is a sudden, violent forward-motion of the president, inconsistent with anything but a sudden stop of the limo, (which didn't happen) or a rear-ward shot, as from the book depository. Several frames of video after the violent forward motion there is a second, backward motion, consistent (and indeed could only occur from) a rear shot. This oddity is attributed to the spin's characteristics during such an event. A large portion of brain matter was also projected forward, but some protest that this is not evidence of a rear shot by Oswald.\n\nOswald's flight and the murder of J. D. Tippit\n\nOswald immediately headed for the back staircase, disposing of the rifle behind some boxes. On the second floor, he encountered Marrion Baker, a policeman who had driven his motorcycle to the door of the Depository and sprinted up the stairs to search for the shooter. With him was Oswald's boss, Roy Truly, who identified Oswald as an employee, so Baker let Oswald pass. Oswald bought a Coke from a vending machine in the second floor lunchroom, crossed the floor to the front staircase, then descended and left the building through the front entrance on Elm Street.\n\nAt about 12:40 PM (CST), Oswald boarded a bus by pounding on the door in the middle of the block, but when traffic slowed the bus to a halt, he requested a bus transfer from the driver. He took a cab to a point a few blocks away from his rooming house, then walked there to retrieve his pistol and beige jacket. He lingered at a bus stop across the street then began walking. His ultimate destination is unknown, but before he was stopped, he had walked almost a mile, and was only four blocks away from a 1:40 pm bus which could have connected him with a Greyhound headed south for Mexico.\n\nPatrolman J. D. Tippit had undoubtedly heard the general description of the shooter, based on the statement Howard Brennan, who had seen Oswald in the window of the Depository from across the street, gave to police and was broadcast at 12:45. Tippit spotted Oswald about 1:15 PM (CST) near the corner of Patton Avenue and Tenth Street and pulled up next to him to talk to him through his car window. Tippit then got out of his car and Oswald pulled his .38 and shot him, killing him instantly. Thirteen people either witnessed the shooting or identified Oswald fleeing the scene.\n\nOswald allegedly emptied his revolver and reloaded, leaving the shells behind. He also left his jacket in the parking lot of a nearby gas station. He ducked into the entrance way of a shoe store on Jefferson Street to avoid some passing police cars, then dashed into the nearby Texas Theater without paying. The shoe store’s manager followed him and alerted the ticket clerk, who phoned police. The police quickly arrived and poured into the theater, which was playing War Is Hell starring Audie Murphy. Officer M.N. McDonald saw Oswald sitting near the back and ordered him to stand. Oswald punched McDonald and drew his gun, but McDonald tackled Oswald before he could fire. Police arrested him and took him away, past a crowd who had gathered outside the theater and shouted for Oswald’s death.\n\nOswald was arrested at the Texas Theater in the Dallas neighborhood of Oak Cliff at about 1:50 pm, first as a suspect in the shooting of Tippit and was then charged with assassinating Kennedy, even though the arraignment hearing on the Kennedy charge was abruptly interrupted and never did get finished, so he was never really officially charged with the assassination of President Kennedy.\n\nWhile in custody, Oswald denied the shooting, telling reporters \"I didn't shoot anyone\" and \"I'm just a patsy\".\n\nOswald's death\n\nOn November 24, at 11:21 am CST, after 15 hours of undocumented interrogations, while he was being transferred via car to a nearby jail, Oswald was shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police jail, in front of live TV cameras, by Jack Ruby a Dallas nightclub owner with friends and acquaintances in the U.S. mafia.\n\nMillions watched the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald on television. It was the first time in TV history that a murder was captured and shown publicly live, but it was shown live on only one network, NBC.\n\nThe route that Ruby took to get down into the basement of the Dallas jail has been disputed, although Ruby was very specific about using the entrance ramp (and his access to the jail on other days). This was recorded during the polygraph test Ruby insisted on taking and documented in a Warren report appendix. One witness, a former policeman named Napoleon Daniels, stated that he had seen Ruby use the ramp. The use of a route through the jail building suggests to some that Ruby had received help from authorities inside the building, however, many journalists entered the building without having their credentials checked, and Ruby can be seen on film also inside the building on the previous Friday night, apparently posing as a reporter.\n\nOne of the several questions Ruby showed signs of lying about (despite the polygraph operator having turned-down the sensitivity mechanism of the polygraph machine) was when Ruby answered \"no\" to if he ever knew Oswald. In the preparations to his trial Ruby later stated that he killed Oswald on the spur of the moment to spare Jacqueline Kennedy the stress and embarrassment a trial would cause her, and during the trial his defense team suggested that Ruby’s actions were related to an epileptic event brought on by the photographers camera flashbulbs and movie camera lights. Immediately after his arrest however, Ruby expressed to Dallas policemen that the American people would see him \"as a hero\" and/or that the murder was proof that \"Jews have guts.\"\n\nOswald’s grave is in Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth. The November 25th burial and funeral were paid for by Oswald’s brother Robert. There was no religious service and reporters acted as pallbearers. When his mother died in 1981, she was buried next to Oswald with no headstone. Originally, his headstone read \"Lee Harvey Oswald\", but this was stolen and replaced with a marker which simply reads \"Oswald\". Immediately adjacent is a marker which reads \"Nick Beef\", the stage name of a local comedian who purchased the site and used that fact in his act. Oswald's wife, Marina, married Kenneth Porter in 1965 and her daughters took Porter's last name.\n\nInvestigations\n\nThe Warren Commission created by President Lyndon B. Johnson on November 29, 1963 to investigate the assassination, concluded that Oswald did assassinate Kennedy and that he acted alone (also known as the Lone gunman theory). The proceedings of the commission were secret, and 3+% of its files have yet to be released to the public, further fuelling speculation about the assassination. A later investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, during the late 1970s, concluded that President Kennedy \"most-likely was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.\"\n\nThe 1981 exhumation\n\nIn October 1981, Oswald was subject to an exhumation undertaken by British writer Michael Eddowes (with Marina Oswald Porter's support). They sought to prove or disprove a thesis developed in a 1975 book, Khrushchev Killed Kennedy (The book was republished in 1976 in Britain as November 22: How They Killed Kennedy and in America a year later as The Oswald File.) The thesis of the trio of books was that when Oswald went to the Soviet Union, he was swapped with a Soviet clone. Eddowes's support for his thesis was a claim that the corpse buried in 1963 in the Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Park cemetery in Fort Worth, Texas did not have a scar that resulted from surgery conducted on Oswald years before. The final results of the exhumation found that the corpse they studied was Oswald's. The finding was based on dental records.\n\nCurrent Music: dead kennedys\n\n**HIPPIES**\n\n*Hippie (often spelled hippy, especially outside the United States) is a term originally used to describe some of the rebellious youth of the 1960s and 1970s. The word hippie was popularized by the late San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen. Caen's articles were always written with the help of notes and letters from his San Francisco fan base. He is also credited as among the first to include the words beatnik and yuppie in his column. Though not a cohesive cultural movement with manifestos and leaders, some hippies expressed their desire for change with communal or nomadic lifestyles, by renouncing corporate influence, consumerism and the Vietnam War, by embracing aspects of non-Judeo-Christian religious cultures (including much Eastern philosophy), and with criticism of Western middle class values.\n\nSuch criticism included the views that the government was paternalistic, corporate industry was greedy and domineering, traditional morals were askew, and war was inhumane. Hippies referred to the structures and institutions that they opposed as The Establishment.\n\nHippies of the time were interested in \"tuning in to their inner minds\" (with or without drugs or mystic meditation) and improving mainstream society. Influence in hippie culture is sometimes akin to Eastern religions, philosophies, and associations. Although mainstream culture is not associated with hippie ways, modern hippies nonetheless exist as made apparent on sites such as Hippyland and events such as Rainbow Family Gatherings.\n\n**Origins**\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s the term hipster came into usage by the American Beat generation to describe jazz and swing music performers, and evolved to also describe the bohemian-like counterculture that formed around the art of the time.\n\nThe 1960s hippie culture evolved from the beat culture, and was greatly influenced by changing music style and the creation of rock & roll from jazz.\n\nThe first use of the word hippie on television was on WNBC TV Channel 4 in New York City at the opening of the New York World's Fair in 1964. Some young Anti-Vietnam War protesters, wearing t-shirts, denim jeans and with long hair like The Beatles, were called hippies by NYPD and reporters. The police swung their batons at them to chase them off the escalators and they fought back.\n\nOn the east coast of the U.S., in Greenwich Village, young counterculture advocates were called, and referred to themselves as, hips. At that time, to be hip meant to be \"in the know.\" Young disaffected youth from the suburbs of New York City flocked to the Village in their oldest clothes to fit into the counterculture movement, the coffee houses, etc. Radio station WBAI was the first media outlet to use the term hippie to describe the poorly-dressed middle class youths as a pejorative term originally meaning \"hip wannabes.\"\n\nSeptember 6, 1965 marked the first San Francisco newspaper story, by Michael Fellon, that used the word \"hippie\" to refer to younger bohemians. The name did not catch on in mass media until almost two years later.\n\nHippie action in the San Francisco area, particularly the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, centered around the Diggers, a guerrilla street theater group that combined spontaneous street theater, anarchistic action, and art happenings in their agenda of creating a \"free city.\" The San Francisco Diggers grew from two radical traditions thriving in the area in the mid-1960s: the bohemian/underground art/theater scene, and the new left/civil rights/peace movement.\n\nLos Angeles also had a vibrant hippie scene in the mid-1960s, arising from a combination of the L.A. beat scene centered around Venice and its coffeehouses, which spawned the Doors, and the Sunset Strip, the quintessential L.A. hippie gathering area, with its seminal rock clubs, such as the Whisky-a-Go-Go, and the Troubadour just down the hill. The Strip was also the location of the actual protest referred to in the Buffalo Springfield's early hippie anthem of 1966, For What It's Worth.\n\nSummer 1967 in Haight-Ashbury became known as the \"Summer of Love\" as young people gathered (75,000 by police estimates) and shared the new culture of music, drugs, and rebellion. The outdoor Human Be-In concert started the Summer of Love. However, the Diggers felt co-opted by media attention and interpretation, and at the end of the summer held a Death of Hippie parade.\n\nThe hippie movement reached its height in the late 1960s, as evidenced by the July 7, 1967 issue of TIME magazine, which had for its cover story: The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture.\n\nBecause many hippies wore flowers in their hair and distributed flowers to passersby, they earned the alternative name, \"flower children.\"\n\n**Politics**\n\nHippies often participated in peace movements with Liberal views, including peace marches such as the USA marches on Washington and civil rights marches, and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations including the 1968 Democratic Convention. Yippies represented a highly politically active sub-group.\n\nBy today's standards, they're prone to hedonism and pacifism. The culture has also rapidly embraced postfeminist and mostly postmodern principles in wake of the twenty-first century.\n\nThough hippies embodied a counterculture movement, early hippies were not particularly tolerant of homosexuality. Acceptance of homosexuality grew with the culture, and by today's standards such issues are non-existent.\n\nHippie political expression also took the form of \"dropping out\" of society to implement the changes they sought. The back to the land movement, cooperative business enterprises, alternative energy, free press movement, and organic farming embraced by hippies were all political in nature at their start.\n\n**Drugs**\n\nDriven by the appeal of the Sixties \"psychedelics guru,\" Harvard professor Timothy Leary, who advocated use of these drugs as a form of mind expansion, many hippies participated in recreational drug use, particularly marijuana (see cannabis, cannabis (drug), and hashish) and hallucinogens such as LSD (see both psychedelic and psychedelic drug) and psilocybin (see Psychedelic mushroom). Some hippies prize marijuana for its iconoclastic, illicit nature, as well as for its psycho pharmaceutical effects. Although some hippies did not use drugs, drug use is a trait often ascribed to hippies. Some hippies used drugs to express their disaffection with societal norms.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBy 1970, much of the hippie style, but little of its substance, had passed into mainstream culture. The media lost interest in the subculture as it went out of fashion with younger people and even became the target of their ridicule with the advent of punk rock. However, many hippies made, and continue to maintain, long-term commitments to the lifestyle. As of 2005, hippies are found in bohemian enclaves around the world or as wanderers following the bands they love. Since the early 1970s, many rendezvous annually at Rainbow Gatherings. Others gather at meetings and festivals, such as the Peace Fest.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the New age travellers movement revived many hippie traditions into the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOf paramount importance to the hippy drug culture was the emergence on Bob Cox onto the scene in the mid to late 1960s. Cox was famous for his endless experimentation and determination to \"contstantly be in another state of mind.\" He pioneered the use of several now popular hallucenogenics and is also rumoured to have been involved in several prominent bomb threats throughout the period.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\n•Longer hair and fuller beards than current fashion. Many white people with curly or natty hair associated with the 1960s counterculture and American Civil Rights Movement wore their hair in afros in earnest imitation of African Americans. Some people find the longer hair offensive. They believe it is unhygienic, frivolous, or feminine; or offensive because it violates traditional cultural expectations. (When Hair moved from off-Broadway to a large Broadway theater in 1968, the hippie counterculture was already diversifying and fleeing traditional urban settings.)\n\n•Bright-colored clothing, and unusual styles, such as bell-bottom pants, tie-dyed garments, dashikis, peasant blouses, and non-Western inspired clothing. Much of their clothing was self-made in protest of Western consumer culture. Head scarves and long beaded necklaces, for both men and women, were also fashionable.\n\n•Listening to certain styles of music; psychedelic rock such as Jimi Hendrix and Jefferson Airplane, blues such as Janis Joplin, traditional Eastern music, particularly from India, or rock music with eastern influences, soulful funk like Sly & The Family Stone, jam bands like the Grateful Dead and folk Music Bob Dylan. Neo-Hippies frequently participate in the bluegrass music scene.\n\n•Performing music casually, often with guitars, in friends' homes, or for free at outdoor fairs such as San Francisco's legendary \"Human Be-In\" of January 1967, the Woodstock Festival of August 15, 16, 17, 1969, or contemporary gatherings like Burning Man festival.\n\n•The VW Bus is usually known as the counterculture/hippie symbol; a peace symbol is usually painted where the VW logo would otherwise be seen. Because of its low cost (during the late sixties), it was revered as a utilitarian vehicle. A majority of buses were usually repainted with graphics and/or custom paint jobs - this was the predecessor of the modern-day art car. Although not as common they did also use the Chevrolet Corvair cars and vans.\n\n•Free love (See also: Sexual revolution).\n\n•Communal living\n\n•Use of incense\n\n•Drug use\n\n**Pejorative connotations**\n\nThe term hippie has also been used in a derogatory sense to describe long-haired unkempt drug users. Among those of the Beat Generation, the flood of youngsters adopting Beatnik sensibilities appeared to be cheap, mass-produced imitations of the Beatnik artist community. By Beat standards, these newcomers were not \"clever\" enough to really be \"hip\". On the other hand, conservatives used the term hippie as an insult toward young adults who had leftist, liberal, and other progressive outlooks on life. Band members like the Beatles defied and baffled adults in adopting long, shaggy hair. Such showmanship of apathy to appearance is but one aspect hippies encompass in defiance of preconceived adult establishments.\n\nToday, the term hippie is often used by more conservative or mainstream people with the pejorative connotation of irresponsibility and participation in recreational drug use. Such as its use by the cartoon character Eric Cartman in the South Park series in the episode \"Die Hippie, Die\" , where Hippies took over the town.\n\nInadvertently, modern hippies prefer the term/spelling hippy, in opposition to the unfounded idealism first promoted in hippie culture. Hippy culture in its current construct generally has the views/tendencies of old hippies, with the knowledge that ultimate idealism is, to be blunt, stupid.\n\nMany hippies of today have made use of the World Wide Web and can be found on virtual communities such Hippyland in the US or UKhippy in the UK. Also, there are many events, festivals and parties which promote hippy-like lifestyles and values.\n\nSome critics of the hippy movement claim that people become hippies as a result of sociopathy and/or inferiority complex, but these claims have not been substantiated by psychological studies.\n\n**Neo-Hippies**\n\nNeo-hippies or simply hippies are 21st century people who still believe in the hippy philosophy developed in the 1960s. Dreadlocks — especially with beads sewn into them — remain popular amongst neo-hippies, however the modern hippy movement is more about lifestyle and not about a fashion statement.\n\nMuch like their 1960s counterparts, the peace and justice theme continues, especially with anti-war demonstrations in the wake of the Iraq War and repealing of the Patriot Acts I and II.\n\nIn the US, the art car has almost replaced the VW Bus since these have become sought-after by enthusiasts, however a few hippy-era buses remain. In the UK and Europe, there New age travellers in converted buses and trucks, who are generally referred to by others as \"hippies\", although most of them will strenuously reject this and other labels. An interest in environmentally-friendly technology like hybrid vehicles (not to include biodiesel and SVO/WVO technology) have also gained massive acceptance and promotion.\n\nVegetarianism or veganism, as well as beliefs in animal rights, are also evident.\n\nDrug usage is just as accepted as in the \"original\" hippy days, although it is not considered necessary to take drugs in order to be part of the lifestyle. Some modern hippies frown upon excessive drug use because of lessons learned from the past.\n\n**YUPPIE**\n\nYuppie, short for \"Young Urban Professional,\" describes a demographic of people comprising baby boomers as well as people in their late twenties and early thirties. Yuppies tend to hold jobs in the professional sector, with incomes that place them in the upper-middle economic class. The term \"Yuppie\" emerged in the early 1980s as an ironic echo of the earlier \"hippies\" and \"yippies\" who had rejected the materialistically oriented values of the business community. Although the original yuppies were \"young,\" the term now applies as well to people of middle age.\n\nSyndicated newspaper columnist Bob Greene is generally credited with having stolen the term \"Yuppie\" in one of his columns in the early 1980s, plagiarizing Alice Kahn who famously wrote about them in the East Bay Express in 1982, but the first known citation of the word is in a May 13, 1981 article entitled \"Chicago: City on the brink\" by R. C. Longworth in the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe term is often used pejoratively, with an emphasis on the connotations of \"yuppies\" as selfish and superficial. In the novel A Very British Coup, the Prime Minister Harry Perkins comments on the greed of Thatcherite yuppies in a speech.\n\n**The yuppie stereotype**\n\nThe term \"yuppies\" has come to refer to more than just a demographic profile: it is also a psychographic and geographic profile. It describes a set of behavioral and psychographic attributes that have come to constitute a commonly believed stereotype.\n\nAccording to the stereotype, yuppies are more conservative than the hippies who preceded them (in reality, many of the early yuppies were actually hippies in the 1960s and early 1970s). Dispensing with the social causes of the hippies (who themselves shed traditional values), yuppies tend to be \"work hard / play hard\" types. A cinematic example is Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street.\n\nIn accordance with their conservatism, yuppies are more likely to support the Republican Party.\n\nYuppies tend to value material goods (especially trendy new things) and are also supposed to have \"bad taste\" in that they buy expensive things merely for the sake of buying expensive things. An example would be the \"yuppie\" stereotype for those with a love for microbrewed and imported beer. In particular this can apply to their stocks, luxury automobiles (e.g. BMW, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz), sport utility vehicles, development houses, and technological gadgets, particularly cell phones.\n\nThe yuppies' fast-paced pursuit of material goods can have unintended consequences. Usually in a hurry, \"yuppies\" may seek convenience goods and services. Being \"time poor,\" their family relations can become difficult to sustain. Maintaining their way of life is mentally exhausting. Sometimes, they will move every few years to where their job goes, straining their family. This fast-paced lifestyle has been termed a rat race. Many of these yuppies are said to be \"credit posers\" and undertake a large amount of debt to maintain their outward image. To an extent, some of them essentially live \"paycheck-to-paycheck\" -- the paychecks are simply larger.\n\nHeavily influenced by a competitive corporate environment, \"yuppies\" often value those behaviors that they have found useful in gaining upward mobility and hence income and status. They often take their corporate values home to their spouses and children.\n\nAccording to the stereotype, there is a certain air of informality about them, yet an entire code of unwritten etiquette can govern their activities from golf and tennis to luncheons at trendy cocktail bars.\n\nOne of the better-known and more notorious depictions of yuppies was found in Bret Easton Ellis' controversial 1991 novel, American Psycho, which satirically lambasted the values of yuppies with a hyper-materialistic, murderously self-absorbed protagonist.\n\nYuppies tend to be associated with city or suburban dwellers. The term is commonly used by traditional country folk and good ol' boys in reference to people who live the stereotypical urban or suburban lifestyle. Entire city districts have been associated with the yuppie phenomenon; in the 1980s and 1990s, the redeveloped Docklands of London became widely regarded as a (very upmarket) \"yuppie slum\"; San Francisco's formerly working-class Noe Valley neighborhood is similarly afflicted with yuppie-sm, not to mention Houston's Midtown and Galleria districts (Houston's Midtown was once dominated by Vietnamese-run businesses until lofts were built in the mid-1990s). Similar accusations have been levelled against expensively renovated areas - usually low-rent communities - in a number of other cities around the world.\n\nYuppies are sometimes stereotyped as wearing white shirts, blue ties, and black pants\n\n**Related terms**\n\n•A Yumpie is a \"young upwardly-mobile person\". While this term is far less common, many confuse the derivation for Yuppie with that of Yumpie, and the two express broadly the same connotations anyway. Some sources (textbooks, even) state that yuppie actually stands for \"young upwardly-mobile person\".\n\n•Yippie (not to be confused with the political activist Yippies of the 1960s and 70s) is sometimes used to refer to a person with hippie values and attire but with yuppy consumer habits.\n\n•Buppie or Nuppie is sometimes used to refer to an African-American yuppie. This usually denotes a lack of association with larger African-American culture in favor of corporate or materialistic values.\n\n•Guppie is a gay yuppie. As with Buppie, this usually denotes a lack of association with a subculture.\n\n•Yuppify and yuppification are a slang terms used in place of the words gentrify and gentrification but with even more negative connotations.\n\n•A yuppie slum or yuppie ghetto refers to any neighborhood that is largely populated by a young well-off crowd, but often has other connotations of gentrification and rising rental and dining costs in a previously low-rent neighborhood.\n\n•A yuppie food stamp is a crisp US$20 note issued by an ATM.\n\n•DINKs (also DINKY in the UK) are well-off couples who often have much in common with \"yuppies\". The label is an acronym for Dual Income, No Kids [Yet].\n\n•SITCOMs are former yuppies or DINKs. The label is an acronym for Single Income Two Children Oppressive Mortgage.\n\n•Yuppicide is the killing of Yuppies, and vehicular yuppicide is the act of wrecking a yuppie's BMW. A New York-based hardcore/punk band in the 1990s called themselves Yuppicide.\n\n•Yuppie Flu is a term formerly applied to Chronic fatigue syndrome, before that condition's general acceptance as a genuine medical problem.\n\n•Organic Yuppies is a term used in the UK for yuppies and middle class thirtysomethings obsessed with food and wine.\n\n•David Brooks characterized yuppies as bourgeois bohemians, or Bobos, in his book Bobos in Paradise\n\n•Kill a Yuppie A graffitti tag term derived from Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\n•A variation, yuffie, is a young-urban-failure, or more generally a failed yuppie.\n\n•Boughie (pronounced Bōō-jee—an abbreviation of the word Bourgeois), is a derogatory term originated in African American Vernacular English, and used to describe an African-American of lower-class origins, who has elevated into societies \"upper-crust\", and has forgotten (or, has chosen to forget) about their true origins. Boughie's tend to have fancy or refined tastes, style, and manner in the interest of appearing more cultured or sophisticated than their ordinary upbringing would suggest. The term is used prominently by many black stand-up comedians, in urban films like Boyz N the Hood (1991), and in television sitcoms such as The Jeffersons.\n\n**YIPPYS**\n\nThe Youth International Party (whose adherents were known as Yippies, a variant on \"Hippies\" which is also used today to designate the surviving circle of activists who came out of the now-defunct YIP) was a highly theatrical political party established in the United States in 1967. An offshoot of the free speech and anti-war movements of the 1960s, Yippies presented a youth-oriented countercultural alternative to the strait-laced earnestness often associated with representatives of those movements. They employed media-savvy gestures—such as advancing a pig (\"Pigasus the Immortal\") as candidate for President in 1968—to mock the social status quo.\n\nThe Yippies had no formal membership or hierarchy: Abbie Hoffman, Anita Hoffman, and Paul Krassner were among the founders of the Yippies (according to his own account, Krassner coined the name). Other activists associated with the Yippies include Jerry Rubin, Stewart Albert, Dick Gregory, Ed Sanders, Phil Ochs, and David Peel.\n\nAbbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin became the most famous Yippies—and bestselling authors—in part due to publicity surrounding the five-month Chicago Seven Conspiracy trial of 1969.
