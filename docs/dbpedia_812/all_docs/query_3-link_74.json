The SEC allows eligible claimants to be compensated without the completion of a NIOSH radiation dose reconstruction or determination of the probability of causation. To qualify for compensation as a member of an SEC class, a covered employee must have at least one of the 22 specified cancers (shown below) and worked for a specified period of time at one of the SEC work sites. The statutory SEC classes describe employees who:\n\nworked at gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, or Oak Ridge, Tennessee for a total of at least 250 days before February 1, 1992, and were monitored for radiation exposure with dosimetry badges or had jobs with similar exposures to those monitored.\n\nworked before January 1, 1974, on Amchitka Island, Alaska and were exposed to radiation related to the Long Shot, Milrow or Cannikin underground nuclear tests.\n\nThe Act also authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add other classes of employees to the SEC.
