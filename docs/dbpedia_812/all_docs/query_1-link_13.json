As much as I rationalized about the pit being stupid, I couldn’t resist jumping in and going for a few rounds with the boys. I never can. No matter how much more violent each pit looks than the last one, there is still some sort of primal magnetism that draws people in--to be tossed about like a feather in a tornado. This time I stood back. I studied it. Something weird came to mind. This pit was going counterclockwise. Nothing odd in that--but as I thought about it, every pit I've ever seen, anywhere, anytime, goes counter- clockwise. And I do mean every last pit. Without a single exception. That's freaky. You'd think that just once- once-a pit somewhere would go the other direction, right? Something very strange is going on here. I'm sure some cosmic force, evil or not, is getting in on the fun in the pit. Gravity, probably, or maybe even Momentum. You know those cosmic forces, they just can’t resist a party. I tried to figure out how the hell I was going to prove that Gravity or Momentum had joined in our pits. . .Certainly, Gravity is always there, dropping unsuspecting punkers to the floor from terrible heights. He hangs around waiting for someone to do a stage dive. . .then when nobody is looking-zappo! He yanks them into the cement. It's great fun if you're a cosmic force. But I don’t think Gravity is responsible for making us all slam counterclockwise. I think it's Momentum. Before you read on, I want you to run to your bathroom and flush your toilet five or six times. Done? Notice anything? See how the water always spirals down the commode the same direction each time? It's not that toilet designers built toilets to spiral counterclockwise or anything, it’s just the earth’s rotational momentum turning it that way. Your neighbor's potty flushes counterclockwise too. The water in your shower goes down the drain the same way. It’s all very cosmic. Now, I agree this doesn't go very far in proving that the earth’s rotational momentum is spinning us all counterclockwise-so here's the catch: Past the equator, in the southern hemisphere of our little blue planet, the water turns the other way, clockwise, as it goes down the toilet. If you take a dump in Australia, it's gonna zip down the shute in the opposite direction. Don't take my word for it, ask your physics teacher. All this is fine and dandy, but I wonder if pits in Australia turn clockwise instead of counterclockwise? Somebody really needs to find out. We could all be falling victim to some stupid cosmic force with a dry sense of humor. Mark Brown/ 1206 Greenstone Lane/ Santa Maria, CA 93454 Dear MRR: I always thought being a M professional M and being \"hardcore\" were two opposite things. You could only be one and not the other. Not so anymore. In New York City they say anything is possible. Well, one day NYC may be remembered for ushering in the era of professional hardcore bands. A fate much worse than death. But it’s just about 1 987 now and that's mainly what's happening. There is a speck of hope though (I think). Not everyone wants to see the punk spirit die. Johnny Stiff is one of those people. So am I. Although we each do it independently, we both try to help the NY scene by booking shows wherever possible. Mostly for lesser known, unprofessional,\" talented punk artists. Things are tough. Neither young artists, writers, or musicians are getting enough exposure. Especially those with a punk sensibility. As NY City itself grows more and more filled with yuppies and professionals, it gets Jiarder and harder for these unprofessional\" punks to find venues, shows, or simply someplace to get together and talk with other punks. This is a problem. Promoters with lots of money, like Chris Wiliamson, can afford to bring well Known punk, aka, \"professional,\" bands to NYC, but they do nothing to help punks feel like they are part of some sort of community. If anything, Rock Hotel shows serve to alienate punks from each other, since people are treated like cattle and taken for as much money as possible at every show. The problem still remains--if a punk community is to exist in this town, there needs to be some place where punks can go and talk to others in the scene. Let’s face it, a genuine punk is getting harder and harder to find. Lots of so-called punks are \"professionals;\" they have jobs like \"professionals\" and don’t mind paying ticket prices like professionals, because they are professionals, and not punks. Because they wanna, be cool, which to them usually means accepted by a crowd, sometimes they wear black leather jackets, have spikey hair, and sometimes they even slam dance or get drunk and say fuck you to strangers. But they basically accept the status quo. They take what they can get. Sometimes they will do strange things just because they wanna be cool. That's the main thing. They wanna be cool. But they will never start a revolution and they are not punks. No matter how many A’s they wear on their jackets. A genuine punk once told me that she didn't give a shit about being cool-because she was cool. Bob Z / Artists & Writerz Underground, c/o Sarris Bookmarketing/ 125 E. 23rd St., #300/ New York, NY 10010. Dear MRR, As a longtime participant in, and observer of the NYC punk/hardcore scene, I feel not only entitled, but obligated to reply to Chris Williamson’s ridiculous letter from last issue. To begin, Rock Hotel was indeed a great concept. I mean, who could find fault with a huge venue, a good sound system, major publicity, and a decent band guarantee? Chris potentially paved the way for a lot of hardworking bands (from NY and elsewhere) to reach more kids, and not have to live on peanut butter while touring. Yes, we all bitched about the high ticket price, and went to the shows anyway. Why? Because in the past year and a half, at least four NYC clubs that booked 'alternative' bands had closed their doors, (Danceteria, Irving Plaza, Neither/Nor, and the World being some of the aforementioned clubs), and Rock Hotel shows became one of the few venues left for these bands, and their supporters. However, any great idea can go astray in the hands of the wrong individual. I don't think anyone questions what Rock Hotel could have been to tne East Coast scene. What should be under scrutiny here is Chris Williamson's tactics in dealing with bands. Many bands in NYC have found themselves unable to get shows at Rock Hotel. Chris actively blacklists bands according to strategy and whim. His pet band (who in the interest ot my physical well-being shall remain unnamed) are virtually his own Hitler Youth. If Chris and/or said band dislike you, you’ll be threatened, made the subject of asinine rumors, and perhaps physically assaulted. (If anything happens to me, you know who did it!). Of course, if you have a band, you'll never play Rock Hotel. Chris will do his best to see that you don’t get any: good shows anywhere, if his vendetta is pressing enough. Chris has screwed lots of people besides The ADOLESCENTS out of gigs and money. I know there are many others. I nope they come forth with their stories. I spent three weeks on the road with the ADOLESCENTS .and SCAB. Consequently, Chris's whining about the ADOLESCENTS individually struck me as being particularily weird and pathetic. Chris claims the ADOLESCENTS are a poor draw, and a lousy band. Okay, you tell that to the crowds of kids who turnea out in Philly, Providence, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Baltimore (three times, even after two cancelled shows-the promoters fault) and Detroit, especially to see them on tour (a tour, which it is heavily rumored, Chris tried to fuck up entirely. It is speculated that Chris’s meddling cost us a gig in Boston at the Channel. It is known that both bands were prevented from playing in NYC on the tour for the same reason.). Op the personal level, I beg to differ with Chris’s accusations yet again. As far as I could tell, Gordon Cox has been a close friend of the band for years, as well as their acting manager from time to time. There were quite a few nights on the road where Gordon's straight, no-bullshit attitude towards promoters was the sole reason either band got paid. (Gordon seemed to be well-versed in dealing with wormy promoters who always try to fuck a band out of their money.). Also, if Rikk Agnew is a comatose scum, how the fuck did he manage to drive us a third of the 18-hour plus trip from a gig in Illinois to our next one in D.C.? I guess it was auto pilot, right?! I won’t go on. It's embarassing. Aside from the usual flare-ups anyone could expect from thirteen people crammed into a soda truck, I found Gordon, Rikk, Tony, Steve S., Dan and Steve A. (their roadie) to be a really good bunch of people. It is common consensus of opinion here in NY that Chris Williamson has fucked over too many, and is headed for a very big fall. I believe that what goes around comes around. So I am inclined to agree. Vehemently. -- Name Withheld, N.Y.C. Dear MRR, It’s 1987, and the punk movement is in serious danger. Optomistic bands making an attempt to better the world are breaking up because of the so-called 'scene' that we nave created. Activist punks striving for peace and freedom are increasingly being replaced by idiotic poseurs who are using the scene as an excuse to commit senseless acts of violence, and who view anarchy as simply an absense of rules that would allow them to go about causing desetruction and pain. The main question I am trying to put forth is, \"How can our movement be saved/\" There are answers that would stop the scene's disunification and factionalization, and all of them depend on us. We have to take a good look at our minds, and we must decide to actually work to achieve something positive. All we have to do is look at all the petty bullshit that's been going on at so many gigs and gatherings (punks against skins, skins against punks, long hairs against short hairs, etc) to realize that our scene has been bastardized and perverted by negative bands and neo-fascist goons who are more interested in a person's hairstyle and way of dress than that person's ideas and personality. Saving the movement all depends on you. Do you really want our scene to have the same fate as the culture of the hippies in the 60's? If we are to accomplish anaything, we have to start by looking at ourselves first. The important thing to realize is that we are all in this together, so we have to learn to get along. We have to put aside stupid clique differences or well never be more than we seem to be now: a band of violent idiots who have nothing better to do than fight and get wasted. That s not what we're really about, is it? Let’s not make the rest of the world think so. We have to open our eyes and do something about all the corruption and injustice in this world. After all, if we don't take action, who will? Yes, it's 1987, and the world is in terrible shape. We can either open our eyes and our hearts, or we can die at the hands of a small group of demented war-mongers. We've only got one chance to change this world, so let's work hard not to fuck it up. Sincerely, Eric- Ogilvie/ 814 Sumac Place/ Escondido. CA 92027 To the readers of MRR, It is 10:30 pm CST. I just finished watching a movie on ABC TV, broadcast during prime time, calld \"A Night Of Courage\". In this movie, a bunch of 'punks’ beat and killed a young boy of about 16 because he was a 'spic'. They tnen terrorized for weeks the old man on whose doorstep the murder took place. The police never laid a hand on them; the movie was another paranoid 'everybody-buy-a-gun-and- protect-yourselves-because-the-police-are-idiot s-and-the-scum-run-wild-in-the-streets\" type of movie. Dialogue sample: \"We're going to break your legs... Tike we beat that other spic the other night... it was fun to watch him bleed.\" Now, misrepresentation of the punk scene is very common on TV, but this is by far the worst I've ever seen. The point of all this is, that as soon as I finish this letter, I'm going to write another one to the programming department of ABC, and I want to ask all of you wno saw this propaganda to do the same. Please, write and complain; this shit contributes to the reason we get fucked with and harrassed by cops. Write in, complain, alert these people to the reality of the situation. Don't be obnoxious; explain it as you would explain it to an idiot child (because after all, isn’t that exactly what you're doing?). Send your letters to the ABC programing department c/o your local ABC affiliate. Everyone who saw the show and wrote in to complain, God bless you (so to speak). Everyone who saw the show and does nothing, fuck you. Sean Lee Avery/ E.B.R.P. Prisook-40/ 2867 Brdg. Gen. Issac Smith Ave./ Scottandville, LA 70807 Dear MRR, Recently I’ve been thinking about this thing we call punk rock. Where it’s been, what it's done, the so-called alternative attitude, the (lack of) unity, the so-called non-conformist dress, and everything in between, The more I think about it, the more I realize it’s time for a radical change, and unless we change our direction, we may as well kiss our beloved punk rock good-bye. People bitch about violence. There are two ways to deal with it. One is to let it pass, the other is to whomp the snot out of the asshole who is fucking it up for everyone else. Sure, that's not a very positive messge, but if 'Sluggo' is slugging too many people, jump his shit and show him he isn't as tough as he thinks., But then again, it's our scene, it's your shows, so if you want a few thugs ruining and running your scene, just live and let live, turn the other cheek, People bitch about bands. The most obvious cure to this is. ..if you don’t like it, start your own band. I mean, it is punk rock, you don't nave to sound like the Cro-Mags on your first jam (although nowadays it seems the ol' hardcore is passe in a lot of people’s eyes). And a lot of you loudmouth shits who scream \"Faster, harder, play like men\" will find out it isn’t all that easy. You don't just pick up a guitar and thrash. People bitch about shows, lack of them or getting shut down. Think about why it’s like this. Is there 'punk rock' graffiti all over the place? Are people selling drugs outside? Are people harassing Joe Public as he walks by? Are people (especially minors) drinking outside? Do dead weight assholes hang out in front of the club during the show? If you can answer yes to any of these questions, and you know you or your friends are responsible for it, shut up. You’re the one to blame for your fucked up shows. People bitch about other people. So do I. We all do. But it has to end somewhere. Skinheads have such an image to uphold, death rockers are the poverty-level aristocrats of the punk scene, punks have to be punker than the other guy, and even if the whole crowd is cool, it takes just a few bad apples to fuck it up. The future is in our own hands as far as our music goes. Buf if you really want to control our own subculture, don't support big show promoters, buy direct from the band or record company, don't set yourself up in a bad position with cops (maybe if some of you dumbfucks would shut up for a minute you'd learn that most cops are polite and treat you like anyone else) and remember if you don't do it, who will? Preacher Scott/ Duxbum, VT MRR: I am disturbed about 'the metal influence' creeping into our collective consciousness. I'm also disturbed about some HC bands that are blatantly misogynists (women haters). I enjoy LED ZEPPELIN (yeah!) and other bands of that genre, but the new stuff really makes me nervous. (I'm not the biggest HC fan, I mostly listen to more ethereal, atmostpheric stuff: post punk, Gothic, Bauhaus and related bands). Nonetheless, like most 'Gothics’ I feel con- nected to the Hardcore scene-we do end up at the same shows from time to time, and my political inclinations are not that far removed (Emma Goldman, Crass, D.K.'s) and, believe it or not, the first album I bought and really got into from the selection marked 'new music' was FRESH FRUIT. I personally feel we ethereal, black-garbed night-crawlers are another mutation within the same cauldron collectively called punk. I’m digressing! All I'm suggesting, or asking, is that people give feminism some thought. Re- evaluate your feelings and opinions about women, about yourselves if you are women. Some of the metal and cross-over bands that I’ve heard my male friends listening to are so full of hate towards women-hate meaning the reduction of women to mere sex toys; nameless, faceless sets of tits, legs, and solitary asses. I'm not at all amazed that there are so few women who can actually listen to these bands. The same holds true for a lot of hardcore-women seem to be on the edges of this scene. (That's not surprising since women are on the outside edges of society as a whole. Read The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvior.) We, women, need men just as much as they need us, and it doesn’t seem like they need us very much since our inclusion is dependent on what we have to offer sexually. (Please, no accusations, I'm not a separatist.) I’m asking you to think about why it is that people like Biafra have called metal 'cock-rock'. May Daly calls the movers and shakers of this world 'cockocrats'. Think about this: \"Insofar as women are true to this consciousness (feminism), we have to be the most radical of revolutionaries, since the superstition (sexism) revealed to us is omnipresent and plagues even the ether major revolutionary movements of our time.\" Mary Daly. I suspect that 'punk' is one of those 'other major revolutionary movements’ that is plagued. I’m not going to pretend I feel my intuition is wrong or misplaced, I believe it is more true than T would like it to be. A lot of you may be saying 'so what’, and my answer to you is... we are more than half of the world's population, and yet we are second in just about everything. Do you really hate us that much, or have you just forgotten who we are-flesh and blood and brain, just like you-because it is easy to do so? With love, blessed be, Sybil Brownfield/ 1285 E. San Bernardino Ave/ Redlands, Oa./92374 MRR readers. So homobigotry finally comes out of the 'punk closet\". The more involved with the scene I get the more I notice this \"punk approved\" form of hatred. I have learned a few things about the American scene: not all punks are politically active, not all punks are anti-establishment, and most definitely, not all \"punks\" are punks... to me there is no difference between a fuckin YUPPIE neo-fascist senator, Supreme Kourt Justice or president denying me my \"inalienable rights\" and an ASSHOLE with a mohawk and army boots beating the shit out of me because I happen to be Gay... both support oppression, no matter what forms of music they listen to. You know who you are... tne bands who will sina about acid rain, scream in support of Black South Africans, damn the corporations and then dedicate your next song to \"all the faggot-ass queers who jike to suck dick and deserve to die of AIDS\"... and then proceed to sing about how much thrill it would be to kill all the faggots or watch them die of AIDS... real punk, real cool. Fortunately there are some beautiful pro-humyn bands in the area who rise above petty bigotry (A.P.P.L.E., URGENT FURY). I'll be the first to admit that the U.S. Gay \"movement\" (if you can call it that) has not been at all receptive to punx. Then again, with a bunch of white upper-middle class men running the \"movement\" what else can you expect. Homobigotry may be universal, but why can't punk overcome it? But no, keep on bashing the tags... help the Establishment with their divide and conquer plan of attack, thanx. Peace Love Anarchy, Ray M J POB 14/ Selden, NY 11784-0014 To anyone who will listen - I guess I'm writing (or should I say commenting) on the Guest Opinion in issue #44. Why are people so prejudiced towards homosexual and bisexual human beings?! I don't understand it. These people are human just like you and the next guy, yet people treat them like total shit, inanimate objects, dirt, freaks of nature, etc., etc. These guys or girls are people too. Personally, I have no homo- or bi-sexual tendencies in me but some of my best friends are \"gays, fags, queers” and they are the kindest, most caring people I know. They don’t wear pink and have rubber-wrists either. I would have never known if they didn't tell me. The only thing different about them is their sexual preference, and why should that be any of my concern? I can understand why it could scare people, with talk of AIDS and other sexual diseases, but all these people have to do is be careful. Keep in mind, AIDS isn't a \"gay\" disease. Drug users get it too, as well as perfectly innocent people who just go to give blood. Maybe you don't agree with me, maybe you do. Everyone has a right to their own opinion no matter what side they’re on. Right?! Write if you’d like, state your views I'll listen and respond. Peace, Unity & Longevity - Becki/ 18-1/2 E. Oxford St/ Duluth, MN 55803 MRR, I'm writing in response to Vicki of Taproot Farm from MRR #44. Where the fuck does she get off telling me that 'upper class have an unrealistic view of violence'. She should keep in mind that Siddhartha gave up all of his worldly possessions. She's telling me in this letter that since I'm a vegetarian I am not accepting reality-bullshit. She also says that slaughtering is done with respect. Am I just not accepting reality or are the animals in the industrial slaughter-houses really treated like shit? She also says that the deer are killed as 'warriors’. What exactly is a 'warrior' deer? But anyway, that's not all I am writing to you about, what’s happening to 'punk'? Why are we letting this commercialization destroy a once meaningful idealism? I live in Massachusetts and I recently attended a Gang Green show in Worcester at the Underground. First the charge was extremely expensive, $7 for a two band show. I he show started late and the music wasn’t even that good. For the price that I paid and the wait I think I'd rather buy an album and blast with some friends to get the same effect. S. Langlois/ PO Box 386/ Ware, MA01082 Dear MRR: In issue #44 I saw a number of letters which, in their own ways, were critical of MDC. This rather disturbed me. I am no real fan of MDC but I feel obligated to say a few words in their favor. One letter of particular concern to me came from Montreal, Canada, and insinuated that MDC have a capitalist attitude when on the road. I tend to disagree with this. For starters, tour expenses include food, drink, shelter, maintenance of vehicle(s) and equipment, as well as an emergency stash of money. Furthermore when talking about Canada, working papers and the exchange rate of Canadian currency must be accounted for. Split that money among band members, roadies, and additional costs and you’ll find that it does not go too far. Include the booking agent's cut and cancelled shows and you’ll find the band is below broke, in debt. And yet, MDC still finds the money to kick to opening bands in need. In conclusion, I’d just like to say that on December 27, 1986, MDC played a benefit show at The Farm in San Francisco. The money went for a good cause. I'm sure that MDC will continue to donate their services to worthy causes. The money that MDC earn, they are in need of and deserve. As far as I’m concerned, their attitude is anything but capitalistic. Dave Subcore/ P.O. Box 99284/ Seattle, WA 98199. Dear Maximum Rock n Roll, This letter is in response to Cutters' letter that was in issue number 45. I work in a laboratory in northern California that does drug testing. Cutters' letter prompted me to do some research of how certain techniques of drug analysis are done and their accuracy. The part about the contact high might not result in the loss of a job. When a company runs a routine drug screen on an employee, the method used is the radioimmunoassay. This method uses a standard and if the quantity of smoke inhaled is low, the result is a negative. The low quantity in question is usually the same as the second hand smoke from others. It could be positive if the lab runs a more sensitive test like a gas chromatograph or a HPLC. These methods show how much of a substance is in the blood stream. For widespread testing it is too expensive. The part about the lady having to fill the bottle in front of the guy is probably true but it happens. This is known as a legal drug screen. This happens when a person denies doing drugs and it has legal ramifications, such as a parole violation. I’m sure the place that had a guy witness a woman urinating could have handled the situation with some degree of class. 2 What would happen if president Reagan took the drug test? He did. He had a long time of notice before the test would take place, and the results were never made available to the public. Any addict could pass that test. I believe that we have the right to know if our leaders are doing drugs. In conclusion I would like to say that it doesn’t matter to the bosses out there. If they want you fired then you're history. We are at the mercies of those who sign our paychecks. Courage, Dan Rothbard. Dear MRR, I’d like to take this opportunity to straighten out a few inaccuracies I noted in the last few issues concerning the physiological effects of drugs and alcohol. #1 . A hangover is not caused by withdrawal from an overdose of alcohol. During the distillation and aging process, by-products known as \"congeners\" are naturally formed and are the cause of the hangover. The aging process helps remove many of these. The darker liquors have a higher congener count with bourbon having among the highest. Vodka on the other hand has among the lowest. There are many reasons one sometimes experiences jitters after a night of drinking but two maior reasons that come to mina are first, the overcompensation by the body to what it perceives as an overdose of an organic depressant by the overproduction of certain neurotransmitters with stimulating qualities (i.e. norepinephrine). Secondly, blood sugar balance is thrown off by the pancreas going into what amounts to a hysterical reaction due to the presence of large amounts of alcohol. The alcohol molecule is so simple that it doesn't even qualify as a carbohydrate molecule (like regular sugar) and as it enters the body it is broken down much more quickly than regular sugar which means that the pancreas must go into overdrive in order to supply the hormones needed to break down the alcohol. Add to this the fact that the reason you get drunk from alcohol is that the alcohol molecule competes for available oxygen within the body and it is little wonder that one ends up with a hangover. This is why one of the best cures for a hangover is pure oxygen. #2. LSD does not collect in the spinal fluid in a person's body. PCP does but that's a whole different story. According to the research done thus far, this is what happens when a person ingests a dose of clean (pharmaceutical) LSD-25: The drug goes to the brain where it performs an as-of-yet unknown function but it can be likened to a \"flip-of-the-switch\" type mechanism. The drug then heads for tne excretory system and is actually on its way out of the person's system before they hardly begin to feel the effects of the drug. It is believed that the drug simply unleashes a large amount of neuro-transmitters that are already present in the brain and these cause the effects associated with the drug. Flashbacks are believed to be caused by a \"learned response mechanism\" much the same as post-traumatic- stress-syndrome affects some Viet Nam veterans who have flashbacks of combat that occurred in their past. Hope I've straightened out some very comrtion fallacies. Peter Murphy/ 623-1/2 Woodward Ave/ Gulfport, MS 39501 Dear Max RNR, NO NO NO NO NO! I won't do it! No, no matter how bad I want to, I simply refuse to replay to that idiot Allin's remarks. NO! Well firstly I'd like to share a little fact with all our comrades in the fight against toll-free evangelism: they possess, in my estimation, very little, if any, technological ammo to counter the prank calls. Case in point: I've had at least three or four different names at my address receive 700 Club literature. Obviously the people answering their phones are dimwits when you consider that the following are all members of the 700 Club: Joe Stalin, Dan Ortega, Ho Chi Minh, Bill Rehnquist, Gary Hart, Col Gadafi, and Nelson Rockefeller. I’m dead serious. Well, famous names can get boring so it's fun to ask the operators why they believe in God and if they support the ERA. Tney usually get offended and sometimes hang up, but I'm sure we’ll get over it. On to other important topics, such as Nicaragua. The situation in Nicaragua's really tricky, considering all kinds of conflicting reports coming from visitors to said country. But I'm sure this doesn’t justify mining a harbor (especially without Congress’ approval or even knowledge!). Well .this is my shot at Nicaragua-if Mr. Reagan wishes to stop Communist aggression, let’s arm surrounding, NON-AGGRESSIVE countries (I guess that excludes Honduras), and if the Sandinistas attempt to export Communism, retaliate, but let's not go berserk, OK? Mr. Reagan claims the Sandinistas have crossed borders of other countries. True. But this was only done while chasing the Contras back after being attacked. Now if we follow along Reagan’s line of thinking, if A tries to rob B's house, and B chases A back to A's house, A has every legal right to kill B, especially if B is a Communist! Well I could go on about many other things, but I'm sure they'll be covered elsewhere. A special note to all fanzine editors: keep up the good work! Documentation is a necessary part of the scene, as are also new and fresh ideas! Peace and Democrats in '88, King Corona Dear Eugene, In #44 you brought up the all too ignorant point that elections mean something. Bullshit. What does it matter if Rambozo Reagan and his ultra-conservative cohorts are thrown out of office? Gee, they might be replaced with middle of the road Democrats— what a grand change. We still get beat up by skins, bopped by cop clubs and mocked for being individuals. Do you really think that our God-blessed government will ever accept anything but normal, middle class citizens as being worthy of having human rights? • ~ Free'dom can not work through democracy, even the pseudo-electoral democracy we have in t he U.S. Democracy is rule by majority and that sucks. What some person could ever want a group of their neighbors deciding such personal things as who they fuck, how they fuck, and even where they fuck. What goddam business is it of anyone else whether or not I shit in my living room or bathroom? People as a rule are herd animals who see something out of the norm as dangerous and bizarre. With democracy all we have to do to get anything banned is collect 51% of the voting public. Yes Eugene, elections do mean something. They perpetuate the myth that democracy is anything but a farce. What this world needs is individual liberty, the freedom to do whatever you choose as Iona as that freedom does not interfere with the freedom of others-Anarchy. We need a world where the only rule is to respect others as equals. Sure, it’s far fetched to believe that the powerful and strong would not overrun the weak in a peaceful world, but then it wouldn't be anarchy anymore, it would be a dictatorship. Gary Malcoh/ 6015 W. Olive #102/ Glendale, AZ Readers, It is becoming very dangerous to live in America if you’re different, according to Barry Lynn, Legislative Council for the American Civil Liberties Union, speaking in a Constitutional speech series at Ohio Wesleyan University in December. \"There is an increased amount of hysteria about people whose sexual identities or lifestyles are different from the majority’s,\" Lynn said. Lynn spoke on the Meese Commission’s report on pornography and how much of a hoax it was. He said that from the start, the commission was biased and intent on getting rid of porn. When the commission first started, Lynn said, they stated that the purpose of the commission was to \"find a way to curb the serious problem of pornography,\" thus destroying any objectivity whatsoever. Lynn pointed out the fact that just as critics of the new right have no right to ban Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson from television, the new right has no right to ban people like Jello Biafra or Larry Flynt. Lynn said that the Meese Commission contradicted itself when it came to the question of obscenity. Obscenity was defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1970 as \"Speech that does not convey ideas and is uncommunicative.” The commission and those who want to censor and ban pornography contradict themselves by saying that it conveys a dangerous message and also calling it obscene, he said. Lynn said that the pornography commission visited several American cities during its investigation. He accompanied them on a trip to a porn store in Houston. He said, \"They wouldn't touch the door knobs of the peep shows. . .and they'd look at their shoes and say, 'Gee, how do you clean off your shoes?' and they'd laugh.\" He said that tne mentality of the commission and a lot of Americans is \"I wouldn't do that! Yuck! Therefore, nobody should be able to do that.” Concerning the Dead Kennedy’s case, Lynn said he thought the case would be thrown out of court because \"that material (the Giger poster), even under California statute, cannot be what was intended by the legislature when they drafted that obscenity law.” (Note: the DKs have always contended that this was a political bust). Lynn said he thought that Biafra, Alternative Tentacles, Mordam Records, etc., would win. He added, \"But along the way, it costs a lot of people a lot of money.\" He said the Dead Kennedys' case will have a deterrent effect on rock music in general. \"There's a fear that, anywhere, you could wake up one morning and find that somebody has considered your record to be illegally obscene,\" he said. Sadboy/ 337 E. Ocotillo Rd./ Phoenix, AZ 85012 Dear Max: 4 I’m sure everyone is aware of the state elections that have come and gone a few months ago. Undoubtedly there were unsettling laws proposed all over the country. I live in California and there was a proposition to declare \"English\" the state's official language and therefore, all election material for power struggles to come would no longer be printed in any other language. So here would exist a group of people that almost equal the white population in California, the \"minorities\". They are no different than any other man or woman. They are put through the same eternal hell that our government, with the aid of the bourgeoisie, is generous enough to share with everyone. They feel the nerve shattering frustration of living in an oppressed society. They are raped by the I.R.S. Let's face it, they have become citizens of the U.S.A.; but for some reason, many were suddenly about to lose their constitutional right to vote, which is supposedly guaranteed to every citizen blessed by this country's democracy. Of course the thing passed due to the rich abundance of ignorance and closed- mindedness that we are so fortunate to possess in this state. Most people accepted it as a patriotic idea that would better America; which is exactly how the creators of the proposal intended it to be disguised. Much thanks also to Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris and \"Red Dawn”. If the people would just stop and think for themselves for a minute, without all the camouflaged propaganda tearing them in every different direction; if they would just take a second to look at the undistorted facts, they would have quite a different and real picture to analyze: 1. Most people are aware that California is a pretty important state to capture in elections (such as the ones coming up in ’88). 2. The minorities in California almost equal the population of whites. (That's a lot of votes.) 3. It's pretty common knowledge that minorities aren’t real big on the Republican party because they don’t do a damn thing for them (the minorities). 4. \"Surprise!\" The proposal was of Republican origin. 5. If the Republicans were to make it inconvenient not to mention impossible for many minorities to vote, they would have wiped out one of their biggest threats that opposes them. 6. Look at our respectable Republicans in office today and ask yourself whether or not you would buy a used car from them. These inhumanities have slipped by due to all the flag-waving Americans that are blinded by patriotism and bigotry. Though there is no \" banning of the press\", yet, there might as well be when the politicians are allowed to flood the pages of newspapers with outright lies that the media is so eager to relay back to the people. The papers that will actually print stories that blatantly speak out against the norm are far and few between, allowing the conservatives to yell what the people want to hear. This whole era reminds me of a not-so-famous Hitler quote: \"The people must not believe they are being manipulated, in order for them to be manipulated effectively.\" Greg Ryan/ 808 Sutro Ave/ Novato, CA 94947 Dear MRR, I'm writing this letter in response to the interview with vinny of A.P.P.L.E., which I found really enlightening. My thoughts are similar to his. However, I think there’s a major difference. In my opinion, by nature the majority of people are selfish and greedy - not exactly \"assholes\" though. The reason our system exists the way it does is a result of the personalities of the people - it's a direct correlation. But I still think we should strive to improve our governments and the ways people conduct themselves. Either one should demonstrate and go against the system, or try to get power in the system so that he/she can change it, or just go somewhere where he or she doesn’t have to abide by it. If someone has the gift of intelligence and charisma, he shouldn’t go away from it all; he should try to do what he can for others who don't know better and who can be helped. Like he said, anarchy is the ideal goal. However, anarchy is only an ideal goal for an ideal people - not for a world full of lots of greedy, selfish people. Otherwise, the world would turn to shreds by corruption. When people are free to do whatever they want to, they will need some kind of rules and structure to protect them from themselves, unless they are all good people, which they aren't. For now our goals should be to promote people's good side rather than their evil side. He gave an example of this: that there should be a great incentive for giving soup to the poor and homeless, instead of getting next to no money or none at all and receiving no gratitude from others. The problem with the system right now is that it promotes capitalism and industrialization rather than goodwill and tranauility. Tim Brown/ 350 Central Park West/ New York, NY 10025 Dear MRR and disgruntled students: (Just a few more depressing thoughts in this season of holiday cheer). I have just * finished reading Teaching As A Subversive Activity , a \"no-holds-barred, all out attack\" on our educational system. Written in 1969, it is still relevant to the present system. Basically, it questions about everything our schools consist of. It asks such questions as who decides what's worth learning?, how can we define subjects and are schools really teaching us to be original and creative? However, I found one glaring fault with the book. Although it calls for a drastic re-evaluation of our educational system, it does not discuss the teacher/student hierarchy. I will use the authors' comments along with my own views to support the thesis that school teaches outdated and trivial courses and also stifles free thought and creativity. Do schools teach relevant courses? Good question. Let me define \"relevant” as pertaining to and having some impact upon our present civilization. Obviously, courses where one is asked such questions as \"How many steps are on the pyramid of Cheops?\" cannot be classified as relevant. Who cares? Questions that ask for reasons and opinions are much more worthwhile and interesting. An examination of Egypt's isolation from the rest of the world and its effects on its society would be more effective in getting students to think. Another example of the educational dinosaur is the typical history class. The one where we learn Columbus sailed the ocean blue, Cartier kidnapped Indians, etc. Do we ever examine the reasons for and the ramifications of these events? No, not until high school and by then one has become so conditioned into accepting what the teacher says, it’s too late for original thinking. One always seems to be studying FACTS and not causes or emotions. Nothing seems to relate to today's society. This explains the lack of Indian studies in our school system. Sure, we learn about the Indians of the past, but what about today? Why don't we ask our teachers about these things? Which brings me to my next question. . . . In school, do we really think for ourselves or do we merely repeat what we’ve been taught? No really serious brain juice gets squeezed until high school and by then, one just accepts what the. teacher or textbook says. It's too late for new and original thinking on the part of most people because they're used to having the answers written down somewhere and don’t know how to think any differently. Maybe this is why so many people fail or end up frustrated. Maybe they simply are unable to think differently because of all those years of grade school. Even when students do try to express different views or are involved^ in different learning processes (fanzines for instance), they are met with strong opposition. In my school’s student handbook; parents are told to limit their daughter’s/son's extra-curricular activities as much as possible. Can’t have Johnny's grades suffer, can we? It doesn't seem to matter much if Johnny actually learns anything, just so long as his average stays up there. Who decides what’s worth learning and what isn't? And how can one divide learning into grades or courses? English almost always overlaps with History which almost always overlaps with Sociology, and so on. At most, course names should be guidelines. When one \"completes\" a course, is one really ready to go on to the next \"level\" of learning or are we just kidding ourselves into thinking that learning is finite and has boundaries? As George Bernard Shaw said, \"the only time my education was interrupted was when I attended school.” The people who decide what should be learned (actually, the words taught or absorbed would be better. Visions of classrooms full of sponges spring to mind. . .) have been brought up in the same sort of educational system, a system that does not allow for change or creative expression. They will, of course, be resistant to any new ideas, preferring the views they were brought up with. (Note: 1 apologize for this use of a nebulous \"they\" but I am unsure of exactly who the educational planners are. I guess teachers have some say but it has to follow the school board's guidelines). Finally, I come to perhaps the most controversial aspect of our educational system, the teacher/student, master/servant relationship. The teacher teaches, it is up to the student to do as the teacher says. The teacher asks the questions and the student must have the answers. A course where students discussed the topic amongst themselves and asked their own questions would probably be more productive because the student would know what s/he wanted to learn and would not have the negative stimulus of tests or quizzes put on her/him. It would also eliminate the idea that learning is quantitative and static (when it obviously isn’t) and would impose fewer limits on what the student is and isn't supposed to learn. As a student, what can you do to make changes? Next to nothing, if you want immediate change, but if you’re willing to go along with the system, you can eventually become a teacher or administrator, you must may be able to make some changes. Don't have any great expectations, though, school administrations are as inflexible as Reagan's stance on Star Wars. Putting out fanzines or getting involved in current affairs/peacenik clubs helps you meet friends who share your ideals and gives you moral support. They also provide positive and creative approaches to learning. I wish I had more ideas of how to cope with school but I am personally going through a pretty rough stage so it's sort of hard to think positive thoughts. All I can really say, I guess, is that school is idealistically there for people to learn, so use it as such. Don’t give up and turn off/tune out. John Saunders/ 821 Desalaberry St./ Gloucester, Ontario, Canada k1J-6Y5. P.S.-Just out of curiosity, does anyone know whatever happened to Extinct Publications? We sent them ten copies of our fanzine and never heard from them since, even after writing them twice. Maybe they’re living up to their name? Dear MRR, I would like to announce the formation of a new medium: it is called the Alliance for Liberal, Independent, and Creative Expression, or ALICE for short. It is a non-profit organization created to support the underground writer, poet, musician, artist or whoever. Support will be gathered via the creation of a fanzine, tentatively titled ALICE Underground . With allusions to Lewis Carroll aside, MICE ■ Underground will be a showtase of underground art and literature presented via a bi-monthly fanzine. It will hopefully be kept afloat through the continuum of reader contributions. The fanzine will be reasonably priced and all those whose art or literature is published within shall receive a complimentary copy. Whether the fanzine will include record reviews, band info or related subjects is still being discussed now. We will try to reach as wide an audience as possible though. So if anyone has anything to contribute I would certainly appreciate it. Hopefully, it will be a new medium in which to be familiarized with all kinds of new, exciting and creative expression. Send your poems, songs, artwork, comix, short stories and anything else creative to: Stig c/o ALICE Underground/ 6704 Escondido Cyn. Rd/ Acton, CA 93510 Dear MRR, I would like to send this letter as a warning. About 1 year ago, I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life - I joined the army. Some people in the scene tried to warn me; all my friends told me not to, but did I listen? Of course not. Now I regret it deeply. It all started last Christmas, after I had gone through some really rough times and was dealing witn some screwed-up relationships in the scene where I lived. It came to the point of suicide & severe depression but I made it through with the help of God (no, I will not get into an argument about God with anyone so please don't try to get me into one). Anyway, I needed money to go to school and there was absolutely none. (I had been fired from my job because of my hair color! They said I didn’t look \"All-American enough\".) One day, I happened to see Uncle Sam’s propaganda on the TV. All the pretty packaging made $25,000 for school seem pretty inviting, they didn't tell me I'd become an expendable part in one of the world's biggest murderjng machines. All my friends warned me but I went ahead and signed the papers anyway. My conscience was still with me a little bit when I took my job. I became a mechanic. I figured you really can’t hurt anyone just by working on trucks. (I wish your issue #41 had come out earlier.) After reading #41 and talking a lot more with friends and doing some heavy soul searching on my part, I finally realized the actuality of my mistake and understood that no matter what my job was I would still be helping the machine run that much more smoothly. Now I’ve just been assigned to a nuclear missile unit in West Germany. I feel like a piece of hypocritical trash! How can I say I'm for peace when I’m part of a war institution? I’m doing whatever I can against the missiles: demonstrations w / the Germans, etc. but I still am a part of it and I hate it. To top it all off, the army is one of the worst places to be a punk (aside from ethical reasons discussed above). There is an incredible amount of extremely closed-minded, hypo- critically religious, ’’good-ole-boy\", prejudiced (against anything not like them), woman degrading, super capitalist, \"kill a commie for mommie” - assholes in the army. I’m not saying there's not some real jerks in the underground scene nor am I saying that I haven't met some really cool people in the army who are sort of in the same situation as me. I am saying that of all the places I've been, I've never been more \"persecuted” than here. I’m used to getting hassled about my clothes, music, tastes, etc. but this place is ridiculous and I've got to live here all of the time for the next 3 years. So, as a warning - I say to everyone who is even just toying with the idea of joining the service - DON'T DO IT!!! There's always some other way just take some time and look at all of your alternatives. Granted, money and a job and foreign travel and all of those lies look attractive, but it's not worth it - trust me. I would like to end on a positive note. I've stumbled on a fantastic scene here in the town (Heilbronn) where I’m stationed. There’s not a lot of clubs and shows are few and far in between. There's not even a really good record store in town. What there is is a real friendship and brotherly love between the punks here. It really blew me away especially coming from a scene in the States where there was a lot of fighting and bitterness between people, and where there was the attitude that you had to \"prove yourself to be a 'punk' or you just didn’t belong\" while here this scene at least the punks accepted me right off (even though I’m in the army) and have really been good friends to me.

Love, and plenty of thanks, Tommy Stupid/ 5, Warrington Rd./ Ipswich, Suffolk IP130U/U.K. Dear MRR, This letter goes out to all the skins who have happened to look at our EP insert. The drawing on the lyric sheet was graphically anti-skin. The picture was drawn by a friend of the band and was meant as a joke. Being people who don't like to piss others off, we hoped that people would see the funny side of it and laugh along with us. Anyway, we put it in without the proper forethought and some got offended. To those, we apologize. This letter is not written out of fear it's just that we have the balls and brains to admit our fuck-ups. Future copies will not have this picture on the insert in the hopes that it will resolve any differences between us. If we pissed you off, we’re sorry. -Impulse Manslaughter Dear MRR, We are SCRAPS, a french HC band and we want to tour the UK in July. Above all we are searching for squat-alternative gigs organizers Write us. SCRAPS c/o Radio Campus/ Raw Power/ Umversite Des Scienes/ 5G655 Villeneuve d'Ascq/ France Hello MRR, I'm writing to you because I want to inform you that you wrote the wrong address in MRR 44 as to the distribution of the compilation record Sutura Eterna. The right address is: Camnasio G. Luca/ Via L. Da Vinci 1/ 22060 Vighizzolo di Cantu/ Como, Italy. Dear MRR, This letter is to any American promoters, zine editors or punks who can help the Canadian HC band HYPE with its upcoming U.S. tour in support of their new LP. HYPE has done a Canadian tour but is lacking in solid contacts in the U.S.A., so if anyone can help us out with info, bookings, etc., it would be greatly appreciated. We are mainly concerned with contacts east of and including Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. So, if you're in any position to help us out thru middle America and the eastern seaboard states, please let us know. Let's see the real Can- Am free trade! Don/ Rueben Kincade Productions/ P.O. Box 1195 MPO/ Hamilton^Ont L8N 4B4/ Canada. P.S. To anyone who wrote us but did not get a reply. ..the HYPE house burned down this summer and with it a lot of our mail and lists. Please write again! Tragic but true! Dear MRR, I would like to take this opportunity and use your glorious publication to thank everyone, absoloutley everyone, look here 'bro I mean everyone who helped us on our world wide tour of America. Let me tell you, it was an experience !!! From being gloated at by dubious types of Dear Tommy, Am glad the tour went well and am really hopeful you make it to the West Coast this summer. Meanwhile though, if you could forego a week's Twin kies and root beer, then maybe you could save up the $20 for that ad. See ya soon, Tim. Dear MRR, l am writing because there is something we feel the punks and the headbangers of the U.S. (who came to see our recent tour) should know. Firstly, before we played our first gig in the U.K., Garry, Nick and myself all stated to the fabulous (I don’t think) Cal that we wanted to play some old songs because we knew his vocals to the new songs were shit. But Cal, being the main man, said \"no way.\" He \"didn't want to be associated with those morons\" (quote) anymore. So we played 4 gigs in England and got the same response as in the States, after the London gig we told Cal we’ve gotta do some old songs. He agreed !!!!?? It turned out he'd only do \"State Violence” and he sang his fuckin' weirdo voice to it. Jesus & me & Nick weren't in a position to argue as we were newcomers to the band and Garry joined when I did. We jetted over to the U.S. totally depressed but we had to do the tour. After the 3rd. date, the 3 of us decided Cal has got to go. And we had to finish the rest of the 4 weeks tour. So, after San Francisco and Sacramento we decided (Me, Nick, Garry) to go back on again and play some old songs with no vocals which pissed Cal off but it let the audience know that something was stirring in the band. Anyway, in Winnipeg Garry told Cal we were kicking him out (this is after 4 weeks of continual arguments with him about his voice) so we got home in one piece and of course the talentless wanker was given the boot. What I’m getting at is all the people who came to see us and threw shit at us had only heard his voice the once - what about us ?? We had 5 weeks of it continually. So now we have a new singer, we've put a load of old stuff in the set plus altered the vocals of Grave New World . Also, we’ve got some mega golden oldies in the set - so \"Never Again\" will the people of the U.S. and England have to put up with his wailing voice. (Was that a clue ?) I know you people at Max R & R are totally pissed off with DISCHARGE but you didn't know what was going on Yours sincerely , Steve (ex-SKEPTlX) Hi all, my name’s Sylvia. Me and my Mom are going to try to organize a protest against the Hollister, California Animal Shelter. My Mom lives down there (I’m moving there late January) and she recently learned that the shelter is selling the animals to universities and laboratories for experiments. Anyone from the area (San Juan Bautista, Gilroy, Salinas, etc.) that would like to get involved please contact me. I don't know anyone from around there, so any help, input, suggestions, ect. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot. Sylvia Rowe/233 High St./ Modesto, CA 95354 Greetings MRR, I have a problem you might help me with. I am trying to respond to a letter in #42 from Mas Yoy in Sacramento, CA. It was in response to Reid's letter in #38. I sent a letter to the address indicated and it was returned \"NOT KNOWN\". It is very important I get through to this person. Do you think the address (P.O.B. 1163571/ Sacramento, CA 95816) could have been misprinted? If you have no other address, could you please find space for this in hopes that said person will see it and write to me? Thanks much! Beastingly, Rick da Be@st/ Beast Productions/ P.O.B. 2842/ Winter Park, FL 32790. Dear MRR, I'm trying to locate 2 people who sent off for the S.A.S. EP to me about a year ago. I sent the EPs, but they were returned to me, presumably because the two people in question had moved house. Anyway, their names are Arthur Shane (who used to live in Tempe) and Skot Pelkey (who used to live in Pismo Beach). Please you guys, if you're reading this, send $2 to my new address (at the bottom of this letter) to cover postage to you again - and send my your new addresses, and then I'll send you your EPs. I have reserved them for you - they're the last 2 copies I have, the rest were sold out about 8 months ago. Also, while I'm at it, I might as well mention the new label that I’ve set up with a couple of friends - it's called Loony Tunes Records, and the first release is a comp EP called Splitting Headache . on a Sunday Afternoon . We're looking for bands from all over the world for future projects, so why not write? There's lots of stuff in the pipeline. We also run a non-profit distribution, so if you want anything selling in the U.K. at cheap prices, then get in touch, OK? Thanks for the space. Bobs/ Top Flat/ 23 The Esplanade/ Scarborough, N. Yorks/ YO1 1 2AQ, England. Dear MRR and readers: Tomorrow may just seem like another day to many people, but not for me. Two hours ago I shaved my hair on the sides of my head. Sure, that may not seem too \"wild\" to many of you \"big city punks\", but for me, it is! When I was finished shaving the hair off my head, I looked in the mirror and said to myself, \"boy, am I ever being weird.\" Then I paused and said to myself, \"No, I am just being myself!\" Anyways, what I am trying to say is that you should try to be yourself, no matter where you are or who you are. I can't wait to find out how tomorrow will be, and if you write me, I'll tell you what happened, OK? Write: Roy Liang/ Box 214/ Gimli, Manitoba/ ROC 1B0/ Canada. Dear Maximum Rock'n'Roll, The February 1987 \"New York City Scene Report\" was a joy to behold, and reading it wasn't bad either. It is a pleasure, indeed, to see incisive, coherent, creative and in-depth reporting in your fine magazine-aside from which, writing articles keeps kids off the streets. Yours truly, Barbara Gurwitz/ Mew York/ George's mother. MRR - This is in response to a letter from Sean Duffy in #45. His letter was a response to some complaints that BGK made against a club in Chicago called the Metro where he sets up shows. I not only want to defend BGK’s complaints but also bring out a few of my own that've been brewing for quite some time. First of all, BGK claimed that the Metro wouldn't allow people to bring in anti-fascist/ anti-Klan flyers. Sean claims it’s because people were bringing in racist/ fascist flyers so the Metro banned all flyers. He also says that MDC threw anti-racist graffiti stuff off the stage at the BGK show. Well the only reason MDC got to throw that stuff off the stage was because they smuggled it in in their guitar cases after somebody gave it to them and explained that the Metro wouldn't let them in with it. Sean also claims that people are allowed to pass out flyers outside the club and down the block . HAH! You can't even wait outside the club for a friend because there are always huge burly bouncers patrolling the block forcing you to vacate the premises IMMEDIATELY after a show. Before a show there are more of the same bouncers outside making sure everybody stands in an orderly line waiting to get inside so you can pay loads of money for the privilege of being searched and sneered at by yet even more bouncers. I have never personally experienced bouncer violence but I've witnessed plenty of it and at least one band has told me they were harassed backstage. Granted, not all the bouncers are missing their brains, some of them are decent enough and some are almost pleasant but some of them need to be returned to the ape house before the zoo notices that they’re missing. These complaints are all actually very minor but they lead into my main complaint - the Metro is solely concerned with making money, and lots of it, off the punk scene. I think that the flyer issue has nothing to do with racism. If the Metro was truly concerned with the issue of racism then they would let the racists distribute their flyers, first of all because it would make the people aware that there is a very real problem out there and it's breathing down their necks. It would also give the anti-racists an opportunity to confront the racists face to face. Banning racist material from the club is not going to solve anything. I think the real reason that the Metro bans flyers is that most of them are for shows at places other than the Metro. They're not concerned so much with promoting an alternative/ underground scene as they are with making money off it. I want to make it clear that this is not a personal attack on Sean Duffy. He's put a lot of work into the scene and I know from personal experience that there are loads of hassles attached to promoting shows and it's often a thankless and disillusioning job. The fact that he's kept at it for so long feads me to believe that he must care an awful lot about the scene. Blit Sean, what’s the deal? Isn't it blatantly obvious that the Metro is just using the whole scene for its own purposes? It’s all just a big disgusting business venture. Chicago is a big city, there must be someplace else that's not so concerned with leeching off the scene. I realize there are other people out there who've been putting on shows in other places and I hope you keep it up. It was the atmosphere at those types of shows that first drew me into the scene before I ever like the music. I hope that there will always be these alternatives in the future. Elayne/ 428 Sunset Dr./ Wilmette, IL 60091 . P.S. Thanks to BGK for realizing the importance of avoiding places like the Metro.

Tim Hello MRR, Thanks for the story on the plight of a little or Rock and Roll hall in the deep South-the Metroplex. All the hard work payed off. Permits are no longer required in Atlanta except for Adult Entertainment employees. Thanks to City Councilman Bill Campbell and the realization of the rest of the City Council that the ordinance was unenforcible and unconstitutional. However, Jim Fleter, co-owner of the Otherside Bar & Grill, is still facing battery charges on January 28. Hopefully, the success of the moment will carry. City Councilman Dozier Smith, who proposed the ordinance, knew that the main reason for enforcing this law would be to stop drug trafficking through Adult Entertainment spots, not the Metroplex. Consequently, Smith's district encompasses a number of Adult Entertainment bars. The Atlanta Police Bureau's Liquor Permits Division jumped on the opportunity to try and close the Metroplex, the only all-ages venue with a stage room that is all-ages (no alcohol) with a full-service bar on the otherside, seperated by a grill and a wall. Smith said that Lt. Lee, head of the Permits Division, asked him to propose the ordinance. Many Metroplex employees and patrons feel that the police used this ordinance to close down a liberal venue that is within the law. Little did the fascist police know that Atlanta's music scene is a force to be reckoned with. Lisa Bishop, Metroplex bartender Dear MRR and Readers, I've passively sat by and read a number of \"Falwell Game\" letters that have been in this zine for quite some time, and now I've finally got to voice my opinion. In a zine that carries the many varied \"Punk-Hardcore\" messages of freedom, individuality, acceptance and unity it is startling to see the continued acceptance and apparent promulgation of these childish games that seem to be based on religious prejudice. As an atheist I am humored by Falwell and his cronies, and publications such as the Plain Truth, but it angers me to see people trying to destroy the religious fanatics by playing these games. This is not a situation like free phone calls or glued stamps that have been associated with hardcore, because any harm that results here is incidental and not the primary cause for action. In an underground that 1 perceive to be dedicated towards progression it upsets me to see so many involved in trying to hold others back. I certainly do pity those who have been taken in by religious scams, but I pity those whose actions are devoted to playing games with these people even more. It seems to me that the efforts these people must go through to get 60 tapes from the Mormons or cause Falwell a $1 million bill on his 800# could be used in a way to help themselves and others. For those who can’t find something to do after kicking the harassment habit, just leaf through the pages of this zine, ’cause there are plenty of good ideas in these pages. Stick Tight, Dave Stein/ P.O. Box 22279/ Albany, NY P.S. For shows in Albany, NY write or call (578) 465-9475. Dear MRR, Good news Falwell haters, Jerry has a toll free # back and needs more money. Let's try to make sure he does not get it. I know we can do it. The # is 1-800-322-6722. We did it before and I hope now we can do it again. Your friend, C.D.

On the one side it shows that the freedom you nave in your persona! life can manifest itself through music That s why Emma wants to be more than a concert hall. Emma wants (via the music programming, but also for example, through exhibitions) to support activities and initiatives which come out of a movement. A hall like Emma, out of (political) choice, takes part in initiatives like putting out independent records and promoting, distributing and selling them Such activities show that it can also be done without commercial interference and apart from the established music industry. Cultural freedom is a weapon for you and others to help create what you need to feel independent For this you don't have to go around preaching the world revolution (because then you nave to wait a little while). You don t have to set out the task of immediately overthrowing the entire music industry or society. And it s not really necessary Because whet's more fun than getting in their way? So, see you in the noise barricades Or in Emma For example. -P S Idiot (April '86 - From the Emma Compilation) This record is a historical document of the now closed Emma, it has been replaced by the new Van Han in which the seme spirit lives Also available faith NO MORE- we Care A Lot LP.

(OVERSEAS AND CANADA) c PLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS r COLUMN 9 opinions exoressed are those of the c columnists In the last 20 years or so there has been something terribly wrong with our government. I don't know if we have been Red to all along or if we’ve just been aware of it recently. According to some people many years my senior there was actually a time when when you could believe what the government told you and that the little signs you see that the government approved meant something. If you were an American in a foreign country you gained respect. Recently it seems that the seal of \"made in America* is almost a guarentee of how to \"cut comers\", and American tourists in Europe don’t even admit to being American if they speak another language for fear of bodily harm. If I am not a manufacturer or have never been to Europe why should I be lumped into the decadent American stereotype? Tne answers lies within our government. The American People are identified with the shortcomings of the government, the same way in which the media portrays the people of the Soviet Union, (as communists out to take over the world.) The rest of the world sees Americans as egomaniacs and hipocrites. With the growing internal problems that the Reagan administration and previous administrations have experienced, it's time to for a massive overhaul on Capitol Hill. We have seen that Reagan has delagated responsibility so much that things have gotten out of hand. If you have ever listened to one of his speeches, ne double talks worse than any other politician I've ever seen. It has also become quite apparent that one man, the president, can not have a thorough working knowledge of economics, foreign policy, domestic affairs, military strategy and women’s rights. Each one of these fields has its own experts that advise the president; this is a community called the Cabinet. But, now it seems that our leader is so uninformed that even advice such as the Cabinet's doesn’t quite help. The world is getting more and more violent and with the political and social web that has been woven nobody should expect one man to be in charge. Even with the Congress as a watchdog, I think that the presidency should be run by more than one person from different political backgrounds. After all, major companies have a board of directors and the Supreme Court has nine justices. Each person would be a specialist in a different field, and each person would have a cabinet of advisors. Before a major decision is made, they would all convene then approach Congress. This system would take the strain off of one person. It would also alleviate the interjection of personal inequities like those of Reagan's— toward abortion and prayer in school. This idea is still a democracy and people would still vote as usual. This system is not perfect, though it would call for the irradication of personal ego trips and lust for power gains which have become a trademark of politics. ’’The panel system\" would also require the complete trust of each member between themselves. (Maybe I'm asking too much of polticians.) With this panel system of government each specialist would work in his or her field and all problems in our country that need immediate attention would receive. Domestic affairs will not run second fiddle to overthrow of foreign governments on the executive agenda. There is only 24 hours in a day, and 8 are spent sleeping-one man can’t cover everything. When you think about it, being the president of the United States is a really thankless job. And over the last few years each president has become less effective in holding together the integrity of the United States, both internally and abroad. My brief outline is very general and basic. I am not a politician nor an intellectual. Maybe I’m oversimplifying a major problem, but if the system stays the same as it is now - where people aren’t told the whole story - and laughed at by the rest of the world, then you know it’s time for a change. Finally, I'm not a communist, anarchist, or conservative. I'm an American and at this point, like many other people, not very proud of it. I have no other place to go, and would love to see our country regain some of the integrity it has lost. I’m just exercising my freedom of the press - and who knows - that may someday be gone too ! I was not meant to be a columnist. I can't stand meeting these deadlines, and I think faster than I can write. Thus being unable to communicate sound thought I suffer you through this intangible mess. Exposing my own confusion as a source from which you can add to your own. Now this doesn't seem very beneficial to either party. However on occasion I am struck by a thought that works its way into words that I feel should be liberated from confines of my head. Being lucky as I am to have this block of printed words in which to place these fine thoughts, I will try my best to continue making sense. I make no promises, since it is unlikely that they will be kept. The last thine I remember writing made so little sense that i have chosen to forget it. If this ever sees print it might be a good idea to forget it as well. Recently I was asked to leave a restaurant at which I was a fairly regular customer, for having the gall to dye my hair blue. They apparently had just come up with a new rule about however much I planned on spending there was below their minimum, hne witn me. I’m sorry for the poor people whose dinner was ruined by my unsightly appearance, as I recall there were only four of them in the whole restaurant at the time. I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank the waiter for the water which he served me and also the manager for saving me some money, I went home and ate some bread. I admit at the time I was a little angry, but in retrospect it makes me feel assured that the way I am is the right way to be. It makes sense that if I reject society, society in turn will reject me. Wnat bothers me now is where now to draw the line between society and humanity. It takes humans to make societies, in fact we all exist in some form of society, whether it is the mainstream, the underground, the in between, the tribal, or whatever. It is all some form of social interaction, based loosely on some sort of common interest or predicament. The line is harder to draw if it is highlighted by the ever present element of bureaucracy, the wonderful ability of humans to complicate things with their own opinions, greed, and lack of consideration. To which side does it most apply - humanity or society? If one could write it off to society and its apparent evils, then fine, we reject society, become hermits or nomads and live life happily. On the other hand these ^problems are brought into this social connection by individual people, thus making a firm link with humanity, flow then does one reject humanity and continue to function on this planet? I suppose the quick witted would all shout ’suicide’ were tnis a speech to a live audience, but I don't count cop outs as relevant answers so back to square one. It seems there is a problem, the only answer I can find is - you can’t. Why even try? It isn't even the point. The new problem is if you can't separate society from humanity, how can you eliminate the bureaucracy? This is starting to get like algebra. I didn t do so well in algebra, and think my questions are leading us into a blind alley. Now we are in the same place. I’ve been here for a while without making much headway. With this on my mind as well as the weight of many other dilemnas I was just about to break out the survival gear and head for the woods. I was practically on my way out the door when I received a letter from my friend Susanne from Amsterdam. She was responding to my last attempt at making sense that was published in this fine magazine. In the letter, after telling me about her own confusion with the state of things, she went on to tell how she dealt with all the turmoil of trying to coexist with other people. Basically she wrote about finding the right balance between the time you give to others and the time you save for yourself. It was a lot more detailed but this was the point that found me reevaluating my own situation and realising that it was not a hopeless situation I was in. 1 found out by removing myself from the line of fire whenever it was starting to overtake my resistance that I was able to sustain my strength against the constant pressures of life.Through this reinforcement of my self value I was able to rid myself of a lot bureaucratic hell that was only serving to steal away my sanity (if you could call it tnat). Not that this is some amazing discovery never before made aware to mankind, but that in times of confusion the logical actions are the hardest to see. I have learned that the value of communication is the sharing of ideas, and that is the point of society that! for one cannot reject. I was madder than Ed Meese getting caught at a peep show with his cock in his hand. Here are these self-righteous cretins accusing me of repeating myself and then they go out and do exactly the opposite of what I said in the first place. Of course I repeat myself: if you didn’t get it the first time, I have to try again. So, after over 30 columns we’re still stuck on the \"What is Punk?” problem. Most recently we've seen it emerge here in New York with the Chris Williamson Rock Hotel shows. (I just went to one last night, by the way - Leeway, SNFU, Bad Brains and somebody I missed. First time I'd seen SNFU - WOW!) In addition to the letter he wrote to MRR (2 issues ago), Chris again agreed to speak to the APRC about \"the problem\". This time, Dan, the editor of Smash Apathy, had the balls to show up to face the person he was accusing. He denied previous rumors that he was \"intimidated\" from going to the last press conference. There were a few concrete issues - nasty bouncers, press & radio treatment, ad screw-ups. I don’t want to go into those details here, I think Jim Testa would be the best one to contact for the hard facts. I want to talk about the soft \"ideological\" stuff that was behind it all. Dan brought up the fact that the shows were big. \"You want small shows?\" said Chris, \"put on small shows.” Dan didn't know about that. Dan said that things weren't political. Chris said, \"You're right! Yeah, we put on M DC (snickers from the crowd), CCM, and others, but we're not political. Our concern is about the music.\" Dan seemed to think this was bad. He suggested Chris do political shows. \"Okay,” said Chris, surprising everyone, ’’you find me the place willing to do it and the right cause and i'll put on the show.” Dan didn't know about that either. \"You're making too much money,\" said Dan. \"Punk rock isn’t about making money.\" \"On a sell-out show, I make about $1000,” said Chris. \"I’ll be glad to give you an itemized account. On lots of shows I lose big bucks - but the bands always get paid.” Dan shook his head, not knowing about that. Chris was obviously frustrated. \"What should I do?\" he asked. \"Pull out.\" said Dan. About that time, I was wishing Dan's father had done exactly that some twenty years ago. Here was a guy, Chris, who came to New York as a musician, got caught up in the Disco scene, hated it and decided to do something for himself. He worked years and did it. Now some kid with either rich parents or a job he hates is telling him to quit. Of course things didn't get much further, but the issues were clear. There are two sets of people: one side thinks that punk rock is whatever people who like punk rock say it is. It can be big or small, cheap or expensive, fun or serious, political or musical or any combination. On the other side there are the anarchists who believe that punk is a whole set of complicated rules and that if they aren't followed to the letter, the violator is somehow a traitor and \"not a real punk”. With the former group it doesn't matter, but the latter group has a problem. How do you know if someone is a real punk or not? I mean, you could be talking to tnis person you think is perfectly nice and then find out sne's \"rippine off the scene.\" You just NEVER I pondered this problem for awhile and then it hit me! How do Masons know if a person is a Mason? How do your frat brothers at your local college campus know if someone is a brother? MEMBERSHIP CARDS and SECRET HANDSHAKES!!! Why not do the same for punk rock? I can't describe my plan for a secret handshake - there are too many poseurs, capitalists and opportunist spies reading this zine. But I can describe what you’ve got to do and believe in order to qualify for a membership card. And what happens when that card gets invalidated. The underlying premise is that person is either neutral, or (in honor of Dan) a member of People United Not Knowing Stuff (P.U.N.K.S.) or those Ripping Off The Scene (R.O.T.S.) P.U.N.K.S. get membership cards. R.O.T.S. have their memberships cancelled and are boycotted. So, in order to help the anarchists do what they like most - make rules - 1 will propose a few for starters. 1. P.U.N.K.S., if they play in bands are allowed to make money "
