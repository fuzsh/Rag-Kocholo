        "text": "Common Elements of School Health Services\n\nAlthough a universally accepted definition of the term ''school health services\" has not been adopted, the School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS) has described school health services as a \"coordinated system that ensures a continuum of care from school to home to community health care provider and back\" (Small et al., 1995). The goals and program elements of school health services vary at the state, community, school district, and individual school levels. Some of the factors that contribute to these variations include student needs, community resources for health care, available funding, local preference, leadership for providers of school health services, and the view of health services held by school administrators and other key decisionmakers in the school systems.\n\nThere is similarity, however, in the types of services offered from one school system to the next, which is likely the result of several factors. A majority of states have state school nurse consultants, many of whom have distributed sample policy and procedure manuals from their state department of health or education or both, to guide the development and delivery of health services in local settings. The National Association of School Nurses has defined roles and standards for school nurses (Proctor et al., 1993) and provides a system for disseminating information and training to nurses who practice in schools. The American School Food Service Association has recently released standards for school foodservice and nutrition practices (American School Food Service Association, 1995). Similarly, organizations such as the National Association of School Psychologists, the American School Counselor Association, and the National Association of Social Workers have published position statements and standards for their professions. The American School Health Association (ASHA), through its interdisciplinary committees, has studied the advantages and disadvantages of different services, the organization and delivery of services, and the roles of various school health service providers. Subsequently, ASHA publications have brought this information to the attention of state and local health and education agencies. The American Academy of Pediatrics, working closely with national representatives of the school health services sector as well as the community health system, periodically updates a school health manual, School Health: Policy and Practice , that serves both as another unifying force and as an informal mechanism for ensuring local program quality (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1993). Within this document are the following seven goals of a school health program:\n\nView in own window\n\nGoal 1 Ensure access to primary health care. 1 Goal 2 Provide a system for dealing with crisis medical situations.Goal 3 Provide mandated screening and immunization monitoring.Goal 4 Provide systems for identification and solution of students' health and educational problems.Goal 5 Provide comprehensive and appropriate health education.Goal 6 Provide a healthful and safe school environment that facilitates learning.Goal 7 Provide a system of evaluation of the effectiveness of the school health program.\n\nGoals 1–4 and 7 are of particular relevance to school health services.\n\nRecently, findings from national surveys conducted by the Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of School Health at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, and other groups show that most schools do provide some type of school health services and that a degree of consistency does exist in the kinds of services delivered from one school system to the next. According to SHPPS (Small et al., 1995), 86 percent of all middle or junior high and senior high schools provide some type of school health services (first aid, screening, medication administration), although 32 percent of all middle/junior and senior high schools do not have a dedicated health services facility, such as a separate health room or clinic. SHPPS reports that most school districts require screening and follow-up in at least one grade, with vision (96 percent), hearing (95.4 percent), and scoliosis (88.2 percent) being the most common of the required screenings. Almost all districts keep student health records on file and monitor student immunization status, and most districts also keep student medical emergency and medical information forms on file.\n\nThe University of Colorado Health Sciences Center's survey, entitled A Closer Look, examined a systematic random sample of public school districts nationwide for the 1993–1994 school year (Davis et al., 1995). One goal of the survey was to determine the type of health services provided in schools, types of school health services personnel, methods of governance and financing, organizational structures for the delivery of services in and outside of school, and barriers to services. The Closer Look survey provided the profile of the types of school health services currently delivered across the country, as shown in .\n\nTABLE 4-1\n\nHealth Services Provided in the Schools.\n\nAccording to A Closer Look, two health services appear to be provided almost universally by school districts, first aid (98.7 percent) and administration of medications (97.1 percent). Other commonly provided services include such health screenings as height, weight, vision, and hearing (86.8 percent); child abuse evaluations and follow-up (82.8 percent); and evaluation of emotional or behavioral problems (80 percent). The three next most commonly provided services are for children with special needs: monitoring of vital signs (77.7 percent), application and cleaning of dressings (76.8 percent), and development of the health component of the Individualized Education Plan (75.6 percent). In view of the health problems cited in earlier chapters of this report, it is interesting to note that only slightly more than half of the districts were found to provide mental health counseling and nutrition counseling, and less than 40 percent con duct health risk appraisal to determine life-style practices. The committee has not attempted to reconcile these figures with those reported by SHPPS, which states that 89.2 percent of senior high schools and 84.4 percent of middle or junior high schools provide individual counseling. The latter figures could refer to counseling with primarily an academic focus, which schools may be more inclined to offer, although there is certainly overlap between academic and mental health problems. Data from A Closer Look indicate that the types of services available to students do not appear to vary substantially by the size of the school district.\n\nHealth Care Services\n\nNurses and Nurse Practitioners\n\nServices Provided. School nurses are the traditional \"backbone\" of school health services and are often the only health care providers at the school site on a regular basis. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, standards for school nursing have been established by the National Association of School Nurses. The school nurse typically provides population-based primary prevention and health care services, including\n\nphysical and mental health assessment and referral for care;\n\ndevelopment and implementation of health care plans for students with special health care needs;\n\nhealth counseling;\n\nmandated screenings, such as vision, hearing, and immunization status;\n\nmonitoring the presence of infectious conditions among students and enforcing public health precautions to prevent spread of infections and infestations;\n\nskilled nursing services for students with complex health care needs;\n\ncase management of students with chronic and special health care needs;\n\noutreach to students and their families;\n\ninterpretation of the health care needs of students to school personnel;\n\ndevelopment and implementation of emergency care plans and provision of emergency care and first aid;\n\nserving as liaison for the school, parents, and community health agencies;\n\ncollaboration with other school professionals—particularly counselors, psychologists, and social workers—to address the health, developmental, and educational needs of students; and\n\nfor nurse practitioners only, the provision of primary care, including prescribing medications when allowed under the State Nurse Practice Act.\n\nThe traditional model for school nursing provides for a school nurse, typically in an office or health room, with or without an aide. The National Association of School Nurses and other organizations in the National Nursing Coalition for School Health have prepared and distributed standards of nursing practice that guide the services nurses deliver in schools (Proctor et al., 1993). A single nurse may also be shared among several schools. In School Health: Policy and Practice, the American Academy of Pediatrics has analyzed the various nurse staffing patterns which are listed in .\n\nTABLE 4-3\n\nNursing Staffing Patterns for School Health Services.\n\nPersonnel. The professional training required for school nurses varies, depending on location and changing economic conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics (1993) reported in 1993 that only 38 states required school nurses to be registered nurses, and only 19 required the attainment of specific school nurse certification. SHPPS found that although only 8 percent of all states required school nurses to be certified through the American Nurses Association or the National Association of School Nurses, 62 percent of states offered their own certification for school nurses. Of those states offering certification, 66 percent required it for employment as a school nurse. Health aides are employed in 76 percent of states, but only 8 percent of these states required prior technical training for health aides (Small et al., 1995). The Closer Look investigation reports similar findings.\n\nIn some school districts, school nurses are employees of the school system; in others, school nurses are provided by the local health department or another agency. The National Association of School Nurses recommends a ratio of one school nurse per 750 students. In recent years, there has been interest in expanding the school nursing function through the use of nurse practitioners, nurses with additional training (generally at the master's level) who are certified by state laws to provide a range of primary care services. School-based nurse practitioners can perform physical examinations, prescribe certain medications with physician protocols, and frequently serve as the anchor provider in school-based clinics. The drive for independence from physicians has characterized the nurse practitioner movement (Clawson and Osterweis, 1993); however, school-based nurse practitioners usually have a backup relationship with a licensed physician in the community. Other graduate programs prepare school nurses for administrative and management roles, as well as for mental health positions in schools.\n\nImportant Issues. The emergence of the nurse practitioner role has broadened the possible functions of school nurses. However, budget constraints have led to the elimination of school nursing in some school districts. In other districts, a single nurse is shared among several schools, with health aides, clerical staff, or volunteers serving when the nurse is not available. Concern has been raised that the absence of a trained health care provider on-site could lead to unfortunate consequences in an emergency situation or in the supervision of students with special health care needs.\n\nBurdens and responsibilities of school nurses are expanding as the increasing numbers of students with special needs and students without adequate health care and health insurance increase. School nurses must keep up with changing practices and procedures, but sometimes education in the specialty of school nursing is not readily available. In 1995, the Southern Council on Collegiate Education for Nursing, an affiliate of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), conducted a survey of 450 institutions with college-based nursing programs in SREB states4 to examine the programs of study available for school nursing. Less than 5 percent of respondents offered such programs, and less than 1 percent of faculty have school nurse practitioner credentials (Strickland, 1995).\n\nAnother issue of importance to school nursing is the linkage of nursing services to other school health providers in order to form an integrated services team. Continued examination is also needed of the relative value of such primary prevention efforts as appropriate screenings for vision, hearing, growth, and eating disorders; early identification of individual students at risk for physical and mental health problems; development and implementation of safety programs; and case management of students with chronic diseases. Finally, of special concern to school nurses is the tailoring of school health services to local community needs through the formation of school or community planning councils and the use of needs assessments to guide planning efforts. These concerns and other priority issues were the topic of an invitational conference on school nursing in 1994, which called for more appropriate and greater access to educational opportunities for school nurses, the support of additional outcomes-based research, and the need for further policy development regarding the role of the school nurse in supervising unlicensed assistive personnel in the care of students (National Nursing Coalition for School Health, 1995).\n\nPhysicians\n\nServices Provided. While the number and role of \"school physicians,\" per se have declined over the years, physicians have increasingly been assuming roles as consultants and advocates. Physicians are involved in schools and school health programs from many vantage points, including serving as public health officials to university teachers and researchers and as generalist and specialist providers of direct patient services. The services they provide include consultation on health policy, health curricula, and evaluation of programs and services; direct consultation regarding individual patients or groups of patients; and participation in provision of health services at the school site. Asthma specialists have set up asthma education programs, orthopedic surgeons have set up scoliosis screening and sports medicine programs, and pediatricians have advocated for and helped to develop sexuality education and health education programs. With the recent emphasis on education for all students with disabilities, the diagnosis of conditions and review of programs for these students have become additional responsibilities. Community primary care physicians (pediatricians and family physicians) frequently interact with the schools' health programs as linkages to ancillary services for their patients' medical, learning, and behavioral problems. They also assist with assessing community health needs and resources and devising mechanisms to coordinate school and community services.\n\nPersonnel. The training and certification of physicians who interact with the schools depends on their own discipline and specialty rather than standards of the school health program. Many pediatric residencies now offer community pediatrics experiences that often include school health. New residency requirements, which were put into effect in 1996, specify a defined community pediatrics experience in order for a program to meet American Academy of Pediatrics Board requirements. Physicians are typically not employees of the school system; instead, their services are usually provided by contractual agreements with hospitals, universities, clinics, and HMOs. Insurance and malpractice issues usually dictate that their source of employment be able to handle such coverage for physician activities routinely.\n\nImportant Issues. As described in Chapter 2, physicians have been active in school health programs to varying degrees since the mid-nineteenth century. The boundaries between private medical practice and school health programs, which arose during the period of the National Education Association–American Medical Association alliance from the 1920s to the 1960s, are now beginning to disappear, and schools are receiving increased attention as strategic sites for health promotion and access points for primary care. In order to meet these demands, expanded and improved education in school health is needed in the medical and residency education of physicians. In addition, mechanisms and incentives are needed for effectively involving community providers of primary and secondary health care with school programs, both in direct provision of care and in consultative roles.\n\nInnui (1992) has pointed out that there is a social contract between the public and the medical field; optimal medical practice and research should not be thought of as ends in themselves but rather as means to sustaining the health of the population. Physicians, especially pediatricians, meet this social contract by working in the societal domain outside the usual practice setting; work in or for schools is a prime example. There is a strong subset among those concerned with the future of the medical field who believe that it is an increasingly important responsibility of medicine to prepare physicians to work in the social domain, including schools (Elias et al., 1994).\n\nDentists\n\nEarlier in this century, many schools had established dental clinics, but in recent years schools have typically provided only a low level of dental services. Still, dental health needs are pressing. Dental services often are not covered by insurance, and families postpone seeking preventive treatment until more expensive services are necessary. Many children and young people, especially in disadvantaged and rural areas, have no access to a family dentist. As a result, a few school-based clinics have added dental services to their protocols.\n\nA 1992 survey of 87 school districts selected as exemplary models for school health programs, conducted by the National School Boards Association, revealed that about one-half provided some type of dental services (Poehlman and Manager, 1992). A follow-up survey (with a 35 percent response rate) showed that most of the activity was located in elementary schools. Three-fourths of the schools with dental services provided screening at the school, about one-fourth also offered teeth cleaning, and one in ten gave fluoride rinses or sealants for the prevention of tooth decay. Actual treatment was provided in more than one-third of the schools with dental programs, while education for dental health was offered in two-thirds. In some schools, toothbrushes and toothpaste were distributed. In others, local dentists gave presentations, contributed their services at schools, or accepted referrals with low or no fee. In some communities, a local service club was active in providing funds for school dental services.\n\nAlthough from a national perspective the oral health of children has probably never been better, it is estimated that about 80 percent of dental caries of school-age children exist in approximately 20 percent of the population—most of whom are lower-income subgroups (National Institute of Dental Research, 1995). Health examination surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics found that the most significant problems detected among U.S. children were \"dental problems\" (Starfield, 1992). The National Institute of Dental Research of the National Institutes of Health conducts a variety of research and demonstration studies and carries out periodic surveys concerning the oral health of school children. However, there do not appear to be dedicated, coherent funding streams for school dental services; rather, dental services, if they exist at all, are typically provided on a local ad hoc basis, often involving volunteers and donated or reduced-cost services.\n\nServices for Students with Special Needs\n\nIn 1975, Congress enacted the landmark Education of the Handicapped Act, which in 1990 was renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The act requires free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities, including those with physical or mental disorders, in the least restrictive setting from birth through age 21.\n\nFederal law holds all state and local education agencies responsible for formulating Individualized Education Plans for all students with disabilities and for providing the special education and related services they require. These services include everything from physical and speech therapy and psychological services to intensive nursing care and case management. Congress annually appropriates funds to help state and local education agencies carry out this mandate, but many of the costs for special education services must be financed from state and local government revenues.\n\nExamples of professionals providing these specialized services, in addition to school nurses, consulting physicians, and dietitians include the following:\n\nPhysical therapists emphasize the remediation of, or compensation for, mobility, gait, muscle strength, and postural deficits. According to the American Physical Therapy Association, 3 percent of the association's members work in schools.\n\nOccupational therapists focus on remediation of or compensation for perceptual, sensory, visual motor, fine motor, and self-care deficits. More than one-third of the membership of the American Occupational Therapy Association work in the schools.\n\nSpeech, language, and hearing therapists provide special education and related services and work closely with teachers and parents to help children overcome communication problems. More than one-half of the members of the American Speech, Language, and Hearing Association work in schools. Speech, language and hearing problems represent 25 percent of children's primary disabilities in schools; another 50 percent of children with other primary disabilities have speech, language, and hearing problems as additional disabilities.\n\nAudiologists are certified professionals who specialize in the identification and management of children's hearing impairments in the school setting. According to the Education Audiology Association, approximately 1,000 audiologists are employed by school districts across the country.\n\nAn issue of general concern in special services is the lack of trained professionals who are interested in working in the schools, for often case loads are greater and salaries lower than in other health care settings. As a result, these services sometimes are provided by paraprofessionals and assistants, under the supervision of a professional. Another issue is that eligibility of students for these services is determined by the state and/or local school system, based on recommendations of a team that may or may not include professionals in the special services fields. Further, although the special education law appears to be an entitlement, in fact, not all students with disabilities are served. Those with emotional disturbances are neglected; among those identified, less than one-third received social work, psychological, or other counseling services. Knitzer (1989) estimated that only 19 percent of students with serious emotional problems are being served.\n\nNutrition and Foodservice\n\nServices Provided. School food and nutrition services vary significantly from school to school depending on the perceived needs, resources, and priorities of schools and communities. School food- and nutrition services can be categorized as follows:\n\nfederally supported, nonprofit school lunches, breakfasts, and snacks, including those for students with special health care needs;\n\nfor-profit food programs, including snack bars, school stores, vending machines, á la carte items sold in school cafeterias, and special functions for students or staff;\n\nnutrition education activities integrated with classroom instruction;\n\nnutrition screening, assessments, and referral; and\n\nfoodservice provided for nonschool populations, including child care, Head Start, elderly feeding, summer feeding, and contract services that meet the needs of local communities.\n\nThe National School Lunch Act established the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) in 1946, both to prevent the malnutrition that was discovered in army recruits and to provide an outlet for farm surpluses. In 1970, Congress established uniform national income guidelines for free and reduced-price meals. The School Breakfast Program (SBP) was authorized as a pilot in 1966 and made permanent in 1975. All lunches and breakfasts served under the NSLP and SBP are subsidized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the form of cash reimbursements and commodities. All students are eligible to participate, although varying prices are charged based on the student's income and family size. Students whose family incomes are 130 or percent less of the poverty level qualify for free meals, whereas students with family incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty level qualify for reduced-price meals. The price for paid meals is established by the local school district. There is no federal mandate for schools to provide these school lunch or school breakfast programs, although a few states have legislation requiring schools to make lunch and/or breakfast available to students.\n\nNationwide, almost 60 percent of students eat the school lunch and about 15 percent eat the school breakfast (Food Research and Action Center, 1996). In announcing its \"Healthy Kids: Nutrition Objectives for School Meals\" initiative in June 1994, the USDA stated that the National School Lunch Program is available in 95 percent of public schools, which are attended by 97 percent of public school children, and that about 59 percent of all public school children participate (USDA, 1994). A 1993 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) study reported that 6,400 private schools, about 30 percent of the total, also offer the NSLP (U.S. GAO, 1993b). There are major differences among states in the percentage of students who eat school meals. USDA data for school year 1993 show a high of 80.5 percent of Louisiana students eating the school lunch and a low of 40.1 percent of New Jersey students doing so (USDA, 1994). In New Jersey, 53.2 percent of school lunches were served free to students, while 63.1 percent were served free in Louisiana. The average of 26 million school lunches served each day is about 1 million less than the participation rate in 1979, prior to major federal funding cuts in the 1980s.\n\nMore than 6.5 million students in almost 65,000 schools participate in the SBP, a number that has grown consistently (Food Research and Action Center, 1996). The SBP may never achieve the same level of participation as the NSLP, since almost 60 percent of students report eating breakfast at home (Burghardt and Devaney, 1993). However, many students who do not eat at home do not have access to the SBP either because it is not offered at their school or because transportation and class schedules do not allow time to eat. Studies confirm that on any given day, 12 to 26 percent of students come to school without having eaten anything (Burghardt and Devaney, 1993; Sampson et al., 1995). A significantly greater proportion of students skipping breakfast failed to achieve dietary adequacy for nearly every nutrient studied, compared to students who ate breakfast (Sampson et al., 1995). Schools that are not yet offering the SBP or those in which transportation or other problems hinder participation may want to reexamine their needs and how difficulties might be overcome.\n\nMany school cafeterias offer individual food items that students may purchase in addition to or instead of the school lunch or breakfast. These foods are described as á la carte options. Other foodservice options, such as vending machines, school stores, and snack bars, are often made available. These are sometimes operated by the school nutrition and foodservice department but are most often operated by the school principal or a school organization designated by the principal. Foods sold outside the reimbursable school lunch and school breakfast are not subject to USDA nutrition standards, with the exception that no carbonated beverages, water ices, hard candies, or chewing gum may be sold in the foodservice area (USDA, 1986). These restrictions do not apply to other areas of the school.\n\nThe use of the school cafeteria as a \"laboratory\" in which students can learn about foods and nutrition and practice decisionmaking skills learned in the classroom was called for by Congress in the Nutrition Education and Training (NET) Program. The NET Program was designed to \"teach children, through a positive daily lunchroom experience and appropriate classroom reinforcement, the value of a nutritionally balanced diet, and to develop curricula and materials for training teachers and school foodservice staff to carry out this task\" (P.L. 95-166, Child Nutrition Act as amended November 10, 1977). The provision of healthful meals in an environment that promotes healthy eating enhances the ability of the health education curriculum to achieve several of the performance indicators called for by the National Health Education Standards—including indicator 3, \"to demonstrate the ability to practice health-enhancing behaviors and reduce health risks,'' and indicator 6, \"to demonstrate the ability to use goal setting and decision-making skills to enhance health.\"\n\nConsensus on the importance of integrating nutrition screening, counseling, and referral as integral components of health services is growing. At this time, few school nutrition and foodservice departments have adequate staff to provide these services. Other school health service providers (on-site or contracted) may be responsible for screening students for nutrition problems, making referrals to qualified nutrition professionals, and providing support and reinforcement for the nutrition care provided (American Dietetic Association et al., 1995).\n\nMeals for students with special health care needs are an increasing aspect of school foodservice and nutrition programs. Although the cost of food is similar to that in regular programs, labor and administrative expenses make these meals more costly. If nutrition goals are part of an Individualized Education Plan, special education funds may be provided for costly food products and counseling. Medicaid is another potential source of funds. The family may not be charged for additional costs of meeting the dietary requirements of students with special needs.\n\nThe foodservice operation in many schools is responding to community needs, forging new partnerships, and generating new revenue by providing services for populations outside the school. Using existing space, equipment, and personnel, schools can often provide meals for elderly feeding, summer feeding, child and adult day care, and other community groups. Some schools have even developed large catering operations for public events.\n\nPersonnel. As early as the 1930s, major teacher training institutions established a curriculum in school foodservice. When the National School Lunch Act was passed in 1946 and school foodservice and nutrition emerged as a profession, dietitians and home economists were the early leaders (Frank et al., 1987). At the present time, USDA has no specific requirements for school foodservice and nutrition program directors or managers. A 1993 survey by the National Food Service Management Institute found that 2.6 percent of directors had less than a high school education, 38.8 percent had a high school diploma, 19.9 percent had taken some college courses, 23.3 percent had a college degree, and 15.5 percent had earned a graduate degree (Sneed and White, 1993). According to SHPPS, few states or local school districts have established standards for school foodservice directors, and only 2.8 percent of directors are registered dietitians (Pateman et al., 1995). If nutrition screening, assessments, and counseling are provided by the school, consulting dietitians, nurses, or public health staff are often used.\n\nImportant Issues. There is consensus today that school nutrition and foodservices are important to learning readiness, health promotion, and disease prevention (National Research Council, 1989; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988, 1991). The Healthy People 2000 goals call for at least 90 percent of school lunch and breakfast services to be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and for at least 75 percent of schools to provide nutrition education from preschool through grade 12 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991). School nutrition can also have an effect on the goal to reduce the incidence of being overweight to a prevalence of no more than 15 percent among adolescents and on the goal to increase calcium intake so that at least 50 percent of youth and young adults consume three or more servings daily of calcium-rich foods.\n\nChildren's cognitive, behavioral, and physical performance is impaired by poor nutrition (Center on Hunger, Poverty, and Nutrition Policy, 1993; Centers for Disease Control, 1996; Meyers et al., 1989). Awareness of these findings is important for school administrators and teachers, who are likely to view nutrition as a priority only to the extent that it facilitates their primary mission—education (American Dietetic Association et al., 1995).\n\nHowever, despite the clear connection of nutrition to health and of health to education, there is a wide variance in the priority placed on school nutrition and foodservice across the country. Students today have increasing food options at school. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment study found that the most prevalent option was still a lunch brought from home, although vending machines, school stores, snack bars, and á la carte food items offered in addition to the school meal are increasingly available. Some of these choices contained as little as 20 percent of the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for certain nutrients, and none was equal in nutritional value to school lunches that met the USDA-mandated goals of one-third of the RDAs for key nutrients. School lunch participants ate more fruits and vegetables and drank more milk than did nonparticipants and were more likely to get their carbohydrates from grain and grain mixtures than were nonparticipants, whose carbohydrate sources were more likely to be sweetened beverages and salty snacks (Gordon and McKinney, 1995).\n\nThe USDA has published regulations requiring schools to plan menus with the goal of having no more than 30 percent of calories from fat and 10 percent of calories from saturated fat in the average meal selected by all students over a week. These standards will not apply to á la carte foods served in the cafeteria or to foods sold in snack bars, school stores, or vending machines. The regulations became effective in the 1996–1997 school year. Prior to the issuing of the USDA's recommendations, the School Nutrition Dietary Assessment study found that in 44 percent of school lunch programs, students had at least one menu option with no more than 30 percent of its calories from fat, but in only 1 percent of schools did all available school lunch menus have this low fat level.\n\nMany intervention studies have focused on environmental changes and have shown promising results in lowering the fat content of meals selected by students (Ellison et al., 1989; Nicklas et al., 1989; Simons-Morton et al., 1991; Snyder et al., 1994; Whitaker et al., 1993). The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH), a multicenter school-based health promotion program funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, tested the effectiveness of the Eat Smart School Nutrition Program in four states in 96 public elementary schools with more than 5,000 students (Perry et al., 1990). Data collected on this baseline measurement cohort during the period 1991 to 1994 show that in intervention school lunches, the percentage of calories from fat decreased significantly more (38.7 to 31.9 percent) than in controls (38.9 to 36.2 percent). The level of student self-reported daily energy intake from fat also was significantly reduced in intervention schools (32.7 to 30.3 percent) compared to controls (32.6 percent to 32.2 percent) (Luepker et al., 1996).\n\nPolicy decisions are important to maximizing program influence on current and future eating behaviors of students. Among the policies that local schools and communities must address in order to achieve a school nutrition and foodservice program that meets national goals are those that relate not only to nutrition standards but also to consideration of student preferences, purchasing practices, production methods, professional development of school nutrition staff, team building for school staff and community members, development of eating environments that provide optimum time, space, support for healthful choices, positive supervision, and role modeling (American School Food Service Association, 1994). Policies are also necessary to guard against such problems as those that recently arose in the New York City schools, where foodservice management was reorganized after criticism that it approved shipments of outdated meat and covered up outbreaks of food poisoning (Rousseau, 1995).\n\nFunding for school meals also has major implications for program outcomes. Private funds raised by the community financed the first programs in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Local boards of education later added the program to their budgets, and limited federal support, primarily through work programs in the 1930s, provided subsidies that encouraged schools to provide school lunches. The first specific federal legislation was the National School Lunch Act of 1946, which provided an incentive to local schools to operate nutritionally sound programs. It was not until the 1960s that additional funding was provided for schools with large numbers of low-income children.\n\nIn the 1980s, federal support for school nutrition programs declined significantly. Adjusted for inflation, federal funding for school lunch is only 58 percent of its initial 1946 level (Citizens' Commission on School Nutrition, 1990). Local and state funding has also declined, and school nutrition and foodservice programs in many communities are expected to operate as businesses with no local support. SHPPS reported that 29 percent of all middle or junior and senior high schools were expected to generate funds beyond the costs of the program.\n\nProfit-making has become pervasive in the school nutrition and foodservice environment. SHPPS reported that more than one-third (37.2 percent) of schools reported that they have been contacted by a fast-food company interested in providing food for students, and foodservice management companies have increased their focus on the school market. Operating in such an environment, school nutrition programs are under great pressure to attract student customers even if it means compromising the nutrition integrity of meals or á la carte offerings. Decisions on food offerings often are based on the food item's profit margin rather than on its nutritional profile. Some observers maintain that such decisions send the message that it is acceptable to compromise health for financial reasons, a message inconsistent with classroom education (American Dietetic Association, 1991). The degree to which students' nutritional intake and lifelong eating behaviors are influenced by this environment and by the local, state, and federal policies that impact the environment merits further study.\n\nPolicies that promote universal access to healthful meals are widely viewed as important to the health of children and youth (American Dietetic Association et al., 1995; National Health Education Consortium, 1993; Nestle, 1992). However, the increase in for-profit options in schools has not only encouraged students to make selections that are not covered by nutritional standards, but also emphasized the social distinctions between students with unlimited dollars to spend on for-profit foods of their choice and students receiving free or reduced-price meals or those from working poor families who can afford only the price of the paid meal. A USDA study identified 4.1 million eligible low-income students who did not apply for free or reduced-price meals; stigma has been cited as a possible reason (Abt Associates, 1990).\n\nChildren's recognition of the importance of healthful eating is increasing. A 1994 Gallup survey of students between the ages of 9 and 15 found that 97 percent agreed that a balanced diet is very important for good health, 96 percent liked eating different types of foods, and 87 percent agreed that eating smaller amounts of a variety of foods is better than eating large amounts of only a few. Yet one-half the respondents (51 percent) said they skip breakfast and 28 percent skip lunch (International Food Information Council, 1995).\n\nThe dynamic nature of school nutrition and foodservice requires directors and managers with strong skills in financial and program management that include the ability to provide services for students with special health care needs, to coordinate the instructional component with health educators and teachers, and to serve as an effective member of the school—community health team. Strong inservice programs for food-service assistants are critical to successful implementation.\n\nIncreased understanding by school administrators and other community leaders of the relationship between the school nutrition and food-service program and children's health and education will lead schools and communities to establish expectations consistent with community values and resources and to implement policies that maximize outcomes.\n\nBasic School Health Services\n\nOver the past three decades, research on traditional basic school health services has focused on four primary areas:\n\n1.\n\nworkforce issues (Bachman, 1995; Basco, 1963; Chen, 1975; Crowley and Johnson, 1977; Dungy and Mullins, 1981; Forbes, 1965; Frels, 1985; Goodwin and Keefe, 1984; Hilmar and McAtee, 1973; Johnson et al., 1983; Kalisch et al., 1983; Lewis et al., 1974; Lowis, 1964; McKaig et al., 1984; Oda et al., 1979; Piessens et al., 1995; Thurber et al., 1991);\n\n2.\n\norganization, governance, and financing (Davis et al., 1995; Eisner, 1970; Howell and Martin, 1978; Igoe and Giordano, 1992; Meeker et al., 1986; Miller and Shunk, 1972; Patterson, 1967; Ratchick, 1968; Risser et al., 1985; Russo et al., 1982; Rustia et al., 1984; Small et al., 1995; Thurber et al., 1991; Yankauer and Lawrence, 1961);\n\n3.\n\nstudent health needs (Bricco, 1985; Bryan, 1970; Cauffman et al., 1969; Center for Health Economics Research, 1993; Cook et al., 1985; Korup, 1985; O'Neil et al., 1985; Spollen and Davidson, 1978; Starfield, 1992; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1993a,b); and\n\n4.\n\nthe effectiveness of various screening tests and other interventions (Appelboom, 1985; Bricco, 1985; Brown et al., 1985; Frerichs, 1969; Goldberg et al., 1995; Harrelson et al., 1969; Jenne, 1970; Lewis and Lewis, 1990; MacBriar et al., 1995; Marcinak and Yount, 1995; Oda et al., 1985; Proctor, 1986; Risser et al., 1985; Roberts et al., 1969; Tuthill et al., 1972; Yankauer and Lawrence, 1961).\n\nBy far, the largest area of basic school health services research has been related to workforce, organization, and governance issues, particularly to the role, functions, and relationships of school health personnel to school administrators, classroom personnel, and others. Although much of this work has concentrated on nursing services, research has also examined dentists, physicians, school health assistants, counselors, social workers, and psychologists. Until the 1975 passage of the Education of the Handicapped Act (later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) and the introduction of school-based student health centers around the same time, school-employed health service personnel limited their services to case finding and referral. Diagnosis and treatment services were the purview of primary care providers located in community health facilities. Consequently, the established line of authority for school health services, which frequently had clinicians reporting to nonclinicians in the school's chain of command, was rarely problematic. However, as increasing numbers of students have come to school in need of primary care and/or with special health needs that require clinical nursing care, the importance of closer links to the established community health system, both private and public, has become more apparent. For example, at least 40 percent of respondents to a survey involving supervisors of school nurses reported that they had no clinical preparation in the delivery of health services although they were expected to supervise complex nursing care, including tracheal suctioning, administration of medications, nasogastric tube feedings, and dressing changes (Igoe and Campos, 1991).\n\nA nationwide investigation of the experiences of students with special health care needs, The Collaborative Study of Children with Special Needs, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in the 1980s, recommended greater involvement of health care professionals in the planning and implementation of services (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 1988). Another nationwide investigation of the needs of children and youth with chronic illness (Hobbs et al., 1983) addressed the need to establish policies that would improve the quality of health care available at school for these students. Policies covering the administration of medication and homebound students were given particular attention.\n\nAnother organization and workforce issue concerns the need for integrated school health services in which nurse, social worker, foodservice personnel, and others work together collaboratively as a team. Linked to this issue is the continuing evidence that well-prepared school health assistants paired with school nurses can, under supervision, manage basic services, which frees up nurses for more complex care and responsibilities befitting their preparation (Fryer and Igoe, 1996; Russo et al., 1982).\n\nTraditionally, school health services have been the responsibility of local districts. Given the large number of small- and medium-size school districts—76 percent of districts have a total student enrollment of 2,500 students of less—a regional plan may potentially even out some of the maldistribution of school health services from one district to the next in a state as well as among states (Igoe and Stephens, 1994). The feasibility of a regional approach to the organization and delivery of school health services has been investigated by Igoe and Stephens (1994). Educational Service Agencies (ESAs) are intermediate educational agencies that act as cooperatives in approximately 85 percent of the nation's school districts, servicing such needs as staff development, bulk purchasing, and delivery of related services to students with special health needs. In the study, ESA administrators were contacted to determine their involvement in school health. Although the response rate was only about 50 percent, administrators reported being involved in a wide variety of school health activities, including traditional basic school health services, and they predicted increasing involvement in years to come. Another interesting qualitative finding was that ESA directors had considerable skill in identifying and negotiating financing arrangements for a variety of school services from both state and local education agencies. Based on the finding, the investigators recommended that ESAs may have untapped potential for devising new plans for financing school health services.\n\nThe issue of financing for school health services received almost no attention until the introduction of nurse practitioners and primary care into schools in the 1970s. Current efforts in this regard are described later in this chapter. However, one national school health demonstration project conducted from 1980 to 1985 did investigate financing for school health and primary care in schools and deserves mention (DeAngelis, 1981). According to Meeker and colleagues (1986), most school health service programs have sole-source financing provided by either a health or an education agency. An alternative approach recommended by the investigators is multisource financing, which involves both health and education agencies as well as other organizations that provide such services as primary care.\n\nSome of the traditional population-focused basic school health services (e.g., screenings) have come under scrutiny. Although there has been little debate about the value of school-based screenings for vision and hearing, the value of growth screenings is uncertain. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence to suggest that scoliosis screening fails to meet the general criteria for screenings and therefore should no longer be recommended (Berg, 1993; Goldberg et al., 1995). Remaining to be evaluated with respect to mass screenings are such issues as the market value of these services and the value of a population-based approach versus a high-risk approach in which only those students needing screenings receive them at school.\n\nAlthough investigations of the outcomes of traditional basic services have been limited, some of this work was well designed for its day, and the findings have influenced the development and evolution of school health services. For example, Basco (1963) conducted the first large-scale evaluation of school nurse activities. That study's finding of the need to better utilize the nurse's clinical and managerial skills has been confirmed on numerous occasions. Roberts and colleagues (1969) studied absence and attendance patterns of 2,000 students and developed a statistical model to use in evaluating the effects of changes in nursing practice on the functional state of students. By 1972, the focus of school health services research became further focused on students, and Lewis et al. (1974) explored the outcomes in situations in which students were empowered to become active participants in their own care during encounters with school nurses.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, one principal area of research had to do with the effectiveness of the school nurse as a primary care provider, and another area of research concerned students with special health care needs. Three large studies during this period yielded valuable results: the Brookline Project, which investigated the developmental readiness of children (Levine et al., 1977); the Collaborative Study of Children with Special Needs (Walker, 1992); and the Vanderbilt study (Hobbs et al., 1983), which investigated the needs of students with chronic diseases. The Vanderbilt study established universal recommendations about the needs of students with chronic health conditions related to the pain they experience, the persistent sense of uncertainty that accompanies chronic health conditions, and the need for appropriate homebound policies and proper medication administration in the schools. Building on this work, Palfrey et al. (1992) developed Project School Care, which provided a comprehensive set of resources for schools regarding the management of students with special health needs.\n\nResearch on School-Based Health Centers and Other Extended Services\n\nSince school-based health centers and other extended services are a relatively new phenomenon, research on and evaluation of these programs are in the early stages. Many of these initiatives are special demonstration projects in a limited number of schools scattered throughout the country. A more complete discussion of selected findings from these initiatives is found in the background paper in Appendix D.\n\nMuch of the research has focused on school-based health centers. Studies over the past decade have shown that SBHCs can be implemented successfully in schools, enrolling substantial percentages of students (Dryfoos, 1994b; Kirby, 1994). SBHC users were reported to have received adequate care in a cost-effective manner and to be very satisfied with both the quality of the services and the caregivers. Research has documented that the services are used by youth who need them the most. Studies have also described the organization and functioning of SBHCs, as well as the barriers encountered and strategies for overcoming them. More challenging has been the conduct of studies on the impacts of SBHCs in terms of reducing risky behavior and improving long-term health and educational outcomes. Also, since many findings pertain to specialized initiatives dealing with targeted groups, it is not clear how generalizable the findings are to other settings and populations. Methodological difficulties in conducting research on school health programs are discussed further in Chapter 6. In spite of these limitations, it is possible to glean some interesting insights from existing studies, as described in the following sections.\n\nUtilization Studies\n\nA basic measure of program utilization is the number and fraction of students in a school enrolled in the SBHC. Typically, enrollment involves the submission of a form indicating parental consent to use the SBHC. Non-enrolled students can be treated for emergencies but then must go through the enrollment process. A related measure is the percentage of enrollees who actually use the facility.\n\nAdvocates for Youth reports that in 1993, about two-thirds of the students in the schools that responded were enrolled in their SBHCs, and 75 percent of them utilized the program over the reporting year (Hauser-McKinney and Peak, 1995). A survey supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of 19 schools showed identical proportions (Kisker et al., 1994a, 1994b).\n\nClinics responding to the Advocates for Youth survey reported that about 60 percent of enrolled students were female. One-third of the enrollees were African American, one-third white, 20 percent Latino, and the rest Asian, Native American, and other. Most reports show that although clinic users tend to mirror the student population in regard to race or ethnicity, females are more likely to use clinics, especially if reproductive health care is offered.\n\nA study of a sample of students from nine Baltimore school-based clinics compared enrollees with non-enrollees (Santelli et al., 1996). It found that those enrolled were significantly more likely to have had health problems, came from families on Medicaid, were in special education, and were African American. Those who did not enroll reported a variety of reasons for their decision, primarily being satisfied with their current provider.\n\nEnrollees in SBHCs show very different patterns of use. In one school-based clinic in Los Angeles, within a year, 5 percent of enrollees had made no visits, 41 percent had visited once, 39 percent had made two to five visits, 8 percent made six to ten visits, and 6 percent had used the clinic more than ten times (Adelman et al., 1993). Users reported ease of access as the most important reason for using the facility in the school and perceived the care provided as helpful and confidential. Nonusers said they did not use the clinic because they did not need it or were concerned about lack of confidentiality. In this sample, frequent clinic users were more likely to score high on indices of psychological stress. The investigators concluded that \"an on-campus clinic can attract a significant number of students who otherwise would not have sought out or received such help\" (Adelman et al., 1993).\n\nStudents who report higher rates of high-risk behaviors, such as substance abuse and early initiation of sexual intercourse, appear to be more likely to use school-based clinics than are other students. A study of students in four schools in Oregon showed a consistent and significant association between number of clinic visits and number of preexisting high-risk health behaviors (Stout, 1991). Only one-third of those students who reported no risk behaviors used the clinics as compared to more than two-thirds of the highest-risk students. In a study in Delaware, frequent users (three or more times) of school wellness centers were more likely than nonusers to report having engaged in such high-risk behaviors as suicide attempts, substance abuse, unprotected sexual activity, and eating-related purging (National Adolescent Health Resource Center, 1993).\n\nUsers of Denver's three high school clinics made an average of three visits per year (Wolk and Kaplan, 1993). However, a small number of students (11 percent) made 15 or more visits per year, accounting for 40 percent of all patient visits. These frequent visitors were significantly more likely to be females and to have lower grade point averages. Some 23 percent of the frequent visitors were diagnosed with mental health problems at the time of their initial visit, compared to 4 percent of the average users. By the end of the school year, 61 percent of all visits by frequent users were for mental health-related issues compared to 10 percent of all visits by the average users. High-risk behaviors—particularly unprotected sexual activity and use of alcohol and drugs (but not tobacco)—were significantly more prevalent among frequent users. It is important that most of the frequent users initially sought help for acute medical problems, at which time they were identified as students in need of mental health counseling. Many practitioners believe that the provision of comprehensive services in SBHCs offers a means for troubled students to enter into counseling and treatment for psychosocial problems. Youth are concerned about the stigma of attending a program specifically labeled \"mental health,\" but are willing to participate if the program deals with broader health concerns.\n\nThe RWJ evaluation reports on the characteristics of the population of students in schools with SBHCs (rather than of students who used the clinics) (Kisker et al., 1994a). In these 19 schools, 15 percent were non-Hispanic white, 44 percent Hispanic, and one-third African American. One-fourth of the youths stated that their parents had not completed high school, and another one-third of the students said their parents had no post-secondary education. One in five families was on welfare, and one-third received free or reduced-price school lunches. In the 1992 follow-up survey, 30 percent of the health center school students reported that their families had no health insurance, 20 percent were covered by Medicaid, 31 percent had private insurance or belonged to an HMO, and the remaining 19 percent did not know what type of coverage they had.\n\nOutcome Data\n\nIn the early 1980s, the potential of using SBHCs clinics as an integral part of pregnancy prevention efforts was stimulated by the publication of data from a study in St. Paul, Minnesota, which showed a decline in pregnancy rates in schools with clinics (Edwards et al., 1980). However, a later examination of birth rates showed large year-to-year fluctuations and no impact of the clinics (Kirby et al., 1993). In fact, a review of the other earlier studies showed mixed results for an array of behavior impact measures (Kirby, 1994). The studies that found positive effects on high-risk behaviors were offset by those that found negative effects or, more likely, no effects.\n\nIn general, studies have confirmed that the presence of a clinic in a school has no effect on the rates of sexual intercourse and little effect on contraceptive use, unless the clinic offers a visible pregnancy prevention program. A study that compared two schools with clinics that dispensed contraceptives on-site with two schools in which contraceptives were prescribed but not dispensed found few differences in contraceptive use. The only significant variable related to use was the greater number of contacts the students had with the clinic staff (Brindis et al., 1994).\n\nSome initiatives targeting sexual behaviors are showing promising results, however. For example, the first evaluation of the California Healthy Start initiative presented data on 40 different grantees, including, 8 youth service programs, 5 of which are school-based clinics. Adolescent clients of programs that had an explicit goal of reducing teen pregnancy were found to have initiated sexual activity much less often and to have used a reliable form of contraception much more often (Wagner et al., 1994). Among teenagers in pregnancy prevention programs, about 45 percent were found to be sexually active after six months, a significant decrease from the proportion at intake (77 percent).\n\nOne of the most systematic outcome studies of SBHCs to date—the outcomes evaluation of the RWJ School-Based Adolescent Health Care Program—showed that although SBHCs provided access to care and increased students' health knowledge significantly, no reduction in high-risk behaviors could be measured (Kisker et al., 1994b). The SBHC users showed little or no difference relative to the comparison sample in sexual activity or use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. These results are consistent with other interventions to reduce high-risk behavior, which generally have found that increased knowledge has little effect unless the environment and perceived norms are changed. Further, since clients of SBHCs tend to be students with greater problems and higher rates of risky behaviors than other students, it may not be reasonable to expect that an occasional clinic visit would turn their lives around.\n\nAlthough results are sometimes inconclusive, other studies have shown generally positive effects of SBHCs and other extended services on absenteeism, behavior, and academic performance and on the use of hospital emergency rooms (McCord et al., 1993; Santelli et al., 1996; Wagner et al., 1994). The findings of a GAO study of six programs targeted at students at high risk for school failure are summarized in (U.S. GAO, 1993a).\n\nTABLE 4-5\n\nIllustrative School-Linked Services Outcomes.\n\nCost-Benefit Studies\n\nSeveral studies have estimated the cost-benefit ratio for SBHCs. One study estimated that if young people in New York State received early preventive care through school clinics, $327 million could be saved annually in hospitalizations for delivery of teen pregnancies, low-birthweight babies, and such chronic diseases as asthma (New York State Department of Health, 1994). A cost-benefit analysis of three California school-based clinics compared the costs for the school services with the estimated cost in the absence of the school clinic (Brindis et al., 1995). Variables used included reduced emergency room use, pregnancies avoided, early pregnancy detection, and detection and treatment of the common STD, chlamydia. The ratios of savings to costs ranged from $1.38 to $2.00 in savings per $1.00 in costs, suggesting that the school clinic services were a good investment.\n\nPotential Strengths and Weaknesses of School-Based Health Centers\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center has recently published a report that analyzes the existing research on SBHCs and summarizes their strengths and weaknesses in improving access to primary care for adolescents (Santelli et al., 1995). This report defines primary care as having the following characteristics: ''first contact, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, community-oriented, family-centered, and culturally competent.\" The potential strengths and weaknesses of SBHCs in providing primary care identified by the report are outlined in .5\n\nTABLE 4-6\n\nPotential Strengths and Weaknesses of School-Based Health Centers.\n\nResearch Needs\n\nMany fundamental questions remain unanswered about SBHCs and other extended services. One of the most basic regards the relative advantages and disadvantages (in terms of quality, cost, and effectiveness) of providing primary care and social services at schools compared to providing these services at other sites in the community—for example, private physicians offices, other managed care providers, community clinics, or youth centers—or compared to not providing these services at all, as a function of the needs and characteristics of students and the community. A related question has to do with how the quality and effectiveness of SBHCs and other extended services should be defined and measured.\n\nIf SBHCs are indeed found to be a promising approach for many communities, then a broad research agenda will be needed to examine the implementation and dissemination of effective models. Greater understanding is needed about the best strategies for managing, staffing, and integrating the SBHC with the overall school program. Questions that must be addressed include: How does this activity get off the ground?\n\nWho calls the initial meeting, and what should be the lead agency in managing the program? What is the most cost-efficient staffing mix? How can SBHCs and backup referral agencies coordinate scheduling and other arrangements? What are the implications of an SBHC for health programs and health services personnel already at the school?\n\nStudying the impacts and outcomes of SBHCs will be a long-term process. To begin this effort, however, uniform data collection standards and protocols should be established as soon as possible, not just for SBHCs but for other school health services providers as well. This will facilitate further research and allow data from various sources to be compared or aggregated as appropriate. An example of data inconsistency is the definition of what constitutes a \"visit\" with a school health provider. Some may consider this to include even a brief, spontaneous \"drop-in\" encounter. Others limit the term to a formal scheduled appointment. Still others may attempt to describe and categorize the nature of the visit. Such lack of standardization in data collection makes research and evaluation, including studies of cost-effectiveness, difficult. The committee does not believe that the costs associated with uniform data management will be an issue. Software packages are becoming easily available for record-keeping in school health services. For example, an electronic management information system called School Health Care Online!!! is already widely used in SBHCs; this system produces routine reports on utilization of services and serves as a basis for internal quality control (see ) (Kaplan, 1995). The system is designed to collect information about the physical and mental health, health screening, and risk behaviors of clients, as well as epidemiologic, administrative, billing, and program outcome data. The software is set up to produce more than 100 preprogrammed reports, including linked files listing referrals, follow-up information, and statistical reports on users, immunizations, case management, and health screening.\n\nTABLE 4-7\n\nSchool Health Care ONLINE!!! Data Collection and Management Capabilities.\n\nSchool-Based Health Insurance\n\nA major obstacle for many students in receiving health care is the fact that they lack health insurance but do not qualify for Medicaid assistance. A program in Florida is tackling this problem by providing health insurance for all school children. The School Enrollment-Based Health Insurance (SEBHI) concept was proposed in 1988 to provide low-cost, comprehensive health insurance to families who did not qualify for Medicaid and could not afford private insurance (Freedman et al., 1988). SEBHI represents an alternative to employer-based health insurance by using the school system to create large groups to negotiate health insurance policies. SEBHI contains several attractive features. First, families with school-aged children represent approximately 66 percent of the uninsured families (Sulvetta and Swartz, 1986). These families are targeted through the SEBHI model. Second, school districts can be used to create large pools of uninsured individuals who represent a significant market share in the group health insurance market. Third, school-based insurance coverage for children is more portable. Because the school district is the grouping mechanism, coverage will not be disrupted if a parent changes or loses his or her job.\n\nSeveral factors served as impetus for the implementation of the SEBHI concept. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, between one-fifth and one-sixth of children under 18 have no health insurance. Nearly two-thirds of these children live in families with incomes above the federal poverty level, making some of them ineligible for government-sponsored health programs. Employee-based health insurance coverage, which covers approximately two-thirds of all children who have private insurance, declined from 71 to 63 percent in 1990. Only 55 percent of all United States jobs, and 35 percent of low-wage jobs, include health insurance benefits (Employee Benefit Research Institute, 1993).\n\nA SEBHI demonstration program was implemented in Volusia County, Florida, in 1991. Its purpose is to encourage children in low-income families to use pediatric primary care services by reducing financial barriers to care. The SEBHI benefit package includes well-child visits and immunizations with no co-payment required. Other benefits with minimal co-payments include inpatient care, maternity benefits, mental health services, prescriptions, physical therapy, and emergency services and transportation.\n\nAll children who are not eligible for Medicaid are eligible for participation in the demonstration. Subsidized premiums are offered so that financial concerns will not be a barrier to families who want to enroll their children. The National School Lunch Program is used as a method to verify family income for insurance premium subsidy. Subsidized premiums are based on family income so that families with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level receive fully subsidized premiums; those with incomes between 101 and 135 percent of the poverty level pay $2.50 per child per month; those between 136 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level pay $13 per child per month; and those at 186 percent of the poverty level or above pay the full premium of $46 per child per month.\n\nA key feature of the program is the provision of care through the private sector. The program is not intended to extend Medicaid coverage or to provide health care as a variation of the current Medicaid system for children in Florida. In the SEBHI demonstration, care is provided through a health maintenance organization using both staff physicians and contract physicians in private practice. Prior to implementing the demonstration, it was presumed that a generous benefit package, the provision of free or greatly reduced health insurance premiums, and the availability of care within a private HMO would result in more low-income children making primary care visits. The market penetration of the program among the targeted uninsured children has exceeded 50 percent. Health care services in the early stages of the demonstration were provided at other community sites, but the project directors are now working with the HMO to move a set of widely used services to the school site in order to widen participation.\n\nGiven the continued erosion of employer-based health insurance, the SEBHI concept is an interesting and relevant approach for providing health insurance to previously uninsured children. The large numbers of uninsured school-age children make the school a useful grouping mechanism that is not dependent on the parents' employment status. In addition, it is clear that financial barriers to health care use must be removed, and the SEBHI model addresses this factor through the provision of free or greatly reduced insurance premiums.\n\nHowever, results of the SEBHI demonstration indicate that attention must also be paid to addressing nonfinancial barriers to health care use. Factors such as length of time of program enrollment, the child's age and gender, the premium amount, and the child's race and ethnicity influence both the likelihood of health care use and health care use rates after reducing or removing financial barriers to care (Shenkman et al., 1996).\n\nNonfinancial barriers to health care use are perhaps more complex than financial barriers. For example, some minorities experience deep sociopolitical disenfranchisement within our society. It is often argued that in the face of poverty, crisis, and feelings of alienation, some minority parents may not place a high priority on taking their children for primary and preventive care (Murray-Garcia, 1995). Moreover, minority parents often face the significant barrier of receiving health care within a system that they feel is not sensitive to their cultural needs. These issues are deeply rooted in our society and not easily addressed. However, future efforts at providing health services within a comprehensive school health program must combine innovative financing strategies like the SEBHI concept with strategies to break down cultural, nonfinancial barriers to health care to ensure that all children receive pediatric health care services."
