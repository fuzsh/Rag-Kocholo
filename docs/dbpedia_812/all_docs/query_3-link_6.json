        "text": "April 23, 1859\n\nFirst issue of William Byers' newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, comes off the press, beating a rival, the \"Cherry Creek Pioneer,\" by 20 minutes.\n\nSeptember - December 1859\n\nThe Rocky moves twice, from the attic of Uncle Dick Wooten's saloon at 1413-15 11th Street to a log cabin at 14th and Market Streets, and then to 13th and Walnut.\n\nAugust 1860\n\nThe Rocky converts from a weekly to a daily newspaper. It moves to a building elevated on stilts in the middle of Cherry Creek, near 13th and Market.\n\nMay 1864\n\nThe building on stilts is swept away by a flash flood.\n\n1866\n\nAfter multiple moves, the Rocky settles into a brick building called the \"News Block\" near 16th and Larimer Streets where it stays until 1887.\n\nJuly 1870\n\nThe Rocky changes from an evening to a morning newspaper.\n\n1878\n\nByers sells the newspaper to Colorado railroad magnate W.A.H. Loveland, who modernizes with telephones, typesetting machines and wire services.\n\n1887\n\nUnder new owners, the paper moves to the southwest corner of 17th and Curtis Streets.\n\n1898\n\nFirst photographs are reproduced in the Rocky.\n\n1901\n\nFirst red ink headlines appear in the Rocky, and were used until 1933. The paper moves to 1720 Welton Street.\n\nNovember, 1926\n\nScripps Howard Company purchases the Rocky.\n\nApril 1942\n\nThe Rocky changes format from a broadsheet to a tabloid, under command of the new editor, Jack Foster. This helped revive the paper, which had been on life support in the early 1940s.\n\nJune 1952\n\nThe Rocky moves from Welton Street to 400 W. Colfax Avenue.\n\nMarch 1993\n\nThe Rocky premieres a newly designed, full color newspaper.\n\nApril 2000\n\nThe paper wins its first Pulitzer Prize, for photography for its coverage of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings.\n\nMay 2000\n\nThe Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post agree to a joint operating agreement that combined advertising, circulation and production departments while preserving two independent newsrooms.\n\nApril 1, 2001\n\nThe Rocky publishes its last Sunday edition. Under the agreement, the Rocky published a Saturday edition and the Denver Post published the Sunday edition.\n\nApril 2003\n\nThe Rocky wins a Pulitzer for breaking-news photography for its pictures of Colorado's 2002 wildfire season.\n\nMarch 2006\n\nDaily circulation: 255,427.\n\nApril 2006\n\nRocky reporter Jim Sheeler and photographer Todd Heisler are awarded Pulitzers for \"Final Salute,\" a report on a Marine major who notifies loved ones of military deaths in the line of duty.\n\nJanuary 23, 2007\n\nThe Rocky is redesigned to a smaller, magazine format, with a re-designed masthead and many more color photographs. The re-design was the result of new printing presses, which were able to operate about 25% faster.\n\nDecember 4, 2008\n\nScripps announces plans to seek a buyer for the Rocky.\n\nJanuary 29, 2009\n\nRocky staff and community supporters hold a candlelight vigil to show their support for the newspaper.\n\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\nFinal edition of the Rocky Mountain News.\n\nFrom \"The First Hundred Years,\" by Robert L. Perkin:\n\n\"The Rocky Mountain News, a journal of some little durability, has survived flood, fire, starvation, and mounted desperadoes with nervous trigger fingers. It has come through half a dozen wars, including the Indian. It has stood off plagues of grasshoppers and, narrowly, two gentlemen of exquisite rapacity named Bonfils and Tammen. Droughts, panics, the Ku Klux Klan have done their worst. Repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act left a deep wound, and the News also has lived out the boycotts of corporations, the ink-tipped lances of Eugene Field, and the hyperbole of flatterers.\n\nEditors of the Rocky Mountain News have been kidnapped, shot at, caned, pistol-whipped, hanged in effigy, and immortalized in stained glass. They have chased redskins, built commonwealths, founded universities, climbed mountains, and been clouted from the rear while walking to work. On one day of scandalous memory an editor was the target of an unrequited mistress armed, naturally, with a pearl-handled revolver.\" (Perkin, p. 9)\n\nThe Colorado Gold Rush of 1858-59 brought hordes of fortune seekers west, and there was a brisk business in writing guidebooks for these adventurers. William N. Byers, from Omaha, who had traveled the Oregon Trail, wrote one of these guides, and in the spring of 1859 put it to his own use, coming to Denver (carrying a printing press with him!) to grab some of the gold that was reportedly just laying around for the taking.\n\nThough he never found gold, he realized that by establishing a newspaper in a city that was itself just getting established, he was literally making history. Those first years, there was a lot of disappointment when people found that after their arduous journey west, the streams were not, as they had imagined, lined with gold. The Rocky Mountain News helped stem the tide of \"gobacks\" with its reports of real, substantial gold strikes being made daily. \"It heaped editorial scorn on the fatuous and the foolhardy and never ceased to admonish all who would travel west to see the elephant that they should arrive well capitalized, prepared for work, and with their heads screwed on tight.\" (Perkin, p. 16) \"From the beginning, the Rocky Mountain News made itself felt as a commanding influence in the life and activities of the new settlements.\" (Douglas C. McMurtrie quoted by Perkin, p. 16)\n\nHere is one of many fascinating stories from the early days of the Rocky, adapted from Perkin's book:\n\nIn 1860, Denver was without a police force, and factions of lawless types, especially the self-styled \"Bummers,\" had established their headquarters in the Criterion saloon, and among many other acts of banditry began stealing turkeys from an Auraria farmer. At the same time, late-comers to the Gold Rush began building houses on the outskirts of town in defiance of the town company, on open land. This combination of problems led to a state of near anarchy in Denver, with lots of shots fired and a general feeling of lawlessness pervading the fledgling metropolis. It finally ended with the cracking of the skull of William McCarty, one of the \"Bummer\" leaders.\n\nThe owner of the Criterion bar, Charley Harrison, who often proudly boasted of all the men he had killed, didn't like the Rocky's editorializing and condemnation of the crime and violence, the July 25, 1860 edition having \"cataloged and indexed the bloody record, named the Criterion specifically as the poisonous wellspring of contagion and named Harrison personally as a blackhearted murderer.\"\n\nOn July 31, several Criterion regulars burst into the Rocky's editorial offices and shouting \"vile oaths\" kidnapped Byers at gunpoint and took him to the Criterion. Harrison, in a moment of apparent sanity, gave Byers a pistol and let him escape out of the back door. The kidnappers went after him again, and now the Rocky's editorial offices became a fort under siege for the next several months. Less than a month later, someone tried unsuccessfully to burn the building down.\n\nHarrison, insulated from justice, began professing friendship and admiration for Byers, giving him a large ring of native gold, inscribed with a Masonic emblem, honoring their shared membership. Eventually, Charley Harrison left Denver never to return.\n\nThomas Knox, a writer for The Knickerbocker, wrote that:\n\n\"Repeated shots have been fired at the News office by indignant 'roughs;' the editors have been assaulted at various times, and on a few occasions their lives have been in great jeopardy... every few weeks a threat of cleaning out the News office was made by its enemies, and the whole corps, from the 'devil' upward, is prepared to resist such a purifying process. The sanctum abounds in guns and revolvers, always at hand; and in squally times each man in the composing room has a 'six-shooter' by the side of his copy. The foreman (Dailey) sports a huge 'navy' at his belt, and the roller-boy is ready to support the honor of the establishment with the weapon of his branch of trade.\"\n\nOther newspapers came and went, but the Rocky held the course, commanding national attention at times, and winning four Pulitzer prizes in its final ten years. After 150 years of ups and downs, facing the onslaught of electronic media, and like so many other newspapers, large and small, the Rocky finally called it quits.\n\nHere is the first part of the staff's message from the final edition:\n\n\"Goodbye, Colorado.\n\nIt is with great sadness that we say goodbye to you today. Our time chronicling the life of Denver and Colorado, the nation, and the world, is over. Thousands of men and women have worked at this newspaper since William Byers produced its first edition on the banks of Cherry Creek on April 23, 1859. We speak, we believe, for all of them, when we say that it has been an honor to serve you. To have reached this day, the final edition of the Rocky Mountain News, just 55 days shy of its 150th birthday is painful. We will scatter. And all that will be left are the stories we have told, captured on microfilm or in digital archives, devices unimaginable in those days...\"\n\nIn addition to the almost 300,000 digital images acquired by the Library, there are also some ​2,500 archival containers, about 500 of them of photographs, organized by biography and subject, and which are being processed by volunteers. Special Collections and Archives Librarians are already locating items for researchers from these collections, even as our processing continues.\n\nThere are whole subsections dedicated to various newsworthy events, such as political conventions, the Papal visit, and the Columbine shootings. The entire set of digitized images amounts to just over 300,000 images, with about 2,000 of them from the 2008 Democratic National Convention, and about 200 of them related to the Rocky's Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nIn addition to the 2009 acquisition, there are almost 150,000 film negatives dating from 1942 to 1969 in our photo vault, which were acquired sometime in the 1970s. These negatives have had some research and labeling, but for the most part, remain un-examined.\n\nHere are high-resolution scans of the first four pages of the First Edition of the Rocky Mountain News. (cropped section shown above).\n\nSearching the new collection of born-digital Rocky Mountain News photographs is more complex than ordinary image searches. The metadata, or basic description, that accompanies every digitized image in our collections documents all the information available for that image. This metadata is also what makes the search function work, and unlike our original core collections upon which we lavished detailed cataloging and metadata, the Rocky Mountain News collection has inconsistent and often scant cataloging or metadata. In some cases, how many we don't know, the dates in the records are not reliable because they are camera stamps which were often not correctly set, especially in the early days of digital photography. If you discover images with no descriptive information, and you have new or additional image information, or if you notice incorrect information, please help us improve the collection by leaving a comment in the comments field.\n\nThe different categories of the Rocky Mountain News photographs have different searching quirks that will be useful to keep in mind. Below are explanations for each of these branches of the collection.\n\nPulitzer Prize collection: Sixty award-winning photographs and one photo essay live inside this relatively small collection, along with images directly relating to them. You'll have the most success searching by photographer in the Creator field, or by keyword using the Title, Description, or Keywords fields. Images related to a particular Pulitzer subset can be found by searching by specific year. For example, \"2003 Pulitzer\" (the prize was awarded in 2003) will bring up all Pulitzer images surrounding the 2002 forest fires as well as the storyboards the newspaper used to submit their nomination for the prize. All stand-alone prize-winning photographs will have a description that starts with: \"PULITZER PRIZE PHOTOGRAPH.\" Alternatively, you can go right to the photo galleries for Columbine: Images of Tragedy, Colorado on Fire, and Final Salute.\n\nDemocratic National Convention collection: In 2008 Denver hosted the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama became the party's nominee for President. Enjoy browsing through more than 2,000 images both public and candid taken from August 25-28. Some images in this collection are still lacking titles, so we recommend that you use \"Advanced Search,\" and search for keywords in \"All Fields.\" Or if you know a particular speech happened on a particular day, try a date search.\n\nRocky Mountain News Photograph collection: More than 300,000 images taken from 1999 to 2009 live in this primary set of born-digital photography. From the dramatic to the mundane, this amazing collection makes for great browsing. You might find information in multiple places, so it's best to use \"Advanced Search,\" and search for keywords in \"All Fields.\" You'll also want to approach your search from multiple angles to get more complete search results."
