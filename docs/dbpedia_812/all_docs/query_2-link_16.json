Surface Overseas Dear MRR, After reading the letter from David Zukauskas of Waterbury, CT (MRR #25) wondering how he can stay punk and survive in the system as he grows older, my son, who lives in California, thought you might like to hear from me, his 61 year old father, who goes to punk bashes because that's the only place he finds creative individuality in these days of cookie- cutter culture. Although I am aware that the trendies and the poseurs have come dangerously close to drowning out the original punk ethic of \"no more bullshit\", I still have faith that this hard core of genuinesness will prevail if only the young people can stubbornly and courageosly hold on to that idea as they grow older and are pushed into the deadly game of survival. Survival isn't easy, David. After a lifetime of sweating for the system I was finally chewed up and spit out, but I haven't laid down and died yet. Right now I live in my mother's garage while looking for work and write nasty letters to the newspapers when some particularly obscene piece of cultural or political bullshit pisses me off. Like Yohannan, I have totally lost contact with the people of my generation. They live close by in the suburbs and I see their names in the society pages, but the few times I run into them on the street they hurry on. I pity them because they are slaves to their position and their possessions and don't even realize it. But they are dangerous, David, because they have power. We don’t necessarily have to fight them in the streets (yet), but with our lives and thoughts we must make sure that they don't make slaves of us too. We must continue reminding them in the best way we know how that the time has come for \"no more bullshit\" and that we will not go away. Like Yohannan says, we must \"maintain our integrity, vision, energy, and sense of humor\" in the lonely battle ahead. Hang in there kid and someday when you’re my age you'll be shouting, as I do-- \"Rise Above!!\" Frank Jenkins/ 601 Blanchard Ave/ El Paso TX 79902 Dear MRR, I was not at all surprised to see Mr. Hatch’s name mentioned in your \"New Right\" article. Mr. Hatch is well known for his right wing views and the introductioon of right wing legislation into Congress. He has introduced anti-abortion legislation, he is anti-ERA, he is pro-cable TV censorship, the list can go on and on. What kind of freedoms will remain when these people of the \"New Right\" (New Reich?) have had their say? The political system as it now stands is not a democracy as long as these people control the reigns. Utah, the state Mr. Hatch hails from, is a Republican stronghold and has been for years. The fact that such a man as Mr. Hatch can be voted into office by the citizens of Utah is unnerving. Utah is also a hotbed of military activity. Utah plays a role in the first nuclear bombs. It was also the home of one of the concentration camps for the Japanese. Now we have Hill AFB, which is home for several F-16's. 1 We also have Toole Army Depot and Dugway proving grounds, which are home for some of the most deadly nerve gases made. And now they want to make more! So naturally they are trying to upgrade Dugway to a level 4 , which means they can go ahead and test these new chemical weapons. All of which I am sure Mr. Hatch approves of, The military already destroyed several thousand sheep and maybe several hundred human lives with their nuclear tests. What can we expect from the testiing of chemical devices? I for one do not want to know and I will do all I can to stop the testing and deployment of these devices. We must all work together to stop the \"New Right\" people such as Mr. Hatch. If we don't do it today, there will be no tomorrow. Real love and real peace and real anarchy, Les Grant/ 125 So. 9th East #1/ SLC, UT 84102. Dear MRR: In regard to your review of the CAUSTIC DEFIANCE demo tape in issue #28, 1 take it that the part where you said \"those Stepe (pronounced 'Step-e') brothers will do anything to keep their names in print, even going to the outrageous length of putting a tape out\" was done in fun and in good faith. At first, I thought it was funny, but after a while it started to get my dander up. The reason why we are in print so much is because we are very involved with the whole punk scene. The Stepe family has six people in it. Mom, Dad, Steve (me), Barry, Chopper, and Kyle. In our family, we have four fanzines being produced. Everybody except Mom and Dad put one out. We also contribute to many others. We have also been involved with a lot of bands. I've been in RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED, ELECTRIC COOL-AID, UNAC- CEPTED (versions 1 and 2), KGB, BLOODY MURDER, BLOOD FEAST and others. Barry was in NEGATIVE ELEMENT, CAUSTIC DE- FIANCE, UNACCEPTED (versions 1 and 2), and numerous others. Chopper was in NEGATIVE ELEMENT, CAUSTIC DEFIANCE, KGB, BLOOD FEAST, WILDTONES (Barry was in that one, too), BLOODY MURDER, ELECTRIC COOL-AID, UNACCEPTED (versions 1 and 2) and a band (punk) when he was in fourth grade (he's 17 now) and even played some punk songs in a makeshift band in front of his 6th grade class. I have an excuse for a record company that put out a Chicago compilation tape and the RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED EP. On the compilation tape, I sold 250+ copies, but lost over a hundred dollars of my own money. I only got back $100 from the RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED so far... (hint, hint, ROTA!). The money from both things was from my college tuition money that's been saved over the years. Another thing, Peoria isn’t a joke scene! We have over 1 50 punks that go to shows. We recently had 7 SECONDS play here. You bigger scenes could take a lesson from Peoria; WE HAVE FUN AT SHOWS! If you are in a band and would like to play here, get in touch with me. Barry, Chopper, and Mike O'Russa and I started a BYO here that puts on shows here. We're trying to keep the scene positive. My mom went to the 7 SECONDS show and helped sweep up afterwards. She's getting a mohawk tomorrow (only joking). I wonder why our name is always in print? Steve Stepe/ 104 Greenbriar/ East Peoria, IL 61611 P.S: We did it again! Hahahahahahahahaha!!! Dear MRR: This is in response to the letter in #26 from Michael of Albequerque, NM. Michael says he's a skinhead who's not like the stereotypical skinhead and that it’s unfair to lump all skins together. Dressing in any group's uniform communicates your adherence to the set of ideas of that group. So, if you dress in the uniform of violent bigots why shouldn't people asume that you are one? After all, what are skinheads known for besides getting clubs closed down, fag bashing and Paki bashing (in England), etc? A lot of letters to MRR have said that it's English skinheads who are responsible for the skins' bad reputation, that American skins are different. I don't agree completely, but even if that were true, doesn’t dresing just like English skins and using their expressions imply that you admire or at least sympathize with their actions? If I didn’t belong to the KKK, but dresed irt a white sheet and burned crosses, would you believe me when I said I had nothing against blacks? Why do you think most punks stopped wearing swastikas years ago? You are responsible for what your appearance tells* people. John Jail/ 626 Nass St/ Downingtown, PA Dear MRR: I'd like to get some feedback about a problem that we have here in New Mexico. The problem has been Hispanic gangs (Low Riders) harassing \"punks,” \"skins,\" or anyone else who may look a little strange. Understand that the \"scene\" here in Albuquerque is vastly smaller than the Hispanic gangs which number in the thousands. Up until about a month ago, there was a house where about a dozen or so people active in the \"scene\" lived. 1 1 was a place to hang out, crash, and for out of town bands to play. This house was a sort of the vortex of the Albu- quereque scene. Unfortunately, because of muggings, assaults, and death threats by \"ChoTlos,\" it all came down in the end. Only because the police learned of the situation did it not come to a final bloody confrontation. What warranted this hatred of \"punks?\" I quote one lowrider \"We just don't like you.\" This lowrider then threatened to come by the following Saturday night to blow people away. I’m convinced that the only thing that prevented this from happening was the presence of the police, who had heard of the plot through informants. But the result was that the residents of the house vacated and many left the state. Now, many of us here involved in the music scene are despondent and back to square one. A similar situation occured in Santa Fe where punks were literally forced from their homes by Chollos. So what to do? I'm sure some of you will say: ’’Arm yourselves and Unite,\" but I’ve seen the result of that when rival Hispanic gangs do battle. Just this month, 3 people died in a shoot-out. I would like to hear from other people who have similar problems and perhaps some solutions.Thanks, John Hardin (Sangre de Puerco)/ 915 Tramway Ln./ Albuquerque, NM 87122 P.S: I do not wish to sound racist. It's just the fact that these gangs do exist and they happen to be Hispanic. ZABBY, I read your letter in MRR #28 and had a rather strong reaction to it. So, I thought I should write and let you know exactly what I thought. I, too, am from Washington DC and have been part of the scene here since '82. I currently go to school at Vassar in Upstate New York. I am a guy who has had the same girlfriend (who is VERY liberated and who I have infinate respect for) for the last two years. Just thought I'd put a perspective on things. Now then, what it seems you're really mad about, Zabby, is who gets to tell who what to do. As it stands now, you seem to think that girls cater to guys' ideas about dress, etc. Well, what is your great solution? To have girls cater to your ideas about how to dress! That's right, you fashion Nazi, anyone who makes stupid surface judgements like \"anyone who preens before a mirror must be vain and anyone who hangs on a guy's shoulder and wears a leather mini and spike heels to a show must not care about the music\" is worse than the most submissive foot-kissing conformist. Zabby, your hypocrisy astounds me. What is wrong with public displays of affection? Why is dressing a certain way indicative of a lack of caring? T suppose that everyone who dresses to fit your nice standards must be the model of the good, independant, caring person. Great, that's just what we need, a whole new set of rules to conform to. Watch out, girls- even though you may genuinely care for your boyfriends, don’t show it! It means you're weak, right? And I want to see a reasonable quota of you slamming, even if you don't want to- I wanna see some bruises, yeah! And, hey, no more leather skirts, eye make-up, face make-up, or spike heels allowed. Any girl cauaht wearing this clothing will have a giant \"U\" for uncaring burned into her forehead. And another thina- no more love or friends of even a slightly romantic nature- nope, against Zabby’s rule book. People who seek friends of the opposite sex are out of date and will be shot on sight at the next show. And finally, all guys have the right to find any girl who doesn't live up to my cookie mold standards disgusting and fit for abuse. Go ahead, girls aren't like me are born to be abused- Remember, in Zabby's world, abuse of the nonconformist (to her ideas) will set women free, right? Isn't that the logical conclusion to your rule book, Zabby? I mean, MY GOD, I thought your type of moralizing went out with the horse-drawn buggy. You and Queen Victoria would get along great. From the heart, Anil Melnick/ Box 2366, Vassar College/ Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 P.S. Despite your good intentions, your attitudes confuse and enslave women- not liberate them. 'The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.” -famous quote. Dear MRR: In response to Zabby S., who wrote to complain about the attitudes of the \"punkettes”: I can understand your feeling of frustration with these girls. But try to see it from a female's point of view. We live in a society where we’re constantly being judged by our looks. (Any punk or hardcore who's had strangers yelling \"Hey freak!\" at him/her can attest to this.) We're conditioned to believe a sweet smile, big tits, and a flawless complexion will make us loved. Worse, if a girl dares to act aggressive, or slips out of the passive-female role, she is instantly labeled dyke, butch, lesbian. I should know, as my best friend and I (we’re both 16-year old girls) are known as \"lesbians\" in our high school, just 'cos we don't dress in ruffles and flounces, or have a \"my boyfriend is my life\" attitude. I find high heel shoes uncomfortable and impracticle, and skirts are a nuisance. I have a contact-dermatitis allergy, which means large amounts of many foreign substances (including soap, detergents, makeup, perfume, hairspray, etc.) will give me a rash and cause my eyelids to swell and peel. So, I wear jeans and sweaters, flat shoes, and little or no makeup. Unfortunately, it’s the stereotyping that many males are responsible for which makes me something of an oddity. I'm no condoning the way those girls at HC shows behave, but did you ever stopto think that a lot of guys demand a fragile., vampish little tag-along? These guys are just as guilty of vanity - they need a sexy little \"punkette\" (how I despise that term) to follow them around, to show their macho-male friends how cool they are. Of course, I know that not all guys are like this, just as I know not all girls wear leather miniskirts and spike heels to impress guys. I too look toward to a time when men and women will be totally equal. But this can't happen as long as men demands that their women conform to their idea of what is attractive., and as long as woment, even the supposedly \"liberated\" ones, continue to submit to these ridiculous demands. Hopefully, one day soon men will reject the image of the made-up clone doll as the \"perfect woman\", but until this happens, insecure females all over the world will continue to paint, pimp, starve themsleves, wear stupid clothes, and neglect their own feelings for the sake of their boyfriends' ego. R.K./ 12 Echo Ct./ Wayne, NJ 07470 Dear MRR, This letter is in response to Zabby's letter (issuue 281. I get the feeling, Zabby, that you are intimidated by our sexy \"punk looks\" and perhaps you should consider your own sexuality for a minute or more. Why is it that when we girls paint our faces and dress up it's considered vain and it's o.k. for you to look however you want. If you prefer plain women, join the Amish. Zabby, you can have all the intelligent plain girls you want. But just because we punk women are flashy and/or sexy doesn't mean we are not intelligent as well. We look this way cuz like it . Despite what you may think, girls do not neccessarily tag along with guys or girls at the hardcore shows. I go to shows too, but unlike you I don't see us ladies attending shows simply to show ourselves off to men. I go because I believe in the music, learn from its lyrics and feel most comfortable within the scene. Well sure we women flirt but you can chose not to flirt back. Punx aren't immune to this human behavior. Wouldn’t it be stifling if it was \"cool\" to pose as an asexual in the crowd? Anyone knows that a person who uses their looks to make themselves popular wont be a friend for you. So keep walking, or look the other way--perhaps in the music's direction. Why should anybody conform to your standards for an appropriate dress code? I see plenty of spiky mohawked men with painted eyes, carefully executed logos on the backs of their jackets and thats o.k. So why isn’t it o.k. for us girls to wear whatever the hell we like? As for slamming I agree that there are not many girls that slam. Not everybody enjoys slam dancing. Bruises and spikes in the face, as well as the basic turmoil of the pit are not things that most people cherish. Well at this point I have to admit that I love to slam and don't mind the circle and the energy there. But see I've got big boots and I’m kind of strong. Are other girls suppposed to be as strong as me, and not mind explaining bruises to family members, etc..., that refuse to understand? We live in an aagresive and competitive society anyway. Should we girls break our legs and faces to prove we are hardcore? No way. Perhaps these other girls are simply \"exercising common sense\". I hope that some day (now!) we can all be considered equal. And I don't mean unnisexual. Vive la difference! Francesca Perrell/ c/o Steel House/ University of Idaho/ Moscow, Idaho 83843 Dear MRR: In response to Zabby's letter in #28, I have to say that I feel he is looking at the issue of girls in the scene rather than one-sidedly. First off, he says that too many punk girls are only trying to be fashionable, i.e., leather mini skirts, torn shirts, etc., and he also states that girls spend too much time primping in front of mirrors getting ready for shows. Zabby, that may be true, but come on, you're not looking at the whole picture. Male punks are sometimes just as fashion-oriented as females, if not more so! i.e., leather jackets, combat boots, studs and spikes. And as far a make-up, hair styles go, I know of some guys who spend probably more time than most girls, spiking their mohawks or applying make-up (eyeliner, white powder, etc.). Come on, guys use it too! And as far as slamming goes, I can't blame some girls for not getting in the pit nowadays. Too many people think they have to thrash violently to prove something to them- selves and their friends. Besides, just because you thrash doesn't make you Mr. Punk Rocker. Don't some guys refrain from slamming because maybe they don't want their new Circle Jerks T-shirt to get ripped. Also, you say maybe \"one day women won't need to be 'foxy',\" well maybe someday guys won't need to be \"macho.\" The band, PENT UP AGGRESSION, has a cool song called \"Hardcore Meat Department,\" some of the lyrics go, \"Got sharp spikes/and a nice long dick/go to shows to pick up chicks...\" Guys, just as much as girls, have to keep some kina of \"image\". Zabby, I’m not trying to put you down for your opinion. I just think that you did not represent both sides of the problem, instead you used girls as scapegoats. I, too, hope that someday equality will be the rule, but it's going to take both guys and girls to change themselves, not just one of the two groups. Thanks for listening. Ted/ Blatant Rebellion Fanzine/ P.O. Box 8926/ Greensboro, NC 27419 P.S: Anyone who might write me, don't address letters to Blatant Rebellion, but to Ted House. Thanks. Dear MRR: This is a rebuttal to Zabby's letter in issue #28. How dare you even imply that girls use punk as a dress up game, spending hours applying \"impeccable\" makeup and trying to look punk. I am a photographer and a journalist. I like to think of my work as a constructive addition in the scene. I do not use my sex appeal as a tool for acceptance or a display of vanity. I take pride in the way I look. I enjoy getting dressed up to go out (even to gigs). I would much rather hear compliments on my \"impeccable\" makeup than crass comments like \"you scummy hole.' Let me illustrate an appropriate parallel- take men for instance. Some are punk rock gladiators ready for battle. They sport jackets with opulent stud work, expensive leather boots, and perfectly spiked hair. Experience has shown me that it takes quite a bit of effort to achieve such a \"punk look.\" In my opinion, that is no better than tight black mini skirts and high heels you complained about. As for slamming, I would much rather express myself through my writing that have my nose broken and ribs cracked by sweaty 15 year olds. In the case of the pit, my health is more important than my eyeliner. Moreover, if you do not believe women should look and act as such, then may I address the problem you may face by contracting AIDS. Sincerely, Mouse Hey dudes at MRR, Okay, although I didn't catch Mr. Board’s article on anti-veggie, I read the response, so I assume it was his usual inflammatory attention-getting device. Nothing wrong with an inflammatory attention-getting device, mind you--l also get a kick out of playing Devil's advocate and then watching people’s eyeballs pop out of their skulls. What I want to talk about is Kosher butchering. Holy herbivores, Mykel, if you're going to continue poisoning yourself through drugged cow carcasses, at least eat animals that were killed without their knowledge. For that is what Kosher butchering requires. The butcher, a specially trained artist, as opposed to an uncaring slaughterer, must use a knife much sharper than your average razor. He sharpens the blade each time, then runs it across his fingernails to check for nicks or cuts. If it even slightly drags, he must sharpen it again. The animal is brought in. The butcher (I don't like using that word. It has too many bad connotations. There is a better Yiddish word, but it escapes me right now.) must kill the animal with a very quick back-and-forth stroke against the animal's neck, severing the nerves, jugular, and windpipe instantly. This severing must be done with no force on the knife-- the blade’s incredible sharpness must be what cuts. The animal is dead in under one second. Afterwards, the blade is once more passed along the fingernails. If the knife fails either fingernail test, there is the slightest delay during strokes back-and-forth, most of the animal's neck is not severed, or the expression on the animal's face changes at all during its death, then the animal is not considered Kosher, and is not used. Afterwards, an internal inspection is conducted, and if any strange growths are discovered, the animal is deemed not Kosher. And don't think just anyone can become a Kosher butcher. You have to be deeply religious, you must have studied under a master, and you must periodically pass a \"review board\" composed of several prominent rabbis to be \"licensed\". In addition, you must pray-- not iust recite a prayer, but believe in the prayer-before and after every animal. Mykel, you could argue from now until fish evolve into eight foot tall yuppies with five leas about nutritional value, economic value, world food supply, etc... but I don\"t think you eat meat for the sake of cruelty. So, please- you and other carnivores- eat Kosher butchered meat. Peace, love, and anarchy, Adam Lost/ Dead Fish zine/ 2301 Prairie/ Aurora, IL 60506. DearMRR: I'm going to add something to the animal rights issue that will hopefully (though probably not) end it once and for all. First of all, I am a vegetarian and anti-vivisectionist. I believe that \"animals are not ours to eat, wear, or experiment on.\" But, I don't protest in front of McDonalds or lecture non-veggies. Why? Because I’m not some Jerry Falwell type, trying to make others live by my ethics. I see this situation on a clear parallel with the abortion issue. Those who want abortion banned say it should because \"it’s wrong.\" But, we all know we can't base a law on what some people believe is wrong. Vegetarianism works the same way. Not everyone believes it's wrong to eat, wear, or experiment on animals. I think it is, but I can't force my beliefs on others. I can hope they'll choose a vegetarian lifestyle, but the choice must be theirs. So will you now find something else to argue about? G.S.K./ San Rancisco Dear MRR; I'm sure this letter will be one in a million replying to Richard A. (MRR #26), but his letter was very provocative. Most people, including me, immediately thought \"what a twat!\" after reading it; but then I figured out that he's at least opened himself up to debate. Well, here is my logical argument for animal rights, \"no emotional appeal.\" The philosophy that non-humans are amoral and therefore have no rights was put forward around a hundred years ago and we've learned a lot since then! It has never been proved that other species cannot make right/wrong decisions and there is more evidence to the contrary, many non-humans show very strong social loyalties within their own species, ei. the safety of their young, they collectively share round the clock babysitting, always allow the young priority on the food and individuals will sacrafice themselves to prey as a last resort to protect their community. That is hardly just following instincts. As to \"purpose” in life, can anyone truly define OUR purpose? All animals (including us) have only two purposes. 1 ) To act towards the preservation of their own species. 2) To live their own life as happily and comfortably as possible. I just don't see how rights can be accorded by merit of intelligence/moral judgement, as you touched on, who decides which level had what rights? Each species is not on a point in the range of intelligence, there is \"much variation. We are at the top end, yet some of the other \"higher\" species are more intelligent than mentally retarded people, so why don’t they have equal rights? Other species have an equal \"understanding\" and feeling of pain and abuse; this is not pro- portional to a level of intelligence, but merely it is the responsibility of us, with our advanced intelligence and skills NOT to abuse others and to USE this sense of right and wrong that we seem so proud of. In the past mistreatment of women and blacks was not applauded but such things were not contested because they/we were believed to be inferior to the white male, and had no rights! The comparison is obvious. The battle against racism and sexism has been going on a long while - and will not stop until it has been won: the more recently started fight against \"specieism\" will run the same course. Maybe in twenty years time we’ll have insect liberation and I will have to stop splatting flies!! But as for plants, which we do need to eat, and bacteria etc., until some earth- shattering discoveries are made in science about them feeling anything them I find this direction to be a red herring. \"Animal rights vs. human rights?!\" The fight for animal rights can only be seen to conflict with human rights if you believe animals have no rights- back to above, you haven’t learned! If animals have rights they are equal to us. You have no right to kill or abuse another. Well, Richard, you may never change your views, but such a fight could never be won so quickly or easily. I am not the most committed animal liberationist, but I cannot accept the rights of any others to be questionable, and think that is the greatest barrier. Well, thanks for listening. If anyone wants to write from anywhere in the world (and/or swap records?), I’m here. Jenny/12-33 Victoria Centre/Nottingham NG1 3PJ, England Hey Mykel Board: How many men does is take to tile a bathroom? Five, if you slice them very thin. Ha, Ha, Ha.

You can easily ( find out by attending a BLACK FLAG concert. The next step is to oe too close to the stage, Holy Henry Rollins and his meat headed thug bouncers will be more than happy to inflict you with bodily harm. I was fortunate enough to experience this lovely atmosphere of violence on August 22nd at the Community Theater in Walla Walla, WA. The first two hands, TOM TROCCOLI’S DOG and SWA had no intention of assault on their audience, allowing people on and off the stage freely. The situation changed, though, as BLACK FLAG started. They gave absolutely no forewarning of their \"no stage diving or leaning too far over the stage\" policy. The entire night was filled with bouncers beatina and mauling people near the stage as they pleased. My personal injury list consisted of Holy Henry hitting me in the face with his microphone, and one of his more ignorant bouncers attacked me after the show, myself being 1/2 his size. I realize the BLACK FLAG reputation is not the greatest, but the crowd that supports them are so brainwashed by their rock stardom that they're afraid to take a stand, even when senseless violence and stupidity is put in their face. BLACK FLAG is supporting behavior they used to sing against . If the reasons for Mr. Rollins having redneck bouncers is because of assassins who want to kill him, he shouldn't be playing concerts where he openly abuses his fans, the very fans that buy all of BLACK FLAG'S rip off merchandise to keep Henry Rollins comfortable in his Cadillac and his corrupt wallet fat and happy. Rock stars (Henry and his crew of ignorants) they are, but should this be HATED IN THE NATION TOUR '85 Max R&R, Why is it everytime (sic) you review my stuff you have such a one track mind. So fuckin what if I like to sing about rape and drinking and fucking ect...(sic). It’s what I like to do. And I am the king of masturbation. But there is a purpose to it. It's my life. I don’t even think you listen to the stuff you just look at it and say oh it's GG so it sucks or it ain't cool. But I don't sit down and write a song my band just plays and I sing what comes to my head. Listen to Destroy Myself, I Wanna Die or Teachers Pet. Perfect examples of what I go through everyday. And what about my band? My band can kick fuckin ass and play there (sic) bloody fingers off but you refuse to metion (sic) that. We put our blood and guts into what we do so you owe it a full listen. I ain’t in a scene so I just hang out and get fucked up. When you grow up in a small town you drink, fight and fucL. I mean what else is there to do. Right now I’m sitting in my hospital bed in Dallas fx where I ended up 2 days after my gig at the twilite room. I got a blood infection from my self inflicted wounds. So this is where my 1st US toured (sic) ended out, in a fuckin hospital. The tour started out in Ohio where I broke myself in and got shut down by the cops for obscene and disorderly conduct. Them I went to Pioria (sic) II to so a gig with a graeat band called HATE. I got thrown out for takeing (sic) a shit on the stage and rubbing it on my body and flinging it at the crowd. So. Carolina was next and I made the whole set but not before I got a few girls pissed at me when I decided to drag em on stage by the hair during Im Gonna Rape You and Drinking My Own Piss Off The Floor. Yum and pulline down all the lights and cutting myself all to fuck. Memphis was great but I never did get to play cause someone fucked up the booking and I was a day late. Then it was Dallas. Now this hospital. Well I'll prob finish the tour in Oct-Nov. But I gotta go I aot a rock n roll nurse going to my head. Anybody got any shit send it to me for a GG ALLLIN ANND THE SCUMFUCS tape.

After reading MRR for quite a while, I’ve decided to write in and, I guess, have my say, for what it's worth. This letter is directeo to all, but particularly anyone who may have felt the way I have about punk, the scene, or life in general. Hopefully, it will make those who haven't a bit more aware, so here goes... Firstly, I'm 17 and I'm part Venezuelan, Indian, and French. Obviously, this would put me in a position to experience rascism, and I have in some ways. Many things have happened to change me and people I've known, but I'm not writing to cry over those because I've done all that and moved on. But,, because of those past events, I seriously questioned whether it was suffering due to punk, because of the vast amount of jerks who only believe in violence and total stupidity as a pass-off for punk, and who are the most noticeable. I had a close friend whoowas a really great skateboarder (originally from Ventura, CA). He was beaten up, to the point where he can hardly walk properly, by a couple of muscle-flexing pricks who didn't like skateboarders. I once came very close to being raped by a couuple of bastards who wanted to know what it was like to screw a \"spic\". There have been other times as equally frightening, as I'm sure there have been for other people. It seemed hardly worth it to constantly live in fear because of fags who are forever pissed, high, hard for a fight or a fuck. Even now, I'll never understand how anyone can even try to justify beating or raping someone for amusement or because of skin color, punk type, spike length, prick length. ..what's the fucken difference. Surely, we believe in punk ideals because we can’t believe in a society which is unjust and full of psychopaths already clearly raping us. Then why is it that once we\"re taken to punk, it seems no different because of those fucken idiots who'll never learn. The funny thing is that those same idiots have somehow come to the conclusion that they've got the edge in their little wars, probably because of our laissez-faire attitudes, but they're wrong. I now realize that, because they haven’t got minds, just fsts, and if they think that's enough, they're wrong again because people who aren't mindless are aware and angry and going to make them pay. That is if fear doesn't overpower sanity and strength as it did enough to make me think of giving up. But when a person lives in the suburbs with conservative, asshhole parents who think a punk-associated girl is a certified slut, no doubt, and the personn is disillusioned with punk, and their environment connsists entirely of brainless fuckers and other maggots, then there's not much else to live for. Well, that's what I thought, but now I'm a lot more aware. I know it's as if I’ve written my life story, but what this letter is all about is that with all these past experiences,, I know now that it is in the past and I can't blame aanyone. People who experienced a bad ordeal usually blame the scene or the people involved. Like myself, I used to blame skins because of what I had heard and seen, but then it could be any jerk who’d do the same, and besides, not all skins are alike; most importantly, not all people are alike, If anything is to be blamed, it's the ideas that take control of a person's mind and actions, like apathy, machoism, racism, sexism, etc., and these have to be fought with communication, understanding, love, etc. I’m not going to start about peace, it's great but sometimes oversimplified, but either you love someone or you hate someone. If you care, it’s not enough to talk, but do something to fight hate. What I was saying before is that blaming isn't going to accomplish a fucken thing; crying and pointing fingers is for shitheads. After it all, I'm getting back into it by trying to meet more people and not feeling sorry for myself or hiding. I've seen people go through a lot more pain than I did. Sure, I'm still fucken mad as hell, but doing something about it with positive action and I'm surviving. Anyone who has ever thought of killing themselves, or worse yet, getting out of punk, should just fucken forget it. Punk's too important and for us to prove it, every person counts to be strong, free and able to communicate. People are really fed up with that word, but what's so fucken difficult about talking to someone, maybe even helping them or yourself. Fuck, if it wasn't for the few real friends I have, I would have ended it a long time ago, but I’m alive and I'll stay that way. Thanks for hearing me out. If, in any way, this letter seems to make the Montreal scene seem worthless, it isn't true. The Montreal scene is the coolest and it’s thriving and Montreal bands are brilliant. Support your scene and work to make it best, f it's worth it. If anyone wants to communicate their problems or just write, please do. Shara Q./ P.O. Box 1547/ St. Laurent, Quebec/ H4L 4Z1/ Canada Hello MRR, This is a letter from England, the land that summer forgot. We're writing to let the world know that there is a town in the middle of England called Northampton which actually has the facilities to put on pretty good gigs. Basically, all we want to say is that seeing as American bands seem to be gettiing to England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland with more frequency, how about putting North- ampton on your tour maps. Our band (SEDITION) is not at all bad at arranging gigs. We have recently set up a gig for ANTISECT and DIRT, which will be followed a month later by a gig featuring ANNIE ANXIETY and The ALTERNATIVE. Both of these gigs will be at a local community centre called the Road Mender, which in days gone by hosted gigs by such notables as CRASS, The U.K. SUBS KILLING JOKE, POISON GIRLS, and even The EXPLOITED. More recently, The POISON GIRLS played there again. BALAAM AND THE ANGEL (gothic posi-punk band) and The THREE JOHNS (alternative socialist band) have also played there recently. We are also in the process of trying to get the use of a rastafarian centre called the M.F.M., which seems to be interestedd in encouraging local white kids to make more use of their facilities DI3.UXI: 4- 12” VINYL AMEBIX / Arise!

Our band, SEDITION, played there in November of last year with ANTISECT, ANNIE ANXIETY, NO DEFENCES and KAMA SUTRA, a gig that went very well. DISORDER, CHAOS U.K., LEUAKAEMIA, and several other thrash bands played there a bit later--a gig that was badly marred by the anti-social behavior of a group of skinheads that can not have helped towards a good atmosphere for co-operation, but fortunately the people who run the M.F.M. are willing to give us another chance. So there are two venues for bands to play in Northampton . Northampton is centrally located 60 miles north of London on the Ml, the most well- used motorway in Britain, and is easy to reach from a lot of large towns and cities and with good advertising we can get good crowds at the gigs. We can also help with the provision of equipment and provide a place for bands to stay. So get in contact with us, we can probably set up gigs in other towns as well or put you in contact with people who can. This infor- mation applies to all English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and European bands who are interested as well, in fact any bands in the world who are interested. One thing we cannot do is guarantee the amount of money you will receive because that depends on how much is taken at the door. We will do our best to give you as much as we possibly can. ..Thank you. Mark and Alan. PiRr KvTfSuT P.S. While we're at it , we have noticed a few inaccuracies concerning ANTISECT (friends of ours) in MRR and so we thought we'd give you the facts. Since the album was released, 4 people have left the band and one has joined. In one report it was said, \"Pete (the tallest of the two singers) left them a while back (due to his dislike of metal).\" In fact, his name is Rich and his leaving was nothing to do with a \"dislike of metal\". Also in the Aug. '85 issue we read that Rich factually Pete) had left due to drug problems. He had left but does nol have a drug problem. John the new bass player, has not left the band. They are still together as a 3-piece band. They are also planning to release a single and an album in the near future. SEDITION/ c/o 29 Margaret St./ Northampton/ England. Dear MRR; Just a letter to clear up a few points about the current UK scene: Kalv states that \"we are now going through the most intense period of HC activity.\" But, I ask myself, other than musicwise, has there been any real progress? Most British punks (for want of a better word) have no or little real interest in new British Hardcore, let alone foreign punk (most British bands, in my opinion, are a pile of shit anyway. Like Kalv says, they're usually just imitations of other bands). Foreign punk is very difficult and expensive to obtain and British punk is lacking in availability. If you're unemployed, it's difficult to be able to afford 7 pounds for a foreign LP or 2.50 pounds for singles, and it's not much cheaper buying from distributors. As for the statement that \"practically all the audience at gigs are into foreign stuff, \" well to me that's a load of Bollocks. In general, your \"average\" British punk (such a thing does exist!) is a reactionary idiot whose only interest is in achieving an illusion of radicalism. It would be great if all the kids who shout the lyrics at, say, CONFLICT gigs would turn up to support actions such as \"Stop the City,\" but most of them are too apathetic to take part in actions, and would rather spend their cash and time getting drunk or drugged up to save themselves from life on the dole, about which they're always complaining (life’s what you make of it). This Death Metal thing also pisses me off, O.K? Fair enough if you like the music, but don't pretend you’re \"fucking the system\" by B 4 or 5 quid to see bands like Venom and ca. The capitalist shits are just fucking you over. I get really annoyed when punks who slag off the EXPLOITED turn around and pay 5 pounds for a gig. Bands like the ENGLISH DOGS and ONSLAUGHT are nothing more than Greedos with spikey hair. As Vote Vasko said, \"We're punks and we should remember what we stand for and what we're against.\" It seems that even decent bands such as HUSKER DU and the AMBIX have copped out into the capitalist game, relatively expensive LP's, and charging high door prices at gigs. It seems that the same old capitalistic exploitation still exists (\"punk gear,\" records, high gig prices, etc.) and elitist secretarian attitudes still abound even among so-called \"anarchist\" punks who are just as elitist as the \"Mohican and Studs” brigade they so condemn. Before punk, HC changes anything it needs to weed out the shit and put its own house in order or it will always remain (on the whole) just a safety valve for kids’ aggression and frustration. Yes, that's right, punk's dead. It’s just another cheap product for the consumer's head and is destined to remain so i/nless things change. Yours, anarchy, anger, and frustration, Liptus Hectus/ 29 DeVitre Green/ Woringham/ Berkshire, England RG11 1SE Dearest MRR Readers, Does anybody realize what's happening? We've found another reason to fight against our fellow punks. This time it's the extreme of females vs. males. Since when are we ones to stereotype anyone, anywhere? I honestly think this is getting way out of hand. Ms. Dough-Boi, where do you get off putting all guys into one category, saying, \"guys think their ultimate goal in life is to have sex, and to have it with as many girls as possible\"? That's the same as a guy saying all girls are sluts! Doesn’t anybody think about what’s really going on? I think Tim said it best: \"both sexes are abusing the shit out of each other.\" By statements like Dough-Boi's the whole purpose is defeated. Girls are trying to tear down one barrier (the sexism guys have been known to hold) by building another (girls holding this against all guys). Isn't it time to start working together to build something mutually, rather tnan creatiing something that can only harm so many aspects of not only the scene, but the bettered society we are trying to create. The beginning of Dough-Boi's letter was great; the whole attitude was exactly what needs to be created ( RESPECT for everyone's rights), then the whole light changed to a closed-minded editorial. If a girl is going to go out with some guy, it's up to her to use her discretion. Nobody is going to look out for her but herself. Stop trying to wimp out and blame it solely on the guys - it does take two to tango. I'm sure there are plenty of closed-minded assholes out there ready to fuck the brains out of any unsuspecting girl, but that doesn't mean you have to lie there with your legs spread! Start taking action for yourself, be leery of what you're doing, and avoid any situations you don’t want to get into. I think you’ll find if you’re not so willing to jump into the sack, and try to be friends first (oh Jesus, I sound like my mother), things will work out a hell of a lot better. And I know it\"s true, after going through countless \"boyfriends\" (3 week fucks) and a rape, I’ve learned that all it takes is mutual (key word) respect, and a bit of ambition to be more than somebody's lay. Now I'vegot the best guy in the world who loves and respects me as much as I do him; we've been going out for three years now. All I’m saying is, girls, quit bitching and start doing. If you don't want something to happen, don't let it; if you want something more, make it happen. Only you can put the effort forward, nobody else, if the guy ends up taking off, it wasn’t worth your time anyway. Just don't let anyone take advantage, it's your life. LIVE IT! Robin Collins/ 7736 Beryl Ave./ Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730 Dear MRR: This letter is for all punks. It seems I have been having a crisis of faith with the punk movement today. For some reason, I feel it has lost some of its energy and committment that it surely had in 1 982. With all the drop-outs and the influx of \"Metalheads,\" I began to worry that punk rock was entering a real decline. Maybe because things weren’t changing overnight, people became frustrated and felt it was easier to give up than to fight for something (love, freedom) that didn’t seem attainable. Hopefully, I won’t give up and will continue to believe that this will someday be a better world. People cannot go and play MEATMEN records and brag about being anti-conformist punk rocker. Things will not change if that is the general attitude at shows. A real attitude to have is a political and social one (this does not mean you will become communist). It will mean you give a shit about yourself, the man next to you, and the future of this earth. I really believe that. It sucks to see people treating each other like shit and acting like that is a normal way to behave. It feels better to look at another person when both are smiling, not frowning. Wouldn't it be great if the whole world could smile at each other and not worry about asshole governments fucking everyone over? The guys with the bombs and cash are running the show and will continue to run it as long as the brainwashed, programmed masses accept this as the way things should be. Wouldn't it be great to be able to wake up one day and do what you really want, not what you have to do or are supposed to do. Enough rattling for me. But please, try to believe in punk rock. What it can help to accomplish if you let it. I hate to think that nothing will change and sometimes I get pissed off and think things won't because most people don’t give a shit. But, I think people inside their hearts do give a shit and want change. If you do stop believing, that would be one more victory for the established system. Don't give up. WALK TOGETHER, ROCK TOGETHER, LONG LIVE PUNK, listen to your heart and help make this the kind of world where everyone can be happy and live as one. Thanks, John/ Philadelphia, PA MRR, I'm sick and tired of hearing that hardcore should be brought above ground so we can \"convert the masses\" into \"thinking for themselves\". You know where that got us in 1977, right? To me, hardcore is group therapy. Therapy groups can't throw open their doors and descend upon the world seeking to save it from its troubles. I think we could do more good if we let the interested and needy find us, retreat further underground, and use hardcore as a tool to better ourselves. It worked wonders for me, but I don’t think Average Joe would appreciate it as any more than a new fad. And remember - punk is like heroin. Those who really need it will somehow find it. For more on the above subject, write - G. McNett/ 9 Park Circle/ Short Hills, NJ 07078 P S. On \"converting the world\" - \"You can't teach a pig to sing. It only wastes your time and annoys the pig.\" - Samuel Langhoorne Clemens Hello: I'm writing in regards to the ill-fated Posse Country compilation tape. Due to lack of money, too much beer, and my own stupidity, the tape was never mass-produced or distributed beyond a very local level. However, I need to hear from 4 of you who sent me money and never got a tape. Bob Farrington, Dan Dahlquist, Jeff- DEADLY RITE, and Lars Kvam, please write me with you addresses and I'll send your money and something else along the lines of a tape (local Wisconsin demo or something) to help compensate for this bullshit. Thanks for your interest and trust, though I'm sorry I haven’t earned it. Also, I apologize to all the bands on the tape who put a lot of work into it and never got shit. These bands were/are hard working and definately deserved more organization on my part: SUBURBAN MUTILATION, NO RESPON- SE, ART THIEVES, DEADLY RITE, NO, DEPO-PROVERA, THE MESS, and MORAL DISGUST. Some are gone, some still play and have products. If you can, check them (or their music) out, and I'll guarantee you'll not be disappointed! I wanted to do the tape (and had serious intentions of doing well) to document the great music that has come out of North East Wisconsin in the past few years. Somewhere along the line, it bacame too much for me to handle and, putting the blame where it is due, I fucked up. Again, I apologize to all bands and people who supported the tape- if I do anything in the future, I will not disappoint you. Thanks, Brendon Krueger/ 144 E. Gorham St. #1 B/ Madison, Wl 53703 Dear People: I'm living here on a commune. Our goal is to be a non-violent, non-sexist, egalitarian society. We're doing O.K., but we're human and it takes time to unlearn things ingrained. We live on 450 acres of green Virginia land. We are 60% self-sufficient in the food department. We live pretty comfortably (too comfortably, maybe? I sort of had this romantic notion of \"living off the land\".) We're sort of soft here, we do compromise in some ways, but we’re ecologically aware and we do things accordingly. No gurus here, we're a bunch of sometimes clashing personalities, somehow co-existing, trying to make it work. People do not leave a lot, though, to go on to other things. I'd like to see more people visit or live here that I could relate to on a music level, besides other things. The people here are interesting and often intellectual, but I miss talking about music, or listening to my kind of music with someone who appreciates it. I also wanted to let some people out there know that they do have an alternative to the way we're now living. Write to me or Keenan, Visitor Manager if you want more info. I have some free BlACK FLAG flyers if anyone wants them. Peace, Gigi Fauquet/ Twin Oaks Community/ Louisa, VA 23093 Dear Fanzine Editors, We here at One Solution want to get your fanzine into Toronto. We also want to get our fanzine into your town! If you are interested in trading 25 fanzines (that is if the cover price is the same) or more according to cover price, please send us a copy. This way each of us makes back all our money by selling each other's zines. I'll trade with almost anybody, but send me a sample of your zine first. All zines have to be in English. Metal or hardcore zines welcome. One Solution/ 187 Neville Pk./ Toronto, Ontario, M4E 3P7/ Canada Dear MRR, This is an open letter to any bands that may be reading. When you write on your records and in zine interviews things like, \"Please write to us; we'll send you free flyers and stuff, all letters answered, we love to receive mail,\" please back these statements up with some truth. Many bands whom my friends and I have written to (and I could name names r but I won't) don';t write back for squat. Hey, if it weren't for the folks who bought your records and went to your gigs, you'd still be hanging out in the garage. I don’t want to slight many people who do answer their mail and clearly do care about their fans, most notably Jello Biafra, 76% UNCERTAIN, HUMAN THERAPY, and HUSKER DU, but for those of you who have let two or three months of mail accumulate in a drawer, get on it, okay? Thanx, Mike N./ 51 Longview, Port Washington, NY 11050 Dear MRR: We are Society Anonymous, and we are based in San Francisco. We are a group of individuals who are involved in doing productive projects for the scene. We're sure that your readers will be interested, and want to somehow be involved as well. Here's a brief rundown on what we're about, and some of the projects we are working on. MUSIC: S.A. collects and trades live rare recordings and demos. These tapes are for trade only, not for sale or resale. We trade with people and groups from all over the world. The underground tape trading scene has proven to be very successful, and is a productive experience for all involved. PUBLICATION PROJECTS: This is where we need help. SA is in the process of compiling a publication called 'The Formica Convent Hies\". It will mostly be a trading zine as well as international scene reports, reviews, obscure fiction, photos, comics/art, etc. But most important will L ' our trading classified section where we will print the FOfc vfAfL- WITH\" __ O.SVFOpOPFAKViV ^PFFDCORF, A We WAV/F, |li CFLFAS“FS* t MUCH MOI2F/ CONTACT OS*/ l ^ r •wpro m jUUcl, wjOopoS taoogS mmL r \" 1301^2*6592 ..jt'JiMOOQCil jOGOQflMMi names and addresses of people who trade tapes. We will also have a section for touring bands, so please send any info you can. Also, spread the word that for this first issue, ALL CLASSIFIED ADS WILL BE FREE. (Deadline around the end of August). So far, word of mouth has brought us quite a few good connections, and we'd like to thank all of the cool people who have been such a big help (mostly Kurt Braun in L.A. - hi!). Hopefully, if you print this letter we will reach many other prospective traders and productive individuals. It is very important to keep this network alive and growing. Society Anonymous/ 2022 Taraval, Ste 8510/ S.F., CA 94116 Dear MRR: I'm writing just to express some opinions First off, the other day I was talking to this girl about the arms race, and she said the reason we are in the arms race is because Russia wants to be the most powerful nation in the world. The United States just builds missiles for defense. I think that's wrong, but I've noticed a lot of people believe that. I think both the U.S.A. and Russia's leaders want their countrys to be the most powerful, and both country’s leaders tell the people their missiles are for defense They use propaganda just like we do. I f you don’t think so, ask yourself this question. Who’s the U.S.A.’s biggest enemy? Russia will probably be what you think of. Why? They're not the only communist country in the world, and the Russian public doesn’t know the truth about how we live, and we don’t know the truth about how they live. But still I see ’’Fuck Russia” bumper stickers, \"Kill a Commie for Mommie, \" T-shirts, and all kinds of other stupid shit. That kind of mentality leads our government to believe that we'd better kick their ass then tryinq talking to them to prevent WWIII. People have told me that I sound anti-american. I'm not anti-american, but I’m not anti- any other country either. I'm anti-war, and the power hungry governments who cause them. Also why do people assume that the Russian public are .52 n ? mies? ,s everyone here a Republican or 100% supportive of what their government does? I bet they’re not either. I 'm sorry, I don’t have a blind hatred for everyone in Russia Anyway, me and some friends are trying to start a totally non-profit tape-compilation service The tapes will be very affordable. We are interested in bands around the world. Bands please send demo-tapes, any info about your band, lyrics, etc., and we will try to get the tapes as much exposure as possible. Thank you Fanzine P.O. box 10094/ Scottsdale, A Z 85271 Dear MRR: I'd like to comment on a band that I had the luck of catching their act (Which isn't an act at all). This band was honest and faced solid issues with their music. The lead singer Painkiller Paul.\" had so much energy always moving around, and the lyrics were intense. He looked like he ate a dog for lunch. He shaves his head, but he says he's not a skinhead. \"I'm not anything but myself, I don't classify myself be yourself. If you follow trends and fads you lose yourself,\" he said onstage. \"I'm a drunk not a punk.\" On guitar is \"Wild Bill,\" who comes up with the off-the-wall riffs and changes. Just watching him play that thing is worth seeing this band And how the rhythmn section Jeff (drums) and Breden \"Swamp Thing” (Bass). Jeff also sings back-ups in some songs. The band I'm writing about is the PAINKILLERS. My comment is that I think it's a shame that a band hke this has hard times getting gigs. They play a lot of house parties, mainly 472 Grant St last winter and spring. But, then some lady moved in downstairs and won’t allow the ”472 Grant K in aownstairs and won’t allow the \"472 Grant $$$$$&? “ tr ’$$$$ vje eU Ga© e viWat coflS ,11 is * aVte ^ ., 6 ^o°° nw* Game'? w a i» TTeasec B asi. ca ^i^ eU ’ 9 101 o i rUtn °*ere *° ** q eT&oa^ Jerry * a , oV ity otiiy com!* fa eT e rs vie pla jer9 in 106* \\)y ycu ■ • ^ ( $$i $$$$ $$$ $$$ . gaios^ ^otOer^^g st ° V f TY\\e 1*6 \\° s e*«« c '/£e» a Wfc $$$!) $$$$ $ $S $ . fsferg* a as*\"-' *» r„ 8 W e free ®°toll-* re - e eC °dvseO^ out re aoj 10 p u ° io Game • wide $$$$$ k 7* I'd® toe - r/W SS _ oovJ 003 a tioovi^e — Game i s ” H ,s Vtfie B^l^drea - otf Gang\" to have band parties without the cops showing up PAINKILLERS threw a \"Summer Awakening 85 gig with other local bands like Corner- 7At £lL£fy\\ ’ ent ^stances • for . ^ [ bIaUMONTS, MAJOR ADEPT, fI^I-r9. ENERATiON ' THE MOMENT, f!^ KE S, «97£ TO ’ and TEMPLE of c.h.u.d. Also, SLAW MOUTH and a couple of Toronto bands. It was an all age show. It gave the bands a bigger audience and the younger crowd a place to go. But, some young jerks punched holes in the walls of the rented hall and shot off the fire extinguisher and tossed it through the window. \"Painkiller Paul” went up onstage and screamed how \"people complain there's nowhere to go and nothing to do We give you a place to come and watch bands. Fuck, you go and ruin it for everybody you've got no fucking respect for anything.\" The crowd 200 +, cheered him on and he said \"Don't fucking patronize me. When you see someone causing damage, tell on them, ’coz they’re ruining it for you, too!\" Needless to say that hall no longer had bands playing there. I asked Painkiller Paul if the band had plans for tourinq or recording. He replied, \"When I get $5 together , I buy a pack of cancer cigarettes and a cheap 6-pack. I’m not going to toss it in the bank hoping that I can tour on it some day \" this band ca,,ed THE PAINKILLERS will just become a memory but ? ne ^ never forget. The band's motto is .Before they MX America, let’s RX the world \" Well from snow bound Buffalo, NY. Take care Love, Karen Dear MRR Here in the mighy town of Visalia, CA my friend and I put out a fanzine called Who Cares? The punks in this town are growing fewer and fewer each day and are regressing to more primative subcultures as hippies, trendies, metalers, and so on. I say they are primative because as they regress, they transform into mind-wasted forms of garbage. What happened to their beliefs? Did they ever have any? Are they just seeking a fad? As I read newspapers, and watch T.V., I see that the psychedelic style is coming back, stronger than ever. I also see many punks getting sucked into this \"phenomenon\". Punks throwing away all of their ideas and trading them in for LSD. Then they give a bunch of excuses for using it like, \"It makes me understand the way life really is,\" and \"It makes me do...\" and so on. To experience life, you must use a clean mind. LSD doesn't solve things, it is just an escape from reality. If any real punks or anyone who feels like I do about this subject please write to me. I heard that REAL punks don't write letters, so maybe some of you can make an exception. If anyone is interested in receiving our fanzine please inquire about it. We also print swell stickers here. The fanzines and stickers are free, but postage isn’t, so try to help us out on the postage if you want, and can afford it. Write first and we can arange some kind of deal. With so few punks left in town, we have quite a surplus of fanzines that need to get to punks that want to read them. We encourage communication and would like to hear from anyone who has anything to say. Thanks all! Und Ich spreche deutch, ein bisschen! Gimpy/ Who Cares? fanzine/ 2401 Pecan/ Visalia, CA, 93277 To Helga the Elder , hfi! I wrote a letter to you, but it came back to me through the mails - and the name \"Elder\" was highlighted. If you'd like to write to me, could you give me your full name and address, and send it to me directly? ( Not through the MRR magazine.) I'm 30 years old and I'd really like to get acquainted with you! Thanx. Sincerely, Ann Aust/ 441 W. 49th #8/ NY, NY 10019 Dear MRR: Here in Chicago, IL, we have been having trouble keeping our scene going in the midst of Nazi punk agitation. A recent punk rock benefit for \"Infact\" (an anti-nuclear weaponry coalition) was shut down before it barely began due to a brawl of Nazi's vs. others, which literally filled the street outside the show. I opened a forum in a magazine called \"Positive Force\" which I'd like to open up to people all over the world. If you’ve got a view, please send it to R. Forster, 501 W. Second St., Elmhurst, IL 60126 (If you're interested in a magazine too, send stamps and I'll see what I can dol FIGHTING VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE Recent incidents of violence which have been plaguing the Chicago punk scene bring to mind the degeneration of similar punk scenes in L.A., San Francisco, New York, and elsewhere. In the worst cases, punk shows become palaces of violence for groups of closed-minded thugs. A thriving, unified scene cannot exist under such conditions. One solution to this problem which has been thrown about recently in the Chicago scene is attempting to force the thugs into submission with threats and actual acts of violence in return. The generally ugly political philosophies of the thugs helps people justify their acts of violence against these bullies as a form of vigilante justice, since police and other groups often seem unwilling or unable to take action. In this and the next few issues of this magazine we hope to present many different views of the pros and cons of such aggressive action. Addendum: Recently, a flyering campaign attempted to inform scene supporters about the main perpetrator of the Nazi violence— A Mr. Clark Martell. It was very well-received and supported. That convinces me even more that it is possible to intimidate bullies without stooping to their tactics. Dear MRR: There's a new Hardcore/Political radio show in Vancouver. \"85 R.P.M.\" will be on the air Wednesday at midnight on Vancouver Co-op radio, 102.7 F.M. The show will be broken down into roughly 70% music/ 30% interviews, political commentary, etc. So, we need lots of new music. Send tapes and records. They will most definitely get airplay! We're also interested in airing taped interviews with bands from other cities and countries. If any bands, fanzines, etc. are interested in doing this, contact us. Lastly, any bands wanting to play Vancouver can contact us for setting up gigs. Take care. 85 R.P.M./ c/o Dave/ 1616 E. 2nd Ave./ Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V5N 1C9 ATTENTION ALL TOURING BANDS: This is Landshark Marc, the local contact/ promoter in jolly old Amarillo, Texas. I've been out of town for the summer, but I am now back in town and ready to bring in any band interested in playing here. The scene here is getting bigger every moment and shows are happening on a regular basis. In the past, we've had such bands as BATTALION OF SAINTS, RAW POWER, THE BREAKOUTS, HUMAN THERAPY, WHY THINK, and FT13. There is one local hardcore band here, PEACES OF HATE, and another one on the way. I can set up all-ages shows at a warehouse we lease with virtually no police harrassment at all. We're located dead center in the Texas panhandle on Interstate 40, and can provide bands with a place to stay, also. So, if any bands are interested in coming through, give me a call at (806) 358-0988 or write to Landshark Marc/ 6201 W. 54th, #106B/ Amarillo, TX 79109. Thanks. Dear MRR: On March 1st. I sent Dave Ratcage of Ratcage Records in New York City and order for a Sims Jeff Phillips skateboard for $97.50. In April, I received a letter from him saying the model was not in stock and that I could either wait or order another. I chose to wait and later in May I wrote him asking where the board was. In June, he sent a letter saying Ratcage Records was going out of business and I would receive a refund in a postal money order in a few weeks. In July, I sent a letter asking him where my $97.50 was. It’s now September 13th, more than 6 months after I first ordered the board, and I have yet to receive the money. I'm pretty sure Dave Ratcage would be impossible for me to locate on my own (I live in Arizona), so since he apparently never received my letter, I wonder if anyone out there knows where he is or can track him down because I need the money! Such business activities are surprisingly coming from such an \"anarchist- minded” relatively famous punk rock figure (he used to even write New York City scene reports for MRR). Maybe, this is an isolated case, but I find it hard to believe that both my letter asking for the money and his check were lost in the mail. Anyone who has any information on the whereabouts of Dave Ratcage, please write me. Any of you staffers at MRR, please print this and give me any info you can. I'm not rich enough to get a lawyer. Amanda Focht/ 1650 E. 10tn/ Tucson. AZ 85729. Hi There: This is aimed towards all you misguided people (guys and gals) in any \"punk\" scene wherever on this planet. You know who you are- the image \"punks,\" the trouble-making assholes. I'm kind of sick of you all. Look, I don't care if you've hair down to your ass, a mohawk, no hair, dress up in the latest \"punkwear\" or have a skateboard permanently attached to your feet- just BE REAL! Look how you want to, do what you want to BUT be honest and smart about it all and fucking respect other people and their rights, too! No need for cockiness and disruptive behaviour- it's all a front to hide a scared, insecure REAL YOU. Are you under the impression that by \"looking punk” and \"acting punk,\" you will have justified some obvious deep-down problem of yours?- \"Oh, I got totally drunk and acted like an asshole at the gig, but I'm a punk and I can fucking well do as I want!\" You just ruin it for others and lose their respect for you. So, you scoff at other peoples' respect for you (\"All this respect stuff is fucking shit\"). You obviously don't have any respect for yourself and that’s kind of sad. Are r ou afraid people won't like you, the real you? ley, they don't like you as you are now, so how can things be any worse if you dropped the whole facade of \"I’m a punk and this is the way I'm allowed to act?\" Take the time to sit down and think about why you act like you do- what makes you think you have to act like a stereotypical \"punk\"? You’re no stereotypical anything, you’re you, a unique individual and, dammit, the rest of us want to see that real you! Shit, don't be scared, okay? Life's too short to hide, you know. BE REAL! I'm just so goddamn tired of fakeness and fear and people who are sucked in by the media's image of what a ^punk\" should be like and who can't be original enough by just being themselves! Enough of my ranting- just think about it, okay? Take care.. Love and honesty, Maureen/ 11716- 85 St./ Edmonton, ALTA.

With the changing of the seasons come some changes to MRR . Moving up from San Diego and his Leading Edge zine to join us is Martin Sprouse, hopefully bringing with him some new ideas and energy. He’ll be sharing the day-to-day shitwork and planning with me, and Martin's influence should start showing up soon, both graph- ically (bigger photos???) and philosophically (he's a serious- ly funny guy) . Of course, all the rest of the shitworkers will be around as usual, so there will be continuity as well as a fresh outlook. One last item: Jeff is back in grad school to study his specialty, authoritar- ian (especially ultra-f ascist ) organizations, and though his output in MRR has dropped sub- stantially in recent months, he will be contributing (so he says, and we hope) many columns or articles on this and other related subjects during the next year, as well as a few choice record review?. Onward. UKay DucKaroos. Let's get a tew things straight. I DO NOT live in San Francisco. I r m getting sick and tired of going to DC or New Jersey and having people ask me what I’m doing on the East Coast. I live in New York City. Just because I write for MRR and enjoy an occasional bend-over-boy, does not mean I live in San Francisco. When I kiss someone, I don't relish the idea of having a mustache scrape the underside of my nose. Besides, how could people imagine that I would live in a city where the baseball team can’t even win half its games. Also, how could anyone think that I could take more than a week in that ninth circle of liberal-fascist hell? Do you know that there’s a law in San Francisco that says if one person in an office of 500 does not smoke, then either the boss has to build a separate room just for that person, or NO ONE in the entire office can smoke? They don't as yet have mandatory vege- tarianism, but they will. They were one of the first places with a 21 -year old drinking age, and they check everyone, everywhere!! I know more people who have had cop trouble in San Fran- cisco than in East Germany. The difference between New York and San Francisco is the difference between the VELVET UNDERGROUND and THE GRATE- FUL DEAD. So please, I live in New York City. If you want to write me, wirte me here (unless it’s for publication, or a letter bomb, in which case send it to the guys in SF). My address is 75 Bleeker St., New York, NY 10012. I don't take collect calls. Also, unless you are ex- tremely attractive, don’t pop in for an un- announced visit. As far as writing me goes, I answer most letters, but it usually takes me a long time. That brings me to the main topic of this month's column. It’s based on two letters I’ve gotten in direct response to things printed in this column. The first is from Dave who does Run It fanzine (17 Poplar St., Waterbury, CT 06708) HunJl, by the way, is a clever little zine that has the balls to ask Jello Biafra \"Do you find a lot of people sort of treat you as if you were daddy?\" Anyway, Dave writes, ’’You said that you love it when (stupid totalitarian feminist or otherwise) people complain about you - I interpret this as a suggestion that the intent of your column-type thing in MRR is, in part, to provoke; hum. Is this really a safety net? What I'm suggesting is that (whether you realize it or not), you're allowing yourself to say, ”1 really didn’t mean it, I just wrote that so you'd complain,\" as a defense whenever you find your ass is in deep water. By encouraging com- plaints, possibly you're admitting that you don't care what people think of your ideas 'cuz you don t actually support those ideas yourself. What is it , bub? So you intend what you write to be taken seriously (to an extent that it will be considered a valid arguement), or are you fucking off just so that your mom will see all the mail you get and think that you have lots of friends? Do tell! - Dave\" Okay, Dave, I'll tell. I don’t write anything I don't believe. Feminists cause more rape than pornography (and they have less of a sense of humor). Vegetarians have no moral superiority over carni/omnivores. Kiddie-porn is fine as long as there's no coercion. People who throw bombs and kill for a politically correct reason (without being physically attacked first) are just as big assholes who throw bombs and kill for a politically bad reason. We should resist lin- guistic totalitarianism or new-speak of any kind So-called cripples are often morally and socially superior to the \"able-bodied.\" It’s as bad to judge a person solely on the fact that ;kinher J — he’s a skinhead, as it is to judge a person solely on the fact that he's a Negro. Yep Dave, I believe it all. But there's more to it than that. I DO like the fact that people complain about what I write. That means that what I’ve written is being read, and thought important enough to respond to. The intelligent responses I often answer privately, sometimes I've even become friends with those who disagreed. The stupid Mykel-Board-is-an-asshole how-can-you-let-him-write-for-you,he-should-be sold-off-to-the-pet-store-for-pirhana-food letters are entertaining. I love anything that shows anger stupidity without me having to make a word of comment. As for the STYLE, yep, it's abrasive. I try to hurt like sand in KY. I had one letter writer ask me if I were Ed Anger. I took it as a compliment. After all, who do YOU read first in the Weekly World N^yy^? | am abrasive to get read. I am abrasive to stir up emotions and force people to at least look at thoughts they never before considered. What the fuck do I care if someone wants to suck down spinach soup for the rest of their lives? My attack was not on vegetarians, but on vegetarianism. It was on the placid, thoughtless assumption that this new left-wing punk fad was obviously correct, good, healthy, and on and on. My attack was on this kind of trendy acceptance of whatever's \"in\" at the moment. Vege- tarianism is no less trendy than looking at Madonna. People have written letter to Tim asking him why he continues to print my column when I appear so much at odds with \"the basic philosophy of MRR.\" I can’t speak for the guy, but I bet at least part of the answer is that he too likes this stirring up. He is no more interested in faddish fashion followers than I am. But what about me, if I really believe this stuff, how come I'm still writing for Moscow-punk's house organ? That brings me to the next letter. I’tsfrom John, a well-known anti-MRRer. John writes: \"You ever stop and figure if you'd ever stop writing for MRR, the only fojumnist oldTY'd have left is himself? And e the rag is for his own legitimize his claims of being a democratic forum. You’ve become the whipping boy for the entire p-rock psychotic left.\" Well, here I am still writing for MRR. First I II tell you the real reason, then I’ll tell you a noble reason that I'll have made up by the time I finish writing down the real reason. It's the fame, the girls, the booze, the free meals. Whereever I go, people come up to me and say, \"Hey, you write for MRR! You wanna stay at my house and eat all my food and drink all my beer and screw my 12 year old sister?\" I play in a Rock N Roll band, ARTLESS. I ve had three bands before it, put out a whole bunch of records, appeared in a Huey Lewis video (really!), but how do people know me? From writing for MRR. I’ve been in 45 states and 20 countries. I constantly meet people who know me through my column. Why do you think everyone thinks I live in San francisco? Even though most of the people I meet already hate me, they are perversely fascinated enough to take me home to their friends. Okay, I've thought of my noble reason now. John is right. MRR is the focus of the left-wing pinko-punks. If those are the people that I want to say YOU'RE WRONG to, what better place than in these very pages? So’ many punk bands preach to the converted. It's my interest to convert the preached-to. I couldn’t show people the other side if they were already ON the other side. This is my chance, and I again thank Tim and the gang for giving it to me whatever their motive. Well, that's it for this month. Keep those letters coming. (Dave Run-lt sent me a chari- cature of myself.) I'll answer most everything vou send to me. Keep the complaints coming to *RR. It shows you're thinking. Oh yeah, two more things. First, I forgot to mention a great girl, Lee Jenkins, who helped me get through Winston-Salem, North Carolina without turning into REM. I had her name written on a piece of paper so I wouldn't forget to mention her, and then I forgot where I put the piece of paper. Second, my band ARTLESS will be doing a US tour in October to promote Placebo's release of our 12\" record: One Side of Artless (It's got songs on one side and my face engraved on the other.) If you know of a place in your town for us to play, please write to me at the New York address, right away!! Otherwise look for the band. Come and see us play. You won't like us at all. ft I am three weeks pregnant. The nurse at the hospital who calculated back to my last period said six weeks, but I remember exactly how it happened. We were making the beast with two backs, you know, unleashing from the camel, and it was beginning to feel good. Usually, I am extremely cautious, even overprotective, of these kinds of situation. Clutching at my parts can sometimes put a damper on the atmosphere but does lend kindly to the population crisis. This time I did not want to stop. We get so little gratification from the chore of life, I was hoping to sink into the groove and bring it home, big time. But it was over in a matter of seconds and I will have to live with the consequences for the rest of my life. The worst part is not realizing anything had happened down there. It would have been a little consoling if I thought I had at least given my partner pleasure, but at the time I thought he had gotten bored and fallen asleep. Silly me. My first reaction to the untimely news of my condition was laughter; the phrase \"If you want to dance you have to pay the piper\" doesn’t even apply here. It was more a death crawl into the steamy pit of hell to ring Satan's bell. How can one be serious with a stranger's seed creating a monster in my body? Truely a Twilight Zone situation. All communication failed, despite my suicidal wish that something positive could come out of this scenario. My partner, so overwhelmed with the news, departed into cerebral places known only to the brainsick, leaving behind a blank, gaping stare and dull sullen eyes petrified with mental neglect. He left me to deal with the entire mess by myself. It is better this way. I expected to have to do it myself; it seems our society has forgotten to teach its men what to do once they get their toys. I am going to get an abortion quickly. However painful, I feel I have no choice. I have no money and no security. Perhaps I am blameless and perhaps it is entirely my fault that I am in a position in life where I cannot take responsibility for my action. I do not know. I d <2 know the decision to abort cements even more firmly that I am living in an era of isolation and solitude. Acutely I feel I have little to offer a community based on family and Rotary Clubs, urban intimacy and PTA meetings. If I told my parents, they would be devestated, because my actions could be interpreted as nihilistic and destructive. I do not want to do it; I cannot stand killing of any kind. However, it is Catch 22. 1 cannot validate my lifestyle by rushing out and having the surgery without remorse as much as I cannot have a child without all-consuming guilt. Once again I find myself in a very solitary spot And to make matters worse, my own body is betraying me. The hormonal change has made me docile and complacent. What a traitor. It is preparing itself for procreation. It is making me feel, despite all endeavors, this is the best and most wonderful thing I can ever do. Having a child in our species is considered to be the ultimate in achievements. The continuation of humankind is a powerful euphoric drive. It is also a sick concept. If this is all I am capable of, if in order to participate in our societal documentation I will have to say I am proud of it-here is a trophy, a monument to remember by — no thanks. And with that thought, I am off to Kaiser Hospital without self-abasement or drinking the cup of humiliation to the dregs. Independence has a very high price, but abortions are free. P.S. I will never forget the kindness of my friends during the affair. They are the tru>ly gods and goddesses and will live forever in my heart. presented some of them to people involved here, but I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might have too. Please feel free to write and hopefully you'll notice the changes. One immediate innovation will start with issue #31. We will be having a fanzine list made up of those who send one in for trade or review. The list will contain each fanzine, address, price, contents, printing format, and size. These will not be reviews, only brief descriptions of each fanzine. If you wish to have your zine on the list, please send a copy and in return we will send back a copy of the issue in which the review is printed. Right now I'm in the process of learning the day-to-day routine which seems to be taking a lot of my time. Can you believe that this column alone has almost taken me two days to write, not to mention type. As you might of guessed, it's going to take me more than a week to get into the swing of things. But the energy's there and I'll stick with it. Until next time... Hello. I'm Paul, welcoming you to the world of Maximum RockVPaul. A world that tries not to take rock'n'roll too seriously. Take it easy, OK? Mi TO PAGING... Just think--no more scrapes or bruises ever again. Fum, MARTIN SPROUSE lw«r / r. w * For my first column I felt obligated to explain a little about myself. First, some information about the past. As some of you might know, I used to do a fanzine by the name of Leading Edge . It was going very well and receiving a lot of great response, but at its height, the work load was overwhelming for one person. At that time, Tim approached me with the proposition of becoming involved with MRR. His idea was to have new blood come into the zine, which was an offer I couldn't pass up. So here I am, living in San Francisco and in the process of starting a \"new life\". I am faced with new responsibilities and challenges. Naturally, my main concern is to put my energy into MRR and communicate my ideas through it! I have already brainstormed for new ideas concerning both content and graphic appearances. I've Sitting at the pool side enjoying the sunshine is rock’s hottest couple~~Madonna and Descendent’s Milo ! To the left is Black Flag’s Henry Rollins , who is ” jealous again.\" Date: 9 Sept; Place: Electric Ballroom, London. The scene of a paltry post-gig \"riot\" after a JESUS AND MARY CHAIN performance. The P.A. gets trashed, windows smashed. The \"rioters\", predom- inantly trendy middle-class whites, retire to their safe European semi-detached homes in the leafy avenues of deepest suburbia, smug in the afterglow of the evening’s rebellious rock'n'roll activities. Meanwhile: Scene 2: Handsworth district of Birmingham. A real riot is taking place. Hundreds of disaffected black youths have to take to the streets, fighting back after continual police harassment in the area. Unemployment among black youths in the area is over 50%, the housing is at best slums, at worst ghettos. Babylon’s burning brightly, as shops are looted (that's what I call window shopping!) and burned. Q: When is a riot not a riot? A: When it's a bunch of JMC fans having a collective teenage tantrum within the cushioned confines of an establishment music venue. In contrast, the blacks of Handsworth were fighting for their rights; a reaction to a society which condones a fascist policing system where black youths are singled out for public oppression— stopped and searched continually. It's not just the youths either. I read a report where a respectable middle-aged woman claimed she was stopped by police on the street at least 3 times a year. She was black. Most white people live a lifetime without ever being stopped. Such is the extent of the harassment. Scene 3: I'm home watching the TV news. Flickering monochrome visions of South African riots assault my brain. Scenes of pandemonium of policemen weilding 6 foot long whips attacking blacks (men and women) for being in the wrong area. It’s total war, black versus white, nothing grey about it The South African pictures seem so far away, and so extreme, that it is hard to comprehend them. The reality, of course, is that such vile racist scum mentality as demonstrated in the evil apartheid regime is alive and well in Britain, supposedly a \"most civilised\" democracy. Here, the racism is covert, as opposed to overt. The police conceal their vile views under a blanket of \"non-discriminatory\" press conferences, community policing, and the like. Taking photos of coppers with little black kids in their arms wearing their helmets will no doubt reassure the mindless Sun-reading public at large, but it's still an extremely rare sight to see a black poli"
