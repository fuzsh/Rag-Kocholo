Conflict intend playing briefly in the USA in August, but we would like to point out that for any so-called anarchist band to play America is a compromise, as we have had to beg Ronnie Raygun and his hired cronies for permission to enter what he classes as Ilia, nation. We are attending one event, titled Nagasaki Nightmare, on August 9 at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, and, as you've guessed, the event is being arranged by Goldenvoice. We have heard many differing stories about Goldenvoice, and must point out that under mi circumstances will we tour for them. The event we are playing is nut a Conflict gig per se, but a festival. We have insisted that the door price will be no more than $6.50 advance and $8 at the door (nb if you are asked for more, refuse to pay and ask for one of us). We have also turned down all offers of hotels, and will be looking for places to stay. The main success, we feel> is that Goldenvoice have agreed to make a donation for the \"No Business As Usual\" fund, and of course we will as well. This agreement is in writing! We are also playing at The Farm in San Francisco and will be trying to play free/cheap gigs in and around Los Angeles. We are not playing New York, as no organizer would accept our door price restrictions. As we have stated previously, we have to experience this firsthand. If we've made a mistake, tough; we'll have learned for next time. Anarchy & Love, Conflict/London 1985 PLACEBO RECORDS PLACEBO VIDEOS! #1 Phoenix Compilation Great footage includes...

Only now he has shown a certain lapse in the mental faculties. Whereas in the past writings he seemed to stand up against the stupidity of the norm, he here submitted to a John Haynism with all its little faults and misgivings so easilly. He is being whimsical and crudely light-hearted with an issue that deserves more, as it involves death. I'm trying to be diplomatic, let me just get down to what 1 feel. Here's the part that shook me up: he says you can go to some fast-food house to get meat without being cruel. Man, man-unkind has stock in many perversions, but to look to sensationalistic teenage gross-outs like nailing goose feet to the floor and crippling an animal-child and then to look past the ten-fold crime that goes down behind Wendys because you're distracted by the muzak and color photos in such an unmentionable slip-1 almost feel guilty bringing this charge up. Yet, you let loose and I’ve gotta counter it. I was in an argument about abortion with a girl a little while ago and she said to me:''How can you claim to be so concerned and humanitarian and still encourage births that will lead to unwanted lives that are destined to broken homes?\": I said:’Tm fighting for human rights. . .\" You can't even discuss human rights when you’ve killed the party in question. That’s the same kind of \"modest proposal\" logic as suggesting one start crusades that scout through lower income neighborhoods and filter out unhappy people or children from broken homes and killing them for their own best interest. Similarly, you must consider that if you try to be an altruist in any valid form, you can't limit your efforts to causes that appeal to you, and neglect others that are too much trouble to fight for. Compassion is only compassion when it's applied universally. To limit your love only to select subjects is selfish and barely loving, and to restrict your warmth and concern to yourself and your friends is in effect the opposite, it’s cold. Getting back to the practical world, Mykel, judging by the way you spout your meat-man bullshit, you must be singing the jingles in your sleep. You sound like the kind of person who would let McDonald’s cater at your wedding because on T.V., Ronald McDonald said it might be a good idea, or the kind of person wno would come back to the counter every other day for two months straight to buy just one more hamburger because you're missing the \"S\" in your McDonald-happy bingo-sweepstakes and are on the brink of winning $25.00 in McDonaldland gift certificates. And to hear you quoting the thrifty protein source in a Big Mac you sound like you limit your nutritional education to what you find written on your placemat at the Golden Arches. You say you're going to Wendys because that is the non-elitist and economical place to receive a cheap protein filled meal. And did you know that Mrs. Wendy personally sits behind a one-way glass mirror above the counter keeping an eye on her guests to make sure they're getting only the best for less? Her only true concern is to teed people like you well and cheaply; money is secondary and she never really thinks about it. She opens up branches all around the world because the more people she can be nice to, the happier she is. You must have been nursed on consumer T.V. and educated in the cereal aisle at the supermarket. As a member of MRR and presumably an aware individual, it's really jarring that you, the militant anti-propagandist, suck up such a slew of McFraud and McFallacy with such facility and completely without qualms or visible resistance. Punk? Protest? Integrity? Righteousness? You'll sit down next to a family of inbred mental mannequins and share a meal of gaily-colored flesh without shame! Have mercy! You don’t feel the drive and urgency I feel to combat the wrongs we do. And to justify this vice by claiming most of us can’t afford to buy fruits and vegetables and are economically obliged to frequent a slaughterhouse for our nutrition is sick. You as the spokesperson for the working class and street rebels trying to declare the necessity for punks and other people of conscience to submit themselves to such sickness is stunting. I may be a flawed mother-fucker, but I never stoop so low, so easily. Do you know how much a 20-pound bag of rice costs? With a bag of carrots, celery, onions, some fruits and peanuts, one can eat well for a month while you and your whiny he-man meatarians will blow the same money in five trips to your fast-food temple, buying Big Slurpy Cool Coke glasses of sugarwater, a quarter pound of 100% real American ground beef from dubious sources and a trayful of other burnt, soaked greasy novelties all presented to you in an array of clean, attractive paper and styrofoam toys the actual utilisation of which lasts about 11/4 minutes before they are thrown away. Very cheap, Mr. Wizard of Finance. I'm not going to quote the nutritional superiority of a vegetarian diet as that would require pages in and of itself. I think and have seen that most thinking individuals, when honest to themselves, admit that logic dictates the natural winner there, and are only hesitant because they fear the first step or fear being associated with wimps and hippies. I woula sooner be surgically grafted to a hippy than be associated with the alternative, the common American. Nonetheless, I must encourage you as well as the reader, to check the books of Frances Moore Lappe for the economic argument and of my most-respected man, Dick Gregory, for the nutritional and spiritual arguments for vegetarianism. I have barely touched upon the most important point against meat-eating, the heedless violence that goes on behind the walls of the slaughterhouse or your local outlet of the same, the meat counter or fast- food joint. I'm convinced that most people know or can assume the bloodsport that precedes their meal and will, if moved to Good, react positively, so I feel no need to indulge in the details of this mass-murder. (May this come to an end soon). All I want to emphasaize to you and dem who read MRR is that you all, of all people, being concerned humans involved in issues of anti-nuclear, anti-racism, anti-war and hatred should appreciate the law that non-violence cannot be exclusive and that when we respect life for life's sake, true non-violence can move this world. When people stop the slaughter in their own lives, we couldn’t have a war if we wanted to, there would be such a sense of peace. Mykel, you said: \"Praying Mantises are nasty and people are nasty. Our teeth grind meat. Our stomach juices digest meat.\" My teeth don't grind meat and my stomach juices don’t digest it. With love, Tomas Beefeater/ c/o Dischord/ 3819 Beecher St., N.W./ Washington, D.C. 20007 Dear Mvkel, I'o like to comment on your vegetarian column in issue #25, but first I'd like to comment on you. I know that must thrill you since you thrive on other people getting upset over the things you write about. Your need to name call, degrade and insult people along with your obsession to criticize their issues and/or actions makes you out to be a sad state of a human being. That, or your just bored with your life and what you ve made of it. Either way, I am surprised that Tim and the gang have you writing for them, the last thing this \"scene\" or movement\" needs is another stab in the back I don t know if you know it or not, but that is exactly what you’re doing or maybe you think this is all a game. By tearing people's ideas down that are generally with good spirit you tear down their movement along with it, whether it be vegetarianism or rock'n'roll. In this case the two are related on a small scale but a scale that is definitely changing. Anyway, on to vegetarianism. You listed three reasons why people are, or become vegetarians. One was that \"It'll help cure world hunger,\" another was that \"eating fruits and vegetables is healthier than eating meat,\" and for the third you went off the subject and told us \"vegetarianism is for rich kids with a lot of time and money on their hands,\" and that \"our teeth grind meat, our stomach juices digest meat humankind hunted before it farmed. . .This kind of nastiness is part of nature.\" I really don't think you're in any position to speak for another person on any topic let alone vegetarianism which you obviously have little knowledge of (or care to for the fear of facing the reality behind the ideology). 1) Your math is correct, sixteen pounds of grain to make one pound of protein beef equals sixteen times as much food if that grain was fed to humans instead of animals. You're also correct in saying that there is enough food now to feed the world’s population, that becoming a vegetarian isn't going to solve our hunger problem. What I don't agree with is that \"distriibution of food\" excuse that Tim brought up in our \"A State of Mind\" interview issue #14. I don’t feel we have a real problem getting food around, our markets are never drastically low on necessary items. The American Public doesn't starve unless it can't pay the cost and I feel it's the exact same thing with foreign countries. I am not so sure Ethiopia would be starving right now if they had closer ties with us instead of the Soviet Union. But with the nation and the world all watching with careful eyes on this week’s hot issue you can bet we're gonna send suplies over there just to save face. So, I feel it isn’t the distribution of the food that is the problem, but those that have the power and control over who gets it and who doesn't. . .our government. But that's a whole other story that we don't have the time or the space for riqht now. 2) It's not a question of how much meat is bad for you because any amount is, here are some examples why: Meat is harder to digest, it takes 3 times the amount of work to digest meat than vegetables. Meat is high in fats which cause heart attacks. Animals with cancer are still used for meat, their tumors are just cut away. 90% of our chickens are inflicted with leukosis (chicken cancer) which are still used and 10% of our livestockk (out of 30 million) have tumors. Arsenic, a known poison, is used in making feed as a growth stimulant for cattle. These are just a few reasons why meat isn't good for you, the list continues. You mentioned protein to be a problem for the vegetarian, this is far from true. The average American exceeds the needed amount of protein by 45% and eats 2 to 4 times as much meat as the body can use, protein cannot be stored. A balanced diet is the key to best health and most of our diets contain more than enough protein anyway, even without meat. If anything, the vegetarian should watch out for their Vit. B-12 intake which is found in eggs and milk but for the vegan who doesn’t eat any animal products, they can get B-12 from yeast. If you truly believe you're getting anything nutritional out of a Whopper you're sadly mistaken. The cattle in factory farms are fed anything from their own excrement to cement dust, and do you know why? How else do you think Burger King can sell those burgers for so cheap? 3) I don’t know where you come off saying vegetarianism is for \"rich kids with a lot of time and money on their hands”; have you taken a poll on this? In fact, it's smarter for the poor or less wealthy to become vegetarians because of the high price of meat sold in markets today. Yes, I guess some vegetarians do shop at healthfood stores where they can afford such high prices, but that ain't much different from the carnivores that dine at expensive restaurants is it? The wealthy, whether carnivorous or vegetariian, have always eaten better than the poor, so I feel money is a pretty lame excuse to use against vegetarianism. And finally, your last defense against us. . ..it's natural. Yes, our teeth grind meat but carnivour teeth rip and tear meat, not grind it. Grinding is for vegetables and grains. Our teeth are more suitable for vegetables and grains. Yes, our stomach juices digest meat, but they'll also digest anything from bits of wood to plastics, and as I’ve stated earlier, it takes three times as long to digest meat which puts an , awful lot of stress on our kidneys, but you’ve heard all that before. As for those cows you've seen \"just hanging out chewing their cud,\" they only have that freedom for the first six months of their lives, then they usually are shipped to feed lots to be brought up to market weight, ususally taking six to eight months before being slaughtered. I don’t consider this to be \"living off the good life\", do you? Those calves you don’t eat in the hopes of not being cruel is a great place to start, but if you look farther into the subject, you’ll find there is no humane way of murder in this industry. It's not only calves, but cows, steers, pigs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and sheep. They all live and die in the most horrifying conditions and all for the same reason. . .profit. \"Flesh and fur is big business big bucks for the bosses who condone carnivores, capital gains from productive lives, these murders we cannot ignore.\" Sorry Mykel, but you're wrong on this one. Robbie/ A STATE OF MIND/ PO Box 421304/ SF, CA 94142 I'm writing this letter in response to Mykel Board’s column on vegetarianism in #25. I was so outraged by his column that I could probably just fill up the next few pages with cut-downs to Mykel, but instead I'll control myself and try and write a rational counter-argument to his totally irrational anti-vegetarianism aarument. Hopefully, some more of you hardcore vegetarians wrote back and kicked his ass with specific facts and figures but unfortunately I don't know a lot of that stuff. I’m just really concerned that other MRR readers don’t believe the shit he wrote. First of all, Mykel said that even if we stop raising farm animals for slaughter in the U.S. we won't alleviate any of the world hunger situation, because lots of wheat is presently rotting in U.S. silos. Well Mykel, the U.S. doesn’t only exploit its own land for the raising of slaughter animals but a lot of other countries' land is used for raising animals like cattle for U.S. consumption, especially countries in South America. The inhabitants of these countries are fucking starving so Americans can have their beef! Also, for environmental reasons, the raising of animals for food causes most of the U.S. water pollution. It's definitely not difficult to get enough protein in a vegetarian diet. For example, peanuts and other nuts, cheese, soybeans,, alone are excellent sources of protein. While mixing rice with a bean like lentils, kidney beans, etc. for a protein equivalent to meat. If you’re a vegetarian who eats eggs and dairly products, getting enough protein is nothing to be concerned about. If you abstain from dairy and egg products, then you have to watch your diet— but it's still not difficult. It's also not difficult to prepare meals- 1 mean how hard is it to make a peanut - butter sandwich? Meat, besides proving protein, provides you with a lot of fat which vegetables don't do. Gee Mykel, I guess you're right-all of us vegetarians are loaded— I mean 1 guess if I didn’t live in this luxurious garage and work a full-time job I wouldn't be able to afford to be a vegetarian. I mean only us rich yuppies can afford it. You’re so fucking ignorant it’s incredible. Actually, for me, being a vegetarian is cheaper than eating meat. Vegetables are a lot cheaper than meat and also it takes less time to prepare most vegetables than to cook an average piece of meat. I rarely buy lunch because it's expensive--! always bring my lunch with me and consequently I only get a 1/2 hr. lunch break. I make my lunch in the morning. Mykel compared human eating meat too lions and tigers eating meat. Well Mykel, I don't see you or any other personnchasing down an animal and killing it without the hellp of a weapon like a lion or tiger does. Nor do I see people using their teeth as utensils to rip meat off a dead animal and eating it in that fashion. The fact is that people are actually not suited for eating meat. Our teeth are made to grind food not rip and tear like a dog's flesh-eating teeth. Also, our intstines aren't made to digest meat but are suited to the digestion of grains, fruits, etc. Mykel said it's possible to be nasty without being cruel-that's just a lot of bullshit to try to justify his condition. So Mykel recognizes the cruellty down to real calfs and geese-well Mykel, don’t be so naive as to think the cruelty stops there. Cattle that ends up as hamburger go through extreme cruelty throughout their lives also. Many of them die even before they make it to the slaughterhouse because of cramped conditions. Anyway, I'd like to end this saying that eating the flesh of animals is something of the past. We don’t have to eat meat anymore for survival. Humans don’t need it. It’s only a bloody tradition left over from primitive times. Vegetarianism is the way of the future. Mykel, I hope you wake up and finally see what your hamburger is really made up ot-the bloody carcass of an innocent animal. Hespect animals, don’t eat them! Ruta/ 1255 N. Beachwood Dr./ Hollywood, CA 90038 Dear MRR: I hate to play right into Mykel Board's hands, but I have to respond to his vegetariian criticism in issue #25. I will adress his criticisms in the same three parts he used. First, concerning world hunger, I have to admit you have us vegetarians beat there. I guess no matter how much food vegetarianism would save it would do no good in the government's greedy hands. However, vegetarianism at least nas the potential to help the situation, whereas meat production can only hurt it. When you deny that a meatless diet is a healthier diet, you are doing the misinforming. The U.S.' protein obsession is unbelievable. In addition to getting all your extra un-needed protein in meat, you also get all those good chemicals (everything from growth steroids to artifical colors), as well as plenty of cholesterol. All good American's know we need as much of these goodies as we can get so we can all die of heart disease and cancer like our ancestors. As for price, a pound of tofu costs about $1 .30, a pound of soybeans 85 cents, and a tofu lasagne TV dinner can be purchased on sale for $1 .99. Many other vegetarian foods can be bought at the same A & P you would buy meat at (fruits and other produce, soups, etc.). As for eating out, most Chinese restaurants serve up a pint of vegetable chop suey, etc., for about $2.50. Also, Mykel, if you are so poor, how can you afford so much fast food? See how much $2.50 buys at Wendys or in the meat department of A & P for that matter. Now for the \"humane\" issue. Sure, killing in nature is cruel, but there are differences between nature's way and man’s way. When a lion runs down an antelope, that antelope hasn’t been confined in a pen, barely as large as its own body for its entire life, when a fox catches a pheasant in a field, that pheasant hasn’t lived with four other pheasants in a battery cage the size of a folded nespaper for its whole life. Secondly, animals have no conscience, and many are natural carnivores. Unfortunately, a wolf can't prepare himself a tofu burger to avoid the \"nastiness\" he is unaware of anyway. Man can, and should, since he is not a natural meat eater. There are many proofs ofmthis (colon size, digestive fluid content, etc.L but an obvious one is to simply notice which animal we most resemble, a flesh-eating tiger, or a fruit-eating ape. As for hunting coming before farming, primitive man also worshipped the sun and moon, offered human sacrifices, etc. Does progress make any sense to anyone? Finally, I applaud your refusal to eat veal, lobster, and goose liver, however, this is kind of like a non-smoker refusing to smoke; it's pretty easy isn't it. Accepting others meats as a necessary evil is sad, since factory farming is so cruel and is only getting worse. You are no worse, though, than the anti-vivisectionists who still eat meat. It's easy to carry a sign, or write a letter every once in awhile, but when self-sacrifice is called for, forget it. I'm sure this letter won't convert you, Mykel, but don't condemn those who are trying. Anyone who is interested further, please write me. Since I have a decent job, I buy copies of Animal Liberation, Peter Singer's revolutionary book, and give them to interested people. Thanks, Steve Moyer (FOLLOW FASHION MONKEYS)/ 914 Glenwood St./ Emmaus, PA 18049. Hi, Just a quick word to say I really liked Mykel Board’s meat article. It’s good to know That I'm not the only zine writer to extol the virtues of eating meat. If you try and get every meat eater you know to pick up their pen and write about it, then we'll see the end of the trendy vegetarian fashion once and for all. Charlie/ Chainsaw zine/ Box 787/ 32 Ivor PI/ London NW1/ England Hey MRR, Why do you continue to let that asshole Mykel Board write for your mag? His piece on vegetarianism was full of nothing but fuckin' lies. Why don't you get someone to write the truth about vegies, other than that buttsniff Mykel. C'mon Max, get rid of Mykel. His opinions are the only thing wrong with your mag. Bored with Mykel, Jimi York/ 4903 W 121 St/ Hawthorne CA 90250 P.S. Mykel, you're invited to live in a slaughterhouse (your choice) for 3 months, in that time period your living space will be 3' by 3', you will be hit and spat upon by the heartless, murdering fucks that work there, you will be fed your own shit (you're probably used to that) mixed with grains and other assorted maggot-infested scaps lying around. Then, after 3 months of hell living in total darkness, your throat will be slit and you will choke on your own blood (Don’t worry, it will only take 1 or 2 agonizing minutes of pain before you die) so some capitalist fuck can shove you down his or her throat and then shit you out 5 or 6 hours later. Think about it. Dear MRR: Looks like my subscription has run out again. I don't know why I keep re-subscribing to a magazine with big-mouth Mykel Board, communist (everyone says so) editor Tim Yohannan, and weirdo artist headbanger Pushead (PUShead? yuck!). Despite these sickos I went ahead and bought all the back issues that were still available, and in the first one I pulled out of the envelope I was shocked to hear Mykel say that kiddee porn was not harmful to , children , and somewhere else the subject of religion (shudder) came up! All this was just really too much! I'm surprised MRR wasn’t banned long ago. Why our postal employees, whose salaries our taxes pay, even deliver such propaganda is beyond me! Well, I'm certainly not going to fail to renew my subscription, because where else am I going to hear honest, uncensored opinions (and rebutal) on a wide range of topics, as well as finding out about the latest music? Nowhere else, certainly not in Rolling Stone! And now for something completely different. In my last letter I mentioned that my local Macintosh users group has a lot of public domain software in its library. I'd like to extend my offer of Mac software and documents to anyone out there. If you have a Mac and are interested in the 46 discs full of stuff that we currently have, or you have a problem that no one around can figure out, just drop me a line. Our user's group would also be interested in any artwork or programs that you've come up with. There's a place for computers in \"punk,\" too, eh Tim? (hmmm--c o m m i e , computer-hmmm). Terry Bowman/ P.O. Box 218/ Broadway, VA 22815 Dear MRR: I thought Mykel Board’s article on vegetarianism was great: who needs wealthy anal compulsive kids telling us we're immoral if we eat a hamburger? The most sound basis for vegetarianism is simply that you don't like the idea of eating animals. Even so, anyone who has read The Secret Life of Plants knows that they, too, have a rudimentary consciousness. I went to a boarding school last year and it annoyed my to no end to see the vegetarian kids snottily bitching (right in front of the hard working cook) that the veggie meal was inedible. They would take a plate of food, sniff at it, and throw most of it away. The waste at the school was incredible. I think waste, not vegetarianism, is the main issue of our eating habits. I care about my body, but some people are too picky and ungrateful for the food they have. I know all the stuff rotting in our country’s storehouses and garbage pails can’t be quickly flown over to the starving millions, but a change in attitude might make our government less likely to let good food rot to help the rotting economy. Siobhan Glynn/ 278 Sterling Place/ Brooklyn, NY 11238 1 Dear MRR: This letter is in response to the one sent in from Bobby Snotz in the May/June '85 issue. Bobby, I hope you are reading this. Just because some unknown person slagged off NYC skins in a recent MRR issue, there is absolutely no reason for you to slag off the persons living in Lee's old apartment, in the squat which used to be at 713 E. 9th St., just because you need objects to vent your misdirected anger towards. There is no validity or even trace of fact in any of your far-fetched accusations to the people you refer to as \"peace punks,\" and there is no need for name-calling. As far as the \"peace punks\" spreading rumors of a 4th Reich in the C-SSquat, you probably did that yourself. C-SSquat? You should get your facts confirmed before you go around writing immature, accusatory letters. As far as your stand on \"nationalist socialism,\" or whatever you want to call it, and your opinion of our economy heading for a fall because of immigrants getting priority on small business loans, etc., my opinion is that’s all a load of shit. First of all, why should you care who's getting business loans, are you opening one? Our economy is heading for a fall, as any intelligent person knows, because the government serves itself and the rich only, and not the mass of ordinary people. This country is now in such a state that it doesn’t matter how many immigrants we have here. What’s the sense in inventing the concept of \"nations\" anyway, except of course to give governments the opportunity to oppress working people within a clearly defined border and thus make patrolling and guarding eaasier and of great importance, thereby channeling people's anger away from the government ana into \"defending the nation against outsiders,\" most of whom are imaginary anyway. Many immigrants were originally brought here as a source of cheap labor, and it is not the fault of the immigrants. Also, you are as much a victim of the treacherous American government as I am, and others are. and immigrants are. Why don't you Mykel Board you're half right! Mainly because you stopped short in your thrashing of veggies. I'll take on your points in vaguely the same order. 1 Feeding the world. Fucking-A correct about there being TOO MUCH food, but have you wondered why? Better living through chemis- try is a major reason. For how long will land that has been inundated with chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and who knows (Not the farmers) what else continue to produce said food? Even something as seemingly innocuous as irrigation has produced disastrous results here in Oz. Overirrigation has resulted in increased salinization of the soil. The dirt's too salty to grow anything! And the bit about some land being fit for grazing alone is valid, this year. But if all that land (and it takes a helluva lot of land to graze) is used for grazing, where's the population explosion going to live? If you haven't noticed, by the year 2000 Mexico will have more people than the ' even if immigration (legal and otherwise) increase propor- tionally. That leaves harvesting the Oceans, and the zinger from left field is: If dolphins are intelligent, what about their sentient rights? The seeming contradiction between bitching about space used for grazing and over-production of the land is resolved by one of two methods. The first, and certain- ly the most widely used today, is let the poor shits starve. The second is a system of high-intensive, yet non-chemical farming that maintains, and in some cases improves the soil. 2 Meat being unhealthful. Right again, too much of anything is pretty bad. Now, taking meat as meat, you know what it does in . your intestines? (Stop breathing so hard) In the two to three days it takes to digest (compared to six to twelve hours for vegetable matter) it turns into some ghastly (Long string of Tesco adverbs and Pushead adjectives) mass that then moves into your colon (watch that breathing) to become familiar shit. Too paraphrase Hemingway \"A man likes the smell of his own shit.\" Do you? Hunted before we farmed? Right. But we GATHERED before we hunted. A recent Gallup poll showed that some 70-80% of the people that eat at Kentucky Fried McDonald Kings believe in creationism and vote conservatively. Showing your true colors, huh? And speaking of evolution, the only other primates that eat meat are baboons and a few species of carnivorous (and cannibalistic at that) chimpanzees. Our closest relatives, orangutans and great apes, do not consume flesh. Our teeth grind, grinding is for grains, our incisors are for fruit and vegetables. Carnivores have sharp fangs for rending and shred ding. Our juices don't digest meat as well as they do vegeta- bles. Carnivores- have short intestines. You can stretch a cheetah's guts without extending your arms too far. Herbivores have long intestines (now stop drooling on this magazine!), you can walk around the block with a human intestine. Now the good stuff, what's in the meat, besides flesh. Call up the local office of the World Health Organization and ask about the statistics on Precocious Puberty in Puerto Rico. Something like 5% of the kids there hit puberty BEFORE they're 8 years old. There are three and four year old girls running around having monthly periods. The cause: hormones in the meat. And in the good ole USSA the hormone DES is regularly used in cattle, but its original use as a drug to decrease the chance of miscarriage was banned after a few deformities and a lot of women whose uoeu it organs . 3 Protein. All wrong, but just because your data are old. New research has shown that you can eat your soybeans in the morning and your petunia sprouts at night and still get better protein than a Big Whopper. The intestines (you're drooling again) have protein pools that store the amino acids (the various building blocks of protein) until the 8, 9, 12 or whatever whoever you've been reading lately say are the essential acids in the right proportion are formed. Also, too much protein is almost as bad as too little, and worse in the long-run. All of the traditionally long-lived peoples have three things in common, high altitude, fermented foods, and low protein intake. 4 Morals. The argument here is purely emotionally. I'll admit, however, that it is possible to humanely kill an animal, just like humanely killing a human. No matter what anyone says, this T a ? i n ? iv i d ual's choice of his or her own morals. HOWLER, I think the most humane way of killing any animal for FOOD is to hunt it. Wouldn't you like to have a chance to escape being Sunday dinner? 5 Economics. \"Health Food\" stores are 99 times in 100 certified rip-offs, but a pound of brown rice is much cheaper than one Ronald Burger and will feed you several times. And if you stumble across a Farmers Market (and not the L . A . tourist trap) or a co-op you'll find things cheaper than the A & p, and probably a better quality. Just a buck for lunch? Geez, ever hear of making your lunch the night before? Why not have a little personal control over your life instead of sucking up Wendy Hut ads and letting THEM induce strange chemicals into your body. However, if you don't have time, there are some fast-food places that are breaking in to the greenie demographic market-place. One's in Santa Cruz (where else) and one chain in the south-east up through to Illinois. Obviously, Mykel, you need to be deprogrammed. The United Veaetan- an Front has a re-education camp outside of Santa Cruz where you can partake of such enlightening activities like watching hours and hours of fast \"food\" commercials while your personal Walkman plays the _delicious sounds of DIAMANDA GALAS alternating with WAYNE NEWTON. Jerod Poore/ 63 Jellicoe St/ Boring Pk, Vic 3174/ Australia wake up and do something about being a victim of obscene rulers, instead of wasting your energy imagining that everything that goes wrong for NY skins in the lower east side is the fault of \"peace punks\" and \"commies\"? Why can't you focus your anger on the dirty rotten system which oppresses us all, rather than on other ordinary people? Furthermore, once people like you refuse to identify yourselves and others by race, sex, nationality, length of hair, etc., and once people stop thinking of themselves as American (or belonging to any country), then we will be on the road to freedom, both from self oppression, nationalism, and communism. Peace, love and anarchy, A jealous cretin, lice-ridden stinking pestilence, shit crasshole from NY. (Thanks to the apostles: the giving of love costs nothing). Dear MRR, Mr. Snotz’s complaints about Tim's intervention in the \"NY Skins vs The World\" soap opera was quite humorous. His pseudo-intellectual analysis and rationale of the NY skin phenomenon was as transparent as it was sophomoric.Tim adequately disposed of every point Mr. snotz brought up. However, the line in section 3, \"Why don't you try living on Avenue C (sans daddy's allowance)\" shows an absurd type of snobberey that epitomizes the whole charade of American skindom. First, Mr. Snotz 's belittling of punks from the suburbs is crazy. The whole U.S. punk/HC resurgence was started and is fueled by suburban middle/upper-middle class kids as a reaction to the values that existence represents. The strength of punk is in the suburb (and the outlying boroughs), not in lower Manhattan. Second, the Lower East Side (Ave. C) is a trendy, fun, and exciting place to be. It's one of the most desirable places to live in NYC, hence the Yuppie invasion. I'm sure it's rather rough without money, but no one is forcing the skins to live there. I'm sure they could find a big house Upstate with low rent in which to live. But then they couldn't fantasize about what real punks they are, sticking it out in the big bad city. Third, if the skins believe in nationalism, why don't they go for the American Dream? Why don't they use the same energy they use creating squats to creat real economic oportunities for themselves? If you don't hate capitalism, then there is no excuse for not being able to make a decent living. The truth of the matter is that U.S. or NY skins are at best lazy and stupid, and at worst hypocrites. If they truly embrace Rightist ideals, then there can be no reason for them having to rough it on Ave. C. There can be no justification of Brit-style Right-wing skins in the U.S. As tne circumstances here are quite different than in England, punk here is different. Ronald Reagan is the ultimate skin, and I suggest that skins join the GOP and buy a decent condo in their beloved Lower East Side. Until then, let’s ignore this handful of would-be Yuppies and get on with the liberal ideals that is American HC/punk. Thomas Paine Jr./New Jersey suburbs Dear MRR, I've noticed something lately that is irritating me. People both within and those who've already abandoned the punk \"movement\" have been very down on suburban punks. (To warn everyone in advance: I'm a suburban punk (gaspl). Yes, that’s right. I live in a suburb of Chicago. I'm not particularly proud of where I live, and I don't brag about it, but it's the truth. Anyone stricken with nausea can stop reading now.) Working Class and city punks don't seem to be too pleased with suburban punks for the reason that we can't comnpletely grasp the exact feeling of living near or in poverty. They seem to be very disappointed that everyone can't be as miserable as them. If poverty is what we're striving for, the ideal punk would be Ethiopian or Cambodian.. .or dead! And of what use is a dead punk? I'm in no way justifying the way my parents have chosen to live. I feel anger towards them as well as towards other blind suburbanites and the indulgent rich. Being underage, I’ll have to wait to change my situation, as do many suburban kids. As for non-suburbans less fortunate than I, there's not much I can do for their situation at this point either. Right now, I just wish people would look at us suburban punks in a different light. The majority of us have good ideas and active minds. We see the faults of our government and society and we have just as valid of statements to make about the world as any other kind of punk. Sure, we may be a bit naive in our idealism, but from our position, most of us are doing the best we can. Claw Marx/ 49 N Cumnor Rd/ Westmont IL 60559 Dear Claw, I think most so-called \"city\" punks are suburban kids out trying to prove (to themselves and others) that they never came from the sauburbs, hencew their \"punker-than-thou\" attitude. Most punks, at least here in the US, are from the suburbs. And they shouldn't feel too insecure about that, as it is the Middle Class who will really determine whether the US goes fascist or progressive in the future. Being middle class, you're in a better position to effect the future, so accept it, and then use your advantage of education to really make a change.

Obradovic/ Strahinica 43/ 11000 Beograd/ Yugoslavia In response to Michelle’s letter (#24) which warned girls not to get drunk because if they do they are asking to be raped. Michelle stated that if these girls ’’had not been so drunk \" they wouldn’t have been raped and that ” they are just as guilty as the guys \" Dear MRR readers, Michelle, and males, Wait one fucking minute, Michelle. Either you don’t know anything about rape or you're the biggest female impersonator since Nancy Reagan and Phyllis Schlafly. Rape is a serious subject, so if you were trying to be cute you have no reason to be. I hope that you simply know very little about rape and were trying to be helpful, which I'm sure you were in reality. Let me tell you, Michelle and others, what happens to a woman physically (it would take 10 pages to do emotionally) when she is raped. The penis is a lot tougher than most people, especially females, would imagine; and the vagina is a lot more delicate than most people imagine, especially males. When a woman is raped, an act of violence, she is bone dry because she is scared shitless. Guys, try to imagine getting an erection while someone is pointing a gun at your head. She is dry, and because she is tense, her vaginal muscles are also tense, so when the guy rapes her, she will TEAR, RIP, SHRED, etc. When one of my friends was raped, she had to have 10 stitches inside her vagina. Being raped is like getting the shit kicked out of you from the inside out. Would anyone really blame someone for getting beat up while he/she was drunk? We have a right to expect males of this world to behave with more grace and dignity than a dog in heat. Rape is not a crime of passion; it is one of violence that is as premeditated and as messy an affair as a stabbing. To assume that the victim of a raping is in any way at fault is as logical as blaming a person for getting mugged. Someone once said: \"The only difference between being raped and being hit by a truck is that when you are raped, people ask if you enjoyed it.\" Males are humans, ancf because they are, they have certain qualities that seperate them from the rest of the animals of this planet; they are capable of compassion, empathy, love, and thought. If we assume that a drunk woman is free game, we assume that it is OK for men to rape drunk women. It is not OK, not with me at least. If we look at rape like the violent, bloody crime that it is, there are no excuses for it.. .NONE. Because men can think, we should expect them to utilize their grey matter and their hearts. They aren't all \"slaves to their dicks\", and besides, their dicks have very little to do with what goes on in the mind of a rapist. He wants to CONTROL a woman, body and soul, and rape is an extremely effective method of \"keeping women in their place.\" I don't think you gave men enough credit in your letter. Men aren't all out for pussy, wherever and however they can get it. Most men want to love and be loved by someone, and we all know sex can at times have very little to do with love. Most men get frightened and hurt and dream just like girls do. And I know a lot of men who don't rape because there is someone standing in front of them who is vulnerable. To assume that a guy will rape a girl because she is drunk is like assuming a guy will rape a girl who is on crutches. In fact, rape has very little to do with the girl involved; the rapist just plain wants women to keep their place and be afraid to go out without a man to protect her. It takes a \"special” kind of man to commit rape-it takes the same kind of man who stabs people, or shoots them, or beats the shit out of passed-out winos. In short, it takes a real creepy, sick person. I think I've made my point-most guys are nice people, no girl \"asks\" for rape, and rape is a method of control. Oh yeah, a good book about how society controls women is Gvn/eccoloqv by Mary Daley. Michelle, no hard feelings. Your letter just made me a little pissed. I’m sure you were only trying to help. All responses welcome. Sybil/ 881 W Crescent/ Redlans CA 92373 Attention Donny the Self-proclaimed punk! In response to your male-opinionated scene report on the U.S. Chaos show (MRR #26): What makes you the leading \"authority\" on Anarchist actions? James Kontra’s action was well called for. Even if Skully's words were spewed out his ass in jest, we would have done the same (or more: castration with a blow torch). Anyway, Death to serious scene reports. The Women Warriors/ 1838 Golden Gate Ave./ S.F., CA 94117 P.S. Virus wails! MRR: This is in response to the postscript of the letter signed \"Mars\" in #26. Wnat BLACK FLAG are condoning by putting out a Charlie Manson album is: good music (I am assuming here). The fact that Manson is a supposed mass-murderer is beside the point if he plays good music. Music should exist simply as an art-form in itself. It does not have to be laden with politics or social consciousness to be good. Two good examples of this are the STOOGES and BLACK FLAG themselves, two of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands ever. Mick Begnal of OBLIVION/ Philadelphia, PA Dear MRR, Lately I've been hearing more and more so-called patriots complaining about \"commies\" and peace punks hurting their feelings about their country. Patriots are proud of their country, its people and its history, and if you criticize it you're considered a \"commie\". I know this way of thinking was very popular during the McCarthy period, but I find it very sad to hear this from people who call themselves \"punk\". U.S. history begins with the \"brave” pioneers killing millions of native American Indians, and nowadays American corporations, backed up by the U.S. military and C.I.A., are spreading out all over the world exploiting cheap labor. This process is called imperialism, which is just a modern type of colonialism. Since WWII, the U.S. has been involved in 64 military actions (coups, wars, etc.) outside of its own territory (whereas Russia only has had 8, and those all were in border countries. So who's the \"aggressor?”). In South and Central America alone, the UI.S. has been directly Dear MRR , I am a punk -from Phi My. Mykel Board is always getting shit from people c omp 1 a i n i ng aoou t this and that. I e n j oy reading peoples complaints about how he's a pedtphile or how he's sexist or -whc q.ues a shit- the only thing I can say is that I m getting tired of seeing that same old \"You re wrong:\" picture that appears every single time at the beginning c*-f his column, which I do enjoy reading (have I buttered him up enough?). I enjoyed reading Mykel Board s tear-up all that \"be a vegetarian -for it is only natural\" garbage, column in #25. I don't have anything against eating vegetables, but banning mieat because it is in humiane is stupid. Sure it s kind o-f cruel to kill animals and eat them, but come on, the Killing o-f prey tor the use o-f consumption has been a natural process which not just man, but all carnivorous animals have used to survive -for millions o-f years. Is a Tiosquito a lousy -flesh eating p i g? 1 1 it unholy -for a bird to eat a Aiorm' Well, as i said, I have nothing against vegetarians. But 1 don t need to be bothered with the near-sighted arguments that \"true\" vegetarians present. I don't need to rehash what Mykel said, read h.s column in #l 5 yourself. Why don't you vegetarians read it also. It srr t attacking you, out its defending the normal meat-eater. It would be enlightening, and maybe you can find a hole in his argument and rip it apart. I won't mention anything about Mykel anymore. What bothered me was the article presented by Gene Hoglan of DARK ANGEL. I hate it when punk is looked at as just a bunch of non -intellects spouting bullshit to fast music. That's what Gene seems to think in his letter. The lyrics mean nothing to him. He'd rather sing about EVIL, over and over again, it's boring. Almost as borino as the five million 01 songs that could only be crafted through careful gnor ance . Gene said that all punks think \"Reagan sucks\" yes 1 ) , “ kill all comm i es\" (no way 1 ) , How the fuck does he think we all hate commies Even if some of us did hate commies its fucking idiotic to say \"kill all commies\". He also says, \" By the way, I m anti -god also.\" What the fuck does that mean' 5 Don't include me in your stupid stereotypes. Stereotyping helps to support discrimination aoainst race and religion, group, etc. Don't let yourself be fooled by stereotypes, find out for yourself what people are really like. It sounds to me from your rantings that you don't communicate too well. You don really give a shit about what punk stands for. I understand DARK ANGEL is a speedcore outfit. Well fuck, I hope all the other speedcore group's mentalities aren't like yours because you don't really support punk as an ideal, you support the music (not even the lyrics'). I know if DARK ANGEL ever comes to Phi 7 1 y Id like to have d . scuss i on with you about how the hell you're supporting punk b diluting it with your drug-mi nded metal ness (is that about metal, or common knowledge?). I love how Gene describes us all as living in a malicious hell. I don t live in a malicious hell, I'll make a bet you don't and probably most of the punks in the US will agree that the- don't live in malicious hell. The Nicaraguan peasants live in hell. Thailand refugees live in hell, but puni-s don't. Enough of thus spouting. I must' say the DEAD MILKMEN will have a record out so soon that it makes my ears quiver with anticipation, T here are a lot of really good Ph i 1 1 y bands nowadays.

Sene responses involved in coups in Paraguay (1947), Puerto Rico (1950), Guatemala (1954), [Honduras (1954), Cuba (1961), Columbia (1962), Dominican Republic (1962 and 1965), Brazil (1964), Bolivia (1967), Chile (1973), Argentina (1976), and Grenada (1983). These figures are from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. And you ain't seen nothin' yet(RR). I don’t see anything to be proud of. I happen to be born in Holland, a country with a lot of colonies and a lot of colonial wars. I am not proud of it, so I'm not a patriot. I think that where you were born is not important. I could as well have been born in Russia, the U.S.A., Iran, or Germany. Should I be proud then too? I'm a punk and I think that people should be critical towards society, their government, and, in general, everyone who tries to rule them and tell them how to organize their lives. I see punk as an international movement consisting of hundreds, maybe thousands, of small scenes, who by cooperating with, corresponding with, and learning from each other can do their bit to make this world into a better place. (Like MDC says: Think globally; act locally\"). Patriotism is totally narrow-minded and completely in contradiction to anything punk stands for. I don't believe in borders. They're just there to keep us seperated. I don't feel like a patriot; I'm just a citizen of the world. Do I really want to hurt you? Wouter/ BGK/ P.O. Box 70397/ 1007 KJ Amsterdam/ Holland Dear Glen Friedman, In MRR #25, you gave some misinformation about copyrights (I am a third year student at the Dickinson School of Law, where I have benefitted from a 15 week course on the subject). That one can obtain a copyright by mailing a copy of the work to oneself is a popular, but useless myth. In reality, a copyright is created when the work is created. If the work is \"published\" (i.e., offered for distribution, transfer, or sale) without meeting the statutory notice requirements (the correct combinations of circled P's and C's, names and dates), the copyright may be forfeited. Then, anybody may freely copy the work. The registration and deposit of copies with the Copyright Office is not necessary for protection. However, if made within a statutory time period, it allows for the elections of a special remedy upon infringement of the copyright. It is cheap, so look into it if you are going to \"publish\" the work. For a good explanation of what type of notice must be placed on each copy of a work, order a registration form from the Copyright Office by calling (202)287-9100 at any time, day or night. With the application that is mailed to you (usually takes a week) will come a booklet that explains almost everything you need to know. Recording artists should request Form SR. To be sure you get the booklet, request Circular R1 , Copyright Basics, as well. For quick answers to any copyright questions, like what to do before covering another artist’s song, what form to request for a painting, or why courts consider a work mailed to yourself to be useless evidence, just call (202)287-8700 weekdays between 8:30 AM and 5 PM. Government experts will answer your questions for free! To avoid being placed on hold and racking up a huge phone bill, call after 4 PM when the lines are less busy. Because records or tapes could easily cross international boundaries, you may want to enquire about types of international protection under copyright treaties. Often, only a few words need to be added to your copyright notice to obtain protection in a certain country. Also, fanzine publishers may enquire about copyright protection if there is something that they do not want to be copied freely. An excellent article on the copyright of sound recordings appears in the May 1985 issue of Musician magazine. It offers a good explanation of what courts look at when deciding if a copyright infringement actually exists. Rather than go into detail about copyright law here, I suggest that people call the Copyright Office with their questions. Our taxes pay for their services, and the information will come directly from the horse's mouth. Frank Chmielewski/ 1045 Sunset Ln/ Bensalem PA 19020 Dear A.C. in California, I agree 110% with your letter. I have the same story. Please write me. N.C./ 1008 Lake Placid dr SE/ Calgary, Alta/ Canada T2J 5B4 Dear MRR, This is the scene report for Mandeville, Louisiana. Clubs: only one, and that’s Ruby’s Roadhouse, (504) 626-3001. Bands: just LAT DIOR (that's me singing and playing all the instruments). The name is taken from an African Senegalese general who fought the French colonialists in the 1860’s until his death. He was a rebel against the system in Senegal, where I used to live. Fanzines: only one I know of, and that's mine (Alameda Alternative , cuz I used to live in Alameda, California). It comes out on an irregular basis. I guess I'm going to have to end this scene report. If there are any bands I forgot to mention or anybody with more info, write me. Andy Shelton/ 100 Pecaniere PI/ Mandeville LA 70448 P S. I'm working on a speedcore/thrash worldwide tape comp and need a few more bands to add. Send demos. Dear MRR, Hey Tim, sorry I didn't stop to say hello at the RED KROSS show, but I was really in a bad mood. Would you believe some kind punk rocker skated all the way across town the next day to return my lost wallet? He saw it fly out of my pocket and held on to it but couldn't find me after the show. It even had money in it. Maybe there's hope for the world yet; there's still some good guys out there. Mitzi Maltz/ Incoherent House zin el 539 Scott/ SF, CA 94117 Dear MRR, This is in regards to Schiavo Roberto from Poison Distribution in Italy. The guy’s a real dick. He's probably in hiding by now because he has ripped so many people off. He still owes us for 20 LOST GENERATION LPs. Lately, I've heard from a lot of other people who have gotten the shaft from him (for big bucks). If you hear of this guy, don't do business with him. Diane Inca / Incas Records/ 272 Benham Ave/ Bridgeport CT 06604 Dear Diane, I have heard other complaints about him too. It’s too bad he has \" disappeared \" while owing so many people. The real tragedy is that he in turn had complained a year ago of being owed and ripped off by some American labels. I guess he decided to do one bad turn for another. If anyone in Italy knows what happened to Roberto, please let us know Thanks, Tim Dear Anybody, Life in Wisconsin is OK, but life in Medford Wisconsin is getting rather drab. If any (and I do mean any) band would like to consider coming up to the great northland to play, I would give you free lodging. How is that for an offer? I would also get you at least two bands to play with. It would be a very casual event! Turn out and slamming would be pretty good. If you'd like to come up, contact me by calling (715)748-3013 or writing me. The free lodging might just include at least half of your meals Your friend, Joe Streeck i 314 Harrison/ Medford Wl 54451 This is a desperate plea from a small group of people trying to maintain capabilities for creative expression in an environment which strongly discourages that. We have put together a small publication which appears at irregular intervals and features a gallery of scrawlings by those of alternate thought patterns. We have called this publication Life in a Real World , although it originates from a very unreal world, ruled by Southern Baptists, fat lawyers, and pick up trucks. Life in the Real World now lies at its deathbed after only two issues. It is in a pitiful stage, too idiotic for some, and too bizarre for others. It can, however, be saved. It needs your help. Life wished to serve as a forum for any artists or writers who don't quite fit in with anything else. Most, if not all, contributions will be accepted for the printing of issue #3. It’s up to you, the public (hahaha) to save this \"nice idea\" from extinction. Life is not a fanzine. Please send no scene reports. Instead, we wish to create a showcase of poetry, fiction, drawings, etc. of an obsucre, non-commercial, creative, mystifying, thought-provoking or generally insane nature’ Send your stuff to the address below. Consider it free exposure for your work. If you want a sample issue of Life to get a rough idea of what you're working for, send 50c. At this time, it looks as if all future issues will be free to all contributors, and free to anyone after they purchase their first copy for 50c. We also run Primordial Sid's Sounds, from Over There, a budding \"label” for sounds of a similar persuasion. Write for info. Send all inquireis, artwork, etc. to: Life in a Real World/ Box 1321/ Hattiesburq, MS Dear MRR: The following letter is on animal research. Millions of innocent animals are slaughtered each and every year in the murder houses we call laboratories. Animal research is a contradiction in terms. Why? Simply because the very aim of animal research is to cause distress and pain by recreating disease and trauma. The goal is never to prevent or cure since the animals are always healthy before the experiments. The following paragraphs are examples. (1) A cat is immobilized in a stereotaxic device. The cat was then blinded by enucleation of both orbits (removal of the eyeballs), his head clamped in a head holder, his penis nerves surgically exposed, and then subjected to a series of barbaric tests which included electric shocks until termination (i.e., the animal’s death). (2) A puppy in American University was made to fast for a period of 51 days in which he got to watch the feeding of other animals. The sign on his cage read \"Do not Feed. Give water\". (3) A Soviet pioneer of transplants implanted the head of one dog onto a German Shepard. The two heads of the pain-crazed monster kept attacking each other, and on the 29th day, the misfit had to be killed. (4) Cats are thrown from high places to determine if the animals always land on their feet. (5) To find out how a mouse will groom himself if he misses his front paws, his front paws are amputated. The mouse is then watched and studied. (6) In one discovery, the pleased scientists (paid murderers would be a better term), they found out that it takes less electricity, applied directly to the heart, to kill a dog put under psychological stress by suspending him in a sling than to kill one resting peacefully in his cage. (7) Aggressive studies involving cats via brain manipulation. Electrodes inserted in skulls and stimulated. Rats were placed in cages with cats. Stimulation causes cats to attack rats. As you can see from reading this is that animal research is very cruel ana should be stopped at once. Animal’s systems are completely different from man's so there is no benefit in animal experiments. The only way humans would benefit from research is if it were done on humans. Let me state that Baby Fae was an experiment. Yes, like it or not, she was. And to think that some poor creature had to give its life so she could live for a small period of time. The baboon could have lived for years, but as we all know, that didn't happen. If we were to start to do more experifments on humans the humans would not suffer because they would be given anesthesia unlike animals who are given no anesthesia because the scientists don't give a fuck about the animals at all. I have a list of people who would be perfect to start with. All vivisectionists, all people who fuck up the punk scene, murderers, rapists, child molesters, and Twattie of the EXPLOITIBLE BUTTFUCKS. And of course, we should put Mykel Board in the front for his stupid opinions on vegetarianism. Tom Tirrell/ 734 Ave. B/ Redondo Beach, CA 90277 American version. But that’s not all. You would deploy \"space mines\" to destroy their star wars before it could be used. Mines are much cheaper than any \"strategic defense initiative.\" We all know what the next move would be for the U.S.-more missiles, and of course space mines of our own. The sky is left littered with two useless star wars systems and countless space weapons that would be used to destroy peaceful satellites as well. No more cable T.V., Kiddies! 3) Star wars spends more than we can afford on something we don’t need. They say star wars could easily cost a trillion dollars, or more! Think about it. . .a trillion dollars! That's $1,000,000,000,000! Think what a cool trillion could buy at the record store. That's two hundred billion admissions to see your favorite band. Forget the guest list, I've got a few extra bucks today! But wait a minute. Think of what a trillion dollars would buy in medical care for the sick, food for the hungry, and housing for the homeless. Think of tne thousands of scientists again sometime. There were definitely some happenings in Detroit, massive spray painting if nothing else, and other cities around tne country did their share as well. Personally, the only thing I really did was to call every talk show in Detroit and Ann Arbor and explain what was going on and why. Some of the response was pretty good, too. I called one station so many times that the host knew who I was right away--he said he loved the idea. This guy is 68 years old too! I guess people from all age groups are becoming fed up! Finally, my band DEEP SIX is brand new. We should be playing out soon. Also, why don't you fucking punk poseurs from A.A. go to shows in Detroit, you know who you are! One more thing, violence at the Hungry Brain has been non-existent to the best of my knowledge. Hungry Brain closed, but hopefully not for long-tney're doing shows somewhere else for now. Orlando/ Ann Arbor MRR: Star wars! Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Imagine satelites circling the earth waiting to destroy nuclear weapons before they can destroy our civilization. Gosh! This system, the \"strategic defense initiative\" as Reagan's newspeak terms it, could make nuclear weapons obsolete. Or could it. . . It sounds too good to be true, and it is. There are many reasons that this \"dream\" is just another nightmare disguised as national policy. Here are four reasons not be build it: 1) Stars wars won't work. Star wars depends upon the development of particle beams, lasar battle stations, kinetic energy weapons, geosynchronous relay space mirrors, and so on. I don’t pretend to understand these components, it’s frightening, though, when Reagan himself is unable to explain them. Since commentators and the President alike can’t understand it, we have to look to scientists for guidance. Their response is shocking. Huge numbers of our best scientific minds have come to the same conclusion: star wars won’t work. In fact, 700 members of the National Academy of Science and 53 Nobel Laureates have joined just one organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and are protesting this attempt to turn nightmare to reality. Remember, to be successful, star wars would have to stop every nuclear missile. None of the thousands and thousands can be allowed to make it through. Who's kidding who here? 2) Star wars will lead to a new arms race, in space and on earth. Imagine you're a defense planner in the Kremlin and the U.S. is developing a method to destroy your country's nuclear weapons before they land on the \"enemy's\" soil. It's a frightening prospect because it gives the U.S. a \"first strike\" capability. That means the U.S. could destroy all of your country and you couldn't strike back. Your only response is to develop your own star wars and at the same time speed up production of nuclear weaons to try to overwhelm the being paid to design and build star wars who could instead be paid to cure cancer, or maybe to fix my nose after I broke it at the show. Where will a trillion dollars come from? That's five or six times our feared national debt, folks. One trillion dollars equals five hundred billion cans of spray paint, and it may take that many to stop this nightmare. Star wars is wrong. The U.S. has signed treaties that prohibit space weapons. But then, when has that stopped Reagan? See Grenada, or more importantly, Nicaragua. Just one more point. Let's suspend reality and imagine that star wars will work perfectly, which it won't, and that we can afford it, which we can't. Let's say that it makes missiles which go into the upper atmosphere obsolete. Fine, but what about cruise missiles? You know, the ones that hug the ground all the way from launch till target. Star wars can't touch them! Even is star wars did work, it wouldn’t! Star wars should have been proposed on April Fools Day. The joke's on us. Many thanks to the Union of Concerned Scientists. By the way, if you have a spare million laying around, send it to them at: 26 Church St., Cambridge, MA, 02238. Eric Pierson/ 333 Flatbush Ave/ Brooklyn NY 11217 Dear MRR: Tonight while I was in the library at school, I decided to look at every newspaper in the place from Tuesday, April 30. Well, I was quite pleased with the results. No Business As Usual Day, although no major thing as far as the media was concerned, turned out to be a success as far as I'm concerned. The following papers carried articles and/or pictures of NBAU Day: Atlanta Constitution. _L.A.. Times._Ann Arbor News. Orlando Sentinel and at least two others. Whoever came up with the idea came up with a good one. I think we should do it Dear MRR, In reply to the letter from David Zvkavskas in #25. I often think about this issue myself, and here is a poem I made about it. Modern way Is this life worth the price we pay No way to live but by their modem way Your freedom is within their cage Society's standards are not for me That makes me a loser according to their modern ways The masses of society flow in one direction. You flow with them or get pushed off the side. The way I look at at, we represent square pegs and a round slot represents the one life style man's accomplishments have formed for society, which is a life of institutions. I am forced to spend my whole life in institutions, not only by law, but also by the environment. You could say I have been shaped into a round peg to fit into that round slot of society, never to know what I could have been. Victims of Accomplishment, Prisoners of Environment.

How many feminists does it take' to change a lightbulb? A. That's not funny.-Old Joke Quote #1 : \"Humor has been used to enslave women the same way slavery has been used to oppress black\". -Famous feminist. Quote #2: \"What about bands that call themselves \"joke\" bands and yet perpetrate more and more stances of hatred, violence and stupidity?. . .how much longer can bands go on cranking out the same old backwards drivel in the name of satire?\"— From a letter to MRR. Quote #3: \"Take my wife. . . please. \"-Henny Youngman. Okay, I'll admit it. I didn't think it was true. But now I'm a believer. \"What's humor?\" I used to ask myself. \"Something funny,\" I would answer. Occasionally it might be informative, abrasive, or stupid, but I never thought it was a tool of hatred and \"enslavement\". But, being an open-minded kind of a guy, I decided to check things out for myself. After all, it's one thing to be an intentionally nasty person, but it's quite another to go around causing violence and making slaves without realizing it. I’m sure most readers would be surprised to learn that I'm neither a fan of slavery nor random unintentional violence. Even so, I knew I might have to again inflict these in the name of research. At least this would be the last time. This is what I did: I walked down Bleecker Street until I found a nice lady who would talk to me. Matronly, in hfer early fifties, she seemed secure enough in her ways to resist a mild onslaught of humor. r, 'Scuse me ,\" I said. \"Do you know what Mrs. DeSade said when she was asked why she divorced the Marquis ?\" Her eyes widened in horror. She began to shake. \"N.. .n.. ..noo I don't,\" came her trembling reply. \"Beats me!\" I said and was about to laugh when I noticed a small rivulet of blood flowing from just under her hairline down next to her nose. \"Can’t BE!\" I thought. \"It's just a coincidence.\" But I had to know for sure. I went on. \"Do you know what the definition of FALSIES is?\" I asked. The woman stood there unable to move. Her lips twitched helplessly as she tried to speak. Realizing that she couldn't answer, I answered for her. \"Delusions of glandeur!. . .Ha, ha. . .\" My laugh caught in my throat, when suddenly her head snapped back and a large blue and yellow bruise appeared on her chin. She screamed \"No more! No more!\" Then she started yelling for the cops. \" Police ! Police!\" she shrieked. \"I'm the victim of humor! Help!! Help! Joke attack!\" Having recently read that some New York police were experimenting with new uses for cattle prods, I ran. I made it to Washington Square Park before I had to stop. I sat down on a bench, trying to catch my breath. \"Jesus!\" I thought. \"I was wrong. Humor really IS violent. Well, at least irs not enslaving.\" JusT then this pretty little punketlel walks up to me. I can tell the weekend punks because they can never figure out how to keep their earrings from snagging on their leather-jacket studs. This girl had her head in a permanently tilted position. \"Got any spare change?\" she asked. \"Did you hear the one about the stenographer and the six masturbating dwarfs?\" I asked. Immediately her eyes went blank. She stared straight off into space. \"Your wish is my command, master,\" she said and then fell to her knees and started fumbling with my belt. \"Oh my God!\" I yelled and tried to push her away. I am not one to take advantage of a girl under the influence of humor. \"Stop it!\" I begged. \"But master,\" she said. \"I'm only trying to serve your wishes.\" \"My wishes,\" I told her, \"are that you stand up, and get out of here . Take the first train back to New Jersey and stay there until you graduate from high school. She bit her lower lip in obvious disappointment at not being able to serve me better, but, true to her orders, she left the park. As you can imagine, I was a bit shaken by these events. I am rarely wrong, and even more rarely do I admit it. But now it was staring me right in the crotch. I had to reach the unavoidable conclusion: HUMOR HURTS. There it was, plain as the saliva on my pants. All this time I thought I was making fun, I was actually causing pain. All this time I thought that people were angry because they were stupid and \"didn't get it,\" the reality was that it (my humor) got them! I began to cry at my own ignorance and the sudden realization of all the harm I must've caused without knowing it. So now, I'm making this pledge: As certain as these events REALLY HAPPENED, that’s how certain I will be in my forswearance of humor. That's right. I'm giving it up, going cold turkey. Satire, parody, lampooning. . out the window. Puns, farce, slapstick. . .boom!! Done away with!! Joking, gags, shaggy dog stories, limericks. . .T'm kissing them goodbye. It's a new type of straight edge with a new type of straight face. I often criticize people for demanding changes in others before they are willing to change themselves. I would be a hypocrite if I did not do something in my Idlown life to make the world a better place. Now, I've taken a great step forward. I’ve kicked the humor habit. Maybe others wifi follow my example. Just think of how wonderful the world would be, if nobody ever had fun. h A/i n fl fljd Speaking so often of this \"positive attitude tends to trivialize that which I think is anything but trivial! I'd rather let my actions and attitude relay my message than my mouth. I 'm confident enough in myself that I know I project that feeling of positive energy without having to say it, or preach it . The reason I chose to write this column, and a factor in establishing my stance on it, is this \"trend\" of using \"positive\" as a pretext to label bands and fanzines or songs. Fine, labels are convenient in conversation, but too often I hear \"poitive\" being applied to one type of band. A \"positive\" band, it seems, is straight edge, hardcore, and is \"fun\". What about CRASS, MDC, and ANT I -SECT? Where do these \"peace bands\" fit in? Peace is about as \"positive\" a goal as I can think of. While the \"doom and gloom\" of some of them seems \"old\" at times, so does the \"go have fun\" and \"happy, nothing wrongers\" of the \"positive\" bands. A lot of the \"positive\" bands stress unity, yet those bands and zines don't like the \"peace bands\" or the \"negative bands\" or the \"arty bands \" — unite your faction? No new idea there — countries have done it for a long time--it's called nationalism. In our scene it's called two things: isolationism, and my term, bullshit . Positive is often confused with \"fun\". I associate the term \"positive attitude\" as having something to do with positive change and evolution. I mean, the assholes we oppose are out only for fun, except often at other's expense. The only difference I see between them and the \"fun\" bands and zines is the \"fun\" ones do it without bothering anyone. I'm not content to just have my \"fun\". I'm not content to be neutral. Neutral, to me, is no better than negative. The bottom line to all my r amblings is this: \"positive\" is a series of actions. It's not a label, it's not always fun, it's not neutral. It never is. Not to discourage anyone from calling themselves \"positive\", I only hope you'll live to justify that label, not to trivialize it. m trm Sips WK5£L f F#AS Martin Sprouse and I often encourage a \"positive attitude\" in our zine, ih.Q Lea d ing E d ge . I'd like to do a little less talking on the subject, though. Dear Kent , I've noticed that you haven't had a' column lately , so I thought I'd write about something that 's really been bothering me over the past years of inter-relating and living with people. It seems that although we think and talk and write and do a lot , when it comes down to everyday living and relating, we really come up short. And I'm finding it quite depressing . Boyfriend/girlfriend relationships , friends arguing and all that shit is what I'm trying to get at. Sometimes people just don't get along, that 's true, but sometimes it 's easier to not try to work things out. And that's disappointing. For those of us who are anti-this and that, anti-sexism, racism and authoritarianism, etc., etc., I wish we could try harder to be anti-animosity if others don 't agree with us, or do things a little differently or whatever . We seem to spend a lot of time criticizing other people instead of looking inwards at ourselves ( re all y looking) and accepting and giving .G.Qns.tJZUCt i ye criticism to our friends. If only we could accept that criticism from our friends, I think we 'd learn a lot because they see us in a way we can never see. A lot of broken relationships come from being a little too close-minded and set in our thinking to look at the other side of the coin. (I know I've done it.) Being open-minded and looking at both or all sides of political issues should go on into our personal lives, or vice versa, starting with ourselves before forming set opinions on major issues of the world. If we really value our friendships, we can help each other instead of constantly going through friends as if they were going out of style. I think it's horrible when one goes to a show or whatever and feels uncomfortable because \"so-and-so” is there. It's really hard though, I know, especially to try to re-establish a broken friendship, but we can't keep fighting each other or competing with each other, or soon we'll only be competing with a tiny circle of people and reaching no one else . I'd like to hear other people's opinions , or more importantly, solutions, if at all possible. Communication IS the key, and if we can't communicate with those in our community, how can any wider communication really be effective? Upset, and trying to be open-minded Anonymous Well hell, one thing right off the top is that it sure feels great to know that other people think along the same lines as you. Makes you feel that there i s hope-not that everything is so shitty, but sometimes it sure feels that way. As far as possible solutions-oh boy. It really depends on how the individual can and chooses to deal with it. I consider people to be just about the most important thing- I like watching, listening and talking with 'em. I also really try to know and understand my friends. Sure-there are differences between the way I_ feel, relate to and see things and the way others do, but I really think that's fucking cool (and sure as hell makes it interesting) . Also-it’s really important to take that into account, and not lump all people into one category-they ' re like \"this” and you deal with 'em like \"that.\" Everyone deals with things differently. Some people have a hard time their feelings into words, for instance. Maybe you (general \"you\"-not anonymous) feel that you can relate to people fine with an in-depth conversation, but it's important to remember that to some people, that ' s hard. So if they can't talk with you or perhaps don't have the reply you \"expected, \" or want, remember that it doesn't necessarily mean anything personal (so don ' t take it that way) , and try to find another way that you both can deal with each other. And shit- make an effort, try to understand them-because people are incredible . and real friends are valuable as hell, and worth the \"work\" to keep. You can learn a hell of a lot from your friends (and other people as a whole) -like how different people deal with life situations-as well as learn a hell of a lot about yourself. And fucking pay attention and file away all this information, because it's important stuff we're talking about here-PEOPLE, f or gods sake! You're gonna see 'em every day, so learn how to deal with 'em. Also included in this ramble is respect-quite an important factor. Respect people, because fuck-we're all human, and we're all here together. Also, resp"
