STORES DISTRIBUTORS call, write or fax SOUND OF CALIFORNIA • BOX 93691 HOLLYWOOD, CA 90093 (818) 981-5461 Hello, folks, It’s your good buddy Malcolm Tent of TPOS/T rash American Style checking in with a few good reasons why you should NOT support SOCIAL DISTORTION: SOCIAL D. recently signed with CBS Records, one of the huaest corporations in the music busi- ness. CBS has recently decided that there is a market for “alternative” music, so they’ve been grabbing bands like PRONG, POI DOG PONDERING, BIG DIPPER and the afore- mentioned SOCIAL DISTORTION. CBS has never shown any interest in the underground orthe people who support it. They are one of the most backwards and conservative labels on the planet concerning the issues of LP survival, parallel importing and home taping. They have shown that their concern does not lie with the rights of the music lover — only in the contents of the music lover’s pocket. Now they are signing bands with what they feel is a ready-made audience. And we are that audience. It is we in the underground who made these bands what they are today. SOCIAL DISTORTION owes its existence to the loyalty of fans who have stuck with them for more than 10 years. These fans are rewarded with a defection to a corporate monster that gives nothing to the scene. A corporation that only drains creative life from bands and throws away the lifeless husk. And SOCIAL DISTORTION have gone willingly. They hang with the big boys now, not us. Ample evidence of this was given when they played at the Anthrax in Norwalk, CT recently. The night was marked from the beginning by the SOCIAL D. road crew hassling the Anthrax staff over the size of the P.A. (wnich always seemed sufficient every other time the band played there), door price (which they wanted raised from $10 -12), paying the band in advance (very difficult to do when the audience was kept outside for about 45 minutes past opening time waiting for the squabble to end) and the number of people let into the club (the road crew head would not allow the doors to open until he got a counter to monitor the number of people admitted). The whole time threats were be- ing made that SOCIAL D. would not play unless everything was done their petty way. (The whole time the head of the road crew was threatening to cancel, the SOCIAL D. merchandise truck was open for business in the parking lot, selling us peon audience members souvenirs for a show they were not intending to do.) In spite of the apparent recalcitrance of SOCIAL DISTORTION to play under the unbearable conditions inflicted upon them by the Anthrax, they finally deigneato perform. Too bad for them, because the MELVINS blewthem clean away! Even GANGGREEN’s lackluster “awrite Connecticut howya doin’ out there” set showed more spirit than the lukewarm dishwater rock and roll slopped on us by SOCIAL D. The night ended for me about 20 min- utes into SOCIAL D’s tedious set. I’d finished packing my recording gear (taping shows is a personal fetish) and stuff I’d bought at the show when the head of the SOCIAL D. road crew came from behind me, opened my carry bag and started throwing the contents of it onto the floor. The whole time he was mut- tering “gimmethetapeyou made, gimmethe tape you made.” So I gave him the tape containing 45 minutes of GANG GREEN and 20 boring minutes of SOCIAL DISTORTION, which he proceeded to rip apart. After saving his pets from the evils of audience taping, he proceeded to rip into my personal posses- sions some more! For what reason I can only guess. (Perhaps he was bored with mixing the sound, a privilege he would not allow to the regular and very capable Anthrax soundman.) I knowthathometaping is killing SOCIAL DISTORTION’S career, but come on! The behavior of SOCIAL DISTORTION’S road crew offers proof that SOCIAL D. no longer give a whit of care about their fans. They hired that crew and their apparent endorsement of the crew’s behavior towards the club personnel, audi- ence and myself is what I take to be a reflection of their attitude towards their audi- ence. I felt pushed around, as did many of the people I talked to the day after the show. SOCIAL DISTORTION are now CBS Recording Artists and apparently thinkthey’ve outgrown playing miserable little clubs like the Anthrax. Their pompous treatment to- wards the people who are their bread and butter just proves why there is no room in the underground for corporate infiltration and those oands who want to play along with it. Sure, a band wants to expand its audience and be able to stop paying dues with hard years doing shit tours. I suggest you look at bands like 7 SECONDS, DOA or FUGAZI to see how it’s done. They have neitherforgotten their audience or homogenized their music and they keep going strong, bigger than ever. FUCK SElL-OUTS LIKE SOCIAL DISTORTION. THEY DON’T DESERVE YOU OR YOUR MONEY. IF THEY WANT TO PLAY COLISEUMS, FINE. But I don’t wantthem leeching off the underground any- more! Malcolm Tent TPOS prod./ Trash American Style/ 1 2 Mill Plain Rd./ Danbury, CT 0681 1 P.S. Since writing the above, I’ve found that SOCIAL D.’s roaa manager early in the evening told everybody waiting outside the clubto go home because SOCIAL D. weren’t playing. Then they tried to raise their guar- antee from $1000 to $1250. They realty did cancel in Trenton, NJ. because the P.A. “wasn’t good enough. ’’The evidence against this band keeps mounting... And lest you attribute these actions to the SOCIAL D. road crew and not the band, remember that SO- CIAL D. hired these idiots and at least tacitly approve of their actions from city to city. I say it again: FUCK SOCIAL DISTORTION. Tim, Your review of A//Solution’s “Butterfly” EP was shallow. Does somebody have to play piano and acoustic guitar to sing about want of love? There’s nothing “contradictory” about their musical style ana lyrical content. For a couple or more decades now, the “alternative” peoples - whether they be hip - pies, mods, rockers, punx, crusties, etc., have created a lifestyle befitting their wants in a world lacking love. They, and you, may deny wanting to be loved and/or to love, but it’s a trait inherent in almost all of us. (there are exceptions, I’ll grant, because of the warped way society is and how it has affected some since birth in a totally negative way). In your case, we’ll take HC. Angry kids in a hateful society on a war-torn planet. There’s no love there, but it’s desired. And as I said earlier, few of us admit that desire; it is there though - look at all the calls for unity, the attempts to disclose (and hopefully abolish) all that hate and destruction, people doing things to help others (and not out of being pragmatic), and on and on... So, to end, they’ve only expressed their views via the vehicle of their favorite musical style. The Mob and Omega Tribe (among others) sang about war and death and put it to music w/soft, slow songs. What’s the difference analogy-wise? Think, stink, and drink, Tin-Ear P.S. Not defending them cos they live here, I just found your comment outstanding about a band I know personally (and anyone can understand what I mean). Dear MRR, This letter is for the record collector people: You are being ripped off royally. I myself like a lot of old and hard to find music, punk or otherwise, and nowhere are out of print records more overpriced than in the punk genre. The Cramps have a lot of singles that are worth about $35 each IN MINT with the sleeve, but $40 for Motorhead’s Ace Of Spades? That is ridiculous. It just goes to show you that if you’ll do anything for a record, people will pluck out both your eyes and skullfuck you for money. My advice is for you to wait. “Punk record collecting” is a pretty new thing and the prices go down once the hype wears off. I know, because I wanted every Frank Zappa/ Mothers record, and people were asking for $100 for Freak Out! during the PMRC shit. The record is worth $45, and always was. People will fuck you right through your wallet if they know they can. If a person won’t make you a. tape for free or for a small fee, in the case of these $400 records, they are assholes. If you’re in New Jersey, try the Princeton Record Exchange for punk and HC stuff. They’re pretty reasonable when they know something is rare, and prices get ridiculously low if they don’t know when it’s worth money. They’ll buy old records too. No, I don’t work there. Don’t let rich brats turn punk into profit. A record is only worth what someone will pay for it. Bargain with the people. “List prices” are for MINT. A scratch or two depreciates the value, so don’t pay top price for messy vinyl. Remember — if the single came off a record and has an already released song on the flip side, buy the LP! Who the fuck cares if you have every single by certain group! SnadowFox Hi, My name is Rich and I am attempting to organize a “punk” picnic up here in Canada. Hopefully it will be happening on Sept. 1 at Coronation Park in Oakville (just outside of Toronto). My main problem is getting the park — I am also working on a couple of other parks as back-ups. I am passing the picnic off as an “independent music festival.” The park has a bandshell that we will be able to use. Anyone who can help in anyway, please contact me. If you can help just for a day or help organize, get equipment, anything, I could use the help. If any bands want to play (for free) please contact me. If I can get enough bands I will try and get the park tor Sunday also. Anyone who can put some- body up or needs a place to stay should contact me also. I will see what I can do. So come on up, and have a good time. Rich/ 548 Wedgewood Dr./ Burlington, Ont./ Canada L7L 4J2 Dear MRR Readers, After three and a half years Slug & Lettuce has gone through a few changes. First off, I’ve nad a format change to a one page newsletter style, emphazing communi- cation through FREE classifieds (hint). Things are working better this way — issues are free (with a stamp) and I’m getting them out to more interested people. More importantly at this point though I want to let everyone know about my address change , this one will be permanent: S&L7 Chris Boarts/PO Box2067, Peter Stuyvesant Station/ NY, NY 10009. Thanks to everyone who has written, sup- ported and helped me out over the years. And special thanks to MRR for the help and the space. Keep up the good mag. Chris(tine) Slug Maximum R’n’R, My name is Zach and I live in Los Angeles but only use mail order (you would notbelieve how dead this scene is!). Anyway I ordered some stuff from Anarchy Records some 3 1/2 months ago and have received nothing. I have called the number (313)842- 5942. It has been disconnected. I have written on three occasions and received no word. I don’t even mind that it takes awhile. I just want some word on it! Dean Carls is who the check was made out to. If this happened to anyone else, please write to Zach Zimmerman/ 842 12th St #2/ Santa Monica, CA 90403 Dear MRR, I’ve been reading a lot of letters in MRR lately concerning mail order and distribution rip-offs. Well, what has happened to me has not yet been addressed (that I know of...), and I think it is equally important. Last summer my band LYNYRD’S IN- NARDS released our first demo, a 14-song cassette called Hellclown . Obviously, a lot of time and effort went into this project, not to mention money. In the November issue of MRR (#72), our tape received a really fa- vorable review. As a result of this review, many people got in touch with us about ordering merchandise. Also, a lot of people wrote to us claiming that they were working on compilation tapes, and we could be in- cluded if we would send them a tape. Well, out of our original pressing of 200 tapes, we were down to our last 10 or so, but we figured that the compilations were a good idea, so we sent off the last of our tapes. Well, out of these 1 0 tapes, we’ve only heard a response from one person, Bug Scratch tapes out of Texas. As for the other 9 or so others who received free Lynyrd’s Innards, we hope you enjoy them at our loss. Something else. Also as a result of that review, we received offers from a few bands wanting to trade their demos for our demos. We traded with two bands, and luckily they both sent us tapes. But other bands aren’t so lucky. My pal Bryan Chuck of FIANDY W/ SHOVELS tells me that after sending out about 10 tapes for “trade,” he’s only heard from like two bands. Mind you, this is after first writing to the band and receiving a reply saying that they would like to trade. What is this bullshit? To me it just seems like a huge scam so that people can build up their tape and record collections. Admittedly, this is not the first time we’ve been taken advantage of, and I’m sure it won’t be the last. But Lynyrd’s Innards will be putting out a 7” single pretty soon, and if we get a good review and you're doing a comp tape, it’s going to be a little tougher tor you to get a copy, that’s all. On behalf of Lynyrd’s Innards, thank yous to: Bryan and H.w/S., Ivan and P.O.E., and Bug Scratch tapes for their hone.sty and help. If anybody out there got our tape for a comp tape and hasn’t written back, please do, if only just to tell us that we suck and you’re not going to use us. Anyone else feel free to write too. Love, J. Castaldi/ 1204 Aspen Dr./ Valparaiso, IN 46383 Dear MRR (JC), You reviewed my zine and ripped it apart because of an interview w/ Hellhound. You claimed the interview cut on “women and aids” (something I disagree with — be- cause I would not have printed if it had!). You also claim poor judgment on the editor’s part for “not commenting or rebutting.” First of all, my zine sends out written interviews. They’re printed “as is.” Also, if you read the entire zine, you would have found an interview with Fifth Column, an all girl band who presented the female view on many of the same ques- tion asked of Hellhound, thus presenting more than one opinion. You can’t hold a zine responsible for the opinions of the bands featured. If you did, you cpuld pick fights w / every zine editor, including MRR! (who feature ads for bands that may share the same views as Hellhound — do you screen all the bands who advertise in MRR? I see GG Allin ads in MRR!) Inter- views are to give you, the reader, information about a band; their thoughts and opinion. If you disagree with them, then you can write the band and tell them, refuse to support that band (not but their records) or you can vent your hostility at the zine editor (not the more plausible choice). If you didn’t like my zine, you shouldn’t have reviewed it — a waste of time and ink. I could go on, but I won’t. I just wanted to defend my zine from your insulting review. I think you judged w/out thinking and enjpy criticizing much more than you enjoy reviewing the free materials people send you. Lisa Zugang/ Zugang zine Dear Lawrence Livermore, Must finished reading your column in June ’90s MRR. Touche! You mentioned “rumors” about Henry Rollins. Well, myfriend Paul X was with me at Club Pizzazz in Philadelphia a few years back when Henry Rollins made the remark, “are there any homosexuals in the audience? Well, this song’s for you!” Paul wrote about it and I think it ran in JD’s zine. Yeah, I “respected” Henry all the way back to Black Flag. People in the crowd at his show were jeering (at tne fags?) after what he said. Paul X and I felt threat- ened, and most of all, turned off. Where does Henry get off saying stupid things like that to impressionable minds raised onhomophobic morality!?!?! I guess it goes to show you, everyone gets caught Being an asshole, sometimes in front of acaptive audience. I go to shows, although not as much as I used to. If I’m with a guy I like, you better believe we’ll kiss or holcT hands, like the straights. Any- body have a problem with it (celebrity or not), fuck off! Jorge X MRR and readers, I have spent the last few days trying to understand Lawrence Livermore’s blasting of Rollins. I am a big fan of Rollins, both band and spoken word, and I fail to see the macho mentality that Lawrence thinks is so much of Rollins personality. I have 20 or 30 hours of Rollins spoken word besides the release tapes and it seems to me he spends a lot of time divorcing himself from this way of think- ing. When Rollins does talk about his sex life it does include women. Is not being gay something to be ashamed of? He certainly never comes off as bragging, just honest. I don’tthinkthis means Rolfins is homophobic. This brings me to what really pissed me off about the column. I guess Lawrence didn’t think his opinion held enough merit on its own — he had to validate it with rumors. I don’t know if there is any truth to the rumors or not (I hope not) but I don’t think it’s fair to slander someone with tabloid style journal- ism. Lawrence uses the fact that he has heard these rumors several times so they must have some kind of truth behind them. When I was in high school I remember hearing many many times that Alice Cooper ate shit on stage, also that Rod Stewart had to have half a gallon of sperm pumped out of his stomach. I didn’t think that frequent telling of these tales made them any more true. Lawrence Livermore is by far the big- gest reason I read MRR. I really think he*s great and not liking Rollins would not change this. But I think he is a better writer than to have to tell bullshit to make a point. I would love to see Rollins debate Lawrence. Thanks and take care, Bobby/ 615 Rampole/ Memphis, TN 38127. P.S. Speaking of homophobic, I noticed Lawrence was quick to let us know that the boyfriend he wanted to take to the next Rollins show and hold hands with doesn’t exist. Not afraid someone would m istake you for gay are you? Is it my fault I can’t get a boyfriend? Probably; I haven’t had any luck getting a girlfriend either. No doubt I should take les- sons from Henry. Lawrence Ben, After reading the letters in MRR 85 it seems to me that you have replaced Mykel Board as the most controversial columnist in MRR. Keep up the good work and good luck in next year’s Flipside “Asshole of the Year” Poll. Dave Ratsmen/ PO Box 591 85/ Chicago, IL 60659 MRR, I would like to make a few comments about some things I read in issue #85. First off, to Matt. I have also been reading MRR for many years and relate to it better than any other publication I have read and your first letter has prompted me to write mine. I agree with you that MRR is not Punk Rock. MRR is a magazine, but I don’t know how you can say that punk rock is nothing but “hate, chaos, nihilism and destruction.” Punk rock is anger . The words you use to define punk are just some of the ways people have chosen to express that anger. Punk rock is not unintelligent or ignorant. People who resent society usually do so because they see and know things that most other people are completely ignorant of. (Listen to the lyrics of '‘God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols, \"We are the Ones” by the Avengers and “Depression” by the old Black Flag?) As far as the fashion end of it is con- cerned, what is wrong with a person dressing and wearing their hair any way they please?

Maybe where you come from all the fashion models have mohawks or 8\" spikes and wear Dead Kennedys and Christ on a Crutch t-shirts, but here in rural upstate New York, that hasn’t happened yet and I don’t think it’s about to. You say we should get rid of ou r “fucking label,” well I say to you why don’t you get rid of all yourfucking labelsfor punk rock f hate, chaos, nihilism, destruction, ignorant, un- caring, depression, damaged, suicide, fuck off”) and let the music stand on its own. Next I would like to say to Pig Cham- pion I don’t know how you feel about racism but I feel that age-ism is just as bad as racism. There are old assholes, there are young assholes, there are old cool people, there are young cool people and saying that only one in ten thousand old people deserve to live is about as funny as the words “nigger” and Pollock or the holocaust. May you live to be 100 and meet some young whipper- snapper like yourself. Lastly I would like to applaud Dan O’Mahony for his comments on punk rock as the basis of hardcore. Hardcore is punk rock and there is nothing wrong withthat. I hope the newer people in the scene aren’t starting to believe the mainstream media image of punk as seen on television and at the mov- ies. That’s all for now, Psycho-Billy Cadillac/ 5853 W. Sweden Rd/ Bergen, NY 14416 MRR & Readers: In issue #83 there was a excellent article entitled “Fighting the War on Drugs”. Just a few hours before reading it I was subjected to the immoral act of urinating in a small jar by the State Correctional System in front of a officer. I’m presently a state inmate here and would of refused to do so but refusal is grounds for throwing me in the box with the possibility of time being taken away from me. This means that I could lose up to six months time of my freedom. Being that I’m a prisoner doesn’t affect my rights as a citizen (or does it?). My con- stitutional rights are freely violated whenever they feel like it. I’m outraged that this can happen and am pleading with you readers for help. I need literature and even legal help so that I may be able to fight the State of New York Correctional System. So that others and myself are no longer ordered to piss on demand. If I can win a court case against them it will help others in the world who are affected by the urine test also. I must fight but I can’t stand alone. Send Literature & Help or just to write to: David J. Pudney #88-A-6141/ Lincoln Cor- rectional Facility/ 31 West 110th St/ New York, NY 10026 To Anon in #85 and whoever read it: I’m glad someone finally took some sort of astance against DMS’ bullshit. They’re just a bunch of ultra-violent hoodlum thugs, for the most part. There are some very cool and aware DMS members that should not be forgotten. Then there are the rest... Scotty Banks and a few of the others are now in prison, probably for quite some time, I’m sure. Unfortunately, I know very few others who considerthis a good thing, except maybe his victims’ families. He was a good pal to a lot of people, but that certainly doesn’t justify any of his actions! The NY scene has suffered greatly from the violence that went on over the winter — there are next to no shows in the city that usually attract DMS types, and it’s hurting the rest of us that are just in it to have fun, not to et dusted and go kill someone. But, rumor as it that some leader types and the owner of CBGB have worked out some kind of deal that as long as there are no fights we’ll get the Sunday matinees back, yet again. Word has spreacf and everyone seems pretty into it, so maybe it’ll work? All of us who denounce the tactics of DMS and their pals hope so! So anyone in or around the NYC area, why don’t we all get together and stop the hatred and violence that’s near ruined our scene for us? Unity and brotherhood — isn’t that what being a skin is all about? Keep the face... Anon Dear Friends: This is the story and the facts concern- ing the happenings with the English band Bomb Disneyland. This text in its form is not supposed to be published like this — it’s there to inform you with the facts. Of course this sheet should also help to spread what sort of pigs “B.D.” are. Pigs nobody needs, especially not in “our scene.” Any support, spreading the facts, boy- cott, etc is welcome and appreciated, as well as necessary ! We should make sure no other people do the same mistake and support this band in any form. But read for yourself and decide. Sometime in March, Paul Bolten (Concorde - agency London) contacted me and told me that B.D. play two gigs in Swit- zerland, so they have to go through Germany anyway and might as well play 2-3 gigs on their way down. He then asked me if I’m interested to book those gigs, (note: a while ago B.D. wasontourover here with Australia’s very popular Hard Ons as a support act and played in front of large crowds.) 1 told Paul the band shouldn’t expect those 2-3 gigs to be like the tour with the Hard Ons, that means, not that many people, no hotels, no contracts, etc. I also make sure that the band will get money, good and drunks and a place to stay, in private. Paul said he’s aware of that and it is ok — we agreed on a +/- guarantee and the above mentioned. I don’t even wanna mention how much of a pain in the ass it was to book the band. It was heavy, cuz nobody showed interest anyway. well, I finally booked them with three gigs with a day off in-between each. I faxed tne necessary information to London (dates, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) and also told him I’d come to the last gig in Balgheim. While the band was on the road, I heard that they never made it in time to the venues (remember the day off!). In Nieder Olm they appeared one nour before the place had to close. On April 5 I met the band in Balgheim, talked to tne bass player and he started to complain. It started that they expected me in Husum to travel with them, as we agreed on — of course we never even talked about that with Paul. He also complained that they’re not able to do soundchecks (remember their late arrival times) and it seemed to be sur- prising that there were no hotels booked for them, and they complained about sleeping at people’s houses. They also wondered about contracts and bottles of whiskey, the long driving distances, high gas prices, blah, blah, blah. (I’d like io mention that the three people in the band had four more people with them !) I explained to the bass player that we never talked about all that and that everything went like I agreed with Paul. He said that we should talk after the gig. He started with the same bullshit again and I repeated that ev- erything was correct; he became more ag- gressive. After a while he started to call me a liar and accused me that I want to rip them off. Then he demanded 200 DM from me whic(\\of course, I did not give to him. He continued to call me a liar and that I ripped them off, wanted me to empty my pockets, the 200 DMs... The whole thing got kinda stupid, cuz I told him all the facts, so I left. Rignt after I walked out of the door, B.D. and crew came behind me, called me a liar, yelled, demanded money. Then everything happened quite quick — one of the crew members started to attack me, with the rest following him, we fell to the ground and they started to kick me. Two friends of mine helped me, yelling, little fights, etc. (one of them had a broken glass in his hand!). We couldn’t fight back due to their number, brutal surprise attack and us also being not sober anymore. We escaped in a van, that got its backlights smashed in by B.D., and they threw bottles. Everybody was more or less ok, except for me. My leg around the ankle was mega swollen and the nextday the doc told me that my ankle is broken. Three days later I went to the hospital. They had to do an operation, put screws in my bone and I had to stay there for 1 4 days. I’m out now, and have a cast that’ll be there for 3-4 weeks. The screws should be taken out in six months and it’ll take 4-8 months until I can use the leg 100%. I don’t think I need to mention that B.D. didn’t give me the money they owed me for booking their dates. A day after the confron- tation I talked to Paul again. He confirmed that all the agreements we made are ok, and things are correct. That’s the story, true facts. Build your own opinion and helpto avoid something like this again. We don’t need pigs! At this point I’d like to thank all the people who already support me and show solidarity. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Take care, Dolf Hermannstadter To the readers of MAX RnR; The following is a personal message to two pe rso ns . On e of t h ese pe rson s co m m itted a crime in my presence, and I was forced to tell the authorities what I know. The other, the one person’s best friend, has threatened my life as a result. My hope is that they will, both, read this, and understand the problem from my perspective... When you brought your gun into my car, I immediately felt violated. I am very against senseless violence and feared the worst. I also felt, because of our seemingly strong, solidfriendship,thatyou would respect me enough nol to use your weapon for ill purposes. I assumed wrong and, as a result, I was forced to become the proverbial “ ass.” When “the shit hit the fan,” I tried to duck. When your step-mother turned you in, I was named as someone who knew more information. For the following week and a half, I stayed away from home, trying to avoid a visit from our “city’s finest.” I did not wish to aid in your punishment, but I had no choice. By chance, a sheriff’s deputy caught me at home, and he explained to me that, if I did not cooperate with them, in their investigation, I faced charges of \"accessory to a violent crime,” punishable by a minimum of three to five years in maximum security prison. This would be unjust to me, and I felt little com- passion toward you, as you violated our friendship, and endangered the lives of in- nocent people, my family, and myself (not to mention the death-blow you dealt those in- nocent animals). I do not come to you in fear or apology. You nearly killed my little sister! You en- dangered my little brother! And you held a weapon to my head (on three occasions)! Was I supposed to view you as my friend of sound mind? Think what you’d have done, if I’d threatened vour life and the lives of your loved ones. Think what you’d do, if you’d been told you were to face criminal charges for my crime. You’d have done the same thing I Now that all is said and done, you wish to see me dead. As if it was my fault that you got your deserved punishment! I did you NO harm. I only helped you. You are now learning that your actions were wrong, and that you must pay the price. Don’t accuse me, YOU are at fault! One day, I hope you will open your clouded mind and realize that I didn’t just do it to \"save my ass” (as I am innocent), but I did it to make you realize that what you did was One Hundred Percent WRONG ! I will speak to either of you, on the grounds that NO VIOLENCE takes place. I do not wish to be friends. I only want to make you realize that your wrongdoing is* your fault. If you wish to continue to view me as a \"Narc” or to continue your barrage of IDLE death threats, that is your prerogative. Oh, and if I 'm such a \"Narc,” why haven’t I turned you in for all those other things I know of?! Now you know where I stand. Where do you stand? One final note — I DO NOT support the police state any more than you do not. But, like it or not, I had NO choice but to comply. I will never stand unjustly accused, and I will not make an apology for a crime I DID NOT, and WOULD NOT commit. This letter will appear in issue #2 of my fanzine, FREE THOUGHT (not to be con- fused with the Straight-Edge fanzine out of MD). I have sent this, so that others who may have had similar situations arise in their lives, or who may be Anarchist (like myself), may see that sometimes situations arise, in our imperfect world, where we may have to fall in line with law and order. People having mentalities, such as the two persons this pertains to, will drag the revolution down. But even more so, they will drag the most im- portant thing down with them... other people. 1 hope the two persons in question will write to me, or meet me on \"neutral” ground to do away with this futile situation. It is my hope thatthey willseethis letter in either MAX RnR or FREE THOUGHT , or someone will point it out to them, so that the stupidity will cease. Thank you for your time. Christian/ PO Box 8720/ Fort Collins, CO 80524-8720 U$A MR&R and Friends, Good morning, day, evening. I write to you to express something rather personal. It is difficult to say what I’m about to say to god knows how many people. On April 14, 1990 I learned that I had Hodgkin’s Disease, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system (the primary combatant against disease ana infection). I ranted and raved. I cried. I screamed, \"Why me?” I took my anger, my pain, my frustration out on my friends, my family, those I worked with. I was committed to the fact that I was going to die, knowing only the horrors of radiation and chemotherapy. Christ, 21 years old is too fucking young to die. So, you ask, why the hell is this guy subjecting us to his life's problems? There is a message coming (uh-oh). Sol have cancer. I’ve got a 70%-80% recover rate. What about those who have AIDS? They have (at this time) a 0% recov- ery rate. Unless a cure is found for that diabolical disease, every individual who is diagnosed with Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is going todie. What about children in parts of Africa who rarely live beyond early childhood? What about people who live in situations where they cannot get the most basic medical care. What about racism? Sexism? Homophobia? Homelessness? Ad Nauseum. What I’m saying is that no matter what your problem may be, you can almost guar- antee that you’re a hell of a lot better off than other citizens of Mother Earth. Stop griping and start looking beyond your own petty little problems, whether they be high door prices or cancer. Phew! Sorry to lay this on you.

Thanks. Dear MRR, I recently disassociated myself with the hardcore/punk scene, but I still feel that I have some feelings for your magazine that I want to come to terms with, andlike many of the letter writers I have a story /philosophy to tell. The reason why I was probably attached to MRR was because of the columns. Those editorials had a way of making me personally attached (the objective of my entering the scene) to the publication morethan the shows or anything else the scene had to offer. So I couldn’t throw off my attachment to the mag as easily as I did away with the scene. The main reason I had to get out of the scene was because I was a black kid. The reasons why my blackness was relevant will be discussed later. I first got into punk when I saw \"Sid and Nancy.” The punk culture seemed like an interesting aspect of white culture that I wasn’t aware of, being en- trenched (not unhappily) in the world of the black ghetto. When I moved into the white suburbs I decided to expose myself to that form of white culture if I was going to be involved in any form of white culture (I didn’t want to become a close-minded recluse). \"Never Mind the Bollocks” seemed like the only punk record I was ever going to like, and I bought a sufficient amount of Sex Pistols memorabilia, I decided to get in- volved in what I considered the existing form of punk which was Hardcore. It was neces- sary to do this because since I started living my life off .of the Sex Pistols in the frighten- ingly dull suburbs, I needed something else to live off of since the Pistols was becoming a dead end. The first Hardcore record I bought was the first Millions of Dead Cops LP just be- cause cover looked like what I conceived hardcore as being. It proved to be a wise choice as it turned out to be ultimate extrem- ism, attitude wise and musically, I had hoped for. But the raised expectations I received from that record failed me as my dollars wasted away on Spermbirds, Diajits and Kissin’ Cousins’ records. I decided that I had to attach myself to agenre of HCthat wouldn’t let me dpwn. This genre became the straight edge scene. I got into it because of my neighbor convinced me that Ray of Today’s anti-racist lyrics overrode any perceived threat I had of the nazi skinheads who were in the scene. I engulfed myself in the scene and began to see the attitudes behind the lyrics. Some bands seemed to be as sincere on the sub- ject of racism as they could be, but it seemed like just another well needed song concept for a lot of bands who didn’t really have anything to say. After my pal began to hang out with a nazi crowd, the nazi’s attacking blacks be- coming evident to me, and the attitudes of the scene became apparent, my disillusion- ment increased rapidly. First off, I couldn’t really say the music got to my pleasure senses. As I implied before the main attraction was the social in- volvement. I could tell when a band was good, what kind of way they had to play so they would be \"really Hardcore,” but I always thought that I never really had the love for tne music that I should of had if I really enjoyed it. Subsequently after an attempt to create an international HC correspondence newsletter failed, I created my own \"zine.” It came out extremely soulless. Soon the social side turned out to be a bust. Do not get the assumption that if I wasn’t in the SE scene everything would have been okay, I feel the major problem stemmed from the differences, social and otherwise of black and white. The non-racist SE kids seemed to have a way of liking Skewdriver which puzzled me, and just the plain attitude in which I was dealt with by most whites, even the people I considered sincere, made me see that tar some reason that whites, in a totally white dominated arena such as the hardcore scene, had a way of relating to blacks that I did not appreciate. It was like every show somebody did some- thing to piss me off, and it was usually the supposed non-racists. To any slight I received from my white comrades, I didn’t respond because I felt it served me right for entering a white domi- nated social set. I never was conditioned to hang around whites like many black hardcore kids so I felt I always had the option of leaving. This was their thing and if I didn’t like it I should get out. I saw ana admired militant blacks in the scene but because of the scene’s nature they seemed to be constantly fighting an unwinnable war. I also really didn’t like the fact that since I was a black in white scene I had to become a staunch integrationist, al- ways ready to run off some garbage about how blacks should mosh along witn whites, some of whom would subsequently kick the ★ * NIHILISTICS * NEW RELEASE ON YELLOW VINYL * * * “FUCK THE HUMAN RACE” ALSO ON GREEN VINYL AND CASSETTE “BAD . . .

Please don’t take this as a letter saying \"you hypocritical straight edge bastards because I don’t care to indict anyone of any racist thought. I don’t blame the non-racist kids for being jerks because I understand that it is the nature of America to breed that kind of mindset, plus it is just the nature of groups. When you get a group of people that tnink they have something in common it is natural for them to treat perceived outsiders of that group differently and callously. Since I understand that fact I do not intend to start a civil rights movement within the hardcore scene. I am attatching myself, and I think all other blacks should attach themselves to the rap scene (which I grew up on and always have loved), and hardcore should be left to the whites, this process will definetly sepa- rate black kids from white kids more, but it no one is going to create a better solution for all of the olacK kids that get fucked up in the scene then why are we staying or listening to the people that say stay? I am aware this notion will anger hardcore blacks, and probably give more fuel to the nazi’s but I don’t feel integrationist blacks can break the group mentality and American programming white hardcore kids have. I understand that many blacks in differ- ent areas fit well into the scene but here in the NY, NJ, macho, SE, nazi, type of HC scene malaise too many blacks are being brutally assaulted for me to advocate our participa- tion. And if we did try to convert the nazis we would probably be fighting so much that it wouldn’t make any sense to be involved, just stay with our troops in preparation for the next battle. So if inevitably all we are going to do is battle let’s just stay away so we can battle effectively, not within their arena. Not a pretty solution but no one can make light of all of tne injured blacks in the scene. The sad thing about this solution is that while the hardcore scene, with its hated but yet still active skinhead population will try extremely hard to get rid of tne blacks in the scene, we blacks cannot get white domina- tion out of rap, rock and roll, or anything else we have created, so this separation itself is sort of a joke. Everything whites have claimed they possess, their women, their neighbor- hoods, their jobs, their cultural whatevers, they have throughout American history killed Blacks for trying or perceiving we want to obtain them, but we blacks have had nothing that whites couldn’t obtain. This includes our women, our property, our neighborhoods, our money, our culture and our lives. At this very moment, while white com- munities are protecting their neighborhoods from the threat of black infiltration, neigh- borhoods like Harlem in New York which were and probably still are perceived as places only blacks would dare to venture, are seeing the emergence of more and more disgruntled white residents, and with their arrival many blacks (one of whom could of been my mother under similarcircumstances recently so I know of the neighborhoods I speak of) are being put out in tne streets. So while we blacks are legally buying houses in Canarsie Brooklyn in New York only to have them illegally burned down by people threatened by us, whites in Harlem are buying and residing in houses in predominantly black communities and not threatening our exist- ence but causing our actual demise because to attract whites to the buildings landlords have to raise the rent up hign, and stop maintaining the building so either the black residents will be evicted orthe building will be condemned so they can start over and go condo. If whites can claim Canarsie wny couldn’t Harlem be left to the blacks? Alas the sad answer lies in the unfair nature of white supremacy. The dilemma we black separtists are confronted with by the white supremacists isthatforwhatevertheory this person is working under, he wants to unconditionally rule and dominate us while we want to get away from him. I’m sure many American white supremacists can take the bold stand of not wanting blacks around anymore, this stand is inconsequential be- cause if your forefather white supremacists felt this way we wouldn’t be here to bother you in the first place (and in England if your white dominated government didn’t allow immigration we wouldn’t be bothering you there either). Plus this bold switch of white su- premacists turning from practices of slavery to separation usually occurs when the blacks stop being of any value to him. The extremely white supremacist southerner of the early 20th century used to beat, terrorize, and disallow any black person trying to leave the South because he still needed them for labor. So even with all of that hate, the legendary southern white supremacist didn’t want black people to leave his place of residence. This also was evident of American segregation. We blacks were kept from your neighbor- hoods, your women, your toilet seats, but not from your policies, your taxes, your murder, your economic exploitation, your rape and your injustice. So while you American white su- premacists demand we blacks go back to Africa so whites can share in the riches of America they have rightfully earned and deserve, your white supremacist brothers in South Africa don’t seem like they’ll be going back to Europe anytime soon to give us, the returning niggers, the riches of diamonds and precious metals our black ass continent Africa is full of, that the Blacks that belong there should deserve. Why is that? Well the honest white supremacist will tell you white supremacy isn’t about fairness or separation, but plain old dominance through policies of slavery and apartheid. It’s aboutManifest Destiny (rememberthattheory from the High School history books) the theory that says the white man should steal, enslave, rape and exploit because he has the god given right to. So you black hardcore kids please remember the next time you plan to debate a white supremacist he isn’t interested in cor- rect theories of reasoning, but enslaving your ass. Why? Because slavery is a fun institution for the oppressors. Plenty of profits and free and unconditional sex (and you didn’t know why black Americans are so multicolored and lightshaded) the two ele- ments that have corrupted humanity throughout time. Since the white suprecist is singleminded in his goal you should iust understand him for what he is and try to deal with his inevitable assault on you. Wny is the assault inevitable? Because there can be no happiness on the part of someone who used to nave the right to fuck you all he wanted and now has that right taken away from There should be no black kids in the hardcore/punk scene or any white dominated area of American life (if they can help it), and if you remain in it you deserve every ass kicking you receive from it. Just another nigger. Dear MRR, I just can’t believe it. I just can’t fucking believe it. I always thought that MRR was against violence and oppression; I always thought it was an INTELLIGENT magazine. But in No. 85 1 was confronted with two pages of propaganda for an organisation whose onj^ goal is violence ana oppression: the Before I start, I’d like to say that first, I’m a 21 -year-old anarchist who has lived in Northern Ireland all his life and second, as you might have guessed, I’m against vio- lence and oppression. Okay? I’ve grown up. with tne Troubles’ — they started three months after I was born — and hearing about the IRA, UDA, UDR, INLA, U VF, RUC, etc. on the news and on the street every day has become ‘natural’ to hear about. But what about Mitzy Carlough? How often has she been here? How much experience has she of Northern Ireland? In other words, what the fuck DOES she know?? That’s the problem with this country, or rather with the l right-on’ people who live outside Northern Ireland, they think the IRA are 'freedom fight- ers’ or ‘liberators’ and jump on the band- wagon and support them, send cash tothem, which the IRA use to KILL Irish civilians. As Rab Pennie pointed out in his letter a good few issues ago: you can play your romantic ‘Irish freedom fighter’ roles at home, we have to fucking live here! The IRA’s main purpose is not fighting for Irish Catholics. If they were, how come only a minority (estimated at most around 20%) of Catholics in Northern Ireland sup- port them? How come they have virtually no support in the Republic of Ireland, a country which in theory should be behind them all the way? This is reflected in Sinn Fein’s showing at elections, where they never win over 1 5% of votes in Northern Ireland, and when they stood in the Republic of Ireland elections last year, they only polled around 2%. Why? Because people on this island are sick to death of the IRA’s hypocrisy in their actions. Sinn Fein’s election slogan is 'Free- dom Justice Peace’: that’s a bit sick when you consider the hundreds of civilians (many Catholics included) that the IRA have mur- dered since 1969. What your 'Irish expert’ Carlough also failed to mention is the extor- tion rackets the IRA use to obtain money within Northern Ireland. They give death- threats to building contractors, forcing them to hand over ‘protection money’ — this has resulted in the loss of many jobs in the building trade. Sinn Fein whine about the lack of jobs in Northern Ireland, when at the same time the IRA are causing unemploy- ment by destroying factories and forcing employers out of work. Hypocrisy at work, More money-making ventures by the IRA include drug-dealing, pornography, dog- baiting (training dogs like Rottweilers, Do- bermans etc. to fight against each other so the IRA can run the gambling at these ‘shows’. Who said the IRA were animal lovers?) and most sickening of all, child-prostitution. Ironi- cally, it was a Nationalist newspaper (The Sunday World) that uncovered tne IRA’s involvement in this sick trade. Another Nationist newspaper (The Irish News) had in an editorial, after yet another 'wrong target’ shooting by the IRA: ‘It’s not the shooting that is the mistake, the IRA is the mistake’. Put it this way: if Britain were to withdraw from Northern Ireland tomorrow, the IRA would be, to put it mildly, pissed off. They would have in theory no reason to exist, so all their money-making drug-smuggling and kids-for- cash scams would have to be called off — that would hurt the rich lifestyles of the men at the top of Sinn Fein and the IRA. Of course the IRA aren’t the only mur- derers on this island. We’ve got the Loyalist paramilitaries, who are just as bad as the IRA in all aspects — they even work together in ‘protection’ rackets (which makes tne para- military organisations on both sides look more and more like the fucking Mafia). Then you can’t forget the good ole British neavy-hand- edness in our land, Young English knuckleheads out to shoot some ‘Paddies’ — imagine English football hooligans with guns — that’s the British Army. The police? Well, police are police wherever you go in the world so I needn’t waste space here detailing what bastards they are in Northern Ireland, you’d know yourselves. So, what’s it like to live in this beautiful country (yea, it is beautiful, but first take away the terrorists, bigots, clergy, politicians, army, olice, government, etc.) of ours? Well, we ave high unemployment, substandard hous- ing and nealth-care, internment without trial... yes I lifted that line from Carlough’s propa- ganda article and I suppose she was half-right, but the fact is though that everyone, Catholic and Protestant, working-class especially, have those problems to deal with. But, gradually, there is hope. More people are realising how pointless it is fighting over national identity and ancient religions and are gradually coming together. I’m hoping and working for the day when all Irish people (and all over the world) will forget worthless flags and live as one... but assholes like Carlough are making that day too far away in the future to be seen. Look, if anyone wants a true picture of Northern Ireland, don’t write to Carlough and her seriously misguided cronies, write to: Warzone/ PO Box 148/ Belfast/ BTI/ Northern Ireland. I’d love to give you my address, except I’m frightened, yes frightened; if the IRA found out who I was I would have my knees blown off — that’s IRA 'Freedom Justice Peace’foryou, “Thank you for the toilet paper, Your flag’s meaningless to me, Look around, we’re all people, Who needa countries anyway?” George/Northern Ireland To MRR and its readers, I am writing from the conservative, right- wing, oppressive and fascist town of Mankato, MN. Since moving down here, having previ- ously been in Minneapolis and New York, I have been met with opposition, everything from the police to rednecks to lack of housing. Of couse, I fully understand that this happens everywhere in this governmental brai n-washed society. Still, even though the odds are against me, I find the need to fight even more against what I see. Since I have been here I have passed out literally hundreds of flyers on world issues such as animal rights, both to people who I know have an interest and many people I don’t even know. I write periodical letters to the yellow local newspaper to be published. I put out a fanzine of issues relevant to us as a people and world and make it available to the general public. I volunteer time at the Salva- tion Army. I pick up garbage for recycling. I do other things on a daily basis, but one of the most important things I do is inform and en- courage people to try to change what is de- stroying humanity. I can’t expect people to color their hair, wear a spiked jacket and get into Misery and Doom as I do, but we can relate on many other issues. We may not be able to enioy an Extreme Noise Terror album together, but we can share the pleasure of helping others and our environment. That’s what I feel will change the world more than anything else. And this letter is written as an encour- agement to all those who wonder if it’s all worth it. Change may or may not ever come, but trying meansfarmorethan nevertrying. Chaos, Michael Wood/ Mankato Jail/ Mankato, MN 56001 Hello, I wanted to update you on the record labeling legislation for Missouri that Tim re- orted on in issue #85. Rep. Jean Dixon’s bill as died in committee this year. Jean Dixon is up for reflection soon and a lot of people here hope to vote her out. Last year Jean Dixon tried, to stop a play (the Normal Heart) at SMSU. When some local college students stood up for their rights it resulted in one of the college student’s houses being burned to the ground. Nobody is saying Jean Dixon herself set the fire, but she did say the student was a devil worshipper and homosexual and got what he deserved. This resulted in an attempted recall that fell short but even her own party is running somebody against her now. Jean Dixon is using her position to im- pose her own morality on everybody else without regard to the concern of others. One thing this has accomplished is getting all the local record stores to stop selling punk rock music. Bill and Lisa Fuenhausen and Rick Niven own small independent stores in town and Jean Dixon has pretty much stopped them from stocking any underground music butthey will special order anything if you know what you want. Steve Harman/ 2129 W. Wall St./ Springfield, MO 65802-4276 Dear MRR, I can't let comments by Carl \"Psycho Sin” Casanova in his June NJ Scene Report go unchallenged. Carl tells bands to “boycott Maxwell's and Jersey Beat” because 'ihey don't support the scene.\" For ten years, Maxwell's has been out of the leading alternative music venues in the country. They treat bands right, everybody always gets paid, and they’re open to all kinds of music (it's all-ages too). The club devotes Thursday nights to local bands, even though those shows rarely draw well and perenially lose money for the club. Some bands that have played Maxwell'sin recent monthsinclude 7 Seconds, All, The Fiendz, American Stan- dard, Jawbox, Vision, Adrenalin O.D., Fugazi, Henry Rollins... Ask any of them if Maxwell's supports the scene ana I think yqu’ll find their answer is a very loud \"yes.” What is Maxwell's big crime? Could it be that they won't give Carl's band, Psycho Sin, a booking? Why single Maxwell's out, Carl? Nobody else in the Greater New York area will book your band either. Psycho Sin hasn't had a real club date in the area in years. I won't even dignify his remarks about Jersey Beat. I've been publishing for eight years, writing about NJ area bands, devoting large portions of the zine to demos, fanzines, and unsigned bands... Of course, I did write a few unkind words about Psycho Sin. Could this be why Carl thinks I don't \"support the scene?\" Finally, I would like a comment from MRR: Since when is it the policy of your magazine to condone the use of Scene Re- ports for the pursuit of petty personal vendet- tas? Don’t your readers deserve better than that? (The bands, clubs, and fanzines of NJ certainly deserve better scene reports than the shit Carl hands. I know MRR has an unflagging commitment to freedom of speech. But how aoout a little commitment to the truth? If either Casanova or MRR can back up his statement, I invite them to do so. If you can't stand behind your words, then they should never have been printed in the first place. Jim Testa, Jersey Beat/ 418 Gregory Ave/ Weehawken, NJ 07087 Dear Jim, Carl \"Psycho Sin\" has been writing small scene reports off and on, and when someone is that \"regular\", I don't intercede in what he or she writes, even if i don't agree with it. As far as his slag of you, I can only say that you have been active and honest forever in this scene, and have my utmost respect. Tim Dear Maximum RocknRoll, Please would you help me pass on some information — I would like to use your zine to spread the news about an eviction of a squat in Holland. This particular squat has helped many different bands in England have a chance to play in Holland, and it’s been a place to spend the night for many travelers coming from all over Europe. The W.N.C. in Groningen, Hol- land was until recently the largest squat in the north of Holland, housing up to 50 people as well as supplying cheap or free facilities. When the W.N.C. was squatted in No- vember 1 985. It was extremely poor repair, but a group of people made it into a place that people could live and have a cafe, concert hall, workshops, etc. But earlier this year a predecided court order gave permission for the W.N.C. to be evicted on May 28, during the week previous to eviction. The police started an intense psychological battle against squat- ters; fascist attacks were encouraged, then ignored. On the 26th of May, the squatters decided to come back. Barricades were built and a battle began with the police, starting around 4:15 a.m. the squatters held their ground, but by 9:30 a.m., police brought in tear gas, water cannons and mass reinforcements. Seeing the situation, the squatters retreated inside the W.N.C. By 7 a.m. Sunday, police decided to evict using a crane and container that placed police on the roof of the W.N.C., but the crane wasn’t working so they used a cutter to enter the back door instead. By 9:30 a.m. they had reached the 3rd floor, but the squatters were in the cellar. At 10:30 the squatters phoned the local radio and said they would give up peacefully to avoid police bringing tear qas inside the W.N.C. 132 people are still being held; most still haven’t been charged — they’re spread all over Holland, some in isolation, some moved constantly. At least one prisoner was beaten in a cell. There is a prisoner support group. The address is at the end of this article. Now please write or send donations. All these people need visits and publicity of their situation, so it only takes 15 minutes to write a letter and show your support and solidarity. Please contact prisoners’ support group at Steentilstratt 38/ Groningen, Holland. Thanks, Linda and Andy/ 1 7 St Thomas St/ Normenton, Derby DE3 8RF/UK A BONE TO PICK WITH THE WORLD SKENE!

With all the crazy bullshit that goes on this country every day, there's no way Til ever run out of things to write about. For instance, I just read in Newsweek thatTrumpty Dumpty had a great fall. Of course, everybody gets a big old sadistic kick out of it, which they should ^use let's face it, he's the most offensive, smarmy piece of dung to stroll the face of the earth since Needermeyer in Animal House, but even poor Needermeyer with his face that looked like it was just beggin' to be spit in was simply the figment of some overpaid writers imagination, but the sickest thing about the Trumpster is that the people who are really skanking on his grave are tin same suckers that paid $7.95 for his self-con gratulatory book. Hie Art Of The Deal. Look: Rke Donny ain't much of an artist but the only reason his former admirers are giving him such a hard time is cause they want so desperately to take his place. People often tell me Fm a nega- tive, cynical stinker. I guess it's true. I mean I think people are basically fucking sick. But sickness and disease don t just happen, they have to be created and/or passed on. The name of this disease is greed (artifi- cial happiness) and every single one of you sad, sad pukes has got it just as bad as Mr. Trump! Money, fucking money everywhere I turn. Ev- erybody hates it but they still play the game 'cause brother, the name of the game is \"happi- we all inhabit. and cherish. Advertising is the main form of brainwashing that takes place in the world today. Never mind all the subliminal messages ads pump into your unsuspecting brain, let's talk about the most obvious ana immediate effects. You're watching TV, probably one of those ridiculous horseshit sitcoms where prob- lems are always worked out in time for the last commercial break. An ad comes on (take your pick, it really doesn't matter). Take a look at what's being sold, how it's packaged and how it's advertised. What is being sold is not the product, but what the product is going to do for you. Listen to the words. BUY ALPO, YOUR DOG WILL LOVE IT. TRY NEW LEMON FRESH PINE-SOL! They're ordering you to buy their shit. There are many different tactics, the most obvious one being the association be- tween whatever shit they're trying to shove down your throat and flawless fuckable babes and studs who are without a doubt gonna drop to their knees and start licking and sucking the second you pop a Miller. Another good one is the humor angle. If you're laughing while you're watching the commercial, chances are you're f onna be laughing while you're driving your rand new Ford Probe down Hollywood Bou- levard (that is until the hunk of shit breaks down and you've gotta take it into the shop since they've made it next to impossible for the average joe to do even the most minor work on their car). When you see these ads on TV, you don't believe it for a second. You dismiss with a wave of the hand and a chuckle but you still buy it! It's all in the subconscious. The ad com- panies know damn well that nobody's gonna buy into what the commercial appears to be. That's why they blow shit out of proportion and make it so ridiculous, so that even Frank and Mary Kettlchead of South Dipshit, Ne- braska can feel superior and thus unaffected. But they still buy it, because somewhere in the not-so-deep recesses of their puny little minds lies the realization that perhaps if they used the socially correct products they wouldn't fuck like turtles on quaaludes anymore. It's brainwashing pure and simple, and the sickest thing about it is that everybody knows it and doesn't give a rat's ass that they're being bamboozled. You've worked all day just to be able to continue your miserable existence and even if you wanted to, you just don't have the energy to question the almighty authority of the putrid little box in your living room. I could go on for hours about this, about how most large advertising firms hire teams of psychiatrists to figure out now to get people to buy their shit, ana how many companies use subject, most recently I taped 36 hours of televi- sion commercials and transcribed them. Try it out, tape the first five commercials you see and then go back and write down the monologue. You'll be truly amazed at what insanity the advertisers spew and you rarely even realize it! Ok, I'm definitely getting too far into left wing territory here ana I better veer off the path right now or Tim might actually start liking wnat I write. My main concern at the moment centers on the use of advertising in punk rock, what it's created and how it works. Listen up and when I'm done, if you don't agree that Jello Biafra is Donald Trump's evil twin. I'll eat my hat. The obvious targets (I hate the obvious) are labels like Slash ana Enigma for their ties to major corporations. Make no mistake, these folks are in it for the quick cash and they'd be the first ones to admit it. Their attitude towards advertising is simple. Put out music by a band that's either already been around for a while and proved themselves (in terms of sales) or has band members that were in a famous band at some point. Occasionally they'll take on an unknown in which case, if it doesn't take off i mmediately, they won't ad vertise and just chalk it up as a tax write-off. Speaking of which, it's a fact lack, that many 'Independent distribu- tors have connections with the mafia and exist either A: to lose money for tax purposes or B: launder illegally obtained money or C: (usu- ally) both. Anyway, the big labels aren't the main concern, since you're all probably pretty hip to the scam already. But what about the smaller guys? I'm talking Homestead, SST, AltemativeTentacles,Caroline,etc.,whoaren't owned by major corporations but conduct their business in basically the same way. And it even goes down to the really small labels and most of the time, all the way down to the \"D.I.Y.\" bands who put out their own records. They all adver- tise and advertising is the art of getting some- one to buy something that they had no inten- tion of buying in the first place. Your band puts a record out. The abso- lute first thingyou wanna do is to zip a coupla copies over to MRR because A: A good review in MRR means many distributors will take vour record even if they've never heard it, and B: More people buy records through mail order ads seen in MRR than probably all other fanzines in the world combined. MRR has loyal readers. It comes out on time every month and features (for the most part) intelligent writing and the latest gossip about what's happening in nkland. The second thing a band does is to send out copies to other fanzines (along with ads) in hopes that total saturation of the market will put them a couple of notches above the 2500 other records that came out that month. Then it's onto the distributors and even though /ou know they're probably gonna rip your stupid ass off, if your record is in stores all over the country, it gives your band a little edge and certainly a small amount of prestige. After the initial onslaught, you go on tour and even though hardly anybody's ever heard your band, almost everybody will have heard of you so you'll at least be able to survive on the road and hopefully as time passes, you'll hit it big. How do I know all this? 'Cause I was in a band for three years that did it and was actually some- what successful at it (relatively speaking). I've also worked with 2 different independent record labels for the past 2 years and believe me, once you getinvolved, it's not that hard to figure out the scams. One great scam a lot of record labels seem to be pulling lately is announcing a record's release before it's even been pressed. That way, the mail orders start flocking in, thus enabling the company to pay for the pressing! Another truly sickening scam is the colored vinyl/lim- itea edition record thing. By putting your records on colored vinyland/or pressing a limited amount of them, you are ensuring that even the lousiest record m the world win sell. You can be pretty sure that if a label is putting out a record on colored vinyl or doing a limited pressing it's because they have no confidence that it's a good record. But still it sells, and still you suckers flock like mangy sheep. My ex- band put out a crappy 7” disc with mostly crummy songs, out of tune instruments, shitty production and even shittier mastering but it was a limited edition record and there are fools out there today paying 25 bucks for the piece of What really disturbs me about this whole consumer-oriented punk society is the way certain people, record labels and bands would have you think that what they are doing is somehow different from what Warner Bros, and Maxwell House and Stay free Tamp find five major difrc ou can ons are erences doing. If y< between the way SST does their business and the way A&M does theirs, you'll win a free dream date with Martin Sprouse at Howard's House of Steak in East Oakland. And what about your beloved savior Jello Biafra? Does anybody really believe that this shyster is even slightly interested in creating a real alternative to GBS? Christ, the only difference is that he wants his power base to be smaller and cen- tered more on him. Ian and Co. may have nobler intentions but they're apparently blinded to the fact that their audience is turned onto them because they've become increasingly more accessible. Now these \"fans'\" pathetic Top 40 lives have been enlightened by \"alternative\" music but so what? It's still a consumer-ori- ented game, and one they know so well al- ready. Change your t-shirt and a few of your words and actions and you too can fit in. The roblem is the \"scene\" changed in order to get heir oh-so-important \"message\" out. But by making it more accessible ( i.e. college radio, MTV, etc.), the power was taken out and the \"message\" got changed by association. Jello can get on Tv and raise everbody's conscious- ness but there's still gonna be a goddamm Skittles commercial at the break, then more hip talk about hot, happening things, thus reduc- ing Mr. JellyBelly to yet another wacky, ec- centric, heck-raising liberal with \"revolution- ary\" ideas that mean to the average viewer as much as the MILLI VANILLI video that follows his thirty second spot does. Biafra becomes a £ really changed except the way, wasn't that snivelling media whore screaming \"MTV GET OFF THE AIR\" a few short years ago??? Wanna be alternative? Don't play the game. Pussies. Let's see the balls ( dear ben, must y< li ;ame. Pussies.
