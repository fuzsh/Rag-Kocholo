        "text": "03. How to Identify Asbestos\n\nHow to Identify Asbestos in the Home\n\nIdentifying asbestos-containing materials with the naked eye is difficult. However, people can look for potential signs of asbestos in homes.\n\nHomes built before the 1980s likely have asbestos in them. For instance, if these homes have popcorn ceilings or vinyl flooring, they may contain asbestos. A simple rule is the newer a home is, the less likely it has asbestos materials. Homes built before the 1980s are likely to contain the mineral somewhere.\n\nIn any case, homeowners should never touch any suspected asbestos in their house. Instead, a trained asbestos professional should inspect and manage potential asbestos. Proper handling of the mineral can help avoid asbestos exposure.\n\nVisual Clues to Help Identify Asbestos in Houses\n\nHomeowners may find visual clues for recognizing asbestos in their homes. They won’t be able to see asbestos itself because the mineral consists of microscopic fibers. However, the age of the building and the presence of certain materials may suggest that asbestos is in the home.\n\nAnother complication to visually finding asbestos is the different types of asbestos that may have been used. These asbestos types can vary in color and appearance. But asbestos-containing products may not have visible asbestos fibers. In many cases, asbestos was used as a component in the product, making it impossible to see asbestos fibers. Still, what are some visual signs of asbestos in a house?\n\nHomeowners should remember that asbestos is a microscopic fiber that becomes airborne after being disturbed. If homeowners suspect potential asbestos in their home, they should hire professionals to inspect materials and recommend next steps.\n\nCheck Leftover Materials for Labels Identifying Asbestos\n\nLeftover materials stored in a house may have asbestos in them. Product packaging may help identify if they contain asbestos.\n\nFor example, spare vinyl floor tiles may have a stamp on the box or the back of the tiles stating they contain asbestos. These products came in a variety of shapes and sizes, and not all were made with asbestos. A date included on the packaging may also indicate that they were manufactured during the height of asbestos use (1930s – 1970s).\n\nHandling any leftover materials may carry asbestos exposure risks. Homeowners should only inspect the outside of the packaging for a label. If there are no packages, it is best to assume any flooring or other construction materials installed before 1980 contain the mineral. Homeowners should treat these materials with caution.\n\nWhile visual clues like labels can suggest the presence of asbestos in the home, it is not a foolproof method to identify asbestos. Only asbestos abatement professionals can properly test for asbestos and safely handle any asbestos materials.\n\n04. Testing for Asbestos\n\nHow Do I Know if My House Has Asbestos?\n\nAsbestos testing is the only way to definitively know if asbestos is present. Hiring an asbestos abatement professional is the safest way to test for asbestos. Anyone who owns or plans to buy a house built before the 1980s may want to have a home asbestos test performed, especially if they plan to remodel.\n\nA licensed asbestos inspector can test for asbestos while minimizing the risk of exposure. They will also recommend next steps for addressing any asbestos in the home. Options may include leaving it undisturbed, removing it or encapsulating it. Encapsulating asbestos involves keeping it in place and sealing it with a protective barrier.\n\nHome asbestos test kits are available but they are not recommended or safe. Homeowners could expose themselves and anyone in the home by using home asbestos tests. Many experts recommend leaving asbestos testing to the professionals. They have the needed training to safely test for asbestos and handle next steps, like removal, to prevent exposure.\n\nHow Much Does Professional Asbestos Testing Cost?\n\nThe cost of professional asbestos testing varies. The number of samples needed, type of testing completed on the samples and part of the country can all impact cost. According to data from Essel Environment, the national average for basic asbestos testing is $600.\n\nComprehensive home asbestos testing will cost more, but it is more in-depth. Comprehensive asbestos tests include:\n\nAir quality testing\n\nAsbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) inspection\n\nInitial test and sampling\n\nFull inspection after asbestos is detected\n\nHomeowners may consider having asbestos testing done before conducting any renovations or home projects. The cost of comprehensive testing may be worth the peace of mind for knowing that dangerous exposure could be avoided.\n\nComprehensive testing costs can vary depending on location. These examples can help homeowners understand the cost variations.\n\nOther common ways for asbestos products to be disturbed include:\n\nA fire or natural disaster\n\nFlooding or water damage\n\nMaintenance projects\n\nAsbestos exposure can occur anywhere in the house.\n\nCommon places where asbestos is found in homes include:\n\nAttics\n\nBasements\n\nCeilings\n\nCrawl spaces\n\nFloors\n\nRoofs\n\nWalls\n\nAsbestos in Attics\n\nAttic insulation is a common location for asbestos in houses. Vermiculite attic insulation is a specific and notorious type of insulation that may contain asbestos. Vermiculite insulation looks like small pebbles on the floor of the attic. Vermiculite attic insulation, such as Zonolite insulation, has well-documented ties to asbestos contamination.\n\nThe EPA suggests up to 70% of the vermiculite sold in the United States between 1919 and 1990 came from Libby, Montana. Much of it may have been contaminated with asbestos.\n\nIf a home has vermiculite insulation, homeowners should be careful not to disturb it. They should call an asbestos abatement professional to handle asbestos testing and removal. Because so much of the vermiculite came from Libby, homeowners should assume any vermiculite insulation contains asbestos.\n\nAsbestos in Walls of Homes\n\nHomes built before the 1980s may have wallboards and textures that contain asbestos. Wallboards go by many different names, like drywall, gypsum board or sheetrock. During the manufacturing process, asbestos was mixed with other materials and sandwiched between two sheets of paper. Asbestos in walls can be disturbed when drilling through them or if the outer paper is damaged.\n\nAsbestos cement sheets were also sometimes used for interior walls. On the outside of older homes, these sheets were used for roofing and siding. Over time, these materials can start wearing out, exposing residents to asbestos.\n\nIf a homeowner wants to remodel or needs to do maintenance, they should take precautions before starting on any work in homes built before the 1980s. A licensed asbestos abatement company should first perform a professional asbestos home test.\n\nAsbestos in Popcorn Ceilings and Vinyl Tiles\n\nPopcorn ceilings and vinyl tile floors were popular starting in the 1940s. Both, however, may have asbestos in them.\n\nBuilders liked popcorn ceilings because they could hide imperfections and provided acoustical insulation. These types of ceilings could have 1% – 10% asbestos content. As they age and break down, pieces can flake off and become airborne.\n\nVinyl tiles provide an easy-to-maintain floor option. They come in a variety of colors and patterns. During the manufacturing process, the vinyl may have been fused with asbestos. The adhesive used to glue the tile down may also have asbestos. If homeowners renovate or repair flooring themselves, they face exposure risks.\n\nAn asbestos abatement professional will be able to test for asbestos and safely remove contaminated materials.\n\n06. How to Handle Asbestos in Homes\n\nWhat to Do if You Have Asbestos in Your Home\n\nIf a homeowner believes their home has asbestos materials, they should contact an asbestos abatement company to conduct a professional home asbestos test. If the home has asbestos, the homeowner may need to hire a contractor to remove it.\n\nIn general, asbestos materials are considered relatively safe when they are in good condition and there are no signs of damage. If the material is damaged or worn, a professional may suggest removing or encapsulating the product.\n\nAt no point should a homeowner attempt to remove asbestos on their own.\n\nAccording to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there is no safe level of asbestos exposure. Improper asbestos handling could release fibers into the air, creating a health hazard.\n\nAsbestos Safety Dos and Don’ts\n\nAsbestos in homes can be very dangerous if disturbed or damaged. Homeowners should take certain steps if they suspect their homes have asbestos.\n\nWhy You Shouldn’t Use an Asbestos Home Test Kit\n\nAsbestos materials are dangerous any time fibers are airborne. Home asbestos tests performed by homeowners may pose a greater health hazard than undisturbed asbestos.\n\nAt-home asbestos test kits can put homeowners and their families at risk of dangerous exposure. To collect samples for testing, the suspected hazardous materials must be disturbed. This can cause fibers to become airborne. As such, homeowners are encouraged to avoid at-home asbestos test kits.\n\nIf homeowners use an at-home asbestos test kit, they should follow specific safety guidelines.\n\nAt first, home asbestos test kits may seem more economical than hiring a professional. But the costs of asbestos-related diseases are far greater.\n\n07. Actions to Protect Homeowners\n\nMinimizing Asbestos Exposure Risks in the Home\n\nTaking steps to minimize asbestos exposure risks at home is the best course of action homeowners can take to protect themselves and their families.\n\nHomeowners should not attempt to remove asbestos from their homes on their own. Without proper handling and safety precautions, removing asbestos can cause exposure and lead to illness. It is important to hire a trained professional, so the asbestos materials can be handled and disposed of properly.\n\nMany cities and states have regulations in place for the proper disposal of asbestos and materials containing asbestos. It is important to understand these asbestos regulations to protect anyone in the home, workers and neighbors from exposure."
