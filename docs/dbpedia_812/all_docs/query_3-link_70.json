The Minute extends 2012’s Minute 319 that gave Mexico greater flexibility in managing its Colorado River allotment.

Minute 323 dedicates 210,000 acre-feet of water over nine years for environmental restoration work in the Colorado River Delta.\n\n2018 Bureau of Reclamation releases Tribal Water Study. It describes how tribal water use fits into the overall picture of Colorado River management, how future development of tribal water resources will alter river operations (including others using water to which a tribe may hold legal title) and how future development of tribal water rights will affect Basin operations.\n\n2019 President Trump signs the Drought Contingency Plan. The DCP commits the seven Colorado River Basin states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — to a plan centered on the idea that all water users, not just those with junior water rights, have a stake in keeping the system whole by taking voluntary reductions on their Colorado River deliveries.\n\n2021 With the water level in Lake Mead projected to reach 1,066 feet above sea level by Jan. 1, 2022, the first-ever shortage declaration was triggered, requiring Arizona, Nevada and the country of Mexico to reduce their take of the river in 2022. California, with the largest share of the river, was not required to cut back, but could face reductions if Lake Mead’s water level drops further."
