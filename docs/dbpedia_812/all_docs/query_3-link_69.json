        "text": "Metropolitan\n\nRegional Testing\n\nMetropolitan’s service area is expansive. It spans parts of six counties and 5,200 square miles. Our closest routine sample location is less than a mile from the La Verne Water Quality Lab, with the furthest 250 miles away. Sample collectors travel more than 150,000 miles each year by car and plane to bring samples in for analysis. Staff rely on nearly 500 different types of analytical equipment and use about 150 methods to evaluate samples. In a given year, about 250,000 water quality test results are generated.\n\nOur monitoring also relies on human senses. More than 40 years ago, Metropolitan introduced the idea of Flavor Profile Analysis for water. Since then, the practice has been adopted by drinking water agencies worldwide and is regarded as one of the most reliable early warning systems gauged by drinking water aesthetics. Metropolitan’s highly trained team meets several times a week to taste and smell samples from throughout our distribution system. This focus has resulted in many awards in international and regional water tasting competitions.\n\nAs water enters the treatment plant, the first step is disinfection and, depending on the source water quality, it may be necessary to add various chemicals to optimize this process. Water is disinfected using ozone primarily, which kills microorganisms, including pathogens such as viruses and protozoa like Cryptosporidium and Giardia.\n\nAs water flows through ozone contactors, hydrogen peroxide may be added for additional taste and odor control. If there are any interruptions in the ozone process, chlorine also can be used as a back-up disinfectant and is readily available.\n\nThe second step in the treatment process is coagulation, where chemical coagulants such as alum (aluminum sulfate) and polymer are injected into the water and blended rapidly using flash jet mixers.\n\nThe coagulants help particles stick together, making larger particles that are more easily removed. Water then flows into the mixing and settling basins, where large mechanical mixers or flocculators gently agitate the water.\n\nThe third step is flocculation where water further mixes with the coagulant chemicals added in the previous step, allowing time for larger suspended particles in the water to bind together and form “floc.”\n\nSedimentation is the fourth step. In this process, the floc particles, which are much heavier than the surrounding water, settle to the bottom of the basin, forming a layer of material that is later removed. In the fifth step of filtration, a filter aid removes particles from the settled water in the sedimentation basins.\n\nFilters consist of layers of anthracite coal, sand and gravel filter media. As water passes, the filters remove smaller particles from the water as well as larger particles that did not settle during the sedimentation process.\n\nOnce the treatment process is completed, chlorine and ammonia are added to the water to form chloramines and maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system. This ensures water quality is maintained as supplies travel through the system. Caustic soda also is added as a corrosion control measure to adjust the pH level of the water and protect pipes and plumbing fixtures. And Fluoride is added to help prevent dental caries as recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Treated water is temporarily stored in finished water reservoirs and distributed to member agency connections.\n\nResponding to Water Quality Challenges & Concerns\n\nPFAS (Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)\n\nFor decades, manufacturers have widely used chemicals known as PFAS in everyday industrial and household products such as firefighting foam, clothing, non-stick cookware, personal care products and paints. Known for their resistance to heat, oils, stains and water, these chemicals are a growing concern because of their possible health effects in high concentrations. Because they don’t easily break down, they’re often referred to as “forever chemicals.”\n\nThe family of PFAS includes more than 12,000 chemicals, some of which have been found in water supplies across the country. Since 2013, Metropolitan has monitored for PFAS, including the two most common and most studied PFAS – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Metropolitan has infrequently detected four PFA substances at low concentrations just above the detection level, including one-time detecting very low levels of PFOS in a source water lake that we use infrequently. In March 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced proposed drinking water standards for six PFAS.\n\nMetropolitan continues to ensure the region has a safe drinking water supply by voluntarily monitoring our source and treated waters for PFAS and supporting our member agencies as they assess whether PFOA and/or PFOS are present in their supplies. Metropolitan is prepared to handle any increased demands for imported water that may result from the loss of affected local supplies.\n\nBelow are resources aimed at helping the public understanding of PFAS: a fact sheet as well as a list of frequently asked questions and answers.\n\nSource Water Protection\n\nProtecting water quality starts at the source. This requires careful management of watersheds. Metropolitan imports water from two sources — the Colorado River through the Colorado River Aqueduct, which we own and operate, and Northern California via the State Water Project. Each source has its individual challenges from constituents that enter the water. Some are naturally produced from the environment, and others are sourced from cities and farms. Some constituents such as total organic carbon and bromide in source waters can potentially form harmful contaminants when in contact with disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone during the disinfection process. Certain industrial processes, like dry cleaning, fireworks and rocket fuel manufacturing, have left constituents in the environment. So has the use of certain fertilizers and pesticides. Many of these chemicals have since been banned from use. When these chemicals make their way into California’s water supplies, specialized treatment is required, or the supplies must be abandoned.\n\nMetropolitan partners with state and local water agencies in supporting programs that protect water at its source and on its path to treatment. For example, we partner with Central Arizona Project and Southern Nevada Water Authority on initiatives to address water quality challenges on the Colorado River, including salinity, invasive species and industrial contaminants, as part of the Lower Colorado River Water Quality Partnership. Metropolitan also provides funding for projects to clean up groundwater contamination.\n\nWhen Metropolitan first began delivering desalted Colorado River water to Southern California cities in 1941, the “softened” water was touted for its ability to reduce laundry suds. Today, salinity control remains a high priority. Colorado River water has the highest level of salinity of all of Metropolitan’s sources of supply (averaging approximately 625 mg/L since 1976). Metropolitan’s board in 1999 approved a Salinity Management Policy that set of goal of reaching salinity concentrations in delivered water of less than 500 mg/L when hydrological conditions allow.\n\nOne of the reasons the river is so salty is because many of the salts are indigenous and date to prehistoric marine environments that left deposits of saline sediments. Salts erode easily, dissolve and get transported in the river system. Metropolitan works with the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum, an organization of the seven Colorado River Basin states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming to coordinate ways to prevent salts from moving into the river system. Measures include better irrigation practices and rangeland management. Since the 1970s, the salt load has been reduced by 20 percent.\n\nThe start of State Water Project deliveries to Southern California in the 1970s gave Metropolitan an additional tool of blending less salty (250 to 325 mg/L) SWP supplies with Colorado River water. Like the Colorado River, SWP salinity can vary greatly depending on hydrologic conditions.\n\nHigh salinity levels can also occur in groundwater (referred to as brackish water). The desalination of brackish groundwater and other local supplies enhances the continued supply reliability of the region by maximizing local groundwater resources. For this reason, since 1991 Metropolitan funding has helped recover a little more than 1 million acre-feet of groundwater, cleansing it of salts, metals, nitrates, viruses and bacteria and creating another source of water that lessens our dependence on imported supplies.\n\nIn addition to desalinating brackish groundwater, Metropolitan has explored the development of seawater desalination since the 1950s. Since 2014, we have offered financial incentives as part of the Local Resources Program.\n\nFrom the first discovery of quagga mussels in Lake Mead in January 2007 and their subsequent spread into parts of Metropolitan’s water system, the district has devoted countless hours and tens of millions of dollars toward containing and managing the invasive pest. Spread by commercial ships and inadequately cleaned and dried recreational boats, quagga and zebra mussels had already wreaked havoc in other parts of the country before arriving in the west.\n\nThe mussels rapidly reproduce, clogging pipes, water pumps and siphons, and growing on the walls of canals and other submerged infrastructure impeding flow. Soon after their discovery in Lake Mead, Metropolitan created a Quagga Mussel Control Plan.\n\nCrews constructed continuous chlorination facilities at Copper Basin Reservoir, Lake Mathews and Lake Skinner, all of which take Colorado River water and, therefore, have quagga mussels. During Metropolitan’s yearly Colorado River Aqueduct shutdowns, Metropolitan crews dry up (desiccate) quagga mussels and remove them from the system, clean tunnels, and chlorinate strategic sites (sometimes using a mobile chlorinator). Divers perform underwater maintenance, stripping layers of quagga mussels from intake structures.\n\nRoutine inspections have demonstrated that the combined use of chlorine and regularly scheduled shutdowns effectively control mussel infestation along the length of the CRA and downstream systems.\n\nWe have been able to avoid infestation at our Diamond Valley Lake storage reservoir because CRA deliveries into the reservoir stopped prior to the arrival of quagga mussels in our CRA system in 2007. Our success also is due to a rigorous boater education and inspection campaign that enlists our Diamond Valley Lake marina operators to enforce launch requirements for visiting boats, and interview boaters to ensure requirements listed here have been followed. Recently, quagga mussels have been found in the State Water Project system at Pyramid and Castaic Lakes.\n\nPartnership For Safe Drinking Water\n\nA voluntary effort by six of the nation’s most prominent drinking water organizations, the Partnership for Safe Water offers tools that allow operators, managers and administrators to improve water quality beyond proposed regulatory levels.\n\nSince Metropolitan joined the partnership in 1996, all of our water treatment plants and distribution system have received awards under the program. Our Diemer, Jensen and Weymouth plants have been honored for achieving the highest possible levels of individual filter turbidity performance, while Metropolitan’s treated water distribution system has achieved the highest level of optimization and demonstrated commitment to continuous improvement."
