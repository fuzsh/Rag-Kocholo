        "text": "Today, the term \"Ivy League\" connotes prestige, tradition, and power. Composed of academic powerhouses like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Columbia, the Ivies seem to dominate U.S. higher education. But what about other schools with excellent reputations that don't have the Ivy League label?\n\nIt's likely no surprise that Ivy League-level colleges and universities would borrow a little \"ivy\" to use in their own names. These similarly prestigious groups of institutions include public schools, small liberal arts colleges, and other lesser-known, top-tier schools.\n\nWhat Are the Public Ivies?\n\nThe Public Ivies offer an Ivy League education at a public university price, according to Richard Moll, who coined the term in his 1985 book \"The Public Ivys.\"\n\nMoll's list of Public Ivies included 15 schools, including William & Mary, UC Berkeley, the University of Michigan, UCLA, and the University of Virginia. Moll also named nine runners-up, which, to him, offered near-Ivy-level education but weren't quite as strong.\n\nThe 2001 book \"Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning\" expanded the Public Ivy schools list to 30 public universities, divided by region (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest, and West). Schools on this list include Indiana University, Bloomington, the University of Georgia, and the University of Washington.\n\nMost Public Ivies are a lot larger than the Ivy League schools. While undergraduate enrollment at the eight Ivies averages around 8,500 students, many Public Ivies boast far bigger undergraduate classes. Michigan and UCLA, for example, each enroll over 31,000 undergrads.\n\nThe Public Ivies also report smaller endowments than the Ivies — and these endowments must stretch further because of their larger student bodies. Although Michigan has a larger university endowment than Columbia, the public school simply can't match a real Ivy in terms of financial aid for students.\n\nThe Public Ivies do, however, offer one huge advantage over the Ivies: lower tuition rates. While every Ivy League school charges more than $50,000 in annual tuition and fees, many of the Public Ivies cost around just $10,000 per year for in-state students.\n\nPopular Online Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nWhat Are the Little Ivies?\n\nThe \"Little Ivies,\" which are private liberal arts colleges, offer academic rigor and selective admissions similar to the Ivies and Public Ivies.\n\nThe Little Ivies include all the schools of the New England Small College Athletic Conference and several schools outside New England. Elite liberal arts institutions, like Amherst College, Vassar College, and Tufts University, typically appear on Little Ivies lists.\n\nThe Little Ivies often focus exclusively on undergraduate education. While the Ivy League and Public Ivies offer numerous graduate programs, many of the Little Ivies only offer undergraduate degrees.\n\nWhat Are the Hidden Ivies?\n\nIn a 2000 book, education experts Howard and Matthew Greene — the same duo who expanded Moll's list of Public Ivies — proposed the idea of the \"Hidden Ivies.\" These 63 highly selective colleges offer a premier liberal arts education.\n\nThe Hidden Ivies include many small colleges, such as Davidson College, Pomona College, and Oberlin College, as well as some large research universities, like Georgetown University, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Southern California.\n\nWhat Does Ivy Plus Mean?\n\nThe Ivies aren't the only renowned private schools that consistently rank in the top 20. Many use the phrase Ivy Plus to refer to both the Ivies and a handful of similarly prestigious schools, such as Stanford, MIT, the University of Chicago, and Duke. Some lists, however, also count Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, and Caltech among the Ivy Plus schools.\n\nLike the Ivies, these institutions are costly and highly selective, usually admitting fewer than 10% of applicants. They also offer prestigious alumni networks, large endowments, and lively traditions.\n\nWhat Are the New Ivies?\n\nIn 2006, Newsweek coined the phrase \"New Ivies.\" These schools rank high in academics and faculty, even if they don't reach the endowment size or elite status of the Ivies. Newsweek's list includes both public and private schools, such as Carnegie Mellon, UNC-Chapel Hill, Emory, and Notre Dame.\n\nUnlike the Ivies, which all lay within just a few hundred miles of one another, the New Ivies stretch across the country, from the Claremont Colleges in California to Manhattan's NYU.\n\nWhat Are the Black Ivies?\n\nEliciting comparisons to the Ivy League, the most elite historically Black colleges and universities are often called the \"Black Ivies.\" These schools — including Howard University, Fisk University, Morehouse College, Tuskegee University, and Hampton University — were first singled out in Barnard psychology professor Jacqueline Fleming's 1984 book \"Blacks in Colleges.\"\n\nWhat Are the Southern Ivies?\n\nWhen eight elite Northeastern universities joined the Ivy League athletic conference in 1954, Southern universities attempted to establish a rival league: the Magnolia Conference. Made up of schools like Vanderbilt, Emory, Rice, Duke, and Tulane, the Magnolia Conference was meant to compete with the Ivy League in more than just sports.\n\nThough the athletic conference never took off, these prestigious Southern schools are still sometimes dubbed the \"Southern Ivies.\"\n\nWhat Are the Seven Sisters?\n\nNearly all of the Ivy League schools historically excluded women. Columbia didn't start admitting female students until 1983, and only Cornell admitted women from its founding in 1865. As a result, the seven (originally) men-only Ivies offered sister institutions for women. These schools, which were founded in the 19th century, were meant to educate the sisters of men at the Ivies.\n\nThe \"Seven Sisters,\" as the institutions are known, include Vassar, Barnard (Columbia's sister institute), and Radcliffe College, which merged with Harvard in 1977. Today, Vassar admits both men and women, but the remaining Sisters operate as private women's colleges.\n\nThe Ivy League vs. the Almost-Ivies\n\nThe Ivy League schools don't have a monopoly on higher education. The Public Ivies, the Little Ivies, and many other non-Ivy schools can offer something the Ivy League can't. For example, the Public Ivies provide a big-school feel, while the Little Ivies emphasize even smaller student bodies than Dartmouth, the smallest Ivy League school.\n\nThe point is that anyone can get a good education at many of the non-Ivies. While Malia Obama chose to attend Harvard, her sister, Sasha, opted for the University of Michigan. Your education is ultimately what you make of it.\n\nNote: The insights on this page were reviewed by an independent third party compensated for their time by BestColleges.
