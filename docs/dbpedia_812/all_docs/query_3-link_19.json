        "text": "NOTICES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Internationaal Trade Administration [C-580-402] Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Oil Country Tubular Goods From Korea Wednesday, November 28, 1984 *46776 AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: We determine that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty law are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of oil country tubular goods. The net subsidy is 0.53 percent ad valorem. We have notified the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determination. We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of oil country tubular goods from Korea that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after September 12, 1984, and to require a cash deposit or bond on entries of these products in the amount equal to the net subsidy. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 28, 1984. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Tillman, Rick Herring, or Tom Bombelles of the Office of Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 377-1785; 377-0187; or 377-3174. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Final Determination Based upon our investigation, we determine that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of oil country tubular goods. For purposes of this investigation, the following programs are found to confer subsidies: Short-term Export Financing under the Export Financing Regulations; Accelerated Depreciation under Article 25 of the \"Act Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reduction and Exemption\"; and Tax Incentives for Exporters under Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the \"Act Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reduction and Exemption.\" We determine the net subsidy to be 0.53 percent ad valorem. Case History On June 12, 1984, we received a petition from the Lone Star Steel Company of Dallas, Texas, and the CF&I Steel Corporation of Pueblo, Colorado, on behalf of the U.S. industry producing oil country tubular goods. In compliance with the filing requirements of section 355.26 of our regulations (19 CFR 355.26), the petition alleges that manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of oil country tubular goods receive, directly or indirectly, benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Act, and that these imports are materially injuring or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. We found taht the petition contained sufficient grounds upon which to initiate a countervailing duty investigation, and on July 3, 1984, we initiated such an investigation (49 FR 28291). We stated that we expected to issue a preliminary determination by September 6, 1984. On August 3, 1984, the petition was amended and the LTV Steel Company of Cleveland, Ohio became co-petitioner. On July 23, 1984, United States Steel Corporation (U.S. Steel) entered an appearance to become a party to this proceeding. Since Korea is a \"country under the Agreement\" within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, an injury determination is required for this investigation. Therefore, we notified the ITC of our initiation. On August 8, 1984, the ITC published in the Federal Register their preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that these imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry (49 FR 31782). We presented questionnaires concerning the allegations to the government of Korea in Washington, D.C., on July 13, July 23 and August 20, 1984. On August 17, August 20, August 21 and August 30, 1984, we received responses to these questionnaires. On July 18 and August 20, petitioners presented additional information concerning the alleged subsidies and also alleged new subsidies. On July 9, August 31, and September 5, U.S. Steel presented additional information concerning the alleged subsidies and also alleged new subsidies. On September 12, 1984, we published our preliminary determination that benefits constituting subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty law were being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of oil country tubular goods (49 FR 35836). At the request of both petitioners and respondents, we held a hearing on November 1, 1984, to allow the parties an opportunity to address the issues arising in the investigation. Both petitioners, respondents, and other interested parties filed briefs before and after the hearing on these issues. They also filed briefs commenting on our verification. In its pre-hearing brief filed on October 23, 1984, U.S. Steel made additional allegations of benefits received by manufacturers and exporters of OCTG. These allegations were (1) Regional Tax Incentives, (2) Tax incentives for Exporters, and (3) Special Foreign Exchange Loan System. Since these allegations were made after our preliminary determination and after the Commerce verification team returned from Korea, the allegations were made too late to be considered in this investigation. These additional allegations will be given consideration in the section 751 administrative review of the order, if an order is issued. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are oil country tubular goods (OCTG), which are hollow steel products of circular cross-section intended for use in the drilling of oil or gas. These products include oil well casing, tubing, and drill pipe of carbon or alloy steel, whether welded or seamless, manufactured to either American Petroleum Institute (API) or proprietary specifications. This investigation covers both finished and unfinished oil country tubular goods. The provisions of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, Annotated (TSUSA) covering all steel pipe and tube, including oil country tubular goods, were changed as of April 1, 1984. We have reviewed the classification of *46777 steel pipe and tube by the U.S. Customs Service and determined that our original listing of the products subject to this investigation should be amended. As a result of the changes mentioned above, oil country tubular goods now comprise TSUSA item numbers 610.3216, 610.3219, 610.3233, 610.3242, 610.3243, 610.3249, 610.3252, 610.3254, 610.3256, 610.3258, 610.3262, 610.3264, 610.3721, 610.3722, 610.3751, 610.3925, 610.3935, 610.4025, 610.4035, 610.4225, 610.4235, 610.4325, 610.4335, 610.4942, 610.4944, 610.4946, 610.4954, 610.4955, 610.4956, 610.4957, 610.4966, 610.4967, 610.4968, 610.4969, 610.4970, 610.5221, 610.5222, 610.5226, 610.5234, 610.5240, 610.5242, 610.5243, and 610.5244. There are five Korean producers of the subject merchandise which exported to the United States during the period for which we are measuring subsidization: Hyundai Pipe Company (Hyundai Pipe). Korea Steel Pipe Company (Korea Steel). Pusan Steel Pipe Company (Pusan). DongJin Steel Company (DongJin), and Union Steel Manufacturing Company (Union). In addition, there are five trading companies which exported the subject merchandise to the United States during the period for which we are measuring subsidization. The trading companies are the Hyundai Corporation, Kukje-ICC Corporation, Sunkyong Limited, Samsung Co. Ltd., and Daewoo Corporation. Analysis of Programs Throughout this notice, we refer to general principles applied to the facts of this investigation. These principles are described in the Subsidies Appendix attached to the notice of \"Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order,\" which was published in the April 26, 1984 issue of the Federal Register (49 F.R. 18006). For purposes of this determination, we are calculating a country-wide rate. The period for which we are measuring subsidization is the 1983 calendar year, which corresponds to the most recent fiscal year for each of the Korean producers and exporters. Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires, comments filed by petitioners, respondents, and other interested parties to this proceeding, and our verification, we determine the following: I. Programs Determined To Confer Subsidies We determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of OCTG under the following programs: A. Short-Term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations Petitioners alleged that the producers and exporters in Korea of OCTG receive preferential short-term export financing under the following programs: Export Loans under the 1972 Regulations for Export Financing; Export Loans provided under the Foreign Trade Act; Deferred Payment Export Loans; and Preferential Exchange Rates for Export Loans Based on Letter of Credit Short-term export financing is authorized only through the 1972 Export Financing Regulations. Our determination with respect to the three other programs is discussed in the sections on \"Programs Determined Not to Confer Subsidies\" and \"Programs Not in Existence.\" Under the Export Financing Regulations, short-term export loans can be provided to the following: Exporters in receipt of letters of credit: Exporters concluding documents of acceptance or documents against payment contracts: Exporters purchasing local supplies: Exporters stockpiling raw materials; Exporters with certificates based on past export performance; Producers of raw materials for export; and Companies awarded domestic projects based on international public tender. To determine whether a subsidy exists with respect to short-term export loans under the Export Financing Regulations, we must determine whether the export loan progam is intended to, or operates to, stimulate export rather than domestic sales, or is contingent on export performance. If there is a preference in a program's operation for export over domestic sales, we then must find an appropriate way to measure that preference. Prior to June 28, 1982, short-term export loans provided under the Export Financing Regulations were charged a lower interest rate than short-term domestic loans. On June 28, 1982, the Monetary Board established a uniform rate of 10 percent for both export and domestic short-term financing provided by commercial banks. The interest rate in effect during the period for which we are measuring subsidization was 10 percent for short-term export loans. We verified that domestic short-term financing through commercial banks is the predominant short-term debt instrument in Korea (see, for example, the Federation of Korean Industries surveys obtained during verification and the Korean Chamber of Commerce Survey, submitted as Exhibit 13 of the Government of Korea's response, August 17, 1984, as well as Bank of Korea Monthly Statistical Bulletins). If all other terms and conditions, as well as the administration, of the domestic and export loan programs were identical, we would not find that an export subsidy is being conferred because export loans are not at an interest rate is preferential compared to the interest rate on the most comparable, predominant short-term debt instrument. However, we have found that there is a difference in the administration of domestic and export short-term loans programs. The Bank of Korea (BOK) sets different rediscount ratios for export and domestic short-term loans. As specified in the BOK's 1983 Annual Report, the rediscount ratio for export loans is 70 percent of the face value of the loan. The rediscount ratio on domestic commercial bills is 30 percent of the face value of the loan for large firms and the heavy and chemical industries. The rediscount ratio for small- and medium-sized firms is 70 percent. Small- and medium-sized firms are defined as companies with fewer than 300 employees. None of the steel companies producing the products under investigation is classified as a small- or medium-sized firm. The rediscount rate for both domestic and export short-term loans is 5 percent. The higher rediscount ratio for export loans provides an incentive for banks to provide an export loan over a domestic loan when lending to a large company. Indeed, the banks' fee structure, which specifies lower fees on the letters of credit on which the short-term export loans are based, indicates that the banks encourage these borrowers to use export financing. Thus, we consider that the higher rediscount ratio for short-term export loans provides, in effect, a preference for export loans over domestic loans. Because the most comparable, predominant short-term debt instrument (i.e., the 10 percent rate on short-term domestic bank loans) cannot measure this preference, we must find an alternative method of quantifying it. We know from the surveys published by the Korean Chamber of Commerce and by the Federation of Koren Industries and from the Bank of Korea Statistical Bulletins, that companies do use sources of short-term financing in addition to bank loans. These sources include investment companies, commercial *46778 paper and the curb market. Since the rediscount mechanism operates in such a way as to encourage banks to supply firms short-term export financing at the expense of the domestic financing, we must conclude that short-term domestic financing comes from these other sources of financing as well as bank loans. Therefore, the most appropriate way to measure the preference for export over domestic loans is to compare the 10 percent rate with a weighted average of short-term domestic credit. We have chosen this measure because it is the best approximation of what firms would pay for export financing if there were not a preference within the banking system for providing loans for export transactions. The factors used to weight each of the four sources of short-term domestic credit were based on data from a number of sources, including the monthly Statistical Bulletin of the Bank of Korea and the surveys published by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). The Statistical Bulletin provides the size of, and interest rates charged on, short-term financing by banks, investment finance companies and commercial paper. The FKI surveys provide data on the proportion that curb market loans represent of total corporate borrowing for working capital. For the curb market interest rate, we have determined that the most appropriate rate to use is the average monthly rate for 1983 as published in the Survey conducted by the Korean Chamber of Commerce, provided as Exhibit 13 to the response submitted by the Government of Korea. This rate is 2.6 percent, which, when compounded, yields an annualized rate of 36.1 percent. We are using the rate published by the Chamber of Commerce as the most appropriate measure of the average curb market rate in 1983, because it was the only independently conducted study or survey of curb market rates that has been entered in the record of this investigation. We looked extensively for data on these rates at verification. We consider the Chamber Survey to be the most accurate reflection of average curb market rates during the period for which we are measuring subsidization. Using the data from all these sources, we calculated the weighted-average rate that we have determined is the most appropriate way to measure the preference for export over domestic loans. Comparing this weighted-average rate to the 10 percent rate on export loans, we calculate an export subsidy of 0.46 percent ad valorem. B. Accelerated Depreciation Article 25 of the \"Act Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reduction and Exemption\" permits a firm earning more than 50 percent of its total proceeds in a business year from foreign exchange to increase its normal depreciation by 30 percent. If the corporation has received less than 50 percent of its total proceeds from foreign exchange, it can still claim some accelerated depreciation, determined by a formula based on the firm's foreign exchange earnings and total business earnings. Of the firms investigated, only Pusan used accelerated depreciation under this program. Because the use of accelerated depreciation is contingent upon export performance, we determine that this program confers benefits which constitute export subsidies. To calculate the benefits from the accelerated depreciation program for the period in which we are measuring subsidization (calendar year 1983), we determined the tax savings received in 1983 based on the accelerated depreciation which had been deducted from the 1982 income taxes payable in 1983. The amount of tax savings received under this program was divided by the total value of exports in 1983 to calculate an export subsidy of 0.03 percent ad valorem. C. Tax Incentives for Exporters Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the \"Act Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reduction and Exemption\" provide for the deduction from taxable income of a number of different reserves relating to export activities. These reserves cover export losses, overseas market development and price fluctuation losses. Under Article 22, a corporation may establish a reserve amounting to one percent of the foreign exchange earnings, or 50 percent of net income in the applicable period, whichever is smaller. If certain export losses occur, they are offset from the reserve fund. If there are no offsets for export losses, the reserve is returned to the income account and taxed, after a one-year grace period, over a three-year period. Under Article 23 governing overseas market development, a corporation may establish a reserve fund amounting to one percent of its foreign exchange earnings in the export business for the respective business year. Expenses incurred in developing overseas markets are offset from the reserve fund. Like the export loss reserve fund, if there are no offsets for expenses, the reserve is returned to the income account and taxed, after a one-year grace period, over a three-year period. A price fluctuation reserve fund may be established under Article 24. Under this Article, a corporation may establish reserves equivalent to five percent of the book value of the products and works in progress which will be exported by the close of the business year. This reserve may be used to offset losses incurred from the fluctuation of prices for export goods. These losses may be offset by returning an amount equivalent to the losses to the income account. If not so utilized, the reserve is returned to the income account the following business year. The balance in all three reserve funds is not subject to corporate tax, although all moneys in the reserve funds are eventually reported as income and subject to corporate tax either when they offset export losses or when the one- year grace period expires. Pusan Steel Pipe, Korea Steel Pipe, Hyundai Pipe, Kukje, Samsung, and Daewoo received benefits under these programs in 1983. We determine that these export reserve programs confer benefits which constitute export subsidies because they provide a deferral of direct taxes specifically related to export performance. Because these export reserve funds constitute a deferral of tax liabilities, we treat the tax savings on these funds as interest-free loans to the corporation. Accordingly, we have quantified the benefits from the reserve funds by calculating the amount of tax savings and then applying a rate of interest which the firm would have had to pay for a short-term loan. Using this methodology, we calculate a subsidy of 0.04 percent ad valorem. II. Programs Determined Not to Confer Subsidies We determine that benefits which constitute subsidies are not being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea of OCTG, under the following programs: A. Medium- and Long-Term Credit Petitioners alleged that OCTG producers, as part of the Korean steel industry, have received medium- and long-term financing through government direction of credit and programs designed to finance major or key industries, and that these loans are made on terms which are inconsistent with commercial considerations. In order to investigate the first allegation, that credit is directed within the Korean economy, we have examined whether the Korean government mandates, explicitly or implicitly, that certain industries or enterprises receive *46779 credit at the expense of other borrowers. If there are explicit or implicit government mandates that certain industries or firms receive funds, then we would expect to find this reflected in the composition of the loan portfolios of all the lending institutions combined. Absent a finding that these key or major industries receive a disproportionate share of the medium- and long-term loans available in Korea, we cannot conclude that the Korean government is directing credit. Medium- and long-term financing is provided through three types of financial organizations in Korea: (1) Commercial banks: (2) Specialized banks; and (3) Development institutions (Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Korea). In addition, there are two government funds through which long-term financing is provided: (1) The National Investment Fund; and (2) The Fund for Expanding Export Facilities. We have examined the three types of financial organizations and the two government funds that are the sources of medium- and long-term borrowing in Korea. Viewing these institutions and funds in the aggregate, we determine that there is no government direction of medium- and long-term credit to the OCTG producers or to the broader steel sector. We have found that the lending institutions in Korea, when viewed as a whole, provide medium- and long-term loans to all sectors and all major industry groups, indeed to virtually all industries. Notwithstanding that certain of the sources have been created to provide credit to designated groups of recipients, these groups do not receive a disproportionate share of the total medium- and long-term credit available from all sources combined. Moreover, we determine that the OCTG producers and the broader steel industry do not receive a disproportionate share of funds from all these sources. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the steel industry has accounted for approximately 6 to 13 percent of GNP. During the same period the basic metals sector, which includes steel, has received 5 to 8 percent of medium- and long-term loans. Although we have found that credit is not directed by the Korean government to OCTG producers or to the broader steel industry, we must still examine whether particular medium- and long-term loans from any of the individual institutions or funds confer benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty law. In order to determine that medium- and long-term loans are providing benefits which constitute domestic subsidies, we must find that the program is limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, and that the loans are provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. If either of these conditions is not met, then we cannot find that a domestic subsidy exists. In making the determination on whether a program is limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, we have consistently examined whether there is a de facto, as well as a de jure, limitation. In making the determination of whether a loan is inconsistent with commercial considerations, we examine whether the potentially contervailable loan offers more favorable terms than the firm would otherwise receive. Based on our verification and information provided by the petitioners, the responses and the briefs submitted by parties to the proceeding, we have found the following with respect to each of the three types of financial organizations and the government funds: 1. Commercial Banks Commercial banks, which until the early 1980's were either government-owned or government-controlled, consist of seven nationwide or \"city\" banks, 10 regional or \"local\" banks, and the branches of 48 foreign banks. The domestic commercial banks are authorized by the General Banking Act (G.B.A.) and provide the normal financial services that are usually offered by banks in all countries. There is no explicit listing in the G.B.A. that designates certain industries or sectors for receipt of commercial bank credit. Bank of Korea statistics show the distribution of loans from the deposit money banks (DMB's). DMB's include both commercial and specialized banks. (Specialized banks are discussed in the following section.) Examination of the Bank of Korea statistics demonstrates that during both the 1970's and 1980's all sectors of the economy received loans through the DMB's and that steel did not receive a disproportionate share. During verification, we obtained loan statistics directly from Hanil and Cho- Heung, two of the five largest commercial banks in Korea. The loan statistics are broken down by sector, major industry group and industry. The sectors are: Agriculture and forestry; Mining; Manufacturing; Electricity, gas and water; Construction; Wholesalers; Transportation and warehousing; and Others (including social services). Each of these sectors is then broken down by major industry group and by industry within each group. Steel production is included in the primary metals group within the manufacturing sector. This group includes, in addition to steel, categories for aluminum and others. Our review of the loan statistics of these two banks for various years in the 1970's and 1980's shows that all sectors and major industry groups, indeed, virtually all industries, received loans. Furthermore, the statistics show that the steel industry did not receive a disproportionate share of the loans. 2. Specialized Banks There are seven specialized banks in Korea: Korea Exchange Bank, Medium Industry Bank, Citizens National Bank, Korea Housing Bank, National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation, National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives and Members Cooperatives, and the National Livestock Cooperative Federation. Each of these banks is set up by its own Act, and, by their titles, these banks are explicitly chartered to service certain broad sectors of the Korean economy. Like commercial banks, specialized banks are deposit money banks and, therefore, are included in Bank of Korea statistics on DMB loan distribution. As stated previously, the Bank of Korea statistics show that all sectors and industries have received loans through the DMB's and that steel has not received a disproportionate share of DMB loans. In addition, it is clear that the specialized banks have been set up to serve sectors of the economy besides steel. None has been set up specifically for the steel industry or even for the manufacturing sector or heavy industry sector. We verified that the steel companies producing the products under investigation have only a few outstanding long-term loans from specialized banks and that these loans do not represent a disproportionate share of the long-term loans funds from specialized banks. 3. Development Institutions a. Korea Development Bank (KDB). The KDB was established in 1954 to aid in the reconstruction of the country following the Korean War. Once reconstruction was completed, the bank shifted its resources to support the development of industries deemed *46780 important for long-term economic growth. The industries named in the KDB Enforcement Decree include electric power, coal mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel manufacturing, semiconductors and overseas marine and/or air transport. In addition to these industries, KDB also provides loans for agriculture, oil and gas, food and beverage, textiles, paper and paper products, chemicals, rubber and plastic products, non-metallic mineral products, fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment, construction, wholesale and retail trade, communications and financial services. Thus, while there is an explicit designation that the KDB will service certain industries, it also has provided loans to borrowers in numerous industries that were not designated. During the 1970's and 1980's, the KDB accounted for approximately 45 percent of the medium- and long-term loans available. Prior to the June 1982 equalization of interest rates, these designated industries were charged a lower interest rate than KDB borrowers in other industries. The interest rates charged by KDB are set by the Ministry of Finance. b. Export-Import Bank of Korea. Promulgated by Law No. 2122 in July 1969, the purpose of the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Eximbank) is \"to promote the sound development of the national economy and economic cooperation with foreign countries by extending the financial aid required for export and import transactions, overseas investment and the development of natural resources abroad.\" The Enforcement Decree for the Act specifies the \"major\" raw materials that Eximbank should develop: Coal, iron ore, cooper, petroleum, and other mined materials; Timber and other forest materials; Grains, cotton, sugar, rubber and other agricultural materials; and Other raw materials deemed necessary to secure stabilized long-term supply for the economy; however, this should be decided through a state meeting and announced through the Ministry of Finance. Thus, if there is any explicit designation of recipients of loans from the Eximbank, the designated group is raw material users. During verification, we examined all export and overseas investment loans awarded from 1976 through 1982. During those seven years, only five loans were awarded to the steel industry; one in 1979, two in 1980 and two in 1982. None of these five loans were for the financing of exports of the products under investigation. Also, during each of these years there were other projects financed in other industries. For example, in 1979, the other overseas investment loans went to a taxtile plant project, a manufacturing plant project, fishery development, a cement plant project, and vessel chartering. Thus, the Korea Eximbank finances projects in a wide number of industries. Moreover, the steel industry has not received a disproportionate share of Eximbank loan monies. 4. The National Investment Fund On December 14, 1973, the government of Korea established the National Investment Fund (NIF) through Law No. 2635. The stated \"purpose of this Act is to prescribe necessary matters for the establishment and effective management of the National Investment Fund on the bases of extensive nationwide savings efforts and participation, to secure and supply the investment and loan funds needed to promote the construction of major industries, including the heavy and chemical industries, as well as to help \"increase exports.\" In the preliminary determination, we determined that NIF loans were countervailable export subsidies because one of the express purposes stated in the Act was to help increase exports and because they were provided at preferential rates. During verification, we found that there are two types of NIF loans, one to finance development and one to finance exports on a deferred payment basis. The NIF loans to finance exports on a deferred payment basis are managed by Eximbank. We verified that exports of the products under investigation are not eligible to receive NIF loans for exports on a deferred payment basis and that none of the companies producing OCTG has financed exports of OCTG through this program. With respect to the other pool of NIF monies, our examination of loan files, as well as application and approval documents at the companies, did not reveal any export-related conditions on these NIF loans. Thus, we now conclude the NIF loans are not export subsidies. Despite the fact that NIF loans would not be considered export subsidies, the law establishing the fund and the enforcement decree explicitly designate certain industries for receipt of these loans. In addition to \"major industries, including the heavy and chemical industries,\" the enforcement decree names steel, nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, machinery, chemicals, electronics, food production, power, mining, cement, rural manufactured goods, projects to increase rural income, and fishing and fisheries projects. NIF, loans accounted for 25 to 30 percent of the medium and long-term loans issued in the 1970's and 1980's. 5. Fund for Expanding Export Facilities During verification at the companies we found several outstanding long-term loans received through the \"Fund for Expanding Export Facilities.\" This fund was established in 1973 and abolished in 1982. Eligibility for these loans was limited to manufacturers building facilities for producing export goods or raw materials and purchasers of ocean-going vessels used for the fish export industry. Thus, this Act designates exporters as recipients. Based on the findings reported above, we determine that because commercial banks and specialized banks provide medium--and long-term loans to all sectors and industries in the economy, and because the steel industry did not receive a disproportionate share, loans from these sources are not limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries and therefore do not provide benefits which constitute subsidies. Furthermore, based on our review of the Eximbank Act and the Enforcement Decree, and the distribution of the loans we find that there is no de jure or de facto limitation to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. Accordingly, we determine that Eximbank loans do not provide benefits which constitute subsidies. We also determine that loans provided to the OCTG producers through the KDB and the NIF do not provide benefits which constitute subsidies, because the interest rates paid on these loans have been equal to the interest rate for all medium--and long-term loans in Korea since June 1982. Thus, these loans are not on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. To determine whether a loan is inconsistent with commercial considerations, we rely on the methodology in the Subsidies Appendix for long-term loans to companies considered creditworthy. As stated in the Appendix, the benechmark for long-term loans in company-specific, unless the company lacks adequate comparable commercial experience. If the company lacks comparable commercial experience, we use a national average long-term loan interest rate. After finding an appropriate benchmark loan, the next step in determining if a loan was given on terms *46781 inconsistent with commercial considerations is to calculate the payment differential between the benchmark loan and the loans at issue. Consistent with our methodology, when the long- term loans are at variable interest rates, we calculate the benefit based on the differential between the interest rate for the loan at issue and the interest rate on the benchmark loans in the year for which we are measuring subsidization. As stated above, the rates on all medium--and long-term loans were equalized in 1982. Hence, for the year in which we are measuring subsidization, there is no interest differential between the loans at issue and the benchmark loans. We note that using as the benchmark the 1983 interest rate on a variable rate long-term commercial loan is not a departure from prior practice. In our preliminary determination, we used a short-term interest rate as the benchmark for NIF loans. However, we stated that because we needed additional information in order to determine whether loans from commercial and specialized banks were subsidies, we could not use those variable rate long-term loans in establishing our benchmark. Thus, because we had no comparable commercial long-term loan experience with which to compare NIF loans, we use, as best information available, a short-term rate for purposes of measuring the benefit conferred by these loans. Finally, we determined that loans received by the OCTG producers under the Fund for Expanding Export Facilities do not confer benefits that constitute export subsidies. Assuming, as we do, that eligibility for these loans is contingent upon export performance, to quantify any benefit arising from these long-term export-related loans, we must compare the terms of these loans to the cost of comparable commercial domestic long-term loans. We know that all loans from the Fund for Export Facilities that were still outstanding during the period for which we are measuring subsidization were charged 10 percent interest after the June 1982 equalization of interest rates. Thus, since June 1982 the cost to the borrower on these loans is the same as the cost of comparable domestic long-term loans. As a result, we find that no benefit is conferred by these long-term export-related loans. B. Import Duty Deferrals Article 36 of the Customs Act of Korea permits the Ministry of Finance to designate an industry as eligible to pay customs duties on an installment basis, rather than upon entry. In our preliminary determination, we determined this program to confer a subsidy because the government of Korea did not provide us with any information demonstrating that during the period for which we are measuring subsidization this program was not limited to a specific enterprises or industry or group of enterprise or industries. A program may be available, in principle, to a wide group of industries, but when there appears to be some discretion on the part of the government in the granting of benefits under the program, we must determine that discretion effectively limits the program to specific enterprises or industries. During the verification, we found that twenty-four industries were eligible to receive duty deferrals including industries as disparate as mining, cement, fertilizers, chemicals, machine tools, steel works, and plywood. Once an industry is considered eligible, each company within the industry may request deferral status by submitting an application to the Tariff Administration Office of the Office of Customs Administration. We examined this program to determine if only certain companies within each of the twenty- four industries had their application for duty deferral status approved. We found that in practice there appears to be no limitation to the companies within the twenty-four industries which receive duty referrals, and that any company which applies is granted that status. Therefore, we determine that this program is not limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, and, therefore, does not constitute a subsidy. C. Investment Tax Credit Petitioners alleged that producers and exporters of OCTG may receive preferential tax benefits under Article 72 of the \"Act of Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reduction and Exemption,\" which provides for a temporary investment tax credit when the government deems it necessary for adjustment of economic activities. During the period from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 1982, Article 57-2 was the enforcement decree for Article 72. Article 57-2 specifies that the investment tax credit was available for the acquisition of fixed assets used directly for the manufacturing or mining business. Consistent with past practice, programs available to all industries in the manufacturing and mining sectors are not limited to \"a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,\" and thus do not provide domestic subsidies. Since the tax credit is not contingent on export performance, it does not provide an export subsidy. Thus, we determine that this program does not constitute a subsidy. D. Subsidized Steel Inputs Petitioners alleged that DongJin may benefit from subsidies received by its parent company. Until 1984, DongJin was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pohang Iron & Steel Company (POSCO), a manufacturer of hot-rolled coil, blooms, and billets. Petitioners alleged that subsidies received by POSCO on those products may be passed on to DongJin. DongJin's raw material for OCTG is J-55 grade of hot-rolled steel coil. During 1983, DongJin purchased this product from POSCO and from an unrelated foreign supplier whom we have never found to be subsidized. We verified that the price paid by DongJin to POSCO was comparable to the price DongJin paid to its foreign supplier for hot-rolled coil. Furthermore, no rebates or discounts are received from POSCO on these purchases. Consequently, we determine that DongJin receives no competitive benefit through its purchases of inputs from POSCO. Section 613 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, signed by the President on October 30, codifies the standards for determining upstream subsidies. This section generally codifies Department practice. Our investigation was consistent with both Department practice and the newly codified standards. E. Equity Infusions into DongJin In their July 18 submission, petitioners alleged that POSCO, the parent company of DongJin, received government equity infusions on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations and that this equity subsidy may have been passed through POSCO to DongJin. DongJin was established on October 27, 1982, by POSCO. At the time of DongJin's formation, POSCO invested funds in order to provide cash for the purchase of the assets of Illsin Steel Company and working capital for DongJin's future operations. POSCO also guaranteed the notes of DongJin used for the purchase of Illsin's assets. Illsin Steel Company was a bankrupt company, owned and operated by it two major creditors, Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) and Commercial Bank of Korea (CBK). In accordance with Korean law, at the time of bankruptcy the courts foreclosed upon Illsin's assets and offered the assets for sale at public *46782 auction. Because there were no other bidders for the assets at the appraised value or above, the banks, which were the highest bidders, purchased the assets at auction. These assets were then sold to DongJin for cash and notes. According to the banks: (1) The price offered by DongJin was the highest price which they could obtain, (2) the banks' operations of Illsin were resulting in a cash drain on them, and (3) it was in the bank's interest to sell the assets as a package, so as not to significantly decrease the value of the total package. Because there were no bidders, at auction, which would have paid the appraised value of the assets, and because it was in the banks' interest to minimize their losses, the sale of Illsin by the banks can be characterized as a distress sale. Although the banks were eager to sell, the purchase of Illsin's assets by DongJin presented certain advantages to POSCO. Illsin had been a major supplier to POSCO. POSCO had knowledge and management expertise to operate Illsin and under the circumstances might negotiate terms which could make the venture economically attractive. The terms negotiated required a minimal amount of cash and notes, some of which were at zero interest rate. To determine whether POSCO's equity infusion into DongJin was on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, we analyzed the terms compared to ordinary commercial considerations. The Department did not find this transaction inconsistent with commercial considerations for the following reasons. First, POSCO did not receive government funds during 1982 and, therefore, POSCO's investment in DongJin could not have been a pass through from the government. Second, we found no evidence that the government directed the banks to sell the assets to DongJin on favorable terms. Third, the cash investment into a newly created subsidiary by a parent company, and the guaranteeing of subsidiary's notes, when the subsidiary is still a \"shell\" organization, are normal business practices. Fourth, because of the commercial advantages to both the seller and the purchaser in this transaction, and the apparent lack of interest by any other party to purchase Illsin's assets, we determine that the transaction was not on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. Moreover, we do not consider POSCO's guarantee of DongJin's notes payable to be a subsidy, because no evidence has been submitted that a parent company's guarantee of a wholly-owned subsidiary's loan is inconsistent with commercial considerations. 111. Programs Determined Not To Be Used We have determined that OCTG manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Korea do not use the following programs that were identified in the notice of \"Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation of OCTG from Korea\": A. Preferential Port Charges Petitoners alleged that \"designated companies\" under the Iron and Steel Industry Rehabilitation Order are eligible on a case-by-case-basis to receive discounts on port rates. We verified that the rates charged to, and paid by, OCTG producers and exporters for use of ports are the same as those charged to all other users. B. Tariff Reductions on Imported Plant and Equipment Petitioners alleged that the government of Korea allows reductions of import duties for certain industries on certain items designated by the Ministry of Finance. We verified that none of the OCTG producers or exporters received tariff reductions on imported plant and equipment. C. Free Export Zone Program Petitioners alleged that producers and exporters of OCTG receive tax benefits based upon location in a free export zone. We verified that none of the producers or exporters of OCTG is located in a Free Export Zone. D. Foreign Capital Inducement Law Petitioners alleged that OCTG producers and exporters may be receiving financial and tax benefits under the Foreign Capital Inducement Law. The producers and exporters of OCTG are not eligible for any benefits under this program because they have no foreign ownership. E. Export Credit Insurance Petitioners alleged that the government of Korea provides annual contributions to an export insurance program. We verified that export credit insurance was not used to insure exports of OCTG to the United States. F. Port Facilities Petitioners alleged that the government of Korea is constructing a port at Kwangyang Bay to facilitate the importation of coal and iron ore. It is further alleged that POSCO, and therefore its subsidiary. DongJin, will benefit from this port. The port is scheduled for completion in 1987 and will not be used by any producer that exported OCTG to the United States during the period for which we are measuring subsidization. G. Training Aid Petitioners alleged that the steel industry has received training aid from the government of Korea. We verified that the steel companies producing the products under investigation have not received training grants or other training funds from the government of Korea. H. Financial and Technical Assistance for Raw Material Purchases Under the Iron and Steel Promotion Act financial and technical assistance to purchase raw materials is authorized. However, we found no evidence that steel companies producing the products under investigation receive assistance from the government in purchasing raw materials. I. Preferential Utility Rates Petitioners alleged that \"designated companies\" under the Iron and Steel Industry Rehabilitation Order are eligible on a case-by-case basis to receive discounts from regular utility charges. Under Article 7 of the Iron and Steel Industry Promotion Act reductions on utility charges are authorized. The steel industry made a request to the Korean Electric Company seeking reduced rates but the Electric Company turned down the request and the reductions were never granted. We also found no evidence that the steel companies producing the products under investigation received reductions or other assistance on any other utility rates. Programs Not In Existence We determine that the following programs are not in existence or have been abolished: A Preferential Exchange Rates for Export Loans Petitioners alleged that producers and exporters of OCTG receive preferential exchange rates for export loans based on letters of credit. Petitioners alleged that the exchange rate used for loans based on letters of credit was 10 percent more favorable to Korean exporters than the actual exchange rate. There is no preferential exchange rate used to convert export financing. For export loans granted under the Export Financing Regulations, a Won/U.S. dollar conversion factor which is lower than the official exchange rate is utilized when a loan is received against a letter *46783 of credit. Therefore, we determine that there is no program of preferential exchange rates for export loans that provides countervailable benefits to OCTG producers and exporters. B. Export Financing under the Foreign Trade Transaction Act Petitioners alleged that the government of Korea provides the steel industry with preferential short-term export financing under the Foreign Trade Transaction Act. The foreign Trade Transactions Act has been repealed and was not in effect during the period for which we are measuring subsidization. C. Steel Industry Development Scheme Petitioners alleged that the Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry is sponsoring a steel industry development scheme in which the government will spend 210 billion won on POSCO's (DongJin's parent company) plant expansion project. At verification we established that the Ministry of Trade and Industry is not sponsoring such a scheme. D. Wage Controls Petitioners alleged that the government of Korea controls wages for government-run firms such as POSCO, resulting in lower production costs for this segment of Korean industry. It is further alleged that DongJin may benefit from government wage controls by virtue of its status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of POSCO. The rates paid by DongJin to its workers are comparable to the rates paid by other steel manufacturers. We also found no evidence that the government of Korea has a wage control system under which DongJin must operate. E. Joint Facilities for Industrial Complexes Scheme Petitioners alleged in their August 20 submission that the government of Korea was providing funding for joint facilities in industrial complexes, and that the steel industry was one of the industries targeted for such funding. In 1981 such a program was discussed between the Federation of Small and Medium Industry Cooperatives and the government of Korea. The project was to be located near Kimpo Airport in Seoul. However, in January 1982 the proposed project was cancelled due to lack of funding. F. Equipment Funds for Export Strategy Industries and Funding for Industrialization of New Technology The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is presently studying proposals concerning these two projects but there has been no final decision on whether to set them up. The Korea Development Bank has received a loan from the Asian Development Bank to fund one of the programs. However, we verified that the ony industries eligible to receive loans from this fund are companies producing machines and machine parts. G. Assistance for Trading Comnpanies In their August 20 submission petitioners alleged that the government of Korea provided benefits to trading companies by allowing them to increase their foreign exchange holding and by allowing them to increase their reserve funds to cover export losses in foreign markets. With regard to the first allegation, trading companies are authorized to maintain foreign currency accounts of over $300,000 dollars. However, we found no evidence that other companies are limited in their foreign exchange holdings or any other evidence to suggest that this allowance for foreign exchange holding provides a countervailable benefit to trading companies. Regarding the allegation on export reserves, we verified at the trading companies that there are no special provisions allowing them to claim additional export loss reserves. Even if there were such provisions, we have verified all the outstanding export reserves held by the trading companies. Petitioners Comments Comment 1: Petitioners argue that the commercial bank interest rate, which was averaged with other rates to compute the benchmark, is not a free market rate and, therefore should not have been used in determining a benchmark. In support of their contention they cite Department practice as reflected in prior proceedings and in the Subsidies Appendix where \"commercial\" interest rates were used as benchmarks or where market-determined prices were sought. DOC Position: We disagree. Petitioners are reading our prior determinations and the Subsidies Appendix too narrowly. For example, in seeking a \"commercial\" benchmark interest rate, we are seeking the alternative financing that is available to the firm in the lending marketplace of that country. We are asking if the interest rate paid on the allegedly preferential loan is less than what the average firm in that country would otherwise be paying. Similarly, in looking to market prices, we are seeking the prices that exist in that country's marketplace. Typically, the marketplace is not the perfectly competitive market envisaged by economists. Instead, it is the commercial environment facing the firm. The commercial environment includes any distortions to relative prices that arise from government actions such as government regulation of the banking system, tax systems, customs duties or minimum wage laws. So long as profit-maximizing firms compete within that system, a marketpalce exists and our benchmarks for identifying and valuing subsidies are prices in that marketplace. Comment 2: Petitioners argue that the benchmark interest rate used in the Department's preliminary determination, a weighted average of the interest rates charged by all sources of short-term commercial financing in Korea, does not reflect what a company would pay a normal commercial lender and is thus inconsistent with the principles enunciated by the Department for quantifying subsidies. Petitioners further argue that it is the curb market's unregulated interest rate which reflects the real cost of credit in Korea, and thus, pursuant to the principles enunciated in the Department's Subsidies Appendix, the curb market interest rate should be used as the benchmark interest rate in this case. DOC Position: The Department believes that the correct benchmark for short-term lending normally is the most comparable, predominant form of short- term financing in the country under investigation. However, as explained in the section of the notice on \"Short-Term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations\", the Department has found an incentive for banks to lend for export transactions at the expense of domestic financing. Using best information available, the Department has measured this preference for export lending by comparing the cost of export loans with the weighted-average cost of all forms of short-term domestic financing. In the case of long-term loans, the Department has followed its standard practice of comparing the terms of loans under examination with the terms of comparable commercial long-term loans (see the section of the notice on \"Medium- and Long-Term Credit\"). In reaching these determinations, we believe we have been faithful to the principles enunciated in our Subsidies Appendix. Comment 3: Petitioners contend that, assuming arguendo, the weighted-average benchmark is the correct benchmark, the Department's weighted-average benchmark understates the proportional size of the curb market and *46784 overstates the proportional size of bank credit as sources of domestic credit. DOC Position: As explained in the section of the notice on \"Short-term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations,\" we are using a weighted- average of short-term domestic financing costs in order to quantify the banking system's preference for export loans. This weighted-average credit pool comprises short-term domestic bank credit, investment and finance company credit, commercial paper, and the curb market. Our weights are based on the most reliable data entered in the record of this investigation, including the Bank of Korea's Monthly Statistical Bulletin, the Federation of Korean Industries' biannual surveys of corporate financing, and the Korea Chamber of Commerce's annual survey of the curb market. Comment 4: Petitioners contend that Korean medium-and long-term financing is a countervailable benefit because it is made available only to specially- designated priority sectors, to specific subgroups within those sectors, and, in particular, to the steel industry. DOC Position: As explained in the section of the notice on \"Medium- and Long- term Credit,\" we found no evidence that the Governmnt of Korea directs medium- and long-term credit. Respondents' Comments Comment 1: Respondents argue that the Department was incorrect in not using the interest rate for short-term borrowings from commercial banks as the most appropriate national average commercial method of short-term financing. Bill discounts, overdrafts, and general term loans are the domestic equivalents of short-term export financing, and are the alternative financing to export loans. Department precedent has always been to select the most comparable and commonly used alternative source of financing in a given country. DOC Position: We agree that the correct benchmark for short-term lending normally is the most comparable, predominant form of short-term financing in the country under investigation. However, as explained in the section of the notice on \"Short-Term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations\", the Department has found an incentive for banks to lend for export transactions at the expense of domestic financing. Using best information available, the Department has measured this preference for export lending by comparing the cost of export loans with the weighted-average cost of all forms of short-term domestic financing. Comment 2: Respondents contend that the Department was incorrect in determining that long-term loans provided by the National Investment Fund (NIF) constitute export subsidies. NIF loans are in no way contingent on export performance. Respondents further contend that NIF loans are also not domestic subsidies because they are generally available. In any case, given the Department's methodology for evaluating long-term variable rate loans, no new NIF loans or NIF loans outstanding have been at preferential interest rates since NIF rates were equalized with the commercial bill discount rate in late 1981. DOC Position: We agree that NIF loans do not constitute an export subsidy. We have also found that they do not constitute a domestic subsidy because interest rates on NIF loans during the period under investigation were not on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. The correct long-term benchmark rate, however, is not that which exists on short-term commercial bills; rather, it is the rate on comparable commercial long-term borrowing. This is the benchmark we used in determining that NIF loans did not constitute subsidies. Comment 3: Respondents note in their comments on the Government Verification Report that, in the Ministry of Trade and Industry's requirements submission for NIF loans, a number of different companies from industries other than steel are listed and that not only steel companies were specifically listed. DOC Position: We agree that companies from other industries were listed in the submissions. Comment 4: Respondents argue in their comments on the DongJin Verification Report that the sale of assets by the banks to POSCO was incorrectly characterized as a loan. They argue that the transaction between POSCO and the banks is a purchase contract between the owners of the assets (the banks) and the purchaser (POSCO). DOC Position: Our determination with respect to this transaction is set forth in the section of the notice on \"Equity Infusions in DongJin.\" Comment 5: Respondents note in their comments on the DongJin Verification Report, that the charges paid for opening letters of credit are unrelated to the short-term loans themselves. DOC Position: As discussed in the section of the notice on \"Short-term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations,\" we consider that the fee structure, which specifies lower charges for opening those letters of credit used to purchase imports of raw materials which are then used in export production, to be a manifestation of the preference built into the government's rediscount mechanism on short-term export loans. We consider that we have captured any benefit from this fee structure in our comparison of the weighted- average interest rate on domestic loans with the 10 percent interest rate on export loans. Comment 6: Respondents argue in their comments on the Government Verification Report that the central bank rediscount mechanism was established to ensure that financing reached the productive sector of the economy by tying the financing to commodities and transactions, and that the volume of domestic financing under this mechanism far exceeds export financing if overdrafts and general term loans are included. They also argue that because domestic commercial bills finance 100 percent of the bills value, while export loans are eligible for only 80 percent, the rediscount mechanism does not alter the value of financing reaching the borrower. DOC Position: We disagree. In 1983, the volume of short-term domestic financing eligible for rediscount at the Bank of Korea was less than the volume of short-term export financing eligible for rediscount at the Bank of Korea. We believe this is a manifestation of the preference for export financing over domestic financing. Although a large company's domestic transactions are eligible for financing equal to 100 percent of transaction value, the bank which provides this financing may only rediscount 30 percent of that 100 percent at the Bank of Korea. At the same time, although all firms' export transactions are only eligible for financing equal to 80 percent of transactions value, the bank which provides this financing can rediscount 70 percent of the 80 percent at the Bank of Korea. Thus, the Bank of Korea supplies credit which covers only 30 percent of the value of a domestic transaction as compared to 56 percent of the value of an export transaction. This preference for export credit is a subsidy, and we have countervailed it (see the section of this notice entitled. \"Short-term Export Financing Under the Export Financing Regulations.\") Comments by U.S. Steel, a Party to the Proceeding Comment 1: U.S. Steel argues that the weighted-average benchmark interest rate used by the Department in its preliminary determination greatly understated the subsidy from government provided/directed loans *46785 because it included the commercial bank interest rate, which is a heavily subsidized rate, available only to a select few government-preferred industries. U.S. Steel contends that the commercial bank rate should not be included in the weighted-average benchmark because it is not a market rate. Thus, its use contravenes the Department's standard requirement that the benchmark be a market interest rate. U.S. Steel further contends that because Korean commercial banks lend (1) at well below market interest rates, (2) only to a selected few government-preferred, priority sectors, and (3) without considering borrower creditworthiness, commercial banks cannot be considered \" normal commerical lenders.\" This too contravenes standards Department policy which states that loan benchmarks represent what a company would pay a normal commercial lender. DOC Position: See our responses to petitioners' Comment 1 and Comment 2. Comment 2: U.S. Steel contends that, even if it were proper to include the commercial bank interest rate in the Department's weighted-average benchmark, the benchmark still understated the subsidy from government provided/directed loans because the size of the commercial bank sector has been greatly overstated relative to the private (curb) loan market. DOC Position: See our response to petitioners' Comment 3. Comment 3: Petitioner contends that exporters and/or steel producers benefit from a lower effective interest rate on domestic bank loans because they, unlike other borrowers, are not subject to compensating balance requirements. DOC Position: Bank of Korea regulations specifically prohibit domestic banks from requiring compensating balances. During verfication, we found no evidence that domestic bank loans require compensating balances of other borrowers, while not requiring them of exporters and/or steel producers. Comment 4: U.S Steel argues that the Korean government allocates the heavily subsidized credit of the \"tightly government controlled-banking system\" to select priority, export industries. All others must rely on the curb market for funds. Commercial bank loans have especially focused on the Korean steel industry, and loan decisions are based on political, not creditworthiness considerations. U.S. Steel contends that commercial bank loans were not generally available either prior to or during 1983-1984. DOC Position: For an explanation of our treatment of medium- and long-term loans, see the section of this notice entitled \"Medium- and Long-term Credit\". Comment 5: U.S. Steel contends that the National Investment Fund (NIF) provides preferential loans to steel producers. DOC Position: The Department has found that NIF loans do not constitute subsidies during the period for which we are measuring subsidization (see the section of this notice entitled \"Medium- and Long-Term Credit\"). Comment 6: U.S. Steel contends that the NIF provided loans to steel producers at interest rates below those paid on NIF deposits. This differential in the cost of their funds and the return on their funds was assumed by the government, and constitutes an additional subsidy to steel producers. DOC Position: During the period for which we are measuring subsidization, interest rates on long-term variable-rate NIF loans outstanding were not below interest rates on long-term variable-rate NIF deposits outstanding. Therefore, no government assumption of interest charges is indicated during the period for which we are measuring subsidization. Comment 7: U.S. Steel argues that the respondent's non-responsiveness to questions in the Department's questionnaire concerning both commercial banks and NIF dictates that the Department make all inferences against respondents. DOC Position: The Department has found respondents responsive to our requests for information throughout this investigation considering the time constraints under which all parties were operating. Furthermore, we obtained information on the commercial banks and NIF during our verification and U.S. Steel was given an opportunity to comment on the reports of our verification which discuss commercial banks and the NIF in detail. Comment 8: U.S. Steel argues that Korean Development Bank (KDB) loans are not generally available and should therefore be countervailed. DOC Position: The Department has found that KDB loans do not constitute subsidies during the period for which we are measuring subsidization (see the section of this notice entitled \"Medium- and Long-Term Credit\"). Comment 9: U.S. Steel contends that Korean steel producers benefit from government loan guarantees. DOC Position: In the course of our investigation we determined that loan guarantees from both government-owned and privately-owned financial institutions are a standard commercial practice in Korea. The Bankers' Association sets the guarantee fees, and all Korean banking institutions charge those fees. The fee structure for loan guarantees does not differentiate by industry or class of transaction (i.e.: export or domestic). It does distinguish between won and foreign currency loans. As explained at verification by both foreign and Korean bankers, foreign banks, unlike Korean banks, cannot require collateral on their loans. Thus, foreign bankers generally require a loan guarantee. Korean banks usually require guarantees when a company has no unpledged collateral. We found that the steel companies producing the products under investigations paid the fees specified by the Bankers' Association for those guarantees that they had on their domestic and foreign currency loans. Thus, we do not consider that these guarantees are on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. Comment 10: U.S. Steel contends that the Department's verification reports indicate that preferential port charges for exports exist in Korea, based on the per ton differential in port charges for exporting, importing and domestic shipping. DOC Position: The Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) establishes the rates for port charges. Rates vary according to port also to the type of port activity. Port charges are higher for importers than for exporters: however, the charges for domestic shipping are the lowest. For the port at Pusan the rate is 22 cents a ton for exporting, 37 cents a ton for importing, and 68 won a ton for shipping to another Korean port. The rate of 68 won for domestic shipping is much lower than the 22 cents a ton rate charged to exporters. Since an exporting activity is not favored over a domestic activity, we find no countervailable benefit being provided to producers or exporters of OCTG. Comment 11: U.S. Steel notes that the Department's verification report on DongJin indicates that opening charges on letters of credit for loans for purchasing foreign raw materials for domestic use are higher than for loans purchasing foreign raw materials for export use. They consider this to be an export subsidy. DOC Position: We believe that we have captured any benefit to short-term export loans provided by this fee structure in our calculation of the subsidy on the short-term export loans. For further discussion of this issue, see *46786 our response to respondents' Comment 5. Comment 12: U.S. Steel contends that Pohang Iron and Steel Company's (POSCO) equity infusions into DongJin are a countervailable subsidy because no private investor would have been willing to invest in DongJin. DOC Position: Our determination with respect to the formation of, and equity investment in, DongJin is set forth in the section entitled \"Equity infusions into DongJin.\" Verification In accordance with section 776(a) of the Act, we verified the information used in making our final determination. Commerce officials spent from September 18 to October 17 verifying the information submitted by the government of Korea and by the companies under investigation, and gathering additional information to be used in our final determination. During this verification we followed normal verification procedures including inspection of documents and ledgers, and tracing the information in the responses to source documents, accounting ledgers, and to financial statements. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, on September 12, 1984 we instructed the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of oil country tubular goods from Korea (49 FR 35836). As of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register, the liquidation of all entries, or withdrawals from warehouse, for consumption of this merchandise will continue to be suspended and the Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or bond for each such entry of this merchandise in the amount of 0.53 percent ad valorem. This suspension will remain in effect until further notice. ITC Notification In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC of our determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC all nonprivileged and nonconfidential information relating to this investigation. We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and confidential information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order, without the written consent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. The ITC will make its determination whether these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry within 45 days of the publication of this notice. If the ITC determines that material injury or the threat of material injury does not exist, this proceeding will be terminated and all estimated duties deposited or securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. If, however, the ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue a countervailing duty order, directing the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties on all entries of OCTG from Korea entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the suspension of liquidation date, equal to the net subsidy amount indicated in the \"Suspension of Liquidation\" section of this notice. This notice is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1771(d)). William T. Archey Acting Assistant Secretary for Trade Administration. November 20, 1984.
