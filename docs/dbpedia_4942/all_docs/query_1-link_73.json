        "text": "Stephanie Cutter is a co-founder and partner at Precision. At Precision, Stephanie has revolutionized the integration of data-driven communications with digital and campaign style organizing to improve reputations, reset a narrative, manage crises and drive people to action. She has improved the brand of one of the nation’s largest health insurers during a controversial merger; successfully launched a news network; restored the reputation of a multinational financial institution; reshaped a national storyline on behalf of a leading professional athlete; and successfully managed a global crisis for a well known consumer tech platform. The New York Times called Stephanie “the polished, sometimes scarily organized strategist who gets things done” and who “has a long and favorable reputation with some of the most influential journalists and opinion makers in Washington.” Named “one of the most prominent voices in the [Democratic] party, and one of its top strategists and crisis managers” by Politico, Stephanie has crafted high-level communications, reputation and crisis- management strategies for two U.S. Presidents, U.S. Senate leaders, and the nation’s highest profile political campaigns and Fortune 500 corporations. After helping to elect President Obama in 2008 and serving in the White House as a senior adviser, Stephanie was President Obama’s 2012 deputy campaign manager in charge of communications, media, policy, and research as well as being a member of the senior strategy team.\n\nIn 2020, Stephanie once again changed the political communications game as the Chief Program Executive for the first-ever virtual Democratic National Convention and the Executive Producer of President Biden’s Inauguration. According to the Washington Post, the Convention was a “production that knew exactly what story it wanted to tell and how to use the tools of electronic persuasion to tell it.” Stephanie was nominated for an Emmy award for production of “Celebrating America,” the inaugural primetime special at the Lincoln Memorial which was watched by more than 100 million people.\n\nGQ named her one of “the 50 most powerful people in Washington.” Prior to working with President Obama, Stephanie served as a senior aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator John Kerry, and President Bill Clinton. Stephanie is the former co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, and frequently appears on TV networks and cable offering commentary of the news of the day.\n\nMarcelo Suárez-Orozco is Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Prior to his return to the Commonwealth, he served as the inaugural UCLA Wasserman Dean and Distinguished Professor of Education. Dr. Suárez-Orozco’s research focuses on conceptual and empirical problems in the areas of cultural psychology and psychological anthropology with a focus on the study of mass migration, globalization and education. He is the author of numerous scholarly essays, award-winning books and edited volumes published by Harvard University Press, Stanford University Press, University of California Press, Cambridge University Press, Columbia University Press and others. His scholarly papers are published in a range of disciplines and languages in international journals. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, W. T. Grant, Spencer, Rockefeller, Hewlett, Ford and Carnegie, and multiple others. He has also served as the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Education and as Member of the Inaugural Executive Committee of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University. At NYU, he served as the inaugural Courtney Sale Ross University Professor.\n\nDr. Suárez-Orozco earned his A.B. in psychology, M.A. in anthropology, and Ph.D. in anthropology at UC Berkeley. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts with his wife, the eminent psychologist of immigration, Carola Suárez-Orozco. Carola and Marcelo’s hobbies include taking Lilly – their Papillon, for long walks in Boston Harbor and, whenever possible, biking in the woods of Western Massachusetts.\n\nVictoria Reggie Kennedy is the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Austria. Prior to her appointment, Ambassador Kennedy was an attorney based in the Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. offices of the global law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy has been an active leader in the business community of Boston and the greater New England region. She was a member of the Board of Directors of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, where she advocated for public policies that contribute to economic success and generate economic opportunity for people and businesses in the region. Ambassador Kennedy has also been a champion for the arts. She was a Trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts where she chaired the Education Committee for more than a decade. She also served for many years on the Board of Overseers of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy is a leading voice for the empowerment of women and girls and has championed diversity, inclusion, and equity in the workplace. She has been a strong proponent for gun violence prevention, serving on the Board of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for ten years and co-founding a non-profit organization, Common Sense About Kids and Guns. She advocated for expanding medical research and access to health care to all Americans and was actively involved in the passage of the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy earned a B.A. in English from Newcomb College and a J.D. from Tulane Law School, both in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is the recipient of numerous civic awards and honors, including eight honorary degrees."
