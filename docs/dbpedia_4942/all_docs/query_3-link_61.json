        "text": "Maya Angelou (1928-2014) was one of the most renowned and celebrated voices in American literature. She was a poet, memoirist, novelist, educator, dramatist, producer, actress, dancer, historian, filmmaker, and civil rights activist.\n\nIn the mid-fifties, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She studied modern dance with Martha Graham, danced with Alvin Ailey on television variety shows and, in 1957, recorded her first album, Calypso Lady. In 1958, she moved to New York, where she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, acted in the historic Off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's The Blacks and wrote and performed Cabaret for Freedom. She also worked for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), under Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership. In the early 1960s, she moved with her son to Africa, where she lived and worked for various news outlets, as a journalist, in Egypt and Ghana. Inspired by James Baldwin to write her story, Angelou published her first book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) to international acclaim and enormous popular success. Her published verse, non-fiction, and fiction include more than 30 bestselling titles, such as Gather Together in My Name (1974), And Still I Rise (1978), and I Shall Not Be Moved (1990). Among her accomplishments, Angelou wrote the screenplay and composed the score for the 1972 film Georgia, Georgia. Her script, the first by an African American woman ever to be filmed, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. She made numerous television and film appearances, in Alex Haley's Roots (1977) and John Singleton's Poetic Justice (1993), among others. The feature film, Down in the Delta, was Angelou's directorial debut.\n\nAngelou composed and read her poem \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" at President William (Bill) Clinton's first inaugural ceremony in 1993. Angelou served on two presidential committees; was awarded the Presidential Medal of Arts in 2000 and the Lincoln Medal in 2008; and has received three Grammy Awards. Despite never attending college, she received over thirty honorary degrees from universities across the nationa. Angelou died in 2014, leaving a legacy of artistry for generations to come.\n\nThe Maya Angelou papers consist of original manuscripts, computer generated typescripts, galleys, and proofs of published work such as I Know why the Caged Bird Sings, Hallelujah the Welcome Table, I Shall Not Be Moved, A Song Flung Up to Heaven, Heart of a Woman, and All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, among others, as well as manuscripts for unpublished work and dozens of poems. Additionally, there is personal and professional correspondence with such notable figures as James Baldwin, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, Mari Evans, Rosa Guy, Coretta Scott King, Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach, Julian Mayfield, Malcolm X, and her editors, to name a few.\n\nAlso significant are requests to read or perform her work at universities and other organizations, and material related to various organizations' boards and committees on which she participated. Additionally, there are office files; teaching material, such as syllabi and reading assignments; and materials pertaining to Angelou's Hallmark greeting card series. There are a large number of subject files on various individuals, organizations, geographic locations, publications, and schools. Lastly, there is a considerable amount of material about Angelou and includes newspaper clippings, magazine articles, reviews, and other printed material regarding her publications and appearances..\n\nThe Maya Angelou papers are arranged in five series:\n\nThis first series contains information about Angelou's personal life, including items from her grandmother and uncle, such as a will and financial records; visas for Egypt; correspondence with her mother, son, and other family members; and various awards and honors, including honorary degrees, that she received over the years.\n\nThis series is divided into five subseries: (1) Personal; (2) Professional; (3) Agents and publishers; (4) Regrets; and (5) Fan mail, the last of which is restricted until 2030. The personal subseries includes letters, emails, faxes, and telegrams to and from friends and colleagues, including James Baldwin, Coretta Scott King, Julian Mayfield, and Dolly McPherson. Many of the items in this subseries overlap with the professional subseries, but are included here because Angelou had close relationships with the individuals before any professional aspects arose. The same occurs with the professional subseries; Angelou became friendly with many of the individuals associated with organizations in which she participated, but after becoming involved professionally. Most of the professional correspondence involves requests for donations, permissions to publish, or requests for participation in an event or performance. Both the personal and professional subseries are organized alphabetically by last name of individual or name of organization, family, or publication. The agents and publishers subseries consists of correspondence with the three literary agents with whom Angelou worked; most of these files also include contracts for publications and promotional events. This material is arranged alphabetically by agent's name. The publishers' correspondence also is arranged alphabetically by publisher's name, although Random House, as the main publisher of Angelou's work, is first. Most of these files also contain contracts. Most of the publishers, excluding Random House, published paperback, revised, or translated editions of Angelou's published work; additionally, many of these publishers requested quotes or reviews from Angelou about other authors' work. The regrets subseries contains correspondence related to event participation; Angelou marked \"no\", \"sent regrets\", or \"booked\" to indicate that she declined these invitations. In some cases, the events were cancelled, and the related correspondence is included here.\n\nThis series is comprised of all aspects of the writing process, from handwritten first drafts to final edited proofs, for Angelou's most well-known publications, including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Letter to My Daughter. Additionally, there is a large number of unpublished work, including poems, essays, and articles. This series also consists of work by others, mostly by friends and colleagues or from publishers requesting quotes or comments.\n\nThis series contains material related to Angelou's professional activities, such as public appearances, participation on boards and committees, a collaboration with Hallmark, work by her asssistants, teaching material, and research material. The first subseries, appearances and engagements, includes public appearances, participation on boards and committees, and performances; this material mostly consists of printed matter, such as programs and flyers for lectures and performances, and committee- and board-related memos and minutes from various organizations. Additionally, there is some correspondence related to these appearances, mostly involving schedules, travel itineraries, and in some cases, contracts. The second subseries relates to her collaboration with Hallmark; Angelou worked with the company in the early 2000s on a line of greeting cards and accessories. The third subseries involves material from her office, such as correspondence from and with her assistants; party invitations and planning; travel itineraries and schedules; and phone, fax, and mail logs. The teaching files subseries mostly includes material from Wake Forest University, where she spent most of her academic career. This material contains course syllabi, reading lists and material, class rosters, and faculty memos. Finally, the research material is organized as subject files, with subgroups created by Angelou; this material mostly consists of printed matter, such as publications, clippings, brochures, and programs.\n\nThis series includes all printed matter about Angelou; the majority of the files contain newspaper and magazine article clippings of her interviews and appearances. Some clippings contain quotes by Angelou or refer to her in some way. In addition, this series includes publicity, such as advertisements for Angelou's work and public appearances. There also are numerous reviews of her work, and a large amount of clippings about President Bill Clinton's inauguration ceremony and Angelou's inauguration poem, \"On the Pulse of the Morning\". In many instances, the original clippings are included but there are also a number of photocopies."
