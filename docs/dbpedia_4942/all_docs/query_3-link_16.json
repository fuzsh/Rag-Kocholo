        "text": "Shaun Illingworth: This begins an interview with Lieutenant General Robert E. Kelley on April 5, 2004, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with Shaun Illingworth ...\n\nMichael Miranda: ... Michael Miranda ...\n\nSandra Stewart Holyoak: ... Sandra Stewart Holyoak.\n\nSI: General Kelley, thank you very much for coming in today and sitting down with us. To begin, could you tell us a little bit about your father and his background? He was from Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nRobert E. Kelley: Yes. My father was born in 1893. ... I don't know whether he was born in New Canaan or born in Stamford, but I think New Canaan. He attended Rutgers. ... There's a little confusion with regard to exactly when he started, because he supposedly was in the Stamford High School Class of 1915. ... New Canaan didn't have a high school in those days, so, they went from New Canaan to Stamford to high school. He set a scoring record in the State of Connecticut in football that stood for fifty years. He came to Rutgers and, supposedly, was in the same class with Paul Robeson. He's listed in varying places, in the Class of '20, in the Class of '19, but he left Rutgers in '19, the Fall of '19. What had happened was that the war, of course, occurred in '18, and I'm not sure when he left school and went into the Army. He never went overseas. There was some reference, my brother keeps up with a lot of this stuff ... that Corporal Kelley came back and was practicing again in ... the fall of, sometime, and he was behind in ... academics. ... So, they set up a program in the summer, which I think was the summer of 1919. Let's see, so, [if] he started in '16, '17, '18, '19 would have been his graduating year, but, if he's playing in '19, there's some confusion here. ... He was supposed to be captain of the football team in 1919. He was president of his class. He was Cap and Skull. He was ... a founder of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and he had been Second-Team or Third-Team All-American in football in 1917. They didn't ... allow him credits ... from a program that was set up for him at Johnson and Johnson [Company]. ... Col. Loren Loree, who was a Rutgers trustee ... and owner of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, said, \"Don't worry about that, Frank,\" and so, he transferred to Yale and played football at Yale. According to one of the early Directors of Athletics here at Rutgers University, he was the only ... individual he knew ... that had been Second- or Third-Team All-American at two different schools. There's been a number of people that have been First-Team at two different schools, but he was ... either Second- or Third-Team, and graduated from Yale in 1921. The interesting story about him is the one with Paul Robeson. ... My brother's done a bunch of ... research and ... most recently, read Paul Robeson, Jr.'s book, in which he names Frank Kelley as the guy that stepped on his [Robeson, Sr.'s] hands. That's sort of an interesting story, but ... all the other reports on that ... don't name anyone. ... According to my mother ... Robeson and my father were very good friends. ... As you know ... my father is in the Rutgers Football Hall of Fame. If you've done your prelim work on this, I'm probably just singing to the choir here. ... In fact, all the various reports in various publications ... sort of wonder whether it ever happened at all. In fact, a guy named [Alfred] Neuschafer, who was on that team, I think he was [on the] 1915 or '16 team, said ... he never knew anything about this story. ... My father was a pretty tough guy, I think. ... So, I'm inclined to go ... either way, but I met Paul Robeson's son at a banquet here at Rutgers, when they honored ... his dad at one of the Hall of Fame football banquets, which were a bigger thing than they are now. ... I went over and introduced myself to him and he was a little, I don't know how to say this, but, having learned about the way it was in ... his book, I didn't understand, at the time, why he was sort of a little, rude, is probably the word I would use. I mean, he just sort of was [rude]. ... You know, he probably ... thinks more about it than I did, you know, in terms of the significance of it, but ... Paul Robeson is a great Rutgers story. ... When I accepted the ... award for ... my father ... being inducted into the Rutgers University Football Hall of Fame, I said that Rutgers and Robeson and football were all part of my growing up. So, I may sound like I know a lot about 1917, but I really don't know much about it, except [that] Harry Rockafeller, of course, was the Director of Athletics when I was here and probably [was] the reason why I came to Rutgers. The only reason I came to Rutgers was because I ... wasn't accepted at Yale. [laughter] That's the only place I wanted to go. I was accepted at Penn and Columbia and William and Mary. ... I got a scholarship at William and Mary, Penn didn't offer me a scholarship, and Rutgers. When I came down and met Harry Rockafeller, he gave me an Upson Scholarship, and so, that's why I came here. ... My mother had established the ... idea that we would all ... go to college, but ... how you did that was up to you. [laughter] Mine was playing football and that was a big driver in my growing years. So, another point about my father ... after Yale, he came back here and coached at Rutgers, under [George] Foster Sanford, who he had played for. ... Then, he went to work for Loren Loree at ... the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. ... That's why I was born in Albany, New York, because that's where he was the trainmaster. He married Helen Parker, who was from Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The interesting thing about that, that you probably don't know, let's see if I can ... check your history ... ofRutgers. The first land given for Rutgers University was given by James Parker, from Perth Amboy, New Jersey. ... One of my brother's daughters-in-law is doing some work on the Parker side of the family. The Kelley side, we know pretty well ... going back to the Potato Famine in [Ireland]. I've been to Castlewellan ... in County Down, where our family came from, but the Parkers, that's different. ... Parker is a very interesting name in New Jersey, as well as in [American history]. ... John Parker was one of the first ... soldiers killed in the Revolutionary War, at Concord Bridge, but she [Helen Parker] also ... went to a normal school [teacher's college]. She was a teacher. I'm not sure if it was Trenton State or one of the normal schools, and then, [she] did some study here, as did my brother's [father's] sister, Rose, ... and my uncle, Larry, came here in 1928; I think he flunked out at Georgetown. ... I think my dad got him into Rutgers and he played some football here, but he wasn't ... at the same level as my dad. ... I'm not sure he ever finished, but ... he was here when Ozzie Nelson, [Rutgers College Class of 1927], was here, in the late '20s, along with ... (David Morris?), who was a tackle, and then, later ... a lawyer in New York City. He's dead now. He was a terrific guy. He was beaten up on the streets of New York when he was eighty; lived in New York for years, as a lawyer. ... This guy, if you haven't ... included him, from a history point of view, you should, because he ... was very much involved with international affairs and represented a number of companies, both from South America and from Europe. ... He was a cousin of David Werblin, \"Sonny\" Werblin, who I got to know a few years before his death. ... My mother was from Perth Amboy and ... I don't know what the sociology thing of it is ... but they were ... marrying sort of late. They married in 1928. My father ... they thought he had tuberculosis at one time, and so, he was in a ... hospital up in New York State at some time during his life, before high school. So, if you look at 1893, [when he was born], you know when he was at Rutgers, you know he was in his late twenties when he graduated from Yale in 1921, and they didn't marry until 1928. So, he's about, almost what? twenty-seven [or twenty -eight when he graduated from Yale]? ... She was ... [born in] ... 1898, so, she was thirty. ... They had five children, of which I'm the third, four boys and a girl.\n\nSI: Your father was a Roman Catholic. From studying the history of Rutgers, I get the impression that Catholics were not as openly accepted then. It was more of a Protestant school. Did he ever talk about that?\n\nRK: Well ...I have very few ... memories of my father, just glimpses of my father. I'm sure I talked to him, but ... I was only six when he died. So ... I don't know if there was any problem ... with religion. ... [From] all of the things that were passed on to me from my mother, and there are a lot, ... it was ... [that] he was very well-respected and well-received. ... I don't know if it was a problem at all. I'm sure there was, ... if you just look at society at the time, there's no question about the fact that after ... the immigration of the late nineteenth century that there was ... continuing problems of assimilation. My grandfather was the first selectman in the town of New Canaan and, if you don't know New Canaan, Connecticut at all, it's a very affluent town about sixty miles outside of New York City. He ... led the planning of New Canaan that established the size of the village, one and two-acre zones, and then, not more than two stories and colonial architecture. So, [when] you go to New Canaan ... it's a very classic town. It's not on the main line, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad that goes to Boston. It's a spur that comes out from Stamford to New Canaan. So, there are not a lot of big highways running through it. [Interstate] 95 goes through Darien and Westport, Norwalk and Greenwich, and Stamford. ... I have read one letter from my father to my grandfather in which the language in this letter was striking, in that he had just been promoted, I think to trainmaster, and so, he was writing him and saying how much he had appreciated his father's guidance. ... It was so formal, that it really surprised me. ... My grandfather had the nickname of \"The General,\" which is sort of an interesting thing, given my background, but he really ... ran things. ... Of course, he came from a family of five sons, I mean, five brothers, and he had fourteen children, seven sons and seven daughters. So, my father came from a huge family, so, there probably had to be some formal order there. [laughter] ... That's sort of the context in which it was done. My father ... was the first ... in his family to go to college, but not ... in the extended family, ... others were lawyers and teachers, etc. ... You're Cap and Skull?\n\nMM: Yes, sir.\n\nRK: Nice tie. [laughter] [Editor's Note: Michael Miranda wore a Cap and Skull tie during the interview.]\n\nMM: Thank you, sir.\n\nRK: ... My dad ... was captain-elect of the 1919 football team and Cap and Skull and I was captain of the '55 team and, also, Cap and Skull, which is ... a little unusual.\n\nMM: Nice family history.\n\nRK: Yes, but I haven't sent any sons to Rutgers. [laughter] ...\n\nSI: You grew up in Albany, New York.\n\nRK: No. I was born there, in 1933, and I lived there until my father died in 1940. ... Then, we moved to New Canaan, Connecticut in the fall of 1940.\n\nSI: What do you remember about those early years? Do you remember anything about Albany?\n\nRK: Oh, sure, of course I do. ... We lived at 1027 Washington Avenue. ... My godfather was Dr. Arthur Wallingford, who played football at Holy Cross, and ... his son became a doctor as well. In fact, his dog had a litter of cocker spaniels and I got to pick out ... our cocker spaniel. Her name was Lady and we used to sleigh ride on the hill next to us. I think it was, at that time, sort of out from [the city]. There weren't a lot of houses beyond ... where we lived. ... What do I remember? I remember my mother coming home and telling me that my father had died. I can remember sitting and listening to a football game with my father, because he was always interested in football. He played a little professional football under different names. There's a lot of different rules in those days, and so, he played [in] a lot of places. He and Dr. Wallingford, Arthur Wallingford, used to go off on weekends and play football, professionally. ... But I don't know when or where.\n\nSI: Do you have any impressions of what the Depression was like?\n\nRK: My mother used to talk about that. The Depression really didn't affect us in the railroad [industry] for some reason. ... In 1938 ... I can remember going by train to New York City, to the New York's World Fair ... on a sleeper, overnight, and we used to go up on ski trains to North Creek, in the winter, and we would go to Saratoga Lake in the summer, and to Lake George. ... My father wasn't wealthy, by any stretch of the imagination, but I think he was ... certainly well-paid and we lived comfortably. ... My mother sort of gave the impression that the Depression didn't affect us, for some reason.\n\nSI: Did you observe the effects of the Great Depression, say, in Albany? Was it the kind of place where people sold apples on the street?\n\nRK: I don't have a clue about that. ... A couple of other glimpses, ... he worked in a high building, which is located right as the railroad came into Albany, across the Hudson River, and he was up on about the tenth floor, because I can remember going up all those flights of stairs to his office. ... [laughter] The other place I remember is, there was a school there and it had sort of a glass [façade]. It ... looked like a hot house. ... It had glass walls. ... I don't know what it was exactly, but ... it was one of those things that stood out. I have no impression at all of the Depression. ... I can remember we had a flat tire ... on a bridge one Saturday night, and I was in pajamas ... ones that you wear with the feet in them, [laughter] and standing on the bridge there for some reason. I don't know where we were going and I don't know how long we were there, [laughter] but I remember the flat tire, and I can remember going to get ice cream with my dad. ... I still like ice cream. [laughter]\n\nSI: Just out of curiosity, when you were a child, were you interested in aviation?\n\nRK: That's sort of an interesting question, because, during the war ... airplanes were always flying over our house. ... We'd count the number of B-17s, or the number of this or that, that was going over to Europe. ... Grumman is now in (Bethpage?) ... out on Long Island at that time, and we had an airplane crash in our town. ... It went down about a mile ... from where I lived, crashed into this house. Of course, we went down there to all see that. ... I can remember ... always being interested in the war, and in aviation, but, ... when I was here at Rutgers, I don't think I ... went out and flew in the Air Force ROTC program until my senior year, because I didn't have time, to be perfectly honest with you. ... Then, I said, \"Gee whiz, maybe ... if I'm going to be a pilot, I'd better find out what it's like to fly.\" [laughter] But ... the football team flew from Newark Airport ... to Utica to play Colgate in my junior year. That's where I got this; you can't see this scar because Doc [Hyman] Copleman, [noted New Jersey cardiologist and long-time Rutgers Football Team doctor], did a great job, but I took a cleat up through [my nose]. We didn't wear facemasks in those days. I took a cleat up through my nostril and just ripped up my nose. ... That's how I always remember Colgate. I don't like Colgate. [laughter] ... Flying airplanes was not [that important then]. ... I didn't go out and ... get a private license, didn't do a lot of flying. We were all interested in flying, but, you know, we didn't know anything about it.\n\nMM: Which schools did you attend before Rutgers? Did you go to the Peekskill Military Academy?\n\nRK: Yes. Well, I went to all [the] public schools in New Canaan, and ... in looking back at it, I was really ahead a year. I graduated from high school when I was seventeen and all I wanted to do was play football ... in college. ... That was the real driving and motivating force for me. So, ... I sort of decided that I was going to take a post-graduate year pretty early on, ... because I needed ... to put on weight, grow. I was sort of a late developer. I was cut from the football team as a sophomore in high school. ... I weighed 118 pounds and I was ... probably about five-six or -seven. I also was cut from the basketball team in my sophomore year. ... I did earn a letter in tennis, because I was a good tennis player. I started tennis early. The next year, I made the football team, but I really wasn't that much bigger. I probably weighed 145. [I] was ... [the] number six man on the basketball team, and, then, I lettered in track and tennis. ... The next year, I started on the football team, [and] was high scorer on the basketball team, and captained both the track and tennis teams. You won't believe this, but I jumped center on the basketball team. [laughter] ... We won the Class C State Championship in football ... but one of the guys had lied about his age. ... He was nineteen, and so, we had to ... take a loss in all those [games] and give back the State Championship, and [we] didn't get to go to the State Basketball Championship, which ruined my entire life. [laughter] So, I went to Peekskill Military Academy. ... I ... was thinking about going to West Point. ... So, when I got there, and they changed the rules, ... I couldn't play in all the football games or basketball games or lacrosse games ... because they had a new rule that said post-graduates couldn't [play], even though I was only seventeen when I ... started there. ... You know, it's one of those things in which I don't know how to account for it, but I ... was a year behind where I ... should have been in age. So, I went to Peekskill Military Academy. ... It was great experience for me. ... I never had problems in academics. ... So, that gave me a chance to really prepare, and so, it was a good prep year for me. ... Dr. (Scott?) was great. ... Every week, we had to write a précis of a piece that he gave us. ... It was a good academic experience and preparation for me, and that applies for when I got to Rutgers, because, after being there a year, I said, \"Well, I'm not sure I want to go to West Point,\" and so, I ended up coming to Rutgers. ... We were down here for early football and ... 135 guys turned out, ... all dressed out on the football fields out there on the Heights, and I said to myself ...\"I'll never make this team.\" One hundred thirty-five is an important figure, because, four years later, there were only nine of us still playing. ... Most of them were gone after the first semester, some very good football players, but, academically, the attrition rate was incredible. ... But, I didn't have any problems academically. In other words ... I was prepared for college, compared to my contemporaries, and we matriculated a day early. ... That ... is the story I was going to tell you about, how I got in the Air Force. We're going through this line selecting courses, it's just a bunch of desks along a corridor ... and ... upperclassmen sitting behind the desks. I come to this one sign that says, \"ROTC,\" and this guy said, \"What do you want, Army or Air Force?\" ... I said, \"I'm not sure I want either.\" He said, \"Listen, kid, this is a land-grant college. You've got to have two years, required, ROTC.\" I said, \"Oh.\" I said, \"Do they drill?\" Now, I'd been up at Peekskill Military Academy ... so, I'd been drilling. I knew how to do the manual of arms, and he said, \"Yes. They drill on Tuesday afternoons, over here in Buccleuch Park.\" I said, \"Oh.\" I asked, \"Do they carry rifles?\" He replied, \"The Army does. The Air Force doesn't.\" I said, \"Put me down for the Air Force.\" ... That's a true story, and that's how I got in the Air Force. [laughter] About four years later, I was the cadet colonel ... the wing commander. ... So, I didn't do too badly, but that's another story, but my beginning was a little bit off track.\n\nMM: You did not go in thinking that you would become a career officer.\n\nRK: Oh, no. I went into the Air Force ... after I graduated. I was a Distinguished Military Graduate and the outstanding ROTC cadet, and all that stuff, and so, I got to flying school ... with the first group out of college in 1956, and that was important, because, ... the service academies were really running the Air Force, West Point in particular, and so, the cutoff date for the Class of '56, for promotion, would be 30 June every year. ... West Point would graduate on the 7th of June, just like we would, ... but their date of rank would be the 7th of June. ... Our date of rank wouldn't start until July. ... So, all of the guys from the Class of '56 at West Point, good friends of mine, got promoted to captain a year ahead of me, or to first lieutenant a year ahead of me, because of that ... cutoff. So, I entered the Air Force, I think my date of rank was the 7th of July, and I reported to Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas on the 13th. ...\n\nSH: After your father passed away, how did your mother take care of the family?\n\nRK: ... We moved to New Canaan, which was a tough decision for her, but that was where we had an extended family, and she used my father's life insurance to build us a house. My grandfather had a lot of land, and ... gave us the land for this house. ... The house was built in 1940 and we moved in the summer and all the kids were ... farmed out to ... uncles and aunts. ... I was with my Uncle Johnny, which was right next to \"the little, red schoolhouse,\" where I would go to school for the next ... four years, and that's a story in itself. ... From my grandfather's house to where we lived, across the lots, was probably a quarter mile, but he owned all the land between Carter Street, Silvermine Road and Clapboard Hill. ... He was a landscape architect that did all the ... planting on the Merritt Parkway; he and his brother, who owned a similar type of operation, a nursery operation inDarien, Connecticut. ... So, to answer your question, I went to the Little Red Schoolhouse, which was a one-room school. ... This sounds like ... we're in the middle of nowhere, something that ...Willa Cather ... would write. ... The town of New Canaan ... was very affluent ... because of its location ... and proximity to NYC. ... The Little Red School was one of the last one-room schoolhouses in the United States. ... In fact, they kept it open into the early '60s, because my aunt, my Aunt Mary, who was old enough to be the teacher of my father, was the teacher until she retired in the early '60s. ... The school had a pot-bellied stove. I was ... the only boy of four in my class. The ... three girls were Virginia Fazy, Anna Mae Kelly, (not a relation), and Valerie Hiss, who was the niece of Alger Hiss. ... His family home was in New Canaan. ... There were about thirty students in the school ... all from families in the area. ... Tommy (McClain?) happens to be a guy who was a couple of years ahead of me and went to Yale. ... I guess he did pretty well at Yale. Somebody said to him ... \"Where did you prepare?\" He said, \"I learned everything I needed to know at the Little Red Schoolhouse.\" [laughter] ... One of the other [students], Anna Mae Kelly's younger brother, was a general in the Army. In fact, he was a civil engineer in the Gulf, inKuwait, ... after the First Gulf War.\n\nMM: It is a small world.\n\nRK: Yes, it is. ... I went to ... kindergarten and first grade in Albany ... before we moved to New Canaan.\n\nSH: Your father's extended family took care of you.\n\nRK: Oh, yes. That's exactly right. ... It was a very important ... support factor, no question about it. Today, ... given that mobility to a birthright, ... you just don't have that kind of ... support ... but it was terrific and it made a big difference.\n\nSH: Were you involved in the Boy Scouts at all?\n\nRK: Oh, I was a Cub Scout and got all those things ... Wolf and Bear and all that stuff, and Arrows and ... joined the ... Boy Scouts at eleven or twelve. My older brother was a Boy Scout. ... I don't think he ever became an Eagle Scout, but ... I know he was a Life Scout. I was a Tenderfoot, and I'm not sure I ever got to be a Second Class [Scout], but ... that was the end of my Boy Scout career. ... We were always ... out hunting and what have you, ... traipsing through the woods, playing and ... catching snakes. We found a snake one time in ... the brook behind our house. ... My brother, Brian, and I were going to ... school and there was a snake down there, a garter snake, and ... it had ... swallowed a frog. So, we captured the garter snake. We thought, \"We ... could use it for science project at school.\" [laughter] So, we took it ... to school ... which had an outdoor well, ... a pump, and so, we're out there ... trying to save the frog; squeezing the frog out of the snake. [laughter] My Aunt Mary didn't think that was such a good idea. [laughter]\n\nMM: Were you able to save the frog?\n\nRK: No. It had long since gone. [laughter]\n\nSH: What do you remember about World War II? Do you remember Pearl Harbor?\n\nRK: Oh, yes. ... We were going to church. It was a Sunday afternoon and it was about four o'clock in the afternoon and I was sitting there, listening to the radio. ... They interrupted the radio program to announce thatPearl Harbor had been attacked. ... So, as I went out to the car ... and said, ... \"There's a big announcement on the ... radio about war. ... The Japanese have attacked us at Pearl Harbor,\" and ... the adults said, \"What?\" [laughter] ... That's how I heard about Pearl Harbor and, of course, we followed the course of the war. ... We were very conscious of it. ... We saved dimes and ... tin foil, cans, paper. ... All of the mothers and women ... did canning and ... it was a big thing and, at the end of the war, there were parades ... through the town ... [with] the fire engines and ... cars ... exciting times!\n\nSH: Do you remember rationing at all?\n\nRK: ... Absolutely, Spam, I can hardly believe ... people ... eat Spam today. [laughter] ... We had so much ... Spam [that] it would just drive you nuts, but ... we were all that really involved in rationing. ... It's much different ... today. ... Here, we have a war going on, and nobody knows that there's a war going on, ... but during World War II, it was very much in our [lives] ... gasoline as well as food rationing. [Editor's Note: General Kelley is referring to the War in Iraq that began in 2003.]\n\nSH: Were any members of your family involved in the war?\n\nRK: ... I'm one of the youngest of ... the generation that fought in World War II. ... I was too young, I was twelve when the War ended. ... I've always felt that one of the reasons ... I volunteered ... to go to Vietnam was that ... I didn't get into combat in World War II. ... But I had cousins in service. The oldest one of ... my extended family was killed at Anzio. He was a lieutenant in the Army. David was a Marine. Dick was a paratrooper, jumped ... all the major jumps ... including D-Day. ... He was a wild guy. ... My uncle joked that he had zippers on his stripes. He went up to sergeant, down to private, back up to sergeant so many times. [laughter] ... All those old enough, served in the Navy. ... My Uncle Walter was in ... the Merchant Marine; ... attacked ... by Allied [forces] ... near Sicily or ... Anzio, or one of those places in Italy. I've forgotten exactly where that was, and then, of course, he made a number of crossings ... to England and to Europe with ...\n\nSI: Convoys?\n\nRK: Convoys, yes. ... World War II was a big thing and ... we were all always following what was happening in the war.\n\nSH: When they came back, did they talk to you about their experiences?\n\nRK: Not really. ... Most of them were older and they were getting on to their life or off to college. ... You'd see them at [family gatherings]. ... There was always on the Fourth of July ... a big party at my grandfather's house, and so the whole family would come together. ... The kids ... were sort of separated from the adults, and so ... I really wouldn't say that we knew anything ... or very much about ... their personal experiences ... except vignettes. ... Someone in my mother's family used to complain, [he] was in on the staff ... a typist or something, in [General Douglas] MacArthur's headquarters, and so, he had nothing good to say about MacArthur. [laughter] However, if you've read [William] Manchester's book ... I'm not sure what chapter it is, but you can go through it and pull this out, [from] The American Caesar. ... In there, it points out that more people were killed in the Battle of the Bulge, ... were lost in the Battle of the Bulge, US, than all of MacArthur's battles in the Pacific combined. That's an amazing ... fact to me, an amazing point. It says something about MacArthur. I've always thought he was a great [leader], ... one of the truly great ones. ... It might be the time to say this. The military leadership from World War II, because ... it was a world war, ... the military leadership was very ... respected. ... I think you can probably trace the change in attitudes to the Truman-MacArthur problem in Korea. ... We have created, in the Department of Defense, what I call \"the layer of mush.\" If you're ... really are interested in national security, don't go to one of the service academies, go to Yale or Harvard or Princeton, because you can get to be Secretary of Defense. ... Even though the Goldwater-[Nichols] Act of ... 1986 or '7 [1986] gives direct input from the Chairman [of the Joint Chiefs] to the President, it never ... happens. The question is always, \"What can you do?\" not ... \"Should you do this or not?\" and so, from a military strategy point of view, or from a defense strategy point of view, a national security strategy perspective, ... military input is filtered by the civilian layer of mush. ... We did a terrible thing when we got rid of firing squads. ... If I were Secretary of Defense, I would shoot [Paul] Wolfowitz, [Douglas] Feith, [Richard] Perle and ... the entire staff that's got us in this Iraq thing. ... It's absolutely incredible to me, but I think it goes back to ... Truman, as well as ... President Lyndon Johnson, during the Vietnam War. Every ... officer he had in a senior leadership position, he had something he could use against them. ... The Air Force Chief of Staff ... was an alcoholic, plus the fact that he had ... a string of ladies. ... Johnson had something on all of them. ... No one resigned. ... Ron Fogelman, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, ... resigned in the '90s because he couldn't support the policy [of the Clinton Administration]. ... It was like ... \"yesterday's news\" ... a twenty-four-hour news cycle and, \"Phew, it's gone.\" In fact, you might not even know that he resigned. Most people didn't. ... \"Oh, he resigned? Well, isn't that interesting?\" Well, at least there is a precedent for it now. Up to that time, there was no precedent, but the one thing that I would say about the Vietnam War is the fact that the senior leadership did not resign. They didn't stand up to the politicians. If wars are too important to be left to generals, the Vietnam War ... proved that it was too important to be left to politicians! ... The most serious problem ... we have in our country ... is our ability to attract competent, qualified people to government. I was asked to speak to ... the Governor of Pennsylvania; ... he wanted to establish some initiatives ... to making state government more efficient. So, I went ... to Harrisburg, ... met with the Governor, and I said, \"Well, now, Governor, what's your concept of running the state?\" and there was a long pause. ... He said, \"No one's ever asked me that question before.\" ... Isn't that a fundamental question? \"How are you going to run [the] government?\" One of the reasons that Condoleezza Rice [the National Security Advisor at the time of the interview] is in trouble is because they had no clue about how to run National Security. ...\n\nSH: Is this the same man that is to be head of Homeland Security?\n\nRK: No. ... That's Tom Ridge. This is \"Fast Eddie.\" [laughter] He has been speeding on the highway, so, that's why we call him \"Fast Eddie.\" [laughter] He was called that before he ... was stopped for exceeding the speed limit, [Edward G.] Rendell, the Governor [of Pennsylvania]. ... The thing is ... you've got to ask those ... tough questions, and most of the politicians don't have a clue. They don't have a clue about how the government works, and so, they take ... a quick course and they're very smart people, but they don't really have an idea about, \"How do you run things? How do you make it happen? ... Are you an output-oriented guy? ... Are you results oriented, or are you input [and] let it all sort of take care it itself? What is your strategy for ... running the operation?\" ... Look at our government. One of our problems is that the government, the way was designed, the federal government, we didn't trust government, so, we cut it up and we put it in all different parts. ... It was designed to be inefficient and ineffective and, here we are, two hundred years later, and we want it to be efficient and effective. ... We've got to make some decisions about ... \"How are we going to do that?\" and then, \"How do you measure it?\" If you can't measure it, you can't manage it, and so, ... \"What are the measures for your government?\" I believe we have too much government, and ... guess who's paying for that? You and I. Every day, the American people have to pay for government, and, we don't have a say in it, really. ... You vote every four years, or ... if you are interested in contributing to someone's campaign, you may have some impact, but it's a real problem, and it's a real problem in terms of national security policy. ... Well, not a lot of people ... understand the difference between important and urgent. They treat everything as \"urgent.\" Now, in the case of Condoleezza Rice and the White House, they didn't treat terrorists as \"urgent\" and/or \"important.\" [laughter] ... Now, ... we have a real problem. [Editor's Note: General Kelley is referring to the handling of pre-September 11, 2001, intelligence regarding Al Qaeda by the Bush Administration.] I'm off my track; go ahead.\n\nSH: On the same track, going back to Vietnam, one of the Supreme Court Justices had the bombing targets laid out across his couches and desks and was helping LBJ make the target decisions.\n\nRK: Yes. Well, that makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? ... You want to go to the Vietnam War? Where do you want to go? ... Tell me what you want to ... know. ...\n\nSI: We can always go back to Rutgers.\n\nRK: Well, you ought to ask me about Korea. ... Take them in order, it probably will help you ... later, trying to sort it out. At the end of World War II, I was twelve. ... When I was a student at [the] National War College, a professor, Dr. Marion Levy came ... down from Princeton, to talk to us. ... He's the classic absent-minded professor, a great, big Afghan-scarf around his neck ... orange and black [Princeton's school colors] ... that always sets me off. [laughter] But, anyway, that's around his neck and he has an Afghan hound ... with him on stage. He's ... up on stage and the Afghan hound ... laid down and went to sleep. He went to the blackboard. He took a piece of chalk and, \"Swishhh,\" across the board, [he] stepped back and looked at his beautiful artwork, and then, he took it and he [made] a mark on it. He said, \"The line is human history. The blip is the American experience. You all have to understand that you are the ones who are different. ...\n\n---------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE ONE-------------------------------------\n\nSI: Please, continue.\n\nRK: We're the ones who are different. We stop at stop signs. We have an idea that ... everybody has certain rights; along with those rights comes responsibility. You have rights as an American citizen. Whether you have an Irish name or a Chinese name, or whatnot, it doesn't matter. We may not have treated you as citizens ... through our history, but we have evolved to a point where we think of ourselves as ... citizens with equal rights. ... Ask me about how your government is discriminating ... today, against women. ...\n\nMM: The year you took command of the Air Force Academy [1981] was the year after the first coed class graduated.\n\nRK: That's right.\n\nMM: What were your impressions?\n\nRK: ... The point I'm trying to get at is the world view of \"the Silent Generation.\" There's no US President from our generation. ... A favorite line in college was the \"big boys\" ... and the \"big boys\" were the vets. ... They were still here when I arrived ... and they had a dramatic impact. ... We were sort of pushed aside and ... they, the big boys, said ... \"Shut up, kid. ... You don't have a speaking part.\" ... Now, you go back and you say, \"Okay, there's the World War II group.\" ... There's a generational group, ... they were born old enough [to participate in the war]. ... The World War II group ... starts in about 1926, and they ... go to about 1945, and then, you get the Baby Boomers, from '46 to about '60, and then, you get, what is it, Generation X? and, now, you've got the Millennials. ... The Millennials are going to be eighty million people more than the Baby Boomers and they've always had television and they've always had computers. ... There is this expectation that you'll be leaders and achievers. That's great, nothing wrong with that, but ... you have to understand the context of the times. ... The '60s really changed this country and, in a lot of ways, for the better. ... My generation points back and says, \"An awful lot of things were going on in the '60s,\" ... The '60s did some good things, because it wasn't all perfect back ... in the pre-'60 period. ... One of the worst decisions, international affairs decisions, we made, and I have to say this, and I'll defend it if you want me to, but I'll say it anyway, was Truman's decision to recognize Israel. ... George Marshall ... was against that, if you've read that portion of the history. ... He said, \"You shouldn't confuse internal politics with your economics interests.\" ... If you go back and you look at ... the Zionist movement, the anti-Semitism in England ... they didn't vote for the recognition of Israel, but they supported the movement of displaced persons and Jews into Israel. Now, I've been there twice. I've met Menachem Begin. I've met [Yitzhak] Shamir. I'll tell you something; those are two gangsters. ... If you don't know it, they were terrorists. ... In fact, I had dinner at the King David Hotel and, ... he [Begin] blew it up. ... So, when you start to look at the Palestinian-Israeli question, ... we ... must accept responsibility for that ... situation. ... Have you read Karen Armstrong's book On the Struggle For God: The Study ... the Growth of Fundamentalism, or something like that in the sub-title? [The Battle for God: Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (2000)] It's an excellent book and it deals with Christianity, Islam and Judaism, going back to the Enlightenment period and looking at the growth of fundamentalism. ... I think you'll find it [useful]. [It is] one of the most important books I've read in ten years, because it does give you insight of time, ... place, ... group, and their ideas ... in trying to understand what [Ayatollah Ruhollah] Khomeini was saying in the '78 revolution in Iran. ... It's not just ... [the] fundamentalist thing. ... In the war in Iraq, we have forgotten the idea of self-determination and the rights of a group of people to choose their form of government. Now, I ... believe that ... every people gets the government it deserves, good or bad. ... Now we sit in a situation ... looking at this construct of the Middle East ... of Iran, of Jordan, of Syria, and we ... are acting just like the former colonial powers, British, French, German, Dutch; we're looking just like the British and the French after World War I. ... So, here we are, losing some six hundred men, and women, for what reason? ... We have to ask the right questions. ... That's why I say, ... go back to the fact that Truman wanted to get elected in 1948. ... Everyone thinks Truman was a great guy, now, but that was a bad decision, and the consequences of that action, we're living with, you're living with, and you will live with. Now, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be involved in the world, but ... we seemed to have lost our way with regard to our priorities in international affairs. It seems to me that the first responsibility of government is ... security, national security. ... But, listen, let's make sure we've got our own house in order; ... that our ports, our airfields, our water, our chemicals, our nuclear plants, our infrastructure, are defended. Then, ... let's look around our hemisphere. I bet you don't know there's a terrorist camp in Paraguay. \"Terrorist camps in Paraguay. Oh, that's an interesting thing. I wonder if Condoleezza knows about that?\" ... After North America, our next priority ought to be South America. ... Every President in the twentieth century has said, \"We're going to ... have better relations with South America,\" and we haven't done anything. ... I learned about the terrorist camps when I was down in Uruguay and the CIA chief in the embassy in Montevideo told me about them, so, I can say that with confidence, that I'm not just passing on bad information, and that hasn't anything to do with what we're doing in Columbia. ... So, [the order of priorities], first of all, United States, North America, Western Hemisphere; don't screw up the relationships that have been ... built for so long with regard to Europe and the North Atlantic Alliance, and why not a partnership in the Pacific with the Chinese? The best thing they've [Bush administration] probably done is not attack [North] Korea and gotten us embroiled in something over there ... and made a regional happening occur between China and Japan and South Korea. ... We seem to have lost our way with regard to priorities, and that's the same kind of problem that existed in Vietnam. Okay, back to Korea; in Korea ... I'm in high school and I'm the only failure from the 1950-51 New Canaan basketball team, because all of the other four went into the Marines, and then, they went into the New Canaan police force, and one of them became the chief of police. ... Many in my class went to Korea and ... for some reason ... I don't know how to explain why I didn't, except that ... I was already programmed to go to college, and so, \"Bam,\" I was off to prep school and on to college. ... The mental state was one in which ... if you didn't get on the train and off at the right ... station, it would get interrupted and you'd never get there. So, it was important [to] ... stay on the track and to make sure [that] you ... graduated from high school, went to college. ... That's just the way it was ... structured. So, ... the war in Korea ... had an influence on the fact that I wanted to fly fighters when I went in the Air Force, ... even though there were all these guys telling me, ... the bomber guys, ... \"Go to bombers.\" ... I said, \"Oh, yes, sir,\" and went off to do my own thing. ... During the Korean War ... the Air Force was in transition. ... In 1947, it'd become a separate service ... and we were building airplanes ... moving through the engine development toward ... the supersonic flight. ... First, the F-86, which flew in Korea. It could go supersonic in a dive, but it had a pilot boom out here on the left wing. It would roll as you went through the mach and it really wasn't a supersonic airplane. ... We put a supersonic scoop and an afterburner on an F-100, North American [Aviation] did, and we went supersonic, [Mach] 1.25 or so, in straight and level flight, and then, \"Bam,\" engine development goes ahead, again, and we're going Mach 2 in the [F]-104, a couple of years later. So, we're going through a revolution in engine development, but, what does this mean? ... You've probably seen the movie The Right Stuff. If you read that book, it's not in the movie; my wife, (my first wife, she died in 1993) ... was reading this book and she said, \"You've got to listen to this. Someone's been following us around.\" ... So, she's reading this story about this Navy pilot and his wife, who had gone home on a vacation, and they went to this party and they're driving back, and this is the conversation that they had, in which ... the guy says, \"Boy, ... our friends have really changed. ... So-and-So, ... I just don't understand how he's changed,\" and his wife said, \"No, no, he hasn't.\" ... He pursued that and she said, \"No, no, he hasn't.\" He said, \"What do you mean, 'No, he hasn't?' You were at that party.\" She said, \"No. We've changed. We've been going to funerals.\" ... The point was that in every squadron that I was ever in, we always lost guys. ... You didn't say, \"It was the airplane.\" \"It was Joe,\" because Joe didn't have \"the Right Stuff.\" \"It's not going to happen to me,\" because we're all going to go fly that airplane tomorrow, and the number of engine failures and the number of losses were very high. ... Some statistical things, ... the first six months I was the commander at Nellis [Air Force Base, Nevada], we lost ten airplanes and killed eight guys. Now, that's incredible. ... If I had been the boss, I'd probably have fired me, but he didn't. He stuck with me and we stopped that, but, when you went back and looked at Air Force accidents, there were more people lost in training accidents. ... In World War II, something like 34,000, more than all of the ... loses in combat combined. So ... we were taking people and sending them ... very rapidly to combat. In fact, as I was leaving the [F]-104 program, in 1964, to go to the [Air Force] Academy the first time, ... I was a captain. There was a farewell party at Apple Valley Inn, in Apple Valley, California, and a guy named Bob Worley was there. He was the Air Division Commander; ... he was killed in Vietnam. ... Bob Worley ... was in the group and I was ... saying, \"We need to get more flying time.\" I'm making this pitch about ... I was always wanting to get more and more and more flying time, and so, he allowed me to go on for about five or ten minutes. Then, he said, \"Well, Bob, how much flying time do you have?\" and I said, \"Well, let's see, I've got about, almost a thousand hours in the 100 and almost a thousand in the 104. ... [With] my training time, F-86s, oh, about two thousand, twenty-one hundred hours.\" He said, \"Let me tell you a story. ... It's December 8, 1941. I'm a first lieutenant, squadron commander, at Mitchell Field,\" out on Long Island, \"and I get this message fromWashington, from the headquarters. It said, 'Take your squadron and proceed to Bolling Field as soon as possible and set up the air defense of Washington, DC.' ... I was highest man in my squadron, with three hundred hours. ... Some of us older guys don't understand this business about, 'You've got to have enough flying time.'\" [laughter] So, you've got to put it in perspective, and so, an awful lot of guys went to combat with no experience. I told a guy the other day, a Marine, ... when I was down at Industrial College [of the Armed Forces at Fort McNair], I said, \"The easiest year of my life was flying combat, because I was so well-trained.\" ... I had just finished Fighter WeaponsSchool, which is the Air Force Top Gun school. ... The F-4 Phantom is my third fighter. ... [I had] close to three thousand hours of flying time. Combat was a piece of cake.\n\nSH: Do you want to go back and finish up on Rutgers?\n\nRK: I'm just getting to Rutgers. ... Okay, some of our instructors ... had been in Korea and a couple of guys had been in World War II. ...\n\nSI: Before we discuss that, I wanted to follow up on something you just said. ...\n\nRK: Okay; go ahead.\n\nSI: You said that combat was the easiest year of your life. I read through our interview with Gen. Frederick J. Kroesen, US Army. He also described a high level of training, in the infantry, going into Vietnam, but, as the war went on, the manpower needs of the infantry really precluded that same level of training. Was that ever the case in the Air Force?\n\nRK: Well, in the fighter business, and before I went to Vietnam, I was instructing in F-4s at Davis-Monthan [Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona]. ... When we'd graduate a class, the instructors would sit down and they'd say, \"Okay, ... all these guys have made it through, but are these guys ready to go to combat?\" ... We identified the guys that ... would go to combat. ... Then we identify guys ... that needed a little more seasoning. So, we'd send them to, either ... Europe or the Pacific for a three-year tour, and then, they'd go to Southeast Asia. ... Then, there was a group that was almost as good as the guys that we said would go to combat right away, and we put them in a unit in the States and they would ... go to Vietnam in about six months or a year. ... Finally, there were some guys that we'd say, \"You know, we ought to send them to be forward air controllers.\" [laughter] You know, they ... shouldn't go into the fighter business. ... These were ... conscious decisions ... about ability. Now, the training, of all of those people, was pretty good, but what I'm trying to say is that ... there's differences in the people themselves, in terms of what they bring to the table. ... Some people were coming right out of flying school. ... I had ... three fighter tours, so, I was ... just in a different ... category. ... When you look at the time in Vietnam, we were doing quite a bit of night flying and that was a real change from the pre-'60 timeframe. ... We started doing air-to-ground delivery at night. Before that, we just went out and scared ourselves at night. We were never proficient and, until you become proficient, you don't really realize how poorly you were trained. ... [laughter] ... Going down and doing low altitude work under flares is an interesting business. Today, we have refined the night. We've turned the night into day with the (Lantion?) system and we've done that through a lot of different systems, but, in Vietnam, we had some squadrons who were dedicated to [night flying]. All they did was fly at night ... because we were doing twenty-four-hour operations. ... There were an awful lot of guys who didn't like to fly at night because of this; they ... avoided it if possible. ... In fact, I spent a lot of time trying to convince the wing commander that we ought to designate a squadron to be the night squadron. ... I did a study for him in which I took a year, a period of accidents, not combat losses, just accidents, and all of the accidents occurred at night. All of them occurred in two-seat airplanes. ... The F-4 was a tandem cockpit airplane, pilot in the front, weapons system operator in the back, and you would think that ... would have been safer than a guy who was by himself, but, when things \"go to hell in a hand basket\" the guy in the front has got to be able to handle it and all that crew stuff ... just goes out the window. So, in fact, I was asked a question, when I came back from Vietnam in 1970, ... the developers were wanting to know ... what we thought, what we, the operators at Tactical Air Command, thought should be the right number of pilots in an airplane. ... The Navy has three and four in some of them. ... They came back and, ... a message that I had to answer, ... they asked TAC to address the question of, \"One, two or three?\" ... The way I answered that was, ... based upon my study ... was this: if the aircraft was automated correctly ... and the engineering development and the ergonomics on the inside of the cockpit were developed properly, and your sensors were integrated, one person could do it, but, until that was done, we ... probably needed two, particularly in the deep interdiction, night, all-weather-type systems. ... That's what turned out to be the F-15E ... and the [F]-117, which one of my sons flew in Gulf War I. ... He flew the [F]-111 and then ... came home, checked out in the 117. He led the mission that struck SAM sites in January of '93. ... My other son is an F-16 pilot with the Colorado Guard. He flew in Gulf War II. In fact, he's going over again in June. ... My point is that, at that particular time, Vietnam, I don't think [there was] sufficient night training. ... We qualified ... under flares, but that particular approach was ineffective. ... Looking at the war in Vietnam ... in military terms ... you must go back to 1957. ... You'll ... find a book by [General Maxwell] Taylor called The Uncertain Trumpet. ... In there, he's talking about ... nuclear weapons and what ought to be done in terms of the construction of our Armed Forces. ... Up at the Hudson Institute ... what was his name? he's a brilliant guy, Herman Kahn, was really questioning the utility of nuclear weapons. In other words, \"They're great for a deterrent, but how do you use them?\" ... I started off in a day fighter squadron in Germany, and then, in 1958 we transitioned to nuclear strike and I was ... a special weapons officer. ... In the early '60s period, our conventional capability was really [no different than in] World War II. We had ... five-hundred and seven-hundred-and-fifty-pound bombs with 904 and 905 fuses, which had terrible reliability, and we ... used them throughout the Vietnam War; ... we flew thousands of sorties against the [Paul] Doumer Bridge [in Hanoi]. ... Ten years later, we're taking it out with six airplanes, with the first-generation laser-guided bombs. So, what you see is an effort ... to correct our conventional deficiencies, and so there was ... a lot of testing going on over there; this weapon, that weapon, all kinds of stuff was going on, to develop ... Electro-Optic and Infrared, laser-guided weapons. For instance, in air-to-air missiles, ... I structured the weapons systems evaluation program for Tactical Air Command when I returned from Vietnam ... because our performance of our air-to-air missiles in Southeast Asia was so bad. The AIM-7, which is a radar missile, there was a number of different versions, from C or B and C and E and E-plus and what have you, and, finally, an F, but the design spec for that missile was a .9. In other words, probability of a kill, given a hit, was .9. ... The Vietnamperformance was .12. A friend of mine, who was on the Fighter Force Modernization Study Group with me, John (Madden?), ... should have had eight kills. He had five missile failures. He got three kills. ... The point is that the weapons weren't working all that well and we were doing all kinds of things to improve our conventional weapons capability. ... One of the benefits ... was if you looked at Vietnam as a battle in the Cold War, what we did is ... forced the Russians onto a track ... to match us ... in conventional as well as nuclear capabilities. ... We ran them out of gas. ... They ... couldn't stay the course. We bankrupted them. A friend of mine ... Charlie Hamm, later to be a superintendent at the Air Force Academy, was the defense attaché in Russia. ... He told us about going to ... a Soviet B-1 [Tupolev Tu-160] factory. He said, \"Absolutely state-of-the-art, beautiful. Across the street'sTombstone, Arizona, wooden sidewalks.\" [laughter] ... What a contrast. ... They out spent all of their resources ... trying to keep up with us; ... finally bankrupted themselves. Now, was that our strategy? I don't think so, but ... in the early '80s we were starting to think that it might work. ... If you think about the Cuban Missile Crisis ... I've written a few papers on the Cuban Missile Crisis and one of them ... that needs to be written is, \"What was the truth behind Kennedy's motivation in the Cuban Missile Crisis?\" I've written on the Soviet motivation and they didn't have any missiles. They had seventy above-ground, liquid-fueled missiles that we knew about. An Assistant Secretary of State ... was speaking down in Chattanooga or Nashville and made this speech in which he signaled the fact that we knew, because of our over-flight capabilities, [that] they didn't have ... much of a capability. The real reason they wanted to get those missiles into Cuba? ... John F. Kennedy wanted to get reelected, of course, ... which every President does. ... When asked, ... \"Did we have the conventional capability to take out all the missiles and all the SAMs [surface-to-air missiles] that they had in Cuba?\" Sweeney, [General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., commander of Tactical Air Command], had to say, \"No, we didn't have the capability to do it,\" and he was correct, we didn't have the capability to do it. So, that's another thing that's going on during all the other geopolitical things that's going on during Vietnam. ... We are transitioning, and then, in the aftermath of that ... people will talk about \"realistic training,\" big, big keyword that shows up in the writings ... in the '70s. Well, fighter pilots were always talking about realistic training. ... I can remember the conversations when I was a lieutenant inGermany talking about ... realistic training. ... The way we got realistic training over there was that we just broke the rules, [laughter] and that's the truth. I mean, I can tell you about them. ... General [H. R.] Spicer, who was Seventeenth Air Force commander, ... sent out a message ... it was read in the squadron meeting that morning, \"There'll be no more air fighting between the various ... countries' fighters unless ... all the missions are pre-briefed.\" Well, if you don't know, the weather in Germany, in Europe, it's always gray and cloudy. ... A five-hundred-foot ceiling is a good deal. That's a great day. ... If it gets to eight hundred feet, my God, it must be [that] something's going to happen. Well, that day, [there was] a Polish high, which meant a cold air mass coming off the Arctic, came across Europe, and it was clear, absolutely incredible. Well, if he had looked outside of his headquarters at Ramstein, all there were were contrails. [laughter] ... I remember one of the guys, walking out of the squadron, saying, \"Gee whiz, been an awful lot of pre-briefing going on today.\" [laughter] But the rule was that when you put your wheels up, ... you should be ready to be attacked. ... In fact, the Canadians, ... they were flying the ... Sabre [Canadair Sabre F-86], but they had an [Avro Canada] Orenda engine, and it was really a great performing airplane and they would take-off, four ship [formation], and they'd hold the lead onto the ... deck, and then, they'd pull the thing up and they'd split and they'd be \"checking six,\" [slang for looking behind you], as they came off the ground. I mean, ... they were really good tacticians and it was fun. I mean, it was really a lot of fun being over there, but ... the philosophy was, you weren't supposed to air fight, and, you know, I don't know a fighter pilot that's worth his salt who isn't, every day, trying to get out and get into an air fight. [laughter] ...\n\nMM: General, you spoke earlier about the factors that led you to enroll in Rutgers. Why did you decide to enroll in the School of Education? What influenced you?\n\nRK: I wanted to be a coach. That's one of the things that was sort of always in my mind; that I was going to be a coach. I was very much influenced by a guy named Joe Sikorsky, who was my football coach and track coach atNew Canaan, and I always thought I wanted to be a coach. In fact, the reason I went to the [Air Force] Academy in '64 was to coach. ... I coached the varsity ski team, because I knew which end of the skis turned up, and then, I was the first varsity lacrosse coach. ... I worked directly for the director of athletics and ... I had great success, but learned that there was much more I wanted to do. ... So, I went into [the] School of Education to be a coach.\n\nMM: Are there any specific administrators or professors that stand out in your memories?\n\nRK: No. [laughter] Dr. Lamont, in the English Department; now, the story about Dr. Lamont is that he was probably here when my dad was here. ... He was around a long time. ... The English House used to be down there on College Avenue. ... Dr. Lamont, ... one of those classic absent-minded professors, ... was a tall guy, ... maybe six-two or so, and he had this big overcoat. He had his overcoat on like this, off his shoulders. [laughter] He never could quite get it on, and so, he's standing out in front of the English House, and it's snowing out, and he's looking up and down College Avenue. ... A student named Angelo Iannucci, who was co-captain of the '54 football team, along with [John] Brian O'Hearn, comes walking up the Avenue and he says, \"Dr. Lamont, how are you today? Can I help you with something? You look a little confused.\" Dr. Lamont says, \"Angie, I'm embarrassed.\" ... He had a 1941 Buick, four-door, convertible. He said, \"I know I drove my car today, but I don't know where I parked it, Angie, and the top's down.\" [laughter] So, I remember him. I took British and American Novels from him. He was really pretty good. I've been asked that question ... [about administrators or professors that stand out] recently and ... I can name all the coaches ... and I can name some of the professors, but none of them that had [a major influence]. ... The one thing that I have regrets about at Rutgers is that I didn't take advantage of the academics. ... I was just not turned on academically. ... I mean, I had a rule; ... I would go to every class, and I'm a morning person, so, I set up classes between ... eight o'clock to twelve o'clock, I went to every class, went back to the Chi Psi House ... at 114 College Avenue, and had lunch, would take a nap, go to practice, come back, [have] dinner, study, and, at ten o'clock, I was out. [laughter] I'm serious. ... I'd fall asleep, just, \"boom,\" and so, you know, academically, I just didn't put out at all.\n\nSH: Were you in Chi Psi from your freshman year on? When did you pledge?\n\nRK: Yes, freshman year, yes.\n\nSH: Why Chi Psi?\n\nRK: A guy named Gerry Gabriel, his dad was the director of athletics at Peekskill Military Academy, and he was up there, sitting around the cage one day, and I was talking to him and I said, \"Oh, you went to Rutgers?\" \"Oh, how do you like Rutgers?\" ... I said I had applied there, my dad went there, and all that stuff, and so, when I came down here, I was invited over there. ... Jim Monahan, who was the captain of the ... '51 football team and an all-American baseball player, was a Deke [Delta Kappa Epsilon] and ... my freshman backfield coach. ... He tried to get me over to Deke. ... The fraternities were very important in those days. They were different [than today] and I was from out-of-state. ... We [Chi Psi] had a... higher percentage of out-of-state students. ... All the social life [was centered there] and you lived in the fraternity. ... You ate in the fraternity, you socialized in the fraternity, but you also had other groups ... like the athletic teams. ... On a party weekend, not a big weekend, but just a regular weekend, \"We're going to have a party,\" and you had to get approval for a keg of beer from the Dean of Men. ... [Cornelius] Boocock was the dean, but Kirkpatrick ... was the tall, skinny guy, [who] was the guy that sort of checked up on the things. ... Then, you would go to the various fraternity houses; so, from Chi Psi to Chi Phi, to Deke, to DU, to Zeta Psi, to the Beta House, to the Delta Phi House, you know, you knew all those people. ... It was very interesting. ... At dinner each night you wore ... a shirt and tie ... and it was candlelight, and you sang songs. Afterwards, ... you'd go to a party and you'd play some drinking games, ... you'd chug-a-lug some beer and whatnot, and then, it was all singing. ... They were great parties, fun. In fact, somebody said to me the other night ... \"What kind of party [did you have]?\" ... We were up taking my stepson to look at Yale and Trinity and Amherst and Williams, and we were with him ... for dinner at Amherst. ... [The host] was talking about ... college life. She said, \"Yes, the seventeen-year-old, eighteen-year-old guys just don't know how to put on a party. ... They never have food. All they do is have beer, in a dark room, that's a party, and you can't hear anybody; there's a lot of noise.\" So, I don't know how the parties are today, but living in a fraternity was an important part of college, but, remember, Rutgers then was only three thousand students. It was a ... small school, relatively speaking.\n\nSH: You said that there were still veterans on campus at that point. Were they also involved in the fraternities?\n\nRK: Yes, they were, but ... the vets were ... married, and so, they lived over in the Heights. I mean, here's an interesting story. Jack Jeffers, captain-elect of the 1953 Rutgers football team, ... was a Chi Psi. He was married, so, he didn't live in the fraternity. He was from Schenectady, New York, and he was accepted to vet school at Cornell after his junior year. ... He'd become a starter at quarterback that ... year, and led the team to thirty-three points in eight minutes against Dartmouth. ... [That] year we almost beat Penn State by, I think the score was 7-6. ... It was the 3-5 defensive. ... Anyway, Jeffers was captain of the football team for 1953, but he left and went to Cornell. He was down here as we were getting on busses to go to Harry's Farm, where we used to go for pre-season football. He came down to say goodbye to us, but, you know, it was one of those things that I didn't compute ... but, for him, it was the right thing to do. He later did work on dogs and developed a procedure for replacing ... retinas. ... He's a pretty smart guy.\n\nMM: What was it like to play under legendary, lacrosse coach, Al Twitchell in 1955 and 1956, two big seasons for Rutgers?\n\nRK: Yes, two great ones. Twitchell had been a football coach and Twitchell ... really characterized Rutgers. I mean, ... his whole life was Rutgers, and his wife, Aileen, was a very loud, outspoken ... woman. ... She would come to the games and ... cheer us [on]. ... You have to understand what I brought to the lacrosse field. I mean, the way to explain Twitchell is, well, let me go back; Bob Andrews was a classmate of mine, and he was fromSewanhaka High School, and a great lacrosse player. I mean, he was the best lacrosse player at Rutgers. He ... should have been first team, all-American. He was second team and I was first team, but ... he was really the key. ... Others would say ... it was the combination of the two of us. We were both left-handers. ... In those days, you used wooden sticks and you only went one way, left or right. You know, every once in a while, somebody would go right-handed, but it was unusual. The idea was ... \"Be as good as you can with your left hand.\" ... So, that gave us great balance on offense, and the way to tell the story is this: Monte Montgomery was the captain of the '55 lacrosse team, ... was co-captain with Tom Moffett. ... Monte became a one-star general ... in the Air Force ... and, every once in a while, I'd run into him and we'd talk about ... lacrosse. We had to talk about lacrosse. ... The conversation goes something like this, \"... Twitch was really something.\" ... \"You know, we never had any plays.\" ... \"He never directed anything.\" ... In my senior year, Monte, who had been washed back a year, was coaching with him. Now, he did set up something called a two-two-two, which we used ... as ... our basic offense, and then, on extra man ... I would go in on the crease. ... So, I would be playing on the crease [as] an extra man with whoever else was there, usually Jack Daut. ... Well, in the Mohave Desert one night, I was with a guy named Dick Cavazos, and Dick Cavazos' father was the foreman on the King Ranch in Texas. His brother was Lauro Cavazos. They both played football at Texas Tech. Lauro later became the president of Texas Tech ... and the Secretary of Education. Dick Cavazos went in the Army, was in Korea, overrun three or four times by the Chinese, and [was] a battalion commander in Vietnam. ... When I met him, as a two-star general, he was the most decorated general officer in the United States Army, with six Distinguished Service Crosses and eleven Silver Stars, among others. Anyway, we're sitting there, we're talking about ... \"Who was the best military leader?\" ... Well, somebody liked Eisenhower, another guy liked Patton, and another guy, you know, loved MacArthur; ... I think I said, \"MacArthur.\" Cavazos said, ... \"Well, all those guys are good.\" He said, \"But the best leader, I think, is the guy that, when people go back and ask about what kind of a leader he was, they say, 'What do you mean, leader? We did it ourselves,'\" and that was Twitchell. We all felt we did it ourselves, but he was not ... a lacrosse technician. He was a great leader. He allowed us to develop our own plays. In one of the plays, I used to flip a ball to Montgomery as he'd go behind me, and then, this two-two-two, we worked on that a lot, but ... in terms of, \"What did he teach me?\" I don't think anything. I learned how to play lacrosse from Bob Andrews and I learned that ... in my freshman year. ... The other guys on the team had not played before, so, they are up there learning how to catch and throw the ball and he and I are shooting around the cage and learning how to quick stick [catching a pass and shooting the ball at the goal in one motion]. So, Bob Andrews taught me how to play lacrosse, and we didn't have a lot of [experienced] lacrosse players. We only had about four, four or five guys who'd played it before they came to Rutgers. So, we were very shallow and we lost a game, in my senior year, toSyracuse, and the reason for that was that Jack Daut, who was the year after me ... and who was a great lacrosse player, also from Sewanhaka, he was in the hospital ... with the flu. ... When you took that one piece out ... we didn't have the chemistry. ... We were very strong offensively; we averaged something like sixteen or seventeen goals a game. We didn't know how to play defense. [laughter] ... [Donald H.] Gucker was the goalie. He was pretty good. Art Robinson, who later coached at Williams, was on defense and he was a tackle on the football team, along with Dave Pooley, who was a center on the football team, and George Juergens, who was my roommate. ... His name is George Abbot Juergens. He's the nephew of George Abbot, the producer, from Broadway, of Damn Yankees, Wonderful Town, Pajama Game; a terrific producer, lived to be 107. He'd still produced at a hundred ... [which was] fantastic.\n\nSH: Did you ever get free tickets from him? [laughter]\n\nRK: We used to go into New York, but I don't remember if we got tickets from him or not. [laughter] ... During those years, he was dating Eartha Kitt, at one time.\n\nSH: Did most of the football players play lacrosse to keep in condition?\n\nRK: ... Yes. Well, ... first of all, lacrosse was fun; football was work. Now, I even loved practicing football ... so ... I'm in a different category, but most people didn't like to practice. So, in the spring, if you were playing on a varsity sport, you didn't have to go to spring practice. As a freshman, you did. So, I would go to the lacrosse field with my football gear on. Then, [when] football practice would start, I'd put down my lacrosse stick and go over to the football field and practice football, but, in your upper-class years, sophomore year, junior year, senior year, ... you didn't have to go to spring football. ... That hurt football. You know, it's one of these things, that, today ... you must specialize. You have to be working it all year round. ... ... It was a different world in the '50s.\n\nSH: Was there 150-pound football then?\n\nRK: Yes, there was and it was good. Jack Daut played 150s. ... I'd come from the training tables. We would enter through the backdoor, because ... dinner's going on in the dining room. ... They were still serving, or singing, or something or other. We'd sit around the table. ... I'll never forget, this guy named [David] Zeke Edwards played 150s and he and this other guy, and I've forgotten who the other guy was, maybe Jack Daut, would be sitting there and they'd be having dinner. Dinner would be a plate with a piece of lettuce on it and they'd shake the water off, because ... they had to make [weight], and Zeke ... weighed more than I did. [laughter] I mean, he was 175 pounds and he ... had to play at 155, and so, he was dropping twenty pounds. ... I mean, he's [salivating over food] and they'd do that until Friday, and they'd get on the scales. They'd make weight, or they'd have to ... go in the steam room, and then, they'd come out [and] they'd just [gorge themselves], a wonder if they could run, but, I mean, ... I just never could do that. ... I used to look at it and say, \"Oh, you guys are dedicated.\"\n\nMM: In your junior year, General, you were tapped for Cap and Skull. You mentioned that your father was also a Cap and Skull. What did that honor mean for you?\n\nRK: Yes. Well, because he [was a member], I mean, I knew what Cap and Skull was growing up. I mean, it was something everybody ...\n\nSI: Please, hold that thought.\n\n--------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE TWO-------------------------------------\n\nSI: This continues our interview with Lieutenant General Robert E. Kelley on April 5, 2004, in New Brunswick,New Jersey, with Shaun Illingworth ...\n\nMM: ... Mike Miranda ...\n\nSH: ... Sandra Stewart Holyoak.\n\nSI: Please, continue.\n\nRK: So, it was a big deal. ... I was a little disappointed the next year, when we chose the next class, because, if that was the pattern, it seemed to me it was one of those things in which they tried to pick out ... a representative group from various areas. ... So, I guess I was the jock of our crop. [laughter] ... They always had the president of the class and the student council, and all that kind of stuff. ... I mean, I'm not sure it was as serious as I thought it probably could have been, now, and the reason I say that is that I was familiar with the fact that my dad was in Berzelius at Yale and he had been tapped for Berzelius, and then, tapped for ... Skull and Bones. Now, the difference is, between Cap and Skull [and the secret societies at Yale], and maybe this reflects the fact that I didn't know much about Cap and Skull, in terms of what we were supposed to be doing, but a close friend of mine was in Skull and Bones and, before he was elected, he said, \"Well, you know what they do. ... It's a secret society and they sit down and they plan out their lives, and then, they discuss it ... in a rather objective and brutal way, and say, 'Okay, let's all help each other do that.'\" Now, you could say that's the classic \"old boys\" society, but, you know, both [Presidents] George Bush, Senior and Junior, and as well as [Senator] John Kerry, are Skull and Bones. ... I thought that Cap and Skull sort of would be something like that and it wasn't. So, ... it was a nice honor. I was glad to be in it, but I was disappointed with regard to what I thought it could be and expected it to be.\n\nSH: Were you involved in any other activities on campus?\n\nRK: Well ...\n\nSH: It sounds like you did not have a lot of time.\n\nRK: Well, I didn't have a lot of time, but, ... football and lacrosse obviously took up most of my time. ... I played on an intramural basketball team for the lodge, Chi Psi. I was in the fraternity. I'm not sure ... what jobs I had in the fraternity ... as most of mine were outside the fraternity. I was running the Air Force ROTC program. I made a cadet colonel, but that wasn't all that hard. ... I ran the drill on Tuesday afternoon, had to brief people and that kind of stuff, run parades. How else was I involved on the campus? I don't know. [laughter]\n\nSH: Were there any convocations, lectures or concerts that you remember in the 1950s while you were on campus?\n\nRK: Well, every year, at the end of the year, when we tapped for both Cap and Skull and Crown and Scroll, convocation ... was held in the gym ... so, the whole University got together at that time, and they gave out awards.\n\nSH: Did you go on to Advanced Air Force ROTC?\n\nRK: ... Of course, I was in Air force ROTC for four years. ... As I said, ... from an academic point of view, and probably from a cultural point of view, I was probably sleeping when those things were going on. [laughter]\n\nSH: What about politics on campus? You were here during an election year.\n\nRK: Well, ... from '52 on ... [General Dwight D.] Eisenhower is President. The period of the '50s was pretty quiet ... in terms of politics. ... There's not a lot of ... activity on campus in that regard. ... He ran against Stevenson in '56, Adlai Stevenson. ... Who was it in '52?\n\nSI: I think he ran against Adlai Stevenson twice.\n\nRK: Twice, okay. Yes, well, you can check it out. [Editor's Note: Eisenhower defeated Stevenson in 1952 and 1956 presidential elections.] ... There wasn't a lot of political stuff. I can remember one night, there was a panty raid down here near the Deke House. ... We all ... heard all this noise going on down there, and it was what you didn't do ... \"don't get involved in that\" ... routine. [laughter] I don't know who was doing that, but that tall dean that I have mentioned, or assistant dean, would be the guy that was probably in there, you know, taking care of it. ... You know, activity, political activity, was very [limited]. It didn't happen. I mean, ... there's an old saying about John Kennedy. ... \"What was significant about John Kennedy at Harvard? It's what he didn't do,\" because communism was the big thing going on at that time, but he wasn't involved in it. From a political point of view, around here, again, it was more serious about ... \"What are you doing in class today?\" and, \"What's going on this weekend?\" or, \"What team are you playing?\" ... that kind of business, more than international affairs.\n\nMM: What was the attitude of other Rutgers students towards ROTC cadets at that point?\n\nRK: We were all in it.\n\nMM: Was the Advanced ROTC just considered something that you did for your last two years, just another activity?\n\nRK: Everybody wanted to get into Advanced, because that gave you a deferment. The draft was on. The draft was not over until after I left. So, it was one of these things in which ... if you're out of school, if you were drafted ... ROTC was the way to stay in school. So, everyone; ... when I say \"everyone,\" whether it be the captain of the football team or the president of the class or the student council, ... all of the leaders at the University were involved in the ROTC. ... We had fifteen hundred [cadets] in a school of three thousand, fifteen hundred in the Air Force and about a thousand in the Army. So, are you in the ROTC?\n\nMM: Yes, sir.\n\nRK: You are?\n\nMM: Army ROTC.\n\nRK: Oh, that's too bad. [laughter] ... You can transfer.\n\nSH: How much information were you processing about what was going on in Korea?\n\nRK: Well, Korea was over in '53.\n\nSH: Right, but you were here then.\n\nRK: Well, I'm here ... as a freshman, and ... I think the only thing was that ... everybody was happy to get it over with. ... It was one of these things ... like Vietnam ... \"Why were we doing that?\" ... South Korea had been invaded, so, there was ... a reason, but ... even so, Korea ... was one of these things [where] all the people coming back from it were not all that excited about it. ... It was just one of those things that ... was forgotten. ... It didn't match up to World War II, which was heroic. It was one of these things that ... \"Well, I guess they have to be there.\" ... Buddies of yours went and they came back and [you asked], \"How was it?\" \"Oh, God.\" ...\n\nSH: Do you recall if there were any veterans from Korea coming back to Rutgers at that point?\n\nRK: There must have been. ... I'm trying to think of one, not many, but they were ... here, but, I mean, when they say [veterans]... they were veterans of Korea, and not World War II. ... They were married; they were living out in the Heights, in those green huts that they used to live in out there. ... So, housing was sort of [at] a premium.\n\nSH: In your four years here, did you note an increase in the African-American population on campus?\n\nRK: There was Stevie Johnson, Choo-Choo Jackson, Johnson? [James Davis?]. Gosh, I'm not sure [that] there was more than a handful, and those are two football players. I don't know [if] there was one on the basketball team. ... It was pretty white, Anglo-Saxon. We had a few guys that came in with \"zoot suits.\" ... It's a funny story, really. Jack Canal, who was an end on the football team, in fact, he was a Chi Psi, and he came ... for dinner, and he had this powder blue suit with pegged legs that came down ... around the bottoms, ... and a ducktail haircut. ... He was a good guy. He's a dentist now, I think in Tampa, Florida. ... It took about two weeks and, all of a sudden, he had a blue blazer. ... College has always been a growing up period in this country ... with regard to movement from ... supervision by your parents to separation from family and sort of a growing period, and so, a lot of that went on.\n\nSH: Who else do you remember from the administration here at Rutgers?\n\nRK: ... Harry Rockafeller was Director of Athletics, the President [was] Lewis Webster Jones and Mason Gross was the Provost. Dr. Jones had all of us from Cap and Skull to dinner, which I thought was a very impressive thing, ... over at his house across the river, and a very nice affair. ... He ... just sat down and talked to us, but, ... again, ... listening to [the faculty, like], say, at Amherst and Williams this past week, the interaction with the faculty, we really didn't do it very much. We would invite faculty or coaches, or whatnot to parties, interacted a little bit that way. ... I remember a guy, who was teaching American Civilization, that a couple of guys in the fraternity used to go and socialize with, but the interaction with the faculty didn't seem to be too great.\n\nMM: What type of training or instruction did you have in ROTC? You said that the Army carried rifles, but the Air Force did not do much drilling.\n\nRK: Oh, we drilled on Tuesday afternoon. We always beat you guys in competitions. [laughter] If we didn't, I wanted to say that anyway. [laughter] ... When I was at the Air Force Academy, whenever I had a guest ... the cadets always paraded very well ... but I always sort of underplayed it. I'd say, \"We fly a lot better than we march,\" [laughter] but whatever. ... What did they teach us? ... We had parades, went out and drilled ... and taught each other how to do that. I had been at Peekskill Military Academy, so ... I probably knew a little bit more than the average bear. What did we learn?\n\nMM: Did you have classroom instruction as well?\n\nRK: Yes, we did. Oh, I think we had something on the Soviet Union. I know we had one course in terms of how to plan a base. We didn't know what we were doing, didn't have a clue. [laughter] We didn't know where to put [things]. ... \"How do you enter the base?\" \"Where's the runway?\" You know, we'd never seen a base. We didn't know how to do that. ... Generally speaking, ... it was [viewed] as a \"gut\" course. ... You'd go in, listen in class and get a \"B.\" ...\n\nMM: Was there stiff competition for pilot slots?\n\nRK: No, as long as you qualified ... you took that stanine exam and they had \"this little thing\" where you had to tell which kind of position you're in [in an aircraft], and I did very well on it. So, don't ask me why, don't ask me why, [laughter] because there was this guy; the reason I say \"this little thing,\" this one little guy must have heard about what you had to do. I was using my hands [to indicate the position]. He had this little, white airplane. He was [good]. [laughter] So, anyway, we all took that stanine test and, you know, I know I did well as a pilot. ...\n\nMM: It must have worked.\n\nRK: It worked.\n\nMM: Did you meet your wife at this time?\n\nRK: Yes.\n\nMM: How did that happen?\n\nRK: How did that happen?\n\nMM: She went to school in Virginia, I believe.\n\nRK: Well, she did. She went to Virginia Intermont ... which wife are you talking about?\n\nMM: Your first wife.\n\nRK: My first wife, yes. I can sing the Columbia High School alma mater, because we had so many guys in my fraternity from Columbia, from South Orange, Maplewood. ... \"Columbia, thou has taught us the way that we should tread.\" ... So, anyway, Brian O'Hearn, who was ... a class ahead of me and captain of the football team, was a close friend. ... We all went off to something in February. We came back and he had a party ... up in his area and Tommy Moffett, who was, again, a year ahead of me, played lacrosse, captain of the lacrosse team with Monte Montgomery, had a date with my Marty Odell. ... That's when I fell in love with her ... but it took me about six months to finally get a date with her, and the rest was history.\n\nMM: After graduation, where did you go for flight training?\n\nRK: ... You entered the Air Force, in those days, in San Antonio, Lackland Air Force Base, for about a month or six weeks, and then, I went to Bainbridge, Georgia. [I] had a guy named (Ivan Fagen?) as my flight instructor. ... We had this big ... room and these little, small tables ... [and the cadets would] sit there. ... Then, the instructors would come out and he was always the last one out and he always had this red face. I think he did a lot of drinking. [laughter] ... They'd all been World War II [pilots]. They were all civilians at that time. ... We flew the T-34 and the T-28.\n\nMM: Then, they sent you to Germany.\n\nRK: No, no. ... That was just for primary, where you get about 150 hours of flying time in those two airplanes. ... Then, you went on, to either, at that time, into multi-engines, [if] you're going to be a bomber or a transport pilot, or to single-engine jets, which was T-33s. I went to Greenville, Mississippi, where I ... got my wings, and then, based upon your class standing, you get to select whatever assignments are available. ... So, I was high enough to be able to get an F-86 [assignment] to Williams Air Force Base, [Chandler, Arizona], where I did what they called advanced training. ... We flew that for about eighty hours and I did very well there. I was number one in my class, so, I got to pick my assignment, and so, I picked ... Hahn, Germany. ... After Williams, we went on to Nellis for ... checkout in the F-100. ... Maintenance was always bad, so, we got about twenty-three hours. ... Then, survival school at Stead, north of Reno, Nevada and then, to Germany. ... From the time that I left Rutgers, I graduated on the 7th [of June], played in the North-South game on the 10th, was married on the 30th, entered the Air Force on the 13th, and, two years later I was in Germany.\n\nMM: In Germany, were you working with NATO or alongside other NATO forces? Did you ever work with any soldiers from other units or from other countries?\n\nRK: Well, we were a day fighter squadron and our responsibility was to fly from a half-hour before sunrise to a half-hour after sunrise, because we didn't have any radar in the airplane, the F100C. So, we just flew in the daytime, and to intercept Russian airplanes if they penetrated the ADIZ [Air Defense Identification Zone]. ... We did work a little bit with the Army. Every once in a while, we'd fly down to Grafenwoehr [US Army installation in SE Germany] and provide close-air support for them, but we didn't really work with the Army very much in those days. The idea of joint-ness and [working] in cooperation like that was ... just beginning. ... So, after a year of that, we closed that squadron down, and we assigned all the other pilots to other squadrons in the wing. ... We were part of the rollback of the Russian air defenses for the bombers that would follow us. So, we would load a Mark 7, twenty-eight-kiloton nuclear weapon, pretty early version, on our left wing and sit alert. My target was the airfield east of Krakow, Poland. ... One afternoon a guy from the State Department or the JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] visited because they're concerned about the fact that they thought that one of us might take off with a weapon and deliver it without an order to do so. ... Later, there was something called a permissive action link that we went to with nuclear weapons. It required two people, two keys, all that kind of business. ... We didn't have any of that [then], so, I ... briefed him on my target. ... I briefed the ... routes and our planning, and how we were going to attack it from the east and use the LABS [Low-Altitude Bombing System] maneuver, which throws the weapon up to about fourteen thousand feet, and then, you escape and whatnot. ... So, I finished that and the guy ... from the State Department ... said, \"Well, that's a very good briefing, Lieutenant ... but I hope you never have to do that.\" Gee, I was ready to do that that afternoon, if they wanted me to, and ... I must have looked startled. He said, \"In Krakow, Poland, there is one of the oldest and finest libraries in the world. ... If we ever destroyed that, it would be a terrible thing.\" ... Up to that point, I had never given a moment's thought to the consequences of my actions.\n\nMM: Did you ever feel that there was a real threat that the Cold War might go hot?\n\nRK: No, not really. We just were having a wonderful time, flying airplanes. [laughter] I mean, I'm telling you the truth. I mean, it was one of those things in which we were exercised, so ... we knew our jobs. ... In fact, I was telling somebody on this trip, when we were heading ... to dinner, about that. They said, \"Well, you know, it sounds like you just went to another fraternity,\" and that's what a fighter squadron is. ... It was another fraternity. ... We worked together, pulled alert together, partied together, played together, worked hard, played hard. ... As an example of the kind of guys that were with me, one of them just had his seventieth surprise birthday party down in Naples, Florida. His name is Al Hoffman. He was a '56 graduate from West Point. He was courting this gal when he was in Germany, and I think she'd been married before and her husband was killed, he was a pilot, and she said, \"If you want to marry me, you've got to get out of flying.\" So, he got out of flying. He went back toHarvard Business School, and then, moved out to Chicago and became one of the most successful builders in theChicago area. Twenty-five years ago, thirty years ago now, I guess, in the late '70s, he retired and moved toFlorida and became a polo player. [laughter] ... He got thrown off and ... got seriously banged up and ... now he runs ... WCI, West Coast International, or something or other. They build all these beautiful golf courses and condos on the west and east coast of Florida. ... He was a fundraiser for George Bush. ... He's a very wealthy guy. But, those were the kind of guys that were in the squadron with you. ... We were just all out of college. ... Some of them, some of the guys were not interested in staying in, but we were just having a wonderful time. ... Flying airplanes, of course, in flying fighters in particular, ... was just an exciting life.\n\nMM: Did you get an opportunity to tour around Europe while you were there?\n\nRK: Well, ... yes, some. I've seen so many churches; I never want to see another church. [laughter] ... My first wife ... never wanted to go back to Europe again, because the weather was so bad. All she saw was gray, but, of course, every day, we'd go fly and we got above the clouds. In Germany, the clouds go from about five hundred to fifteen hundred feet, so, you're up above of the clouds. We saw the sun every day. ... I went to Switzerland, toItaly, to Spain, to Belgium, to the Netherlands, to all over Germany, to the UK, to Libya. We used to have a bombing range down there in Libya, so, we would deploy down to Wheelus Air Force Base, outside of Tripoli. A funny thing happened when we were standing on a corner in Tripoli ... deciding on whether we're going to go ... to the new section or the old section of Tripoli. ... We're standing there and ... one of us, he was about six-three, his name is Chuck Young, Class of '56 at West Point, crew cut, ... very German-looking guy. ... This kid comes up and he goes, \"Want to buy a knife?\" Sticks it in his gut, and he [Young] responds, \"Nein,\" and the guy looked at him ... thought he was a German. You've got to understand the context, again. There were many young Libyans without an eye. Their mothers would put out one of their eyes, so that they wouldn't have to go into the army ... the Italian Army. ... This young guy took one look and thought, \"Germans?\" ... He had thought we were Americans, so he was going to take us for a ride, but Germans, nada. \"Voom,\" he was gone. [laughter] So, you know, it's just interesting ... the different ways people look at you, from a cultural perspective.\n\nMM: What were your reactions to the Berlin Crisis? You were redeployed to Germany for that, correct? [Editor's Note: The Berlin Crisis of 1961 developed in June 1961 when the Soviet demanded the withdrawal of Western forces from the occupied city and drew to a close in November of that year. Berlin had earlier been a flashpoint for East-West tensions during the 1948 Soviet blockade and the subsequent US Air Force/Royal Air Force-led airlift.]\n\nRK: Well, that's another story. ... Yes, this was in the F-104. ... We wished we could get into aerial combat ... when I returned to Germany in the F-104; see, now, [in] the F-100, we ... struggled against the Mk6s [Canadair Sabre Mk6s] ... but, with the F-104 ... we were all over the place. I mean, we could just really get up and go. ... It was ... the opportunity to start the build-up of conventional forces. So, an awful lot of people were called up, to go, for the Berlin Crisis (of 1961, not 1948) and it was a serious event, but was it going to start World War III? Only if somebody did something dumb. ... I think both sides, Unites States and Soviet, decided that it wasn't worth fighting World War III about. ... That became pretty apparent, and so, we did a lot of flying. ... Went to the club and drank a lot, [laughter] played basketball, and, pulled alert. ... The initial response was hoping something's happening, and not going was disappointing. ... During the Cuban Missile Crisis [of October 1962], I didn't deploy to Florida and I was sort of disappointed. Again, you've got to understand that the orientation was you wanted to get [combat time]. The objective for a fighter pilot is to become an ace. So, \"Who's the world's greatest fighter pilot?\" ... You're always competing, and while it doesn't make a lot of sense when you're an adult, [laughter] but, I mean, that's the way you think about it, is that you're a young guy that ... didn't get to World War II. ... Here's the classic story. [Major General Frederick C.] \"Boots\" Blesse, Class of '45 from West Point, ... that was a three-year class, he graduates from West Point, the war's over, June of '45. He's assigned to Okinawa. He goes out there and he flies a P-51. He learns to air fight and he's fighting with all the guys in the squadron. He goes back after every mission and they say, \"Well, Boots, you really did well today, but that's not the way you do it in combat.\" So, he's there for about three years, and he comes back to Selfridge, out in Michigan, and, all of a sudden, the Korean War kicks off. So, he walks into the office of his CO, ... Colonel Francis S. \"Gabby\" Gabreski, who was a leading ace. ... He got twenty-five or twenty-eight victories in World War II. [Editor's Note: Colonel Gabreski earned twenty-eight kills in World War II, thirty-four-and-a-half total in his career.] Blesse walks in and he says, \"Colonel Gabreski, I've got to get to the war.\" He said, \"Oh, relax, Boots. The big one's going to be over in Europe. You know that's just a little thing going on over in Korea. You don't want to go there.\" ... \"Look,\" Boots says, \"Wait a minute now, you've been [in a war].\" He said, \"I've got to get over there and ... find out what it's all about,\" and so, Gabreski says, \"Okay.\" So, he sends him out to Nellis Air Force Base,Las Vegas, and he's checked out in the '86. He goes to Japan, and when he gets up to a base in Korea, no, I'm sorry. In Japan, they said, \"The '86s aren't ... there yet. Has anybody here checked out in the F-[51], flown the F-51?\" Boots Blesse said, \"Shit, this thing will be over before I get over there.\" He said, \"Yes, I'm a '51 guy.\" He says, \"Okay, you go over to K-14 [Kimpo Air Force Base, South Korea].\" So, he goes over to K-14. He arrives; this flight commander sees him and he says, \"Hey, ... we're glad to have you here.\" ... Go out and get a couple of landings in the F-51, get recurrent ... because our flight's going to be on alert tonight.\" So, Boots goes out ... flies the F-51 around the base, lands it, comes in, gets on alert. Well, ... now it's night. All of a sudden, all of the heavens open up and it is raining. It's just pouring and Boots looks outside and he says, \"We don't fly in this crap, do we?\" ... The flight commander says, \"No. ... Every once in a while, they ring the bell and we go out and sit in the airplane, but we never fly.\" So, two o'clock in the morning comes and the bell goes off, and they go out to the airplanes and they start up the engines, and ... no one ever calls. They taxi out to the runway and they take-off. [laughter] They've got rockets. So, they go up north and they fire these rockets off, and then, they get the call to come back and return to base. It's all screwed up. They're getting this call saying, \"Come on back and land\". ... \"The weather's ... really getting bad.\" [laughter] So, they come back and they didn't have lights on the runways. ... All they had was smudge pots for lighting the runway. So, they come down through this soup and they missed the approach and, now, they're getting low on fuel ... because there's no place in Korea to go, they might have to go toJapan. ... They're beyond their \"bingo fuel,\" [slang for the amount of fuel needed to make it back to base]. So, they finally come down. They make another approach, missed approach. Third time, they come down, and this is really getting serious, and so, the guy picks it up, gets lined up and he says to Boots, \"Take spacing.\" So, the first guy lands, and then, Boots comes in and he lands. ... He thinks to himself, \"Boy, thank God.\" Halfway down the runway, there's these lights, and a truck comes over and hits him broadside; throws him upside down, off the runway, into a ditch. The thing doesn't burn, but, oh, he's [in a tangled wreck]. So, he starts [trying to move.] ... He moves his arms and legs and he said, \"I think I'm okay.\" Then, all of a sudden, he feels this trickle coming down the back of his neck. He said, \"Oh, my God, I'm going to bleed to death before they get me out of here.\" Well, to make a long story short, behind the seat in a P-51 is a fuel tank, which ruptured, and it was avgas [aviation gasoline]. The only problem he had was fuel pooled in his helmet and it burned the inside of his ear. That's the only thing that was wrong with him. Now, fast forward, he flies "
