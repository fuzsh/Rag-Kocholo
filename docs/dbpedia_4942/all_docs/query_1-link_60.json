It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.” To me, these words by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428 BC – 348 BC) resonate as truly and with as much strength today as they must have when they were first uttered over two thousand years ago. As the quintessential universal language, I believe that music has a profound effect on both mind and spirit. Music has an ability to express who we were, what we are, and what we can become. It picks up where words leave off and has the unique ability to unify people by transcending cultural boundaries and physical borders. If “a picture is worth a thousand words,” similarly, musical sound conveys a thousand images and expresses a seemingly endless multitude of emotions and innermost feelings. Indeed, I can think of no other art form that endeavors to elevate the human condition to ever-higher planes through a conscious manifestation of the subconscious. Whether teaching in the classroom or performing in the concert hall, it is a genuine privilege and my greatest pleasure to share my deep passion for music with those poised to listen.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAaron is an Assistant Professor of Theatre/Directing.

Morus (PhD University of Georgia, 2005) is an Associate Professor of Communication & Genocide Studies at Stockton University. She was a Fulbright Scholar in residence at the University of Belgrade’s Faculty of Political Sciences and the Center for Women’s Studies in 2009 and continues to serve as a volunteer and activist with Belgrade’s Women in Black, and Belgrade’s DAH Theatre.\n\nAt the core of her scholarship and pedagogy is the critical consideration of pre- and post-conflict discourses with attention to media, politics, popular thought and public memory. Her work centers mainly on the 1990s wars in the former Yugoslavia, with some attention to the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the Khmer Rouge Genocide in Cambodia, the Genocide of Guatemala’s Maya, and the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. Her past projects considered the impacts of Serbian historical narratives, as they are embedded within a range of public discourses, on the normalization of violence that accompanied the 1990s wars in the former Yugoslavia. Her current research considers the impacts of historical narratives on post-war discourses and the extent to which they influence regional sustainable stability and social repair. She is presently working on a book – a ten-year longitudinal study focusing on public memory and the Srebrenica Genocide. The study critically analyzes the ways in which locally-originating grassroots civil society organizations in Serbia and Bosnia are affecting post-conflict transition through carefully crafted, consciously counter-hegemonic, vernacular rhetorical strategies deployed in public space.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPh.D., University of Georgia\n\nAREAS OF EXPERTISE\n\nThe Rhetoric of Mass Violence & Genocide;\n\nThe break-up of Yugoslavia, The Bosnian War & its aftermath;\n\nGender & War;\n\nDiscourses of Memory;\n\nThe Rhetoric of Social Change;\n\nDiscourses of Gender, Race, Class & Ethnicity\n\nCOURSES\n\nCOMM 3309: Media, Civil Rights, & Social Change;\n\nCOMM 3312: Media in Times of War;\n\nCOMM 4601: Senior Seminar;\n\nGAH 2358: Perspectives on Women;\n\nGAH 3248: Media, Public Perception & Genocide;\n\nGIS 3418: Witness to Genocide;\n\nGIS 3658: Women & Genocide\n\nSELECTED RECENT RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS:\n\nMorus, Christina M, (2012) War Rape and the Global Condition of Womanhood: Learning from the Bosnian War.

Her teaching and research focus on the arts, visual culture, gender, race, and ethnicity.\n\nHer first book, Democratic Art: The New Deal’s Influence on American Culture (University of Chicago Press, 2015) traces a range of aesthetic visions that flourished during the 1930s to outline the successes, shortcomings, and lessons of the golden age of government funding for the arts. Her current book project, Americans Abroad: Hadassah Kaplan, Zionism, and the Making of American-Jewish Women, uses her grandmother’s archive to explore the coming of age of a young American Jewish woman in the early twentieth century in a story that foreshadows the emerging special relationship between American Jews and Israel. She has written book chapters in The Oxford Handbook of the African American Slave Narrative (Oxford University Press, 2014), Interpreting American History: The New Deal and the Great Depression (Kent State University Press, 2014), and The Case against Academic Boycotts of Israel (Wayne State Press, 2014).

These projects include physical collections of documents and cultural artifacts, as well as figurative repositories of historical memories and the practices of remembering, cataloging, and disseminating historical knowledge.\n\nPROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS\n\nAmerican Studies Association\n\nModern Language Association\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nNathan Long teaches creative writing, with a focus on fiction, as well as literature courses and courses for the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Minor.

I was also the resident scenic and costume designer for the theatre company and on occasion I would direct a production. While living in upstate New York, I was an adjunct faculty member for the Theatre department at Siena College in Loudonville. Before moving upstate, I lived in Brooklyn, New York and was a freelance designer working the Manhattan theater-scape. My professional theatre design credits in New York City included designing the costumes for the Pre-Broadway Tour of Mario Fratti’s Encounter 500…Cristoforo Colombo and designing the scenery for Gifts from the Attic starring the legendary film actor Mickey Rooney. Off-Broadway credits include The Writing on the Wall, The First Time, Guadeloupe, and the musical Rainbow with Tony Award winning actress Debbie Shapiro. My scenic design for the Off-Broadway production of Annie Wobbler earned mention and praise in the New York Times review of the show. Early in my New York City career, I served as Resident Designer for St. Bart’s Playhouse in midtown Manhattan and The Westbeth Theater Center in the Village. I have also designed scenery and costumes for various Regional Theaters in New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.\n\nEducation & Training\n\nPh.D. in Leadership. Policy, and Change in Education, Walden University, MN\n\nM.A. in Theatre, University of Michigan, MI\n\nB.A. in Theatre, Indiana University, IN\n\nWhat I most like about South Jersey\n\nMy mother was born and raised in North Jersey, Elizabeth, during the depression years of the last century. When she always spoke of the “good ole days,” one of her fondest memories was her family driving down to South Jersey for the summer. She loved visiting South Jersey where she said all the farmlands produced the freshest fruits and vegetables. When I moved to the state in 2010, I finally got to experience the “Garden State” that she so fondly spoke of, and I must say, she was right! I am so fortunate to be able to enjoy such fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables throughout the year, right here in South Jersey.\n\nOne of my favorite experiences at Stockton University\n\nMy most treasured experience at Stockton University is mentoring, guiding, and teaching student designers journey through the design process, from inception to fruition. My artistry enhances and supports my teaching, and my teaching fulfills my artistic passion and allows me to pass it on to my students. I consider my design and technical direction work in the professional field as vital to my success as a teacher; whereupon I share my experiences with the design students. I also consider my teaching as an inspiration for my professional work. I am blessed to have this opportunity at Stockton University."
