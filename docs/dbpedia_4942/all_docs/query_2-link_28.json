My most important source has been my father himself. Through many conversations over a period of forty-two years, he shared with me a significant part of his inner life and his world outlook. My collection of tape recordings of him speaking in both public and private settings was also of great help in defining his personal style.\n\nMy most comprehensive source consisted of the Paul Robeson and Eslanda Robeson Collections—some thirty thousand letters, diaries, notes, interviews, writings, speeches, photographs, programs, notebooks, books with marginalia, annotated music sheets, and news clippings—accumulated over five decades. Diaries written by my mother for the years 1924–1926, 1928, 1930–1934, 1938, and 1939 were especially helpful, providing not only unique insights but also background and color. My father’s own 1934–1936 notes on culture, combined with his 1929 diary and extensive unpublished writings, offered important examples of his thinking during the critical years of his artistic, intellectual, and political growth.\n\nThis book could not have been written, nor could his legacy have been preserved, without the unwavering dedication of my mother, who meticulously saved the items that now constitute the Robeson Collections.\n\nMy father paid a fitting tribute both to her accomplishments and to her loyalty. On the dedication page of his autobiography, Here I Stand, he wrote:\n\nTo Eslanda Goode Robeson, distinguished writer and anthropologist:\n\nthanks for many things—\n\nFor your untiring labors in the interests of the African peoples;\n\nFor your devotion to the struggle of our folk here in America for full freedom;\n\nFor your constructive analyses of the momentous events at the United Nations;\n\nFor your deeply shared belief in and labors for the attainment of a lasting peace for all the peoples of the earth;\n\nAnd deepest gratitude for your help and guidance over many years of struggle, aspiration, achievement, and the constant awareness of a better future for our children and grandchildren.\n\nThe many conversations I had over the years with my mother and with my parents’ closest friends provided me with additional perceptions and nuances of my father’s character.\n\nI am especially grateful to the Paul Robeson Archives and its two directors: Roberta Yancy and Marilyn Robeson. For a decade, from 1973 through 1983, the Archives organized, preserved, duplicated, transcribed, and catalogued the materials that are now known as the Paul Robeson and Eslanda Robeson Collections. In addition, the Archives acquired and continues to administer an extensive collection of Robeson documentary film, feature film, and videotape from both domestic and foreign sources. This visual archive, combined with the Archives Collection of duplicates of the Robeson Collections, eased my research burden immensely.\n\nMany thanks also to Harry Belafonte, who in 1973 produced the historic Seventy-fifth Birthday Salute to Paul Robeson at Carnegie Hall. This gala event marked the beginning of my father’s return to America’s cultural mainstream and financed the creation of the Paul Robeson Archives.\n\nMany people helped with the conceptualization and writing of this book. I am indebted to them all, but I can mention only a few. Janet Hulstrand edited my first and most disorganized draft with loving care, helping me to pare it down and to focus on the essentials. Carole Hall, my editor at John Wiley & Sons, guided me through two difficult drafts, helping me to make critical decisions. Her skillful, considerate, and dedicated support allowed me to extend myself far beyond my expectations. Mary Dorian did an excellent job of copyediting the final manuscript, as did Lisa Vaia, associate managing editor.\n\nMy wife, Marilyn, has served as an invaluable reader-critic-consultant throughout this project, often providing me with new insights and unforeseen options.\n\nMy literary agent and friend, Lawrence Jordan, has patiently and tenaciously shepherded this project through good and bad times for five years with unflagging energy. He never lost faith in its ultimate success. For this and for his staunch moral support, my deepest thanks.\n\nPREFACE\n\nPAUL ROBESON: I AM MYSELF\n\nThere is a vast contradiction between Paul Robeson’s current relative obscurity and the majesty of his achievements over a fifty-year career. Although he is the only African-American charter member of the National Theater Hall of Fame, his name does not appear in the index of Notable Names in the American Theater, and he has no entry of his own in Famous Actors of the American Stage. In 1944, at the peak of his career, American Magazine called him America’s number one Negro, yet five years later, in 1949, he was the nation’s most vilified black man. For the next twenty-seven years, until his death in 1976, he was blacklisted as an artist in the United States.\n\nThe reason for his banishment from the nation’s public life lies in his relentless challenge not only to anti-black stereotypes but also to the cultural foundations of American racism. Touted in the 1940s as the ultimate black role model and the proof that the American system worked for blacks, he nevertheless condemned the system for failing to provide the same opportunities for all African-Americans.\n\nThe media-nurtured myth that his political persecution stemmed from a love affair with communism, or that he was duped by Russian or American communists, has always been aimed at obfuscating his dedication to the goal of immediate and full freedom for his people. The truth is that my father was never a communist, nor did he ever seriously contemplate joining the Communist Party. His defense of the Soviet Union and his refusal to abandon his communist friends did not stem from a fascination with left-wing ideology or from personal pride. Rather, these decisions were based on his love of Russian culture and his conviction that the Soviet Union and communists in general were the most reliable opponents of Nazism, colonialism, and racism.\n\nAnother false but persistent image of my father is that he was a bitter, disillusioned recluse during his years of retirement. This myth, too, has been deliberately manufactured by the mass media. After illness had robbed him of his artistic and prophetic gifts, he felt no obligation, even to his admirers, to appear in public or to see anyone outside of his select personal circle. In retirement, he declared his personal life off-limits to all but those of his personal choice. At the same time, he basked in the glow of the massive civil rights victories of the sixties. Fully aware of his singular contribution, he needed no medals or acknowledgments.\n\nI hope to tell his story as it was, and with no attempt at political, racial, or any other kind of correctness. Since in life he despised sycophants, it would be an insult to his memory if I were to make the slightest attempt to satisfy those who crave a Robeson icon, those who wish to worship at a shrine, or those who are beguiled by his political persona. Driven for different reasons, they pose as staunch defenders of the Robeson image against all manner of real and imagined detractors. But Paul Robeson has nothing to fear from history, from the public, or from any critic; his true image speaks for itself and needs no polishing or protection. It is time simply to bear witness to history. As the late James Baldwin so aptly wrote:\n\nRobeson … lives, overwhelmingly, in the hearts and minds of the people whom he touched, the people for whom he was an example, the people who gained from him the power to perceive and the courage to exist. It is not a sentimental question. He lived in our times, we live in his. … It is a matter of bearing witness to that force which moved among us.¹\n\nPaul Robeson was an original. He had no counterpart. During his formative years, he cultivated the image of a free spirit who came and went, belonging to multitudes but owned by no one. Like a gentle summer breeze, or the moonlight shimmering on the surface of a still lake, he would not be confined. While he learned from and respected many outstanding people, he had no role model, and did not aspire to be one. He worshiped wisdom and knowledge of the ways of men, not heroes.² To be as good as someone else is no high ideal, he said. I am myself.³\n\nIn a 1934 essay titled My Brother Paul, Rev. Benjamin C. Robeson, Paul’s older brother and pastor of Harlem’s Mother A.M.E. Zion Church, wrote:\n\nTo understand Paul, one must know this. He moves by his inner revelations. Experience has taught him to do this. He never fails, is never disappointed or perplexed when he follows his flash. He is at perfect ease moving this way. In a moment he senses everything; he asks every question that comes to the normal mind, and answer or no answer, he obeys his flash.\n\nIn these pages, I have sought to recreate the development of the character he personally revealed to me. I have ventured an exploration of his vulnerabilities and his inner struggles, with a focus on the revelations that accompanied his growth as an artist. I have sought to portray the connection between his sense of himself and the preoccupations that dominated his life. It is my hope that those who do not know the essential facts of his career will discern its historic significance, and that those who already do, will discover more about the man behind it and learn about his motivation and reasoning. Robeson scholars and those who knew him personally will discover that there were pivotal aspects of his personality that he kept mainly to himself.\n\nAs I was writing this book, striving to ensure the accuracy of its contents, I realized that it would be naive of anyone who had experienced my father’s aura, much less his son, to claim to be entirely objective about him. Therefore, I have not attempted to write a memoir or an exhaustively detailed life story, but rather an intimate, informal biography. In shaping it, my opinions and personal experiences with him are inevitably an element within the story.\n\nIt divides naturally into two main parts. The first, which I tell in this book, extends from his birth on April 9, 1898, through October 12, 1939. It is the story of the preacher’s son, an emerging artist who departs for Europe to become a citizen of the world and returns as a prophetic superstar. In a second book, I will explore his life as a prophet in search of full freedom for his people.\n\nThere is much to be learned from and about this great artist who combined courage and gentleness, militancy, activism, and scholarship, and who functioned on the cutting edge of the social and political issues of his time. In 1944, on the occasion of his forty-sixth birthday, Mary McLeod Bethune, the well-respected educator, described him as the tallest tree in our forest. Today, as I travel the world lecturing and talking about my father, I see that a veritable renaissance of interest has followed the 1998 celebration of the centennial of his birth. I hope this book introduces an ever-widening audience to his spirit and humanity.\n\nI\n\nMOTHERLESS CHILD\n\n(1898–1919)\n\n(Above) Paul Robeson at age twelve (reclining in the bottom foreground), shortstop of the Westfield High School baseball team, although he was still in the seventh grade at Westfield Junior High.

Courtesy of Rutgers University.\n\n1\n\nTHE PREACHER’S SON\n\n(1898–1915)\n\nPaul Leroy Robeson’s soul as an artist was formed in a journey through life that began on April 9, 1898. His father, the Reverend William Drew Robeson, vigorous at fifty-four, had been pastor of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in Princeton, New Jersey, for nineteen years. Paul’s mother, Maria Louisa Bustill Robeson, was forty-five, partially blind from cataracts and suffering from disabling asthma.\n\nPaul was the last of the seven Robeson children, two of whom had died in infancy.¹ His oldest surviving sibling, William Drew Jr. (Bill), born in 1881, was seventeen and attending high school; John Bunyan Reeve (Reed) was twelve; Benjamin (Ben) was six; and Marian was four. Now that Maria Louisa could no longer teach and tutor, the family lived more frugally than they had before. Paul’s late arrival, though welcomed unreservedly, must have added to William Drew’s burdens. But he believed that God would provide.\n\nA dark-skinned man descended from the Ibo tribe of Nigeria, Reverend Robeson was of medium height with broad shoulders, and had an air of surpassing dignity. His calm manner was reinforced by a straight bearing and a penetrating look. Early on, Paul developed a complex bond with this devout paragon of personal discipline.\n\nMy father was always extremely reluctant to talk to me about his father’s personality, as if some painful memories were associated with such recollections. Reverend Robeson was often silent and remote at home, rarely dispensing praise and unlikely to demonstrate affection. Though he was a devoted family man who was respected and loved by all the Robeson children, he was also feared. Quick to anger and short on humor, he could not have failed to demand excellence from each of them.\n\nDistant and determinedly private, Reverend Robeson rarely talked to his children about his early years as a slave, or about his parents, Benjamin and Sabra. He expected his children to rise in the world.\n\nFreedom was life’s blood to Reverend Robeson. In 1858, as a fifteen-year-old field slave on the Roberson Plantation in Robersonville in eastern North Carolina, he had escaped with his older brother, Ezekiel, on the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania.² There William Drew, as he was known, worked as a farmhand, earning enough money to aid his parents, whom he returned to visit twice during the next two years despite extreme hazards. When the Civil War began in April 1861, William Drew and Ezekiel joined a Union Army labor battalion that ultimately accompanied the advancing Union troops in 1864. According to family legend, the two brothers took up arms, along with others in the battalion, to repel a surprise attack by the Confederate general George Pickett on the Union-occupied city of New Bern, North Carolina.³ At the end of the war, Ezekiel returned to North Carolina to work as a farmhand with his parents.\n\nWilliam Drew remained in Pennsylvania, went to a Freedmen’s School, and in 1867 managed to enter the one-year preparatory class of Lincoln University, a pioneer black college. He eventually completed Lincoln’s four-year bachelor of arts program. In 1876, he was awarded the degrees of master of arts and bachelor of sacred theology.⁴\n\nDuring his studies at Lincoln, William Drew met Maria Louisa Bustill, a young Philadelphia teacher, who frequently visited her uncle’s house in the nearby town of Lincoln. On July 11, 1878, she married the earnest divinity student who excelled in ancient languages. Maria Louisa was tall and handsome. She was known for her gentle, compassionate, sunny disposition. One day she would serve as William Drew’s intellectual companion, help him compose his sermons, and act as his right hand in his community work.\n\nThe social gulf between the runaway son of North Carolina field slaves and the elder daughter of the Bustills of Philadelphia was enormous. The Bustills, a family of mixed African, English Quaker, and Leni-Lenape Indian stock, could trace their American ancestry as far back as 1608 and had produced many outstanding men and women. Cyrus Bustill, Maria Louisa’s great-grandfather, who was born a slave in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1732, became apprenticed to a local baker, learned the trade, and soon bought his freedom. He went on to become a baker with a thriving business that extended far beyond his local customers. During the Revolutionary War, he baked bread for George Washington’s troops, and in 1787 he was one of the founders of the Free African Society, the first mutual aid organization of African-Americans.\n\nThrough the years, the Bustills became teachers, artists, business-people, and pioneers in many professions. Prior to the Civil War, members of the family played key roles in running and maintaining the Underground Railroad. Maria Louisa’s uncle Joseph had been one of the organizers of the Underground Railroad terminal in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After the war, the Bustills helped lead the fight for black rights.⁵ Paul would grow up to be both proud and conflicted about his mother’s distinguished family, who looked down on his father’s kin living nearby in Princeton.\n\nBy the time of Paul’s birth, the Robesons had become pillars of Princeton’s sizable, tightly knit black community. As pastor, William Drew had developed Witherspoon Church into a center of civic and social activity. He had also become an effective defender of the community’s interests, and was universally respected. However, his occasional outspokenness provoked certain high-ranking members of Princeton’s white elite.\n\nWhen Paul was two, his brother Bill tried to enroll at Princeton University, but he was rebuffed. Refusing as usual to compromise on matters of principle, William Drew appealed in person to Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton, for Bill’s enrollment. Reverend Robeson refused to accept any of Wilson’s repeated and forceful attempts to avoid a direct response, compelling the future president of the United States to declare angrily that Princeton did not accept colored.⁶ It was long rumored in Princeton’s black community that this defiance cost William Drew his pastorate.\n\nA wealthy white Presbyterian church had built Witherspoon for its black members after having accommodated them in balcony seats for decades. But ultimate control remained with the white authorities, and one day they took William Drew’s pastorate from him on a spurious pretext. Despite his well-argued statement of defense at his hearing and the near-unanimous support of his congregation, the decision to remove him from his pastorate (which he had appealed) was announced as final on November 17, 1900.\n\nPaul was probably in the audience sitting with his mother, brothers, and sister when Reverend Robeson preached his last sermon at Witherspoon Church on January 27, 1901. Well known throughout the region for his dramatic power and inspiring messages, the reverend filled the sanctuary with his deep, melodious bass voice. Paul would always recall it as the greatest speaking voice he ever heard. On that day, William Drew made no direct mention of his dismissal. But he did intimate that his departure stemmed from his refusal to curtail his determined criticism of social injustice.⁷\n\nOn January 29, 1901, two days after William Drew had preached his farewell sermon at Witherspoon Church, George C. White, of William Drew’s home state of North Carolina and the nation’s sole remaining black congressman, defiantly addressed the U.S. House of Representatives. His term was coming to an end, he said, and the electoral rigging legitimized by the U.S. Supreme Court in the service of white rule had denied him any hope of reelection. His departure, he noted, was perhaps the Negroes’ temporary farewell to the American Congress; but we say, Phoenix-like he will rise up some day to come again.⁸ So too would William Drew rise again.\n\nThe Robeson family had to leave the comfortable Witherspoon Street parsonage and move to a smaller house on Green Street around the corner. Bill boarded at Lincoln University and two years later enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. William Drew gave himself to making a living. Paul would write about this period later in his autobiography:\n\nHe was still the dignified Reverend Robeson to the community, and no man carried himself with greater pride. Not once did I hear him complain of the poverty and misfortune of those years. Serene and undaunted, he struggled to earn a livelihood and see to our education. He got a horse and wagon, and began to earn his living hauling ashes. This was his work at the time I first remember him, and I recall the growing mound of ashes dumped in our backyard. A fond memory remains of our horse, a mare named Bess, whom I grew to love and who loved me. My father also went into the hack business and as a coachman drove students around town and on trips to the seashore.\n\nMostly I played. There were the vacant lots for ball games, and the wonderful moments when Bill [then in his mid-twenties], vacationing from college where he played on the team, would teach me how to play football. He was my first coach, and over and over again on a weed-grown lot he would put me through the paces—how to tackle a man so he stayed tackled, how to run with the ball.⁹\n\nPaul chose not to mention that the meager rations of the Robesons in Princeton had to be supplemented by relatives in North Carolina who sent up cornmeal, greens, yams, peanuts and other goodies in bags. From that time on, he relished a good meal in a way that those who have always been well fed do not.¹⁰\n\nOn the morning of January 19, 1904, Reverend Robeson went to Trenton on business. He told twelve-year-old Ben to stay home from school to help Maria Louisa, by now nearly blind, to clean the living room. All the other children except Paul, who was still at home, were away at school. According to Ben and Marian:\n\n[Maria Louisa] decided first to take up the carpet, but the stove was in the way; she and Ben conferred about it, and decided she would lift the stove while he pulled away the carpet underneath. The stove had a sliding front door which opened as she raised the front legs, and a hot coal fell out. It set fire to her dress, but neither of them saw it until the blaze had caught on well and she felt it burn her feet and legs. She tried to beat it out with her hands which were terribly burned. Ben tried frantically to help her, but her full skirts were a dreadful hindrance. When he realized the task was beyond him, he rushed out of the house terrified, screaming for help. A neighbor who was passing came to his mother’s aid, put out the flames, tore off her hot clothing, sent Ben for a doctor, and did what he could to ease her pain. The doctor found that her skirts had partially smothered the flames close to her body and that her feet, legs and hands were horribly burned; part of her hair was burned off, and she had even swallowed some of the flame. He used quarts and quarts of linseed oil to try to alleviate her suffering, but she lay in dreadful agony. This is the way I am to go, she said courageously, and because God intended it I am content.¹¹\n\nShe survived long enough to say farewell to her heartbroken husband that evening. Then the doctors gave her a heavy dose of opiates, she lapsed into unconsciousness, and she died.\n\nThis tragedy engulfed Paul, leaving an emotional wound that may have never healed fully. So thoroughly would he block the events of that day out of his memory that he would never recall where he was at the time. Long afterward Paul wrote that he could not remember her, or the accident, though his recollection of other things went back to times before it. He remembered only her lying in her coffin, the funeral, and the relatives who came.¹²\n\nBen recalled that Paul might well have been in the house: Paul just suddenly showed up in the midst of all the confusion. I hadn’t seen him earlier, and no one, including Paul himself, could remember where he had been. If he’d been out playing or at a neighbor’s house, someone would have remembered it. It’s something he never talked about, and we didn’t bring it up. Contrary to myth, Paul may have been present, seen his mother burning, and been so terrified that he ran and hid.¹³\n\nA residue of fear, guilt, self-doubt, and discomfort with intimacy would have burdened a sensitive child for a lifetime. Reverend Robeson tried to ease his six-year-old son’s trauma. Pop, as Paul came to call him, was reliable, predictable, and available—a secure home base.\n\nThe affluent and light-skinned Bustills distanced themselves from the dark-skinned and poor William Drew. Only the Robeson relatives helped him through the hard days ahead with whatever they could spare. In Paul’s autobiography, he wrote with tenderness about his feelings of deep attachment to the people who provided nourishment and comfort to his father. And significantly, those feelings are inextricably interwoven with his first awareness of music. Infused virtually from the cradle with African-American culture, he recognized its powerful emotional expression in diverse types of music.\n\nHard-working people, and poor, most of them, in worldly goods—but how rich in compassion! There was the honest joy of laughter in these homes, folk-wit and story, hearty appetites for life as for the nourishing greens and black-eyed peas and cornmeal bread they shared with me. Here in this little hemmed-in world where home must be theater and concert hall and social center, there was a warmth of song. Songs of love and longing, songs of trials and triumphs, deep-flowing rivers and rollicking brooks, hymn-song and ragtime ballad, gospels and blues, and the healing comfort to be found in the illimitable sorrow of the spirituals.\n\nYes, I heard my people singing!—in the glow of the parlor coal-stove and on summer porches sweet with lilac air, from choir loft and Sunday morning pews—and my soul was filled with their harmonies.¹⁴\n\nAt the time and for years to come, the spirituals were a source of consolation and self-expression for Paul. In his mature years, he would say that singing them released a flood of deep feelings and, on occasion, a transcendence that could be called a state of grace.\n\nPhotographs of Paul as late as 1913 reveal a haunting sadness in his eyes.¹⁵ There was no denying it—Paul was often alone, left to his thoughts. Nevertheless, in later years he underplayed this loneliness. There must have been moments when I felt the sorrows of a motherless child, he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nPaul’s older brothers and sister were back and forth from school: Reed and Bill were at universities, and Marian was at the Scotia boarding school in North Carolina. Only Ben, who was six years older than Paul, stayed behind until 1906 to look after him, and then Ben left for prep school in North Carolina.\n\nWilliam Drew, now sixty-two, remained a friend and companion to his eight-year-old son, taking him along on visits to his former parishioners and drawing him into church life in the hope that ultimately he might enter the ministry. How proudly, as a boy, I walked at his side, my hand in his, Paul recalled. The two of them also shared a love for checkers, and they spent many a winter evening in the parlor engrossed in play. They didn’t speak much but were wonderfully happy together. The terrible memory of Maria Louisa’s death dimmed. Paul grew accustomed to his father supervising his schoolwork on a day-to-day basis as a stern, uncompromising taskmaster.\n\nTo satisfy William Drew, high grades were not enough: the goal was always perfect grades. At the Princeton elementary school that Paul attended—for black students only, in accordance with the town’s rigid segregation—the principal, Abraham Denny, a classmate of Reverend Robeson’s at Lincoln University, loved his students and created a lively learning environment. Paul flourished academically as William Drew tested him on his lessons, oversaw his reading, and trained him to recite lines of classic poetry and prose. It was to this intensive guidance that Paul would later credit his phenomenal powers of concentration.¹⁶\n\nThrough daily interaction with his father, Paul began to absorb, mostly by example, the credo that was to last a lifetime. First was the importance of living up to his individual potential, rather than worrying about winning for its own sake. Next came the strong belief in his ability to achieve. Then there was the concept that all people must be respected and that the entire human race is a single, though diverse, family of equals. Paul also noticed that William Drew was a model of compassion for others. Paul observed his dedication and accountability to the community, not merely to the pursuit of wealth and influence, but to his commitment to principle as well, even at the cost of personal sacrifice.¹⁷\n\nWith the experience of slavery deep in his bones, William Drew began explicitly to teach Paul the techniques of survival in a viciously racist climate. He insisted that Paul must never appear to be challenging the claim of white superiority. Climb up if you can, he would say, but always show that you are grateful. … Above all, do nothing to give them cause to fear you. However, while he counseled the show of humility, Reverend Robeson manifested not even a hint of servility. Somehow, he managed to convey this dignity without any overt show of anger or resistance. Paul learned this lesson well and added his own twist—he had an affable, smiling demeanor, combined with an irresistible empathy for his peers.¹⁸\n\nPaul was insulated from white Princeton by his almost exclusive confinement to the fairly large local black community and his attendance at an all-black school. He was not old enough to work for white people and had very little connection with them. There were some white children among his playmates, including a boy about his age, whose father owned a grocery a few doors from the Robeson house.¹⁹ But Paul belonged to a cohesive community where his identity was both powerful and strongly reinforced.\n\nMany members of Witherspoon recognized something extraordinary in their former preacher’s motherless son. They regarded him as a child of destiny. He wrote in his autobiography:\n\nI early became conscious—I don’t quite know how—of a special feeling of the Negro community for me. I was no different from the other kids of the neighborhood, and yet the people claimed to see something special about me. Whatever it was, and no one really said, they felt I was destined for great things to come. Somehow they were sure of it. I wondered at times about this notion that my future would be linked with the longed-for better days to come, but I didn’t worry about it. Being grown up was a million years ahead. Now was the time for play.²⁰\n\nThe Robeson family moved away from Princeton in 1907, when Paul was nine. Reverend Robeson had finally given up on the Presbyterian Church and switched to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion denomination. Assigned a minor pastorate in Westfield, New Jersey, with no church building, he had a small potential congregation. Though far fewer African-Americans lived in Westfield than in Princeton, the predominantly working-class white population was more accepting of blacks than Princeton’s elite.\n\nWilliam Drew started building a small church from the ground up. Paul helped his father carry bricks to the bricklayers. Meanwhile, they lived in the attic over a grocery store where William Drew worked, and they washed up in a shacklike extension at the rear of the store. It was a difficult transition for Paul. His close relatives, who had lived just around the corner from him in Princeton, were now thirty miles away; the black community was far smaller than Princeton’s; and his closest brother, Ben, had gone away to prep school. Visiting Princeton’s black community still meant being at home.²¹ Nevertheless, Paul gradually adjusted, and William Drew achieved a near miracle by finishing his construction of the small St. Luke African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on Downer Street, complete with a parsonage, in a little more than a year.\n\nIn the three years he lived in Westfield, Paul expanded his horizons in a seamless progression of busy days. He came to know more white people, frequently visiting the homes of his working-class schoolmates and always receiving a friendly welcome. Still, he felt the subtle difference between his unquestioned belonging to the black community and his qualified acceptance by whites. Fifty years later, he would comment, I wasn’t conscious of it at the time, but now I realize that my easy moving between the two racial communities was rather exceptional. For one thing, I was the respected preacher’s son, and then, too, I was popular with the other boys and girls because of my skill at sports and studies.²²\n\nPaul’s popularity with his peers was probably due far more to his athletic skills than to his proficiency at his studies. Practicing sports and playing games stood him in good stead in escaping his grief over his mother’s death. Some days he would finish his homework early, practice by himself, and then play with his schoolmates until darkness fell.\n\nSince Westfield had too few black children for a segregated school system—unlike Princeton—Paul attended fifth and sixth grades in Westfield’s integrated elementary school and then entered seventh grade in the integrated junior high school. Tall and gangly at twelve, but wiry strong, fast, and exceedingly agile, he was already capable of competing at the high school level. Ben, who by this time was attending Biddle University,²³ had taken over from Bill as Paul’s baseball and football coach with stellar results: when Paul was still in seventh grade, the Westfield High School baseball team recruited him to play shortstop as a regular.²⁴\n\nAt about the time of William Drew’s move to Westfield, Paul’s brother Reed—hotheaded and aggressively independent at twenty-one—suddenly turned up as a dropout from Lincoln University at the start of his senior year. Paul was overjoyed by his older brother’s return, but Reverend Robeson was deeply aggrieved by Reed’s failure to complete his college education and by his cavalier refusal to offer any explanation"
