It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.” To me, these words by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428 BC – 348 BC) resonate as truly and with as much strength today as they must have when they were first uttered over two thousand years ago. As the quintessential universal language, I believe that music has a profound effect on both mind and spirit. Music has an ability to express who we were, what we are, and what we can become. It picks up where words leave off and has the unique ability to unify people by transcending cultural boundaries and physical borders. If “a picture is worth a thousand words,” similarly, musical sound conveys a thousand images and expresses a seemingly endless multitude of emotions and innermost feelings. Indeed, I can think of no other art form that endeavors to elevate the human condition to ever-higher planes through a conscious manifestation of the subconscious. Whether teaching in the classroom or performing in the concert hall, it is a genuine privilege and my greatest pleasure to share my deep passion for music with those poised to listen.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAaron is an Assistant Professor of Theatre/Directing.

Morus (PhD University of Georgia, 2005) is an Associate Professor of Communication & Genocide Studies at Stockton University. She was a Fulbright Scholar in residence at the University of Belgrade’s Faculty of Political Sciences and the Center for Women’s Studies in 2009 and continues to serve as a volunteer and activist with Belgrade’s Women in Black, and Belgrade’s DAH Theatre.\n\nAt the core of her scholarship and pedagogy is the critical consideration of pre- and post-conflict discourses with attention to media, politics, popular thought and public memory. Her work centers mainly on the 1990s wars in the former Yugoslavia, with some attention to the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the Khmer Rouge Genocide in Cambodia, the Genocide of Guatemala’s Maya, and the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. Her past projects considered the impacts of Serbian historical narratives, as they are embedded within a range of public discourses, on the normalization of violence that accompanied the 1990s wars in the former Yugoslavia. Her current research considers the impacts of historical narratives on post-war discourses and the extent to which they influence regional sustainable stability and social repair. She is presently working on a book – a ten-year longitudinal study focusing on public memory and the Srebrenica Genocide. The study critically analyzes the ways in which locally-originating grassroots civil society organizations in Serbia and Bosnia are affecting post-conflict transition through carefully crafted, consciously counter-hegemonic, vernacular rhetorical strategies deployed in public space.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPh.D., University of Georgia\n\nAREAS OF EXPERTISE\n\nThe Rhetoric of Mass Violence & Genocide;\n\nThe break-up of Yugoslavia, The Bosnian War & its aftermath;\n\nGender & War;\n\nDiscourses of Memory;\n\nThe Rhetoric of Social Change;\n\nDiscourses of Gender, Race, Class & Ethnicity\n\nCOURSES\n\nCOMM 3309: Media, Civil Rights, & Social Change;\n\nCOMM 3312: Media in Times of War;\n\nCOMM 4601: Senior Seminar;\n\nGAH 2358: Perspectives on Women;\n\nGAH 3248: Media, Public Perception & Genocide;\n\nGIS 3418: Witness to Genocide;\n\nGIS 3658: Women & Genocide\n\nSELECTED RECENT RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS:\n\nMorus, Christina M, (2012) War Rape and the Global Condition of Womanhood: Learning from the Bosnian War.
