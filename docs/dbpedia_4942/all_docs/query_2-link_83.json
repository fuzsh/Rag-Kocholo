Johnson III ('60) and Debbie (Williams) Cave, who attended the university from 1981-84. Current Virginia Tech students on the board include Stevan's friends James Loudon and Patrick Cave.\n\nFunded by grants, private gifts and corporate donations, the organization offers assistance nationwide to families of childhood cancer victims.

Two computerized career planning programs, Discover and Virginia VIEW, allow clients to assess their interests, talents, abilities, temperaments, and desires, then determine which occupations best suit them.\n\nThe program is directed by faculty members Johnnie Miles and Charles Humes, with individual career consultations being conducted by doctoral students under the supervision of licensed professional counselors. Seminars and workshops are planned for the spring on a variety of topics, including creative job-search strategies, developing a winning resume, and evaluating benefits packages.\n\nMiles has a simple, matter-of-fact way of describing the process of career counselling: \"People come in, take a hard look at where they are, and determine where they want to be.\" The process, she says, is one of on-going self-assessment. \"We are strongly committed to the idea that career preparation is an integral part of higher education, and that it continues beyond graduation and throughout the life span,\" Miles says.\n\nServices of the Career Development Center are offered to Virginia Tech students and alumni free of charge. For information on career consultations, workshops, and job data banks, call the Virginia Tech College of Education's Career Development Center at (703) 698-6060.\n\nFormer administrator Bell dies\n\nWilson B.

He received a doctorate of veterinary medicine from Cornell University and became an associate in bacteriology at that university. In 1946, he returned to Virginia Tech as professor of veterinary medicine.\n\nVirginia Tech Magazine Volume 15, Number 3 Spring 1993"
