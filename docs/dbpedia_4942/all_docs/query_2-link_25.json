        "text": "Fueled by a vision of exceptional homes paired with world-class amenities at a competitive price, Ed leveraged his extensive experience in residential sales to build a thriving homebuilding company.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ed began his real estate career with Coldwell Banker and joined the Del Webb Corporation shortly thereafter as Director of Corporate Sales.\n\nSensing terrific opportunities in Arizona’s real estate market, he and two associates left Del Webb and formed a real estate company.\n\nRiver Bend in Bullhead City was their first development.\n\nPinewood, located south of Flagstaff, came next with more than 3.200 homesites sold.\n\nIn 1972, Ed, along with partners, started his first active adult community, Sun Lakes. This project sold approximately 10,000 homes and reached sellout success in 2006.\n\nFrom the 1980s through the 2000s, Robson Resort Communities flourished, adding numerous 55+ communities to its portfolio across Arizona and Texas.\n\nToday, more than 50,000 people call a Robson Resort Community home offering luxurious home designs, resort-style amenities, and an abundance of social opportunities. Ed’s success and longevity in the housing industry is a direct result of his passion for creating excellence in every Robson Resort Community.\n\nThe concept of providing active adults a resort lifestyle was pioneered by Ed Robson in the early ’70’s. Robson acquired 2,560 acres of farmland in a limited partnership for the Sun Lakes development near Chandler, Arizona, in 1972. Initially, the partnership only sold lots and mobile homes in order to compete with Sun City. Robson survived the energy crisis in the mid-seventies and bought out his partners.\n\nIn late 1976, Robson made the decision to switch from offering mobile homes to on-site built single family homes. Sun Lakes continued to flourish during the next two decades despite record-high interest rates in the early 1980s and the downturn in the housing market in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Now sold-out, Sun Lakes is comprised of approximately 10,000 homes, five golf courses, five country clubs, two shopping centers and a medical and education center.\n\nRecognizing the development potential of the Tucson area, SaddleBrooke opened in 1987, the second Robson Resort Community in Arizona. Nestled in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, SaddleBrooke showcases panoramic mountain views, stunning high-Sonoran desert terrain, and world-class resort amenities. Close to 10,000 people currently live at SaddleBrooke, which features 63 holes of golf, three country clubs, the DesertView Sports Club & Performing Arts Center, on-site convenience market & retail center, and an array of activities.\n\nAfter weathering the savings & loan crisis of the late 1980s, SunBird, located in Chandler, Arizona, was acquired from the REO portfolio of a St. Louis savings and loan institution in 1989. This active adult community, which features an 18-hole executive golf course and a 40,000 sq. ft. clubhouse, was sold-out in 1998 with more than 1,600 homes built.\n\nThe next development in Metro Phoenix was PebbleCreek, a Robson Resort Community located in the city of Goodyear. Launched in 1993, PebbleCreek helped establish the southwest valley of Phoenix as a popular destination for homebuyers in the 1990s. More than 10,000 homeowners currently call PebbleCreek home and enjoy a variety of resort-style amenities including 54 holes of championship golf, two country clubs, state-of-the-art Sports & Aquatics facilities featuring a 20-court Pickleball complex and a Performance Arts Theater featuring local and national acts.\n\nQuail Creek, located in southern Arizona, was acquired in the summer of 1999 and had sold less than 100 homes in ten years. After developing new products, amenities and activities, Quail Creek has sold more than 2,000 homes. Amenities now include 27 holes of championship golf, a luxurious clubhouse, restaurant, indoor & outdoor sports facilities showcasing 16 Pickleball courts and a Creative Arts & Tech Center, all with the Santa Rita Mountains providing a picturesque backdrop.\n\nAfter many years of extensive research and feasibility studies in the Texas market, the first Robson Resort Community opened outside of Arizona, in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex with the official grand opening in May 2001. Robson Ranch, located south of Denton off I-35W, is now home to more than 4,500 homeowners who enjoy Texas retirement community living with resort-style amenities including championship golf, fitness, sports, creative arts, and much more.\n\nIn 2004, The Preserve at SaddleBrooke was unveiled, located within the northern section of SaddleBrooke in North Tucson. The Preserve offers the pinnacle of country club living with luxurious homes situated on premium homesites, world-class amenities and dramatic mountain views of the Santa Catalina Mountains.\n\nWith Sun Lakes near sell-out status, Robson Ranch Arizona was launched in August 2005 to meet the housing demand for active adults in the southeast area of metro Phoenix. Situated in the Eloy/Casa Grande area, Robson Ranch Arizona offers an abundance of social and recreational opportunities. Multi-million dollar amenities include the Ranch House, spanning 39,000 sq. ft. under roof, the Sports & Aquatics complex, championship golf, pro shop, restaurant, softball, 16 Pickleball courts and more.\n\nIn 2008, SaddleBrooke Ranch opened just north of Tucson, just a few miles from its sister community, SaddleBrooke. Beautiful mountain vistas from almost every direction provide a scenic backdrop to luxury homes and stunning resort-style amenities. In addition to championship golf, walking trails and La Hacienda Club featuring indoor & outdoor pools, fitness center, Bistro, multi-purpose rooms and spa, SaddleBrooke Ranch currently showcases the largest pickleball complex in Southern Arizona with 24 courts.\n\nAn extensive selection of new amenities was introduced at several Robson Resort Communities to provide homeowners an exceptional resort-style environment.\n\nIn 2010, La Hacienda Club opened at SaddleBrooke Ranch offering a wealth of amenities including indoor and outdoor pools, the fully equipped Viva Fitness Center, tennis and Pickleball courts, Esperanza Spa, and so much more.\n\nQuail Creek expanded its fitness facilities with the debut of Anza Athletic Club in 2011. The state-of-the-art facility features cardio and weight machines, multi-purpose fitness studios, and a wellness room. In addition, a Pickleball complex made its debut at Quail Creek in 2013 featuring 16 courts, ramada and restrooms.\n\nSignificant amenities were added in 2015 at Robson Ranch Arizona, PebbleCreek and Quail Creek. The stunning Ranch House is the newest social hub at Robson Ranch Arizona and features the Hermosa ballroom/auditorium with stage, multi-purpose room, lounge and coffee bar, a private dining room and more.

The amenities expansion includes a 24 court Pickleball Complex with 12-lighted courts and a ramada with restrooms, dog park, and pro shop featuring a putting green, driving range, and practice bunker. A Creative Arts & Tech Center opened in July 2018.
