HISTORY is not always at home in an art gallery. But at the Johnson & Johnson World Headquarters Art Gallery this month, the life and times of Paul Robeson are set forth in an unusual exhibition that opens a window onto the artist's life and his moment in this nation's history.

"Paul Robeson: Actor and Activist" chronicles the life of New Jersey's native son who became an internationally renowned performing artist and advocate of human rights. Comprising photographs, paintings, sculpture and prints, the show employs art as the vehicle for history.

This unusual show is also the product of an unusual collaboration. The curator is Michael J. Bzdak of Johnson & Johnson's corporate art program, along with Kathleen Augelli and Benjamin F. Lambert of the company's law department. Although Ms. Augelli and Mr. Lambert are both experienced in the intricacies of trademarks and patents, this is their first effort at museum curatorship.

Ms. Augelli and Mr. Lambert said their idea for the show was sparked by reading of Martin Duberman's 800-page biography, "Paul Robeson," published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1989.

"After reading the book and discussing it," Mr. Lambert said, "we were just so fascinated by the life of Paul Robeson. We both knew who he was, knew of the mystery that surrounds him, but the book opened up a new vista about the person."

Ms. Augelli said she had wanted to know more about the man since childhood. "I knew the name Paul Robeson because I had heard it when I was growing up," she said. "But it was all sort of clouded, not quite clear. And I swore many years ago I would someday find out who this man was and what he was all about. And that's what I did."
