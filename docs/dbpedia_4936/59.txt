(WXYZ) â€” The Michigan State University Board of Trustees appointed a new interim president Thursday morning.

The board accepted former Interim President John Engler's resignation and named Satish Udpa as his successor.

Udpa currently serves as the executive vice president of Administrative Services at MSU.

Udpa, who joined MSU in 2001, currently serves as the executive vice president of Administrative Services at MSU. He has previously served as the Dean of the College of Engineering and Chair of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, according to the university's website.

Chairwoman Dianne Byrum introduced a resolution that Udpa be appointed interim president and speed up John Engler's resignation to be effective Thursday. The board approved the resolution unanimously.

"Engler's statements about sexual assault have been extremely hurtful," Byrum said.

Engler's resignation came after his comment that survivors of the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal are "enjoying the spotlight."

Survivors have long-argued that Engler was not right for the university. Those who were not part of the university's original settlement with the first 333 survivors attended the meeting.

They believe their cases are not getting the attention they deserve after Engler's comments that MSU is done investigating Nassar abuse reports.

MSU plans to name a new president this June before the next academic year.
