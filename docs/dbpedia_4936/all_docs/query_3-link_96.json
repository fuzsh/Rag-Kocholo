The first few football games found awe struck and excited frosh contributing a large percentage of the cheering. Student Life, A SENATORIAL DEBATE over the elections code caused a delay, but freshman elections were finally held. Spurs helped check ID cards. Freshmen were oriented with the help of · service groups, advisors and the best teacher of all, experience. They took tours, voted, joined organizations, and were quickly assimi­ lated into Trojan Life. The traditions of Troy had to be learned, and the frosh steeled them­ selves to memorize the Greek alphabet and what \"three no trump\" means. KNIGHT Vince Stephano introduces new Trojans to the famou s \"Column of Troy,\" a gift to USC from the Turkish government. There is a combination of the cultural and the casual among students at Troy. The same people you see at a concert or lecture you may play bridge with in the Grill the next day. \"Grill-hour\" is a magic word. Some students even plan their schedule of classes around this time. A coke, cigarette smoke, the shuffle of cards, and the noise of a jukebox all con­ tribute to the habit forming atmosphere of the Grill. It is a place to make dates, study, and grab a coke between classes. It provides opportunities to see old friends and make new ones. The Grill adds immeasur­ ably to the social side of Trojan Life.

THE ROW ECHOED to the yells of Trojans at a night­ time rall y before the Georgia football game. \"DARKNESS AT NOON\" was one of numerous outstanding forums presented to students by the phi]osophy department. Co-ordinator of the pro­ grams was Dr. William Werkmister. 21 22 Trojan Republicans turned out en masse to welcome the Vice-president. He was ac­ companied by his wife, Pat, a former Trojan. Mr. Nixon spoke at a University spon­ sored First Voters' Convoca­ tion. USC students were stimu­ lated to ponder current po­ litical affairs and problems through the speeches offered by the Convocations. QUESTIONS written by students were presented to Mr. Nixon for answer and comment. MR. NIXON and Dr. Topping survey the crowds of students that represented fifteen colleges and universities in the West. THOUSANDS of students and professors crowded the lawn in front of Doheny Library for the Vice-president's speech. Ten o'clock classes were cance lled for the event. WITH ARMS RAISED, the Vice-president accepts a tu­ multous welcome from cheering Trojans. National Elections Bring ... NIXONETTES in red, white and blue costumes, campaigned feverishly for the vice-president and lent a little glamour to the demonstrations. 24 The second First Voters' Convoca­ tion, which was held on November first, gave Trojans a chance to hear another important campaign speech. Senator Kennedy received an enthusiastic wel­ come from the Trojan Young Demo­ crat Club and other loyal Demos on campus. This, the Senator's second visit to the USC campus, proved as successful as the first. SENATOR Kennedy's arrival gave Trojan [ Democrats a chance to shake hands with their favorite candidate. , WITH BOVARD TOWER in the back­ ground, thousands of supporters and op­ ponents heard Senator Kennedy speak.

Under the direction of Captain Allan Hancock, the Velero makes research possible all year long. ANXIOUS SCHOLARS grabbed an extra minute of study before a big test. Among favorite spots for last minute study­ ing was the entrance to Founders Hall. 26 The opportunities available at Troy are almost unlimited. Facilities for re­ search, study, social life and practical work experience are within the grasp of every Trojan. All methods of study are employed - from observation on the deck of a ship to the traditional seat in Doheny Library. Students take time off scholarly pursuits to engage in sports and Row activities, thus keep­ ing the spirit of competition alive. PHI SIGMA KAPPA PLEDGE RELAYS have been held annu­ ally since 1941. This year the victorious fraternity was Tau Epsilon Phi. In between classes and TGIFs, Trojans could be seen at various campus occupations and pursuits. Out­ side work for classes kept some busy, while others held part-time jobs or just gossiped around the ice­ cream stand. \"NOW TURN THAT KNOB.\" Language students are familiar with the booths in the language laboratory. First year language classes require one hour a week in the lab. EVERY LIVING GROUP is familiar with the eternal hasher. These young men work at dorms and on the Row. They specialize in flirting with pretty co-eds. FUDGE BARS and sidewalk sundaes satisfied hungry Trojans on their way to and from classes. Anna and Herman athan always served a smile with their ice-cream. 27 Homecoming Highlights ... Homecoming 1960 incorporated many new and old Troyditions. Trolios, the Alumni Picnic, the crown­ ing of the 1960 Helen of Troy helped build the spirit and enthusiasm that was evident at the climax of the week: the game itself. Troy Jubilee was a featured event of Homecoming Week and promises to become one of USC's favorite traditions. It was a combina­ tion of the old Troyland Carnival and the Homecom­ ing Dance. Over 3,000 people attended and its suc­ cess was a tribute to the hard work of Homecoming Chairman Jim Childs and his committee. It was fitting and proper to end this exciting week with the sweet taste of revenge, as Troy triumphed over her arch­ rival, UCLA, 17 to 6 . • TOMMY TROJAN was well protected from UCLA wrath by a plastic covering and alert Squires. 28 COORDINATING the hundreds of small details that Home­ coming 1960 presented were Committee members Mike Robin­ son, Bill McQuoid, Bob Biheller, Chuck Sutton, Eber Jacques, Julianne Bescos, Jim Preston, Jim Childs, Chairman; Sue Banks, co-chairman; Bob Whitehill, Mac Kerr, and Robin Angelica. -:,¾' \\ :;:- ... , , '\",f '-'> ,t \"THE WIZARD of UC\" cap­ tured first place for Tau Kappa Epsilon and Delta Delta Delta in the Trolios Show.

They suffered disappointments, but these were compensated for by the revenge­ ful triumph over UCLA. After games, representatives of Troy could be seen at fraternity open houses, Julie's, Troy House, or home by the fire-drying off. The season over, Trojans were heard to mutter, \"Next year-the Rose Bowl.\" 35 Trojans sing ... Rancho Los Amigos hospital was the scene of the first all-University Christ­ mas Project. Chairman Maryalice Her­ rick organized entertainment, gifts, and caroling for the patients. Trojans visited most of the 2100 hospitalized persons. The students were divided into groups and escorted by Spurs and Squires; they visited the wards, and spoke with the patients. About 250 students supported the event which the Red Cross termed a \"great success.\" VOLUNTEER Red Cross workers wel­ comed the students upon their arrival at the hospital. 36 MORE Christmas carols were sung in the audi­ torium by members of the Glee Club.

BRA VE BLOOD DONORS smiled weakly at the ap­ proaching nurse, but later discovered, \"It didn't hurt at all!\" And Blood Bloodless Trojans walked on campus with their \"badge of courage,\" a white arm bandage, as a symbol of their bravery. Pledges for a pint of blood were taken by committee members in front of the Student Union. The Drive culminated in the actual donations at the Methodist Church. Red Cross nurses handled the giving of the blood, while committee members kept track of which dorm, class, and organization had given the most. The senior class, EVK, and the TKEs, Squires, NROTC and TEPs all contributed heavily. Chairman Jim West coordinated the event, in which USC competes with UCLA for the largest percentage of donations. JIM WEST, Blood Drive Chairman, and Dick Martin extracted a pint of blood from the \"Iron Man,\" Tommy Trojan, who was one of the more willing volunteers. 39 , ,. ~-. SOME OF THE FINEST operas and dramatic presenta­ tions in Los Angeles were available on the USC campus. 40 CALYPSO came to Troy through the efforts of the USC Steel Band.

Classroom collections, contests, and a dance at Town and Gown, complete with door prizes, provided the means of obtaining donations. The hard working com­ mittee was led by Chairman Ann Marcus. They begged, borrowed, and laughingly coerced money from Trojans who claimed to be \"poverty stricken\" but gave anyway. Fraternities and sororities backed favorite personalities for the titles of Mr. and Miss Trojanality, and finally enough money was collected to satisfy the dutiful committee. And Funds PENNIES, NICKELS, and dimes filled Troy Chest money boxes, as students contributed on behalf of their choices for Mr. and Miss Trojanality. TOWN AND GOWN witnessed the climax of the Troy Chest Drive. The committee sponsored a dance, at which the winners of the Mr. and Miss Trojanality contests were revealed. IMMUNIZATION BUTTONS were sold for one dollar and protected generous Trojans from eager donation col­ lectors. 43 Food.

ALL THIS AND GOOD MUSIC TOO! The Alpha Tau Omega Trio provided a background of harmony for Carnival-going Trojans. LADY LUCK and chance intrigued Trojan gamblers at the Alpha Omicron Pi \"Wheel of Fortune.\" Carolyn Cooper acted as barker for the booth. BELLY DANCERS always draw a large crowd, and the Arab Students had another successful year with the sponsorship of this booth. FOOD BOOTHS ARE POPULAR at all carni­ vals, and the Indian Students Association capitalized on this for their part in the Y Carnival. 45 TWO DAYS OF VOTING found long lines of students waiting to cast their ballots. Election Commissioner Art Kay was in charge of the procedure. 1-, I ,-, 1,..., u1 · 111 ELECTION RESULTS were announced at a crowded and ten­ sion-filled Senate meeting.

Here, Mike Guhin, Jim Harmon, and Hugh Helm speak at EVK dorm. THE SURF CALLED and Trojans raced to get their boards in the water. Balboa, Malibu, Laguna, Doheny, and Dana Point saw surfers and sun bathers enjoying Easter vacation. CARS FILLED with skis, poles, boots, and eager Trojans journeyed to Mammoth over the Easter holidays. From left are Ced Berggren, Cookie Rotollo, and Roger Adams. A sigh of relief was heard at USC the last week of March as Trojans prepared to leave for Spring vacation. Classes were out for a whole week and students scattered to relax and enjoy themselves. They were seen anywhere and every­ where, from Fort Lauderdale to Balboa to Mammoth. Skiing, surfing, studying and partying filled their time and they returned tanned and rested to face ten week exams, Songfest, finals, and . . . Monday morning. 47 CHANCELLOR von KleinSmid headed the parade down University Avenue in which dance groups and representa­ tives from . various countries participated. All entries in the parade were dressed in elaborate costumes typifying their cultural heritage. Ages of the participants ranged from tiny tots to adults. Troy served a~ the meeting place for people from all over the world during the World Festival of Nations. A pa­ rade, dance demonstrations, and a ban­ quet for the counsels stationed in Los Angeles highlighted the day. Bob Jani was in charge of the event, at which members of the various service groups acted as guides and hostesses. 48 DANCERS from many far-off countries demonstrated the traditional folk dances of their respective nations. LUNCHES were served to all participants in the festival by the Red Cross. Spurs and Chimes helped distribute the food. The 1960-61 varsity season was conspicuously successful as Trojan speakers left their mark in national competition. Traveling to Oregon, Ari­ zona, Kansas, and Nevada, the team competed in extemporaneous and im­ promptu speaking and debate. They climaxed their season with the West Point National Finals. Hours of re­ search and practice are necessary to qualify as winners in the strongly competitive tournaments. Under the direction of James McBath, and Boyd Lemon, squad captain, Troy's Debate Team brought more than its share of honors to USC. LEADING the debate squad to victory were (seated ) Jerry Borden, junior varsity coach ; Boyd Lemon, squad captain ; John Fraser, assistant varsity coach.

A Sigma Chi, Tim served on the committee for four years. 50 Songfest ASSISTING Tim Elbourne in the many problems Songfest presented was co-chairman Joan Prestin. 1961 Troy's most spectacular annual event made its ap­ pearance on -May 13 in the Hollywood Bowl. First held in 1954, Songfest is one of the nation's largest collegiate singing productions. The 1961 presentation was under the direction of Chairman Tim Elbourne. Dean Robert Downey acted as official host and Henry Mancini was guest conductor. Over 10,000 people wit­ nessed the result of weeks of practice and rehearsal by sororities, fraternities, and professional groups. Predictions were made as to who would win \"Tommy,\" but no one was sure of the outcome and a feeling of tenseness filled the Bowl as the first note was sung. Judges deliberated, considered, -measured and de­ cided while Henry Mancini led the participants in the grand finale. SONGFEST EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE members included: Bill Heeres, Allan Hoffenblum, Joan Nealy, Tim Elbourne, Joan Prestin, Bob Sangster, Chuck Sutton, Larry Bishop, Dianne Riley, Judy Jones, Eber Jaques, and Dave Patterson. 51 PRACTICE SESSIONS were usually more fun than work as fraternities and sororities got together to harmonize. 52 Songfest directors nagged, poked, prodded, and screamed at their groups to get them past prelim judging and into Song­ fest. After the first barrier was crossed, the harried song chairmen groomed the singers by constant rehearsal and practice. In perfect shape at last, with the timing down pat and the harmony in tune .. . they rehearsed some more. The directors never seemed to be satisfied, but as the fin. al dead­ line approached, hoarse Trojans forgave them and only smiled as they heard, \"OK gang, let's try it again.\" Brings. Practic~ Prelims PRELIMINARY JUDGING was held in Bovard Auditorium. Entrants trembled and whispered, \"Will we make Songfest?\" Results were announced and passing groups held parties in honor of prelim victories. And CHOSEN as guest conductor for the 1961 Songfest was Henry Man­ cini. Mr. Mancini, most recent on the list of well-known Songfest conductors, is famed as an ar­ ranger and orchestra leader. THE LAST NOTE died away and it was all over but the shouting. Participants left the stage and w~ited impatiently for the announcement of the wmners. The Big Night Stage fright, butterflies, and trembling anticipation hit Trojan singers as they prepared to go on stage. \"You're on next,\" they heard, and the bright lights suddenly glared in their eyes. They sang, smiled, and made their exit. Then they had to wait . . . it seemed like an eternity . . . until the master of ceremonies proclaimed the new owners of the coveted \"Tommy.\" WINNING A \"TOMMY\" more than made up for the hours of lost sleep and study time involved in an entry in Songfest. 55 HIGHLIGHTING the week at Troy Camp is the camp picture, for which the children proudly don their Troy Camp tee shirts. TROY CAMP CHAIRMAN Roy McDiarmid was responsi­ ble for organizing the activities of his committee. Several years as a committee member prepared him for this job. 56 HEAD COUNSELORS Bob Chettle and Faye Henderson conducted a training program for camp counselors during the spring semester. Troy Camp Hosts L. A. Kids ,,,. EXCITED, A WED, and even a little scared, new Troy Campers board the bus for camp.

SWIMMING, crafts, hiking, and horseback riding keep the campers busy during the day. A special counselor is selected to teach the children swimming and they participate with smiles and screams of delight. Fresh air, blue skies, and tall pine trees welcome over one hundred campers to Troy Camp every ye;r. The children who are selected to attend the camp would otherwise have spent the summer in the city. A hard-working committee spends an entire school year planning the week long camping trip. Held at Camp Buckhorn in Idlewild, the project is completely supervised by students. The 1961 session will mark the eighteenth year Troy Camp has been in progress. · ,.-- - ---~, --- . ·~ ... --~~SJ --~--·. ,, ....... :-·i---i i...~ . . COMMENCEMENT brought tears and smiles and that precious diploma. Graduates said good-bye to members of their class and made promises to meet at their first reunion. Commencement Closes Year Summer 1961 found Trojans working, vacationing, and studying in all parts of the world. Europe, Mexico, the mountains, and the beach called some, and others could be seen back at Trny for summer school. Grad­ uates stepped into a new world and a new life during the summer. For the first time in many years they would not be returning to school in September. For them, Troy was already no more than a memory ... for the returning students it was a reality to be recog­ nized again in three short months. 58 FINALS WERE OVER and students waited for the mailman and their grade cards. An \"A\" in that four unit class would certainly start the summer off right. 60 Bill Steigerwalt President Sharon Kelly Vice-President ASSC Progress, maturity, competency - these words best describe the Associated Students' government for this new decade. This year's task, the implementation of a new form of student leadership, has been completed and tells an impressive story. It is a tale of more than one hundred pieces of student legislation accepted by the University community, of new and varied programs for student participation and enjoyment, and of student voice expressed in all areas of University and community plan­ nmg. Under the capable leadership of President Bill Steigerwalt, a complex administrative sys­ tem was introduced. While 1961 has seen progress and change-more perhaps than in any single ASSC term-it is only the begin­ ning of the future greatness that will mark this University's student leadership. Bill, besides being ASSC President, was a member of Blue Key, Knights, and Theta Xi Fraternity. He was also treasurer of his fresh­ man class, junior class president, and Greater \"U\" Chairman.

Ron Sherman School of Business Field of Study Presidents Elected each spring by the majors of their respective schools, the Field of Study Presidents exert valuable leadership within their own schools. These busy leaders take an active part in university affairs, preside over their school councils, and plan events which center around their fields of study. The school president's duty is to corre­ late student activities with academic activities. The school councils suggest legislation to their Senators, who, as ex-officio members of the councils, express the wishes of their -constituencies on the floor of the ASSC Senate.

For the first time, Senators were elected from their fields of study according to the method determined by the new ASSC Consti­ tuition. Colorful Wednesday night meetings, vigorous debates, and frequent argument added excitement and human interest to the agenda. Most important legislation were the Finance Code, the AMS Minimum Standards Bill, and the controversial Elections Code. \"ALL HAIL TO ALMA MATER ... \" rings from the Senate Chambers on third floor Student Union as weary Senators bring another meeting to a close. Bitter enemies soon become friends again, for differences are traditionally resolved over a cup of coffee at Julie's following the meeting. .....

Department Heads implemented ASSC policy, planned and coordinated long-range programs, and supervised the activities of the committees under each department. The Department Heads were most frequently seen run• · ning around third floor Student Unio1 ◄ or huddled in conference in Bill Stei' erwalt's office. Lynn Sperrow Student Activities Committee Chairmen COMMITTEE Chairmen under the department of general services are Don Gamble, finances; Paula Asel and, personnel; and Art Kay, elections. There were seventeen commit­ tee chairmen in Bill Steigerwalt's administrative arm this year. Each was responsible for the suc­ cessful execution of his commit­ tee's duties. These chairman and their committee members worked diligently to produce a successful year of student activities. RALLY chairman Jack Seymour, URA chairman Jill Speed, and foreign students chairman Mary Chatterton all worked under the department of student affairs. UNDER THE department of public relations are committee chairmen Dennis Metz­ ler, alumni-parents; Linda Barton, high school relations; Jim Loupy, internal public relations; Judy Ostergard, student speakers ; and Doc O'Conner, student survey. COMMITTEE chairmen under the department of student services were Roy McDiarmid, Trop Camp; Ann Marcus, Troy Chest, and Dann Moss, Greater U. BOB SANGSTER was chairman of the special events committee. Joan Prestin, Songfest co-chairman, and ed Shankman, student activities, were also committee chairmen under the department of student activities. Sara Marrow Secretary Karen Hubenthal Treasurer Carol Ann White President AWS Associated Women Students is the governing body of all the women on campus. They direct and plan the majority of programs and ac­ tivities for Trojanes. The core of A WS are the executive cabinet, which is representative of all campus women's organizations, and also a ten-woman associate cabinet. Highlighting this year's activities were the USC version of the national \"Great Debates\" - Political Scene 1960, a big-little sister orientation program and the IA WS State and National Con­ ventions. Leading A WS through this very successful year were President Carol Ann White, Vice-President Kay Yunker, Secretary Sara Marrow, and Treasurer Karen Hubenthal.

ORDER OF THE LAUREL was presented to Lucia Kapetanich (center) for outstanding achievement while at Troy. Dr. Robert Downey presented the coveted award while Sue Laemmle, who won several awards for outstanding scholarship, looks on. MEETINGS and more meetings are re­ quired to plan the excellent A WS program for the year. 67 68 AMS The largest organization on .the USC campus is the AMS which includes all the male students on campus. The As­ sociated Meri Students spent most of its effort in planning a new and effec­ tual program for the coming year. Constitutional and regulatory changes will be presented next year to make AMS a more functional body. An innovation this year was the Awards Banquet to take the place of the lacking A wards Assembly of the past. Other ideas are extending the Knothole Club to baseball as well as football and having an annual Kick­ off Men's Dinner.

Judicial Courts The Judicial Courts attempt to help the stu­ dent with his problems and not act as a polic­ ing body to pronounce his sentence. Although the Courts have jurisdiction over cases involv­ ing social conduct, dress regulations, and vio­ lations of the academic standards, a counseling rather than sentencing policy is attempted to be followed.

Staff members had an invalu­ able course in public relations. In keeping with the tradition of every El Rod, the book for 1961 has presented all aspects of the Trojan life. To do this, over 50,000 photographs were viewed by staff members, who eventually chose some 10,000 determined to be most representative. Many thousands of words of copy were written, thousands of statistics searched, and the copy, when completed, was read and reread. Eventually, the 1961 El Rodeo became a reality.
