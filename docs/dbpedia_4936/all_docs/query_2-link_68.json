        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nSee also: Part One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Four\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/the-magic-factory-part-four-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-individual-films-and-miscellaneous-titles/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nV. Screenwriters and Screenwriting\n\nWhen I refer to myself as an anti-auteurist I realize I may be creating some confusion, since it should be obvious to the casual reader of these pages that I also honor a number of favored filmmakers. Most of these, however, are or were either writer-directors (Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Preston Sturges, John Huston, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, Samuel Fuller, Blake Edwards, Paul Mazursky, Robert Benton, Oliver Stone); directors who could have taken screenwriter credit on almost any movie they made, and sometimes did (David Lean, Peter Bogdanovich, Sidney Lumet); almost never did (Alfred Hitchcock); never did (Leo McCarey, Howard Hawks); or who habitually worked closely with screenwriters to develop the movies they directed (Ford, Cukor, William Wyler, Martin Ritt, John Schlesinger). Perhaps it’s a limitation in me, but I have never been able to fathom how so many movie critics could embrace the misrepresentation of the French theory — which was far more selective and referred only to certain filmmakers — and warp it, as Andrew Sarris did, to suggest that every movie director is the “author” of any picture he or she makes. And my mystification is centered on one simple fact: That critics are writers too. Why are they so hot to strip the credit from others?\n\nAs a result of this madness, any hack or beginner can slap a possessive credit on a movie, even if the script he’s shooting is the seventeenth draft of a screenplay that’s been re-written by a dozen different writers, only two or three of whom will likely be credited. Look up any movie title on any online search engine and when it pops up the first entry will read, “A film by…” Nearly as bad, even as great a home video producer as Criterion reflexively places either that or an apostrophe and an “s” on the cover of every disc, even when to do so is patently absurd, as in its release of the 1952 The Importance of Being Earnest which it describes as “Anthony Asquith’s.” Surely the possessive attribution is due to Oscar Wilde? After all, even the New Testament admits that in the beginning was the word. But then the Word was God’s, and for an auteurist that can only mean a director.\n\n48. Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting William Goldman (1983)\n\nIt is entirely appropriate that the first volume on this list be Goldman’s, because no other screenwriter had or has ever written a book which became, and so quickly, immortal, at least in Hollywood. Goldman had already bequeathed to the world an epigraph — “Follow the money” — that is now so much a part of the common language it is routinely cited in reference to corruption by people who have no idea what its provenance is. (And it was Goldman, not “Deep Throat,” who came up with the phrase, in his screenplay for All the President’s Men.) To this he added a new one, which caught on so quickly it’s employed by the very sort of smug people its author was talking about when he first wrote it: In coining the dictum “Nobody knows anything,” Goldman was asserting that, essentially, all movies that become hits, unless they are sequels to other hits, are what is dismissively referred to as a “non-recurring phenomenon.” No one ever knows what will succeed, or fail, and those who think they do are in for some nasty surprises. Goldman also wrote a tertiary epigraph which is much less often quoted, but which should be tattooed on the inner eyelids of every screenwriter: “Screenplays are structure.” But they are not, as so many ignoramuses aver, “blueprints.” Change a blueprint while you’re building and see how well the construction stands.\n\nYou may agree or disagree with Goldman’s other observations (I for instance love the movie the writer/director Philip Kaufman made from Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, and would not have wanted to see the flag-waving version Goldman wrote) or see him as a facile, talented smart-ass. I don’t know how his novels, which I began to devour at age 15, might read for a younger audience, but I like his writing, both for print and movies, too much to find fault with much of it, although I do admit to being one of the few people I know who isn’t gaga over the movie of The Princess Bride, perhaps because I cherish the novel. In any case, it’s a safe bet no screenwriter will ever create, with a book, the stir Goldman did with this one.\n\n49. Backstory 1: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood’s Golden Age / Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s / Backstory 3: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 60s and Backstory 4: Interviewers with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s Edited by Patrick McGilligan (1988 – 2006)\n\nOne of our finest biographers of moviemakers, McGilligan also conducted (or edited those conducted by others) dozens of interviews with American screenwriters and published these in five volumes over 21 years. The Backstory series includes discussions with Niven Busch, Alan Scott (author or co-writer of many of the witty scripts for the Astaire-Rogers pictures), Donald Ogden Stewart, Philip Dunne, Julius J. Epstein, Richard Maibaum, Leigh Brackett, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Garson Kanin, Arthur Laurents, the blacklisted Ben Maddow, Stewart Stern, the ubiquitous blacklistee front Philip Yordan, Jay Presson Allen, George Axelrod, Walter Bernstein, Hitchcock’s great 1950s screenwriter John Michael Hayes, Ring Lardner Jr., Richard Matheson, Wendell Mayes, Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., Sterling Silliphant, Terry Southern, Robert Benton, Blake Edwards, Walter Hill, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Elmore Leonard, Paul Mazursky, Frederic Raphael, Alvin Sargent and Donald E. Westlake. That’s practically the entire history of the talkies to the turn of the century.\n\nI have not read McGilligan’s 2009 volume (Backstory 5: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1990s) largely because I have so little interest in movies of the 1990s. Once, in real time, was more than sufficient.\n\n50. Talking Pictures: Screenwriters in the American Cinema Richard Corliss (1975)\n\nUnique in its time, and even to today, Corliss’ second book on movie writers is a perceptive series of essays grouping together scenarists and their representative scripts — a sort of critical bestiary of screenwriters. Amid Corliss’ piquant observations: Anent the 1970 movie of MASH for which the blacklisted Ring Lardner, Jr. won an Oscar, that the much-loved Hawkeye and Trapper John often behave like fraternity bullyboys, no better than their adversaries and in some ways worse. Among his discoveries: That letters form such a strong narrative thread in the movies written or co-authored by Howard Koch (such as Casablanca) they are almost a personal signature.\n\nSee also: The Hollywood Screenwriters (A Film Comment Book) Richard Corliss (1972) The first of Corliss’ books on screenwriting is a collection of essays and interviews which, in Dr. Roseanne Welch’s apt words, “was a seminal work… in terms of bringing the screenwriter out from under the director’s shadow following a decade of auteurist criticism run rampant.” Frustratingly, in a 1990s issue of Film Comment Corliss repudiated his own 1970s defense of screenwriters. Oh, well; he also around that time began using the teenage neologism “way” in place of the perfectly acceptable and grammatically effective “much,” “far” and “more” which had sufficed for centuries. As, alas, did every other adult in America.\n\n51. The Hollywood Writers’ Wars Nancy Lynn Schwartz; Completed by Sheila Schwartz (1982)\n\nIf there is an essential volume of screenwriting history, the Schwartzes’ book is it. A wide-ranging account of the oft-thwarted attempt of a majority of scenarists to set up a union, the vicious opposition of the studios — which set up Screen Playwrights, their own, reactionary union, one most writers, quite properly, disdained or chafed under the yoke of — and the ultimate triumph of the Screen Writers Guild. The only sad thing about The Hollywood Writers’ Wars is that its author did not live to complete it, dying in agony of a brain tumor at an obscenely young age.\n\n52. Laughing Matters: On Writing M*A*S*H, Tootsie, Oh, God! and a Few Other Funny Things Larry Gelbart (1998)\n\nWith the possible exceptions of Ben Hecht and Billy Wilder, I don’t know of a wittier American writer of screenplays than Larry Gelbart, or a more verbally elegant one. (As a playwright and librettist he was scarcely less impressive, writing with Burt Shevelove the achingly funny book for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and, solo, the hilarious one for the Cy Coleman musical City of Angels, the great Iran-Contra satire Mastergate, the funny and terrifying Power Failure and the Volpone-inspired Sly Fox, the single funniest playscript I’ve ever read.) Although his range was great his comic work is marked by two related attributes: His general literacy, and his gift for malaprop, usually in the service of overturning a verbal cliché. Recently, while watching a DVD of sketches from “Caesar’s Hour” I heard a line that I would be willing to bet money was Gelbart’s: Caesar, playing a vaudeville hoofer, avers that he’s a great dancer because “I’ve got ten toes in my heart.” Although he seldom received solo credit as a screenwriter — Oh, God! was a notable exception — Gelbart’s writing infused the projects on which he worked with sparkling wit and a seriousness of purpose that is at the root of all great comedy. His memoir is an unalloyed delight.\n\nSee also: Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood Arthur Laurents (2000) Laurents virtually defined the word “prickly,” his later dogmatism sometimes destroying decades-long friendships. He was also, as a playwright, librettist and screenwriter, seldom as great as one hoped he would be. On the other hand, he was associated with three musical classics (West Side Story, Anyone Can Whistle and, especially, Gypsy) and wrote two exceptional screenplays whose subsequent movies their respective directors fucked up through insecurity and compromise: The Turning Point and The Way We Were. Whatever his flaws as a human being, Laurents’ memoir is an eye-opener, fascinating, articulate and compelling.\n\n53. Mad as Hell: The Life and Work of Paddy Chayefsky Shaun Considine (1994)\n\nOf all American playwrights and screenwriters, few were as drunk on words as Paddy Chayefsky. In the 1970s, going to see a movie written by Chayefsky (who was without a doubt the auteur of those pictures) was an exhilarating experience, the writers’ mordant wit and “outrageous” point of view, wedded to his dazzling verbosity, combining to give viewers almost an entirely new genre, something we might call rhetorical slapstick. Although Pauline Kael for one accused Chayefsky of being a reactionary, I don’t think she quite understood his position as a satirist. (Although certainly he behaved like a reactionary the night Vanessa Redgrave made her … is “ill-considered” the correct word?… acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.) Initially celebrated as the poet of kitchen-sink drama for television plays like “Marty” and “The Mother,” Chayefsky gradually began to explore larger ideas, and social comedy, and his dialogue became more expansive, less realistic and far more memorable. So memorable, in fact, that even when a broad audience embraced his expression, it didn’t always understand what he had in mind; in 1976, “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!” became the watch-cry of Americans who were fed up with… well, just about everything. What the people who repeated the phrase didn’t quite understand was that the aphorism was uttered in Network by an unbalanced schizophrenic. Considine does an admirable job of research and writing, capturing a nonpareil in all his nettlesome genius.\n\n54. The Craft of the Screenwriter: Interviews with Six Celebrated Screenwriters John Brady (1982)\n\nBrady’s splendid book consists of long and free-ranging interviews with five of the great screenwriters of the era and one interloper whose scant worth to movie history has, I think, been proven over time…and I am not referring to Paddy Chayefsky, William Goldman, Ernest Lehman, Neil Simon or Robert Towne. Interestingly, the most informative chapter for me as a young playwright was the Simon interview, which I hadn’t expected to enjoy as much as did, or to find so useful in a practical sense. (The book was published long before the emergence of the mature Simon of Lost in Yonkers, remember.) I only regret that Brady didn’t know, as no one did until fairly recently, that Edward Taylor co-authored every script Robert Towne took solo credit for. I haven’t pulled The Craft of the Screenwriter down from the shelf in years, so it will be interesting to re-read that interview in light of what Sam Wasson dug up on the matter for his book on Chinatown.\n\n55. What Happens Next: A History of American Screenwriting Marc Norman (2008)\n\nAn engaging, unusually intelligent history of screenwriting by a screenwriter, which may be a first. Norman, who wrote the vastly entertaining novel (and subsequent movie) Oklahoma Crude and later won an Oscar for a romantic comedy about Shakespeare I haven’t seen due to what I consider an impossible imbecility at its core (Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate’s Daughter indeed!) not only provides a rich, spirited novelistic history of the screenwriter in Hollywood but, as his title suggests, the contours of his craft: The what-happens-next? of celluloid storytelling.\n\nSee also: Some Time in the Sun: The Hollywood Years of F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Nathaniel West, Aldous Huxley and James Agee Tom Dardis (1976) Dardis’ book is especially useful for its debunking of the legend that surrounds Fitzgerald’s late Hollywood period, written as a refutation of Aaron Latham’s myth-reinforcing book Crazy Sundays.\n\nVI. Screenplays\n\nIn the 1970s, when “film studies” was everywhere, screenplays got published at a dizzying rate. Some now make one scratch one’s head in bemusement (Cisco Pike? Little Fauss and Big Halsey? Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid? Two-Lane Blacktop???) Others, like Easy Rider, were cutting continuity scripts, difficult to read… if you wanted to read the screenplay of Easy Rider, and I can’t imagine who would. The most enjoyable, like Goldman’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, were written to be read and are less concerned with outlining elaborate tracking shots (which anyway the director is going to ignore when he comes to shoot the thing) than with establishing and prolonging humor, mood and suspense. The best, such as those in the University of Wisconsin Warner Brothers series, contained long, informative histories of the pictures themselves and many frame blow-ups. But there were those who felt the practice of putting screenplays into print was a dubious idea at best; Larry McMurtry, himself a screenwriter, disdained them as “non-books.” He may have had a point.\n\nI admit I read them less often now than I did when I was an adolescent and becoming besotted with movies, needing movie books the way a dope-fiend needs a fix. But the best of them are pleasant keepsakes of movies that meant, and mean, something to me.\n\n56. The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay with Commentary on Every Scene, Interviews, and Little-Known Facts Jenny Jones, ed. (Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo) 2007\n\nI wish Jones would repeat this for The Godfather Part II, without doubt the finest sequel ever made to an already magnificent American movie. Otherwise, I have no complaints. It’s interesting, in light of so many auteurist directors taking the possessive line, that The Godfather pictures have all borne the credit “Mario Puzo’s.” Coppola, and Paramount, knew, at least in 1972, that Puzo’s was the name (other than Brando’s) the millions of readers of the novel were looking for in those posters and advertisements.\n\n57. Best American Screenplays 2 Sam Thomas, ed. (1991) Thomas edited three omnibus screenplay collections covering a wide range of genres. The second volume is the finest by a hair and includes My Man Godfrey, Citizen Kane, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Some Like it Hot, Terms of Endearment, The Lion in Winter, Julia and The Sting. Best American Screenplays (1985), the first volume includes of The Graduate, Sounder, Arthur and The Candidate and Best American Screenplays 3 1995 brings together The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Sunset Boulevard, Tender Mercies, Double Indemnity, Harold and Maude and Unforgiven. Although some of these classics have since been published separately most have not, so this trio constitutes a vest-pocket library of great American scenarios.\n\n58. Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot – The funniest film ever made: The complete book Alison Castle, ed; Interviews by Dan Aulier (Screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) (2002)\n\nWhen I was 15 I found a copy of the old Signet paperback edition of the Some Like it Hot screenplay in a second-hand bookshop. Reading it that afternoon, I quite literally fell off the family sofa. I had never read a funnier script before, and have only read one since that was as funny (Larry Gelbart’s play Sly Fox). Some Like it Hot was the favorite movie I’d never seen for years before I finally caught it at a university screening in the 1980s. It has since become my favorite movie, period. So you can imagine with what trembling anticipation I learned of this Taschen book, and how nearly orgasmic my pleasure on receiving it. The ne plus ultra of books devoted to a specific movie, this is a glorious package supplemented by interviews and limned by wonderful photographs and other graphics, with that great Wilder/Diamond screenplay at its center.\n\n59. The Big Brass Ring: An Original Screenplay Orson Welles and Oja Kodar (1987)\n\nIn the years before his death, Welles was shopping this incisive political thriller around Hollywood, hoping to snare one of the then-biggest male stars (Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty) to take the leading role of William Blake Pellarin, a gubernatorial candidate treading dangerous lines of intrigue and obsessed by the young beauty with whom he once had an incandescent affair. While interested, none of the actors he sought would bite, using the excuse that they couldn’t afford to cut their price for a single movie (not even one to be directed by Orson Goddamned Welles!) when one suspects the thing that really unnerved them was the presence in the scenario of Kim Minnaker, the politico’s mentor, an ageing gay man fighting his own, unrequited desire for his old student. That would have been, and should have been, the Welles role, as the girl would have been his companion and collaborator Oja Kodar’s. Frustratingly, it was never to be; Welles died without a deal… which in Hollywood I suppose means you’re really dead. But his and Kodar’s screenplay is marvelous: Witty, erudite, intelligent and, in the sequence in which Minniker, riding a Ferris wheel outside Blake’s hotel, is stopped just outside the window where, in agony, he watches the younger man having sex with his beloved, incendiary. It’s a shocking moment and one can only imagine, with regret, what Welles would have done with it, both as director and as actor. If you’ll pardon my quoting from my own centenary essay on Welles, “In a moment as sexually charged as anything in American movies, Pellarin becomes aware of this scrutiny, and his eyes lock with Minnaker’s. The description of this emotionally naked encounter, in the published script, is among the most breathtaking I’ve ever encountered in dramatic literature; it should have burned holes in the screen.”\n\n60. The Bonnie & Clyde Book David Newman & Robert Benton (1972)\n\nNo movie of the late-1960s aside from Midnight Cowboy (and, peripherally, The Wild Bunch, which wasn’t nearly as popular) had more of an impact on the American popular culture than Bonnie & Clyde, even if many Americans were unaware of them as the changes were happening. There was outrage at the form the picture took, seeming to be a comedy and abruptly exploding into bloody violence at mid-point, with considerably more to follow before the astonishing finale. The director, Arthur Penn, got much of the credit (and the blame) for the style, and certainly he and Dede Allen, the editor, were responsible for the movie’s electrifying kineticism. But so was Warren Beatty, who produced Bonnie and Clyde, starred as Clyde Barrow and hired everyone else involved, including Penn. (On the debit side, Beatty was also responsible for indications of Barrow’s homosexuality being removed from the picture.) But Bonnie & Clyde was a writer’s picture, or a writers’ picture, since it was entirely the product of two young men. Newman and Benton had been making a name for themselves as clever young Esquire magazine art directors and copywriters when they collaborated on the B & C screenplay and tried to get it made by François Truffaut. Beatty and Penn had enormous input into the original authors’ revisions to their script, and of course Penn was rightly praised for how he shot and, with Allen, edited the material. But Bonnie & Clyde is prima facie evidence against the idiotic American concept of all-movies-belong-solely-to-directors auteurism. Everyone contributed to the success of B & C, not only at the box office (when Beatty pressured Jack Warner to re-release it after a disappointing early run and it caught on the second time around) but in fashion, the honing of opinion among younger critics, the depiction of screen violence and the opening up of what was permitted generally in the most influential of the popular arts.\n\nSee also: Two for the Road Frederic Raphael (1967) Stanley Donen also got credit for the shattered temporal structure of this alternatively dark and charming romantic comedy, but the script was written that way from its inception. Raphael makes this abundantly clear in his introduction, and refutes with evidence the notion that Donen was in any way the progenitor of what, apart from the lovely starring performances by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney (and the nifty Henry Mancini score) made the picture so memorable. Herein lies a lesson for every TV-commercial wizard who slaps a possessive credit on his first, usually rotten, movie.\n\n61. Casablanca: Script and Legend Howard Koch (and Julius & Philip Epstein) 1973 (Expanded edition, 1995) Although Koch was one of three credited scenarists on Casablanca, it was he who wrapped the published screenplay within his own reminiscence of its complex creation, filming, initial success and enduring popular repute. (Three years earlier he had done a similar job on The Panic Broadcast, a book reprinting his script, heavily doctored and improved by Orson Welles, for the phenomenal 1938 “War of the Worlds” broadcast, a publishing event about which Welles was none too happy.) The most important aspect of the Casablanca book, of course, is the Casablanca script, which despite its romantic excesses — courtesy of the un-credited Casey Robinson — remains one of the wittiest and most quotable screenplays ever written for an American classic.\n\nSee also: Casablanca: The 50th Anniversary Edition (1992) The Koch and Epstein screenplay sans Koch’s memoir.\n\n62. The Citizen Kane Book Orson Welles and Herman L. Mankiewicz; Pauline Kael (1971)\n\nFew essays on the popular arts were more widely read, and fewer created more unnecessary controversy, than Pauline Kael’s “Rising Kane” in The New Yorker, which she later made the centerpiece of her book publishing the original screenplay by Orson Welles and Herman J, Mankiewicz along with the cutting continuity of what was then being routinely called “the greatest movie ever made.” It’s a typically witty, informative Kael essay but filled with inaccuracies, particularly about Welles’s contributions to the script. (Among her sources was John Houseman, Welles’ one-time producer and later deadly enemy, who must have relished the opportunity to deny Welles writing credit for his most well-regarded picture.) Kael’s essay was so persuasive it even fooled the redoubtable Kenneth Tynan, up to then a lifetime Welles acolyte. What was curious about “The Kane Mutiny,” as Peter Bogdanovich wittily dubbed it in Esquire, is that Kael was also a strong public admirer of Welles’ work as a filmmaker, particularly at a time when most of the press was ignoring him entirely. It must have galled him that the screenplay he and Mankiewicz wrote was forever wedded to an essay hot to prove he didn’t deserve much credit for the writing. Kael’s piece is still worth reading, provided you know how to refute it, and that screenplay still well worth studying, in whatever format. The advantage of having the shooting script yoked to the continuity is that this allows you to confirm at a glance which lines and sequences were dropped, or altered by Welles and his Mercury Theatre actors, during the filming.\n\n63. Greed: A Film by Erich von Stroheim (1979)\n\nOne of the great, mutilated masterworks, Greed was famously (or infamously) chopped down by MGM to 140 minutes from an 8-hour first cut by its writer/director, the genuinely visionary Erich von Stroheim. That Stroheim was extravagant is an understatement, but he was not foolish enough to believe a major Hollywood movie studio would release a picture of that length, although he (like Robert Altman later with his unrealized movie of E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime and Claude Lanzmann with his overrated and exhausting 9-hour Shoah) wanted a two-part movie audiences would have to see in separate screenings. A 1999 Turner Entertainment “reconstruction,” which runs 239 minutes is, like the 1984 A Star is Born restoration, filled out with stills and is based on Herbert G. Weinberg’s coffee table book The Complete Greed, now quite rare. The Lorimer text, cited here, is a less profligately illustrated but more affordable means of judging what Stroheim had in mind. At least you should have an easier time getting your hands on a copy than you will finding the Turner Greed, for which, startlingly, there has never been a DVD release.\n\n64. JFK: The Book of the Film – The Documented Screenplay Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar (1992)\n\nPrior to JFK, Stone was a media darling for the 1986 Platoon in spite of the fact that nearly all American newspapers and magazines pushed the Vietnam war until it became fashionable to condemn it, and the 1987 Wall Street, because everyone but a fiscal vulture can feel virtuous critiquing rapacious capitalism. Born on the Fourth of July didn’t hurt his media reputation either. But challenging the Warren Report? How very dare he? An early draft of the screenplay was leaked to the press while the picture was shooting, and the battle was on. Despite the nearly constant barrage of negative press, broadside reviews and colloquies by the usual talking heads condemning Stone, and his film, the picture took off into the stratosphere to such a degree that Congress passed The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 as a result. (Not that this has led to much of anything.) As a result of the false, hysterical claims against JFK, when they came to publish their screenplay Stone and his collaborator Zachary Sklar prepared a fully annotated edition which refuted many of the lies and much of the mythology the CIA-infiltrated American media still pushes on an increasingly credulous population concerning the very public murder of an American president.\n\n65. The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction Orson Welles; Robert L. Carringer, ed. (1993)\n\nWhenever I consider the violence done to what on the evidence was almost certainly Orson Welles’ masterpiece as a writer/director, I get physically ill. Not only because what still exists of Ambersons is so brilliant, or even because its mutilation savaged Agnes Moorehead’s still-astonishing performance, but because of the damage it did to its maker. “They destroyed it,” he once said, “and it destroyed me.” “They” is of course RKO, which used Welles’ being in South America at government request as an excuse to first disfigure his movie by removing more than 40 minutes from it and, later, after he’d been ousted from the studio, to obliterate the negative and even the preview print, leaving us an hour and 20 minutes of tattered glory beyond the means of rescue. Carringer’s book reconstructs the picture in verbal and visual terms (by the use of production stills) so that we can at least read what Welles intended. Much of the cut material appeared in script and still form in the earlier book This is Orson Welles but Carringer’s volume puts the whole thing together.\n\n66. More About All About Eve Joseph L. Mankiewicz; Gary Carey (1972)\n\nAll About Eve is (or used to be) everyone’s favorite theatre fable, one of the wittiest and most quotable of American movies. Joseph Mankiewicz’s exceptionally literate screenplay was a natural for publication, and Random House brought out an edition of it in 1950. Two decades later Bantam reprinted it, supplemented by a long interview with Mankiewicz by Gary Carey. The script still shimmers, but Mankiewicz revised his interview responses to such a degree he removed all the air from his remarks, replacing spontaneity with fussy ponderousness. It’s a tendency he also had as screenwriter, cluttering things up with verbiage, and the reason I suspect he did not direct an original movie of his own after 1967; he had become what Orson Welles once called “a loquacious bore.”\n\n67. The Ninth Configuration William Peter Blatty with Mark Kermode commentary (1999)\n\nAnother witty and endlessly quotable masterpiece, although far less well known than All About Eve. Blatty’s alternately hilarious and harrowing adaptation and revision of his novel Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane is a nonpareil, filled with verbal slapstick and marvelous oddballs in its cast of characters. For the published screenplay, Mark Kermode leads the author on a journey through the picture, their commentary appearing alongside the text. Even if Blatty ends the picture by handing us yet another facile “proof” of life-after-death, the ride is so uniquely entertaining we can even forgive him for the sermon.\n\nSee also: William Peter Blatty on The Exorcist: From Novel to Screen (1974) Blatty was nothing if not sincere about his somewhat trying missionary zeal, and in this Bantam paperback he explicates that mission, along with the shooting script for his most popular movie. “William Friedkin’s The Exorcist,” my ass.\n\n68. Nixon Oliver Stone and Stephen J. Rivele & Christopher Wilkinson (1995)\n\nHaving been burned by the corporate media on JFK, Oliver Stone was taking no chances with Nixon. He and his co-scenarists thoroughly annotated their published screenplay, including transcripts from the White House tapes and essays by some of the participants. The script, lavishly illustrated with stills from the picture, would be satisfying enough; the added weight of the documentary evidence makes the book a necessary volume in the expanding Nixon/Watergate libraries. I can never quite decide which Stone picture is my favorite, although I vacillate between JFK and Nixon, as I do between City Lights and Modern Times for Chaplin… and this is probably the first time the names of those two filmmakers have ever been yoked together.\n\n69. Screenplays Volume II, The (The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky): The Hospital, Network, Altered States Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\nApplause Books issued three Chayefsky collections in 2000: One for his stage plays and two for his screenplays. The second volume of movie scripts contained his best and most representative work, including the two on which his modern reputation rests. Although The Hospital is still a wonderful movie, I think a new Chayefsky may be required to, as Paddy did with the state of the medical monolith ca. 1970, satirize the way insurance and Big Pharma manipulate, rule over and generally destroy the lives and health not only of Americans but of nearly everyone on the planet. But while the contours of the news business have changed since 1976, Network retains its sting. Chayefsky was so prescient about televised news he was nearly an oracle; nearly everything he “predicted” in Network has come true in the decades since what MGM, hedging its bets, marketed as “a perfectly outrageous motion picture” was unleashed to the theaters.\n\nSee also: The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky: The Screenplays (Volume 1): Marty, The Goddess, The Americanization of Emily Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\n70. Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, The Return of the Jedi) Laurent Bouzereau (Screenplays by George Lucas, Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan) 1997\n\nOnly a fool or an overstimulated fanboy would refer to the screenplays of the original Star Wars trilogy as great literature, or even great pop literature. But if you’re fond of the movies made from them, they’re great fun to read, and the annotations provided in this nifty volume are fascinating. As a maker of exceptionally thorough behind-the-scenes documentaries Bouzereau’s name has been nearly ubiquitous on DVDs and Blu-rays of many popular movies. He applies the same rigor and besotted intelligence here.\n\n71. Hud, Norma Rae and The Long, Hot Summer: Three Screenplays by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. Edited and with an Introduction by Michael Frank (1988)\n\nBeginning with the Faulkner-inspired The Long, Hot Summer, Ravetch and Frank embarked on a career-long collaboration with the director Martin Ritt, resulting in eight pictures including the remarkably intelligent Paul Newman Western Hombre and Conrack, their adaptation of Pat Conroy’s despairing memoir of teaching shockingly impoverished Gullah children in South Carolina. Hud, of course, was one of Newman’s most identifiable roles (and the first Larry McMurtry novel adapted for the screen) while Norma Rae, based on the life and union activism of the late Crystal Lee Sutton, showed the moviegoing world that Sally Field was a major talent with a range far beyond what her earlier work (excepting the television “Sybil”) had led anyone to expect from her. The Norma Rae screenplay is perhaps the Ravetches’ most representative, filled with compassion, intelligence, humor, what used to be called “social consciousness” but which while passionate does not hector the viewer, and an impeccable sense of the dramatic. Who, having seen the picture, can forget the image of Norma Rae Webster standing defiantly atop the factory table with a hastily scrawled “Union” placard in her hands? And as a writer I treasure this exchange by the screenwriters between Norma and the textiles union organizer Reuben Warshawsky, portrayed by the wonderful Ron Liebman:\n\nReuben: You’re the fish I wanted to hook.\n\nNorma: Well, you got me. So what the hell are you gonna do with me?\n\nReuben: Make a mensch outta you, kid.\n\nNorma: You are?\n\nReuben: Mm-hm.\n\nNorma: (After a pause) What is that?\n\nReuben: Somebody who goes to the old folks’ home on Saturday morning instead of playing golf. Somebody who puts a dollar in a blind man’s cup for a pencil.\n\nNorma: I’d do that.\n\nReuben: Uh-huh. But would you take the pencil?\n\nNorma: Of course. I paid for it.\n\nReuben: Somewhere between logic and charity, there falls a shadow.\n\nThat, not boilerplate Democrat pieties dressed up in “dazzling” verbiage by self-righteous liberal dramatists, is what great screenwriting is all about.\n\nSee also: Three Screenplays by Horton Foote: To Kill a Mockingbird, Tender Mercies and The Trip to Bountiful (1994) Harper Lee remarked of Foote’s beautiful adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird that he had “distilled the essence” of her novel. This is the most that can be expected of a writer transliterating the nearly perfect work of another, and the best that can ever be hoped. Foote was also, of course, a considerable playwright and screenwriter, and this collection brings together, along with Mockingbird, two of his own finest screenplays. And (not that this automatically confers honor upon them) all three of these scripts won Foote Academy Awards.\n\n72. To Have and Have Not Jules Furthman & William Faulkner (1987)\n\nAs an adolescent I fell in love with the dialogue (and Bogart’s and Bacall’s performances) in this most entertaining of war-time escapist pictures long before I ever saw the movie, listening late at night in my bed to a local radio station’s airing of the 1946 “Lux Radio Theatre” broadcast, with an earplug (singular; this was the mid-’70s) but without, alas, Walter Brennan. Even though some of the repartee between Harry “Steve” Morgan and “Slim” Marie (“You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve…?”) that so delighted me at 13 or 14 I later discovered was written by Howard Hawks, the picture’s director, the rest of what I was hearing was sharper and more intelligent than the 1940s norm. And although I have always loved Casablanca, I don’t love it as I do To Have and Have Not. There’s almost no fealty in it to the bitter, downbeat Hemingway novel, but that was the point; Hawks wanted to show how Marie and Harry might have met. The University of Wisconsin edition of the screenplay includes a splendid long introduction by the editor, Bruce F. Kawin, that delves deeply into the development of the script: The first pass was by the gifted but unpleasant Furthman, the second by Faulkner, and the polish by Hawks who, as so often his pictures, could have taken a screenwriting credit and didn’t. The running gag of Brennan’s Eddie asking everyone he meets if they “was ever bit by a dead bee” sounds like something Hawks might have devised, but it was Furthman who had the wit to come up with it.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nThe 400 Blows François Truffaut and Marcel Moussy (1969) The Grove Press edition, packed with photos.\n\nAbraham Polonksy’s Force of Evil: The Critical Edition Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert (1996)\n\nAmerican Graffiti George Lucas and Gloria Katz & William Hyuck (1975) Another terrific Grove Press edition, later reprinted by Ballantine Books.\n\nThe Apartment and The Fortune Cookie: Two Screenplays Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond (1971) One of Wilder and Diamond’s masterpieces, coupled with an amusing but much less effective script.\n\nApocalypse Now Redux John Milius and Francis Coppola (2000)\n\nAvalon, Tin Men, Diner: Three Screenplays Barry Levinson (1990) Two of the most original pictures of the 1980s plus an overlong, sentimental movie memoir.\n\nBaby Doll Tennessee Williams (1956) Williams’ notorious comedy of sex in the South, loudly condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency and defiantly portrayed on a Times Square billboard a block long.\n\nBrokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana; Annie Proulx (2005) The original Proulx story and the beautiful film script adapted from it.\n\nCharade: The Classic Movie Screenplay Peter Stone (2015)\n\nChimes at Midnight Orson Welles (1988) A typically fulsome Rutgers Press edition with incisive accompanying essays and frame blow-ups.\n\nChinatown and The Last Detail: Screenplays Robert Towne (and the un-credited Edward Taylor) (1998)\n\nDo the Right Thing Spike Lee (1988)\n\nDouble Indemnity Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler (2000)\n\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: From Concept to Classic, The Illustrated Story of the Film and the Filmmakers (Screenplay by Melissa Mathison) (2002)\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back Notebook (Script by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett) (1980)\n\nA Face in the Crowd Budd Schulberg (1957)\n\nFive Screenplays: All the President’s Men, Magic, Harper, Maverick, The Great Waldo Pepper William Goldman (1997)\n\nFive Screenplays: The Great McGinty, Christmas in July, The Lady Eve, Sullivan’s Travels, Hail the Conquering Hero Preston Sturges (1986)\n\nFour More Screenplays: The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek, Unfaithfully Yours, Triumph Over Pain/The Great Moment Preston Sturges (1995)\n\nFour Screenplays: Marathon Man, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride, Misery William Goldman (1997)\n\nThe History Boys: The Film Alan Bennett (2006) It’s instructive to compare Bennett’s playscript with his screenplay, which I regard as both a splendid adaptation of a wonderful play, and an improvement on it. The moving final lines from Posner (Samuel Barnett) are a prime example of how Bennett deepened his own work for the screen.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley: The Screenplay for the John Ford Directed Film (Limited Edition) Philip Dunne (1990)\n\nI Never Sang for My Father Robert Anderson (1970)\n\nIrma LaDouce Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond (1963) Midwood Tower was known for its erotica. Irma was about a prostitute. I guess that’s why they published this script, a slim volume teeming with terrific photos.\n\nThe Lion in Winter James Goldman (1969) Another splendid play improved on its way to the screen.\n\nThe Lost Weekend Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett (2000)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon John Huston; William Luhr, ed.

It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nIII. Criticism\n\nOf (obvious) deep concern to the present writer, good movie criticism has never been exactly plentiful, although criticism generally has certainly been a hell of a lot healthier than it is today. On the other hand, so has everything else. Alas, in a land where either editors no longer know the rudiments of their jobs or writers for print and online publication simply do as they please without the nagging interference of the men and women who used routinely to turn poor writing into the acceptable and the good into the great, we can expect little better than what we get. (I’d love an editor to give my work the once-over before I post it — probably the fond wish of some of you as well — but since I get paid nothing for this and thus cannot afford to hire one…)\n\nGore Vidal famously noted that there can be no great writers without great readers, and not only was he correct but his aphorism has a corollary applicable to film criticism: There can be no great movie critics without great movies, and great movie audiences. It’s no accident, then, that most of the best-written movie criticism in America was of another era or focuses on the movies of the past.\n\n21. Agee on Film Volume 1: Essays and Reviews by James Agee (1958) (Library of America edition [#160]: James Agee: Film Writing and Selected Journalism: Agee on Film / Uncollected Film Writing / The Night of the Hunter / Journalism and Film Reviews, 2005)\n\nWhenever I want to remind myself what a great writer can do with material scarcely worthy of his notice (and to feel correspondingly wretched about my own, comparatively anemic, abilities) I re-read Agee’s reviews, written mostly for Time and The Nation. While he seldom got near a movie good enough to merit his attention, it’s safe to say that many if not most of the pictures he routinely critiqued during this period — roughly 1942 to 1948 — often in omnibus groupings, would be entirely forgotten except for his memorable reviews of them: His response to one standard B-musical olio (“Vaudeville is dead; I wish to God someone would bury it.”) inters any number of equally silly wastes of time. Yet however biting Agee’s wit could be, his open-heartedness is never far from the surface. I’m not sure what would possess a man, even the world’s most devoted Charlie Chaplin fan, to take three long columns to review Monsieur Verdoux, and then to complain that a three-part critique is not long enough to address it fully. But one would rather Agee’s very occasional folly than the sanest work of almost anyone else of the period. No writer of his generation had as much love for, and knowledge about, silent comedy than Agee, and his 1949 Life magazine essay “Comedy’s Greatest Era” is arguably the best overview of the pictures Agee loved as a boy and which were still fueling his ardor for movies 30 and more years later.\n\nIf you really want to feel like an inarticulate boob, read Dwight McDonald’s piece on Agee in which he quotes letters from his then 16 year-old friend, who not only had a fully worked-out philosophical attitude toward movies, a subject beneath the contempt of most of his contemporaries, but astonishingly sophisticated ideas on how they could be made better and with greater artistic and psychological license. It may be that Agee, who so badly wanted to direct movies from a young age, would, had he lived to try his hand at it, have made an arty mess of things. Perhaps he wouldn’t have. Maybe he would have made something astonishing. The great catastrophe of his largely self-foreshortened life is that neither we nor he ever got to find out. But his reviews will live on as long as there are at least a few great readers around to cherish them.\n\nSee also: Dwight MacDonald on Movies (1969) Speaking of MacDonald, this collection of his occasional reviews of the late 1950s and early-to-mid 1960s is a useful one, even if his tastes diverged from much of the movie-going public of the time and aligned, somewhat alarmingly, all too closely to those of John Simon, who whatever his gifts as a theatre critic, and his adoration of Ingmar Bergman, could nearly always be counted upon to get any English or American picture wrong. Anyone can commit a critical error now and then; for men this erudite to get so many now classic pictures (The Apartment, Psycho, One Two Three, Hud, Tom Jones) wrong is dismaying. MacDonald also, like Simon, got schoolmarmishly huffy about the 1962 Cape Fear. He should only have lived to see what Scorsese did with it.\n\n22. A Biographical Dictionary of Film David Thomson (1975; Revised and expanded numerous times)\n\nThomson is a troublesome writer: Part critic-part biographer, a sometimes-lazy researcher and a sort of celebrity voyeur, speculating on the private lives of personalities in a way that most of us indulge in privately but which becomes unseemly and even creepy when aired in print. He’s also an unrepentant auteurist; nowhere in the several revisions of his 1975 Biographical Dictionary will you see a single entry on a screenwriter unless he happens to be a director. (“Over 800 directors, actors, actresses, producers” reads the cover blurb.) Yet he’s fascinating to read, his opinions alternatively outrageous and insightful. In no other book, I think, will you read an entry on W.C. Fields written, appropriately, in the voice of Charles Dickens — appropriate not only for Fields’ own Dickensian character names and florid, circumlocuted Victorian dialogue (as well as his having starred as Micawber in the 1935 David Copperfield) but to his dying on Dickens’ special provenance: Christmas day.\n\n23. Canned Goods as Caviar: American Film Comedies of the 1930s Gerald Weales (1985)\n\nWeales illuminates the movie decade year by year, with a single picture presenting each, from City Lights in 1931 to Destry Rides Again in 1939 and taking in as well the Marx Bros., Mae West, W.C. Fields, Ben Hecht, William Wellman, Leo McCarey, John Ford, Morrie Ryskind, Gregory La Cava, Frank Capra, Robert Riskind and Howard Hawks. Although as another reader noted a better title might have been Caviar as Canned Goods, Weales’ is an eloquent analysis of the greatest decade for American comedy after the merging of picture and sound — a period in which a general literacy prevailed that is now unimaginable, and which permitted genuinely witty (as opposed to wise-ass) dialogue to be heard in the nation’s motion picture theaters on a regular basis. (We can obviously except Chaplin from that generalization.) My only cavil is that Weales has a tendency to over-emphasize directors when surely the writers of these pictures were often of at least equal if not greater importance.\n\nSee also: We’re in the Money: Depression America and Its Films Andrew Bergman (1971) Before becoming a published mystery novelist (the Jack LeVine series) and screenwriter (Tex X, which became Blazing Saddles; the original The In-Laws; The Freshman) Bergman was a doctoral student. This, his PhD thesis, is a bracing overview of early 1930s American movies, intelligent, knowledgeable and erudite. Bergman is especially good on the Warner “social problem” pictures and their frequent, now forgotten, star, the remarkable Richard Barthelmess.\n\n24. The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies Vito Russo (1981; Updated, 1987)\n\nWhen I discovered Russo’s book in 1981, it was with the force of revelation. For an avid movie lover and a young gay man of 20, The Celluloid Closet almost seemed to be the book I’d waited my adolescence for without knowing it. Parker Tyler’s 1972 Screening the Sexes: Homosexuality in the Movies got to the subject first, but I don’t know anyone who has ever been able to get through it, including me. Russo didn’t tag absolutely every gay (or implied) character who ever appeared in a movie, nor did he try to. But his scholarship is impeccable, and he airs his critiques with intelligence, enthusiasm and wit. The author had no idea (nor did the rest of us) that something eventually called AIDS was about to alter the existence of every gay man on the planet, a vulnerability that, rather surprisingly, did more to advance the cause of gay civil rights than Stonewall or Anita Bryant, and included greater — though not necessarily more positive — visibility in popular culture. Harlan Ellison was fond of quoting Pasteur’s dictum that “Chance favors the prepared mind.” Russo’s was one of the most prepared of his generation.\n\nSee also: Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969 William J. Mann (2001) and Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall Richard Barrios (2002) Two entertaining surveys, the first of gay and bisexual Hollywood figures, the second of movies with overt or coded homosexual characters which is, perhaps surprisingly, not merely a Celluloid Closet re-tread.\n\n25. Warning Shadows: Home Alone with Classic Cinema Gary Giddins (2010)\n\nGiddins, arguably the finest critic and historian of American jazz, latterly turned his attentions to movies. This collection of pieces from The Sun, wedded to the DVD releases of a wide range of pictures both domestic and foreign, exhibits his customary taste, intelligence and wit, and one wishes Giddins would compile a compendium of capsule reviews which might, with Pauline Kael’s 5001 Nights at the Movies, more or less obliterate the need for Leonard Maltin’s middlebrow movie guides. (But then I’ve been wishing for decades that David Denby would put together a collection of his movie reviews and that’s never happened.)\n\nSee also: Natural Selection: Gary Giddins on Comedy, Film, Music and Books (2006)\n\n26. On the Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties Brandon French (1978)\n\nOne of the most graceful, beautifully written books of its kind, a knowing survey of ten movies from a transitional decade’s screen representation of women, from Sunset Boulevard (1950) to Some Like it Hot (1959). Far from a doctrinaire broadside, French’s exceptionally trenchant study benefits not only from its author’s thoughtful analyses but from her limpid prose, which reminds the reader of why, whatever its flaws or virtues (and its perhaps suspicious origins) the so-called second wave of feminism had to occur. Each time I return to its pages I find this book more lucid, and more charming, than I’ve remembered from my previous readings.\n\nSee also: The Runaway Bride: Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930s Elizabeth Kendall (1990) Kendall’s auteurist approach is unique: She pairs several important actresses (Stanwyck, Colbert, Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Jean Arthur, Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne) with the directors (Capra, Sturges, George Stevens, Gregory La Cava, Leo McCarey) of their great romantic/screwball comedies. Despite my aversion to the Auteur Theory as popularized by the idiotic Andrew Sarris, Kendall’s is a delightful study.\n\n27. Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream Marjorie Rosen (1974)\n\nMolly Haskell’s sour, fag-baiting feminist broadside From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies got far more ink and sold many more copies — she knew what she was doing putting “rape” in her title — but Rosen’s is the finer achievement, elegant and witty. (And, unlike Haskell, Rosen doesn’t confuse an actress’s screen persona with the performer herself.) A bright, perceptive cultural critic, Rosen charts the development of women in American movies from the Victorianism of the ‘teens through the emergence in the 1920s of the independent “flapper” and the ’30s and ’40s working girl all the way to the Second Wave revolution of the early 1970s: From “Little Mary” Pickford to Jane Fonda in Klute.\n\n28. Reeling Pauline Kael (1977)\n\nReaders of these pages will know how highly I esteem Kael’s criticism, and had the 1970s never happened she still would have been an important and influential writer on the movies. But as great writers need great readers, they also need great subjects, and the era of adult, personal American filmmaking that ran from roughly 1967 to 1982 was Kael’s great subject. When the phenomenal receipts for the Star Wars series rang down the curtain on popular movies for mature adults Kael was as marooned as the writers, actors and directors she championed and about whose best work she wrote more urgently and enticingly than anyone else. John Simon, in his review of Reeling, sneered at Kael for asserting that “we [were] living though a classic period for movies,” but she was entirely correct, among the first to sense that something extraordinary, and exceptional, was going on, and that even those pictures about which she was less enthusiastic were a part of that.* I’m just slightly too young (a happy phrase I don’t get many opportunities to use) to have seen many when they were new, or to have read Kael’s critiques of them then, but I can well imagine the keenness with which avid moviegoers of the time, many of them of the so-called “Film Generation,” must have anticipated reading what Kael had to say about the newest release. Even her detractors —Renata Adler perhaps excepted — must admit that having such a lightning-rod of a movie critic at the center of popular discourse was a healthy thing, especially now that most critics function as little but public relations flacks for the dwindling pack of major studios, all of which will disappear up Disney’s asshole ere long.\n\nSee also: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (1968), Going Steady (1970), Deeper Into Movies (1973) and When the Lights Go Down: Film Writings 1975 – 1980 (1980) Taken together with Reeling, these titles constitute a vest-pocket history of the last great period of American movies, and the last we are ever likely to get: Our best movie critic on our best decade and a half of popular entertainment.\n\n5001 Nights at the Movies (1982 / Updated, 1991) During the 1950s Kael contributed capsule reviews for the Berkeley revival house she managed, later publishing a clutch of them as “The Movie Past” in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. These eventually resurfaced in the movie listings of The New Yorker before Kael collected them, along with excerpts from many of her New Yorker reviews, into this compulsively readable compendium. Once you start poring over it, you may come to and realize you’ve been reading for hours.\n\nFollowing Kael’s death in 2001, the New Yorker began busily scrubbing these brief reviews of classic movies from its pages, replacing them with the mind-numbingly pretentious yawping of one Richard Brody. It almost seemed the magazine wished to erase any trace of Kael’s connection to it… and considering how many readers she brought to what (Seymour Hirsch’s reporting to one side) had become a moribund and largely irrelevant publication, that’s a real slap in the face. Even more puzzling, Brody’s stultifying academism is precisely the sort of cloistered, dead prose and mode of thought Kael’s jazzy approach was in opposition to. Exactly what message is the New Yorker sending?\n\n29. Toms Coons Mulattoes Mammies and Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Film Donald Bogle (1973; revised and expanded numerous times)\n\nLike The Celluloid Closet years later, Bogle’s was a book whose timeliness, encyclopedic breadth and critical acumen were sorely needed. His analyses are sharp and genuinely witty (especially in the photo captions), evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the actors and personalities available to black audiences on their theater screens — always assuming they could see them, since in the South black performers, especially those in musicals, were often cut from the movies in which they appeared. Bogle is particularly perceptive on the acting limitations of a number of sacred cows as well as of those pictures whose good social intentions were overwhelmed by their earnestness and general mediocrity. The last edition of Toms etc. I read was the revision of 1994, in part because I got the feeling that the first book did not need updating or expansion; it was a product of its time, and brought needed discussion to a too-long neglected topic. But did the original criteria on which Bogle based his study still obtain in the 1990s, and beyond? I wish that, instead of grafting new material onto a splendid old book, its gifted author would create a new, perhaps encyclopedic, title specifically designed to explicate what has happened since 1973.\n\nSee also: The Devil Finds Work (James Baldwin) 1976 Baldwin’s book-length essay on race, politics and film is also a memoir of one Negro boy’s experience of American movies not made with him — or any black audience — in mind.\n\nIV. Filmmakers\n\nAs an unrepentant anti-auteurist, I tend to favor the work of writer-directors — or at least, those filmmakers (Ford, Cukor, Hitchcock, Hawks, Lumet, George Roy Hill, Peter Bogdanovich) who not only worked closely with their scenarists but had they so chosen could have taken a screenwriting credit on most of the movies they directed. Robert Altman, who could be a writer fucker, I except from this personal rule because, whoever wrote it, an Altman movie was an Altman movie. He was both a genuine innovator and a poet, and how many of these have there been in American movies?\n\n30. Billy Wilder in Hollywood Maurice Zolotow (1977; Updated in 1987)\n\nI feel quite sure Zolotow’s is by no means the finest book written about my favorite writer-director. However, because of a writing project I began long ago and have not been able to finish, I have deliberately not read any of the subsequent books published about him and his movies in the years since. Zolotow’s was the first biography of Wilder and while he was either a bit gullible, unwilling to challenge his subject’s self-devised mythology (and the myths devised by others) or unable to do the research necessary to debunk them — and also had a dismaying inability to retell an anecdote without somehow mucking up the punchline — his book is a great deal of fun and had the advantage of being authorized, so Wilder’s distinctive voice prevails throughout.\n\n31. Buster Keaton: Tempest in a Flat Hat Edward McPherson (2007)\n\nFollowing my introduction to silent comedy as a nine-year-old, via a children’s matinee of the Robert Youngson compilation 30 Years of Fun and (thanks to a New Year’s Eve PBS marathon of his Mutual comedies) I became an instant Charles Chaplin fan. Buster Keaton’s great shorts and features were tougher to see in those years, but the more of them I encountered the higher he rose in my estimation. Now, I happen to think that comparing these two short-statured giants is a waste of time, especially since the Keaton camp tends to look down its nose at Charlie for his sentimentality and I have no interest in starting an argument. But I must admit that as time has gone by I find Keaton, while ingenious and physically astonishing, a more limited performer and his movies, taken as a whole, surprisingly and at times almost depressingly gruesome. That doesn’t mean Keaton’s pictures are not funny; indeed, his 1924 The Navigator is the second-funniest movie I’ve ever seen (the first is Richard Pryor: Live in Concert) while The General (1927) manages to be beautiful, dramatic and hilarious and watching his two-reelers in order, as I did last year, is an exercise in genuine dazzlement. His life, unfortunately, was as disordered as his best work was controlled; in addition to being an alcoholic he seems to have been both hapless and alarmingly passive. He got a superb biographer in Edward McPherson, whose wonderfully titled volume was one of the most pleasant surprises of the early ‘aughts.\n\nSee also: Keaton: The Man Who Wouldn’t Lie Down Tom Dardis (1979) A good early biography detailing Buster’s travails and his achievements.\n\n32. Chaplin: His Life and Art David Robinson (1985)\n\nI wish I could adequately convey the excitement I experienced when this book was published in America, or the complete spell it wove over me as I read it over several completely satisfying weeks. The breadth of its author’s knowledge, and the extent of his research, were impeccable as he set about gently deflating the mythology that had accrued to Charles Spencer Chaplin, some of it generated by Charlie himself. Robinson’s was the first book of which I am aware to detail the painstaking manner in which Chaplin worked out his great comedies. (Much of this was also explicated in Kevin Brownlow and David Gill’s three-part 1983 documentary Unknown Chaplin.) He is also correct on the impact of Charlie’s pretentious, self-serving memoir My Autobiography (1964) and the hurt it generated among the many long-time Chaplin associates whom he slighted in it. Robinson’s remains the Chaplin book of Chaplin books.\n\nSee also: Chaplin: The Mirror of Opinion David Robinson (1984) The year before his biography of Chaplin was completed, Robinson published this fascinating volume which details what was written and said about Charlie during the various important periods of his life. It’s almost a Concordance to the biography, but fully able to stand on its own.\n\n33. Chasing the Light: Writing, Directing, [sic] and Surviving Platoon, Midnight Express, Scarface, Salvador, [sic] and the Movie Game Oliver Stone (2020)\n\nI don’t know how the proliferation of unnecessary commas before the conjunction “and” took hold, or why it affects even seasoned writers. That small cavil aside, this is the book Stone’s admirers have been waiting for, detailing his childhood and youth, his Viet Nam experience and the frustrating road he traversed from struggling screenwriter to Academy-honored writer and director. Stone spares no one, least of all himself, and as is so often the case with the most interesting movies what a friend and I used to call “the backstage stuff” is almost as interesting as the pictures themselves (and occasionally more so.) Stone’s prose is both graceful and unflinching, and his book a deep pleasure to read. Chasing the Light takes the reader up to the triumph of Platoon, so we can only hope that Stone will bring out a second volume on the years of his greatest daring and achievement.\n\n34. David Lean: A Biography Kevin Brownlow (1996)\n\nBrownlow’s biography honors Lean but also sees him plain, his follies as notable as his masterworks and his personal style that of a cold, shy autocrat with flashes of great decency. The author had enviable access to Lean, so we hear his voice throughout; Brownlow also interviewed as many of Lean’s old associates as he could, resulting in descriptions of the making of his movies that are remarkably thorough. Appropriately, he devotes three long chapters to Lawrence of Arabia, Lean’s magnum opus and, despite its somewhat muddled politics, one of the great glories of world cinema. Brownlow, whose subject has been the silent movie, judges Lean not merely as a great editor but a director whose eye missed little. Anyone who has seen his adaptation of Great Expectations remembers with a shiver up the spine the opening sequence in which Pip encounters Magwitch. Equally likely to sear themselves in the mind are the climax of Oliver Twist; the exquisite views of Venice in Summertime; the scene at the well, the train wreck, the hallucinogenic ship, the attack on Aqaba and the desert itself in Lawrence; the long train journey, the ice palace and Omar Sharif’s trek across the desert of snow in Doctor Zhivago; Judy Davis’ encounter with the monkeys and the death of Peggy Ashcroft in A Passage to India; and the many indelible sequences in Bridge on the River Kwai. Lean was a born filmmaker, and as Brownlow makes clear, the movies gave him a life that saved him from the despair that so often attends the misfit of genius.\n\nSee also: David Lean Stephen Silverman (1992) A through, beautiful coffee-table volume limning Lean’s filmography.\n\nLawrence of Arabia: The 20th Anniversary Pictorial History L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin (1992) A well-written celebration of Lean’s finest picture, with glorious color photographs throughout.\n\n35. The Hustons Lawrence Grobel (1989; Revised and updated, 2014)\n\nA revealing group biography of one of Hollywood’s great dynasties, and a disturbing critique of its center, the gifted but deeply troubled, sadistic, misogynist John. Grobel also points out that the writer-director’s best features were those based on second and third-rank material (The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, The Night of the Iguana, The Kremlin Letter, The Man Who Would Be King, Prizzi’s Honor) and that it was only when he tackled the first-rate (The Red Badge of Courage, Moby-Dick, Wise Blood, Under the Volcano) that he floundered. (The single notable exception is Huston’s swansong, the beautifully observed The Dead, which somehow almost miraculously approximates in cinematic terms its universally well-regarded source.) Grobel chronicles the family from John’s actor father Walter to John’s children, the actress Angelica and his eventual actor/writer/director sons Tony and Danny. But it’s John who is the focal point of the book, and who, while endlessly fascinating, leaves the most unpleasant aftertaste.\n\n36. Making Movies Sidney Lumet (1996)\n\nAlthough there have been countless “how-to” books published on filmmaking, some dating back to the 1920s, Lumet’s is the only volume I know of in which an important movie director discusses the process at length, and covers every department. While the specific means by which Lumet achieved his considerable effects are, obviously, unique to him (few directors care to rehearse their actors as Lumet routinely did, for example) the anecdotes he offers as illustrations of each topic under discussion express a universality that I’m sure has resonated with filmmakers who’ve read his book. We were the poorer for the loss of this most humane filmmaker but Making Movies continues to shine with the same qualities that mark his work on film.\n\nSee also: Sidney Lumet: A Life Maura Spiegel (2019) A lovely first biography of Lumet, written with thoughtfulness and grace. Among other things, Spiegel had access to Lumet’s unfinished memoir, abandoned shortly after it was begun and in which the remembered pain of his childhood and youthful experience apparently overwhelmed their author. Spiegel also reveals that Lumet seldom looked back at his own work; his impatience to push forward was something Pauline Kael noted early on, when she observed the filming of The Group, and which she felt limited him as a director. Perhaps she might have been a bit more compassionate had she known about Sidney’s youthful traumas: His father, the Yiddish actor Baruch Lumet, exploited his young son as a child actor, his mother died when he was a boy and his sister was deeply troubled. No wonder he was always playing hurry-up.\n\n37. On Cukor Gavin Lambert (1972; Reprinted, 2000)\n\nIn the early 1970s Gavin Lambert, an excellent novelist, biographer and sometime screenwriter (with a special focus, in a time when it was definitely not the thing, on gay characters) conducted in-depth interviews with his friend George Cukor on the movies he’d directed. The result is a wonderful free-ranging discussion on some of the brightest and most entertaining pictures of the talkie era: Dinner at Eight, David Copperfield, Holiday, The Women, The Philadelphia Story, Adam’s Rib, Born Yesterday, The Marrying Kind, It Should Happen to You, the 1954 A Star is Born. Around the time of On Cukor Lambert also wrote GWTW, the first book-length account of the making of Gone with the Wind. It was a picture from which Cukor, its original director, had famously been fired, for reasons that remain murky but which may have been the result of Clark Gable’s discomfort with him. The 2000 edition of On Cukor was reimagined as a well-illustrated coffee-table book.\n\nSee also: A Double Life: George Cukor Patrick McGilligan (1992) The first biography of Cukor, by one of our best and most thorough writers on film.\n\n38. Mainly About Lindsay Anderson Gavin Lambert (2000)\n\nAlthough I had not seen any of Anderson’s pictures and only one video of a play he directed (David Storey’s Home) when I stumbled upon Lambert’s affectionate biography/memoir I found myself entranced by the book, its subject’s rigorous intelligence and its author’s reconstruction of his friendship with his one-time fellow cineaste co-founder and contributor to Sequence magazine.\n\nThe title is a nod to Anderson’s own influential study About John Ford.\n\nSee also: Inside Daisy Clover (1963), arguably the best novel ever written about Hollywood and Running Time (1982), the second-best.\n\n39. Orson Welles: A Biography Barbara Leaming (1985)\n\nLeaming, perhaps taking a leaf from Whitney Stein’s Bette Davis book Mother Goddam, wrote her fascinating authorized biography of Welles with Orson’s input. Due to his intimate involvement with it, and because he would die a few months after her book saw publication, Leaming’s biography became in a way a final portrait of the playwright, actor-manager, radio and theatre innovator and great, radical filmmaker whose work exerted a powerful influence over the medium of film. It was a harsh (and expensive) mistress, one that demanded of its devotee more time and attention than any other art form and which still reverberate, even among ignoramuses who’ve never seen a frame of Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Lady from Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight or F for Fake. In Welles’ case that meant taking on acting work in lesser pictures as a means of earning the funds to produce his own, and chasing after deals that were somehow never finalized. As a result, a great moviemaker left us with far fewer pictures than he intended. Leaming illuminates both Welles’ ardor and the decades-long frustrations which, along with his excessive weight, almost certainly led to his death at 70.\n\n40. Robert Altman: The Oral Biography Michael Zuckoff (2010)\n\nThe form Zuckoff employed for his Altman book is so perfect for its subject, one of the great innovators of motion picture soundtracks, and most of whose movies are essentially kaleidoscopic, I’m amazed no one came up with before. Inevitably with these things, there is occasionally a kind of Rashomon effect. There is also much agreement. The form seems to me eminently fair and gives a marvelous sense of perspective on the various movies Altman made, as well as on his personality.\n\nSee also: Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff Patrick McGilligan (1991) McGilligan has for decades been quietly amassing a stack of fine, non-sensational biographies of important figures in American movies. This is one of his best.\n\n41. Searching for John Ford Joseph McBride (2001)\n\nMcBride is, like Patrick McGilligan, one of our best and most reliable writers on movies and their makers, especially on Orson Welles. Here he gives serious consideration (838 pages) to Welles’ favorite filmmaker. The result is, I suspect — and barring a fuller discussion of his possible bisexuality, hinted at elsewhere — essentially the definitive Ford biography. I do not believe that any biographer can fully explicate his subject, any more than any human being ever completely knows himself, and Ford was more complicated than most. Yet if McBride cannot reach into the man’s psyche and examine the threads that made Ford Ford, he comes awfully damned close.\n\nSee also: About John Ford Lindsay Anderson (1983) A superb study of Ford and his pictures, written with a director’s eye and the perspective of a prickly critic for whom “not quite” is never good enough.\n\nJohn Ford Peter Bogdanovich (Revised and Enlarged Edition, 1978) Bogdanovich’s Ford monograph, expanded and with extensive interviews with the deliberately crotchety director.\n\n42. A Splurch in the Kisser: The Movies of Blake Edwards Sam Wasson (2009)\n\nReaders of these pages may know that I have a great deal of difficulty with Wasson. While I respect the authoritative scope of his knowledge and understanding I find his work sloppy and limited (Fosse) and sometimes shockingly ignorant, even about the subjects of his own books (The Big Goodbye). In the case of Wasson’s wonderfully-titled examination of Blake Edwards my irritation lies with his occasional mind-numbing academic flights, seeking as is common with what Gore Vidal once called “scholar-squirrels,” to root out symbols, with stultifying persistence. When Wasson is good, however, he is very fine indeed, and among other things I am grateful to him for leading me to Ellen Barkin’s marvelous performance in Switch, which I missed in 1991 and which I now treasure.\n\nSee also: Blake Edwards Peter Lehman and William Luhr (1981) and Returning to the Scene: Blake Edwards, Volume 2 Peter Lehman and William Luhr (1989) Speaking of scholar-squirrels, these two volumes are both useful and annoying, in the rather typical academic style. But for many years they were all we had, so that usefulness must be acknowledged.\n\nBlake Edwards Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series) Gabriella Oldham (2017) A bit repetitious — Edwards tended to tell the same anecdotes repeatedly — but full of goodies.\n\n43. A Third Face: My Tale of Writing, Fighting, and Filmmaking Samuel Fuller (2004)\n\nI don’t know whether, post-stroke, Fuller dictated this superb memoir or not, although it sounds like his speech. Frankly I don’t care if Fuller spoke it, typed it, wrote it longhand or whether it appeared, fully formed, like Venus from his forehead. A Third Face is one of the finest autobiographies any movie writer or director has ever written, and it may be the best of all such books. Fuller brings everything he was and did into focus: From impossibly young cub reporter to novelist to screenwriter to soldier to writer-director, and from the lively crime scene of the 1920s through the heartbreaking dismissal of good work in the ’80s. He seemed, even after his debilitating stroke, to have total recall about his life and work, and it’s his unique voice, cigar firmly in place, you hear as you read his wonderful book.\n\nMartin Scorsese famously observed that, “If you don’t like the films of Samuel Fuller, then you just don’t like cinema.” If we ignore the pretentious use of the words “films” and “cinema” (Fuller would have rolled his eyes at both) Scorsese’s observation is entirely correct. If you can look down your nose at the subway sequence at the beginning of Pickup on South Street, or the devastating scene in which Thelma Ritter’s professional stool pigeon is murdered, or the brutal fight between Richard Widmark and Richard Kiley; if you can watch the opening of The Naked Kiss without astonishment; if the transformation of Mark Hamill, on Omaha beach and at the ovens at Falkenau, and the mute child Lee Marvin attempts to bring back to the world of the living in The Big Red One leave you un-moved; if you can watch White Dog and come to the conclusion that the movie is an expression, not of outrage but of racism… you are lost not only to Fuller but to what makes moviemaking special.\n\n44. This is Orson Welles edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum; with Peter Bogdanovich & Orson Welles (1992)\n\nWelles’ great friend Marlene Dietrich once said of him, “When I have seen him, and talked with him, I feel like a plant that has just been watered.” I have the same reaction to this book; re-reading it, which I do every couple of years, opens my senses and, despite the sadness of Welles’ unrealized projects, leaves me in something close to a state of wonder. (The tapes Random House released of some of Welles’ and Bogdanovich’s conversations conversations do likewise for me, although I wish they had been issued on CD as well as cassette.) While these wide-ranging talks were edited by Welles, who sometimes reduced his own words from poetry to prose — for example when he says “under the shadowed elms” on Bogdanovich’s tape but revises it on paper to read, “the shadows of the elms” — and he even added an event that didn’t happen, for flourish, reading their transcripts is such a pleasure that niggling doubts or critiques drift away like grains of sand in a breeze. If the later My Lunches with Orson is to be accepted and Henry Jaglom did not invent any of Welles’ comments or obnoxious attitudes (like many men who are sexually suspect, OW expresses repeated appalling viciousness about gay men), Bogdanovich may have smoothed things out a bit. Welles is at pains not to make critical remarks about other filmmakers, although the few that slipped through are instructive, and apt. As much a mythologist about himself and his movies as Hitchcock at his worst, there is much here that should be taken with skepticism, especially if you don’t know the truth of these matters. Yet everything I said in praise of the book still obtains. And as if the conversations were not sufficient, Jonathan Rosenbaum contributes a career chronology that is surely definitive, and staggering: Once you know how much Welles did, year by year and nearly day-to-day, and how busy his gifts kept him, it forever destroys the boring old “He couldn’t finish anything” critique.\n\nSee also: Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles Frank Brady (1989) The first biography of Welles following his death in 1985, Brady’s is marked by its intelligence, thoroughness and compassion.\n\nIn My Father’s Shadow: A Daughter Remembers Orson Welles Christopher Welles Feder (2009) A thoughtful, beautifully rendered memoir of her father by Welles’ eldest daughter. (She’s in MacBeth, as the foully murdered young son of McDuff, and the scream she lets out off-screen is chilling.) Although Feder has no axes to grind her portrait of Welles illustrates how manipulative he could be with his children as much as with the adults around him — and how distracted, playing Daddy as if it is a role, and not one in which he had a great deal of interest. Feder is revealing as well about her half-sisters, particularly the Dread Beatrice, who has fucked up everything of her father’s she’s touched, up to and including his funeral. There must be enormous unacknowledged rage at work there.\n\nMaking Movies with Orson Welles Gary Graver with Andrew J. Rausch (2008) As much as anyone other than Welles’ companion and collaborator Oja Kodar it is Graver we owe for everything from F for Fake to the end of Welles’ life. By making himself, as a cinematographer, constantly available to Welles he enabled him to shoot off the cuff, and at considerable cost to Graver’s own career. (Although Welles gave him his writing Oscar for Citizen Kane during the filming of The Other Side of the Wind in lieu of payment.) There I is something touchingly foolish about that, and rather heroic. Graver’s is a lovely book about a period he clearly regarded as the most interesting of his working life.\n\n45. When the Shooting Stops… The Cutting Begins: A Film Editor’s Story Ralph Rosenblum and Robert Karen (1980)\n\nRosenblum’s book is one of the key titles of my pivotal six year post-high school/pre-college period as an autodidact, when I absorbed like an especially thirsty sponge everything I could get my hands on about theatre and movies. In it the veteran editor recalls the ways in which several important pictures on which he worked evolved through his collaboration with their directors during the post-production process. And while we have only the author’s word to support this, it would seem that few movies of the period were more significantly altered in the editing than the adaptations of Herb Gardner’s play A Thousand Clowns and Rowland Barber’s delightful novel The Night They Raided Minsky’s. The most heartbreaking chapter in the book is Rosenblum’s recollection of how with cold-blooded logic Monroe Arnold’s performance of an excoriating monologue in Goodbye, Columbus (and which he was promised would win him an Academy Award) was ruthlessly and gradually trimmed away until his role existed as little more than a walk-on.\n\n46. Who the Devil Made It Peter Bogdanovich (1997) As a young writer and occasional critic, Bogdanovich published several monographs and interview books on movie directors, finally collecting many of them in this entrancing volume. And no, the title does not require a question mark; it’s part of an observation made by Howard Hawks about film directors whose pictures interested him.\n\nSee also: Conversations with The Great Moviemakers of Hollywood’s Golden Age at the American Film Institute George Stevens, Jr. (2006) and Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers: The Next Generation, From the 1950s to Hollywood Today George Stevens, Jr. (2012) Two superb omnibus reprintings of the old “Dialogue on Film” segments from the late, lamented magazine American Film, in-depth and often revealing colloquies with movie and television actors, writers, directors, editors, cinematographers, designers, composers, critics and producers. Stevens, son of the director, was a co-founder of the American Film Institute, and its director during the first decade which, among other things, saw the creation of the Institute’s Life Achievement Award, once venerated and now, with the likes of George Clooney winning it, a very un-amusing joke. (Actually, the AFI self-dubbing its award “the highest honor in film” is itself hilarious. Sez who?) In any case, these two volumes fully capture the voices of, among others, Harold Lloyd, Raoul Walsh, King Vidor, Fritz Lang, Frank Capra, Ernest Lehman, Arthur Penn, Leonard Rosenman, Neil Simon, Howard Hawks, Robert Towne, Anne V. Coates, James Wong Howe, Roger Corman, William Wyler, Sidney Poitier, John Sayles, William Clothier, Steven Spielberg, David Lean, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Cortez, George Lucas, George Cukor, Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, John Huston, Peter Bogdanovich, Ray Bradbury, Fred Zinnemann, Gene Kelly, Richard Brooks, Hal Wallis, Jean Renoir, Robert Altman, Larry Gelbart, Alan Pakula and François Truffaut.\n\n47. Young Orson: The Years of Luck and Genius on the Path to Citizen Kane Patrick McGilligan (2015)\n\nI have over the years read so many books on Orson Welles — my shelves are fairly sagging with volumes by and about him — that I have begun to approach new titles with an inner groan. Will this one merely repeat the many lazily resold myths about Welles? Will it tell me anything I don’t already know? Thankfully, Young Orson wipes away nearly everything we think we know about Welles’ early years, his theatrical triumphs and follies, and most especially about the making of Kane. In 832 meticulously researched, exhaustively sourced and utterly compelling pages, Patrick McGilligan portrays George Orson Welles in all his glory, his contradictions, his achievements, his cruelties and his kindnesses.† McGilligan has written terrific books on Robert Altman, George Cukor, Fritz Lang, Jack Nicholson, Oscar Michaux and Alfred Hitchcock. Young Orson is his chef d’oeuvre. Many biographies are called definitive, and few ever are. This one almost certainly is.‡\n\n*Among them, just taking in the years from 1970 to 1973: M*A*S*H, The Angel Levine, Bartleby, The Liberation of L.B. Jones, The Owl and the Pussycat, I Never Sang for My Father, The Landlord, The Boys in the Band, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx, Something for Everyone, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The Traveling Executioner, Klute, Fiddler on the Roof, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Cold Turkey, A New Leaf, Bananas, They Might Be Giants, The French Connection, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Sunday Bloody Sunday, The Go-Between, Desperate Characters, The Skin Game, Born to Win, Harold and Maude, The Last Picture Show, The Hot Rock, Travels with My Aunt, What’s Up Doc?, The War Between Men and Women, Frenzy, The Candidate, The Ruling Class, Sleuth, Avanti!, Cabaret, The Godfather, Sounder, Across 110th Street, The Iceman Cometh, The Last Detail, Mean Streets, Oklahoma Crude, Serpico, A Delicate Balance, The Legend of Hell House, The Exorcist, The Last of Sheila, High Plains Drifter, Scorpio, Paper Moon, “Save the Tiger,” Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing, Slither, American Graffiti, Sleeper, The Three Musketeers, The Day of the Jackal, The Seven-Ups, The Sting. Kael would argue with me about the quality of some of those titles, just as I argue with her negative opinions of some of my favorites. But the fact that interesting, intelligent and largely adult movies were being released in this country on practically a weekly basis, for years, is something of a miracle… and one that will not be repeated.\n\n†The single aspect of Welles’ personality which remains underexplored is the one that is likely impossible to pin down, and may be forever elusive, although Joseph McBride has commented on it: His possible, even likely, bisexuality.\n\n‡There are in existence now three foul volumes of Welles biography by a pompous British character actor apparently bent on tearing the man’s reputation to shreds, and which are now routinely deemed “definitive.” Avoid them.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nI am in the process of re-evaluating the work of Oliver Stone, so herewith some brief thoughts about a few of his representative pictures, 1988 – 2016.\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1988) I missed this one when it was new, owing partly to my perpetual aversion to its star, but had I seen it in 1988 I suspect I would have appreciated it more. I had attempted, a few years before, to get through Ron Kovic’s memoir, but was defeated by its grim and seemingly unremitting horror. Now that I have read it, Stone’s adaptation (written with Kovic) almost seems to affirm some of the criticisms leveled at his work as sensationalist and excessive. In the main I do not agree with the opprobrium with which Stone is so frequently assaulted, but Born on the Fourth of July all too obviously embodies those faults others — admittedly, and largely, his political opponents — invariably see in him. Kovic’s book is so vivid, incendiary and felt, it scarcely required embellishments like the wholly fictitious Kara Sedgwick character, or Tom Cruise’s romantic run-through-the-rain-to-the-prom. It most especially did not need the sequence in which he and Willem Dafoe (in, again, a role for whom there is no antecedent in Kovic’s life) roll around on the Mexican sand and argue over whose claims of baby-killing are the most true.\n\nEven such incidents as Kovic’s shattering his leg and nearly losing it are turned, by Stone, into vulgar, overstated show-pieces (he was merely exercising his useless limbs at home, not parading around frenetically in a demented attempt to prove he could walk) and when, at the climax, Kovic is beaten by cops at the 1972 Republican convention in Miami, Stone cheats fact by turning it into Kovic’s heroic last-stand when the reality — he was brutally assaulted by para-military creeps who, when they finally realized he was, as he’d been telling them, a wounded vet, behaved with shame-faced obsequiousness — was so much more inherently and honestly dramatic. Wouldn’t that make a better sequence than presenting Kovic as storming (or anyway, wheeling) back into the convention hall to “take” it, a cinematic fantasy that manifestly did not occur? That sort of phony uplift is contemptible, and beneath a man of Stone’s gifts. I will grant that the picture brings up a subject Americans do not like to address, and which Kovic’s book repeatedly rubs our noses in: The sudden emasculation of the sexually incapacitated. That such lifelong impotence is routinely visited on one so young is one of the great, unspoken tragedies of war. Cruise is, as usual, insufferably over-dramatic, an amateur actor who only knows how to perform when the scene calls for overt, hectoring anger. One of the few unadulterated pleasures of the picture is the performance of Raymond J. Barry as Kovic’s gentle, shattered father, unable to cope with the wreck his country has made of his child. There’s dignity in that, and quiet honesty. It’s something Born on the Fourth of July could use more of.\n\nThe Doors (1992) Stone’s examination of Jim Morrison, co-written with J. Randal Johnson, has been harshly criticized, not least by members of The Doors, for distorting him and for emphasizing his pretension and his self-destructive behavior. Yet when a rock star, and a young man of 27, dies suddenly I submit that we may at least wonder whether drugs and alcohol may have played a role. On the other hand, the Morrison depicted in The Doors is so repellent and narcissistic it’s difficult to know how he could have possessed the charisma, and the creativity, to become a cultural icon. This is not to say that Val Kilmer is charmless in the role — indeed, he is exceptionally compelling — merely that the obnoxious qualities Morrison displays here are so prominent they cancel out his attributes.\n\nThe movie holds fascination despite these cavils. No one’s pictures look the way Stone’s do, or are put together remotely as he assembles them. The Doors has an appropriately trippy quality, and not only in the drug sequences. Stone emphasizes Morrison’s death obsessions literally, to the point of having both the spirit of an elderly Native shaman (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) and Richard Rutowski as Death stalking Kilmer at periodic points, such as when Rutowski dances more than suggestively behind Morrison during an orgiastic concert appearance; Stone said he wanted to convey the image of Death “fucking him in the ass,” which is curious considering how the picture shies away from any suggestion of Morrison’s alleged bisexuality — a claim his bandmates also, of course, vociferously deny.\n\nBut then, as everyone surely knows by now, rock music, unlike every other performing category on earth, is comprised wholly and entirely of heterosexuals.\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999) I’ve always thought televised football was at once stupid, loud, overlong and boring. Amazingly, it took the considerable and combined talents of John Logan and Oliver Stone to deliver an equally stupid, loud, overlong and boring movie about the game. There are two central stories, involving, primarily, a Miami franchise head coach (Al Pacino) and his struggle to hold onto his job and, secondarily, concentrating on a rising young star quarterback (Jamie Foxx) who first becomes an arrogant show-off and then must learn to be a humble team-player by the play-out. There are also sub-plots involving an aging team captain (Dennis Quaid) nursing a potentially debilitating injury and the team’s embattled owner and general manager (Cameron Diaz), and the characters include a duplicitous team physician (James Woods), a veteran linebacker with a cortisone addiction (Lawrence Taylor) and an egomaniacal sports reporter (the odious John C. McGinley, doing his usual overbaked caricature). Shall I go on? If all you want is two and a half hours of scabrous people and their petty problems and rivalries, or have always hoped to see a detached human eyeball in bloody close-up, Any Given Sunday is for you.\n\nWall Street (1987) Although supposedly made in tribute to his stockbroker father, Stone’s movie is really a disgusted response to the bald, grasping greed of the Reagan era. And while Michael Douglas is perhaps my least favorite actor of his generation, I must admit he has a feel — come by naturally, one presumes — for embodying sleaze. I am no more enamored of Charlie Sheen, Martin’s less gifted son, but even he is in good form here as Bud Fox, an ambitious young trader who willingly allows himself to become corrupt. (Is it coincidental that he shares the first name of Jack Lemmon’s equally climbing would-be junior executive in The Apartment?) Martin Sheen himself provides splendid contrast as Bud’s honest dad, Hal Holbrook has some nice moments as a seasoned broker, James Karen is solid as Bud’s predictably mercurial boss, and Terence Stamp does well by an icy corporate raider. Only Darryl Hanna proves a true embarrassment; in her big break-up scene with the younger Sheen, she’s appalling. Whatever his limitations as an actor, he’s trying to do honor to the moment, but she gives him nothing to play against. Stone, who wrote the screenplay with Stanley Weiser, has a fine feeling for the trappings and appurtenances of the time and place, although when the picture ends you may find yourself shrugging with indifference at the whole thing.\n\nAlexander: The Ultimate Cut (2004/2013) I missed Stone’s epic study of Alexander the Great when it was released in 2004, but I certainly remember the rank homophobia that attended it, from audiences, critics and entertainment reporters. The sexuality of Alexander the Great has been a matter of controversy for centuries, but one would like to have believed that by the beginning of the 21st some reasonableness on the subject might obtain. Instead the movie was derided, with schoolboy snickers, as Alexander the Gay. Even if one ignores his intense relationship with Hephaistion, or chooses to assume that he was chaste with his young eunuch courtier Bagoas, that Alexander married late, and left no heir, is surely indicative of something.\n\nMy own readings on Alexander have been limited to Mary Renault’s glorious fictions, particularly her splendid The Persian Boy, told from the perspective of Bagoas. Stone and his co-scenarists, Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis, based their screenplay largely on the historian Robin Lane Fox’s book on Alexander, but Renault was an inspiration as well, largely I would assume via Fire from Heaven, her novel of his formative years. (A third, Funeral Games, describes the events immediately following his death, likely by murder.) The scenarists frame their narrative around the reminiscences of the aged Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), and limn the forces that shaped Alexander, from early childhood to the end"
