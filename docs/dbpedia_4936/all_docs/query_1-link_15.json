        "text": "None of this is particularly cute, and someone ought to tell John Engler that.\n\nMichigan State University board of trustees chair Dianne Byrum is renewing her efforts to pressure former Michigan governor and former MSU interim president Engler to cooperate with an in-state interview with Attorney General Dana Nessel's office in the Larry Nassar investigation, an unseemly step Byrum should not be required to take.\n\nAll of which lends credence to Nessel's contention that Engler is shopping for a favorable venue for his law-enforcement interview: A locale with fewer consequences for lying to investigators.\n\nThere is no question that Engler understands that he is required to submit to an interview with Nessel's investigators. It is, Nessel's office says, in his contract, and Byrum says that Engler promised cooperation after his appointment as interim president.\n\nNor is there moral ambiguity about this investigation: Larry Nassar is a serial pedophile who assaulted scores of women and girls during his time as a sports doctor with MSU. The investigation, begun under former Republican AG Bill Schuette, is intended to determine whether university officials disregarded information that could have exposed, and thus ended, Nassar's crimes sooner.\n\nAnd there's no apparent risk that the onus for this could fall on Engler. Nassar was behind bars before Engler was appointed. (Nessel's office is also investigating whether Engler authorized the cancellation of a former trustee's debt to the school in exchange for his early retirement.)\n\nYet four months on, the interview hasn't happened.\n\nWhat has happened? Engler has watched a lot of basketball, traveling around the country to sit courtside at Spartans games, but somehow never finding time to meet with Nessel's investigators in Michigan.\n\nMore: John Engler sidesteps questions before Michigan State's NCAA opener\n\nMore: John Engler to AG's office: Unless you recuse yourself, I'm not doing interview with investigators\n\nMore: AG Dana Nessel: John Engler dodges my investigators, but finds time for basketball games\n\nIt's a lot of game-playing that suggests the former governor doesn't quite grasp the gravity of this situation, a posture that's entirely consistent with Engler's tenure at MSU. His representative's repeated efforts to portray Nessel's office as capricious and negligent is a stance a former elected official should understand is dangerously irresponsible.\n\nEngler became interim president of MSU after longtime leader LouAnna Simon, who has been charged with four counts of lying to Michigan State Police in the Nassar investigation, was ousted last year.\n\nEngler is an MSU alum, and regardless of how you feel about his politics, he's a head-cracker with a reputation for getting stuff done. His appointment, his supporters believed, would set MSU to rights after the turmoil of Nassar's exposure and conviction.\n\nBut the former governor made one misstep after another, saying that some of Nassar's victims liked the spotlight, suggesting that a prominent Nassar survivor was getting kickbacks from attorneys, quashing an issue of the alumni magazine that delved into the Nassar scandal, reportedly urging one survivor to take a secret payoff, closing the university's survivors' fund, and, weirdly, during an interview at Crain's Detroit Business, pointing at a female reporter while discussing the school's new protocol for vaginal exams.\n\nThese are what we call \"unforced errors.\"\n\nNessel's office has been working to schedule an interview with Engler since mid-January.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiating, Nessel said at a meeting with journalists late last month, and with the assurance that Engler wasn't going to travel to Michigan in the near future, the office offered to fly an investigator to Engler's Virginia home.\n\nThe former governor's representatives insisted the interview take place at Engler's Washington D.C. office. The AG's office agreed to fly an investigator to D.C. (at taxpayers' expense, it's a step the office doesn't often take) for a March 28 interview, state operations director Christine Grossi (appointed to lead the investigation by Nessel's Republican predecessor Schuette) told the reporters last month, based on the belief that Engler wasn't traveling to Michigan anytime soon.\n\nThen came March 9, and the Spartans' match against the University of Michigan, right there in East Lansing. Engler was in Chicago on March 15 for a playoff game, and in Des Moines on March 21.\n\nNessel's office cancelled the March 28 interview.\n\n\"We required all of our interviews for MSU employees to be conducted here. In the interest of fairness, we treat everyone the same, so if he can come to basketball games I don’t know why we wouldn’t interview him here,\" Grossi told the reporters.\n\nBut there's more: Given Engler's trip to Michigan, and other locales in the Midwest, it seemed there was more to the former governor's interest in holding the interview outside the state than the hardship of travel.\n\n\"I cancelled the interview because he made a misrepresentation to me that suggested there was a different interest at play, and if there’s a different interest at play, we need to re-evaluate how we move forward so we can address that properly because we need to make sure we do everything in an appropriate way,\" Grossi says.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Nessel says, unless an interview subject is under oath, there aren't repercussions for lying to an investigating officer.\n\nAnd, she says, \"Our office can’t hold someone accountable for what they do in another jurisdiction.\"\n\nEngler has dodged questions from reporters, deferring to his attorney, who has accused Grossi of acting badly, and who has said Engler hasn't heard from Nessel's office since the appointment was cancelled. But Engler's attorney, Nessel's spokeswoman says, has been told that it's on Engler now.\n\nThe ball, you might say, is in his court.\n\nNancy Kaffer is a Free Press columnist.
