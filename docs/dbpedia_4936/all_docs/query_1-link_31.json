        "text": "John Engler, the interim president of Michigan State University, has drawn fire in recent days for saying in an interview that some of the women abused by Lawrence G. Nassar, a former faculty member and the ex-doctor for the United States national gymnastics team, appeared to be enjoying the spotlight.\n\nThe comments by Mr. Engler, 70, a former governor of Michigan who has been accused of antagonism toward Dr. Nassar’s hundreds of accusers, came during an interview with The Detroit News, which last Friday published an article based on the interview.\n\nHis remarks received renewed focus this week and sparked outrage after they were widely shared online. A spokeswoman for the university did not respond to emails seeking comment on Tuesday.\n\n“There are a lot of people who are touched by this, survivors who haven’t been in the spotlight,” Mr. Engler said, according to The Detroit News. “In some ways they have been able to deal with this better than the ones who’ve been in the spotlight who are still enjoying that moment at times, you know, the awards and recognition. And it’s ending. It’s almost done.”\n\nMr. Engler served three terms as governor of Michigan, from 1991 to 2003. He was appointed university president on an interim basis last year amid the Nassar abuse scandal, which led to the resignation and indictment of his predecessor.\n\nHis comments were criticized by members of the board, including its recently elected chairwoman, Dianne Byrum, who described them in a statement to The Chronicle of Higher Education as “ill advised and not helpful to the healing process, survivors, or the university.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
