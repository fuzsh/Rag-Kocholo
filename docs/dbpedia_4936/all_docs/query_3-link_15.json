        "text": "SERIES 01: OFFICE FILES\n\n(31 l.ft.)\n\nThis series consists of general material from Presidential Personnel (PPO) records and some material transferred from existing Pendleton James and Helene Von Damm collections. Some of this material may be moved later to more distinct series - please check with the Library or new updates of the inventory for any further changes.\n\nSERIES 02: AMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENTS\n\n(9 l.ft.; OAs 17284-9; 18846; 19034)\n\nThis series consists of ambassadorial appointments for specific individuals arranged alphabetically by last name, specific country ambassadors and Department of State information.\n\nSERIES 03: OPM REPORTS AND FORMS\n\n(15 l.ft.; OAs17249-59; 18849-52)\n\nThis series consists of two subseries - SUBSERIES A: Clearance Reports and Forms by Organization and SUBSERIES B: Reports and Listings. The first subseries consists of clearance reports for nominated or appointed individuals by their designated agency. The agencies each have three letter codes which we have spelled out for convenience. The second subseries consists of Office of Personnel Management reports of job openings and incumbents.\n\nSUB-SERIES A: CLEARANCE REPORTS AND FORMS BY ORGANIZATION\n\nSUB-SERIES B: REPORTS AND LISTINGS\n\nSERIES 04: PAS (PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENTS REQUIRING SENATE CONFIRMATION)\n\n(13 l.ft.; OAs 17237-48)\n\nThis series consists of folders of the specific individuals considered for PAS status openings within the administration. They are arranged alphabetically by last name.\n\nSERIES 05: JUDICIAL PERSONNEL\n\n(13 l.ft.; OAs 15684-86; 15677-83; 17235-6)\n\nThis series consists of three subseries - SUBSERIES A: Judicial Selection Committee Meetings; SUBSERIES B: Appointments and Openings and SUBSERIES C: Personnel Data. As a general note - all \"Judicial Personnel\" business during the Reagan administration also included selection of United States Attorneys and United States Marshals. The first subseries consists of agendas, decisions and candidate profiles for various meetings of the President's Judicial Selection Committee meetings. The director of Presidential Personnel was an official member of this committee along with members of the White House Counsel's Office, Department of Justice representatives, Office of Legislative Affairs representatives and various changing members from throughout the White House staff. Meeting notes within this series are for 1981-82 only. The second subseries consists of information about specific court opening and specific individuals being considered for appointment. The third subseries consists of folders about specific appointees arranged alphabetically by last name and separated by specific appointments - judicial, marshals, or attorneys.\n\nSUB-SERIES A: JUDICIAL SELECTION MEETINGS\n\nSUB-SERIES B: APPOINTMENTS AND OPENINGS\n\nSUB-SERIES C: PERSONNEL DATA\n\nSERIES 06: PART-TIME BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS\n\n(33 l.ft.; OAs 18232-50; 18828-31; 18219-25)\n\nThis series consists of two subseries - SUBSERIES A: Active and SUBSERIES B: Abolished and Terminated. The first subseries consists of material arranged by the specific board and the possible nominees for membership. Folders originally contained three letter acronyms for identification. We have added the full name of the board or commission to folder titles for clarity. The second subseries contains material for boards or commissions abolished or no longer active during the Reagan administration.\n\nSUB-SERIES A: ACTIVE\n\nSUB-SERIES B: ABOLISHED AND TERMINATED\n\nSERIES 07: SECRETARIAL BOARDS\n\n(4 l.ft.; OAs 117236; 17283; 18216)\n\nSERIES 08: POSITIONS\n\n(10 l.ft.; OAs 18226-31, 18844-5)\n\nThis series consists of material regarding positions and personnel within various departments and agencies throughout the Federal government. There is a small amount of material regarding positions/personnel for boards, commission and White House staff.\n\nSERIES 09: LEGAL CLEARANCES\n\n(4 l.ft.; OAs 9269, 18834, 18847-48)\n\nThis series consists of original memos from the White House Counsel to the Director of Presidential Personnel notifying the Director that the clearance and certification processes have been completed for given candidate[s], and that formal nomination may proceed.\n\nSERIES 10: CONFIDENTIAL FILES\n\n(17.5 l.ft. CFOAs 770, 834, 841, 1139-1148, 1280)\n\nThis is not a true series. The sensitive material from various parts of the office had been gathered together in a secured safe, then later placed in separate boxes. At the time of processing, folders will be transferred to the appropriate collection/series such as PAS, Ambassadorial Appointments, Part-Time Boards and Commissions, etc.\n\nSERIES 11: PUBLICATIONS\n\n(2 l.ft. OAs 3902, 9278, 19028)\n\nThis series consists of published material from various agencies and the public.\n\nSERIES 12: PROCESS FILES\n\n(15 l.ft. OAs 18879-18888, 19035-19036)\n\nThis series consists of case files regarding individuals who sought jobs in the Administration. Material includes PPO routing, applications, and report forms, at the front of each case file; letters of recommendation, resumes; and published works written by or mentioning the various individuals, which they themselves evidently sent to the PPO. Although the case files are intermittently arranged alphabetically, there is no overall arrangement to them.\n\nSERIES 13: SKC/SES CLEARANCE FILES\n\n(77.5 l.ft. OAs 18576-18599, 18600-18612, 18614-18638)\n\nSERIES 14: PERSONNEL FILES\n\n(112 l.ft. OAs 13521-13525, 16426-16480, 17076-17110, 17218-17234, 19031-19033, 19037-19038, 19040-19041, 18251-18252, 18523-18526)\n\nThis series consists of unofficial files kept by the Office of Presidential Personnel. These files may contain one or more of the following types of documents: Resumes, Recommendations, PPO Computer Code Sheets, Correspondence, Resume Tickets, Personal Data Questionnaires, Personnel Worksheets, and Applications (Form SF171.) Personnel Files consists of five subseries based on the different physical types of the folders which appear to be some kind of internal office coding of the Office of Presidential Personnel. Each Subseries is in alphabetical order. The Subseries are as follows: Subseries A – \"Personnel\" Files; Subseries B – \"Applicant\" Files; Subseries C – \"Resume\" Files; Subseries D – \"Addenda\" Files; and Subseries E – \"Confidential\" Files. As of this date, the Library has been unable to determine the significance of the division of material into five separate sets.\n\nSUB-SERIES A: \"PERSONAL\" FILES\n\nSUB-SERIES B: \"APPLICANT\" FILES\n\nSUB-SERIES C: \"RESUME\" FILES\n\nSUB-SERIES D: \"ADDENDA\" FILES\n\nSUB-SERIES E: \"CONFIDENTIAL\" FILES\n\nSERIES 15: PRE-INAUGURAL MATERIAL\n\n(9 l.ft OAs 1070, 12918-12923)\n\nThis series will eventually be moved to the Ronald Reagan 1980 Transition collection and the 1980 Reagan/Bush Campaign collection. It will no longer be part of the Office of Presidential Personnel at that point. Since the material pre-dates the administration it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests."
