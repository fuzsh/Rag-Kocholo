        "text": "EAST LANSING – By June 2019, Michigan State University hopes to hire an empathetic, compassionate new president to lead it out of the Larry Nassar scandal.\n\nOn Wednesday, as criticism of interim MSU President John Engler continued to swirl and state and federal investigators continued to review the university’s handling of Nassar and other sex assault cases, two trustees announced a presidential search timeline that will begin with community listening sessions next month and end with a new hire a year from now.\n\nThe university hopes to form a search committee by August, made up of about 15 students, faculty, staff, alumni, deans and trustees, Trustees Dianne Byrum and Melanie Foster said at a news conference Wednesday on campus. The MSU board hopes to hire a search firm by September and interview its first applicants by November.\n\nFrom the archives: \"In Larry Nassar's wake, Michigan State faces hurdles in finding the right president\"\n\nRelated: \"Engler sees 'wicked fight' ahead with insurance companies over Larry Nassar settlement\"\n\nMore: \"Emails shed light on how John Engler became Michigan State's interim president\"\n\nEngler, who is expected to remain interim president despite the criticism, will not be involved in the search, the trustees said.\n\nUpdates will be posted and comments can be submitted through a new website, msu.edu/presidentialsearch.\n\nThe listening sessions — which will include MSU students, faculty, staff and alumni in small focus groups and open forums — will be used to develop a list of qualifications and characteristics the university wants in a new leader, Byrum said.\n\nStory continues below video.\n\nPressed by a reporter to say what qualifications might be necessary, Byrum said MSU’s new president must have empathy and “that intellect that can understand people’s feelings and internalize that, and be able to show compassion.”\n\nThe university needs someone who can “understand and embrace institutional integrity,” added Foster.\n\nSitting in the audience, MSU senior Mackenzie Mrla asked why she should believe the university will find those characteristics now, when they don’t have them in Engler. The former Michigan governor has been slammed for comments made in private meetings and sent in emails — made public by the media — that were insensitive to Nassar victims.\n\n“What we can say is, we’re focusing on the future,” Byrum answered.\n\n“But that doesn’t change what happened in the past,” Mrla, a 20-year-old Trenton native, said.\n\nThat exchange highlights the broken trust and damaged reputation at MSU that might make it difficult to attract top-tier presidential candidates. Criticism of the university’s leaders has not stopped despite a $500 million settlement agreement with Nassar victims and multiple reforms officials say make campus safer.\n\nByrum and Foster conceded the new president will be challenged, but said the university still has much to offer, such as high-performing academics and many research dollars.\n\n“There’s lots and lots of opportunities here for a world-class leader,” Foster said.\n\nThis is MSU’s first nationwide search in a quarter-century. Former president Lou Anna Simon, who resigned Jan. 24 amid criticism of her handling of the Nassar case, was an internal candidate when she was hired in 2005. Her predecessor was hired in 1993.\n\nThe university is being advised in its presidential search by University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan, who is expected to sign a contract worth $1,000 a day for about a day’s work per week.\n\nClick here for full coverage of the Nassar scandal.\n\nMichigan State University’s presidential search timeline\n\nJuly to October: Listening sessions with MSU staff, students, faculty and alumni\n\nJuly: Issue request for proposals for a presidential search firm\n\nAugust: Form a search committee made up of roughly 15 people representing students, staff, faculty and alumni\n\nSeptember: Interview and hire a search firm\n\nOctober: Post job opening that includes list of qualities and characteristics — developed through listening sessions — that MSU wants in a new president\n\nNovember through January: Conduct initial interviews with applicants\n\nFebruary through May: Interview finalists\n\nJune 2019: Hire new president\n\nVisit msu.edu/presidentialsearch for updates."
