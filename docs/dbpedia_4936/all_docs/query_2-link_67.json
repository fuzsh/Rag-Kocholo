INTRODUCTION During the 116th Congress, the Committee on Oversight and Reform and its subcommittees held 134 hearings, as well as several virtual Member briefings in addition to hearings beginning in March 2020 when House offices began teleworking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee issued 238 state and district level staff reports for Members of the House covering issues ranging from drug prices to census data to climate change. In addition, 16 bills advanced by the Committee were enacted into law. An additional 33 bills, not including postal naming measures, were passed by the House. Seven of those House-passed bills may be enacted into law in the final days of the 116th Congress after the filing of this report. Major investigations conducted during the 116th Congress included the high cost of prescription drugs; the federal response and other issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic; efforts to combat the opioid crisis; barriers to health care access; self-dealing and violations of ethics laws by senior Executive Branch officials; the President's conflicts of interest; security clearances and safeguarding classified information; voting rights, voter suppression, and election security; climate change; child separation; workers' rights and protections; efforts by senior Administration and White House officials to rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabi; preparations for the 2020 Decennial Census and the Trump Administration's efforts to add a citizenship question; mismanagement and challenges facing the Postal Service; cybersecurity, privacy, and consumer protection issues; and the President's conditioning of a White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance for Ukraine in exchange for a promise that the Ukrainian President would conduct an investigation into President Trump's political rival, then- former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. At the beginning of the 116th Congress, the Committee Chair was Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and the Ranking Member was Rep. Jim Jordan. Chairman Cummings passed away on October 17, 2019.

To carry out its duties as effectively as possible, at the beginning of the 116th Congress, the Committee established the following five standing subcommittees: Subcommittee on National Security; Subcommittee on Government Operations; Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy; Subcommittee on Environment; and Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. On April 23, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the House passed H. Res. 935 establishing the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis as an additional investigative subcommittee of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.
