        "text": "¶ Abortion, Generally\n\nMike Rogers Said He Supported “The Further Restriction Of Abortion” Of Any Abortion “Not Related To Saving The Life Of The Mother.” According to the Lansing State Journal, “In recent years, the Michigan Legislature has placed limits on abortion – including a 24-hour waiting period and requiring minors to receive parental permission. What restrictions, if any, do you support on abortion? […] Mike Rogers R-Howell 546-9712 ‘I support the further restriction of abortion based on the sex of the baby, and of any abortion not related to saving the life of the mother.’” [Lansing State Journal, 7/25/94]\n\nMike Rogers Was Opposed To Abortion. According to the Lansing State Journal, “They sound alike as they call for: -Tougher sentencing for violent criminals, and more austere prison conditions. -Ending lifestyle instruction in schools, more stress on reading, writing and arithmetic. -Opposition to abortion, gun control and assisted suicide While Rogers lauds Republican Gov. John Engler’s lead in dropping general assistance, Dragonetti credits Engler for leading the voters to shift much school finance from property levies to a sales-tax share.” [Lansing State Journal, 7/26/94]\n\nMike Rogers Said He Would Fight Against Pro-Choice Proponents. According to the Livingston County Daily Press and Argus, “One issue on which Rogers agrees with Dillingham is abortion. ‘I commend him for championing the cause,’ Rogers said. Rogers said he would continue the fight against pro-choice and assisted suicide proponents.” [Livingston County Daily Press and Argus, 7/27/94]\n\nMike Rogers: “I Support All Restrictions On Abortion.” According to the Lansing State Journal, “In recent years, the Michigan Legislature has placed limits on abortion – including a 24-hour waiting period and requiring minors to receive parental permission. What restrictions, if any, do you support on abortion? […] Mike Rogers R-Howell 1-546-9712 ‘I support all restrictions on abortion, since I consider it intentional taking of life. I would further support legislation restricting abortions done for choosing the sex of a baby.’” [Lansing State Journal, 10/24/94]\n\nMike Rogers Repeatedly Said The Federal Government Was Established For Unborn Lives And Called Roe v. Wade A “Travesty.” [Mike Rogers Constituent Letter, accessed via Oakland University Archives, 2004]\n\nMike Rogers Said That The Federal Government Was “Established To Protect Our Lives And The Lives Of The Unborn.” [Mike Rogers Letter To Constituent, accessed via Oakland University Archives, 12/17/96]\n\nMike Rogers Called For Legislation On “Capitol Hill” On Abortion And Called Roe v. Wade A “Travesty.” [Mike Rogers Letter To March For Life, accessed via Oakland University Archives, 1/22/00]\n\nMike Rogers Opposed Abortion Except To Save The Life Of The Mother. According to Congressional Quarterly, “On abortion, the candidates are, in Rogers' words, ‘as far apart as we can get.’ Rogers opposes abortion except to save the life of the pregnant woman; Byrum supports abortion rights and voted in the legislature against banning a particular technique labeled by its critics as ‘partial-birth’ abortion. Byrum was one of the first candidates for 2000 endorsed by EMILY's List, the organization that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/13/00]\n\n[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Said That He Was A “Pro-Life Candidate My Entire Career.” “Hi. Can you please tell me your position on abortion? Rogers: Yes. So I’ve been a pro-life candidate my entire career. The Supreme Court did something interesting. They pushed it down to the states. And so I look at this. I mean, this is the most intense personal decision anybody would make in their life. It happens to be their family and their faith. And my argument, the states are the best place to handle those conversations. I think the states are going to mediate this. I know New Hampshire has a 24 week requirement. Other states have other requirements. I think as a pro-lifer myself and in the pro-life community, we're going to have to find ways to educate. I think we lost the education debate on this about where states should be. And I think that's probably the best way to handle it. And this this is an issue, again, because it's so personal, because it's such a faith-based and family based decision, better handle it locally where you can have conversations with people are going to make that decision. Thank you.” [WMUR, 5/5/23]\n\n[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Said He Did Not Know If He Would Support A Federal Ban On Abortion. “Quick follow up for you here, congressman, coming from me on this. If you are in the White House and Congress does decide to pass some kind of law, if you think it’s a states issue, does that mean it’s an automatic veto for you, even though you’re pro-life? Mike Rogers: I’d have to look at it. I believe that the least amount that the federal government does, the better off we’re all going to be. I mean, remember when federal government got involved in education, they said they were going to cure the problem. We have the federal Department of Education, and look where our education is today. So I would be inclined to say if it’s a states issue, it needs to be a states issue. It doesn't mean you can't advocate for your position. It doesn't mean you shouldn't be having conversations about your position. But I don't know if a federal ban superseding states which the Supreme Court said that's where it ought to be. I'm just I’m not sure. I don't think I’d be there. Okay.” [WMUR, 5/5/23]\n\nRogers Aligned With Trump’s Position For Abortion Regulations To Be Left To States Despite Previous Support For Federal Abortion Restrictions. According to USA Today, “Republicans facing tough reelection campaigns this fall are welcoming former President Donald Trump's newly announced position that abortion regulations should be left up to the states, even as some of their less vulnerable peers openly contradict him. […] Republican Senate candidates Mike Rogers of Michigan, Bernie Moreno of Ohio and David McCormick of Pennsylvania also reportedly staked out similar positions, though both Moreno and Rogers have previously indicated support for some federal restrictions.” [USA Today, 4/10/24]\n\nRogers Agreed That All Voters Supported Abortion Access To Some Extent And He Wanted The Decision To Return To States. “Host: Apparently, voters of all walks of life seem to support abortion access to some act to some extent. Right. 1:30 Mike Rogers - I think that's very, very true. And so when you look at, you know, listen, I'm a pro-life legislator. I did believe it should go back to the states. I've said that for years.” [Mike Rogers, The Steve Gruber Show, Michigan, 4/12/24]\n\n¶ Michigan Prop 3\n\n¶ Mike Rogers Did Not VOte On Prop 3 Because He Lived In Florida, But Said He Would Have Voted Against It\n\n[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Said He Did Not Vote On Prop 3 Because He Lived In Florida, But That He Was A “Pro-Life Guy.” “Skubick: How did you vote on Prop 3? Rogers: Prop 3? Skubick: The abortion issue. Rogers: Ah, um. Listen, I think – here’s what’s going to happen on abortion in America. Skubick: How did you vote on it? Rogers: You know, there’s a curtain behind there for a reason. Oh come on, that’s funny. Melinn: I’m just curious if you even voted though in Michigan? Rogers: I did not vote in Michigan. I had moved to Florida because of some business opportunities I had down there. Here’s what I think is going to happen on abortion in America. Every state capitol is going to go through this fight where it belongs. And if you look at where the average American is, listen, I’m a pro-life guy. I voted pro-life. And I don’t walk away from that. I think that what’s going to happen is everyone’s going to determine by each state what length of time you have to make your decision before you can’t do it. If you look at polling numbers, the third-trimester, Americans find unacceptable. Now you’ll find a lot of places in the county where they sold it as one thing and did another thing. But I think what you’re going to find over time is that number is going to settle in where people have a comfort level of allowing women to have time to decide what they want to do.” [Off The Record Overtime, 3/3/23]\n\n[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Said If He Had Been In Michigan, He Would Have Voted Against Prop 3. “Skubick: If you had been here in Michigan, would you have supported Proposal 3? Rogers: I don’t believe, I’m not sure how it was written honestly. Skubuck: It was written basically to say a woman has a right to choose. And it legalized abortion. Rogers: Yeah, I probably wouldn’t have done it because it covers right up to the day of birth. And I’m not there. I don’t think most Americans are there. I think that’s kind of an extreme position candidly. I think what’s going to happen is they’re going to settle on a time in the future. I’ll put money on that.” [Off The Record Overtime, 3/3/23]\n\n[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Would Not Say If A Woman Has A Right To Choose. “Skubick: So you would be pro-choice with a timeframe? Rogers: No. No. I’m going to continue to be pro-life. What I think the pro-life community has to do – Skubick: Does a woman have a right to choose? Rogers: According to Michigan, Montana, Kansas, yes, yes, yes. So a matter of fact, it is not illegal anywhere and wasn’t illegal under Roe v. Wade. What the pro-life community in my mind needs to focus on is the alternatives and talking people into ways that they don’t have to have an abortion. I think that’s what’s going to happen.” [Off The Record Overtime, 3/3/23]\n\n¶ Medicaid\n\n¶ 1996: Mike Rogers Voted For Legislation To Clarify The State Ban On Medicaid Funds Being Used For Abortions\n\n1996: Mike Rogers Voted For Legislation Clarifying That State Law Prohibits Medicaid Funds From Going Towards Abortions And Prohibiting Accepting Reimbursements For Performing An Abortion. In February 1996, Mike Rogers voted for House Bill 5458. The legislation would, according to the Associated Press, clarify “that state law prohibits the diversion of Medicaid funds to perform abortions, and prohibits a health care professional or a health facility from accepting reimbursement from public funds for performing an abortion. Under the new law, violators will be liable for a civil fine of up to $10,000.” The legislation passed the Michigan Senate on a 28-9 vote. The legislation then passed the Michigan House on a 76-27 vote. The legislation was signed by Governor John Engler and became law. [Michigan Legislature, House Bill 5458, 2/26/98; Associated Press, 3/14/96]\n\nLegislation Would Clarify That State Law Prohibits The Diversion Of Medicaid Funds To Perform Elective Abortions, And Prohibits A Health Care Professional Or A Health Facility From Accepting Reimbursement From Public Funds For Performing An Abortion. According to the Detroit Free Press, “According to McManus and backers of the bill, primary care physicians knowingly refer pregnant women for abortions under the guise of obtaining family planning services. HMOs then submit bills for family planning services while performing abortions and charging Medicaid recipients only $50, McManus said. The HMOs have been warned by the state that such a practice would conflict with the intent of state law. The bill would clarify that state law prohibits the diversion of Medicaid funds to perform elective abortions, and prohibits a health care professional or a health facility from accepting reimbursement from public funds for performing an abortion. ‘I do not believe Michigan taxpayers voted in 1988 for a $50 co-pay on Medicaid abortions,’ McManus said late last year when the bill passed the House. ‘Family planning services cannot be used as a shield to circumvent state law.’ A violation of the proposed law would carry a civil fine of up to $10,000.” [Detroit Free Press, 2/19/96]\n\nMike Rogers Co-Sponsored The Senate Version Of The Legislation. [Michigan Legislature, Senate Bill 0793, 12/6/95]\n\n¶ Partial-Birth Abortion\n\n¶ 1996: Mike Rogers Voted For Legislation To Ban So-Called Partial Birth Abortion\n\n1996: Mike Rogers Voted For Legislation To Ban So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion. In May 1996, Mike Rogers voted for House Bill 5889. The legislation would, according to the Detroit Free Press, “strip the licenses of doctors who perform so-called partial-birth abortions.” The legislation passed the Michigan House on a 63-36 vote. The legislation then passed the Michigan Senate on a 28-8 vote. The legislation was signed by Governor John Engler and became law. [Michigan Legislature, House Bill 5889, 5/29/96; Detroit Free Press, 5/16/96]\n\nLegislation Would Strip The Licenses Of Doctors Who Perform So-Called Partial-Birth Abortions. According to the Detroit Free Press, “Michigan's powerful antiabortion lobby will unite today at the Capitol around a legislative initiative that would strip the licenses of doctors who perform so-called partial-birth abortions. Enactment of the measure, which has the support of Gov. John Engler and leaders in the House and Senate, would mark the first restriction on abortion procedures in Michigan since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion. Federal legislation to criminalize the procedure was passed by Congress and vetoed by President Bill Clinton last month. Rep. James Ryan, R-Redford Township, one of the bill's sponsors, said Wednesday that backers hope to pass the legislation by early summer. Partial-birth abortion is a rare procedure performed late in a pregnancy in which a fetus is drawn into the birth canal, its skull penetrated and brains removed. Ryan called the procedure ‘brutal and reprehensible.’” [Detroit Free Press, 5/16/96]\n\nLegislation Only Provided An Exception For Life Of The Mother. According to the Associated Press, “The rare procedure attracted increased interest when President Clinton vetoed a federal bill to ban it. Gov. John Engler endorsed a state bill to ban it, and the issue has taken on potential importance for the presidential race. The bills would prohibit partial-birth abortions except when the mother's life was in danger. The term refers to a technique where the fetus is extracted feet first and the doctor contracts its skull, by sucking out its brain, so it will fit through the birth canal.” [Associated Press, 5/29/96]\n\nMike Rogers Co-Sponsored The Senate Version Of The Legislation. [Michigan Legislature, Senate Bill 1029, 5/15/96]\n\n¶ Legislation Was Written So Broadly It Could Forbid Nearly All Abortions\n\nLegislation Was Written So Broadly That It Could Forbid Nearly All Abortions. According to the Associated Press, “Legislation to ban most so-called ‘partial-birth abortions’ in Michigan passed a House panel on Thursday, but a doctor said the bill is so broad it could forbid nearly all abortions. ‘The way it is worded could outlaw 95 percent of all abortions,’ said Dr. Mark Evans, vice chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Wayne State University's medical school. Evans was referring to the bill's definition of partial-birth abortion, which does not describe in detail a rare procedure that involves extracting the fetus feet first and contracting its skull so it will fit through the birth canal. Instead, the legislation describes partial-birth abortions as one in which the doctor ‘partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.’ That, Evans said, could apply to almost any abortion, including those performed early in a woman's pregnancy in which suction is used to extract the fetus from the womb. Only abortions to remove a stillborn fetus would be clearly exempt, he said.” [Associated Press, 5/24/96]\n\nOpponents Said The Legislation Was A Thinly Veiled Attempt To Ban Nearly All Abortions. According to the Associated Press, “Rep. Jim Ryan, R-Redford Township responded: ‘Just because it's not happening in Michigan does not mean it (the ban) is not appropriate.’ Opponents said the bill, instead of being needed, was actually a thinly veiled attempt to ban nearly all abortions. They pointed out the bill's definition of the procedure is so vaguely worded it could apply to nearly any abortion, including those performed very early in a woman's pregnancy.” [Associated Press, 5/30/96]\n\n¶ Mike Rogers Voted Against An Amendment That Still Banned The Procedure But Narrowed The Bill’s Scope\n\nMike Rogers Voted Against An Amendment That Would Have Banned Partial-Birth Abortion But Defined The Technique In Proper Medical Terms, Narrowing The Bill’s Scope. According to the Associated Press, “But Sen. Gary Peters, D-Pontiac, charged the legislation ‘has a lot more to do with politics than with public policy.’ ‘The language is much too broad and too vague,’ he said, warning that it might outlaw 95 percent of all abortions. That, he said, is the intention of backers of the bill. Senate Minority Leader John Cherry, D-Clio, charged Wednesday that Republicans were using partial-birth abortion as a ‘wedge issue’ to try to score political points with the voters. ‘It's obvious they're putting people on record,’ he said of GOP lawmakers. The Senate rejected, 20-13, Peters' alternative bill, which he said would also ban the procedure but define the technique in proper medical terms, thus narrowing the bill's scope. The only senators voting against the bill were Democrats Peters, Jackie Vaughn of Detroit, Alma Smith of South Lyon, Virgil Smith of Detroit, Joseph Conroy of Flint, Joseph Young of Detroit, Jim Berryman of Adrian and Diane Byrum of Lansing.” [Associated Press, 7/7/96]\n\n¶ So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion Was Not Performed In Michigan\n\nMichigan’s Statistics Showed That Partial-Birth Abortion Was Not Even Performed In Michigan. According to the Associated Press, “A ban on a type of late-term abortion procedure that the state's own statistics show is not performed in Michigan cleared the House Wednesday. The vote came amid charges from pro-choice lawmakers that backers raised the issue and pushed it through the Legislature on an extraordinarily fast track merely as an election-year tool for conservatives. ‘For those of you who are taking a position today because of political expediency, it's worse than wrong - it's despicable,’ said Rep. Barbara Dobb, R-Commerce Township. Supporters shot back that the bill would serve a crucial purpose by prohibiting a procedure that is extremely dangerous for women and kills fetuses that might otherwise be able to live. ‘Those who try to defend this grisly procedure are the extremists,’ said Rep. Jack Horton, R-Lowell. Introduced just two weeks ago, the bill was approved on a 63-36 vote. An identical measure is awaiting a vote by the full Senate, and both have the backing of Gov. John Engler. In 1994, the last year for which figures were available, there were 33,061 abortions performed in Michigan, according to the state Department of Community Health. Just one of that year's 233 abortions that were performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy used a procedure called ‘dilation and curettage,’ the documents showed. That procedure is the one in the state's records closest to the one referred to by proponents of the bill, but still is not the same.” [Associated Press, 5/30/96]\n\n¶ 1997: Legislation Was Struck Down As Unconstitutional\n\nAugust 1997: Federal Judge Ruled Michigan’s Ban On So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion Was Unconstitutionally Vague According to the Associated Press, “Michigan's ban on certain late-term abortions was struck down Thursday by a federal judge who said the law was unconstitutionally vague. The American Civil Liberties Union said U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen's ruling was the first in the nation against a ban on partial-birth abortion following a trial. Rosen found that the law aimed at stopping ‘partial-birth’ abortions ran afoul of several U.S. Supreme Court decisions on abortion. He said the Michigan law, which is similar to a bill pending in Congress, not only is too vague, but places too much burden on women seeking abortions, especially in the second trimester. Rosen said trial testimony showed him ‘the statute was so broadly written and ill-defined, it could apply to more than 85 percent of post-first trimester abortions procedures performed in Michigan and that, as a result, women seeking abortions would be required to choose less safe abortion alternatives.’” [Associated Press, 8/1/97]\n\n¶ 1998: Mike Rogers Voted For Legislation Again To Ban So-Called Partial Birth Abortion\n\n1998: Mike Rogers Voted To Restore Michigan’s Ban On So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion. In June 1998, Mike Rogers voted for Senate Bill 0888. The legislation would, according to State Net Capitol Journal, restore “a state ban on partial-birth abortions” and “amend the current definition of ‘partial-birth abortion’ by specifying that the term would only apply to an intact fetus and not to a legal abortion where the life of the fetus is terminated inside the mother’s uterus.” The legislation passed the Michigan Senate on a 29-8 vote. No further action was taken. [Michigan Legislature, Senate Bill 0888, 6/4/98; State Net Capitol Journal, 6/8/98]\n\nLegislation Would Restore Michigan’s Ban On So-Called Partial Birth Abortion And Specify That Partial-Birth Abortion Would Only Apply To An Intact Fetus And Not To A Legal Abortion Where The Life Of The Fetus Is Terminated Inside The Mother’s Uterus. According to State Net Capitol Journal, “Members of the Michigan Senate on Thursday took a shot at restoring a state ban on partial-birth abortions that was struck down last year by a Federal District Court judge. SB 888, sponsored by Sen. Joel Gougeon (R-Bay City) would amend the public health code with language aimed at satisfying objections to the state's existing ban on partial-birth abortions. That ban was contained in PA 273 of 1996. When enforcement of PA 273 was enjoined, the judge ruled that the definition of partial birth abortion in the law was unconstitutionally vague. SB 888 would amend the current definition of ‘partial-birth abortion’ by specifying that the term would only apply to an intact fetus and not to a legal abortion where the life of the fetus is terminated inside the mother's uterus. Specifically, the bill defines a partial birth abortion as ‘partially vaginally deliver[ing] a living, intact fetus before killing the fetus.’” [State Net Capitol Journal, 6/8/98]\n\n¶ Mike Rogers Voted Against Amendments To Bill, Including Adding An Exception For Health Of The Mother\n\nMike Rogers Voted Against An Amendment Changing Partial-Birth Abortion To The Terms “Intact Dilation And Extraction.” Mike Rogers voted “no” on an amendment that would, according to State Net Capitol Journal, change the definition of partial-birth abortion to “use the terms ‘intact dilation and extraction.’” The amendment was defeated on a 8-29 vote. [Michigan Journal Of The Senate, Roll Call No. 427, 6/4/98; State Net Capitol Journal, 6/8/98]\n\nMike Rogers Voted Against Defining When A Child Was Viable. Mike Rogers voted ‘no’ on an amendment that would, according to State Net Capitol Journal, ‘define when a child is viable.’ The amendment was defeated on a 8-29 vote. [Michigan Journal Of The Senate, Roll Call No. 428, 6/4/98; State Net Capitol Journal, 6/8/98]\n\nMike Rogers Voted Against Adding An Exception For Health Of The Mother. Mike Rogers voted “no” on an amendment that would, according to State Net Capitol Journal, “have added to the bill’s exemption of cases where the mother's life is in danger to add the language ‘or preserve the health’ of the mother.” [Michigan Journal Of The Senate, Roll Call No. 429 6/4/98; State Net Capitol Journal, 6/8/98]\n\n¶ 2002: Mike Rogers Voted For Partial-Birth Abortion Act\n\n2002: Mike Rogers Voted To Ban So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion. In July 2002, Mike Rogers voted for HR 4965, dubbed the “Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.” The legislation would, according to the National Journal, “ban what sponsors call ‘partial-birth’ abortion.” The legislation passed the House on a 274-151 vote, but no other action was taken. [Congress.gov, H.R. 4965, 7/24/02; Roll Call Vote 343; National Journal, 7/27/02]\n\n¶ 2003: Mike Rogers Voted For Partial-Birth Abortion Act\n\n2003: Mike Rogers Voted To Ban So-Called Partial-Birth Abortion. In October 2003, Mike Rogers voted for S. 3, dubbed the “Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.” The legislation would, according to the Sacramento Bee, “ban the so-called ‘partial-birth’ abortion procedure subjecting those who perform it to fines and two years in prison.” The legislation passed the House on a 281-142 vote. The legislation then passed the Senate on a 64-34 vote. The legislation was signed by President George W. Bush and became law. [Congress.gov, S. 3, 10/2/03; Roll Call Vote 530; Sacramento Bee, 10/3/03]\n\nLegislation Did Not Include An Exception For Health Of The Mother. According to a Des Moines Register editorial, “The bill also is troubling because it's imprecise. The definition of partial-birth abortion is so vague it risks criminalizing other abortion procedures. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the law would outlaw a variation of the dilation and evacuation procedure common in midterm abortions. The bill makes no exception for the health of the mother. Legal problems with the bill are obvious. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion because it was so vague -it was unclear to doctors what exactly was illegal. The court also stated Nebraska failed to make an exception ‘for the preservation of the health of the mother.’ This is what tends to happen when lawmakers take it upon themselves to play doctor. They forget that decisions about health care are best left up to patients and real doctors.” [Editorial – Des Moines Register, 11/1/03]\n\n¶ Mike Rogers Voted Against A Health Of The Mother Exception\n\nMike Rogers Voted Against Including An Exception For Health Of The Mother. In June 2003, Mike Rogers voted against an amendment to HR 760, the “Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003,” proposed by James Greenwood. The amendment would, according to the New York Sun, “include an exemption for a woman's health and at the same time focus more on banning late-term abortions, rather than the partial birth abortion procedure.” The amendment was rejected on a 133-287 vote. [Congress.gov, Amdt 154 to H.R. 760, 6/4/03; Roll Call Vote 240; New York Sun, 6/4/03]\n\n¶ TRAP Laws\n\n¶ 1999: Mike Rogers Voted To Require State Inspection And Licensing Of Abortion Clinics\n\n1999: Mike Rogers Voted To Require State Inspection And Licensing Of Abortion Clinics. In December 1999, Mike Rogers voted for House Bill 4599. The legislation would, according to the Associated Press, “call for state inspection and licensing of medical offices where abortions make up at lease half the operations performed.” The legislation passed the Michigan House on a 69-34 vote. It then passed the Michigan Senate on a 26-12 vote. The legislation was signed by Governor John Engler ad became law. [Michigan Legislature, House Bill 4599, 12/7/99; Associated Press, 12/7/99]\n\nUnder The Legislation, Medical Offices Where Abortions Are At Least Half Of The Procedures Performed Would Be Subject To State Inspections And Licensing. According to the Associated Press, “Medical offices where abortions are at least half of the procedures performed would be subject to state inspections and licensing under a bill approved by the state House Thursday. Supporters of the bill, which passed 69-34, say they are trying to ensure women's safety, while pro-choice groups say it is an attempt to burden abortion providers with unnecessary requirements. Judy Karandjeff, public affairs director for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, said the licensing standards have no medical justification. One example she gave is that an anesthesiologist must be on staff, but no anesthesia is used during abortions. ‘Outpatient surgeries of all types - those with or without anesthesia - are performed by dentists, plastic surgeons, podiatrists, etcetera, in physicians' offices, and none are required to meet these new standards,’ she said. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Terry Geiger, R-Lake Odessa, said abortion providers oppose the bill because compliance will cost money.” [Associated Press, 9/23/99]\n\n¶ Insurance Coverage\n\n¶ 2000: Mike Rogers Voted To Ban Abortion Coverage In Basic Health Plans And To Require Employers Buy Supplemental Coverage If They Wanted To Include Abortion In Health Plans\n\n2000: Mike Rogers Voted To Prohibit Abortion Coverage Unless An Option Rider Was Purchased By An Employer. In December 2000, Mike Rogers voted for Senate Bill 0645, Senate Bill 0794, and House Bill 4828. The package of legislation would, according to the House Legislative Agency, “amend a health-insurance related statute to specify that group and nongroup policies, certificates, or contracts could not provide coverage for elective abortions except by an optional rider for which an additional premium had been paid by the purchaser… The bills would allow an employer to purchase an optional rider for elective abortion coverage if 1) the cost of the rider was not factored into any premium amount for which individual employees contributed a portion of the premium paid either directly or through a payroll deduction; and 2) the employer provided notice to each employee that elective abortion was to be provided as a rider and that the coverage could be used by a minor or a dependent female without notice to the employee.” All three pieces of legislation passed both the Michigan House and Michigan Senate, but were vetoed by Governor John Engler. [Michigan Legislature, Senate Bill 0645, 12/7/00; Senate Bill 0794, 12/7/00; House Bill 4828, 12/14/00; Michigan House Legislative Agency, 1/3/01]\n\nLegislation Would Ban Abortion Coverage In Basic Health Plans And Require That Employers Buy Supplemental Coverage If They Wanted Abortions Included In Their Health Plans. According to the Associated Press, “Under current law, abortions are included in many basic health plans unless employers ask to have them removed. The vetoed bills would have banned abortion coverage in basic health plans and required that employers buy supplemental coverage if they wanted abortions included in their health plans. Opponents of the bills, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said they would violate privacy because women would have to ask for the supplemental coverage if they wanted an abortion. Opponents also said the bills would force insurers to refuse coverage for a legal medical practice.” [Associated Press, 1/9/01]\n\nUnder The Legislation, Health Maintenance Organizations And Insurers Would Provide “Elective Abortion” Coverage Only If The Beneficiary Has Previously Selected And Paid For Abortion Coverage. According to the South Bend Tribune, “Under the proposal, health maintenance organizations and insurers would provide ‘elective abortion’ coverage only if the beneficiary has previously selected and paid for abortion coverage. ‘Elective abortion’ does not include contraceptives or situations when a licensed physician determines that the termination of a pregnancy is crucial to the health or life of a woman. ‘The bills presume that a person might have a use for an abortion, and most people don't plan to have an abortion. That puts an unfair burden on the employee. It's certainly an invasion of privacy and unfair to women,’ said Rep. Irma Clark, D-Wayne, a critic of the measures.” [South Bend Tribune, 12/3/00]\n\nUnder The Proposed Bills, Insured Individuals Or Their Employers Would Have To Pay The Premium For Abortion Coverage. According to the South Bend Tribune, “Under the proposed bills, insured individuals or their employers would have to pay the premium for abortion coverage. Mary Pollack, chair of the legislative committee of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, calls the proposal a burden on employers and women. ‘These bills burden a woman's right to choose and are intended to discourage women from their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy,’ Pollack said. ‘Do you want to require employers to have this discussion with their employees? ‘These bills are a personal and medical invasion of privacy. The bills use government regulation of insurance companies to favor religious viewpoints,’ she said.” [South Bend Tribune, 12/3/00]\n\nUnder The Legislation, Employers Would Not Be Allowed To Pass The Additional Costs Of Supplemental Abortion Coverage On To Their Employees. According to the Associated Press, “Employers would have to pay more to offer abortion coverage as part of their health benefits under legislation approved Tuesday by the state House. The bill, approved 63-35 with 11 members not voting, would change the situation currently facing employers who offer benefits. Now, employers must request that abortion coverage be removed from their basic health plans. Employers would have to pay more to offer supplemental abortion coverage for their employees because it would be on top of the cost of their health benefits. Employers would not be allowed to pass the additional costs of supplemental abortion coverage on to their employees under the legislation.” [Associated Press, 12/5/00]\n\nLegislation Did Not Include Exceptions For Rape, Incest, Or Health Of A Mother. According to the South Bend Tribune, “Planned Parenthood associates of Michigan representative Judy Karandjeff said several issues still needed to be addressed. For example, she said 90 percent of Americans support contraceptive methods, yet fewer than 20 percent of insurance plans incorporate contraceptive coverage. Planned Parenthood is a national pro-choice organization. ‘In addition, these bills don't recognize exceptions for rape, incest or health of a mother,’ Karandjeff said.” [South Bend Tribune, 12/3/00]\n\n¶ 2009: Mike Rogers Voted To Prohibit Federal Funding For Abortion In New Insurance Programs\n\n2009: Mike Rogers Voted To Ban Coverage On Any Insurance Plan Paid With Federal Subsidies. In November 2009, Mike Rogers voted for an amendment to HR 3962, the “Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010,” proposed by Bart Stupak. The amendment would, according to Congressional Quarterly, prohibit “the use of federal funds authorized in the bill to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the pregnant woman. The amendment also would prohibit federal funds for abortion services in the public option. It would prohibit individuals who receive affordability credits from purchasing a plan that covers elective abortions. Individuals could separately purchase with their own funds plans that cover abortions.” The amendment was approved on a 240-194 vote.

In May 2010, Mike Rogers co-sponsored HR 5111, dubbed the “Protect Life Act.” The legislation would, according to a Joseph Pitts press release, amend “the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to prevent federal funding for abortion or abortion coverage through government exchanges, community health centers, or any other program funded or created by PPACA. Additionally, the bill protects the right of conscience for health care professionals and ensures that private insurance companies are not forced to cover abortion.” The legislation was introduced, but no other action was taken.

In October 2011, Mike Rogers voted for HR 358, dubbed the “Protect Life Act.” The legislation would, according to the Associated Press, bar “an insurance plan regulated under the new law from covering abortion if any of its customers receive federal subsidies. Providers that offer abortion coverage would have to set up identical plans without abortion coverage to participate in the health insurance exchanges to be set up under the new law.” The legislation passed the House on a 251-172 vote.

In January 2014, Mike Rogers voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have “permanently prohibit[ed] the use of federal funds, facilities or staff to provide abortion coverage and services, except in cases of rape or incest and for saving the life of the mother.” The House passed by a vote of 227 to 188; the bill died in the Senate.

According to Congressional Quarterly, “The Rules Committee expects to make in order a version of the bill that has been modified from the measure as reported by the Judiciary Committee. (Among the changes, it drops committee-reported tax provisions that would prevent an individual from deducting any abortion expenses as a tax-eligible medical expense or using pre-tax flex health or health savings accounts for abortion expenses.)” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\nBill Applied Prohibition To District Of Columbia Spending From Local Funds. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The bill prohibits the District of Columbia from using either federal funds or its own local funds to directly provide abortions, pay for abortion services or purchase any insurance plan that covers abortions. Specifically, it prevents D.C. from using federal funds for those purposes and includes the District of Columbia in the definition of the term ‘federal government’ — thereby prohibiting D.C. from using its own local funds for those purposes.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\nBill Prohibited Individuals And Small Businesses From Using Affordable Care Act Subsidies To Purchase A Health Insurance Plan That Covers Abortion. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The bill prohibits individuals and small businesses from receiving federal subsidies and tax credits under the 2010 health care overhaul (PL 111-148; PL 111-152) to purchase qualified health care plans that cover abortions. […] Specifically, the measure prohibits individuals from receiving a refundable federal tax credit, or any cost-sharing reductions, for purchasing a qualified health plan that includes coverage for abortions. […] It also prohibits small employers from receiving the small-employer health insurance credit provided by the health care law if the health plans or benefits that are purchased provide abortion coverage.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\nBill Exempted Rape, Incest, “Physical” Threats To A Woman’s Life, And Treatment Of Complications Arising From An Abortion. According to Congressional Quarterly, “These abortion funding prohibitions would not apply for pregnancies that occur as the result of rape or incest, or if the woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury or physical illness that would result in death unless an abortion is performed. They also would not apply with regard to funding for the treatment of complications or other disorders that are caused or exacerbated by an abortion. […] For both individuals and small employers, the prohibition [on ACA subsidy usage] would not apply to health policies that provide abortion coverage only for cases of rape or incest, for physical disorders that a physician certifies would place a woman in danger unless the abortion is performed, or for treatment of any disorder that has been caused or exacerbated by an abortion.” The bill, as effectively modified by the House Rules Committee, does not use the term “forcible rape.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14; Rules Committee Print 113-33, 1/22/14]\n\nBill Stated That Individuals, Companies And State And Local Governments May Still Purchase Health Insurance Plans That Cover Abortion Or Separate Abortion Coverage If They Don’t Use Any Federal Funds. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The measure states that nothing in it should be construed as prohibiting any individual, entity, state or locality from purchasing separate health insurance coverage that includes abortion — or restricting the ability of any non-federal health insurance coverage provider from offering abortion coverage — as long as the coverage is entirely paid for with non-federal funds. Such extra coverage, however, could not be purchased using funds that a state also counts as matching funds for a federally funded program. […] The bill states that the restriction [on use of ACA subsidies] should not be construed as prohibiting any individual from purchasing separate coverage for abortions, or a health plan that includes abortions, as long as no credit is allowed with respect to the premiums for such coverage. For small employers, it is not to be construed as prohibiting any employer from purchasing separate coverage for abortions or restricting any non-federal health insurance issuer from offering such a plan, as long as it is not paid for with any employer contribution eligible for the credit.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\nOpponents Argued Bill Would Undermine Women’s Rights More Broadly, By Discouraging Private Health Insurance Coverage Plans From Including Abortion Coverage, Thus Forcing Women To Ask For – And Pay More For – Separate Abortion Coverage. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Opponents of the bill, primarily Democrats, argue that it constitutes yet another attack on women’s rights that could undermine access to abortion. The bill, they say, goes far beyond prohibiting taxpayer-funded abortions and could drive insurance companies away from providing abortion coverage as a basic element of health insurance policies. Everyone agrees that we want to reduce abortions, but the bill goes about it the wrong way, they say, discouraging insurers from including abortion coverage in comprehensive health care policies and erecting new hurdles for women by making them seek out and pay more to buy a separate policy that covers abortion.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\nOpponents Pointed To Bill’s Lack Of A Health Exception For Non-Life Threatening Conditions. According to Congressional Quarterly, “They also argue that the bill contains no exceptions to protect a woman’s health in non-life-threatening situations, providing no support in the case of pregnancies that might threaten future fertility or worsen a chronic health condition such as heart disease, as well as providing no protections in the case of a terminal fetal anomaly. Abortion, they say, is a constitutionally protected right and a basic health care service, and Americans want to see Congress work to create jobs and fix our crumbling national infrastructure, not launch more anti-woman crusades.” [Congressional Quarterly, 1/27/14]\n\n¶ Reporting Requirements\n\n¶ 1999: Mike Rogers Voted To Require Abortion providers Report All Complications To The State\n\n1999: Mike Rogers Voted To Require Abortion Providers To Report Complications To The State. In December 1999, Mike Rogers voted for House Bill 4600 and House Bill 4601. The legislation would, according to the Associated Press, “require providers to report all complications and fetal genetic and diagnostic testing to the state.” Both pieces of legislation were signed into law. [Michigan Legislature, House Bill 4600, 12/7/99; House Bill 4601, 12/7/99; Associated Press, 9/23/99]\n\nUnder The Legislation, Abortion Providers Would Have To Report Complications And Fetal Testing To The State. According to the Associated Press, “Abortion providers would have to report complications and fetal testing to the state under legislation passed Wednesday by the state House. Seventy-two of the 110 members voted to require that providers report complications between 30 and 60 days after an abortion is performed and disclose genetic and diagnostic testing done on the fetus. ‘The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has established itself as protectors of unborn children and promoters of women's health,’ said House Speaker Chuck Perricone, R-Kalamazoo Township.” [Associated Press, 9/22/99]\n\nProviders Were Already Required To Report Complications Within Seven Days. According to the Associated Press, “Abortion Judy Karandjeff, public affairs director for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, said providers already must report complications within seven days. She said supporters of the legislation are just trying to compile information that would scare women seeking abortions without any medical basis. ‘There is no reason for the state to know that information,’ she said.” [Associated Press, 9/22/99]\n\nLegislation Would Extend The Reporting Time To Between 30 And 60 Days From The Date Of The Procedure, And Would Require Physicians To List Any Information Including Any Type Of Diagnostic Or Genetic Testing Or Screening Related To The Health Of The Fetus And Woman Before The Abortion. According to The State News, “Bisbee and O'Neil's legislation requires physicians to report complications arising from abortion procedures to the Michigan Department of Community Health and to a local health department. The public health code requires abortion practitioners to report certain information to the department within seven days of the procedure. Bisbee's bill would extend the reporting time to between 30 and 60 days from the date of the procedure and help prospective patients learn if problems exist at the clinic before they receive an abortion. The bill would also make physicians list any information including any type of diagnostic or genetic testing or screening related to the health of the fetus and woman before the abortion. Even though more information is given to the health department, Bisbee said privacy will not be sacrificed. ‘The measure guarantees availability of crucial information on medical personnel, records and facilities without compromising anyone's privacy,’ Bisbee said.” [The State News, 9/27/99]\n\nLegislation Would Require Physicians To File A Written Report With Local Health Departments When A Patient Suffers A Physical Complication Or Death From An Abortion. According to The State News, “O'Neil's bill would require physicians to file a written report with local health departments when a patient suffers a physical complication or death from an abortion. There is no definite date as to when the bills will be voted on in the Senate yet.” [The State News, 9/27/99]\n\n¶ Informed Consent\n\n¶ 2000: Mike Rogers Voted To Tigthen Regulation Of Michigan’s Informed Consent Law\n\n2000: Mike Rogers Voted To Restrict Women Seeking Abortions To Obtain Information From The State Web Site And To Require Doctors To Provide A Physical Copy Of The Information About The Abortion Procedure. In November 2000, Mike Rogers voted for House Bill 5548. The legislation would, according to the Associated Press, “require abortion clinics to provide women with a physical copy of the required information. It also would ban clinics from requiring a non-refundable down payment from women to secure their abortion appointment before they review the 24-hour materials.” The legislation passed the Michigan Senate on a 27-9 vote. The legislation then passed the Michigan House on a 68-30 vote. The legislation was signed by Governor John Engler and became law. [Michigan Legislature, House Bill 5548, 11/29/00; Associated Press, 4/13/00]\n\nUnder The Legislation, Women Would Be Restricted To Receiving Abortion Information From A State Web Site, And Abortion Clinics And Physicians Would Be Required To Provide Women With A Physical Copy Of Accurate Information About The Procedure. According to the Associated Press, “Women would be restricted to receiving abortion information from a state Web site under legislation approved Tuesday by the state House. Abortion clinics and physicians would be required to provide women with a physical copy of accurate information about the procedure, according to the bill that was approved 67-39 with four members abstaining. Republican Reps. Judith Scranton and Pan Godchaux joined House Democrats in voting against the bill that limits abortion information to the Department of Community Health's Web site, rather than from abortion providers' Internet sites. Michigan's Informed Consent law requires certain information be given to prospective abortion patients 24 hours before the procedure. A settlement reached in 1999, nearly six years after a court challenge, allowed that information to be transmitted on the Internet or by facsimile. Women can meet the 24-hour notice requirement by getting the information ahead of time from the state Web site under the bill. Women would have to get a printed confirmation form from the Web site saying they have read the information.” [Associated Press, 5/30/00]\n\nLegislation Would Require Abortion Clinics To Provide Women With A Physical Copy Of Required Information In Informed Consent Law. According to the Associated Press, “A legislator who says some abortion clinics in Michigan are distributing inaccurate information has introduced a bill she says would close loopholes in the state's 24-hour informed consent abortion law. Rep. Janet Kukuk, R-Macomb, said some clinics are ignoring the new requirements in the Women's Right to Know Act that went into effect last fall after five years of litigation. The law requires women to receive information about what abortion procedure they will have, the doctor's name, line drawings of the gestational age of the fetus and information on other options such as adoption. Some abortion clinics are advertising ‘no waiting period’ abortion services with Web site content, Kukuk said. A few clinics also are posting misleading pictures of developing babies on their Web sites, Kukuk said. Kukuk's bill would require abortion clinics to provide women with a physical copy of the required information. It also would ban clinics from requiring a non-refundable down payment from women to secure their abortion appointment before they review the 24-hour materials.” [Associated Press, 4/13/00]\n\nLegislation Would Prohibit Abortion Clinics From Collecting Any Payments Until After The 24-Hour Waiting Period. According to the Associated Press, “‘The intent is clearly to pressure women financially into deciding in favor of abortion before they've even had a chance to review their options,’ Kukuk said. ‘There can be no real choice once the woman is financially invested in having an abortion.’ The measure prohibits abortion clinics from collecting any payments until after the 24-hour waiting period. Kukuk said she is developing provisions in the legislation that would include punishments for clinics that violate its requirements. Right to Life of Michigan said it strongly supports Kukuk's legislation. The abortion waiting period legislation is House Bill 5548.” [Associated Press, 4/13/00]\n\nLegislation Would Require Women Who Want Abortions To Get The Information And Consent Forms From The Department Of Community Health’s Web Site, Rather Than From Abortion Providers’ Internet Sites. According to the Associated Press, “Women would be able to get abortion information from a state Web site under legislation approved Tuesday by a state House committee. The bill would require women who want abortions to get the information and consent forms from the Department of Community Health's Web site, rather than from abortion providers' Internet sites. Rep. Janet Kukuk, R-Macomb, sponsored the bill because she said some abortion clinics provided inaccurate information. A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan said the bill adds new barriers for women trying to get an abortion and has the potential to breach their confidentiality.

The bill passed 252 to 172, with 53 Democrats and one independent joining 198 Republicans in backing a proposal that supporters said would help prosecutors combat the growing problem of violence against pregnant women.

The amendment would, according to the Times Union, “make it a federal crime to assault a pregnant woman and establish penalties for causing a prenatal injury or termination of the pregnancy in addition to the penalties imposed for the assault to the mother.

One of the newest and most deceptive of these, the egregiously mislabeled Child Custody Protection Act, won easy approval in the House on Wednesday.

To that end, it would make it a crime for anyone other than a parent to accompany a minor seeking an abortion across state lines -- if the minor has not met her home state's requirements for parental consent.

Anyone who helps the minor in the absence of judicial authorization without first informing her parent or legal guardian -- and that includes grandparents, older siblings and clergy -- would be subject to criminal and civil penalties that include up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. Under threat of criminal and civil penalties, doctors also would be forced to comply with a burdensome legal regimen involving the interaction of varying state laws and those of the provider's home state.'

In December 2006, Mike Rogers voted to suspend the rules and pass HR 6099, dubbed the ‘Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act of 2006.’ The legislation would, according to the Washington Post, 'require abortion providers to tell a woman whose pregnancy is 20 weeks past fertilization that ‘there is substantial evidence’ the fetus will feel pain during the procedure - a point debated by physicians. The woman would then have to sign a form accepting or declining anesthesia for her fetus.

In June 2011, Mike Rogers voted for an amendment to the 2012 agriculture appropriations bill which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, “bar the use of funds in the bill for the abortion drug mifepristone, also known as RU-486.” The House passed the amendment by a vote of 240 by 176.

According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Steve King, (R-IA) said, “I am very concerned about the robo distribution of abortion pills in Iowa or anywhere else. […] Their response came back in the affirmative, that they had issued several grants to Planned Parenthood; and these funds, as near as we can determine, are being used to provide telemedicine for the robo abortions, robo Skype abortions as I’ve described. This amendment provides that none of the funds made available in this $15 million telemedicine line item that’s in this appropriations bill shall be used for the purpose of purchasing, prescribing, dispensing, procuring, or otherwise administering mifepristone, commonly known as RU-486.” [Congressional Record, 6/16/11]\n\nOpponents Said That Barring Funding For RU-486 Was Unnecessary And Was Aimed At Changing Policy Around A Woman’s Right To Choose. According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) said, “I think what the gentleman is going to talk about is a legal drug in the United States. It’s been a legitimate drug in the United States after it met all of the rigorous FDA process in 1996 and has been available since 2000 in this country. I remember vigorous debates in this committee about the conditionality by which FDA would license this drug. It is legal and available in all 50 States in the United States, in Washington, DC, in Guam, and in Puerto Rico. It’s a prescription drug which is not available to the public through pharmacies. Instead, its distribution is restricted to specifically qualified licensed physicians. To use it, a woman must go to a doctor’s office. Whatever controversy surrounded the introduction of RU-486 in the United States was settled years ago, and there’s no reason for this amendment other than to stir up the controversy over the reproductive rights of women. I think by the gentleman’s comments, you can see that that’s what he’s trying to do. I would urge us all to oppose this amendment. And frankly it doesn’t have anything to do with USDA funds, because we don’t do telemedicine abortions.” [Congressional Record, 6/15/11]\n\n¶ Military Bases\n\n¶ Mike Rogers Voted Five Times Against Allowing Service Members And Their Relatives To Obtain Abortions At Military Hospitals, Even That They Pay For Themselves\n\n2002: Mike Rogers Voted Against Allow Service Members Stationed Overseas To Obtain Abortions At Local Military Hospitals Provided They Pay For The Procedure.

In May 2011, Mike Rogers voted for a bill, which, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have “prohibit[ed] federal funding for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman’s life is endangered. It would [have] modif[ied] tax breaks given for health insurance coverage to exclude coverage for abortion, prohibit[ed] federal medical facilities from providing abortion services.” The House passed the bill with a vote of 251 to 175.

According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill “establish[ed] ‘conscience protections’ for health care providers who object to providing abortion services.” [Congressional Quarterly, 5/4/11]\n\nThe Obama Administration Said That Federal Funds Already Could Not Be Used For Abortions, And That This Proposal Restricted Women’s Reproductive Freedoms And Private Insurance Options. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The Obama administration has already threatened to veto the House legislation and released a policy statement May 2 that said the bill ‘unnecessarily restricts women’s reproductive freedoms and consumers’ private insurance options.’ The administration argued that it is longstanding federal policy to bar federal funds from being used for abortions, a prohibition which is maintained through the 2010 health care overhaul and the president’s executive order on the issue.” [Congressional Quarterly, 5/4/11]\n\nSupporters Said That Prohibiting Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Was In Line With Popular Opinion. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Supporters of the legislation, however, argued that it is in keeping with public opinion, with polling showing that significant majorities believe that taxpayer funding should not be used for abortions. ‘America has changed,’ Smith said. ‘By ever increasing majorities, especially among our young people, the megatrend is to protect the child in the womb.’ The bill essentially codifies the ‘Hyde Amendment,’ which has been attached to federal appropriations bills since 1976 and prohibits certain appropriated federal funds from being used for abortion services except in special cases. The bill also would establish ‘conscience protections’ for health care providers who object to providing abortion services.” [Congressional Quarterly, 5/4/11]\n\n¶ 20-Week Abortion Ban\n\n¶ 2012: Mike Rogers Voted For An Abortion Ban In Washington D.C. 20 Weeks After Fertilization, With No Exception For Cases Of Rape Or Incest\n\n2012: Mike Rogers Voted To Ban Abortion In Washington D.C. 20 Weeks After Fertilization, With No Exception For Cases Of Rape Or Incest. In July 2012, Mike Rogers voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have “ban[ned] all abortions in the District of Columbia in cases where the probable post-fertilization age of the fetus in question is 20 weeks — providing an exception only in cases where the life of the woman is in danger. Any abortion performed under this exception must provide the fetus the ‘best opportunity to survive,’ unless termination in that manner would result in the death or substantial and irreversible harm to the woman.” In addition, the bill would have “impose[d] reporting requirements for any abortions performed prior to the 20-week threshold. The measure imposes criminal penalties on medical professionals who violate the ban, and it provides legal standing for an affected party to seek punitive damages. […] The measure prohibits the prosecution of the woman obtaining the abortion, however either as the perpetrator or as a conspirator to violate the ban.” The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, which required a two-thirds majority to pass; the House rejected the motion by a vote of 220 to 154. [House Vote 539, 7/31/12; Congressional Quarterly, 7/30/12; Congressional Actions, H.R. 3803]\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor Said There Is Scientific Evidence That Fetus Could Feel Pain At Least 20 Weeks After Fertilization And “The Ability To Experience Pain Is One Of The Traits That Makes Us Human.” According to the Congressional Record, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said, “It is simply unfathomable that, other than by the methods banned by federal law, the District of Columbia allows abortion for any reason, by any method up until the moment right before birth. While people may differ on the issue of abortion, Americans overwhelmingly support the notion that abortions should be restricted at the point at which an unborn child can feel pain. And with good reason, the ability to experience pain is one of the traits that makes us human. And the commitment to protect the defenseless from physical acts of violence is one of the hallmarks of humanity. Science demonstrates that by at least 20 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child can feel pain.” [Congressional Record, 7/31/12]\n\nOpponents Said “Dangerous” Bill Lacked Exceptions For Cases Of Rape Or Incest, And Was Part Of A GOP Strategy To Ban Abortion Nationwide. According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Rush Holt (N-NJ) said, “Besides being misguided and offensive, H.R. 3803 is dangerous. This bill has only a narrow exception for the life of the woman. This bill has no exception at all for cases of rape or incest. It is clear that this legislation is part of a broader strategy to ban abortion everywhere not just in the District of Columbia. I oppose this anti-choice, anti-woman, and anti-District of Columbia bill and urge my colleagues to vote no on this dangerous piece of legislation.” [Congressional Record, 7/31/12]\n\n¶ 2013: Mike Rogers Voted For A 20-Week Abortion Ban\n\n2013: Mike Rogers Voted For Banning Abortion After 20 Weeks After Conception. In June 2013, Mike Rogers voted for a bill banning most abortion across the country twenty weeks after conception. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Passage of the bill that would create a nationwide ban on abortions performed at 20 weeks or later, except in cases where the life of the woman is in danger. It would provide exceptions to the ban in cases of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest against a minor, if it has been reported to law enforcement or a government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse. It also would impose criminal penalties on physicians who violate the ban and subject violators to a maximum five-year jail sentence, fines or both.” The House approved the bill by a vote of 228 to 196. The bill died in the Senate.

According to the Associated Press, \"According to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights, in 2009, 1.3 percent of the 1.2 million abortions in the country, about 15,600, occurred 20 weeks after the fetus was conceived.” [Associated Press, 6/18/13]\n\n10 States Had Already Enacted Similar Bans, Part Of Broader Legal Strategy To Get Supreme Court To Reconsider Roe v. Wade. According to the Associated Press, “[The bill] mirrors 20-week abortion ban laws passed by some states, and lays further groundwork for the ongoing legal battle that abortion foes hope will eventually result in forcing the Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that made abortion legal. [. . .] Some 10 states have passed laws similar to the House bill, and several are facing court challenges. Last month a federal court struck down as unconstitutional Arizona's law, which differs slightly in banning abortion 20 weeks after pregnancy rather than conception.” [Associated Press, 6/18/13]\n\nDuring Committee Hearing On Bill, Its Primary Author Claimed Rape Resulted In Few Pregnancies. According to Politico, “A House Republican pushing for a 20-week nationwide ban on abortions said Wednesday that the incidence of pregnancies resulting from rape is ‘very low’ — then scrambled to clarify his comment after it went viral with comparisons to former GOP Senate candidate Todd Akin. ‘The incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,’ said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) as the House Judiciary Committee debated his bill to ban abortions nationwide after 20 weeks including in cases of rape and incest. After the committee meeting, Franks told POLITICO: ‘My bill does nothing to restrict abortion even before the first five months, so all issues related to rape are long since dealt with.’ He said that Democrats are the ones who ‘constantly want to inject’ rape into the abortion debate and have done so ever since the original Roe v Wade case.” [Politico, 6/12/13]\n\nAfter Uproar Over Franks’ Comments, Bill Revised To Include Exceptions For Rape And Incest And Assigned New Floor Manager. According to Politico, “Rep. Trent Franks’s (R-Ariz.) bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide now includes an exception for rape and incest after his remarks about rape and pregnancy created an uproar. And it’s not Franks’s bill anymore — or more precisely, he won’t be managing his own bill when it goes to the House floor Tuesday. He’s being replaced with a high-profile House GOP woman. A spokesman for Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) confirmed Friday to POLITICO that she’ll be managing the debate, and that the bill is being changed to include the new exception.” [Politico, 6/14/13]\n\nBill Included Exceptions For Rape, Incest, And The Life Of The Mother, But Not Other Health Exceptions. According to the Associated Press, “Republicans quietly altered the bill to include an exception to the 20-week ban for instances of rape and incest. Democrats still balked, saying the exception would require a woman to prove that she had reported the rape to authorities. The bill has an exception when a physical condition threatens the life of the mother, but Democratic efforts to include other health exceptions were rebuffed. The legislation would ban abortions that take place 20 weeks after conception, which is equivalent to 22 weeks of pregnancy.” [Associated Press, 6/18/13]\n\nRape Exception Required Women To Prove That They Had Reported Rape To Authorities, Which Is Not Required In Rape Exceptions In Other Federal Abortion Laws. According to Mother Jones, “But it does contain a provision that redefines rape exemptions, significantly limiting the number of women who would qualify. In order to obtain an abortion after 20 weeks under this law, a woman who was raped must be able to prove that she reported the rape to authorities—a requirement not present in other rape exceptions to federal abortion laws. [. . .] It is more restrictive than the Hyde Amendment, the law barring federal funds from being used to pay for abortions. Hyde specifically exempts cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at stake—with no requirement that women have documentation from police that they reported the crime.” [Mother Jones, 6/18/13]\n\nLess Than Half Of All Rapes Are Reported To Police Due To Fear Of Violence, Concerns About Legal System, And Shame. According to Mother Jones, “According to numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, less than half of all rapes or sexual assaults are reported to the police (the bureau's latest report actually found that the percentage reported to police has declined in recent years—from 56 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in 2010). Democrats pointed out that fear of violence, concerns about dealing with the legal system, and shame may prevent many women from reporting rape. ‘They leave out even Hyde exceptions for rape and incest, and then they try to shove it back in, but they do it with this crazy requirement that rape victims prove that they reported the rapes, only underscoring the point we’ve been making all this time which is that they really have no respect for women,’ Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) told Mother Jones on Tuesday” [Mother Jones, 6/18/13]\n\nSupporters Of Ban Argued That Fetuses Can Feel Pain At 20 Weeks Post-Conception And Abortion Should Therefore Be Banned From That Point On. According to The New York Times, “It is a new frontier of the anti-abortion movement: laws banning abortion at 20 weeks after conception, contending that fetuses can feel pain then. [. . .] The science of fetal pain is highly complex. Most scientists who have expressed views on the issue have said they believe that if fetuses can feel pain, the neurological wiring is not in place until later, after the time when nearly all abortions occur. Several scientists have done research that abortion opponents say shows that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks after conception. [. . .] Supporters of fetal-pain laws also say that surgeons’ use of anesthesia and painkillers when operating on fetuses in the womb proves fetuses feel pain. ‘If the child who is waiting for surgery can feel pain, the child who is waiting for abortion can also feel pain,’ said Mary Spaulding Balch, the National Right to Life Committee’s state policy director, who pioneered fetal-pain laws. She does not advocate performing abortions with anesthesia or painkillers ‘to have a painless death,’ but rather wants those abortions prevented because a ‘member of the human family has reached a point where they are capable of feeling pain.’” [New York Times, 9/17/13]\n\nConcerned Women For America President: Bill Is “The Most Important Pro-Life Bill” Considered By Congress In Past 10 Years. According to the Associated Press, “But it was a banner day for social conservatives who have generally seen their priorities overshadowed by economic and budgetary issues since Republicans recaptured the House in 2010.
