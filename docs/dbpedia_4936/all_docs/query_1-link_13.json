        "text": "EAST LANSING — Michigan State University trustees apologized but remained firm Friday, saying they will not release more than 6,000 documents connected to disgraced and convicted Dr. Larry Nassar as requested by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.\n\n\"We will maintain attorney client privilege,\" Board Chair Rema Vassar said. \"This might not be what you want to hear. I’m sure it's not. On behalf of the board, please know I’m sorry.\n\n\"We will continue to devote time and resources to a healing culture. We are committed to treating you with the respect and care you deserve. I apologize personally and on behalf of this board.\"\n\nTrustee Dennis Denno also offered an apology.\n\n\"To the Nassar survivors, parents and families, the only thing I can say is I’m sorry that a great university, at times, can be really shitty,\" he said. \"I don’t know what else to say.\"\n\nUniversity leaders were responding to critics as well as Nessel's renewed call earlier this month to release several thousand documents related to the investigation of Nassar, documents the school uncovered during an investigation but has withheld for years.\n\nA group advocating for sexual violence survivors urged trustees to release the documents.\n\n\"It’s now 2023 and this university is still providing cover for a pedophile. It's an institutional betrayal that has been absolutely breathtaking,\" POSSE member Valerie von Frank told trustees Friday.\n\nVassar said another reason not to release the documents is to avoid retraumatizing victims.\n\nFollowing the meeting, von Frank and two other parents said they don't believe that's a valid reason and it's more likely that material embarrassing for the university is in the unreleased documents.\n\nThe university is still in litigation with one insurance company. Claims against other insurers have been settled.\n\nVassar said she could not say whether the university would release the remaining materials once that litigation is complete.\n\n\"The release of attorney client privilege is generally not done with any documents ever,\" she said.\n\nTed Golden, via Zoom, drew parallels Friday between his bladder cancer, which he attributed to exposure to toxic water at a Navy base 60 years ago, and the university's handling of the Nassar crisis.\n\n\"No one was held accountable for 30-year period,\" he said about Nassar and the university.\n\nIn an April 14 letter, Nessel called on the board to release all remaining documents related to the investigation of Nassar, a former MSU and USA Gymnastics doctor who sexually abused hundreds of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. The composition of the board had changed substantially since her last request, including Vassar's installation as chair.\n\nIn a statement following the meeting, Nessel’s office criticized the lack of action.\n\n“It’s a disappointing outcome from the new board,” Nessel said in the statement. ”With new leadership and new members, we expected more from the Board of Trustees, and hoped they were as dedicated to accountability and transparency for their student-victims.”\n\nNessel called on the board for the full and unredacted release of “the remaining documents our office requested and to fulfill its stated pledge to continue cooperating with the investigation through its conclusion,” according to the press release.\n\n“We remain committed as ever to pursuing justice for the many survivors of Larry Nassar’s violence at the University, and I hope the newly comprised board shares that commitment with us more meaningfully than their predecessors,” Nessel said in the press release. “This is a pursuit we are determined to see through until the standards of investigation and justice are met.\"\n\nMSU asked former Attorney General Bill Schuette to investigate the school's response several years ago. Nessel told the State Journal last year she believes the documents contain information the university wants to keep hidden.\n\n“I can’t come up with any other explanation, honestly,” Nessel said. “(We were) well-intentioned, public servants who only wanted to get to the heart of, you know, how this happened and why this happened and to ensure that it never happens again. … This is a stain on Michigan State University that will never be removed.”\n\nVassar, Denno and Trustee Dianne Byrum did not respond to messages from the State Journal in recent days prior to Friday's session.\n\nOver the course of seven months in 2018, East Lansing District Court Judge Richard Ball, at the request of MSU, inspected 6,492 emails, texts and documents MSU had classified as privileged. He determined 177 of the documents should not be privileged, according to court records. He ordered those be turned over to the AG’s office. MSU objected to 29 of those and ultimately released 13 of the 177.\n\nAn MSU attorney noted during a March 2019 hearing that Ball had previously described some of the documents as “innocuous” and said the university wasn’t hiding “smoking guns.” Ball agreed with these statements.\n\nBut Ball also said multiple times during the same hearing that he was not reviewing the documents for facts that had not been disclosed to the AG’s office. He purely was reviewing the documents to see if they were correctly classified as privileged, he said.\n\nWith Nassar in prison and the legal settlement agreed to, survivors, the Attorney General and others want to learn more about how Nassar and his crimes were not stopped for two decades and they want to see if the unreleased documents have any answers.\n\nNessel closed the MSU investigation in March 2021. This came after the Board of Trustees refused to release the documents for three years. Former AG Bill Schuette's office made the original request to MSU for those documents when he began an investigation as Nassar was sentenced in Ingham and Eaton counties for sexual assault.\n\nNassar is serving an effective life sentence in prison because of sentences in federal and state courts.\n\nNassar survivors received a $500 million legal settlement from MSU. USA Gymnastics has also settled, and a claim against the FBI is pending. Nassar victims have made a $1 billion claim they brought against the federal government.\n\nContact Mark Johnson at majohnson2@lsj.com.
