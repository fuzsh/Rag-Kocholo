        "text": "Plans Moving Along With SIUE Construction Projects\n\nDespite challenges presented by the economic downturn, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville has progressed in its efforts to update existing structures, reallocate and create space to accommodate growth, and enhance infrastructure.\n\nSince 2006, SIUE has been in the process of investing nearly $300 million in campus construction projects. Some of these have included:\n\nThe $39.3 million, 190,000-square-foot residence hall, known as Evergreen Hall, which opened in fall 2007 and is home to 500 students each semester, offering a variety of \"green\" features.\n\nThe state-of-the-art $16.1 million Student Success Center building, which opened in fall 2009 and allowed for the centralization of academic and personal support services, optimizing the academic, service and social components of the student experience.\n\nA $9.1 million Student Fitness Center renovation and expansion project, which was completed in fall 2009 and included the addition of two multi-purpose rooms for exercise and student activities, a 30,500-square-feet gymnasium for court recreation, a food and juice bar, and an office addition.\n\n\"Each and every one of our projects is meant to improve services and enhance educational offerings for students, as well as support and encourage faculty in teaching and research opportunities at SIUE,\" said Rich Walker, assistant vice chancellor for administration. \"We are particularly proud of the fact that the majority of our projects are completed within the specified timeframe and under the projected budget.\"\n\nThe University isn't stopping with its current list of completed projects. It expects to introduce another round of projects during the next fiscal year. Future projects, some of which have begun, include:\n\nThe completion of the long-awaited new Science Building, expected in fall 2012, which is estimated to cost about $53 million.\n\nRenovation of the existing Science Building, which will be connected to the new facility, at an estimated cost of $30 million.\n\nA roughly $15.3 million Art & Design building addition and renovation. The addition will include approximately 29,000-square-feet of space for classrooms, offices and a gallery.\n\nThe projected $14.2 million expansion and renovation of the Engineering Building, which currently is underway and will include the construction of a new roughly 32,000-square-feet annex that will be connected to the existing building through an enclosed bridge.\n\nThe creation of the Vadalabene Center Lukas Athletics Annex at a projected cost of $4.5 million. A total of $4.2 million for the project was provided by a gift from the estate of Charles S. and Mary L. Lukas. The project will include the creation of approximately 29,100-square-feet of space for offices. A planned future project will involve the renovation of the vacated space for use for kinesiology and allied health education.\n\nThe Science Building projects are being funded through, and managed by, the Illinois' Capital Development Board. The enhanced Science Building facilities will further the University's standing as a premier Metropolitan University in the St. Louis area, as well as nationally, said SIUE Kenn Neher, vice chancellor for administration. He added, \"When these projects are complete, this will significantly enhance the student learning experience at SIUE. The University has a strong commitment to educating tomorrow's workforce for careers in science and health care professions that are currently experiencing workforce shortages.\"\n\nSIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift has said the lack of a new science building \"has been the single most important factor limiting future growth\" at the University.\n\nThree departments, including chemistry, biological sciences and environmental sciences, will move into the new structure upon its completion. Physics, mathematics and statistics will stay in the existing structure, which will be completely gutted and remodeled.\n\nA 2010 Economic Impact Study conducted by members of the SIUE School of Business faculty showed the University had a $471 million annual economic impact on the St. Louis Metropolitan Area. This reflects a 32-percent increase from a study released in 2005. It also reported that SIUE is the second largest employer in Madison and St. Clair counties, with nearly 2,500 full-time employees and a total yearly payroll of more than $130 million.\n\n\"The University has a strong commitment to enhancing the quality of life for our students, and we work closely with the community and the region to make that happen,\" Vandegrift said. \"Being good stewards of taxpayer dollars is critical to our continued success as an institution.\"\n\nOther projects that are part of the University's $300 million expenditures include improvements to the Environmental Resource Training Center, the Early Childhood Center, Korte Stadium, Cougar Village, the SIU School of Dental Medicine, the SIUE School of Pharmacy and the University Bookstore. Also, University signage and entrance-ways were enhanced to allow easier campus navigation, and landscaping, sidewalk and roadway improvements were made to ease traffic flow.\n\nSIUE Student Wins Prestigious Gilman Scholarship\n\nNext year, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville student Julian Glover will study and perform in one of the largest cities in Central Europe.\n\nGlover, 20, was one of 900 outstanding American undergraduate students from more than 380 colleges and universities who won the prestigious Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, which makes it possible to study abroad. Glover, who is working on a major in speech communications and a double minor in sociology and music, has a grade point average of 3.68.\n\n\"I was thrilled to know that I had won,\" said Glover, who will travel to Prague, where he will reside from January through May 2012.\n\nThe senior would not have been financially able to travel and study outside of the country if it were not for the Gilman Scholarship. Gilman Scholars receive up to $5,000 to apply toward their study abroad program costs.\n\nBut Glover said he expects the educational and cultural advantages to far outweigh the financial costs of the trip. After being immersed in another culture, the student said the most important lesson he hopes to receive is better and deeper appreciation for cultural diversity.\n\nLikewise, the Gilman Scholarship Program aims to diversify the kinds of students who study abroad and the countries and regions where they go. The program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by the Institute of International Education's (IIE) Southern Regional Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nYet another benefit of the trip will be to help Glover graduate. The student will complete his requirements for his minor in sociology while in Prague. Glover will also continue to play his cello, while attending the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague.\n\nThe International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000 established the scholarship and since that time, more than 6,500 students nationwide have received the award. Gilman, a U.S. congressman who retired in 2002 after serving 30 years in the House of Representatives and chairing the House Foreign Relations Committee, said: \"Studying abroad is a special experience for every student who participates.\n\n\"Living and learning in a vastly different environment of another nation not only exposes our students to alternate views, but also adds an enriching social and cultural experience,\" Gilman said. \"It also provides our students with the opportunity to return home with a deeper understanding of their place in the world, encouraging them to be a contributor, rather than a spectator in the international community.\"\n\nSIUE Supporter Donates Building To Campaign\n\nThe gift of a building valued at $817,000 from an ardent supporter will help Southern Illinois University Edwardsville as it continues its efforts to define excellence.\n\nDefining Excellence-the Campaign for SIUE is reaching its goal to raise $50 million by garnering alumni and community support. To date, nearly $30 million has been raised. The building, an existing structure located in SIUE's University Park, was made possible through the generosity of Ralph Korte, founder of the successful Korte Company of Highland, alumnus and longtime University advocate.\n\n\"I feel very good about my business degree from SIUE and without my degree, I don't think my company would be nearly as successful,\" said Korte, who earned his bachelor's from the School of Business in 1968 with a decade of hard work and night classes. \"I'm still heavily involved and I want to see the University achieve great things.\"\n\n\"My love for SIUE and my dedication to make it a better place prompted my decision. SIUE will be here for a long time after I'm gone. I hope my gift will help set an example for others to give.\"\n\nThe gift is the latest example of the support the University has received from outstanding alumni and members of the community. Dennis Terry, president of the SIUE Foundation, said \"Ralph Korte is a tremendous alumnus of SIUE, and he never goes anywhere without praising the University. This gift is but another addition to his legacy at SIUE.\"\n\n\"Ralph has been a great asset to SIUE, and he has given us so much support over the years,\" added Byron Farrell, chair of Defining Excellence-The Campaign for SIUE. \"As we move forward toward our goal of $50 million for the campaign, we hope that Ralph's continuing benevolence will encourage others to join us in this special endeavor for SIUE.\"\n\nSIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift acknowledged Korte's gift by noting that no graduate of SIUE has been more committed to the support of the University over the years. \"We couldn't be more proud of Ralph Korte and what he means to SIUE,\" said Vandegrift. The exact use of the building has not yet been determined, but it is expected to be use for economic development in the University Park.\n\nPublically launched in March, the major gifts campaign is about taking SIUE to a new level of prominence and performance.

I want to help motivate young people and speak positivity into their lives like educators and mentors did for me.\"\n\nLove, a native of East St. Louis, graduated as valedictorian in 2005 from the SIUE Charter High School. \"The Charter School staff was awesome,\" she said. \"They encouraged me to aim higher than I was aiming. And they continued to tell me that no matter where I came from I was a bright student with an even brighter future.\"\n\nLove enrolled at SIU Carbondale in fall 2005. She graduated cum laude with a 3.68 grade point average from the University, earning a bachelor of science in chemistry with a specialization in forensic chemistry.\n\nWhile at SIUC, Love received a host of awards and departmental scholarships, presented her academic research at several national and regional conferences, published a peer-review journal article and was the recipient of several research grants. She is a McNair Scholar and has received the Illinois Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (IL-SAMP) research assistantship, SIUC Research-Enriched Academic Challenge (REACH) research assistantship, and a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) internship. \"I have always loved math and science,\" she said. \"Those subjects came easy to me because I like to solve problems and explore. While at the Charter High School, Love also was a student in one of the SIUE East St. Louis Center's after-school Upward Bound Programs. Upward Bound is a college preparatory program that prepares students for post-secondary education and works to motivate their exploration of mathematics, science and related education.\n\nThe program is critical to encourage and better equip African-American students to pursue the math and science fields, Love said, adding that she was thrilled to learn about a recent $1 million gift to SIUE to build the East St. Louis 21st Century STEM Learning Center at the Charter High School. STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The high-tech learning center will provide students access to state-of-the-art technology, equipment and curricula.\n\n\"If I had to give the Charter High School any advice, it would have been to invest in providing students with more exposure to the various areas of science and to expand the level of mathematics teaching,\" said Love, who is vice president of the student chapter of the National Association for Professional Advancement of Black Chemist and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE). \"I felt a little behind when I got to SIUC. However, I excelled and graduated with research awards and high honors because of determination, self-motivation and a great support system.\"\n\nIt was both exciting and challenging to be one of the few African American students in the chemistry department at SIUC, Love said.\n\n\"During the second semester of my undergraduate experience, my professor let me teach class three times,\" Love said. \"I was very nervous, but she always told me that I could do it because I worked hard.\"\n\nLove added that she was the only freshman out of about 400 who was given this opportunity. This same instructor was so impressed with Love's ability that she allowed Love to teach her class the following year when she went on vacation.\n\nAfter graduating from SIUC in 2009, later that year Love entered a Ph.D. chemistry program at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.\n\nLove continued, \"When I thought about getting my Ph.D., I said: 'Why not!' Besides, who wouldn't want to be called Dr. Love? And I knew by getting my Ph.D., it would afford me more opportunities and more knowledge in my field.\"\n\nLove has a teaching assistantship and a research assistantship at Purdue. Immediately upon receiving her doctorate from Purdue, Love said she would like to work in forensics research. She previously interned with the Illinois State Police Forensics Lab in Carbondale.\n\n\"I find forensics intriguing because what is blind to the human eye is visible using many types of science instrumentation,\" Love said. She also has an interest in working in a pharmaceutical or chemical company.\n\nCurrently, Love, in collaboration with NOBCChE is working with Agape Village of Hope International in a STEM book drive for Ghana, West Africa. The effort, which lasts until May 2012, hopes to collect at least 1,000 books that will be donated to two senior high schools. For more information visit www.avohi.org.\n\n\"I want to do so many things, and one is to apply for grants to help support the technology development and advancement of STEM subjects being taught in many countries in Africa,\" Love said. \"I know I have to start small, but there is no limit to what a determined mind can do.\"\n\nSIUE Education Opens Doors to Freedom and Promise\n\nIt was the fall of 1964 and Don Hussey, armed only with a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, a four-year military record and a steel-clad resolve, persuaded the dean of admissions at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, to admit him as a freshman.\n\n\"A GED and a nickel would get you a cup of coffee in those days,\" said Hussey, first-time author. \"I convinced him to let me attend for one semester promising that if I failed, I would leave.\n\n\"The dean agreed to honor my request, admonishing me with: 'If you do not maintain a \"C\" average you will not be allowed to continue.'\" Hussey made the grade and was allowed to continue. He completed his coursework in December 1968 and graduated from SIUE on June 10, 1969.\n\nSIUE is a principal \"character\" in Hussey's recently published memoir: \"Ticket to Ride: the Promise of America-a True Story.\" The author gives an account of his challenges as a youth, his years in the U.S. Air Force and his journey to SIUE, where he was subsequently awarded his \"ticket to ride\"-his bachelor's degree from SIUE.\n\n\"With that leather bound document tucked under my arm, I could open doors and seek opportunities with confidence,\" Hussey said. \"Without it, I would have been relegated to a life of mediocrity.\n\n\"When I walked across the open-air stage to receive my degree, I knew it would be the most important credential in my life. It opened up for me the promise I had been given at birth-the promise of America.\"\n\nIn particular, the author likes to spread that message to young people in hopes of encouraging and motivating them to take advantage of this country's opportunities. \"They must advance their education and earn their degrees if they ever expect to go anywhere in this life,\" he said.\n\nBut a traumatic and life-altering accident after his first year of college threatened to derail his dreams. Hussey, while working a summer job in St. Louis, operated a large piece of equipment in an industrial machine shop. It was at this job that he made a miscalculation and it resulted in both of his hands being crushed. Hussey lost three fingers and crushed his little finger on his right hand. On his left hand, the author lost half of his three middle fingers and nearly severed his little finger.\n\n\"It was a long recovery- more emotional than physical,\" he said.\n\nThe accident required Hussey to go through extensive physical therapy and caused the author to miss about a half-year of schooling. But after a long period of adjustment, Hussey forced himself back to the typewriter, determined to learn to type again.\n\nThe horrendous accident didn't keep Hussey from having an exciting and enriching experience at SIUE. When Hussey started SIUE, the campus was located in Alton. After his accident and upon his return in fall 1965, the campus had moved to Edwardsville.\n\nHussey received a bachelor's in elementary education with a minor in math from SIUE in 1969.\n\n\"I've tried to show young people that they can make something out of their lives even if they encounter roadblocks along the way,\" he said. \"No one knows what fate will bring each day, but all of us must keep the faith, believe in the 'promise,' and reach for that elusive brass ring.\"\n\nHussey traveled back to SIUE to do research and interviews for his book. His interviews included speaking to many fraternity members who still live locally. He received much assistance in compiling research from the Louisa H. Bowen University Archives and Special Collections at SIUE. The author used photos from its digitized yearbooks from 1964-1969.\n\n\"They couldn't have been more helpful,\" he said. \"It was exciting to walk back into the Lovejoy Library. I hadn't passed through those doors in 35 years.\"\n\nHussey also credits Stephen Kerber, University archivist; Bill Brinson, University photographer; and Steve Jankowski, SIUE director of alumni affairs, for helping with his research.\n\n\"The most important thing in my life was to graduate from SIUE,\" he said. \"I would have been lost without it. Without that degree, the opportunities in our competitive world would surely have been frustrating and set limits on my future.\"\n\nThe author went on to earn a master's in education from Bridgewater State University and a master's in dispute resolution from the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Hussey also started his own business and ran for the Massachusetts State Senate and, more recently, ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress. He now lives in a suburb south of Boston, Mass., with his wife, Brenda.\n\nHussey's memoir is available on www.Amazon.com, www.Bn.com or for a personalized, signed copy visit www.donhussey.com .\n\nIERC At SIUE Releases Study On Reverse Transfer Students\n\nThe Illinois Education Research Council (IERC) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville released a report today highlighting the reverse transfer trends of the Illinois High School Class of 2003.\n\nReverse transferring is when students move from four-year institutions to community colleges. The practice has been depicted in recent research as one of the major forms of student mobility, according to the IERC. Since it is associated with extremely low rates of degree completion, it is critical to better understand the predictors of reverse transferring and what happens to reverse transfer students once they move to a community college, said Eric Lichtenberger, associate director of research for the IERC and an assistant research professor at SIUE.\n\n\"This knowledge could help policymakers as they develop strategies to meet the state's goal to increase the proportion of individuals with quality postsecondary degrees and credentials to 60 percent by 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe report focuses on 37,165 graduates from the Illinois public high school class of 2003 who initially enrolled at a four-year college and follows them along their path through postsecondary education. It starts by establishing the factors associated with reverse transferring, and then describes the subsequent postsecondary outcomes of reverse transfer students -such as degree attainment at the community college and bachelor's completion if they returned to a four-year institution.\n\nFindings from the report indicate the following:\n\nAbout 21 percent of students enrolling at four-year institutions reverse transferred to community colleges before the end of the study, which was completed in spring 2010;\n\nThe majority of reverse transfers happened early in the study; however, many reverse transfers occurred at points that would suggest junior or senior level status and beyond if students had persisted;\n\nMany reverse transfer students used community colleges as a way to persist in postsecondary education, while some students reverse transferred as a way to re-enter postsecondary education after taking time off from college;\n\nLess than 20 percent of reverse transfer students earned an associate's degree or certificate during their stay at a community college;\n\nOnly half of reverse transfer students made it back to a four-year college and slightly less than 25 percent earned a bachelor's degree.\n\nReverse transfer students account for nearly 50 percent of four-year college dropouts, with males more likely to reverse transfer. The IERC further reported that being from the middle parental income categories and expecting to work while enrolled increased the likelihood of reverse transferring; however, having a higher high school GPA and enrolling at a more selective institution were associated with a decreased likelihood of the practice.\n\nAccording to Lichtenberger \"This suggests that factors related to financial aid and academic preparation were both significant in terms of predicting reverse transferring.\" Also, the distance between where students come from in relation to their initial four-year institution was associated with this form of student mobility, as students who enrolled closer to home were much more likely to reverse transfer.\n\nThis report stemmed from previous IERC research that established how students who start at four-year colleges use the community college system.\n\nFor more information, contact Lichtenberger, the author of the report, (618) 650-2840 or (866) 799-4372. A complete report is available at ierc.siue.edu.\n\nJohn 'Jack' Ades Dies; Was Pioneer Faculty Member In English\n\nJohn Irvine \"Jack\" Ades, professor emeritus of English Language and Literature and one of the pioneer faculty at SIUE, died Thursday, Nov. 3, at his home in Edwardsville. He was 86. A native of Cincinnati, Ades joined the Southwestern Illinois Campus of SIU in 1958 as an instructor of English Language and Literature in what was then known as the Humanities Division at the Alton Residence Center, just one year after the fledgling university began classes there and at East St. Louis.\n\nHe became an assistant professor in 1963, an associate professor in 1966 and a professor in 1971, and was named chair of the English department the following year. He retired in 1990.\n\nBefore coming to SIUE, Ades taught freshman English and American Literature at the University of Cincinnati from 1955-58. Before that he was an instructor in literature and poetry at Johns Hopkins and at the College of Wooster in Ohio. Ades earned a bachelor of science in zoology and chemistry in 1949 at the University of Cincinnati, a master's in English the following year at Middlebury College in Vermont, and a doctorate in English at Cincinnati in 1963. He also served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\nAn author with several literary essays published, Ades was known locally for his popular collection: The Pizza Plot: And A Few Other Slices From Life (Daniel & Daniel Publications, 1989). He also wrote The Church on North Kansas Street (1993) and The Mattress Game (Minerva Press, 1999).\n\nHe is credited with being the first SIUE faculty member to have a literary piece published in the PMLA, the prestigious journal of the Modern Language Association of America. For many years Ades also served on the advisory board of SIUE's journal, \"Papers on Language and Literature.\" For some 15 years, he was the fine arts critic for The Telegraph in Alton and was known for his musicianship as a plectrum banjo player in The Old Guys Jazz Band, a popular St. Louis Area band made up of SIUE faculty members.\n\nA memorial service will be conducted at 11 a.m. Friday, Nov. 11, at the First Presbyterian Church in Edwardsville, Dr. John Hembruch officiating. Weber & Rodney Funeral Home in Edwardsville is in charge of arrangements. Memorials may be made to First Presbyterian, 237 N. Kansas St., Edwardsville, IL 62025 or to the American Parkinson's Disease Association, 660 S. Euclid Ave., Campus Box 811, St. Louis, MO 63110.\n\nChief Judge Herndon Challenges SIUE Charter High School Students\n\nIn a couple months, a senior at the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville East St. Louis Charter High School could end up in a federal courtroom-shadowing Chief Judge David R. Herndon of the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Illinois.\n\nThis new mentoring opportunity, the Judge Joseph F. Cunningham Fellowship Program, which was named for a judge who was an East St. Louis native, is being offered to selected high school seniors interested in learning about the federal judicial system or who want to explore careers in federal law enforcement.\n\n\"When I was in college and law school, I had the advantage of having mentors I could talk to and get advice,\" Herndon said. He graduated from SIUE with a bachelor's in 1974 and from the SIU Carbondale School of Law in 1977.\n\nHerndon invited students to apply for the first annual fellowship program. He is one of four federal officials that students selected to participate in the program will shadow. The other three include: Clerk of Court Nancy Rosenstengel, United States District Court; U.S. Marshal Donald Slazinik and U.S. Attorney Stephen R. Wigginton, all of the Southern District of Illinois.\n\nOnly one student will be chosen from each of the following high schools: Althoff, Cahokia, East St. Louis and the Charter High School. Students must submit an application, proof of U.S. citizenship, an official transcript, a recommendation letter from a teacher or guidance counselor and an essay of no more than 1,000 words explaining why they are interested in learning more about the federal court system and law enforcement. Applications can be obtained from high school counselors or the information can be downloaded at www.ilsd.uscourts.gov.\n\nThe program will run January through April, 2012. Each student will shadow each of the four officials, spending one day with each of them during those months.\n\n\"This program resulted in the vision of Mr. (James) Lewis as a way to honor the legacy of Joseph Cunningham, who was a fair and compassionate judge and went on to serve on the Illinois State Supreme Court,\" Herndon said. Lewis, executive director of the East St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners, co-founded the Cunningham Fellowship Program with Herndon.\n\nBrandon Rice, a junior at the East St. Louis Charter High School, asked Herndon how he was able to be fair and impartial on cases.\n\n\"At first I had to concentrate on that because I was not on the plaintiff side any longer,\" Herndon said. \"But as time passes and you're purposing to be neutral, it becomes less of a consideration. I only think in terms of what is the law.\"\n\nHerndon was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1998. He serves on the executive committee of the Federal Trial Judges Division of the American Bar Association. He also is a member of the Illinois State Bar Association, the Missouri Bar Association and the Madison County Bar Association. He serves on a committee of judges who read essays for the James Lewis Essay Contest and Scholarship Program for the NAACP East St. Louis Branch.

And Kathleen Thimsen is consumed with improving the conditions for the vulnerable populations in the Metro East.\n\nNeither of the women is looking for any recognition. In fact, both were surprised to learn that the Center for Racial Harmony in Swansea had selected them as recipients of Phenomenal Women awards.\n\n\"I don't see myself as a phenomenal woman,\" said Miles, SIUE associate vice chancellor for student affairs. \"I was just doing my job.\"\n\n\"I was surprised at the news of an award,\" said Thimsen, director of SIUE Community Nursing Services at the SIUE East St. Louis Center and an instructor in the School of Nursing. \"This has been a remarkable journey and an amazing opportunity for me, and for our SIUE student nurses to assist people in improving their quality of life. The people of the East St. Louis community are so wonderful and caring. They are no different from anyone else in wanting a better way of life for themselves and for their children.\"\n\nRacial Harmony is dedicated to promoting cooperation and understanding among all races and ethnic groups, said Jerril Jones, president. Racial Harmony, a grass-roots organization now in its 20th year of operation, is committed to making a difference through mediation, teaching, training and cooperative learning.\n\nThe Phenomenal Women Award, that began three years ago, was the brainchild of Constance Rockingham, former SIUE vice president for student affairs and president emeritus for Racial Harmony. Helping formulate the award program was Cheryl Heard, assistant director of the SIUE Kimmel Leadership Center. Heard was president of the Racial Harmony from 2005-2010.\n\n\"The idea is to recognize exceptional women in the Metropolitan St. Louis area for outstanding contributions to their communities, families and work that goes over and beyond their professional responsibilities,\" Jones said. A total of 45 were honored as Phenomenal Women recently at the Center for Racial Harmony's annual dinner auction at The Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows in Belleville. A total of 120 women have received the award.\n\nThe Center for Racial Harmony selected Miles because of her instrumental work with the development and implementation of the SIUE Student Success Center. The facility was touted as enabling student achievement by creating an environment where all students can be successful. Miles also serves on the Student Success Advisory Council charged with developing a University Retention plan that will focus on under-represented populations such as African American males, the disabled, Hispanics and international students.\n\nThimsen was spotlighted for her involvement with community gardening in East St. Louis. Thimsen and her public health nursing students began the Jones Park Re-Beautification Project-part of the Green Partnership gardening sites-in 2009. The purpose is to bring people together in order to promote and educate them about healthy nutrition, diet, lifestyles and exercise. Thimsen also is planning to start a caregiver education program in East St Louis in February 2012.\n\nIn addition to the Phenomenal Women Award, the Center for Racial Harmony has an initiative that is working on the elimination of the educational achievement gap between majority and minority students, Jones said. Any group or person interested in joining the organization or obtaining more information can contact centerforracialharmony@yahoo.com.\n\nLegislators, Officials Unveiling $3.5 Million In Equipment At NCERC\n\nLegislators, local dignitaries, Southern Illinois University and SIU Edwardsville administrators, and industry leaders met today at the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center in SIUE's University Park to witness the unveiling of nearly $3.5 million in equipment, made possible through the generous support of Cereal Process Technologies, LLC (CPT) of Overland Park, Kansas, and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.\n\nThe corn fractionation system represents an advanced technology NCERC will utilize to expand upon the career training programs and advanced ethanol research currently taking place at the country's only pilot-scale ethanol facility.\n\n\"CPT's fractionation technology is the foundation for a revitalized ethanol industry,\" said Kenneth \"Pete\" Moss, CPT's vice president of marketing. \"It significantly reduces energy consumption, provides high value edible corn oil and creates new cellulosic ethanol feedstock. With recent process enhancements the ethanol plant can get more oil, more starch and higher value products.\"\n\nSIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift emphasized the importance of the new technology in taking the NCERC to the next level.\n\n\"The NCERC is the only facility of its kind in the world,\" he said. \"We are so fortunate to have this facility, which is committed to serving a diverse clientele that includes the private and public sectors, industry leaders, academia, and domestic and foreign ethanol producers. The center offers necessary third-party validation and commercial testing of a variety of products and technologies.\"\n\nAccording to NCERC Director John Caupert, \"The gift will help the Center in its efforts to reduce dependence on imported foreign oil and generate jobs, as well as improve the environment through the promotion and use of renewable fuels. This system opens up new opportunities for industry, government, academic researchers, along with trade and policy in developing new fuels, chemicals and food products from corn.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the Illinois Corn Marketing Board and Illinois Corn Growers Association predicted the new system would tremendously advance NCERC's research capabilities and expand the Center's marketability for partnerships with private-sector companies in the biofuels industry.\n\n\"The new fractionation system installed on the ethanol pilot plant will allow NCERC to become a true biorefinery research center capable of developing and validating in partnership with industry new co-products, fuels, and chemicals to benefit both the corn farmers and consumers,\" Illinois Corn Marketing Board Chairman Bill Christ said.\n\nIllinois Corn Growers Association President Jim Reed said, \"ICGA commends DCEO, SIUE and Cereal Process Technologies for this significant investment in the future of NCERC and the new opportunities that this fractionation system will generate. NCERC, through its success at commercializing new value-added technologies, has already proven to be an excellent return on the investment of public dollars.\"\n\nAn informal news conference followed the event.\n\nNew Cougar Business Resource Center Facility Opens at SIUE\n\nThe Cougar Business Resource Center (CBRC), a 3,700 square-feet complex designed to support the new curricula is the latest addition to the School of Business at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n\nSIUE officials dedicated the new facility in Founder's Hall on November 3rd at a reception for students, faculty and staff of the School of Business from 1 to 2 p.m., celebrating the high-tech facility that will serve as a focal point for resources, programs, and co-curricular activities. CBRC tours will continue for students, faculty and staff through November 8th. The Center will begin operation on November 9th.\n\nThe new space is composed of online learning technologies, conference rooms for practicing presentations, communication technology for students to interact with faculty and teammates regardless of location, shared office space for student organizations and Executive-in-Residence offices. The Executive-in-Residence program will be developed as a mentoring/coaching program that will allow students and faculty to take advantage of the experience of business professionals.\n\nThe CBRC is a work environment for students unlike any other on campus. The modern surroundings integrate technology into a collaborative work environment that would easily lend itself to the office of a Fortune 500 company rather than a university.\n\nAdditionally, students no longer need to wander the halls of Founders looking for space to set up and study. The conference rooms of the CBRC provide ample space for students to spread out and spend hours working on homework and group projects.\n\nSIUE Chancellor, Vaughn Vandegrift spoke at the ribbon cutting about how the CBRC is emblematic of his main goal, which is for SIUE to be nationally recognized as an elite university.\n\n\"I am impressed with this facility not only because of what it can do for our students but also because it demonstrates what a great difference donors can make for this university,\" said Vandegrift.\n\nSchool of Business Dean Gary Giamartino addressed how the CBRC is also advancing the mission of the School. \"We are committed to continuous improvement and these necessary changes in curriculum and facilities will shape the way the undergraduate business curricula will be delivered and how our business students learn at SIUE. Ultimately, these changes will produce graduates who better possess the skills employers are seeking.\"\n\n\"Only the generosity of private donors, such as TheBANK of Edwardsville and The Korte Company, made the CBRC a reality,\" said School of Business Dean Gary Giamartino. \"The strong support of our business alumni has ensured that we have made this facility the best possible hands-on learning environment for our students.\"\n\n\"TheBANK of Edwardsville is proud to be a major supporter of the Cougar Business Resource Center,\" stated Tom Holloway, President of TheBANK. \" We treasure our long-standing partnership with SIUE and our mutual commitment to academic, athletic, arts and civic programs. To have our name permanently associated with such a new, state-of-the art facility is truly an honor.\"\n\nAlumni CBRC contributors include William D. Boudouris 78) and Teresa Boudouris, Jeffrey M. Dale ('79) and Denise Panyik-Dale ('81), Camille Emig-Hill ('72, '77) and D. Bradley Hill ('78), Doris K. Reynolds-Johnson ('83, '85) and Gordon A. Johnson (82, '84), Jane Louer ('85) and Craig R. Louer ('76), Steven F. McCann ('78) and Alita R. McCann, Mara \"Mitch\" Meyers ('77, '80) and Robert J. Meyers ('71, '72), David R. Schaake ('77) and Kathy Schaake, James C. Zink ('67) and Rita M. Zink, and Michael Wenzel ('70) and Kathleen A. Wenzel ('71.)\n\nSIUE East St. Louis Performing Arts Director Wins Award\n\nThe masterfully artistic arrangement of dance, music and theater, which portrays what saved, strengthened and sustained blacks from Africa to America, resulted in a regional award for its creator-Theodore H. Jamison, director of the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville East St. Louis Performing Arts Program.\n\nJamison recently won the Black Excellence Award 2010-2011 for Outstanding Achievement in Dance/Choreography for his piece, \"The Blood,\" presented by the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago. Jamison was commissioned to do the piece by the Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago, which is the largest African dance company in the United States.\n\n\"What was more compelling to me was to show the tie from Africa to America and how African Americans have come this far with our spiritualism and religion,\" Jamison said.\n\nHis 20-minute suite was part of Muntu's \"This Far by Faith\" concert, which was presented at the Harris Theater of Music and Dance in Millennium Park in downtown Chicago.\n\n\"The African-ritual part of the choreography was inspired by the late Katherine Dunham's 'Shango,' which is an Afro-Caribbean ritual,\" said Jamison, who was certified more than 25 years ago by the late dance legend herself, as a Master Dunham Technique instructor. Jamison has worked with the SIUE East St. Louis Performing Arts Program for nearly 28 years. Jamison choreographed the number under the direction of Muntu's artistic director, Amaniyea Payne, who, in her own right is also a keeper of traditions of cultures of the African Diaspora. The piece includes a live pianist, live percussion and a live vocalist, and covers various aspects of the arts including music, dance, theater and visual aids, Jamison said.\n\n\"Mr. Jamison, being the dynamic artist/choreographer that he is, gave Muntu Dance Theatre the opportunity to bring the energy/synergy of Katherine Dunham to the stage,\" said Payne, who designed and made all the costuming for the presentation. \"The piece was very thought provoking, as well as a menagerie on the stage. It was spectacular.\"\n\nJamison also worked with Joan Gray, executive director of Muntu, on his production. Muntu in the African Bantu language means \"the essence of humanity.\" The Chicago's dance company's mission is to \"preserve and perpetuate the African aesthetic and its influence on world cultures, through education and professional presentation of dance, music and folklore.\" \"Miss Dunham once said: 'Dance is a way of life,'\" said Jamison. \"The Muntu Dance Theatre exemplifies the philosophy of Miss Dunham through their embodiment and presentation of authentic rhythms, songs and dance of the African Diaspora.\" Jamison is scheduled to teach the Dunham Technique from January 25-28 at the International Association of Blacks in Dance Conference in Toronto, Canada. This will be his15th year teaching at the international conference.\n\nSIUE Pharmacist Wins State Award\n\nIn just a little over five years, this young pharmacist has written curriculum, trained pharmacists to become diabetes coaches in collaboration with the Illinois Pharmacist Association (IPhA), been instrumental in establishing immunization programs throughout Illinois-including ones at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville-and has created a statewide student competition for patient counseling.\n\nSo it came as no surprise when the Illinois Pharmacist Association recently selected Dr. Jessica Kerr to receive the Illinois Pharmacist of the Year Award, said Dr. Gireesh Gupchup, a pharmacist and dean of the SIUE School of Pharmacy.\n\n\"She's very passionate and energetic and is always looking to move the profession forward,\" Gupchup said. \"Her enthusiasm is really infectious. She's truly a star.\"\n\nBut the 34-yerar-old pharmacist sees her work as being the bright spot. \"It's hard to find a job that you love, that is also your hobby,\" said Kerr, who also won the Illinois Distinguished Young Pharmacist of the Year Award in 2007. \"But that's what I found in pharmacy.\"\n\nKerr received her doctorate in pharmacy in 2001 from St. Louis College of Pharmacy and came to SIUE in 2005. She is an associate professor in pharmacy practice in the SIUIE Department of Pharmacy. Kerr also works with in the St. Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center's Belleville office, where she helps patients improve their cardiovascular outcomes and empowers patients with diabetes to take ownership of their condition. She has worked collectively with the Illinois Pharmacists Association to train pharmacists to manage patients' diabetes within the Patient Self-Monitoring Program.\n\nThe mother of three continues to serve on the IPhA Board of Directors and remains active with other state and national Boards.\n\n\"Getting all this work done at times can be a challenge, but once I sit back and remember why I am doing what I am doing it boils down to this: I want to be a role model for my students and my own kids, and I want to give back to the profession.\"\n\nKerr said she feels the best way to do this is to continue her efforts within her community and to continue with her faculty advisor role for the SIUE Academy of Student Pharmacists organization.\n\nFOTAD Presents 'STARs & Scars' Nov. 6 At SIUE's Morris Center\n\nMysterious shenanigans will take center stage Nov. 6 as the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Friends of Theater and Dance (FOTAD) present STARs & Scars, a gentle spoof on life at the University, at FOTAD's 15 th Annual Mystery Dinner Theater and Silent Auction. FOTAD is the support organization for the SIUE Department of Theater and Dance. Proceeds from the Nov. 6 event will benefit the organization's scholarship fund for SIUE theater and dance majors. Reservations must be made by Nov. 2.\n\nPlaywright S.J. Morrison is up to his old tricks weaving mystery and hilarious antics. \"When an escaped criminal is discovered on an already ill-fated tour of the SIUE campus, it's up to the STARs tour guides to find the perpetrator,\" Morrison said. \"With warring tour guides, a prospective chancellor candidate and a bizarre group of visitors, this romp through the SIUE campus promises to be filled with comedy, suspense and some light-hearted fun at the expense of the university we love.\"\n\nAccording to Morrison, who has written several whodunit's for FOTAD's Annual Mystery Dinner Theater, it all adds up to a funny experience for the audience. \"From the humorous tour guides to the improbable murder and the larger-than-life characters, this comedic mystery farce promises to entertain.,\" Morrison said.\n\nSTARs & Scars will be performed by FOTAD board members and several community supporters seen locally on stage. The 'whodunit' will be performed in the SIUE Morris University Center's Conference Center, on the second floor of the center. Doors open at 6:15 for viewing auction items, the play starts around 7 p.m. and dinner is served shortly thereafter.\n\nFOTAD President Greg Conroy said the evening will feature plenty of laughs and good food. \"This will be the perfect evening to combine a nice dinner with shopping for that unique Christmas gift. \"And, if you have ever entertained the urge to play detective, this is your big chance because each table can guess 'whodunit' and go home with free tickets to one of the shows in FOTAD's annual family theater series, A Season for the Child,\" he said.\n\nTickets are $40 per person and include a full dinner. For reservation information, or to make a reservation with a credit card by Nov. 2, call the SIUE Fine Arts box office, (618) 650-2774, or, from St. Louis toll-free, (888) 328-5168, Ext. 2774.\n\nSusan Winters Tapped by NLN For Selective Faculty Leadership Development Program\n\nSusan Winters, director of the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Regional Nursing Program, has been selected through competitive application for the year-long Leadership Development Program for Simulation Educators, a faculty leadership development initiative offered by the National League for Nursing (NLN). The program is designed for those interested in assuming a leadership role in the research or administration of simulation programs in nursing education.\n\nSIUE School of Nursing Dean Marcia Maurer considers it a great honor to have an SIUE Nursing faculty member selected for this prestigious NLN program. \"In her role as the director, the knowledge and skills gained by Dr. Winters through this program will be invaluable as she guides the development and utilization of the simulation lab in the Regional Nursing Program on the Carbondale campus,\" Maurer said. \"Simulation in nursing education has grown in its importance as the foundational element to actual clinical practice. Because nursing is a knowledge profession, we have an inherent obligation to ensure that our students go to clinical better prepared than ever before. Dr. Winters has a wonderful opportunity to work with the best in the field and then to incorporate best practices into the SIUE Nursing Program.\"\n\nWinters has been a nurse educator for 19 years, teaching LPN, ADN, BSN, RN-to-BSN, and MSN programs in Illinois and Virginia. Winters has led the SIUE regional program at Carbondale since February 2010 and is responsible for all facets of the simulation laboratory, including the training of faculty members. After the completion of the NLN program, Winters says she hopes to utilize the information obtained to guide the design and operation of the regional program.\n\nAmong 20 nurse educators chosen from colleges and universities around the United States, Winter will study for a year under the direction of Pamela Jeffries, author of numerous scholarly articles on the subject and also editor of Simulations in Nursing Education: From Conceptualization to Evaluation (NLN, 2007). She also is a professor of Health Systems and Outcomes and associate dean for academic affairs at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. She is nationally known for her research and work in developing simulations and online teaching and learning. At Hopkins and throughout the academic community, Jeffries is well regarded for her expertise in experiential learning, innovative teaching strategies, new pedagogies, and the delivery of content using technology in nursing education.\n\nTo expand the science of nursing education while developing their personal leadership portfolios, participants in the NLN initiative program will spend the year engaged in varied activities that examine key issues on a dual track: research and administration, ultimately choosing a single area of focus. To kick off the program, participants meet for two days in Orlando in September, just prior to the NLN's 2011 Education Summit. Looking ahead, the group will participate in leadership development webinars; exchange ideas and best practices in simulation in private forums; review existing scholarly research; visit simulation centers around the country to evaluate resources and operations; consult with Laerdal representatives on equipment issues; contribute to a group project to develop or expand the Simulation Information Resource Center (SIRC) website; and attend conferences.\n\nDedicated to excellence in nursing, the NLN is the premier organization for nurse faculty and leaders in nursing education, offering faculty development, networking opportunities, testing services, nursing research grants, and public policy initiatives to its 34,000 individual and 1,200 institutional members.\n\nSIUE Receives Collaborative $900,000 NSF Grant\n\nA team of researchers headed by Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Engineering Assistant Professor of Computer Science Gary Mayer has been awarded a $900,000 National Science Foundation Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) grant to study the effects of mentoring related to student interest in pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.\n\nThe effort is a collaborative enterprise between SIUE and the University of Southern California (USC), with support from the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics (KIPR). Mayer will work with Sharon Locke, director of the SIUE Center for STEM Research, Education and Outreach and Brad White, senior researcher with the Illinois Education Research Council (IERC).\n\nIntroducing the popular Botball robotics competition, managed by KIPR, to communities unfamiliar with the program from the Southern Illinois and Southern California areas, 50 middle-school teachers will be prepared as mentors using four different training techniques. Approximately 500 middle school students from diverse backgrounds will be coached by mentors. Student participants' expectations of success and desire to take STEM courses and pursue STEM careers will be surveyed before and after the program and the results, along with feedback from the mentors, will enable researchers to examine the effectiveness of the different mentoring techniques.\n\n\"This grant is the result of us wanting to expand upon the outcome of previous research,\" Mayer said, explaining the latest grant funding was made possible thanks to work conducted by SIUE Acting Associate Provost for Research and Dean of the Graduate School Jerry Weinberg, who also is a professor of Computer Science, and SIUE Associate Provost for Academic Planning and Program Development Sue Thomas, who also is a professor of Psychology. Mayer continued, \"We are looking at what we can do as instructors, how we can vary what our mentors do, and determining what type of influence different techniques have on students.\" The team plans to devise a framework that can be used by mentors to positively influence students' desire to engage in STEM activities - both for Botball and in a broader, more general context.\n\nMayer will also collaborate on the project with Stephen Marlett, SIUE associate professor of Curriculum and Instruction in the School of Education, Maja Mataric, professor of Computer Science, Neuroscience and Pediatrics at USC, and director of USC's Center for Robotics and Embedded Systems, and Ross Mead, SIUE School of Engineering alumnus and NSF graduate research fellow at USC. The USC location in multicultural Los Angeles and the diverse population around SIUE's own campus will allow the team to investigate the role of ethnicity in mentoring for STEM education.\n\nAccording to the NSF website, the ITEST program \"responds to current concerns and projections about the growing demand for STEM professionals in the U.S. and seeks solutions to help ensure the breadth and depth of the STEM workforce. ITEST supports the development, implementation, testing and scale-up of implementation models. It also supports research studies to address questions that point to solutions for building a strong, competent STEM workforce.\"\n\nSIUE Chancellor Vandegrift Announces Retirement after Successful Tenure at Annual Address to the University Community\n\nTelling the story of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's route to national recognition through its important achievements and milestones, SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift delivered his annual address today and ended it by announcing his intent to retire at the end of the 2011-2012 fiscal year.\n\nThough many are surprised by this announcement, SIU President Dr. Glenn Poshard pointed out that Chancellor Vandegrift has accomplished much of what he was hired to do, including achieving national recognition for the University, moving Intercollegiate Athletics to NCAA Division I in the Ohio Valley Conference, and numerous construction and infrastructure projects improving the current campus climate and paving the way for the future at SIUE.\n\n\"Dr. Vandegrift was hired to take the University to a new level of excellence,\" Poshard noted. \"The substantial progress SIUE has made toward achieving national recognition speaks to the success he has orchestrated during his tenure.\"\n\nIn addition to prestigious recognitions by U.S.News and World Report Best Colleges of 2012 listing SIUE as a top 15 master's comprehensive public institution in the Midwest region and one of 46 \"up-and-coming\" institutions in the entire country for innovative changes in academics, faculty, student life, campus and facilities, the University has gained national recognition through many rankings and acknowledgments-among them the 2011 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with distinction by the Corporation for National and Community Service; and a ranking among the Top 50 by Washington Monthly among 553 master's universities nationally.\n\nThe University will now embark on the difficult challenge of finding a new chancellor to continue the quest for excellence. Vandegrift indicated his retirement will be effective July 1. According to President Poshard, \"The Office of the President will conduct a nationwide search for Dr. Vandegrift's successor; details will be released as they are available,\" he said.\n\n\"We are so grateful for his leadership and hard work over these past seven years. He will undoubtedly be missed, but we wish him and his family well in retirement.\"\n\nVandegrift thanked the SIUE community for their support. \"To have been part of this great university, to not only have been afforded the benefit of appreciating all of its component parts, but to actually have been given the responsibility to affect change toward the realization of its vision for national recognition is something I would never have imagined possible earlier in my life.\"\n\nOther highlights and challenges for the future from his address included:\n\n\"A University that has a bold vision for national recognition must also be a University that believes it can attain such recognition,\" Vandegrift said. \"I've often said that our journey to national recognition would be realized not by seeking recognition for its own sake, but by doing the right things and doing them well. And doing the right things well has both enabled national recognition and catalyzed our advancement as a University.\"\n\nThe University achieved record enrollment for fall 2011 at 14,235 students, with an average ACT score of 22.4. He added that more students than ever have designated SIUE as a first-choice institution when making college plans.\n\nSIUE again has won a spot among the Top 50 Awards from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association (RCGA), in recognition of contributions to the region such as more than $250 million in infrastructure improvements in roads and buildings since 2004, and an economic impact that increased from $356 million per year in 2005 to $471 million per year in 2010, according to an economic impact study.\n\nOther key initiatives in the journey toward national recognition have included developing the University's honors program to compete with the caliber of programs available at other metropolitan universities; adding more online courses and programs in order to foster different learning environments; introducing new bachelor's programs in health and human sciences, as well as in integrative studies; constructing a new nursing building to meet the School's growing enrollment demands, and continuing the institution's focus on performance-based funding and continuous improvement.\n\nVandegrift spoke about SIUE's first major gifts campaign, Defining Excellence-The Campaign for SIUE, and its success from its introduction in 2007 to the launch of the public phase last spring and into the present. Currently the University has received more than $29 million of its $50-million goal.\n\nIn closing, Vandegrift promised SIUE would continue being \"a beacon for the region we serve, gaining national recognition for the excellence of our programs and the professional and community leaders we produce.\"\n\n2011 SIUE Homecoming - Pride on the Prowl\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville is celebrating the 2011 SIUE Homecoming with a week-long series of events targeting current students, alumni, faculty, staff and community members.

The overall scores are based on the academic preparedness of students, graduation rates, faculty characteristics and the reputation of SIUE in higher education.\n\n\"We're pleased that our peers continue to rank SIUE as one of the top innovative universities in the Midwest,\" said SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift. \"Across the country, SIUE is recognized for providing academic excellence at an affordable price. As top employers in our region already know, the individualized attention and unique experiences of an SIUE education prepare our students for successful careers in the global marketplace.\"\n\n\"I know our alumni take great pride in our reputation for academic excellence,\" Vandegrift said. \"Their commitment to help their alma mater attract the best faculty and students speaks to the power of their SIUE experience. As our reputation continues to grow, the value of their SIUE degree grows with it.\"\n\nThe \"Up-and-Comers\" category includes a total listing of 46 colleges and universities (only 17 public institutions) throughout the country. Vandegrift said SIUE has embraced innovative change, pointing to improvements made in the general education curriculum to enhance the educational experience and increasing opportunities for undergraduate research experiences, as well as the Student Success Center that integrates academic and personal support services for students and provides them in one location.\n\nSIUE is in the midst of a $250 million planned campus infrastructure update and construction phase, which includes construction on the Science Building and additions to the SIUE Art and Design and Engineering buildings.\n\nHe also cited the University's commitment to NCAA Division I certification in Intercollegiate Athletics as another indicator of excellence. The two teams identified to be fast-tracked have seen great success in their first year of Division I championship eligibility. Men's soccer was the runner-up at the Missouri Valley Conference tournament and the softball team participated in the Ohio Valley Conference tournament.\n\n\"Our student-athletes are excelling in the classroom, as well,\" Vandegrift said. \"Spring 2011 marked the 10th consecutive semester all student-athletes have earned a cumulative 3.0 or higher GPA.\"\n\nThe latest U.S. News rankings come on the heels of last month's recognition by Washington Monthly that ranks SIUE among the top 50 master's universities in the nation. SIUE has also recently been named by the Corporation for National and Community Service to its list of colleges and universities demonstrating a commitment to volunteering, service-learning and civic engagement.\n\n\"The continued acclaim our University receives is a credit to our distinguished faculty and dedicated staff who are proud to prepare our students for their careers of choice,\" said Ann M. Boyle, interim provost and vice chancellor for Academic Affairs. \"Our low student-to-professor ratio allows our faculty to mentor our students in the classroom and work side-by-side with them on projects and innovative research.\"\n\nSIU Edwardsville Fall Enrollment Largest In Its History\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville has reached the largest overall enrollment in the history of the school at 14,235, representing a nearly 1 percent increase over last fall's enrollment of 14,133. Undergraduate enrollment growth is supported by a record freshman class and a new transfer class, which is 3 percent larger than fall 2010.\n\nSIUE Interim Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Ann Boyle released the fall enrollment numbers today, which include undergraduate, graduate and professional schools. The University received a record 16,501 total applications for the fall term, including 10,300 for the freshman class and 3,723 for new transfers.\n\n\"We are proud of the caliber and quality of students we attract at SIUE,\" Boyle said. \"Our faculty members and staff are committed to academic excellence, educational innovation, undergraduate involvement in research and continuous quality improvement in all areas. These factors, coupled with dynamic student support services and a beautiful, safe environment for learning are making the University a first-choice, first-tier institution in the state of Illinois.\"\n\nRecord undergraduate enrollment is supported by a record freshman class of 2,070 which is up five students from last year, and a new transfer class of 1,232 which is 3 percent larger than fall 2010. The new freshman class includes 494 merit and need-based scholarship recipients with an average ACT of 27, who have been recognized based on academic abilities and talents.\n\nOne-third of the class has indicated an interest in pre-professional health (pre-medical, pre-dental, pre-veterinary medicine, pre-pharmacy) or nursing.\n\nNew freshman enrollment from Madison and St. Clair counties remains strong with new growth coming primarily from the Chicago area and from out-of-state enrollment. SIUE attracted 77 freshmen with an average 25.5. ACT. Those students will live for at least one year in the University's residence halls.\n\n\"Approximately 29 percent of freshmen come from ethnically underrepresented backgrounds and 26 percent will be the first in their family to go to college,\" said Scott Belobrajdic, assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Management, in the preliminary enrollment report. Belobrajdic noted this is the fourth year of overall enrollment growth at SIUE. It is the seventh consecutive year of growth in the size of the freshman class, which has increased by 20 percent since fall 2004.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of the recent ranking of SIUE as 48 th among the Top 50 of 553 master's universities in the U.S. by the national magazine, Washington Monthly, which evaluates universities based on their \"contribution to the public good\" in the areas of social mobility, research and service.\n\nBelobrajdic pointed out that SIUE's improving retention rates, national recognition and low tuition also may be factors in the University's growth.\n\nWashington Monthly Ranks SIUE Among Top 50 In Nation\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Washington Monthly, a national magazine, has ranked Southern Illinois University Edwardsville among the Top 50 of the 553 master's universities in the nation.\n\nSIUE ranked 13th among public institutions, one spot above last year's placing. Unlike conventional college rankings, Washington Monthly evaluates an institution's \"contribution to the public good in three broad categories: Social Mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), Research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and Service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).\"\n\n\"We are extremely proud of being recognized again by Washington Monthly for the opportunities we provide students and for our students' commitment to serving our communities,\" said SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift. \"We are working hard to create a high quality, stimulating academic environment at SIUE that also encourages students to be engaged and productive citizens. To be ranked among the Top 50 two years in a row shows that our quest for excellence is bearing fruit.\"\n\nWashington Monthly ranked SIUE 48th overall nationally among its Top 50 Master's Universities category. The University placed 6th in expenditures for research-up from 8th last year-having invested more than $30 million in research and public service projects in fiscal year 2010. This investment allows a significant number of SIUE students at the undergraduate and graduate levels the opportunity to participate in research projects in their fields of study.\n\nUnder the service sub-category, SIUE was ranked 1st again in the percent of federal work study funds dedicated to students employed in community service programs. For example, $547,867 of federal work study dollars were spent in fiscal year 2010 on the federal America Reads program the University offers at the SIUE East St. Louis Center.\n\nRecently SIUE was also named by the Corporation for National and Community Service to the annual President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with distinction-a list of colleges and universities demonstrating a commitment to volunteering, service-learning and civic engagement. SIUE students have many opportunities to work on service projects and in the area of volunteerism throughout the year through the University's Kimmel Leadership Development Center.\n\n\"At SIUE, we strive to be a partner to our region,\" Vandegrift said. \"In addition to providing an excellent education at an affordable price, we are particularly proud that our students are good citizens who choose to give back to society. Our region is made stronger by SIUE graduates who work to improve the world around them.\"\n\nSIUE to Implement MAP-Works for Fourth Consecutive Year\n\nThis fall will mark the fourth consecutive year that Southern Illinois University Edwardsville will participate in MAP (Making Achievement Possible)-Works, a comprehensive program than enables colleges and universities to improve student retention. With a commitment to student success, University Housing first introduced MAP-Works to all residence hall freshmen in fall 2008.\n\nMAP-Works is gaining national attention for providing an \"early warning system\" for students who are at risk for a variety of reasons beyond academic difficulty. SIUE is one of only 100 institutions currently using MAP-Works to identify at-risk students. The MAP-Works Retention Platform is built on a core concept supported by research and experience; that successful retention is driven by the early, systematic, and comprehensive identification of student issues.\n\nMichael Schultz, Director of University Housing, comments on the impact of MAP-Works on student retention, \"In the past three years University Housing has been able to be intentional with our students based on the data that MAP-Works has provided. We know we have been able to retain some students and make a difference in their lives. We are dedicated to finding new ways to use MAP-Works to increase the retention of SIUE students.\"\n\nRetention is a team effort, facilitated by communication across units. At SIUE, a number of units are actively participating in MAP-Works intervention, including: University Housing, Athletics, Academic Advising, Disability Support Services, and Student Opportunities for Academic Results (SOAR).\n\nThe MAP-Works data reveals to administrators a wealth of information about their students that is more accurate and more current than they could otherwise collect. Schools can then adjust their retention efforts to target students in need. As a result, MAP-Works positively impacts student success and retention by arming schools with a clear picture of their students.\n\nKathleen Gardner, Associate Director of Residence Life and MAP-Works Campus Administrator, states, \"MAP-Works enables University Housing staff to be proactive in our approach to student success. We are able to intervene with students struggling with their transition to college earlier in the semester and connect them to campus resources before they make the decision to withdraw or before they end up on academic probation.\"\n\nFor additional information on MAP-Works at SIUE, contact Kathleen Gardner, Associate Director of Residence Life at 618-650-4251 or kagardn@siue.edu.\n\nIERC Report Shows More Principal Training, Mentoring Needed For Illinois To Meet Reform Goals, Boost Student Achievement\n\nChanging demographics and new reform laws will require Illinois public school districts to provide principals with new kinds of support and training if they want principals to successfully implement new reform laws and boost student achievement.\n\nThis is one of the findings in a new, comprehensive report on Illinois' 3,600 public school principals. The report documents shifting demographic and turnover trends among elementary and high school principals; the areas in which principals are having a direct impact on student performance; and principals' own beliefs about their strengths and weaknesses as administrators. The report, released today by the Illinois Education Research Council (IERC), Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, also makes recommendations to help Illinois public school officials secure and retain high quality principals.\n\n\"Although principals play a vital role as school leaders, most research to date has focused on how teachers affect student learning rather than on the role of principals. This report will help policymakers and practitioners better understand how principals impact student achievement and the adjustments districts will need to make in the face of changing demographics and principal attitudes and beliefs,\" said Brad White, a senior researcher with the IERC.\n\nKey Findings from The Principal Report: The State of School Leadership in Illinois, include:\n\nPrincipal Demographics are Shifting Rapidly\n\nYounger and more turnover. Overall, the average age of principals is decreasing, due to a retiring baby boom generation. This age shift has resulted in greater principal turnover system-wide and a drop in the percentage (from 38 to 28 percent) of principals occupying their current school six years or more.\n\nMore diversity. The proportion of female principals doubled between 1990 and 2008, and more women than men have led Illinois schools since 2005. The number of minorities serving as principals is also growing. Nevertheless, principals outside of Chicago and its suburbs still tend to be largely white and male.\n\nCertain Principal Experiences Correlate Closely with Higher Student Performance\n\nMore Assistant Principal (AP) experience. The number of principals with previous experience as AP at their current school nearly doubled statewide since 2001 and increased fivefold in Chicago. IERC's analyses of this data confirms for the Illinois' elementary and middle schools what other recent research suggests: that principals who served as AP at their current school tend to show greater gains in student achievement\n\nBetter academic preparation. The research also shows that principals who earned master's or doctoral degrees from more academically rigorous institutions tended to work in schools with higher student achievement and helped to recruit teachers who also had stronger academic backgrounds.\n\nStudent Growth on Standardized Tests Currently Plays Small Role in Evaluating or Hiring Teachers\n\nPrincipals rate other factors higher. Many Illinois principals report that they fundamentally disagree with using student test scores and gains as central measures of school and teacher success.\n\nPrincipals surveyed were more likely to cite factors such as school climate, student attendance and quality of teacher applicants than student growth on test scores as important measures of school success. Even fewer principals said absolute student test scores were a very important measure of school success.\n\nPrincipals Struggle to Prioritize Tasks and Feel Less Effective at Tasks Research Suggests are Most Important\n\nMore than half of principals ranked instruction-related tasks like coaching teachers as their most important work, but less than a third felt very effective at doing it. A majority of principals felt effective at building internal relations, but only 13 percent ranked it as very important. Less than half of all principals felt effective hiring teachers or setting budgets, two tasks that research suggests are two roles where principal effectiveness is crucial to raising student achievement.\n\nThese findings, IERC representatives say, clearly point the need for more support to principals whose jobs are universally demanding and difficult. Among the report's recommendations:\n\nSupport and training to implement new teacher evaluation standards mandated by Illinois' Performance Evaluation Reform Act (PERA).\n\nMore training in research-based practices for teacher hiring.\n\nPrincipal mentoring and other programs to help new principals hit the ground running.\n\nEncourage retention of principals by helping them create positive school cultures and by giving them the authority and autonomy to run their schools.\n\nProfessional development in self-reported areas they identified as needing improvement, including data analysis and coaching teachers.\n\nThe Principal Report: The State of School Leadership in Illinois analyzed demographic and employment trends among more than 7,100 individuals serving as Illinois public school principals between 2001 and 2008, statistically modeled principal impact on student achievement and teacher qualification in over 3,600 Illinois public schools and surveyed more than one in five active public school principals in the 2010-2011 school year. Only charter schools were excluded from the analysis because their personnel are not consistently included in state records of educator employment.\n\nThe Illinois Education Research Council was established in 2000 at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to provide Illinois with education research to support P-20 education policy making and program development. The IERC undertakes independent research and policy analysis, often in collaboration with other researchers that informs and strengthens Illinois' commitment to providing a seamless system of educational opportunities for its citizens.\n\nSIUE Library & Information Increases its Digital Collection\n\nTo read about an \"Anthro-Choreo-Diva\" and a \"statue-as-queen\" or learn which\n\nstaff member left Shurtleff College in Alton in 1912 to become assistant superintendent of schools in Madison County, browse the two newest digital collections of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's Lovejoy Library.\n\nThe University's Library & Information Services recently made the Drumvoices Revue\n\npoetry anthologies and the Shurtleff College Retrospect yearbooks available online.\n\nDrumvoices Revue: A Confluence of Literary, Cultural and Vision Arts is a multicultural literary journal, published by SIUE in collaboration with the Eugene B. Redmond Writers Club of East St. Louis, according to Stephen Kerber, archivist and special collections librarian. The journal first appeared in Fall/Winter of 1991/92. Since its first publication, the poetry journal has been consistent with the Eugene B. Redmond (EBR) Writers Club's vision: \"To provide serious writers with a milieu, a Soular System, in which to learn, mature, share their works, receive and give criticism and eventually get published.\"\n\nPoems about many legendary figures, including Katherine Dunham, have been published in the journals. Dunham was recognized by EBR Writers Club President Darlene Roy as an \"Anthro-Choreo-Diva.\" The Club has also paid homage to its own, as in the case of the late Sheryl Johnson, whom Redmond himself described as a \"statue-as-queen.\"\n\nRedmond is an SIUE Emeritus Professor of English and editor of Drumvoices Revue. Redmond was named Poet Laureate of East St. Louis in 1976, the same year his best-selling critical history, Drumvoices: the Mission of African-American poetry was published. Redmond graduated from SIUE in 1964 in English Literature and Political Science. He holds a master's degree in English Literature from Washington University in St. Louis. Redmond co-founded the Eugene B. Redmond Writers Club in 1986, with Roy and Sherman L. Fowler.\n\nDigital Imaging Specialist Ginger Stricklin and Metadata and Cataloguing Librarian Mary Rose collaborated with Kerber to create the Drumvoices Revue digital collection.\n\nStricklin and Metadata and Cataloging Librarian Lynn Fields worked with Kerber to digitize the surviving copies of the Shurtleff College yearbook, the Retrospect.\n\nSIUE traces its lineage back to the campus grounds of Shurtleff College, a small Baptist school. John Mason Peck, a Baptist Missionary of Rock Springs Seminary, relocated the school to Alton in 1832. The seminary was renamed Shurtleff in 1836, after a wealthy contributor. Shurtleff served as a leading institution of higher learning in Southwest Illinois for more than a century. Its graduates became productive citizens of Alton, Madison County, the St. Louis region and the nation. Locally, Shurtleff staff member, Miss Uzzell, became the assistant superintendent of schools for Madison County.\n\nFinancial challenges forced the closure of Shurtleff College in spring 1957. By chance, its demise coincided with the establishment of SIUE. Under a lease/purchase agreement, the former Shurtleff grounds became the site of SIUE's Alton Residence Center that year and later developed into the University's School of Dental Medicine in 1972.\n\nThe digital collection is comprised of yearbooks for 1911-1932, 1938-1942 and 1948-1956. It also includes a supplement featuring the graduating class of 1957.\n\nSIUE East St. Louis Charter High School Team Places 5th In International Tourney\n\nThe Southern Illinois University Edwardsville East St. Louis Charter High School team finished among four finalists in the double elimination round of a recent international Botball competition of 63 teams. The competition was held earlier this month in Orange County, Calif., featuring teams from around the globe including Poland, Austria and Qatar.\n\nAccording to the KISS (Keep It Simple Students) Institute for Practical Robotics, a national non-profit educational organization, Botball is an educational robotics program that equips students with the skills, experience and opportunities required to design, build and program autonomous robots that are used in regional, national and international competitions.\n\nThe SIUE Charter High School team of five students also received a Judges' Choice Certificate: The Mars Rover Viking Award for \"achievement against great odds,\" because the school does not have a practice table, as do the majority of competing teams. Students from the Charter High School who attended included juniors Sergio Cole and Quewon Smith seniors Juliann Bynum, Jeremiah Rogers and Deborah Wilson.\n\n\"We're very proud of these kids,\" said Rebecca Bemrose-Fetter, a recent SIUE graduate with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering, who traveled with the students to the tournament and provided them with assistance. Bemrose-Fetter, who was with the SIUE Center for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Research, Education and Outreach for three years until she graduated in May, had used the botball platform in a class she took during her studies at SIUE.\n\nAlso traveling with the students were SIUE graduate assistant David Utoon-Owaji Brown, an electrical and computer engineering major who acted as a mentor to the students for several months, and Charter High School teacher Carolyn Kribs.\n\nThe Charter High School students had placed third in the double elimination round at the 2011 Greater St. Louis Botball Regional Tournament, which was held at SIUE, qualifying them to advance to the next level. The regional competition, hosted by KISS and the SIUE School of Engineering, featured 17 teams from four states.\n\n\"These competitions-and preparation for them-provide students with hands-on learning and skills development in engineering and computer science, as well as in all STEM disciplines,\" said Jerry Weinberg, acting associate provost for research and dean of the SIUE Graduate School. \"Furthermore, the students who participate benefit from working as a team to solve complex problems.\"\n\nWeinberg, who also is a professor of computer science at SIUE and who has served as department chair, organized the first regional competition five years ago. Student participation in the current competition was made possible by the SIUE schools of Education and Engineering, and the Graduate School, the SIUE Foundation, the office of the Provost and the STEM Center.\n\nBOT Awards $12,890,478 In Contracts For Two Construction Projects\n\nThe Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees today awarded $12,890,478 in contracts to 10 Illinois companies and two Missouri companies for two major building expansion projects on the SIU Edwardsville campus.\n\nThe projects include construction of the Charles and Mary Lukas Athletics Annex at the SIUE Vadalabene Center for additional Intercollegiate Athletics office space and the Art and Design Building expansion for additional studio, classroom and office space. Both actions took place at the board's regular meeting today, conducted this month on the SIU Carbondale campus.\n\nSome $4.2 million for construction of the 29,000-square-foot Athletics Annex is being funded by a gift from the Lukas Family. The remaining $554,789 of the cost will come from University Plant Funds. The project was approved by the Board at its February meeting.\n\nThe annex contracts were awarded to:\n\nContegra Construction Co. of Edwardsville; $3,690,000 for general contracting\n\nGuarantee Electrical Contractors of St. Louis; $364,574 for electrical work\n\nBi-State Fire Protection of St. Charles, Mo.; $98,785 for fire protection work\n\nAmsco Mechanical of Granite City; $123,000 for plumbing\n\nFrance Mechanical of Edwardsville; $478,400 for heating and ventilation work\n\nSome $8,135,719 in contracts also were awarded for construction of the 29,000-square-foot Art and Design West Building expansion project, which will include space for Art History, Art Therapy, and Art Education classrooms and offices. Those office and classrooms are now located elsewhere on the SIUE campus. The new addition also will include space for painting and drawing studios.\n\nThis project will allow the entire SIUE Department of Art and Design to be in one location. A second phase-construction of an enclosed bridge to connect the new building to the current Art and Design Building-will be considered by the board at a later date.\n\nThe Art and Design West contracts were awarded to:\n\nR.W. Boeker Company of Hamel; $5,857,060 for general contracting work\n\nJ.F. Electric of Edwardsville; $817,900 for electrical work\n\nSuperior Fire Protection Systems of Forsyth; $91,359 for fire protection work\n\nBergmann-Roscow Plumbing of Belleville; $252,500 for plumbing\n\nHock Mechanical of Millstadt; $279,900 for ventilaltion work\n\nFrance Mechanical Corp. of Edwardsville; $837,000 for heating work.\n\nFunding for the project will come from University Plant Funds. The project was approved by the board at its July 2010 meeting.\n\nIn other business today, the board gave project and budget approval to expand and renovate the SIUE Engineering Building, estimated to cost $12.6 million with another $1.6 million estimated for the renovation of the current Engineering Building. The expansion will provide more classroom and office space as well as teaching and research space to accommodate the growth in SIUE's enrollment. A planning study has recommended construction of a 32,000-square-foot building connected to the current building with an enclosed bridge as well as partial renovation to the current building.\n\nThe board also approved open-service contracts with hazardous materials abatement firms for various projects at SIUE. The firms are needed because of renovation projects involving 50-year-old buildings. University officials say that the need for such service is often immediate and the need for services is crucial to maintaining a safe work environment.\n\nIn another item affecting the SIUE campus, the board authorized the board's executive committee to award contracts related to the proposed construction of an indoor practice facility for the SIUE softball program. The estimated cost is $980,000 and would be funded through University Plant Funds and private gifts. The authorization has been given to award bids expected in August before the board meets again. Construction is estimated to be completion by January.\n\nSummer ShowBiz 2011 To Present 'The Music Man' July 13-17\n\nMeredith Willson's all-time American musical classic, The Music Man, is next on the bill for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's Summer Showbiz 2011, opening at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, July 13, at the theater in SIUE's Dunham Hall. With wonderful songs such as Seventy-six Trombones, Gary, Indiana, and Till There Was You, the citizens of River City, Iowa, will encounter a very special salesman-the loveable con-man Professor Harold Hill. The show continues at 7:30 Thursday-Saturday nights and at 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, July 16-17.\n\nOpening on Broadway in 1957, Willson's The Music Man won five Tony Awards including Best Musical and ran for 1,375 performances. In 1962, a film adaptation quickly became a hit as well and made Robert Preston a household name.\n\nThe story involves Hill as the fast-talking character who travels from small town to small town posing as a boys' band organizer who also happens to sell band instruments and uniforms. Once he has the townsfolks' money, off he scoots. His lucrative life takes a sudden tailspin when he meets his match-the lovely Marian, the local librarian, who sees through his act and is about to expose him when Hill's kindness toward her younger brother causes her to have second thoughts. To make Hill's situation even more complicated, he realizes that he is falling for Marian and she is falling in love with him. Is he willing to be exposed and captured to win her heart? Willson's skills as a songwriter and storyteller have made this 60-year-old hit musical an entertainment mainstay throughout most of the world.\n\nTickets are $15 for those 18 and older, while all other admissions are $12, including any students with valid student IDs. The SIUE Fine Arts box office, located in Room 1042B Dunham Hall, may be reached by phone, (618)-650-2774, or visit the website: www.siue.edu/summerarts.\n\nEach summer, the SIUE Department of Theater and Dance presents Summer Showbiz, a summer fare of two to three theatrical productions. Currently, the summer offering has grown to include Xfest, a four-day festival of experimental theater groups from around the country, and the Cougar Theater Company, the newly formed theater for young audiences, presenting classic folklore, literature, poetry and stories. The department is part of the SIUE College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe photo at right features cast members, from top, Roger Speidel as Professor Harold Hill, Spencer Burbach as little Winthrop, Emily Ottenwein as Mrs. Paroo, and (at right) Margaret French as Marian Paroo, the librarian. (SIUE Photo by Bill Brinson)\n\nSIUE Graduate School Chosen As CGS Research Partner On STEM Study\n\nThe Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) has selected Southern Illinois University Edwardsville among five universities across the nation as a research partner to participate in collecting information about how students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are prepared through master's programs.\n\nSIUE will join Loyola University in Chicago, Purdue University, Texas A&M University and Wright State University in collecting vital data about students seeking master's degrees in STEM disciplines. The awardees will collect data on completion and attrition in STEM master's degree programs; administer surveys to students, graduates and those who do not complete degrees, and conduct student focus groups. Additionally, awardees will survey graduate program directors.\n\nData collected will allow stakeholders to better understand reasons for enrollment, factors that contribute to student success and promising practices to improve completion. Insight gained from these activities can help ensure that U.S. graduate schools are preparing the necessary talent at the master's level in STEM fields to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n\nResearch Partners in the CGS project on Completion and Attrition in STEM Master's Programs will receive $30,000 to participate. CGS, an organization of more than 500 institutions of higher education in the U.S. and Canada, engages in graduate education, research and the preparation of candidates for advanced degrees. Among U.S. institutions, CGS members award 93 percent of doctoral degrees and 76 percent of master's degrees. The organization's mission is to improve and advance graduate education, which is accomplished through advocacy in the federal policy arena, research and the development and dissemination of best practices.\n\n\"A master's degree in a STEM field often offers a clear pathway to professional employment and career success,\" said Debra Stewart, CGS president. \"In this economy, more than ever, we need to better understand the factors affecting completion and attrition at the master's level.\n\n\"This will be the first study of its kind in the United States and we are delighted to work with these innovative graduate schools on this unique project. The results of this study will be information essential to graduate deans as they foster student achievement in graduate education.\"\n\nAdditional institutions will be invited to join in the research effort as unfunded Project Partners. The study's findings will be released in a monograph in 2013. A decision will be made on whether an in-depth follow-up project on master's completion and attrition is necessary. It is envisioned that a follow-up project would engage a much larger number of CGS member institutions to provide completion and attrition data, conduct surveys of entering students, graduates, and non-completers, and implement interventions that are designed to improve outcomes in master's programs.\n\nSIUE Named To 2010 Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville has been named by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to its list of colleges and universities demonstrating a commitment to volunteering, service-learning and civic engagement-this is the first time the University has been named to the distinction category.\n\nThe Corporation oversees the annual President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll in collaboration with the U.S. departments of Education, and Housing and Urban Development, as well as Campus Compact and the American Council on Education.\n\nSIUE students have many opportunities to work on service projects and in the area of volunteerism throughout the year through the University's Kimmel Leadership Development Center.\n\nEngagement activities such as service projects and volunteerism help students achieve personal, professional and leadership development objectives. These experiences, which take place on and off campus, are an important part of an SIUE student's education and foster academic and professional development.\n\nThe Kimmel Center, under the purview of the SIUE Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, offers co-curricular experiences that promote personal growth, develop self-confidence and leadership abilities, and prepare students for life-long learning.\n\n\"This national recognition is an honor, reflecting our commitment to creating a vibrant campus life, which includes civic engagement, service learning, community involvement and global citizenship,\" said SIUE Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Narbeth Emmanuel. \"While it is a further testament to our pledge to achieve excellence, more importantly, it recognizes the invaluable contributions of our students to serve their communities.\n\n\"It is a powerful promise to prospective students that SIUE fosters a climate where students become engaged and capable student leaders.\"\n\nThe Kimmel Center staff assists students with planning and coordinating programs that promote the educational, cultural and social enrichment of the University community. These events and programs include Welcome Week, Homecoming, Family Weekend, Black Heritage Month, International Night, Spring fest and Activities Fairs, among many others.\n\nMembers of SIUE Volunteer Services took part in numerous projects last fiscal year, with the majority of activities taking place Saturdays. Through Volunteer Services, students provide many area agencies with volunteer help. One agency, the Call for Help, Inc. Sexual Assault un"
