Ceremony.\n\nFor those joining us on livestream, greetings as well.\n\nYou may be seated.\n\nToday, we recognize the scholarship and dedication of our doctoral degree candidates and celebrate their achievement.\n\n(graduates applauding) Graduates, in a few minutes, I will introduce our honorary degree recipient and featured speaker, Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Investment Bank Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nAt a recent event focused on growing developing economies, he said that if you unlock entrepreneurship where the tools to unlock it are scarce, you can change the world.\n\nDoctoral candidates, I've had the opportunity to meet many of you since I arrived on campus.\n\nSome of you just last week at Cowles House as we began this week of celebration.\n\nAnd I can tell that you are passionate, dedicated, and resourceful scholars who are likewise focused on making a difference by taking on the grand challenges facing our society.\n\nWe are counting on you to not only contribute to solving the grand challenges of today, but identifying and developing a plan to solve the grand challenges of tomorrow.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nYou have already made a difference in the course of your doctoral studies.\n\nI've been privileged to work with and mentor many outstanding graduate students and I can attest to their importance to my success and that of a proud public research university like Michigan State University.\n\nYou have stepped beyond your roles of students to assume leadership in classrooms, laboratories, and in the spheres of your academic disciplines.\n\nYou support our research enterprise and faculty mentors by applying your perspectives to uncovering, analyzing, and presenting new information.\n\nYou have added the diversity of your unique backgrounds to the university's educational community as well as your scholarship.\n\nAmong this assembled group, you range in age from 24 to 69.\n\n(graduates applauding) And you represent 37 states and 31 countries.\n\n(graduates applauding) As one of the world's great research and land grant universities, it's in Michigan State's DNA to marshal cutting edge knowledge and innovation to address society's great challenges.\n\nAnd as emerging knowledge leaders, you are the next generation of teachers and doers fit to grapple with those challenges.\n\nSo graduates, thank you for your partnership and fulfilling this passionately public university's commitment to creating new knowledge and transforming lives.\n\nToday, one chapter in your life journey story might be closing, but another exciting chapter opens with new possibilities in an unfolding future.\n\nI'm confident that your MSU degrees will serve you well as you pursue your careers, whether in academia, industry, or government.\n\nAnd now, we ask our guests to join students and faculty in singing one stanza of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" performed by the MSU Wind Symphony under the direction of Professor Kevin Sedatole, professor and director of bands in the College of Music.\n\nThe singing will be led by Anna Jesko, a senior in music performance.\n\nWill you please rise as you're able?\n\nAnd upon conclusion of the singing, please remain standing for a moment of silence.\n\n(\"The Star-Spangled Banner\") ♪ Say, can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ♪ ♪ Through the perilous fight ♪ ♪ O'er the ramparts we watched ♪ ♪ Were so gallantly, yeah, streaming ♪ ♪ And the rockets' red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave ♪ (graduates applauding) - Thank you, Anna.\n\nAnd as you remain standing, I ask interim provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, Thomas Jeitschko to please join me at the lectern.\n\nOn this joyful occasion, let us also briefly acknowledge the fellow students you have lost along your journey to reach this moment.\n\nThose scholars are forever part of our Spartan family, so let us pause here for a moment of silence and remembrance.\n\nPlease be seated.\n\nInterim Provost Jeitschko will now present this afternoon's candidate for the awarding of their honorary degree.\n\n- Mr. Balogun, please come forward.\n\nPresident Guskiewicz, I have the honor to present Mr. Bolaji Balogun for awarding of the Honorary Degree Doctor of Business.\n\n(graduates cheering and applauding) - You are a highly accomplished and inspiring investment professional and entrepreneur who has committed your life to providing the knowledge of financial sustainability.\n\nYou have utilized your extensive background in investment banking to assist multiple corporations and serve on a variety of boards and groups.\n\nYou have shared your expertise in a range of settings through the instruction and leadership displayed as chief executive officer of Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nChief investment officer of the Nigeria Infrastructure Debt Fund, and your guidance as co-founder and director of Econet Wireless Nigeria.\n\nYour dedication to gender diversity, including your achievements of maintaining high levels of women employment at your firm and promotion of SME.eng, Nigeria's leading gender lens investing platform is an inspiration to all Spartans.\n\nFor your notable career in the investment sector and your time, expertise, advice, and dedication to Nigeria's success, I am pleased to award you an Honorary Doctor of Business Degree for Michigan State University.\n\n(graduates applauding) - Thank you very, very much.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, distinguished faculty members, proud parents, spouses, friends and family, and most importantly, the 2024 advanced degrees graduating class of MSU, good afternoon.\n\nI'm most delighted to be here today and I'm humbled to have this honor and privilege.\n\nLet me start first and foremost by thanking Dan Kelly, chair of the Board of Trustees and the trustees, President Guskiewicz, Interim Provost and executive vice president, Thomas Jeitschko, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, deans, and in particular, I want to highlight Steven Hanson, dean of the International Studies and Programs who I met in Nigeria in September, 2022.\n\nThank you, Steve, once again for your very kind letter when my late father and my life's inspiration, the Otunba Michael Olasubomi Balogun passed in May of 2023.\n\nDean Whipple of the Broad Business School, you've graciously hosted me this week and I want to thank you most sincerely and the school is in very, very thoughtful hands.\n\nI should also acknowledge Soji Adelaja.\n\nSoji is my initial connection to this school.\n\nJohn Hanna, distinguished professor in land policy, but more importantly for me, he's also the chairman of my board at Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nI want to commend all of the professors and faculty who have worked hard to producing all of you graduates who are seated in the hall here today.\n\nTo the parents, the spouses, partners, children, family, friends, and loved ones of today's graduates, your support is truly commendable.\n\nAs a father, I understand the commitment and sacrifice that some of you have made financially and through advice and mentoring.\n\nMy wife and biggest cheerleader, Kemi and two of our children, my daughters, Michelle and Marian are seated somewhere in the stands today.\n\nI'm so sorry that my other children and I'm a typical African father with a house full of kids, Michael, McKayla and Matthew, aren't with us today.\n\nIf I didn't acknowledge my late mom, I would be somewhat remiss.\n\nProfessor Oluwale Osisanya, my mother was a professor of English at the University of Lagos where she was on the faculty for 35 years.\n\nAnd she gave everything for my educational foundation and values.\n\nShe always hoped that after I got my economics degree at the London School of Economics, I would go on to do a master's and with a bit of luck, I might even get a doctorate.\n\nWell, not quite the way you imagine, mom, but nevertheless, I hope you are proud.\n\n(graduates applauding) To today's graduates, I congratulate you heartily, and you've worked very hard to earn your degree from a leading research institution.\n\nWith a stellar reputation, not only in the US but globally, but most especially in Africa.\n\nI commend your collective spirit, dedication and perseverance, which is what we're celebrating here today.\n\nFor many of us when we think about MSU, we see an institution that epitomizes that remarkable power, that education has to change lives.\n\nAnd given its rich tradition as a land grant university, the academic excellence, the innovative research and commitment to global engagement, I have found that MSU is the most impressive institution.\n\nIt is also the US University that is most engaged with Africa through the incredible work that is done here through by the Alliance for African Partnership.\n\nI spent the last couple of days on this most impressive campus and I've had the opportunity to interact with faculty and students here.\n\nAnd what has made an impression on me is a commitment that everyone has to producing well-rounded individuals who are equipped to make meaningful contributions to society.\n\nYour time at MSU has equipped each and every one of you with more than just knowledge and a doctorate.\n\nI believe it has provided you a diverse set of perspectives, practical learning, innovation, all of which are going to be invaluable as you embark on your next steps.\n\nI put it to you that you're all in that lesson.\n\n1% of people globally who have a doctoral degree.\n\nAnd you're both lucky and at the same time, under pressure to provide the less well-read, 99% of us with some leadership.\n\nAnd so what right does this Nigerian or African young man who didn't get a doctoral degree have to share these thoughts with you?\n\nSome of you may be wondering what next?\n\nArmed with your MSU PhD or doctoral degree, please allow me to share today no more than four pieces of useful or perhaps not so useful advice or life lessons.\n\nA potential pathway that might make the next few years and all the actions and decisions and investments that you make have a real impact.\n\nFirst piece of advice is work hard and enlarge your influence.\n\nSecondly, work smart and live a life of significance.\n\nThirdly, spend time with your loved ones and travel a lot with them as travel is the enemy of ignorance.\n\nFinal piece of advice, I want to speak to you about something that I truly believe will be a part of your future but only a few of us have in our contemplation.\n\nAnd this final piece of advice is that we all need an Africa plan.\n\nWork hard and enlarge your influence.\n\nYou'll find dependent on how old you are, that you only have no more than about 25 to 35 years to work hard before you start getting old and tired.\n\nDo not waste these years of your prime and use these years to enlarge your influence or your coast by being the very best version of whatever you do.\n\nI believe that a few things make us truly influential.\n\nKnowledge, success, innovation, entrepreneurship, relationships, and charity.\n\nMy second piece of advice today is work smart but live a life of significance.\n\nThe quickest path to these things I've just spoken about is to work not just hard but smart and live a life of meaning or purpose or significance.\n\nYou need not be a wealthy entrepreneur or banker or tech entrepreneur or investor or property owner or politician or farming business owner or a creative genius or even a sports star to live a life of significance.\n\nIt is a choice that we all make, whether in a long career in academia or in medicine or in charitable work or not-for-profit or for that matter, in God's work or as a spouse or as a father, a sibling, mentor, that your life will be impactful in your community, state, country or the world.\n\nAnd that when you finally bow out, it is said that you have lived a life of significance.\n\nLet me encourage us all to spend time with our loved ones and travel a lot with them.\n\nAs travel is the enemy of ignorance.\n\nThis time is truly priceless and you cannot make up for it or reinvent it at the end of your career or later in life.\n\nTravel together and see the world and not just visit New York or Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Dallas, Boston, Nashville and Atlanta, but go to Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThey're just a shot hop away from you.\n\nEurope and the UK also offers something different, history and culture wise, but you've only lived a well-rounded life when you've traveled to or visited Asia, the Middle East, Israel and Africa, especially Nigeria.\n\n(graduates laughing) (graduates applauding) Now, when I speak of Africa, I'm not referring to a singular country or big village where everyone knows everyone as some belief.\n\nRather, I'm speaking about 54 countries with diverse cultures, languages, and governments.\n\nLet me also clear this up, that stepping out of an African airport doesn't mean having to dodge lions or a few animals and the occasional cheetah.\n\nYes, the wildlife in Africa is unmatched and impressive, but you're most likely to experience a traffic jam and lots of color on your daily commute.\n\nAs a financier, I'm going to speak to you about Africa in numbers.\n\nI truly believe that demography is destiny.\n\nAfrica is 10% of the world's population today, but when you all retire later this century, it could be 1/3 of the world's population.\n\nThat population will not be isolated from you.\n\nAnd already, Africans have migrated across the world and are integrated in every major economy globally.\n\nOne in four babies are African.\n\nOne in 10 babies born in the world today are Nigerian.\n\nBy the end of this century, the share of the world's babies born in sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to reach 55% from 30% in 2021.\n\nThis transition is inevitable.\n\nLet me also talk about your 401k.\n\n(graduates laughing) When you start accumulating your 401k, you will find that you're immediately invested in Africa as every major global company is already there.\n\nCoca-Cola and PepsiCo are available throughout the continent as are Visa and MasterCard, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta are all investing on the continent.\n\nThe largest American reese, American Towers and Equinix data centers are huge in Africa and all the major resource companies are in Africa.\n\nBy the time you retire, I predict that your 401k will have African homegrown brands like MTN, Dangote, Access, and Florida Wave as behemoths in your portfolio.\n\nLet me talk to you about the African free trade zone.\n\nThis is the largest of its kind covering 54 countries, and by the second half of this century, it will also cover a third of the world's population.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimate that this free trade zone could be 50% larger than the European Union by 2075, but that analysis excludes Africa's diaspora or international GDP.\n\nWhich if you were like Mexico, to infer that diaspora remittances are somewhere around 11 to 12 times what diaspora GDP could be already suggests that Africans in diaspora today may represent 40% of total African spending power.\n\nWe're all taught that infrastructure has a huge multiplier impact on GDP and in creating jobs and opportunities.\n\nBut the impacts of the first or early infrastructure investments in your community can be catalytic.\n\nPutting electricity into Africa or mobile phones as we did in January of 2001, Internet access, roads is much larger than simply upgrading your 4G coverage to 5G basic infrastructure is already unleashing a continent and the growth rates will reflect that.\n\nLet me talk about something that I'm very passionate about, which is climate.\n\nAnd if Africa were to develop like the rest of the US or the rest of the OECD over the next quarter of a century, the carbon per capita that will be delivered will destroy the world's climate targets.\n\nAnd in order to build a low carbon development future, Africa requires capital and know-how along with its abundant resources for the energy transition.\n\nI'm sure some of you would've studied statistics and we're all taught that risks are balanced like a bell curve, positives and negatives.\n\nAnd in hindsight, the development of China, India, or Indonesia over the last 25 years has been inevitable.\n\nAnd the same trends apply today all across Africa.\n\nPopulation growth, low leverage, low dependency ratios, high growth, cheap valuations has made this an asymmetric one-way bet.\n\nAnd Africa today is no different.\n\nAnd I truly believe that Africa can feed the world, resource the world, and power large parts of the world, support the world, entertain the world.\n\nIt's already doing that.\n\nHow many of you know about Burna Boy?\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd Africa, in NBA terms, can also beat the world.\n\nAfrica's narrative about Africa is becoming more reflective of its truth and the continent is rapidly emerging a global powerhouse.\n\nIt has 65% of the world's arable land and 60% of the world's uncultivated land.\n\nAnd I believe an institution like MSU can have such a remarkable role to play in Africa's future.\n\nWhen one considers this alongside the increasing focus on sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nI truly believe that Africa can solve the world's food security challenges over the next 25 years and that will be made possible by intersecting that with the sort of global expertise that exists in this university, in biotechnology, in the agricultural sciences, in land policy and in supply chain management.\n\nAfrica, you may not know, is home to 30% of the world's mineral resources, but it only accounts for about 10% of global mining exploration spend.\n\nAnd what that suggests is that there could be much more significant on verified additional reserves across the continent.\n\nBut what we do know today is that the continent is home to around 65% of EV minerals.\n\nLithium, cobalt, graphite, manganese, all of those things that will be necessary for powering our electric vehicles over the next 30 to 50 years.\n\nAnd Africa's untapped potential for renewable energy sources is compelling.\n\nIt's also home to 60% of the best solar resources in the world.\n\nAnd it said that a small part of the Sahara desert could power all of Europe and certainly, all of the world could be powered from the Sahara Desert.\n\nBut not only does it have incredible solar potential, it also has tremendous wind potential and hydropower potential.\n\nBut above all things, 60% of Africa's population is under the age of 25, and Nigeria, the country that I come from has an average age of just short of 19 years old.\n\nThe economic rise of China and India were the first great shocks of this century, and Africa's rising useful tide will almost likely drive the next seismic shift.\n\nAfrica is changing so rapidly that it's becoming very, very hard to ignore and the world is becoming more African said, a recent New York Times headline, \"The world is changing and we need to reimagine Africa's place in it.\"\n\nSo as you start this new journey, remember that with every change, there are always opportunities to explore.\n\nLet me ask each and every one of you to be bold, resilient, embrace diversity, show empathy, stand strong, and always strive for a more equitable and prosperous future for all.\n\nThere might be times you fail or face challenges that seem insurmountable, but your indomitable Spartan spirit has been nurtured within these halls of learning and I hope that you'll find the strength to keep moving and succeed.\n\nToday, you are not just advanced degree graduates of Michigan State University, you are global citizens.\n\nPoised to make a difference in the world.\n\nCongratulations, class of 2024.\n\nThe world is yours to shape and to improve.\n\nNever forget that the impossible is the untried.\n\nSo let me encourage each and every one of you to go out and make a difference.\n\nThank you all and Godspeed.\n\nGo Green.\n\n- [Graduates] Go White.\n\n(graduates applauding) - [Bolaji] Thank you very much - Bolaji Balogun, thank you.\n\nAnd I enjoyed your inspiring words of wisdom and advice to our doctoral graduates and as I said on Wednesday in our meeting, I very much look forward to visiting you in Nigeria and strengthening our alliance for

Graduates will now be individually hooded by their faculty member.\n\nThis solemn ceremony and the moment of Hooding represents a transition to the company of learned society, of one's discipline or field of study.\n\nThe moment of the hooding by one's academic mentor is the culmination of years of study and the welcome by your mentor into a new role, that of an intellectual colleague.\n\nAs such, this tradition and our academic rituals are imbued with great relevance and solemnity.\n\nI invite everyone who witnesses the hooding to think deeply about the candidates as they approach the dais, are hooded, and turn to walk forward.\n\nThink of the individual scholar and how great universities like MSU foster the circumstances and culture for academic advancement and excellence.\n\nI thank our doctoral students for their contributions as MSU scholars and congratulate them on the conferral of their doctoral hood.\n\nAll members of this graduating class are part of the Spartan

diploma is presented and photos are taken.\n\nJody Noel and Scott Poll will announce the names of graduates as they receive their diplomas.\n\nI now ask the associate deans of the colleges to please lead their graduates to the platform.\n\n- The academic attire worn by students and faculty was first used in 12th and 13th century Europe.\n\nThe current system in the United States was designed in 1895 and is today used in advanced degree ceremonies across the country.\n\nThe hoods being placed on the doctoral candidates are derived from the design of medieval monks' cloaks.\n\nThe three chevrons on the sleeve represent doctor of philosophy.\n\nThe light blue velvet on the front signifies doctor of education.\n\nThe pink velvet on the front signifies doctor of musical arts and the apricot velvet on the front signifies doctor of nursing practice.\n\nThe green and white chevrons on each hood represent Michigan State University.\n\nThe cap, the gown, and especially the hood represent both the responsibility and the freedom that accompany the achievements in research and scholarship that these candidates have earned through years of hard work.\n\nThe ceremony of hooding doctoral candidates symbolizes the faculty welcoming these students as our full fledged colleagues.\n\n- [Announcer] From the College of Music, Ryan Fellman, hooded by Dr. Sandra Snow.\n\n(graduates
