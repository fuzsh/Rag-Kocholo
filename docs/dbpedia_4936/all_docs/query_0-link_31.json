        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nSee also: Part One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Four\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/the-magic-factory-part-four-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-individual-films-and-miscellaneous-titles/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nV. Screenwriters and Screenwriting\n\nWhen I refer to myself as an anti-auteurist I realize I may be creating some confusion, since it should be obvious to the casual reader of these pages that I also honor a number of favored filmmakers. Most of these, however, are or were either writer-directors (Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Preston Sturges, John Huston, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, Samuel Fuller, Blake Edwards, Paul Mazursky, Robert Benton, Oliver Stone); directors who could have taken screenwriter credit on almost any movie they made, and sometimes did (David Lean, Peter Bogdanovich, Sidney Lumet); almost never did (Alfred Hitchcock); never did (Leo McCarey, Howard Hawks); or who habitually worked closely with screenwriters to develop the movies they directed (Ford, Cukor, William Wyler, Martin Ritt, John Schlesinger). Perhaps it’s a limitation in me, but I have never been able to fathom how so many movie critics could embrace the misrepresentation of the French theory — which was far more selective and referred only to certain filmmakers — and warp it, as Andrew Sarris did, to suggest that every movie director is the “author” of any picture he or she makes. And my mystification is centered on one simple fact: That critics are writers too. Why are they so hot to strip the credit from others?\n\nAs a result of this madness, any hack or beginner can slap a possessive credit on a movie, even if the script he’s shooting is the seventeenth draft of a screenplay that’s been re-written by a dozen different writers, only two or three of whom will likely be credited. Look up any movie title on any online search engine and when it pops up the first entry will read, “A film by…” Nearly as bad, even as great a home video producer as Criterion reflexively places either that or an apostrophe and an “s” on the cover of every disc, even when to do so is patently absurd, as in its release of the 1952 The Importance of Being Earnest which it describes as “Anthony Asquith’s.” Surely the possessive attribution is due to Oscar Wilde? After all, even the New Testament admits that in the beginning was the word. But then the Word was God’s, and for an auteurist that can only mean a director.\n\n48. Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting William Goldman (1983)\n\nIt is entirely appropriate that the first volume on this list be Goldman’s, because no other screenwriter had or has ever written a book which became, and so quickly, immortal, at least in Hollywood. Goldman had already bequeathed to the world an epigraph — “Follow the money” — that is now so much a part of the common language it is routinely cited in reference to corruption by people who have no idea what its provenance is. (And it was Goldman, not “Deep Throat,” who came up with the phrase, in his screenplay for All the President’s Men.) To this he added a new one, which caught on so quickly it’s employed by the very sort of smug people its author was talking about when he first wrote it: In coining the dictum “Nobody knows anything,” Goldman was asserting that, essentially, all movies that become hits, unless they are sequels to other hits, are what is dismissively referred to as a “non-recurring phenomenon.” No one ever knows what will succeed, or fail, and those who think they do are in for some nasty surprises. Goldman also wrote a tertiary epigraph which is much less often quoted, but which should be tattooed on the inner eyelids of every screenwriter: “Screenplays are structure.” But they are not, as so many ignoramuses aver, “blueprints.” Change a blueprint while you’re building and see how well the construction stands.\n\nYou may agree or disagree with Goldman’s other observations (I for instance love the movie the writer/director Philip Kaufman made from Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, and would not have wanted to see the flag-waving version Goldman wrote) or see him as a facile, talented smart-ass. I don’t know how his novels, which I began to devour at age 15, might read for a younger audience, but I like his writing, both for print and movies, too much to find fault with much of it, although I do admit to being one of the few people I know who isn’t gaga over the movie of The Princess Bride, perhaps because I cherish the novel. In any case, it’s a safe bet no screenwriter will ever create, with a book, the stir Goldman did with this one.\n\n49. Backstory 1: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood’s Golden Age / Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s / Backstory 3: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 60s and Backstory 4: Interviewers with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s Edited by Patrick McGilligan (1988 – 2006)\n\nOne of our finest biographers of moviemakers, McGilligan also conducted (or edited those conducted by others) dozens of interviews with American screenwriters and published these in five volumes over 21 years. The Backstory series includes discussions with Niven Busch, Alan Scott (author or co-writer of many of the witty scripts for the Astaire-Rogers pictures), Donald Ogden Stewart, Philip Dunne, Julius J. Epstein, Richard Maibaum, Leigh Brackett, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Garson Kanin, Arthur Laurents, the blacklisted Ben Maddow, Stewart Stern, the ubiquitous blacklistee front Philip Yordan, Jay Presson Allen, George Axelrod, Walter Bernstein, Hitchcock’s great 1950s screenwriter John Michael Hayes, Ring Lardner Jr., Richard Matheson, Wendell Mayes, Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., Sterling Silliphant, Terry Southern, Robert Benton, Blake Edwards, Walter Hill, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Elmore Leonard, Paul Mazursky, Frederic Raphael, Alvin Sargent and Donald E. Westlake. That’s practically the entire history of the talkies to the turn of the century.\n\nI have not read McGilligan’s 2009 volume (Backstory 5: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1990s) largely because I have so little interest in movies of the 1990s. Once, in real time, was more than sufficient.\n\n50. Talking Pictures: Screenwriters in the American Cinema Richard Corliss (1975)\n\nUnique in its time, and even to today, Corliss’ second book on movie writers is a perceptive series of essays grouping together scenarists and their representative scripts — a sort of critical bestiary of screenwriters. Amid Corliss’ piquant observations: Anent the 1970 movie of MASH for which the blacklisted Ring Lardner, Jr. won an Oscar, that the much-loved Hawkeye and Trapper John often behave like fraternity bullyboys, no better than their adversaries and in some ways worse. Among his discoveries: That letters form such a strong narrative thread in the movies written or co-authored by Howard Koch (such as Casablanca) they are almost a personal signature.\n\nSee also: The Hollywood Screenwriters (A Film Comment Book) Richard Corliss (1972) The first of Corliss’ books on screenwriting is a collection of essays and interviews which, in Dr. Roseanne Welch’s apt words, “was a seminal work… in terms of bringing the screenwriter out from under the director’s shadow following a decade of auteurist criticism run rampant.” Frustratingly, in a 1990s issue of Film Comment Corliss repudiated his own 1970s defense of screenwriters. Oh, well; he also around that time began using the teenage neologism “way” in place of the perfectly acceptable and grammatically effective “much,” “far” and “more” which had sufficed for centuries. As, alas, did every other adult in America.\n\n51. The Hollywood Writers’ Wars Nancy Lynn Schwartz; Completed by Sheila Schwartz (1982)\n\nIf there is an essential volume of screenwriting history, the Schwartzes’ book is it. A wide-ranging account of the oft-thwarted attempt of a majority of scenarists to set up a union, the vicious opposition of the studios — which set up Screen Playwrights, their own, reactionary union, one most writers, quite properly, disdained or chafed under the yoke of — and the ultimate triumph of the Screen Writers Guild. The only sad thing about The Hollywood Writers’ Wars is that its author did not live to complete it, dying in agony of a brain tumor at an obscenely young age.\n\n52. Laughing Matters: On Writing M*A*S*H, Tootsie, Oh, God! and a Few Other Funny Things Larry Gelbart (1998)\n\nWith the possible exceptions of Ben Hecht and Billy Wilder, I don’t know of a wittier American writer of screenplays than Larry Gelbart, or a more verbally elegant one. (As a playwright and librettist he was scarcely less impressive, writing with Burt Shevelove the achingly funny book for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and, solo, the hilarious one for the Cy Coleman musical City of Angels, the great Iran-Contra satire Mastergate, the funny and terrifying Power Failure and the Volpone-inspired Sly Fox, the single funniest playscript I’ve ever read.) Although his range was great his comic work is marked by two related attributes: His general literacy, and his gift for malaprop, usually in the service of overturning a verbal cliché. Recently, while watching a DVD of sketches from “Caesar’s Hour” I heard a line that I would be willing to bet money was Gelbart’s: Caesar, playing a vaudeville hoofer, avers that he’s a great dancer because “I’ve got ten toes in my heart.” Although he seldom received solo credit as a screenwriter — Oh, God! was a notable exception — Gelbart’s writing infused the projects on which he worked with sparkling wit and a seriousness of purpose that is at the root of all great comedy. His memoir is an unalloyed delight.\n\nSee also: Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood Arthur Laurents (2000) Laurents virtually defined the word “prickly,” his later dogmatism sometimes destroying decades-long friendships. He was also, as a playwright, librettist and screenwriter, seldom as great as one hoped he would be. On the other hand, he was associated with three musical classics (West Side Story, Anyone Can Whistle and, especially, Gypsy) and wrote two exceptional screenplays whose subsequent movies their respective directors fucked up through insecurity and compromise: The Turning Point and The Way We Were. Whatever his flaws as a human being, Laurents’ memoir is an eye-opener, fascinating, articulate and compelling.\n\n53. Mad as Hell: The Life and Work of Paddy Chayefsky Shaun Considine (1994)\n\nOf all American playwrights and screenwriters, few were as drunk on words as Paddy Chayefsky. In the 1970s, going to see a movie written by Chayefsky (who was without a doubt the auteur of those pictures) was an exhilarating experience, the writers’ mordant wit and “outrageous” point of view, wedded to his dazzling verbosity, combining to give viewers almost an entirely new genre, something we might call rhetorical slapstick. Although Pauline Kael for one accused Chayefsky of being a reactionary, I don’t think she quite understood his position as a satirist. (Although certainly he behaved like a reactionary the night Vanessa Redgrave made her … is “ill-considered” the correct word?… acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.) Initially celebrated as the poet of kitchen-sink drama for television plays like “Marty” and “The Mother,” Chayefsky gradually began to explore larger ideas, and social comedy, and his dialogue became more expansive, less realistic and far more memorable. So memorable, in fact, that even when a broad audience embraced his expression, it didn’t always understand what he had in mind; in 1976, “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!” became the watch-cry of Americans who were fed up with… well, just about everything. What the people who repeated the phrase didn’t quite understand was that the aphorism was uttered in Network by an unbalanced schizophrenic. Considine does an admirable job of research and writing, capturing a nonpareil in all his nettlesome genius.\n\n54. The Craft of the Screenwriter: Interviews with Six Celebrated Screenwriters John Brady (1982)\n\nBrady’s splendid book consists of long and free-ranging interviews with five of the great screenwriters of the era and one interloper whose scant worth to movie history has, I think, been proven over time…and I am not referring to Paddy Chayefsky, William Goldman, Ernest Lehman, Neil Simon or Robert Towne. Interestingly, the most informative chapter for me as a young playwright was the Simon interview, which I hadn’t expected to enjoy as much as did, or to find so useful in a practical sense. (The book was published long before the emergence of the mature Simon of Lost in Yonkers, remember.) I only regret that Brady didn’t know, as no one did until fairly recently, that Edward Taylor co-authored every script Robert Towne took solo credit for. I haven’t pulled The Craft of the Screenwriter down from the shelf in years, so it will be interesting to re-read that interview in light of what Sam Wasson dug up on the matter for his book on Chinatown.\n\n55. What Happens Next: A History of American Screenwriting Marc Norman (2008)\n\nAn engaging, unusually intelligent history of screenwriting by a screenwriter, which may be a first. Norman, who wrote the vastly entertaining novel (and subsequent movie) Oklahoma Crude and later won an Oscar for a romantic comedy about Shakespeare I haven’t seen due to what I consider an impossible imbecility at its core (Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate’s Daughter indeed!) not only provides a rich, spirited novelistic history of the screenwriter in Hollywood but, as his title suggests, the contours of his craft: The what-happens-next? of celluloid storytelling.\n\nSee also: Some Time in the Sun: The Hollywood Years of F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Nathaniel West, Aldous Huxley and James Agee Tom Dardis (1976) Dardis’ book is especially useful for its debunking of the legend that surrounds Fitzgerald’s late Hollywood period, written as a refutation of Aaron Latham’s myth-reinforcing book Crazy Sundays.\n\nVI. Screenplays\n\nIn the 1970s, when “film studies” was everywhere, screenplays got published at a dizzying rate. Some now make one scratch one’s head in bemusement (Cisco Pike? Little Fauss and Big Halsey? Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid? Two-Lane Blacktop???) Others, like Easy Rider, were cutting continuity scripts, difficult to read… if you wanted to read the screenplay of Easy Rider, and I can’t imagine who would. The most enjoyable, like Goldman’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, were written to be read and are less concerned with outlining elaborate tracking shots (which anyway the director is going to ignore when he comes to shoot the thing) than with establishing and prolonging humor, mood and suspense. The best, such as those in the University of Wisconsin Warner Brothers series, contained long, informative histories of the pictures themselves and many frame blow-ups. But there were those who felt the practice of putting screenplays into print was a dubious idea at best; Larry McMurtry, himself a screenwriter, disdained them as “non-books.” He may have had a point.\n\nI admit I read them less often now than I did when I was an adolescent and becoming besotted with movies, needing movie books the way a dope-fiend needs a fix. But the best of them are pleasant keepsakes of movies that meant, and mean, something to me.\n\n56. The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay with Commentary on Every Scene, Interviews, and Little-Known Facts Jenny Jones, ed. (Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo) 2007\n\nI wish Jones would repeat this for The Godfather Part II, without doubt the finest sequel ever made to an already magnificent American movie. Otherwise, I have no complaints. It’s interesting, in light of so many auteurist directors taking the possessive line, that The Godfather pictures have all borne the credit “Mario Puzo’s.” Coppola, and Paramount, knew, at least in 1972, that Puzo’s was the name (other than Brando’s) the millions of readers of the novel were looking for in those posters and advertisements.\n\n57. Best American Screenplays 2 Sam Thomas, ed. (1991) Thomas edited three omnibus screenplay collections covering a wide range of genres. The second volume is the finest by a hair and includes My Man Godfrey, Citizen Kane, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Some Like it Hot, Terms of Endearment, The Lion in Winter, Julia and The Sting. Best American Screenplays (1985), the first volume includes of The Graduate, Sounder, Arthur and The Candidate and Best American Screenplays 3 1995 brings together The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Sunset Boulevard, Tender Mercies, Double Indemnity, Harold and Maude and Unforgiven. Although some of these classics have since been published separately most have not, so this trio constitutes a vest-pocket library of great American scenarios.\n\n58. Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot – The funniest film ever made: The complete book Alison Castle, ed; Interviews by Dan Aulier (Screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) (2002)\n\nWhen I was 15 I found a copy of the old Signet paperback edition of the Some Like it Hot screenplay in a second-hand bookshop. Reading it that afternoon, I quite literally fell off the family sofa. I had never read a funnier script before, and have only read one since that was as funny (Larry Gelbart’s play Sly Fox). Some Like it Hot was the favorite movie I’d never seen for years before I finally caught it at a university screening in the 1980s. It has since become my favorite movie, period. So you can imagine with what trembling anticipation I learned of this Taschen book, and how nearly orgasmic my pleasure on receiving it. The ne plus ultra of books devoted to a specific movie, this is a glorious package supplemented by interviews and limned by wonderful photographs and other graphics, with that great Wilder/Diamond screenplay at its center.\n\n59. The Big Brass Ring: An Original Screenplay Orson Welles and Oja Kodar (1987)\n\nIn the years before his death, Welles was shopping this incisive political thriller around Hollywood, hoping to snare one of the then-biggest male stars (Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty) to take the leading role of William Blake Pellarin, a gubernatorial candidate treading dangerous lines of intrigue and obsessed by the young beauty with whom he once had an incandescent affair. While interested, none of the actors he sought would bite, using the excuse that they couldn’t afford to cut their price for a single movie (not even one to be directed by Orson Goddamned Welles!) when one suspects the thing that really unnerved them was the presence in the scenario of Kim Minnaker, the politico’s mentor, an ageing gay man fighting his own, unrequited desire for his old student. That would have been, and should have been, the Welles role, as the girl would have been his companion and collaborator Oja Kodar’s. Frustratingly, it was never to be; Welles died without a deal… which in Hollywood I suppose means you’re really dead. But his and Kodar’s screenplay is marvelous: Witty, erudite, intelligent and, in the sequence in which Minniker, riding a Ferris wheel outside Blake’s hotel, is stopped just outside the window where, in agony, he watches the younger man having sex with his beloved, incendiary. It’s a shocking moment and one can only imagine, with regret, what Welles would have done with it, both as director and as actor. If you’ll pardon my quoting from my own centenary essay on Welles, “In a moment as sexually charged as anything in American movies, Pellarin becomes aware of this scrutiny, and his eyes lock with Minnaker’s. The description of this emotionally naked encounter, in the published script, is among the most breathtaking I’ve ever encountered in dramatic literature; it should have burned holes in the screen.”\n\n60. The Bonnie & Clyde Book David Newman & Robert Benton (1972)\n\nNo movie of the late-1960s aside from Midnight Cowboy (and, peripherally, The Wild Bunch, which wasn’t nearly as popular) had more of an impact on the American popular culture than Bonnie & Clyde, even if many Americans were unaware of them as the changes were happening. There was outrage at the form the picture took, seeming to be a comedy and abruptly exploding into bloody violence at mid-point, with considerably more to follow before the astonishing finale. The director, Arthur Penn, got much of the credit (and the blame) for the style, and certainly he and Dede Allen, the editor, were responsible for the movie’s electrifying kineticism. But so was Warren Beatty, who produced Bonnie and Clyde, starred as Clyde Barrow and hired everyone else involved, including Penn. (On the debit side, Beatty was also responsible for indications of Barrow’s homosexuality being removed from the picture.) But Bonnie & Clyde was a writer’s picture, or a writers’ picture, since it was entirely the product of two young men. Newman and Benton had been making a name for themselves as clever young Esquire magazine art directors and copywriters when they collaborated on the B & C screenplay and tried to get it made by François Truffaut. Beatty and Penn had enormous input into the original authors’ revisions to their script, and of course Penn was rightly praised for how he shot and, with Allen, edited the material. But Bonnie & Clyde is prima facie evidence against the idiotic American concept of all-movies-belong-solely-to-directors auteurism. Everyone contributed to the success of B & C, not only at the box office (when Beatty pressured Jack Warner to re-release it after a disappointing early run and it caught on the second time around) but in fashion, the honing of opinion among younger critics, the depiction of screen violence and the opening up of what was permitted generally in the most influential of the popular arts.\n\nSee also: Two for the Road Frederic Raphael (1967) Stanley Donen also got credit for the shattered temporal structure of this alternatively dark and charming romantic comedy, but the script was written that way from its inception. Raphael makes this abundantly clear in his introduction, and refutes with evidence the notion that Donen was in any way the progenitor of what, apart from the lovely starring performances by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney (and the nifty Henry Mancini score) made the picture so memorable. Herein lies a lesson for every TV-commercial wizard who slaps a possessive credit on his first, usually rotten, movie.\n\n61. Casablanca: Script and Legend Howard Koch (and Julius & Philip Epstein) 1973 (Expanded edition, 1995) Although Koch was one of three credited scenarists on Casablanca, it was he who wrapped the published screenplay within his own reminiscence of its complex creation, filming, initial success and enduring popular repute. (Three years earlier he had done a similar job on The Panic Broadcast, a book reprinting his script, heavily doctored and improved by Orson Welles, for the phenomenal 1938 “War of the Worlds” broadcast, a publishing event about which Welles was none too happy.) The most important aspect of the Casablanca book, of course, is the Casablanca script, which despite its romantic excesses — courtesy of the un-credited Casey Robinson — remains one of the wittiest and most quotable screenplays ever written for an American classic.\n\nSee also: Casablanca: The 50th Anniversary Edition (1992) The Koch and Epstein screenplay sans Koch’s memoir.\n\n62. The Citizen Kane Book Orson Welles and Herman L. Mankiewicz; Pauline Kael (1971)\n\nFew essays on the popular arts were more widely read, and fewer created more unnecessary controversy, than Pauline Kael’s “Rising Kane” in The New Yorker, which she later made the centerpiece of her book publishing the original screenplay by Orson Welles and Herman J, Mankiewicz along with the cutting continuity of what was then being routinely called “the greatest movie ever made.” It’s a typically witty, informative Kael essay but filled with inaccuracies, particularly about Welles’s contributions to the script. (Among her sources was John Houseman, Welles’ one-time producer and later deadly enemy, who must have relished the opportunity to deny Welles writing credit for his most well-regarded picture.) Kael’s essay was so persuasive it even fooled the redoubtable Kenneth Tynan, up to then a lifetime Welles acolyte. What was curious about “The Kane Mutiny,” as Peter Bogdanovich wittily dubbed it in Esquire, is that Kael was also a strong public admirer of Welles’ work as a filmmaker, particularly at a time when most of the press was ignoring him entirely. It must have galled him that the screenplay he and Mankiewicz wrote was forever wedded to an essay hot to prove he didn’t deserve much credit for the writing. Kael’s piece is still worth reading, provided you know how to refute it, and that screenplay still well worth studying, in whatever format. The advantage of having the shooting script yoked to the continuity is that this allows you to confirm at a glance which lines and sequences were dropped, or altered by Welles and his Mercury Theatre actors, during the filming.\n\n63. Greed: A Film by Erich von Stroheim (1979)\n\nOne of the great, mutilated masterworks, Greed was famously (or infamously) chopped down by MGM to 140 minutes from an 8-hour first cut by its writer/director, the genuinely visionary Erich von Stroheim. That Stroheim was extravagant is an understatement, but he was not foolish enough to believe a major Hollywood movie studio would release a picture of that length, although he (like Robert Altman later with his unrealized movie of E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime and Claude Lanzmann with his overrated and exhausting 9-hour Shoah) wanted a two-part movie audiences would have to see in separate screenings. A 1999 Turner Entertainment “reconstruction,” which runs 239 minutes is, like the 1984 A Star is Born restoration, filled out with stills and is based on Herbert G. Weinberg’s coffee table book The Complete Greed, now quite rare. The Lorimer text, cited here, is a less profligately illustrated but more affordable means of judging what Stroheim had in mind. At least you should have an easier time getting your hands on a copy than you will finding the Turner Greed, for which, startlingly, there has never been a DVD release.\n\n64. JFK: The Book of the Film – The Documented Screenplay Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar (1992)\n\nPrior to JFK, Stone was a media darling for the 1986 Platoon in spite of the fact that nearly all American newspapers and magazines pushed the Vietnam war until it became fashionable to condemn it, and the 1987 Wall Street, because everyone but a fiscal vulture can feel virtuous critiquing rapacious capitalism. Born on the Fourth of July didn’t hurt his media reputation either. But challenging the Warren Report? How very dare he? An early draft of the screenplay was leaked to the press while the picture was shooting, and the battle was on. Despite the nearly constant barrage of negative press, broadside reviews and colloquies by the usual talking heads condemning Stone, and his film, the picture took off into the stratosphere to such a degree that Congress passed The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 as a result. (Not that this has led to much of anything.) As a result of the false, hysterical claims against JFK, when they came to publish their screenplay Stone and his collaborator Zachary Sklar prepared a fully annotated edition which refuted many of the lies and much of the mythology the CIA-infiltrated American media still pushes on an increasingly credulous population concerning the very public murder of an American president.\n\n65. The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction Orson Welles; Robert L. Carringer, ed. (1993)\n\nWhenever I consider the violence done to what on the evidence was almost certainly Orson Welles’ masterpiece as a writer/director, I get physically ill. Not only because what still exists of Ambersons is so brilliant, or even because its mutilation savaged Agnes Moorehead’s still-astonishing performance, but because of the damage it did to its maker. “They destroyed it,” he once said, “and it destroyed me.” “They” is of course RKO, which used Welles’ being in South America at government request as an excuse to first disfigure his movie by removing more than 40 minutes from it and, later, after he’d been ousted from the studio, to obliterate the negative and even the preview print, leaving us an hour and 20 minutes of tattered glory beyond the means of rescue. Carringer’s book reconstructs the picture in verbal and visual terms (by the use of production stills) so that we can at least read what Welles intended. Much of the cut material appeared in script and still form in the earlier book This is Orson Welles but Carringer’s volume puts the whole thing together.\n\n66. More About All About Eve Joseph L. Mankiewicz; Gary Carey (1972)\n\nAll About Eve is (or used to be) everyone’s favorite theatre fable, one of the wittiest and most quotable of American movies. Joseph Mankiewicz’s exceptionally literate screenplay was a natural for publication, and Random House brought out an edition of it in 1950. Two decades later Bantam reprinted it, supplemented by a long interview with Mankiewicz by Gary Carey. The script still shimmers, but Mankiewicz revised his interview responses to such a degree he removed all the air from his remarks, replacing spontaneity with fussy ponderousness. It’s a tendency he also had as screenwriter, cluttering things up with verbiage, and the reason I suspect he did not direct an original movie of his own after 1967; he had become what Orson Welles once called “a loquacious bore.”\n\n67. The Ninth Configuration William Peter Blatty with Mark Kermode commentary (1999)\n\nAnother witty and endlessly quotable masterpiece, although far less well known than All About Eve. Blatty’s alternately hilarious and harrowing adaptation and revision of his novel Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane is a nonpareil, filled with verbal slapstick and marvelous oddballs in its cast of characters. For the published screenplay, Mark Kermode leads the author on a journey through the picture, their commentary appearing alongside the text. Even if Blatty ends the picture by handing us yet another facile “proof” of life-after-death, the ride is so uniquely entertaining we can even forgive him for the sermon.\n\nSee also: William Peter Blatty on The Exorcist: From Novel to Screen (1974) Blatty was nothing if not sincere about his somewhat trying missionary zeal, and in this Bantam paperback he explicates that mission, along with the shooting script for his most popular movie. “William Friedkin’s The Exorcist,” my ass.\n\n68. Nixon Oliver Stone and Stephen J. Rivele & Christopher Wilkinson (1995)\n\nHaving been burned by the corporate media on JFK, Oliver Stone was taking no chances with Nixon. He and his co-scenarists thoroughly annotated their published screenplay, including transcripts from the White House tapes and essays by some of the participants. The script, lavishly illustrated with stills from the picture, would be satisfying enough; the added weight of the documentary evidence makes the book a necessary volume in the expanding Nixon/Watergate libraries. I can never quite decide which Stone picture is my favorite, although I vacillate between JFK and Nixon, as I do between City Lights and Modern Times for Chaplin… and this is probably the first time the names of those two filmmakers have ever been yoked together.\n\n69. Screenplays Volume II, The (The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky): The Hospital, Network, Altered States Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\nApplause Books issued three Chayefsky collections in 2000: One for his stage plays and two for his screenplays. The second volume of movie scripts contained his best and most representative work, including the two on which his modern reputation rests. Although The Hospital is still a wonderful movie, I think a new Chayefsky may be required to, as Paddy did with the state of the medical monolith ca. 1970, satirize the way insurance and Big Pharma manipulate, rule over and generally destroy the lives and health not only of Americans but of nearly everyone on the planet. But while the contours of the news business have changed since 1976, Network retains its sting. Chayefsky was so prescient about televised news he was nearly an oracle; nearly everything he “predicted” in Network has come true in the decades since what MGM, hedging its bets, marketed as “a perfectly outrageous motion picture” was unleashed to the theaters.\n\nSee also: The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky: The Screenplays (Volume 1): Marty, The Goddess, The Americanization of Emily Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\n70. Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, The Return of the Jedi) Laurent Bouzereau (Screenplays by George Lucas, Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan) 1997\n\nOnly a fool or an overstimulated fanboy would refer to the screenplays of the original Star Wars trilogy as great literature, or even great pop literature. But if you’re fond of the movies made from them, they’re great fun to read, and the annotations provided in this nifty volume are fascinating. As a maker of exceptionally thorough behind-the-scenes documentaries Bouzereau’s name has been nearly ubiquitous on DVDs and Blu-rays of many popular movies. He applies the same rigor and besotted intelligence here.\n\n71. Hud, Norma Rae and The Long, Hot Summer: Three Screenplays by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. Edited and with an Introduction by Michael Frank (1988)\n\nBeginning with the Faulkner-inspired The Long, Hot Summer, Ravetch and Frank embarked on a career-long collaboration with the director Martin Ritt, resulting in eight pictures including the remarkably intelligent Paul Newman Western Hombre and Conrack, their adaptation of Pat Conroy’s despairing memoir of teaching shockingly impoverished Gullah children in South Carolina. Hud, of course, was one of Newman’s most identifiable roles (and the first Larry McMurtry novel adapted for the screen) while Norma Rae, based on the life and union activism of the late Crystal Lee Sutton, showed the moviegoing world that Sally Field was a major talent with a range far beyond what her earlier work (excepting the television “Sybil”) had led anyone to expect from her. The Norma Rae screenplay is perhaps the Ravetches’ most representative, filled with compassion, intelligence, humor, what used to be called “social consciousness” but which while passionate does not hector the viewer, and an impeccable sense of the dramatic. Who, having seen the picture, can forget the image of Norma Rae Webster standing defiantly atop the factory table with a hastily scrawled “Union” placard in her hands? And as a writer I treasure this exchange by the screenwriters between Norma and the textiles union organizer Reuben Warshawsky, portrayed by the wonderful Ron Liebman:\n\nReuben: You’re the fish I wanted to hook.\n\nNorma: Well, you got me. So what the hell are you gonna do with me?\n\nReuben: Make a mensch outta you, kid.\n\nNorma: You are?\n\nReuben: Mm-hm.\n\nNorma: (After a pause) What is that?\n\nReuben: Somebody who goes to the old folks’ home on Saturday morning instead of playing golf. Somebody who puts a dollar in a blind man’s cup for a pencil.\n\nNorma: I’d do that.\n\nReuben: Uh-huh. But would you take the pencil?\n\nNorma: Of course. I paid for it.\n\nReuben: Somewhere between logic and charity, there falls a shadow.\n\nThat, not boilerplate Democrat pieties dressed up in “dazzling” verbiage by self-righteous liberal dramatists, is what great screenwriting is all about.\n\nSee also: Three Screenplays by Horton Foote: To Kill a Mockingbird, Tender Mercies and The Trip to Bountiful (1994) Harper Lee remarked of Foote’s beautiful adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird that he had “distilled the essence” of her novel. This is the most that can be expected of a writer transliterating the nearly perfect work of another, and the best that can ever be hoped. Foote was also, of course, a considerable playwright and screenwriter, and this collection brings together, along with Mockingbird, two of his own finest screenplays. And (not that this automatically confers honor upon them) all three of these scripts won Foote Academy Awards.\n\n72. To Have and Have Not Jules Furthman & William Faulkner (1987)\n\nAs an adolescent I fell in love with the dialogue (and Bogart’s and Bacall’s performances) in this most entertaining of war-time escapist pictures long before I ever saw the movie, listening late at night in my bed to a local radio station’s airing of the 1946 “Lux Radio Theatre” broadcast, with an earplug (singular; this was the mid-’70s) but without, alas, Walter Brennan. Even though some of the repartee between Harry “Steve” Morgan and “Slim” Marie (“You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve…?”) that so delighted me at 13 or 14 I later discovered was written by Howard Hawks, the picture’s director, the rest of what I was hearing was sharper and more intelligent than the 1940s norm. And although I have always loved Casablanca, I don’t love it as I do To Have and Have Not. There’s almost no fealty in it to the bitter, downbeat Hemingway novel, but that was the point; Hawks wanted to show how Marie and Harry might have met. The University of Wisconsin edition of the screenplay includes a splendid long introduction by the editor, Bruce F. Kawin, that delves deeply into the development of the script: The first pass was by the gifted but unpleasant Furthman, the second by Faulkner, and the polish by Hawks who, as so often his pictures, could have taken a screenwriting credit and didn’t. The running gag of Brennan’s Eddie asking everyone he meets if they “was ever bit by a dead bee” sounds like something Hawks might have devised, but it was Furthman who had the wit to come up with it.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nThe 400 Blows François Truffaut and Marcel Moussy (1969) The Grove Press edition, packed with photos.\n\nAbraham Polonksy’s Force of Evil: The Critical Edition Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert (1996)\n\nAmerican Graffiti George Lucas and Gloria Katz & William Hyuck (1975) Another terrific Grove Press edition, later reprinted by Ballantine Books.\n\nThe Apartment and The Fortune Cookie: Two Screenplays Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

Additionally, the summer and autumn of 2018 were for private reasons exceptionally difficult for me, and entertainment was something I was able to devote very little time or attention to. Here’s to a much more movie-intensive 2019, whatever the venue.\n\nAnd herewith, the movies (and other video items) I did manage to see during the year recently passed.\n\nBOLD + Underscore Denotes very good… or at least, better than average.\n\n*BOLD + Underscore w/Asterik A personal favorite\n\n1. Older titles re-viewed on a big theatre screen\n\nThe Front Page (1974) Thanks to the Carolina Theatre in Durham I was able to add one more Billy Wilder picture to my list of his work seen on a big theatre screen, having missed this adaptation (by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) of the Hecht-McArthur perennial when it was first released. I have a complicated relationship with The Front Page: As an adolescent, influenced — as were so many of my generation — by Woodstein (and perhaps even more so by Carl Kolchak) I aspired to be a journalist. My interests eventually led me elsewhere, but that early appreciation of the Fourth Estate remains, even if it has now, as increasing numbers of people have begun to believe, become a fifth column. No play had a greater influence on popular American culture than this breakneck 1928 farce-melodrama; all the great newspaper comedies of the 1930s (especially those featuring Lee Tracy, who had the starring role in the play) flowed from its influential fount, and it absolutely cemented our image of the hard-bitten, ink-stained, wisecracking reporter… a figure now utterly obliterated by $30,000-a day neoliberal whores for the Establishment.\n\nYet as much as I admire it, I don’t find the play especially funny, except in the 1940 Howard Hawks variation His Girl Friday, and that’s due largely to the charm of Cary Grant, the fast-talking zing of Rosalind Russell and the fizz they spark off each other. (The final line is funny, but once you know it, it’s not one that elicits much of a laugh next time around.) The newsmen depicted are, in the main, appalling — less the bulwark of free-press democracy than shabby, cynical hacks more concerned with snappy headlines than with anything approaching truth. Some would no doubt argue that’s the point of the thing, but the authors clearly intended the play as a paean to the type, not a critique. That their star characters, Hildy Johnson and his unscrupulous editor Walter Burns, eventually manage to keep a corrupt Chicago mayor and sheriff in check is almost by-the-by; they wouldn’t do so unless their own liberty was at stake. That’s not to mention the casual bigotry of the piece: The word “nigger” is used by some of the reporters when “colored,” the general nomenclature of the time, not only would do, but did, elsewhere in the play, and the character of Bensinger is the piss-elegant pansy type prevalent in the ‘20s and ‘30s, all too easily ridiculed, and ridiculous. That Wilder and Diamond not only didn’t improve on that stereotype in 1974 but embellished it, making a cute young cub reporter (Jon Korkes) the object of Bensinger’s attentions, is a mark against their movie. An end-credits post-script reveals — presumably for a boffo laugh… which, sadly, it probably got from its contemporary audience — they’ve left the newspaper business and opened an antique shop together. Why not a florist’s while you’re at it?\n\nAs was their wont when adapting material by others, Wilder and Diamond made several changes to the original, and some critics were unreceptive; Wilder later admitted that he hadn’t understood how deeply venerated the play still was among members of the press. It’s a lively enough transliteration, with a fine performance by Walter Matthau as Burns, a good one by Jack Lemmon as Hildy despite his being too old for the role, and a controversial turn by Carol Burnett as Molly Malloy. (She famously apologized, to a planeload of passengers whose in-flight entertainment the movie was, for her performance.) Yes, she’s strident, but she’s also vulnerable, although not nearly so endearing as Austin Pendleton as the convict Earl Williams, whose imminent execution and eventual escape sets the plot — which Walter Kerr memorably described as “a watch that laughed” — in motion. Some of the scenarists’ alterations are pleasing, such as their stab at making the role of Hildy’s fiancée less thankless, and casting the young Susan Sarandon in the part. There is also excellent support by Charles Durning, Alan Garfield, Dick O’Neill and Herb Edelman (as Hildy’s fellow reporters), a blustery Vincent Gardenia (was there any other kind of Vincent Gardenia?) as Sheriff Hartman, a suave Harold Gould as the Mayor, Paul Benedict as the emissary from the governor, and wonderful old Doro Merande as the Criminal Courts Building custodian Jennie. As Bensinger, alas, David Wayne makes the worst of a bad job. While largely set-bound, the picture has a rich look to it, and there’s even a wild Keystone Kops-like chase through the Chicago streets. The opening credit sequence, set to a spritely Billy May rag (the production company was Universal, no doubt keen to have another Sting-like radio smash on its hands) and depicting the mechanized assembling of a newspaper from page one typeset to completed broadside, is a two-and-a-half minute gem.\n\n*The Changeling (1980) A beautiful rumination on the basic ghost story. Its admittedly thin screenplay is augmented by the usual marvelous George C. Scott performance, rare intelligence behind the camera — the director was the underrated Peter Madek — and a remarkably rich musical score (mostly by Ken Wannberg, with an assist from Rick Wilkens, anchored to an exquisite little music box theme by Howard Blake.) It’s one of those movies that has seen extremes of response: Dismissed, when not bludgeoned, by the critical fraternity on its 1980 release, it was restored and reissued in 2018 to ludicrous over-praise by people who can only deal in absolutes, and in an eminently dismissible interrogatory style: “Is The Changeling the most terrifying movie ever made?” The answer, even for partisans of the picture such as myself, is no. Not even close. But that hardly disqualifies the picture from being seen, and embraced, as a stylish — and surprisingly plangent — exercise in supernatural emotionalism that rewards repeated viewing. Thanks to my friend Eliot M. Camarena for suggesting this one to me a few years back.\n\n2. Documentary\n\nI.F. Stone’s Weekly (1973) Jerry Bruck, Jr.’s illuminating portrait of the fiercely idiosyncratic progressive journalist and, for many years, publisher of the eponymous newsletter still considered among the best, and most reliable, of progressive American news and opinion journals. Viewed courtesy of a kind friend who for the last several years has been my personal source for previously undiscovered (at least by me) cinematic gems.\n\n*Oliver Stone’s Untold History of the United States (2012) A staggeringly effective multipart examination of the dark underbelly of our history no American public school educator will touch: This one-time Republic’s century-plus evolution into the world’s most avaricious, and murderously dangerous, empire. Reactionaries, conservatives, liberals and their corporatist ilk will, if they sample it, no doubt sputter with impotent fury. And even for those of us who’ve been paying attention these last few decades, the revelations on display here will astonish and enrage. Yet even after 12 exhaustively documented hours* (and which feel more like two) neither Stone nor his co-authors Peter Kuznick and Matt Graham succumbs entirely to despair, and their Untold History is, finally, an impassioned call to arms that refuses to admit the defeat of essential values… provided we want them badly enough to fight for their reinstatement. “The record of the American Empire is not a pretty one,” they write. “But it is one that must be faced honestly and forthrightly if the United States is ever to undertake the fundamental structural reforms that will allow it to play a leading role in advancing rather than retarding the progress of humanity.” The Untold History is a vital step in facing that record. Now: Is there the popular will to make the changes we need?\n\nRush to Judgment (1967) This collaboration between the radical American documentarian Emile de Antonio and the Warren Report-debunking Mark Lane is in essence a 98-minute cinematic edition of the latter’s bestselling jeremiad of the same year. Lane’s is the research on which fifty years of responsible investigation into the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and its subsequent and violent cover-up, are based. And, as nearly as I can determine, none of his central findings have in the intervening decades been proven incorrect.\n\nDirected by John Ford (2006 edit) Peter Bogdanovich revisited his lovely 1971 documentary/overview in 2006. Alas, his new interview footage (with Clint Eastwood and Harry Carey, Jr.), shot on video, lacks, as Joseph McBride correctly noted in his review, the “vibrant look” and “elegant mobility” of their earlier counterparts. Nor does Eastwood add anything of value to what was observed originally by John Wayne, James Stewart, Maureen O’Hara and Henry Fonda. Still, the prickly sessions with Ford himself, the representative sequences Bogdanovich lovingly culled from his pictures, and the original Orson Welles narration are evergreen, and certainly reason enough to revisit this very personal Valentine to perhaps this most American (in both the good and bad connotations of the word) of 20th century filmmakers.\n\n3. Video/Made for Television\n\nJohnny Mercer: The Dream’s on Me (2009) A pleasant, if not especially inspired, Clint Eastwood-produced TCM centenary portrait of our finest pop lyricist.\n\n*The Night Stalker (1972) No American made-for-television movie had a higher viewership in its time than this wonderful, and genuinely scary, adaptation by Richard Matheson of a then-unpublished Jeff Rice novel, and it has lost little of its power, or its humor, in the decades since. The inspired casting of, and performance by, Darren McGavin as pain-in-the-ass investigative reporter (remember them?) Carl Kolchak is half the fun, and the supporting roles are no less vividly limned: Simon Oakland as his dyspeptic editor; Ralph Meeker as that oxymoron, a helpful FBI agent; Elisha Cook, Jr.’s professional snitch; Peggy Rea’s cameo as a switchboard operator bribable with foodstuffs; Larry Linville’s no-nonsense coroner; Charles McGraw’s polished, slippery Chief of Las Vegas police; and Barry Atwater, cunningly revealed in stages by the director, John Llewellyn Moxey, as the vampire. There’s also a terrific score by Dan Curtis’ house composer Robert Corbert. The new Kino Blu-Ray restoration is mouth-watering, making The Night Stalker look as good as it must have when first aired. My favorite bit of Kolchakian rhetoric (“Now, that is news, Vincezo. News! And we are a newspaper! We’re supposed to print news, not suppress it!”) is one that has, thanks to Bill Clinton’s Telecommunications Bill of 1996 and the subsequent, nearly total corporate takeover of all news media, become even more sadly pertinent.\n\nThe Night Strangler (1973) This inevitable sequel to The Night Stalker is nowhere near as good as its record-breaking predecessor, and pointed up the major flaw of the subsequent weekly series: That supernatural crimes keep popping up wherever Carl Kolchak goes, and that only he believes in them. But it’s atmospheric as hell, what with its remarkable abandoned city beneath the streets of Seattle, from whence a new serial murderer emerges. And it has McGavin and Matheson (not to mention Simon Oakland) and that’s almost enough. It also has a feast of fine supporting roles embodied by Scott Brady, Wally Cox, John Carradine, Al Lewis, Margaret Hamilton, Jo Ann Pflug as Kolchak’s co-conspirator, and Richard Anderson as the urbane villain. Dan Curtis directed this one, and it’s also out in a sumptuous-looking Kino Blu-Ray.\n\nThe Incredible Mel Brooks: An Irresistible Collection of Unhinged Comedy (2012) If, as I do, you can’t quite imagine life without the mad, unbridled wit of Mr. Brooks, this Shout! Factory set is five discs of bliss. (Six, if you count the accompanying CD. Which isn’t to mention the nifty hardcover book.) The DVDs consist of Brooks’ television appearances, an uproarious reunion interview with Dick Cavett, a five-part Mel and His Movies documentary, shorts (including Brooks’ and Ernest Pintoff’s Academy Award-winning The Critic) and even episodes of Get Smart! (one show is enough to make us wonder why we loved it so much in the ‘60s), When Things Were Rotten (which is no better now than it was in 1974) and Mad About You. There is never such a thing as too much Mel Brooks but even if there were, this set would support Mae West’s contention that too much of a good thing can be wonderful.\n\n4. Seen a second… and final… time\n\nBuffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976) Robert Altman and co-scenarist Alan Rudolph’s adaptation of Arthur Kopit’s trenchant, theatrical play Indians lost much in the translation, and the result is an occasionally diverting mess. A fine cast (Paul Newman, Joel Grey, Burt Lancaster, Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel) flounders in material too diffuse to have a discernible shape or point of view.\n\nVon Ryan’s Express (1965) Joseph Landon and the redoubtable Wendell Mayes adapted David Westheimer’s fascinating World War II thriller, and lost thereby much of what made it enthralling. To their credit, they kept the central figure’s prickly, unlikable character, and their star, Frank Sinatra, never winks at the audience. But the ending, which sacrifices Colonel Ryan on the altar of carnage, and which has no correspondence in Westheimer’s book, is wholly unnecessary. Mark Robson directed crisply, Trevor Howard makes a good foil for Sinatra, Vitto Scotti shows up as a train engineer, and the propulsive score by Jerry Goldsmith is one of his finest early works.\n\nThe Black Cauldron (1985) When I saw this animated Disney adaptation of Lloyd Alexander’s Prydain pentalogy on its release, I found it exceptionally impressive visually but largely uninvolving on a human level. In the intervening years I read, and fell in love with, Alexander’s entrancing series of novels for young people, so seeing the picture again was dispiriting. The novelist’s scope is Tolkeinean in its breadth, characterization and action, and 80 minutes is too skimpy a running-time to even begin encompassing it. But the books are as well deeply moving, something the movie never is, even with an illogical tear-jerker of a climax added on. The action takes in only a small set of events from, essentially, the first and second novels in the series, and the vast canvas of characters has been reduced to a mere handful, with one major figure (the Horned King’s tiny henchman Creeper) created out of whole cloth. Or ink-and-paint, as may be. One could go on at length, but why bother? Elmer Bernstein composed a splendid score, and young Grant Bardsley makes a properly questing Taran. The other voices include Freddie Jones, Nigel Hawthorne, Arthur Malet, Billie Hayes, John Hurt (as the Horned King) and John Byner, very fine as Gurgi. Among the familiar Disney names associated with the picture are Roy Disney (dialogue), John Musker and Ron Clements (story), and, in the animation department, Ruben Aquino, Hendel Butoy, Pixote Hunt, Glen Keane, John Lasseter, Rob Minkoff, Phil Nebbelink, George Scribner and Andreas Deja, all of whom would go on to far better things.\n\n5. New to Me: Meh\n\nBye Bye, Braverman (1968) This adaptation by Herb Sargent of Wallace Markfield’s 1964 novel, directed by Sidney Lumet, is richly populated with wonderful actors (George Segal, Jack Warden, Joseph Wiseman, Sorrell Booke, Phyllis Newman) and is on a certain level a vivid comic depiction of 1960s New York Jewish intellectuals. Sargent’s screenplay elides some of the archness of Markfield’s self-consciously (and, to my ear, anachronistic) “Jewish” dialogue, but, alas, is no more substantial, and its climax is even wispier. Godfrey Cambridge does have a marvelous scene as a cabbie, and Alan King gets a sly satirical sequence as a pompous Rabbi.\n\nThe Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots (1970) Another Lumet adaptation, by Gore Vidal this time, and of a Tennessee Williams flop (The Seven Descents of Myrtle) is the last word in weird. And although Robert Hooks is, as always, excellent, his presence as the mulatto bastard brother of James Coburn’s shabby white racist makes a hash of the action, since “Chicken” is supposed only to be somewhat dark-skinned, and not, as depicted here, obviously black. (The filmmakers also, un-shockingly, removed the Coburn figure’s homosexuality.) Lynn Redgrave gives a winning account of Myrtle, Coburn is fascinating, and the thing was shot, beautifully, by James Wong Howe. But it’s a curio merely, and a rather disagreeable one.\n\nThe Cowboys (1972) A real misfire. William Dale Jennings’ sumptuous novel (based on his own rejected original screenplay) was turned, by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., into a crude, morally objectionable revisionist Western, the ambiguity of the original lost by the appalling placement of John Williams’ rousing “Cowboys” theme at a crucial juncture. John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne almost triumph over this unsavory mélange, unimaginatively directed by Mark Rydell. But Bruce Dern, as the chief villain, wallows in overstated ugliness.\n\nExecutive Action (1973) What might have been a galvanizing fictionalized critique of accepted wisdom on the assassination of John Kennedy was turned in its pre-production into an oddly tame affair. The original script, by the JFK assassination researcher Mark Lane and the playwright Donald Freed (cf., the Nixonian fantasia Secret Honor, filmed by Robert Altman) and later adapted by them into a compelling paperback novel, made no bones about CIA involvement in Kennedy’s murder. The subsequent screenplay, by Dalton Trumbo, muddies these waters to the point of nearly complete opacity: From which shadowy organization, if any, is Burt Lancaster’s team derived, if not directed? Your guess would be as good as mine. Lane and Freed also focus their narrative very effectively on two of the conspirators’ descending life spirals, both of which the picture eschews, to its ultimate detriment. That said, the sight of three old Hollywood lefties (Lancaster, Will Geer and Robert Ryan, whose last film this was) as sinister reactionary collaborators holds a sly kick.\n\nPlay Misty for Me (1971) Clint Eastwood’s directorial debut is a time-capsule movie in any number of ways: As a depiction of the artistic colony of Carmel, California (where Eastwood resides, and was once a bar-owner — and later the mayor) at the beginning of the 1970s; the hair, autos, interior design and clothing of the time; the emergent style of Hollywood filmmaking as practiced by bright young directors feeling their oats; and, perhaps most interestingly, as an example of a narrative form that would no doubt be greeted with howls and Twitterized hisses today. “What? A thriller with a knife-wielding psycho… and she’s a woman? How dare they? And Eastwood goes to bed with her and then dumps her just because she’s a little unstable? #Hatred for the Mentally Ill! Maybe it was men like him who made her crazy! So she stabs his housekeeper — does that make her a bad person? (His Black housekeeper. #Racist Director!) And then he punches her? #Abuse! #Sexist Pig!” Never mind that one of the screenwriters (Jo Helms, who also crafted the story) was a woman. (The other was Dean Riesner.) Much more to the point is that fact that Eastwood’s character, an FM jazz d.j., behaves in such a demonstrably stupid manner throughout the rising action. And his directorial flourishes date the picture far more than the actors’ clothing, reaching their nadir in a soft-focus romantic montage with Donna Mills, set to Roberta Flack’s “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” which became a Top 40 hit. There is a nice sequence at the Monterey Jazz Festival, a narrative development obviously close to the director’s heart, Eastwood’s mentor Don Siegel shows up in a pair of nice bits as a barkeep and Jessica Walter does wonders with a character so frighteningly mercurial you wonder why her co-star doesn’t take out an immediate restraining order against her. But then, if he had, there might not be any movie. (I said he was stupid.) Bruce Surtees was the cinematographer.\n\nBroken Arrow (1950) This early attempt at being fair to Native Americans — the screenwriter, uncredited until decades later, was the then-recently blacklisted Albert Maltz — is overly earnest, stilted in its dialogue (which James Stewart’s opening narration hastens to warn us is due to the Apache language being spoken solely in English) and, while beautifully shot in color by Ernest Palmer, was directed with no distinction whatsoever by Delmer Daves, whose oeuvre only a confirmed Sarrisite could love. Jeff Chandler, whose stardom has always seemed to me one of American cinema’s great enigmas, is Cochise. The best one can say is that at least he doesn’t embarrass himself. Debra Paget is rather lovely as Stewart’s eventual Apache bride, and Will Geer, himself about to be blacklisted, has a small, showy role as an angry settler. Mickey Kuhn, who memorably played Montgomery Clift as a boy in the early part of Red River, also appears, as Geer’s son. Stewart, alas, has little to tax him histrionically until late in the picture.\n\nNight Passage (1957) I’ve seldom seen a good Western novel so thoroughly — and, to my mind, perversely and irresponsibly — ruined by Hollywood as what the makers of this one did to Norman A. Fox’s remarkable little book. But either the producer or the screenwriter (the redoubtable Borden Chase) removed the guts from Fox’s story, one that couldn’t have been more of a ready-made movie if it had been typed in screenplay format. A terrific picture could, and should, have been made from it, preferably in black-and-white, but neither Chase nor James Neilson, the ploddingly literal director, trusted what they had. There’s not even more than a few minutes’ worth of night in the damn thing… and that with a director of photography as certifiably great as William H. Daniels! Audie Murphy gives a good account of the nominal villain; you get the sense that he, at least, read the book. But Brandon deWilde, while game, is years too young for a role that should have been cast with an adolescent, and Dan Duryea is truly dreadful; the characteristic habit of his role is laughter, but each time Duryea breaks into it, the braying result is as phony as the backdrops the actors are framed against in the medium shots and close-ups. As good as James Stewart is in the lead, he’d have been twice as effective if more of Fox had made it onto the screen. Indeed, the only actor in Night Passage who’s a true breath of fresh air is Olive Carey, and it’s notable that her character, a wise, cheerful old muleskinner, wasn’t in the novel at all. The picture reaches its creative nadir in an added sequence that probably pained Norman Fox as much as, if not more than, what they took out of his book: A would-be comic brawl among querulous Irish laborers that is no funnier here than it was the many times John Ford attempted it, usually with Victor McLaglen. An extended sequence, on a moving train-car, provides the only real suspense in the picture: You keep looking at Stewart and deWilde, and those rushing waters far down below, and wondering how much insurance was issued on the actors.\n\n6. New to Me: Worth (or More Than Worth) the Trip\n\nFrom Noon ‘Til Three (1976) Frank D. Gilroy wrote and directed this delightful Rashomon-like parable, from his own ingenious little novel, which takes off from variations on what may have happened between a bank robber and a young widow during a crucial three-hour liaison. Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland are surprisingly charming as the lovers, and if the finale is less downbeat than the climax of the book its payoff is in its way no less pointed. Elmer Bernstein composed the delicious score, and the lyrics to his eponymous waltz are by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. (Bernstein and Alan Bergman appear on-screen as early Tin Pan Alley hacks, plugging the song.) Lucien Ballard added his usual luminous cinematography, and the Twilight Time Blu-Ray transfer makes splendid show of it.\n\nViolent Saturday (1955) A good crime drama depicting the planning of a bank robbery in a mining town that gets a lift from the performances of Stephen McNally, Richard Egan, Sylvia Sidney, J. Carrol Naish, Margaret Hayes, Tommy Noonan and Lee Marvin. Sydney Boehm wrote it, from a novel by William L. Heath, and it’s crisply directed by Richard Fleischer. With its small town full of adulterous dames, peeping Toms and kleptomaniac librarians, the picture suggests what might have happened had Richard Stark written Peyton Place. Charles G. Clarke provided vivid Technicolor cinematography, Hugo Friedhofer composed the taut and intelligently-spotted suspense score, and there’s a spectacular finale at a farmhouse owned by, of all people, Ernest Borgnine in an Amish beard and accent. Victor Mature, playing a man embarrassed that his son thinks he’s a coward, struggles manfully with a lousy part. He doesn’t overcome it, although he fares rather better with the villains.\n\nThe Crucible (1996) This excellent Nicholas Hytner-directed film of the 1953 Arthur Miller play about the Salem witch trials — and, in part, the playwright’s response to the House Committee on Un-American Activities — when seen in the years since the Democrats instigated a brand-new Red Scare on “evidence” no more substantial than that concocted by the terrified young Salemite Abigail Williams, carries with it a new and unavoidable metaphor: Hillary Clinton is Abigail.\n\nThe Landlord (1970) Hal Ashby’s directorial debut is a determinedly quirky take on what used, rather prettily in America, to be called “race relations.” The perennially under-rated Beau Bridges plays a wealthy ne’er-do-well who capriciously buys a Brooklyn apartment building, selfishly concerned only with refurbishing his own apartment and utterly unprepared for the wild array of his new black tenants, whom he plans to evict. The superb cast includes Diana Sands, Lee Grant, Pearl Bailey, Lou Gossett Jr., Mel Stewart and Robert Klein. Kristin Hunter wrote the novel on which the actor and playwright Bill Gunn based his cutting screenplay. Gordon Willis was the cinematographer.\n\nThe Public Eye (1992) Howard Franklin wrote and directed this beautifully photographed (by Peter Suschitzky) attempt at a latter-day, albeit period, film noir (always a fool’s errand) and basing the central character played by Joe Pesci on the idiosyncratic photojournalist Arthur Felling, aka “Weegee.” It doesn’t entirely work either as a character study or as a thriller, but it’s a highly original conceit, and Pesci, who has a tendency to repeat himself, is refreshingly restrained here. The always interesting Barbara Hershey also stars, and Stanley Tucci has a fine role as a hood with a conscience. Some of Wegee’s distinctive photos are featured, along with work by others.\n\nHombre (1967) One of several collaborations between Martin Ritt and the aforementioned screenwriters Ravetch and Frank, this one based on an Elmore Leonard Western. It’s an expansive movie, shot by James Wong Howe in widescreen and muted color, but doesn’t, finally, add up to a great deal. Paul Newman is the eponymous anti-hero, a taciturn young Caucasian raised by Apaches, and his performance is very nearly silent. It’s the kind of thing Steve McQueen made a fetish of, but that was due to his own well-deserved insecurities as an actor; you’ve only to picture any of McQueen’s defining roles with Newman instead, to comprehend the gulf that lay between them. Only a performer of Newman’s range and seriousness could really pull off the conceit, and he’s splendid here, as is the rather astonishing supporting cast: Frederic March, Diane Cilento, Cameron Mitchell, Martin Balsam, David Canary and, especially, Richard Boone. If not an ideal movie, it’s certainly an intelligent one.\n\nTom Sawyer (1973) Conceived and written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman and financed by, of all things, The Reader’s Digest, this musical variation on Mark Twain turns out to be a welcome, and very pleasant, surprise. Johnny Whittaker is Tom to the life, especially in the delightful fence-painting sequence; with his curly mass of strawberry hair and those half-attractive/half-ordinary features, Whittaker passes for a young Sam Clemens, which is who Tom is anyway. As Becky Thatcher, Jodie Foster (in only her third film appearance) is already poised and appealing; and Celeste Holm is the Aunt Polly of one’s fondest dreams, exasperated and warm in equal measure. The Shermans elevated Muff Potter to featured status, giving Warren Oates a chance to shine (although his vocals were dubbed) and the supporting cast includes Jeff East, very good as Huckleberry Finn; Lucille Benson as the Widow Douglas; Henry Jones as the cane-wielding pedagogue; and, as “Injun Joe,” the impressive Kunu Hank (no actor, his entire performance was dubbed). It’s about as likable a piece of Americana as you could wish, and the Sherman songs are their distinctive, patented mix of word-drunk whimsy (“Gratifaction”) and incisive character writing (“Tom Sawyer,” “How Come?,” “If’n I Was God,” “Aunt Polly’s Soliloquy”). My only real complaint concerns the cavern sequence, too brightly lit to achieve the terror intended; the 1938 David O. Selznick version got it much better, and remains one of the most frightening memories of my life as a children’s matinee moviegoer in the late 1960s. (Obviously, Injun Joe is dispatched in a less grisly manner in both pictures than the truly nightmarish demise Twain gave him in his book.) The director, Don Taylor, shot the picture in Missouri, and his approach to the material — and indeed, that material itself — never falls into the elephantiasis that doomed so many movie musicals of the time. There’s a marvelous, long helicopter tracking shot of Whitaker running through fields toward the Mississippi to meet the steamboat docking there which is as lovely as it is exuberant; the airy, attractive cinematography is by Frank Stanley, and looks especially good in the Twilight Time Blu-Ray. John Williams supervised the music and also served, with Irwin Kostel, as orchestrator. The movie does contain an odd detail, one that would never pass muster today: When, in their duet ”Freebootin’,” Tom and Huck swim naked off Jackson’s Island, the camera catches, almost gratuitously, what seem to be deliberate (if brief) glimpses of their bare bottoms thrust above the water. We can tell they’re not wearing anything in the sequence; what was the point of embarrassing adolescent actors that way?\n\nHuckleberry Finn (1974) Also featured on the Twilight Time Tom Sawyer release, this inevitable sequel fails on nearly every level. Yet somehow you don’t hate it. Sawyer’s producer, Arthur P. Jacobs, died before the picture began shooting, and his absence is felt throughout, especially as the director, J. Lee Thompson, clearly had no idea how a musical should be shot. László Kovács’ cinematography is gorgeous, but the predominance of muddy tones (and mud itself), while appropriate to a story set on the Mississippi, is at variance with the material. It might work for a straight adaptation of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but it’s disastrous for a musical. And Thompson’s staging is no help either; when the Duke and the King (David Wayne and Harvey Korman) are introduced with an energetic soft-shoe, they’re reduced to stomping around in the mud; what should soar with comic invention merely lies there, inert and gasping for air. As Huckleberry Finn is not merely one of my favorite novels but a cornerstone of American literature, I was surprised that the picture didn’t offend me. But the technique that worked so well for the Sherman Brothers on Tom Sawyer — they called it “A Musical Adaptation” rather than attempting a perfect transliteration — doesn’t suit this book, whose incidents are so well-remembered, and so crucial to the narrative, that variations can only disappoint. The death of Colonel Grangerford (Arthur O’Connell) in the feud here, for instance, simply lacks the heartbreak and horror of young Buck Grangerford’s murder, witnessed by Huck. (When Buck himself appears, it is not as the Colonel’s grandson, but as a black boy slave.) Nor is there anything in the picture as horrific as the tarring-and-feathering of the King and the Duke. Worse, the Shermans, having omitted the attempted lynching of Colonel Sherburn, give some of his lines to the King! East, whose second picture this was, is unable to breathe much life into a character whose struggles are largely internal, and not well illuminated in the screenplay, and Paul Winfield makes a dignified and endearing Jim, but the movie lets them both down; at the end they simply part and the picture fades off into nothingness. Korman and Wayne probably come off best, although Gary Merrill’s brief turn as Pap is properly unpleasant, and Natalie Trundy has a nice cameo as Mrs. Loftus. But the Sherman songs are a great deal less buoyant and memorable than those in Tom Sawyer. I suspect the material, darker and more pointed, was simply not a part of their creative purview.\n\nRun of the Arrow (1957) Samuel Fuller’s examination of race in post-Civil War America focuses on an Irish Confederate (Rod Steiger) who, refusing to accept Lee’s surrender, turns his back on white civilization. If you admire this most idiosyncratic of writer-directors, as I do, this one is essential viewing. Astonishingly, there are those now who don’t get that Steiger deliberately loses his accent while speaking Sioux when it’s blazingly obvious Fuller intended these dialogues, as the makers of Broken Arrow did, as representing the Siouan language in English. They think it’s just bad acting. Christ, how unbelievably obtuse Americans have become!\n\n*The Tamarind Seed (1974)\n\nBlake Edwards’ return to filmmaking following his disastrous experiences on Darling Lili, Wild Rovers and The Carey Treatment is a fascinating, intelligent and very effective little romantic thriller (from a good novel by Evelyn Anthony) on Cold War tensions. It’s bright, tense, well-conceived and often witty, with good performances from Julie Andrews, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quayle and a brief but extremely effective John Barry score.\n\nThe Traveling Executioner (1970)\n\nHad Gerrie Bateson written The Traveling Executioner as a novel rather than a screenplay, it might have been hailed as a modern neo-Southern Gothic black comedy on a par with the best of Flannery O’Connor. The picture, directed by Jack Smight, has the feel of the form, and if it’s difficult to imagine quite how it could ever have caught on with a large audience, then or now, it’s also in its small way superior to the later, much-heralded John Huston adaptation of O’Connor’s Wise Blood. Bateson, whose only movie this was (he wrote a Night Gallery and a Mission: Impossible before disappearing from the business forever) completed it for a film-school assignment, and it exhibits a smart novice’s go-for-broke quality. It’s ruthlessly efficient, rather like the device the smirkingly-named Jonas Candide (Stacey Keach) creates for quick penal executions, and carries through without compromise from its premise to its unsettling climax. Keach, fresh from Arthur Kopit’s play Indians and with his long hair worn in an anachronistic ponytail, is splendid, never appealing for audience sympathy as a less secure performer might. Although the tone veers from knockabout comedy to genuine tragedy, the picture feels entirely of a piece. My only cavil is with the ending, in which the dejected mortician played by Bud Cort takes on Jonas’ persona, and takes over his job. Having botched things so spectacularly, what state — even a backwards Deep Southern one — would let him continue executing felons? The Jerry Goldsmith score is a marvel, ranging from a circus-like waltz theme whose calliope gives way to an ersatz Gospel hymn, to a tender, moving accompaniment for Jonas’ soothing verbal depictions for his victims of an annealing vision he calls “The Fields of Ambrosia.”\n\nLove The Traveling Executioner or hate it, it’s certainly unlike any other movie you’ll ever see.\n\nThe Comancheros (1961) A big, colorful, episodic John Wayne vehicle that never takes itself seriously for a moment, doesn’t ask you to either, and is all the more likable for that. (Although Wayne’s character was subservient to that of Stuart Whitman’s in the Paul I. Wellman novel on which it was based.) The backstory is in some ways even more interesting than the picture — see the Wikipedia entry — and it was the final work of Michael Curtiz, whose illness forced him to withdraw during shooting; Wayne himself completed the movie. Clair Huffaker’s script was eventually re-written by Wayne stalwart James Edward Grant when the actor was cast in a role intended first for James Garner. The flavorsome cast includes Ina Balin, Bruce Cabot, Jack Elam, Jack Buchanan, Gwinn “Big Boy” Williams, and Henry Daniell. Nehemiah Persoff makes an elegant, wheelchair-bound villain, and Lee Marvin is both amusing and frightening as a mercurial, whip-wielding gun-runner who, scalped by Comanches, wears his remaining hair in a long braid down one side of his head. Elmer Bernstein wrote the score in his characteristic Big Western mode, and it’s a honey, rousing and relentlessly melodic.\n\nWall Street (1987) Although supposedly made in tribute to his stockbroker father, Oliver Stone’s movie is really a disgusted response to the bald, grasping greed of the Reagan era. And while Michael Douglas is perhaps my least favorite actor of his generation, I must admit he has a feel — come by naturally, one presumes — for embodying sleaziness. I am if anything less enamored still of Charlie Sheen, Martin’s less gifted son, but even he is in good form here, as Bud Fox, an ambitious young trader who willingly allows himself to become corrupt. (Is it coincidental that he shares the first name of Jack Lemmon’s equally climbing would-be junior executive in The Apartment?) Martin Sheen himself provides splendid contrast as Bud’s honest dad, Hal Holbrook has some nice moments as a seasoned broker, James Karen is solid as Bud’s predictably mercurial boss, and Terence Stamp does well by an icy corporate raider. Only Darryl Hanna proves a true embarrassment; in her big break-up scene with the younger Sheen, she’s appalling. Whatever his limitations as an actor, he’s trying to do honor to the moment, but she gives him nothing to play against. Stone, who wrote the screenplay with Stanley Weiser, has a fine feeling for the trappings and appurtenances of the time and place, although when the picture ends you may find yourself shrugging with indifference at the whole thing.\n\nSaint Jack (1979) Largely ignored on its release, and barely given a chance to find an audience, this adaptation by Peter Bogdanovich, Howard Sackler and Paul Theroux of the latter’s caustic picaresque novel set in the Singapore of the 1960s and early ‘70s is beautifully made and wonderfully acted, especially by its star, Ben Gazzara, who gives a performance in which every word and sparing gesture is so honest we feel like eavesdroppers. Bogdanovich and his collaborators — although presumably not Theroux — deviate from the book’s structure (it’s both linear and temporally fragmented) and its events in substantial ways, particularly in their depiction of the Hong Kong-based accountant played with understated garrulity by Denholm Elliott; he dies early in the novel, but pops up repeatedly in the picture, and since Elliott is so pleasing a presence, even Theroux devotees may not mind. Bogdanovich himself shows up, in a coldly effective portrayal as a wealthy fixer. (Amusingly, his ever-present aide and chauffeur walks as if he has a stick shoved permanently up his ass.) George Lazenby appears late in the movie as a liberal Senator, the unintentional means of Jack’s redemption. Interestingly, Bogdanovich changes the odd but essentially innocent liaison between the politician and a young woman Jack is supposed to spy on into one between Lazenby and a native rent-boy, making Jack’s rejection of the plot even more pointed. I say “interestingly” because Bogdanovich has seemed in his writing to be at best rather uneasy with homoeroticism. Robby Müller photographed the picture, beautifully, on location.\n\nThe Immortal Story (1968 — Criterion) Orson Welles’ intriguing adaptation, for French television, of the Isak Dinesen story was his first project not filmed in black-and-white. And while he disdained color, he shortly became a master of it; his subsequent F for Fake is the most beautiful of movies, and among the most pictorially splendid of Welles’ own work. Welles was also a realist, and he understood that color was increasingly important to distribution, indeed the dominant mode of world cinema, and especially, television. (The Immortal Story was shot by Willy Kurant.) Welles appears as the wealthy catalyst of the events, Roger Coggio is his ambiguous aide-de-camp, Norman Eshley is the virginal young sailor and the luminous Jeanne Moreau is the impecunious woman at the center. Since I have not read Dinesen’s story, I am not sure what is missing in the loss of authorial voice, and indeed I would like to know how Dinesen ends the narrative, because I’m not at all certain how I am supposed to feel, and what it all means. On that basis — one of the most basic to movies — The Immortal Story must, I suppose, be accounted an artistic failure; a picture that depends on our understanding of the story it is based on and cannot express its own intentions clearly enough to stand on its own is not a success. Or perhaps I’m just thick-headed. Despite the foregoing, anything Welles put his name to is, perforce, worth seeing, and more than once. I’m sure I’ll be watching this one again… although I also suspect that it, like his adaptation of The Trial, will never be a personal favorite.\n\n7. Revisited with pleasure\n\n*The Death of Stalin(2017) Armando Iannucci co-wrote (with David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows) and directed this at once hilarious and horrifying black comedy based on the French graphic novel La Mort de Staline by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin, and it’s one of the finest — and funniest — political satires in motion picture history. Granting there haven’t been that many of those takes nothing away from this audacious, witty, occasionally shocking and blazingly intelligent movie. Even the casting amuses: When Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin and Jeffrey Tambor show up (as, respectively, Khrushchev, Molotov and Malenkov) they elicit sly chuckles. There is, however, nothing remotely amusing about Simon Russell Beale’s chilling performance as the appalling Lavrentiy Beria. Rat-like both in action and physiognomy (courtesy of some superb prosthesis by Kristyan Mallett), pathologically sadistic and lethally efficient, Beale’s Beria is a genuine sociopath who only exhibits human feeling when it’s his own neck on the line. Buscemi and Tambor take top honors among the comedians but the entire picture is beautifully cast, with standout work especially from Andrea Riseborough as Svetlana Stalina. Foolishly, “Me Too” accusations against Tambor led to the producers erasing him from the poster while the picture was still in theatres. One wonders where this insanity will end. With Errol Flynn being digitally erased from The Sea Hawk, presumably.\n\nHarry and Walter Go to New York (1976) An enjoyable farce starring James Caan, Elliott Gould, Diane Keaton and Michael Caine whose screenplay, one gathers, was muddled by that hack Mark Rydell; Caan averred Rydell “completely” re-wrote what he called a “wonderful script” — by John Byrum, with later revisions by Robert Kaufman and Don Devlin — adding, “The director sacrificed jokes to tell a story no one cared about.” (Leslie Anne Warren, who is featured in the deliberately overripe, and amusingly sabotaged, play-within-the-film, claimed she couldn’t get work for five years after the picture opened.) If you approach this period farce with appropriately lowered expectations it’s buoyant and engaging, if not especially hilarious. The muted ending is another detraction, turning as it does Keaton’s radical newspaper publisher into a rank, gold-digging opportunist. Among the delicious supporting cast: Charles Durning, Carol Kane, Michael Conrad, Burt Young, Bert Remsen and the always delightful Jack Gilford. The early 1900s décor is sumptuous, heightened by the burnished cinematography of László Kovács and the bouncy score is by the marvelous David Shire, who also appears, briefly, as the blasé pianist accompanying Harry and Walter’s vaudeville act.\n\nThe Front Page (1931) The first time I saw this Lewis Milestone-directed version of the Hecht and McArthur play, in an admittedly poor print, it seemed to me one of those creaky, set-bound early talkies that illustrated why the camera needed to be freed from the tyranny of the sweat-box microphone. But the restored edition, made available on Criterion’s splendid recent release of His Girl Friday, showed me just how wrong I was. Culling footage from the domestic, British and foreign versions of the picture, and a 35mm print from the Howard Hughes Collection struck from the original nitrate negative in 1970, the Academy Film Archive re-assembled and restored the movie to spectacular life. Although Lee Tracy, the original Hildy Johnson, was engaged elsewhere in Hollywood (and playing very similar roles) Pat O’Brien makes a suitable substitute, and that otherwise insufferable old reactionary Adolphe Menjou is a very creditable Walter Burns. Best among the supporting cast are Walter Catlett (as Murphy), Mae Clarke (Molly Malloy), Slim Summerville (Pincus), Frank McHugh (McCue) and, as Bensinger, the peerless Edward Everett Horton.\n\nHarper (1966) William Goldman wrote this sharp adaptation — and slight updating — of Ross Macdonald’s initial Lew Archer novel The Moving Target, removing, thankfully, most of the original’s ugly homophobia in the process. (Perhaps at Paul Newman’s request? That is sheer speculation on my part, but something about the subject of homosexuality clearly bugged Macdonald; every Archer novel I’ve read contains at least one unsavory Lesbian or gay man, and Newman was notably squeamish about such sexual demonizing. The one exception in the picture is the murderous thug played by Roy Jenson whom Harper queer-baits, to predictable results.) The star, coming off The Hustler and Hud, was convinced that the letter “H” was lucky for him, hence the change from Archer to Harper. The rich supporting cast includes Lauren Bacall as a paraplegic ice-queen; Julie Harris as a drug-addicted singer-pianist; Arthur Hill as Archer’s lawyer pal; Janet Leigh as his dry, cynical ex-wife; Pamela Tiffin as a spoiled rich girl; Robert Wagner, pretty and dangerous as a glorified pool-boy; Shelley Winters as a former Hollywood starlet turned blowsy man-trap; Harold Gould as a sheriff; and Strother Martin as a phony spiritualist. Johnny Mandel wrote the brief, jazzy score. Appropriate to the tawdry sadness that overlies the Archer books, Goldman’s twists are less clever than deflating, particularly the last one, and he gets off some pretty fair hard-boiled lines of his own, the best and most famous being one for Newman: “The bottom is loaded with nice people, Albert. Only cream and bastards rise.”\n\n*Dick Tracy (1990) Warren Beatty’s witty take on the notably grisly Chester Gould strip, complete with a color palette evoking the bright hues of the Sunday newspaper comic page… and which scores of ignorant American critics referred to at the time of the picture’s release as having been done in “primary colors”… which of course would have meant only in red, blue and yellow. Maybe they were taking their cue from Richard A. Sylbert, the movie’s designer(!), who said the same thing(!!) in a number of contemporary interviews. It’s a fast, enjoyable ride (Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. are the credited screenwriters) decked out with some marvelous pastiche songs by Stephen Sondheim, a Danny Elfman score that emulates Gershwin as well as his usual hommages to Herrmann and Rota, glorious photography by Vittorio Storaro, and a terrific cast to embody the many odd, pre-Fellini grotesques of Gould’s imagination. Aside from Beatty himself as Tracy, Madonna as his temptress Breathless Mahoney (she gets a great Sondheim number in the Harold Arlen mode called “Sooner or Later”), the delicious Glenne Headly as Tess Trueheart and the gifted Casey Korsmo as Junior we also get Seymour Cassel (Sam Catchem), Michael J. Pollard (Bug Bailey), Charles Durning (Chief Brandon), William Forsythe (Flattop), Ed O’Ross (Itchy), Mandy Patinkin (88 Keys), R. G. Armstrong (Pruneface), Paul Sorvino (Lips Manlis) and, in an inspired bit of kidding, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles. Dick Van Dyke, alas, is wasted as a crooked D.A., but Al Pacino has a veritable field-day as the chief villain “Big Boy” Caprice. It’s the perfect role in which to indulge his occasional penchant for explosive over-acting; like Akim Tamiroff in Touch of Evil, he’s both menacing and very, very funny. Mike Mazurki also shows up, in a bit. He’s a living link to the past the movie depicts, as is Mel Tormé, whose voice we hear on the radio crooning Sondheim’s “Live Alone and Like It.”\n\n*Nashville (1975) — Criterion\n\nRobert Altman and Joan Tewksbury’s unrivalled nonesuch, one of the greatest movies of a great movie period.\n\n*Tom Jones (1963) — Criterion John Osbourne wrote and Tony Richardson directed this elegant, playful, French New Wave-inspired adaptation of the sprawling Henry Fielding novel, which made Albert Finney an international star. (It made a then-astonishing $36 million in its initial release, on a $1 million budget.) Five and a half decades on, the bawdiness which titillated its contemporary audience has become about as shocking to the sensibilities as your octogarian grandmother saying “Fuck,” but the performances, and Walter Lassally’s exquisitely rendered cinematography, remain enchanting, and the famous “eating scene” between Finney and Joyce Redman is still riotously suggestive. Although I am averse to the hack-phrase “breaking the fourth wall,” which is most often used by the sort of people who think direct address was invented in Hollywood sometime around the year 2000, it’s notable that Richardson and Osbourne (and yes, dear auteurists, the moments were scripted) have fun twitting the audience with acknowledgments of the camera: Redman’s impressed, impish shrug to the audience when she realizes she’s slept with her own son is still jaw-droppingly hilarious. Susannah York makes a charming Sophie Western, Hugh Griffith is a roistering Hogarthian feast as her father, and the rest of the fine supporting cast (Edith Evans, Joan Greenwood, Diane Cilento, George Devine, David Tomlinson, Jack MacGowran, David Warner, Peter Bull, Angela Baddeley, John Moffatt, Lynn Redgrave) are a comprehensive delight. Micheál Mac Liammóir adds his rich, plummy actor’s tones to Osborne’s narration which, while it does not often quote Fielding directly, approximates his style with aplomb. The witty score is by John Addison, and Antony Gibbs provided the sprightly editing.\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) Terry Gilliam is, arguably, our greatest movie fantasist — and, inarguably, has the worst luck of any major filmmaker; there is nothing as insane in the Gilliam universe as the people for whom he has worked. On Munchausen, he was saddled with a very strange, possibly criminal, German producer and yoked to corrupt Italian artisans and the wildly expensive and inefficient facilities at Cinecittà, rendering much of his original vision compromised… and, when the picture was completed, suits and countersuits by the completion bond company and the indifference of a new regime at Columbia Pictures which preferred taking a $38 million loss to promoting a project of the previous administration. Yet Gilliam delivered a movie of such richness it is nearly overstuffed with delights. Seeing it in a theatre in 1988 was an exhilarating experience, one comparable to the high you get if you’re lucky enough to watch Lawrence of Arabia on a wide commercial screen. The director and his co-scenarist, Charles McKeown, made going to the movies an act of veneration, and the Cineplex a palace of wonders: An ancient European city besieged by Ottoman artillery; encounters with Death; a wild nocturnal ride on a cannonball; a hot-air balloon made of women’s undergarments; a flight to the Moon; a corresponding plunge to the center of the earth; ingestion by a giant sea monster; incarceration in, and escape from, a Turkish seraglio; and a character whose impossible feats of sprinting make him the human equivalent of Chuck Jones’ Road Runner. Nor are these marvels wholly (or even necessarily partly) realistic. Munchausen is, if anything, about the advantages of storytelling artifice over absolute verisimilitude, and the movie is filled with delicious theatrical concepts — another age’s deliberately exaggerated invocation of splendor. Giuseppe Rotunno shot the picture, which features John Neville as the Baron, Sarah Polley as the skeptical child he endeavors to convert, Eric Idle as Berthold, Jonathan Pryce as an officious officer, Oliver Reed as Vulcan, Uma Thurman as Venus, Valentina Cortese as the Queen of the Moon and a prototypically untrammeled Robin Williams (in the credits he’s “Ray D. Tutto,” a homonym approximation of the Italian “king of all”) as the King.\n\n*The Godfather (1972) I doubt I can add anything to the millions of words that have been written, and said, about Francis Coppola’s adaptation of the Mario Puzo novel, with Jaws a prime exemplar of the notion that third-rate source material can, when filtered through the sensibilities of supernally gifted popular artists, yield first-rate movies. The Blu-Ray edition of the “Coppola Restoration” is exquisite.\n\n*Rio Bravo (1959) I have a good friend who positively loathes Howard Hawks. I am precisely the opposite. I don’t love his movies equally, and I know dreck when I see it, whoever made it. But when I think of the creative filmmakers (as opposed to the m"
