While I like the intent of HB 6695, the bill does represent a substantial change in Michigan law, and I believe that changes of this magnitude should be fully discussed and reviewed by the Judiciary Committee. This bill was not afforded that opportunity, and I think the process was seriously shortchanged because of a lack of input from the legal community. We can avoid unintended consequences from otherwise good bills when they are subjected to a more rigorous analysis.

Ward moved that the following remarks be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nRep. Anderson:\n\n\"I'd like to thank my colleagues for this opportunity to share some thoughts as my time in the Michigan House comes to a close and my term in the Senate is about to begin. I'd also like to express my appreciation for an understanding and supportive wife and family. Understanding of the time demands this position places on its members and supportive of my commitment to the citizens I've been given the opportunity to serve.\n\nI remember as a child hearing my grandfather talk about how the years fly by and I recall the difficulty I had understanding what he meant. The last 6 years have certainly given me a better understanding of his words.\n\nWhat an incredible opportunity we've all been given. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have made so many good friends here. Who could ever forget the story teller from the Marquette area, the soon to be octogenarian representative's sense of humor, or the courage displayed on a particularly tough vote a couple of years ago by the good representative from the 63rd district and I will never forget my dear friend from the 4th district, Rep. Mary Waters.\n\nHave you ever, like me, walked up the sidewalk in the evening from the office building with the Capitol aglow and marveled at this amazing building? I've also thought about the good fortune I've had to be but one of only 110 Michigan citizens given this opportunity at a given time?\n\nWhile the memories of the last 6 years are many, I'd prefer to mention some of my observations and food for thought.\n\nTo all those who will not be returning next year, I'd like to say thank you for those of you who were respectful of the rights and obligations of other House members, even the rights of those of us who were in the minority. We all represent basically the same portion of our state's population and have the same right to be heard. As some wiser members realized and many more now realize, the shoe could be on the other foot someday.\n\nTo those colleagues who will be returning, I would ask that you take the time to acknowledge those dedicated individuals who help keep state government moving, help us do our jobs and in essence, make us look good. From the info systems staff, our central staff, policy staff, the clerk staff, our own office staff, the Sergeants and the many behind the scenes employees as well as even the House pages. I urge you to take the time to share a few minutes of your time and thank them for their contribution. I'd like to give my personal thanks to them now and especially my staff, Jamie and Russ and those before them who worked hard for me and the 18th District including Krysta Earhart and Jennifer Robel.\n\nTo our Democratic leader, I'd like to say thank you for taking our caucus to the majority. She never wavered from the goal she laid out from the day she became our leader and she accomplished this much sooner than anyone would have predicted. Unfortunately neither she, nor I will serve in this chamber to enjoy this new status. While there just may be a just a handful here today who disagree..., I'm sure Michigan will benefit by greater balance in the legislature. As my Democratic colleagues prepare for their new role in the majority, I urge the new Speaker Pro-tem to start out with a good eye exam. Hopefully he will not go to the same optometrist as the current speaker pro-tem.\n\nI wish all of you the best in whatever you may pursue, I look forward to my new position across the hallway and to working with many of you in that capacity.\n\nGood luck and God bless.\"\n\nBy unanimous consent the House returned to the order of\n\nSecond Reading of Bills\n\nSenate Bill No. 603, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1980 PA 299, entitled \"Occupational code,\" by amending section 303a (MCL 339.303a), as amended by 1995 PA 183, and by adding article 28.\n\nWas read a second time, and the question being on the adoption of the proposed substitute (H-1) previously recommended by the Committee on Commerce,\n\nThe substitute (H-1) was adopted, a majority of the members serving voting therefor.\n\nRep.

Ward moved that the following remarks be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nRep. Gosselin:\n\n\"To the Members of the Michigan House of Representative ­ Dec. 2006\n\nThank you Mr. Speaker for this opportunity to address this distinguished body for a final time.\n\nI leave here thankful to God for having been a part of this institution, and grateful to the people of Troy, Rochester Hills and Clawson who put their trust in this true-blue conservative to represent them, here.\n\nI have had the privilege of serving under three different Speakers. Each brought to this room a different perspective based on their own spirit and views. I commend you, Mr. Speaker, and your predecessors, for your service to the people of Michigan, and your willingness to ride the roller coaster of 'satisfaction and disappointment', 'success and failure', 'confidence and uncertainty' that is an inseparable part of this key position.\n\nMy hat is off to you Speaker DeRoche and to Speaker Perricone and Speaker Johnson and for their service.\n\nI arrived here as one of the most conservative members in the modern era, and that's how I will leave. Some of the fine journalists we are privileged to work with here have consistently rated me as the 'most conservative,' and I wear that as a badge of honor.\n\nI could not be prouder to find myself in the company of other past members who also were recognized for upholding the principles of true conservatism, people like Greg Kaza, Margaret O'Connor, Stephen Dresch, and Tim Walberg to name just a few.\n\nI am proud -- that like those individuals, I never forgot that 'good conservatives' stand for less government and less spending, 'good conservatives' work to get government off your back and out of your wallet. 'Good conservatives' work to let families make decisions for themselves, without government butting in and telling them where to go and how to get there. 'Good conservatives' want families to keep more of their hard earned dollars, because 'good conservatives' realize that families, not government know best how to spend their own money more wisely.\n\nMr. Speaker, I have followed the principals of less government. I have established benchmarks that made sense like 'not voting for budgets that exceed the rate of inflation'. I recommend this principal to all future legislators as the House moves into a challenging new session.\n\nAs I leave I am saddened that we haven't done more to remove the public policy obstacles that have made this state an 'economic basket case'. We must ask the question. Why have so many new auto plants located in other states? Yes, Michigan has faced a tremendous challenge in seeing our largest employers fall behind in the 'Hyper-competitive automotive market'. But this was not a unique challenge ­ other places have faced similar challenges.\n\nThe economy in this nation is dynamic, not static. Jobs are lost all the time, and new jobs are created. Some companies fall behind, and others gain. Nationally, for the past four years a record number of jobs have been created. But not here, and there are specific reasons for that.\n\nThose reasons don't include not spending enough on education. Michigan teachers are among the highest paid in the nation, and our per-pupil spending is also near the top.\n\nJob providers haven't bypassed Michigan because our government doesn't spend enough to make our cities 'cool' or to bribe certain companies to locate here with corporate welfare handouts.\n\nWhen it comes to 'cool', government doesn't have a clue, and the same applies to bureaucrats picking winners and losers for special tax breaks.\n\nInvestors and job providers certainly haven't avoided us because we uniquely fail to cap the amount of time people can collect welfare, or because we aren't increasing Medicaid spending fast enough.\n\nNo, Mr. Speaker, none of these are reasons why Michigan's economy has failed to thrive. The problem is, we've lost sight of why job providers and investors choose to risk their money. If they see that it's harder to make money here they go someplace else. Our current laws tilt the playing field too far toward unions 'stuck in an industrial era confrontational mind-set', and because our regulators will drive them nuts and cost them a fortune they will just go someplace else.\n\nThe problem's become much worse under an administration that's failed to provide adult supervision, choosing instead to pay off its environmentalist and labor supporters by letting those bureaucrats run amok.\n\nMr. Speaker we need make fundamental changes to the way Michigan law addresses it businesses. It seems the administrations first item on the next legislature's agenda is to replace the SBT, I say don't replace it. The SBT was correctly seen as a cancer for business. We cut the cancer out. So why in the world is anyone talking about replacing the old cancer with a new cancer?\n\nBusinesses don't pay taxes ­ people do, and the real burden of business taxes falls also on investors and job providers the very people we need to make up the jobs lost by automaker downsizing. So why in the world is anyone even talking about taxing job providers? We can't afford that! We need jobs here in Michigan.\n\nI mentioned our labor laws. The Detroit News business columnist wrote an article a few weeks ago describing Michigan as a 'labor viper pit.' Why in the world would job providers and investors want to come to a place where the deck is stacked in favor of organized labor? Michigan will never get past this problem until we adopt a 'right-to-work' policy that honors every employee's right to join a union or not join a union. That's the kind of policy change that will make job providers want to take a risk on Michigan. Policies of the past are not policies of the future in this new economy.\n\nWe have the highest unemployment rate in the country. The value of people's homes is falling by 15 and 30 percent. At this moment there are 30 homes sellers in the metro area for every one buyer. Homeowners are suffering now, and local governments will soon feel the pinch too, when lower assessments cut into their primary revenue source. Jobs have left, and people are leaving too ­ for the first time in the history of this state the population may be starting to go down. Why have we not done the things that would make Michigan a place where investors and job providers want to locate and build?\n\nThere are too many in Lansing whose main concern is hanging on to their piece of the taxpayer's pie, - and we've listened to them too much. Everyone knows there's waste and inefficiency in state government, and ways to do things for a lot less money, but that means making someone mad around here, and being unpopular in Lansing, and we didn't want to do that. This is foolish and shortsighted, because it creates a vicious circle.\n\nLet me spell that out: High taxes, regulatory labor laws that tilt the playing field against job providers, and an unfriendly regulatory environment mean businesses close. Jobs disappear, and job providers and investors who might create new jobs go somewhere else. No jobs mean people move away. Fewer people and a slower economy mean property values fall. All of that leads to less tax revenues for - cities, township, Counties and state. Elected officials pressured by union bosses, environmentalists and spending lobbyist fail to cut taxes, reform labor laws and ease regulations. That means more jobs are lost, more people move away, and property values fall even lower. Michigan is in a tail spin.\n\nWith the right public policies Michigan can break that vicious cycle and once again have an economy as vibrant as when we were the 'arsenal of democracy'. Other places have fallen on hard times, and come back. Ireland is often cited as an example of what good tax policy can do. It's a good model in other ways, too. Ireland now has a fast growing population, more jobs than workers, rising property values, and all the other good things that come with a strong economy. They are number 1 in the world for growth. It happened not because 'things got bad enough,' but because leaders decided to put first things first by making that country a place where investors and job providers saw that they could make money. We can do the same.\n\nWell Mr. Speaker, I arrived here as a genuine conservative with some pretty strong opinions, and it looks like I'm leaving the same way.\n\nI look forward to my new job on the Oakland County Commission starting in January, where I will also preach the gospel of low taxes, less regulation, and limited government.\n\nAnd I wish you all good health and God-speed. May we be able to make the changes in this state that are so desperately needed.\n\nThank you and farewell, Mr. Speaker, and colleagues. It has been an honor, and a pleasure to serve with you.\"\n\nBy unanimous consent the House returned to the order of\n\nReports of Standing Committees\n\nThe Committee on Judiciary, by Rep.

Ward moved that the following remarks be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nRep. Zelenko:\n\n\"1. When I first came to the House, my friend and mentor, Jack Minore, introduced me as that \"Burton Girl\". If you are not from Genesee County, you may not know what that means, although some of you have witnessed the qualities.\n\nI was raised up in a low income family, where school shopping meant one pair of new shoes and two dresses, one of which was sure to be an ugly hand-me-down from my cousin, Louise. Where Christmas morning meant one gift under the tree and your stocking was filled with fruit, nuts, one candy cane, pencils and erasers. A stocking, which by the way, was literally a sock you took out of your dresser drawer and thumb-tacked to the door casing nearest the tree.\n\nBoth of my parents worked outside of the home. After a 10 hour workday polishing and crafting marble and granite, Dad plowed fields in the spring and driveways in the winter to make a little extra money.\n\nMom worked four days a week as a cosmetologist instructor and I thought I grew up normal. It wasn't until my teen years that I realized that kids outside of Burton, MI made fun of us.\n\nWe were different, And some of us were poor.\n\nWe were uncool, we were red-neck hillbillies, and looked down on. Until then, I never knew there were kids out there that never drew their own bath water or didn't have to wash the dishes, take out the garbage, work in the gardens, or clean their rooms.\n\nBack then, if you grew up female in Burton, MI...you were a Burton Girl. A label given to you by the 'outsiders' because you got your hands dirty, had to do chores, you wore hand-me-downs, and rough housed with the boys, and you knew how to roll up your sleeves and show some smart ass your left jab.\n\nNeedless to say both my husbands are Burton Boys...they understood our unique qualities.\n\n2. Yep, Burton Girl...got married straight out of high school, tried the college thing, but husband # 1 and I couldn't afford tuition for both of us so I dropped out. I did earn my PhT...yes PhT...Putting Him Through.\n\nThen the babies started coming. Twelve years and three beautiful little girls later, I became a starving single parent, working three jobs while going back to school. I got a better job and cut back to working two jobs. Married again, acquired two step daughters, and gave birth to another. Little by little, I plugged along and tried to make a difference in my community, school district, and eventually elected to our city council and now State Representative. For a Burton Girl, this is big time stuff.\n\nI didn't realize until years later that even though most of my life, I was a low to medium income Burton Girl, I was really never poor. I was rich in family and the values instilled in me. I grew from my experiences and became a stronger person because of the challenges I met head on. There is a difference in being poor and being broke. Broke is financial hardship; Poor is a state of mind. Once a Burton Girl, always a Burton Girl. So in a Paul Harvey sort of way...Now you know the rest of the story.\n\nI can say that what I've found so interesting about my experience here is that even though each of us comes here with some unique qualities and make an outstanding contribution in our own individual way, how much this institution itself is something that is beyond any one of us.\n\nHow in spite of our moments of difficult debate, political posturing, and in spite of our moments of humor, this institution has guided this state through its existence. It's the process itself that is intended to help us gel together and produce a product that serves all the people of the state. It is the process itself that is at risk. Please save the institution.\n\nI am grateful to God for this opportunity. For without Him, I would have never survived the challenges.\n\n3. I would like to thank the members of the Democratic and Republican central staff. Because you are what really makes this whole thing work.\n\nThank you to my predecessor, Senator Deb Cherry, to Lt. Gov. John Cherry, Senator Bob Emerson, and to my successor, Representative-elect Ted Hammon for your friendship and guidance during my entire public office career. You've been instrumental in my transition from local government to state government. Thank you.\n\nTo my leader, Dianne Byrum, we may have disagreed more than we agreed, but thank you for your leadership and for staying the course.\n\nMy hat is off to you.\n\nSpeaker DeRoche, despite our philosophical differences, and the fact you no longer send me flowers, you are a pretty good egg. I will miss you.\n\nI am thankful for each and everyone of you, and being a Burton Girl, and at the risk of offending someone, I am going to say a special thanks to some folks who have been especially close to me these past six years, whose friendship in various ways have enriched my life...Carl Williams, Barb VanderVeen, Doug Hart, Laura Toy, Ruth Ann Jamnick, Pan Godchaux, Julie Dennis, Gretchen Whitmer, Judy Scranton, Mary Waters, Brenda Clack, Jack Minore, Pat Lockwood, Gary Newell, Mike Murphy, Rich Brown, and Larry Julian. Thank you for your prayers, your strength, and your encouragement in helping through the difficult times of the deaths of my parents. You were my rocks through those difficult days.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't give credit where credit is really due.\n\nMy Staff.\n\nBette Bigsby, my Chief of Staff, a fellow Burton Girl, and my friend for years longer that we both care to admit, words do not exist that could accurately express my appreciation. Thank you.\n\nKatie Whitman, my legislative assistant who started out as an intern and another Burton Girl and my right hand. I will miss you.\n\n4. Bob Kefgen, a former intern and aid, moved on to Rep. Spade's office two years ago.\n\nSarah Walls, my intern now and a pleasure to have in the office.\n\nPaula Anderson, who helped set up my office and transition me to Lansing life before leaving to join Senator Cherry's office.\n\nThese are the folks that have made Representative Paula Zelenko successful. When my constituents had their problems solved, it wasn't because I intervened. It was because I always had outstanding staff who served me well. Staff that knew me well, shared my values, and always put forth the best in serving the citizens of the 50th district.\n\nThank you to my husband, Bill, and my children. You were patient, loving, and understanding and you stuck with me through all of this.\n\nI thank my parents, for even in their death continue to teach me.\n\nBut it is my constituency that elected me over and over again. They said job well done, keep working. I really thank them for this opportunity to be here, and I thank you all for your public service.\n\nI have had the opportunity to get to know some great folks on both sides of the aisle; I only wish there had been time to know more of you. One of the pitfalls of term limits, is the constraints on forging relationships with colleagues...getting to really know each other and understanding where, how, and why we each think the way we do. Get to know one and another. Create affinity. Build the bridge.\n\nSteve Adamini said it best when he said the tenure here in the House has been a meaningful experience, but it certainly doesn't compare to the wedding day (both of them for me) or the birth of my children and grandchildren or even the privilege of being present when my parents transitioned to their heavenly home.\n\nMy time here has been filled with rich experiences. I am a better person because of all of you. But as with all things, our time here must pass. The memory lasts and somehow sacredly, mystically by our remembrance, throughout our own existence, these memories are made immortal.\n\nI believe our daily examples of integrity, service, and commitment to family and community will be our mark of excellent to the people of Michigan. Not how many bills we passed or how much campaign money we raised or what political party we belonged to.\n\nIn conclusion, I ask you to reflect on the words of President John F. Kennedy:\n\n'Remembering on both sides, civility is not a sign of weakness, sincerity is always subject to proof, never negotiate out of fear and never fear to negotiate, explore what problems that unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.'\n\nGod Bless you all.\"\n\nBy unanimous consent the House returned to the order of\n\nThird Reading of Bills\n\nRep.

Ward moved that the following remarks be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nRep. Kolb:\n\n\"Thank you Mister Speaker, it is with great respect for this Chamber that I rise to give my farewell address. Before I forget I want to thank all those that have made this the greatest job of my life.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Governor, Jennifer Granholm whose leadership has helped to guide our ship through troubled waters, with accommodations for all our residents. It has been an honor to serve with you.\n\nTo the Speaker who runs this chamber, who I became friends with when you were a freshman sitting across the aisle from me, with your seatmate Rep. Hune. I cherish our friendship and the conversations we have shared, some constructive, some more blue. We have not always agreed, nor have we always found resolution to the issues before us, but I do know that we both did try.\n\nTo my first Speaker, Rick Johnson; I will remember your friendship, your laughter and your anger (I think that is a Speaker thing). We worked together on land use issues; a farmer from up north in Leroy, a city kid from Ann Arbor working together on one of Michigan's most pressing issues. I look back in amazement on the ability of such strange bedfellow to work together and make good public policy.\n\nTo my leader, Dianne Byrum, I applaud your dedication, your steadfast resolve, the total commitment in your task to take back the Majority. To our past leaders, Kwame Kilpatrick, who gave many of us the baton and allowed us to run with it. To my friend, Buzz Thomas, who allowed me to keep discussions alive, and gave me the responsibility to collect the votes needed to complete the legislative agenda before us when he could not. I want to thank each of you for the effort and leadership you provide our caucus.\n\nTo my staff, the hardest working, most dedicated and knowledgeable staff in Lansing, Pat Niemela and Tina Reynolds, thank you for your years of service to this State, to the House and especially to the people of the 53rd District. You both made it easy for me to hit the ground running and never stop running. I knew you would have everything ready to go, including my coffee, regardless of the task or issue. I will miss you both and the district will miss you even more.\n\nTo my family, my parents and brother, who helped to mold me into the person I am today, I give you my heartfelt thanks. My parents gave my brother and me everything we needed, including their faith, their strength, their love and support to be whatever we wanted to be. One of my regrets was that my father, my best friend, never got the chance to see me take office here in Lansing.\n\nTo my partner Ken, who I owe too much to say, but who has stood by me in good times and bad, whose love is never-ending, whose love has given me strength and hope, who has had to share me with the public for virtually ten years, thank you for walking beside me and sharing your life with me.\n\nTo my constituents who elected me to public office for 13 years, including my six years here in the House. I will never forget your belief in me and support. Thank you.\n\nSix years ago the voters of the 53rd District made history when they elected the first openly gay member to any state office. They judged me on my merits and my ability to do the job, on the values and perspective that I would bring to this chamber. I hope that I have met their challenge and measured up to their expectations. For it has been a true honor and privilege to serve the people of the 53rd District, my hometown, and the people of Michigan.\n\nI will carry the memories and friendships that I have made here in the Capitol with me for the rest of my life. It has been such an honor to come to work here at the Capitol in the People's House. Still today I am in awe, looking out my office window, walking to the Capitol, looking up at the Dome, it brings forth such emotions of honor, obligation and responsibility to do the very best for the people of Michigan. I will miss my friends on both sides of the aisle, our staff (both partisan and non-partisan) who make us better legislators, the clerks, the sergeants of arms, the pages, all of seen and unseen staff that help us to do our job, and to the press corp who shine a light no matter how brightly on this chamber. I will miss one of the greatest experiences of my life being a part of this great experiment we call self-rule. This is the greatest job in the world, savor each day, honor it by giving it your all, six years goes faster than you might think.\n\nAs a new legislator you come in with your freshman class ready to rollup your shelves and work. You butt heads, you make mistakes, if your lucky you learn where the bathroom is before it's an emergency, you get your first bill passed, you learn to get things accomplished, you learn that time really can stand still in the House, and that six years is not long enough.\n\nLife teaches us many lessons, and this past fall election has something to teach all of us. It is our job, our duty to address the issues that face our great State. The House has an important role to play in forging Michigan's future. We cannot shirk our responsibility. Our job is to legislate; we don't need to start the next campaign on the first day of session. Concentrate on the public policy and the politics will take care of itself.\n\nWhile I have seen many of my bills signed into law, I still have a few hundred waiting for another member to take up the torch and move these fine pieces of legislation forward next session. As a policy wonk, I urge you to continue to work on diversifying our state's economy. Coming from a district with so much going on, everyday I can see the future of Michigan's economy. Few states or even regions of the world have the human and natural resources that we can bring together to forge a new and dynamic economy. Our future will be quite bright, if we pull together and work together to build a stronger economy. One thing you can do right away is to include software companies in the 21stCentury Jobs Program. Another important issue we need to move forward is the ability to unleash the power of science and medical research. Michigan, with its great research universities and medical facilities should be a leader in embryonic stem cell research.\n\nEnergy is another area where Michigan can advance solid public policy and economic growth. Enact a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, support energy efficiency, and position Michigan to advance a strategy for Distributed Generation. Clean Technologies need to be invested in and encouraged to grow here in Michigan.\n\nSpeaker-Elect Dillon, I urge you to move forward on catastrophic health care insurance, if we can do it for auto insurance we can do it for health care insurance too. I share your interest and concern in helping businesses and our families address the need for access to affordable health care. For six years I have helped to champion Mental Health Parity, we need to join the overwhelming majority of states and enact this into law.\n\nIf we are to advance our economy, our state and the future economic well-being of the families we represent, there is no more important investment to be made than investing in education-access to higher education must be a right and an expectation.\n\nProtecting our natural resources and the people of Michigan, our greatest resource, is our duty. Clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and clean land to raise our families on is not a privilege it is a right. I urge you to ratify the Annex 2001 agreement that will help to protect the Great Lakes. Solutions to stopping global warming can be found at the state level, Michigan needs to be part of the solution, each one of us, and collectively, must tackle this moral issue, to ignore it is to advance our own ultimate demise.\n\nPlease do not forget to help those with the very least and those who are the most vulnerable in our state. As Jesus of Nazareth said, 'what you do unto those with the very least thee, you do unto me.' (Matthew 25:40). Giving families the tools and resources, the support, to be self-sufficient, breaking the cycle of poverty must be our goal. Be their champion!\n\nThe fabric of Michigan will not be complete until the rights of all of our residents are protected. We cannot have discrimination allowed in our state, nor written into our constitution. If we are to fully compete on the global economic stage, we must provide the leadership to lead our state into the future by building upon our diversity and creating an atmosphere of respect for all. When you're trying to attract businesses to our state you cannot be telling some workers they aren't welcome. Businesses will come if you welcome the best and the brightest...regardless of who they are, where they come from and whom they love.\n\nI hope if you have learned one thing from me it is that I am just like you, I put my pants on one leg at a time; I have the same dreams and aspirations, the same hope for the future of our state. My family is just like yours, we have the same joys, the same stresses, the same dreams for our future as you do. I am not a lifestyle, I am not a choice, I am what I am. Just as I was born male, born with brown hair, I was born gay. There are times when I feel that I must speak for up to 1 million fellow Michiganians who have no protection from discrimination under state or federal law, who see their relationships discriminated against in our state's constitution. Michigan will not be the state we all know it can be until we are all respected and treated equal under the law. That is the great unfilled promise of this nation and of our state.\n\nThe low light of my tenure was the vote on the marriage issue. When my right to marry the one I love, was put up for a vote. It made me realize how important the right and act of marriage is, how little that right means if it does not include the right to marry the one you love. After my speech on the floor that day, after I had told this House that I hoped one day that my partner and I would get the chance to say \"I do\", Ken emailed me, as Peter Luke reported accurately, \"I want a big rock.\" I laughed out loud and knew how much I loved him and how much I owed him for standing by me, how much I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him where ever our path shall take us.\n\nThe highlights? There are many:\n\nBeing sworn into office the first time;\n\nPassing my first bill;\n\nRounding up the last three votes to pass the HAL legislation in the House;\n\nMoving over to the Appropriations Committee (as we say on Approps, policy schmolicy);\n\nGovernor Granholm signing my bill into law, she at least sent a photo, Engler only sent a pen;\n\nGetting out of a committee hearing chaired by Bruce Patterson, with my scrap and other body parts still intact;\n\nBeing on 'Off the Record' three times (can we make it four?);\n\nBeing relevant;\n\nMeeting President Bill Clinton;\n\nMeeting Sen. Hillary Clinton;\n\nMeeting former President Jimmy Carter, and numerous other dignitaries;\n\nBeing the only 'No' vote on the 'In God We Trust' Legislation;\n\nBeing invited to the Governor's House;\n\nPresenting at the NCSL with Rep. Shaffer on the House Civics Commission;\n\nTalking to 4th graders each year;\n\nFighting the good fight even when the cards are so stacked against you;\n\nHelping to lead the Fire Services Caucus (along with Representative Farhat, Senators Prusi and Garcia) and creating the new Bureau of Fire Services;\n\nGoing to Israel, it was an amazing trip I was honored to be selected to go. I remember floating in the Mediterranean Sea with the chair of Appropriations discussing world events and how we could work together, watching as a gunship flew overhead realizing the reality of life in the Middle East is far different than back home. In the City of Jerusalem, praying at the western wall, the wailing wall, with Republican and Democrats, Jews and Gentiles. Seeing firsthand the way a society tries to continue on in the face of so much violence and the impact of that violence has on all parties. Going out for a last drink in the German Colony; coming home to discover one week later that the same café had been bombed by a suicide bomber the table we sat at destroyed, so many lives lost. I understand so much more now.\n\nNegotiating the original tobacco tax increase, at 3:30 AM, with Gov. Engler and Buzz Thomas. The Governor was dressed impeccably in a Blue Blazer, green polo, khakis and penny loafers; Buzz and I not looking our best shirt tails out, ties loosen if worn at all.\n\nEarning the nickname of 'Spiderman' after finding myself trapped in the Speakers restroom, while everyone else was in caucus, and having to free myself by opening the window, leaping off the snowy ledge on to the balcony ledge in the dead of night.\n\nBeing tackled and assaulted by Sparty on the House Floor, another first for a State Representative and a historic moment I'm sure (Thanks Gretchen);\n\nWatching Gretchen Whitmer struggle through signing the Victors;\n\nStruggling myself through the Ohio State fight song;\n\nSailing around Boston Harbor in a tall ship with my fellow Caucus members and friends;\n\nFeeding this Chambers sugar fix with candy each session day;\n\nBestowing a tiara on Princess Marcia for her birthday...and no it wasn't one of mine and yes you can keep it.\n\nHaving served my entire term in the House in the Minority, I never got the chance to chair a committee, I had to fight and scrap, claw for even a crumb in the legislature, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I loved this job, every minute of it, even when you were kicking my butt all over the Capitol; I couldn't wait to come back the next day. Go all night, no problem. Need a vote, let's talk. Negotiations stalled, let's jump start them. You've got a problem; I think we can find a solution.\n\nI got a chance to work on some amazing pieces of legislation, work on some of the toughest budgets. Times will not change much in the coming years and tough decisions will have to be made. I trust you will make the right decisions.\n\nWhat little insight I can pass along, I hope you will value it for what you paid for it. I truly believe that the center can govern, that legislators should be pragmatic, that you should learn to leave your ego and ideology at the door of this great chamber. You do not have to abandon your values or belief, in fact it is those very beliefs and values that you must hold dear, but the perspective, the beliefs and values that each of your fellow legislators bring are as important as yours. It is in your ability, and in your best interest, to ensure that the 110 different viewpoints throughout this group decision-making process, we call the House, are respected and called upon to form the best possible legislation and decisions as you can make. This is the marketplace of ideas, discover them, research them, voice them, sell them, and never stop working on them until they become a reality, an amendment, a statute.\n\nSo many of you I want to mention and I have taken far too much of the chambers time, but I do want to mention just a few of those with whom I have served. I must recognize my former Washtenaw County Representatives John Hansen, and Ruth Ann Jamnick, all the back benchers (it really is the best seat in the House, unless you're in the Speakers chair, of course), my friends who have graduated to other offices Gretchen, Buzz, Kwame, et al, the entire Senate, Rivet, Ruth Johnson, Jason Allen, the independent Republicans Godchaux, Scranton, Pumford, and the rest...Former Gov. Engler and his wife and family...my committee chairs and vice-chairs, my fellow committee members, my freshman classmates, Whitmer & Brown who led us effortlessly on Appropriations, my Committee Chair and Anderson 360 co-star Scott Hummel, Jerry Kooiman (and his better half, Maribeth). To all my colleagues I will remember you all fondly. My friend Bill McConico, who learned to stick his nose under the tent by watching me, please remember that when the ship was sinking, who didn't abandon ship. Sandy Lipsey, my seatmate, my friend, the one I trusted with my last will and testament and who tells me what we're voting on; we made one major error in not running you as our candidate for leader (no offense meant to any other candidate or leader). Your wisdom, warmth, trustworthiness, & hard work, make you the model legislator. I bow my head in respect to you.\n\nTo this Chamber and all that have served with me in the House and that other chamber, and all those that serve the people of Michigan I give you my deepest gratitude, my heartfelt respect, I do not say goodbye or farewell, only 'until we meet again.'\"\n\nBy unanimous consent the House returned to the order of\n\nSecond Reading of Bills\n\nHouse Bill No. 6313, entitled\n\nA bill to amend 1956 PA 218, entitled \"The insurance code of 1956,\" by amending sections 7702, 7704, 7705, 7706, 7707, 7708, 7709, 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7717 (MCL 500.7702, 500.7704, 500.7705, 500.7706, 500.7707, 500.7708, 500.7709, 500.7711, 500.7712, 500.7714, and 500.7717), sections 7702, 7708, 7709, 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7717 as amended by 1989 PA 302, sections 7704, 7705, and 7706 as amended by 1996 PA 548, and section 7707 as added by 1982 PA 194.\n\nWas read a second time, and the question being on the adoption of the proposed substitute (H-1) previously recommended by the Committee on Insurance,\n\nThe substitute (H-1) was adopted, a majority of the members serving voting therefor.\n\nRep.
