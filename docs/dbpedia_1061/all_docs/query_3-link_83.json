        "text": "Script and font support in Windows\n\nSince before Windows 2000, text-display support for new scripts has been added in each major release of Windows. This article describes changes made in each major release.\n\nSupport for a script might require certain changes to text stack components and changes to fonts. The Windows operating system has many text stack components: DirectWrite, GDI, Uniscribe, GDI+, WPF, RichEdit, ComCtl32, and others. The information provided here pertains primarily to GDI and DirectWrite. It's also applicable to user interface frameworks such as RichEdit or the MSHTML rendering agent used for Windows apps and for rendering Web content, though those components might exhibit certain differences.\n\nA detailed library of Microsoft fonts is available as part of the Microsoft Typography documentation.\n\nComments on language usage are included in cases in which associations between scripts and languages might not be well known. The list of languages for any given script isn't necessarily exhaustive.\n\nWindows 11\n\nThe list of fonts included with Windows 11 is available in the Windows 11 font list.\n\nSegoe UI Variable is the new system font for Windows. It's a refreshed take on the classic Segoe and uses variable font technology to dynamically provide great legibility at small sizes, and improved outlines at display sizes. Windows 11 also introduces a new system icon font, Segoe Fluent Icons. This icon font aligns to the Fluent Design system. For more information about Windows 11 design principles, see Typography in Windows 11 and Iconography in Windows 11.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 10, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Aegean Numbers Europe Sans Serif Collection Aegean numerals and punctuation Ahom Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Ahom Ancient Greek Musical Notation Europe Sans Serif Collection Musical notation used in ancient Greece Avestan Middle East Sans Serif Collection Avestan, Middle Persian Balinese Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Balinese, Sasak Bamum Africa Ebrima Bamum Bamum Supplement Africa Segoe UI Historic Bamum - Historic stage A-F of the Bamum script Batak Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Alas-Kluet, Angkola, Karo, Mandailing, Pakpak, Simalungun, Toba Buhid Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Buhid, Tagalog Byzantine Musical Symbols Europe Sans Serif Collection Musical notation for Byzantine music Caucasian Albanian Europe Sans Serif Collection Caucasian Albanian Chakma Indian subcontinent Nirmala UI Chakma Cham Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Cham, Sanskrit Combining Half Marks Sans Serif Collection Diacritical marks spanning two or more characters Common Indic Number Forms Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Representing fractions Dogra Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Dogri Elbasan Europe Sans Serif Collection Albanian Elymaic Middle East Sans Serif Collection Aramaic Hanifi Rohingya Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Rohingya Hanunoo Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection HanunÃ³'o, Tagalog Kaithi Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Hindustani, Magahi, Maithili, Nagpuri Kayah Li Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Karenni Khojki Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Kutchi, Sindhi Khudawadi Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Sindhi Lepcha Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Lepcha Limbu Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Limbu Linear A Europe Sans Serif Collection Unknown Linear B Ideograms Europe Sans Serif Collection Unknown Linear B Syllabary Europe Sans Serif Collection Mycenaean Greek Mahajani Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Hindi, Marwari, Punjabi Mandaic Middle East Sans Serif Collection Mandaic Manichaean Central Asia Sans Serif Collection Multiple Middle Iranian and Tocharian languages Masaram Gondi Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Gondi Mayan Numerals Mesoamerica Sans Serif Collection Historical Mayan numeral system Medefaidrin Africa Sans Serif Collection Medefaidrin Mende Kikakui Africa Sans Serif Collection Mende Miao China, Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection A-Hmao, Lipo, Nasu, Sichuan Miao Modi Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Marathi Mro Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Mru Multani Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Saraiki Musical Symbols Sans Serif Collection Modern musical notation Nabataean Middle East Sans Serif Collection Nabataean Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection White Hmong, Green Hmong Old Hungarian Europe Sans Serif Collection Hungarian Old North Arabian Middle East Sans Serif Collection Ancient North Arabian Old Sogdian Central Asia Sans Serif Collection Sogdian Palmyrene Middle East Sans Serif Collection Palmyrene Aramaic Pau Cin Hau Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Tedim Psalter Pahlavi Middle East Sans Serif Collection Middle Persian Samaritan Middle East Sans Serif Collection Samaritan Aramaic, Samaritan Hebrew Saurashtra Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Saurashtra Sharada Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Kashmiri, Sanskrit Sogdian Central Asia Sans Serif Collection Sogdian Soyombo Central Asia Sans Serif Collection Mongolian, Sanskrit, Tibetan Sundanese Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Sundanese Sundanese Supplement Southeast Asia Sans Serif Collection Sundanese Takri Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Western and Central Pahari languages Tirhuta Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Maithili, Sanskrit Wancho Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Wancho Warang Citi Indian subcontinent Sans Serif Collection Ho Zanabazar Square Central Asia Sans Serif Collection Mongolian, Sanskrit, Tibetan\n\nWindows 10\n\nThe list of fonts included with Windows 10 is available in the Windows 10 font list.\n\nWindows 10 converges the Windows platform for use across multiple device categories. This section on Windows 10 covers all Windows 10 editions, including Desktop, Server and Mobile.\n\nAll Windows 10 editions support the same set of scripts. In addition to the scripts supported in earlier Windows releases, Windows 10 adds support for several historic scripts. These scripts are supported using the new Segoe UI Historic font.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 10, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage ADLaM Africa Ebrima Fulani Brahmi Indian subcontinent Segoe UI Historic Historic Carian Europe Segoe UI Historic Historic Cypriot Europe Segoe UI Historic Historic Egyptian Hieroglyphs Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Imperial Aramaic Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Inscriptional Pahlavi Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Inscriptional Parthian Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Kharoshthi Indian subcontinent Segoe UI Historic Historic Lycian Europe Segoe UI Historic Historic Lydian Europe Segoe UI Historic Historic Meetei Mayek Indian subcontinent Nirmala UI Meitei Phoenician Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Old Persian Cuneiform Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Old South Arabian Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Shavian Europe Segoe UI Historic English phonetic writing Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic Ugaritic Cuneiform Middle East Segoe UI Historic Historic\n\nCertain other historic scripts were supported in earlier versions in the Segoe UI Symbol font. In order to avoid duplication, the following scripts were from Segoe UI Symbol and included in Segoe UI Historic:\n\nGlagolitic\n\nGothic\n\nMeroitic Cursive\n\nOgham\n\nOld Italic\n\nOrkhon\n\nRunic\n\nIn Windows 8.1, the Meiryo UI font family was used for Japanese text in the Windows user interface. On Windows Phone 8.1, the popular Yu Gothic font was used for Japanese. In Windows 10, the user interface font family for Japanese changed to Yu Gothic UI for all editions. To make Yu Gothic UI perform as intended in Windows user interfaces, Yu Gothic UI is adapted from Yu Gothic with certain metric and character width modifications, and alternate glyphs for Latin characters. For nonuser interface content, the Yu Gothic fonts are still included. For optimal readability, the OpenType âpaltâ feature (proportional alternate widths) should be enabled for text formatted with Yu Gothic.\n\nAnother change pertaining to user interface fonts is that a semilight weight was to the Malgun Gothic family. Otherwise, user interface fonts for other languages are the same as in Windows 8.1.\n\nIn Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, private-use-characters in the Segoe UI Symbol font were used for user interface iconography. In Windows 10, the Segoe MDL2 Assets font was to provide newer iconography.\n\nAn important development in Windows 10 is the Universal Windows Platform (UWP): a converged app platform allowing a developer to create a single app that can run on all Windows devices. Windows fonts are one aspect of this convergence: Windows 10 introduces a recommended UWP font set that is common across all editions that support UWP, including Desktop, Server, Mobile and Xbox.\n\nFor information regarding which fonts are included in the recommended Microsoft font set, complete details are provided in Windows 7 Guidelines for fonts. One important point to note is that the recommended font set doesn't include all of the weights for certain font families. In particular, due to the large size of East Asian fonts, only the regular weight of East Asian font families are included in the recommended font set.\n\nMany additional fonts are available for Desktop and Server, including all other fonts from previous releases. However, not all of these fonts are preinstalled by default in all images. In order to make disk usage and font choices more relevant to users according to the languages that they use, many fonts were moved into optional, on-demand packages. These packages are designed around the different scripts that fonts are primarily intended to support. Windows Update adds most of these packages automatically when the associated languages are enabled in language settings (for example, by enabling a keyboard). However, you can add any of the optional font packages manually in Settings. The Pan-European Supplemental Fonts package isn't triggered automatically but can be added by enabling it in Settings.\n\nTo add font packages manually, go to Settings > System > Optional features (if on a version older than Windows 10 22H2, navigate to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Optional features instead).\n\nThe following are the optional font packages that are automatically added based on changes to language settings:\n\nArabic Script Supplemental Fonts\n\nBangla Script Supplemental Fonts\n\nCanadian Aboriginal Syllabics Supplemental Fonts\n\nCherokee Supplemental Fonts\n\nChinese (Simplified) Supplemental Fonts\n\nChinese (Traditional) Supplemental Fonts\n\nDevanagari Supplemental Fonts\n\nEthiopic Supplemental Fonts\n\nGujarati Supplemental Fonts\n\nGurmukhi Supplemental Fonts\n\nHebrew Supplemental Fonts\n\nJapanese Supplemental Fonts\n\nKhmer Supplemental Fonts\n\nKannada Supplemental Fonts\n\nKorean Supplemental Fonts\n\nLao Supplemental Fonts\n\nMalayalam Supplemental Fonts\n\nOdia Supplemental Fonts\n\nSinhala Supplemental Fonts\n\nSyriac Supplemental Fonts\n\nTamil Supplemental Fonts\n\nTelugu Supplemental Fonts\n\nThai Supplemental Fonts\n\nThe following optional font package must be added manually:\n\nPan-European Supplemental Fonts\n\nNote: These optional packages are for Desktop and Server editions only.\n\nMoving these fonts into optional packages provides over 220 MB of disk savings for users who donât require these fonts.\n\nAnother significant international development in Windows 10 is the introduction of a new complex-script shaping engine, the Universal Shaping Engine. The Universal Shaping Engine allows any complex script in Unicode 7.0 to be shaped correctly even if the script isn't yet supported by a system-provided font. Users can install a suitable OpenType font for correct shaping behavior for any script in Unicode 7.0.\n\nNote: While the Windows platform is able to support display of additional Unicode 7.0 scripts using nonsystem fonts, it doesnât guarantee that using nonsystem fonts will work in all apps. In particular, apps that do their own low-level text-display processing might not display a script correctly unless they were explicitly designed to support that script, even if they call platform APIs that use the universal shaping engine. Also note that platform frameworks don't provide font fallback behavior using nonsystem fonts.\n\nThe following complex scripts in Unicode 7.0 are supported in the Universal Shaping Engine.\n\nBalinese, Batak, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid, Chakma, Cham, Duployan, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Grantha, Hanunoo, Javanese, Kaithi, Kayah Li, Kharoshthi, Khojki, Khudawadi, Lepcha, Limbu, Mahajani, Mandaic, Manichaean, Meitei Mayek, Modi, Mongolian, NâKo, Pahawh Hmong, Phags-pa, Psalter Pahlavi, Rejang, Saurashtra, Sharada, Siddham, Sinhala, Sundanese, Syloti Nagri, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Tai Viet, Takri, Tibetan, Tifinagh, Tirhuta\n\nOther scripts in Unicode 7.0 either are supported in other shaping engines or don't require complex script handling.\n\nFor more background on the Universal Shaping Engine, see Creating and supporting OpenType fonts for the Universal Shaping Engine .\n\nWindows 8.1\n\nThe list of fonts included with Windows 8.1 is available in the Windows 8.1 font list.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 8.1, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Buginese Southeast Asia Leelawadee UI Buginese Coptic Middle East Segoe UI Symbol Historic Javanese Southeast Asia Javanese Text Javanese Meroitic Cursive Middle East Segoe UI Symbol Historic Ol Chiki Indian Subcontinent Nirmala UI Santali Sora Sompeng Indian Subcontinent Nirmala UI Sora\n\nFor the previously supported Khmer, Lao and Thai scripts, the fonts used for the Windows user interface were changed in Windows 8.1:\n\nKhmer: the Windows 8 user interface font was Khmer UI; Windows 8.1 uses Leelawadee UI\n\nLao: the Windows 8 user interface font was Lao UI; Windows 8.1 uses Leelawadee UI\n\nThai: the Windows 8 user interface font was Leelawadee; Windows 8.1 uses Leelawadee UI\n\nAlso, for several font families, new weights were added to extend the font weight options for content and app creators:\n\nMicrosoft JhengHei UI: added Light weight\n\nMicrosoft YaHei UI: added Light weight\n\nNirmala UI: added Semilight weight\n\nMyanmar Text: added Bold weight\n\nSegoe UI: Black and Black Italic weights added (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic only)\n\nCharacter coverage for previously supported Arabic and Hebrew scripts was extended in several fonts to include all characters in Unicode 6.2:\n\nArabic script: Arial, Courier New, Microsoft Sans Serif, Segoe UI, Tahoma, Times New Roman\n\nHebrew script: Aharoni Bold, Arial, Courier New, David, FrankRuehl, Levinim MT, Microsoft Sans Serif, Miriam, Miriam Fixed, Rod, Segoe UI, Tahoma, Times New Roman\n\nA significant font addition is the Segoe UI Emoji font, and color font support. Color fonts use an extension to the OpenType font specification. Color font rendering using the Segoe UI Emoji font allows emoji symbol characters to be displayed using full-color glyphs that are also scalable because they use TrueType glyph outlines. Color emoji display is supported in the DWrite text stack and enabled by default in the HTML and XAML application user interface frameworks used for Windows Store apps and in the Windows shell.\n\nAnother addition in Windows 8.1 is a collection of fonts with members optimized for different optical sizes: Sitka Small, Sitka Text, Sitka Subheading, Sitka Heading, Sitka Display, and Sitka Banner. These fonts are designed to be used together in documents with elements at different sizes to provide readability and typographic consistency. The Sitka fonts have basic Latin, Greek and Cyrillic coverage. They're intended for use for print or on-screen content, but not for user interface.\n\nWindows 8\n\nThe list of fonts included with Windows 8 is available in the Windows 8 font list.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 8, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Glagolitic Europe Segoe UI Symbol Historic Gothic Europe Segoe UI Symbol Historic Old Hangul East Asia Malgun Gothic Historic, used in historic Korean texts Old Italic Europe Segoe UI Symbol Historic Lisu China, Southeast Asia Segoe UI Lisu Myanmar Southeast Asia Myanmar Text Myanmar, Shan, Karen NâKo Africa Ebrima NâKo and other Manding languages Orkhon China Segoe UI Symbol Historic\n\nSome significant changes were introduced into Unicode version 5.2 in relation to the encoding of Old Hangul text. These changes enable products that can support Korean Standard KS X 1026-1:2007. In earlier versions of Windows, Uniscribe included support for shaping Old Hangul text, though not in accordance with the KS X 1026-1:2007 standard. In Windows 8, Uniscribe and DirectWrite provide support for Old Hangul text in accordance with the Korean standard, and font support for Old Hangul text is also now included.\n\nIn Windows 7, Unicode variation sequences were supported for certain scenarios only. In Windows 8, Unicode variation sequences are fully supported in GDI and DirectWrite text stacks. In particular, ideographic variation sequences used in Japan are supported, and the Japanese fonts in Windows 8 support several ideographic variation sequences.\n\nFor certain previously supported scripts, the fonts used for the Windows user interface were changed in Windows 8. In some cases, support for a script was added to an existing font (such as Segoe UI); in other cases, entirely new user interface fonts for those scripts were added. The user interface font changes are as follows:\n\nEbrima font: updated to add support for Ethiopic and NÊ¼Ko scripts\n\nGadugi font: new font for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and Cherokee scripts\n\nMicrosoft JhengHei UI: new font for Traditional Chinese script\n\nMicrosoft YaHei UI: new font for Simplified Chinese script\n\nNirmala UI: new font for South Asian scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu)\n\nSegoe UI (certain weights): updated to add support for Arabic, Armenian, Georgian (Mkhedruli), Georgian Khutsuri, Hebrew scripts\n\nAmong additional fonts added for previously supported scripts is the Urdu Typesetting font, which supports Arabic script in Nastaliq style (sometimes referred to as Perso-Arabic script).\n\nIn Windows 7, the Segoe UI Symbol font was added to provide support for many symbols encoded in Unicode. This font was significantly updated in Windows 8 to support many more symbols, including complete support for Emoji characters used in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nAmong other significant updates to fonts from Windows 7 is the addition of support for CJK Extension C and Extension D characters in the SimSun-ExtB and MingLiU-ExtB fonts.\n\nIn Windows 7, both Uniscribe and DirectWrite provided support for OpenType advanced typographic capabilities, including OpenType features, such as typographic small caps or stylistic sets, and language specific forms. This functionality wasn't supported in Windows user interface frameworks, however. As a result, advanced typographic capabilities were never visible in the Windows shell and weren't well supported in applications. These capabilities are better supported in Windows 8, enabling higher quality typography in the Windows Store apps developed for Windows 8. The CSS3 -ms-font-feature-settings property exposes OpenType capabilities and is supported in the MSHTML rendering engine used by IE10 and Windows Store apps built using HTML and JavaScript. For XAML, advanced OpenType capabilities that were supported in WPF and Silverlight are also supported in the Windows Runtime XAML framework.\n\nWindows 7\n\nThe list of fonts included with Windows 7 is available in the Windows 7 font list.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 7, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Braille - Segoe user interface Symbol - Deseret North America Segoe UI Symbol - New Tai Lue China Microsoft New Tai Lue Used for the Xishuangbanna Dai language Ogham Europe Segoe UI Symbol Historic, used for English and Irish Osmanya Africa Ebrima Historic script from East Africa (Somalia) Phags-pa North Asia Microsoft PhagsPa Historic, used for several languages including Mongolian, Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit Runic Europe Segoe UI Symbol - Symbols - Segoe UI Symbol - Tai Le China Microsoft Tai Le Used for the Dehong Dai language Tifinagh Africa Ebrima Used for Tamazight and other Amazigh languages Vai Africa Ebrima -\n\nNote: The Segoe UI Symbol font contains a subset of Unicode-encoded symbols. It isn't a symbol charset-encoded font.\n\nIn Windows 7, some true bold fonts were added to support better user interface display for Bangla, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Lao, Malayalam, Odia, Sinhala, Tamil and Telugu script. Some fonts for already-supported scripts were updated to include support for Unicode 5.1.\n\nWindows 7 added support for Unicode variation-selector sequences for Phags-pa script and math symbols. This support makes use of OpenType format 14 cmap subtables in Microsoft PhagsPa and Cambria Math fonts.\n\nAs part of on-going work to provide next-generation graphics, Windows 7 introduced a new text stack, DirectWrite. The OpenType and complex-script functionality that has been part of Uniscribe was fully integrated into the DirectWrite text stack with the result that the DirectWrite and GDI text stacks have complete parity in script and language support.\n\nWindows Vista\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows Vista, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Canadian Syllabics North America Euphemia Used for several languages, including Inuktitut and Cree Cherokee North America Plantagenet - Ethiopic Africa Nyala Used for Amharic, Tigrinya, and other languages Khmer Southeast Asia DaunPenh MoolBoran - Lao Southeast Asia DokChampa - Mongolian North Asia Mongolian Baiti - Odia Indian subcontinent Kalinga - Sinhala Indian subcontinent Iskoola Pota - Tibetan Central Asia Microsoft Himalaya - Yi China Microsoft Yi Baiti -\n\nIn Windows Vista and later versions, text-display support for all scripts and languages is always enabled in all editions.\n\nCharacter coverage for several already-supported scripts was extended to Unicode 4.1 or 5.0. Several fonts were updated accordingly. In particular, support for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Arabic was extended in the âcoreâ fonts:\n\nArial\n\nCourier New\n\nMicrosoft Sans Serif\n\nTahoma\n\nTimes New Roman\n\nThe new Aero-theme user interface font, Segoe UI, also provides Unicode 5.0 support for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Arabic. Unicode 5.0 additions were also made to other Arabic fonts and several of the Indic-script fonts.\n\nExtension B fonts for the SimSun and MingLiU families were added, as well as a variation of MingLiU with HKSCS support.\n\nThe Uighur language uses Arabic script, which was already supported. However, a different font is required for Uighur typography. The Microsoft Uighur font was added to support Uighur typography.\n\nUniscribeâs font fallback mechanism for Unicode supplementary planes was enhanced to support different fallback fonts depending on the starting font. In this way, fallback for CJK Extension B characters uses appropriate fonts for the given language. For example, for user interface displayed using the SimSun font (Simplified Chinese), the fallback font for Extension B is SimSun-ExtB.\n\nNew APIs were added to Uniscribe to support OpenType advanced typographic functionality in non-complex scripts. This provides a way for clients to expose advanced font capabilities such as language-specific glyphs; discretionary ligatures; true typographic small caps, superscripts and subscripts; old-style and tabular digits.\n\nWindows Vista includes the Cambria Math font, which has additional tables used to support layout of mathematical formulas. Note that special software support is also required to render math formulas. Mathematical formula support is provided in Microsoft Office 2007, but not in Windows Vista text-stack components.\n\nPrior to Windows Vista, Uniscribe had Arabic, Hebrew and Thai shaping engines that worked with legacy, pre-OpenType fonts, but not for fonts that support those scripts using OpenType glyph substitution and positioning mechanisms. The versions of fonts for Arabic, Hebrew and Thai included in Windows Vista were changed to use OpenType. This means that those fonts won't work with earlier versions of Uniscribe.\n\nWindows XP SP2\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows XP SP2, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Bangla Indian subcontinent Vrinda Used for the Assamese language and Bangla Malayalam Indian subcontinent Kartika -\n\nAs with Windows XP (RTM), the Regional and Language Options control panel (intl.cpl) has two option controls to enable âcomplex script and right-to-left languagesâ (Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana, Indic scripts and Thai) and CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). One effect of these options is to enable the Uniscribe component within the text stack. Whereas in the RTM version, Uniscribe isn't enabled by default in all SKUs, in SP2 it's always enabled by default.\n\nWindows XP\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows XP, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Gujarati Indian subcontinent Shruti - Gurmukhi Indian subcontinent Raavi Used in India for the Punjabi language Kannada Indian subcontinent Tunga - Syriac Middle East Estrangelo Edessa - Telugu Indian subcontinent Gautami - Thaana Indian subcontinent MV Boli Used for the Divehi language\n\nThe font fallback mechanism in Uniscribe was extended to support fallback for Unicode supplementary planes: for each plane from 1 to 16, a single fallback font can be specified in the registry.\n\nThis change, along with earlier changes in Windows 2000, to support supplementary-plane characters allows Windows XP to support CJK Extension B characters.\n\nNote: all of the scripts mentioned are supported on Windows XP, but enablement isn't activated for all of them on all language versions of Windows XP. The Regional and Language Options control panel (intl.cpl) has two option controls: one to enable âcomplex script and right-to-left languagesâ (Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana, Indic scripts and Thai), and one to enable CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Each of these might be enabled or disabled by default, depending on the language version. CJK fonts aren't installed by default on non-CJK versions but are included in the distribution media and will be installed when CJK support is enabled.\n\nWindows 2000\n\nWindows 2000 was the first version of the Windows operating system that included the Uniscribe component, usp10.dll. The lpk.dll library, which provides the interfaces between Uniscribe and various GDI and User APIs, was also added. Functional benefits of Uniscribe included:\n\nShaping support for complex scripts such as Arabic and Thai were brought together in a single library, allowing all language versions of Windows 2000 to be built from a single source and to display text in any supported script. Previously, text-display support for particular languages was added to localized versions.\n\nSome new complex scripts were supported.\n\nFont fallback for different scripts was provided. This is done in Uniscribe ScriptString* APIs that are typically used in user interface components.\n\nSupport for basic Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and CJK existed with APIs in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows ME. âBasicâ here means no combining marks, and Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane only. In relation to complex scripts, support for Arabic, Hebrew and Thai existed in previous versions and was consolidated in Windows 2000 in the Uniscribe component. Various GDI mechanisms that might have originated in East Asian versions (font association, EUDC font support, and âJPN98FixPitchâ display mode) were all present in the consolidated code base for Windows 2000.\n\nThe following table lists scripts newly supported in Windows 2000, and associated fonts:\n\nNew scripts Region where script is from Fonts Comments on language usage Armenian Eurasia Sylfaen - Devanagari Indian subcontinent Mangal Used for many languages including Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit Georgian Eurasia Sylfaen - Tamil Indian subcontinent Latha -\n\nIn a default setup, not all scripts are necessarily enabled. In the Regional Options control panel (intl.cpl), the General tab includes a list of 16 language/script categories (âlanguage groupsâ) that can be individually enabled or disabled. The language group for the UI language can't be disabled, however. When a language group is enabled, various support files are copied from the CD, including fonts. In the case of âcomplex-scriptâ language groups (Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai, and Vietnamese), registry entries to activate Uniscribe are also added.\n\nThe 16 language groups available on Windows 2000 are: Arabic, Armenian, Baltic, Central European, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Indic, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkic, Vietnamese, Western Europe and United States."
