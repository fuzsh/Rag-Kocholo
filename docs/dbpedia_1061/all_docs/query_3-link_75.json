Such stories have been deciphered by many speakers to interpret in many different ways and contexts to convey various forms of messages.\n\nHistory, along with civilizations, recorded many visual symbols which can be associated with certain set of values and they are popular in its way to convey a set of message. Flags and religious symbols are popular known examples of this category.\n\nWhen consciousness is to be expanded, we can definitely say languages are nothing but codes and, in a way, metaphor to communicate in different ways of phonetics and writings.\n\nDuring World War, when military codes were communicated, Alan Turing introduced the machine to decode messages using mathematics and probability. The world started getting new codes via computer languages, starting with binary language where the message is written using 0 and 1.\n\nMany times, I ask why Academy Awards has very few films in the comedy genre, and the answer is quite simple. Comedy is the only genre of metaphor which has the context of time and space. It means you can decode comedy codes if you are relevant to time and space (includes language, culture, and events), Hence we can find hardly any comedy films ( with dialogues ) has taken a space in classic films. Chaplin movies are without dialogues and had conveyed simple universal principles in visual way considered to be better communicated codes where language barrier was not found.\n\nIt may be possible to decode body language if you have the art to decipher such codes. Astrology and many other science also based on many codes and languages which need special information and knowledge to understand and so as to decipher."
