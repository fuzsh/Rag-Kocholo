        "text": "Purdys Chocolatier extends its accessible braille box beyond the holidays, after overwhelming demand.\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, Dec. 14, 2021 /CNW/ - The Holiday Braille Box is an accessible box of Purdys chocolates designed specifically for, and with consultation from, the blind and partially sighted community.\n\nThe initial run of the box sold out online in a matter of hours but will be available again in time for last minute holiday shopping. Purdys also announced that they will re-release the box in the new year in response to the overwhelming demand.\n\nThe box features braille orientation tabs, a braille chocolate legend and a QR code that brings users who are blind or partially sighted to an accessible screen reader version of the legend.\n\n\"The braille on the Purdys box is about more than accessibility, it's about inclusion. It's about feeling seen, heard, and cared about as a consumer and frankly, as a person,\" says Molly Burke, a leading digital creator in the blind and partially sighted community. \"Imagine going 27 years without being able to pick your own chocolates without the help of another person or technology, that's been my life until now. This is more than a box of chocolates, it's the sign of change.\"\n\nTo spread the joy even further, the full Purdys legend is also available in the 10 most spoken languages in Canada (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Mandarin, Cantonese, Punjabi, Tagalog and Arabic). The multilanguage legend is available to view at www.purdys.com/chocolate-legend.\n\nPurdys has also made a $10,000 CAD donation to the CNIB Foundation through Purple Partnerships, their philanthropic initiative.\n\nThe Holiday Braille Box will be available again to buy online at purdys.com from December 15, 2021 or at select shops across Canada starting December 22, 2021.\n\nPurdys shop locations that stock the Holiday Braille Box:\n\nBritish Columbia:\n\nPacific Centre\n\nPark Royal Shopping Centre\n\nCoquitlam Centre\n\nGuildford Town Centre\n\nHillside Shopping Centre\n\nWoodgrove Centre\n\nOrchard Park Shopping Centre\n\nVillage Green Shopping Centre\n\nAlberta:\n\nSouthcentre Mall\n\nChinook Centre\n\nSouthgate Centre\n\nManitoba:\n\nPolo Park\n\nOntario:\n\nOakville Place\n\nMapleview Centre\n\nOshawa Centre\n\nRideau Centre\n\nCarlingwood Shopping Centre\n\nToronto Eaton Centre\n\nAbout Purdys Chocolatier\n\nAs Canada's chocolatier since 1907, Purdys crafts delicious confections to go with everyday smiles, joyous celebrations and lifetimes of memories. Their commitment to quality ensures that every treat is made with sustainable cocoaâ€” helping not only their farmer partners but also protecting our planet.
