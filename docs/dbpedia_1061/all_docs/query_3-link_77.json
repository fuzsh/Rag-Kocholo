language is created for human communication and should not be a barrier for human communication.\n\nLanguage in a broad sense, includes oral language and written language, and in a narrow sense, it only refers to oral language. Oral language is referred to as spoken language or colloquial language, and written language is referred to as written language, commonly referred to as writing.\n\nspoken language or colloquial language\n\nwritten language is referred to as written language, commonly referred to as writing.\n\nSpoken language is transmitted orally and stored in people's memory relying on voice. Many spoken languages are lost in the long river of history with the passage of time; while written language is preserved and passed down through written symbols.\n\nFor a language that only has oral language it can create its own written language, that is, text, which records history\n\nthe Braille and sign language used by the visually impaired in various countries and the language used by the normal people in the country are two different means of communication, which cannot communicate; the Braille and sign language used by the visually impaired in various countries There are differences, which not only hinder the communication between the visually impaired, deaf-mute and normal people in the same country, but also affect the communication between the visually impaired and deaf-mute in different countries.\n\nthe new digital language inherits the phonology and expressive content of the language, and changes the writing form, retaining the root of the original language of human beings and highlighting the soul of the current language.\n\nthe unification of global languages can only be achieved if the unification of character-forming symbols of the current language is completed.\n\nthe new digital language has taken a solid first step to realize the unified language of all civilization, share the achievements of global integration, and jointly explore extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\nthe present invention aims at the deficiencies of the existing language technology, and provides a new language of ten Arabic digits from 0 to 9, covering the current global languages and corresponding Braille and sign language, newly created interpersonal language, Braille and sign language, and newly created interstellar language. And its input method and input tool.\n\nthe new digital language is a language that uses ten Arabic numerals from 0 to 9 as the unified character symbols of all languages (the character symbols are referred to as characters).\n\nthe newly created interpersonal language and corresponding Braille and sign language, and the newly created interstellar language are characterized in that the characters are ten Arabic numerals from 0 to 9 in the international universal code, and the phonetic symbols use ten consonants and vowels that are internationally interoperable, and the pronunciation in an internationally accepted note Mainly.\n\nthe writing method of ten Arabic numerals from 0 to 9 is the same all over the world, but the pronunciation is different in different countries and regions. It is a characteristic sound. Under the overall situation of unified pronunciation, people who use different languages can also pronounce their own characteristics. The sound is enough to reflect the unity of language and the combination of difference and diversity.\n\nthe characters of the digitized new language are divided into musical notes, semantic symbols and pictographs.\n\nMusical note is the abbreviation of phonetic symbol, is the pronunciation part of a word, is an essential part, and a word can have no meaning symbol, pictograph, but can not have no musical note.\n\nthe notes of the digital new language classify the pronunciation characteristics of various current languages, retain the \"charm\" of the last syllable in the original language, inherit the phonological sense of the original language, the melody of music, traditional poetry, The beautiful rhythms of prose and other genres are not destroyed.\n\nthe digital new language also digitally records the pronunciations of the current various languages according to the \"digital new language note table\", only the notes are taken, and no meanings are taken; for any language, each word can record up to 3 syllables and 6 characters, of which the last One syllable is required, for example:\n\nSemantic symbol is the abbreviation of semantic class symbol. Although the current human languages are different in font form, pronunciation, grammar, etc., regardless of the form of the language, the meanings expressed by them are related to each other, and the content is interlinked. Semantic categories are classified according to the meanings of words in different languages. The same semantic category has related meanings, and the same semantic symbols are used to connect various current languages. It runs through the ancient and modern times of various human languages and is the center that governs the meanings of all current languages. Nerves, in order to see the general meaning of the characters, similar to the role of the radicals of Chinese characters and the radicals of pinyin characters.\n\ntokens There are 110 categories of tokens, of which 1 token has 10 categories, and 2 tokens has 100 categories.\n\nthe identifiers of tokens are 1 meaning character is added above it, 2 meaning characters are added above the second meaning character, and the vowel of the meaning character has a long sound [:],\n\na symbol is an abbreviation for a symbol of a shape.\n\na pictograph is a supplementary component of a character. In the same language, it is added to avoid repetition of characters in a single character.\n\na pictograph is a character that can be saved.\n\nPictographs are the classification of basic letters or stroke shapes used in various languages, and basically reflect the sequence of letters and stroke shapes in various languages.\n\nthe following table has universal alphabets 1) Latin alphabet, 2) Arabic alphabet, 3) Cyrillic alphabet, and 4) Assamese alphabet, 5) Kannada alphabet, 6) Ethiopian alphabet, 7) Oriya alphabet , 8) Korean/Korean alphabet, 9) Sanskrit alphabet, 10) Georgian alphabet, 11) kanni alphabet, 12) Chinese strokes/phonetic alphabet, 13) Cambodian alphabet, 14) Kannada Alphabet, 15) Lao alphabet, 16) Maldivian alphabet, 17) Malayalam alphabet, 18) Manchu/Sibe alphabet, 19) Manipura alphabet, 20) Mongolian alphabet, 21) Bengali alphabet, 22) Burmese alphabet, 23) Punjabi alphabet, 24) Japanese alphabet, 25) Sinhala alphabet, 26) Telugu alphabet, 27) Tamil alphabet, 28) Vietnamese alphabet, 29) Hebrew letters, 30) Greek letters, 31) Armenian letters, 32) Vietnamese letters, 33) Vietnamese letters, 34) Javanese letters and other unique letters or pen shapes of a country or a nation;\n\nthe ten Arabic numerals from 0 to 9 contain both characters and numbers in the new digital language, and the characters and numbers have the same shape. When there is only 1 Arabic numeral, it is both text and number, and there is no difference; when there are 2 to 6 Arabic numerals, the distinction between characters and numbers lies in: adding a numeral symbol \" â \" before the Arabic numeral string indicates a number, and there is no character when indicating a character ; When two or more consecutive strings of Arabic numerals represent a number, a numeral symbol \" â \" must be added at the beginning and end; the characters do not have any symbols, and those with symbols represent numbers, regardless of whether the symbols are in the front, middle or back. Numbers can be pronounced one by one, and can also be used together with \"ten billion 05, billion 95, million 00, ten thousand 90, thousand 62, hundred 01, ten 75\", such as\n\nthe method of forming a new digital language includes characters and phrases, and each character and word has a maximum of 5 characters. Any character or word in the same language is unique and will not be repeated.\n\nword in the present invention refers to a single character or words. Words are divided into three parts: sound class, meaning class, and shape class, and each part expresses a different meaning. There are four situations in the formation of single characters:\n\nthe number of characters of a single character in a digital new language is relatively small, and words are formed from words as much as possible, sentences are formed from words, and sentences are formed from sentences.\n\nword in the present invention refers to a phrase or a phrase.\n\na phrase is a combination of two or more words. Using a phrase can reduce the number of characters and improve writing speed.\n\nWords composed of two words the first word takes the first 2 characters, and the second word takes the last 3 characters, that is, 2+3, the identifier appended to the second character, e.g.\n\nWords composed of four or more single characters the first, second and third single characters each take the first character, and the last single character takes the last two characters, that is, 1+1+1+2, the identifier appended to the fourth character, e.g. (New Chinese) is the \"new digital language\"(Chinese);\n\nWords and words are arranged linearly in a single line from left to right, three to five characters can also be arranged in two lines up and down, three characters are left and bottom each 1 right, four characters are up and down each 2, five characters are left and bottom each 2 right 1, 3 up and down when six characters appear.\n\nthree to five characters can also be arranged in two lines up and down, three characters are left and bottom each 1 right, four characters are up and down each 2, five characters are left and bottom each 2 right 1, 3 up and down when six characters appear.\n\nthe space occupied by the upper and lower rows is relatively small, and the length of the line of sight can be shortened, which can increase the reading volume of the unit, but it must be supported by a font library, just like the arrangement of Chinese and Korean characters in square characters.\n\nthe characters of large and small font sizes shall not exceed 3 at most.\n\nthe first character shall be in the same font size throughout the text, and the following one or two characters shall be in small font size.\n\nAlt and A use the same font size as the whole text, small four, and lt uses small five, that is, Alt is 048\n\na character of the digitized new language is exactly a syllable, and in order to simplify the number of syllables, each word, word only sends two syllables at most.\n\na character representing a word and a number, both of which have the same shape and sound\n\na character is a vowel with zero consonants, that is, there is no consonant before the vowel, The same as the token, but the difference is that it is added above the last character representing the note,\n\nTwo-syllable including 4 characters and 5 characters.\n\nthe first two characters are one syllable, and the method is the same as the pronunciation of the two characters; the last three characters are one syllable, and the method is the same as the pronunciation of the three characters;\n\nBraille is a communication tool for the visually impaired and an important means of participating in social life and receiving education.
