        "text": "© Abhishek Avtans\n\nBharati Braille [भारती ब्रेल] is a semi-unified system for Indian languages that enables blind & visually impaired people to read & write through touch. It is a linearized alpha-syllabary where each Braille character roughly represents an Indian grapheme.\n\nBharati Braille is based on the 6 dot standard Braille system which was adopted for Indian languages in 1951. Bharati Braille for each individual language (e.g. Hindi, Odia) differs in a few Braille characters to accommodate some language specific phonological peculiarities.\n\nIn fact, before Indian independence there were 11 different Braille scripts in vogue in India. In 1950 at Paris, @UNESCO organized “World Braille Conference” which helped standardize “Bharati Braille” for Indian languages.\n\nIn India it is used for writing Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Punjabi, Assamese, Malayalam, Nepali, Odia, Telugu, & Urdu. Bharati Braille is also adopted with some changes to write Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, Nepali in Nepal and Bengali in Bangladesh.\n\nYou can convert any Devanagari text into Bharati Braille using this handy converter for free – E.g. निकास nikās (exit) —> ⠝⠊⠅⠜⠎ https://bharati-braille.pareidolic.in\n\nThis converter has its limitations but it is a open source application. More work can be done on this excellent tool by concerned organizations using the source code available here\n\nhttps://github.com/pareidolic/bharati-braille\n\nHere’s is Mr. Manoj Yadav of Delhi, the winner of “Drishti Essay Competition” reading out from his essay written in Bharati Braille."
