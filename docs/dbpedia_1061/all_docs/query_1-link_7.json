        "text": "Braille is a series of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or whose eyesight is not sufficient for reading printed material. Teachers, parents, and others who are not visually impaired ordinarily read braille with their eyes. Braille is not a language, rather, it is a code by which languages such as English, Spanish or Punjabi may be written and read. This document presents various aspects which are not revealed yet in Indian languages such as Punjabi. Various Punjabi scripts define different meaning. As braille is needed to be explored much to make people literate to make them lead their life at full ease. In this paper we tried to unveil various such aspects which have not came into light. It also delivers the information regarding Braille lipi in detail and emphasis on why actually we need to do such efforts in detail. It also tells about the available softwares Index: abbreviation, scanning, symbols, alignment.\n\nCOPYRIGHT AGREEMENT AND AUTHORSHIP RESPONSIBILITY\n\nÂ All paper submissions must carry the following duly signed by all the authors:\n\nâ€œI certify that I have participated sufficiently in the conception and design of this work and the analysis of the data (wherever applicable), as well as the writing of the manuscript, to take public responsibility for it.
