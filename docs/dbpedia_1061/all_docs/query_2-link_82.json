        "text": "Testing\n\nLast week we released the first version of the Bharati Braille Converter that could translate Hindi and Marathi (in the Devanagari script) to Bharati Braille. Currently we're working towards adding more languages to the converter. If you're a fluent speaker and writer of Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Tamil or Telugu, you could help us!\n\nAs the About page explains, the conversion between Indian languages and Bharati Braille is not a straightforward mapping. We're designing tests to check if the converter is translating accurately, especially the complex bits. These tests address issues such as whether akhand ligatures are being formed; is the schwa idiosyncracy being handled properly; and, are numbers and punctuation marks working well with text.\n\nIf you would like to help us write test documents for the languages listed above, write to us at talk[at]pareidolic[dot]in, or contact Pooja or Nirbheek on Twitter.\n\nBharati Braille\n\nIf you or anyone you know is fluent in Bharati Braille, we would love to hear from you. We are looking for people who can use the converter and test it for us. In addition, if you happen to know of any resources besides the NAB Bharati Braille Shikshak such as books or publications that explain Bharati Braille, please let us know so we can expand our knowledge base. Once again, you can get in touch with us at talk[at]pareidolic[dot]in, or Twitter: Pooja or Nirbheek."
