        "text": "The vice-chancellor described the work as pioneering and “rarest of rare” that can happen only with the divine grace. As it will facilitate the visually impaired to read Guru Granth Sahib, it will also help popularise the Sikh tradition in a big way. Without this work of Bhai Gurmej Singh, the Sikh history would have remained incomplete and lacking in direction, he added. He congratulated the head of the department of gurmat sangeet Dr Gurnam Singh for his consistent efforts aimed at promoting and furthering the cause of the Sikh divine music through various means\n\nIn his welcome address, Dr Gurnam Singh described the work as a “big leap forward” in the Sikh tradition and culture. It is not only of a great historical significance, but also exclusive and first-of-its kind in the realms of the Sikh history. With this, the department has once again come to occupy the centre-stage in furthering the cause of the gurmat tradition. The department, he said, would further strengthen its efforts to popularise the Sikh tradition in all possible ways.\n\nDr Roop Singh, Secretary of the SGPC, Dr Balkar Singh, Director of the newly established Gurcharan Singh Tohra Institute of Sikh Studies, philanthropist, Prof Kulwant Grewal, and Surjit Singh Garhi were also present on the occasion.\n\nDOCUMENTARY ON DUKH NIVARAN SAHIB RELEASED\n\nMeanwhile, Punjabi University vice-chancellor Dr Jaspal Singh also released a documentary on Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib here at the Gurmeet Sangeet Bhawan. The documentary has been made by Gurpreet Singh Cheema, a former student of the university’s Centre for Advanced Media Studies (CAMS). The 25-minute documentary shows the history of the gurdwara.\n\nGurpreet Singh said it was just a small contribution towards the Sikhism and had would continue to make such efforts. He hoped that views would definitely like the documentary as it would pro vide a chance for them to know more about the rich heritage and culture of Punjab. He said that he mainly focused on the history of the gurdwara and took almost two years to complete the project\n\nThe VC Singh applauded his efforts and said making a documentary without any support is a big achievement. He said it a need of the hour to promote our culture and traditions.\n\nThe script and voice have been given by Professor Tejinder Sharma while music by Jaswinder Singh and Kuldeep Panwar. Gurmeet Mann, director, Centre for Advanced Media Studies, also lauded the efforts of Gurpreet Singh."
