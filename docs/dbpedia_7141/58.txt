Rio Tinto has shared its fourth quarter production results, including an increase in iron ore production and shipments from the previous quarter.

According to the report, Rio Tinto produced a total of 3,272kt of aluminium, 620kt of mined copper (consolidated basis) and 1,111kt of titanium dioxide slag in 2023.

There was 87.5Mt of iron ore (100 per cent basis) produced and 86.3Mt shipped (100 per cent basis) in Q4 2024. Production for Q4 was up five percent from Q3 2023, but down two per cent from Q4 2022. Shipment of iron ore was up three percent from Q3 2023 and down one per cent from Q4 2022. In total, 331.5Mt of iron ore was produced, and 331.8Mt was shipped in 2023.

Rio Tinto produced 15.1Mt of bauxite in Q4 2024 – a 15 per cent increase from Q4 2022 and an eight per cent increase from Q3 2023 – with a total production of 54.6Mt of bauxite in 2023.

Q4 2023 key points:

Rio Tinto achieved its fifth consecutive year with no fatalities at its managed operations. There were, however, two permanent disabling injuries in 2023. Rio Tinto is applying learnings from these to enhance processes across its operations

Pilbara operations produced 331.5Mt (100 per cent basis) of iron ore, two per cent higher than 2022. The report attributes this to improved productivity, supported by ongoing implementation of the Safe Production System, and the ramp-up of Gudai-Darri to its nameplate capacity of 43Mt per annum, within 12 months of commissioning, more than offset mine depletion. Shipments were 331.8Mt (100 per cent basis), three per cent higher (an increase of ten million tonnes) than 2022 and the second highest on record, with healthy inventory positions at year-end

On 18 October, Rio Tinto announced plans to increase iron ore production capacity at Gudai-Darri by 7Mt to 50Mt a year through incremental productivity gains, at a cost of around USD$70 million. The capacity increase is subject to environmental, heritage and other relevant approvals

Bauxite production of 54.6Mt in 2023 was unchanged from 2022. Operations saw a continued improvement in the fourth quarter, with production eight per cent higher than the prior quarter, following the challenges of higher-than-average rainfall at Weipa in the first quarter and equipment downtime at both Weipa and Gove in the first half

Aluminium production of 3.3Mt was nine percent higher than 2022 after Rio Tinto returned to full capacity at the Kitimat smelter in Canada and completed cell recovery efforts at Boyne during the third quarter. All other smelters continued to demonstrate stable performance

Titanium dioxide slag (TiO2) production of 1,111kt was seven per cent lower than 2022

Rio Tinto is now deploying its Safe Production System at approximately 60 per cent of its sites, with implementation at various stages of maturity. Key performance highlights include a 20 per cent yearly improvement in all injury frequency rate (AIFR) globally where the Safe Production System has been deployed, as well as a five million tonne uplift in iron ore production. With eight Safe Production System deployment sites having achieved their best ever demonstrated production in recent months, Rio Tinto is well positioned to deliver its 2024 priorities, including a further five million tonne uplift at its Pilbara operations

On Friday 6 December 2023, Rio Tinto held its Investor Seminar in Sydney where an update was provided on its long-term strategy of investing with discipline to strengthen operations, delivering growth in a decarbonising world and continuing to generate attractive shareholder returns

The full year cash outflow from an increase in working capital was comparable to the first half (USD$0.9 billion outflow in the first half of 2023). This movement was driven by healthy stocks in the Pilbara, still elevated in-process inventory at Kennecott in the US following the smelter rebuild and weaker market conditions including for titanium dioxide feedstock. Receivables also reflected a higher iron ore price at the end of 2023 that will be monetised in 2024

Subsequent to the end of the period, Dampier Salt Limited entered into a sales agreement for the Lake MacLeod salt and gypsum operation in Carnarvon, Western Australia, with privately-owned salt company Leichhardt Industrials Group for USD$251 million. Completion of the sale is subject to certain commercial and regulatory conditions being satisfied

There were also four changes to the Rio Tinto Board during the fourth quarter. On 25 October 2023, James “Joc” O’Rourke was appointed as a Non-Executive Director. On 15 December 2023, Rio Tinto confirmed that Dr Megan Clark had stepped down as a Non-Executive Director after nine years on the Board. On 22 December 2023, it was announced that Martina Merz had been appointed as a Non-Executive Director and on the same day, it was announced Sharon Thorne had been appointed as a Non-Executive Director.

Rio Tinto Chief Executive, Jakob Stausholm, said, “There is good demand for the materials we produce, and our purpose and long-term strategy make more sense than ever. The work we are doing today is creating a stronger Rio Tinto for years to come, as we invest in profitable growth while continuing to deliver attractive shareholder returns.

“We continue to work hard to transform our culture and to invest in deep engagement and partnerships with Traditional Owners, such as our agreement to explore renewable energy projects with the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation.”
