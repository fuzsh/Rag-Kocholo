        "text": "WYNYARD, UK, Oct. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Venator Materials PLC (\"Venator\" or the \"Company\"), a global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products, has successfully completed its Chapter 11 recapitalization process and has emerged with an improved balance sheet and lower debt. The Company is now better positioned to address macroeconomic and market challenges. Venator's recapitalization plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on July 25, 2023.\n\nVenator entered into a restructuring process following unprecedented macroeconomic headwinds, including significantly lower product demand and higher raw material and energy costs. The Company has significantly reduced its debt from more than $1 billion to approximately $200 million upon emergence. The majority of the Company's recapitalized equity is now owned by its former lenders by virtue of the equitization of the Company's prepetition debt. It is expected that the Company's credit rating will improve in due course to reflect its improving credit profile.\n\nIn connection with its emergence, Venator has formed a new Board of Directors for the reorganized company comprised of senior executives who have extensive experience and sector expertise, to guide the future strategic direction of the Company. The new Board members are: Katherine Harper (Chairperson), Arjen de Leeuw Den Bouter, Bart de Jong, E. Bryan Snell and Fried-Walter Münstermann. Their biographies are below. Both Simon Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jame Donath, who was appointed to the Board in January 2023 in connection with the recapitalization process, will retain their existing Board positions.\n\nSimon Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Venator, said: \"Against the backdrop of unprecedented macroeconomic headwinds, we have stayed focused on stabilising the business and acting in the best interests of our stakeholders. The recapitalization provides us with an improved capital structure and balance sheet. We are now better positioned to address what continues to be a challenging market. Venator has great potential for long-term future growth and the new Board will work closely alongside management to develop a strategy to drive sustainable value for our stakeholders. Thank you to the Venator team around the world, our creditors, advisors, and of course our customers and vendors for your confidence and support throughout this process. I would also like to thank the outgoing Board members for their hard work and dedication.\"\n\nIn connection with the pre-packaged Chapter 11 and recapitalization process, Venator has been assisted by Moelis & Company and Kirkland & Ellis as respective financial and legal advisors, in addition to Alvarez & Marsal as operational advisor and Epiq Corporate Restructuring, LLC as claims, noticing, and solicitation agent.
