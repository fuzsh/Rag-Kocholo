        "text": "Raw material production increased by 2% year-on-year in 2023\n\nIn 2023, the British-Australian mining concern Rio Tinto increased shipments of iron ore from the Pilbara region by 3% compared to 2022, to 331.8 million tons. This was the second highest figure in the company’s history. This is evidenced by data published by Rio Tinto.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, shipments of raw materials increased by 3% q/q – to 86.3 million tons. Compared to the same period of the previous year, shipments decreased by 1%.\n\nLast year, iron ore production at Rio Tinto’s Pilbara operations increased by 2% year-on-year – to 331.5 million tons. In October-December, this figure amounted to 87.5 million tons, up 5% compared to the third quarter and down 2% year-on-year.\n\nThe company expects iron ore shipments from the Pilbara region to remain at 323-338 million tons this year, as previously forecast. Rio Tinto will ship more low-grade iron ore (SP10) until the replacement projects are commissioned. The miner notes that the supply of raw materials remains dependent on weather conditions."
