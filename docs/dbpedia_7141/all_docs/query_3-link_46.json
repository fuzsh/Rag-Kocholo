        "text": "What is Titanium Dioxide?\n\nTitanium Dioxide is an industrial chemical made up of the elements titanium and oxygen. Titanium Dioxide is also known as Titania and its chemical formula is TiO2. It is a white powder that is tasteless and odorless. It comes in the forms:\n\nRutile Titanium Dioxide 94% (Sulfate R-298)\n\nRutile Titanium Dioxide (Sulfate R-248)\n\nTitanium Oxide Rutile Pigment CR-350 (Chloride)\n\nThis chemical has many industrial uses, but it is most commonly used in paints and varnishes.\n\nTitanium Dioxide Uses\n\nTitanium Dioxide is an extremely useful chemical. It is a special use chemical most popularly used in paints and varnishes. Its uses are:\n\nas a pigment in paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines, and most toothpastes;\n\nin fibers;\n\nin the making of cosmetics products;\n\nthe production of pure titanium;\n\nin the manufacturing of glass and glass ceramics;\n\nn chemical processes as a catalyst and chemical intermediate.\n\nAs a thin film for excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors.\n\nMaking decorative thin films.\n\nin the making of a pearlescent pigment called Iriodin.\n\nas sunscreens and UV blocking pigments in cosmetics and skincare products.\n\nAs a sunscreen it is very effective because it lowers the risk of sunburns and problems associated with excessive long-term exposure to the sun.\n\nin ceramic glazes as an opacifier.\n\nIt is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils.\n\nin the food industry as a whitener and smoother. It gives the food a fresh and appealing look.\n\nIs Titanium Dioxide Safe?\n\nTitanium Dioxide is generally considered unsafe because the chemical is toxic. Exposure to this chemical can have acute health effects. According to the MSDS of Titanium Dioxide 94% (Sulfate R-298), MSDS of Titanium Dioxide (Sulfate R-248), and MSDS of Titanium Oxide Rutile Pigment CR-350 (Chloride) it can cause mild eye irritation. It may be absorbed through the skin and cause mild skin irritation. It can be very harmful if ingested because it may cause digestive tract irritation, pain constipation, or diarrhea. It may also cause ataxia, increased blood pressure, hallucinations, hyper-motility, muscle contraction/spasticity, fatigue, psychosis and tremors. Furthermore, it may also cause respiratory tract irritation. Proper storage and disposal of Titanium Dioxide needs to be taken into consideration in order to avoid any unwanted effects.\n\nHow is Titanium Dioxide Made?\n\nIndustrially, Titanium Dioxide is made by the mineral ilmenite. Ilmenite is converted to pigment grade titanium dioxide by chloride or sulfate process. The sulfate process includes treatment of ilmenite with sulfuric acid. The product is then further processed according to the requirements.\n\nIn the chloride process the ilmenite reacts with elemental chlorine. This converts ilmenite to titanium tetrachloride. This is then distilled and reacts with oxygen to produce titanium dioxide.\n\nWhere to Buy Titanium Dioxide in Bulk?\n\nYou may be able to find small quantities of Titanium Dioxide in your area. However, in order to buy large quantities of Titanium Dioxide, it is preferable to import directly from the manufacturers. They can issue certifications and provide cost savings which is better than buying the chemical in small quantities locally or from a distributor.\n\nIf you require bulk quantities of this chemical, you can buy Titanium Dioxide on our website or contact us for further details.\n\nWhich Countries Manufacture Titanium Dioxide in Bulk?\n\nThe consumption of Titanium Dioxide has increased dramatically across the world, especially in developing countries. Therefore, its huge demand has led to a surge in companies that produce it. The main producers of Titanium Dioxide are:\n\nChina\n\nUnited States of America\n\nGermany\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nJapan\n\nHow is Titanium Dioxide Exported?\n\nRutile Titanium Dioxide 94% (Sulfate R-298), Rutile Titanium Dioxide (Sulfate R-248), and Titanium Oxide Rutile Pigment CR-350 (Chloride) are shipped in:\n\n25kg bags\n\n500kg bags\n\n1000kg bags\n\nWhat is the Latest Titanium Dioxide Price?\n\nAs Titanium Dioxide is a commodity product, the price usually changes depending on the price of raw materials, logistics, and other related industrial inputs such as labor and taxes. In order to get the latest price of Titanium Dioxide, please contact us and we will provide a quote right up to your country.\n\nWhere to Buy Titanium Dioxide?"
