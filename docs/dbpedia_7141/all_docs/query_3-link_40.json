        "text": "What is titanium dioxide?\n\nTitanium is a common metal element frequently found throughout nature. In our environment, titanium is naturally exposed to oxygen, forming titanium oxides that we find in many minerals, dusts, sands, and soils.\n\nTitanium dioxide is one of the many oxides formed naturally in our environment. Manufacturers source this mined mineral from rutile, brookite, and anatase. It is then processed and refined to meet stringent safety guidelines based on the end-use for the mineral.\n\nTitanium dioxide is an insoluble mineral, meaning it cannot dissolve in water. Known for its bright, white pigment, manufacturers use titanium dioxide in many different capacities, including in cosmetics, foods, and drugs.\n\nWhen manufacturers add titanium dioxide to foods and other ingestible products, it’s typically referred to as E171, which relates to food-grade purity.\n\nWhat does titanium dioxide do?\n\nTitanium dioxide can amplify and brighten white opacity because of its exceptional light-scattering properties. In food and drugs, these properties help to define colors clearly and can prevent products from UV degradation.\n\nIn cosmetics, titanium dioxide’s properties enhance coloration and can help protect skin from damaging UVA and UVB rays.\n\nWhat is an exposure route?\n\nExposure routes are the pathways that allow ingredients to enter our bodies. Primary exposure routes include:\n\nour digestive tract through eating and drinking.\n\ntopically via our skin.\n\nthrough our respiratory tract by breathing.\n\noccasionally, through our blood and eyes.\n\nHow are we typically exposed to titanium dioxide?\n\nThere are many ways we’re exposed to titanium dioxide in our everyday life. Below are the most common ways we encounter titanium dioxide.\n\nDigestive System Exposure\n\nWe’re most often exposed to E171 through the foods we ingest. We find E171 in many food products, like popsicles, ice cream, gum, and more. Another way we ingest E171 is through pharmaceutical drugs. Many pills and capsules contain E171 as an inactive ingredient.\n\nLess frequently, we ingest E171 through liquids such as salad dressing, dairy products, and some artificially colored drinks. However, since E171 is insoluble, manufacturers must use other stabilizers to keep E171 suspended in liquids as an emulsion; otherwise, it will settle to the bottom.\n\nTopical Exposure\n\nWe apply titanium dioxide to our skin through sunscreens, makeup, lip balms, nail polish, and other cosmetic products.\n\nWe even use titanium dioxide when brushing our teeth as it’s found in many toothpastes.\n\nRespiratory Exposure\n\nIn industrial settings, people can be exposed to titanium dioxide through inhalation. Inhalation exposure to titanium dioxide is exceedingly rare for most people.\n\nWhy does the exposure route matter, and what's the risk?\n\nHow we’re exposed to an ingredient matters greatly in terms of our long-term health.\n\nResearch shows that inhaling titanium dioxide particles in significant quantities over time can cause adverse health outcomes. Unless you work in an industrial setting, inhaling substantial amounts of titanium dioxide is highly unlikely.\n\nResearch supports that applying titanium dioxide to the skin in the form of sunscreens, makeup, and other topical products does not pose any health risks.\n\nOverwhelmingly, research that’s relevant to human eating patterns shows us that E171 is safe when ingested normally through foods and drugs (1,2).\n\nOther research suggests that E171 could cause harm; however, those research processes did not consider how people are typically exposed to E171. Research that adds E171 to drinking water, utilizes direct injections, or gives research animals E171 through a feeding apparatus is not replicating typical human exposure.\n\nLet’s break the risk down further.\n\nIn food products, E171 is not a singular ingredient; it’s always combined with other ingredients (e.g., proteins and fats) in the food product. Digesting food is a slow process for the body compared to drinking a beverage, which passes much faster through the body.\n\nWhen E171 is part of a food product, it passes through the digestive system without causing harm because E171 combines with the other ingredients.\n\nIn some studies, E171 was given to animals in drinking water without the stabilizers that keep E171 suspended in the liquid. Without stabilizers, E171 can settle and prevent the ingredient from combining with surrounding ingredients.\n\nWhen E171 isn’t combined with other ingredients and administered in water, some studies suggest that under these artificial conditions, E171 may be processed differently in the body resulting in some biological changes in experimental animals that are poorly understood.\n\nHowever, humans are not exposed to E171 in drinking water at any significant quantity over a long duration, so this potential effect is irrelevant to the human experience. It’s important to understand that a potential hazard is not the same thing as an actual risk.\n\nThe good news.\n\nAs we’ve discussed in previous posts, a hazard is not a risk. Knowing that something could cause harm in a specific situation that we’re unlikely to experience can help us make sound decisions.\n\nUnderstanding the real risk verse the theoretical risk helps us to understand how emerging research can be applied to our daily lives."
