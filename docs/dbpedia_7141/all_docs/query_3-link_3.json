        "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assessed the safety of titanium dioxide pigment as a color additive in food, drug and cosmetic applications. FDA allows for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods, and has stated that titanium dioxide may be safely used in cosmetics, including cosmetics intended for use around the eye. FDA also regulates the safety and effectiveness of sunscreen active ingredients, including nanoscale titanium dioxide. A recent state of the science report from Health Canada has also affirmed the safety of titanium dioxide in food.\n\nGet answers to frequently asked questions about sunscreen safety.\n\nWorkers at titanium dioxide manufacturing plants and downstream value-chain manufacturing plants where titanium dioxide is used can be exposed to titanium dioxide dust. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for titanium dioxide total dust and requires employers to control workplace exposure below that PEL.\n\nConsumer exposure to titanium dioxide dust is generally presumed to be extremely low, because titanium dioxide is typically fully incorporated into the end product in which it is used.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assessed the safety of titanium dioxide pigment as a color additive in food, drug and cosmetic applications, and as an ingredient in sunscreen products. FDA has also issued guidance clarifying the safe use of titanium dioxide pigment as a food colorant and has stated that titanium dioxide may be safely used in cosmetics, including cosmetics intended for use around the eye.\n\nRecently, Health Canada has reaffirmed the safety of titanium dioxide in food. In its comprehensive state of the science report, Health Canada’s Food Directorate said it “did not identify any compelling health concerns for the use of TiO2 as a food additive in the course of this review.”\n\nPigment-grade titanium dioxide is manufactured at a specific particle size distribution to optimize the scattering of visible light and enhance surface opacity. Titanium dioxide is produced primarily in the pigmentary form (over 98 percent of total production), which makes use of its excellent light-scattering properties for a range of applications that depend upon opacity and brightness.\n\nTitanium dioxide nanomaterials are purposefully made in a much smaller particle size distribution than pigmentary particles and are transparent and typically more effective as UV absorbers or photocatalysts. The transparency and UV absorbance allow for effective use as a protective ingredient for sunscreens."
