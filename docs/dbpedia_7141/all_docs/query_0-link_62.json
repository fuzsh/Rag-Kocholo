        "text": "Main Uses\n\nTitanium dioxide is used primarily as a white pigment in paints, vinyl compounds, enamels, plastics, specialty papers, inks, foods, toothpastes and cosmetics, and skin care products.[2,23] It is the most commonly used pigment worldwide, accounting for 70% of global volume of pigments produced.[23] For optimum pigment properties, particle size is controlled within 0.2 to 0.4 micrometers.[24]\n\nTitanium dioxide is also used in sunscreens to protect skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It is often used in nanoparticle size ranges, since small size increases scattering of UV radiation.[24]\n\nNanoparticles\n\nTitanium dioxide tends to be used in its ultrafine size range, which are nanoparticles measuring fewer than 100 nanometers. Nanomaterials have unique properties electronically, optically, mechanically, and chemically, which make them useful in a variety of industrial applications. However, the health and environmental effects of these particles are not well understood.[25]\n\nThe toxicity of nanomaterials often differs compared to the same compound in a larger size fraction. For example, the two distinct crystalline forms of titanium dioxide (anatase and rutile), differ significantly in toxicity (anatase is 100 times more cytotoxic than rutile).[25]"
