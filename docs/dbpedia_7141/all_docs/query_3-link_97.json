It is synthesized from the mineral ilmenite (FeO.TiO2), using a sulfate or chloride process for nearly 100 years. It can confer whiteness and opacity on various products, such as paints, papers, and cosmetics act as a dispersive agent, flocculent, and whitening agent. It has light-scattering properties and a very high refractive index, thus effectively giving a white opaque coating by using a low level of pigment. Nano-sized titanium oxide particles (also called ultrafine, nanocrystalline, or microcrystalline) with a diameter of less than 100nm are used in sunscreens because they block ultraviolet radiation while remaining transparent on the skin. The product has a wide scope of application in coatings of photovoltaic cells as a photoactive material owing to its efficiency in improving the performance of dye-based cells including dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, polymer-inorganic hybrid solar cells, inorganic solid-state solar cells, and perovskite solar cells. Rutile and ilmenite are the major minerals of titanium dioxide. Rutile is found in metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous rocks, widely used for the production of titanium metal and as pigments. Titanium dioxide combined with other colored pigments is applied in numerous end-users, including automotive coatings, aircraft coating, marine coatings, and architecture & decorative coatings. Titanium dioxide used in the cosmetic industry is regulated under 21 CFR Volume 1 Sec. 73.25 and Sec. 352.10 and can be used for coloring effect and as sunscreen active ingredient respectively.\n\nReport Coverage\n\nThis research report categorizes the market for the global titanium dioxide market based on various segments and regions forecasts revenue growth and analyzes trends in each submarket. The report analyses the key growth drivers, opportunities, and challenges influencing the global titanium dioxide market. Recent market developments and competitive strategies such as expansion, product launch, and development, partnership, merger, and acquisition have been included to draw the competitive landscape in the market. The report strategically identifies and profiles the key market players and analyses their core competencies in each sub-segment of the global titanium dioxide market.\n\nDriving Factors\n\nThe growing construction activities including both residential and non-residential infrastructure, positively influence the demand for paints & coatings, thereby creating significant demand for titanium dioxide. For instance, the housing market is growing steadily in the US driving the titanium dioxide market in the region. In decorative paints and coatings, titanium dioxide has a self-cleaning ability and protection against bacteria, algae, fungi, and pollution and also ensures ease of application, a long-lasting fresh look, fewer coatings, and easy cleaning surfaces. The high disposable income of consumers as estimated by OECD increases the purchasing power of titanium dioxide to improve the standard of living. The growing focus on aesthetic and visual appearance in architecture is promoting the demand for paints and coatings, thereby positively influencing the market demand for titanium dioxide. The technological advancement and innovation in materials, manufacturing processes, and digital technology enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of ultrafine titanium dioxide products and services. The increasing population, urbanization, and changing consumer preferences are other significant factors responsible for market growth.\n\nRestraining Factors\n\nStringent environmental policies of the government, especially APAC, and EU, banned the use of titanium dioxide to control emissions and ensure careful disposal of the waste that is produced during the sulfate process to manufacture titanium dioxide. The growing demandâ€“supply gap acts as a restraining factor in the market. The use of TiO2 mimicking substitutes, such as antimony oxide, carbonates, and zinc oxide, or its combination challenges the market demand for TiO2.\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nThe Global Titanium Dioxide Market share is classified into grade, product process, and application.\n\nThe rutile segment is expected to hold the largest share of the global titanium dioxide market during the forecast period.\n\nBased on the grade, the global titanium dioxide market is divided into anatase and rutile.
