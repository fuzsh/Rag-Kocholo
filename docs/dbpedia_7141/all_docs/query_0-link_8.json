        "text": "Rio Tinto’s exploration arm – Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration – will subscribe for an initial 83.09 million shares in Sovereign Metals at a price of 48.6c each, reflecting a a 10% premium to the explorer’s 45-day volume weighted average share price.\n\nThe mining giant will also be granted an option over a further 34.54 million shares, with a 12-month option period, which could see Rio’s share in Sovereign increase to 19.99%.\n\nSovereign will use the funds to advance a definitive feasibility study for its Kasiya project in Malawi, where it aims to produce graphite for lithium-ion batteries and rutile for the pigment and titanium metal industries.\n\n“This landmark agreement is a confirmation of Kasiya’s place as one of the most significant critical mineral discoveries in recent times,” Sovereign chairman Ben Stoikovich said in the statement.\n\nThe companies will collaborate on technical and marketing aspects for a graphite product from the project, with a focus on supplying purified graphite for the lithium-ion battery anode market."
