        "text": "Innovation at RTIT Quebec Operations\n\nThroughout its history, RTIT Quebec Operations has always improved its processes. After first pioneering a new technique for processing ilmenite, we took on the challenge of diversifying our product line as RTIT targeted the metal powder and steel markets.\n\nSeveral technological breakthroughs then sharpened the competitive edge of our products. In the 1990s and early 2000s, we focused on developing, marketing, and fine-tuning the UGS process, which produces slag with a very high titanium dioxide content. By developing UGS™, an enriched titanium slag sold to pigment producers that use the chloride process, and RTCS (Rio Tinto chloride slag), a slag made from Madagascar mineral sand, RTIT Quebec Operations secured a strong position in a flourishing market. Over the last decade, we’ve continued to diversify our products with the introduction of RTCS-A™ titanium slag, the development of new steel powders for additive manufacturing (3D printing), and the production of scandium oxide from a tailings stream.\n\nIn 2022, RTIT Quebec Operations became the first North American producer of scandium, a critical mineral used in solid oxide fuel cells and aluminium alloys. Rio Tinto now plans to quadruple its production capacity from the current nameplate capacity of 4 tonnes to up to 12 tonnes of scandium oxide per year.\n\nDecarbonisation of our operations\n\nRTIT Quebec Operations is looking for better ways to decarbonise its operations, with the aim of achieving a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nIn partnership with the Government of Canada, Rio Tinto has pledged to invest up to C$733 million by 2030 to decarbonise its operations in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, and position Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations as a centre of excellence for critical minerals processing.\n\nScientists at the Critical Minerals and Technology Centre in Sorel-Tracy have pioneered BlueSmelting™, an innovative technology that involves the pre-reduction of ilmenite ore before it is processed in the reduction furnaces. By integrating BlueSmelting™ into our process, we could reduce the amount of energy required to transform the ore by using green hydrogen, among other sources, as a reducing agent.\n\nCritical Minerals and Technology Centre\n\nRTIT Quebec Operations was founded on research and development (R&D), and R&D continue to drive our growth strategy today. The addition of a Technology Centre in 1967 underlined the strategic role that R&D plays at RTIT. The Centre’s mission is to improve our processes, thereby expanding our markets and enhancing the value of our products. Having a team of specialists in a wide range of science and technology fields who provide cutting-edge services and support to RTIT Quebec Operations, Richards Bay Minerals (RBM), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), and RTIT customers is our biggest strength.\n\nToday, RTIT Quebec Operations is among the 100 most active companies in research and development in Canada.\n\nResearch has an impact on all areas of activity at RTIT, from mining to finished products. The research process is one of constant synergy between research staff and production operations personnel, with all research conducted on site. The Critical Minerals and Technology Centre boasts state-of-the-art equipment and highly specialised instruments, including reactors and other equipment to simulate our processes at the laboratory and pilot levels, as well as inductively coupled plasma spectrometers, X-ray spectrometers, atomic absorption units, gas and image analysers, scanning electron microscopes, and a 3D printer for metals.\n\nResearch and development\n\nRTIT Quebec Operations were founded on research and development and they continue to drive our growth strategy.

There, Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations operates the largest open‑pit mine in Quebec.\n\nThe mine is notable not only for its size but also for the quality of the ore extracted there. The mined ilmenite is crushed on site and transported by railcar to the port terminal, then sent by ore carrier to the Critical Minerals and Metallurgical Complex.\n\nIt is 880 km by boat from Havre-Saint-Pierre to Sorel-Tracy.\n\nA city within a city"
