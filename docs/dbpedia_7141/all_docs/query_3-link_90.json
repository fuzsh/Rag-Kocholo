You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nThe sulfuric acid process uses titanium concentrate or acid-soluble titanium slag and sulfuric acid to react with sulfuric acid to perform an acidolysis reaction to obtain a titanium sulfate solution. After hydrolysis, metatitanic acid precipitate is obtained; then it is calcined in a rotary kiln to produce TiO2. The sulfuric acid process is mainly operated by the intermittent method, and the production equipment has high flexibility, which is convenient for start-up, shutdown and load adjustment. However, the process is complex and requires nearly two dozen process steps. Each process step must be strictly controlled in order to produce the best quality titanium dioxide products and meet the optimal performance of the pigment. The sulfuric acid method can produce both anatase and rutile products.\n\nThe chlorination process uses titanium-containing raw materials to react with chlorine gas to produce titanium tetrachloride, which is reacted with chlorinated high-titanium slag, artificial rutile, or natural rutile, which is purified by distillation and then gas-phase oxidized; after rapid cooling, TiO2 is obtained after gas-solid separation. Since the TiO2 adsorbs a certain amount of chlorine, it needs to be heated or steamed to remove it. The process is simple, but when chlorinating at 1000Â°C or higher, there are many chemical engineering problems that need to be solved, such as the high corrosion of chlorine, oxychloride, and titanium tetrachloride. In addition, the raw materials used are special and are more expensive than the sulfuric acid method. high. Chlorination production is continuous production. The operation of the production equipment is not very flexible, and the start-up, shutdown and production load are not easy to adjust. However, its continuous process production has a simple process, few process control points, and the product quality is easy to achieve optimal control. In addition, there is no sintering caused by the rotary kiln calcination process, and its TiO2 primary particles are easy to depolymerize. Therefore, people are accustomed to believe that the quality of chloride titanium dioxide products is superior in appearance."
