        "text": "Are you curious about what makes your favorite foods, cosmetics, and white paint vibrant? The answer may lie in the versatility of titanium dioxide. Although it may sound exotic, titanium dioxide is a common ingredient in various products ranging from cosmetics to building materials. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most common uses for titanium dioxide and focus on how it makes products more unique and compelling.\n\nWhat Is Titanium Dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide is a white, powdery solid used in various commercial and industrial applications. When titanium is exposed to oxygen, it forms titanium oxides in dust, sand, and many minerals. It is also produced commercially by oxidizing titanium metal in the air at temperatures above approximately 1650Â°C.\n\nTitanium dioxide is odorless, non-flammable, and is known for its bright coloring when added to paints, inks, and coatings. It is also very resistant to extreme temperatures and pressure, making it perfect for use in various automotive parts.\n\nTitanium Uses / Applications\n\nConcrete\n\nTitanium Dioxide (TiO2) is a common ingredient in concrete. Its presence in this material helps protect concrete from the elements and provides strength and durability.\n\nSome of the reasons why TiO2 is used in concrete include the following:\n\nIts ability to act as a pigment provides color to the concrete.\n\nIt makes concrete stronger by increasing its compressive strength. This makes the concrete capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and high pressure.\n\nAs a UV absorber, TiO2 absorbs UV radiation and prevents discoloration of the concrete due to sun exposure.\n\nFurthermore, TiO2 effectively prevents concrete staining caused by dirt or other materials and increases resistance to freeze-thaw cycles. Whether you are building a bridge or laying some sidewalks, you can trust that titanium dioxide will be an integral part of your project.\n\nGrease & Lubricants\n\nTitanium dioxide has several properties that make it suitable for grease production. It has extreme temperature stability. For instance, its durability in cold temperatures makes it ideal for cold climates.\n\nIn addition, it offers superior wear and corrosion protection and longer service life compared to other additives. It also offers superior oxidation resistance, which helps prevent the buildup of deposits on moving parts. TiO2 improves grease’s texture and consistency, making it easier to work with bearing or gearbox lubrication applications.\n\nTitanium dioxide is commonly used in auto-lubricant products such as greases, gear, and engine oil. It can also be found in industrial-grade lubricants such as hydraulic, turbine, and compressor oils.\n\nPlastic & Rubber\n\nAnother interesting use of titanium dioxide is in the production of plastic products. This compound helps stabilize the rubber or plastic material, making it more durable, heat resistant, and UV resistant. This makes it a great choice for outdoor products such as furniture, planters, or outdoor toys that need to handle sunlight exposure without breaking down quickly. In addition to the performance benefits, TiO2 reduces the carbon emissions produced while manufacturing these materials.\n\nTitanium dioxide can also be added to rubber when making tires or other rubber products that must be tough enough for various conditions. It helps improve wear resistance, elasticity, adhesion, flexibility, and abrasion resistance.\n\nCheck out our PVC, Plastics, Rubbers & Foam Raw Materials Guide\n\nPigments & Coatings\n\nTitanium dioxide is a durable and non-toxic pigment used in various applications, including plastics, rubber, and paper. It also creates brilliant white colors in paint, ink, paper, and other industrial coatings. It provides excellent opacity properties when combined with colored pigments, allowing it to be used in shades such as pastel colors.\n\nCheck out our Paints & Coatings Raw Materials Guide\n\nFood Industry\n\nAs a food additive, titanium dioxide is primarily used for its whitening and brightening effect. It’s used in various foods and beverages, such as coffee creamers, milk, snacks, chocolate, sauces, salad dressing, and infant formulas.\n\nAdditionally, titanium dioxide can be found in supplements like multivitamins and calcium tablets to make them appear more appealing. TiO2 is also often utilized to produce a gum-like texture in gummy products like candy and ice cream. Thanks to its non-toxic properties, it is considered safe for human consumption and has been approved by the FDA.\n\nSunscreen Formulations\n\nAt its core, titanium dioxide absorbs ultraviolet light and reflects visible light, making it a fantastic UV filter. Sunscreen is made with a combination of both chemical and physical active ingredients. Titanium Dioxide is among the physical ingredients.\n\nGenerally, the components of TiO2 are usually attached to materials such as polymers or silicone, which helps them adhere better to the surface and provide an even coating across the sunscreen without any caking or clumping.\n\nGet Quality Titanium Dioxide from Bisley International\n\nWith so many applications, it’s no wonder why titanium dioxide has become an essential component of so many industries. From the production of everyday items to the elimination of odor and the preservation of plastic and rubber, it is no doubt that titanium dioxide will continue to play a significant role in the global economy for years to come.\n\nAt Bisley International, we will supply you with quality titanium dioxide in bulk for use in any industrial application.
