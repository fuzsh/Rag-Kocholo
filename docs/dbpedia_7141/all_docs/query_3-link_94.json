        "text": "The primary application is in paint, where TiO2 powder is used as the base pigment for construction and automotive applications paints. TiO2 also is used as a filler in plastics, coatings, cosmetics, toothpaste and sunscreen.\n\nRain Carbon supplies high-carbon calcined petroleum coke (CPC) produced at our calciners, which is essential as a reducing agent in the manufacture of titanium dioxide via the chloride process.\n\nTitanium containing ore such as rutile and ilmenite is mixed with CPC and fed to a high temperature fluid-bed reaction vessel known as a chlorinator, which heats the materials to 1,000˚C (18,320˚F). Chlorine gas is added, and the high-purity carbon present in CPC reduces the TiO2, which then reacts with the chlorine gas to produce TiCl4 via the reaction below:\n\nTiO2 + C + 2Cl2 → TiCl4 + CO2\n\nThe TiCl4 is recovered and then distilled to generate purified TiCl4. This is then reoxidized to pure TiO2 using oxygen gas. The chlorine gas generated in the reoxidation step is recovered and re-used in the process. The fine-particle size TiO2 product typically undergoes milling, and small amounts of proprietary, surface modifying chemicals are added to produce a variety of product grades for use in a wide range of coating and filler applications."
