        "text": "Our high-purity titanium oxide is produced by the vapor-phase oxidation method. In the method, titanium tetrachloride, a chloride of titanium, is vaporized and then oxidized with oxygen to produce titanium oxide. Our advantage is that we can produce high-purity titanium oxide at the 3N or 4N level by using high-purity titanium tetrachloride refined for titanium metal refining as a raw material.\n\nOur high-purity titanium oxide is processed into barium titanate at our customers’ sites and used in various electronic parts. Furthermore, our high-purity titanium oxide is used as additives for optical lenses, pharmaceutical products, foods, etc., given its high purity. Our high-purity titanium oxide production process is the only one that has obtained a pharmaceutical manufacturing license and a food additive manufacturing license among Japanese titanium oxide manufacturers.\n\nElectronic parts\n\nMulti-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC)\n\nPTC thermistor\n\nFilter\n\nPiezoelectric components\n\nOther\n\nOptical\n\n(Additives for lenses with a high refractive index)\n\nFor pharmaceuticals and foods\n\n(For coating agents and color adjustment)"
