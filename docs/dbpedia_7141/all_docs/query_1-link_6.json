        "text": "By Sinead Kaufman, Chief Executive, Minerals, Rio Tinto\n\nAdapted from a presentation at the 26th World Mining Congress in Queensland, Australia, June 2023\n\nIn the last few years as decarbonisation, critical minerals and increasingly complex geopolitics have put the importance of mining back on the global agenda, it is clear that some elements of what was true for mining last century still hold – a good quality resource and great people to develop and mine it.\n\nNow though, there is an even more important factor for success – a very strong ability to partner with communities, stakeholders and governments as well as other industry bodies.\n\nEqually how mines were built 150 years ago, when Rio Tinto was first established, is not how mines of the future will operate. Our ability to mine sustainably and responsibly are key to success.\n\nThe world has changed.\n\nAnd Rio Tinto is changing with it.\n\nResetting the dial\n\nI appreciate many are sceptical about the ability of the mining industry to deliver on the climate front, beyond issuing ambitious and long-dated targets. That is why we are sharing a clear pathway to material reductions by the end of the decade.\n\nSo, what exactly are we doing at Rio Tinto?\n\nFirstly, we are accelerating our own decarbonisation, switching to #renewable power, electrifying processing and, where possible, running electric mobile fleets. An example in Madagascar is the construction of a wind and solar plant in the remote southeast to power both our mineral sands operations and the local town.\n\nSecondly, we are increasing our investment in R&D to speed up the development of technologies that will enable our customers to decarbonise. Technology and partnerships have a key role to play.\n\nAnd finally, we are prioritising growth capital in commodities that are essential for the drive to net zero, such as the acquisition of the Rincon lithium project last year in Argentina, and the ongoing exploration activities for critical minerals such as copper.\n\nThe Scandium story\n\nScandium, another critical mineral we’re exploring, is emblematic of Rio Tinto’s transformation in terms of what we mine and also how we mine.\n\nMost of the current world’s supply is used in solid oxide fuel cells to improve performance. It also has great potential as an alloy with our low-carbon #aluminium – making the aluminium much stronger, more flexible and heat resistant – and is used in aerospace, defence and sporting equipment.\n\nIn Quebec, we have a commercial-scale plant that is producing high quality scandium oxide. It involves an innovative circular process developed by our team to extract the scandium oxide from the waste streams of our existing titanium dioxide production, without the need for any additional mining.\n\nIn two years we have gone from testing a process to extract this critical material in a lab, to being able to supply about 20% of the global scandium market.\n\nOur recent acquisition of the Platina Scandium Project in Australia, when operational, will more than double our annual scandium production.\n\nOur focus is on the technology, using existing infrastructure and waste streams to build a critical mass of product. As a result, we have diversity of supply of scandium from two jurisdictions, each with strong #ESG credentials.\n\nWealth from waste\n\nAs part of the transformation, the mining industry needs to shift how it mines from a linear model to a circular model that explores opportunities for waste to be processed to create by-products that could be used by the mining industry or other industries.\n\nOver the past few years, Rio Tinto scientists and engineers have been hard at work finding way to take traditional mining waste turn it into a useful product. For example, 85% of waste material created by our aluminium operations in Canada, some 400,000 tonnes, is used to make new products.\n\nIn addition to producing scandium from titanium dioxide waste streams, we have commenced the co-production of tellurium at our Kennecott copper mine in the US. Tellurium is usually found in small, sparse rock deposits, making it difficult to mine at scale but at Kennecott we have discovered a method to extract it from waste generated from the copper refining process.\n\nApproximately 20 tonnes of #tellurium will be produced each year at Kennecott. This is around 3% of global supply and a new North American supply chain.\n\nAs a result, we have become one of only two producers of the critical minerals used in solar panels and other critical equipment in the US. We are now working on scaling up our production of tellurium. It is estimated that Kennecott will become the sixth-largest producer of tellurium globally.\n\nWaste is such a critical issue for us and this not only means our tailings but extends to mine closures and products such as scrap metal and demolition waste. In 2021, Rio Tinto joined forces with RESOLVE to launch Regeneration , a start-up that will use the re-mining and processing of waste from legacy mine sites to support rehabilitation activities and restore natural environments.\n\nFull value mining\n\nHow we mine at Rio Tinto is being transformed by the development of a suite of niche specialty products, boosting project economics and reducing our environmental footprint.\n\nBlueberries is a word you wouldn’t expect to hear in relation to mining but this superfood is an informative example of using innovation to reduce waste and extract as much value as possible from the material we mine and process.\n\nIn Canada, we’re working with blueberry growers to make a safe and effective fertiliser. The fertiliser is made from the anhydrite mineral in the waste from our aluminium operations. Anhydrite is a mineral normally found in rocks but we produce around 85,000 tonnes a year in Canada, as a by-product of our aluminium production process.\n\nResearch shows this mineral helps blueberry plants grow more fruit. Because it’s local, it is cheaper than many other fertilisers, and it has the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s seal of approval.\n\nWe are also looking for ways to improve the way anhydrite is used in agriculture. We are funding research by two universities in Quebec, in partnership with the governments of Canada and Quebec, to provide even better data to farmers to improve their blueberry yield. The team in Canada has created other uses for anhydrite too, such as in construction, as an alternative to gypsum.\n\nBlueberries are just one example of the transformative effect of full value mining.\n\nThe Power of Partnerships\n\nTo support our ongoing technology advancement we have research centres in both Australia and Canada that have been operating for more than 50 years. Employing around 2,000 people, the primary purpose of these R&D centres is to partner with academia and other scientific institutions in developing technologies to support the energy transition at our sites around the world.\n\nWorking with others is the key to solving some of the biggest challenges facing our industry as we travel the road to net zero. Our R&D partnerships are multi-faceted and vary from start-ups, to governments, NGOs through to academia, suppliers and customers.\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, we are working with battery company Graphene Manufacturing Group Ltd , recently signing a $6 million joint development agreement to develop and use its next-generation graphene aluminium-ion batteries in mining trucks and for energy storage at sites.\n\nAt our Technology Development Centre in Bundoora in Victoria, Australia, we pioneered the technique to recover battery grade lithium from existing mine waste at our boron operations in California.\n\nI have just spent some time at Bundoora where we are constructing an end- to- end #battery laboratory to improve our understanding of battery production, manufacturing and chemistry. At this lab we will build our own batteries, allowing us to test how our minerals and other products will perform in real-world applications, such as in an electric vehicle batteries.\n\nDemand for battery minerals is expected to grow very quickly as governments and businesses take action to meet the goals of the Glasgow Climate Pact under the Paris Agreement.\n\nLong-term electric vehicle and lithium demand forecasts continue to be revised upwards. The lithium market is expected to grow five-fold between now and 2030, with a significant supply-demand deficit expected from the second half of this decade. This means more battery materials are needed.\n\nWe’re planning our battery laboratory to be operational by November, deepening our skills and expertise and ultimately enhancing our customer proposition. This is exciting work. It is market creating and is a critical support for our Battery Materials business, established in 2021 as part of our strategy to to prioritise growth capital in commodities essential for the drive to net zero, such as our acquisition of the Rincon Lithium project in Argentina.\n\nThere are so many more examples, but the message is the same in all of them – we need to partner with others to find the breakthrough technologies we need to move forward.\n\nThe Importance of our People\n\nRio Tinto is proudly 150 years old. We are very much focussed on the future because what made us successful in the past is not going to do so in the future. And none more so than in the area of people and culture where our priority is to build a safer, more respectful and inclusive workplace.\n\nOne of the great aspects of my job is to meet the many and varied people working in our Minerals portfolio around the world. We have extraordinary people who are, for example,\n\nextracting diamonds from a frozen lake in the sub-Arctic;\n\nworking on direct lithium extraction technology, 3800 metres above sea level in Argentina;\n\ndeveloping new markets for critical minerals; and\n\ncollaborating across laboratories, pilot plants and production facilities around the world, leveraging our existing asset base, processing infrastructure and technical knowledge.\n\nThese are talented people from all walks of life.\n\nAnd we need more of them if we are to meet the challenge of producing the next generation of minerals, against a backdrop of climate change and the ever-increasing demands on the fragile planet that we all share.\n\nWe need to be innovative and not rely on what made us to successful last century to carry us through the next.\n\nWe need to keep exploring for new technologies to support the energy transition.\n\nWe need to meet societal expectations and partner with others to mine sustainably.\n\nWe need to leverage our people and skills to solve these problems for the future.\n\nRead more on how we partner to drive innovation: https://www.riotinto.com/en/about/innovation/partnering-to-innovate"
