        "text": "White pigments for all purposes\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely used white pigment in the world. It’s the mainstay of our range and we’re proud to be a front-runner in this highly specialized sector.\n\nTitanium is the 9th most abundant element in the world and titanium dioxide is the oxide of the metal, which occurs naturally in two main forms: rutile and anatase. It is then processed to remove any impurities, creating an incredibly useful, multi-purpose, white pigment.\n\nOdorless and absorbent, TiO2 has a high refractive index – meaning it has excellent light scattering capabilities. Ideal for inclusion in a variety of consumer and industrial products, TiO2 is particularly well suited to applications that need to deliver high levels of opacity, brightness and ultraviolet (UV) protection.\n\nA leading global manufacturer\n\nWe are a leading global manufacturer of TiO2 and offer a broad spectrum of both anatase and rutile pigments. Marketed under a range of trusted brand names which include TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, DELTIO® and ALTIRIS®, our innovative TiO2 pigments are used day-to-day in thousands of everyday items.\n\nThey are popular in the formulation of paints, coatings, inks, ceramics, paper and plastic production. They are used to reduce the transparency of synthetic fibers such as polyester and polyamide. We even have TiO2 grades with disinfecting, cleansing and neutralizing properties, which are utilized in filters in air conditioning units, power stations and cars.\n\nImportantly, we also have a range of TiO2 grades designed for the formulation of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and personal care products such as sun cream. These specialist pigments conform to stringent global purity and safety levels, and are produced in line with good manufacturing standards (GMP) and international food and drink regulations."
