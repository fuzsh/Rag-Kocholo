        "text": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2); also referred to as titanium (IV) oxide, is a high-purity fine white powder that is readily dispersible and has been obtained and purified from rutile and has undergone inorganic surface treatment. As a pigment, titanium dioxide has an extensive range of applications, including in industrial and consumer products. It is known for its excellent durability, UV resistance, brightness, whiteness, tint strength and gloss.\n\nTitanium dioxide is widely used in paints, adhesives, plastics, printing inks, coatings, paper, rubber, ceramics, and coated fabrics and textiles. Titanium can also be added to roofing materials, automotive products, water treatment agents, food colourants, toothpaste, soap, and cosmetic products.\n\nGenerally, titanium dioxide is generated in two major forms: pigment-grade titanium dioxide and ultrafine-grade (Nano titanium dioxide). The pigmentary grade harnesses the compoundâ€™s great light-scattering features in products that require white opacity and extreme brightness. Subsequently, the ultra-grade is used when various properties like optimal ultraviolet light absorption and transparency are needed, such as in cosmetics and sunscreen products.\n\nPigment-grade Titanium Dioxide\n\nAs a white pigment, titanium dioxide is used in items and surfaces that are white and pastel to maximise brightness and opacity. Its applications include:\n\nPaints and coatings provide durability and opacity while helping extend the life of the paint and protect painted surfaces.\n\nPlastics and adhesives help reduce the brittleness, cracking, and fading that occurs when plastic-made products are exposed to light.\n\nFood products: titanium dioxide in food offers opacity, ultraviolet, and visible properties to help protect food and drinks from premature degradation. It is also used as a food additive in various applications such as food colourant and cake decorations.\n\nNanoscale Titanium Dioxide\n\nNano titanium dioxide is used in different applications such as:\n\nCatalysts: titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used to support catalyst applications. They are commonly used in power stations to extract nitrous oxides and in the automotive industry to remove hazardous exhaust gas emissions.\n\nSunscreen: Titanium dioxide is transparent and acts as a UV light absorber. Since the particle size of nano titanium dioxide is so tiny, it does not reflect visible UV light.\n\nAluminium hydroxide (alumina trihydrate, ATH or Alufy) is a cost-effective white pigment and functional filler that can substitute titanium dioxide particles used in paints, coatings, plastics, and paper. Depending on the material composition, aluminium hydroxide can replace up to 30% of the titanium dioxide with minimal effect on whiteness. Bisley supplies Alufy in a wide range of particle sizes, meaning it can be used for many different applications.\n\nAluminium hydroxide provides flame retardancy, and smoke suppression and has lower specific gravity than titanium dioxide, therefore a lower quantity of pigment extender is required. Sensowhite is a high-purity, surface-treated jet-milled barium sulphate used as a cost-effective, easily dispersible partial substitute to titanium dioxide used in paints, coatings, plastics and other applications.\n\nContact Bisley & Company\n\nBisley supplies Sensowhite; a high purity and easily dispersible jet-milled barium sulphate that is a cost-effective titanium dioxide extender. Our Sensowhite is ideal for primers, plastics, gel coats, and powder coatings and can be used in automotive linings and chemical resistance. Its unique surface coating ensures low gloss degradation and a high packing density. Sensowhite is available in two particle size ranges, increasing the applications it can be used for.
