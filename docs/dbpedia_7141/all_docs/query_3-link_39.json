The Titanium Dioxide Stewardship Council (TDSC) was formed to promote the safe use of TiO2 through research, product stewardship, advocacy, and outreach efforts within the framework of responsible chemical management.",

        "text": "Because of TiO2â€™s unique properties, there are many safe and beneficial characteristics of TiO2:\n\nThe Color White: As a pigment, TiO2 has excellent light-scattering properties and is used in a variety of applications that require white opacity and brightness.\n\nUV Protection: It absorbs UV light. When TiO2 pigment is incorporated in a polymer, it can protect against fading, cracking, and weakening. Surface treating of the TiO2 can further improve this property.\n\nLongevity: When used in a paint or coating system, TiO2 helps maintain the longevity of the paint and the continued protection of the painted surface.\n\nEnergy Savings: The brightness TiO2 can confer to light colored paints can, when compared to darker colors, reduce the energy needed to light the interiors of buildings. In exterior applications the coolness conferred by TiO2 colored surfaces can lead to considerable energy savings in warm and tropical area by light reflectance that can reduce the need for air-conditioning.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assessed the safety of titanium dioxide pigment as a color additive in food, drug and cosmetic applications. FDA had issued guidance clarifying the safe use of titanium dioxide pigment as a food colorant, and has stated that titanium dioxide may be safely used in cosmetics, including cosmetics intended for use around the eye. FDA also regulates the safety and effectiveness of sunscreens and their ingredients, including nanoscale titanium dioxide."
