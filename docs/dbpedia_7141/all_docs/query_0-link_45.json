        "text": "Introduction\n\nOre extraction and processing remain highly relevant today, pivotal in the global economy and technological advancement. As the backbone of the manufacturing and construction industries, titanium mining techniques and subsequent processing are crucial for producing a wide array of essential materials, from steel and aluminum to rare earth elements used in high-tech devices.\n\nThis sector drives economic growth and faces evolving challenges such as sustainable and environmentally responsible practices, technological innovations for efficient extraction, and adapting to fluctuating market demands. Understanding what type of mining is used to extract titanium, the current state, and the prospects of ore extraction and processing is vital to comprehend its impact on the economy and the environment.\n\nModern Methods of Titanium Mining\n\nTitanium deposits are divided into three main types:\n\nplacer mines — 69 % of the world’s titanium resources;\n\nmagmatic deposits (primary) —19,5 %;\n\nlateritic deposits — 11,5 %.\n\nIlmenite deposits take 82% of the world’s titanium deposits, 12% are anatase, and 6% are rutile deposits.\n\nThe content of titanium dioxide in the above ores is as follows:\n\nrutile – 93-96 %;\n\nilmenite – 44-70 %;\n\nleucoxene – 90 %.\n\nMethods of mining titanium can also be divided into three main types:\n\nPlacer Mining\n\nMore than half of titanium is extracted from placer mines. This process does not require crushing and grinding; it is carried out by dredgers, excavators, and other mechanical means;\n\nOpen-pit titanium mining method\n\nIt is used when ores are deposited in veins at shallow depths. In this case, depending on the hardness of the overburdened rocks, it is necessary to extract them using excavating machinery or through preliminary drilling and blasting operations. After that, the extracted ore is subjected to crushing and grinding for further dressing.\n\nUnderground shaft method\n\nThis method is applied when developing primary deposits. This is the most expensive and time-consuming method, requiring the construction of a whole complex of underground structures, the costs of which are recovered through obtaining an entire set of minerals that are part of titanium-containing ores.\n\nAfter mining and preliminary processing, titanium ores are subjected to dressing, forming concentrates with a high TiO2 content.\n\nEfficient Ways of Titanium Ore Processing\n\nProcessing titanium ore includes several stages for extracting titanium and turning it into a final product.\n\nOur company has developed 2 main concepts for dressing titanium ores, the main feature of which is the method of obtaining ilmenite concentrate:\n\n1. Scheme of magnetic, flotation, and electrostatic separation:\n\n2. Scheme of magnetic and flotation separation:\n\nThe feed ore is ground in a ball mill; the mill discharge is sent to a hydrocyclone; the hydrocyclone sands, with the agreed by technology process oversize, are sent to the Ball mill back. The hydrocyclone overflow is sent to the first stage of magnetic separation. The magnetic fraction is sent to the second stage ball mill. The mill discharge is sent to a hydrocyclone; the hydrocyclone sands (class oversize) are returned to the second mill stage, and the hydrocyclone discharge is sent to the magnetic separation II stage. The concentrate of the magnetic separation is the titanium-magnetite concentrate. The tailing of the magnetic separation from the first and second stages is combined and sent to the further process regarding receiving an Ilmenite concentrate.\n\nThe magnetic separation tailing in the weak field is sent to the receiving of apatite Concentrate.\n\nThe developed PFD will perform the electrostatic scheme and floatation and will have the following apparatus charts: high gradient magnetic separator, contact, basic floatation, and recleaning of the concentrate and thickening process.\n\nBoth methods have advantages and disadvantages; however, the final choice of processing titanium iron ore) is made after comparing the entire processing cycle (before obtaining the pigment).\n\nTitanium Ore Plant Modernization\n\nOur company uses state-of-the-art gravitation and electrostatic hardware solutions to modernize the existing titanium processing plants, improving the efficiency and selectivity of the extracted ilmenite.\n\nWe have also developed know-how for using a flotation separation method, which maximally extracts fine inclusions of ilmenite that cannot be separated by electrical separation.\n\nThe following important modernization aspect is automation and digitalization of the entire process chain, which significantly increases the reliability of ongoing processes and reduces the cost of the final product.\n\nCheck out our mining and processing plants’ engineering services.\n\nWondering if Modernization makes Sense? Our Experts Are Ready to Assist You With Calculations and Mitigate the Risks.\n\nThe Best Titanium Ore Processing Plants\n\nThe production of titanium raw materials is consolidated around three leading producers, Rio Tinto,” “Exxaro” and “Iluka Resource LTD,” which account for two-thirds of raw material production, depending on market conditions and production parameters.\n\nThe Australian company “Iluka Resource LTD” is the world’s largest manufacturer and processor of titanium-zirconium raw materials. The company is entitled to royalties from BHP Billiton’s iron ore mining in Western Australia. Besides Australia, the company’s enterprises are in North America and Sri Lanka.\n\n“Rio Tinto” is the world’s second-largest mining company, operating in 20 countries and extracting iron ore, copper, coal, uranium, aluminum, diamonds, and gold. The company’s structural division “Rio Tinto & Titanium” (“RTIT”), produces titanium dioxide as well. Ilmenite is mined at primary deposits (“Lac Tio,” Quebec, Canada), placer deposits in South Africa (“Richards Bay Minerals”), and Madagascar (“QIT Madagascar Minerals”). The company also has a metallurgical complex in Sorel-Tracy (Canada). Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is processed in Canada.\n\n“Exxaro Resources” (“Tronox Mineral Sands”) is one of the largest diversified resource groups in South Africa (coal, iron ore, and titanium-zirconium sands). The group’s commercial interests span South Africa, the Republic of Congo, and Australia. “Exxaro Resources” owns titanium-zirconium placers in KwaZulu-Natal (“KZN Sands”) and “Namakwa Sands” (26% each). “KZN Sands” owns the Hillendale mine with an average heavy minerals content of 6.9%, including 60% ilmenite, 3.6% rutile, 8% zircon, and 1.6% leucoxene. The open pit and processing plant are located in Brand-SE-Baai. The processed raw materials are transported to a separation factory to obtain zircon, rutile, and ilmenite concentrates.\n\nProducts That Can Be Produced From Processed Titanium Ore\n\nOnly 5% of all extracted titanium ore is sent for direct production of metallic titanium after its dressing and preparation, the central part of which is used in aviation, rocket technology, and marine shipbuilding. Ferrotitanium is applied as an alloy addition for high-quality steels and a deoxidizing agent. Technical titanium is used to manufacture containers, chemical reactors, pipelines, fittings, pumps, valves, and other products in aggressive environments.\n\nThe remaining 95% of the mined ore is used for the production of pigment dioxide and, according to experts, in recent years, the share of pigment titanium dioxide in the total consumption of inorganic pigments is 65-70%, and in the consumption of white pigments over 90%. Titanium dioxide is widely used as a white pigment in pulp and paper, paint and varnish industries, the production of synthetic fibers, rubber, plastics, heat-resistant and optical glass, white enamel, ceramic dielectrics, etc. Check out our guide on the TiO2 manufacturing process.\n\nWhat Will You Win by Cooperating with M HEAVY TECHNOLOGY?\n\nBy choosing our company, you select a team of professionals who will help you solve all issues, from the stage of technology selection to engineering, supply, and equipment commissioning, and bringing the enterprise to guarantee performance.
