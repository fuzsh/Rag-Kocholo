        "text": "You might not notice it when you look around, but titanium dioxide (TiO2) is everywhere. From the paint on your walls to the sunscreen you apply before heading out, TiO2 is an essential mineral that plays a significant role in various industries.\n\nWhat is Titanium Dioxide?\n\nFirst isolated and named by William Gregor in 1791, titanium dioxide is a naturally occurring, chemically stable, non-toxic, and odourless mineral. Its outstanding light-scattering properties make it valuable in multiple applications, such as cosmetics, sunscreens, paints, coatings, plastics, and even food products.\n\nBut that’s not all. TiO2 is also a photocatalyst in environmental applications, such as air and water purification, and is a critical component in electronics and solar cells. Its versatility and diversity make it one of the world’s most widely produced and consumed materials.\n\nHow is Titanium Dioxide Used?\n\nTiO2 is a versatile mineral that is widely employed across a multitude of industries. It serves as a light-scattering agent in surface coatings and road markings, contributing to a brilliant and reflective finish. In the world of plastics, paper, inks, and rubber, TiO2 functions as a whitening agent, providing increased opacity and visual appeal to these materials.\n\nMoreover, TiO2 is an indispensable ingredient in the production of cosmetic products and sunscreens, owing to its remarkable capacity to protect against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Additionally, in the food industry, it is used to brighten and whiten various products.\n\nDespite its multifaceted applications, the most significant demand for TiO2 comes from the surface coatings and plastics industries, which account for nearly 80% of its global consumption.\n\nWhat Influences the Pricing of Titanium Dioxide?\n\nThe price of titanium dioxide is subject to various factors, including shipping costs, raw materials such as ilmenite, and the production process. Depending on production location, i.e., China is the world’s second largest TiO2 producer and has a higher percentage of manufacturing via the sulphate process compared to the USA, where chloride TiO2 production is more dominant. There are two primary methods for producing titanium dioxide: sulphate and chloride. Sulphate production is more prevalent, while chloride production is generally considered higher quality, albeit at a higher cost.\n\nThese factors all play a role in determining the final price of titanium dioxide, a vital mineral used in a wide range of applications.\n\nHow Can Redox Help?\n\nWe offer Titanium Dioxide in various packaging sizes, ranging from 25kg bags to 500kg and 1000kg bulker bags. The product is available in multiple grades, including Anatase and Rutile, produced through sulphate and chloride production processes. Customers can choose from various options to suit their specific needs."
