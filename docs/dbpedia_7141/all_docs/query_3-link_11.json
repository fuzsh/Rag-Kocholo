        "text": "Titanium dioxide is one of the most essential inorganic materials modern industry consumes. It is widely used in the contemporary world and is the primary commercial product of the titanium production sector. How is titanium dioxide manufactured and utilized? We will discuss it in this article along with other relevant aspects.\n\nPure titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a colorless, crystalline solid substance. When heated, its crystals turn yellow, and upon cooling, they regain their colorless appearance.\n\nModifications of titanium dioxide include:\n\nRutile (cubic syngony, 85-90% of global production);\n\nBrookite (orthorhombic syngony);\n\nAnatase (tetragonal syngony, 10-15%);\n\nRhombic IV and hexagonal V modifications.\n\nTitanium dioxide is produced in two forms: rutile (R-type) and anatase (A-type).\n\nRutile titanium dioxide\n\nIt scatters light approximately 30% better than anatase, and it has better hiding power (the ability of titanium dioxide to cover the color of the painted surface).\n\nRutile titanium dioxide is preferred in paints, coatings, plastics, and cosmetics production.\n\nAnatase form\n\nIt is less resistant to atmospheric conditions than rutile and provides less protection against UV radiation. Anatase pigments find their application in producing paper, rubber, and soap.\n\nUse of titanium depending on its properties\n\nTraditionally, the vast majority (about 95%) of all produced titanium dioxide is used in making paints and coatings.\n\nThe leading role of titanium dioxide among white pigments is predetermined by its high level of quality. This product is characterized by its ability to disperse, as well as its thermal and chemical resistance, whitening capability, resistance to atmospheric conditions, high refractive index, and more. These properties depend on the size of raw material particles and are significantly enhanced by their nanostructuring.\n\nIn the paint and coatings industry, the primary function of TiO2 is to impart paints with a white color and brightness and to enhance hiding power. It also protects against harmful ultraviolet rays and prevents film aging and yellowing of painted surfaces.\n\nTitanium dioxide is a stable substance (the most stable one among all known white pigments). It is non-volatile and insoluble in acids, alkalis, and solutions under normal conditions.\n\nTitanium dioxide is amphoteric, meaning it has basic and acidic properties (although it reacts with concentrated acids). It demonstrates high chemical stability towards various compounds, including those that may be toxic and present in the environment. Due to its inertness, titanium dioxide is non-toxic and generally considered a very safe substance. It can come into contact with packaged products and even be used as a food coloring in certain concentrations.\n\nIt may even enter the body as an aerosol through inhalation or ingestion. It is non-flammable.\n\nSpecific properties of titanium dioxide make it indispensable in various industries, contributing to the rapid growth of the global titanium dioxide market.\n\nThere is a high demand for titanium dioxide in the global market, which is expected to continue growing. Additionally, there is a constant increase in the worldwide need for inorganic pigments. According to experts’ estimates, in recent years, titanium dioxide pigment accounted for 65-70% of the total consumption of inorganic pigments and over 90% of the consumption of white pigments.\n\nIn 2021, the titanium dioxide market was estimated to be more than 6 million tons, and it is projected that from 2022 to 2027, the market will demonstrate an average annual growth rate of over 6%. In the short term, the rapidly growing demand from the paint and coatings industry will be the primary driver of titanium dioxide market growth.\n\nTitanium dioxide pigment is produced in 15 countries, with 33% of production capacity located in the USA. Additionally, almost 40% of production is in China, Ukraine, Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Saudi Arabia, Japan, France, Australia, and other countries.\n\nThe global titanium dioxide production distribution is as follows:\n\nChina has the largest titanium dioxide production capacity, producing approximately 3 million tons annually.\n\nThe largest world producers are the following companies: DuPont Titanium Technologies (USA), National Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd. Cristal (Saudi Arabia), Huntsman Pigments (USA), Tronox, Inc. (USA), Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (USA), Sachtleben Chemie GmbH (Germany; Rockwood Holdings own 100% of the shares), Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. (Japan).\n\nRaw materials for production of titanium dioxide pigment\n\nA crucial aspect of the titanium dioxide manufacturing process is the supply of high-quality titanium ore. Despite titanium being one of Earth’s most abundant chemical elements, it occurs in deficient natural concentrations. Therefore, to establish an adequate supply of titanium ore capable of meeting the economic demands of TiO2 production, it is essential to implement rational methods of extraction and refinement of this mineral.\n\nRead more about titanium ore mining and processing.\n\nIlmenite concentrate (FeTiO3)\n\nThe primary raw material in the titanium dioxide production process is ilmenite concentrate (FeTiO3), produced by mining and processing. Ilmenite is an ore that, from a chemical perspective, is a mixture of oxides, the majority of which are titanium and iron oxides.\n\nTitanium slag\n\nThe second most significant raw material for the tio2 manufacturing process is titanium slag, containing 75-90% TiO2 and 5-7% FeO.\n\nRead also our article on titanium slag production process.\n\nOther raw material sources\n\nNatural and synthetic rutile, as well as ore fines, have secondary importance.\n\nDue to its very high whiteness and fine particle size, titanium dioxide has found wide application as a white pigment in the paint and coatings industry. Among its advantages are non-toxicity, high optical properties (ability to scatter light), availability, chemical inertness, resistance to atmospheric conditions, and more. Gone are the days when paints were made using zinc or lead-containing white pigments.\n\nPaint and coatings industry\n\nIt is the primary industry using titanium dioxide pigment. But not the last one.\n\nTiO2 is widely used as a white pigment in the pulp and paper industry for producing synthetic fibers, rubber products, plastics, heat-resistant and optical glass, ceramic dielectrics, etc.\n\nProduction of fiber optic products\n\nTitanium dioxide, with a chemical purity of 99.9998%, is used in producing optical fiber products, medical equipment, and the radio-electronic industry. In manufacturing ultra-pure glasses, titanium dioxide serves as a purity reference.\n\nSynthetic fibers and textiles\n\nFor matting twisted fibre.\n\nCosmetics\n\nFor protection against ultraviolet radiation in sunblock creams, for higher whitening effect of toothpastes, soaps, etc.\n\nFood industry\n\nFor higher whitening effect in products, for protection of product package color (plastics) against ultraviolet radiation.\n\nPharmaceutical industry\n\nFor higher whitening effect in pharma products.\n\nPrinting paint\n\nTo increase weather resistance of coatings.\n\nCatalyst\n\nPhotocatalyst and inert ceramic base material for active components.\n\nNanotechnology\n\nTitanium dioxide nanopowders are used for air purification in cities, in producing nanofiber paper based on TiO2, in hydrogen energy, etc.\n\nManufacture of rubber products\n\nProduction of refractories\n\nCoating of welding electrodes and coatings of casting molds.\n\nIn global practice, high-dispersion titanium dioxide pigment is produced by the sulfate (sulfuric acid) and chloride methods.\n\nThe sulfate method is based on the decomposition of ilmenite concentrates containing 45-56% TiO2 or titanium slags with a content of 75-80% TiO2, with subsequent conversion of titanium sulfates into dioxide.\n\nThe chloride method involves the chlorination of natural rutile concentrates, synthetic rutile, or titanium slags with a TiO2 content of 85% and higher, as well as special slags that have undergone additional processing and contain over 92% TiO2.\n\nConsidering specific features of both processes of the TiO2 production process, the primary criterion for choosing between the sulfate and chloride methods is the possibility of providing raw materials of the appropriate quality and environmental-related issues.\n\nBoth methods make it possible to obtain high-quality products with identical properties.\n\nThe approximate distribution of production technologies among manufacturers worldwide is 45% by the sulfate method and 55% by the chloride method.\n\nThe main stages of the TiO2 process by the sulfate and chloride methods are presented in the table.\n\nSulfate (sulfuric acid) method of TiO2 production\n\nThe sulfate method was applied in industry in 1931 to produce the anatase form of titanium dioxide and later, in 1941, for production of the rutile form. In this method, the initial raw material – ilmenite concentrate or titanium slag – is dissolved in sulfuric acid, resulting in titanium, iron, and other metal sulfate solutions. Then, basic TiO2 with the necessary particle size is formed after a series of technological transformations, including chemical reduction, purification, precipitation, washing, and calcination. The crystal structure (anatase or rutile form) is controlled during nucleation and calcination.\n\nThe equation describes the sulfate method of the titanium dioxide process:\n\nFeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 → TiOSO4 + FeSO4 + 2H2O TiOSO4 + H2O → TiO2 + H2SO4.\n\nThe process diagram of TiO2 production using the sulfate method (with ilmenite as a raw material)\n\nThe process diagram of titanium dioxide production using the sulfate method (with titanium slag as a raw material).\n\nChloride method of TiO2 production\n\nThe chloride method was invented in 1950 to produce the rutile form of TiO2.\n\nThe chloride method converts rutile (natural or synthetic) or titanium slag into titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) through chlorination in the presence of petroleum coke. Any resulting impurities of other metal chlorides are subsequently removed. The following equation describes the chloride method for obtaining TiO2:\n\n2FeTiO3 + 7CI2 + ЗС → 2TiCI4 + 2FeCI3 + 3CO2TiCI4 + O2 → TiO2 + 2CI2.\n\nThe most crucial operation in TiO2 production by the chloride method is the combustion of titanium tetrachloride. It is carried out at temperatures between 900-1000°C with burners of a particular design.\n\nThe titanium tetrachloride combustion reaction is as follows:\n\nTiCl4 + O2= TiO2 + 2С12.\n\nThe released chlorine can be returned to the production process to obtain titanium tetrachloride.\n\nThree main methods for obtaining titanium dioxide from its titanium tetrachloride:\n\nHydrolysis of aqueous solutions of titanium tetrachloride (followed by heat treatment of the sediment);\n\nVapor-phase hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride (is based on the interaction of titanium tetrachloride vapors with water vapors). The process is typically carried out at temperatures of 900-1000°C;\n\nHeat treatment of tetrachloride (combustion in a stream of oxygen).\n\nTitanium pigments obtained by combustion of titanium tetrachloride may contain up to 0.6% adsorbed chlorine. The aqueous suspension of such a product has a pH of less than 7 and is unsuitable for producing paints. Desorption of chlorine from the pigment can be achieved by heating it at temperatures 300-900 °C. The chlorine concentration is reduced to 0.1% in this process. Such a product is suitable for manufacturing paints and enamels but requires surface treatment with silicon and aluminum compounds to obtain higher-quality pigments.\n\nThe chloride method is selective and demanding in terms of raw materials. Due to the use of chlorine and high temperatures, it requires corrosion-resistant equipment.\n\nComparative characteristics of two methods of titanium dioxide production\n\nIn both technological processes – sulfate and chloride – the intermediate products are accumulations of TiO2 crystals of pigment size, which need to be separated (ground) to achieve optimal optical characteristics.\n\nDepending on the end-user requirements, various processing methods are used to modify TiO2, including sedimentation of oxides of silicon, aluminum, zirconium, or zinc onto the surface of pigment fractions.\n\nParticular processing methods may be used to optimize operational characteristics for specific applications utilizing oxides in aqueous or anhydrous environments or various combinations thereof. Additionally, organic additives can be introduced by multiple methods to enhance particular characteristics of the pigment.\n\nAdvantages of the chloride method:\n\nHigh TiO2 quality;\n\nReduced number of production stages and waste compared to the sulfate method.\n\nDisadvantages of the chloride method:\n\nHigh requirements for raw materials – the use of natural rutile concentrates, synthetic rutile or titanium slags with a TiO2 content of 85% or more as raw materials, as well as special slags that have undergone additional processing and contain more than 92% TiO2;\n\nExtremely complicated organization of work with chlorine and the need to take measures to prevent chlorine losses;\n\nThe complexity of organizing and recycling ferric chloride and impurities found in the slag;\n\nAcute need to use equipment made of expensive corrosion-resistant materials.\n\nAdvantages of the sulfate method:\n\nThe quality of the finished product is not worse than the quality of products produced by the chloride method (by using modern technological solutions at the stage of washing chromophore impurities from hydrated TiO2);\n\n“Zero” waste production – the possibility of completely recycling all production waste into marketable products. Today, waste disposal after the sulfate method is quite sophisticated. At some factories, sales of products obtained from production waste are comparable to sales volumes of commercial products;\n\nManufacturing of main equipment and technological devices is cheaper than implementing the chloride method of TiO2 production.\n\nDisadvantages of the sulfate method:\n\nInfluence of chromophore impurities on the finished product quality indicators;\n\nInability to use natural (or artificial) rutile as a raw material;\n\nUse of modified and slightly modified ilmenite concentrates as raw materials.\n\nWhich Process is More Efficient in Your Case?

Most of them undergo inorganic and, in some cases, organic treatment applied to the surface of TiO2 particles through sedimentation, mechanical mixing, or some other method.\n\nSuch surface treatment methods improve one or even several operational properties of the pigment, including ease of dispersion, resistance to atmospheric influences, or color stability.\n\nA universal surface treatment method for obtaining a pigment suitable for any practical application has yet to be found. Therefore, the goal of ongoing research is to continue developing new grades of TiO2 that would meet the constantly changing requirements of modern industry.\n\nTitanium dioxide production is a fascinating scientific and technical research and innovation area. Recently, a technology for producing TiO2 has been developed in which ammonium fluoride is used as the primary reagent and is safer than sulfuric acid. Besides, this reagent can be reused, leading to a reduction in waste. One disadvantage of the fluoride technology is that it results in a coarser-dispersed pigment powder compared to the chloride method.\n\nWe have sufficient human resources to carry out projects of any size with our own team, without involving subcontracting companies.\n\nWe have extensive positive experience in the field of metallurgy and chemical production: People’s Republic of China, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Republic of India, Republic of Kazakhstan, Arab Republic of Egypt, etc.\n\nWe have patents and implemented proprietary systems.\n\nWe have developed our own technologies.\n\nAll projects are performed with the use of BIM.\n\nAll critical areas are calculated using CFD modeling.\n\nWe carry out all types of calculations of metallurgical and energy generating units, gas purification, water supply, water treatment and wastewater systems etc.\n\nCheck out industrial wastewater treatment services from M HEAVY TECHNOLOGY.\n\nDesign – supply of equipment – supervision – installation – design supervision– commissioning.\n\nExperience in implementing large «turnkey» projects.\n\nWe offer minimal design time and ideal price/quality ratio.\n\nIn 100% of cases the Customer contacts us again for new projects.\n\nWhich Process is More Efficient in Your Case?
