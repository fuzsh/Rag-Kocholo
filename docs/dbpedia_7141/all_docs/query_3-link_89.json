The most common use—coatings and plastics—accounts for more than 80 percent of global consumption. Tronox markets a range of TiONA® and TiKON® titanium dioxide pigment products, and our talented team of scientists works to enhance the performance of products in our customers’ current and future applications.\n\nAs one of the leading producers of TiO2, Tronox uses a proprietary chloride process technology as well as the sulfate process to make products that are used by manufacturers of coatings, plastics and décor paper."
