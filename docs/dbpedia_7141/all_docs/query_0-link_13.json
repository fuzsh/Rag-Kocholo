        "text": "What Is Titanium Dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide is an oxide of titanium represented by the chemical formula TiO2. It is the most stable of all titanium oxides. It is more commonly called titanium dioxide (IV). Other names include titanium dioxide, dioxotitanium(IV), and titanium(IV) dioxide, in addition to titanium(IV) oxide.\n\nThe main crystal structures of titanium dioxide are the anatase and rutile types. When the anatase type is heated above 1652°F (900ºC), it irreversibly transforms to the rutile type, which is a restable structure of titania. Titanium(IV) dioxide is soluble in hydrofluoric acid, hot concentrated sulfuric acid, and molten alkali salts. On the other hand, it is insoluble in other acids, alkalis, water, and organic solvents.\n\nNaturally occurring as a by-product mineral of igneous and metamorphic rocks formed at high temperatures, titanium dioxide is produced as a mineral in the form of gold-red (rutile type), pyrite (anatase type), and plate titanite. In the industrial production of titanium dioxide, rutile ore or ilmenite ore (FeTiO3) is used as a raw material. Several production methods are known, known as the chlorine method and the sulfuric acid method.\n\nUses of Titanium Dioxide\n\nThe two basic uses of titanium dioxide are as pigments and photocatalysts. The rutile type is often used as a pigment and the anatase type as a photocatalyst.\n\nFirst, titanium dioxide is used as a white pigment. The rutile type, which has low activity as a catalyst and excellent thermal stability, is used as a pigment in paints and is called titanium white, titanium white, or titanium white, and has high hiding power. The pigment's classification name (color index name) is C.I. Pigment White 6. Specific applications include coloring pigments for paints, printing inks, inkjet inks, and plastics.\n\nTitanium Dioxide is also used as a photocatalyst. When exposed to short-wavelength light equivalent to ultraviolet rays, titania reacts with water to produce reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species have strong oxidizing power and decompose chemicals and bacteria. The anatase type has a larger band gap and is generally more active as a photocatalyst."
