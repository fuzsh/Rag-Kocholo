        "text": "CAS Number: 13463-67-7\n\nMolecular formula: TiO2\n\nEC / List no.: 236-675-5\n\nTitanium is a common metal element frequently found throughout nature.\n\nIn our environment, titanium is naturally exposed to oxygen, forming titanium oxides that we find in many minerals, dusts, sands, and soils.\n\nTiO2 is one of the many oxides formed naturally in our environment.\n\nTitanium dioxide is then processed and refined to meet stringent safety guidelines based on the end-use for the mineral.\n\nTiO2 is an insoluble mineral, meaning it cannot dissolve in water.\n\nTiO2 occurs in many silicates in nature, accounting for over 1% of the earth's crust.\n\nTitanium dioxide is manufactured using a variety of materials and processes.\n\nTitanium dioxide power is very fine-grained and it agglomerates, so glazes containing it need to be sieved to break down the small lumps (even a high speed propeller mixer often won't do it).\n\nAlthough titanium is the strongest white pigment known for many uses, in ceramics the whiteness (and opacity) it imparts to glazes is due to its tendency to crystallize during cooling.\n\nWhile titanium dioxide is used in glazes as an opacifier, it is not as effective and easy-to-use as tin oxide or zircon.\n\nTitanium dioxide can be used as an additive to enliven (variegate, crystallize) the color and texture of glazes by introducing crystallization.\n\nRutile works in a similar manner, typically both become saturated in the melt beyond about 5-6%, producing a dry and unstable glaze surface.\n\nIn moderate amounts it encourages strong melts, durable surfaces and rich visual textures.\n\nTitanium is available both as raw and surface treated products.\n\nNon-pigmentary grades flow more freely in the dry state.\n\nSelf opacified enamels are made by adding titanium during smelting to super saturation.\n\nUpon firing the enamel, the titanium crystallizes or precipitates to produce the opacity.\n\nTitania is also used in dry process enameling on cast iron appliances for its effect on acid resistance, color and texture.\n\nIn glass, non-pigmentary titanium dioxide increases refractive index, intensifies color.\n\nUses\n\nIn ceramic glazes, titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.\n\nTiO2 is used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes which are both oil and water dispersible, and in certain grades for the cosmetic industry.\n\nTiO2 is also a common ingredient in toothpaste.\n\nThe exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid.\n\nThe most important application areas of Titanium dioxide are paints and varnishes as well as paper and plastics, which account for about 80% of the world's titanium dioxide consumption.\n\nOther pigment applications of Titanium dioxide is such as printing inks, fibers, rubber, cosmetic products, and food account for another 8%.\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in other applications, for instance the production of technical pure titanium, glass and glass ceramics, electrical ceramics, metal patinas, catalysts, electric conductors, and chemical intermediates.\n\nTitanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula TiO2.\n\nTiO2 is used as a food coloring, it has E number E171.\n\nWhen Titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or CI 77891.\n\nGenerally, Titanium dioxide is sourced from ilmenite, rutile, and anatase.\n\nE171 has a wide range of applications, including paint, sunscreen, and food coloring.\n\nTiO2 uses include general purpose pigment designed primarily for plastics applications, blow molding, blown film, cast film, injection molded products, pigment, plastic molding, plastics.\n\nPersonal Care:\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is used in a variety of personal care products, including sunscreens, pressed powders, and loose powders, as a UV filter or whitening agent.\n\nIn lotions and creams, it presents low risk of exposure.\n\nCoatings and Construction: Titanium dioxide has resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet (UV) light in exposed applications.\n\nIt is used in products such as paints and coatings, including glazes and enamels, plastics, paper, inks, fibres, foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\n\nPlastic Molding:\n\nTitanium dioxide possesses non-flammable, insoluble and durable qualities.\n\nTiO2 ensure UV rays do no penetrate and damage the product and its appearance.\n\nPharmaceutical Industry:\n\nTiO2 is used as pigment for pharmaceutical products such as gelatin capsules, tablet coatings and syrups\n\nMolar mass: 79.866 g/mol\n\nAppearance:

fine, white powder that provides a bright, white pigment.\n\nTitanium dioxide has been used for a century in a range of industrial and consumer products, including paints, coatings, adhesives, paper, plastics and rubber, printing inks, coated fabrics and textiles, as well as ceramics, floor coverings, roofing materials, cosmetics, toothpaste, soap, water treatment agents, pharmaceuticals, food colorants, automotive products, sunscreen and catalysts.\n\nTiO2 is produced in two main forms.\n\nThe primary form, comprising over 98 percent of total production, is pigment grade titanium dioxide.\n\nThe pigmentary form makes use of titanium dioxide’s excellent light-scattering properties in applications that require white opacity and brightness.\n\nThe other form of Titanium dioxide in which titanium dioxide is produced is as an ultrafine (nanomaterial) product.\n\nTiO2 this form is selected when different properties, such as transparency and maximum ultraviolet light absorption, are required, such as in cosmetic sunscreens.\n\nPigment-grade Titanium Dioxide\n\nPigment-grade titanium dioxide is used in a range of applications that require high opacity and brightness.\n\nIn fact, most surfaces and items that are white and pastel, and even dark shades of color, contain titanium dioxide.\n\nPigment-grate titanium dioxide is used in a range of applications, including:\n\nPaints and Coatings: Titanium dioxide provides opacity and durability, while helping to ensure the longevity of the paint and protection of the painted surface.\n\nPlastics, Adhesives and Rubber: Titanium dioxide can help minimize the brittleness, fading and cracking that can occur in plastics and other materials as a result of light exposure.\n\nCosmetics: Pigment-grade titanium dioxide is use in some cosmetics to aid in hiding blemishes and brightening the skin.\n\nTiO2 allows for the use of thinner coatings of make-up material for the same desired effect.\n\nPaper: Titanium dioxide is used to coat paper, making it whiter, brighter and more opaque.\n\nFood Contact Materials and Ingredients: The opacity to visible and ultraviolet light offered by titanium dioxide protects food, beverages, supplements and pharmaceuticals from premature degradation, enhancing the longevity of the product.\n\nSpecific classes of high purity pigment-grade titanium dioxide are also used in drug tablets, capsule coatings and as a decorative aid in some foods.\n\nTitanium dioxide is a kind of pigment made by vitriol method.\n\nZincoxide is used as Titanium dioxides crystal lattice stabilizer.\n\nTitanium dioxide's surface is treated with inorganic composite consisting of titaniuin dioxide.silica and aluminum oxide.\n\nTiO2 is coated with organic componnds Coarse powders are renloved off in production so that particle size distribution is uniforln.\n\nTiO2 has excellent luster.outstanding hiding powder,colorability and good dispersibility.\n\nPerformances of the pigment achieve or surpass that of imported similar products.\n\nTiO2 (TiO2) is the main white pigment widely used across many packaged food products, including confections, soups, fillings, sauces, pet food, and powdered soft drinks to name a few.\n\nTitania has been a go-to ingredient for many years due to excellent stability in heat, light, pH, oil, and moisture but has been at the center of many headlines lately.\n\nPigment:\n\nFirst mass-produced in 1916, titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials.\n\nTitanium dioxide crystal size is ideally around 220 nm (measured by electron microscope) to optimize the maximum reflection of visible light.\n\nHowever, abnormal grain growth is often observed in titanium dioxide, particularly in its rutile phase.\n\nThe occurrence of abnormal grain growth brings about a deviation of a small number of crystallites from the mean crystal size and modifies the physical behaviour of TiO2.\n\nThe optical properties of the finished pigment of Titanium dioxide are highly sensitive to purity.\n\nTitanium dioxide, as little as a few parts per million (ppm) of certain metals (Cr, V, Cu, Fe, Nb) can disturb the crystal lattice so much that the effect can be detected in quality control.\n\nApproximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as use continues to rise.\n\nTiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets), and most toothpastes; in 2019 it was present in two thirds of toothpastes on the French market.\n\nIn paint, Titanium dioxide is often referred to offhandedly as \"brilliant white\", \"the perfect white\", \"the whitest white\", or other similar terms.\n\nTitanium dioxide opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is used in a variety of personal care products, including sunscreens, pressed powders, and loose powders, as a UV filter or whitening agent.\n\nIn lotions and creams, TiO2 presents low risk of exposure.\n\nHowever, when TiO2 is inhalable—as it may be in powders—it is considered a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\nNanoized TiO2 does not appear to confer any unique health hazards.\n\nTiO2 is a naturally-occurring mineral found in the earth’s crust.\n\nBecause of Titanium dioxides white color, opaqueness, and ability to refract light, the ingredient is often used as a pigment, brightener, and opacifier, which is an ingredient that makes a formulation more opaque.\n\nTitanium dioxide is also a UV filter and so is an effective active ingredient in sunscreens.\n\nTiO2 is often used in cosmetic loose and pressed powders, especially “mineral powder” cosmetics, in addition to other cosmetics, lotions, toothpaste, and soap.\n\nTitanium dioxide, also called titania, (TiO2), a white, opaque, naturally occurring mineral existing in a number of crystalline forms, the most important of which are rutile and anatase.\n\nThese naturally occurring oxide, Titanium dioxide , forms can be mined and serve as a source for commercial titanium.\n\nTiO2 is odourless and absorbent.\n\nTitanium dioxides most important function in powder form is as a widely used pigment for lending whiteness and opacity.\n\nHow are we typically exposed to titanium dioxide?\n\nThere are many ways we’re exposed to titanium dioxide in our everyday life.\n\nBelow are the most common ways we come into contact with titanium dioxide.\n\nAre there any health concerns associated with exposure to titanium dioxide?\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified titanium dioxide as “possibly carcinogenic to humans,” based on studies that showed increased lung tumors in rats associated with titanium dioxide inhalation.\n\nHowever, extensive studies on titanium dioxide industry workers do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer in humans.\n\nWhat are the differences between pigment-grade titanium dioxide and titanium dioxide nanomaterials?\n\nPigment-grade titanium dioxide is manufactured at a specific particle size distribution to optimize the scattering of visible light and enhance surface opacity.\n\nTiO2 is produced primarily in the pigmentary form (over 98 percent of total production), which makes use of its excellent light-scattering properties for a range of applications that require opacity and brightness.\n\nTitanium dioxide nanomaterials are purposefully made in a much smaller particle size distribution than pigmentary particles and are transparent and more effective as UV absorbers or photocatalysts.\n\nThe transparency and UV absorbance allow for effective use as a protective ingredient for sunscreens.\n\nWhy is titanium dioxide used in toothpaste?\n\nTiO2 is often used to impart whiteness to food products, cosmetics and personal care items, like toothpaste.\n\nFDA has assessed the safety of titanium dioxide as a color additive and has issued regulations approving the ingredient for these purposes.\n\nTitanium dioxide in food:\n\nIn food, TiO2 is used in pigment grade (see below) and called E171.\n\nIn many food products it acts as a whitener, but also as a colour and texture enhancer.\n\nE171 can give smoothness, when used in some chocolates, or can help give an abrasive effect, as used in some sweets.\n\nEnvironmental benefits of Titanium dioxide:\n\nDue to Titanium dioxides various properties, titanium dioxide has been found to be useful for many different environmentally friendly applications.\n\nWhen TiO2 is used in a paint coating on the outside of buildings in warm and tropical climates, the white, light-reflecting qualities of TiO2 can lead to considerable energy savings, as it reduces the need for air-conditioning.\n\nAlso, Titanium dioxides opaqueness means Titanium dioxide doesn’t need to be applied in thick or double coats, improving resource efficiency and avoiding waste.\n\nAs a photocatalyst, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows and tiles in order to decompose environmental pollutants.\n\nAs a nanomaterial (see below), Titanium dioxide can also be used as a crucial DeNOx catalyst in exhaust gas systems for cars, trucks and power plants, thus minimising their environmental impact.\n\nResearchers are discovering new potential uses for titanium dioxide in this form.\n\nTiO2 includes clean energy production.\n\nAs a photocatalyst, Titanium dioxide has also been shown that TiO2 can carry out hydrolysis (breaking water into hydrogen and oxygen), and the collected hydrogen can be used as a fuel.\n\nAlso, a type of solar power cell available for use – known as Grätzel cells – utilises nano-grade titanium dioxide to produce solar energy in a process similar to photosynthesis in plants.\n\nTopical Exposure\n\nWe apply titanium dioxide to our skin in the form of sunscreens, makeup, lip balms, nail polish, and other cosmetic products.\n\nWe even use titanium dioxide when brushing our teeth as it’s found in many toothpastes.\n\nRespiratory Exposure\n\nIn industrial settings, people can be exposed to titanium dioxide through inhalation.\n\nInhalation exposure to titanium dioxide is exceedingly rare for most people.\n\nWhy does the exposure route matter and does titanium dioxide harm our health?\n\nHow we’re exposed to an ingredient matters greatly in terms of our long-term health.\n\nResearch shows that inhaling titanium dioxide particles in significant quantities over time can cause adverse health outcomes.\n\nUnless you work in an industrial setting, inhaling substantial amounts of titanium dioxide is highly unlikely.\n\nResearch supports that applying titanium dioxide to the skin in the form of sunscreens, makeup, and other topical products does not pose any health risks.\n\nOverwhelmingly, research that’s relevant to human’s eating patterns shows us that E171 is safe when ingested normally through foods and drugs (1,2,3).\n\nOther research suggests that E171 could cause harm; however, those research processes did not take into consideration how people are typically exposed to E171.\n\nResearch that adds E171 to drinking water, utilizes direct injections, or gives research animals E171 through a feeding apparatus is not replicating typical human exposure.\n\nHow to Approach Titanium Dioxide in Products?\n\nAvoid titanium dioxide in powdered cosmetics, including loose and pressed powders, eyeshadows, and blush.\n\nSome sunscreens will say “non-nano” on the label, choose those, and if the label doesn’t specify if titanium dioxide is nanoparticle size, call or email the company and ask the particle size of the active sunscreen ingredient.\n\nLook for the MADE SAFE seal on products, which means they’re made without unsafe titanium dioxide and other ingredients linked to human health and ecosystem harm.\n\nTiO2 is considered as an inert and safe material and has been used in many applications for decades.\n\nHowever, with the development of nanotechnologies TiO2 nanoparticles, with numerous novel and useful properties, are increasingly manufactured and used.\n\nTherefore increased human and environmental exposure can be expected, which has put TiO2 nanoparticles under toxicological scrutiny.\n\nMechanistic toxicological studies show that TiO2 nanoparticles predominantly cause adverse effects via induction of oxidative stress resulting in cell damage, genotoxicity, inflammation, immune response etc.\n\nThe extent and type of damage strongly depends on physical and chemical characteristics of TiO2 nanoparticles, which govern their bioavailability and reactivity.\n\nBased on the experimental evidence from animal inhalation studies TiO2 nanoparticles are classified as “possible carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and as occupational carcinogen by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nThe studies on dermal exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles, which is in humans substantial through the use of sunscreens, generally indicate negligible transdermal penetration; however data are needed on long-term exposure and potential adverse effects of photo-oxidation products.\n\nAlthough TiO2 is permitted as an additive (E171) in food and pharmaceutical products we do not have reliable data on its absorption, distribution, excretion and toxicity on oral exposure.\n\nTiO2 may also enter environment, and while it exerts low acute toxicity to aquatic organisms, upon long-term exposure it induces a range of sub-lethal effects.\n\nConclusions\n\nUntil relevant toxicological and human exposure data that would enable reliable risk assessment are obtained, TiO2 nanoparticles should be used with great care.\n\nWhat is TiO2 made of?\n\nTitanium is one of the most common metals on earth, but it does not occur naturally in this elemental form. Titanium dioxide – also known as titanium (IV) oxide or titania – is the naturally occurring compound created when titanium reacts with the oxygen in the air. As an oxide, titanium is found in minerals in the earth’s crust. It also found with other elements, including calcium and iron.\n\nIts chemical formula is TiO2, which means it consists of one titanium atom and two oxygen atoms (hence dioxide). It has a CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) registration number of 13463-67-7.\n\nTiO2 is typically thought of as being chemically inert, meaning it doesn’t react with other chemicals and is, therefore, a stable substance that can be used in many different industries and for a variety of applications.\n\nWhere does TiO2 come from and why do we need Titanium dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is a bright white substance used primarily as a vivid colourant in a wide array of common products.\n\nTitanium dioxide also has a number of lesser-known qualities that make it an extremely useful and important ingredient in our battle to fight climate change and prevent skin cancer.\n\nPrized for Titanium dioxides ultra-white colour, ability to scatter light and UV-resistance, TiO2 is a popular ingredient, appearing in hundreds of products we see and use every day, bringing significant benefits to our economy and overall quality of life.\n\n-Across the EU, applications for TiO2 include paints, plastics, paper, pharmaceuticals, sunscreen and food.\n\n-As a photocatalyst, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows and tiles in order to decompose environmental pollutants.\n\n-As a white pigment, TiO2 is one of the most important raw materials for paints and coatings.\n\nWhy is TiO2 used in cosmetics and personal care products?\n\nTitanium dioxide is used as a colorant to make cosmetics and personal care products that are applied to the skin (including the eye area), nails, and lips white in color.\n\nTiO2 helps to increase the opaqueness, and reduce the transparency of product formulas.\n\nTitanium dioxide also absorbs, reflects, or scatters light (including ultraviolet radiation from the sun), which can cause products to deteriorate.\n\nTitanium dioxide is an important active ingredient used in some sunscreen products.\n\nSunscreens are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.\n\nTitanium dioxides ultra-white colour, highly-refractive and UV-resistant properties make TiO2 enormously popular with both the industrial and consumer sectors, appearing in dozens of products that people use and see on a daily basis.\n\nTiO2 used also in paints, catalytic coatings, plastics, paper, pharmaceuticals and sunscreen, some lesser-known applications include packaging, commercial printing inks, other cosmetics, toothpastes, and food (where it is listed as the food colourant E171).\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assessed the safety of titanium dioxide pigment as a color additive in food, drug and cosmetic applications, and as an ingredient in sunscreen products.\n\nFDA has also issued guidance clarifying the safe use of titanium dioxide pigment as a food colorant, and has stated that titanium dioxide may be safely used in cosmetics, including cosmetics intended for use around the eye.\n\nTitanium dioxide is included in FDA’s list of acceptable active ingredients in sunscreen products.\n\nAccording to FDA, active ingredients in sunscreen such as titanium dioxide protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays.\n\nAs such, they must be shown to be safe and effective and must comply with all other requirements listed in the FDA's OTC sunscreen monograph.\n\nIndividual sunscreen active ingredients are reviewed by FDA and only those that are on FDA's monograph approved list may be used in sunscreen products marketed in the U.S.\n\nTitanium dioxide is generally a white powder that gives products a white color.\n\nWhen TiO2 is made into a very fine powder, it no longer gives the product a white color.\n\nTiO2 is this fine material, sometimes called microfine or nanoscale titanium dioxide that is used in many OTC sunscreen products.\n\nUse of this ultrafine material enables the sunscreens to be applied as a clear film that consumers prefer over the antiquated, white opaque lotions.\n\nThe availability of microfine titanium dioxide in sunscreen products helps increase consumer acceptance and usage. Practicing sun safety, including proper sunscreen use, is important in helping to reduce the incidence of skin cancer.\n\nAs a pigment, titanium dioxide is an FDA-approved food additive that is used to enhance the white color of certain foods, such as dairy products and candy, and to add brightness to toothpaste and some medications.\n\nTiO2 is also used as a flavor enhancer in a variety of non-white foods, including dried vegetables, nuts, seeds, soups, and mustard, as well as beer and wine.\n\nTitanium Dioxide is used as an opacifying agent and a colorant.\n\nIn OTC drug products, TiO2 is used as a sunscreen agent.\n\nTiO2 is a mineral composed of titanium and oxygen in the form of a white powder.\n\nTitania can be found in cosmetic products like sunscreen.\n\nTo identify titanium dioxide in our products, take a look at the ingredients list on packaging.\n\nTitania can be found under the names TITANIUM DIOXIDE, TITANIUM DIOXIDE [NANO], CI 77891.\n\nProduction of Titanium dioxide:\n\nThe production method depends on the feedstock.\n\nThe most common mineral source is ilmenite.\n\nThe abundant rutile mineral sand can also be purified with the chloride process or other processes.\n\nIlmenite is converted into pigment grade titanium dioxide via either the sulfate process or the chloride process.\n\nBoth sulfate and chloride processes produce the titanium dioxide pigment in the rutile crystal form, but the Sulfate Process can be adjusted to produce the anatase form.\n\nAnatase, being softer, is used in fiber and paper applications.\n\nThe Sulfate Process is run as a batch process; the Chloride Process is run as a continuous process.\n\nPlants using the Sulfate Process require ilmenite concentrate (45-60% TiO2) or pretreated feedstocks as suitable source of titanium.\n\nIn the sulfate process, ilmenite is treated with sulfuric acid to extract iron(II) sulfate pentahydrate.\n\nThe resulting synthetic rutile is further processed according to the specifications of the end user, i.e. pigment grade or otherwise.\n\nIn another method for the production of Titanium dioxide, synthetic rutile from ilmenite the Becher Process first oxidizes the ilmenite as a means to separate the iron component.\n\nAn alternative process, known as the chloride process converts ilmenite or other titanium sources to titanium tetrachloride via reaction with elemental chlorine, which is then purified by distillation, and reacted with oxygen to regenerate chlorine and produce the titanium dioxide.\n\nTiO2 pigment can also be produced from higher titanium content feedstocks such as upgraded slag, rutile, and leucoxene via a chloride acid process.\n\nThe five largest TiO2 pigment processors are in 2019 Chemours, Cristal Global, Venator, Kronos, and Tronox, which is the largest one.\n\nMajor paint and coating company end users for pigment grade titanium dioxide include Akzo Nobel, PPG Industries, Sherwin Williams, BASF, Kansai Paints and Valspar.\n\nGlobal TiO2 pigment demand for 2010 was 5.3 Mt with annual growth expected to be about 3-4%.\n\nClassification of the substance or mixture:\n\nNot a hazardous substance or mixture according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.\n\nLabel elements:\n\nNot a hazardous substance or mixture according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.\n\nOther hazards\n\nThis substance/mixture contains no components considered to be either persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) at levels of 0.1% or higher.\n\nDescription of first-aid measures\n\nIf inhaled:\n\nIf breathed in, move person into fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration.\n\nIn case of skin contact:\n\nWash off with soap and plenty of water.\n\nIn case of eye contact:\n\nFlush eyes with water as a precaution.\n\nIf swallowed:\n\nNever give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Rinse mouth with water.\n\nTiO2 is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined from the earth, processed and refined, and added to a variety of foods, as well as other consumer products.\n\nWhite in color, Titanium dioxide is used to enhance the color and sheen of certain foods and is also key for food safety applications.\n\nIn Titanium dioxides natural state it exists in different bulk crystalline forms, such as anatase and rutile, but during processing it is ground into a very fine powder.\n\nApplications:\n\n-Inks\n\n-Plastics\n\n-Paper\n\n-Coatings\n\n-We also offer a Titanium Dioxide paint pigment\n\nBenefits:\n\n-High durability\n\n-Good dispersibility\n\n-Low oil absorption\n\n-Strong tinting strength\n\n-Outstanding machining performance\n\n-Blue undertone\n\n-Good whiteness, brightness and gloss\n\n-Outstanding weather resistance\n\n-Interior coatings\n\n-Leather\n\n-Interior plastics\n\n-Paper\n\n-Films\n\n-Waxes\n\n-Rubber\n\n-PU resin\n\n-PE resin\n\nTiO2 is a naturally occurring mineral that's used in a variety of products, including sunscreens.\n\nBecause of Titanium dioxides ability to help protect the skin from the widest spectrum of UV light, including both UVA and UVB rays, sunscreens with titanium dioxide are ideal for both daily and prolonged sun exposure.\n\nTitanium dioxide is often used in combination with zinc oxide.\n\nA sunscreen with titanium dioxide can be used by anyone for daily use as well as during times of prolonged sun exposure.\n\nSunscreen products with this ingredient can be suitable for all skin types, including babies and those with sensitive skin.\n\nThin films:\n\nWhen deposited as a thin film, TiO2's refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors; TiO2 is also used in generating decorative thin films such as found in \"mystic fire topaz\".\n\nSome grades of modified titanium based pigments as used in sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and cosmetics - these are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – in order to have glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products.\n\nIn addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers.\n\nIn some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800 °C.\n\nOne example of a pearlescent pigment is Iriodin, based on mica coated with titanium dioxide or iron (III) oxide.\n\nThe iridescent effect in these titanium oxide particles is unlike the opaque effect obtained with usual ground titanium oxide pigment obtained by mining, in which case only a certain diameter of the particle is considered and the effect is due only to scattering.\n\nTiO2 can form several different shapes, which have different properties. Some shapes can be converted to nanomaterials.\n\nMicronized TiO2 (also called “nano”) was introduced in the early 1990s.\n\nNanotechnology and micronization both refer to the practice of creating very small particles sizes of a given material.\n\nNano usually refers to particles smaller than 100 nanometers; a nanometer is 1/1 billionth of a meter.\n\nAt these small sizes, and at low concentrations, Titanium dioxide appears transparent, allowing for effective sunscreens that do not appear white.\n\nTiO2 will be listed on product labels, but companies are not required to list ingredient size or structure.\n\nWhen Titanium dioxide is used in sunscreens, TiO2 is considered an active ingredient, which means the concentration must also be listed.\n\nTitanium dioxide has been used as a bleaching and opacifying agent in porcelain enamels, giving them brightness, hardness, and acid resistance.\n\nIn modern times Titanium dioxide is used in cosmetics, such as in skin care products and sunscreen lotions, with claims that titanium dioxide protects the skin from ultraviolet radiation because of its property to absorb ultraviolet light.\n\nThe photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide results in thin coatings exhibiting self-cleaning and disinfecting properties under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\n\nAlloys are characterized by being lightweight and having very high tensile strength (even at high temperatures), high corrosion resistance, and an ability to withstand extreme temperatures and thus are used principally in aircraft, pipes for power plants, armour plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles.\n\nTiO2 is a white inorganic compound, which has been used for around 100 years in a vast number of diverse products.\n\nTitanium dioxide is depended on it for its non-toxic, non-reactive and luminous properties, which safely heighten the whiteness and brightness of many materials.\n\nTiO2 is the whitest and brightest of known pigments, with reflective qualities; it can also both scatter and absorb UV rays.\n\nWhat Is Titanium dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined from the earth then further processed and purified for use in consumer products.\n\nAlso known as titanium (IV) oxide or titania, Titanium dioxide is the naturally occurring compound comprised of the metal titanium and oxygen.\n\nTitanium dioxide is safely used in many products from paint and food to drugs and cosmetics.\n\nTitanium dioxide also plays a critical role in some sunscreen products as a way to protect skin from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.\n\nTitanium Dioxide is used to enhance patent (visible) ridge detail or other patterns found on relatively smooth dark surfaces.\n\nTiO2 is a suspension of Titanium Dioxide in a carrier liquid.\n\nThe most common use for Titanium Dioxide at scenes is for the enhancement of patterns of dried blood.\n\nEnhancement occurs through the adherence of Titanium Dioxide to blood (and potentially other materials) stuck to the smooth surface.\n\nThe white color of the Titanium Dioxide makes it appropriate for enhancement of patterns observed on relatively smooth dark surfaces, where it provides additional contrast.\n\nThe methanol-based solution is preferred when the surface in question is suitable.\n\nCAS Registry No.: 13463-67-7\n\nOther Names: TiO2, Titanium white\n\nMain Uses: Pigment, filler, opacifying agent\n\nAppearance: White powder.\n\nOdour: Odourless\n\nFlash Point: Noncombustible\n\nVapor Pressure: 0 mm Hg at 68'F (20oC)\n\nSpecific Gravity: 3.9 to 4.2 (water = 1)\n\nWater Solubility: Insoluble\n\nBoiling Point: 4,532' to 5,432'F (2,500' to 3,000'C)\n\nMelting Point: 3,326' to 3,362'F (1,830' to 1,850'C)\n\nMolecular Weight: 79.9\n\nInhalation: At high concentrations: can irritate the nose and throat.\n\nSkin Contact: May cause mild irritation.\n\nEye Contact: May cause slight irritation as a \"foreign object\".\n\nTearing, blinking and mild temporary pain may occur as particles are rinsed from the eye by tears.\n\nIngestion: Not harmful.\n\nEffects of Long-Term (Chronic) Exposure: Conclusions cannot be drawn from the limited studies available.\n\nCarcinogenicity: Possible carcinogen.

also exhibits photocatalytic activity in the presence of light with an energy equal to or higher than its band-gap energy.\n\nThese characteristics offer a wide range of applications.\n\nFor these reasons, and because of the relatively low price of the raw material and its processing, titania has gained widespread attention over recent decades.\n\nTiO2 has been classified in humans and animals as biologically inert, and is widely considered to be a “natural” material, which at least partially contributes to its relatively positive acceptance by the public.\n\nIn fact, most TiO2 has been synthesized from the mineral illmenite, FeTiO3, using the “sulphate” or “chloride” process for nearly 100 years.\n\nThe annual worldwide production of titania powder in 2005 has been estimated to be around 5 million tons, provoking the question as to its abundance in the environment.\n\nThe proportion of nano-sized titania is estimated to have been approximately 2.5 % in 2009, increasing to 10 % by 20154, with an exponential increase over the past decade.\n\nDuring recent decades, TiO2 powders have begun to appear in many applications, mainly due to their ability to confer whiteness and opacity on various products, such as paints, papers and cosmetics.\n\nIts high technological attractiveness originates from its light-scattering properties and very high refractive index, which mean that relatively low levels of the pigment are required to achieve a white, opaque coating.\n\nThe range of light that is scattered depends on the particle size.\n\nNumerous technological improvements, based on nano-sized TiO2, have been introduced that enable its use for antifogging and self-cleaning coatings on glass, for building facades, in confectionary, in the plastics industry, and so on.\n\nFurthermore, TiO2 is accepted as a food and pharmaceutical additive.\n\nIn the United States Titanium dioxide is included in FDA Inactive Ingredients Guide for dental paste, oral capsules, suspensions, tablets, dermal preparations and in non-parenteral medicines.\n\nThe increasing production of nano-sized TiO2 powder has led to growing concerns about the consequences of exposure of humans and the environment.\n\nIn the present paper we review and discuss the latest findings on potential hazard of exposure to nano-sized TiO2 for humans and environment, in regard to the particle size and the crystal structure of TiO2, the route of exposure as well as the effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced photocatalysis.\n\nEye/face protection:\n\nUse equipment for eye protection tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or EN 166(EU).\n\nSkin protection:\n\nHandle with gloves.\n\nGloves must be inspected prior to use.\n\nUse proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface) to avoid skin contact with this product.\n\nDispose of contaminated gloves after use in accordance with applicable laws and good laboratory practices.\n\nWash and dry hands.\n\nThe selected protective gloves have to satisfy the specifications of Regulation (EU) 2016/425 and the standard EN 374 derived from it.\n\nBody Protection:\n\nChoose body protection in relation to its type, to the concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and to the specific work-place.\n\nThe type of protective equipment must be selected according to the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace.\n\nWhat are the different forms of titanium dioxide in beauty and personal care products?\n\nTitanium dioxide is produced at pigment grade or nano grade.\n\nPigment grade titanium dioxide is produced at a much larger particle size than nano grade.\n\nTiO2 is used as a colourant to whiten and brighten product formulations.\n\nNano grade titanium dioxide is manufactured into very fine (nano) particles and is transparent and colourless.\n\nTitanium dioxide is commonly used in sunscreens to provide effective protection from potentially harmful UV rays.\n\nAre there any alternatives to toothpastes with titanium dioxide?\n\nA number of our toothpastes do not contain titanium dioxide, including some of our Signal products (Signal Bio, Signal Nature Element, Signal White System, Signal Kids (Baby & Junior), Signal White Now Detox, Signal Anti-Cavity), Love Beauty and Planet and Schmidt’s Naturals.\n\nAre there any other products where you use titanium dioxide?\n\nWe use titanium dioxide as a colourant in some home care products, including in laundry detergents, dishwasher tablets and toilet blocks.\n\nWe also use it as a colourant in a limited number of food products, for example in some of our dressings and ice creams.\n\nDIOXIDO DE TITANIO\n\nDIOXIDO DE

product label when used in food products and home, beauty and personal care products.\n\nIn food products, titanium dioxide appears on the product label as ‘E171’or titanium dioxide depending on the local regulations.\n\nIn beauty and personal care products, the ingredient is listed with its colour index (CI) number ‘CI 77891’.\n\nWhen nano grade titanium dioxide is used in our sunscreens, this is referenced as ‘titanium dioxide’ [nano] in the ingredients list.\n\nTitanium dioxide is a naturally occurring oxide of titanium.\n\nTitanium dioxide has the highest refractive index of any material known to man, even the diamond, and is one of the whitest materials on earth.\n\nWhen ground into a fine powder, Titanium dioxide transforms into a pigment that provides maximum whiteness and opacity.\n\nTiO2 pigments are used in paints and coatings, plastics, paper, building materials, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods and many other commercial products.\n\nUsage Instructions:\n\nFor melt and pour soap, mix 1 teaspoon with 1 tablespoon of 99 percent isopropyl alcohol.\n\nAdd 0.25 tsp. of dispersed pigment at a time to the melted soap.\n\nFor cold process, mix 1 teaspoon with 1 tablespoon of lightweight oil.\n\nAdd 1 tsp. of dispersed pigment at a time to the melted soap.\n\nNot recommended for lotion or bath bombs.\n\nTitanium dioxide is a chemical used as a pigment to make products appear white or non-transparent. These include some sunscreens, cosmetics, and art products.Titanium dioxide is a chemical used as a pigment to make products appear white or non-transparent.\n\nTitania include some sunscreens, cosmetics, and art products.\n\nTitanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system and, subsequently, enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids.\n\nTitanium dioxide occurs in nature as the minerals rutile and anatase.\n\nE171 is mainly sourced from ilmenite ore. This is the most widespread form of titanium dioxide-bearing ore around the world.\n\nRutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98% titanium dioxide in the ore.\n\nThe metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range 600–800 °C (1,110–1,470 °F).\n\nTitanium, the ninth most common element in the Earth’s crust, is a metal commonly found in plants and animals.\n\nTitanium naturally interacts with oxygen to form titanium oxides, commonly found in ores, indigenous dusts, sands and soils.\n\nMany people are familiar with titanium dioxide as an active ingredient in sunscreen.\n\nTitanium dioxide works as a UV filtering ingredient in sunscreen – it helps protect a person’s skin by blocking absorption of the sun’s ultraviolet light that can cause sunburn and is also linked to skin cancer.\n\nTiO2 is a white pigment and because of its brightness and very high refractive index it is most widely used.\n\nApproximately four million tons of this pigment are consumed annually worldwide.\n\nIn addition, TiO2 accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide, and is in the top five NPs used in consumer products.\n\nTiO2 can be used in paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, medicines, pharmaceuticals, food products, cosmetics, and toothpaste.\n\nTitanium dioxide can even be used as a pigment to whiten skim milk.\n\nTiO2 NPs are also used in sunscreens.\n\nIn addition, TiO2 has long been used as a component for articulating prosthetic implants, especially for the hip and knee.\n\nThese implants occasionally fail due to degradation of the materials in the implant or a chronic inflammatory response to the implant material.\n\nCurrently, TiO2 NPs are produced abundantly and used widely because of their high stability, anticorrosive and photocatalytic properties.\n\nSome have attributed this increased catalytic activity to TiO2 NPs to their high surface area, while others attribute it to TiO2 NPs being predominantly anatase rather than rutile.\n\nTiO2 NPs can be used in catalytic reactions, such as semiconductor photocatalysis, in the treatment of water contaminated with hazardous industrial by-products, and in nanocrystalline solar cells as a photoactive material.\n\nIndustrial utilization of the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 NPs has also found its way into other applications, especially for self-cleaning and anti-fogging purposes such as self-cleaning tiles, self-cleaning windows, self-cleaning textiles, and anti-fogging car mirrors.\n\nIn the field of nanomedicine, TiO2 NPs are under investigation as useful tools in advanced imaging and nanotherapeutics.\n\nFor example, TiO2 NPs are being evaluated as potential photosensitizers for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT).\n\nIn addition, unique physical properties make TiO2 NPs ideal for use in various skin care products.\n\nNano-preparations with TiO2 NPs are currently under investigation as novel treatments for acne vulgaris, recurrent condyloma accuminata, atopic dermatitis, hyperpigmented skin lesions, and other non-dermatologic diseases.\n\nTiO2 NPs also show antibacterial properties under UV light irradiation.\n\nHealth and safety:\n\nTitanium dioxide is incompatible with strong reducing agents and strong acids.\n\nViolent or incandescent reactions occur with molten metals that are electropositive, e.g. aluminium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and lithium.\n\nMany sunscreens use nanoparticle titanium dioxide (along with nanoparticle zinc oxide) which, despite reports of potential health risks, is not actually absorbed through the skin.\n\nOther effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on human health are not well understood.\n\nTitanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans.\n\nThe findings of the IARC are based on the discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation.\n\nThe series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments.\n\nHEALTH CONCERNS:\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer designates TiO2 as a carcinogen, largely due to studies that have found increased lung cancers due to inhalation exposure in animals.\n\nExposure: TiO2 does not penetrate through healthy skin and poses no local or systemic risk to human health from skin exposure.\n\nIn response to concerns that nano TiO2 might more readily penetrate damaged skin, researchers applied nano-based sunscreens to pigs ears that had been sunburnt.\n\nTiO2 did not reach the deeper levels of the skin in the sunburnt tissue.\n\nMost concerns arise when TiO2 is inhalable or respirable.\n\nIn order for TiO2 to be inhaled, particles must be small enough to reach the alveoli (where oxygen exchange happens) of the lungs.\n\nSampling methods have been developed to estimate the airborne mass concentration of respirable particles, and inhalable dust.\n\nInhalation & Cancer: The data suggests nanoized TiO2 can be inhaled by some mammals, leading to concerns about human inhalation.\n\nExisting studies have suggested TiO2 nanoparticles may be more toxic than traditional larger particles of TiO2.\n\nDwutlenek tytanu\n\nFerroTint White

different applications.\n\nTitanium dioxide has an extremely high melting point of 1,843ºC and boiling point of 2,972ºC, so occurs naturally as a solid, and, even in its particle form, it is insoluble in water. TiO2 is also an insulator.\n\nUnlike other white materials that may appear slightly yellow in light, because of the way TiO2 absorbs UV light, it doesn’t have this appearance and appears as pure white.\n\nImportantly, titanium dioxide also has a very high refractive index (its ability to scatter light), even higher than diamond. This makes it an incredibly bright substance and an ideal material for aesthetic design use.\n\nAnother crucial property of titanium dioxide is that it can show photocatalytic activity under UV light. This makes it effective for environmental purification, for different kinds of protective coatings, sterilisation and anti-fogging surfaces, and even in cancer therapy.\n\nBrilliant:\n\nBrilliance, colour strength, opacity and pearlescence unlike any other substances.\n\nResistant:\n\nStability to heat, light and weathering prevents degradation of paint, in films and embrittlement of plastics.\n\nProtective:\n\nAbility to scatter and absorb UV radiation makes TiO2 a crucial ingredient for sunscreen, protecting the skin from harmful, cancer-causing UV rays.\n\nPowerful:\n\nTitanium dioxide is used as a photocatalyst in solar panels as well as reducing pollutants in the air.\n\nWhat are the forms of titanium dioxide?\n\nTiO2 possesses different qualities depending on whether it is produced as pigment-grade or nanomaterial-grade. Both forms are tasteless, odourless and insoluble.\n\nPigment-grade TiO2 particles are approximately 200-350nm in dimension and this form accounts for 98 percent of total production. It is used mainly for light scattering and surface opacity applications, such as paint – this includes its use as a base for various colour paints or as a standalone ‘brilliant’ white.\n\nNano, or ultrafine TiO2 comprises of primary particles sized less than 100nm. In this grade, titanium dioxide is transparent (colourless) and boasts improved UV scattering and absorbing properties compared with larger particle-size, pigment-grade TiO2.\n\nMT(Micro Titanium Dioxide)\n\nMTW\n\nRFC\n\nRutile\n\nRutile Titanium Dioxide\n\nSACHTLEBEN\n\nSHT-R114\n\nSHT-R420\n\nSHT-R422\n\nSHT-R610\n\nSHT-R615\n\nSHT-R621\n\nSHT-R722\n\nSSP\n\nWhere does titanium dioxide come from?\n\nTitanium dioxide itself was officially first named and created in a laboratory in the late 1800s. It wasn’t mass manufactured until the early 20th century, when it started to take over as a safer alternative to other white pigments.\n\nThe element titanium and the compound TiO2 are found around the world, linked to other elements such as iron, in several kinds of rock and mineral sands (including a component of some beach sands). Titanium most commonly occurs as the mineral ilmenite (a titanium-iron oxide mineral) and sometimes as the mineral rutile, a form of TiO2. These inert molecular compounds must be separated through a chemical process to create pure titanium dioxide.\n\nHow is titanium dioxide extracted?\n\nHow pure titanium dioxide is extracted from titanium-containing molecules depends on the composition of the original mineral ores or feedstock. Two methods are used to manufacture pure TiO2: a sulphate process and a chloride process.\n\nThe principal natural source of titanium dioxide is mined ilmenite ore, which contains 45-60 percent TiO2. From this, or an enriched derivative (known as titanium slag), pure TiO2 can be produced using the sulphate or chloride process.\n\nSulphate and chloride methods\n\nOf the two methods of extraction, the sulphate process is currently the most popular method of producing TiO2 in the European Union, accounting for 70 percent of European sources. The remaining 30 percent is the result of the chloride process. On a global level, it is estimated about 40-45 percent of the world’s production is based on the chloride process.\n\nAs a widely used substance with multiple applications, research is being carried out to improve the production process to reduce the levels of chemicals used and waste produced, and to recycle any by-products.\n\nThe future of titanium dioxide\n\nFor a substance that is relatively unknown to the public, it’s amazing how many everyday products titanium dioxide can be found in. Because of its many varied properties, our skin, cities, cars, homes, food and environment are made brighter, safer, more resilient and cleaner by titanium dioxide. With a legacy of 100 years of safe commercial use, titanium dioxide is only going to become more vital as our environment faces greater challenges from a growing population.\n\nTypical Properties: Value\n\nTIO2 content,%: ≥91.5\n\nColor(compared with standard sample): no lower than\n\nTint Reducing Power(compared with standard sample): ≥100\n\nWater Soluble Object,%: ≤0.50\n\nVolatile at 105°C,g/100g: ≤0.50\n\nPH Value of Aqueou Suspension: 6.5-9.0\n\nOil Absorption,g/100g: ≤23.0\n\nMesh residue 45Um,%: ≤0.05\n\nResistivity,Ω·m: ≥50.0\n\nOther cations:\n\nZirconium dioxide\n\nHafnium dioxide\n\nRelated Titanium oxides Titanium(II) oxides:\n\nTitanium(III) oxide\n\nTitanium(III,IV) oxide\n\nRelated compounds:\n\nTitanic acid\n\nTitanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control me sures in place.\n\nThe human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer.\n\nThe safety of the use of nano-particle-sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized.\n\nStudies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice.\n\nThe mechanism by which TiO2 may cause cancer is unclear.\n\nMolecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to TiO2 results from the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment, independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways.\n\nThe body of research regarding the carcinogenicity of different particle sizes of titanium dioxide has led the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to recommend two separate exposure limits.\n\nNIOSH recommends that fine TiO2 particles be set at an exposure limit of 2.4 mg/m3, while ultrafine TiO2 be set at an exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m3, as time-weighted average concentrations up to 10 hours a day for a 40-hour work week.\n\nThese recommendations reflect the findings in the research literature that show smaller titanium dioxide particles are more likely to pose carcinogenic risk than the larger titanium dioxide particles.\n\nThere is some evidence the rare disease yellow nail syndrome may be caused by titanium, either implanted for medical reasons or through eating various foods containing titanium dioxide.\n\nNanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometres in diameter, yet most of the particles in food grade titanium dioxide are much larger.\n\nStill, size distribution analyses showed that batches of food-grade TiO₂ always comprise a nano-sized fraction as inevitable byproduct of the manufacturing processes."
