        "text": "What is E 171 additive?\n\nFood additive E 171 titanium dioxide is an inorganic, insoluble, white artificial colouring with very good stability to light, heat, oxidation and pH changes.\n\nSynonyms White pigment C16.\n\nThe rough formula is: TiO 2\n\nMolecular mass is M=79,88\n\nIts chemical name is titanium dioxide.\n\nIn nature it exists in the form of three crystalline modifications:\n\n– rutile,\n\n– anatas and\n\n– brookit.\n\nThe rutile and the anastasis have a quadratic lattice and the bookit has a rhombic lattice.[i]\n\nTitanium dioxide consists mainly of pure titanium dioxide in the form of anatase and/or rutile which may be coated with small amounts of alumina and/or silica to improve the technological properties of the product.\n\nHow is titanium dioxide obtained?\n\nTitanium dioxide can be obtained by cold or hot hydrolysis of TiCl solutions4 , which occurs in the presence of SO42- , PO43- ions or an excess of Cl– or NO3 ions, as well as by direct oxygen oxidation of TiCl4 in the vapour phase.\n\nIt can also be obtained by hot hydrolysis of titanium or TiO2 XH2 O sulphide solutions by dehydration and heating to 700o C (currently NaF, borate or barium phosphate as mineraliser).\n\nHydrated titanium dioxide, obtained by such methods, is transformed by calcination and subsequent treatment into the product used as pigment. It is presented as a white amorphous powder. It is insoluble in water, organic solvents and alkali hydroxides, but is readily soluble in hydrofluoric acid, hot concentrated sulphuric acid and in the melts of alkali hydroxides or carbonates.\n\nBy heating the TiO2 powder to 250-6000 C in an oxidizing atmosphere, a yellow-brown to greenish-brown coloration occurs, but disappears on cooling.\n\nAt temperatures above 29270 C it decomposes into T i2 O3 and O2 .\n\nTiO2 and O2 has a density of 3.6-3.95 g/cm3 for the anatase form and 4.1-4.4 g/cm3 for the brookite and rutile forms.\n\nMelts at 1855o C. The loss on drying of the additive at 1050 C for 3 hours is maximum 0,5% and on burning at 800 o C maximum 1% relative to the volatile-free product.1\n\nCertain rutile forms of titanium dioxide are produced using mica (also known as potassium aluminium silicate) as a template to form the basic granular structure. Mica is surface coated with titanium dioxide using a specialised patented process. Titanium dioxide rutile in granular form is manufactured by subjecting the pearlescent pigment consisting of mica coated with titanium dioxide (rutile) to an extractive dissolution in an acid medium followed by an extractive dissolution in alkali. By this process all mica is removed and the resulting product is a granular form of rutile titanium dioxide.[ii]\n\nWhich foods contain the food additive E 171?\n\nTitanium dioxide is used as a food colour (E171), its technological function is to make food more visually attractive, to give colour to otherwise colourless food or to restore the original appearance of food.\n\nFood colour E 171 is used in:\n\n– candy making,\n\n– matt white finish or as a base for other colours,\n\n– colouring of some cheeses,\n\n– chewing gum manufacture,\n\n– chocolate and ice cream making,\n\n– making creams, soups, sauces (for infants, young children and adolescents)\n\n– manufacture of bakery products, cakes or other pastry products,\n\n– manufacture of tomato paste type broth,\n\n– processed fish and fishery products, including molluscs and crustaceans,\n\n– unprocessed fish,\n\n– unprocessed molluscs and crustaceans,\n\n-production of fruit and vegetable preparations (except compotes),\n\n– manufacture of food supplements, etc.\n\nIt is available in both water- and oil-dispersible forms, as suspensions in water, glycerine, propylene glycol, glucose syrups, vegetable oils. [iii], [iv],[v]\n\nWhat else can E 171 be used for?\n\nE 171, titanium dioxide is approved as an ingredient in food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Titanium dioxide, which is not in nanoparticle form, is not absorbed on the skin. It acts as a physical UV protective barrier.\n\nIt increases the opacity of other pigments in make-up products and improves their adhesion to the skin. Reduces the transparency of cosmetic compositions.[vi]\n\nTitanium dioxide as a white pigment is used in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, adhesives, plastics, rubber, textiles, ceramics, white cement, roofing materials, white cement, floor coatings, paper and printing inks.\n\nUsed as white pigment it must have a high purity. Its opacity and brilliance come from its ability to scatter light. It is brighter than diamond. Only rutile and anatase have good pigmenting properties.\n\nIn the textile industry it is used in yarn guides so that the yarns slide smoothly during spinning.[vii]\n\nWhat are the characteristics of E171 titanium dioxide?\n\nThe table below shows the specifications set for titanium dioxide by Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\nTITANIUM DIOXIDE E 171 Composition Content not less than 99 % on the alumina- and silica-free matter Description White to slightly coloured powder Identification Solubility Insoluble in water and organic solvents. Solubility Dissolve slowly in hydrofluoric acid and hot concentrated sulphuric acid. Purity Loss on drying Not more than 0,5 % (105 °C, 3 hours) Loss on ignition Not more than 1 % on a volatile matter-free basis (800 °C) Aluminium oxide and/or silicon dioxide In total not more than 2.0%. Substances soluble in 0,5 N HCl Not more than 0,5 % on an alumina- and silica-free basis and, in addition, for products containing alumina and/or silica, not more than 1,5 % on the product as sold. Water-soluble substances Not more than 0,5 % Cadmium Cadmium Not more than 1 mg/kg after extraction with 0,5 N HCl Antimony Not more than 2 mg/kg after extraction with 0,5 N HCl. Arsen Not more than 1 mg/kg after extraction with 0,5 N HCl. Plumb Not more than 10 mg/kg after extraction with 0,5 N HCl Mercury Not more than 1 mg/kg after extraction with 0,5 N HCl\n\nAre there any side effects from consuming the food additive E 171?\n\nAfter conducting a review of all available relevant scientific evidence, EFSA concluded that a genotoxicity concern for TiO particles cannot be excluded2 . Based on this concern, EFSA experts no longer consider titanium dioxide safe when used as a food additive. This means that an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for E171 cannot be established.\n\nFrance was the first country in Europe to decide to suspend this additive.\n\nIn March 2021 the EFSA Panel concluded that although gastrointestinal absorption of TiO2 particles is low, they can accumulate in the body. General and organ toxicity studies showed no adverse effects with E 171 up to a dose of 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day, nor with TiO2 NPs (> 30 nm) up to the highest dose tested of 100 mg/kg body weight/day. No reproductive and developmental toxic effects were observed up to a dose of 1,000 mg E 171/kg body weight/day, the highest dose tested in the EOGRT study. Regarding genotoxicity, the group concluded that TiO2 particles have the potential to induce DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damage, but not genetic mutations. No clear correlation was observed between the physicochemical properties of TiO2 particles and the outcome of genotoxicity tests either in vitro or in vivo.\n\nA limit value for TiO2 particle size could not be identified for genotoxicity. No studies adequately designed to investigate the potential carcinogenic effects of TiO2 were available.\n\nEFSA’s assessment relates to the risks of TiO2 used as a food additive, not to other uses.\n\nA study on the oral systemic availability of the additive E 171 was conducted by Pele et al. (2015) on 8 volunteers (7 completed the study). Study participants ingested two capsules containing 50 mg of E 171 with 250 ml of water. Blood samples were taken at 0, 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 h after ingestion. Tea and coffee with milk and/or sugar were allowed from 2 hours after ingestion. Blood droplets were spread on a glass slide and protected from drying. Particles were detected by light microscopy at 100-fold magnification and then 400-fold magnification using a dark field condenser. This method could only be performed in samples from five of the seven subjects due to blood clotting in samples from two of the subjects. The degree of reflectance (0, 1, 2 and 3) was used as a semi-quantitative measurement of the number of TiO particles2 .\n\nThe total blood Ti concentration was measured. The authors observed that there are two absorption pathways for particles in the human intestine, one in the duodenum/jejunum and one in the colon. The highest blood Ti concentration determined in any study participant was approximately 11 ng/mL (at 6 hours). Thereafter, the blood Ti concentration decreased to about 5 ng/mL at 10 hours after administration. The researchers concluded that after oral administration of 100 mg E 171 to volunteers (humans) the blood Ti concentration and particle number increased, demonstrating the oral systemic availability of TiO2.[viii]\n\nConclusions and Legislative Regulations E 171\n\nTitanium dioxide (E 171) was originally authorised as a food additive in the EU under Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n\nThe safety of the food additive E 171 was re-evaluated by the EFSA Panel ANS in 2016 under Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 as part of the re-evaluation programme of food additives authorised in the EU before 20 January 2009.[ix]\n\nThe European Commission (EC) adopted on Friday, 14 January 2021, a ban on the use of titanium dioxide (E171) as a food additive.\n\nThe Commission proposal is based on a scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, which concluded that E 171 can no longer be considered safe when used as a food additive, in particular because concerns about genotoxicity cannot be excluded.\n\nThe ban on the use of E 171 will apply after a transitional period of six months. Therefore, from summer 2022, this additive should no longer be added to food.[x]\n\nAuthor: dr.ing.
