        "text": "Titanium Dioxide Market Size & Trends\n\nThe global titanium dioxide market size was estimated at USD 20.43 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2024 to 2030. Increasing investments in the chloride production processes and the flourishing construction industry worldwide are anticipated to contribute to the growth of the market for titanium dioxide (TiO2)in the coming years. TiO2 is widely used in paints & coatings applications. TiO2 combined with other colored pigments is employed in numerous end-use applications, including automotive coatings, aircraft coating, marine coatings, and architecture & decorative coatings. Growing construction activities are positively influencing the demand for paints & coatings, thereby creating significant demand for TiO2.\n\nTiO2 is used in various applications such as plastics, cosmetics, pulp & paper, paints & coatings, and others. Rising demand for the product in the plastics industry is anticipated to fuel the market growth over the forecast period. TiO2 is used in various plastics such as polyolefins, polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyvinyl chloride, and others. Properties such as UV damage resistance, color retention, gloss, brightness, mechanical strength, and others are propelling the demand for the product in plastic applications.\n\nThe prices of TiO2 are expected to increase over the forecasted period on account of higher raw material prices, stringent regulations, and production process complexity. Even though various manufacturers are undertaking strategic initiatives to tackle the rise in the raw material prices, this factor is expected to impact the overall prices of TiO2 in the long run. As a result, various manufacturers are also increasing prices of TiO2.\n\nFor Instance, in March 2023, LB Group, one of the leading manufacturers of TiO2 from China, have announced price increase for all grades of their TiO2 products for international and domestic markets. According to the company, this upshift in prices is mainly due to tight supplies as well as boost in the procurement from downstream paints & coatings sector.\n\nTiO2 has wide application scope and is used in numerous end-user applications. However, various regulations on the use of the product are expected to restrain the market growth. Dust particles of the product are grouped under 2B carcinogenic by IRAC and have the possibility of being carcinogenic to humans. In manufacturing plants, various protective measures are to be followed by workers including the use of personal protective equipment and safety data sheets for material handling.\n\nMarket Concentration & Characteristics\n\nThe global product market is moderately fragmented with players aim to achieve optimum business growth and strong market positioning through production capacity expansions, new product development, research & development. For instance, in 2021, LB Group announced to promote its wide range of TiO2 pigments for plastics in Chinaplas. This is expected to strengthen their position in the Chinese market for supply of TiO2 pigments in plastic applications.\n\nPartnerships, acquisitions & mergers, expansions, and new product developments are the key strategies adopted by most players operating in the global product market. For instance, in July 2023, Chemours, a global chemistry company, announced the closure of its titanium dioxide plant in Taiwan. The decision to close the plant is part of a comprehensive strategy to improve the earnings quality of Chemours' Titanium Technologies (TT) segment, which produces the popular Ti-Pure brand of titanium dioxide.\n\nLarge manufacturers like The Chemours Company, The Tronox Holdings Plc., LB Group, Venator Materials Plc., Evonik Industries AG aim to strengthen their market position by widening their customer base. They also focus on new product launches and merger and acquisition to meet the current as well as future demand from end use industries. For instance, in 2022, the Chemours Company begun mining at its newest sand mine in Florida, increasing the company's output of TiO2. Ilmenite, which Chemours needs for their chloride based TiO2 production method, will be obtained from the mining.\n\nGrade Insights\n\nRutile grade dominated the market with a revenue share of 76.4% in 2023 owing high weathering properties in compared to anatase. At higher temperature conditions, anatase TiO2 converts to rutile TiO2, having higher weatherability and hiding power in comparison to its other counterparts and making it suitable for the manufacturing of indoor & outdoor coatings, inks, plastics, and paper.\n\nThe rutile grade of TiO2 is used to manufacture refractory ceramics, titanium oxide pigments, and the production of titanium metal. Furthermore, it is used as a carrier in paint applications, produces white color in plastics, and provides color fading in paper and other products. In recent years, the rising construction industry is anticipated to fuel the demand for paints & coatings, along with paper applications such as wallpapers and sanitary products. This is in turn expected to increase the demand for rutile grade of TiO2 during the forecast period.\n\nAnatase (TiO2) pigment is mainly used in fibers, ceramics, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, along with manufacturing of enamels and welding electrodes. Pure TiO2 contains 80% content of anatase by weight with a smaller portion of rutile, 20%. Increasing demand for TiO2-based cosmetics is anticipated to propel the demand for anatase TiO2 during the forecast period.\n\nCarrier Production Process Insights\n\nSulfate carrier production process dominated the market with a revenue share of 78.0% in 2023. Iodine powder is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to produce titanyl sulfate and is further hydrolyzed for the formation of metatitanic acid and is then calcined and pulverized to obtain whiter Titanium power. In addition, this method is used to produce anatase and rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2). In the sulfate process of producing tit TiO2, ilmenite (FeTiO3), a common iron/titanium oxide, is used by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and titanium oxygen sulfate (TiOSO4) is selectively extracted and converted into TiO2.\n\nTitanium containing raw materials are used in the chloride process which is treated with chlorinated high-titanium slag or artificial rutile, or natural rutile to form titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). TiCl4 is further purified by rectification and is then subjected to gas phase oxidation, post rapid cooling and TiO2 is obtained.\n\nApplication Insights\n\nPaints & Coatings dominated the market with a revenue share of 44.2% in 2023 owing to its extensively application of white pigment TiO2 in the paint and coatings sector. When used in coatings, it’s highly effective visible light scattering properties add whiteness, brightness, and opacity. Due to their superior stability and durability compared to their competitors, rutile TiO2 pigments are highly preferred due to their great light scattering.\n\nThese inorganic surface treatments enhance one or more crucial coating performance characteristics, such as the coatings’ ability to disperse in water and a variety of organic liquids, their effectiveness as concealing agents, their resistance to chalk, and their resistance to color fading brought on by heat and photoreduction. Paint films are opaqued by TiO2 and other white pigments predominantly through diffuse light reflection. Strong light scattering caused by exposure to the white pigment surface results in this reflection.\n\nTiO2 is widely used in various industries, including the ink industry. It is a white pigment that provides opacity, brightness, and whiteness to inks. The quality of TiO2 used in inks has a significant impact on the performance and properties of the ink. TiO2 is considered a crucial component in the creation of white and light-colored inks. It is used in various types of inks, including offset, flexographic, gravure, and screen printing inks, as well as other liquid and solid ink systems.\n\nTalc, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and calcined kaolin are frequently used in low-end paper because of their low production costs. In comparison to the materials, TiO2 provides higher whiteness, high density, reflective index, fine, and uniform particles. Hence paper treated with titanium dioxide (TiO2) has enhanced whiteness stronger hiding power, and high strength. Furthermore, the opacity of paper using TiO2 is 10 times higher than that of other materials, and the weight can be reduced by 15% to 30%.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nThe construction industry in North America is expected to witness significant growth over the coming years, owing to the high demand for non-residential construction projects, such as hospitals, commercial buildings, and colleges.
