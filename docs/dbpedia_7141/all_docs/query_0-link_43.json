However, it’s in our manufacturing process where we really stand out.\n\nManufacturing in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, Canada\n\nRio Tinto’s ilmenite mine at Havre St. Pierre, Quebec is renowned for the purity and consistency of its large ilmenite ore body. We treat the ore from this mine at our Sorel-Tracy smelter to produce two products:\n\nTitanium dioxide, for the pigment industry\n\nHigh purity iron (HPI)\n\nThe HPI produced from this process is very high quality. We use this HPI in our ferrous powders. Rio Tinto Metal Powders is the only world-class, fully integrated powder manufacturer (from virgin ore to finished powder).\n\nLearn more\n\nManufacturing in Suzhou, China\n\nQMP started powder manufacturing in Suzhou, China in May 2005. This site includes our FLOMET blending plant, an administration office, a product warehouse, and a customer technical service laboratory. In 2014, we expanded the Suzhou facility with the addition of a new, 8000mt per year metal powders annealing plant, as well as increased laboratory space and technical capabilities.\n\nLearn more"
