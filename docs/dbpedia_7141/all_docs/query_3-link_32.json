        "text": "What is Titanium dioxide (TiO2)?\n\nTitanium dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula TiO2.\n\nTitanium dioxide is composed of a barium cation and a sulfate anion. The sulfur is attached to four oxygen atoms. TiO2 is a sulfate salt of barium and is found as the mineral barite. It is a crystalline solid white in colour which is insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in concentrated acids. It is odourless.\n\nTitanium dioxide is an alkaline, divalent metal. It is non-toxic and safe for medical use. It is widely used in the production of oil and natural gas to get high-density drilling fluids by keeping the boreholes free of rock.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProperties of Titanium Dioxide\n\nStructure of Titanium dioxide (TiO2)\n\nUses of TiO2\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nProperties of Titanium Dioxide\n\nTiO2 Titanium dioxide Molecular Weight/ Molar Mass 233.38 g/mol Density 4.5 g/cm³ Boiling Point 1,600 °C Melting Point 1,580 °C\n\nStructure of Titanium dioxide (TiO2)\n\nUses of TiO2\n\nIt is used in the casting of copper anode plates as a coating material.\n\nIt is used as a radiopaque agent.\n\nIt is used as a component in oil well drilling fluids.\n\nIt is used to increase the density of the polymer by acting as a filler for plastics.\n\nUsed to test the pH of the soil.\n\nUsed as a filler or to modify the consistency in oil paints.\n\nIt is used in imaging of the GI tract during barium meal.\n\nUsed to diagnose certain disorders of the intestines, stomach, or oesophagus.\n\nIt is used in the manufacturing of alloys.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ1\n\nWhat is titanium dioxide used for?\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is a naturally occurring mineral used as a bright white pigment for painting, as a colouring in the food industry, in sunscreens and cosmetics, and in many industrial applications.\n\nQ2\n\nWhy is titanium dioxide used in toothpaste?\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used to enhance the colour and brightness of food items in white. TiO2 is also used in other products including toothpaste as a white pigment. Recent experiments with TiO2 show that these particles have the ability to have toxic effects.\n\nQ3\n\nIs titanium dioxide an oxidizing agent?\n\nAdvanced Oxidation Process is an emerging technology for water purification which makes use of different oxidising agents and titanium dioxide is one among them.\n\nQ4\n\nWhat type of bond is present in titanium dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide has the formula TiO2. Titanium is a transition metal and oxygen is a non-metal. Studies have reported, Ti-O bond has both ionic and covalent character.\n\nQ5\n\nWhat are the safety concerns to be taken during the usage of titanium dioxide?\n\nTitanium dioxide is not harmful. But nanoparticles of this are reported as ‘ can be carcinogenic’. In the dusty titanium oxide environments, it caused impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer among rats which could be similar in humans also.\n\nLearn more about the Structure, physical and chemical properties of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) from the experts at BYJU’S.\n\nTest Your Knowledge On Titanium Dioxide!\n\nQ5\n\nPut your understanding of this concept to test by answering a few MCQs.
