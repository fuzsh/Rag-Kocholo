        "text": "This page is about the train operator from April 2022. For previous operators, see ScotRail (brand).\n\nQuick facts for kids\n\nScotRail Rèile na h-Alba\n\nTwo ScotRail Class 43 (HST) Inter7City trains at Pitlochry\n\nOverview Franchise(s) ScotRail Main region(s) Scotland Parent company Scottish Rail Holdings Reporting mark SR Dates of operation 1 April 2022–present Predecessor Abellio ScotRail\n\nRoute map\n\nScotRail Trains Limited, trading as ScotRail (Scottish Gaelic: Rèile na h-Alba), is a Scottish train operating company that is publicly owned by Scottish Rail Holdings on behalf of the Scottish Government. It has been operating the ScotRail franchise as an operator of last resort since 1 April 2022.\n\nHistory\n\nThe ScotRail network had since 2015 been operated by the private-sector franchisee Abellio ScotRail. In December 2019, Transport Scotland announced Abellio had not met the performance criteria necessary to have its seven-year franchise extended for a further three years, and the franchise would conclude on 31 March 2022.\n\nIn March 2021, Transport Scotland announced that the franchise would not be re-tendered for another private-sector operator to run, but would be operated by an operator of last resort owned by the Scottish Government. The move was welcomed by the ASLEF, RMT and TSSA unions.\n\nThe Minister for Transport, Jenny Gilruth, confirmed in February 2022 that ScotRail services would return to public ownership. She invited key stakeholders to take part in a discussion on the future of the service, saying \"I can confirm that the transition of ScotRail into Scottish Government control will take place on 1 April 2022. Whilst that’s good news, it’s clear that much work still needs to be done... I want to kick-start a National Conversation about what our new beginning for ScotRail should look like - an affordable, sustainable, customer focused rail passenger service in Scotland in a post pandemic world.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives Transport Spokesman, Graham Simpson, criticised the planned consultation, saying that it \"should be about lower fares, restoring services and stopping cuts to ticket offices - measures that will encourage people to use public transport.\" The Scottish Liberal Democrats added that discussions should have started two years earlier, when nationalisation was decided.\n\nOn 4 April 2022, on-board catering started to be reintroduced on ScotRail services. It had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn May 2022, ASLEF balloted its members for strike action, with drivers refusing to work overtime. In May 2022, many Sunday services were cancelled due to driver shortages. ScotRail stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented them from training an estimated 130 drivers. On 1 June 2022, ASLEF announced that it had rejected an improved pay offer from ScotRail.\n\nA temporary timetable was brought in on 23 May 2022. The number of daily services was cut by around one-third, from approximately 2,150 to 1,456. Many early morning and late night services were cancelled. In June 2022, ASLEF recommended its members accept a revised offer. Services between Wick and Inverness on the Far North Line were cut from four trains each way per day to two. Stagecoach Highlands are expected to introduce an additional bus service on the route starting 6 June 2022.\n\nServices\n\nScotRail Trains took over all of the services operated by Abellio. As of December 2023 , off-peak services delivered by ScotRail Monday to Friday are as follows:\n\nCentral Belt\n\nArgyle Line Route tph Calling at Dalmuir to Larkhall 2\n\nSinger, Drumry, Drumchapel,

The £55 million first phase, to electrify 104 km (65 mi) of Fife Circle track, between Haymarket and Dalmeny, for use by battery electric multiple units, was begun by Scottish Powerlines in June 2022 and is due to be completed by December 2024. Further phases will electrify the lines between Kinghorn, Thornton, Ladybank and Lochgelly.\n\nStations\n\nAs of March 2022 , ScotRail operates 355 stations in Scotland. Not included are Prestwick International Airport station, owned and operated by the airport, as well as both Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central, which are managed by Network Rail. ScotRail operates Lockerbie and Reston even though no ScotRail services currently call at either station.\n\nDepots"
