        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis line is closed, save for sections between Neilston and Cathcart (used by electric passenger trains), Cathcart and Newton (used by electric passenger trains and diverted trains), a siding north of Lugton (occasionally used by fertiliser freight trains), Lugton to RNAD Beith (used to deliver Government supplies to and from the site; the line has not been used for some time) and sidings at Stevenston (for the Stevenston and Ardeer works; these sidings are now out of use). Much of the closed length of the line remains walkable. A pipeline has been laid buried in the trackbed at Uplawmoor [1st]. Many of the works associated with the line were built in concrete and remain intact. The line was a protege of the Caledonian Railway and was intended to compete with the existing Glasgow and South Western Railway services on the parallel former Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway.\n\nWhy built\n\nInitially the locally promoted Barrmill and Kilwinning Railway was to be a link between existing lines; the Glasgow and South Western Railway's Ardrossan-Glasgow line and the jointly owned Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway.\n\nWith Caledonian Railway backing its intent expanded to include an independent route from the port at Ardrossan through to the Lanarkshire coalfield, iron works and steel works. In addition the steamer trade from Ardrossan to Arran would be pursued.\n\nIron ore began to be imported in quantity from Spain in the 1870s as local supplies were either worked out or unable to supply the increasing number of works. This line would put ownership of the route from Lanarkshire to Ayrshire under single ownership. It started to be eclipsed with the opening of the Rothesay Dock Branch (North British Railway and Caledonian Railway) in 1907.\n\nThe Caledonian, through its subsiduary the Caledonian Steam Packet Company, operated steamers from Ardrossan to Arran's piers.\n\nDespite being run down increasingly from the 1920s the line was busy with night time ambulance trains from Ardrossan to Glasgow and explosives traffic (there were several sites served) during the Second World War.\n\nService\n\nThere are two passenger services. Electric trains run to Neilston from Glasgow Central (High Level) via Queens Park.
