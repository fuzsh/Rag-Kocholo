        "meta_description": "1 review and 5 photos of PATTERTON TRAIN STATION \"Ohhhh Patterton. What a sad train station. It's barely even a station, and more of an lonely, desolate area with two platforms, a bridge and one small shelter for those \"rare\" Scottish days of bad weather. This is my local station though, and needs must. \n\nI like that trains seem to arrive on time and if the driver sees you running for the train, they'll (mostly) wait for you. I've had some great times standing at this platform, most notably in the snow in negative temperatures and then tramping back home again as the train was a no-show.   \n\nThere's now an extra car park in addition to the one at the station, it's over the road and has a stupidly located exit so you have to go back on yourself to get out and over to the station. Nothing like a mad dash to run for the train first thing in the morning. \n\nII'd love it if they upgraded Patterton to make it more like its glamorous neighbour, Whitecraigs. Now this is a fancy station - they even have flower planter boxes and an indoor waiting area. Alas, I don't think that's going to happen any time soon.\"",
