        "text": "Something different indeed! Very interesting and the pics from the last two trips are great\n\nOh, and that Travelodge sounds properly grim... I thought they were all up to a certain standard at least...\n\nThanks.\n\nI believe Travelodge have managed to offload their Maypole branch.\n\nBest Western seem to have taken it over.\n\nAnyway, on with the show.\n\n45135 and I have just had a couple of days in Scotland and here is the gist of it.\n\nThe main idea behind this move (one we’ve been wanting to do for several years but have never got round to for one reason or another) was to get some loco haulage in, namely the Fife Circle turns and the Fort William sleeper.\n\nWhen it was first discussed I needed 67011 and 45135 needed 67007 & 67009, so we hoped some or all of them could be roped in.\n\nOf course, the Fife’s are now 68s, so that meant only one 67.\n\nI’d cleared the 67s earlier this year so the Fort William would definitely be dud for me, but we had our fingers crossed that one of 45135’s requirements would work the train.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nUnlike me, 45135 had family commitments to put first, so an early departure from West Yorkshire was out and my usual 5am start to the drive was put back a bit.\n\nI picked him up at 09.00 and we headed North.\n\nTo fill the day before heading up for the sleeper we had decided to do some Cathcart Circle bashing.\n\nThis was because I needed 314207 to clear the class and 45135, who doesn’t do units as such, doesn’t mind getting new lines and stations in and likes to get photos at new locations.\n\nI had done a bit of research beforehand and thought that Whitecraigs looked like a good place to park up.\n\nAs is often the case my research was less than perfect and the car park was full when we arrived at 13.30.\n\nThere was, however, some on street parking available just round the corner, so no great drama.\n\nWe purchased our Strathclyde Roundabouts a few minutes before the ticket office closed at 14.00.\n\n45135 hadn’t done any of the Cathcart Circle before, including, obviously, the Neilston line and so we decided the right thing to do would be to leap aboard the first thing to Neilston, just so he didn’t have a small gap in his coverage\n\n314205 was the first unit of the move and we did this from Whitecraigs to Neilston and then back as far Cathcart.\n\nWhilst he cares not a jot about individual vehicles, I like to get all the ones in from a set and so this run gave me the opportunity to clear 314205.\n\nNext up was a clockwise run from Cathcart to Glasgow Central on 314211.\n\nThis was followed by a run on my second choice 314, 314202 – a unit that was unrequired but I’d had it so long ago that I had no record of doing it, so I was pleased with that.\n\nWe did this to Crosshill and then came back as far as Pollokshaws East on 314215.\n\nWe spent a bit of time there getting a few photos and then caught the same unit to Mount Florida.\n\n314210 was then taken into Central before we headed out to Cathcart on 314202.\n\nThis meant that 45135 had now cleared the full circle\n\nThe original idea had been to do the pair on the 17.17 Glasgow – Neilston back to Whitecraigs and then drive to our B & B.\n\nThis plan had been changed because we had viewed 314207 heading up to Neilston and so a new plan had been formulated.\n\nWe didn’t have lot of time as we had the sleeper on our agenda, but a short run on the winner could be got and so we did 314210 to Muirend.\n\n314207 was taken to Mount Florida.\n\nYippee, my last one arrives:\n\nEMU 314207_2015.05.21_1_Muirend by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nAt the start of 2015 I needed 14 of the 16 314s, now I’d cleared them (in fact I’ve had all 16 this year!).\n\nNice one\n\nFrom Mount Florida it was back to Whitecraigs and the car on 314209.\n\nOur B & B overlooked Loch Long at Arrochar and we made it there and checked in around 19.00, plenty of time to drive the mile or so to Arrochar & Tarbert station.\n\nI was quite surprised to find that I needed this station, given all the times I’ve been up and down the West Highland Line, but I suppose it was never a convenient changing point.\n\nI needed three Scotrail 156s so I was pleased when one of those, 156492 was the leading unit on the service to Oban and Mallaig.\n\nNaturally this was where we sat.\n\n156492 was the unit that was going to Oban and we were heading for Bridge Of Orchy, so at Crianlarich we bailed and boarded the rear unit, already cleared 156476, that was heading to Mallaig.\n\nRaining in Crianlarich? Never:\n\nDMU 156492_2015.05.21_2_Crianlarich by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nAt Bridge of Orchy we had about forty minutes to kill and so we walked down to the “Bridge Of Orchy Hotel”.\n\nThis had changed somewhat in the 15 years since we were last in there!\n\nWe had a drink and then made our way back to the station and after a short wait, what should appear on the front of the sleeper?\n\nIt was only blinking 67011.\n\nIt took me nearly 15 years to score it and now I’d had it twice in two months.\n\nStill, it’s all mileage and 45135 consoled himself with the fact that he hadn’t had it for many years and his mileage was low.\n\nAfter reaching Arrochar & Tarbert it was back to the B & B and straight to the land of nod.\n\nThe next morning we enjoyed a full Scottish breakfast before driving to Cumbernauld.\n\nToday we planned to cover the Fife’s, but we had a couple of things to do around Glasgow first.\n\nAs yesterday, we bought a Strathclyde Roundabout.\n\n334006 was taken to Partick and then it was down to the Subway for a run on the “Clockwork Orange” as no one actually calls it.\n\nI had done this system once before, in 2006, but 45135 hadn’t and fancied it.\n\nCar 109 was taken to St Enoch (chosen because it was about half way round and we liked the name) and then 114 for the rest of the loop back to Partick.\n\nA full circuit in one direction was enough for us and so it was back upstairs.\n\n318255 was then taken to Central.\n\nNext up was some 156 thrash, first up was 156433, which we took to Crossmyloof and this was followed by 156435 one stop to Pollokshaws West, meaning that I've now cleared my Polloks\n\n156467 was then taken back to Central.\n\nWe were now thinking of heading over to Edinburgh and had a few possibilities to get us back to Cumbernauld.\n\nOur first choice was to get the 13.22 Falkirk Grahamston service from Queen Street.\n\nWe had a bit of time so worked out we could do it by going via Partick, getting a couple of EMUs in as against the walk across Glasgow.\n\nWe now headed back down to the low level platforms.\n\nA winning 320, 320301, was stood in and we could have made it, but we were momentarily disorientated and by the time we worked out it was the train we needed, the doors closed and it was off.\n\nOh well, maybe next time.\n\nWe could still make the 13.22 by going via Partick on the next service but elected to get back to the car a different way instead.\n\n318263 was taken to Whifflet and 318264 (not a winner, but it was on my second choice list) from there to Cumbernauld.\n\nWe drove over to Ingliston Park & Ride at Edinburgh, just outside the airport, and purchased a tram day ticket.\n\nBy now the effects of our full breakfast were wearing off and so we had decided to visit “Jimmy Chungs” all you can eat Chinese buffet just outside Waverley.\n\nI have been on the Edinburgh tram system before, but never further in than Haymarket, so we were unsure where to bail.\n\nWe did 268 from Ingliston and got off at Princes Street.\n\nThis wasn’t the stop we should have chosen but it wasn’t too far from the restaurant and before long we were tucking in to a mountain of food.\n\n“Jimmy Chung” probably spent that night looking at his books and sobbing, given the amount we managed to put away\n\nAfter that we waddled down to the station and purchased our next set of tickets.\n\nWe still had a bit of time before the 17.08, so we walked up to the tram stop we should have arived at, St Andrew Square, and did 253 to York Place and back, just to make sure we could clear the whole system (apart from the bit from Ingliston to the Airport and that will remain required as long as they insist on charging five quid extra to go there).\n\nObviously, at this time we still needed the bit between Princes Street and St Andrew Square, but we intended to clear that after the 68s.\n\nWe strolled down to platform and watched the first 68, 68002, arrive.\n\nThis is the turn that does the full circle and so we rejected it as we were going for maximum mileage from both locos.\n\nA few minutes after 002 left, Scotrail liveried 68007 pulled in on the 17.20 to Cardenden.\n\nA genuine Scottish monster:\n\n68007_2015.05.22_1_Edinburgh by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nSome front coach thrash was then enjoyed through to Dunfermline Town\n\nWhat a beast\n\nI’m really taking to 68s and 68007 gave me the best entertainment of the move and is officially my favourite member of the class\n\nThe train was running a couple of minutes late and we had to get over to the other platform at Dunfermline pretty sharpish.\n\n170461 was taken for the fairly short run back to Inverkeithing, where we bailed to await the next loco.\n\nAfter a wait of about half an hour, 68002 arrived and we took that back to Waverley.\n\n68002 was entertaining, but it certainly wasn’t as loud as 68007.\n\nI can't think of a caption:\n\n68002_2015.05.22_07_Edinburgh by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nOnce back at Edinburgh we walked up to St Andrew Square and caught tram 265 back to Ingliston, getting the missing bit of line in on the way.\n\nSunset on our move, tram 265 on the last, expensive, leg to Edinburgh Airport:\n\nEdinburgh Tram 265_2015.05.22_3_Ingliston by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nFrom there it was a fairly smooth drive home, I dropped 45135 off at around half past midnight and arrived home 20 minutes or so later, very tired but happy.\n\nBeing much more conscientious in her work than I am, Mrs 55013 occasionally announces that she has a few jobs to catch up on at the weekend and this usually means a window of opportunity is opened for me to get out on the trains.\n\nSaturday was one such occasion.\n\nMoves such as these are extra to ones that I’ve already arranged and so it’s only fair that I ensure I’m back at a mutually agreed time, in this case 5pm.\n\nThis, of course, limits me to things that are fairly local.\n\nNo problem, I’ll go to Manchester and see if I can get a run or two on the 319s\n\nI started from Bradford by covering the 08.00 service to Huddersfield.\n\nI cover this because it frequently drops a 142 and I was hoping a required coach might be on offer (I need 11 individual Northern 142 coaches for a ride on).\n\nSadly, today it was 144017, but I did it to Halifax anyway as it was either that or spend another quarter of an hour on the platform at Interchange.\n\n144017 at Halifax:\n\nDMU 144017_2015.06.06_Halifax by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nI’m glad I did the 144, as my next train; from Halifax to Todmorden, which was the following service from Bradford, was 158757.\n\nWhat’s wrong with 158757? I hear you cry.\n\nNothing, per se, but this was my THIRTEENTH run on it THIS YEAR!\n\nI make it the 24th week of the year, meaning that I’ve been getting 158757 more than once a fortnight on average.\n\nI bailed at Todmorden as this is where my m-card limit is and also because it gave me a few minutes before the Clitheroe to Manchester service arrived, which I hoped would produce a 156.\n\nCertainly, before the timetable change, when the services were Todmorden terminators I had observed 156s stood on the curve waiting to work the next train.\n\nI purchased a Manchester return and then boarded the aforementioned service ex-Clitheroe.\n\nNot a 156 but 150271.\n\nMy plan was to view the first Liverpool service then go and buy my Wayfarer.\n\nI’ve not had a 319 since they came to Northern but I have had few in their Thameslink days, so a winner was not a foregone conclusion.\n\nBah.\n\nThe unit for the 10.02 was 319367, one of the handful I’ve had a good run on in the past.\n\nAfter buying my ticket I had a change of plan.\n\nI observed that the Metrolink platforms at Victoria had re-opened and so I strolled across to there.\n\nWhilst waiting for my tram there was a disturbing incident.\n\nThere were a lot of staff on the platform, I thought at the time that this was because the platforms had just re-opened and they were there to assist punters.\n\nI was wrong on that, but either way it’s lucky they were there.\n\nA double unit arrived heading towards Bury, from the rear set a man got off pulling a pram.\n\nThen the doors shut, with the pram only half way out.\n\nThe platform staff were faultless and responded rapidly, shouting “Open the doors, open the doors”.\n\nThe doors duly opened, the pram was taken off and then they shut again.\n\nThe only problem now was that there were still people wanting to get off, including the child’s mother (presumably).\n\nThe tram started to move, with staff running alongside, waving their arms, shouting “Stop the tram, whoah, whoah”.\n\nNo avail, the tram shot out of the station and was gone.\n\nMy tram had arrived by this time and the last thing I saw, other than the mother staring forlornly out of the door with her palms on the glass, was a platform bloke shouting frantically into his radio.\n\nIt is a little worrying that there appears to be no proper system in place to prevent incidents like this when there are two trams running together and the driver seems to have no way of knowing what’s happening with the second unit.\n\nIn this case nobody was hurt and the worse that happened was some folk had to do a round trip to the first stop.\n\nHowever, it would have been all the same if it had been somebody caught in the door by their clothes or bags.\n\nAnyway, my tram was 3039 and I did this to Market Street followed by a short stroll over to Piccadilly Gardens and double set 3021 and 3059 all the way to Piccadilly.\n\nTram 3059 after reaching its destination:\n\nManchester Tram 3059_2015.06.06_Manchester Piccadilly by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nI got there just a few minutes before a 319 was due and so I made my way over to platform 13.\n\nShortly before the 319 arrived, a pair of Trans-Pennine hire in 156s were due and I observed them as being cleared 156420 and Heaton beast 156463.\n\nI don’t need any Northern 156s but there are a number that were had so long ago that I have no record of when or where I had them.\n\n156463 fell into this category and so I had a quick look on RTT and a plan was formulated.\n\nDud 319386 arrived and I did this to the airport before piling round for 156463.\n\n319386 at Manchester Airport:\n\nEMU 319386_2015.06.06_5_Manchester Airport by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nI sat in 57463 from the airport to Piccadilly and then moved to 52463 for the short hop to Oxford Road, just to clear the unit\n\nOnce there I didn’t have too long to wait for the next 319, at last it was a winning one.\n\n319362 was taken back to Manchester Airport and I now had a choice of units.\n\nThere were no 156s this time but there was a winning 185 on a Middlesborough service and so that’s where I headed.\n\nI took 185136 back to Picc and, as this went into platform 1, I started to mooch round to platform 13 for the next EMU.\n\nSomething caught my eye.\n\nThe next Chester departure was formed of 150142 and 150141.\n\nThis was of interest to me as, when I had recently been perusing my haulage details, it had come to my attention that, despite having Northern 150/1s regularly on my way to work, 150142 was in a frankly pathetic situation.\n\nI had one recorded run on it, way back in 2002, and that was a mega mileage downhill move from Wakefield Westgate to Kirkgate.\n\nSince realising that, the unit has been a bit of a bugbear and now it was right in front of me.\n\nEven though it meant missing the third of the Airport 319s it just had to be done for a bit of a decent run.\n\nI duly took the pair of 150s, sat in 52142 which also meant I cleared the unit, to Stockport.\n\nI decided that I wasn’t going to hang around awaiting a winner at Stockport but was going to head straight back to cover the next pair of TPE hire-ins.\n\nLuckily, the first train was a winner anyway, 390134.\n\nThe 156s on the ex- Blackpool service were, once again, a perfect pairing.\n\nCleared 156452 was on the rear and “second choice” 156428 was on the front.\n\nI did 52428 to the airport, got a couple of shots of 319386 arriving and then headed back to Piccadilly in 57428.\n\nAnother one cleared:\n\nDMU 156428_2015.06.06_2_Manchester Piccadilly by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nNow it was time to think about heading home.\n\nI still wanted the 3rd 319 and so I had worked out a move to get it in.\n\nI did unrequired for the day 319386 from Piccadilly to Newton-le-Willows and after a short wait 319368 appeared to take me back.\n\n319368 arriving at Newton-le-Willows:\n\nEMU 319368_2015.06.06_4_Newton-le-Willows by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nOne thing that I hadn’t realised before I went was that the “Parklife” festival was on in Manchester over the weekend, this meant that the city centre was heaving.\n\nI had no idea where this event was taking place so I was mortified when I walked onto the Metrolink platform to be faced with a cast of thousands awaiting the next tram (The festival, it turns out, is in Prestwich).\n\nLike any sensible person wanting to get to Victoria I turned right around and set off walking.\n\nNow I knew why there were so many staff at Victoria in the morning!\n\nMy arrival at Vic coincided with that of “Tour-De-France” liveried 158849 which was forming the next service to Leeds via Bradford.\n\nI jumped aboard, happy that the festival wasn’t taking place in Rochdale, and was on my way a few minutes later.\n\nArrival back at Interchange was at 16.46 and I walked through the door at home bang on 17.00.\n\nA nice bonus move in the bag\n\nWhen I did my impromptu move to the West Midlands last month I mentioned in my write up that there was a planned move coming up with me and a couple of mates.\n\nWell, Friday the 19th of June was the day in question and here’s the report.\n\nMr 45135 picked me up first and then we headed over to Huddersfield to collect the third member of our group before the long, painful, drive along the M1, through 50 miles of roadworks at 20mph.\n\nThat’s what it seems like, anyway.\n\nWe made it to Solihull about 20 minutes before the loco on the 10.55 ex Moor Street was due, plenty of time to purchase our Daytripper with Leamington add-ons.\n\nDuring my previous visit I had done 68010 and 68013, so I was hoping neither of these would be out.\n\nI had seen that 68010 had been working the Banbury’s, so thought it probably wouldn’t feature today.\n\n68013 however had been out on the Birmingham services, along with sisters 68011, 68012 and 68014.\n\nWe planned on covering three of the four diagrams and so my fingers were crossed.\n\nI uncrossed them when our first train arrived, pushed by 68013.\n\nBah.\n\n“It’s dud” I said, for the first time with a 68.\n\nA winner for my travelling companions, though.\n\nNever mind.\n\nWinners are nice but I enjoy a good run on an unrequired loco nearly as much.\n\nWe bailed at Leamington Spa a few minutes late, although we did get there before the next loco arrived heading North.\n\nWe decided to take our time rather than legging it over for the Northbound service as we knew the next one wasn’t too far behind it and there were a couple of freights due through that needed photographing.\n\nRequired 68011 was the loco we had rejected, but barring a failure we should get it later on.\n\nAfter getting some shots of 68013 we mooched down to the South end of the platform and photted 66741 going North, followed by 70019 on a Southbound Intermodal.\n\nThis was a good one as it was my 20th and final Freightliner 70.\n\nNice\n\nI didn't know it was my required one at this point:\n\n70019_2015.06.19_2_Leamington Spa by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nAfter a short wait I managed to bag my first winner of the day, 68014 and this was enjoyed to Moor Street were we crossed straight over on to 68011\n\nWe did this to Leamington and then we had a bit of time to kill so we took 168113 to Warwick, a winning station for the other two, but not for me.\n\nThe plan was to return to Leamington on a Chiltern unit which gave us a plus seven for 68013 coming back.\n\nSadly, after a stroll through the underpass, we discovered that the unit was twelve late.\n\n68013 wasn’t booked to stop at Warwick so we had to think about what to do.\n\nIt was back through the underpass and 168108 for a short hop to Warwick Parkway.\n\n168108 leaving Parkway:\n\nDMU 168108_2015.06.19_2_Warwick Parkway by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nOur decision to not risk what had become a minus 5 at Leamington was vindicated when 68013 arrived more or less on time.\n\nThe loss of 3 miles or so of 68 haulage wasn’t too painful and we thoroughly enjoyed the run back to Birmingham.\n\n68013 now had a bit of a fester at Moor Street and so it was back to killing time.\n\nWe caught 172331 and 172220 to Jewellery Quarter, climbed the mountainous stairs and went outside to see the view.\n\nThe most outstanding thing was a 19th Century grade 2 listed urinal just outside the station entrance!\n\nAfter marvelling at this wonder of the Victorian age we headed back down to the platforms.\n\nWe spotted that a tram was due in before the next DMU and so we crossed over and boarded number 30.\n\nBirmingham Tram 30_2015.06.19_2_Jewellery Quarter by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nThis was my first run on one of the new trams.\n\nWe did this all the way to Snow Hill and then boarded 172344 for the last leg to Moor Street.\n\nThis was done in coach 79344, meaning that it was the first (and last) unit that I cleared during this move.\n\nNow it was back to locos and for the third time that day we boarded a train powered by 68013.\n\nAs might be expected, we did this as far as our rovers would allow and disembarked at Leamington Spa.\n\nOnce again we had time on our hands and we filled it by doing my first winning DMU of the day, 165011.\n\nWe intended to do this to Solihull, but we were held at Dorridge to allow a late running express to pass.\n\nThis also stopped at Dorridge and so we leapt off the 165 and straight aboard 168107.\n\nWe had planned to do this trip to Solihull in order to replenish our supplies and this was duly done before we returned to Leamington, once again on 168107.\n\nNow it was time to start heading home.\n\n68011 was taken for the short run to Warwick Parkway and twenty minutes later 68014 arrived to haul us to Solihull and the car home.\n\n68011 clagging (a bit) out of Warwick Parkway:\n\n68011_2015.06.19_8_Warwick Parkway by Phil Wood, on Flickr\n\nSo, two winning locos, one required DMU and a tram.\n\nNot to mention a very sociable few hours including the usual laughs and banter.\n\nAnother good day in the book"
