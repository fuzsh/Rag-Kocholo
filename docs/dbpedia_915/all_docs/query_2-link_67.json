        "text": "Active Travel Projects: Community Engagement Events\n\nSorry you are too late, this event has been and gone!\n\nEast Renfrewshire Council is inviting residents to help shape early plans for five ambitious projects that will make it easier to walk, wheel, or cycle for everyday journeys.\n\nAbout Active Travel Projects: Community Engagement Events\n\nListed Under Community Events\n\nThe plans call for a connected network of active travel routes across Giffnock, Netherlee, Clarkston, and Newton Mearns, which aim to:\n\n• Upgrade major junctions like Eastwood Toll, to make it safer and easier for everyone to cross the road;\n\n• Deliver separated cycle ways along busy roads, to make cycling safer and more attractive for people of all ages and abilities;\n\n• Complete missing links in the off-road path network, to break down barriers between communities and make it quicker to access local services.\n\nThe Council want to learn more about what would help residents make short trips on foot or by bike. A series of drop-in events have been organised in local libraries on the following dates and times:\n\nClarkston Library on Tuesday 19 March from 10am until 5pm\n\nGiffnock Library on Tuesday 26 March from 10am until 7pm\n\nAt these events, residents will be able to see ideas on how streets in East Renfrewshire could be designed differently. Members of the project team will be on hand throughout the day to answer any questions, and information about every project will be available at each event.\n\nThe Council will also be launching dedicated web pages about the projects. These pages will show the same information as the in-person events, and will also include quick surveys that will help residents send feedback to the project team.\n\nThe web pages will launch on Monday 4 March, and the surveys will be open until Sunday 31 March.\n\nHave your say at: eractivetravel.commonplace.is\n\nThe five projects being considered are:\n\n• A77 Active Corridor - to consider how to integrate pedestrian crossing improvements, separated cycle ways, bus priority measures and vehicle parking/loading on Ayr Road and Fenwick Road\n\n• Clarkston - Muirend Active Corridor - to propose improvements for active travel on Clarkston Road alongside two new foot/cycle bridges across railway lines in the area\n\n• Clarkston - Thornliebank Active Corridor - to consider how to integrate improvements for active travel with vehicle parking/loading on Eaglesham Road, Busby Road, Eastwoodmains Road and Rouken Glen Road\n\n• Lower Whitecraigs Community Link - to develop proposals to improve the public realm on Davieland Road and surrounding streets to enhance the gateway to Rouken Glen Park\n\n• Wytch Wood Community Link in Patterton - to investigate how to complete a 'missing link' off-road path to improve access to Patterton railway station.\n\nWhere possible we will update our listings to notify of cancelled, postponed and rescheduled events, however we STRONGLY ADVISE that you check with the venue/organiser in the first instance for updates.\n\nAll information (whether in text or photographs) is supplied in good faith but should not be relied upon as being a statement of representation or fact.\n\nGOT AN EVENT TO SHARE?
