        "text": "Short but full of interest\n\nRoute 6 is a very short route, lasting about 20 minutes in off peak times, but it is packed full of interest, with major tourist attractions at almost every stop. Travelling through the town centre, it is an ideal bus to catch to reach many of the centre attractions, and to get an overview of the old town.\n\nThe bus starts off at the entrance to Holyrood Park, just outside Holyrood Palace, the Scottish Parliament and Dynamic Earth. Four major tourist attractions, all well worth visiting in their own right, within a few minutes walk of each other, and the bus stop.\n\nHolyrood Park is a massive green space right in the heart of the city. Perhaps its most famous point is Arthur’s Seat, but it also contains many other interesting places. Covering 650 acres, it includes lochs, extinct volcanoes, rock crags, ancient wells and ruined buildings in its expanse. It was created by King James, in 1541, who enclosed the open space with a stone wall. It was laid out in its current form, with landscaped areas and paved roads, by Prince Albert. Whilst still a Royal Park, and enjoyed by the current Royal family on their visits to Holyrood House, it is also open to the public all year round. Enjoy a stroll round the lochs, or, if you are more adventurous, climb the steep path to Arthur’s Seat (best on sunny days) for stunning views over Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth. Visit the ruins of St Anthony’s chapel on its crag and wander along the many pathways to hidden lochs and viewpoints. Do be aware that many of the paths are slippery so stout footwear is a must. Arthur’s Seat can be treacherous in wet or cold weather, as the rock of which it is composed (basalt) is very slippery when wet.\n\nStanding at one end of the Royal Mile, Holyrood Palace has been a royal residence since 1671, and is still used by the queen today on her official visits to Scotland. The present design was built for Charles II on the restoration of the monarchy, and remains largely unaltered today (apart from the addition of modern conveniences such as bathrooms and heating). The palace was originally an abbey dedicated by David I, named after the piece of true cross gifted to the abbey (the Holy Rood). James I of Scotland constructed the first Royal Residence adjacent to the abbey in 1501, and later monarchs added to, and rebuilt, parts of the palace. When James VI moved to London with his court, the palace was no longer in regular use as a royal residence and fell into disrepair, as did the adjacent abbey. Rebuilt in its current form for Charles II, George V was responsible for its conversion into a modern, comfortable residence. Many Parts of the palace are open to the public (admission ticket required), including the throne room and state apartments. The Queen’s gallery, with its ever-changing display of paintings is also well worth a visit. The tearooms and gift shop are free to visit.\n\nOpposite Holyrood Palace is the Scottish Parliament Building, set in a bowl of greenery with the Radical Road cliffs as a background. Right from the start of its construction in 1999, the building of the home for the Scottish Parliament has been controversial. Taking longer than estimated to build, and coming in way over budget (£414 Million as opposed to £40 million!), the building finally held its first meeting of the Scottish Parliament on 7th September 2004. Designed by Enric Miralles, the building was designed to “grow out of the land”. The architect drew his inspiration from natural forms, such as leaves, upturned fishing boats on the shores of Scotland’s coast and the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Inside, there are many artworks, some specially commissioned and some gifts from other nations. Love it or hate it, the building is certainly a talking point and well worth a visit, Guided tours are free, but you do need to book in advance as they get full quickly.\n\nThe bus leaves the Holyrood area via Horse Wynd, where the coaches to London used to depart from. Curving round the back of The Dynamic Earth Centre, the bus turns left onto Holyrood Road.\n\nDynamic Earth is the third major tourist attraction within a minutes walk of Holyrood Park and Palace. It is a virtual reality experience, taking you on a journey through time to explore the history and development of the Earth. The experience includes a variety of interactive experiences showing how the earth was formed and how it has developed from the initial Big Bang up to the present day. In the 4D experience, feel the heat of molten lava as a volcano explodes around you, then the chill of the polar icecap, before plunging into the depths of the ocean to watch deep sea life. Finish your visit with the 360 degree cinema experience. Films are continuously changing, so check their website before visiting to see what is currently showing. Well worth a visit, especially on a rainy day, as it is all inside.\n\nThe bus continues up Holyrood Road, passing a mixture of old town houses, interspersed with modern office blocks, and university buildings. On the right of the route, pass through the arches of Patterson’s land, now the School of Education, into the courtyard of Old Moray House. In the corner is a nondescript, small stone building, with shuttered windows. It may look like nothing, but this tiny summer house has a claim to fame in Scottish and English history. In 1707, The summer house stood in the grounds of Moray House, where many rich and notable Scots had tenancies. The Earl of Seafield was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and in charge of ensuring the act of union, uniting Scotland and England, was carried out successfully. The Earl had a tenancy in Moray House, and it is rumoured that the Act of Union was signed in the summer house, to prevent the angry mobs gathering outside the house stopping the signing. However, although it is likely that some signatures were added to the Act of Union in the summer house, it is unlikely that the main act was signed in such a tiny, unprestigious place.\n\nThe bus continues up Holyrood Road, past the numerous university buildings, then turns right into St Mary’s Street, with its plethora of tourist shops. The bus crosses the Royal Mile at the meeting point of Cannongate and High Street. Look on the left, just as it reaches High Street, to find the World’s End Pub. A listed building, as part of the exterior wall is the original city walls that use to protect the old town from the English, the pub stands on the site of the city gates. Look for the brass rectangles in the road (carefully, beware of traffic) that marks the foundations of the city gates. When the city gates stood, it was free to leave the city of Edinburgh, but a fee was charged to reenter through the city gates. The majority of ordinary people could not afford this fee, so to them, the world outside the gates did not exist, hence this was the “world’s end”!\n\nThe bus crosses the Royal Mile and continues along Jeffrey Street. As it rounds the bend there are fine views across Waverley station to the monuments on Calton Hill. Joining Market Street, bus 6 passes under North Bridge, currently undergoing an extensive restoration project.\n\nJust after passing under North Bridge, you see the covered arcaded arches of the Scotsman Steps. These 104 steps lead up to the Scotsman Hotel and North Bridge. Originally built in 1899, they have served as a foot link between Waverley Station and North Bridge for over 100 years. Thousands used them as a short cut, transferring between station and bus stops, and vice versa. But the steps were also a focus point for vandalism and used by late night revelers as a urinal. The stench of urine became so overpowering that they were referred to as “The Pishy Steps”. In 2011, a public art project revitalised the steps. Designed by Martin Creed, the steps were overhauled. Each step is now clad in a different marble from marble quarries located all over the world, The variety of colours and patterns make the steps, once disgusting, a beautiful and functional way of linking the two levels.\n\nThe bus continues along Market Street, past Brewmania. Look out for their floral displays on the wall. Next, we pass Waverley station, the main station for Edinburgh and from which you can travel anywhere in Great Britain. Originally a collection of 3 independent stations, managed by different rail companies, it became collectively known as Waverley around 1854, after the Walter Scott novel “Waverley”. Now proudly proclaiming to be the only station named after a novel, Waverley station is the second busiest in Scotland (the busiest being in Glasgow). Just past Waverley Station, is the Fruitmarket Gallery, a contemporary arts exhibition space housed in a former fruit and vegetable market. Passing the Edinburgh Dungeon, the bus reaches the bottom of the hill. Just on the corner of the roundabout you will find Lothian Buses travel hub, a one stop shop for information on buses and routes, timetables, tickets and bus related gifts.\n\nAfter crossing the roundabout, the bus climbs the hill to the top of market Street, past the Edinburgh Tour buses, where it meets the mound. At the top is an interesting, free museum. Housed in the original headquarters of the Royal Scottish Bank, the Museum On The Mound explores the history of banking in Scotland. At first reading this might seem a bit dry and, if I dare say it, boring. But have you ever seen what a million pound in twenty pound notes looks like? An interesting museum with a wide variety of exhibits and good explanations. Scattered around the museum are small activities for children (and adults) to explore. And that million pounds would never fit in an ordinary briefcase you can cart with you to pay the ransom on a kidnap victim, no matter what the Hollywood films say!\n\nThe bus continues down the Mound to Princes Street. The Mound is an artificial slope created between 1781 and 1830 from the rubble excavated in the building of the New Town. A cloth merchant, George Boyd, wanted to view the building works going on in the new town. He decided against going the long way round, via the newly built North Bridge, instead taking the short cut across the marshland formed by the draining of Loch Nor (now Princes Street Gardens). Finding the way difficult, he hit upon the idea of using the rubble from the building works to create a causeway across the marsh. Originally just an earthen mound, it became a focal point for all sorts of illegal and legal, but disreputable businesses. In 1840, the building of the new National Gallery cleared the top part of the mound and the road up the mound was widened and cleaned up, eventually being tarmaced. Little has changed on the mound since then. In 1959, a series of underground heating elements, known as the electric blanket, was installed under the roadway to keep the steep hill free of ice and snow, making it safer for vehicles and to keep the traffic flowing during winter. It is no longer used, but the elements still exist under the road way.\n\nAt the bottom of the mound is the Scottish National Gallery. The Scottish National Gallery comprises 2 buildings, set one behind the other. The rear building is actually the earliest, built in 1822, to house the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). Later, in 1859, the front building was built to house the RSA’s growing collection of art, and provide a display place for the public to view the collection. Both buildings are built to resemble a Greek temple and were designed by William Playfair. The RSA building now houses displays by a variety of artistic academies, including the RSA. The exhibitions change throughout the year. The main building was extended in the 1970, to add more exhibition space on a second floor, and a basement cafe and room to house the Scottish collection on the lower ground floor. The entrance leading into Princes Street Gardens in currently being re-modeled to form the main, easily accessible entrance, and should be finished in early 2020.\n\nThe bus crosses Princes Street, with its tourist shops and hotels, continuing down Hanover Street. Passing over Rose Street, with its many bars and restaurants, the bus continues a short way up Hanover Street. Hanover Street has several listed buildings built in the Greek style. The bus loops round the statue of George IV at the junction with George Street then starts its return journey.\n\nRound the houses\n\nWhere or what was Hunters tryst? Was it going to be another shopping centre or something more exciting. This route travels mainly through housing estates, but passing a variety of interesting points on the way.\n\nRoute 5 starts off at the Jewel, a large supermarket, alongside routes 2 and 4. However it immediately diverts from these 2 buses, turning right to travel through Brunstane. The bus then turns left, through the inland edge of Portobello, past the high school and on into an area called the Durhams. Most of the route so far has been through 1970s housing estates, and this continues until we come to the Mountcastle Estate. On entering the Mountcastle Estate, the bus passes over the bridge that divides Figgate Park into 2 halves.\n\nFiggate park is a lovely park nestled between Duddingston and Portobello. Wheelchair and buggy friendly paths provide a peaceful stroll on either side of the clean flowing Figgate Burn, which runs down the centre of the park. Figgate Burn runs from Duddingston Loch through to the Firth of Forth. One end of the burn in the park has been partialy diverted to form a large pond, originally a clay pit, with a boardwalk enabling easy access to feed the water fowl (NO bread please! Lettuce, peas, sweetcorn, seeds, cooked rice are all great). Throughout the park, under the trees, are wooden posts. These posts all have a metal plaque with an inset design featuring a leaf and the name of the tree. Set up by the Friends of Figgate Park, they form a tree trail and rubbing trail round the park. More are currently in progress. The bridge under the road has also been transformed with a colourful mural, featuring animals and birds that can be found in the park. So peaceful was the park, that it has become my picnic place of choice when in the area.\n\nThe bus continues through the Mountcastle Estate to Northfield Drive, where it rejoins route 4, travelling along Portobello Road, past the old Sports centre, currently running along Regent Terrace, with its park and stunning views over Edinburgh old town and Arthur’s Seat. Stop off at Meadowbank Terrace, and take a short walk up the road into the back of Holyrood Park. Just inside the entrance is a small cairn, with an interesting history.\n\nMuschat’s Cairn was the scene of a grisly murder in 1720. On the evening of 14th October, Nichol Muschat suggested to his wife, Ailie, that they should take a romantic walk through Holyrood Park as the weather was so fine. However, he had a different idea in mind. Having grown tired of her, and previous attempts to frame her for adultery and persuade a friend to poison her having failed, he determined to finally make an end to her. The cairn marked the spot where he succeeded in his attempt to murder her, cutting her throat with his surgeons knife, using so much force he almost severed her head. Local people placed a stone in her memory as they passed by the spot, and the cairn grew. Nichol was hanged for his crime in the Grassmarket. Scott used the cairn as the meeting place between his heroine and hero in The Heart Of Midlothian and mentions it several times in his novels. Originally the cairn was sited near St Anthony’s Chapel, but moved to make way for the road, When it was rebuilt, for some unknown reason, it was cemented together with concrete, which rather spoils it.\n\nEntering the town centre, the bus turns down North Bridge (currently under refurbishment) along South Bridge, joining route 3. Passing down Nicholson street, stop off at Nicholson Square, where Bus route 2 joins us, to see the Brass Founders Column in the gardens. This column is 13 feet high and has the figure of a craftsman on top. Originally it was created by the Brass Founders of Edinburgh and Leith for the international exhibition of science and art in 1886. On the sides are the coats of arms of 20 Royal Scottish Burghs, alongside those of Scotland, England and Ireland. Presented to the city, it was transferred to the gardens in 1976 after restoration.\n\nContinuing alongside bus routes 2 and 3, past The Surgeons Hall museum, Kings Hall, and Coates Crescent Gardens, bus number 5 leaves route 2 at East Preston Street, continuing through the New Town with its Edwardian houses, many now converted into shops or bed and Breakfast establishments. Turning right at Salisbury Place, past the headquarters of Historic Scotland, the bus says farewell to route 3.\n\nThe bus passes Grange cemetery on its journey and in the corner, by the gate is a lovely old carved well. Opposite, is St Catherine’s Argyle Church. Although you cannot see inside, there are some interesting carvings round the doors and windows. The bus continues along Grange Road, eventually reaching Morningside, with its busy shops and pubs.\n\nHalfway down Morningside is a side road, Spring Valley Gardens. A short distance along this road is an alleyway. Go through the arch to be surprised. An ancient Wild West town in the middle of Edinburgh! It was originally created as an advertising gimmick for the furniture shop based in the area (which soon failed) and is now a series of work shops, the town has a cantina, jail and horse rails. Well worth seeing, but in desperate need of restoring.\n\nAt the bottom of Morningside Road, the bus passes the site of the former Morningside station. Closed in 1962, all that now remains is the old station clock, standing forlornly alone on the pavement. The bus continues up Coniston Road, turning right at Greenbank Crescent.\n\nStop off at the corner to explore Braidburn Valley Park. Running alongside the Braid Burn from Coniston Road to Oxgangs Avenue, this pleasant green space is a delightful walk. Part of the park follows Fly Walk, the route Robert Louis Stevenson used to take home from Edinburgh. The park also contains an open air theatre, complete with,orchestra pit, bounded by trees to help the acoustics. A delightful spot to watch open air performances, such as Shakespeare’s Midsummer’s Night Dream, or the bike stunt team, whilst eating your picnic (and possibly enjoying a glass of wine or 2).\n\nBus 5 follows the outskirts of Braidburn Valley Park, onto Oxgangs Avenue, where it joins the route of bus number 4. Travelling past the Cockit Hat, a triangle of greenery named after the hat of the same shape, the bus turns right, opposite to route 4 at the roundabout, continuing on past Hunter’s Tryst Pub, to end in the housing estate of the same name.\n\nThe Hunter’s Tryst pub has served travelers for over a century. Once, it was set in the woods, a fair distance from Edinburgh, but, as the city grew, it became incorporated in to the,suburbs, lending its name to the new development growing up around it. In the 19th Century it was often the meeting place of the Six Mile High Club, a society for gentlemen over the designated height. Here. they met and performed feats of athleticism. The meetings were often presided over by Sir Walter Scott, the author, who was himself a member. Later, the carriage carrying Robert Louis Stevenson or his family frequently stopped here for refreshments on their way back to Swanston.\n\nShop to ski slopes\n\nStart your journey at the Jewel, stock up on wooly hats, gloves, ski pants and anything else you will need to enjoy winter sports in the height of summer. (Don’t forget the first aid kit!). Take the number 4 bus through Edinburgh to the Pentland Hills and settle in for a day of winter sports. Or, more leisurely, just enjoy the views after a lazy trip up the chair lift.\n\nRoute number 4 starts off with route 2, at The Jewel, a superstore on the eastern edge of Edinburgh.\n\nOpposite the Jewel is a thin, but long park, Magdalene Glen. This park provides a pleasant walk into Duddingston village one way, or all the way to Musselburgh the opposite way. Interspersed with children’s play areas, the path is easy walking and accessible.\n\nLeaving route 2 at the edge of the Jewel housing estate, bus 4 continues through the Bingham housing estate. At the end of a road, the bus goes round a roundabout, then back up the same road. At the turning point there is easy access to The Jewel Park.\n\nThe Jewel park provides a pleasant green strip of land between housing estates. and the railway track. Starting at the Jewel estate it runs through to Duddingston park and the back of Holyrood park. The paths are accessible, forming part of the John Muir Way. Play areas are provided for older and younger children. One of the routes through the park is the Innocent Railway Cycle Route. The Innocent Railway was opened in 1831 to take coal from Dalkeith to Edinburgh. Originally operated by horse drawn wagons, it soon became popular with passengers wanting a day out in Dalkeith. Eventually converted to steam, it was closed down in 1968, since becoming a long distance cycle path stretching from Newington to Brunstane.\n\nThe bus continues round the edge of Duddingston golf course, into Duddingston village. Now a suburb of Edinburgh, this protected area was once a coal mining village in its own right. Although the attractive village centre., with its old coaching inn, is a walk away from the number 4 bus route, hints of how the village appears can be seen in the old cottage on the corner and in the shape of the Duddingston forge building (although the pebble dashing now hides the original stonework).\n\nAfter making a sharp right turn the bus runs along Portobello Road into London Road. This is an area of victorian houses made from red and yellow(ish) sandstone, interspersed with more modern housing blocks. The dates in the old blocks gives a graphic demonstration of how Edinburgh grew in the late Victorian era. The new housing blocks have been built sympathetically to the old, using similar materials and in a similar style, including turrets! The bus runs past where the Meadowbank Sports Centre used to stand. The centre has now being demolished to make way for a brand new stare of the art sports complex, due to open in 2020, on the same site.\n\nWhen I went on the Number 4, the route was diverted up Regent Road, rather than continuing along London Road. It was unclear whether this is a permanent alteration to the route, or just a temporary, though long term, diversion whilst the redevelopment of Leith Walk is carried out. Taking the bus up Regent Road does give amazing views across the Royal Mile to Arthur’s Seat and the Radical Road. Walking through Regent Road Park, stop to look down on Holyrood House and the Scottish Parliament building. Look up to see Arthur’s Seat, with its line of ant like tourists snaking to the top, and the crags of The Radical Road. Regent Road Park has 2 cute animal sculptures, and The Stones Of Scotland sculpture, a ring of stones representing every region in Scotland.\n\nAt the further end of Regent Road is the monument to Robbie Burns. Built on the style of a classical Greek monument (complete with triumphal urn on the top), it is not open to the public and can only be viewed from the pavement. Next door is Calton Burial grounds, one of the first landscaped burial grounds in Edinburgh, complete with its watch tower to guard against body snatchers. Across the road is the Old Royal High School, with more Greek columns and a classical style. Once a school for the rich of Edinburgh (males only), it now stands empty, waiting for someone to decide what to do with it.\n\nPassing St Andrews house, the original home of the Scottish Government office, before devolution and the formation of the Scottish Parliament. The bus rejoins its scheduled route at the bottom of Calton Hill, where glimpses of Calton Monument and Nelsons Tower can be seen above the trees. Stop off at the Old Calton Burial ground to see the Martyrs Monument and the American War of Independence’s tribute to the many Scots that fought and died in their fight for freedom from the British crown.\n\nRoute 4 rejoins routes 1 and 3 at North Bridge , just before Waverley Station, taking the same route through the city centre, as far as the bottom of Princes street. As you go along Princes Street stop off and visit the Debenhams Store. Converted from the Conservative Club (built in 1884), the building has retained many of the original features. Easily visible is the grand staircase, with its spectacular stained glass window. But hidden behind racks of women’s clothes, on the third floor, is another original feature, left over from when the store expanded into the neighbouring Liberal Club. The oak panelled library wall, with a bust of William Gladstone and shelves of original books, serves as a reminder of earlier, more cerebral days. At the end of Princes Street, bus 1 turns right, whilst number 4 carries on, with bus 3, past Coates Crescent, with its statue of William Gladstone to Haymarket.\n\nStop to look at the clock, erected in memory of the members of the Hearts of Midlothian teams that died in the 2 World Wars that afflicted the world in the 20th century. After travelling Dalry Road, bus 4 abandons bus route 3, to travel up through Slateford, passing the old Caledonian Brewery house (still brewing there ) on the way.\n\nContinuing through the Craiglockhart housing estates, the bus reaches Edinburgh Napier University Craiglockhart Campus. A short walk through the campus gates brings you to the War Poets Museum. The building was a convalescence hospital for shell shocked victims of the first world war. Among its patients were Siegfred Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. The business school library now also serves as a museum for the hospital, and the collection is open to all. The collection, though small, is poignant, including a photo of where Wilfred Owen was killed, a few days before the armistice was signed. Well worth a visit. The grounds are still very similar to those that would have been enjoyed by the war poets whilst they stayed there, restful, calm and a balm to nerves shattered at the front.\n\nThe route continues round the back of Wester Craiglockhart Hill, and past the Redford Infantry Barracks. It continues into the estate of Oxgangs, a comparatively new development (1950s). At the junction of Oxgangs Road and Caystane view is a solitary standing stone. This huge, 3 m high, block of red sandstone was probably raised in the Neolithic era. Cup mark carvings, like those on the back of the Caystone, were often added to important sites by Neolithic man. The striations on the stone make it look like a giant hand and the numerous Neolithic and Bronze Age burial sites found in the vicinity during the building of the estate and road network suggest that this was a sacred site in ancient times. Although now looking rather out of place amongst the suburban houses and neat gardens, when it was raised, the area would have been a promontory, with wide views over the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe bus runs for a short while further through the housing estates, then, after crossing the Edinburgh Bypass, enters into open countryside, at the edge of the Pentland Hills. The terminus is a layby at the bottom of the drive leading up to the Ski centre and the Pentland Regional Park. Take a wander through the park for amazing views of Edinburgh and lovely countryside. This range of medium sized hills stretch from the Edinburgh bypass through to Calops. There are plenty of footpaths and a visitor centre can be found at Harlaw near Balerno. Although the paths are signposted, please be aware that this is still Scotland, and the weather can change at a moments notice, so make sure you are appropriately dressed for all possibilities. Unfortunately, I was not dressed for hill walking, so contented myself with a short wander through the gorse bushes in full flower, scenting the air with their coconut perfume.\n\nThe snow sports centre at Hillend is owned and operated by Midlothian Council. It is a 10 minute walk up the hill (quite steep in stretches), but well worth the walk. The centre offers skis and snowboarding facilities and lessons, as well as something called tubing! Unfortunately, the tubing slope was under maintenance when I visited so I did not get to find out what it was (as a spectator not participant!). A trip for when my adrenaline junkie daughter arrives home from university for the summer me thinks. The centre also provides after school club facilities, and when I visited on the Friday afternoon, many schools obviously took advantage of this great venue. To enable skiers to reach the top of the slopes, the centre has a chair lift. On finding out the centre did sightseers tickets, enabling non-skiers to ride up to the top (and back down, I specifically asked about this!) I could not resist it . The trip was well worth the £3.25 as the views from the top were stunning. Apparently a favourite place of Robert Louis Stevenson and a plaque at the top quotes his description of the view. A cairn has a place marker on top which enables you to identify the places seen from the hill. It was a lovely clear day when I went up and you could easily see the Trossachs and Berwick Law.\n\nSuburb to outlying towns and education.\n\nThis route takes you from the suburbs at one side of Edinburgh, through the city centre, out the other side, then through the country to an outlying town. Here the route splits with one part taking you to an educational campus, and the other branch round to a comparatively new town.\n\nStarting off in Clovenstone, Route 3 begins on a housing estate in the western suburbs of Edinburgh. Opposite the bus stop is a windy strip of park, between the main road and Edinburgh bypass. This is possibly part of Curriemuiren Park, but no signs, just the remains of metal posts that I assume once held a sign, On exploring this park hoping to find a cloven stone, I found a weird brick pyramid covered partially in pebbles. No explanation. No information signs. Just that odd pyramid in the middle of a plot of grass. After researching on the internet, still none the wiser!\n\nFrom Clovenstone, Route 3 winds through housing estates, round the back of Kingsknowe Golf Course, to Wester Hailes. Wester Hailes was named after an old country estate, with Hailes meaning “green”. There is still plenty of green space to be found among the housing estates, especially along the canal. The abundance of green space everywhere is something I have particularly noticed since moving to Edinburgh. After criss-crossing the canal, the bus arrives at Westside Plaza. This is a purpose built rather grim shopping centre with a small selection of shops (and more importantly a coffee shop). The outside is rather industrial and the inside is typical of thousands of small shopping centres the country over.\n\nThe route crosses the canal again and passes by Wester Hailes Education centre, a large high school with a public swimming pool and leisure facilities. It also provides community services to the area.\n\nIf you fancy a walk to stretch your legs, get off the bus here and take the canal path along the Union Canal. One way stretches into central Edinburgh, whilst the other goes to Linlithgow, then onto Falkirk and the Falkirk Wheel. Although I have not walked all the way (being content with small stretches at a time,) it is flat easy walking, with an accessible wheelchair and buggy friendly path.The canal abounds with water life, and the day I walked it I was greeted by several families of ducklings, and a family of tiny cygnets. The sides are a wealth of wild flowers, greenery and trees. Many of them were coming into blossom and leaf, creating a mulit-coloured walkway. A delightful walk, especially on a sunny, spring day (unfortunately it was an icy cold spring day).\n\nWe then enter the Saughton district, and pass Saughton Park on the opposite side to routes 1 and 2. Route 3 meets routes 1 and 2 at the corner of Saughton Park, following it along Gorgie Road, past Gorgie City Farm and the Tynecastle ground. Route 1 leaves us at Dalry Road, whilst route 2 says goodbye at Haymarket. Leaving those two routes behind us, Route 3 continues into the city centre.\n\nJust before the bus reaches the city centre, it passes Coates Crescent. These gardens are home to an imposing statue of William Gladstone, who started his campaign to be prime minister where we finish this route, Dalkeith.\n\nAfter passing through Princes Street and the main town centre, bus number 3 leaves Edinburgh through the Georgian town area.\n\nPassing along Niddry Street, it runs through a student area. This area abounds with reasonably priced eating places, from all nationalities. Fancy Korean? Nepalese? Scottish? or just a drop of whisky in one of the many pubs that are also found in the area. I counted 16 nationalities passing through on the bus. Here too, is found The Surgeons Hall museum, a complex of museums dedicated to medical history. Worth just popping in to the entrance hall to see the beautiful stained glass panel.\n\nAlong this road are also 2 halls. The first, the King’s Hall, is a beautiful, Gothic, sandstone building. The Kings Hall was built in 1843, by the Free Church of Scotland and is now owned by the Community Church. Inside are some beautiful stained glass windows, showing scenes form the resurrection of Christ. In contrast, across the road is the Queen’s hall, a squat, grey, block building. Originally built in 1823, as Hope Park Chapel, it was deconsecrated and turned into a music venue in 1979. It holds regular concerts and all types of music can be listened to here, from traditional Scottish through to rap and boy bands.\n\nThe bus then continues down Clerk Street, at first glance lined with breeze block shops. But look above the shop fronts. You will see that most of the shops are actually modern extensions built in the front gardens of lovely Georgian houses. One or two of the houses have kept their front gardens, sandwiched between the shop fronts, and their original grace can be seen.\n\nContinuing along Newington Street, we enter a region where both sides of the road have kept their Georgian frontages and elegance. A vast majority of the houses are now bed and breakfasts, but at least they have not been pebble-dashed or breeze-blocked.\n\nThe route runs past Cameron Toll shopping centre, and Inch Park. Take a stroll through the shopping centre car park, towards the health centre in the corner. Go up the steps as you round the corner of the health centre and you will discover a delightful oasis of peace and tranquility. Braid Burn runs along here, creating a short, but pretty walk. The path winds between trees, with glimpses of the old watermill that used to stand here (now a private house). When I was there, the air was filled with the scent of garlic and the wild garlic was in full flower (thank you to the dog walker with the delightfully friendly scottie dog who identified them for me). This is a sign that the woods you are walking in a remnant of the ancient woodland that once covered most of the country. The flowers and leaves are edible and pack a tasty punch to salads, pesto and soup. However, only pick what you need, leave the rest to reproduce and for others.\n\nStop off at Robin’s Nest (at least I’m not the only one to remember the 70s TV programme) and cross the road to explore the beautiful BurdieHouse Burn. When I was there the leaves were just coming into springtime bud and the sunlight had a green tinge to it as it shone through the new leaves. The babbling brook running alongside the path added movement and a counterpoint to the sounds of birds singing everywhere. It is hard to remember that this is only a narrow strip of land running between housing estates. Do take time to admire the beautiful wrought iron gates at the entrance.\n\nThe bus continues through pebble dashed housing estates to the suburb of Gilmerton. Once a village in its own right, centred around the coal mine, it is now a suburb of Edinburgh, but still traces of the old village can be found. Gilmerton is also where an underground complex of caves carved from the bedrock was discovered. Often attributed to a local blacksmith, who said he carved out the caves in 1724, and who lived there for some years. However, traces of earlier habitation and excavation has been found and the caves are thought to be much older than this. Tours need to be booked in advance, so I am eagerly waiting to see the inside.\n\nThe bus then runs through open countryside, though a lot of new building work is evident. Just off a roundabout is Edinburgh’s butterfly and insect world. Although I have not visited this attraction it is meant to be ideal for families and have plenty of butterflies and other insects to admire.\n\nJust before Dalkeith, stop off at the Justin Lees Pub and take a short walk along the path to, at first glance, an unassuming estate wall. Perched on the top are 2 crows and the remains of a third. Underneath is an inscribed plaque with the words from a traditional Scottish song about 3 craws ( crows).\n\nContinuing through farmland, the bus enters Dalkeith through the newish, affluent suburb of Eskbank. Dalkeith High Street is well worth a walk down. There are plenty of old buildings with beautiful architecture mixed in amongst the concrete blocks.\n\nWalk the length of the high Street to find St Nicholas Church. This is a lovely example of a parish church in itself, but walk round the corner of the church to find the ruins of the old chapel and the family vault.\n\nAt the opposite end of the High Street, look for the Harrow Hotel, a beautiful, grade 2 listed building from 1820, with many of its original features. There are many other interesting buildings on the High Street and surrounding roads and alleyways. Dalkeith has a town trail leaflet detailing where they may be found and their history.\n\nWhilst in the High Street look for the red plaques (yes red not blue!) on the walls of various buildings. Created as a public artwork “I Woz Here Dalkeith” in 2012 by artist Susan Garnt, these plaques commemorate the everyday memories of people living in Dalkeith, from the mundane to the extraordinary. look for them round corners, up alleyways and in doorways. A map is produced by the town council.\n\nAlso stop off at the library next to the bus stop in Buccleuch Street. There is an open iron work sculpture, featuring a farmer and a miner, as a tribute to Dalkeith’s industrial and agricultural past. Look down to see the mosaic pavement celebrating some of the symbols of Dalkeith.\n\nJust after Dalkeith, the route splits. Some buses turning right to Mayfield and others turning left to Dalkeith Campus.\n\nTurning left first, we continue through the outskirts of Dalkeith, skirting round the town boundaries to Dalkeith Community Campus. Situated on the edge of town, with wide views of the surrounding countryside, this community campus was created in 2003. It contains high schools, a community centre, leisure centre and a school for children with additional educational needs. The bus terminates here, spending a short time before returning to Clovenstone.\n\nReturning to Dalkeith we take the bus turning right, to Mayfield. The bus runs through open countryside, with building work again, until it comes to the small town of Mayfield. Originally built as an overspill settlement for the workers in the nearby coal pits, it is now a growing modern housing development, merging with nearby Easthouses. The bus terminates at the roundabout, on the junction of Bogwood, Eskview and D’Arcy roads, circling the roundabout ready for its return journey into Clovenstone.\n\nThe Utilitarian Route\n\nThis route sounded very exciting! Where and what was The Jewel? I imagined a cave complex with stalactites and stalagmites, a pretty little village green, an old country inn, a diamond mine and various other fantasies. The reality was far from all except one of these dreams, but we will come to that.\n\nThe route starts off in The Gyle Center, a shopping centre near to Edinburgh Gateway rail station. The centre has a wide variety of shops and eating places, in a light and airy setting.\n\nOpposite the shopping centre is a tiny little park, which would be pleasant to sit in in warm weather, but not in the icy drizzle of today.\n\nFrom the Gyle Centre, the route passes round Edinburgh Park, visiting the Hermiston Gait Retail Park, which contains a number of large stores (note to self: remember to buy printer ink next time). Then the route winds through several housing estates, before joining bus route number 1, after passing the Sighthill Campus of Edinburgh University, with its vast sports fields.\n\nBus number 2 continues to follow the route of the number 1, past Saughton Park and Rose gardens, along Gorgie road, as far as Dalry Road. On the way it passes Gorgie city farm. This is an oasis among the city buildings. On the farm are a variety of small and large animals, including ducks, cows, pigs and horses. The farm sells its own produce and has activities for children in the community. It also has a small cafe, unfortunately only open in the summer.\n\nThe route continues past Gallery 710 (a studio and art gallery featuring glass art), and the Tynecastle Stadium, home of the Hearts.\n\nAfter passing Haymarket station, the bus continues up Morrison Street, passing the Edinburgh International Conference Centre on the right.\n\nThe route then winds through the old town of Edinburgh. As you travel through the old town look down alley ways for glimpses of the back of Edinburgh Castle, perched on its rocky outcrop. Stop off in the Grassmarket, one of Edinburgh’s oldest market places, for a bite to eat at one of the many pubs or cafes. Even, if the Scottish weather permits, eat al fresco on the ancient cobbled street!\n\nTake a walk up the steps of the Vennel, at the bottom of Grassmarket, to see part of the Flodden Wall, built round Edinburgh after the defeat at the Battle of Flodden in the 16th Century and the Telfer extension, built in the 17th century. Also admire the views of Edinburgh castle, framed by the old walls\n\nThe bus takes the passenger alongside Greyfriar’s Kirkyard, home of the famous Greyfriar’s Bobby. Pop in and see the dog’s grave marker. Take a look around, you will also find the tombstone of Timothy Riddle (Harry Potter anyone?), then play spot the tombstone inspiration for other Harry Potter characters. If the church is open, which it wasn’t when I visited, it is meant to be a fine example of architecture. I hope to return to visit when it is open.\n\nOn your way back to the bus stop, admire the bronze statue of Bobby on the corner of the road. But don’t rub his nose for luck, the millions of visitors that do this each year are wearing the bronze away and damaging the statue. Just admire, leave the bronze for future generations (you don’t need to rub his nose for luck, you must be lucky, you’re in Edinburgh!)\n\n,A couple of stops further on, we come to the National Museum of Scotland,\n\nThe new art-deco wing contrasting, yet complementing, the old, original victorian building.\n\nFree to enter, the museum is a must see, full of interesting exhibits. If short of time, view the millennial clock. Then take a look at Dolly the sheep, frightening to realise she was cloned after I finished studying genetics at university, really brought home how old I’m getting (not too old to take on the challenge of new technology though JF, (for explanation of this comment see my introduction)). Worth looking at too is a walk through their Natural World Gallery. And of course the Scottish gallery, with the famous Lewes Chess pieces.\n\nCarrying on, look out for the McEwan Hall in Bristo Square. This grand Victorian hall is the graduation venue for Edinburgh University, and is also used for concerts and conferences, and can be hired. Here, also, can be found the oldest student union building in the world.\n\nLeaving the old town, the route continues into the more modern housing estates of the suburbs, through Craigmillar, with its old castle and brand new library and community centre (complete with snuggle book corner), onto Niddrie. Here it passes Hunter’s Hall Park. Mainly grassland, this park has a strip of woodland, running alongside the Niddrie Burn, which is lovely to walk through. It is also home to the Jack Kane sports and community centre.\n\nJust before it reaches the Jewel, the bus passes another pleasant, if narrow park, Magdalene Glen, also running alongside Niddrie Burn.\n\nFinally we reach THE JEWEL. Not a cave complex with stalictites and stalagmites, a pretty little village green, an old country inn, or a diamond mine, but…..\n\nA giant supermarket! (However it was built on the site of a former coal mine, with a particularly rich seam of coal)!"
