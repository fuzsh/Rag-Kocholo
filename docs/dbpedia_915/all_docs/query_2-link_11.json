        "text": "It comes as a yellow warning remains in place across Scotland as a result of the storm with travel severely disrupted.\n\nIn a post on Twitter/X, Network Rail Scotland said: “We’ve just found (what remains of) a garden shed on the line at Bellgrove station in Glasgow.\n\n“If you live next to a railway, please secure garden sheds, trampolines and patio furniture as best you can.”\n\nMore images posted by Network Rail showed the extent of debris which still needs clearing.\n\nAnother post said: “This is Whitecraigs on @ScotRail’s Glasgow Central-Neilston route. A large tree has fallen onto the railway here, damaging the overhead wires.\n\n“We’re working to clear the debris and repair the damage as quickly as we can.”\n\nThe latest update from ScotRail, posted shortly after 6am, said: “There are currently NO ScotRail services running following Storm Isha.\n\n“This is for safety reasons. We’ll keep our app, website and JourneyCheck pages fully updated so please check them regularly for updates.”\n\nIt added: “Network Rail Scotland will need to inspect all of the closed lines in daylight for any damage, flooding or debris on tracks, following the storm.”\n\nOther images showed the damage done in Shawlands in Glasgow with one photo showing how a tree had smashed through a car window.\n\nWe previously told how passengers were left shocked as strong winds blew a suitcase across the tarmac at Edinburgh Airport.\n\nA number of flights heading to and from Scotland were forced to divert as a result of the strong winds yesterday while some were cancelled."
