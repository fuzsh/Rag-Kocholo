        "text": "British Transport Police said the 17-year-old had been struck by a train working for Network Rail, which covers tracks in an adhesive substance during damp or frosty conditions.\n\nThe teenager was taken to Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary but died a short time later.\n\nA British Transport Police spokesman said there were no suspicious circumstances.\n\nExact details of how the teenager came to be on the railway line remained unclear last night. It is understood he had been on a night out in Glasgow with a friend and the pair had taken a taxi home at the end of the night. His friend is believed to have left the taxi at Pollokshields, where he lived.\n\nCallum took the taxi to Whitecraigs station where, it is understood, he was seen on CCTV falling from the platform on to the line. He was walking along the line, out of range of the cameras, when the accident happened.\n\nThe teenager's family were last night too distraught to talk at their home in Whitecraigs. His father, Allan, 52, mother Moira, 51, and sister, Morvyn, 20, were being comforted by friends and relatives.\n\nMr Radlow, who is a senior partner in law firm McVey and Murricane, of Bath Street, Glasgow, is understood to have been on business in London when he heard the news. Mrs Radlow, who is a paralegal with the firm, was at home.\n\nMorvyn, a student in law and French, was in Lyon, France, as part of her studies, when she learned of her brother's death. She flew home immediately.\n\nIn a family statement, Mr Radlow said: \"We have lost a fine son of whom we were immensely proud. Our lives are empty. Callum's death has left a space that will never be filled.\"\n\nCallum left Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow in the summer with five A passes.\n\nAminute's silence was held at the school yesterday and rector Dr Kenneth Greig described the student's death as \"a tragic loss\"."
