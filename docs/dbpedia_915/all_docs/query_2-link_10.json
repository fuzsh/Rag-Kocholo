        "text": "An 84-year-old man has died after a car he was travelling in hit a fallen tree in central Scotland during Storm Isha.\n\nThe front-seat passenger was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash on Beancross Road, Grangemouth, at about 23:45 on Sunday.\n\nMore heavy rain and winds are expected on Tuesday as Storm Jocelyn hits, with an amber warning for some areas of Scotland.\n\nMost rail travel stopped on Monday and thousands remain without power.\n\nScotRail suspended all of its train services from 19:00 on Sunday and Network Rail said it was a \"challenging\" day clearing the tracks.\n\nLines are gradually reopening and a limited service is operating in some areas.\n\nAs of midday, more than 15,000 properties are still without power but engineers have restored connection to about 78,000.\n\nSouthern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it had more than 400 field staff deployed in the north of Scotland network area in response to Storm Isha - about five times the staffing levels on a \"business as usual\" day.\n\nAn amber warning for wind has been issued for Storm Jocelyn from 18:00 on Tuesday until 08:00 on Wednesday morning. It covers the west coast of Scotland and part of the north and north east.\n\nAnd there is a yellow warning for wind and rain in place from 16:00 on Tuesday to 12:00 on Wednesday.\n\nScotRail is advising customers that all rail services across the country will be suspended from 19.00 on Tuesday and there will be no rush-hour services on Wednesday morning, as the extreme weather from Storm Jocelyn arrives.\n\nTrains that depart before 19:00 will complete their journey, but no services will begin their journey after that time.\n\nHeavy winds of up to 60/70 mph are expected, which ScotRail said could lead to trees and other debris falling onto the tracks, making conditions unsafe to operate trains.\n\nA rare red danger to life warning was issued by the Met Office for north east Scotland on Sunday night.\n\nPolice Scotland warned drivers to take \"extra caution\" after lowland gusts reached 84mph (135km/h) overnight.\n\nDozens of flights were disrupted on Monday morning, several ferry services were halted and drivers were warned of dangerous conditions due to high winds and surface water.\n\nGusts of 84mph were recorded in the village of Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire, 81mph (130 km/h) in Kirkwall on Orkney and 80mph (129km/h) in Wick in the Highlands.\n\nParts of central and southern Scotland had their highest wind gusts in more than 10 years, with Glasgow and Edinburgh both recording their strongest gusts since 5 December 2013.\n\nPolice said conditions for travel may be hazardous and extra caution should be exercised by all road users because of debris on roads, flooding and short-notice closures.\n\nAngela Grubb, from the Black Isle in the Highlands, was woken overnight when a tree crashed into her home.\n\nShe said: \"The tree fell on the roof, just above my bedroom, on our newly-built extension. I thought 'why didn't it fall on the old part?'\n\n\"Our house is very exposed so when a storm hits, my family stays up all night with our fingers crossed.\n\n\"I had expected that my greenhouse would blow away, not that this huge old tree would come down.\n\n\"There is obviously damage to the roof but it's all fixable.\"\n\nScottish Power Energy Networks said 55,500 properties in southern and central Scotland had power cuts while a further 30,000 Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) customers lost power.\n\nThe latest winter storm follows a week of disruption caused by snow in north and north-east Scotland.\n\nMet Office weather warnings - including a red warning for northeast Scotland and an amber warning for high winds across the country - expired earlier.\n\nA yellow wind warning covered the UK until 12:00.\n\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) originally had more than 30 flood warnings in place across the country.\n\nIn the Highland Council area 38 schools were closed, along with more than 60 in Aberdeenshire, almost 20 in Moray and 20 in Dumfries and Galloway.\n\nAll schools in Shetland have been closed since Thursday.\n\nA number of flight arrival and departures were cancelled on Monday morning at Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports.\n\nDavid Ross from ScotRail told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: \"Storm Isha did cause a lot of damage to the network - fallen trees, overhead wire problems, garden objects on the line - for example trampolines.\n\n\"There are a number of routes where we're still working to get them back open. There's lots of wok going on across the network by teams at ScotRail and Network Rail to get services back to some sort of normality.\n\n\"We are working flat out to get things back up and running. Our advice to passengers planning to travel today is to check the website or the ScotRail app.\"\n\nHe confirmed that repair work was ongoing after a wall and fence blew onto the railway track, affecting Queen Street low level services.\n\nBetween Garrowhill and Easterhouse, more than 10 trees fell onto the line.\n\nThere is also disruption on the roads, with drivers being urged to drive carefully.\n\nTransport Scotland's head of transport resilience, Ashleigh Robson, said: \"Surface water will reduce visibility when driving, high-sided vehicles are at risk and the strength of winds could also pose a risk to pedestrians.\"\n\nRestrictions were in place for double decker or high-sided vehicles for some bridge crossings, including the Dornoch Bridge, Tay Road Bridge, Queensferry Crossing, Erskine Bridge, Kessock Bridge and the Forth Road Bridge.\n\nMany ferry services between the Scottish mainland and the Inner and Outer Hebrides were cancelled as a result of the weather.\n\nDozens of flights to and from Scotland were diverted on Sunday because of difficulty landing.\n\nThey included an Easyjet flight from Edinburgh to Bristol which landed in Paris, leaving passengers travelling without passports unable to stay in a hotel overnight.\n\nRyanair flights to Edinburgh were diverted to Cologne Bonn airport in Germany, including a flight from Tenerife and another from Seville.\n\nAn Easyjet flight from Fuerteventura to Edinburgh landed in Manchester and a TUI flight from Sharm El Sheikh to Glasgow declared an emergency and landed in Manchester.\n\nOther planes were diverted to Edinburgh.\n\nBBC Wales presenter Jennifer Jones was diverted to Edinburgh on a flight from Geneva to Bristol Airport.\n\n\"But when we started the descent into Bristol, it was incredibly turbulent and the plane was lurching from side to side,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\n\"I've never been in that kind of turbulence.\"\n\nThe Bristol landing was aborted, but landing in Edinburgh was also \"pretty hair-raising\", she added.\n\nStorm Isha caused widespread disruption in Scotland overnight.\n\nWinds did not turn out to be quite as strong as forecast by the Met Office, which issued a red warning for gusts of up to 100mph in the far north and northeast of the mainland, but they were still very strong.\n\nThe highest gust recorded at a low altitude in Scotland was 84mph at the village of Salsburgh next to the M8 in North Lanarkshire, according to the Met Office.\n\nFallen trees and other debris closed a number of trunk roads including the A1 in East Lothian and the M9 between Grangemouth and Bannockburn.\n\nAll passenger and freight services on Scotland's railways have been suspended until later in the day as crews clear debris.\n\nThe key affected areas include the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway rivers.\n\nPerth Council was closing the floodgates at Perth but levels were not expected to reach those of the October flood event.\n\nMs Hensman warned that peak levels were still expected on the River Tay and the River Spey, with more floods expected in the north of the country.\n\nShe urged people to drive with care and to not walk through flood waters.\n\nShe added: \"Rivers are going to be high all day and possibly into tomorrow as well and we urge everyone to keep an eye on our website which has a threeday public flood forecast and advice on how to prepare.\"\n\nIsha is the ninth named storm to hit the UK since September.\n\nThe Met Office said it was \"very rare\" for an amber weather warning for wind to cover almost all of the UK."
