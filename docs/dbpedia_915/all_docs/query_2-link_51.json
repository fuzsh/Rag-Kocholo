        "text": "4.6/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nOOdyssey02860946819We booked this as we knew our flight home to Glasgow Airport was landing late and we could not face the long drive home at such a time. By the time we cleared with our bags and walked to the hotel from the terminal it was 2am when we checked in. Unfortunately we were given room 115, which was opposite the elevators on the first floor. It was also not only an accessible room with wet bathroom (no shower unless you wanted to flood the whole room) but also had a ”connecting” door to the next room. No idea who was on the either side, but not ideal for either of us given our late arrival. I was feeling extremely tired and and went straight to my bed - unfortunately it was far too soft and it was a double, so we tended to fall into the middle where the ”hole” or ”dip” in the mattress was. With us both trying to sleep on the outside of the mattress for comfort we continually pulled the small duvet from each other in an attempt to keep warm after our return from Africa. The pillows were also too soft for my liking, however that was minor compared to the mattress. There hours later, at around 5am the corridor started coming alive with excited children heading off on their holidays, running and squealing, literally!! I can't blame them for being enthusiastic, but perhaps their parents might have understood that some guests might still wish to sleep at that time? Thus our morning continued so when we finally dragged ourselves up for breakfast around 9am I was extremely tired and somewhat grumpy... Now to breakfast; a fairly good selection was on offer if you came at a quiet time. I saw some guests leave towards the end our meal time as they did not want to wait in the queue for what was left. My main gripe about the breakfast was again, not the hotel's fault, but the guests, who presumably are not used to staying in hotels and don't know what swerving utensils are for. I saw one female guest pick up and touch several slices of bread and returning them before picking what she put in the toaster machine. I purposely picked a slice she hadn't pawed and waited whilst it went through the machine, then just as it arrived a young man (her son I believe) whisked it away in front of me. Manners non existent. The breakfast staff were helpful and friendly and the food on offer was perfectly adequate if all the guests knew how to behave. All in all, we picked this hotel for a catch up sleep after a late flight in and we didn't achieve that so we will not be back.\n\nShow More"
