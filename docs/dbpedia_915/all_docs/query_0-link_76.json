The original line of the Caledonian Railway gave that Company access to Edinburgh and also to Glasgow, and having made a junction- with the Scottish Central Railway at Greenhill’, we also got “This also doubtless led to the Cale¬ donian Railway getting hold of a share of the traffic referred to, and the amalgama¬ tions of 1865 and 1866. strengthened its hold.” ‘‘What about your communication be¬ tween Edinburgh and Glasgow ? ” “ The Caledonian Line from Parlisle to Edinburgh and Glasgow was opened in February, 1848, and having obtained access to the official and also to the commercial capitals of Scotland, the railway naturally sought to improve its means of communica¬ tion between the two. This was success1.

Caledonian Railway to compete successfully with its rivals, and materially added to the Caledonian Railway’s traffic between the Eastern and Western cities.” “ When does the expansion policy of the Caledonian Railway date from ? ” “ The expansion policy, as you are pleased to cal] it, dated back to the inception of the line, for at that time a big scheme of exten¬ sion was foreshadowed, but what have come to be known as the Amalgamation years of the Caledo nian Railway were the years 1865, 1866, and 1867. “ Prior to the year 1865, the Northern termina¬ tion- of the Cale¬ do n i a n R ailway was at Greenhill, about four miles ' south-west of Falkirk, where it joined the line of the Scottish Central Railway.*] “ In that year the Caledonian Railway took over the Scottish Central R a i 1 w ay system, and thus became owner of the railways to Perth, Dundee, and Newtyle, with branches to Denny, South Alloa, Callander, and Crieff. “In the s a me year it also took over the line from Lockerbie, via Loc hmaben, to Dumfries, and the General Terminus Railway, giving access to the south side of Glasgow Harbour. “ In the following year the Caledonian Railway took over the undertaking of the Scottish North-Eastern Railway (itself an amalgamation of the Scottish Midland, Junction, and Aberdeen Railways), extend¬ ing from Perth and Dundee to Aberdeen with branches to Methven, Blairgowrie, Alyth, Kirriemuir, Arbroath, Brechin, and Montrose. “ The Caledonian Railway thus became the owner of the line from Carlisle to Dundee, Perth, and Aberdeen. “ The absorptions of railways by the Caledonian Railway have been numerous, reaching a total of thirty-seven. “ Amongst the absorptions have been the following railways : — Alloa, Arbroath and Forfar, Busby, Crieff andComrie, Clydesdale Junction, Dumfries, Lochmaben, and Lock¬ erbie, Forth and Clyde Navigation, General Terminus (Glasgow), Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge, Green¬ ock, Greenock and Wem y s s Bay, Hamilton and Str a|:haven, L e s m ahagow, Lochearnhead, St. Fillans, and Comrie, Paisley and B arrhead , Moffat, Polloc^and Gov an, Solway Junction, Syming¬ ton, Biggar Brou g h t o n , and Peebles, Scottish Central, Scot t i s h Nort h-Eastern, Wisha w and Coltness. “ The length of line owned by the Caledonian Rail- way at the com¬ mencement of 18 6 5, was only 230 miles; at the end of 1867 it had increased to 57 4 miles.” “ Did this large increase in the mi 1 e a g e of the railway satisfy the directors ? ” “Probably it did, for the time ; but the Caledonian Railway had not got, and these amalgama¬ tions did not provide it with, a port on the east coast of Scotland suitable and convenient for the shipment of coal to the Continent, and elsewhere, from the Lanarkshire coalfields which it served. “ The directors and officers of the railway accordingly turned their attention to get¬ ting such a port where they could control shipping arrangements, and their choice fell on Grangemouth. MR. JNO. BLACKBURN, SECRETARY CALEDONIAN RAILWAY. ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW. 181 “ Grangemouth, at that time, consisted of a tidal harbour and two small docks of between seven and eight acres in extent, and was owned by the proprietors of the Forth and Clyde Navigation. In addition to the port of Grangemouth, the Navigation Company was also the proprietor of the Forth and Clyde Canal, extending from Grangemouth to Glasgow and Bowling, on the Clyde, the Monkland Canal, from Glasgow to Woodhall, near Airdrie, the Grangemouth Branch Railway, from Grahamstown to Grangemouth, the Drum- peller Railway, near Coatbridge, and the Harbour of Bowling. “ As the Harbour of Grangemouth could on the Firth of Clyde, on the boundaries of the counties of Renfrew and Ayr. “ The new railway formed the shortest route between Glasgow and places on the lower reaches of the Firth of Clyde, such as Largs, Millport, Innellan, Toward, Rothesay, Colintraive, • Tighnabruaich, Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Inveraray, etc. “ Prior to the opening of the railway and pier, the great bulk’ of the passenger traffic for the places above named travelled via Greenock. The opening of the W emyss Bay Line revolutionized this traffic. “ At the opening of the Wemyss Bay Line, in 1865, the Caledonian Railway was (apart from private owners of steamers) the only FOULDUB’S MARSHALLING YARD, GRANGEMOUTH, not be purchased without the other parts of the undertaking, the Caledonian Railway became the proprietor of the whole in 1867.” “ What you have just said accounts for the Caledonian Railway being a canal proprietor, and also shows that it became so without any ambition in that direction, but rather by the force of circumstances. “ Apart from the amalgamations, etc., you have mentioned, did the Caledonian Railway make any other forward movement about that time ? ” u The year 1865 also marked the opening of the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Line and pier. “ The line extended * from Port Glasgow on the Greenock Railway, to Wemyss Bay, railway carrying passengers for places on the Clyde. “ From the Old Quay, Greenock boats, in connection with the Caledonian’s trains, departed, carrying passengers chiefly for the upper reaches, while from Wemyss Bay those for the lower reaches were carried. “ But, of course,, this state of matters was not allowed to continue very long. “ The Greenock and Ayrshire Railway Company, in 1865, got authority to construct a railway from Greenock to Johnstone, with a branch towards Glasgow. They also got power to make a station at Princes Pier, Greenock, on the bank of the river. “ The railway and station (now a part of the Glasgow and South-Western Railway) were opened for traffic in December, 1869, and from THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. that date the Caledonian Railway’s traffic for the coast, via the old steamboat quay at Greenock, began to diminish, the Caledonian Railway station at Greenock being several hundred yards from the quay, and the only route between the two being by means of a rather insalubrious lane. “The Caledonian Railway naturally made strenuous efforts to retain the traffic, but they were of little effect. 44 The old route, with its inconvenient transference between railway and steamboat, could not compete with the newer and more convenient route, via Princes Pier. 44 The Caledonian Railway had, there¬ fore, to 4 grin and bear ■’ this loss of traffic.” “ I expect that was not for long, Mr. Millar ; the directors and officers of the way worked and managed by the Cale¬ donian Railway) to Ardrossan Pier, in May, 1890, had a considerable effect on the traffic to the Island of Arran, to Belfast, the Isle of Man, etc. “ Up to that time the traffic to and from these places, via Ardrossan, was served solely by the Glasgow and South-Western Railway. Now both the Caledonian Railway and South Western Railway share in the carrying. The traffic has been largely increased, no doubt, through the increased facilities which have been given. “These facilities consisted of a first-class service of trains by the new railway; and a new pier at Ardrossan Harbour, upon which was built a# new railway station. “Steamers in connection with Caledonian trains arrive at THE ORIGINAL PIER AT WEMYSS BAY PRIOR OP THE RAILWAY. Caledonian Railway have the reputation of not being satisfied with the position of second place ? ” 44 Unfortunately, they had to do so till the new route to Gourock was opened, which put a different aspect on matters. This line was authorised in 1884 and opened on 1st June, 1889, and the traffic which the Caledonian Railway formerly carried on by the old steamboat quay at Greenock, now returned in increased volume to it via Gourock, so that now it can be said that by far the larger proportion of coast traffic is again being carried by the Cale¬ donian Railway, either via Gourock or via Wemyss Bay. 44 While on the subject of 4 coast ’ traffic, it may as well be stated that the opening of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway (a rail¬ steamer, or vice jversaN “The Cale¬ donian Rail¬ way’ S' under¬ ground line across Glasgow was, I assume, constructed for the purpose of providing better facilities for urban transit 1” NO and depart ffcm this pier, and the trains run pr a c tic all y alongside the' steamers, so that every possible convenience exists for the ■ prompt change from train to TO THE CONSTRUCTION 44 That is so. The Glasgow Central Rail¬ way, which was authorised in 1888, and i opened in sections between 1894 and 1896, extends from Dalmarnock, in the East end of Glasgow, to Maryhill and Daws- holm in the North-West district of Glasgow. It is chiefly Underground, running be¬ neath some of the principal streets of , Glasgow. On its route it has stations at Glasgow Green, Glasgow Cross, Glasgow Central, Anderston Cross, Stob cross * (for Queen’s Dock), Kelvinbridge (for the University and Kelvingrove Park), Botanic Gardens, Kirklee, Dawsholm, and Maryhill. 44 The line, which is about six miles in length, was a very costly one, but it enabled the Caledonian Railway to get access to ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW. 183 Queen’s Dock, and so share in the large traffic dealt with there. “ Before the construction of the Glasgow Central line the Caledonian Railway’s only access to the Queen’s Dock was by means of the circuitous route of the North British Railway from Sighthill East Junction. Eor the use of the North British Railway’s line the Caledonian Railway had to pay rather a 4 stiff ’ toll. “ The line was intended to be beneficial as regards passenger traffic, and no doubt this expectation would have been fully realised but for the fact that the conversion of the Glasgow Tramways from horse to electric 'traction has diverted a great deal of short distance traffic from the railway to the tramways.” 44 The extension of the Caledonian Rail- • way along the north bank of the Clyde is terminated at Aber Bay, on the south shore of Loch Lomond. 44 The railway between Glasgow and Dumbarton was passed after a very pro¬ tracted struggle before Parliament, but the portion between Dumbarton and Loch Lomond was rejected. A working agreement had been made with the Caledonian Railway, who agreed to subscribe half the capital and to guarantee a dividend of 4 per cent. 44 The rejection of the Loch Lomond part of the scheme did not please the promoters, and in the following Session they deposited a Bill for authority to make the portion which had been rejected. 44 Before any proceedings took place on the Bill negotiations were entered into between the North British, Caledonian, and Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Rail¬ way Companies with the view of coming THE PRESENT PIER AND RAILWAY STATION AT WEMYSS BAY, one of the important ihodern developments of the system ? ” 44 The building of the Glasgow Central Railway rendered possible the construction of a line, the want of which had been very much felt for a considerable time, viz., a railway from Glasgow to Dumbarton and , Loch Lomond. 44 In 1891 the principal ironmasters, coal- masters, and steelmakers in Lanarkshire, and the shipbuilders, engineers, and other large employers of labour on the north bank of the Clyde between Glasgow and Dumbarton, and the Turkey red dyers in the Vale of Leven, banded themselves together and got authority - from Parliament to make the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway. 44 The railway, as promoted, began with a junction with the Glasgow Central Railway at Stobcross, Glasgow, and ran closely along the north bank of the Clyde to Dumbarton, where it turned up the Yale of Leven, and to an arrangement whereby the duplication of lines in the Vale of Leven might be avoided. These negotiations ended in an arrangement whereby the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway Company was to make a junction with the North British Railway at Dumbarton ; the North British Railway, from the junction of the- Lanark¬ shire and Dumbartonshire Line to Balloch at the foot of Loch Lomond, was to be¬ come the joint property of the North British Railway, the Caledonian Railway, and the Lanarkshire and Dumb artonshire Railway, and the steamers on Loch Lomond were also to become the joint property of those Companies. That arrangement was given effect to by Parliament by the passing of the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Line Act, 1892. 44 The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway was opened, and the Dumbarton and Balloch Line and steamers vested 184 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE . in the three Companies, on October 1st, 1896. “ The opening of the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway has proved of enormous advantage to the district through which it runs. Since its opening works, which formerly were few, h ave now been established all along its route, till there is little land left for other works between Partick and Bowling. “ Into almost every work along the north bank of the Clyde, whether established before or since the openi n g of the railway, there is sidi n g connection with the Lanark¬ shire and Dumb- artonshife Railway, and only a month or two ago a con¬ nection was made from it to the new Rothesay Dock of the Clyde Trustees at Clyde¬ bank, which was recently opened by the Prin cess of Wales. “ TJie tourist traffic on Loch Lomond has also very largely in¬ creased since the Caledonian Rail¬ way acquired an inte rest in the route. Since 1892 two new steamers have been added by the Joint Com¬ panies to the Loch Lomond fleet. “ The construc¬ tion of the Central and L a n arkshire and Du mbarton- shire Railways, the acquisition of a share in the Joint Line, and also a share in the ownership of the steamers on Loch Lomond, have, consequently, opened up a new district to the Caledonian Railway and to the millions of passengers using its line, not to speak of the enlarged area now open to co almas ters, steelmakers, and other kindred trades in Scotland, chiefly served by the Caledonian Railway.” “ From what you have just told me, Mr. Millar, it is evident that the introduction of the Caledonian Railway to the Dumbarton and Vale of Leven districts has been of great benefit to that part of Scotland. I suppose other parts of North Britain have been favoured in a somewhat similar manner by the Caledonian Railway ? ” “ I am afraid we must plead guilty to the impeachment. Take the case of Aberdeen, where, as is well known, we connect with th6 Great North of Scotland Railway. Up to the year 1867, the only connection between the two railways was by the use of rails laid along the quays from our station in Guild Street to the W ater loo station of the Great North of Scotland Rail¬ way, in a different part of the ‘granite city.’ This con nection applied only to goods ; passengers (to use a railway express ion) had ‘ to find their own way ’ between the two stations. “ Recognising the inconvenience of such a connec¬ tion, and its unfit¬ ness for a rapidly- increasing t r affic, the Scottish North- East e r n Railway (the predecessors in that part of the country of the Caledonian Rail¬ way) applied t o Par 1 i a m e n t , in 1864, and got authority to con¬ struct the Denburn Valley Railway, extending from Denburn Junction on the Scottish North-Eastern Line to Kitty - brewster on the Great North of Scotland Line, with a passenger station thereon. The line and station were to be constructed at the joint expense of the Scottish North- Eastern and Great North of Scotland Rail¬ ways, and were to become the property of these two Companies jointly. The line and station were constructed and opened in 1867 MR. H. B. NEAVE, SOLICITOR CALEDONIAN RAILWAY. ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW. 185 the year after the Caledonian Rail¬ way took over the Scottish North- Eas tern Line, and no difficulty- now exists either in regard to the exchange of pas¬ sengers or vehicles of any kind at Aberdeen. “ So much has the traffic grown at Aberdeen stations (both goods and passenger) that the approach lines have been found insufficient to deal with it. “ Consequently, the Caledonian Railway has had to quadruple the lines between Eerryhill Junction and Aberdeen, re-arrange its goods station, lay down a considerable number of sidings at Craiginch.es imme¬ diately south of Aberdeen., and execute other works in * connection therewith. As you know, Mr. Sekon, we have to provide accom¬ modation for the North British Railway at Aberdeen, which has no independent access, but travels over the Caledonian Railway from Kinnaber Junction, 38 miles south of , Aberdeen. The G-reat North of Scotland Railway is also re-arranging its goods station and laying down new sidings, while the two Companies are at present jointly engaged in the construction of a much enlarged and improved passenger station at Aberdeen.” GOUROCK PRIOK TO THE ADVENT OP THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY. “ The Caledonian Railway has also de¬ veloped the western and north-western parts of Scotland ? ” “ Certainly ; mention may be made of the Callander and Oban Railway as an instance of what the Caledonian Railway has done to open up the country, and particularly the Western Highlands and Islands. “ Although the Callander and Oban Rail¬ way is technically an independent company, it has always been worked, managed, and maintained by the Caledonian Railway, which holds a large proportion ot its capital, “Authorised in 1865 from Callander to Oban, it was opened to Tyndrum in 1873 ; the portion of the line from Tyndrum to Oban having been abandoned in 1870. “ The cause of the abandonment was much the same as had led to the abandonment of many other lines, viz. : — want of cash. The Caledonian Railway having come to the GOUROCK PIER AND RAILWAY STATION IN 1907. 186 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. rescue, arrangements were made for con¬ tinuing the line to Oban in substitution for the abandoned portion, and this extension was authorised in 1874. “ In 1878 an extension of the line to Oban Bay, with a pier and sea wall, was authorised. “ The whole works were completed and opened for traffic on 1st July, 1880. The total length of the line from Callander to Oban is pearly 72 miles. “ The line passes through a most pic¬ turesque but very sparsely populated dis- tric t , and the traffic on it, except for a few months in the summer, is not a heavy one.” “ You have no doubt that the construction of the line to Oban has been of benefit to that part of Scot¬ land? ” “While the line has not yielded that return which those who in¬ vested their money in it expec¬ ted, there can be no doubt as to the b e n e fi t it has conferred on the district which it serves, and to the Western Is- lands be yond. It has promoted a tourist tr affic which could not otherwise have been developed, and it has considerably increased the value of the fishing industry in the western seas. “ Lines of steamers run from and to all parts of the western Highlands, and leave and arrive at Oban daily during the season in connection with trains. , “ In 1897 the Callander and Oban Railway obtained powers to considerably enlarge the station at Oban, and also to extend the quay and sea wall there, so as to afford accommodation for the increased number of steamers then plying to and from Oban in connection with the trains. It also obtained powers tp con¬ struct a railway from the line at Connel Ferry, near Oban, to Ballachulish, on the shores of Loch Leven, with a pier on that loch. The length of line is about twenty- eight miles. - . “The railway crosses two arms of the sea. Loch Etive, at Connel Ferry, and Loch Creran, at Cregan. The bridge over Loch Etive is 1,044 ft. in length, built on the cantilever principle, and has a clear headway of 50 ft. above high water level, having one span of 500 ft. in length, which is only exceeded in this country by the spans of the Forth Bridge. The whole works, which were very costly, were opened for traffic in August, 1903.” “Mention of the Forth Bridge reminds me that the C a ledonian Railway also pos¬ sesses a Forth Bridge.” “Our Forth Bridge may be accepted as a proof that the. Caledonian Rail¬ way has always been looking ahead of the times. The bridge gave us access to the town of Alloa. “When the Caledonian Rail¬ way acquired the Scottish Central Railway in 1865, we became the proprietors of the small harbour of South Alloa, on the River Forth, but had no rail connection with the impor¬ tant town of Alloa on the opposite bank of the river. Half-a-mile of navigable water separated the railway from the town. “ In 1879 authority was obtained from Parliament by a number of local gentlemen, who were incorporated under the name of the Alloa Railway Company, to construct a rail¬ way from the Caledonian Railway’s South Alloa Branch, at Dunmore Junction, crossing the River Forth on a viaduct, MR. A. BRAND, CHIEF ASSISTANT TO THE GENERAL MANAGER. ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW. 187 having two opening spans, to the town of Alloa. “ The viaduct is 1,704 ft. in length, and its two opening spans have each a width of 60 ft. These enable vessels to pass through the viaduct with their masts standing. “ The railway was made and opened on 1st October, 1885, from which date the Caledonian Railway ceased to run passenger trains to South Alloa or to work the ferry which it had established between South Alloa and North Alloa. “ The North British Railway, in order to save the detour by Stirling for Alloa traffic, and also to enable it to compete with the new line, deposited a Bill for a scheme to “ The instances of joint lines and other facilities you have mentioned, Mr. Millar, show that the Scotch railways already work in unison at several places. “Doubtless you could name other places where the Caledonian Railway has done a good deal towards developing the trading and travelling facilities of the district ? ” “ Numerous other instances could be given of the general nature of the extensions and improvements of the Caledonian Rail¬ way, such as Leith, but I need not trouble you with more.” “It is generally admitted, Mr. Millar, that the Caledonian Railway has proved itself an iSBrari CALEDONIAN RAILWAY TRAIN AT BALLOCH PIER, WITH LOCH LOMOND STEAMER Prince George ALONGSIDE PIER. cross the river a short distance above the new line. “ Negotiations led to a settlement satis¬ factory to all parties. The Caledonian Rail¬ way gave the North British Railway run¬ ning powers over the Alloa Railway, and undertook to double a portion of the Alloa Branch Railway between the Caledonian Railway’s main line and Dun- more Junction, where the Alloa Railway began. . The Caledonian Railway, on the other hand, got access to the North British Railway’s passenger station at Alloa, and the North British Railway undertook to send a certain minimum traffic over the bridge each year, or to make up what tire minimum would have yielded.” important factor in developing the resources of Scotland and opening up remote parts of the country. Railway Magazine readers are much interested in your views as to the present and future prospects of not only the Caledonian, but of British railways generally.” “ He will be a bold, not to say a rash, man who will forecast the future of the Caledonian Railway, or, indeed, of any other railway in the United Kingdom, if he bears in mind the tendencies of the age. “ For some years past legislation has dealt very harshly with the interests of railway shareholders, everything has had to give place to, what are supposed to be, the in¬ terests of labour. Whether this tendency has at length run its course, and a more 188 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. enlightened view will now be taken in regard to the real interests, not only of shareholders, but also of the workers and of the country generally, remains to be seen. Unless such a recognition takes place very soon, share¬ holders will cease to invest their moneys in railway stocks, as they will then know that such investments will not receive any pro¬ tection from Parliament, if, in the opinion of Parliament, it is necessary to pander to other interests at the expense of the rail¬ ways.

Your final one raises a most im¬ portant point. If wheat appreciates in value, the baker raises the price of bread ; if palm oil is scarce, soap is dear ; a shortage of cotton and wool causes our clothes to be more expensive. Why, then, if the cost of railway operation be increased, because the ‘ raw materia] s ’ (coal, labour, iron, steel, etc.) of railway working are dearer, should ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW. 189 not railway companies be able to act in the same manner as other trades, and raise the price of the commodity they deal in — that is 6 transport ? 5 ” “ I wish we could make onr critics see the point as you put it, Mr. Sekon. “ It may be said that railways can in¬ crease their rates provided they can . show that such increases are reasonable, but all railways know through sad experience what this means, viz. : — that such a thing under the existing law is impossible. “ Railways are not allowed to conduct their business on commercial principles. All other trades raise their prices to meet increased cost of production. Railways are debarred from doing so. “ This may be fair, but it does not appeal t o one as such. “Let the railways have fair play, and, with prosperous trade in the country, there need be little ground for losing faith i n them, but a little more of the legislation dealt out lately, a few more use¬ less^ and expen¬ sive re quire- men t s of the Board of Trade, the i nsistence in the demands for shorter hours at places where the business done will not warrant it, together with further in¬ creases of wages, under similar condi¬ tions, will tell their own tale. “ Let us hope that all parties soon will come to see that the ability of railway com¬ panies to work their railways, so as to give the greatest possible facilities, means in¬ creased prosperity to the country, and to every one in it, for no one is wholly inde¬ pendent of railways. On'Ahe other hand, if they cripple the railway companies in the conduct of their railways, everyone will suffer, be he shareholder, merchant, manufacturer, or worker, for in that case the whole trade and welfare of the country will be adversely affected. Our foreign competitors will be the only gainers.55 “I hope what you have just said, Mr. Millar, will be laid to heart in the right quarter. - “ I greatly appreciate the trouble you have taken to say so much of interest concerning the Caledonian Railway.55 “ The readers of the Railway Magazine might like the -following statistical informa¬ tion, showing the growth of the Caledonian Railway during the sixty years culminating in its Diamond Jubilee : — 1 856 the length was 197 miles 1886 the length was 722* miles 1866 ,, ,, 574 „ 1896 „ ,, 828 ,, 1876 „ „ 753' „ 1906 ,, „ 957 ,, * The Portpatrick Railway, the mileage of which had been, up to 1885, included in the Caledonian Railway’s mileage, then became joint property.

Matheson, M.Ixst.C.E., Engineer -in-Chief. REVIOUS to the year 1835 con¬ siderable progress had been made in the construction of railways in England. The London and Birmingham' . the North Union, , and the Grand Junction Railways were prac¬ tically completed, and formed one grand railway from London to Preston. In that year Mr. Joseph Locke, -the eminent engineer, was asked by the Grand Junction Railway Com¬ pany to survey the country between Preston and Glasgow for the purpose of ascer¬ taining its practi¬ cability fpr the formation of a railway. Mr. Locke reported giving the preference to a line via Dum¬ fries and Niths¬ dale to Glasgow, rather than via Annandale and Lanarkshire (the Caledonian Rail¬ way route), chiefly for the reason that the difference in level bet¬ ween Beattock and the Summit, near Elvanfoot, was 700 feet, which, on a length of 10 miles, would give an inclina¬ tion of 1 in 75, as compared with 1 in 180 to 1 in 200 for a length of 17 miles through Nithsdale, although increasing the distance from Carlisle to Glasgow by tabout 20 miles, and to Edinburgh by about 70 miles. Meantime a committee of Glasgow gentle¬ men had agreed to support the Nithsdale scheme, and after considerable correspon¬ dence and negotiation, the Glasgow/com- mittee for the Nithsdale scheme, and the committee for the line via Annandale and Beattock, agreed that an impartial survey should be made, with the view of ascer¬ taining the best possible line. Mr. Locke and • Mr. John Miller were the engineers appointed to investigate matters, and after long and patient inquiry they reporte d — Mr. Locke on the 9th, and Mr. Miller on the 20th March, 1840 — the former in favour of the Annandale and the latter o f the Nithsdal e route. Meantime the Government had appointed Sir F. Smith and Pro¬ fessor Barlow as Royal Com¬ missioners to report on the question of rail¬ way communica¬ tion between London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, etc. The Royal Commissioners, after exhaustive inquiry, reported on 15th March^ 1841, in favour of the Annandale route, under the supposition that one line of railway only was necessary from the South to Edinburgh and Glasgow. In the interval the railway line had been extended from Preston to Lancaster, and a line authorised from Lancaster to Carlisle. Plans were duly lodged for both the Annandale and Nithsdale lines, and . they MR. DONALD A. MATHESON, M.INST.C.E., ENGINEER-IN-CHIEF. 191 192 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE.

The House of Commons Committee, on 7th May, 1845, met to consider the rival schemes, and a contest was entered upon, which has not since been equalled in railway struggles. Evidence was led at great length, the preponderance of the Glasgow interest being for the Nithsdale line. The Edin¬ burgh interest was divided ; for whilst the Lord Provost was in favour of the Caledo¬ nian Railway, an ex-Provost was against it. Fifteen counsel were engaged on the Bills, and a host of witnesses were examined. The House of Commons Committee, on 3rd June, found the preamble of the Cale¬ donian Railway Bill proved. The Bill was sent to the House of Lords, and the Committee met on 27th June. 115 petitions were presented in its favour, while the promoters of the Glasgow, Dumfries, and Carlisle Railway vigorously opposed. On . conclusion of the examination, the preamble was de¬ clared proved by that House on 5th July, and on 31st July the Bill became law by “ The Cale¬ donian Railway Act, 1845.” A contest was thus ended which cost the Caledonian Railway about £75,000. Acts of Parlia¬ ment were also got in 18 4 5 for the Scottish C ent r al , Scottish Midland Junction, and Aberdeen Railways ta complete through communication from London to Aberdeen. The Caledonian Railway Directors also' made arrangements to acquire the Clydesdale Junction Railway, also- sanctioned in 1845, which gave access to the south side of .Glasgow* and the Clyde. The Caledonian Railway, as author¬ ised under the Act, extends to 122 miles, as follows : — Miles..

The Directors decided to push on the construction of the railway with the greatest vigour, with the result that the first 40 miles, from Carlisle to Beattock, was opened for traffic on the 10th September, 1847, and to Edinburgh and Glasgow on the 15th February, 1848 ; Greenhill to Perth, 22nd May ; to Forfar, 2nd August ; and the Castlecary Branch, 7th August, 1850 ; and Forfar to Aberdeen at various dates from 1st July, 1848, till 1st April, 1850, when the STANDARD CAST IRON CHAIR AND BULL-HEADED RAIL USED ON THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY.

The Caledonian Railway has been increased by the formation of numerous branches and by the amalgamation of the Scottish Central Railway, in 1865, and the Scottish North-Eastern Railway, in 1866, whereby 113 miles and 1494 miles respectively were added to the mileage. The Forth and Clyde and Monkland Canals, 52 J- miles, were added to the undertaking in 1867. The mileage of the Caledonian Railway at present, including canals, joint and worked lines, and lines worked over, is 1.306J miles. To Mr. Locke belongs the credit of laying out the great Scottish national system of railways extending from Carlisle to Aber¬ deen, and connecting the east and west coast shipping ports as in a network. He died at Moffat, on the 18th September. 1860. The honour of originating the Caledonian Railway belongs to Mr. J. J. Hope Johnston* and to Mr. Charles Stewart. The former died at Raehills, on 11th July, 1876, and the latter to look back upon him as a speculator. He was a man of great discernment, and possessing a great deal of courage and rich enterprise ; and owing, perhaps, partly to him and partly to other men, we were bold enough at that day to entertain the idea of making a railway into Scotland ; and the unusual course was adopted by the Govern¬ ment of Sir Robert Peel of appointing a Commission, or a scientific agency, to examine the whole question of what ought to be the line of railway into Scotland ; and the House may be curious to know why it was the Government did so, when, I believe, there is no other example in the entire history of railways of their having attempted anything of the kind. I remember per¬ fectly well the motive of the Government. The motive was that, as it was known, or firmly believed, to be absolutely impos¬ sible that there should ever be more than one railway into Scotland* — it was considered of the highest importance that the best scientific power of the couptry should be brought to bear on the choice of the line.”* at Hillside, near Lockerbie, on 19th July, 1875. The following extract from a speech delivered by the late Mr. Gladstone in the House of Commons, on the 4th May, 1888, during a debate on the proposed acquisition by Government of the railways of the United Kingdom, is interesting : — “ It is almost ludicrous to look back upon the infant state of the whole question at that period when compared with the enormous development it has now attained. As this subject is of great interest, perhaps I may mention a fact which is within, my own knowledge and recollection — a fact of very considerable interest, which is highly illus¬ trative of the manner in which this vast subject has passed beyond the region of all human computation. About the year 1841 or 1842, when I was at the Board of Trade, the question arose whether there could be a railway into Scotland. I think at that time we owed a great deal to a gentleman well known in connection with railways as a very bold and not at all unwise railway projector. I mean Mr. Hudson. It is a great mistake The Caledonian Railway, in addition to the numerous lines and. branches con¬ structed by themselves, has amalgamated over 30 independent undertakings. The more recent extensions of the Cale¬ donian Railway are principally in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, and chief of these are the Glasgow Central Railway, the Glasgow Central Station Extension, the widening of a portion of the Wemyss Bay Branch Railway, and the reconstruction and extension of the station and pier at Wemyss Bay. The reason for constructing the Glasgow Central Railway was threefold. In the first place, there was urgent necessity for forming a through connection between the Caledonian lines on The east side of Glasgow and the extensions towards Dumbarton on the west side, with a connection into the Queen's Dock at Stobcross ; for, prior to the construction of the Central Railway, the Caledonian Railway Company was * The speech at these points was greeted with outbursts of laughter C 194 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. dependent upon the North British Railway Company for access to this dock. Then the congestion in the high level station compelled the Company to provide relief, and it hoped to meet the case in this respect by transferring to the low level station as many as possible of the trains having their destina¬ tion within a distance of about 12 miles from Glasgow. And thirdly, the Central Railway passes under the busiest thoroughfares in the city, and it was confidently expected that a considerable volume of urban passenger traffic would be carried by the “ Under- Dalmarnock Road, Canning Street, London Street, Trongate, Argyle Street, Stobcross Street, Kelvingrove Park, Great Western Road, and Botanic Gardens, and emerging into the open again at Kirklee. The junction at Strathclyde with the Dalmarnock Branch is a little to the north of the River Clyde at Rutherglen station, which had to be enlarged to accommodate the trains terminating there. The design of the station buildings at street level received very special consideration, in some cases these structures having the effect of decidedly BELL-MOUTHED TUNNEL AT STOBCROSS STATION, GLASGOW. The view shows the junction of the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway (on the left), with Glasgow Central Railway (on the right). ground.” This expectation might have been realised had the Glasgow Corporation not taken over the tramways and electrified them ; but, immediately the conversion was made from horse to electric traction, the bulk of the urban traffic that the “ Under¬ ground ” had gathered during the first years of its existence was speedily lpst. The Glasgow Central Railway was authorised in 1888, and in the following year it was vested in the Caledonian Railway Company. It extends from Strathclyde, near Rutherglen, to Maryhill and Dawsholm, a length of about seven miles, passing under improving the amenity of the surrounding \\ districts, and in this connection mention might be made of the booking hall of Glas- , gow Cross station, designed by Mr. John J. Burnett, F.R.I.B.A., A.R.S.A., and the similar building at Botanic Gardens, de¬ signed by Mr. James Miller, F.R.I.B.A., A.R.S.A., and shown in the photograph on page 195.

Maryhill station is a through station for the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Rail¬ way traffic, and a terminus for the Central Railway trains. The other terminus at the west end of the railway — viz., Dawsholm — serves the exten¬ sive Gas W orks belonging to the Corporation, and the Company’s running sheds are also sithated near it. As showing the great develop¬ ment of traffic on the Cal edonian Railway within recent years, it may be stated that, immedi¬ ately after Central Low Level station was opened for traffic in August, 1896, the High Level station was still found to be congested. The Company was therefore, again obliged to con¬ sider how ac - commo dation could best b e provided for the enormous number of trains that were required for the ever- increasing traffic, and the result of the deliberations was the Caledonian Railway (General Powers,) Act, 1899, which provided for the extension of Glasgow Central station as far as Hope Street on the west side, and the construction of a second bridge over the River Clyde. It may be interesting at this stage to consider the development of the Caledonian Railway’s terminal stations in Glasgow. The genesis of the system now embraced within the Caledonian Railway was the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway extending from its junction with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (the first public pas¬ senger railway in Scotland, opened in 1826) at Gartsherrie to St. Rollox, Glasgow, the access to the city station being from Glebe Street, near the north-east boundary of the city. This line was opened for traffic in 1831. Simultaneously with the construction of the line from Carlisle to Garriongill, there were being constructed the Clydesdale Rail¬ way from Motherwell to the Pollok and Govan Railway at Rutherglen, and the Gushetfaulds Branch Railway from the Pollok and Govan Railway to South Side station. These lines were completed and opened for traffic in June, 1849, when the English traffic was worked into South Side station. In the meantime an extension of the Garnkirk Railway from Milton Junction to Buchanan Street station was being con¬ structed, and on its completion in November, 1849, the English traffic was transferred to Buchanan Street station, where it continued to be dealt with for 30 years. In addition to Buchanan Street station in the north of the city and South Side station EXTERIOR OF BOTANIC GARDENS STATION, GLASGOW. 196 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE . in the south, the Caledonian Railway had had a terminus at Bridge Street since 1841, adjoining the south bank of the River Clyde, which was used for the traffic from Greenock and the coast, and at a later date — that is, from 1865 — for the traffic from Wemyss Bay. As the city developed on the north side of the river, it was found that South Side station was too far removed from the centre of traffic, and a Bill was promoted in Parlia¬ ment for an extension from Gushetfaulds to Gordon Street, with a terminal station at the latter point. The Act was obtained in 1873, and amended in 1875, and under its powers Glasgow Central station, immediately to the south and on the level of Gordon Street, was constructed and opened for traffic in 1879, when the English traffic was transferred fo it from Buchanan Street station. The latter station has continued to the present day to be used for all the North traffic, and a few local trains to Motherwell and Hamilton. In 1890 Glasgow Central station was extended by widening the bridge over Argyle Street and lengthening the platforms in a southerly direction, and this enabled the Greenock and Wemyss Bay trains to be worked into Central station, Bridge Street station then becoming a through station, the dock lines thenceforth being used for the storage and cleaning of carriages. The last extension of Glasgow Central station was authorised, in 1899, and com¬ pleted in 1905, and, as a result, Bridge Street station has been abolished as a passenger station. The Caledonian Railway has, therefore, now only two terminal passenger stations in Glasgow, viz., Buchanan Street station for the North traffic, and Central station for the East, South, and West traffic. St. Rollox and South Side stations are go'ods depots, while the area formerly occupied by Bridge Street station is, covered with running lines and carriage sidings. The ticket collecting station for Glasgow Central is Eglinton Street, which is at presen t being widened by the construction of two additional through lines and the corres¬ ponding platforms. Prior to the commencement of the exten¬ sion and reconstruction of Glasgow Central station in 1899 the station contained nine platforms, aggregating 1,530 yds. in length, and covering an area of 6,250 sq. yds., while the concourse measured 550 sq. yds. (illus¬ trated on page 197). The station was approached by four lines of rails, carried on a bridge over the River Clyde. As showing the magnitude of the extension works, it may be stated that the aggregate length of the 13 new platforms is 2,910 yds., or about If mile, and they cover an area of 14,000 sq. yds., while the area of the con¬ course is 3,000 sq. yds. Although the length and the area of the old platforms have been practically doubled, this has not been obtained by doubling the. number of platforms, but by increasing their width from 15 ft. to a minimum of 23 ft., and adding four new platforms. A feature of the extension is the main departure platforms for trains for the South, which measure 900 ft. in length and 30 ft. in width, and the long and spacious main arrival platforms measur¬ ing 800 ft. and 700 ft. respectively in length, and 70 ft. across, and consisting of a cab rank 30 ft. wide in the middle and two side platforms, each 20 ft. wide. There is also a special platform nearly 1,000 ft. in length and 33 ft. in width, at which two trains may be dealt with simultaneously, as in the case of some of the platforms in Victoria Station, London, the permanent way being so laid out that the rear train can depart while the front train is standing at the platform. At : the south end of the cab rank there is a special double-sided platform for fish, fruit, and milk traffic, the object being to keep these classes of traffic separate from the. passenger traffic. This platform is situated over Broomielaw, adjoining the quay on the north side of the river, and, while there, is' vehicular access to it by way of the station cab rank, there is also communication with the street below by means of hoists. The essential features of the station exten¬ sion are — (1) a great increase in the area ofj the concourse; (2) a doubling of the plat¬ form accommodation by adding to the^ length, width, and number ; (3) the con¬ struction of a new bridge over the River Clyde ; and (4) the conversion of the dock lines in Bridge Street station into through running lines and storage sidings. The incidental engineering works in con¬ nection with the carrying out of the scheme were the substitution of built steel octagonal columns for the masonry wall on the west, side of the old station, the roofing of the new' part of the station, the extension of the roof covering the old part of the station, the reconstruction of Argyle Street Bridge, involving the difficulty qf carrying the foundations to a depth of 45 ft. below street level in order to be beyond the disturbing effects due to drainage of the Underground Railway ; the raising of the old bridge over ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT . 197 the Kiver Clyde, the construction of low level lavatories under the concourse, the construction of a parcels office at street level under the station, and the provision of a conspicuous train information screen, a left luggage room, a shop parcels room, and the other necessary station offices. Glasgow Central station, although having direct access at the north end from Gordon Street on the level, is structurally a high level station ; for, while the streets parallel to the station fall in a southerly direction, the station rises in the same direction, with the result that the rails are so high above the with the planning of the arrangements, which was overcome by setting the centre line of the concourse in a direction running from north-east to south-west, with the Gordon Street entrance at the north-east end and the Hope Street entrance at the south¬ west end. The accesses to the station, while they remain as before, viz., one in Gordon Street, one in Hope Street, one in Argyle Street, and one in Union Street, have been entirely reconstructed, and in their recon¬ struction they have been made more spacious and convenient. The subways in connection with the Hope Street and Argyle Street THE 1899 NEW YEAR’S CROWD AT GLASGOW CENTRAL STATION first transverse street — viz., Argyle Street — as to give a clear headway of 18 ft. The greater part of the rise between Gordon Street and Argyle Street is obtained in traversing the booking hall and the con¬ course, although it is not appreciably felt by passengers using the station ; on the other hand, the gradient of the rails from the buffer stops to Argyle Street is 1 in 185. From Argyle Street southwards, as far as the works extend, the gradients are practically level. The shape of the ground available for the station being narrower at the main entrance from Gordon Street than near the middle, gave rise to an initial difficulty in connection entrances call for special notice, for, instead of being narrow, as is usually the case, the main portions are really in the form of halls and well lighted, with the result that the cramped feeling pertaining to the usual sub¬ way is altogether dispelled. As already stated, the main entrances to the concourse are at the ends, so that pas¬ sengers have to walk along it in order to reach their train. Advantage has been taken of this circumstance to place the train information screen in an unobtrusive but conspicuous place on the north-west side of the concourse immediately over the general waiting room and telegraph office. This 198 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. screen has a separate space for each of the 13 platforms, and, besides exhibiting the hour at and the number of the platform from which the train starts, it also indicates the name of every station at which the train stops. At another portion of the screen information is given in regard to arriving trains. The concourse is surrounded by the usual station offices. The extension of the station to the north of Argyle Street has a sub-structure of steel¬ work, the area at street level being used for the very large parcels traffic dealt with at Central station. There is a cart road inside the parcels office similar to that in a goods The pillars are lintelled, in order to afford a bearing for the open web lattice main girders, which are spaced at about 12 ft. centres. ' Hobson’s flooring rests on the top booms of the main girders, and presents a flat, uninter¬ rupted surface for the permanent way. The great width of the new bridge, which is 110 ft. on the average, necessitated the main ■. girders being entirely under the floor ; and, in order to give the statutory headway over the river, and at the same time have an economic depth of girder, the rail level on the new bridge had to be made higher than the original rail level on the old bridge, which consists of two main girders for each span . THE NEW BRIDGE CARRYING THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY ACROSS THE CLYDE AT GLASGOW shed, and the vans are loaded and unloaded at a raised platform. There is communication by means of passages, and a series of hoists between the parcels office and the station platforms overhead so arranged as to obviate the necessity of wheeling barrow-loads of parcels across the concourse in order to get to the several platforms. The new bridge over the River Clyde and the adjoining streets (illustrated above) is an imposing structure of five spans, the lengths of the three river spans being 160 ft., 200 ft., and 178 ft. respectively. There are two land piers and two river piers, consisting of steel caissons sunk to a depth of about 50 ft. and 66 ft. respectively below high water level. and flooring resting on the bottom booms. , The difference of level was as much as 3 ft. / at the north end and 2 ft. at tjie south end, but this difference has been eliminated by | raising the old bridge. The old bridge carries four lines of rails, and the new bridge nine lines of rails ; that is to say, there are now 13 lines of rails across the river, the two bridges thus affording probably the widest railway crossing of a river in the world. Through Bridge Street station there are 1 7 lines of rails in all, made up of eight running lines and nine carriage sidings. These carriage sidings are calculated to afford great ' help in connection with the working of traffic in the Central station, especially on holidays, engineering department. 199 as they are long enough to con¬ tain whole trains, which will be propelled a c r oss the bridge into the station as the plat¬ forms are vacated by other trains. The roof over the new part of the station and the extended roof over the old part of the station are unlike the old roof, inasmuch as the bottom boom of the main girders i s semi- elliptical in form instead of being straight. The result is that the roofs have, per¬ haps, the appear - ance of being loftier than they really are, and the effect of the vista, especially in the case of the roof over the extended portion of the station, which i s nearly 1,000 ft. long, is very marked. The roof couples, are semi-circular on the s o fh t r and spring from the vertical members of the main girders. All the plat¬ forms, with the exception of those adjoining the cab rank, are shut oh from the concourse with wrought iron rail¬ ings and gates. Hydraulic buffers have been pro¬ vided for all the 13 lines of rails. There is an installation of 25 clocks throughout the station, controlled electric¬ ally from a master clock placed in the telegraph office. The points and signals are still being worked manually, but an installation of the electro-pneumatic system of power working is in course of being laid down. In the year 1899 an Act was obtained to widen the Wemyss Bay Railway from a single to a double line over its whole length, and to extend and enlarge the pier at Wemyss Bay. Only six miles, however, have been doubled, viz., the length of two miles from the junction to a point just beyond Upper Greenock station, and the length of four miles from Dunrod passing place, through Inver kip to Wemyss Bay station. The work involved the driving of additional single-line tunnels at Cartsburn and Inverkip alongside the existing single- line tunnels, the construction of viaducts over the Rivers Kip and Daff , and the recon¬ struction and enlargement of the stations at Upper Greenock, Inverkip, and Wemyss Bay. Fortunately, all the overbridges had, in the first instance, been built sufficiently wide for two lines of rails, and considerable expense was thereby saved when the doubling came to be carried out. A t W emyss Bay station (illustrated on page 200} there has been a veritable transforma¬ tion. For, whereas the old station had only two platforms and very limited waiting room accommodation, the new station has a com¬ plete suite of waiting rooms and other offices, and four passenger lines adjoining two island platforms, with a third road between the two main roads to allow of an engine rounding its train at rest at the platform. The convenience of this arrangement is in¬ estimable when it is remembered that the steamers and the train arrive at Wemyss Bay simultaneously and exchange passengers. The permanent way of the Caledonian Railway may safely be said to be up to the standard of that of the premier railways of Great Britain, and it is maintained in such condition as to ensure the absolute safety of the travelling public. A section of the standard permanent way of a double-line railway in cutting is shown on this page. The slopes of the cutting, which is 32 ft. 4 in. wide at formation level, are not steeper than 14 to 1, and are covered with soil to a depth of 4 in., and sown with grass seed. The formation has a fall of 5 in. from the centre towards the sides, so that all rain water that ' does not percolate into the ground is led into 200 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE ■. the side ditches, which are formed at the toe of the slopes. The need of thorough drainage of the permanent way is clearly recognised, and good fall and ample drains are therefore provided. The ballast consists of good, old, hard and clean iron works’ slag, and of broken granite, the bottom ballast, which occupies the space between formation and a level 2 in. below the underside of the sleepers, being broken to pass through a 3-in. ring, and the top ballast to pass through a 1^-in. ring. The depth from the upper surface of rails to formation at the centre is 2 ft. The sleepers, which are of Baltic redwood or Scotch fir, creosoted, are 9 ft. long by 10 in. wide by 5 in. thick, and are spaced at 2 ft. 8J in. apart centre to centre, except at the joints, where the spacing is 2 ft. 2-| in. The cast iron • chairs, weighing 46 lbs. each (see illustra- chains radius, and on all curves the outer rail is superelevated to an extent varying from 5 in. for a 10 chain curve to If in. for an 80 chain curve. The superelevation of the rail is full at the tangent point and constant round the curve, and is run out on the straight at a gradient of about 1 in 600. The strength of the permanent way has undergone a considerable change since the opening of the Garnkirk Railway in 1831, when the fish-bellied malleable iron rails (illustrated on page 193) were supported on cast iron chairs, weighing 8 lbs. each (see. illustration on page 192), and spiked into transverse sleepers placed 3 ft. apart; In those days the “ George Stephenson,” built by Robert Stephenson and Company, and weighing 8 tons, was the standard loco¬ motive. In later years, wdien locomotives weighing 63 tons for a length of 47 ft. 5 in. THE PRESENT RAILWAY STATION AND STEAMER PIER AT WEMYSS BAY tion on page 192), are attached to the sleepers by means of four spikes |- in. in diameter and 5f in. in length. The bearing area of the chair on the sleeper is 104 sq. in. The rails are in lengths of 32 ft., the section used for main lines weighing 90 lbs. per vd., and that for branch lines 80 lbs. per yd. They are securely held in the chairs by means of oak keys, 7 in. long by 2-| in. deep by 2-J- in. wide. The joints in the rails are made with pairs of fishplates 18 in. in length and weighing 22 lbs. per pair. The holes in the fishplates are pear-shaped to fit the neck of the bolts, which are J in. in diameter and 4J in. in length, and of which there are four to each joint. Between the nut of each bolt and the fishplate there is a Grover washer, which prevents the nut from working loose. Guard rails are used on curved portions of running lines under 15 over the buffers were introduced, the weight of the rail was 75 lbs. per yd. It was subse¬ quently increased to 80 lbs., and since 1880 it has been 90 lbs., the weight of the heaviest locomotives being now 130 tons for a length of 65 ft. 6 in. over the buffers. All the constituent parts of the permanent - way are thoroughly and systematically inspected before being put into the line. This is especially the case with rails, upon which the safety of the travelling public depends to such an extent. Their manufac¬ ture is watched in all its stages, from the mixing of the metal in the furnace to the straightening and drilling, with the result that practically all defects are eliminated, and there is obtained a homogeneous material able to withstand the severe strains- to which it is subjected by the heavy locomotives. / THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY’S DIAMOND JUBILEE. The Evolution of the Rolling Stock By J. F. McIntosh, Locomotive Superintendent. 'N no phase of its successful career does the Caledonian Rail¬ way show to better advantage than in the efficiency of its rolling stock — both past and present. Of course there were railways in Scotland prior to the advent of the Caledonian, and as the result of judicious absorption of and amalgamation with a number of these pioneer lines, dating from 1831 — on some of which the con¬ cluding chapter of the battle of “the locomotive versus the horse ” had been fought the Caledonian Railway from time to time found itself in , possession of an extensive variety of nondescript and even freak vehicles. There were wagons which carried excursion traffic when not required for coal ; open seatless carriages in which unpro¬ tected passengers had to struggle with the elements and live sparks from the engine, getting sometimes pitched overboard into the bargain ; and locomotives bearing such fanciful names as Lucifer , Mercury , Sirocco, Hercules, etc. Some of these had wooden wheel centres, others had upright cylinders and crossbeams, and frequently they be¬ came so incapacitated as to necessitate temporary replacement by horses. - A certain proportion of these antiquated legacies was subsequently allowed to end their days naturally in the by-paths of the system — for money at| times was not too plentiful wherewith to have everything spic and span — but to a large extent there was a wholesale “slaughter of the innocents the pity, however, is that some of the quaintest of these relics were not preserved as object lessons of rebuke to unreasonable grumblers of a later day. But to come to Caledonian Railway plant proper. The Company emerging triumphant from the trying Parlia¬ mentary enquiry anent its forma¬ tion, and wisely realising that great things were expected of it, considered that in the matter of rolling stock the best was not too good for them, and, accordingly, that memorable morning sixty years ago, when the first part of the line was o pe n e. d , found them exceedingly well equipped, considering the period. Whilst the earliest Scotch wagons con¬ sisted of small rouglTboxes holding but a few hundredweights, the Caledonian Railway commenced with substantial vehicles, 11 feet long by 2| feet deep, and bolding 6 tons of general goods, or from 4| to 5 tons of loose coal, as well as open trucks for sheep and cattle, and small covered vans. As busi¬ ness prospered, specially designed vehicles were early provided for specific traffic such MR. J. F. MCINTOSH, LOCOMOTIVE SUPERINTENDENT. 2J1 202 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. as miik, fish, ale, timber, bar-iron, pig-iron, cheese, bullion, etc. ; and, lest it be presumed that looking ahead is a purely twentieth- century faculty, it must be re¬ corded that in addressing the shareholders in the report for the half year ending January , 1858, Mr. Christopher Johnstone, the then General Manager, alluded with pride to the fact that a thirty-ton wagon had been put on the line, presumably, as an experiment. Gradually the capacity of the standard merchandise wagon rose successively to seven, eight, ten, and then sixteen tons. In recent years the Caledonian Railway led the way with the introduction of 30-ton chandise and mineral stock, there is at present on the line 903 fifteen-ton rail wagons, 133 thirty- ton bogie bolster wagons, and 86 trucks specially suited for large machinery, girders, boilers, ingots, glass, furniture vans, etc., with carrying capacities ranging from 10 to 50 tons. Amongst the latest built varieties are 40- ton hopper mineral wagons, motor-car vans, refrigerator vans, tramway car wagons, 20- ton goods brake vans to control heavy trains, etc. Eight years ago the Caledonian Railway put a 50-ton wagon in traffic ; but, although found to be very useful, it so far remains the sole representative of its race.

From the peculiarly varied nature of the territory traversed by the line, it goes without saying that a list of the industries carried on really makes an epitome of the trade of the country, and to foster these multitudinous activities has always been the policy of the Caledonian Railway, particularly in providing means of transport suited to the purpose, be the commodity live fish from the hatcheries, steamboats in sections, dynamite, dangerous acids, wild animals, race horses, prize cattle, export locomotives, or any of the countless engineering productions, of the most fantas¬ tic shapes and perplexing dimensions, etc. Besides what are termed ordinary mer- probably it is a case of taking time by the forelock. As regards passenger rolling stock, the first style of carriage on the Caledonian Railway was the four-wheeler, measuring 18 ft. long and 5 ft. 6 in. high inside. It con¬ tained four compartments, with 19 in. by 15 in. door lights, and 16 in. by 10 in. quarter lights, the doors being 19 in. wide. Each compartment had an oil roof lamp, was ventilated by three narrow slits above the doors, and accommodated eight passengers, or 32 per coach. In this connection it is interesting to recall the fact that so far back as 1848 the late Queen Victoria, accompanied by the Prince Consort and their young family, were so THE EVOLUTION OF THE CALEDONIAN ROLLING STOCK. 203 THE EVOLUTION OF THE LOCOMOTIVE ON THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY.

Notwithstanding, these early coaches- — with their primitive equipments — left much to be desired, which time was to accomplish nowhere earlier than on the ^ Caledonian Railway. The modest four-wheeler gradually gave place to six-wheeled ones, and these again were superseded by sweetly swaying coaches, 45 ft. long, running on four-wheeled bogies, and subsequently increased to 48 and 50 ft. in length. More light by day and by night was gradually available, and cushions, and sitting, and breathing space kept pace in the march of progress. To-day the Caledonian Railway’s standard carriages are of two varieties, corridor and non-corridor, 65 ft. and 68 ft. long, running on six-wheeled bogies, both replete with all the fittings and conveniences that skill and art can devise, and that money can provide, as everyone knows who has patronised them. They have very aptly been termed “ the triumph of luxury and comfort.” Some of these coaches seat comfortably 132 passengers each, and a large number of trains running locally include breakfast, luncheon, tea, and dining cars.

At the outset it was open to the railway to avail itself of the almost general and easy method of ordering so many engines at a certain price from outside locomotive builders ; but, having a very difficult line to work, they were taking no chances. In point of fact, a portion of their route, namely, the well-known Beattock bank, rising about 700 ft. in 10 miles, was at first pronounced to be insurmountable by locomotives, and the suggestion was made, in all seriousness, to work it by stationary engine haulage, but the directors disdained such a movement. Still, the inevitable result followed, and this incline has been a tremendous handicap all along. The directors, therefore, with character¬ istic enterprise, decided that the Company should design and build its own engines, which, accordingly, was done in its work¬ shops (then at Greenock) during 1846 and 1847, in readiness for the opening. Mr. Robert Sinclair, who subsequently filled the dual position of locomotive super¬ intendent and general manager to the Cale¬ donian Railway, was then in charge of the EARLIEST TYPE OF CALEDONIAN RAILWAY WAGON. THE EVOLUTION OF THE CALEDONIAN ROLLING STOCK. 205 locomotive department, and the class of engine he designed for the occasion — and in which he incorporated the best features of the finest models then at work— was a con¬ spicuous success. It had six wheels, the middle pair being single drivers 6 ft. in diameter, the leading and trailing wheels 3 ft. 6 in. It had outside inclined cylinders, 15 in. diameter and 20 in. stroke. The heating surface was 770 sq. ft., grate area 10J sq. ft., steam pressure 90 lb. per sq. in., and the tractive force 2,344 lb. The tender was carried on four wheels, 3 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and the tank held 800 gallons of water. The engine and tender, in working order, weighed 28 tons. To detail the evolution of the Caledonian Railway’s locomotives during the 60 eventful years that are gone, or even to merely mention the various types, is out of the question in this brief “ impression.” After all is said, a railway is judged by the performances of its main line express passenger engines. Only these, therefore, will be‘ noticed in quick review and by decades. The progress made in the 10 years succeed¬ ing the opening of the line is represented by Mr. Sinclair’s 16 in. bv 20 in. by 7 ft. single engine (Rig. 3 of the illustration on page 203), which was a carefully designed enlarged edition of his first. In it he had increased the diameter of the cylinder by 1 in., and the tractive force (or pulling power) by 3,141 lbs. Representing the second decade is Mr. Benjamin Conner’s 17 in. by 24 in. by 8 ft. 2 in. single engine (Fig. 4). Another inch had been added to the diameter of the ctdinder, and 4 in. to the length of piston stroke, the tractive force being increased by 1,559 lbs. This stately engine, with its monstrous and ' steady stride, was long the admiration of the whole country. Shortly after its appearance an eminent firm of locomotive builders, by permission of the directors, built and ex¬ hibited — as a specimen of their handiwork— for London’s International Exhibition of 1862, an exact replica, which was quickly purchased by the late Khedive of Egypt. So far ahead had Mr. Conner seen that we . find this same class of engine, with but slight modification, still maintaining the prestige of the Company in the third decade — that is to say, for a period of, roughly, 20 years. But by stress of circumstances, consequent on the great increase in train loads, it had, perforce, to fall back in the ranks during the fourth decade in favour of Mr. Dugald Drummond’s 18 in. by 26 in. by 64 ft. four- THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. , 206 coupled engine (Fig. 5) which, shows an advance of an inch in the cylinder’s diameter, 2 in. in the stroke, and 5,856 lb, in the tractive force. One of this class was shown at the Edinburgh International Exhibition of 1886. In the fifth decade Mr. John F. McIntosh, the present locomotive superintendent, ably maintained the rate of progress by his 19 in. by 26 in. by 6J ft. four-coupled “ Dunala- stair ” class (Fig. 6), in which an additional inch had been added to the diameter of cylinder and 3,940 lb. to the tractive force. By adopting this type of engine for their International express service a few years ago, the Belgian Government paid the Caledonian Bailway a unique compliment. It was within this epoch that Caledonian engines took part in what is known as the record railway run in this country, when the West Coast tourist express travelled from Euston to Aberdeen — 541 miles — in 512 min., on August 22nd, 1895,. the Caledonian engine completing the last section at a sustained speed of 71 miles 62 chains per hour. Just now, at the close of the sixth decade, we have Mr. McIntosh’s 20 in. by 26 in. by 6J ft. six-coupled “ Cardean ” class (illus¬ trated in the coloured plate, issued with this number of the Batlway Magazine), built last year, in which has been added still another inch to the diameter of the cylinder and 4,493 lb. to the tractive force. It has been described by the technical engineering journals as “ one of the most notable types of passenger engine now running in Great Britain,” and is too well known to require further comment. To witiless “ Cardean,” or any of its sister engines, not like the 6J ton engine “ George Stephenson ” at the opening of the oldest part of the Company’s system (the Garnkirk Line) in 1831, “ with a prodigious load equalling nearly 20 times its own weight, advancing with perfect freedom and with the speed of a stage coach,” but with a 350 ton West Coast express climbing the 10 mile Beattock bank in 16 min., and not merely from a level, but actually from a 1 in 200 ascending slope, is to see as fine a performance as can be done anywhere. The progress for the 60 years noted above is well summarised in the table at the top of page 207. To put it in another, and, perhaps, the most graphic way, is to show the gradual increase in the size of boiler (the most potent factor), and the corresponding curtailment in the height of chimney, as is done in the 60 YEARS’ INCREASE OP BOILER AND DECREASE OP CHIMNEY OP CALEDONIAN RAILWAY LOCOMOTIVES, THE EVOLUTION OF THE CALEDONIAN ROLLING STOCK. 207 Six Decades in the Evolution of the Caledonian Railway’s Locomotives.

Other standard classes of the present day are the following : — taxing of the whole range of engineering resources, and the wonder is not at the con¬ stant increase in efficiency, but that it has been possible during the latest decade to make greater advance than in any that preceded it. The aggregate tractive force of the Company’s stud of locomotives now stands at 13,606,953 lb., and, taking double shifting into account, the engines daily in steam average 1,040, whilst the miles run by engines totals 28,456,047 per annum.

THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY’S DIAMOND JUBILEE. 6o Years’ Development of Passenger Train Services. By G. Calthrop, General Superintendent. ROM an old chronicle it appears that in the year 1818 — the year that Glasgow, with its population of 100,000, first experienced the benefits of “ illuminated spark¬ ling gas ” — 15 public coaches left and returned to the city daily. These coaches included His Majesty’s mail carriages, and their destinations embraced London, Edinburgh, Perth, Ayr, Paisley, Greenock, Hamil¬ ton, and Kilmar¬ nock. A coach for Carlisle and another for Lanark also left and returned to Glas¬ gow, three times a week. Fifteen coaches to accom¬ modate the whole passenger traffic to and from a great town ! ! These few stage coaches were the only means by which the public could travel to distant parts of the country, and, useful as they were, their day was then fast coming to an end, as already great activity was i being shown in the promotion of railway schemes, and a few years later the last coach was consigned to oblivion ; but not so its name as, unconsciously, or, perhaps, as a “ sop to Cerberus,” the rail¬ ways annexed and applied it to designate one of their greatest departments, viz., the “ Coaching Department,” the development of which we are now describing. We have referred, not inappropriately, perhaps, to Glasgow, as the history of the “ City of St. Mungo ” is indissolublyrasso- ciated with the progress of the Caledonian Railway, and the Company rightly claims a great part of the credit for the proud position which Glasgow has attained as the second city of the Empire. The first Cale¬ donian passenger station in Glasgow was situated a t Townhead depot — the terminus o f the Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway. The illustration on page 210 shows the primitive structure, from which five pas¬ senger trains, almost entirely composed of open carriages, left the city in summer, and four in winter, for the Garnkirk and Coatbri d ge direction. At the outset (1831-32) the number of passen¬ gers dealt with at St. Rollox station amounted, approxi¬ mately, to 200 per day ; by 1836 the number had i n - creased almost to 500, and continued to rise during the 18 years the station was in use. By 1849 the line had been extended by means of a tunnel to Buchanan Street, Glasgow, where passengers were conveyed in preference to Townhead. The first “ Junction ” of the Caledonian Railway— Carstairs — will also ever remain an important place in the eyes of the railway 209 D MR. G. CALTHROP, GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT. 210 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE. world, as it was there that the first sod of the Caledonian Railway was cut. Three trunk lines of railway meet there, viz., the Carlisle Line, the Edinburgh Line, and the ‘Glasgow Line, and the first sod of each of these lines was turned on the same day, with great ceremony and popular joy. A spade and barrow used on the interesting occasion are still preserved at Carnwath House, for some time the summer residence of Mr. Irvine Kempt, the late general superin¬ tendent of the Caledonian Railway. Similar enthusiasm greeted the running of the first passenger train between Beattock and Carlisle on September 10th, 1847. In view of the opening of the line, the Caledonian Railway time table, consisting of one sheet (vide illustration on page 212), had been issued, and under its auspices the first train run over the railway, which was driven by the late George Graham, the chief engineer of ^ the Caledonian Railway, made the journey from Beattock to Carlisle without a hitch. Three trains were booked, but only one in each direc- tion carried third - class passengers, the others being reserved for the favoured first and second classes. The fares were mentioned, and it was indulgently allowed that “ children in arms unable to walk should pass on free.” The first year after the opening of the Garnkirk Railway — 1832 — the total revenue amounted to £6,476, including the carriage of goods and mineral traffic, and of this it may be estimated that the passenger revenue did not exceed £2,000. By 1849 the revenue from passenger traffic of the Caledonian Railway alone amounted to £104,792.' In 1859, 522 season tickets, all told, were in operation, and the total coaching revenue amounted to £253,490. In another 10 years 6,983 season tickets were in use during the year, and the passenger traffic revenue rose to £633,127, while the number of passengers carried was almost nine millions. In 1879 the number of season ticket-holders totalled 12,821, over 13 million ordinary passengers were carried, and the total coaching revenue came to £890,985. In 1889 over 22 thousand season tickets were in use, and 19 million passengers were carried, while coaching revenue totalled £1,047,412. During the year 1906 the season tickets numbered 65,657, and over 40 million ordinary ticket-bearing passengers were carried, while the revenue amounted to £1,654,790. The resolution of the directors in the early ‘ seventies 5 to bridge the river Clyde at the Broomielaw, and create a great terminal station at Gordon Street, where all the South, East and West Coast going trains could be concentrated, was, perhaps, the most important step ever taken in the history of the Caledonian Railway. The cost ran up to one million, but the shareholders have no reason to regret the result. A few figures to illustrate the growth of traffic at the Central station will provide food for reflection : — Central Station, Glasgow. (Working with 8 platforms.)

In 1906, working with 13 platforms, about 600 trains required accommodation daily, and close on 20 million of passengers had to be handled during the year. Passenger Train Services. It is curious to recall that as recently as 1888 the fastest West Coast train between London and Edinburgh and Glasgow took 10 hours to do the journey, and that was evidently considered quite satisfactory. The principal trains appearing in the table then were Glasgow (Central) Edinburgh (Princes Street) London (Euston) . . London (Euston) . . Edinburgh (Princes Street) Glasgow (Central) Now the same journey is accomplished with ease in 8, 8J, and 8J hours, notwith¬ standing the heavy loads carried and the difficult gradients encountered. The principal trains now are : — a.m. Glasgow (Central) . . dep. 10 0 Edinburgh (Princes Street) • • 99 10 5 p. m. London (Euston) . . arr. 6 20 a. m. London (Euston) . . dep. 10 0 p. m. Edinburgh (Princes Street) . . arr. 6 15 Glasgow (Central) • • „ 6 15 It takes almost double the number of trains now than in 1888 to accommodate the traffic, and the speed will compare favourably with the performance on any other line here or elsewhere. A corresponding acceleration has been achieved on the other main line services between Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen. For many years one of the trains on this section occupied the place of ho nour for the highest booked speed in Britain. This refers to the 8 p.m. train Aberdeen to Glasgow and London, timed to run 32J miles, Forfar to Perth, in 33 min. It is difficult even yet to find any point to point run to beat this. A little over two years ago the Caledoniari Railway placed the famous ‘ Grampian Corridor Train ’ on the Aberdeen.* section, and provided luncheon and dining accom¬ modation, a facility which had long been desired on this route. The time occupied by the 4 Grampian Corridor 5 is 3 hrs. 42 min. from Glasgow to Aberdeen, and 3J hrs. returning.

There is no doubt that the splendid fast trains in conjunction with the equally fine steamers provide facilities for the public, not to be seen away from the Clyde. Recently, also, the time table was revised to greatly shorten the journey between 212 THE RAILWAY MAGAZINE , Edinburgh, Glasgow and Oban, where a new summer train, christened the “ G. & 0. Hotel Express,” is one of the popular features. It reduces the journey from Glasgow to Oban to 3J hrs. Practically the same tale could be told of almost every section of the line where it is possible to develop a traffic, but so much has Caledonian Railway’s tourist express running from Euston to Aberdeen in 8 hrs. 32 min. In addition to the working of the passenger trains, two other very important matters ape dealt with in the General Superintendent’s offices ; these are the parcels traffic and the advertising of the railway.
