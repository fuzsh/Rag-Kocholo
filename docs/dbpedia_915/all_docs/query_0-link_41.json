        "text": "07:56, 24 May 2016\n\nUpdated 07:58, 24 May 2016\n\nBy Julie Gilbert\n\nA southern extension would see the Subway reach Castlemilk, taking in Shawlands, Pollokshaws and Cathcart along the way.\n\nMedia Scotland\n\nGlasgow Subway A petition calling on the Glasgow Subway to be extended and brought into line with other cities has already attracted thousands of signatures\n\nThe Think Outisde the Circle campaign says unlike other cities such as New York, London and Paris, Glasgow has never extended its original single line system first built in 1896.\n\nThey have suggested adding four extra lines.\n\nA southern extension would see the Subway reach Castlemilk, taking in Shawlands, Pollokshaws and Cathcart along the way.\n\nAnother line running through the centre of the existing circle would create new city centre stops on the Broomielaw, Lancefield Quay and the SECC.\n\nThis line would head west to Clydebank with stops at Whiteinch and Yoker. It would also head east finishing at Carmyle and stopping at Bridgeton.\n\nAnother line heading north west would finish at Maryhill. And a line would also be created going all the way to Paisley.\n\nHowever, campaigners are keen to hear from Glaswegians about where they would like to see the Subway extended to.\n\nThey have launched a Glasgow Subway Map Design Competition and are asking people to design a map and share it to their Facebook timeline .\n\nAn online tool for creating the map is available here .\n\nThe opening of the Glasgow subway in 1896 So far 3694 people have signed the Think Outside the Circle petition calling on Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and Scottish minister for Transport Humza Yousaf to extend the Subway. The petition can be viewed here .\n\nCampaigners say extending the system would provide \"a lifeline to isolated communities\" and that its current small size is causing the Subway to be underused.\n\nAlthough modernisation work is currently underway to upgrade the existing Subway stations, campaigners say: \"The Subway is not accessible to the majority living in Glasgow and as a result is underused for a city of its size.\"\n\nOne of the new modernised stations They also say an extended Subway system would reduce reliance on cars and make for cleaner air.\n\nThink Outside the Circle also say that current fares on the Subway are out of kilter with other cites. In Glasgow a single fare is £2, while in Paris a single is 1.80 and in Madrid it is 1.50.\n\nIt is interesting that Castlemilk gets a mention here. Castlemilk was/is one of the largest housing schemes that was built at the same time in the 1960s with Drumchapel and Easterhouse. Drumchapel and Easterhouse has some access to heavy rail, but Castlemilk has never had that at all as far as I am aware. Perhaps maybe due to Castlemilk being built on steep hills?\n\nFurthermore, the article suggests reusing the remnants of the Glasgow Central Railway between Bridgeton Cross and Carmyle, and Finnieston and Maryhill Central. It also suggests taking over the Cathcart District Railway for the Castlemilk route.\n\nI feel that the CDR and the remnants of the Lanarkshire & Ayrshire Railway Newton to Neilston sections could or should be converted to tram operation. with tram conversion, the route could leave the original formation at Whitecraigs, continue along the main Ayr Road to Mearns Cross, swing down Barrhead Road to Crookfur, then rejoin the original formation at Patterton.\n\nAhh... fun with crayons.\n\nWell, first of all, I love Glasgow very dearly. But to compare it to New York, London and Paris is a little bit baffling. That said, expansion of the Subway would be brilliant and I'd support it, if the plans were right. These plans are just odd.\n\nThe map looks incomplete. The North-East ends of both the Green and Red lines are going nowhere. I mean, the Red line appears to be taking over the Springburn branch and going up towards Bishopbriggs, and the Green line appears to be going towards the Northern parts of Easterhouse, but since they haven't named any proposed stations I can't tell for sure.\n\nA lot of this seems to be mere duplication of existing heavy rail lines. In the case of the Paisley Canal line, for example, that perhaps seems sensible. It's a short line that could benefit from extension to Paisley Gilmour Street, and it would free up space in Central High Level for expansion elsewhere. But replicating the North Clyde Line between Partick and Clydebank (albeit with slightly different stations) seems utterly pointless to me. OK, it takes a more southerly route, but in reality the stations are all within a few minutes of the North Clyde Line.\n\nThe proposed Red line seems to take a very convoluted route through the centre, and I wonder if people bound for Queen Street (Buchanan Street surely?) would be faster changing to the Inner Circle at West Street than they would staying on the red line. I know they're trying to serve the Gorbals, but I'd imagine a better way of doing so would be to have the Gorbals on a branch line to Rutherglen. Furthermore, some of the distances between stations in the City Centre are miniscule. Nelson Mandela Place to Queen Street would rival Leicester Square to Covent Garden in its absurdity - using a generous estimate it would be a distance of about 453ft according to Google Maps! Indeed, here's Buchanan Street Station viewed from Nelson Mandela Place! At least Central to St Enoch (at 0.2mi, equivalent to Leicester Square - Covent Garden) has the laudable aim of linking Central to the Subway network.\n\nOn the plus side, I do like the idea of reopening the Botanics line towards Maryhill (albeit without a pointless stop at Nelson Mandela Place!), and the Southern branch of the Yellow line going to the Airport and Paisley is actually a link that I would strongly support. It would be well used, it would take traffic from the M8, it would be a feasible link to the Airport, it serves Renfrew, it serves Braehead, it serves SGUH, and it all links back to PYG station making it an absolutely ideal route.\n\nSo, on the plus side:\n\n1) A new route to Paisley via Govan, Renfrew and the Airport makes sense.\n\n2) I'd like to see the Botanics line reopened.\n\n3) Perhaps a sensible plan for Paisley Canal and Cathcart to be removed from Central to free up space.\n\nThe rest is nonsense."
