        "text": "Railway station in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\n\nInverurie railway station is a railway station serving the town of Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is managed by ScotRail and is on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line, which is mostly single track north of this point, between Kintore and Insch. It is measured 16 miles 72 chains (27.2 kilometres) from Aberdeen.[5]\n\nHistory\n\nThe first station, then called Inverury, was opened on 20 September 1854 on the Great North of Scotland Railway main line which ran between Aberdeen Waterloo and Keith stations. It was situated 805 metres (880 yd) south of the present station.[3] In 1856 it became the junction station for the new Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway branch line to Oldmeldrum. Renamed Inverurie in 1866, it was replaced in 1902 with a new building with three platforms at the present location close to the Inverurie Locomotive Works which was then being built.[7] The station ceased to be a junction station in 1931 when the branch line was closed to passengers although freight traffic continued until 1966.[8]\n\nThe station, Category B listed, is single storied and has a cupola with windvane.[8][4]\n\nInverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway\n\nSee also: Old Meldrum railway station\n\nThe branch line to Oldmeldrum was opened by the Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway company in 1856 and ran via Lethenty to Old Meldrum station (as it was then called). A proposed extension to the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway was considered but this was never built. The line was closed for passengers in 1931.\n\nFacilities\n\nBoth platforms are equipped with shelters, help points and benches. Platform 1 also has a staffed ticket office, a ticket machine, separate waiting room and bike racks, which is also adjacent to the car park. There is a step-free access path at the end of the platforms, although there is also a footbridge in the centre of the station.[9]\n\nPassenger volume\n\nPassenger Volume at Inverurie[10] 2002–03 2004–05 2005–06 2006–07 2007–08 2008–09 2009–10 2010–11 2011–12 2012–13 2013–14 2014–15 2015–16 2016–17 2017–18 2018–19 2019–20 2020–21 2021–22 2022–23 Entries and exits 109,824 127,779 154,103 175,934 195,139 223,566 292,408 345,790 403,950 451,854 501,646 534,462 533,972 511,708 488,950 355,824 339,064 78,358 242,450 288,356\n\nThe statistics cover twelve month periods that start in April.\n\nServices\n\nAs of May 2022, the stations sees approximately 1 train every 2 hours between Aberdeen and Inverness, calling at all stations, as well as an hourly shuttle to Montrose. One per day continues to Edinburgh Waverley and one to Stonehaven. There are additional shuttle services between here and Aberdeen to fill gaps in the service, giving 2 - 3 trains per hour between here and Aberdeen.[11]\n\n2018 improvements\n\nService frequencies improved here from 2018 as part of the timetable recast funded by Transport Scotland. A new \"Aberdeen Crossrail\" commuter service was introduced from here to Montrose, which calls at all intermediate stations en route once per hour.[12] There are now at least two departures each hour to Aberdeen, with the existing through services to Inverness, Edinburgh & Glasgow maintained or increased in number. A £170 million project to upgrade the Aberdeen to Inverness route saw the line from Aberdeen redoubled in between June and August 2019.[13]\n\nPreceding station National Rail Following station Kintore ScotRail\n\nAberdeen to Inverness Line Insch Kintore\n\nFrom Montrose ScotRail\n\nAberdeen Crossrail Terminus Historical railways Kintore\n\nLine and station open Great North of Scotland Railway\n\nGNoSR Main Line Inveramsay\n\nLine open; Station closed Terminus Great North of Scotland Railway\n\nInverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway Lethenty\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBrailsford, Martyn, ed.
