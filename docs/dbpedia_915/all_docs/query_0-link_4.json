        "text": "Whitecraigs Railway Station (referred to as An Creagan Bàn in Gaelic) lies on the Cathcart Circle Line in East Renfrewshire, 1¼ miles (2 km) southwest of Giffnock and 1½ miles (2.5 km) northeast of Newton Mearns. It opened on the former Lanarkshire & Ayrshire Railway in 1903. The station has two platforms, connected by a steel-plate overbridge and a pretty brick-built station building. Now operated by ScotRail, Whitecraigs Railway Station is staffed part-time and is used by around 320,000 passengers per annum (2017). It is preceded by Williamwood Railway Station, a mile (1.5 km) to the east northeast, and followed by Patterton, a similar distance to the west."
