        "text": "Whitecraigs Scout Group receive expertise from Mactaggart & Mickel Homes\n\nMactaggart & Mickel Homes Ltd has a longstanding relationship with the 171st Glasgow (1st Whitecraigs) Scout Group, having regularly supported its Summer Fairs and also on one occasion dispatched CEO Ed Monaghan as a volunteer to help paint the Scout Hall’s exterior.\n\nWhen the Scout Group was recently looking into some much-needed insulation works to the roof of their Broomcroft premises, which has been their home since 1953, they realised that there was untapped knowledge, skill and insight available to them via their previous supporter Mactaggart & Mickel Homes, and they submitted an application via the company’s Building Communities Fund requesting practical and advisory assistance in lieu of funds. Contracts manager for Mactaggart & Mickel Homes, George Dow, was only too happy to oblige and met the Scout Group leader Andrew Grant, along with group chair Jeremy Smart, at the Scout Hall to inspect the roof structure himself.\n\nGeorge’s recommendations, to install a sheeted ceiling and make better use of the rafters space for insulation, was very gratefully received. The detail of the new ceiling configuration will now be investigated and developed by Architectural Manager Chris McWilliams of Mactaggart & Mickel’s Architectural team, based on George’s measurements and photos, for onward submission to an insulation contractor.\n\nDundee construction projects build community benefits\n\nMajor construction projects in Dundee have boosted the local economy by more than £55 million, a new Dundee City Council report reveals.\n\nA wide ranging capital programme including V&A Dundee, the new railway station, primary and secondary schools, new housing and development of Waterfront sites has used nearly 75% of local labour, councillors will be told.\n\nA report outlines how hundreds of employment opportunities, apprenticeships and work experience opportunities have been created across the projects as a result of the council’s community benefits policy, which is set for an update.\n\nThe report will be considered by the policy and resources committee on Monday June 25.\n\nOfficial opening of Loanhead Railway walking and cycling path extension to Shawfair\n\nLocal councillors, community groups and residents from Lasswade, Danderhall and Shawfair have been celebrating the official opening of a new walking and cycling route extending the existing path from Roslin to Lasswade onto Shawfair, following the completion of a £2.1 million project.\n\nP6 pupils from Danderhall Primary school joined Councillor Lesley Macinnes, transport and environment convener for City of Edinburgh Council, at the opening ceremony of the Loanhead Railway Path – a 3km traffic-free extension along a disused railway - links communities living in Lasswade, Danderhall and Shawfair.\n\nThe route has been developed over the past two years by Sustrans Scotland in partnership with City of Edinburgh Council, Midlothian Council and contractors RJ McLeod.\n\nAs part of the end of project celebrations, residents and businesses from the area attended a ribbon cutting event with speeches from Sustrans and Councillor Lesley Macinnes.\n\nIt is hoped the new path, which is being funded by Transport Scotland through Sustrans Scotland’s National Cycle Network development fund, will encourage residents and visitors to explore the area by foot and bike.\n\nThere are plans to deliver an additional link to Gilmerton Road in the near future, with artists engaging the local community to develop a series of artwork sculptures on the new path section.\n\nMud, sweat but no tears as Cruden Group raises £28,500 for Beatson Cancer Charity\n\nThe Cruden Group is celebrating its 75th anniversary by raising £28,500 for Beatson Cancer Charity after more than 50 dedicated staff took part in the 5 mile, 13 obstacle Tough Mudder Half assault course this weekend.\n\nHaving already raised more than £6 million for worthy causes through its Cruden Foundation which was founded in 1957, the company is looking to add to its already impressive CSR history with a bumper fundraising year in 2018.\n\nMore than 50 staff members signed up to participate in the Tough Mudder with some 20 supporters also travelling to the event at Drumlanrig Castle in Thornhill, Dumfries & Galloway. Each Cruden team member had an individual fundraising page, while non-participating staff backed the campaign with personal donations and by spreading the word to their own contacts. Staff raised £24,750, while Cruden Group contributed a further £75 per head (£3,750 total) in celebration of its diamond year.\n\nThe overall total for the Team Cruden Tough Mudder campaign is confirmed at £28,500, smashing its original target of £10,000, and a cheque will be delivered to Beatson Cancer Charity this week.\n\nBeatson Cancer Charity supports people affected by cancer through a range of services, funding specialists, research and education aimed at creating a better-cared-for journey for cancer patients and their families.\n\nLivingston development given new lease of life by Bield\n\nA retirement housing development in Livingston has undergone a major revamp to improve and modernise the main entrance and foyer area, and reconfigure many of the flats to allow much improved standards of living.\n\nBield’s Restondene development, in the Deans area of the town, has seen eight of its 26 apartments converted from bedsits into more modern one-bedroom flats with open-plan living and kitchen arrangements.\n\nThe front entrance and foyer area have also been updated to provide a more modern and welcoming approach.\n\nWith works recently completed by Holytown-based Rodgers and Johnston Ltd, the project has received positive feedback from existing tenants commenting on the high quality finishes and enhanced foyer area.\n\nOriginally built in 1977, Bield took ownership of Restondene in 1996 through a stock transfer. Today, the development offers safe and secure homes designed especially for those aged 50 and over.\n\nThe £119,000 investment is part of Bield’s Asset Management Strategy which will make improvements to its existing stock across Scotland to ensure older developments are accessible and continue to meet the needs and aspirations of existing and future customers.\n\nPeebles affordable housing plan unveiled by SBHA\n\nScottish Borders Housing Association (SBHA) is planning to build six new affordable homes in Peebles.\n\nProposals for the new 2-bedroom flats, which would be situated at Glensax Road, were agreed at a recent meeting of SBHA’s Board of Management, and will be submitted to Scottish Borders Council for approval this summer.\n\nScottish Borders Council has also designated Peebles as currently having a high level of housing need and has incorporated the Glensax Road site in its current Strategic Housing Investment Plan (SHIP). This means it has been scored against criteria such as demand, deliverability, strategic fit and equalities impact and it can therefore be considered for grant funding from the Scottish Government.\n\nThe site includes garage plots in Glensax Road and tenants of the garages have been sent letters to advise them that there are plans to re-acquire the garages. This letter also explains the expected timeframe for development so as to give the garage Tenants as much notice as possible.\n\nUK: Government publishes consultation on combustible cladding ban\n\nThe UK government has announced a consultation on banning the use of combustible materials on the external walls of high-rise residential buildings which are 18 metres or over.\n\nThe consultation, which will run until August 14, is inviting views on proposals to revise the building regulations to ban the use of combustible materials in the inner leaf, insulation and cladding that are used in external wall systems on these buildings.\n\nIn the wake of the Grenfell Tower fie in June 2017, the government commissioned former Health & Safety Executive chair Dame Judith Hackitt to lead a review of building regulations, specifically exploring fire safety aspects in tall residential buildings. Following her comprehensive review of fire safety and building regulations, Hackitt recommended that a simpler but more robust approach to the construction and on-going management of high-rise residential buildings was needed.\n\nThe government, however, said it wants to ensure that there is no doubt about which materials can be used on high-rise residential buildings."
