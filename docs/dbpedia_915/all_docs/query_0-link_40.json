        "text": "Clarkston railway station is a suburban side platform railway station in the town of Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the East Kilbride branch of the Glasgow South Western Line. It was opened in 1866 by the Busby Railway.\n\nHistory\n\nThe station was opened by the Busby Railway on 1 January 1866. Services were subsequently extended through to East Kilbride by the Caledonian Railway two years later and eventually to High Blantyre (on the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway), though the section beyond East Kilbride closed back in the 1940s. A further pair of connections to the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway were subsequently constructed around 1903-4 by the latter company, though only the south to west one saw regular traffic and even then for just a few months.\n\nProposals put forward by British Rail in the early 1980s would have seen the former south to east curve reinstated to allow East Kilbride trains to be re-routed via Muirend, Cathcart and Mount Florida to Glasgow Central. The scheme would have seen the branch electrified but the Clarkston to Busby Junction portion would have been closed, along with Giffnock and Thornliebank stations. The plans were not well received and were eventually dropped.\n\nServices\n\nThe station has a half-hourly service in each direction (including Sundays) to Glasgow Central and East Kilbride.\n\nPreceding station National Rail Following station Busby ScotRail\n\nGlasgow South Western Line Giffnock Historical railways Busby\n\nLine and station open Caledonian Railway\n\nBusby Railway Giffnock\n\nLine and station open\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nButt, R.
