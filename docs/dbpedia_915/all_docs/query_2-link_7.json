        "text": "Network Rail is assessing damage left to its network, left by Storms Isha (Sunday) and Jocelyn (Tuesday), with Scotland receiving the worst weather. With winds of up to 65mph hitting on January 23, and up to 80mph on January 21, the Scottish network was shutdown early ahead of both storms, with planned services terminated in a \"controlled shutdown\", according to Network Rail.\n\nServices slowly re-started again this morning, as engineers inspect railway lines for damage, using 'proving trains' for most routes, with a helicopter for the Kyle of Lochalsh line. Currently, 95 per cent of Scotland’s Railway is open.\n\nFollowing damage left to the network on Sunday night, Network Rail worked to clear debris spread across the network. This afternoon (January 24), Network Rail Scotland tweets, \"Crews still inspecting the Far North Line by train, Kyle of Lochalsh line by helicopter and Dumfries - Kilmarnock by train. River levels at Dalguise are preventing the reopening of the Highland Mainline from Pitlochry – Perth.\"\n\nBy noon, the lines between Aberdeen and Inverness, Dundee, Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow were re-opened. However, Network Rail has to liaise with train operators to reintroduce services, adding, \"This will take time as they work to get trains and crews into position.\"\n\nStorm Isha damage\n\nThe damage found this morning seemingly appears better than that facing Network Rail Monday morning, after Storm Isha brought severe weather conditions to all parts of the UK network. The 70/80mph gusts were felt most on Scotland’s Railway Sunday night (January 21), as it closed many of its lines from 1900 that evening.\n\nDebris was found across the network Monday morning. \"We've just found (what remains of) a garden shed on the line at Bellgrove station in Glasgow. If you live next to the railway, please secure garden sheds, trampolines and patio furniture as best you can,\" tweets Network Rail Scotland as Storm Isha hit.\n\n\"Good news, the huge tree that fell onto the overhead wires at Whitecraigs station has been removed, and we’ve repaired the damage as well. Well done team!\" Network Rail Scotland adds.\n\nDebris left by Storm Isha is cleared, final inspections take place across many routes, though delays to routes impacted by OHLE damage continue.\n\nOn Monday, chainsaw teams and specialist overhead line engineers from Network Rail began to clear trees and repair damage to power lines on multiple routes.\n\nEngineers encountered 'significant issues' on lines where falling trees damaged the overhead line equipment, including:\n\nAt Croftfoot in Glasgow\n\nBetween Easterhouse and Garrowhill\n\nAt Gartcosh\n\nBetween Holytown and Bellshill\n\nAt Queen Street station, work to remove a fence that was blown over and overhanging the railway took place, and teams removed a metal shed that was blown on to the line at Bellgrove, a garage roof that was blocking the line at Kirkwood, and an advertising board that fell on to the line at the Exhibition Centre in Glasgow.\n\nSome of the scenes left by Storm Isha can be seen below:\n\nFallen trees are the major causes of disruption, as seen here on the Wick line. Note that the tree wasn't growing on railway property. Lines equipped with OHLE in similar scenarios are experiencing longer disruptions to services.\n\nThe scene at Arrochar & Tarbet, on the West Highland Line, Monday. Debris is cleared for a patrol locomotive to move forward, with crew arriving by road to deal with the rest.\n\n\"On arrival at Gartcosh, we discovered this huge tree. It caused a small fire and has significantly damaged our overhead line equipment and fence. Many thanks to\n\n@fire_scot for their attendance.\" tweets Network Rail Scotland in the early hours of Monday, as Storm Isha continued.\n\nLiam Sumpter, route director, Network Rail Scotland, said: “Storm Isha has caused a huge amount of damage across Scotland’s Railway.\n\n“My thanks go to our teams, who’ve been working around-the-clock to remove fallen trees and debris while carrying out both minor and major repairs to damaged infrastructure.\n\n“While we are continuing to re-open routes when it is safe to do so, we unfortunately expect even more disruption in the coming days as Storm Jocelyn arrives in Scotland.\n\n“We’re also urging lineside neighbours to make sure that garden furniture and equipment is secure as in high winds, this can blow on to the railway, causing damage and disruption.”"
