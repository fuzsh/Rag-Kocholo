The Met Office is promising a drier and brighter day for many. But the travel disruption caused by the storm is set to continue through Sunday, with warnings not to travel on parts of the rail network. Simon Calder, Travel Correspondent of The Independent, has been checking the transport system on Sunday morning.\n\nNetwork Rail says the routes linking Edinburgh with Inverness and Aberdeen will be badly affected by severe weather all day, and that speed restrictions will apply on other lines. “Major disruption to services in Scotland is expected until the end of the day,” is the message.\n\nAnyone who makes it to Edinburgh may find their problems are only just be beginning, because the East Coast main line is heavily disrupted.\n\nSaturday was chaotic on the line linking Scotland, northeast England and Yorkshire to London, with King's Cross station closed for a time because of the sheer number of passengers trying to make journeys, and many of those people will be back to try again on Sunday – only to find delays and cancellations, including a number caused by staff shortage.

This evening’s overnight sailing will be at least four hours late.\n\nin the Western Isles, the main problem is residual disruption from Friday and Saturday on Caledonian MacBrayne ferries. The company had planned an additional pair of sailings between Ullapool and Stornaway to clear traffic from previous cancellations, but this has now been cancelled due to a technical issue with the vessels sewage system. And the first sailing from Tarbert to Uig is cancelled.\n\nOn the Channel, DFDS Ferries says “all services are currently operating with delays due to strong winds in the Channel”. The advice is to check-in as normal and you will be put on the first available sailing to Calais and Dunkirk.\n\nLeeds Bradford airport was closed for 24 hours on Friday and Saturday, and knock-on disruption is continuing. Some planes overnight arrived at Leeds Bradford many hours late, and consequently there are further delays for departures today.\n\nInside the Scottish town evacuated as Storm Babet threatens record rainfall\n\n07:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nHundreds of Scots have been told to evacuate their homes amid warnings Storm Babet could pose a “danger to life”.\n\nResidents of 335 homes in Brechin, Scotland, were asked to leave for “their own safety” during Storm Babet, which is battering parts of the UK on Thursday.\n\nAlexander Butler reports:\n\nInside the Scottish town evacuated as Storm Babet threatens record rainfall\n\nICYMI: Body found after woman, 57, swept into Angus river\n\n06:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nThe body of a 57-year-old woman has been recovered from a river in Angus, where a red weather alert is in force, Police Scotland said.\n\nThe discovery made as Storm Babet bore down on the country, bringing high winds and “unprecedented” volumes of rain, forcing a town to be evacuated.\n\nJane Dalton reports:\n\nStorm Babet: Body found after woman, 57, swept into river\n\nICYMI: Four people trapped on car roof amid Storm Babet floods rescued by Nottingham fire service\n\n05:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nNottingham Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) helped four people trapped on car roof after floods to safety on Thursday 19 October as Storm Babet engulfed the Midlands.\n\nOn Friday, an amber weather warning for rain was in place for some parts of northern England including Yorkshire and Manchester, as well as some of the Midlands, including Nottingham.\n\nRescues efforts have been extended as three people have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded during Storm Babet.\n\nVia social media platform X, NFRS warned people not to put their lives and those of the fire services at risk by attempting to drive through flood water.\n\nWatch part of the rescue here:\n\nFour people trapped on car roof amid Storm Babet floods rescued by fire service\n\nICYMI: More flooding feared after ‘unprecedented’ rainfall from Storm Babet\n\n04:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nCommunities in Scotland are braced for more flooding after Storm Babet brought “unprecedented” rainfall and a red warning was extended.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf warned of continuing dangers as he paid tribute to two people who died.\n\nRescues took place throughout Friday as hundreds of houses were flooded after the River South Esk breached its banks.\n\nSarah Ward reports:\n\nMore flooding feared after ‘unprecedented’ rainfall from Storm Babet\n\nHow the extreme weather is affecting trains, flights and ferry services\n\n03:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nTrains, planes and ferries are being affected by Storm Babet – which, warns the Met Office, will bring “exceptional rainfall and impactful wind for some”.\n\nForecasters have issued a red warning for rain for parts of eastern Scotland, affecting Angus and Aberdeenshire.
