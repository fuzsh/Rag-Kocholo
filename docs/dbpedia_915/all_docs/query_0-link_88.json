They are performed once every 10 years. Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes. The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses. The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 50 people in Scotland. This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building. You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking \"Show Census Area Covered\" below the map above.\n\nUsing this Information Commercially\n\nThe information we provide on the website is done so without charge. However, if you wish to use this data on other websites, or in any other public medium should consult our data sources page for information on how you should correctly attribute the information.\n\nSocial Grade\n\nSocial Grade approximations are derived from an algorithm created by the Market Research Society. The figures shown are per-household rather than individual - more specifically, the job title and employer of the \"household reference person\" is used, analogous to what traditionally was called the head of the household. Only household reference persons between the ages of 16-64 are included.\n\nSocial Grade AB - Higher and intermediate managerial, administrative, or professional positions 2 C1 - Supervisory, clerical, and junior managerial/administrative/professional positions 18 C2 - Skilled manual workers 11 DE - Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers; those on state benefit/unemployed, & lowest grade workers 24\n\nTotal 55\n\nGender Back to Top\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the gender split is roughly 49% male, 51% female. This part of the Ardrossan ward however contains significantly more women than average (58%). This can be caused by a number of factors, but amongst the most common are large establishments such as boarding schools and convents, and areas with older populations.\n\nFemales on average live longer than males, so are more likely to be found in retirement areas. In general, as people age, they move away from city centre addresses to suburbs, smaller towns and rural locations, so these areas often show a greater number of females, with inner-city areas showing the opposite trend.\n\nGender Male 73 Female 100\n\nTotal 173\n\nAge Groups Back to Top\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the median age is 39. In general, inner-city areas show high concentrations of people aged 18-30, suburbs show larger numbers of small children and adults aged 30-50, and rural and small towns are more popular with older workers and retirees. Many poorer areas lack a majority age group, which is due in part to the people in that area being constrained by circumstance rather than being able to choose where to retire, raise a family or grow up.\n\nAge Groups 0-4 14 5-7 9 8-9 6 10-14 8 15 3 16-17 2 18-19 5 20-24 14 25-29 17 30-44 35 45-59 24 60-64 10 65-74 19 75-84 5 85-89 2 90+ 0\n\nTotal 173\n\nRelationship Status Back to Top\n\nThe postcode KA22 7EF does not show a significant deviation from the average figures for the UK.
