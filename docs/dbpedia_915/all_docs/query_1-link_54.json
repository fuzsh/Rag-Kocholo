Why was the Neilston line truncated?\n\nIt seems strange to cut it off from the G&SW so close to the junction at Barrhead rather than retain it as a through route if needed\n\nYour geography is a bit off, I'm afraid. There wasn't a junction at Barrhead, though there were multiple junctions further south around Lugton. Remember that the current Barrhead line was built by one company (eventually the Glasgow & South Western) and the Neilston line was built by a different one (Caledonian Railway). The two companies were in deep competition for the Clyde Coast traffic, with the Caledonian very much the second best option.\n\nThe Neilston line wasn't even conceived as a passenger route originally. It was intended as a freight route from the Clyde to the Motherwell area. As first built, at Cathcart there was no connection from the Neilston route to Cathcart station and Glasgow. Instead, the Neilston line joined the Kirkhill route to the east of the junction right at the southwest end of Cathcart station. The current junction arrangements were installed later. See: http://www.scotcities.com/cathcart/intro.htm for maps and a nice view of the former goods yard adjacent to Cathcart station.\n\nThe line closed beyond Neilston simply because there was not much reason to keep it. Passenger traffic to the Clyde coast was concentrated on the faster, more direct GSW route after nationalisation while freight traffic declined steeply here, as elsewhere, after the lorry market was deregulated in the mid-1950s. So the line reverted to a purely suburban role, with a long, rather rural tail from Whitecraigs to Neilston. Subsequent building around Patterton (Newton Mearns) has changed the line's passenger potential there out of all recognition, but the Neilston section remains delightfully rural.

I'll rephrase to \"I'm not sure of the purpose of this whole section\" then.\n\nFor me personally, I do appreciate the areainfo section of the Wiki very much when it includes a nice, full size image of the simulation. In the old days when you had to go and find a sim and download it in order to open it up these pages were really useful for deciding on which sim to play next and it meant you didn't have to install any exe sims to check them out, or clutter up your loader menu with loads of sims you didn't even have licenses for or any intention of playing (in those days of course, sims you didn't have licenses for weren't shown in pink). Now, of course, sims basically download themselves and it may seem like these pages are a little redundant. But I still really appreciate them, because it can take time to load up a sim and comparing three or four at a time in order to decide what to buy is so much easier when you can just have the pictures open in some tabs in your browser. Unfortunately no such image has been added to Catchart's new page, but I definitely like this whole section. I also found the difficulty rating a nice little guide when I was new to SimSig, although I disagree with some of the classifications. As it happens I was only just a few minutes ago whiling away some of my precious, limited time on earth flicking through this section of the wiki, and I definitely think Portsmouth deserves an intermediate rating and I'd nominate Salisbury and WembleySub for consideration for promotion too :P\n\nHmm yes, but my point was why there are separate pages that duplicate much of the manuals themselves. Why not put the pictures and anything not currently in the manual into the manual?\n\nWell I suppose it's a synopsis? A handy guide for when you're deciding what to buy next. And then the manuals, which can be long and detailed, go into the operating instructions for when you actually have the sim. But certain information could well have a place in both, like a brief overview of the area is nice when selecting a sim and it also has an obvious place in the introduction of the manual.\n\nI myself have never made a contribution to the wiki so I don't know what the original intention was or whether we couldn't improve things a bit, or whether Cathcart's areainfo page could be improved, but I definitely see the value in the areainfo pages for getting buyers interested and helping users select the next sim they wanna get their teeth into (donationware or payware) or looking back through old sims they've already played to decide which ones they might wanna have another go at. Or even for pure reminiscing. And I wouldn't have said the manuals would be improved if any information already found in the areainfo page were purged from them and not everyone will read both pages.
