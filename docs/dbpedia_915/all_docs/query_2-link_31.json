In 1939, however, when war conditions supervened, and it became obvious that local supplies of lime or limestone for agricultural and other work would be invaluable, the investigation was pressed forward. The Macaulay Institute for Soil Research was at that time under the direction of Dr. W. G. Ogg, who agreed very willingly to co-operate with the Geological Survey by having all the necessary chemical work done in the laboratories of the Institute, by Dr. A. Muir and Mr. A. G. M. Hardie.\n\nAll the limestones of known importance and most others of potential value were examined or re-examined in the field;; and a series of pamphlets (Wartime Pamphlet No. 13, Parts I to VIII) was published giving a description of the character, occurrence, distribution and accessibility of every limestone which might conceivably be of economic value. These descriptions were accompanied by records of the analyses done at the Macaulay Institute.\n\nMost of the samples for analysis were selected by Survey Officers to represent the bulk composition of the limestone that would be obtained during commercial exploitation. In the case of working quarries and mines, sampling was at all times facilitated by the ready co-operation of the owners and lessees, and we record with pleasure our thanks for their assistance.\n\nAs this work progressed it became obvious that a more general geological discussion of its results would be advantageous; for the local and very detailed treatment adopted in the pamphlets was primarily designed to show where in any given district limestone was available, and to indicate which of the former sources of limestone had been worked out, were no longer accessible, or were not of sufficiently good quality to be worth working under modern conditions.\n\nThe preparation of this general account of Scottish limestone resources has been in charge of Dr. T. Robertson. The treatment is on a county basis, and the following authors are responsible for the most important county descriptions: Dr. Robertson for Fife (with Mr. D. Haldane), Inverness (Islands), Renfrew, Ross and Cromarty (with Mr. J. Knox), Shetland (with Mr. D. Haldane), Stirling, Sutherland (with Mr. J. Knox), West Lothian: Dr. Simpson for Ayr, Dumfries, East Lothian, Lanark, Midlothian, Peebles, Roxburgh; Dr. Anderson for Aberdeen, Argyll, Banff, Caithness, Inverness (Mainland). Perth.\n\nW. F. P. Mclintock.\n\nDirector, Geological Survey Office, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London, S.W.7 December, 1998\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nLimestone, as dealt with in the following pages, comprises all rocks containing calcium carbonate in sufficient quantity to make the presence of that constituent one of the most important characteristics of their composition. It thus includes such contrasting materials as lake marl on the one hand and marble on the other. The range in composition stretches from limestones with 95 per cent. and upwards of calcium carbonate, through argillaceous calcareous rocks suitable for cement making and containing 70 to 80 per cent. of calcium carbonate, to rocks from which rock wool may be manufactured and which may contain as little as 20 per cent. of calcium carbonate.\n\nBy increase in magnesium carbonate, limestone passes into dolomite. The mineral dolomite is a double carbonate of calcium and magnesium, the two substances being present in equivalent molecular proportions (54.35 per cent. CaCO3 and 45.65 per cent. MgCO3), and this is the form in which the magnesia is present in the rock called dolomite, any excess of lime appearing as calcite. Thus the rock called dolomite is a mixture of the minerals dolomite and calcite in varying proportions. Nearly all limestones contain a certain percentage of magnesia, but for some economic purposes it is necessary to have as little magnesia as possible, whilst for others the nearer the rock is to pure dolomite in composition the better. For agricultural purposes even a considerable percentage of magnesia is quite unobjectionable as it performs a function similar in some respects to that of lime, and with some very acid soils it is even preferable to have a certain amount of magnesia present in the lime dressing.\n\nA geological survey of limestones is an essential preliminary step to the appraisal of economic prospects; and it is necessary during such a survey to adopt the broad definition of limestone given above rather than a more limited conception bounded by what is thought to be of economic value in the light of evidence available at the time. Most limestones are sedimentary in origin, and each bed was laid down as a definite stratum over a large area of sea-floor under conditions which were favourable to the deposition of calcium carbonate. At one place, under optimum conditions, a thick deposit of nearly pure limestone was formed; at another only a thin bed accumulated; at a third the conditions on the sea-bed were so muddy that only a few shells could grow, and the resultant bed is a more or less calcareous shale; in still another place the limestone bed, after having been deposited, was eroded away again and there is nothing left to show for it. Because of this the stratigrapher lays much greater stress on a recognition of whether such and such a calcareous horizon is in the position of a known limestone rather than on the question of whether it is a good limestone. It is this \"limestone position\" which is traced from place to place and which is inserted on the geological map.\n\nIt may be noted in passing that a rock which appears to effervesce freely in acid is not necessarily a limestone. Some sandstones have a calcareous cement distributed evenly through their mass. Other rocks, such as some dense quartzites, are cracked and jointed, and the cracks are lined with calcite. Because of this they may show abundant effervescence on each face of every fragment broken off with a hammer. Basic igneous rocks, such as basalt, contain lime and on their decomposiÂ­tion calcite is formed which may be disseminated throughout the rock, may line joints, or may form amygdales by filling rounded gas-cavities. \"White trap\" is a particularly confusing variety of such rocks. Where basalt or similar rock containing a considerable percentage of lime in complex silicates has been injected as a thin sill into carbonaceous strata, the basalt is often bleached owing to absorption of carbon dioxide derived from the surrounding carbonaceous matter and its combination with the lime molecule to form calcium carbonate. Thus the igneous rock is not only impregnated with calcite which effervesces freely, but it also takes on the pale grey to buff colour that is so common in limestones, hence the name \"white trap\". Again, limestone passes in some places into ironstone by enrichment in ferrous carbonate and, indeed, the greater number of clayband ironstones are more or less calcareous.\n\nWhen a district has been fully mapped the data regarding each limeÂ­stone can be reviewed. In a given area a limestone may be shown to be of good quality and thickness; in one direction, however, it may show progressive thinning, or deterioration through admixture of argillaceous matter or of volcanic detritus; in another direction it may be found to have been cut out by erosion shortly after its deposition; whilst in a third direction a progressive sandy contamination and the appearance of oolitic grains may indicate the proximity of the shore-line of the sea in which the limestone was deposited. The characteristics just mentioned refer to the bed of limestone as originally deposited. Superimposed upon these are factors dependent upon the folding, fracturing and denudation that the whole series of rocks has undergone between their formation and the present day. From the completed map we deduce the areas in which the limestone stratum crops out, even when concealed under drift; the areas in which it is at a considerable depth; and the way in which it has been affected by folds and faults. From all the above data an estimate of reserves can be made, and , an opinion can be expressed regarding the chance of quality, thickness, etc., being maintained.\n\nThe above notes apply primarily to the comparatively thin beds of limestone found in the Carboniferous strata of the Midland Valley of Scotland. They also apply in essentials to such massive limestone formations as are to be found in the Cambrian strata of Sutherland and Skye and the Mountain Limestone Series in England. In these formations the individual beds are in many cases of great thickness and succeed one another in unbroken succession without the intervention of rocks of a different character. They are nevertheless ordinary, unaltered sediÂ­mentary strata; and deductions can be made regarding them of a character similar to those that are applicable to limestones which occur in a stratigraphical succession built up mainly of non-calcareous beds.\n\nAnother important type of limestone deposit in Scotland is represented by the metamorphic limestones of the Highlands. Originally these altered rocks were sedimentary strata similar in character to those described above and were situated in a sedimentary sequence consisting of a variety of different types of rock. During at least one period in their history, however, the whole region in which they lie was subjected to high temÂ­peratures and to very high pressures and strong differential stresses. Under such conditions calcite becomes to a very marked degree pseudo-plastic, and during the folding which took place in the whole series of rocks owing to the high stress imposed upon them the more calcareous beds behaved in some respects like a viscous fluid, being moulded, twisted and pulled out to a greater extent than the rather more rigid rocks with which they were interbedded. As a consequence of this the main limestone horizons, though maintaining with more or less definiteÂ­ness their general character and trend for a stretch of 50 miles or more, are lenticular in development or even discontinuous, whilst the intensity of the folding to which they have been subjected has resulted in much irregularity and patchiness of outcrop.\n\nUnder the conditions of temperature and pressure prevailing during this period of metamorphism the calcite composing the limestone was recrystallized, producing a completely crystalline marble instead of the aggregate of calcite grains cemented by secondary calcite which makes up the normal sedimentary limestone. At the same time the impurities, which in the original bed consisted of fine particles of sand, silt, mud, mica, etc., underwent a change. Their constituents combined with one another and with the lime in the calcite, producing new compounds which as a group are often referred to as calc-silicates. These calc-silicates crystallized out as definite minerals included in the limestone and in some cases they account for an appreciable amount of the lime which was present in carbonate form in the original rock.\n\nThus metamorphic action has altered the chemical, physical and structural characters of limestone to a marked degree, and so has affected either for better or for worse their suitability for different economic purposes and their amenability to exploitation by quarrying or mining.\n\nIn addition to the two main types of limestone discussed above there are several other varieties worthy of attention. They include the cornstones of the Old Red Sandstone and Trias, present-day shell beaches, freshwater lake marls, calcareous tufa, vein calcite, calcareous fault-breccia and brucite marble.\n\nCornstones are nodular or small-scale lenticular masses of fine-grained limestone. They are generally considered to be chemical precipitates laid down in seasonally or periodically flooded continental depositional areas, and in many cases the limestone thus formed is of high quality. It is fine-grained and dense in texture with a rather conchoidal fracture. Cornstone horizons extend over considerable areas in some instances. Unfortunately their nodular character, with the silty material between the nodules, and their general thinness and lack of continuity, usually rule them out for other than local use.\n\nShell beaches, where reasonably accessible, are a convenient and someÂ­times a valuable source of lime. In Scotland, unfortunately, such deposits are chiefly to be found on the western and northern islands; and, though valuable locally, they are not within easy reach of the main agricultural districts. They are also usually of small extent and thickness and are subject to disturbance, and even to complete removal, by storms. The shell sand at John o' Groat's in Caithness is exceptional, being not only of great extent but also very conveniently situated both for road and coastwise transport. Pure shell sand has a very high content of calcium carbonate, but beach deposits vary so rapidly from place to place and are so liable to admixture with other rocks that the average content of samples, taken from a large number of beaches in Scotland which could reasonably be described as composed of shell sand, worked out at only about 60 per cent. CaCO3 on the dried sample.\n\nLake marl is a calcareous mud deposited in freshwater lochs under favourable conditions. It may form a bed several feet thick. Conditions suitable for the formation of a sufficient quantity of marl to be of economic use are practically confined to the northern portion of Scotland. Even there the deposits are few in number, though some are of high quality, analyses of four different marls showing an average of 87 per cent. CaCO3. Locally it is a valuable commodity.\n\nBrucite-marble is a rock produced by the metamorphism of dolomitic limestone in contact with igneous rock. When a pure dolomite is marmorized under low pressure it is dedolomitized. The dolomite molecule is broken up, yielding calcite, periclase (magnesium oxide) and carbon dioxide. In the presence of water vapour the periclase is conÂ­verted into brucite (magnesium hydroxide). The total amount of magnesia is unchanged, and the final result is a rock consisting of calcite and either periclase or brucite. When impurities are present, however, the magnesia enters with their constituents into the formation of other minerals such as forsterite, diopside, etc.\n\nChapter 2 Stratigraphical distribution\n\nIn Scotland limestone occurs in many different geological formations. Questions of geological correlation, that is, whether a bed of limestone known in one area is the same as, or different from, a bed of limestone found elsewhere, are important for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that individual beds of limestone do not usually vary rapidly in lithology and chemical composition from place to place, and so the character of a limestone can often be inferred in the first instance from the fact that it is the same bed as a limestone which is well known elsewhere. Thus, the Burdiehouse Limestone, which is of high quality, occurs in a certain position in the Oil Shale sequence, is of freshwater origin, is of rather distinctive appearance in hand specimen, is largely composed—in some beds at least—of ostracods and is associated with very typical kinds of plant impressions. If, then, we deduce from such geological evidence that the limestone found in a given spot is the Burdiehouse we are justified in going to some trouble to investigate it. Again, Group II of the Durness Limestone is composed of dolomite at Durness, Eireboll, Assynt, Kishorn, and in Skye, indeed wherever it is found, whereas Group V is mainly limestone both at Durness and in Skye. On the other hand, differences are often found when the limestones of one group of strata are compared with those of another. For example, the cornstones of the Old Red Sandstone are usually non-argillaceous and low in magnesia. In contrast, the cementstones of the Calciferous Sandstone Series usually contain a considerable percentage of magnesia and sometimes also an appreciable amount of iron.\n\nThe second reason for correlating beds of limestone is that it enables the whereabouts of a given limestone to be deduced by applying knowÂ­ledge as to its position in the stratigraphical sequence. In Midlothian, for example, there is a series of limestones in the Lower Limestone Group of the Carboniferous, and the chief limestones from above downwards are the Bilston Burn, the North Greens and the Gilmerton. Hence if a limestone outcrop is known to be that of the North Greens, the Bilston Burn Limestone will be found above it and the Gilmerton Limestone below it. If, in another place, a coal seam is found which is known to be the North Greens Coal, our knowledge of the general stratigraphy will lead us to look for the North Greens Limestone a short distance higher in the sequence. By following this principle it is often possible to trace the position of a limestone with considerable confidence even where it does not appear at the surface for many miles.\n\nIt will be seen from the sections dealing with the chemical and petroÂ­graphical characters of the Scottish limestones that despite all their variability the stratigraphical factor cannot be ignored, and indeed that a stratigraphical grouping is essential to any profitable discussion of the subject. The limestone-bearing formations are given in (Table 1), pp. 6 and 7, together with the types of limestone occurring in them and some indication of the areas in which they are to be found.\n\nIn the case of formations other than the Carboniferous the individual limestones in any one group of strata are comparatively few in number and their distribution throughout the various counties is adequately indicated in the table. In the Carboniferous, however, there are so many separate limestones that a more detailed treatment is required. The limestones of Dumfriesshire (except Sanquhar) and Roxburghshire have not been fully surveyed in detail, and it is only possible to say that they belong to the lower part of the Carboniferous sequence, without specifying their exact positions. Throughout the Midland Valley, on the other hand, from north and central Ayrshire through Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire to Fife and the Lothians, it is possible to trace the greater number of individual beds with a high degree of confidence.\n\nIn the Carboniferous rocks of the Midland Valley, limestone is confined to the lower half of the Carboniferous, and for the most part to the Upper and Lower Limestone Groups. (Table 2), pp. 8 and 9, gives some idea of the distribution of limestone in these strata and an indication of the areas in which they are well developed. Only limestones which have had, or may have, some economic significance are included.\n\nThere are some calcareous rocks in nearly every part of Scotland, but limestone in sufficient quantity and of good enough quality to repay attention from the economic point of view is limited to definite belts of country. Three different provinces may be distinguished (see (Plate 2)), namely (1) Southern Scotland and the Midland Valley, or the province of the Carboniferous limestones, (2) The Grampian and. South-West Highlands, or the province of the Crystalline Metamorphic limestones, and (3) Northern and North-Western Scotland, or the province of the Cambrian and Jurassic limestones.\n\nSouthern Uplands\n\nThe Southern Uplands; including the counties of Wigtown, Ayr (southern portion), Kirkcudbright, Dumfries, Roxburgh, Selkirk, Peebles (except the extreme northern end) and Berwick, are very poor in limestone. The Stinchar Limestone of south Ayrshire is the only bed of outstanding importance, though several of the Carboniferous limestones of the borders, such as those in the Liddesdale and Carham areas of Roxburghshire are of potential value.\n\nMidland Valley\n\nThe Midland Valley contains many limestones in the Carboniferous belt stretching from Ayrshire through Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire to the Lothians and Fife. These have been so very freely used in the past that future exploitation must inevitably be chiefly by mining. The individual beds of limestone are mostly thin, however, and the quality, though excellent in one or two cases, is in general only moderate. There is a development of thick limestones in the Midlothian district, and these are worked by mining. The north-eastern part of the Midland Valley, from central Stirlingshire through south-east Perthshire to Angus and KinÂ­cardine, is almost devoid of limestones. Bute and Arran also have very little.\n\nIn the Highlands the distribution of limestone is irregular. The South-West Highlands and Islands, which lie almost entirely in Argyllshire (Figure 3), have a considerable development of metamorphic limeÂ­stone in the mainland area south-east of the Firth of Lorne. The Loch Tay Limestone runs almost the whole length of Kintyre, the Tayvallich Limestone shows extensive outcrops south of Loch Awe, and the Ballachulish and associated limestones are well developed on the east side of Loch Linnhe and on Lismore and Shuna. Islay has extensive limestone tracts, but there is none on Jura. The portion of Argyll west of the Firth of Lorne has less in the way of calcareous beds, and the same applies to Mull and the other islands off the north-west Argyllshire coast.\n\nCentral Highlands\n\nThe main deposits of limestone in the Central Highlands are the Loch Tay Limestone and the Blair Atholl Limestones. The Loch Tay LimeÂ­stone traverses central Perthshire in a north-easterly direction from Crianlarich to Pitlochry and Kirkmichael and continues into Angus in the vicinity of Glen Isla. It is generally of moderate quality and is accessible in the vicinity of all the main through roads. Farther northÂ­east the Deeside Limestone, well exposed in the neighbourhood of Aboyne and Banchory, is generally accepted as the stratigraphical equivalent of the Loch Tay Limestone, but is of much lower grade.\n\nThe Blair Atholl Limestones, which are often of excellent quality, crop out in central and north-eastern Perthshire. From Blair Atholl itself they continue up Glen Tilt, thence eastwards to the Perthshire-AberdeenÂ­shire march at the Devil's Elbow and then northwards to Braemar. Considerably farther north they are almost certainly represented by the limestones of the Sandeud Group in Banffshire (see below).\n\nNorth-East Highland and Moray Firth\n\nIn the North-East Highland and Moray Firth areas the limestones of the Sandend Group form a well-defined zone yielding high-quality stone along most of its long outcrop. The Group runs from Tomintoul right through Banffshire via Keith to the Portsoy neighbourhood, passing on its way through the part of Aberdeenshire north-west of Huntly. The rest of Aberdeenshire is notably poor in limestone. Moray, Nairn, and the greater part of Inverness contain nothing of value, but around Fort William and in the Loch Laggan area extensions of the Ballachulish limestone-zone of northern Argyllshire are present and are of great importance.\n\nNorthern and North-Western Scotland\n\nIn Northern and North-Western Scotland the principal stretch of the mainland from western Inverness through the eastern part of Ross, Cromarty and eastern Sutherland into Caithness is composed largely of Moine and associated rocks in which limestone is rare. West of this, however, from the south end of Skye through Kishorn in Wester Ross to Ullapool and thence by Assynt to Durness and Eireboll, there is a good development of calcareous beds. These mainly belong to the Cambrian (and Ordovician) strata which are composed of limestone and dolomite through the greater part of their thickness. Owing to the geological structure, however, the calcareous beds are not continuous throughout this belt of country but are chiefly developed in four areas, namely, in southern Skye (Broadford and Ord), in the south-west corner of Wester Ross (Kishorn), in the Assynt district (Elphin and Inchnadamph) and in north-west Sutherland (Durness and Eireboll). In each of these areas there are enormous amounts of dolomite. In addition there is abundance of non-dolomite limestone in Skye and at Durness.\n\nCrystalline metamorphic limestones are found in the Loch Maree district of Wester Ross. In Skye and the west coast of Ross there is limestone in the Jurassic rocks, but only in one or two areas (Broadford and Applecross) could it be considered of possible economic value, and even there only in a small way.\n\nWestern and Northern Isles\n\nIn the Western and Northern Isles there is in general little limestone apart from shell sand. As far as is known, there is not a single workable bed in the Outer Hebrides, and there is no limestone worthy of the name in Orkney. In Shetland, however, the mainland is traversed in a north and south direction by a series of thick limestone zones, each many miles in length. There is also limestone in several of the smaller Shetland isles. In character the Shetland limestones are metamorphic. They are only of moderate quality.\n\nShell Sand\n\nAlong the whole eastern coast of Scotland from Berwick to Wick there is hardly a single deposit of sand shelly enough to be of in the Firth of Clyde and Solway areas of the west coast. In contrast with this the Atlantic seaboard contains many bays in which larger or smaller deposits of varying, but locally useful, lime content are to be found. Such sources are used to some extent both in the Outer Hebrides and elsewhere. In addition to shell sand of the usual type there are in one or two places, and particularly round the Isle of Skye, coastal deposits of nullipore sand, of which that at Claigan near Dunvegan may be taken as an example. In Orkney shell sand is the only local calcareous material of any value. Deposits are rather numerous in the various islands of the group, but the quality is not usually high owing to admixture of ordinary sand. In Shetland shell sand is not in general of importance, though a fairly extensive stretch is to be found at the south end of the mainland near Sumburgh, and there is another at the north end of Yell.\n\nThe most important deposit of shell sand so far found in Scotland, however, is at John o' Groat's, in Caithness, where a very extensive accumulation is to be found with an average calcium carbonate content of over 90 percent.\n\nChapter 3 Industrial uses\n\nIn Scotland the principal industries in which limestone has up till now been utilized are agriculture, building, paper-making, stone-dusting in coal mines, and iron and steel manufacture. These, and some other potential uses of Scottish limestone, are reviewed below.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe addition of lime in some form or another to cultivated soils is essential to ensure the satisfactory growth of most crops. Its usefulness is due in part to the improving effect it has on soil tilth and in part to the fact that the calcium it contains is an essential plant nutrient. Where the soil is deficient in lime this is usually remedied by adding some form of calcium carbonate (marl, ground limestone) or burnt or slaked lime. Marl contains calcium carbonate in finely divided form which reacts readily with sour soils and soon becomes available to the plants, but even when pure it is bulky, especially if undried, and relatively large amounts must be used. It is therefore costly to transport it any distance. On the other hand, burnt- or quick-lime has twice the 'strength' of calcium carbonate (weight for weight) and on slaking breaks down into a fine state of subdivision, in which form it reacts readily with the soil.\n\nAs marl is not abundant in Scotland it was the common practice, until a little less than 100 years ago, to work and burn limestone locally. This meant that in districts which were poor in limestone attention was given to deposits of the most meagre description, and it is not uncommon in some areas to find lines of old excavations along the outcrops of beds of impure limestone only a foot or two in thickness. With the developÂ­ment of railway and road transport it became more convenient and cheaper to obtain supplies of lime from a distance, and local lime-burning was soon abandoned in most places. Now, the cessation of liming does not lead to an immediately obvious deterioration in the land, since there are usually accumulated reserves of lime in the soil. In consequence there was a general decline in the habit of liming the land, and large areas of ground were greatly impoverished in course of time. When this was realized strenuous endeavours to encourage the resumption of liming were made. In the meantime, refinements in roadstone work and the demand for limestone dust for use in coal mines had led to the installation of grinding plant at limestone quarries and mines. Now, finely ground limestone is in a state of subdivision in which it can readily react with the soil, and it has certain advantages over lime itself (Ogg, 1942).\n\nIt is not caustic; it needs the taking of no special precautions in transit or storage; it can be applied at any convenient time during the year; it can be produced locally and in places where lack of fuel makes the cost of lime-burning prohibitive; it does not require the employment of the specialized skilled labour of the lime-burner. Moreover, the grain of the ground limestone is not uniform, so that the fine dust is dissolved in the ground and used up quickly for immediate plant needs, whilst the coarser grains go into solution more slowly, thus extending the period over which the supply of lime added to the soil is made available and avoiding alternating periods of excess and deficiency such as may result from irregular application of lime itself. In favour of lime, it can be said that the amount of material to be transported and distributed is only about half that in the case of limestone. This consideration, however, is seldom powerful enough to outweigh the advantages to be obtained by the use of ground limestone.\n\nIn view of what has been said it will be noted that it is not necessary, or indeed advisable, to grind limestone very fine. Enough powdered limestone for immediate assimilation by the soil is provided by crushing the rock so that all of it passes an â  in. mesh and 40 to 50 per cent. is below 100 mesh size.\n\nBuilding industry\n\nLime for mortar and plaster was formerly produced locally for the most part, and a considerable amount is still produced in areas convenient to the districts where the demand exists.\n\nIn building, as in agriculture, however, transport facilities have led to the closing down of many small limeworks and to increased importation from outside sources.\n\nThe data published in Wartime Pamphlet No. 13 during this investigaÂ­tion were submitted to the Building Research Station (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) for such comments as might be useful in planning of post-war building schemes. The following observations bearing upon the geological aspect of the problem are made in the light of these comments.\n\nLimes which can be used in building may be classified as follows:\n\n1. High-calcium limes containing usually more than 80 per cent. of CaO and MgO on the ignited sample. Limes made from the Mountain Limestone development of the Carboniferous Limestone Series in England and Wales may often have 95 per cent. CaO or higher.\n\n2. Semi-hydraulic limes, containing 70 per cent. Or more of Cat.) and MgO, the remainder being mainly silica and alumina.\n\n3. Hydraulic limes, usually containing between 60 and 70 per cent. of CaO and MgO, and so having a composition similar to that of Portland cement.\n\n4. Magnesian limes, containing over 5 per cent. MgO.\n\n1. High-calcium limes\n\nSo far as is known at present there is no deposit so uniformly of the highest grade in Scotland as to be able to produce in any reasonable quantity a fat lime equal in quality to that of the best Mountain Limestone lime, of which the Buxton lime is usually taken as typical.\n\nOf less pure limestones, which would yield a lime with over 80 per cent. CaO, not more than 5 per cent. MgO, and not more than 5 per cent. insoluble residue in acid, there are numerous examples. They are of two kinds, the massive crystalline metamorphic limestones of the HighÂ­lands and the sedimentary, usually thinly bedded, limestones of the Midland Valley and the Borders. The best examples of the first class are those of the Fort William district in Inverness (Creag Aoil, Spean Bridge, Tom an Aoil), Blair Atholl in Perthshire (Creag Odhar) and Duff town in Banff (Parkmore). In each of these areas almost unlimited quantities of limestone capable of yielding a good high-calcium lime are available by quarrying, and access is good. The composition of these limestones is such as to yield a fat lime of good white colour. The grains of calcite in the rock, however, are large enough to show a definite crystalline structure in which the cleavage planes of the individual crystals are clearly developed. This tends to cause the crystals to break up during burning and produces in many cases very friable lumps of lime in contrast with the strong lumps yielded by fine-grained sedimentary limestone. In the second class, namely those of the Midland Valley and the Borders, there are two types of deposit. The first includes those of the Lothians and Fife where the high-grade limestones are practically all being mined, as the reserves available for quarrying were long ago exhausted. Examples are Newbigging, Cults, and Roscobie in Fife, Oxwell Mains in East Lothian. Middleton and Straiton in Midlothian.\n\nSome of these limestones are of sufficiently high quality to yield a lime that could be guaranteed to contain over 90 per cent. CaO. Except in one or two cases, however, the size of the reserves and the nature of their disposition make it difficult to see how an industry of more than limited or local importance could be established except by joint working of a number of mining or quarrying units.\n\nIn some cases one of the most important reasons why these limestones cannot be classed with the best English and Highland limestones is that they contain enough iron to give a grey colour to the lime instead of the pure white yielded by the latter types.\n\nIn addition to those limestones which are of such high intrinsic value that they yield in practice, and without any high degree of care in proÂ­duction, a lime containing well over 80 per cent. CaO, there are many more limestones which, on analysis, show a composition which suggests that they could easily, on theoretical considerations, yield a high-calcium lime. Under common methods of manufacture, however, the lime derived from them cannot be put on the market with a guarantee of 80 per cent. CaO, although according to the Building Research Station it is quite possible that an improvement could be effected by the adoption of some modifications in the manufacturing processes. The point could best be resolved by semi-scale plant trials. On the other hand, where the high-quality seam is thin or is overlain by, or interbedded with, limestone of a poorer character, the output required to make the enterprise profitable may be such as to necessitate the production of a lime of much poorer quality than could be obtained by working only the best limestone. In such a case, best-quality high-calcium lime may be only a minor by-Â­product in a business which could not possibly be run solely for such a commodity.\n\n2 Semi-hydraulic limes\n\nMost of the limestones worked in the past yield lime coming under this heading. They are usually low in magnesia. They contain, however, a rather high percentage of silica and alumina, whence they derive their semi-hydraulic properties. The Building Research Station points out that in the areas in which any given type of lime was produced in the past the builders were familiar with the best method for using it and so could make allowance for its particular characteristics.\n\nAt the present time, however, there is always the alternative of using mortars based on a mixture of high-calcium lime and cement with sand. As these constituents can be obtained as standard materials and moreÂ­over allow a greater flexibility in the type of mortar which can be produced by varying the relative proportions of lime and cement, there is an increasing tendency for local limes at least to have to share the market, unless they have some very outstanding quality. The lime from the Calmy Limestone of Darnley in Renfrewshire is an instance of a lime with high cementitious properties which has maintained its popularity over a long period.\n\n3. Hydraulic limes\n\nThe comments just made on semi-hydraulic limes apply equally to the hydraulic limes. A very large deposit of uniform composition would be required to establish a hydraulic lime or cement industry. Unfortunately rocks of the requisite composition occur only in relatively thin beds in Scotland, and as far as is known the quantity available in districts sufficiently near industrial areas is quite inadequate to provide a source of a commodity which needs, above everything, to be low in cost.\n\n4. Magnesian limes\n\nThe chemical analyses available show that for practical purposes limes produced from Scottish limestones would be either very low in magnesia, usually not as much as 5 per cent., or would be from dolomites and contain over 30 per cent. MgO. As far as is known, lime of the latter type has not been used for building in Scotland unless in a very few local instances. An exceptional type of lime is that which would be yielded by the cementstones of the Lower Carboniferous. These are dolomites in which a variable amount of the magnesia in the dolomite molecule has been replaced by iron.\n\nCement\n\nIn recent years much interest has been shown in the possiÂ­bility of establishing a cement industry in Scotland on a sufficiently large scale to meet general Scottish requirements. The occurrences of the raw materials for this industry are reviewed below. The economics of the various proposals that have been put forward are not dealt with here, however, and there is no intention of conveying any implication regarding economic possibilities.\n\nIn stratigraphical sequences of normal type it is very common for limestone to be closely associated with shale (or mudstone) of such a composition that a mixture of the calcareous and argillaceous materials can easily be adjusted to give the chemical composition of cement. It is therefore tempting to look upon an alternating sequence of calcareous and argillaceous beds as being ipso facto a basis for the establishment of a cement industry. Other factors, however, must be taken into conÂ­sideration, such as the quantity of raw material available, the physical and chemical condition in which it exists, its accessibility, the fuel necessary for the manufacture of cement clinker and the proximity of the market. Most of these considerations are of paramount importance where the material' to be manufactured is of low intrinsic value. Some of the raw materials that have been suggested during recent years are briefly noticed below.\n\nPortland cement was for some time manufactured at Cousland near Dalkeith, Midlothian, from the North Greens Limestone and the overlying shales. The available resources, however, are limited and are almost entirely in depth. This will entail mining. The shale also is not uniform in composition throughout its thickness.\n\nProposals were advanced some twenty years ago to use the limestones of the Skateraw area near Dunbar for cement along with the silty clays of the Forth carselands. The 100-Ft. Beach clay at Inverkeithing was one that was suggested as being suitable in composition. In this case large quantities of both raw materials are available but they are not in very close association.\n\nThe debris from slate quarries in Argyllshire, especially that at Ballachulish and in the islands of Seil and Luing, is such as to make it suitable in composition for use in cement manufacture. In the case of Ballachulish there is the Ballachulish Limestone close at hand, while Seil and Luing are respectively only a few miles north-east and east of the Garvellach Isles, which contain some thick beds of limestone. The island of Lismore in the Firth of Lorne, about half-way between Luing and Ballachulish, is composed mainly of limestone, much of it of high quality, low in magnesia, and proved suitable on test for use along with slate-quarry debris in the manufacture of cement. There are many places in the metamorphic limestone belt between Islay and Banff where a schist of suitable chemical composition for use in cement-making occurs adjacent to limestone, both materials being present in 'unlimited quantity. In all of these the costs involved in transport and in the supply of fuel will require to be overcome if cement is to be made at a competitive price. The manufacturing process would require pre-grinding of the raw materials; there does not exist in Scotland any natural juxtaposition of raw materials comparable with that of the Thames Estuary where the fine mud of the river lies within a very short distance of the chalk hills, and where the finished product is not only near its chief market, but can also be shipped direct from the point of manufacture to other maritime markets.\n\nAt intervals during the past 40 years it has been suggested that the deposits of shell marl in some of the Caithness lochs could be made the basis of a cement industry. Within the past year or two detailed investigation of a typical deposit near Thurso has shown that the marl and the argillaceous mud which accompanies it are suitable raw materials. Each of them occurs in finely divided form, thus requiring no preliminary grinding. The principal difficulty is that the particular deposit investiÂ­gated is not large enough to provide raw material to feed a kiln of economic size for more than a few years, and that other marl-bearing lochs are not likely to yield appreciably greater amounts. The marl would therefore have to be brought to a central plant from a number of different localities, many of them some miles distant. Fuel would also have to be brought from the south.\n\nThe cement clinker at present produced from Scottish raw materials is made from high-grade Carboniferous limestone and blast furnace slag, with the addition of sand to bring the silica up to the required proportion.\n\nChemical and allied industries\n\nLimestone is one of the most important raw materials in the calcium carbide and paper-making industries, and also in a number of other chemical processes with comÂ­mercial applications. Usually the demand is for quicklime of a definite quality and showing particular characteristics on slaking; though for many purposes a hydrated lime is equally serviceable.\n\nFor first-quality calcium carbide a limestone containing 97.5 per cent. CaCO3 (54.6 per cent. CaO) and less than 1.05 per cent. MgCO3 (0.5 percent. MgO) is required. It will be seen from the data given below that no deposit of such a quality large enough to provide a commercial source of limestone for this purpose has so far been found in Scotland in areas deemed sufficiently accessible for profitable exploitation.\n\nIn paper-making, and in other industries where lime is used in the production of caustic liquor, a lime of the very highest purity is not so essential. The need is for a lime which will slake uniformly and comÂ­pletely within a given time and which is of such a character that flocculaÂ­tion and settlement of the precipitated calcium carbonate are both rapid and uniform. With a limestone of sufficiently high calcium carbonate content to give a lime with 90 per cent. CaO, and low in insoluble residue and in iron, the question of producing a satisfactory product for paper-making and similar purposes is a matter which concerns the burning and processing rather than the original composition. There are many deposits of limestone in Scotland from which raw material of the necessary grade can be obtained.\n\nDolomite\n\nDolomite is of use as a refractory in steel manufacture, and as a source of magnesium. The most important occurrences in Scotland, from an economic point of view, are those in the Durness (Sutherlandshire), Skye (Inverness-shire), and Duror (Argyllshire) disÂ­tricts. Typical samples of the Durness dolomite have been examined by Mr. W. Barr, of Messrs. Colvilles, Ltd., as to their suitability for the hearths of basic open-hearth furnaces. The material is considered by him to compare very favourably with the Durham dolomite at present in use. The dolomite in Skye is of the same geological age as that at Durness, and will probably be found to be of similar quality.\n\nThe distribution and character of the Cambrian dolomite of Durness and Eireboll were investigated recently, and it was shown that large quantities of high-grade dolomite were easily procurable (Knox, 1941; see also Kennedy, 1940). The Duror (Appin Limestone) dolomite is also of high grade in some localities. At Ballachulish it is very friable and falls easily to a fine powder, in which condition it is an excellent abrasive and polishing medium. The chief occurrences of dolomite in the N.W. and W. Highlands are situated on the sea-board, an important point in connection with the use of dolomite and sea-water in one of the well-known processes of manufacture of magnesium.\n\nThe Carboniferous dolomites are on the whole not so pure as those mentioned above. The Carham dolomite, for example, showed about 6.5 per cent. of silica, making it unsuitable for use as a refractory in steel manufacture. Most other dolomites in the Carboniferous are only a few feet in thickness, and so do not occur in sufficient quantity to be of economic use.\n\nIron and steel manufacture\n\nThe amount of limestone used as a flux in iron-smelting is not a large part of the Scottish output, but the total quantity so used in the past has made large inroads into the reserves of workable stone in the Midland Valley, and at the present time much of the highest-grade limestone in Fife and the Lothians is used almost exclusively for this purpose, leaving stone of poorer quality on the average for other purposes. For steel manufacture and other metallurÂ­gical operations the highest grade of limestone is imported from England.\n\nMarble\n\nThe metamorphic limestones of the Scottish Highlands are marbles in that they are granular aggregates of crystalline calcite with mosaic texture. Most of them, however, are dull-grey in colour; and many are too irregular in texture or not sufficiently coherent to be used for building or ornamental work. Ornamental types of marble are only known in a few parts of Scotland, the chief occurrences being in the islands of Tiree, Iona and Skye, in Glen Tilt near Blair Atholl, and at Ledbeg and Loch Ailsh in the Assynt district of Sutherland.\n\nThe Tiree marble (1-in. Sheet 42) is partly of a dull-pink colour, fine in grain and containing abundant crystals of a green calcium-iron pyroxene (coccolite). There is also an outcrop of white, fine-grained, dolomitic marble. The principal occurrences are on the shore of Balephetrish Bay, on the north side of the island, but they are very limited in extent and, according to Mr. V. A. Eyles who surveyed this area, there are no reserves which could be worked on a commercial scale.\n\nThe Iona marble (1-in. Sheet 43) lies at the south-east corner of the island. It forms a nearly vertical band about 20 ft. to 30 ft. in thickness and about 100 yds. in length (Anderson, E. M., 1925, pp. 14, 99). Nearly all the valuable stone is now worked out. The marble consists of fine-grained, white, granular calcite, with greenish-yellow mottling and streaking due to the presence of serpentine.\n\nThe marble of Glen Tilt (1-in. Sheet 55) lies about 4 miles up the valley of the Tilt from Blair Atholl, near Marble Lodge. It is a banded rock of medium grain composed of granular calcite mottled with dull yellowish-green serpentine. It has been produced by contact metaÂ­morphic action of a granitic intrusion on a band of limestone belonging to the Blair Atholl ' Group.' The marble lies near a fault zone and is rather broken, so that the material, though perhaps sufficient in amount for economic exploitation, could only be obtained in the form of fragments suitable for use in terrazzo work.\n\nThe Skye and Sutherland marbles are products of contact metamorphic action by igneous intrusions on the dolomite and limestone of the Durness Limestone formation. In most places they are brucite-marbles formed by alteration of dolomite. In texture they vary from dense, compact types to medium-grained granular aggregates of calcite and brucite crystals. Usually they are white to light-grey in colour, but show slight mottling, chiefly in yellowish and greenish tints, due to serpentine. Rarely, a pale, bluish-coloured variety is found. In addition to the mottling, there is in most localities a good deal of serpentinous veining.\n\nIn Skye the marmorization is due to granitic and other intrusions of Tertiary age. The most important area lies on the north side of the Beinn an Dubhaich granite between Broadford and Torran (pp. 120–122). Owing to the narrowness of the metamorphic aureole the degree of marmorization is very variable, even between two adjacent exposures. The rock is for the most part light-grey in colour, and finely but distinctly granular in texture. It is so traversed by joints that it is not possible to obtain sound blocks of any size, and the main use of the rock is for terrazzo chips. It has been worked for this purpose, and there are abundant reserves. The Durness Limestone in this area is made up of alternating bands of dolomite and non-dolomitic limestone. On exposure to the atmosphere the brucite in those marbles which have been derived from dolomitic beds is gradually converted to hydro-magnesite, which forms a thin white chalky crust. This might limit the usefulness of the stone for exterior work.\n\nThe marble of Ledbeg (1-in. Sheet 101) and Loch Ailsh (1-in. Sheet 102) is within the metamorphic aureole of the Cnoc na Sroine syenite and is of much greater extent than the Skye occurrence. It is accessible near Ledbeg on the Lairg–Lochinver road, and also on the side road leading from this main road north to Loch Ailsh. In general character and appearance the material is similar to that in Skye, except that here all the original rock was dolomite. Types containing brucite, diopside, tremolite and forsterite are found, the minerals developed depending upon the original character of the limestone and upon the degree of metamorÂ­phism it has undergone. So far this marble has only been used on a small scale, for local road work.\n\nRoadstone\n\nIn some parts of Scotland limestones are used on a fairly large scale as roadstones. While limestones possess neither the high degree of hardness nor of toughness characteristic of many igneous rocks, they have certain compensating advantages. Thus, they bind very readily with tar, and on second-class water-bound roads their dust has considerable cementing value. Furthermore, as most limestones are greyish or whitish in colour, they make a light-coloured road surface of a type preferred by many drivers, especially at night.\n\nThe properties which render a limestone suitable for roadstone are mainly of a physical rather than of a chemical nature. Thus it is essential that the stone should possess at least a moderate degree of hardness and of toughness, that it should not be porous, and that it should not split into flaky fragments. Such properties may be expected in the more massive, fine to medium-grained types of limestone in which the bedding planes are fairly widely spaced and shaly partings infrequent. The presence of cracks and fissures, or of thin calcite veins, is undesirable as tending to weaken the stone.\n\nAs calcite is a rather soft mineral, impurities are often an advantage in a limestone used for roadstone. In this connection quartz is particularly valuable in adding to the hardness of the stone, and some of the calc-silicate minerals in lending toughness. On the other hand clay mineral impurity is definitely undesirable as it greatly weakens the stone in the presence of moisture (Knight, 1939, p. 55).\n\nOf the non-metamorphic limestones probably the most extensively used in Scotland are the tough, compact Ordovician limestones of South Ayrshire (Craighead and Tormitchell). Some of the Carboniferous limestones of the Midland Valley have also been used, but only on a small scale owing to the abundance of igneous rocks of good quality in the same region. In Caithness and Orkney impure limestones or limy sandÂ­stones belonging to the Middle Old Red Sandstone are the main local source of roadstone. In the North-West Highlands the limestones and dolomites of the Durness Limestone have also from time to time served to meet local requirements. The Jurassic and other post-Carboniferous limestones of Scotland are not generally suitable for roadstone.\n\nAs might be expected, metamorphism frequently has the effect of enhancing the qualities of limestone as roadstone by rendering it harder and more compact and by bringing about the combination of the calcite with impurities to form calc-silicate minerals. Where, however, a coarsely crystalline rock has been produced by metamorphism it is often found to be unsuitable for roadstone owing to the manner in which the large calcite crystals break along the cleavage-planes. Moreover, metamorphic rocks with a strongly marked schistose structure or with many partings of mica-schist do not make good roadstones.\n\nExtensive use of metamorphic limestones as roadstone is made in Banffshire, where a considerable proportion of the total requirements is met by this type of rock. It is interesting to note that the average insoluble residue (mainly quartz) of limestones belonging to the Sandend Group from five quarries worked for roadstone is 13.8 per cent., against 3.7 per cent. for limestones belonging to the same group from three quarries worked for agricultural purposes.\n\nIn the neighbouring county of Aberdeen the Deeside Limestone, an impure type rich in calc-silicate minerals, has proved suitable for roadstone. Metamorphic limestones have also been worked for roadstone on a considerable scale in both Perthshire and Argyllshire, and in fact in almost every Highland county in which they are present.\n\nRock wool\n\nRock wool is an insulating material consisting of a woolly aggregate of fine fibres of rock glass. It is analogous in character to slag and glass wools, and has in some countries, notably America and India, been used extensively for insulation purposes in buildings. A report on rock wool with special reference to 'supplies of suitable raw material in this country has been recently published (Guppy and Phemister, 1945), and to this the reader is referred for a general account of the nature of the raw material, the method of manufacture and the uses of the product. It is sufficient to say here that the rocks most suitable for use in rock wool manufacture are impure limestones in which the ratio of SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3 to CaO MgO lies within the limits 3 to 4 and 4 to 3. In practice such rocks as shaly limestone or dolomite and calcareous or dolomitic shale are those that usually show a suitable composition.\n\nIn Scotland, so far, the rock wool industry is in its infancy; and any growth that may take place will depend partly upon the suitability of such material for use in the types of building that are chosen for large-scale house-building projects, and partly upon whether a comparatively unknown substance such as rock wool takes the fancy of builders and architects.\n\nThe authors mentioned above have reviewed the analyses published in Wartime Pamphlet No. 13—The Limestones of Scotland. They are careful to point out that the analyses available are nearly all of material selected as being limestone, not as being rocks which would appear in the field to be of suitable composition for rock wool manufacture. Amongst rocks showing a bulk composition suitable for rock wool are the Appin Limestone (Argyllshire), the Deeside Limestone (Aberdeenshire), the dolomitic fault-rocks associated with the Highland Boundary Fault at Aberfoyle (Perthshire) and Balmaha (Stirlingshire), and the cementstones at Ballagan (Stirlingshire) and Murroch Glen (Dumbartonshire). The Carboniferous limestones of the Midland Valley and the Borders are in nearly every instance associated with thick beds of shale and sandy shale, and a mixture of suitable composition could easily be made. Indeed owing to the natural alternation of sedimentary strata of various types most limestones are closely associated with rock suitable for mixing with them to produce rock wool. The problem is in nearly all respects similar to that of the cement industry, except that much greater latitude in the proportion of the constituents is allowable and that magnesia is not deleterious. The remarks above on the raw materials for cement manufacture should be read in this connection.\n\nFurther investigation is desirable, and until this is carried out it is not possible to make any definite statement regarding the relative suitability of the calcareous beds in different areas, either used alone or in combination with such local shales, sandstones, etc., as would be needed to give a wool within the required range of composition.\n\nRock wool is a very bulky and fragile product, and this makes the transport of the manufactured article a more serious problem than that of cement. For this reason rock wool manufacture stands a better chance of success as a local rather than as a centralized industry; and it has been suggested that the application of hydro-electric power to its production in Scotland might be worth investigation (Robiette, 1945, p.36).\n\nStone-dusting in coal mines\n\nIn Scotland considerable amounts of ground limestone are used in coal mines for diluting or covering up fine coal-dust which might otherwise be dangerous as a potential source of coal-dust explosions. For the purposes of the Regulations under the Coal Mines Act (1945 edition) it is necessary to grind the limestone so that all of it passes through a 60-mesh sieve and not less than 50 per cent. nor more than 75 per cent. by weight passes through a 240-mesh sieve.\n\nAnnual production\n\nThe annual outputs of limestone from mines and quarries in Scotland as a whole, and in the four most important limestone-producing counties individually, during the period from 1921 to 1946 are shown in the accompanying table. For the data from 1939 to 1946 inclusive we are indebted to the Statistics Directorate of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.\n\nLimestone output in tons Year Scotland Total Midlothian Fife Ayr Banff 1921 193,096 72,766 36,426 10,901 14,026 1922 272,929 122,195 50,972 14,981 17,670 1923 329,185 128,185 59,222 19,424 16,567 1924 319,819 127,392 70,103 24,794 19,076 1925 241,477 54,314 68,695 30,567 18,716 1926 222,213 84,108 46,661 28,220 20,999 1927 267,659 98,264 68,580 31,294 25,339 1928 226,486 69,954 68,067 28,284 28,026 1929 283,342 80,698 82,011 38,778 34,950 1930 312,382 111,535 88,719 36,564 23,251 1931 291,569 83,576 66,938 40,720 40,894 1932 324,296 88,634 48,835 43,849 72,665 1933 311,864 98,886 55,590 43,640 54,854 1934 321,578 95,167 68,873 41,822 53,782 1935 333,556 118,482 70,757 45,669 45,549 1936 370,113 127,301 67,399 54,407 52,350 1937 432,212 153,492 91,289 63,981 58,243 1938 480,614 158,768 98,281 68,468 59,134 1939 459,402 142,836 90,057 76,538 59,814 1940 425,562 138,133 99,374 70,289 45,862 1941 360,299 129,992 79,496 83,034 22,330 1942 373,519 123,328 68,836 78,544 17,199 1943 326,453 123,845 71,984 66,812 19,524 1944 379,523 118,389 63,995 90,447 23,153 1945 335,516 107,178 58;902 80,758 32,891 1946 435,108 113,658 54,870 102,404 85,667\n\nChapter 4 Lithological characteristics\n\nOne of the most important geological features of a limestone is the information it usually gives regarding the life of the period during which it was formed; for most limestones are composed, in the first instance, of organic remains. Changes take place, however, during the processes of deposition, consolidation, and any subsequent metamorphism that the rock may undergo. These changes involve partial, or even complete, comminution, recrystallization and replacement of the original mineral constituents; so that much of the evidence left behind by the shell, coral and other life of the period is often obliterated. The final form in which the mass of limestone appears, and in which it becomes available for economic purposes, thus depends partly upon the original character of its constituents and partly upon the changes they have subsequently undergone.\n\na. Sedimentary limestone\n\nAs calcite is of all the more common rock-forming minerals that which most readily undergoes solution and recrystallization, limestones are usually well cemented; and if the body of the limestone is itself made up of only finely divided calcite mud a compact homogeneous rock is produced which rings under the hammer and breaks with a finely porcellanous to almost glassy fracture. The Burdiehouse Limestone in the Carboniferous and some of the calcite-mudstone beds in the Durness Limestone are examples of this type amongst those of organic origin. The cornstones of the Old Red Sandstone, the cementstones of the Lower Carboniferous, and the Spirorbis limestones of the Upper Carboniferous illustrate the same character amongst calcareous beds produced mainly by chemical precipitation.\n\nWhere the calcareous material consists mainly of finely comminuted shell-fragments and similar material, the general appearance of the limestone is rougher, and the fracture is more like that of earthenware than of porcelain. If well cemented however, the rock is little inferior in strength to a calcite-mudstone, and it is distinctly less brittle. Where the shell-fragments, or remains of other lime-secreting organisms such as bryozoa, algae, corals and crinoids are rather coarser, the rock is often very rough both on weathered and freshly broken surfaces, but the calcareous cement between the grains may give the rock a considerable degree of toughness.\n\nLarge crystals of calcite, such as those forming the stems and ossicles of crinoids, the infillings of cavities in the original deposit, and recrystalÂ­lized shells, show a tendency to split along the crystallographic cleavage planes. They are thus often a source of weakness in the stone; although a rock composed entirely of crinoid ossicles or stems, with irregular orientation of the calcite grains, is sometimes quite tough in character. It breaks with an angular, sometimes almost hackly, fracture. This is the type commonly referred to as 'petit granit.'\n\nFlaggy, sandy, argillaceous, tufaceous and other types of limestone are found in great variety, and the same bed may pass laterally through every stage in the transition from a pure calcite-mudstone or shell-aggregate to a sandy or argillaceous limestone, and thence to a sandstone or shale with only sufficient calcium carbonate in its composition to give incomplete cementation of the sandy or muddy aggregate. Such lateral changes usually take place very gradually.\n\nb. Sedimentary dolomite\n\nMost limestones contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) intimately intermixed with the calcium carbonate as an original constituent. This may or may not be indicated under the microscope by the presence of crystals of the mineral dolomite. Quantities of less than 5 per cent. MgCO3 do not interfere with the common uses of the limestone except for chemical purposes, nor do they usually have any effect upon the lithological character of the rock.\n\nIn the vicinity of faults a certain amount of irregular replacement of limestone by dolomite is frequently found to have taken place, and this is usually attributed to the work of underground water circulation through the broken strata. This type of dolomitization is usually very irregular and patchy in character and is often vein-like in development. It is well shown in the Charlestown Main Limestone at the Charlestown quarries. Good examples of dolomite veins can be seen in the Burdiehouse Limestone at Newbigging mine, Burntisland.\n\nThe normal development of dolomite in the Carboniferous rocks of Scotland, however, is of quite a different character. In organically deposited calcareous sequences it occurs as definite beds, usually quite sharply distinct from any limestones with which it may be in contact by interbedding. Thus, the top post of the Bilston Burn Limestone in Midlothian is a dolomite. On the other hand, it is the bottom post of the Charlestown Main Limestone which is dolomite at Seafield and Cults in Fife. At Auchenheath the whole of the Calmy Limestone is dolomite.\n\nOn the freshly broken surface these dolomites are usually leaden grey to buff in colour, sometimes with the pearly lustre of the mineral dolomite clearly visible. The texture varies from smooth in the finer-grained varieties to distinctly crystalline in the coarser types. On the weathered surface they are usually distinctly (buff in colour in comparison with the grey tone of most limestones, and an ochreous appearance is not unÂ­common. The ochre-bed forming the highest post of the Bilston Burn Limestone in the Bilston Burn, Midlothian, was found on examination to be a partially decalcified ferro-dolomite. The majority of the cement-stones in the Calciferous Sandstone Series prove on analysis to be ferro-dolomite, showing calculated percentages of ferrous carbonate ranging up to over 17. It is noteworthy that in every case this ferrous iron appears to replace a portion of the magnesia in the dolomite molecule (CaCO3, MgCO3). These rocks are probably chemical precipitates and their grain is seldom coarse enough to show a crystalline appearance on the fractured surface.\n\nThe dolomites of the Durness Limestone occur as distinct beds, and in some parts of the sequence they alternate with beds of limestone, as is the case in the Carboniferous. In development, however, they are in some respects different from those of the Carboniferous. They range from fine-grained, compact, porcellanous types through finely crystalline varieties to rocks in which the texture is coarsely granular. Some of these types are almost characteristic of the groups of strata in which they occur. Thus the lowest beds, Group I, show dark-grey, fine-grained, but distinctly granular dolomites. In Group II the dominant type is a light-grey, finely crystalline dolomite, alternating with compact porcellanous varieties which were probably laid down originally as calcite-mudstones. In Group HI fine-grained, light-grey dolomites alternate with types fairly coarse to coarse in grain and showing small-scale patchiness in light and dark grey colours (leopard stone). Group IV shows grey, medium-grained dolomites, alternating with white and light-grey limestone in the upper half of the group. In Group V a fine-grained dolomitic mudstone type occurs with very fine bedding lines showing up clearly on the weathered surface like a fine ruling with some 20 to 30 lines to the inch. A rather similar type was found in Group II. Dark, medium to coarse-grained, leaden-grey dolomites are the most characteristic types in Group VI, though other varieties also occur.\n\nc. Metamorphic limestone\n\nLimestones amongst the less highly altered metamorphic rocks are often very little different in hand-specimen from those of the unaltered sedimentary type. The fine-grained varieties of the Loch Tay and other limestones in Argyll, for example, show a certain amount of recrystallization of the calcite; but in many places they do not appear to be any coarser in texture than the medium-grained limestones of the unaltered Carboniferous. The Lismore Limestone still retains much of its carbonaceous content, and the Islay Limestone still shows the original oolitic structure of some of its beds.\n\nThe more highly altered limestones of Perthshire, Inverness-shire, Aberdeenshire and Banffshire, on the other hand, are usually sufficiently coarsely crystalline to show the individual grains clearly in hand-specimen. The impurities, also, are often recrystallized into crystals of macroscopic dimensions, as in the tremolite, diopside, and other calc-silicate limestones in Aberdeenshire. The colour is seldom other than a medium to light shade of grey, though white and cream varieties also occur. A greenish tinge is in some places typical of those limestones with an appreciable amount of calc-silicate impurity.\n\nIn the, still more highly altered crystalline limestones of the Lewisian the texture ranges from fine-grained in some of the Loch Maree examples to coarsely saccharoidal in the case of the blue limestone of Glen Dessarry, Inverness-shire.\n\nd. Metamorphic dolomite\n\nUnder the ordinary conditions of regional metamorphism a pure dolomite does not appear to undergo alteration, apart from a coarsening of the grain due to recrystallization. Dolomite has a much lower dissociation temperature and pressure than calcite, and where there are impurities present, siliceous, aluminous or ferruginous, the magnesia of the dolomite readily combines with them, forming tremolite, actinolite or hornblende according to the nature of the impurity. The composition of these minerals in most cases demands a greater proportionate amount of magnesia than of lime. Hence some of the lime in the dolomite molecule recrystallizes as calcite, so that metaÂ­morphism usually involves a certain amount of dedolomitization.\n\nIn higher grades of metamorphism, as in the impure magnesian limeÂ­stones of the Lewisian, there is a further rearrangement of the constituents, giving diopside, forsterite and spinel. Examples are provided by the coarse-grained diopside-forsterite marble of Rodil in South Harris (Davidson, 1943) and the forsterite-spinel marble of Glenelg (Clough, 1910, p. 22).\n\ne. Contact-altered limestone and dolomite\n\nThe effect of rise in temperature due to the proximity of intrusive magma, without the abnormal pressure and stress conditions of regional metamorphic action, has already been referred to (p. 19). In most Scottish occurrences there is not enough recrystalli7ation to cause much growth in the general grain-size, and the contact-altered limestones in consequence are usually finely granular in texture. Where impure but non-magnesian, as in the case of the Great Estuarine Series limestone at Strollamus in Skye, the result is a mosaic of granular calcite with wollastonite (calcium meta-silicate) and grossularite (lime garnet) produced by interaction of silica and alumina with the lime. The rock so formed is in this case white in hand-specimen and very tough. Where magnesia is present, as in the Cambrian dolomites, the result of heating is to break up the dolomite molecule. The magnesia thus set free crystallizes as periclase which, in the Scottish instances, is converted to brucite by hydration. The small amount of silica present combines with the requisite amount of magnesia to form forsterite and this is partly or wholly altered to serpenÂ­tine by hydration. Thus are produced the brucite marbles of Skye and Sutherland. In many cases, however, there has been decomposition of only a portion of the dolomite, so that every stage in the transition from dolomite to non-dolomitic brucite-marble can be traced, depending upon the local incidence of temperature and pressure. The brucite-marbles are usually fine to medium in grain. They are white to grey in colour, with mottling in green, blue, and other tints when serpentine is present. They are usually little different from the unaltered granular dolomites in texture, but sometimes show distinct aggregates of brucite crystals in hand-specimen. On weathering they usually develop a white chalky skin owing to the conversion of the brucite into hydro-magnesite and the relative insolubility of this mineral in comparison with calcite.\n\nf Calcite and dolomite veins\n\nCalcite is a very common mineral in veins, fault-fissures and joints. As might be expected, calcite veins are particularly common in limestones, but they are also found in almost all types of rock. Owing to their light colour, calcite veins are generally conspicuous in a quarry face or natural outcrop. They are nearly always coarsely crystalline. In many instances the crystals have not developed faces, but only show the rhombohedral cleavage characteristic of calcite. Where there are free surfaces within the vein, however, well-formed crystals are frequently present including the sharp-pointed types spoken of as ' dog-tooth spar ' and the blunter types known as nail-head spar.'\n\nSome calcite veins are exceedingly pure, or at most contain a small percentage of carbonate of iron. In many cases, however, other minerals are present, for example when the calcite is a gangue mineral in ore veins. The commonest non-metallic mineral associated with calcite in veins is quartz. As this mineral in some ways resembles calcite in crystalloÂ­graphic development it is sometimes mistaken for the latter, but can readily be distinguished by its much greater hardness and the absence of a good cleavage. Barytes is another mineral commonly found in calcite veins-; it can be distinguished from calcite by its platy crystals and by its much higher specific gravity. Although calcite veins are exceedingly common they seldom attain a sufficient thickness or a high enough degree of purity to be worth working separately from the main body of rock they cut.\n\nAn unusual type of impure dolomite crops out at intervals along the Highland Boundary Fault. It occurs in comparatively narrow bands between individual faults making up the fracture-zone, and has been formed through the alteration of serpentine and other ultra-basic and basic rocks rich in magnesia. The dolomite is massive in some localities, and brecciated in others. Although cream, grey or pink on the freshly broken surface it weathers with a characteristic bright orange-coloured crust. It is too impure to be used for most purposes for which dolomite is required but is of suitable composition to serve as a raw material for the manufacture of rock wool.\n\nSpecific Gravity of limestones and dolomites\n\nThe specific gravity of calcite is 2.71, and it is therefore to be expected that the specific gravity of limestones of a moderate or high degree of purity will approximate to this figure. A reduction, due to porosity, should perhaps be taken into account, but as most Scottish limestones are highly compact rocks, this effect is very slight. The great majority of Scottish limestones analysed (excluding dolomites) have specific gravities falling between 2.65 (165.6 lbs. per cubic ft.) and 2.75 (171.9 lbs. per cubic ft.) with an average of 2.70 (168.8 lbs. per cubic ft.). Consideration of the figures shows that it is not possible to draw any distinction, on grounds of specific gravity alone, between metamorphic and non-metamorphic limestone (apart from a special case noted below), or between limestones belonging to different formations.\n\nVariations above or below the average are, of course, mainly due to the presence of constituents other than calcite. One of the commonest is quartz which, with a specific gravity of 2.65, tends to bring the specific gravity of the limestone somewhat below 2.70. A constituent that has a much more marked effect in this direction is carbon. The latter is plentiful in the Burdiehouse Limestone of the Lothians, most of the analysed samples of which have a specific gravity of under 2.67 or, in a few cases, even under 2.60.\n\nOther constituents, of which the most important are compounds of magnesium and iron, tend to bring the specific gravity above the average. As these are often present along with quartz, there is frequently a counterÂ­balancing effect; consequently highly impure limestones may have a specific gravity approximating to that of calcite. An interesting difference emerges at this point between sedimentary and some metamorphic limestones. While the specific gravity of the former, as just explained, is often unaffected by an increase in impurities, the density of the latter tends to rise due to the formation of calc-silicate minerals which have a comparatively high specific gravity.\n\nApart from calc-silicate-bearing limestones, almost the only calcareous rocks with specific gravities of over 2.75 are the dolomites and ferro-dolomites. Corresponding to the rare occurrence of limestone types with percentages of magnesium carbonate between 16 and 41 (see p. 31) there is a scarcity of limestones with specific gravities between 2.75 and 2.82. Of the comparatively few limestones which do have specific gravities falling within these limits, practically all are impure ferro-dolomites, the density of which has been reduced by the presence of abundant alumina and silica.\n\nThe specific gravity of pure dolomite (CaCO3 54.35 per cent., MgCO3 45.65 per cent.) is 2.87 (179.4 lbs. per cubic ft.). Nearly all iron-free dolomites have a specific gravity slightly lower than this figure owing to the presence of a small amount of calcite, and, in most cases, also of quartz. An average figure for Scottish dolomites is 2.85 (178.1 lbs. per cubic ft.).\n\nAlmost the only calcareous rocks with a specific gravity of over 2.87 are the Carboniferous ferro-dolomites which have specific gravities ranging up to 2.90 (181.2 lbs. per cubic ft.) or even more.\n\nIn the Durness Limestone of the North-West Highlands, where dolomites and limestones are found in close association, the specific gravity can be used as a quick method of indicating, within limits, the character of the calcareous rocks. This is referred to in greater detail in the description of the Sutherland limestones (p. 184).\n\nWhere dolomite has been altered by thermal-metamorphic action the specific gravity is lowered owing to the conversion of the magnesian portion of the dolomite molecule into brucite, which has a specific gravity of between 2.3 and 2.4. A rock composed wholly of calcite and brucite in equimolecular proportions has a specific gravity of approximately 2.57 (Kennedy, 1941, p. 2), and thus contact-altered dolomite may have a range of specific gravity from 2.85 to 2.57, depending on the degree of dedolomitization. Hence a partially altered dolomite may have the same specific gravity as a pure limestone. Further complications appear if impurities are present; and so, as pointed out by Kennedy, identiÂ­fications based on specific gravity in such cases must be confirmed by other means, as by Lemberg's test for brucite. The Skye occurrences are an instance in point.\n\nChapter 5 Chemical characteristics\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor most economic purposes the value of a limestone depends largely upon the total quantity of calcium carbonate contained in it. The amounts of magnesium carbonate, alumina, silica, iron, phosphorus, sulphur, etc., are also important because of their effect, either in giving the stone some particularly desired quality or in affecting it adversely for the special purpose to which it is put. Chemical analysis is therefore necessary, and nearly all the chief limestones in Scotland have been analysed in connection with this investigation. In the preÂ­liminary stages use had sometimes to be made of analytical data based on old work and on samples of limestone selected for particular purposes and thus not truly representative of the bulk of the stone available. The figures used in this memoir, however, are from material selected as typical of the bulk of the limestone to which they apply, and in many cases refer to samples taken across the whole thickness of the bed and so representing the average character of the limestone composing it.\n\nComplete analyses were made of the chief limestones in each district' but, in addition, many partial analyses were carried out with a view to ascertaining the value for agricultural use of limestone in particular outcrops. These partial analyses were confined in most cases to estimates of lime, magnesia, carbon dioxide and residue insoluble in acid.\n\nFor general purposes the composition of the limestones is best expressed in percentages of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate rather than in percentages of the oxides. The carbonate percentages have thereÂ­fore been calculated from the analytical figures and are used in all cases except where the percentages of carbon dioxide, iron oxide and other constituents make it clear that some appreciable proportion of the lime and magnesia is present in other than carbonate form. The conversion factors used were as follows: CaCO3 = CaO × 1.784 and MgCO3 = MgO × 2.091. In no case have the results been recalculated to bring the total to 100 per cent.\n\nWhere any appreciable proportion of the lime or magnesia (or both) is not present as carbonate but is contained in calc-silicate minerals, the percentages of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate cannot be calculated from the ultimate analysis, but require special estimation. This is done on that portion of the rock which is soluble in acetic acid and which normally contains only the lime and magnesia which were present in the rock in carbonate form. For economic purposes such special estimatiops are seldom necessary, but for this investigation they were made where calc-silicate minerals were known to be present in amounts exceeding one or two units per cent. In some cases, however, the calculated figures for calcium and magnesium carbonates given below may exceed slightly the figure that would have been obtained by the use of acetic acid as a solvent.\n\nIn a large number of instances estimates were made of the amounts of elements other than those normally included in a standard complete analysis, and information was thus obtained regarding the distribution of such trace elements. Full discussion of chemical and petrographical questions would, however, require a separate volume.\n\nDolomitization\n\nThe analyses have an important bearing on the question of dolomitization. The problem of dolomitization in sedimenÂ­tary limestones is fully discussed by F. M. Van Tuyl (Van Tuyl, 1916, pp. 251–422) and by F. W. Clarke (Clarke, 1924, pp. 565–580). From their critical reviews, it is clear that dolomite has been produced in a number of different ways, but that the only important method from the normal stratigraphical point of view is that of marine alteration of deposits of calcium carbonate. The accounts of the process of dolomitization by marine alteration vary somewhat in detail as expressed by different authors (Cullis, 1904; Skeats, 1905; Dixon, 1907; Daly, 1909; Blackwelder, 1913), but in general they amount to the same thing. According to this view the calcareous material, whether chemically or organically deposited, was originally composed of calcium carbonate containing a percentage of magnesium carbonate not greater than that found in the skeletons and shells of living organisms. The original magnesiuth carbonate is probably not in the form of dolomite but is contained in solid solution or otherwise in the calcium carbonate. It seldom exceeds 16 per cent. except in certain algae, and is usually less than 10 per cent. If, after its original formation, the deposit of calcium carbonate remains in contact with sea water, then under favourable conÂ­ditions, interaction between the calcium carbonate and the magnesium salts in the water may cause progressive replacement of calcite by dolomite. The favourable conditions include a somewhat warm temÂ­perature, a pressure not in excess of that due to comparatively shallow water, and a period of time long enough to allow the action to take place before the calcareous material either sinks to deeper and colder levels or is covered up by succeeding deposits of calcareous or non-calcareous materials and so insulated from the sea water. Another factor in dolomitization of this type, and perhaps the most important one, is the degree of carbonation of the water; for the solution of calcium and magnesium carbonates in natural waters depends upon the presence of carbon dioxide in the water, and when this gas is driven off the carbonates are precipitated. Thus the presence or absence of organic matter in the water associated with the originally deposited calcium carbonate is likely to influence its sensitiveness to the action of magnesia in the sea water with which it is in contact (Peach and Horne, 1907, pp. 370–371).\n\nIf the calcareous deposit is in the form of an ooze or mud, then complete dolomitization may take place comparatively quickly under favourable conditions of temperature and pressure; it might even take place during the settlement of the ooze on the sea foor. If burial and consolidation take place quickly thereafter the result will be a fine-grained compact dolomite such as those in Group IT of the Durness Limestone (pp. 38 and 182) and some of the dolomites in the Lower Limestone Group of the Carboniferous (p. 42). Should consolidation take longer, there would be the opportunity for coarser crystallization of the mineral, and the result — might be a more granular dolomite, like some of those in Groups III and VI of the Durness Limestone (p. 181).\n\nWhere the calcareous deposit consists of solid calcareous grains or masses, such as shells, corals, crinoids, ooliths, or the like, embedded in calcareous mud, the dolomitization may take place selectively, the solid grains and the matrix being dolomitized at different rates or the one before the other. Thus if the process of dolomitization is stopped before it is completed, the result may be a mottled rock consisting partly of dolomite and partly of limestone as is the case in some beds in Group VI of the Durness Limestone (p. 181). If such a process of dolomitization is completed, however, a mottled dolomite may be produced, such as the leopard stone in Group III of the Durness Limestone (p. 181).\n\nIn the above cases it is assumed that the reduction in volume of 12.1 per cent. due to conversion of the calcite molecule to the dolomite molecule is not evident in the final product because the deposit as a whole was not consolidated until after conversion.\n\nA further possible case is that in which a partly or completely conÂ­solidated but porous limestone, such as a coral-reef deposit, remains in contact with sea water under conditions conducive to dolomitization. Under such circumstances the final result may be a porous dolomite. The Funafuti results seem to show that there may, however, be secondary deposition of dolomite in addition to the replacement of calcite (Cullis, 1904, pp. 404–415). There was an unfortunate gap in the evidence, however, in that it was not possible to ascertain the character of the water in the porous portions of the reef at depth (Judd, 1904, pp. 366–367); nor is there any way of judging whether the porous portions of the rock were still undergoing secondary changes of any sort.\n\nApart from the normal sedimentary, usually marine, dolomite the only other type commonly occurring in Scottish limestones is that found in the vicinity of faults, broken ground and planes of jointing. Such dolomite has obviously been formed after final consolidation, when water containing magnesia has regained access to the limestone. In cases where the dolomitization is associated with fractures known to have occurred long after deposition of the limestone, it is clear that groundÂ­water has been the medium through which the change has been effected. In other cases, however, the dolomite veins in the limestone do not appear to be in direct communication with veins or fissures extending for any great distance into the surrounding strata; and it seems probable in some instances that the limestone, after having solidified on the sea floor, was broken or developed jointing whilst still uncovered by other sediment or so lightly covered that it was still within reach of sea water, and so under the influence of dolomitizing agencies.\n\nWhen the Macaulay Institute analyses were scrutinized with a view to ascertaining the incidence of dolomitization upon Scottish limestones it was immediately obvious that certain samples were prima facie open to suspicion in this connection. These included mixed samples taken over a thickness of limestone known to contain definite separate beds of limeÂ­stone and dolomite, grab samples from broken rock, samples from the vicinity of faults, samples not taken under the supervision of a fully qualified geologist, samples found on analysis to contain 25 per cent. or more of insoluble residue, samples in which an appreciable proportion of the lime or magnesia, or both, were not present as carbonate, and samples in which iron replaces part of the magnesia in the dolomite molecule. Leaving aside all samples known to be of such a character, but no others, this gives a total of 175 analyses. In addition there are seven Geological Survey analyses of the Durness dolomites which can be taken as of equivalent authenticity to those of the Macaulay Institute, and 27 analyses by the British Oxygen Co., Ltd., of limestones selected and sampled by the Geological Survey during an investigation of some of the purer Scottish limestones. In the latter case particular attention was given to the magnesia content. Altogether, therefore, there is a total of 209 analyses available on which to base conclusions.\n\nThe percentages of MgCO3 on a pure CaCO3+MgCO3 basis show the following distribution (Figure 1):\n\nPercentage Range of MgCO3 No. of Analyses Percentage of Total Analyses 0 to 5 137 65.6 0 to 10 161 77.0 0 to 16 169 80.9 16 to 41 10 4.8 41 to 46 30 14.3\n\nThe figure of 16 per cent. is taken as being about the maximum of MgCO3 found in living organisms apart from some highly magnesian alga (Clarke, 1924, pp. 571–574). The 41 to 46 per cent. range includes all the sedimentary dolomites.\n\nThe. analyses in the 0 to 16 per cent. MgCO3 group consist of limeÂ­stones from the Lower Limestone Group of the Carboniferous, from the Dalradian, Moine and Shetland Metamorphic series, and from Groups V and VI of the Durness Limestone; together with a few from the Upper Old Red Sandstone. The relative proportions in the metamorphic and non-metamorphic limestones are shown in the upper histograms in (Figure 1). In each of these two subdivisions the distribution of figures is similar, nearly all lying between 0 and 10 per cent. and the great majority between 0 and 5 per cent. Taking all the analyses within the group, 65.7 per cent. show between 0 and 3 per cent. MgCO3.\n\nThe analyses in the 16 to 41 per cent. MgCO3 group include the following:\n\nLewisian 4 all the available analyses, except one which is a high-grade dolomite. Middle Old Red Sandstone 2 {probably chemical precipitates or evaporation deposits. Cementstone Group 2 Lower Limestone Group 2 both of them from limestones affected by intrusive sills of quartz-dolerite.\n\nThe analyses in the 41 to 46 per cent. MgCO3 group include as follows: Lewisian, 1; Dalradian, 1; Durness, 17; Cementstones from the Cement-stone Group and the highest portion of the Upper Old Red Sandstone, 8; Lower Limestone Group, 3.\n\nThere are very marked concentrations both at the calcite and the dolomite ends of the scale in the series of analyses as a whole; and, if only normal sedimentary beds of organic or almost certainly organic origin are considered, this concentration is so decided that there are no analyses of limestone unaffected by subsequent metamorphic action within the range of 16 to 41 per cent. MgCO3. In the Dalradian, Moine and Shetland Metamorphic limestones a similar concentration at the calcite end of the scale is found; there is nothing between 16 and 41 per cent. MgCO3; and the rarity of magnesia in these rocks as a whole is indicated by the fact that only one dolomite, the Appin one, appears amongst the analysed samples.\n\nIn the case of the Durness Limestone we have no analyses of the limestone beds as distinct from the dolomites, either in the Macaulay Institute or Geological Survey data; but a reliable series of analytical figures for samples collected from the limestone as distinct from the dolomite beds and examined by the British Oxygen Co., Ltd., with special attention to their magnesia content, is available. This shows a range of from 0.08 to 11.9 per cent. MgCO3, a result consistent with that indicated above for the sedimentary limestones as a whole. A similar tendency to concentration at each end of the calcite-dolomite range is one of the chief features of the analytical results of the, Funafuti coral-reef boring investigations (Judd, 1904, pp. 363–366).\n\nUnder the depositional conditions of Scottish limestones of post-Lewisian metamorphic, Cambro-Ordovician and Carboniferous Limestone age, therefore, it seems that there was a very definite tendency either towards preservation of the original calcareous composition of the deposited material of any given bed, or towards the complete conversion of the whole bed into dolomite. The influence upon dolomitization exercised by the depth of the water, the temperature of the water, the original character and degree of porosity of the deposited material, the presence or absence of decaying organic matter and the consequent amount of carbon dioxide present, or any combination of or variation in these, may be conjectured in some cases, but not in all. Any suggestion regarding the cause of the dolomitization, however, must take into account this further factor of the great scarcity of intermediate stages in the process. It seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that the rate of dolomitization was so rapid in comparison with other processes connected with the formation of the limestones that there was little chance of its being interrupted in the middle of the transformation once this had commenced.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that there are some examples of bedded limestones which, on analysis of a bulk sample of any one bed, may be judged to be partly dolomitized. The mottled beds in Groups VI and VII of the Durness Limestone (Peach and Horne, 1907, pp. 379–380) and the irregularly dolomitized beds in the Lower Limestone Group at St. Monans. are instances in point. They were not selected for analysis because they are not macroscopically homogeneous and so could not give a CaCO3–MgCO3 ratio from which any reasonable deduction could be made. Beds of these types, however, are extremely rare in Scotland, and it is safe to say that the analyses on which this discussion is based represent the facts fairly.\n\nIn most cases in which percentages of MgCO3 between 16 and 41 occur later dolomitization of the vein type is concerned. For example, a bulk sample of the Burdiehouse Limestone from one bed in the Newbigging Mine, Burntisland, 'would in some areas include dolomite from definite veins or veinlets traversing the limestone. Precautions have been taken to avoid this in the samples selected for analysis as representative of the various limestones.\n\nThe magnesian content of sedimentary limestones of the non-dolomitic type is not usually contained in crystalline dolomite observable under the microscope. The magnesia may be mainly within the calcite or may be disseminated through the matrix in a very fine state of subdivision. Crystals of dolomite, nevertheless, are found in some instances in the sections of such rocks. In default of further evidence it is best to assume that such crystalline dolomite may have been derived from the original magnesia in the limestone, since it does not exceed the amount that could easily have been present in the original shells, corals, etc.\n\nIn the Dalradian and other post-Lewisian metamorphic limestones, apart from those few which are high-grade dolomites, the occurrence of dolomite crystals is very rare.\n\nTurning now to the other limestones represented, by the analyses, we find that the Lewisian and Cementstone types both contain a considerable percentage of magnesia. In the Lewisian of the Loch Maree district the range is from 21 to 44 per cent. MgCO3, and in every case dolomite crystals are seen under the microscope. The Lewisian rocks of this area were originally a sedimentary series containing much basic igneous material, probably chiefly intrusive; and they have been subjected to intense metamorphic action, probably more than once. A discussion of the problem of their magnesian content would be purely speculative in the present state of our knowledge.\n\nWith the cementstones we are on firmer ground, for they show definite evidence of having been deposited from mineralized water in confined basins, possibly through evaporation. The similarly produced cornstones of the Old Red Sandstone were derived from water containing only calcium carbonate in solution and the result was a limestone low in magnesia. The water from which the cementstones were derived conÂ­tained a large proportion of magnesia, and sometimes some iron also; and the resulting rock is therefore dolomitic with, in addition, a conÂ­siderable amount of ferrous carbonate in some cases.\n\nCharacteristics of stratigraphical formations\n\nAs a result of the chemical work some interesting general statements can be made regarding the character of the limestones in the various stratigraphical groups.\n\nLewisian\n\nIn bulk sample nearly all the Lewisian limestones are of poor quality, with a calcium carbonate percentage round about 60; and in at least one case (Glen Urquhart, SL 106) some of the lime is contained in calc-silicate minerals. The percentage of magnesia is usually high, some of it being present in dolomite and some in magnesian silicates. The Lewisian limestone from the North-West Highlands which on analysis proved highest in calcium carbonate was obtained from Letterewe (SL 258): CaCO3 91.52; MgCO3 3.03; Insol. Res. 3.65. The range in other samples from Wester Ross (SL 259, SL 260, SL 261, SL 262, SL 263) was CaCO3 51.33 to 62.27; MgCO3 17.44 to 39.97; Insol. Res. 3.59 to 19.41.\n\nIn contrast with the above, the Glen Dessafry limestone of western Inverness-shire, which is believed to be Lewisian, is very low in magnesia. An analysis (Geol. Surv Lab. No. 1401) showed as follows: CaCO3 92.62; MgCO3 4.60; SiO2 2.0; Al2O3 1.0.\n\nMoine Series\n\nThe Moine limestones, of which those at Shiness (SL 169) Â­and Rebeg (SL 107) are the only noteworthy examples, are low in magnesia according to the analyses available, except for one band at Shiness which gave MgO 7.45 per cent. in an old determination (Anderson 1853, pp. 275–276). The grade of the Shiness limestone as a whole, however, is not high over any great width of face owing to a considerable development of calc-silicate minerals. Three representative samples across the beds exposed in the old quarry showed as follows:\n\nTop 8½. ft. about 42 per cent. CaCO3 Middle 3 ft. about 50 per cent. CaCO3 Bottom 7½ ft. about 81 per cent. CaCO3\n\nOld analyses of the Rebeg Limestone when it was being worked (Johnston, 1845, p. 487) gave as follows: CaCO3 93.82 and 94.10; MgCO3 1.64 "
