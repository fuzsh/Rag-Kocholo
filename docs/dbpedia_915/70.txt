Engineers were called out to Whitecraigs Station, which sits between Giffnock and Newton Mearns, in the early hours of this morning (January 22) after discovering the track was blocked.

Overhead wires on the line which runs to Glasgow Central were also severely crushed by the tree.

Pictures which were shared on social media show the extent of the damage caused by Storm Isha and the work that was cut out for the workers.

However, Network Rail Scotland who are responsible for railways in Scotland shared pictures of the line now being clear.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter they said: "Good news, the huge tree that fell onto the overhead wires at Whitecraigs station has been removed, and weâ€™ve repaired the damage as well. Well done team! @transcotland #StormIsha"
