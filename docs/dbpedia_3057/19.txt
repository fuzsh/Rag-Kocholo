Trivia[]

This would be the first and only time that Mickey Mouse would be voiced by Clarence Nash, as Walt was in Europe and was unable to record as a result. Nash also voiced Mickey in various American Motors commercials.

This is one of six cartoons that plays at the Main Street Cinema at Disneyland, albeit without sound (like a silent movie), and is shown in a restoration version.
