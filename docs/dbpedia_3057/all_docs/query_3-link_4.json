        "text": "Seymour Schachter’s parents were from the old country. They told him he’d never make a living doing art.\n\nSeymour loved to draw and paint. At 8 he won a national art contest — for adults. Yet when it was time for college, in 1978, and his parents said he could go to art school only if he paid for it himself, he ended up at Boston University’s school of business.\n\nBut he showed his artwork to the dean, who made a deal with his art school counterpart. They waived all business electives, so Seymour could take art courses.\n\nAfter graduation he landed a high-paying job selling eyeglass frames around the world. It was a dream job — “for anyone else,” he says. Driving to an important meeting in France, all he wanted to do was paint the countryside.\n\nHe quit cold turkey — and got a job in a Hackensack mall art supply store. But he was so successful — doubling sales in 1 month — that he caught the eye of the chain store’s president.\n\nThrough a series of similarly fortuitous meetings, legendary creative director Hazel Spector asked him for a storyboard. He had no idea what a storyboard was — but he stayed up all night, and created a great one.\n\nThat led to more offers. One company requested 25 panels; they’d pay $40. Hey, it’s money, Seymour figured. He tried not to act surprised when he received $1,000 — $40 for each panel.\n\nContinuity hired him as head artist. His 11 years there “were better than any art school,” he says. His work was critiqued by the best in the business.\n\nSeymour’s ability to switch styles — from cartoons to superheroes to photo realism — proved invaluable. In 1995 he formed his own company, and never looked back. He crafted a career as an illustrator for Fortune 500 companies. He’s drawn national ads, and designed some of the most popular product labels in the world.\n\nSubway, Pepsi, Fruity Pebbles, Tropicana, Arm & Hammer, Sierra Mist, Ragu, Skippy, Newman’s Own, Goldfish — all are Seymour Schachter clients, and Seymour’s artistic creations.\n\nSo was Joe Camel.\n\nIn 1984 — just 24 years old — his team drew the already-infamous cartoon character on cigarette tins and matchbox covers.\n\nBut Seymour felt conflicted. He called the American Cancer Society, and offering his services at a lower-than-usual rate. They asked him to draw posters.\n\n“It was my way of balancing my conscience,” he says.\n\nWhen his father died of a brain tumor, Seymour gave up doing cigarette ads altogether.\n\nEighteen years ago, Seymour and his wife Jamie began house-hunting. She worked in Milford, so they searched for someplace between there and New York City. Several friends suggested the “beautiful little artists’ community” of Westport.\n\nThey knew nothing about it. But they fell in love with the “nice beach, nice people and nice houses,” and bought a place off Cross Highway.\n\nTo his surprise, Seymour learned that the area teemed with promotional advertising companies like MCA, Ryan Partnership and Catapult — huge firms with national accounts.\n\n“We stumbled into an artists’ colony,” he says. He’s been busy ever since.\n\nSeymour Schachter is a successor to earlier generations of Westport illustrators — men like Harold von Schmidt, Steven Dohanos, Hardie Gramatky, Bernie Fuchs and Howard Munce. For a century — starting in 1902 — they drew ads, book and magazine covers, product cans and boxes, putting this town on the international art map.\n\nThey even spawned a noted correspondence course, Famous Artists School, located where Save the Children is now.\n\nIn the last 20 years, computers and the internet have taken work away from illustrators. The world is changing in many ways, and commercial art has not been spared.\n\nBut, Seymour says, “for the few of us who can draw Flintstone characters standing around a Christmas tree, there’s still a lot of work. And this part of Connecticut is still the place to get work.\n\n“I hope to remain an illustrator as long as I live.”\n\nGiants of the Blues — Westport artist Eric von Schmidt’s sprawling, 7-canvas work chronicling the roots of American music — should hang in the Smithsonian.\n\nInstead, it graces the Staples auditorium foyer.\n\nAnd that powerful piece is just 1 of over 1,000 paintings, sketches, cartoons, busts, murals and photos that fill the classrooms, hallways, offices and conference rooms of every Westport school and public building. For 4 1/2 decades the Westport Schools Permanent Art Collection has brought art into children’s lives, while paying homage to our town’s rich art history.\n\nNow, the Westport Historical Society returns the favor. Starting this weekend, and running through the end of the year, the WHS will showcase the collection, with a pair of shows. Special treasures will be shown in the Betty & Ralph Sheffer Main Gallery, while cartoons and comic strips grace the Little Gallery.\n\nAn opening reception is set for this afternoon, from 3-5 p.m.\n\nThe Westport Schools Permanent Art Collection began modestly. In 1964 Green’s Farms Elementary School art teacher Burt Chernow asked a few local artists to donate works. Ben Shahn gave a pencil sketch — and the rest is history.\n\nToday’s 1,000-plus artworks include paintings by Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Robert Motherwell and Christo. There are cartoons by Charles Schulz, Al Capp, Whitney Darrow, Dik Browne, Mel Casson and Mort Walker, and photos by George Silk, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Philippe Halsman and Victor Keppler.\n\nOver 150 local artists, past and present, are well represented.\n\nThe collection is curated by a committee of dedicated volunteers — including the indefatigable Mollie Donovan, who signed on 45 years ago expecting to work for a month or two, plus an an energetic group of young mothers. The group collects, studies, catalogs and displays the work — and keeps all artwork up to date on a computer database.\n\nThe Westport Schools Permanent Arts Collection is such an ingrained part of our town, we don’t even think about it. But we should.\n\nThe next time you’re in a school — or the library, Town Hall, or even Red Cross headquarters — look at the art that surrounds you. Admire it; think about it — and understand how it got there.\n\nThen, sometime between today and the end of the year, wander over to the Historical Society and check out the exhibits. Forty-five years ago, Burt Chernow’s wanted to expose children to art. Today, every Westporter is enriched by his vision."
