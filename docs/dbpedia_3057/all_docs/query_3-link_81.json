        "text": "Another week, another anthology. I’m really running out of things to say about these things. And this one’s not really any more interesting than the last bunch. I mean, seriously, this is the same movie as Make Mine Music but with more folklore. And I am crying on the inside. Strap in, kids, because I’m about to tear this movie apart. Sorry in advance to any Melody Time fans.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nY’all, I’m tired of package films. I’m really tired of package films. The history of the last like… four movies has been exactly the same. Melody Time is no exception. Disney’s trying to raise money to get back into features, but to do so they’re throwing together random unused ideas and it’s the exact same paragraph we’ve seen time and time again. Okay, that’s being a little dramatic. But Melody Time is, for all intents and purposes, the same movie as Make Mine Music. It’s the same history, and the same set up: animation set to contemporary and folk music. It’s not the most interesting thing to research, that’s all I’m saying.\n\nMelody Time was a box office success, but a critical failure. Just like I am, reviewers and audiences alike were sick and tired of these anthologies. They wanted a feature, one whole story that they could sink their teeth into. The package format was growing stale and tired, and audiences were chomping at the bit for another Snow White. Walt had become famous for innovation and masterful storytelling, but the public hadn’t seen that stroke of genius in a very long time. And we’re still a little ways off from seeing it again.\n\nBut not to worry! They’d finally scraped together enough money to get started on a feature. They were just still working on it. Cinderella was in production, just three years away. The last few package features were just a way to keep the lights on while they finished up. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel!\n\nMelody Time is broken up into seven shorts. The quality here is wildly inconsistent, with some decent shorts and some absolutely abysmal ones. But spoiler alert: “decent” is about the highest point Melody Time ever reaches. Seriously, I’ve been dreading this one. You know the drill by now. We’ll be looking at each piece individually.\n\nINTRO\n\nWe open as always with our title song, Melody Time. And it’s actually kind of fun! The generic Disney chorus takes a back seat to emcee Buddy Clark, personified first by the grandfather of the Rocky Horror lips, then by a creepy mask. The song is light and cheery and almost makes it sound like the movie is actually coherent. Thanks for lulling me into a false sense of security, movie. Thanks a lot.\n\nAnyway, backing up a little bit, the credits are meant to look like pieces of sheet music with the name of each song on top and the singer’s name splashed across. Then a magic paintbrush paints in a stage and the aforementioned creepy mask that tells us we’re in for a fun romp through the world of song. Are we really though?\n\nClark goes on to introduce our first segment. And to his great credit, he sets up the characters and the setting and shuts up. He doesn’t give away the whole plot, he just gives a little background and lets the short speak for itself. That alone makes Clark a lot better than some other narrators I could mention. Looking at you, Deems Taylor.\n\nONCE UPON A WINTERTIME\n\nOur first short is sung by Frances Langford and tells the story of two young lovers who are apparently named Joe and Jenny. They sleigh through a magnificent winter landscape, past couples skating on a frozen lake. Two rabbits hitch a ride on the runners, mimicking the action of the date. The two couples find a secluded spot to ice skate and the whole thing swerves dangerously close to that Valentines’ Day aesthetic that I hate so much.\n\nThankfully though, it doesn’t quite get there. Joe accidentally sprays Jenny with snow and the male bunny loses control and knocks over the female bunny. Both ladies are understandably upset by their boyfriends’ incompetence and storm off. There’s a really nice effect where the girls’ anger turns the entire picture red, before the boys’ sadness turns the entire picture blue. It’s a great use of color.\n\nAnd then we force some drama. The girls stomp right past a sign warning of thin ice without noticing it. The male bunny tries to point it out to them, but they ignore him. In his frustration, he slams the sign into the ice, cracking it in perfect time with the music which is actually a nice touch. Suddenly, they’re on a rushing river even though the music just specified that they were on a frozen pond. Jenny is carried down the current on an ice floe and faints because of course she does. Suddenly there’s a massive waterfall because of course there is. Joe tries to save her but only manages to unravel her glove because of course he does. And then he faints too.\n\nFed up with the humans’ uselessness, the animals take charge. The birds and squirrels take the loose yarn from Jenny’s glove and make a line that stops the ice floe from going over the random massive waterfall. The horses take hold of one end and barely stops Jenny and the girl bunny from going over, then they pull her back to solid ground. The ladies wake up in the arms of their gentlemen, who also wake around the same time, and are suddenly smitten with their “rescuers” all over again. Even though they did nothing. The short ends with them piling back onto the sleigh and waving goodbye to their animal friends.\n\nI absolutely loathe when a piece tries to be two stories at once. Are you a sweet piece with two lovers having fun on the ice? Are you a dramatic rescue scene? Pick one! As it is, it just feels confused. Even more annoying, the music sticks to the love story theme and the animation doesn’t follow, so the whole thing just feels really disjointed. Once Upon a Wintertime is not a bad song, even if it is kind of dated. I included it on my personal playlist of Christmas songs because I do enjoy it out of context. It just does not fit with the story.\n\nOne positive thing I have to say about this piece is the art style. This is 100% pure Mary Blair, and it is delightful to look at. The characters are cute and the backgrounds are simple, yet stunning. It really succeeds at looking like a Christmas card come to life. In fact, it often shows up in the parks around Christmas, in Hollywood Studio’s Jingle Bell Jingle Bam and California Adventure’s World of Color Winter Dreams. But no one really knows who these ice skaters are, and I can’t really blame them.\n\nBUMBLE BOOGIE\n\nNext up is the first of two Fantasia rejects. The animation here is set to a jazzy remix of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov’s Flight of the Bumblebee played by Freddy Martin and his Orchestra, and I’m actually pretty into it. People give Fantasia flack for being dry but I think a piece like this would have been great for livening it up. Here… eh. We follow a little bee trying to escape from a musical dystopia where literally everything is trying to kill him. It’s very stressful, yet I don’t totally hate it.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the only two pieces in Melody Time that I can really say I enjoy. I’m a fan of the neon-on-black color scheme that permeates the piece, and the surrealism here is fun without making me feel like I’m on all the drugs. I can’t say what makes it feel more coherent than, say, Donald’s Surreal Reverie. Maybe it’s the fact that there’s kind of a story, if a vague one.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF JOHNNY APPLESEED\n\nThe Legend of Johnny Appleseed is objectively the best short. Storywise, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: an adaptation of the life of pioneer John Chapman and his quest to spread apple trees, love, and kindness across the Western United States. You can read the real legend here. The short is beautifully animated, with more of that exquisite Mary Blair flare clearly visible in the backgrounds. Only three pieces in this dreck even try to tell a definite story, and this one’s by far the strongest narrative.\n\nHowever, even the strongest narrative here is pretty bland and uninspired. It’s also heavy on the religious themes in a way that feels incredibly preachy. I mean, I’ve mentioned before that I’m a raging Hunchback fangirl so religious themes don’t exactly bother me, but this feels like sitting through a Sunday School sermon. And if that’s your thing, awesome! It’s just really not mine. I prefer my Christian iconography with a heaping helping of criticism and hypocrisy, thanks.\n\nThe whole short is narrated by Dennis Day, doing multiple voices much like Nelson Eddy in Make Mine Music. And that’s another problem with this short. Everything it does has been done before by previous package films, and done better. There’s nothing new or exciting about it. It’s all very derivative, run-of-the-mill fare, and it’s really embarrassing that this is the strongest thing Melody Time has to offer. Even Walt hated the music Day wrote for the short, saying it sounded like “New Deal music”. This angered Day greatly, and shockingly, he wasn’t at the studio much longer.\n\nAnyway, we return to the storybook opening for our intro to the real John Chapman. There’s a phenomenal shot of apple blossoms climbing towards the sky, which segues into the man himself. He’s cheerfully singing The Lord is Good To Me as he harvests his crop of apple trees. It’s cheery and catchy I guess but it’s too simplistic to be interesting. It’s also really bizarre hearing a hymn in my Disney movie that isn’t Kyrie Elieson. And I swear I’ll stop comparing this to Hunchback because it isn’t doing poor Johnny any favors.\n\nJohnny pauses his work to watch pioneer wagons rattle on their way west. The Pioneer Song is a rousing call to action, rife with the promise of adventure and a warning not to be left behind. It does its job, but it’s not particularly memorable. And that’s kind of a theme here. Johnny is temporarily swept up in the frontier spirit but the daydream is shattered when he realizes he’s too small and scrawny to make it as a pioneer.\n\nDejected, Johnny turns back to tending his apple trees and finds his guardian angel! But this is no ordinary guardian angel. This is a rough-and-tumble frontiersman guardian angel with a coonskin cap and a truly epic mustache. He scolds Johnny for his pessimistic attitude and says that faith and courage are all he needs to make it as a pioneer. And then The Apple Song starts.\n\nI. Hate. The. Apple. Song. List songs are always annoying, and Dennis Day’s angel voice has the weirdest vibrato and accent I’ve ever heard. It’s strange, because the voices he does for the narrator and Johnny sound just fine, but I cannot stand the angel. It’s also the longest song in the short which doesn’t really do it any favors. And then he threatens to “carry on like this all day” which… No. Please. No. Do not. While I’m crying and trying to staunch my bleeding eardrums, the angel sets Johnny up for his journey. He doesn’t need muscle or weapons. He just needs a cooking pot, a bag of apple seeds, and a Bible. I’m sorry, a holy book. With a cross on it. Totally not a Bible. Can’t have that here.\n\nJohnny sets up into the dark and scary Mary Blair forest totally unarmed. The forest critters from Snow White warily watch this human and decide amongst themselves who’s going to take him out. In a nice little metaphor for Johnny himself, it’s not the bear or the mountain lion who approaches first. It’s a little skunk (or “a black and white cat” as the narration strangely puts it), ready to use his own secret weapon instead of brute strength. To everyone’s surprise, Johnny reacts by giving the little skunk pets and scritches. It’s a mark of Johnny’s uncommon kindness that he can befriend all the creatures of the forest. Either that or he’s a Disney princess. One of the two.\n\nYears pass and Johnny’s kind heart and helpful nature inspire people to build settlements all over the West. Johnny looks in on the settlers as they celebrate his orchards with a feast of all kinds of apple-related goodies. And dancing. And here’s where I get to cringe a little bit. Like Song of the South, this segment glosses over the atrocities the white people committed against the people of color and shows them all living in perfect harmony. So that’s questionable. However, on the other hand, it depicts the two as equals instead of the usual terrible savage stereotypes that appear later in this same movie. So I guess it’s fair for its day.\n\nFor forty years Johnny continues his trek through lush, bright Mary Blair backgrounds. There’s a nice visual pun here when the narrator uses the phrase, “Johnny threw his shadow across the land” to describe Johnny’s influence over the people, and his literal shadow spreads across the land. I’m not wording this well but it looked cool. It’s another very lovely visual in a short chock-full of them.\n\nNow old and gray, Johnny lays down to sleep under a tree. The angel returns and beckons him away. Johnny’s spirit steps out of his body to follow, before noticing the old man asleep under the tree. He asks who it is and the angel explains that it’s his “mortal husk” which… wow. Dark, Disney. At first Johnny understandably freaks out because he has work to do! He’s only made it to like… Indiana, and that’s not even really the West! But then the angel nudges him along by telling him heaven needs some apple trees.\n\nAnd that final shot…. WOW. Easily the most beautiful shot in the film. Just look at it! Honestly, I think this would have been a much better finale than the actual finale. Maybe if it ended with something so striking, this movie wouldn’t be lost to the annals of time. It’s really the only moment in all of Melody Time that made me feel like I was watching a Disney movie. So, so pretty.\n\nBut, as I said, I didn’t really love this one. One good shot does not a good short make. Maybe if the original plan for a Johnny Appleseed feature had come to fruition and the characters and story had been more developed, it would have worked. But as it stands it just feels… fine. And Disney is better than fine. Plus there’s that stupid apple song so that knocks it down a few pegs.\n\nLITTLE TOOT\n\nSpeaking of things that are fine, next up is the story of a little tugboat. It’s based on a children’s book by Hardie Gramatky that was released only nine years before the movie. Once again, I can’t link it because it’s not public domain. Little Toot is sung once again by the Andrews Sisters, which should be a major plus because they were so much fun in Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet. But nothing will ever be as great as Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet. The song is, however, featured in the background music loop at Magic Kingdom’s Storybook Circus, so that’s cool.\n\nLittle Toot is the youngest and smallest tugboat on the Hudson River. His father is well respected, tugging big ocean liners back into the ocean. And do not ask me how tug boat reproduction works because I do not know and I do not want to know. Anyway, Little Toot is constantly trolling people and getting in the way. At first, it’s just childish mischief, annoying but nothing more than that. And then he knocks his dad off course while he’s carrying a ship. They spin around and around and lose control completely. The resulting whirlpool causes the ocean liner to crash into the city. Buildings collapse. Roads are destroyed. Death toll in the thousands. City wide disaster. Oh the humanity!\n\nPolice boats escort a sobbing Little Toot out to exile way out to see. Clearly we’re supposed to feel bad for him but… no. You killed like a bajillion people. Big Toot doesn’t deserve to be forced to be a garbage boat, though. It’s not his fault his son is the boat version of the Boston Marathon guy. The imagery during this sequence is great, though, I must say. Buoys with demonic faces snarl “baaaaad boy…. shaaaaame” while slashing at him with claws made of waves. It’s legitimately creepy.\n\nSuddenly, a huge storm kicks up. A ship’s distress flare bursts to life in the sky, and Little Toot sees a boat trapped on rocks that are totally not traced over Aconcagua. Because this short can only borrow so much from Pedro, dangit! Little Toot sends out an SOS but the other bigger boats can’t overcome the massive waves. The liner throws a line down to Little Toot. The Andrews Sisters frantically chant “do or die, do or die!” as the little tug boat frantically pulls a ship like a hundred times bigger than him. And wouldn’t you know it? He manages it! Somehow. Little Toot is hailed as a hero. His dad is finally proud of him. All the reindeer love him. All is rainbows and butterflies. And no one bothers to remember that Little Toot has a massive body count. Except me. I’m watching you, Little Toot.\n\nThe main problem with Little Toot is that we’ve seen this story three or four times within the Disney Canon alone. Notably, it’s the exact same story as Pedro the Plane from Saludos Amigos. Once again, there’s nothing fresh or exciting on offer here and it’s frustrating. Everyone loves a good underdog story, but you’ve got to add some kind of unique elements to it. I mean, come on.\n\nThe other issue I have is that it feels aimed at a much younger audience than the rest of the film. Anyone reading this blog knows that Walt didn’t make childrens’ movies, he made family movies, but this one definitely feels like it’s for a child. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but Melody Time also features a few artsy pieces on par with Fantasia. This one and the next piece don’t gel together at all.\n\nSpeaking of…\n\nTREES\n\nThis is the other Fantasia reject. Or, at least, that’s what it feels like. Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians sing a song based on the poem Trees by Joyce Kilmer. And my god. My notes on this segment are “I’m going to die watching this short”. It’s that dull. It’s so heavily orchestral I couldn’t even understand the words.\n\nThis piece gets praised for its stunning animation, but honestly? I can’t even get behind that. Sure, they invented an entirely new animation technique that involves painting pastels on frosted glass and lacquering over that, so that’s pretty cool. But most of the most dramatic shots are lifted wholesale from Bambi, thirty years before they started recycling animation. And the photo-realistic squirrels are extremely creepy.\n\nAnd remember when I said I wasn’t a fan of being preached at in my cartoons? Trees straight up shows a tree turning into a cross out of absolutely nowhere. I think it’s trying to compare a tree’s death and rebirth to Jesus, and the words do bring up God, but after all those nature shots it just feels forced.\n\nBLAME IT ON THE SAMBA\n\nOh, thank God, a decent short. This is the only piece in this entire movie that I truly loved, and it wasn’t even made for this movie! Blame It On The Samba was written for Saludos Amigos, then they animated it for Three Caballeros but cut it out too. Because work was so far along on it, it ended up here. The song is based on Apanhei-te, Cavaquinho by Ernesto Nazaret, given English lyrics by Ray Gilbert, and sung by the Dinning Sisters. It’s a welcome bit of life in this dull, dull movie.\n\nJosé and Donald are back and feeling a little down, probably because Panchito isn’t there. So in the absence of their favorite gun-toting rooster, my precious little Aracuan takes on the task of cheering them up! He takes them to a fold-up café and plays different instruments to entice them into a dance number. Because nothing says happiness like the power of dance. There are some fun visuals with the Caballeros dancing on a musical staff and a moment that made me smile so wide where the Aracuan squeaks along with the music.\n\nBut this is Three Caballeros, so, naturally, things get weird. The Aracuan shakes up a giant cocktail and sucks José and Donald into it. There they find another pretty live action lady, Ethel Smith, dressed like a Brazilian woman but white as the driven snow. She plays a mean organ though, and naturally Donald is instantly smitten. The two dance on top of the organ while the Aracuan smacks her legs and hides her eyes.\n\nAnd then things get abstract. For some reason, though, it’s a lot more fun than in Caballeros. Probably because it’s not nearly so long. The Aracuan blows some Mary Blair-esque bubbles and sings with some disembodied lips that chase Donald and José around a musical staff. Then we’re back to the organ all of a sudden… and the Aracuan sets it on fire and rolls out a stick of dynamite to blow it up! Fortunately, this is a cartoon so no one’s hurt and Smith just keeps on going until the Aracuan closes up the menu cafe.\n\nOkay, it’s been done before. The animation’s not super fluid. There’s no narrative. The live action feels out of place. The problems with this one are just as numerous as they are in the rest of them. But it made me happy, which is more than any of these things can say. The Aracuan makes everything better.\n\nPECOS BILL\n\nOkay. One more. I can do this. I think.\n\nPecos Bill is a fakelore hero who actually debuted in a 1910 novel, but you can read some of the legends here. It’s by far the longest piece which is particularly irritating because so much of it is filler. It’s extremely cartoony and feels almost like a Warner Brothers’ cartoon. There’s nothing wrong with them, but it’s not Disney’s usual style.\n\nIt also got heavily censored in recent years for… some reason. They awkwardly edited out Bill’s cigarette from nearly every scene, resulting in some strange hand and mouth gestures. Also, the guns and the casual racism are just fine, as is José’s cigar in the previous short. I mean, come on, Disney, if you’re going to deface your own art at least enforce your Puritanical values consistently.\n\nWe open on Blue Shadows on the Trail, an interminable song where desert animals doing their thing at night while the Sons of the Pioneers croon about the darkness. It’s long. It’s dull. It’s dark. The only nice thing I can say about it is there’s a turtle. Another live action frame segment begins for absolutely no reason except to show off Roy Rogers and Trigger, the “smartest horse in the movies”. I know they were massive celebrities in the 40s but it just feels extremely forced, like Disney was begging people to see their movie. This also marks another appearance for Luanna Patten and Bobby Driscoll from Song of the South.\n\nFortunately, this scene is way less weird than the last time we saw Luanna. The Sons of the Pioneers are here, so it’s not just one adult with these two kids, and Luanna calls Rogers “Uncle Roy” at one point. So, points to Disney for learning, I guess, even if the band looks like they’d rather be anywhere else. Luanna is scared by the howling “ki-yotes” and asks why they howl like that. Roy Rogers says that’s quite a story and basically tells the whole thing before it gets started. There’s also an irritating bit where Bobby gets annoyed by the idea of a woman in the story. Which… no. Stop.\n\nFinally, after like five minutes of set up, we transition into the animated sequence. Roy Rogers draws a map of the United States through the eyes of a Texan. Baby Bill falls off a wagon going west, goes up to a mother “ki-yote” for food and melts her heart. He learns to be better at everything than all the animals in the desert because he’s just that awesome. Then he finds a baby horse starving in the desert and rescues him from buzzards and the two become best buds. And Baby Widowmaker is so cute!\n\nThen we go into Pecos Bill’s theme song and little snippets of Bill’s various adventures with Widowmaker and his guns. It’s a fun little number despite one questionable verse and an overabundance of yodeling, and memorable enough to be included on Big Thunder Mountain’s area loop. But like most of this segment, it goes on way too long.\n\nHe lassoes a tornado and lights a cigarette with a lightning bolt (or doesn’t, depending on which version you’re watching). He ends a drought by stealing water from California to bring to Texas, creating the Gulf of Mexico (and now California has no water and they’re on fire. thanks a lot Bill). He beats the tar out of cattle thieves and knocks their gold teeth into the mountains. He rides through the desert, nearly dehydrates to death, and digs out the Rio Grande River. He shoots the stars out of the sky except for the Lone Star State. And if this all sounds boring…. yeah. The only energy comes from the song. Other than that, the sequence never ends.\n\nOh, yeah, and then there’s the Painted Desert scene. Smoking’s not okay, but Pecos just randomly shooting at Natives dancing is totally kosher. I mean, Wikipedia didn’t even include it under its controversies page, and this is as bad as the song from Peter Pan! Pecos is portrayed as an awesome hero for scaring these people half to death for no reason at all. It’s really, really bad.\n\nIf any one of those stories were given any kind of gravity, they would be fine (except for the Painted Desert). But they’re not. They’re like four lines each and there’s so many of them. But finally it ends and we see Bill and Widowmaker hanging out headbutting buffalo. As you do. Then Bill lays eyes on a beautiful cowgirl riding down the river on a catfish while fixing her makeup. As you do.\n\nThe first woman he’s ever seen is “powerfully stimulating” and gives Bill a “right peculiar feeling” which is… woah now. There’s a decidedly minor drunk on love moment where Bill swims around in the pools of Sue’s eyes and even Widowmaker thinks this is weird. But Bill and Sue start on a whirlwind love affair, culminating in Bill taking her up a mountain and rearranging the stars to say “Sweet Sue, I love you”. Which… awww. Sue grabs Bill’s face and kisses him, and Bill’s guns jump out of his pocket to shoot wildly on their own.\n\nFast forward to Bill and Sue’s wedding day. Sue insists on having a huge bustle and being married riding Widowmaker. The jealous horse is not even a little bit on board with this and bucks like crazy. To her credit, though, Sue manages to hang on for quite a while without a care in the world.\n\nBut then her bustle makes her start bouncing higher and higher. It takes forever for anyone to do anything but sit there and watch her. Finally (I’m using that word a lot in this review), Pecos Bill steps up, cool as a cucumber, throws his lasso to get her down… and misses. Sue bounces all the way to the moon and never comes down. Pecos abandons civilization and goes back to live with the ki-yotes, and they all howl out their pain together.\n\nHaving such a dark, downer ending is completely nonsensical for a movie that opened by telling us how much fun we’re going to have. Again, I really, really think Pecos Bill and Johnny Appleseed should have switched places. Cut out Blue Shadows, the live action, and the racism to make it a reasonable length, and let the movie end on those pretty apple blossoms. Instead, it just leaves me feeling cold, which isn’t good because I wasn’t enjoying the short to begin with. I mean, Make Mine Music had a sad ending, too, but at least it softened the blow by showing Willie singing in heaven. This one just ends.\n\nFor some reason, though, Pecos is popular enough to warrant the only real park representation Melody Time has. Pecos Bill’s Tall Tale Inn and Cafe serves up burritos, burgers, nachos and truly stellar taco salads to hungry visitors of the Magic Kingdom’s Frontierland. The walls are decorated with memorabilia from different tall tale figures, including Paul Bunyan’s axe and a cookpot owned by Melody Time’s own Johnny Appleseed. Pecos Bill and Slue-Foot Sue also starred in the longest-running theatrical production in history at Disneyland’s Golden Horseshoe Review from 1955 to 1986. It starred Betty Taylor as Sue and Disney legend Wally Boag as Bill, the latter of whom was a close personal friend of Walt’s and a major part of the parks’ history.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI think I’ve made my thoughts on Melody Time abundantly clear. It’s a low-rent version of Make Mine Music, which was already pretty low-rent to begin with. The format has grossly outstayed its welcome, the shorts are uninspired, and the music is dated and irritating. Everything here is lower quality than even Bongo. I don’t like bashing on films like this, but man, I could not wait to be done with this one.\n\nFavorite scene: The Aracuan squeaking along to Blame it on the Samba. Such a little cutie.\n\nFinal rating: 2/10. The only positives I can find are the pretty Mary Blair artwork, my undying love of the Aracuan (have I mentioned that enough?), and the colors in Bumble Boogie. I’ve never been so happy to be done with a review in my life. (EDIT: Oh, past me… it gets soooo much worse.)\n\nI don’t like being this negative, guys, I really don’t. Maybe I’m just cranky because I’m really tired of package films. But there’s good news! We’ve got a live action film I’ve never seen next, so that’s exciting, and then only one more package film to go. Even better, the last package film is actually really, really good! We’re officially out of the woods! We’re over the hump! We’ve reached the light at the end of the tunnel!\n\n… right?"
