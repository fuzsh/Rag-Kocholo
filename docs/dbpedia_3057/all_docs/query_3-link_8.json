        "text": "Located approximately fifteen minute’s drive from Disneyland (Anaheim, California) is one oft-overlooked Disney gem that’s worth discovering for yourself! The Hilbert Museum of California Art (located on the Chapman University campus) primarily focuses on California artists - most of which contributed to the California watercolor movement of the 1930s and 1940s. Mark and Janet Hilbert have been expanding one of the most comprehensive collections of representational California artwork over some twenty years. Among this fantastic array of California scenic paintings are numerous works of Chouinard institute alums and Walt Disney Studios artists. This collection has generously, freely been made accessible to students and the general art appreciating public.\n\nPlease, step this way as we preview their most amazing, unique collection of works produced by Walt Disney Productions artists!\n\n“THE WALT-ERA SCENIC PAINTERS”\n\nDuring the depression era, there were many artists that came to California searching for work and trying to survive. Some of these individuals had the good privilege to receive a scholarship to Madame Chouinard’s art school, where they were swiftly employed by studios like Walt Disney Productions. One such artist was a character animator named Preston Blair. During the 1930’s, Preston was assigned to animate Mickey Mouse’s short subjects, and was so good at it, that he was ultimately assigned to animate the character of Mickey Mouse for the Sorcerer’s Apprentice segment of the feature film Fantasia. Preston left during the 1941 animator’s strike, but while he was still employed by Walt Disney Studios he captured a rather scenic sunset over Los Angeles. This intersection depicted in watercolor during 1938, is virtually unrecognizable today as it is mounted by towering skyscrapers! Preston was no doubt one exceptional character animator (whose contributions we all continue to enjoy today), but we’ll always remember his whimsical Bunker Hill Cable Car when we hear the name Preston Blair.\n\nIn preparation for Saludos Amigos, Lee and his wife Mary joined Walt and Lillian Disney on a (Good Neighbor Policy sponsored) “Goodwill” tour of South America. Many other artists joined them on this artistic excursion, like prolific landscape painter Ralph Hulett.\n\nRalph painted scores of background pieces, from castles and enchanted forests of Walt Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to the mysterious jungles of Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book. As you walk the exhibition halls, you’ll notice many of Ralph Hulett’s representations of Los Angeles’ “urban jungle” on display inside The Hilbert Museum of California Art. Like Preston’s Bunker Hill Cable Car painting, these works are a testament to a common habit many artists had - to practice their craft around Los Angeles (and even all of California)!\n\nClaude Coats was another distinct background artist whose layered style is especially apparent in films like The Old Mill, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Ferdinand the Bull. Claude went on to develop an array of colorful stylized backgrounds for Walt Disney Studios diverse films over the years, including Dumbo, Saludos Amigos, Victory Through Air Power, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, Melody Time, Song of The South, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Fun and Fancy Free, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp. Claude and his wife were avid travelers, gathering inspiration for his work from the places they would visit. (Notice the following painting of Claude’s which depicts workers around a circus tent.)\n\nClaude was so good at set design, that Walt personally positioned him as a Disneyland Art Director in 1955. Now, Claude would use his power to develop magnificently immersive settings, for attractions like the Grand Canyon and Primeval World Diorama, The Submarine Voyage, and Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. Claude would also help develop attractions for the 1964 - 1965 New York World’s Fair (like the Ford Magic Skyway). Amidst his 54 years with Walt Disney Studios, Claude continued his keen enthusiasm for painting scenes during his personal time."
