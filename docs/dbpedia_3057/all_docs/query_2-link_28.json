        "text": "Plot\n\nThe plot is introduced in newspaper headlines that Fifi, Minnie Mouse's pekingese, has been dognapped, along with a description of the suspect, Peg Leg Pete. A radio transmission detailing the suspect's get-away car is heard by police officer Mickey Mouse and his sidekick Donald Duck. The pair soon see Peg Leg Pete speed by in the car and they chase after him, Mickey driving a motorcycle and Donald riding in a sidecar. Despite Pete's evasive maneuvers he is unable to escape from Mickey and Donald, and they eventually follow him to his hideout in an abandoned sawmill.\n\nInside, Pete chains Fifi to the wall and grabs a submachine gun. Mickey and Donald follow Pete into the sawmill and hold him at gunpoint. The film is filled with various gags showing the two law men as bumbling and incompetent, yet at every turn they are able to stay ahead of Pete, but not capture him.\n\nFinally, while Mickey and Donald are standing on a log, Pete turns on a circular saw positioned to cut the log. Mickey and Donald run to stay ahead of the blade, but eventually the end of the log comes and the saw blade shakes loose and spins out of control. The blade proves a threat for all three of the characters, but eventually Pete gets his peg leg caught in the center hole and brings it to a stop. Mickey and Donald restrain him with a corset, and in the final scene Mickey and Donald march Pete off to jail with the now-free Fifi angrily barking at him.\n\nRelease history\n\n1934 – Original theatrical release\n\nc. 1992 – Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #28 (TV)\n\nc. 1992 – Donald's Quack Attack, episode #54 (TV)\n\n1998 – The Ink and Paint Club, episode #1.32: \"Goin' to the Dogs\" (TV)\n\n2002 – Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White (DVD)"
