        "text": "The Call Of The Wild\n\nTrailer\n\nDisney sure does love their dog movies in 2020 huh? Disney+ already had Togo, a film I really liked, and it already also had its live-action remake of Lady And The Tramp, which I most definitely did not like. Before any of them there was February’s The Call Of The Wild, which joined Togo as a film about a dog-sled pack engaged in a high-stakes adventure, and Lady In The Tramp in that it featured a primarily CGI canine cast, that the production team was trying to merge into a live-action environment.\n\nThe Call Of The Wild has already had its judgement from history in many ways, a real box-office bomb in a year where Disney could ill-afford any of those. Its recent release on Disney+ gives me the chance to offer an opinion seven months removed from its theatrical failure, and to be honest I saw a lot of things from the outset that I really did like. A director whose previous work on the How To Train Your Dragon series that I really admired, a human cast that was full of great names aside from Harrison Ford’s and a basis that comes from one of the books that could accurately be called a member of the great American canon, are all things that marked The Call Of The Wild out. But it failed for some reason, so I was looking forward to figuring out why.\n\nIn the late 19th century the St Bernard/Scotch Collie cross Buck is ripped away from his carefree life in California by dognappers, who sell him to be a sled-dog in the Yukon. There, Buck encounters many people and has many adventures: with kindly mail runners Perrault (Omar Sy) and Francois (Cara Gee); in a competition of dominance with vicious pack leader Spitz; with ignorant prospector Hal (Dan Stevens) whose lust for gold overrides his own incompetence; and with mournful frontiersman John Thornton (Ford), with whom Buck travels deep into the unknown, followed always by the call of the wild.\n\nWhy did The Call Of The Wild fail? Aside from a lack of interest in the modern-day film-watching public for a story like this? If I was asked to put it down to one thing, I would say that Chris Sanders’ film is too uneven, too pared down and ultimately too dull to really capture the imagination the way that an adaptation like this really needs to. It’s a failure of structure and editing then, that hobbles The Call Of The Wild when all of the elements for it to be a success were there, and in spades.\n\nI mean, it’s over said on some films, but The Call Of The Wild is all over the place in many respects. Perhaps this is a reflection of the Jack London novel, but the story is episodic to a fault. You go in expecting a tale of Harrison Ford and his dog in the great wild yonder, but that takes the better part of half the films running time to materialise. In the lead-up to that we have Buck the pampered Californian dog, Buck the abused theft victim, Buck the mail-sled prodigy, Buck the rival of Spitz, Buck the abused dog of villainous Hal. Anyone of those stories could be parsed out into a 45 minute tale, so I’m afraid that we are back to the territory of “Would have been better as a TV show”. In attempting to tell the story of the entire novel, Sanders has hobbled himself.\n\nAnd then when you get into the nitty gritty of things, deeper flaws begin to emerge. The Call Of The Wild clearly had some editing problems. It’s the only way to explain how actors of the calibre of Stevens, as the narrative’s villain, and Karen Gillan, get left with such little screen-time. Gillan in particular is pretty much blink-and-you’ll-miss-her: I didn’t even realise it was her playing Hal’s sister until the credits rolled. It’s good that The Call Of The Wild tries to give the film a bit of structure with an actual antagonist, but the way that Hal seems to fade-in and out of things, never long enough to fully stake a place we could call engaging, would seem to indicate to me that a good bit of The Call Of The Wild has been left on the cutting room floor. Stevens is left with a few minutes of screentime where he comes across as comically evil, which is disappointing.\n\nI’m not sure if I would call it a complaint exactly, but the film has also sanitised a bit of the source material. In some cases this is undoubtedly a good thing, such as sections of London’s tale where native peoples are not shown exactly in the best light (Sanders’ film largely side-steps the issue, with only one native peoples character in little more than a cameo). In others, such as the duel between Buck and Spitz – decidedly more final in the book, but with a rather unsatisfying resolution here – The Call Of The Wild betrays a certain amount of reluctance to make something with, if you’ll excuse the use of the term, a bit of bite. And bite is something that the film badly needs on some occasion.\n\nOf course it isn’t all bad. At the end of the day this is a classic story, and Sanders is able to get you to empathise with this adorable mongrel on plenty of occasions, even if Buck’s intelligence seriously strains the bounds of believability sometimes (one will seriously wonder why they don’t just throw in the towel and have him talk). There are glimpses of interesting ideas that, while only half-formed, are still welcome, like the mixed-race couple of Sy and Gee, or the way that the script attempts to make the Thornton character a man whose recourse to the wild is reflective of his inability to remain in a civilised world that traumatised him in more ways than one. The titular call, manifested in the shadowy vision of a wolf that Buck frequently sees at key moments, might be a bit romantic, but fits well into the film’s larger purpose as a love-letter to the Yukon wilderness.\n\nBut now we have to talk about the elephant in the room, or rather the St Bernard/Scotch Collie cross in the room. Obviously, there are things that Buck, and other dogs, are called upon to do in this film, that would be difficult to accomplish with an actual dog actor. Difficult, but not impossible. One has to only look as far back as a few months to see Togo, which accomplished a lot with actual dogs. But The Call Of The Wild’s production team made the decision to instead have their dogs be CGI creations. The rather big names on the human side of the cast generally do fine work – Ford leans in hard to this role, giving a much needed gravitas in both his time on-screen and in a raspy narration – but they are continually called to get across that skill in emoting in scenes that they are sharing with an unimpressive computer animation.\n\nThe result is not that great, and especially not that great outside of a cinema screen. Buck, and the other animals, look cartoony and unreal, and they do not adequately fit into the live-action setting. In this, The Call Of The Wild is less like Togo and more like Lady And The Tramp, another film where Disney were incapable of melding the real and the fake in a manner that does not make the viewer feel at best amused, and at worst actively repulsed. A real dog may well, with the right training, right precautions and with the appropriate assistance of CGI, been able to actually pull this off. While more difficult, this would undoubtedly, in my opinion, have been a better move for the film. As it is, every scene, frame and act is hobbled with the fact that the main character makes this look like Who Framed Roger Rabbit? It’s 2020, and Jurassic Park is nearly three decades old: why is this still so consistently hard for studios to pull off?\n\nAnd that glaring flaw at the visual heart of the film is a real shame, because otherwise it looks absolutely spectacular. While CGI and green screen plays a big part, The Call Of The Wild lives up to its name, at least insofar as its depictions of the wild goes. From the moment Buck emerges from the hold of a boat and gets his first look at Alaska, right on through to later sections when he and Harrison Ford march about in places that are not yet on maps – in many ways, the era depicted was the last for such things – Sanders’ camera is giving the spotlight to the glorious boundlessness of nature. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński was presumably key here, and it really does get put across quite well, that mixture of untamed beauty mixed with uncivilised brutality. There are flights from avalanches, ice-water escapes, trips through swirling rapids and fights-to-the-finish in places as far away from human habitation as you could conceivably have gotten. In all this, it is fair to say that The Call Of The Wild is a visually engaging movie, which makes the problem with its less-real canine inhabitants all the more jarring. John Powell’s stirring score backs the visuals up, everything you would expect of an auditory effort to imbue in our ears the sights and sounds of unexplored Alaska/Yukon.\n\nThe Call Of The Wild probably didn’t deserve the commercial drubbing that it received in the days before COVID. It’s not a disaster, not like the 2020 Lady And The Tramp was. But there is just simply too much going wrong here. In adapting the entire novel, Sanders creates a film that feels disjointed and out of touch with what it really needs to be. Its editing is crude at times, and vital members of the cast are subsequently screwed over in terms of screen-time. And right at the centre of the frame is a CGI creation that simply doesn’t cut it, and will never let you forget. It’s efforts to get across the natural beauty of the wilderness, the performance from Ford and the not-terrible adventure story in tries to relate are all positives in the film’s favour, but they are not enough to save it. Give Togo another look instead. Not recommended.\n\n(All images are copyright of 20th Century Studios)."
