        "text": "The artist chosen for the stained glass windows was Frederick Stymetz Lamb, the second generation star of the prestigious firm of J & R Lamb Studios of New York. Frederick Stymetz Lamb designed and supervised the installation of twenty large windows and many smaller ones totaling over one-hundred. In the 1906 quake, all the windows survived intact except the large rose window in the front of the church. When the church was rebuilt, the rose window was replaced by a large arch window entitled “Lilies of the Field.” Unfortunately, this window cannot be seen from within the church as it is blocked by the organ.\n\nOf the remaining 19 large windows, six line the sides of the nave, ten reside in the east and west transepts and three are prominently centered in the chancel. Smaller windows are high above the nave and galleries of the transepts. There are thirty-two smaller windows with portraying individuals from Biblical stories or symbols of Christian virtues.\n\nThe 12 windows high above the nave include Stephen, Agnes, Peter,\n\nPriscilla, John, Hope, Abraham, Hagar and her child Ishmael, Moses, Pharaoh's Daughter, Joshua, and Deborah. Although these windows are quite artful, they are not situated well for viewing. But they do serve to filter brilliantly colored light to fill the church.\n\nThe six large windows located in the nave are divided into two themes, one depicting the life of Christ while the other shows his divine attributes.\n\nOn the east side of the nave, the first window shows Mary being told by the angel she would bear a child. The second shows Joseph, Mary, and Jesus fleeing to Egypt, and the third shows a very young Jesus assisting his mother and father in their daily chores. All three seem to show virtues of devotion, care, gentleness, and even humor. On an outside wall where Joseph worked on his carpentry is a birdhouse, with three resident doves.\n\nThe west side's first window shows the scene of Jesus being chosen for crucifixion instead of the criminal Barabbas. The second illustrates the proclamation of the resurrection. The\n\nHaving been a star athlete and exceptional student in his hometown of Columbus, Mississippi, young Joshua Meador had an appointment to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. But, he had the courage to tell his father he wanted to study art instead.\n\nHe attended the Chicago Art Institute during the depths of the great depression, and graduated into the harsh economic realities of the day. On the suggestion of a friend, he went west to California and submitted his portfolio to Walt Disney. He was hired, and it ended up being the professional job lasting the rest of his life. Josh worked in the area of special animated effects, and put the stardust in Tinkerbell's magic and the iconic \"Z\" in television's Zorro. He was one of the art directors for Fantasia and was one of the team given the Oscar for special effects in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.\n\nOnce in America, he busied himself as a working artist, painting iconography in the interiors of orthodox churches in the east and working his way west as far west as Chicago and Racine, Wisconsin. Then, he made a trip west, and was inspired by the beauty and grandeur of the western mountains and dynamic California Coast. He painted these natural wonders plein air, and would finish them in the mid to late afternoon in his studio when the day's later light allowed richer color could be captured amid the sounds of ever present classical music. He often said his paintings of these natural American wonders were in celebration of the freedom he had found in his new land.\n\nAfter the passing of his first wife, Alexander married nurse Dorothy Travis. When Alexander II was born, Alexander was 57 years old. He found new enthusiasm for his work and great joy in his new family. In time, Alexander saw his son grow into a fine artist in his own right.\n\nFor Californian fans of Alexander Dzigurski, the somewhat inconvenient news is that this exhibition is in Shreveport, a long long way from us. But the good news is that in time, this exhibition may be coming to a California museum near you. Beginning April 17, Bodega Bay Heritage Gallery is hosting an exhibition entitled \"Generations\" which features the work of two generations of Dzigurskis side by side, Alexander and Alexander II along with the work of another American legendary artist, John W. Hilton and his daughter Kathi.\n\nThe paintings of Alexander Dzigurski and John W. Hilton have received glowing admiration from art lovers for decades. Both artists have compelling and unique biographies and easily identifiable and fascinating styles. But beyond their art, each has been blessed with a child who carried on his artistic legacy. Alexander's son Alexander II, and John's daughter Kathi, have distinguished themselves as well known artists, following the paths of their respective fathers.\n\nAt Bodega Bay Heritage Gallery, we are pleased to offer historic paintings of Alexander Dzigurski and John W. Hilton, and we are privileged and thrilled to represent the contemporary works of Alexander Dzigurski II and and Kathi Hilton. Alex maintains his studio in Mountain View, CA, and Kathi resides and paints in Roosevelt, Utah."
