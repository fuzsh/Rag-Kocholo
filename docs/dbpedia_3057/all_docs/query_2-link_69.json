        "text": "When animal movies are bad, they're really bad. And there are a lot of them. \"Marmaduke.\" \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\" \"Dunston Checks In.\" They're bad enough to make you groan at the mere thought of a trained animal. But still, there are good ones to be found, more than enough to make up a top-10 list of genuinely enjoyable family-friendly animal movies. We don't know yet on what side of the fence \"The Secret Lives of Pets\" will fall, but we'll keep our fingers crossed.\n\n'Babe' (1995)\n\nThis best-picture-nominated film sounds like it should be terrible. It's a short list, the one of good live-action movies featuring talking animals, and it sounds even sketchier when you throw into the mix a precocious pig raised by sheepdogs. But \"Babe\" has serious storybook charm, telling the story of an orphaned piglet raised by border collies to herd sheep on a farm. That'll do, pig.\n\n'Bambi' (1942)\n\nDisney's fifth animated feature film, about a fawn coming of age with a cohort of woodland creatures, remains one of the studio's most gorgeous, a restrained and painterly celebration of the beauty, and fragility, of nature. Of course, nature can be cruel, and the film teaches impressionable young viewers that even mothers die. But between the hard life lessons, there's plenty of Thumper, Flower and the young prince cavorting in April showers.\n\n'War Horse' (2011)\n\nSteven Spielberg's Old-Hollywoodesque adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's 1982 children's novel, which also spawned a Tony Award-winning stage play, is suffused with warmth and old-school charm. Set in England on the brink of World War I, Jeremy Irvine plays a teenage farm boy who falls in love with a horse his family sells at the start of the war. The narrative shifts then, following the horse from a British regiment, to a German ambulance, to a French farmhouse, the audience experiencing war through the frightened eyes of a horse that never forgets home.\n\n'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' (2005)\n\nStop-motion animator Nick Park had been delighting with his \"Wallace & Gromit\" short-film series since the '80s with absurdest adventures featuring absent-minded (and cheese-loving) inventor Wallace and his smart but silent (and awesome) dog, Gromit. He took his claymation charm to the big time with this feature-length film from Aardman Animations, and it's every bit as clever as those shorts, an incredibly British (i.e. charming), child-friendly homage to horror films about a quiet town whose giant-vegetable competition is threatened by a mutant rabbit.\n\n'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' (1961)\n\nThis Disney favorite is more famous for its human villain than for any of its 101 dalmatian dogs, even Pongo and Perdita, who fall in love and inspire their human counterparts, Roger and Anita, to follow suit. But the reason nefarious dog-napper Cruella de Vil is so memorably wicked is that it galls that anyone could bring themselves to skin so many cute puppies in pursuit of a fur coat. Essential Disney for anyone who considers canine companions an indelible part of human families.\n\n'The Incredible Journey' (1963)\n\nThis live-action Walt Disney film follows the journey of three lost pets — Luath the Labrador retriever, Bodger the bull terrier and Tao the Siamese cat — as they make a treacherous journey through the Canadian wilderness to find their way back home. Also a favorite, if you have a soft spot for Michael J. Fox and prefer your cats fluffier and voiced by Sally Field, is the 1993 remake, \"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.\"\n\n'Charlotte's Web' (1973)\n\nYou won't confuse this rustic animation for Disney's, but this scrappy Hanna-Barbera Productions musical adaptation of E.B. White's classic tearjerker novel remains a favorite. Debbie Reynolds voices Charlotte, an enterprising barnyard spider who conspires to save a terrific pig named Wilbur from slaughter. It's a smile-through-your-tears kind of story. Unexpected bonus: Thanks to one goofy song, it's also the film that taught many a kid the word \"smorgasbord.\"\n\n'March of the Penguins' (2005)\n\nThis gorgeous nature documentary, co-produced by the National Geographic Society, did something that precious few documentaries ever do: It went mainstream. Set to Morgan Freeman's sonorous narration, the film offers an up-close look at the beautiful, at times majestic and at times deeply silly emperor penguin, and the treacherous annual mating ritual the animal undertakes as it leaves the ocean for a journey deep into Antarctica. It became the second most successful documentary at the box office of all time (behind \"Fahrenheit 9/11\") and took home an Oscar for best documentary.\n\n'My Dog Skip' (2000)\n\nSpoiler alert: \"My Dog Skip\" does not pass the central test of doesthedogdie.com. That's unendurable for some viewers. But all pets die, as shy young Willie (Frankie Muniz) comes to learn growing up in 1940s Mississippi alongside his beloved Jack Russell terrier, Skip. The ending prompts some serious waterworks, but as anyone who has ever loved and lost a pet knows, they're worth it.\n\n'The Aristocats' (1970)\n\nTrue to life, dogs tend to hog all the attention in movies, and Disney has devoted a score of movies to canines (\"The Fox and the Hound,\" \"101 Dalmations,\" \"Lady and the Tramp\"). But Disney does give kitties their due in this animated classic about a family of spoiled Parisian cats set to inherit their owner's fortune and who are aided by a scrappy alley cat when plans go awry. Eva Gabor famously voices mother cat Duchess."
