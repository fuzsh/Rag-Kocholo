        "text": "The second and my other top favourite installment of Scooby Doo is this, the New Scooby Doo Movies. In this series the gang would meet a Guest Star who would help them solve the mystery. These Guest Stars included Batman and Robin, Laurel and Hardy, Sonny and Cher, Phylis Diller, Don Knotts and the Harlem Globetrotters. These are some pretty classic episodes and I loved these as a kid. It wasnt too hard to pick out my Top 10 Favourite episodes of this show as some of the guest stars were great to watch team up with the Scooby Gang. Anyway here goes\n\n1: THE DYNAMIC SCOOBY DOO AFFAIR\n\nA case of counterfeiting and vanising houses see Scooby and the gang team up with Batman and Robin to get the bottom of the strange goings on. Is the counterfeiting the work of notorious Villains the Joker and the Penguein or is it something to do with that spooky figure in the purple cloak. Scooby Doo and the Gang working alongside Superheroes Batman and Robin and swap crime solving for crime fighting was an interesting dynamic and made for some pretty good moments when trying to catch the villain .\n\n2: WEDNESDAY IS MISSING\n\nScooby and the Gang after getting lost in fog end up becomming house keepers for none other than The Addams Family. Things take a turn for the worst when Wednesday disapears and it is upt to the Mystery Inc gang to find her and stop the Vulture who is seemingly the mastermind of the trouble. Whoever came up with the idea Scooby Doo meeting the Addams family was an absolute genius. This episode offers some great moments and scenes as the Gang try to get to grips with the cooky wackiness of the Addams Family. A Great episode altogether\n\n3: THE FRICKERT FRACAS\n\nThe gang on a country drive bump into Comedian Jhonaton Winters and end up joining him on a visit to his friend Maud Frickert. It seem’s the rumours of Grandpa Fricket’s secret chicken formula have brought a variety of visitors and snoopers including a spooky scarecrow. Can the gang get to the bottom of this funny farm caper. The highlight of this episode has to be Shaggy, Scooby and Mr. Winters getting into some trouble on a waterwheel trying to catch the scarecrow.\n\n4: GUESS WHOSE KNOTT COMING TO DINNER\n\nThe gang cross paths with Don Knotts when taking shelter in a spooky old Mansion but things take a confusing turn when they are mistaken for the missing owners Nieces and Nephews. Things also become more confusing ans it becomes hard to figure out which ghost is which. Don Knott’s frequent guises in the piesode are the highlight as he goes from Maid to Butler to Pirate to Ghost and make for absolute hilarity as he cant seem to get it the gang are not who he has mistaken them for.\n\n5: A GOOD MEDIUM IS RARE\n\nThe gang return a lost dog to a spooky castle owned by none other than Phyliss Diller. Someone is after Miss Diller’s Jewels and the gang join Miss Diller when she invited to a seance to communicte with one of her many deceased husbands. Is it for real or another part of the plot to steal Miss Diller’s jewels. Phyliss Diller with her witty remarks and trademark laugh adds a lot of comedy to the episode as she and the gang try to uncover the thieves plot.\n\n6: SANDY DUNCAN’S JEKYLL AND HYDE\n\nThe gang meet Sandy Duncan where the set/production of her new movie is being sabotaged by a mysterious presence determined to stop the studio from being closed after the movie is finished. The gang soon find it is a case of lights camera action as they find are dealing with someone well versed in the movie business. This episode being set in mobie studio see’s the gang do some globe trotting across the sets from Ancient Egypt to Shanghai to Alaska making for some great chase scenes.\n\n7: THE SECRET OF SHARK ISLAND\n\nA trip to the beach turns into a trip to Shark Island when the gang pick up Sony and Cher. They soon find out the island is being haunted by the Shark God. After becomming stranded on the island due to flooding, Scooby, the gang, Sony and Cher soon try to the get to the bottom of some very fishy business. A huge amount of the comedy comes from Cher’s dry wit and sarcasm espically when it comes to her Husband, I guess a run down hotel haunted by a shark god was her idea of a Romantic Second Honeymoon.\n\n8: THE GHOST OF BIGFOOT\n\nThe gang join Laurel and Hardy at a popular Ski Lodge where the ghost of Bigfoot has scared away all the guests. The gang team up with Laurel and Hardy to investigate these starnage happenings and uncover much more than ghostly business going on. Teaming the comic antics of Laurel and Hardy with the goofiness of Scooby and Shaggy brings a lot of comedic scenes to the episode such as a wild ski ride or running from Big Foot.\n\n9: THE GHOST OF THE RED BARON\n\nThe gang reunite with the Three Stooges at an airport haunted by the ghost of Red Baron where Curly Joe has taken up the Job of crop duster for the corn fields. The Red Baron however is out to destroy the corn fields and airport so the Gang and the Three Stooges must stop him before he can. Everything’s all up in the air in this episode as Scooby takes to the skies even though he does not have a pilot licence but that doesent stop him fro comming to the rescue to help direct Curly Joe on how to fly the plane without a loud crash.\n\n10: THE LOCHNESS MESS\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters join the gang on a New England trip to vsist Shaggy’s uncle. They soon the area is running amok with colonial ghosts and a Sea Serpent but what is the reason for all the ghostly happenings or is there something stranger afoot? In this thier second of three adventures with the Globetrotters this one is my favourite as the gang along with the globetrotters must duck and dodge the ghosts.\n\nHONOURABLE MENTIONS\n\nGhastly Ghost Town\n\nThe Spooky Fog of Juneberry\n\nThe Ghostly Creep from the Deep\n\nThe Phantom of the Country Music Hall\n\nThe Caped Crusader Caper\n\nThe Mystery of Haunted Island\n\nThe Haunted Showboat\n\nAnyway that completes this list and my final post celebrating Scooby Doo’s 50th Anniversary, Happy Anniversary Scooby\n\nSCOOBY DOOBY DOO!!!!!!!\n\nContinuing my Scooby Doo related posts, this post lists my Top 10 Favourite episodes from the original classic Scooby Doo Where Are You. Having been a big fan of the series it was really easy to pick out my Top 10 Favourite Episodes as some of these were ones I absolutely adored as a kid. There will also be two further posts listing favourite episodes from other Scooby Doo Shows. But anyway here they are and if your a Scooby Fan like me then this list will give you a spot of childhood nostalgia\n\n1: WHAT A NIGHT FOR A KNIGHT\n\nIn this thier first case Scooby and the Gang investigate the disapearance of an Archeology Professor and the legend of the Black Knight, a Suit of armour that comes to life when the moon is full. To borrow a disney turn of phrase this episode was the one that started it all and set the scene for many adventures to come. The chase scene in the Museum with the Gang and the Black Knight are pure hilarity not to mention Scooby flying a plane without a pilot licence.\n\n2: A CLUE FOR SCOOBY DOO\n\nDuring a beach party the gang run afoul of a glowing sea ghost rumoured to be the ghost of Captain Cutler. As the gang investigate the fish going ons further they soon find connections between the ghost and missing yachts from the Marina. The gang’s second caper takes them under the sea for some spooky encounters. staying true to the title it’s Scooby who find’s the most important clue. Throw in a hilarous trap gone wrong sequence and it’s undersea adventue you wont forget\n\n3: WHAT THE HEX GOING ON?\n\nScooby and the gang visit thier friend Sharon Weatherby at her country estate where some spooky things have been going on. The cuase of the spooky trouble is the ghost of Elias Kingston who demans the weatherby fortune given to him or everyone will suffer a terrible fate. This episode offers some pretty funny scenes such as Scooby trying to tell fortunes with a little help of Shaggy’s ventriloquism and shaggy on roller skates crashing into a shower uttering a Shaggy style line “If there’s one thing I cant stand it’s taking a bath in a Haunted House”. The ghost trap scene also includes some very clever use of video camera’s where Scooby appears to have become giant sending the ghost right into the awaiting trap.\n\n4: NEVER APE AN APE MAN\n\nAfter being hired as extras for Daphne’s Uncle’s Ape Man Monster picture, the gang hear about an old legend of a real ape man. It soon transpires it may not be a legend when a real ape man sabotages production. The gang set out to investigate and stop the Ape Man. Scooby shines in this episode in a scene where he rescues an actress and sends the ape man packing. Throw in a house with stairs that turn into slides, rooms where people dispear and it’s a quite a wacky caper.\n\n5: THE BACKSTAGE RAGE\n\nUpon discovery of a violin case full of counterfeit money the Gang’s investigation takes them to the local puppet theatre where there is clearly some spooky goings on. As the gang investigate further they soon find there really is no business like show business. The Mysterious figure in a black cape shadowing the gang around the the theatre adds an amount of spookiness to the proceedings. There are also some scenes with larger than life puppets and Mystery Inc definitely have thier work cut out for them.\n\n6: A GAGGLE OF GALLOPING GHOSTS\n\nThe Gang are visiting an old transyvanian castle but a Gypsy Fortune Teller warns them against it. The gang soon find she may have been right when upon entering the castle find it rapmant with a Vampire, Wolfman and a Frankenstein Monster and the chase is on. I love the spooky old castle setting of this episode and the chase scene as the gang run are pursued by the ghouls. Putting the Wolfman, Vampire and Frankenstein monster in was a clever idea remind one of those old universal horror movies.\n\n7: SPOOKY SPACE KOOK\n\nScooby and the gang investigate some a ghostly space craft and it’s occupant a cackling skeleton astronaut. Thier investigation takes them to an abandoned airfield where they find an assortment of interesting clues which cast doubt on the spooky space kook being real. A really good episode with some strange goings on and an assortment of funny sequences such as Scooby acidentally going an automatic dishwasher or Shaggy and Scooby parachuting from a great heigh to escape the kook.\n\n8: A NIGHT OF FRIGHT IS NO DELIGHT\n\nScooby Doo is in line to inherit a fortune only if he and the other heirs spend the night in the creepy old family mansion. Soon the other heirs start disapearing as a phantom shadow reeks havoc and soon the Gang discover it’s not shadows but Gigling Green Ghosts. Nothing beats a Good old Scooby Doo in the Spooky house storyline with plenty of good chase scene. Add in a hilarious sequence with a flying machine that helps entrap the ghosts makes it all the more enjoyable.\n\n9: JEEPERS IT’S THE CREEPER\n\nScooby and the Gang encounter an attacked bank guard with a mysterios piece of blank paper but are warned about the Creeper. The Dance is soon disrupted by the Creeper himself who is determined to get ahold of the paper so the gang must figure out what the paper means before the creeper gets it. The highlight of the episode is Scooby acidentally adopting a baby chick who follows them around everywhere which adds to the hilarity when they are trying to hide from the Creeper.\n\n10: A TIKI SCARE IS NO FAIR\n\nThe Gang’s vacation in Hawaii is disrupted by the appearance of a Witch Doctor warning everybody to leave at once or face the wrath of ancient spirit Mano Tiki Tia. The gang’s investigation takes them to a spooky ancient village filled with clues and ghosts not mention the strange old man following them. Some pretty good chase scenes in this one especially when Shaggy and Velma pretend to be Tarzan and Jane to fool the Witch Doctor.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\n\nMine Your Own Business\n\nDecoy for a Dognapper\n\nFoul Play in Fun Land\n\nScooby Doo and a Mummy Too\n\nNowhere to Hyde\n\nMystery Mask Mix Up\n\nScooby’s night with a Frozen Fight\n\nWell there you have it, My Top Ten Favourite episodes of Scooby Doo Where Are You. As I said before, when youlove a show you know what episodes you love the most. Nothing beats the original Scooby Doo in all it’s spooky glory. Stay tuned for further posts on other Scooby Series I enjoy.\n\nTo continue my series of posts celabrating the 50th anniversary of Scooby Doo, this post will be about my Top Favourite Scooby Doo Movies both live action and animated. There have been a lot of new animated ones over the last number of years which I have not yet seen but these top picks are the best in my opinion espically as many of them formed part of my childhood. Ranking these would have been impossible so in no particular order here we go.\n\n1: SCOOBY DOO MEETS THE BOO BROTHERS\n\nShaggy inherits a Southern Estate from his Uncle along with a fortune of family jewels hidden somewhere on the estate. Shaggy, Scrappy and Scooby soon find the place rampant with ghosts not to mention the escaped Circus Ape on the loose. The trio then call in the Boo Brothers to help them get rid of the ghosts and set out on the ultimate treasure hunt to find the family treasure.\n\nThe Boo Brothers are undoubtedly the clumiest wacky ghost hunters ever and add so much hilarity to the film as they “attempt” to catch the ghosts. I loved watching this as a kid and in particular the search for the family jewels as the trio follow the clues to find them bringing in an element of traditional Scooby Doo Mystery. Scrappy Doo despite being the most annoying charecter is actually tolarable in this movie. A childhood classic.\n\n2: SCOOBY DOO AND THE RELUCTANT WERWOLF\n\nCount Dracula is preparing for the yearly Monster Road Rally Race however much to his chargain the Werewolf has opted to go on vacation this year. To fix this Dracula turns Shaggy into a werwolf and brings him Scooby, Scrappy and Girlfriend Googie to Transylvania where Shaggy must compete in the Race if he ever wants to be a Human again\n\nAnother childhood classic for me, The Monster Road Race features some spooky characters like witches, skeletons a Mummy etc. This race even rivals the Wacky races with it’s wacky particpants and thier spooky antics. The Count Dracula in this movie is proabably the most nuerotic bad temepered version yet losing the plot when he does not get his way which adds to the hilarity. Just to add, When I was in secondary school me and my bestie exchanged presetns at the end of the school year knowing I loved Scooby Doo she got me this on DVD which I still have.\n\n3: SCOOBY DOO THE MOVIE\n\nAfter a clash of egos Mystery Inc go thier seperate ways but are brought back together to uncover the spooky goings on at Spooky Island. The gang soon find out they are facing the usual man in a mask scenario but the real thing and must work together to save the world and expose the fiendish mastermind behind it all.\n\nThe first live action Scooby Doo movie whilst yes being a tad cheesy is still worth a watch to see the Scooby Gang in the live action flesh. The gang are all cast perfectly in thier roles especially Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne who determined to shed her dansel in distress label has picked up some karate skills to kick some ghost butt. Some great songs also feature in the soundtrack espically a number called “Things Go Bump In The Night”.\n\n4: SCOOBY DOO 2 MONSTERS UNLEASHED\n\nThe Mystery Inc gang face blasts from the past as costumes of thier former foes are brought to life by an evil masked figure. Shaggy and Scooby after another one of thier goof ups start questioning thier roles in the gang and try to be more like proper detectives.\n\nThis is the ultimate throwback for any Scooby Doo Fan as you get to see classic Scooby Villains such as the Black Knight, Captain Cutler and the Seketon Men brought to ghoulish glowing life. The nostalgia I get from this movie is what makes it such a great watch. Aagain Sarah Michelle Gellar kicks into action with her crime fighting skills especially in a terrific scene where she duels the Black Knight.\n\n5: SCOOBY DOO THE MYSTERY BEGINS\n\nThe story of how the Mystery Inc gang all first met and solved thier first Mystery together. After being put in detention the four teens and Scooby find themselves framed for some ghostly trouble making goes on. To clear thier names the Gang work tgoether to solve the mystery of the spooky goings on at thier high school.\n\nAn enjoyable take on how the Mystery Inc Gang all first met as this was one story ever Scooby Fan has wondered about. The roles are cast perfectly and whilst there are real ghost floating around, it stays true to the Scooby formula with a Creepy Masked Spectre floating around but what is he up to? A fun little film with some Spooky Scooby action\n\n6: SCOOBY DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND\n\nAfter taking a break from Mystery Solving to pursue thier own interests the gang reunite as Daphne wants to find a fully real haunted house. Thier search takes them to the mysterious Moonscar Island and Daphne soon gets more than she bargained for when the gang discover the island is rmapant with Real Zombies and Cat creatures. There’s no unmaking this time .\n\nThis is proabaly the darkest Scooby Doo has even gotten what with the sinister atmosphere of moonscar island the striking frightening detail of the animated zombies. Breathing new life into the Scooby Franchise this offering makes any Zombie Movie look tame compared the scares this one has. Some briallant new songs were written for this such as “The Ghost is here” and a fantastic chilling new song “It’s Terror Time Again” signalling Scooby Doo’s triumphant return to popularity.\n\n7: SCOOBY DOO AND THE CYBER CHASE\n\nScooby and the Gang visit thier friend Eric at his university campus only to find out he is facing some spooky cyber trouble in the forsm of a Phantom Computer Virus in the computer game he has created based on the gang’s adventures. As they try to solve the mystery the Gang are zapped into the game and must play through every level if they wish to stop the virus and return to the real world.\n\nWhilst this one moves away from the traditonal scooby doo ghost formula, it is an enjoyable watch. The biggest highlight is when the gang cross paths with thier video game counterparts and work together to stop the virus resulting a hilarious chase sequence in an amusement park.\n\n8: SCOOBY DOO CAMP SCARE\n\nWhen the Gang arrive at Camp Little Moose to be Summer Councilors they find the camp being haunted by the campire legend the Woodsman come to life. As the gang investigate further they come face to face with other campfire legends such as the Fishman and the Screaming Spectre of Shadow Canyon.\n\nWhilst some of the recent Scooby Doo animated movies have been ok this one I thoroughly enjoyed with it’s Friday the 13th like Vibes and the spooky characters haunting the camp. The writing is good and the story holds perfectly as some of the recent movies have had lacklustre badly written stories so it’s good to see one with a great plot.\n\nHONOURABLE MENTIONS\n\nScooby Doo and the Monster of Mexcio\n\nAloha Scooby Doo\n\nScooby Abracadabra Doo\n\nScooby Doo and the Curse of the Lake Monster\n\nScooby Doo Stage Fright\n\nWell there it is My Favourite Scooby Doo Movies, stay tuned for further Scooby posts on my Favourite episodes from various Scooby Series.\n\nThis year marks the 50th Anniversary of Super Sleuth Scooby Doo, hard to believe the Mystery Cracking Canine is 50 but after all legends stay young. Scooby Doo was my all time favourite Cartoon as a kid and still is today. As a 90’s Kid I have so many fond memories of Saturday Morning Cartoons and was always so excited whenever I heard the “Scooby Doo Where Are You” theme and what creepy caper the gang would be on this time. As a Kid I could have sat and watched Scooby Doo all day. I have seen all the episodes and could watch them a million times again.\n\nRecently I pulled my DVD copy of Scooby Doo Where Are You of the Hanna Barbera Golden Collection and through the nostalgic experience of re watching I still love this show as much as I did when I was kid. The Scooby Gang or Those Meddling Kids as they are better known are a an awesome bunch of characters, Dynamic Leader Fred, Brainy Smart Velma, Beautiful Resourceful Daphne and Cowardly but 100% Loveable Shaggy and Great Dane Detective Scooby are undoubtedly animations most Greatest Creations\n\nInterestingly but not suprising it was Scooby Doo that cataputled the Hanna Barbera studio to stardom in 1969. Hanna Barbera were already know for iconic creations such as The Flinstones, Wacky Races and Hong Kong Phoey but it was Scooby Doo that became thier crowning glory. Upon it’s television debut “Scooby Doo Where Are You” was an absolute Hit which is no surprise. The concept of the show of teens along side a comedic sidekick on a wacky adventure lead the studio to create several clones of the Scooby Doo formula but nothing matched the charm and style of the original. After all you cannot copy something that is already perfect.\n\nScooby Doo’s popularity is still evident today 50 Years later, thanks to 4 Live Action Movies, numerous direct to DVD animated movies and various incarnations of the series. The incarnations today however lack the qualities that made Scooby Doo such a brilliant show. Persoanally I prefer the classic series with all it’s charm, comedy and endless amount of creepy capers and the nostalgia one gets when rewatching it. Like remember when Scooby and the Gang uncovered spooky goings on on Haunted Island or that time Scooby and Shaggy tried to trick the Wolfman by pretending to be hairdressers and giving him a much needed trim. That kind of nostaglia is what makes a Classic Show stand out and retain it’s status as iconic show.\n\nHow else also could you forget some of the spooky locations the Mystery Inc Gang’s exploits have taken them too. From old spooky houses, creepy castles, uncanny musuems and of course eerie old cemeteries. Those locations have made for some great episodes. Makes me wish I could live in a spooky old house. Of course the show wouldnt be the same without the Gang’s trust set of wheels The Mystery Machine, if I could have one fictional vehicle IT WOULD BE THIS ONE!!!. Whether the gang are fleeing the creeps or Shaggy and Scooby are cooking up a tasty snack, the Mystery Machine is always on hand. With a cool paintjob like that who wouldnt want to drive around in this.\n\nEach incarnation of Scooby Doo has it’s own theme but undoubtedly the most famous and iconic is “Scooby Doo Where Are You”. They just dont make theme tunes like this anymore. I remember as a kid getting so excited where I heard that theme cause it was just so creepy and catchy. I remember going up to my minders house for the day and she had SKY and Cartoon Network had on a whole marathon of Scooby Doo episodes. I was in heaven for the day\n\nThere will be further Scooby Related Posts on my favourite Episodes and Movies as this one would be too long to name them all here. Yes 50 Years later Scooby Doo is still an icon alongside his mystery solving chums. The friendship between him and Shaggy is squad goals all the way whether they are running from the spooks or tucking into a snack. Maybe this Halloween if I get to any parties I shall dress up as Shaggy. The other characters too are loveable and iconic. Fred is always on hand with a plan to outsmart and trap the Villain and as leader of the gang always knows what to do. Velma as the smart one in the gang never fails to deduce the clues and solve the mystery. Daphne too is always on hand to help solve the mystery and stumble into a spooky situation. My favourite character has to Shaggy cause like him I always love a Snack or “Two”.\n\nSo Happy 50th Anniversary Scooby Doo and here’s to another 50 years of Scooby Sleuthing ."
