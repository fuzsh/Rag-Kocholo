        "text": "From time to time, to the delight of some readers — and the annoyance of others — “06880” waxes rapturously about long-gone relics from Westport’s past.\n\nThe Remarkable Book Shop. Allen’s Clam House. Famous Artists School.\n\nIf you’ve read this blog for more than a week — even if you moved here this winter — you probably know those names.\n\nNow it’s time to turn the tables.\n\nAlert (and creative) “06880” reader Erik Marcus suggests looking ahead and back, simultaneously. How about crowdsourcing current Westport stores, restaurants and institutions that — 30, 40 or 50 years from now — would deserve as much respect, if they are no longer around?\n\nTo make it interesting — and because we’ve given plenty of props already to places like Westport Pizzeria and Oscar’s — let’s limit it to relative newcomers. In other words, you can only mention something that did not exist here before 2000.\n\nHit “Comments” to add your favorite future nostalgia-inducers. Add a few details. And please, use your full, real name.\n\nThe opening of Bartaco has opened up the west bank of the Saugatuck River. A couple of nearby restaurants are coming soon; across the Post Road, Arezzo is drawing big crowds (despite limited parking).\n\nNow there’s more good news.\n\nAs reported first on WestportNow.com, David Waldman has signed a contract to buy the Save the Children property next to Bartaco, on Wilton Road.\n\nThat’s 2.59 acres of prime riverfront property. Though Save the Children is an internationally known, very important non-profit, it doesn’t need that great location to do its good deeds. For a while now, the headquarters — previously Famous Artists Schools — has looked a bit dumpy.\n\nWaldman will fix that.\n\nThough sometimes controversial, his recent track record is impressive. He turned a dilapidated but historic Federal-style home into the wildly popular Spotted Horse restaurant, and breathed new life into what is now Urban Outfitters.\n\nNow he’s remaking the other side of Church Lane. Bedford Square will bring a mix of retail, residential and office space to this vital but previously underutilized area of downtown.\n\nIt’s a project with plenty of moving parts. Throughout the long approval process, Waldman has listened to concerns — of taxpayers and town officials — and adapted well. He’s shown an interest in preservation, while understanding the needs of a suburban town re-imagining its entire downtown.\n\nBedford Square has had hiccups. But Waldman has shown a willingness to adapt, and a flexibility sometimes missing in past developments — his, and others.\n\nI believe Waldman will show similar creativity and concern for his new Save the Children property. This is an enormous opportunity to remake a very cool, very important — and very overlooked — part of Westport.\n\nI have no idea what Waldman will propose. I don’t know whether he bought the building and land because he already has a plan, or if he just realized the location, location, location was superb.\n\nBut I have faith he’ll turn it into something Westport can be proud of, and use to full advantage.\n\nWaldman is a Westporter. His heart is here. That’s good news indeed for the future of our entire downtown.\n\nDo you have a vision for the future use of Save the Children? Click “Comments” — and remember, full names please!\n\nSave the Children‘s possible move out of its Wilton Road headquarters has generated plenty of headlines.\n\nAnd you’d have to be living, brain dead, under a very large rock to not know that the Westport Y‘s move 2 miles up that same Wilton Road has caused considerable agita in town.\n\nWhy, then, has the proposed relocation of Westport’s largest employer — and biggest taxpayer — been met with a thunderous round of “meh”?\n\nBridgewater Associates employs 1,200 people. It pays $500,000 a year in taxes. In 5 years, though, they hope to take all those workers — and tax dollars — down I-95 to Stamford.\n\n(Then again, maybe not. On Monday the CT Mirror posted a long story describing opposition to the 750,000-square foot headquarters — “smack in the middle of a high-risk flood zone.”\n\n(Plus, some folks are atwitter that Bridgewater will receive $115 million in state assistance to ease the move. The firm has $130 billion under management. And CEO Ray Dallio — worth $10 billion himself — is one of the world’s richest men, according to Forbes magazine.)\n\nOh, did I mention that Bridgewater Associations is not just “a” hedge fund. It is, according to CNN Money, the largest hedge fund.\n\nOn the planet.\n\nWhoa! So not only is Bridgewater Westport’s largest employer and taxpayer — it’s also the mother of all hedge funds.\n\nYet when was the last time you heard anyone say anything about them leaving?\n\nOr, in fact, the last time someone said something about the fact that they’re even here?\n\nI understand hedge funds are somewhat secretive. But think of the big corporations we’ve had in Westport.\n\nEveryone knows Save the Children. Its predecessor, Famous Artists Schools, was also world-famous. (Okay, they had to get their name out there. Their customers were people paying a few dollars to learn to draw and write, not fabulously wealthy customers hoping to become even fabulously wealthier.)\n\nBut when Marketing Corporation of America — the world’s largest marketing firm, at the time — was headquartered on Riverside Avenue, everyone in town sure knew they were here.\n\nWe knew Tauck Tours was here too. They’re the company that invented the group travel industry, then modernized it with high-end, worldwide itineraries.\n\nSame with Stauffer Chemical, which made (hey, someone had to) herbicides for corn and rice.\n\nAnd before that, Embalmers’ Supply Company — yes, the largest in the world — called Westport home.\n\nAll of those businesses — big, robust, important — were integral parts of Westport. As corporations, they were good neighbors. As human beings, the men and women who worked there were our neighbors.\n\nBut Bridgewater has been virtually invisible. Scattered in 5 locations — the 2 biggest sites are the old Glendinning building on Weston Road (very convenient to scooting on and off the Merritt Parkway) and Nyala Farm (ditto for 95) — it was easy for the hard-working, high-rolling hedge fund men and women to have little to do with Westport life.\n\nWhen Bridgewater leaves Westport, 5 or so years from now, we’ll miss their tax dollars.\n\nBut I don’t know that we’ll miss them. Because, really, were they ever really here?\n\nSeymour Schachter’s parents were from the old country. They told him he’d never make a living doing art.\n\nSeymour loved to draw and paint. At 8 he won a national art contest — for adults. Yet when it was time for college, in 1978, and his parents said he could go to art school only if he paid for it himself, he ended up at Boston University’s school of business.\n\nBut he showed his artwork to the dean, who made a deal with his art school counterpart. They waived all business electives, so Seymour could take art courses.\n\nAfter graduation he landed a high-paying job selling eyeglass frames around the world. It was a dream job — “for anyone else,” he says. Driving to an important meeting in France, all he wanted to do was paint the countryside.\n\nHe quit cold turkey — and got a job in a Hackensack mall art supply store. But he was so successful — doubling sales in 1 month — that he caught the eye of the chain store’s president.\n\nThrough a series of similarly fortuitous meetings, legendary creative director Hazel Spector asked him for a storyboard. He had no idea what a storyboard was — but he stayed up all night, and created a great one.\n\nThat led to more offers. One company requested 25 panels; they’d pay $40. Hey, it’s money, Seymour figured. He tried not to act surprised when he received $1,000 — $40 for each panel.\n\nContinuity hired him as head artist. His 11 years there “were better than any art school,” he says. His work was critiqued by the best in the business.\n\nSeymour’s ability to switch styles — from cartoons to superheroes to photo realism — proved invaluable. In 1995 he formed his own company, and never looked back. He crafted a career as an illustrator for Fortune 500 companies. He’s drawn national ads, and designed some of the most popular product labels in the world.\n\nSubway, Pepsi, Fruity Pebbles, Tropicana, Arm & Hammer, Sierra Mist, Ragu, Skippy, Newman’s Own, Goldfish — all are Seymour Schachter clients, and Seymour’s artistic creations.\n\nSo was Joe Camel.\n\nIn 1984 — just 24 years old — his team drew the already-infamous cartoon character on cigarette tins and matchbox covers.\n\nBut Seymour felt conflicted. He called the American Cancer Society, and offering his services at a lower-than-usual rate. They asked him to draw posters.\n\n“It was my way of balancing my conscience,” he says.\n\nWhen his father died of a brain tumor, Seymour gave up doing cigarette ads altogether.\n\nEighteen years ago, Seymour and his wife Jamie began house-hunting. She worked in Milford, so they searched for someplace between there and New York City. Several friends suggested the “beautiful little artists’ community” of Westport.\n\nThey knew nothing about it. But they fell in love with the “nice beach, nice people and nice houses,” and bought a place off Cross Highway.\n\nTo his surprise, Seymour learned that the area teemed with promotional advertising companies like MCA, Ryan Partnership and Catapult — huge firms with national accounts.\n\n“We stumbled into an artists’ colony,” he says. He’s been busy ever since.\n\nSeymour Schachter is a successor to earlier generations of Westport illustrators — men like Harold von Schmidt, Steven Dohanos, Hardie Gramatky, Bernie Fuchs and Howard Munce. For a century — starting in 1902 — they drew ads, book and magazine covers, product cans and boxes, putting this town on the international art map.\n\nThey even spawned a noted correspondence course, Famous Artists School, located where Save the Children is now.\n\nIn the last 20 years, computers and the internet have taken work away from illustrators. The world is changing in many ways, and commercial art has not been spared.\n\nBut, Seymour says, “for the few of us who can draw Flintstone characters standing around a Christmas tree, there’s still a lot of work. And this part of Connecticut is still the place to get work.\n\n“I hope to remain an illustrator as long as I live.”\n\nIn 1936, Vivien Testa began teaching art at Bedford Junior High School (now King’s Highway Elementary).\n\nShe moved to Staples (now Saugatuck Elementary) in 1948.\n\nTen years after that, she was part of the new high school campus on North Avenue. (In fact — having minored in architecture — she helped design the place. She has an enormous slide collection from that time, which she will donate to the Westport Library.)\n\nVivien Testa chaired the art department through the 1970s.\n\nToday she celebrates her 99th birthday.\n\nShe is as sharp as when she ruled the 4 Building.\n\n“I do a lot of reading,” she says. “People come to visit. Other than that, I sit in my chair.”\n\nDoes she have a birthday message for her many fans and former students?\n\n“Tell them I enjoyed them all,” she says. “And they’re welcome to visit any time.”\n\n—————————————————–\n\nSeveral years ago, while writing my book Staples High School: 120 Years of A+ Education, I found an interview Vivien Testa had recorded for the Westport Historical Society oral history project. Here is an excerpt:\n\nMy family spent summers in Westport, so I knew the town in 1936 when I came to teach art at Bedford Junior High School. It was the Depression, and my father said I was taking a job away from a man who needed one.\n\nIn 1936 the school had a place in the life of the community. Teachers knew what they were expected to do and not do. For example, teachers were not supposed to smoke. But the faculty played basketball against the youngsters, and put on plays for them. There was a feeling we were all growing and learning together.\n\nWhen Mrs. Holden, the arts supervisor, left in 1948, I took over. We had a lovely art room in the building on Riverside Avenue. It was good size, and well lit. There were 15 to 20 students in a class, and I taught 4 or 5 classes a day. Westport was growing as an arts colony.\n\nI still carried nearly a full teaching load, but I was given one or two afternoons a week to supervise. There were three townwide directors in art, music and physical education. Those were considered special subjects, and the principals were not trained in them. But the Board of Education members and superintendent really knew teachers. They came into the classroom all the time.\n\nPop Amundsen was the custodian, and his wife ran the cafeteria. They set the tone for Staples. If they saw youngsters doing anything out of line, they let them know. Students respected them just as much as the principal.\n\nEverything was in apple pie order. No one dared mark a desk. We were a small family. Education at that time was a family business. Teachers and students and parents all felt responsible for what was happening. There was no closing eyes to what was going on. Everyone respected what was happening.\n\nWe got help from a lot of places. The Westport Women’s Club had a $350 art competition, and when Famous Artists School came in they gave scholarships. Al Dorne [a founder of Famous Schools] always helped. He’d produce booklets for new teachers or students. He underwrote hundreds of dollars.\n\nI was involved in the plans for the North Avenue building. I worked with the architects, Sherwood, Mills and Smith. I minored in architecture, so I was able to lay out my ideas about what I wanted to have. It worked nicely for me, except when they cut this, that and the other thing, and we ended up with just a mishmash. That was kind of too bad. But it was still better than you would find in many places.\n\nThere were many bugs in the building that had to be taken care of. A 3rd art room was cut out of the original plan, and a wing in the auditorium was cut. We had to put all the crafts stuff – kilns, etc. – in 2 rooms designed for 2-D stuff. Then when they added Building 9 a few years later, they added a 3-D room, and extended the stage.\n\nBefore they did that, a ballet company came to use the stage. The stage had only been planned for lectures and assemblies, not theater – there was no room for stage sets. As you face the stage, there was a brick wall on the right, and a passageway and electric panel on the left. A handsome male dancer ran right into the brick wall. Performers had to dress in the art rooms, too. It was quite a mess.\n\nThere was one boys’ and one girls’ bathroom – none for the faculty. I learned a great deal about youth by using that bathroom. But we always took an interest in keeping our building beautiful, because art is beauty.\n\nLong-time residents, artists of all ages and realtors — even those who got their licenses yesterday afternoon — are fond of referring to Westport’s reputation as an “artists’ colony.”\n\nBut what does that mean? What actually happened in an “artists’ colony”?\n\nFor one thing, illustrators shared stories, ideas — and drinks — on the train home from New York, where they worked day jobs in advertising, PR, publishing and magazines.\n\nFor another, there were some wild parties, involving artists, artists’ hangers-on, alcohol, swimming pools and whatnot. I’ve heard plenty of stories, from plenty of sources.\n\nBut living in an artists’ colony was serious work too. There were regular “sketch classes” — not classes, really, but gatherings of artists and artist-wannabes, who gathered to draw or paint from live models.\n\nThese gatherings took place in studios, basements, or anywhere else large enough for a model stand, easels and chairs, lights, and random props.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of drawing, the models took breaks. That’s when the artists walked around, critiqued each other’s work, and schmoozed.\n\nRemington Schuyler — a Boy’s Life magazine illustrator – held a sketch class in his Westport home.\n\nIn 1932, weekly sketch classes met at Edward C. Nash’s home (now Nash’s Corner). Among the regular attendees: John Steuart Curry, Robert Lambdin and Rose O’Neill. (She created the Kewpie doll.)\n\nBob Baxter and Ann Toulmin-Rothe held a sketch class in the mill building on Richmondville Avenue.\n\nRobert Fawcett — one of the 10 Famous Artists’ founding members — ran classes in the company building on Wilton Road (now Save the Children).\n\nBut sketch classes have not gone the way of Famous Artists School. (I know, it still exists — but it’s a shell of its former self, and long gone from Westport.)\n\nHoward Munce — the 95-year-old, sharp-as-an-illustrator’s-pen living legend of Westport’s artists’ colony days — still attends a sketch class at Elizabeth Gaynor’s house in Southport. It’s a cross-section of old Westport artists, others from the area, and younger folks with whom the veterans happily share their knowledge and humor.\n\nNow, the Westport Historical Society honors all that with “The Sketch Class: A Westport Tradition.” The exhibit chronicles the history and significance of Westport’s sketch classes , and features a great group of artists of all ages.\n\nIt opens on Sunday (Jan. 30), and runs through April 30. It kicks off with a free, open reception this Sunday, 3-5 p.m.\n\nThe exhibit is curated by Howard Munce himself. So in addition to learning about sketch classes, if you go to Sunday’s reception you’ll learn all about Westport’s “artists’ colony” past — from a man who was there then, and still creates art today.\n\n(For more information on the Westport Historical Society’s “Sketch Class” exhibit, click here or call 203-222-1424.)\n\nRecently, in my other life as a “Woog’s World” columnist, I made a snarky reference to Famous Artists School.\n\nSpecifically, I called it — and its kinfolk, the Famous Writers and Famous Photographers School — “a Westport institution that crashed nearly as rapidly as it grew.”\n\nA few days later I got an email from a Magdalen Livesey. Though her name sounds like the creation of one of the only people ever to flunk a Famous Writers course, I opened it.\n\nMagdalen Livesey wrote: “Although your article didn’t say it in so many words…it left the impression that Famous Schools has been moribund for quite some time.”\n\nShe was happy to inform me that “Famous Schools” are alive and well.\n\nThey were acquired by Cortina Learning International in 1981, she said. In 1990 the offices moved from Riverside Avenue to Newtown Turnpike, and in 1995 to Wilton. That’s the current location, with a warehouse and shipping facility in Danbury.\n\nFamous Artists School currently has students in “many different countries around the world, as well as in the States,” Magdalen continued. Since 1967 they’ve had “a very active licensee” in Japan — Kodansha Famous Schools — with 15,000 students.\n\nThe present Famous Artists Courses include “the classic textbooks,” along with complete-at-home assignments that are sent in for “critiquing and evaluation by artist-instructors who work in their own studios.” Coming soon: a revised, updated downloadable version.\n\nIn 1993, Magdalen said, a 45th anniversary exhibition was held at the Westport Arts Center. Stevan Dohanos — the last surviving member of the original 12 apostles founding “Famous Artists” — was still active then.\n\n“We actually had quite widespread publicity for that event,” Magdalen added, “including a featured article in the Westport News. Perhaps you are too young to have been aware of it.\n\nPerhaps not. A more likely answer: Who remembers 1993?\n\nBut Famous Schools is not resting on its 45th-anniversary-17-years-ago laurels. Their next project: rejuvenating Famous Writers School, “which is still active but on a more limited basis.”\n\nMagdalen’s email came at an appropriate time. It’s Easter Week. Her name conjures up Mary Magdalene.\n\nAnd her tale about Famous Schools is an important reminder that — when you least expect it — someone, or something, can rise from the dead."
