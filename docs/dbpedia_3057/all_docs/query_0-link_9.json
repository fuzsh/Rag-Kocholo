        "text": "The Mad Doctor is a cartoon likely written by Walt Disney, and directed by Dave Hand. It features Mickey Mouse, Pluto, the Skeletons, and (in his debut) the Mad Doctor.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn the middle of a stormy night, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto is abducted by a strange hooded man. Following the figure to get his beloved companion back, Mickey finds himself in a haunted castle, even as the dognapper reveals himself to be an unhinged vivisectionist known simply as the Mad Doctor.\n\nContinuity[]\n\nThe Mad Doctor's lair seems to have inspired Blaggard Mansion seen in Blaggard Castle (1932-1933), which began its original serialized printing before The Mad Doctor was released. Dr. XXX also seems to have inspired the villains of the comic, whose names are Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex, with the name \"Triplex\" in particular clearly alluding to the Mad Doctor, whose name consists of three x's.[1]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThis cartoon short was released in 1933 in black and white, and later colorized. Due to an oversight on Disney's part, it fell into the public domain, one of the only Mickey Mouse cartoons ever to do so.\n\nAlthough the cartoon seems to imply the whole adventure was just a dream, further appearances by the Mad Doctor imply that it is in fact not so."
