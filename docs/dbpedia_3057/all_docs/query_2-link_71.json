        "text": "Dear Reader,\n\nWelcome to part 2 of my analysis of Scooby-Doo! Well, between Where Are You? (see part 1) and Mystery Incorporated lies nine more incarnations over the course of forty more years and that, reader, is today’s food for thought.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, the second incarnation – The New Scooby-Doo Movies (1972-3) – premiered a year later, on CBS and under the same production teams, although Ruby-Spears had temporarily left to join a rival animation company (DePatie-Freleng: Pink Panther Show and Dr. Seuss specials).\n\nInstead of a half-hour mystery, each episode was an hour-long, and incorporates the still-present gimmick of the celebrity guest star. For twenty-four episodes, veteran comedy teams like the Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy, musicians like Davy Jones, Cass Elliot, and Sonny and Cher, superheroes like Batman and Robin, other fictional TV characters like Josie and the Pussycats, Jeannie, and the Addams Family as well as other celebrities like the Harlem Globetrotters, cameoed during the gang’s mysteries (Burke & Burke 108).\n\nThe third incarnation would not appear until three-years later at ABC, where Silverman had since moved (bringing Spears and Ruby back with him), with The Scooby-Doo Show (1976-8), Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979-80), Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (shorts; 1980-2), The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show (1983-4), The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo (1985), and A Pup Named Scooby-Doo (1988-91). Over the course of fifteen years, the franchise would retain the same foundation as well as the feature guest stars and collaborations (such as with Dynomutt and Scooby-Doo’s quirky “relatives”), however due to declining ratings, would reduce the focus on the gang as a whole, and shift towards Scooby and Shaggy, along with the newly invented Scrappy-Doo (Scooby’s puppy nephew).\n\nBy the early-1980s, Silverman, Ruby and Spear were no longer supervising the show, hence the creation of the widely-criticized Scrappy-Doo (108). During the mid-1980s, the show-runs successively shortened, and gradually the absentee gang members re-emerged (especially in 13 Ghosts), culminating in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. This newest adaptation was one of many in the “babyfication” trend in animated content (Goodman), where previously teen animated characters were reduced to toddler or elementary school level (Hanna-Barbera, alone: The Flintstone Kids, Tom & Jerry Kids, Yo Yogi!).\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby-Doo began to diversify with animated and live-action films, starting in 1979 and continuing today (27 direct-to-video animated films, 2 live-action TV films, and 2 live-action feature films). Importantly, in the late-1980s to 1990s, Scooby-Doo animated content shifted darker, producing films that featured actual magical and supernatural mysteries and villains (rather than typical man-in-mask capers), such as Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987), Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School (1988), Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988), Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights (1994), Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998), and Scooby-Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost (1999).\n\nScooby Doo’s ninth incarnation (and the first not produced by Hanna-Barbera) is What’s New, Scooby-Doo? (2002-6) which aired Saturday mornings on Kid’s WB, the children’s programming block of Warner Bros. television. Retaining the formulaic episode format, the revival also returned to the man-in-mask routine that preceded the 1980s, ditched the laugh-track, upgraded the theme with a rendition from pop-punk band Simple Plan, and possessed a level of self-awareness for its camp ancestry. Following was a spin-off, Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! (2006-8), which aired on Kid’s WB, but on the WB’s new television subsidiary, The CW. Combining the crooks with actual magical elements, the tenth incarnation returns to a Shaggy and Scooby focused show (the rest of the gang being mostly absent), and revises the premise: Shaggy becomes the sole heir of a fortune and must stop evil genius Dr. Phineas Phibes.\n\nTherefore, 1) the show leans more towards the supernatural and magical, and 2) attempts a more connected continuity. Finally, the franchise returned in 2010 for the eleventh and longest-running incarnation, Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incorporated (2010-3). Check back in this coming week for a post one of (if not) my favorite television show of all time. I know, I don’t get out much.\n\nDear Reader:\n\nWelcome to my first post on the classic television saga known as Scooby-Doo! This piece will be broken into three segments, two posted this week on the original show, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, as well as its evolution through ten more programs. Next week, I will then be discussing by far the franchise’s best incarnation – Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incorporated. [Part 2, Part 3]\n\nFirst, a little personal reflection: I watched the original show a lot throughout my childhood, and what most people aren’t aware of is that all the fragments submerged in their memory – the laugh track, the mystery machine, the Creeper, Velma looking for her glasses – are all bound up in only the twenty-five episodes comprising Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? But if you’re like me, you may also recall A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, the Simple Plan cover of the theme in What’s New Scooby Doo, and the theatrical films starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But trust me when I say, THERE IS SO MUCH MORE! Please enjoy.\n\nForty-seven years, three networks, and twelve shows – the legacy of the Scooby-Doo franchise has prevailed across decades, sociocultural revolutions, gradual shifts, and reversals, and innumerable changes in network, production, and creative control, and yet, it remains in historical, entertainment, and academic study, only an unexplored, undocumented, and briefly mentioned footnote. Hence, the major challenge in such a study is the search for scattered materials, sources, and timelines when no such comprehensive study has emerged, in order to reflect on the franchise’s evolution and impact.\n\nBy examining the original television run of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! (1969-1970), which aired on CBS for only 25 episodes, in contrast with the eleventh and longest-running incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera show, Cartoon Network’s Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated (2010-2013), trends emerge in the storylines, content, themes, and characterizations which reflect the shift in the design of children’s animated content, the social attitudes towards violence and sexuality, and a unique reliance on meta-humor and intertextuality.\n\nScooby-Doo’s first incarnation originally aired at 10 a.m. on CBS’s Saturday morning lineup, side-by-side with syndicated re-runs of The Jetsons (1962-3, ABC), Hanna-Barbera’s Dastardly and Muttley (1969-70), and The Archie Show (1968-9) (Castleman).\n\nDeveloped by CBS Programming Executive Fred Silverman, former Disney animator Iwao Takamoto, and writers Ken Ruby and Joe Spears, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? would run for only two seasons (25 episodes), before cancellation in late-1970. Silverman, who would orchestrate CBS’s “rural purge” of the early-1970s, commissioned Ruby and Spears to create a kid’s mystery show – a combination of 1940s radio shows like I Love a Mystery and Armchair Detectives, as well as the group composition and episode format of CBS’s The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis and The Archie Show (Cronin; “Scooby-Doo – The History of a Classic”). The premise would follow a group of teens with a talking-dog mascot (such as Astro in The Jetsons, Muttley in Dastardly and Muttley, and Hot Dog in The Archies) who stumble upon and solve mysteries, with their different “personalities” and youthful energy, in under thirty minutes.\n\nThe show as conceived was an attempt by Silverman and CBS to “steer [the] network’s children’s programming away from the often-condemned violence of action and superhero shows [Adventures of Superman, Green Hornet] and toward humor” (“Scooby-Doo”). At the time, concerns came from parental watch groups, network executives, and the FCC’s Newton Minow, who had deemed the television landscape a “vast wasteland” in the early-1960s. However, at that point, the Saturday Morning lineup was not pervasive, with children’s content airing during the weekday and during primetime. With those scathing words, Minnow “set the terms of debate over the impact and meaning of television for decades to come. What is striking, then, is the centrality of children to Minow’s condemnation of television broadcasters” (Burke & Burke 13). While some solutions were the proliferation of educational programming, Silverman turned towards content and design revisions to create new, “safe” shows, reacting to social attitudes to race, sexuality, and violence in children’s media and the culture-at-large.\n\nOver the course of late-1968 and early-1969, the concepts were refined, going from a shaggy dog to a cowardly Great Dane named Too Much, from five kids to four kids named Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W., and evolving from a teen rock band called Mystery’s Five that solved mysteries in between gigs to eventually, just a group of sleuthing teens named Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy. Furthermore, the focus would shift from the potential teen drama of the four human members (i.e. romantic subplots, parents, school) to the friendship of “best buddies” Shaggy and Scooby, as not only the comic relief but the comic center.\n\nThe title too shifted, from Mystery’s Five to Who’s S-S-Scared?, before Silverman re-named the dog mascot Scooby Doo (based on Frank Sinatra’s scat-line from “Strangers in the Night” – “Dooby-dooby-doo”) and titled the show Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? With characters, a premise, and title, CBS had only one more issue – the artwork was deemed “too frightening for [the] 6 to 12 year-old audience” – therefore, Silverman, Ruby and Spears, and Takamoto redesigned the artwork to be more kid-friendly, saturating the horror-mystery elements in slapstick comedy (“Scooby-Doo – The History of a Classic”).\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You? is a children’s animated comedy-mystery procedural series. The show is thoroughly formulaic and static – what happens in the first episode is what happens in every episode, and what is true in the first episode remains unexplored, un-elaborated on, and unchanged throughout the series.\n\nThe program revolves around a gang of four teenagers and their talking-dog mascot, who travel in their “Mystery Machine” van and solve mysteries through elaborate plans and unmaskings. Fred Jones (Frank Welker), the blonde, brave, and competent alpha male is the leader of the gang, followed by the pretty, danger-prone redhead Daphne Blake (Stefanianna Christopherson [S1], Heather North [S2]), the butcher, brainy, and bespectacled Velma Dinkley (Nicole Jaffe), and the hippie, slacker, “chowhound” Norville “Shaggy” Rogers (Casey Kasem). However, the center character is the eponymous Scooby-Doo (Don Messick), the cowardly, stomach-driven Great Dane, who always manages to bungle the trap yet still save the day, and have the episode’s last word.\n\nThe gang would be participating in an innocuous activity, like a beach party or driving to a concert, and stumble upon some masked ghoul or ghost. Fred would call for an investigation, splitting the search parties between him and Daphne, and Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby, where they would search for clues and have a few run-ins with the “villain.” Next, Fred would conceive a Rube Goldeberg trap, if one of the gang, particularly Scooby, didn’t botch it. The “villain,” whether a vampire, werewolf, ghost, or robot, usually inhabited a spooky, haunted location like a castle on an island, a mansion in the country, or an abandoned beach or amusement park.\n\nHe (or she, although only in “Foul Play in Funland” [S1E8]) is unmasked, and their motive revealed to be the pursuit of treasure or wealth, revenge, or an attempt to cover up some larger crime (i.e. forgery, theft, counterfeiting). The deputy or sheriff would inquire how they solved such an unsolvable crime, praise them, and escort the villain away. Scooby would perform some final gag, and end the episode with a “Scooby-dooby-doo.” Other signatures include a laugh track, a visit to a malt shop, the essential early-1970s outfits replete with ascots, turtlenecks, and bell-bottom pants, and character catchphrases like Velma’s “Jinkies” or Shaggy’s “Zoinks.”\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You? lays the foundation for the next eleven incarnations, however, the original run is incredibly formulaic and static, includes segments that are racially and culturally insensitive and rely on temporally-contextual humor (which don’t age well), and possesses none of the variations that will elevate later versions of the property as well as animated content in general. The episode construction described above does not vary in the first run’s twenty-five episodes, and illustrates simultaneously TV’s camp craze during the 1960s, and Silverman’s deep appreciation for the Universal Horror films (Cronin), exemplified in the typical choice of weekly villains (mummy, Frankenstein, vampire, zombie, witch, etc.).\n\nEach episode presented a “new” villain, low stakes, no overarching plot or character arc, and no attempt at a backstory for either their one-dimensional protagonists or zero-dimensional antagonists. In the decades following, the show’s narrative superficiality and flaws in logic would become substantial, some of which are proposed by one of the few notable examinations of the show, in 1999’s Saturday Morning Fever (Burke & Burke, 105-6): How old is the gang? Do they go to school? How do they afford to travel across the country to solve crimes? Do they get paid? Where are their parents? Is this dog really talking or is Shaggy experiencing “reefer madness?” Are Fred and Daphne a couple, and what do they really do when they all split up? Is Velma a lesbian? How close are Shaggy and Scooby, and are they potheads? Why are there so many mysteries? Burning questions, all of them, but none of which are answered in the first incarnation.\n\nThe show’s entertainment value has by far aged better than its cultural references (Kewpie dolls, John Wayne, Austin Robert’s songs, and “men from mars”), and are head and shoulders above its “ethnic” villains. The brief two seasons possess three potently racist depictions of non-White cultures, whether Egyptian with the villainous, fez-wearing Dr. Najib (“Scooby-Doo and a Mummy, Too:” S1E12), or Chinese with the slant-eyed, cloaked Mr. Fong who masquerades as the ghost of warlord Zen Tuo (“Mystery Mask Mix-Up:” S2E2). However, the most egregious exemplar is only five episodes into the first season (“Decoy for a Dognapper:” S1E5) with the White Buck Masters, who, disguised as the “weirdo Indian” ghost of Geronimo as well as an “Indian Witch Doctor” promises suffering to the “paleface intruders,” and kidnaps dogs so his pet canine, “Big Red,” can win a dog show.\n\nFor the most part, Scooby is as advertised – safe, sanitized, and formulaic children’s entertainment – which is what makes Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incorporated an even more fascinating, multi-faceted, rich text."
