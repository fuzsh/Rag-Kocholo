        "text": "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE cartoon -- Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Pinocchio, the Little Mermaid. And the Disney lords saw that it was good.\n\n''How can we,'' spake the lords, ''profiteth more?''\n\nAnd there came forth from Burbank a deluge of theatrical rereleases and television spinoffs; videos, laser disks and CD-ROM's; special stores in which to house and sell books, dolls, clothing, games and toys; people dressed in costumes with large heads walking around theme parks and skating on ice; yea, even a Broadway stage musical.\n\nNow comes the live action ''101 Dalmatians,'' based on one of the most popular and profitable of Disney's animated films. The movie, starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, opens on Friday.\n\nIt is hard to turn one form into another, but Disney may be lucky. A non-Disney musical version of ''Big,'' the 1988 film that starred Tom Hanks, recently bit the dust on Broadway in an expensive way. By contrast, Disney transformed its 1991 animated megahit ''Beauty and the Beast'' into a Broadway musical that is doing extremely well. Emboldened, the company plans to turn its hit animated film ''The Lion King'' into an experimental Julie Taymor spectacle complete with masks, mimes and puppets.\n\n''Toy Story,'' the studio's first computer-animated feature, has become ''Toy Story on Ice,'' a show that for obvious reasons necessitated a compromise on one of the film's funniest sight gags: toy soldiers whose feet are immobile and permanently attached to plastic bases.\n\nTurning comic books and cartoons into live-action film is not new, but it is tricky. The ''Batman'' and ''Superman'' movies were successful, but a few years back ''Popeye,'' starring Robin Williams and directed by Robert Altman, did not work. A recent visit to Bedrock and its Stone Age dwellers in ''The Flintstones'' proved boring, and this year a new version of ''Pinocchio'' sank quickly.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
