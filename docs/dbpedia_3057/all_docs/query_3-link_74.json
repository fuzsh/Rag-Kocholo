The profusion of English, as of children’s books in general, makes judgment difficult. Livelier merchandising techniques (the spread of children’s bookshops, for example), the availability of cheap paperbacks, improved library services, serious and even distinguished reviewing—these are among the post-World War II institutional trends helping to place more books in the hands of more children. Slick transformation formulas facilitate the rebirth of books in other guises: radio, television, records, films, digests, cartoon versions. Such processes may also create new child audiences, but that these readers are undergoing a literary experience is open to doubt.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 11:09 PM ET (The Guardian)\n\nJeremy Strong obituary\n\nAmong the genres that fell in favour, the old moral tale, if not a corpse, surely became obsolescent but raised the question whether it was being replaced by a subtler form of didactic literature, preaching racial, class, and international understanding. The standard adventure story too seemed to be dying out, though excellent examples, such as The Cave (U.S. title, Five Boys in a Cave [1950]), by Richard Church, continued to appear. The boy’s school story suffered a similar fate, despite the remarkable work of William Mayne in A Swarm in May (1955). Children’s vese by Ian Serraillier, Ted Hughes, James Reeves, and the later Eleanor Farjeon, excellent though it was, did not speak with the master tones of a de la Mare or the precise simplicity of a Stevenson. In science fiction one would have expected more of a boom; yet nothing appeared comparable to Jules Verne.\n\nConversely, there was a genuine boom in fact books: biographical series, manuals of all sorts, popularized history, junior encyclopaedias. Preschool and easy-to-read beginners’ books, often magnificently produced, multiplied. So did specially prepared decoys for the reluctant reader. After the discovery of the child came that of the postchild: conscientiously composed teen-age and “young adult” novels were issued in quantity, though the quality still left something to be desired. A 19th-century phenomenon—experimentation in the juvenile field by those who normally write for grown-ups—took on a second life after World War II. Naomi Mitchison, Richard Church, P.H. Newby, Richard Graves, Eric Linklater, Norman Collins, Roy Fuller, C. Day Lewis, and Ian Fleming, with his headlong pop extravaganza Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964), come to mind.\n\nA post-World War II stress on building bridges of understanding was reflected both in an increase in translations and in the publication of books, whether fiction or nonfiction, dealing responsibly and unsentimentally with the sufferings of a war-wounded world. One example among many was Serraillier’s Silver Sword (1958), recounting the trans-European adventures that befell four Polish children after the German occupation. The Silver Sword was a specialized instance of a general trend toward the interpretation for children of a postwar world of social incoherence, race and class conflict, urban poverty, and even mental pathology. Such novels as John Rowe Townsend’s Gumble’s Yard (1961); Widdershins Crescent (1965); Pirate’s Island (1968); Eve Garnett’s Further Adventures of the Family from One End Street (1956); and Leila Berg’s Box for Benny (1958) represented a new realistic school, restrained in England, less so in the United States, but manifest in the children’s literature of much of the world. It failed to produce a masterpiece, perhaps because the form of the realistic novel must be moderately distorted to make it suitable for children.\n\nIn two fields, however, English postwar children’s literature set new records. These were the historical novel and that cloudy area comprising fantasy, freshly wrought myth, and indeed any fiction not rooted in the here and now.\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nThere was fair reason to consider Rosemary Sutcliff not only the finest writer of historical fiction for children but quite unconditionally among the best historical novelists using English. A sound scholar and beautiful stylist, she made few concessions to the presumably simple child’s mind and enlarged junior historical fiction with a long series of powerful novels about England’s remote past, especially that dim period stretching from pre-Roman times to the coming of Christianity. Among her best works are The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), The Shield Ring (1956), The Silver Branch (1957), The Lantern Bearers (1959), and especially Warrior Scarlet (1958).\n\nNot as finished in style, but bolder in the interpretation of history in terms “reflecting the changed values of the age,” was the pioneering Geoffrey Trease. He also produced excellent work in other juvenile fields. Typical of his highest energies is the exciting Hills of Varna (1948), a story of the Italian Renaissance in which Erasmus and the great printer Aldus Manutius figure prominently. Henry Treece, whose gifts were directed to depicting violent action and vigorous, barbaric characters, produced a memorable series of Viking novels of which Swords from the North (1967) is typical.\n\nThis new English school, stressing conscientious scholarship, realism, honesty, social awareness, and general disdain for mere swash and buckle, produced work that completely eclipsed the rusty tradition of Marryat and George Alfred Henty. Some of its foremost representatives were Cynthia Harnett, Serraillier, Barbara Leonie Picard, Ronald Welch (pseudonym of Ronald O. Felton), C. Walter Hodges, Hester Burton, Mary Ray, Naomi Mitchison, and K.M. Peyton, whose “Flambards” series is a kind of Edwardian historical family chronicle. Leon Garfield, though not working with historical characters, created strange picaresque tales that gave children a thrilling, often chilling insight into the 18th-century England of Smollett and Fielding.\n\nIn the realm of imagination England not only retained but enhanced its supremacy with such classics as Tom’s Midnight Garden (1958), by Ann Philippa Pearce, a haunting, perfectly constructed story in which the present and Victoria’s age blend into one. There is the equally haunting Green Knowe series, by Lucy M. Boston, the first of which, The Children of Greene Knowe, appeared when the author was 62. The impingement of a world of legend and ancient, unsleeping magic upon the real world is the basic theme of the remarkable novels of Alan Garner. Complex, melodramatic, stronger in action than in characterization, they appeal to imaginative, “literary” children. Garner’s rather nightmarish narrative The Owl Service (1967) is perhaps the most subtle.\n\nThe creation of worlds\n\nFinally there is a trio of masters, each the architect of a complete secondary world. The vast Middle Earth epic The Lord of the Rings (1954–55), by the Anglo-Saxon and Middle English language scholar J.R.R. Tolkien, was not written with children in mind. But they have made it their own. It reworks many of the motives of traditional romance and fantasy, including the Quest, but is essentially a structure, conceivably but not inevitably allegorical, of sheer invention on a staggering scale. It is also a sociocultural phenomenon, selling more than 50 million copies in some 25 languages by the late 1990s and functioning, for a certain class of American teenagers, as a semisacred cult object.\n\nTolkien’s fellow scholar, C.S. Lewis, created his own otherworld of Narnia. It is more derivative than Tolkien’s (he owes something, for example, to Nesbit), more clearly Christian-allegorical, more carefully adapted to the tastes of children. Though uneven, the seven volumes of the cycle, published through the years 1950 to 1956, are exciting, often humorous, inventive, and, in the final scenes of The Last Battle, deeply moving.\n\nThe third of these classic secondary worlds is in a sense not a creation of fantasy. The four volumes (1952–61) about the Borrowers, with their brief pendant, Poor Stainless (1971), ask the reader to accept only a single impossibility, that in a quiet country house, under the grandfather clock, live the tiny Clock family: Pod, Homily, and their daughter Arrietty. All that follows from this premise is logical, precisely pictured, and carries absolute conviction. Many critics believe that this miniature world so lovingly, so patiently fashioned by Mary Norton will last as long as those located at the bottom of the rabbit hole and through the looking glass."
