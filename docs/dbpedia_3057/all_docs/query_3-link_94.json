        "text": "Journey\n\nBy Aaron Becker,\n\nFrom my list on inspiring childlike wonder for all ages.\n\nBy Talitha Shipman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m an award-winning children's book author-illustrator. I’ve spent the last fifteen years dreaming up stories that I hope will inspire curiosity and wonder in kids of all ages. I’m also a life-long learner! I can’t get enough info about this amazing world we live in. The more I learn, the more I realize that being a noticer, someone who slows down to observe the tiny details around them, will inspire questions and the need to find some surprising and fascinating answers. When my daughter asks a question (and there are many), my mantra has become, “I don’t know, let’s find out!” I hope this list inspires your own adventurous inquiries.\n\nTalitha's book list on inspiring childlike wonder for all ages\n\nWhy did Talitha love this book?\n\nWordless picture books are sometimes a bit tricky. How do you “read” them anyways?\n\nBut Journey (and its sequels Quest and Return) allow you to dive into the gorgeous artwork and compelling story. Just soak it all in, and you’ll want to set off on your own adventure by the time you're done.\n\nBy Aaron Becker,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked Journey as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBe swept away on an elaborate flight of fancy in this Caldecott award-winning, wondrously illustrated picture book about self-determination and unexpected friendship.\n\nThe winner of the prestigious Caldecott Honor, and described by the New York Times as 'a masterwork', Aaron Becker's stunning, wordless picture book debut about self-determination and unexpected friendship follows a little girl who draws a magic door on her bedroom wall. Through it she escapes into a world where wonder, adventure and danger abound. Red marker pen in hand, she creates a boat, a balloon and a flying carpet which carry her on a spectacular journey ...…\n\nPreview\n\nWe're Going on a Bear Hunt\n\nBy Michael Rosen, Helen Oxenbury (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on finding adventure in your backyard.\n\nBy Brandon Todd Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy family and I moved to a new neighborhood a few years ago and for the first time we discovered what a community can feel like. We feel connected to a diverse group of people. We explore our park and surrounding streets, regularly supporting local shops and frequently bumping into our neighbors and other familiar faces. It’s given us a sense of place. All these books, as well as The Adventure Friends series, encourages this sense of wonder for your local community. You don’t have to go to far off lands to find adventure. Often, it’s right in your backyard!\n\nBrandon's book list on finding adventure in your backyard\n\nWhy did Brandon love this book?\n\nWhat kind of children’s book list would be complete if I didn’t include a book with a bear in it? So, I’m going with a classic.\n\nI have Flip Flop Flip Flopped through these pages of fun sounds over and over again through the years. I love this story for its simplicity and heart about a family going on a nature walk. As a father of two girls, I’m indebted to Rosen because I’ve employed his bear hunt chant on countless occasions to get my girls excited about exploring our own woods and trails. And the ending on this one is just perfect!\n\nBy Michael Rosen, Helen Oxenbury (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked We're Going on a Bear Hunt as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Zelinsky,\n\nFrom my list on going on an adventure.\n\nBy Steve Light Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an author/illustrator of 26 books for children and a full-time teacher of 3 year old’s in a nursery school. I read 1-2 books to a classroom of little critics every day. I’m also a lover of adventure although most of my adventures take place in my mind, the library or museum! As a storyteller, I love seeing the adventures books can take young readers on.\n\nSteve's book list on going on an adventure\n\nWhy did Steve love this book?\n\nAs a teacher of 3 year old’s in a nursery school, this is a classroom favorite. Most kids know the song already and here is a small adventure they have gone on – riding the bus. The illustrations are stellar with lots of little stories told only in the illustrations (the box of kittens!) If you put this out in the classroom, get two copies. Sadly the pop-ups don’t survive the love of the students! I keep one pristine in the cabinet to read to the class.\n\nBy Paul O. Zelinsky,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Wheels on the Bus as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this novelty book of a favourite children's song, the music of the song is also included at the end.\n\nPreview\n\nPezzettino\n\nBy Leo Lionni,\n\nFrom my list on going on an adventure.\n\nBy Steve Light Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an author/illustrator of 26 books for children and a full-time teacher of 3 year old’s in a nursery school.

As a storyteller, I love seeing the adventures books can take young readers on.\n\nSteve's book list on going on an adventure\n\nWhy did Steve love this book?\n\nA little piece wonders if he belongs to one of the bigger pieces. His adventure of self-discovery leads him to the island of Wham! With abstract ideas and characters like one-who- runs, strong-one, and swimming-one, children usually identify with the characters, especially Pezzettino being little. I often hear children “playing” this story during recess after I read it to my class.\n\nBy Leo Lionni,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Pezzettino as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA classic fable about the search for identity, from Caldecott Honor winning picture book creator Leo Lionni.\n\nPezzettino lives in a world in which everyone is big and does daring and wonderful things. But he is small, just a “little piece,” which is the meaning of pezzettino in Italian. “I must be a piece of somebody. I must belong to someone else,” he thinks. How Pezzettino learns that he belongs to no one but himself is the joyous and satisfying conclusion to this beautiful mosaic style picture book.\n\nPreview\n\nThree Men in a Boat\n\nBy Jerome K. Jerome,\n\nFrom my list on humorous travel that also deliver great stories.\n\nBy David Baboulene Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up, I only read humour, and it was my passion to write humour. When I was lucky enough to find myself travelling the world and working on cargo ships, the source material presented itself, and I took my chance. Publishers were wary of the crudity inherent to a sailor’s life, so I present myself as if P.G. Wodehouse himself had gone to sea. I am the butt of all the pranks, and horrified by what I see around me. So I was able to write a book that addresses the truth of a shipboard life… but leaves the suggested extremes to your imagination!\n\nDavid's book list on humorous travel that also deliver great stories\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nGrowing up, I only read humour.\n\nI just love to laugh and when a book has you making the pictures in mind for yourself and laughing out loud, there really is nothing better. And Three Men in a Boat sends me directly to the floor every time I read it, and I will never stop reading it as long as I live.\n\nIt is rightly a classic and still in the shops nearly 140 years later. My book is a homage to Three Men in a Boat. I followed the style and form, and acknowledge Jerome K Jerome in my front-matter.\n\nMy book is really 15 Men in a Boat, and if it is even 10% as good as Three, I will rightly be very proud of myself (if not my mathematics).\n\nBy Jerome K. Jerome,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Three Men in a Boat as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThree Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous account by English writer Jerome K. Jerome of a two-week boating holiday on the Thames from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back to Kingston. The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Curve of Time\n\nBy M. Wylie Blanchet,\n\nFrom my list on creative nonfiction books that entertain and teach through threaded essays and stories.\n\nBy Mark Doherty Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a highly experienced outdoorsman, musician, songwriter, and backcountry guide who chose teaching as a day job. As a writer, however, I am a promoter of creative and literary nonfiction, especially nonfiction that features a thematic thread, whether it be philosophical, conservation, historical, or even unique experiential. The thread I used for thirty years of teaching high school and honors English was the thread of Conservation, as exemplified by authors like Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Edward O. Wilson, Al Gore, Henry David Thoreau, as well as many other more contemporary authors.\n\nMark's book list on creative nonfiction books that entertain and teach through threaded essays and stories\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nAs I read M. Wylie Blanchet’s book, I myself was transported through time to one of the most magical and beautiful places in North America—the islands, bays, fjords, and estuaries of British Columbia.\n\nIn addition to being right on the water and immersed in the great forests, I was also, like her young children, at school, constantly learning new things about history, culture, ecology, philosophy, and even seamanship! The lively dialogue also made me feel like one of the family, conversing easily as we explored a land that was at that time, very sparsely populated by humanity.\n\nThroughout the book, I noticed and enjoyed a theme of a rich cultural history that portrayed both the First People cultures as well as the fiercely independent and tough early Europeans who settled in select places along the coast.\n\nBy M. Wylie Blanchet,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Curve of Time as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAfter her husband died in 1927, leaving her with five small children, everyone expected the struggles of single motherhood on a remote island to overcome M. Wylie Blanchet. Instead, this courageous woman became one of the pioneers of \"family travel,\" acting as both mother and captain of the twenty-five-foot boat that became her family's home during the long Northwest summers. Blanchet's lyrically written account reads like fantastic fiction, but her adventures are all very real. There are dangersrough water, bad weather, wild animalsbut there are also the quiet respect and deep peace of a woman teaching her children the wonder…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Long Way\n\nBy Bernard Moitessier, William Rodarmor (translator),\n\nWhy did Captain love this book?\n\nI absolutely love the way that Bernard writes about the ocean. The way he describes how it feels, his relationship to the sea, his boat, time and space out there. It’s almost like a meditation. I felt so many similar feelings on my own voyage.\n\nI loved how he disregarded social norms to follow his heart and do what made him happy. He helped validate my need to live on my own terms and explore the purpose of life through my own ocean adventures.\n\nBy Bernard Moitessier, William Rodarmor (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Long Way as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Long Way is Bernard Moitessier's own incredible story of his participation in the first Golden Globe Race, a solo, non-stop circumnavigation rounding the three great Capes of Good Hope, Leeuwin, and the Horn. For seven months, the veteran seafarer battled storms, doldrums, gear-failures, knock-downs, as well as overwhelming fatigue and loneliness. Then, nearing the finish, Moitessier pulled out of the race and sailed on for another three months before ending his 37,455-mile journey in Tahiti. Not once had he touched land.\n\nPreview\n\nLittle Toot\n\nBy Hardie Grammatky,\n\nWhy did Scott love this book?\n\nGramatky had been a Disney artist in the 1930s. Legend has it Walt had passed on his story about a little tugboat that saves the day, but after Gramatky left the studio and the book became popular, Disney then had second thoughts and adapted it into one of the shorts compromising the wartime animated feature Melody Time. The theme is familiar but potent: being small does not mean you are insignificant, a lesson of encouragement for any child. The illustrations are loose yet beautifully expressive. Gramatky wrote another book about an inanimate object – Homer the Circus Train. Although the story is not as iconic, the illustrations are equally fine. As for Disney, they carried this theme through to other shorts like Susie the Little Blue Coupe, written and boarded by Bill Peet, who wrote many books of his own. It served as one of the inspirations…\n\nBy Hardie Grammatky,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Little Toot as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

With the help and support of Hardie Gramatky's estate, to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth, we have used archived first editions and Hardie's original paintings to restore Little Toot to its full glory, bringing back a richness…\n\nPreview\n\nBoats for Papa\n\nBy Jessixa Bagley,\n\nWhy did Robin love this book?\n\nWhen I first brought Boats for Papa home, my son wanted to read it over and over. He even made his own boats and gave them to us with notes filled with hearts.\n\nBoats for Papa is a sensitive, endearing story written and illustrated by the brilliant Jessixa Bagley. Buckley lives on the water with his mother and collects driftwood to make into boats with messages to send to his deceased father. He believes if the boats don’t come back, they make it to his father.\n\nWhat I love so much about this story is the sweet relationship of a mother and son.
