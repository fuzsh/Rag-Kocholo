        "text": "#17 101 Dalmatians\n\nAlmost enough dogs\n\nWe are officially in the swinging ’60’s! This was a decade of big changes, both good and bad, for the Walt Disney company. This new decade starts with One Hundred and One Dalmatians, which was based on a book of the same name by Dodie Smith. Several changes were made from novel to movie, such as omitting both Cruella’s cat and husband, but Smith responded to the changes positively and very much liked the character drawings she received.\n\nDalmatians was animated by a fairly new, cheaper process, that utilized Xerox to transfer drawings to animation cels. This is why animation in the film has a rougher, “sketchy” look to it. After Sleeping Beauty bombed, they had to figure out ways to cut back as they were considering shutting down the animation studio. This was quite shocking to me, especially since SB is regarded as such a classic, but I guess this means we (and by we I mean I) need to cut Black Cauldron some slack on nearly shutting down the studio, because it apparently wasn’t the first one. While Walt initially gave the “ok” to use a different art style, he disliked the final outcome.\n\nDalmatians performed very well at the box office (it was the “most popular film of the year in France”!) and received high praise from critics. It seems many preferred the film to the fantasy-based movies that had been released the prior ten years, which is funny to me since those fantasy films are what people tend to think of nowadays when they think of Disney. Time‘s review of the film was that it was “the wittiest, most charming, least pretentious cartoon feature Walt Disney has ever made” which I found both funny and accurate.\n\nIn the parks, Dalmatians doesn’t have too much representation in terms of attractions/dining, though the images of the characters can be found in various ways. Cruella is also often pictured with the villains. There was a live-action remake that came out in 1996 and starred Glenn Close as Cruella, and a 2000 sequel called 102 Dalmatians. While neither the remake nor the remake sequel (remequel?) were anywhere close to favorites for me as a kid (I think I saw them both maybe once) I did have a stuffed dog from 102 Dalmatians that was my favorite toy as a little one. There have been two different animated series, 101 Dalmatians: The Series and 101 Dalmatian Street. There was also a direct-to-video sequel to the original film that came out in 2003 called 101 Dalmatians II: Patch’s London Adventure. Finally, there is a planned Cruella de Vil film, with Emma Stone currently set to star, in production. Wow, lot’s of spin-offs for this movie!\n\nIf you read my Lady and the Tramp post, you know I love dogs, so I am excited to dig into this movie! Watch along, read along, follow along!\n\nMy thoughts on 101 Dalmatians:\n\nPuppies!\n\nUgh im tired of these long opening credits\n\nHaha its cute that Pongo calls Roger his pet\n\n“Writing songs about love…something he knew nothing about” wow pongo spilling that tea\n\nI always thought it was funny how the dogs and humans look alike\n\nIt’s so cute that Pongo is so enamored by Perdita at first sight and even cuter that he gets all excited about introducing Roger to Anita, dogs are the best\n\nWhat a good wing man….wing dog?…paw dog?\n\nSo Pongo changes the mantle clock to read 5:15, and then Roger looks at his watch (which has obviously not stopped) and doesn’t think it’s weird it’s 45 minutes off??\n\nDoes he ever figure out the right time or does he go on for some time 45 minutes early for everything?\n\nYou know I haven’t seen a lot of dalmatians in my life\n\nHaha Anita’s side eye at Roger and Pongo\n\n“For some strange reason they left” a dog was barking loudly while she was trying to read\n\nBoy pongo is sure lucky this turns out well\n\nIf some guys dog was going crazy while I was trying to read in the park and then wrapped it’s leash around my legs, I would not be a happy camper\n\nNow they’ve fallen in the pond!!! This poor lady\n\nAww they’re laughing\n\nRoger and Anita get married in a church but they’re in regular clothes? And the church is empty? Why didn’t the animators give them a wedding?!\n\nDo they have no family? No friends? One of the most perplexing things I’ve seen making this blog so far\n\nPongo is lucky that Perdita was a dog in his age range AND his same breed\n\nRoger and Anita are so cute! I love how playful they are with each other and how they joke with each other. You don’t see that a lot in Disney movies, especially the early ones, everyone’s so serious all the time\n\nThey actually seem like a real couple, not a fantasy couple.\n\nPlus they’re the first couple we get to see post-wedding AND they probably knew each other longer than three days before they got engaged! This is historic!\n\nCruella DeVil…what an unfortunate name….like it fits her but could you imagine meeting someone with that name? What if she was nice? Why would you name your kid Cruella???\n\nCruella is a schoolmate of Anita’s but looks 30 years older than her\n\nBeware: that’s what happens when you’re problematic kids!\n\nWho sticks a cigarette in a cupcake?!!\n\nRoger’s funny. So many characters have been stuck up and serious in these movies it’s nice seeing people goof around\n\nMan this movie makes ya feel bad about giving puppies/kittens away\n\nIt’s so weird to me that men/dads didn’t go in the hospital room with their wives when they were giving birth back in the day\n\n15 puppies geez is that normal?\n\nNo, 5-6 are average, with the most being around 8\n\nAwww….14\n\nHow you gonna have a dead puppy in a kids movie!!\n\nYES!! Breathe little baby\n\nRoger brought the puppy back to life, a true king!\n\nHOW TF DID THIS LADY GET THERE RIGHT THEN?\n\nDoes she have a Google Alert?\n\nCruella be like\n\nThey’re really going to keep 15 puppies in the house? Forget money where will they put them?\n\nGood for them though! Sticking up for the puppies\n\nPerdita got them good drugs didn’t she\n\nPuppies!!!\n\nThey’re so cute!!\n\n“No dogs better than dad” precious babies\n\nI love that they have a hero dog\n\nSure they’re tiny and you can keep them in the living room now but what happens in a few months\n\nHaha the one keeps “swearing”\n\nThey’re little tails wagging, I can’t\n\nRolly and his constant hunger is a mood\n\nHow DO you walk all those puppies?\n\nWhat do the puppies mean that they never get to go out…how do they ~ go ~ period?\n\nJasper and Horace walked so the wet bandits could run\n\nWhy would she chase them into the house? Why wouldn’t she call the cops right away? OR yell for help??\n\nNOW she runs into the street but do..they not have a phone?\n\nDognapping is front page news?\n\nMULTIPLE PAGES?\n\nI mean i love dogs but damn\n\nHer phone is a demon? I guess if you got that name, lean into it\n\nAre Jasper and Horace the most competent villain sidekicks…?\n\nLike, they actually completed their task. They weren’t searching for a baby for 16 years….\n\nSCOTLAND YARD?! They got Scotland Yard involved?\n\nRoger is 100% correct, she fought you vehemently for the puppies and said you would pay when you didn’t give them to her…that’s #1 suspect material\n\nTHE Scotland Yard investigated her and didn’t find anything? Dang Cruella is good\n\nThe T W I L I G H T B A R K\n\nI love that the dogs all communicate with each other\n\nThis tiny hyper dog is hysterical\n\nPeg?! And that bulldog also from Lady and the Tramp?\n\nAre they on vacation in London?\n\nThe greatest crossover of all time-the Disney Dog Cinematic Universe\n\nWhere’s Bruno from Cinderella?\n\nWow they get that message far! Good for these dogs all helping out\n\nAnd goose and horse and cat\n\nWhat did Sgt. Tibbs do to get the title of Sargent?\n\nGood thing dogs live nearby Cruella’s hideout!!\n\nLoving this cat/dog solidarity\n\n99!!\n\nThere’s no way 99 puppies could fit in one room\n\nAww I feel bad for the ones that were sold\n\nWHERE DID A FULL CAKE COME FROM? And why is it on the piano of all places??\n\nWhy don’t all the dogs just gang up on H+J? They have them outnumbered greatly\n\nAre Pongo and Perdita…the most competent and useful Disney parents??!!!\n\n“Good luck Pongo” um Perdita is right there too????\n\nWow how far North did they freaking go??? What are these treacherous elements all of a sudden?\n\nI don’t think England gets that snowy? This is blizzard level…I could be wrong, though\n\nNow a trek across the rushing river, the excitement of it all!\n\nThe thrill, the danger, this is a true crime suspense thriller\n\nHell Hall…what kind of family did this woman come from?!\n\nDid they just lean into their last name real hard?\n\nDog skin coats, sickening (in the bad way)\n\nJesus, they’re talking about killing puppies\n\nTruly the worst Disney villain\n\nShe doesn’t deserve a live action backstory and I don’t want to see it\n\nOk, I retract my previous statement about J+H being competent\n\nKnew they had to screw up at some point\n\nGive me a Disney movie with super competent villains AND henchmen, PLEASE!\n\nMake the heroes WORK for their success\n\nGo Rolly!! Go!! Suck it in boy!!\n\nEw why are they fighting over who gets to kill them, I hate this\n\nI don’t even find them bumbling and funny, killing puppies is disgusting\n\nRolly!!\n\nWas it really smart to all come out at once? Like why not have the cat distract J+H and get them out of the room, and THEN the puppies escape?\n\nRolly gosh darn it!!!!\n\nWell that failed Sgt. Tibbs\n\nPongo and Perdita are outside the house, perfect timing!\n\nSgt. Tibbs isn’t competent but he’s dedicated, I love how he’s trying to protect the pups\n\nPARENTS TO THE RESCUE!\n\nThat crash through the window was epic\n\nGET EM P&P\n\nHonestly the most satisfying hero/villain fight yet\n\nSorry to Phillip v. Maleficent, but this scene is two parents fighting literally tooth and nail for their babies, I cannot help but to stan\n\nYas burn losers\n\n*wipes tears* I love a family reunion\n\n“Did you bring me anything to eat?” rolly priorities…but also same\n\n“there’s twice as many [as 15]…there’s 99 of us!” haha Patch can’t do math\n\nPatch counting up the puppies like:\n\nThey have a doggy chain mail system but no like foster care system?\n\nI guess that’s just the regular shelter system\n\nI’ve never been so happy (or actually, happy at all) to see someone get kicked by a horse\n\nThey’re so smart, walking on the ice as to not leave tracks, gosh I love P&P\n\nCruella where have you been? Not that I missed her, she just seems disproportionately passionate yet disinterested in her mission, she clearly knows that J+H are idiots yet has trusted them to be alone this long\n\nUgh these poor babies trudging through blizzard\n\nPoor Lucky is froze all over :((((\n\nUhhh……..anyone else creeped out by these dogs breastfeeding from cows?\n\nAnimals helping animals, truly what the world is about\n\nI’m getting choked up at these puppies and Pongo and Perdita finally getting some rest\n\nLike they can finally sleep easy cuz they have their kids\n\nCould you imagine driving down the road and just seeing a FLOOD OF 101 DOGS\n\nOoh Pongo with the branch dusting away the prints, genius!\n\nCrap these dogs really are the best Disney parents\n\nPongo with the soot idea – GENIUS AGAIN\n\nThat’s a LOT of soot\n\nhahaha but do they really think Jaspar and Horace aren’t going to think it’s at least weird that there are multiple large groups of labrador’s roaming about?\n\nThe intensity of this scene\n\nWill they be caught? Can they all get out?\n\nNO THE TRUCK\n\nGet them in!!\n\nWhy was Cruella so set on puppies? You need many of them to make a coat, so why not just get adult dalmatians? – I’m NOT advocating using animals to make clothing, I do not WANT her to use full grown dalmatians, I’m just questioning the logic\n\nPONGO!\n\nPhew they all got on\n\nMan, this lady is really about to kill herself and the truck driver for some coats? What good is the coat if you’re dead\n\nHA! Good for you! And stay down there\n\nDamn she back\n\nThis poor poor truck driver\n\nYikes\n\nCruella drives like I do when playing those arcade racing games\n\nAre Cruella and co….dead?\n\nOh, no, but at least they’re wrecked\n\nSurprised she’s not running after the truck, Liam Neeson style\n\nRoger got Cruella deVil on the radio lmfaooo\n\nCould you imagine hearing a song on the radio about how evil you are?\n\nHow long have the dogs been gone?? I thought it was only a couple of days, but Roger already sold the song and got it recorded\n\nDid Roger not tell them that the song is based on a real person or was the label was like “this is fine, we can’t get sued for defamation at all”\n\nLike, it’s an accurate song but…are there laws against that stuff? Maybe not in the ’60’s? IDK it’s a bop either way\n\nThey’re back!!!\n\n“And look! There’s a whole lot more!” hahaha Nanny didn’t even attempt to guesstimate and technically, she’s not wrong\n\nDid she really have to say “look!” the puppies have flooded the house\n\nDalmatian plantation that’ll be a sensation\n\nRoger and Anita are the best\n\nHonestly, the Disney couple I aspire to be like…music and dogs, what more do you need?\n\nWow I liked that a lot more than I did as a kid\n\nThis movie was a really pleasant surprise! I watched it a couple times as a kid and it was never a favorite, but I really liked it during this watch. I loved Roger and Anita and their relationship, even if we only got to see a little bit of it; I LOVED Pongo and Perdita, they were smart, they were competent, and when their kids were in danger, they went out there and they brought them home. I gotta say, I was not prepared to find the best Disney parents in this movie, but here we are. The puppies were cute, I really liked watching all the animals help bring the puppies home, and the chase/escape scenes had good tension. And Cruella hell bent on killing poor puppies? Much more scary and evil than any witch, in my opinion.\n\nNext week, we go back to fantasy with The Sword in the Stone!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
