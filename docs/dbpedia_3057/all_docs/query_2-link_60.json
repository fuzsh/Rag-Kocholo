        "text": "-Here are reviews of new and recent video releases. They are rated on a scale of up to four stars.\n\n- 102 Dalmatians** 1/2 Dognapper Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is freed to prey again on unsuspecting dogs in this live-action sequel to \"101 Dalmatians.\"\n\nThere are joys in chases and thrilling escapes, but the movie takes the dogs out of the central roles, leaving seriously weird humans and not enough puppy love. (Roger Ebert)\n\nG; 1 hour, 41 minutes\n\n- The Legend of Bagger Vance* 1/2 Sand traps and claptrap - that sums up director Robert Redford's golf-as-life drama about a mythical, mystical golf match near Savannah, Ga., in 1931. The movie looks beautiful, but Matt Damon and Will Smith, as a struggling war-hero golfer and the mysterious caddy who helps him find his swing, make for a very troubled twosome. Also with Bruce McGill. (Steven Rosen)\n\nPG-13, for sexual situations, alcohol use; 2 hours, 10 minutes\n\n- Charlie's Angels*** Just when you thought every silly TV series possible had been turned into a bad movie, somebody gets one right. \"Charlie's Angels\" is hardly one for the ages - the screenplay is awful - but Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz are fun in their roles, and the film displays enough cheeky, goofy spoofiness and decent action scenes to be enjoyable. (Steven Rosen)\n\nPG-13, for violence, sexual situations; 1 hour, 32 minutes\n\n- Rugrats in Paris*** This, the second animated film based on the TV cartoon series about self-aware toddlers, is better than the 1998 \"Rugrats\" movie - funnier, weirder, with more stuff for adults to clue into - but with a sad streak that might trouble very young children. Voices of Susan Sarandon, John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, Tim Curry, Casey Kasem, E.G. Daily, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie. (Roger Ebert)\n\nG; 1 hour, 20 minutes\n\n- Red Planet* 1/2 Film about a crew making the first manned mission to Mars contains paranoia, hopeless conversations about the nature of faith and a few shots of Benjamin Bratt's gargantuan biceps. Also with Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Tom Size more, Simon Baker, Terence Stamp. (Knight Ridder News Service)\n\nPG-13, for profanity, violence, nudity; 1 hour, 50 minutes\n\n- Girlfight*** This film has been heralded for its groundbreaking feminist twist on an old standby of a movie concept: An underclass underdog finds meaning and status as a boxer, with the help of a tough trainer working out of a musty gym. (Steven Rosen)\n\nR, for language; 2 hours, 2 minutes\n\n- Remember the Titans** 1/2 Denzel Washington as a black coach and Will Patton as his white assistant try to bind together a newly integrated Virginia high school football team. It has an inspiring message, but the predictable journey into football-movie formula makes the film more wearisome than rousing. (Steven Rosen)\n\nPG, for thematic elements and some language; 1 hour, 53 minutes\n\n- Turn It Up* 1/2\n\nRap stars Pras and Ja Rule costar in the story of a would-be rap star (Pras) whose studio sessions are paid for by his buddy's errands for a drug dealer. The film's values are seriously confused; the Pras character is presented as a hero, but he forgets his moral quibbles whenever the movie needs an action scene. (Roger Ebert)\n\nR; 1 hour, 23 minutes"
