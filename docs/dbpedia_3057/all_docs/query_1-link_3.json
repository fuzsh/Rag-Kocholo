        "text": "A beautiful black and white cyclone of lunacy and violence.\n\nThe chunky guns are in full popping glory. The fourth main character is a semi-sentient circular saw who shaves the hairs off everyone's rump.\n\nI'd kill for original Donald. Feels like he was introduced to syphon out Mickey's old insolent ways. A furious bowling pin duck, the ultimate vessel of hate.\n\nThis review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.\n\nI'd never seen this before but it is DELIGHTFUL and definitely encourages me to go through with this whole \"watch every single Donald Duck cartoon chronologically\" idea. The slapstick in this is top notch. Peg Leg Pete is in top form. The animation looks wonderful. The dry radio announcer up top is reminiscent of the famous Breckenridge from Donald Duck and the Gorilla. Donald doesn't do anything particularly specific to his character until the very last gag when he tries to taunt a captured Peg Leg Pete and hurts himself instead. I guess it is worth noting that they save the final gag for him and the short ends with him being the only one on screen. They knew they had a star early on.\n\nAll Disney Features and Shorts in Release Order - a challenge?\n\nFilm #193\n\nThe 70th Mickey Mouse short feels very much the throwback, even at this early stage. Fifi is kidnapped by Pete in lieu of Minnie, resulting in a chase and gunplay. While Mickey and Donald had appeared together before (in Orphan's Benefit), this is the first time they had partnered up in any way. Here the two act as cops on the tail of Pete. Fun stuff, with the buzzsaw chase being a particular standout. Of note: this is the only time Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash voiced Mickey, as Walt was away in Europe at the time of production.\n\nVault It?\n\n(Or Why it's unlikely to be on Disney+ unscathed)\n\nMickey, Donald, and Pete are all toting guns in this one. Par for the course due to the popularity of the cops and robbers genre during the 30s.\n\nAlready after the introduction of Donald in Orphan's Benefit, The Dognapper sets him up as co-lead alongside Mickey. If Orphan's Benefit knew exactly how to handle Donald, The Dognapper squanders him, making him little more than a sidekick who undergoes the exact same experience as Mickey with the exact same reactions. His inclusion basically lets us see the same joke twice, but with a different character.\n\nIf the majority of 1933 was about Disney pushing themselves with their shorts, 1934 has been reutilizing ideas from the past. This is a pretty standard Mickey vs. Pete scenario and it's not a particularly interesting one either, unless you want to see just how irrelevant bullets are in the Disney world."
