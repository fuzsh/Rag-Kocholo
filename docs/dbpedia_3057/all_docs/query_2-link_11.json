        "text": "The Dognapper Review\n\nThe Dognapper is a 1934 Mickey Mouse cartoon. It is a fun entry.\n\nDonald Duck and Mickey Mouse fight Pegleg Pete together in this cartoon and it’s naturally a lot of fun. Seeing the two organized to fight him together was great and the first ever cartoon with such an arrangement and thus rather important. I loved a couple of scenes here with the ending being very good and the animation is pretty good here.\n\nI found the character design of Donald again troublesome as he really did look ugly in this first design and I can’t wait to see his final, best design. Mickey is very good here and I liked Fifi’s role quite a bit. Pete is also excellent. However, the film is never as funny as it should have been and I wanted more memorable sequences here as the film isn’t as classic as the premise demanded.\n\nThe Dognapper is good with fine character moments for all three characters, but it needed to be more iconic and funnier."
