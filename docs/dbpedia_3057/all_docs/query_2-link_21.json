It was directed by Cal Brunker, who co-wrote the screenplay with Billy Frolick and Bob Barlen from a story by Frolick. Several cast members from the main series reprised their roles, including Kingsley Marshall (voicing Marshall), Keegan Hedley (voicing Rubble), Shayle Simons (voicing Zuma), Lilly Bartlam (voicing Skye), and Ron Pardo (voicing both Cap'n Turbot and Mayor Humdinger). They are joined by Iain Armitage (voicing Chase), Marsai Martin, Yara Shahidi, Kim Kardashian, Randall Park, Dax Shepard, Jimmy Kimmel, Tyler Perry, and introducing Will Brisbin in his film debut as Ryder. In the film, Ryder and the PAW Patrol pups are called to Adventure City in order to stop the recently-elected Mayor Humdinger from wreaking havoc.\n\nRonnen Harary announced that Spin Master Entertainment was \"considering whether to extend the PAW Patrol franchise into feature films at some point in the next 12 to 24 months\" in November 2017. Development for the feature film based on the PAW Patrol television series began in February 2020, with Brunker attached to direct, and Barlen and Frolick attached to write the screenplay. From October 2020 to May 2021, the voice casting call began. Production was done remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was produced almost entirely in Canada; according to Brunker, \"95 percent of everything\" happened in Canada, with the exception being some audio recording.\n\nPAW Patrol: The Movie premiered at the Vue Leicester Square in London on August 8, 2021, and also premiered in the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on August 14, and was theatrically released in both Canada and the United States on August 20, 2021. It was also made available on Paramount+ on the same day in the United States. The film received generally positive reviews from critics for its animation, themes, characterization, soundtrack, and action sequences, but criticized for its writing, pacing, and focusing on the show's merchandising arm, and became a box office success, grossing over $151 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million. A sequel titled PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie was released on September 29, 2023, featuring elements from the Mighty Pups sub-theme of the main show; a spin-off of the main series, focusing on Liberty, is scheduled to premiere on June 6, 2025, while a third film is scheduled for release on July 31, 2026.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Adventure Bay, a truck driver named Gus crashes and hangs over the town’s suspension bridge; Cap’n Turbot arrives on the scene and calls the PAW Patrol to help rescue him. After the save, a dachshund named Liberty alerts the PAW Patrol that their arch-nemesis Mayor Humdinger has just become mayor in nearby Adventure City. Chase initially refuses to go, due to PTSD from the city when he was younger, but reluctantly agrees to go after Ryder says everything will be fine.\n\nOn a rainy day as Ryder and the pups are settling into their new headquarters, Humdinger goes to a meteorology laboratory and insists on testing out the \"Cloud Catcher\", a device designed by Dr. Kendra Wilson to collect clouds for research. That night, Humdinger is giving a fireworks display to celebrate his election, but the show goes awry and Ryder and the pups suit up to respond with the help of Liberty.\n\nDuring the response, Chase sees some citizens trapped on a balcony and parachutes down to rescue them, but he forgets to take off his parachute and gets blown over the railing by a wind gust, causing him to feel distress. The next day, Humdinger unveils a loop-the-loop extension he has designed for a subway train, which breaks down and leaves the train trapped at the top of the last loop. While trying to stop the train from falling, Ryder sends Chase up to a rooftop to zip-line to the train cars so the passengers can be saved, but ends up freezing due to his fear of heights. Skye saves Chase, while Marshall rescues the passengers instead.\n\nAfter the rescue is finished, Ryder advises Chase to take a break, but a heartbroken Chase accuses him of breaking his trust and runs away, only to be captured by Humdinger's henchmen, Butch and Ruben, and taken to an obedience school which Humdinger has turned into a dog pound. There, Chase meets his cellmates who had also been kidnapped. To help save Chase, Liberty deliberately gets herself captured by knocking over a stage piece during a live interview of Humdinger. She is taken to the pound, and there, she meets a poodle named Delores and speaks with Chase. Ryder and the rest of the PAW Patrol follow, allowing them to break into the pound and set the other dogs free. As the other pups return to Adventure City HQ, Ryder takes Chase to an intersection where he had found him as a puppy and explains to Chase that he adopted him because he saw bravery in him.\n\nLater, Humdinger reveals an extension he has added to the city's tallest skyscraper, putting his office at the very top. Just then, the Cloud Catcher becomes overfilled and goes critical, having not been designed to run nonstop or be used for controlling weather as Kendra fails to have Mayor Humdinger bring it back down. It begins leaking clouds with weeks worth of nasty weather, placing a massive hurricane-strength storm over all of Adventure City. Kendra contacts the PAW Patrol and they respond in a flash, with Ryder making Liberty an official member and giving her a motor scooter.\n\nAs the pups help the citizens take cover, Ryder ascends to Humdinger's office and convinces him to evacuate by getting on the elevator. Ryder manually releases the elevator cables to quickly lower Humdinger and his kittens to the ground, and then starts rappelling down the shaft, but the tower gets blown over sideways and Ryder gets trapped. Having seen the tower fall, a horrified Chase rushes to rescue him by using suction-cupped tires on his car's detachable motorcycle to ride straight up the side of the windows. Upon seeing the glow from a safety light on Ryder's suit, Chase rushes to a gap where the tower has split. He becomes worried about getting across when he has to ditch his grappling hook, but then remembers Ryder's words about his bravery and takes a leap of faith across the gap, managing to make it to the other side. Soon he reaches Ryder and helps him get unstuck before they both escape from the building, while Skye uses a kamikaze-style attack to sacrifice her helicopter and destroy the Cloud Catcher.\n\nAs the weather is cleared and sunny again, Chase arrests Humdinger for gross negligence, public endangerment, and \"dognapping\" and gets him removed from office. Later that day, the PAW Patrol is given the key to Adventure City in a major ceremony held by Kendra and news reporter Marty Muckraker as Ryder gives Liberty her own pup tag and collar to make her a true member, finally fulfilling her dreams. The film ends with the team being called off for another rescue by one of the dogs from the pound.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nIain Armitage as Chase, an ambitious 7-year-old German Shepherd is the main protagonist of the movie who serves as a police pup. He grew up on the streets of Adventure City, giving him a \"strong character arc for the film\".[7] Armitage found the role special and enjoyable. He said, \"It's a new challenge because you don't get to convey anything with your body movements… that's all the animator's job,\" he then explained: \"You can only use your voice to convey whatever you're trying to show. But it's really fun to do animation.\"[8] Armitage replaces Justin Kelly from the series.\n\nMarsai Martin as Liberty, a spirited long-haired Dachshund who grew up and lives in Adventure City and becomes the newest member of the PAW Patrol. She considers the team to be her heroes and works hard to keep the city clean, she also dreams of becoming the team's member before joining them.[7] She is outspoken and often snarks at other people. Martin said this particular role was unique because it hits close to home.[8] Martin expressed her feelings about her role, \"She's so wild and a free spirit. She's so energetic and fun, and I feel like she'd actually make a perfect fit into the PAW Patrol because of how amazing and wild she is.\"[9]\n\nRon Pardo as:\n\nMayor Humdinger, the PAW Patrol's arch-nemesis from Foggy Bottom who is elected the mayor of nearby Adventure City due to his name being the only one on the ballot and the other candidate somehow withdrawing from the election. Though Humdinger despises the PAW Patrol pups, he has shown a general dislike for dogs in general because he prefers cats. Pardo said he drew inspiration for Mayor Humdinger's voice from mixing impressions of a Dudley Do-Right cartoon character with a well-known American entertainer from the 1930s-1950s.[10]\n\nCap'n Turbot, a sea captain and animal expert who is one of the PAW Patrol's closest friends.\n\nYara Shahidi as Dr. Kendra Wilson, a scientist who works at a university and quotes things in scientific terms that have to be repeated in normal terms until Rubble understands what she said. She invented the Cloud Catcher, a tool that Mayor Humdinger would use to clear the weather.[11]\n\nKim Kardashian as Delores, a sassy Poodle who is working at an animal shelter after being jailed in the Fuzzy Buddies obedience school.[11] Kardashian said she was excited to voice the part, thrilled that her children now consider her a \"cool mom\".[7]\n\nRandall Park as Butch, a burly man and one of Mayor Humdinger's security guards who attempt to keep the pups out of Adventure City.[11]\n\nDax Shepard as Ruben, a skinny man and another of Mayor Humdinger's security guards. On voicing his character role, Shepard stated that PAW Patrol \"was the first show he was forced to watch after becoming a dad but admitted that he actually enjoys it\", adding: \"that earned him some serious cred with his kids\". He concluded: \"I get to reintroduce my kids to that experience of going to the movies that I valued so much growing up\".[12]\n\nTyler Perry as Gus, a truck driver in the midst of transporting Canadian maple syrup to its destination when he is saved by Chase after his truck swerves off a bridge to avoid hitting a baby sea turtle.[11] Perry, on his role, saying that his 6-year-old son Aman is also thrilled that his father is involved in the film. \"He loves Skye and Chase and Zuma. I know the theme song like the back of my mind,\" he stated in an interview. \"...That's the reason I said yes. I really wanted to be a part of something that he could appreciate as much as I do.\"[13]\n\nJimmy Kimmel as Marty Muckraker, the wig-wearing news anchor of the Adventure City News Network. Kimmel also had trouble convincing his kids, 4-year-old Billy and 7-year-old Jane, of his role in the film. \"I have been telling them, trying to explain to them that Daddy's in the Paw Patrol movie,\" the late-night host jokes. \"I'm hopeful this will make me a big shot, at least for a couple of days.\"[13]\n\nWill Brisbin as Ryder, a 10-year-old boy who serves as the leader of the PAW Patrol. With his leadership, Ryder confidently sends the group on their mission to save Adventure City from dog-hating Mayor Humdinger and also having a complicated relationship with Chase.[11] Brisbin had to keep his role a closely-guarded secret for some time, which he found difficult as his nine-year-old brother is a huge PAW Patrol fan.[7] Brisbin replaces Beckett Hipkiss from the series.\n\nKeegan Hedley as Rubble, a wisecracking 5-year-old English Bulldog who serves as a construction pup. He becomes the main comic relief character in the film as opposed to the series, so Hedley was encouraged to make up his own dialogue during his recording. After recording, director Cal Brunker says that his personality is a mix of Disney/Pixar comic-relief sidekicks such as The Seven Dwarfs, Jiminy Cricket, the Genie, Timon and Pumbaa, Mushu, Dory, Mater, Olaf, Ducky and Bunny, giving him a personality change from being a tough pup to a funny comic-relief character in this film.\n\nLilly Bartlam as Skye, a sweet 7-year-old Cockapoo who serves as an aviator pup.\n\nKingsley Marshall as Marshall, a cuddly 6-year-old Dalmatian who serves as a firefighting pup.\n\nCallum Shoniker as Rocky, a clever 6-year-old mixed-breed dog who serves as a recycling pup. Shoniker previously voiced the Copycat from the Mighty Pups, Charged Up sub-series and replaces Jackson Reid from the series.\n\nShayle Simons as Zuma, an energetic 5-year-old chocolate Labrador who serves as an aquatic rescue pup.\n\nKim Roberts as Mayor Goodway, the Mayor of Adventure Bay.\n\nPaul Braunstein as a tough guy on a subway who Liberty scolds for littering. Richard Arnold voices the tough guy in the UK dub.\n\nNeil Crone as Tony, the proprietor of the namesake of his grocery store.\n\nMonique Alvarez as Carmen, Liberty's friend who works at the grocery store.\n\nJamillah Ross as a camerawoman working for Marty Muckraker.\n\nJosh Robert Thompson as the fireworks technician that Mayor Humdinger enlisted to pull off his fireworks show.\n\nJosh Graham as the computer voice that is heard in the PAW Patrol's vehicles and their satellite headquarters in Adventure City.\n\nJoe Pingue as Barney, an Old English Sheepdog and inmate at Fuzzy Buddies obedience school.\n\nCharles Gallant as Harris, a Labrador Retriever and inmate at Fuzzy Buddies obedience school. Ronan Keating provides the voice of Harris in the UK dub.\n\nRichard Binsley as Rocket, a Jack Russell Terrier and inmate at Fuzzy Buddies obedience school who often chases his tail. Tom Fletcher provides the voice of Rocket in the UK dub.\n\nRaoul Bhaneja as Dad\n\nSaara Chaudry as Daughter\n\nKevin Duhaney as a window washer\n\nFive side characters from the original series also make non-speaking cameo appearances in the film during the rescue of Gus: Francois Turbot, Katie, Mr. Porter, Farmer Al, and Farmer Yumi.[14]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2017, Ronnen Harary confirmed that Spin Master was \"currently considering whether to extend the PAW Patrol franchise into feature films at some point in the next 12 to 24 months\". Animation tests were conducted in 2017 to measure how the characters \"would translate onto the big screen\" and the company developed a film script.[15]\n\nDevelopment of the film was confirmed on February 21, 2020, with Cal Brunker attached as director while Spin Master Entertainment's president, Jennifer Dodge serves as the film's producer.[16] Production was done in both the United States and Canada.[17] On March 13, 2021, an exclusive first look of the film was shown during the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2021.[18]\n\nDodge stated that they were excited about the partnership with Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies to bring the franchise to the big screen. She adds, \"This first foray into the arena of feature film marks a significant strategic expansion for Spin Master Entertainment and our properties. This demonstrates our commitment to harnessing our own internal entertainment production teams to develop and deliver IP in a motion picture format and allows us to connect our characters to fans through shared theatrical experiences.\"[19]\n\nDodge said, \"For us, it was important to be able to tell a deeper character story than what they've been able to do with the series.\" She also explained, \"And to tell it in a way that a child really can understand and relate to, and maybe even their parents get a deeper meaning from it. You can have a hard day at school or daycare and you can rise above those difficulties and you can come through on the other side. It doesn't mean you're never scared, it doesn't mean you don't doubt yourself. But, if at the end of the day, you really believe in yourself and you have people around you who believe in you, you can overcome it.\"[20]\n\n\"When the chance came to pitch my take on the movie, I was able to bring all of their experience and what my kids loved about the show to the pitch, and I think that really helped,\" says Brunker. \"Our take was, we really wanted to build this around the emotional journey of one character, so it felt like more of a theatrical experience. You go on a journey with one of these characters overcoming their struggles, and the whole team is involved, but we felt that that was the best way to bring an audience deeper into the story.\"[20]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Iain Armitage, Marsai Martin, Yara Shahidi, Kim Kardashian, Randall Park, Dax Shepard, Tyler Perry, Jimmy Kimmel were announced as part of the cast.[21] On May 3, 2021, the cast and characters were announced.[22] Adam Levine, Perry and Kardashian joined the cast because their respective children were fans of the show.[23] For the role of Ryder, more than 1,000 people auditioned before Will Brisbin a 15-years old actor from Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada, got the role.\n\nOn July 14, it was announced that Ronan Keating, Richard Arnold, Sam Faiers and Tom Fletcher were added to the cast as part of the voice cameos for the dubs in the UK and Ireland.[24][25]\n\nDuring an interview with Collider, Brunker spoke about enjoying the voice cast overall. \"The core cast of pups and Ryder are all kids, and that was new for us and really wonderful. We really worked with them to try to get true, meaningful performances out of all the characters, and I thought they did an amazing job. The character of Chase, played by Iain [Armitage], goes on such a wonderful emotional journey that's a little bit unexpected, and he just brought so much to it. He broke our hearts in some moments. You really end up rooting for him. In terms of improvisation, I would say Marsai's deliveries were the things that were most surprising. She almost couldn't do anything bad. When we were going through the takes, it was like, \"This is great. This is great in a different way. And this is great in a different way.\" She was wonderful and brought so much energy to it. Everybody was wonderful. Dax [Shepard] is the nicest guy, who was game on for everything. Tyler Perry was thrilled to be a part of it. His son is a big fan, and he certainly loves to improvise and do lots of takes. We couldn't have had a better cast or a better experience for recording them.\"[23]\n\nIn an interview with Screen Rant, Iain Armitage spoke about the film and how he aspires to be like his canine counterpart Chase, ahead of the film's home entertainment release. He stated about the film's main character, \"Chase is a fun, funny, smart, brave, loyal dog. And he's a police dog, and he's sort of the, I don't think he's the head of the team, but he's really on top of things. I think he's very cool under pressure. He's very helpful. And he always loves to help other people. And he's always very kind, which I think is very important. And I think I try to be like him in everyday life. I don't always succeed, but I try.\"\n\nAccording to Armitage, \"The cool thing about voice-over is, you can't convey things with your body because, of course, they don't see it. So you sort of have to have everything that you're going to be doing for the character come through in your voice, which is hard, but it's also kind of fun. It's a fun challenge, but on the upside, you can show up to work in pajamas, and they won't get mad at you. So that balances out. But I think just trying to really bring emotion into my voice in some of those scenes and to really make it clear that I care about Ryder [Will Brisbin] and my fellow pups on the team.\"[26]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 21, 2020, Bob Barlen announced that he would co-write the screenplay with Billy Frolick.[27][19] Director Cal Brunker, who also wrote the film along with his childhood friend Bob Barlen and Billy Frolick, came to the film with a solid understanding of the characters thanks to his own kids.[20]\n\nScreenwriter Barlen described the main character to be focused on in the film:\n\n\"Chase is kind of like the quarterback. Chase sort of seems like the main character, and so being able to expand and kind of have a character who fails and who has to overcome an obstacle is important. We were able to do more than the TV show time allows. Starting in Adventure Bay, you see him as that same perfect pup from the show where he's executing things flawlessly. That's really where we were able to expand on his backstory and create something that would be worthy of the feature film. So, you're seeing him for the first time really ever make mistakes and mess up and come to terms with not being perfect, and then pushing through and overcoming that fear. That was really something that we were excited about in terms of telling a story.\"[20]\n\nBrunker adds, \"At its core, the movie is about what it means to be scared, and how to overcome your fears. It felt really important to be doing something that we could share with people at this time as the movie comes out. I think people are coming out of this time of fear and uncertainty, and I think the movie has a lot to say about that. And we really feel proud that hopefully this is going to be one of the first movies that people get to see in theaters again.\"\n\nThe film also represented the fulfillment of a lifetime dream for Bob Barlen and Cal Brunker, who had been making films together for decades. Brunker had known Barlen since they attended high school, and would make films with him later into their respective careers: \"Back before we ever got a chance to make a movie, Bob and I went to Hollywood for the first time, and we actually paid to go on the Paramount lot tour. You know, you get to see behind the gates. We said to each other, wouldn't it be amazing if one day we were making a movie for Paramount? Well, we're six or seven weeks away from our first movie for Paramount coming out. And to be entrusted with such a beloved brand for so many people and to be able to share that with the world, this is a dream come true for us. It's been something we've been working towards for a long time and, and it's a real gift.\"[20]\n\nAnimation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 8, 2019, it was announced that Mikros Image in Montreal would handle the animation.[28] There are 250 filmmakers with a team of about 60 devoted to the animation. Their biggest challenge was creating high-quality theatrical animation that didn't lose the style of the series. They were also especially interested in creating action scenes that had more of a realistic quality.[20]\n\nWhile they wanted to focus on the backstory of one character, it was also important to them to add a new female pup to the crew, since the character Skye is usually the only female on the team. New pups often appear in the series for a specific adventure to round out the team, but then are not necessarily in every episode going forward.[20]\n\nBarlen stated about adding a new pup to the film: \"For us, in terms of actually creating Liberty, it was really fun because one of the nice things was that we were able to create a character that maybe was a bit different than the other pups. All the pups in the PAW Patrol are perfect and they're great. They're a certain way, but Liberty has got a little bit of an edge to her, which is nice. Having her experience and seeing her experiencing the film from her point of view, as she relates to the PAW Patrol, is really fun. And then, in terms of Marsai Martin who plays her, she's such an incredible actress. It was such a gift that she agreed to do it because she really brings the character to life. We couldn't imagine her being played in a better way by a better character, so we were really looking to have her on.\" Brunker says that Liberty is a new character, which allows them to write differently for her than the other pups. They also knew when she grow up in Adventure City, it justifies her having a little bit 'thicker' skin and a tougher way of talking. He stated that it is fun to juxtapose with the attitudes that the other people used to from the regular core team of pups.\n\nBrunker stated: \"For me, it started really young with drawing and being a visual thinker and expressing myself visually. The idea of being able to create almost anything you can imagine in animation is something that I find incredibly attractive...\" while Barlen agrees, saying, \"One of the nice things about animated movies, just from growing up on animated films and loving them well past when I was grown, is that it's so many people coming together and being able to make a film on a large scale that goes out so wide across the world. One of the exciting things about being a filmmaker is that your work is seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Animation allows us to work at a scale where we can do something spectacular and really special on screen.\"[23]\n\n\"My daughter is a huge Skye fan\", says Brunker. \"She was four when we started making this movie. So, we wanted to give Skye some really big, exciting moments. We also felt, just in terms of bringing something fresh and new to the team, a new girl pup would be wonderful. Because she's new for the movie, we wanted to make her stand out. We thought that because she was from the city we could make her a little tougher, a little more rough around the edges than the other pups are, and that would bring something fresh to that world as well.\"\n\nDodge and Brunker both thought the style of the animation needed to remain true to the series, but with some significant adjustments to give it a more theatrical feel. According to Brunker, they wanted to redesign some things noticed in the movie: \"The back legs of the dogs actually look and function like real dog legs and in the TV show they're kind of more cartoony; just kind of stick legs. We felt it would allow them to move more like real dogs, and if we could push the realism of the movement, then it would make the fact that they're doing these great big rescues and all this heroic stuff even more exciting.\"[20]\n\nAt a reported budget of $26 million,[4] the CGI animation is more polished and textured than the series, with Brunker and his team reshaping and rebuilding every character, vehicle and environment from scratch. Aside from some voice recording in Los Angeles (including recordings from most of the cast remotely) and orchestral scoring in Nashville, \"95 percent of everything\" happened in Canada, according to Brunker.[29]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nHeitor Pereira composed the music for the film.

It went on to debut to $13 million, finishing second behind holdover Free Guy; 88% of the audience was made up of families, 63% being under the age of 25. The opening was noteworthy because Regal Cinemas, the second-largest chain in the U.S., refused to carry the film due to its day-and-date release.[60] The film fell 50% in its second weekend to $6.6 million, finishing in third.[61] It then made $4 million in its third weekend, declining 40% and finishing in fifth place.[62]\n\nWorldwide, PAW Patrol: The Movie debuted in six markets, making $5.8 million in its first weekend, including a $2.3 million opening in France and a $3.2 million opening in the United Kingdom.[63] In its second weekend, the film made $12.8 million in 39 markets; the top countries were Germany ($2.6 million), the Netherlands ($1.1 million), Mexico ($864,000), France, and the United Kingdom.

And does it well.\"[68] Kristen Page-Kirby of The Washington Post gave two and a half stars out of four and said, \"A better movie than it needs to be, with some neat visuals, an outstanding score and a story that, while simple, is well told.\"[69] Glenn Kenny of The New York Times called the film, \"Entirely toddler-friendly and irony-free\".[70]\n\nNate Adams of The Only Critic gave the film a B, and wrote in his review, \"I think three to six-year-olds are going to wince with glee at the sight of their favorite puppers saving the day, but the parents who are forced to go along for the ride will appreciate the film's cheery sense of humor and educational elements.\"[71] Lisa Giles-Keddie of HeyUGuys gave the film four stars out of five and said, \"A relentlessly entertainment big screen outing for the familiar pups. A perfect slice of summer cinema for all the family.\"[72] James Mottram of South China Morning Post gave the film three stars out of five, saying \"Paw Patrol: The Movie is a solidly entertaining film for kids, with plenty of crash-bang action.\"[73]\n\nNell Minow of RogerEbert.com gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Parents will appreciate the way the pups tackle problem-solving, working together to make the best use of each character's talents.\"[74] Courtney Howard of Variety found that, \"Any crass consumerism is eclipsed by disarming, demonstrable themes and meaningful sentiments woven throughout the film's textured fabric.\"[1] Yolanda Machado of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, stating \"Brunker and his co-writers find a way to deliver a multi-layered story that can grab toddlers while keeping older viewers entertained and not groaning at some propagandized messaging.\"[75] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called the film, \"Harmless fun for its target audience\".[76]\n\nReviews were not uniformly positive. Some critics were critical in the film for lazy and lackluster writing, poor pacing and focusing too much on the franchise's merchandising arm. Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant gave the film a negative review, saying, \"Paw Patrol has enough action to keep young fans entertained, but parents will likely be bored by the dragging pace and convoluted plot.\"[77] Jude Dry of IndieWire gave the film a D, and wrote in her review, \"While it's doubtful the humorless dirge of a movie will make enough of an impression to mold young minds in any lasting way, the critique of PAW Patrol is useful as an amalgamation of certain favorite Hollywood themes that ought to be retired.\"[78]\n\nWriting for The A.V. Club, Jesse Hassenger criticized the film's merchandise and gave the film a C− saying, \"The film version feels most energized when it's amping up to sell toys: fetishizing the clicking of plastic into plastic, and supersizing the characters' armor and vehicles with a deranged zeal matched only by real police departments around the country.\"[79] Writing for Los Angeles Times, Michael Ordoña criticized the film for writing under the parents despite 'its awesomeness' for very young audiences. He stated, \"To very young kids who like cartoon dogs driving shiny vehicles, \"PAW Patrol: The Movie\" may be awesome. To grown-ups, it may be an aggressively under-written, 88-minute toy commercial.\" He felt that the voice actors were \"unremarkable\" and criticized the script, writing, \"The dialogue is fairly represented by the line: 'Where is it? There's so many buildings. I wonder which one it is.'\"[80]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.
