        "text": "I think Suburbia was referring to the senior team.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/sport/hong-kon...ammed-legislative-council-its-poor-governance\n\nHKFA slammed by Legislative Council for its ‘poor governance’\n\nThe Hong Kong Football Association has come under fire again for its poor governance, with Legislative Councillors slamming the association committee members for its continued absence from meetings for a period of up to four years.\n\nLots of criticism in there. Sometimes I do believe the HKFA are doing everything they can, but sometimes I think they are not really bothered.\n\nYou could say fire everyone and start over, but I wonder who would want the jobs? Very little pay and the people are very hard to please.\n\nNow that Eastern have the deepest squad in the league, you knew that eventually some players would leave for playing time. The news today suggests that Tsang Kam To, Tse Long Hin, Wu Chun Ming. Lau Hok Ming, Yiu Ho Ming and Chen Hao Wei will all leave the club before the season restarts. In particular, Wu will be loaned back to his old club Pegasus.\n\nhttp://paper.wenweipo.com/2020/05/26/SP2005260021.htm\n\nTai Po FC is in financial trouble (again). The latest news is that Tai Po FC will pull out of competing in the remaining matches of the season. That means only 6 clubs will compete for the 2019-20 HKPL title. Head coach Fung Hoi Man has already left the club.\n\nThe HKFA held a press conference today to clear the air about their recent corruption allegations....or at least, that was the plan. Instead, Pui Kwan Kay took the opportunity to express outrage at the whistle blower who disclosed to the media that Sam Bensleys actual credentials were different from those on his application.\n\nWhat was more egregious was that Pui spent eight minutes railing against someone named Philip (probably Lap Lap) for circulating an email against the Premier League clubs that they should consider breaking away from the league and forming their own league without the HKFA's involvement.\n\nSo interestingly enough, the HKFA announced a U-23 and U-19 training squad from 1st June to 20th June even though the reason is not known considering that both sides failed to qualify for the next edition of the AFC U23 and U19 championships. Anyways, here are the list of players named for the training camp.\n\nHong Kong U23:\n\nGoalkeepers:\n\nWONG Tsz Ho (Best Union Yuen Long), LAW King Hei (Hong Kong Pegasus),\n\nCHOY Tsz To (Kwoon Chung Southern), TSE Ka Wing (R&F),\n\nCHIN Alex Palelei (Wofoo Tai Po)\n\nDefenders:\n\nLEUNG Yau Wai (CD Cova Piedade), CHEUNG Chun Hin Macro,\n\nYIP Cheuk Man (Happy Valley), CHAN Hoi Pak Paco,\n\nLAU Wing Sang Rinson (Kwoon Chung Southern), WONG Pun Wai (BC Rangers), CHENG See Chun, YANG Lok Hang\n\nMidfielders:\n\nWONG Chun Hin (Best Union Yuen Long), POON Pui Hin, WONG Chi Hong,\n\nYUEN Sai Kit (Happy Valley), CHANG Hei Yin(Hong Kong Pegasus),\n\nCHAN Shinichi (Kitchee), LAM Hin Ting, LAM Jordan Lok Kan (R&F),\n\nKOT Chun Hey, POON King Chi Titus\n\nForwards:\n\nCHU Wai Kwan (Happy Valley), LEE Oi Hin (Hong Kong Pegasus),\n\nBUDDLE Sebastian Robert (Kitchee), CHENG Tsz Sum, SUN Ming Him (Wofoo Tai Po), CHOW Ka Lok Leo (Lee Man)\n\nHong Kong U19:\n\nGoalkeepers:\n\nLO Siu Kei (BC Rangers), NG Wai Him (Happy Valley), TAI Ting Hong (Lee Man), NGAN Ngo Tin (South China), WAN Michael\n\nDefenders:\n\nSO Dick On (Happy Valley), LAM Tsz Shan, YANG Tsz Pan (Wofoo Tai Po), CHAN Yun Tung, TONG Qiao Zhe George, WONG Chun, WONG Yat\n\nMidfielders:\n\nLAI Pui Kei, NG Ka Yeung, LAM Lok Yin Jerry, TANG In Chim, MOORE Henry Hills (Happy Valley),CHIU Wan Chun, HO Ka Chi (Hong Kong Pegasus), CHANG Kwong Yin, TONG Connor Hew Fung (Kitchee), CHENG Chun Wang Ryan (Kwoon Chung Southern), WONG Ho Chun (South China), YU Jesse Joy Yin\n\nForwards:\n\nFUNG Tsz Hin Les (Chelsea Soccer School (HK)), CHEN Ngo Hin,\n\nICHIKAWA Sohgo (Kitchee), CHEUNG Chit Hang Adrian, LAU Ka Kiu\n\nSource: Hong Kong Premier League Facebook - U23 & U19\n\nAlways been corrupt mate. It's just that thankfully – for now at least – there's an Audit Commission to hold them to account and shine a light on their corruption.\n\nhttp://paper.wenweipo.com/2020/05/30/SP2005300009.htm\n\nThere is a debate on whether the 2020 AFC Cup has already begun, if it has, then Tai Po's withdrawal will not bring a replacement; but if it hasn't, the R&F FC, who has already secured a AFC Club license, then may get to replace Tai Po in Group I."
