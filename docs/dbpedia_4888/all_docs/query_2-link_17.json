        "text": "I would predict that Andersen is more likely to stick with Yapp Hung Fai considering that he is the most capped international at senior level. But I could see the likes of Tse Ka Wing being used maybe perhaps during the 2022 Asian Games football event and maybe during the home leg of the Bhutan game.\n\nAs for Paulo, he only has another season or two left before I predict he will probably call time on his career and I do not see him challenge neither Yapp, Tse or Ng for the goalkeeping #1 spot.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming 2022 Asian Games football event, here is the finalised squad:\n\nAs expected, Leung Nok Hang, Vas Nunez and Shinichi Chan will not feature and are replaced by North District's Jordan Lam Lok Kan, Lee Man's Wu Chun Ming and Rangers' Li Ngai Hoi. Guangxi's Matt Orr still retain's his spot as one of the three overaged players.\n\nNine of the players that were part of the recent AFC U23 qualifiers are in the squad.\n\nIn other news, KC Southern signed 24 year old Hong Kong-Italian goalkeeper Leonardo Costa to the club.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/sport/football...d-feelings-over-making-knockout-stage-without\n\nAsian Games 2023: Hong Kong boss Andersen has mixed feelings over making knockout stage without kicking a ball\n\nAfghanistan and Syria’s decision to withdraw means Hong Kong and Uzbekistan are automatically into the round of 16\n\nBut with Uzbekistan tipped to win a medal, and Japan, Qatar or Palestine up next, Hong Kong could be in for a tough few days in Hangzhou\n\nHong Kong boss Jorn Andersen said there were pros and cons to his side qualifying for the knockout stages of the Asian Games without kicking a ball, as he admitted his team might fail to win a single game in Hangzhou.\n\nAfghanistan and Syria’s withdrawal from Group C leaves Hong Kong and Uzbekistan to play each other twice, with the only thing at stake a marginally better draw in the next round.\n\nThe first of those matches takes place at the Shangcheng Sports Centre Stadium on Friday evening, and Andersen said he had been happy to have the extra days to prepare his team, given his side’s first game was supposed to have been against Syria on Wednesday.\n\n“We didn’t have much preparation with this team before, only had one training session on Sunday in Hong Kong,” the 60-year-old Norwegian said. “I am happy to have these two days to train and to prepare the team better for the important game.”\n\nUzbekistan though are clear favourites, and with four players from the squad that reached the last 16 of the Fifa U-20 World Cup in Argentina earlier this year, some consider then gold medal contenders.\n\n“They are very strong, technically and physically good, so it will be a hard match,” Andersen said. “But we have to try to play more aggressively against them, we need to attack more, rather than sitting back and defend.\n\n“We need to push them, and if we do, perhaps we have a better chance to have a better performance.”\n\nAnd despite already getting into the last 16, Andersen admitted to having “mixed feelings” over a situation that leaves his team facing three tough matches.\n\n“We hoped we could play against Syria and Afghanistan, teams that we can compete against,” he said.\n\n“But the sudden changes probably mean it’s going to be difficult for us to win a match in this tournament because we will likely play against some really strong teams [in the knockout stage].\n\n“It’s both a good and bad thing because there is not so much pressure, knowing that we will still be in the competition even if we lose both games, but the bad things are we may have to play against strong teams we cannot compete with.”\n\nLosing both games would mean Hong Kong facing one of Japan, Qatar or Palestine next Wednesday, but striker Matthew Orr was unconcerned about who came next.\n\n“To have the opportunity to play in the knockout stage of the Asian Games is very special, it’s never a guarantee,” he said. “But if we have the chance to play in one, why not go for it 100 per cent?\n\n“We are not looking at it too much right now because we have two games before to prepare for the knockout stage, but it’s definitely a good thing for Hong Kong football.”\n\nOrr, who plays for China League One side Guangxi Pingguo Haliao, is one of the three overage players in the city’s squad, and the 26-year-old said with that came more responsibility.\n\n“Being one of the older players, it’s my job to be a leader, on and off the pitch,” he said. “I just tried to instil the right focus and mentality for this game.\n\n“It’s a big challenge but one that excites us, in football anything can happen as long as we are confident, I know what I am capable of if I perform on the pitch.”\n\nHong Kong’s previous best Games result was a quarter-final finish in 1958. Since sending the city’s under-23 team to the Games in 2002, Hong Kong have reached the last 16 in the past three editions, but failed to progress beyond that.\n\n======================================================\n\nMaybe we should have taken Singapore, Syria, Afghanistan and Macau's examples and not play in the Asian Games. Macau's non participation means there is no pressure from the mainland and it is not a must for HKFA to send its team."
