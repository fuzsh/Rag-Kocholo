Appeals to the Panel\n\nLodging an Appeal\n\nThe tenant may appeal to AP when a lease has been terminated under section 19(1)(a) or (aa) of the Housing Ordinance, or where a notice to quit has been given under section 19(1)(b) of the Housing Ordinance, not later than 15 days after the date on which service of the notice of termination was effected or notice to quit was given. If the tenant is unable to appeal by reason of ill-health, absence or other cause thought sufficient by the Chairman of AP, a person authorized under the lease to occupy the flat may, subject to the approval by the Chairman of AP, lodge an appeal on behalf of the tenant.\n\nAn appeal shall be in writing and shall state the grounds of the appeal. The tenant may submit the appeal by hand or by mail to the Appeal Panel (Housing) (Address: 33 Fat Kwong Street, Ho Man Tin, Kowloon, Hong Kong).\n\nImportant Notice: The notice of appeal must be lodged with the AP within the above-mentioned statutory 15-day period. The Court of Appeal of the High Court of Hong Kong has held that any failure to bring an appeal within the time limit would be an absolute bar to the appeal proceeding (CACV 426/2000, 8 December 2000). AP therefore has no legal power to allow any appeal lodged outside the time limit to proceed.\n\nNote: If you choose to send your appeal documents by mail, please ensure your mail items bear sufficient postage and indicate the return addresses before posting to ensure proper delivery to the Appeal Panel. Underpaid mail items will be returned to the sender or disposed of by the Hongkong Post. The Appeal Panel will not accept late appeals.\n\nFor information about âSufficient Postage Ensures Prompt Deliveryâ, please click on:\n\nhttps://www.hongkongpost.hk/en/sending_mail/note/index.html\n\nNotice of Hearing\n\nAfter the appeal is properly lodged with AP, a hearing will be arranged. A notice of hearing together with the summary of facts prepared by the HA will be issued to the appellant by registered post not less than 14 days before the date of hearing.\n\nThe appellant may appear in person at the hearing, or may be represented by a counsel, solicitor or any person authorized by him/her in writing. If an appellant will be represented at the hearing, he/she shall notify the AP Secretariat in writing the name of the person representing him/her and whether this representative is a counsel, solicitor or a person authorized in writing by the appellant. Such notice of representation should reach the AP Secretariat not less than 7 working days before the date of hearing.\n\nHearing of an Appeal\n\nAppeals are heard by appeal tribunals composed of three AP members, and one of them acts as the chairman.\n\nThe hearing of an appeal shall be in public except in special circumstances. Hearings are normally conducted in Cantonese. Simultaneous interpretation will be provided to the appellant if necessary.\n\nThe hearing is normally conducted in the following manner -\n\nHA representatives will first state the background of the case and the reasons for termination of lease or serving the notice to quit. The appeal tribunal and the appellant may put questions to HA representatives.\n\nThe appellant will then give his/her grounds of appeal. The appeal tribunal and HA representatives may put questions to the appellant.\n\nAfter all parties have finished their statements and questions, the appeal tribunal will order the appellant, HA representatives and any bystanders to leave. The appeal tribunal will proceed to deliberate and determine the appeal in private.\n\nIf an appellant does not appear and is not represented at a hearing of the appeal, the appeal tribunal may, if satisfied that the notice of hearing has been given to him/her â\n\nproceed to hear the appeal in the absence of the appellant, or\n\nadjourn the hearing.\n\nIn case of inclement weather (such as the hoisting of Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal or Rainstorm Warning Signal by the Hong Kong Observatory) during a hearing day, AP will handle the scheduled hearing according to the arrangements laid down in the relevant Notice (Typhoon & Rainstorm Warning Arrangements ).\n\nDecision of the Appeal Tribunal\n\nAn appeal tribunal, in determining an appeal against a termination â\n\nunder section 19(1)(a) or (aa), may confirm, suspend or cancel the termination;\n\nunder section 19(1)(b), may confirm, amend, suspend or cancel the notice to quit.\n\nThe decision of the appeal tribunal shall be final.\n\nThe AP Secretariat will notify the appellant and HA in writing of the appeal tribunal's decision as soon as possible, normally within 14 days after the date of hearing.\n\n4. Scheduled Hearings\n\nNote: Members of the public may be admitted as visitors to observe the hearing. For enquiries and reservation, please contact the AP secretariat before the relevant hearing date (Tel: 2761 7252). Visitors are advised to read our House Rules.\n\nSee House Rules\n\n5.
