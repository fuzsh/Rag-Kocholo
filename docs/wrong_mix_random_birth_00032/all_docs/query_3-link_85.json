        "text": "Mission\n\nThe mission of Talbot School of Theology is the development of disciples of Jesus Christ whose thought processes, character and lifestyles reflect those of our Lord, and who are dedicated to disciple making throughout the world. Both the nature and the purpose of Talbot School of Theology are elaborated more specifically in the following paragraphs and further expanded at various places throughout the catalog as noted under each heading.\n\nTheologically\n\nThe theological position of Talbot School of Theology is Christian, protestant, and theologically conservative. The school is interdenominational by nature and is thoroughly committed to the proclamation of the great historic doctrines of the Christian church. It definitely and positively affirms historic orthodoxy in the framework of an evangelical and premillennial theology that is derived from a grammatico-historical interpretation of the Bible. It earnestly endeavors to make these great doctrinal truths a vital reality in the spiritual life of this present generation. The seminary aims to train students who believe and propagate the great doctrines of the faith as they are summarized in our Statement of Doctrine and Explanatory Notes.\n\nSpiritually\n\nIt is the purpose of Talbot to develop in the lives of its students a spiritual life that is in harmony with the great doctrines taught, so that they may grow in the grace as well as in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Specifically, the goal is to educate and graduate students characterized by commitment to serving Christ, missionary and evangelistic zeal and a solid knowledge of the Scriptures. To accomplish these objectives, the seminary conducts a chapel program and gives attention to its students' ministry/service opportunities.\n\nAcademically\n\nIt is the purpose of the seminary to provide its students with the best in theological education so they may be equipped to preach and teach the Word of God intelligently and present it zealously to the world. In keeping with this goal, every department is geared to emphasize the clear and accurate exposition of the Scriptures. The biblical languages are utilized to expose the inner meaning of the inspired text. Bible exposition, whether by synthesis or analysis, presents a connected and related interpretation of the infallible Book. Systematic theology moves toward a well-organized and structured arrangement of biblical truth. Historical theology engages itself to acquaint the student with the progress of the inerrant Word among the household of faith throughout the Christian era. Philosophy furnishes the elements whereby the servant of Christ may give a well-developed reason for the faith that is within. Missions, Christian ministry and leadership, and Christian education strive to perfect in the student a skillful and winsome presentation of the truth, privately and publicly. Talbot stands for one faith, one integrated curriculum, one eternal Word of God and its effective proclamation to this generation with its multiplicity of needs.\n\nPractically\n\nIt is the purpose of the seminary to prepare for the gospel ministry those who believe, live and preach the great historic doctrines of faith that have been committed to the church. To realize these broad objectives, the seminary offers nine degree programs, each with its own distinctive purpose.\n\nTalbot's Spiritual Formation Core\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the Spiritual Formation Core at Talbot School of Theology and the Institute for Spiritual Formation centers on students more deeply understanding and participating in life in Christ and cooperating with the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, whose purpose is to form persons into the image of Christ through union with the Triune God. A major objective is opening the heart in truth to the New Covenant work of Christ and the ministry of the Spirit in sanctification. The resulting change of character or fruit of the Spirit is accomplished through cooperation with the Indwelling Spirit and not by means of human efforts alone.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of Talbot's Spiritual Formation Core is to:\n\nTrain students in a basic knowledge of Spiritual Theology (the integrative study of Scripture and the ministry of the indwelling Holy Spirit regarding the nature, process and directives of spiritual transformation in Christ),\n\nEncourage students to exhibit and integrate the Double Knowledge of God and one's self through application in their own process of spiritual transformation, and\n\nPractice relational and caring skills focused on developing communities of growth in the body of Christ.\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of Talbot's Spiritual Formation Core, graduates will be able to:\n\nExplain the basic elements of Spiritual Theology, namely, the nature, process, and practices of spiritual growth (ULO 1).\n\nDemonstrate how knowledge of self integrates with knowledge of God in one's own life (ULO 2).\n\nDemonstrate relational skills that develop community (ULO 3).\n\nArticulate how the biblical teaching on vocation shapes one's own understanding of vocation and gainful employment (ULO 1, 2, 3).\n\nEach Program Learning Outcome (PLO) listed above references at least one of the University Learning Outcomes (ULO 1, 2, 3), which may be found in the General Information section of this catalog.\n\nCourses\n\nStudents are required to take three main courses in the Spiritual Formation Core at Talbot (TTSF 501, TTSF 503 and TTSF 504). These courses will be completed sequentially during three semesters, beginning with the first semester at Talbot. Two semesters of individual Spiritual Direction/mentoring (TTSF 505, TTSF 506) are also required. The three main courses required in Talbot's Spiritual Formation Core (TTSF 501, TTSF 503 and TTSF 504) are taken in sequence to provide continuity in understanding the process of sanctification and for the development of community in cohort groups. Cohort groups of approximately twelve students will be formed in TTSF 501 and will remain together throughout the completion of the three courses in the Spiritual Formation Core.\n\nSpiritual Retreats\n\nStudents are required to take three retreats of varying length and content for the purpose of spiritual growth. The first retreat is completed in the first semester in TTSF 501, which focuses upon opening the heart in truth in one's relationship with Christ and developing Christ-centered community. The second retreat is completed in the second semester in TTSF 503 for the purpose of exploring our human relationships in the body of Christ. The third retreat is taken in the third semester in TTSF 504, which focuses upon one's vocation in relation to the various calls of God in one's life, particularly one's personal call to ministry.\n\nBaccalaureate Celebration\n\nUpon completion of a student's Talbot degree program, there will be a celebration, commissioning and thanksgiving service. This evening service, attended by spouses, family members, mentors, and faculty, will focus on accomplishment, spiritual growth, thanksgiving, hooding, commissioning into ministry and acknowledgment of the people who encouraged and supported the student throughout the Talbot journey.\n\nMen and Women at Talbot School of Theology\n\nWomen and men are created in the image of God (Gen. 1:27) and called to mutual submission (Eph. 5:21). This calling of two differently endowed equals to serve the other in oneness is the source of Scripture’s compelling and beautiful vision for human life. Talbot is committed to promoting this vision.\n\nTalbot sees flourishing human life as a divinely ordained means to reflect God in the world. Gender is intended to facilitate our flourishing, especially through our relationships with one another. It is a unique gift offered for the benefit of the other.\n\nTalbot also affirms the unique ways each gender realizes its submission and deference for the sake of the other. In the New Covenant, both women and men are called to build up the body of Christ through the fruit and gifts of the Spirit. Talbot believes that Scripture teaches that God has called men to Christlike headship in the family and oversight as elders in the church. The sacrificial, God-oriented, and others-centered nature of this responsibility absolutely precludes domination, authoritarianism, and any other form of leadership that is contrary to the example of Christ. The family of God is called to mutual respect, interdependence, and love, reflecting a community in which all members are empowered by the Spirit to grow in Christlike character.\n\nTalbot offers its quality theological education to both men and women and supports the full participation of men and women in all ranks of administration, faculty, admissions, degree programs, student recruitment, and other aspects of university life, including speaking in chapels and university public events. As an educational institution, Talbot does not have authority for the ordination of anyone seeking vocational Christian ministry but recognizes this as the appropriate function of church bodies. At Talbot, we joyfully train men and women students for the callings affirmed by their churches.\n\nAs a university, Biola welcomes a range of theological perspectives on the roles of men and women that are consistent with the University’s Articles of Faith and Statement of Biblical Principles. As such, this particular statement is unique to Talbot among the schools of the university.\n\nTalbot Women\n\nThe Talbot Women group (married/single Talbot students and wives of Talbot students) provides an opportunity for women to deepen their relationships with God, establish meaningful friendships with other women, grow together, pray together, and become equipped to serve our Lord and the church more effectively. Talbot Women meets each Tuesday evening during the Spring and Fall semesters. These meetings include a special speaker, a short discussion time, and an extended time of prayer in groups led by Talbot faculty wives. Each semester there is a different theme which ranges from practical ministry skills to the exploration of scripture and spiritual truths.\n\nSpouse Tuition Reduction Scholarship\n\nThe \"Spouse Tuition Reduction Scholarship\" allows spouses of full-time students to take masters level seminary courses for academic credit at one-third of the standard tuition rate.\n\nChapel\n\nThe purpose of chapel is to provide opportunities for worship, instruction and exposure to current issues, ministries, missions and gifted individuals. Chapel is an important part of a student's educational experience, contributing significantly to individual spiritual formation and the unity of the seminary community.\n\nChapel services are conducted each Tuesday in the Calvary Chapel auditorium. Additional special chapels are held as announced. Joint University-wide chapel services are held several times a year. Students are required to attend Tuesday chapel services if they have classes either immediately before or after the chapel hour. This requirement also applies to the Thursday of the Lyman Stewart Lectures (Fall) and the Robert Saucy Lectures (Spring). Participation in the chapel services of the university community are also highly encouraged.\n\nLecture Series\n\nSpecial lectures to supplement and enhance the seminary experience are held twice a year during the Tuesday/Thursday chapel hours. Lecture series are:\n\nLyman Stewart Lectures (Fall)\n\nRobert L. Saucy Lectures (Spring)\n\nStudent Christian Service\n\nThe seminary recognizes the necessity of active service in Christian work while students are pursuing their courses of study. From the time of enrollment students are asked to engage in some type of approved weekly ministry. The high population density of Southern California creates extensive service opportunities of many types.\n\nField Education (Field Apprenticeship)\n\nField education, or field apprenticeship, is that part of the student's academic program in which there is active participation in a supervised experience within a church or parachurch setting. A full-time M.Div. student should register for field apprenticeship about once a year. A part-time M.Div. student should register for field apprenticeship once within every 18 credits completed. Certain M.A. programs may require field apprenticeship, as well. Details can be found in the particular M.A. curriculum charts.\n\nAfter completing field apprenticeship courses TTPT 591, TTPT 592, and TTPT 691, M.Div. students become eligible to register for Field Apprenticeship IV (TTPT 791). This final course is more intensive and supervised, and includes:\n\nSupervision by three (3) mentors each semester during their Field Apprenticeship courses to guide, counsel, and encourage them in their ministry experience.\n\nSeminars with other students registered for field apprenticeship.\n\nMentoring from professors or ministry leaders on specific aspects of the student's experience.\n\nThe Biola Campus\n\nThe seminary has classroom, chapel and administrative office facilities located in Myers Hall, Feinberg Hall, the Grove, and Talbot East. Metzger Hall houses University administrative offices including the Admissions and Registrar's Offices.\n\nIn addition, the seminary shares the library, cafeteria, coffee shop, residences, gymnasium, health center and prayer chapel with Biola University. Also available are an all-weather jogging track, a soccer field, a baseball diamond, tennis courts and a short course Olympic swimming pool. See the General Information section for a full campus description.\n\nAccreditation\n\nTalbot is included within Biola University’s accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the WASC Senior College and University Commission. Talbot is also a member of the Association of Theological Schools, the internationally recognized accrediting body of seminaries and schools of divinity in the United States and Canada.\n\nTalbot is accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.\n\n1.

Arrangements may be made with a faculty member who agrees to guide the student in studying course content and fulfilling requirements individually apart from the scheduled class meeting. An Arranged Course form is used for adding this type of course to a student's schedule and is obtainable in the Office of the Registrar.\n\nIndependent Studies\n\nIndependent Studies are an integral part of the Biola University experience. An Independent Study is a course which does not appear in the Catalog, is initiated by the student, and the student then works independently toward the goals and objectives outlined by the professor on an Arranged Course form. Students who are in good standing and not on probation are eligible to enroll in an Independent Study.\n\nA maximum of 6 credits may be taken by a student in independent study and/or arranged coursework during the student's degree program.\n\nTheological Studies Digital Courses\n\nThese digital courses offer lectures in an MP3 format by outstanding biblical scholars. They are available as electives or prerequisites for degree-seeking Talbot students. Students desiring to purchase these courses for non-credit, personal use may contact the office of the Dean of Faculty. Students who experience irresolvable scheduling problems previous to graduation may use them to meet their requirements. They may not normally be used in lieu of required courses. The use of Theological Studies Digital Courses is limited as follows:\n\nElective Credits or Irresolvable Scheduling Problem\n\nTheological Studies Digital Courses Masters Program Credits Master of Divinity 6 credits Master of Arts 6 credits Master of Arts in Christian Education Accelerated 2 credits Certificate Programs 2 credits\n\nCourses include a syllabus in a PDF format which provides a broad outline of the lectures, review questions and a bibliography. Requirements for credit include textbook assignments, collateral reading, research papers and examinations, all of which are outlined in a programmed syllabus.\n\nRegular tuition fees are charged for each course regardless of the number of credits for which a student is already enrolled and include costs of the MP3 files and programmed syllabus. Students who desire graduate credit for Theological Studies Digital courses must meet the normal requirements for admission to Talbot and register for the courses through my.Account after a signature has been granted by the Dean of Faculty Office.\n\nNote: A maximum of 10 credits may be taken by a student in a combination of independent study, arranged courses, and Theological Studies Digital Courses to be counted toward a student's program.\n\nThesis\n\nA student who is writing a thesis must register in a thesis class each semester until the thesis is completed. (This requirement does not apply to the Master or Arts Theology specialization or to the Master of Arts — Classical Theology.)\n\nTransfer of Credits\n\nFor a student who earned a master's degree at a previous accredited school or approved non-accredited school1, up to 50% of the credits of coursework with similar content may be shared and transferred toward another Master of Arts or Master of Divinity Talbot degree. For a student who did not complete a master's level degree at the previous school, all appropriate comparable course credits may be transferred (or fulfilled through Advanced Standing); however, a minimum of 24 credits of the Master of Arts or Master of Divinity degree requirement must be completed at Talbot. Up to 50% of a Talbot master’s degree may be satisfied by coursework transferred to Talbot (at least 50% of Talbot’s master's degree requirements must be taken at Talbot). All transferred coursework must be appropriate for the degree.\n\nTransfer credit for acceptable work done in other graduate schools will be allowed for courses which are parallel to those required in the curriculum. Applicants who submit applications received by the application deadline will be provided with transfer credit decisions at the point of acceptance. Transfer credit for late applications will be accomplished during the first semester of study. Graduate courses with grades of C or above (a C- is not transferable) at accredited institutions or approved non-accredited institutions1 are accepted for transfer.\n\nMultiple Degrees\n\nThe programs in Talbot School of Theology are accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). ATS requires that shared credits between degrees may not exceed two-thirds of the degree receiving those credits. Additional master’s degrees from Talbot require a minimum of 18 unique credits (i.e., the higher credit program plus 18 credits).\n\nAdvanced Standing\n\nAdvanced Standing is available for Master's level degree programs. Advanced standing should be processed and granted no later than the conclusion of the first semester in order to confirm transfer credit and remaining degree requirements.\n\nAdvanced Standing for Professional Master's Degrees\n\n(Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Christian Ministry and Leadership, and Master of Arts in Spiritual Formation and Soul Care).\n\nAccepted/admitted applicants who have taken undergraduate courses in biblical or theological studies (or psychology for the Master of Arts in Spiritual Formation and Soul Care) may request to earn Advanced Standing credit through prior learning assessment (PLA) based on their collegiate work. The collegiate work must have been completed at an accredited or approved non-accredited institution.1 Granting advanced standing credit requires faculty approval based on competency of course learning outcomes as evidenced through a PLA portfolio or challenge exam.\n\nProof of competency in the subject area or evidence of how the course content has been used since taking the course is required. An evaluation will be made by the faculty and credits processed through the Office of the Registrar. To be considered, the student must have earned at least a B grade in the coursework being evaluated.\n\nThe maximum number of credits that may be received as advanced standing are as follows:\n\nMaster of Divinity: 24 credits\n\nChristian Ministry and Leadership: 15 credits\n\nChristian Ministry and Leadership in Pastoral Care and Counseling: 15 credits\n\nChristian Ministry and Leadership in Preaching and Pastoral Ministry: 18 credits\n\nSpiritual Formation and Soul Care: 12 credits\n\nAdvanced Standing for Academic Master's Degrees\n\nEligible students coming from accredited Bible colleges, Christian liberal arts colleges, or approved non-accredited institutions1 may request exemption from certain required courses. Normally, advanced standing requires two undergraduate courses, in the same discipline, to reduce one graduate course (6 credits undergraduate work for 3 credits of graduate work) for a limited amount of graduate credit. To qualify for advanced standing, the student must have earned a B grade in eligible coursework and provide evidence of competency of course learning outcomes through PLA portfolio or challenge exam. Once the student has been accepted into the degree program, an evaluation, following guidelines established by the faculty, will be made by the Office of the Registrar.\n\nDepending on undergraduate coursework as it relates to the program specialization, the maximum number of credits that may be awarded as advanced standing are as follows:\n\nM.A. Specializations: Bible Exposition, Old Testament, New Testament, Theology, Philosophy and Spiritual Formation: 15 credits\n\nM.A. Apologetics: 12 credits (This is a 39 credit hour degree.)\n\nM.A. Science and Religion: 12 credits (This is a 39 credit hour degree.)\n\nAdvanced Standing for Accelerated Master's Degrees\n\n(Master of Divinity, Master of Arts Specializations: Bible Exposition, Biblical and Pastoral Ministry, Ministry and Leadership, New Testament, Old Testament, Pastoral Care and Counseling, Philosophy, Theology)\n\nAdvanced Standing will be given to those students who earn a B or better in Biola’s undergraduate courses, per the chart below. Biola has determined that a grade of B or better in undergraduate coursework is equivalent to that required by the graduate program. We have made this determination based on an extensive analysis of the differences between the undergraduate and graduate courses by the director of the Accelerated Masters Programs in the 2021-22 school year. As a result of this analysis, we have used graduate level papers and rubrics in these undergraduate courses in order to show equivalency. Because we have used appropriate means of assessment that students have the knowledge, competence, and/or skills that would normally be provided by the graduate level courses, we have determined that they may receive advanced standing with a grade of B or better.\n\nTorrey Honors students will receive advanced standing for doing the Torrey Honors Program per the chart below, upon completion of the entire Torrey program. Torrey students will show graduate equivalency for OT/NT Survey through taking Biola’s undergraduate OT/NT Challenge exams.\n\nAdvanced Standing Courses\n\nAdvanced Standing Biola BBST & CEED Undergraduate Courses Corresponding Talbot Graduate Course(s) Applies to which Biola Undergraduates Graduate Credits Reduced BBST 312 & upper-division BBST course (6 cr) TTBE 517 Hermeneutics All Biola Bible majors 3 BBST 165, 251, 354, and 413 or 414 (12 cr) TTTH 521 & TTTH 522 Theology I & II All Biola Bible majors 6 BBST 165, 251, and 354 (9 cr) TTTH 522 Theology II Most Biola students 3 BBST 321 & BBST 300/400 (6 cr) TTHT 514 Historical Theology All Biola Bible majors 3 BBST 450 Apologetics & BBST 300/400 (6 cr) TTPH 602 Apologetics Some Biola Bible majors 3 BLGR 101 & BLGR 102 Elem Greek Grammar I & II (6 cr) TTNT 501 & TTNT 502 Greek I & II Most Biola Bible majors 6 BLHE 101 & BLHE 102 Elem Hebrew Grammar I & II (6 cr) TTOT 603 & TTOT 604 Hebrew I & II Some Biola Bible majors 6 BLGR 201 & BLGR 202 Greek Exegesis I & II (6 cr) TTNT 503 Intro to Greek Exegesis Most Biola Bible majors 3 BLHE 201 Hebrew Exegesis I (3 cr) TTOT 703 Intro to Hebrew Exegesis Some Biola Bible majors 3 CEED 242 & CEED 330 (6 cr) TTPT 609 Expository Preaching CM and BT concentration 3 CEED 255 & CEED 313 (6 cr) TTPT 510 Evangelism & Disciple-making Strategies CM concentration 3 CEED 312 & CEED 300/400 (6 cr) TTPT 602 Pastoral Ministry CM concentration 3 CEED 326 & CEED 300/400 (6 cr) TTPT 707 Foundations of PCC CM concentration 2 Other BBST 209, grade of C or higher Meets OT Survey prerequisite (most Talbot degrees) Most Biola students 0 BBST 209, grade of B or higher & upper-division OT elective TTBE 519 (for MA SF, MA SFSC) Most Biola students 3 BBST 210, grade of C or higher Meets NT Survey prerequisite (most Talbot degrees) Most Biola students 0 BBST 210, grade of B or higher & upper-division NT elective TTBE 520 (for MA SF, MA SFSC) Most Biola students 3 General Bible requirements (per 3 cr) General electives (e.g., TTOT, NT, BE, graduate general elective credits taken in other schools within Biola University)1 Most Biola students 1.5 Upper-division BBST electives (per 3 cr) General electives (e.g., TTOT, NT, BE, graduate general elective credits taken in other schools within Biola University)1 Biola Bible majors 2 Torrey Honors Students Torrey program & BBST 312 TTBE 517 Hermeneutics Torrey Bible majors 3 Torrey program TTTH 522 Theology II Torrey students 3 Torrey program & BBST 413 or 414 TTTH 521 & TTTH 522 Theology I & II Torrey Bible majors 6 Torrey program TTHT 505 Patristic & Medieval Theo Torrey students 3 Torrey program & NT Challenge Exam Must take and pass with a 70% or better Biola’s NT Challenge exam to meet the NT Survey MA requirement Torrey students 3 Torrey program & OT Challenge Exam Must take and pass with a 70% or better Biola’s OT Challenge exam to meet the OT Survey MA requirement Torrey students 3\n\nBiblical Languages Qualifying Examinations\n\nUpon request, students may take qualifying examinations to test out of beginning biblical language courses.
