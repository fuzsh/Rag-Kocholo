        "meta_description": "Biogeochemical processes mediated by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria such as Shewanella oneidensis have the potential to influence the post-closure evolution of a geological disposal facility for radioactive wastes and to affect the solubility of some radionuclides. Furthermore, their potential to reduce both Fe(III) and radionuclides can be harnessed for the bioremediation of radionuclide-contaminated land. As some such sites are likely to have significant radiation fluxes, there is a need to characterise the impact of radiation stress on such microorganisms. There have, however, been few global cell analyses on the impact of ionizing radiation on subsurface bacteria, so here we address the metabolic response of S. oneidensis MR-1 to acute doses of X-radiation. UV/Vis spectroscopy and CFU counts showed that although X-radiation decreased initial viability and extended the lag phase of batch cultures, final biomass yields remained unchanged. FT-IR spectroscopy of whole cells indicated an increase in lipid associated vibrations and decreases in vibrations tentatively assigned to nucleic acids, phosphate, saccharides and amines. MALDI-TOF-MS detected an increase in total protein expression in cultures exposed to 12 Gy. At 95 Gy, a decrease in total protein levels was generally observed, although an increase in a putative cold shock protein was observed, which may be related to the radiation stress response of this organism. Multivariate statistical analyses applied to these FT-IR and MALDI-TOF-MS spectral data suggested that an irradiated phenotype developed throughout subsequent generations. This study suggests that significant alteration to the metabolism of S. oneidensis MR-1 is incurred as a result of X-irradiation and that dose dependent changes to specific biomolecules characterise this response. Irradiated S. oneidensis also displayed enhanced levels of poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction, though the mechanism underpinning this phenomenon is unclear.",

        "text": "Post irradiation metabolism\n\nTo assess the impact of radiation on the metabolism of S. oneidensis, samples were collected from control and irradiated cultures immediately after irradiation (lag phase), at mid exponential phase and at stationary phase and were analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectra of control and irradiated cultures (12 to 95 Gy) were typical of metabolic fingerprints reported previously for S. oneidensis (S2 Fig) [31]. Inspection of these data by eye is limited as the spectra are qualitatively very similar. Therefore, to observe overall trends in the data and assess the importance of both dose and growth phase on the phenotype of irradiated cultures, PC-DFA was performed on FT-IR data from all growth phases for each separate dose. The Euclidean distances between the cluster centres of control and irradiated samples at each growth phase were measured and are shown in Fig 2. This showed that separation between control and irradiated sample clusters was greatest for lag phase cultures at all doses. Euclidean cluster distances decreased for all further growth phases with a slight increase in distance between the control and irradiated clusters of stationary phase cultures for some doses (12 and 72 Gy). This suggests that changes to the metabolic fingerprint of irradiated cultures are greatest during the lag phase, before the cells have time to recover.\n\nEuclidean distances between cluster centres of control and irradiated sample discriminant function scores extracted during principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) applied to (A) FT-IR spectra and (B) MALDI mass spectra of lag, exponential and stationary phase X-irradiated and control cultures. Principal components 1 to 5 (FT-IR) and 1 to 30 (MALDI-MS) were used by the DFA algorithm with a priori knowledge of machine replicates, i.e. 1 class per sample point and treatment, giving 6 classes in total for each dose.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131249.g002\n\nPLS regression was employed to assess further the importance of dose on the metabolism of cultures in later growth phases and to determine whether an irradiated phenotype developed. PLS analysis is a supervised classification technique whereby a statistical model was supplied with information about the treatment of each sample (i.e. control or irradiated). PLS was performed on the data from all doses and the principal component scores of the lag phase data are shown (Fig 3). At doses of 12, 24, and 48 Gy, the samples of control and irradiated lag phase cultures did not display a strong degree of clustering and separation between control and irradiated samples was not observed. For samples exposed to 72 Gy and 95 Gy of X-radiation on the other hand, there was evidence of separation between control and irradiated samples, suggesting that at higher doses, there is a pronounced metabolic response to radiation. As increased energy flux at higher doses increases the frequency of ionization and damage events (both directly, via energy deposition into biomolecules, and indirectly, via the production of reactive species by water radiolysis), such dose dependent perturbation of metabolism would be expected. However, the validation plots shown in S3 Fig indicate that for all doses, except 48 Gy and 72 Gy, the R2 values of the test samples are much lower than the model training samples, even when the number of principal components used in the model was increased. When viewed in the context of the PC-DFA data, this suggests that the changes to metabolism at lag phase may be significant but are not necessarily predictable. This is perhaps not surprising as radiation damage is indiscriminate and damage may be inflicted to a large array of cellular targets.\n\nScores for the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) extracted during partial least squares regression analysis performed on FT-IR data of control and X-irradiated cultures at lag phase. Solid black circles represent control samples and crosses represent irradiated samples. The nine replicates from each treatment are formed from three experimental replicates from each biological replicate.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131249.g003\n\nTo assess how the recovery time after irradiation (i.e. growth phase) affected the metabolic fingerprints of cultures further, PLS was also performed on the FT-IR data from exponential and stationary phase samples. Similar to the lag phase cultures, separation between samples from control and irradiated exponential phase cultures was only observed after 72 and 95 Gy (S4 Fig). This response was not as marked as for the lag phase cultures, and again, this is somewhat reflected in the validation plots of S4 Fig. On the other hand, samples from stationary phase cultures showed a stronger degree of clustering and separation of these clusters based on their treatment (control or irradiated). Again, this effect was most evident for cultures treated with 48, 72 and 95 Gy (S5 Fig) and the ability of the PLS model to predict sample classification was best for cultures treated with 24, 72 and 95 Gy.\n\nThese observations suggest that the irradiated phenotype was preserved throughout subsequent generations of the culture despite irradiated cultures showing recovery of biomass to the same levels as non-irradiated controls (Fig 1A). Significant alteration to the regulation of a variety of genes (including metabolism related genes) measured throughout a 1 h recovery period of S. oneidensis exposed to 40 Gy irradiation has been reported previously [23]. Thus, changes to the metabolism of S. oneidensis in exponential and stationary phases observed in this study may be related to radiation induced gene regulation. Furthermore, these results suggest that such effects may be maintained throughout several doublings of the population.\n\nDose related phenotypes estimated from FT-IR spectra\n\nLoadings vectors extracted during PCA and PLS analysis of IR spectra of lag phase cultures immediately after irradiation (Fig 4 and S6 Fig) highlight regions which may contribute to the separation of treated and control cultures observed in scores plots. To investigate this further, peak intensities in these regions were calculated in order to assess radiation induced changes to key molecules, which may have contributed to observed growth effects in later populations.\n\nLoadings vectors for the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) extracted during PCA applied to FT-IR spectra of lag phase cultures of S. oneidensis. Top: PCA was performed on spectra from all dose treatments (and their batch controls). PC1 = 82.2% total explained variance (TEV), PC2 = 9.0% TEV. Middle: PCA performed on spectra from 12 Gy treated cultures and batch controls. PC1 = 50.7% TEV, PC2 = 21.8% TEV. Bottom: PCA performed on spectra from 95 Gy treated cultures and batch controls. PC1 = 80.0% TEV, PC2 = 14.2% TEV.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131249.g004\n\nThe region from 860 to 980 cm-1 was highlighted when the loadings for PCs, extracted during PCA and PLS analysis of all dose treatments, were plotted against IR wavenumber, and also from PCA applied to 12 Gy and 95 Gy treatments individually (Fig 4 and S6 Fig). This mixed spectral region has previously been assigned to carboxylic acids (941 to 950 cm-1) and nucleic acid related vibrations (866 to 963 cm-1) [31]. Three individual peaks within this region can be observed in the IR spectra: 915, 940 and 966 cm-1 (data not shown). The peak at 915 cm-1 had the greatest intensity in this region of loading plots, with the peak at 940 cm-1 appearing as a peak shoulder and the peak at 966 cm-1 not appearing at all. This suggests that wavenumbers at the lower end of this region contributed most during PCA and PLS analysis, supporting our hypothesis that changes in nucleic acid levels most likely led to this region being highlighted. Peak intensities measured at 915 cm-1 indicated that treatment with X-radiation led to a decrease in absorbance at all doses, except at 24 Gy, which showed no change (p = 0.973; n = 9). 12 Gy led to a decrease of 12% (p = 0.002; n = 9) whilst 95 Gy led to a decrease of 17.5% (p = 0.005; n = 9). This observation is potentially a result of radiation damage to nucleic acids, however, previous studies have indicated that whilst approximately 80% of S. oneidensis cells are killed by 40 Gy gamma radiation, this dose yields less than 1 DNA double strand break per genome [22]. As such, it is perhaps more likely that our observation is due to limited levels of nucleic acid synthesis (i.e. mRNA levels that would be associated with a growing population) in irradiated cultures as a result of radiation stress. In either case, the result is likely associated with the reduction in viability of irradiated cultures and the dose dependent increase in lag phase duration.\n\nLoadings plots also revealed changes to regions associated with lipid related vibrations. A dose dependent increase in the CH2/CH3 asymmetric stretch intensity (2885 to 2945 cm−1) was observed after irradiation and was significant at doses of 48, 72 and 95 Gy (p < 1×10−5; n = 9). Similarly, increases in the aliphatic CH vibration (2949 and 2993 cm−1) were also observed after irradiation and showed dose dependence above 24 Gy (p < 0.003 for 48, 72 and 95 Gy; n = 9). Significant oxidation of membrane lipids via addition of hydroxyl radicals may result from radiolysis of fatty acids [53]. Furthermore, these oxidation reactions may occur with the various carbon moieties in the fatty acid chains and thus, changes to the CHx levels may be related to hydrogen abstraction [27]. However, an increase in all three of these bond groups would unlikely be generated by oxidation reactions. Thus, these changes may not be related to specific damage processes but rather to an increase in lipid metabolism throughout irradiation, although in a previous study, genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism were down regulated in S. oneidensis as a result of radiation [23]. Whilst the exact reason for our observations remains unclear, as these functional groups are associated with membrane phospholipids, such radiation induced increases could potentially alter membrane composition, which would in turn play an important role in maintaining membrane function and fluidity [27].\n\nThe region with the largest magnitude in loadings plots (Fig 4 and S6 Fig) comprises three peaks: a main peak at 1110 cm-1, a peak at 1150 cm-1 and a peak shoulder at 1082 cm-1, visible in the loadings plot for 95 Gy treated cultures. Visual inspection of the IR spectra confirm the presence of these three peaks. In order to quantify changes to this spectral region, the area under the curve was computed for the region 988 to 1187 cm-1. A decrease in peak area was observed after irradiation with all doses, except 24 Gy, and was particularly significant after 12, 72 and 95 Gy (p < 0.02; n = 9). This decrease exhibited dose dependence above 48 Gy. The highest peak intensities for this region revealed a decrease after treatment with all doses and by as much as much as 17% and 24% in cultures irradiated with 48 and 95 Gy, respectively (p < 0.001 for both doses; n = 9).\n\nAbsorbance in this region has previously been attributed to phosphate (1037 to 1182 cm−1), namely the symmetric PO2− stretch from nucleic acids, with an approximate maxima at 1106 cm−1 [31,54]. A decrease in nucleic acid-associated phosphate vibrations in this IR region is in good agreement with our previous observation of a decrease in the absorption in the region of 860 to 980 cm−1 and supports our hypothesis of radiation damage to nucleic acids and/or limited levels of nucleic acid synthesis due to radiation stress.\n\nIn addition, absorbance in the region 900 to 1200 cm−1 has also been assigned to saccharides, namely the C-O vibration [31,55–57]. Thus, a decrease in absorbance in this region of the IR spectra of irradiated cultures may also be attributable to lower levels of saccharides. As with nucleic acids, it is possible that this may be a result of radiation damage, or may equally be a result of decreased saccharide metabolism. Indeed, this observation may also be directly associated with the reduction in absorbance from nucleic acid associated vibrations, i.e. due to the presence of ribose in the phosphate-sugar backbone of nucleic acids. For instance, •OH is known to abstract hydrogen from deoxyribose, which may lead to opening up of the of the sugar ring [58,59].\n\nThe C-N stretch of amines also absorbs in the region 1088 to 1096 cm−1 [60]. Amine groups have been shown to incur reaction with oxygen free radicals generated during radiolysis, with oxidation leading to the formation of α-ketoacids, aldehydes or carboxylic acids [61]. In all these mechanisms, loss of the amine group was observed and this may account for the observed decrease in absorbance at this region. Furthermore, carboxyl groups also absorb in a similar IR region [62] and this amino acid moiety has also been shown to be susceptible to free radical mediated oxidation [63]. These reactions may be related to extensive protein oxidation observed in S. oneidensis [21] and as this can modify the redox potential of the cell, these results may have implications to downstream metabolism as well as reduced protein turnover [61,63].\n\nIt is challenging to resolve the contribution of each of these bonds to the peak areas observed in this spectral range of the loadings plots (988 to 1187 cm-1) and thus constrain which bond or bonds are most susceptible to radiation induced changes. However, given the emergence of three peaks in this spectral range of the loadings plots, it is possible that radiation induced decreases in all three bonds are contributing to this region of the spectra.\n\nThe loadings plots of Fig 4 and S6 Fig also highlighted two peaks in the region 1479 to 1775 cm−1 that can be assigned to amide I and II. The mean peak areas of this region in IR spectra show a decrease after treatment with 72 and 95 Gy, however, t-tests suggest that this decrease is not statistically significant. Despite this, the emergence of these peaks in the loadings plots suggests that variance in this region between treatments contributed significantly during PCA and PLS regression.\n\nA peak at 1236 cm−1 is also highlighted in the loadings from PCA and PLS. Moreover, inspection of mean IR spectra indicated that a peak in the range 1236 to 1240 cm−1 showed a dose dependent decrease after irradiation. The P = O of phosphate (1240 cm−1) [56] and the asymmetric stretch of both PO2− (1200 to 1270 cm−1) and PO32− (1235 cm−1) [31] all absorb in this region. These bands are characteristic of nucleic acids and phospholipids and hence, decreases in absorbance in this region support our earlier hypotheses of radiation induced alteration to nucleic acid and fatty acid levels, the latter with implications to membrane composition. In addition, the presence of absorption bands of amide (1188 to 1265 cm−1; amide III) [31] and amine (1240 cm−1; C-N stretching) [60] in this region also supports our previous hypothesis regarding radiation damage and/or radiation induced alteration to protein metabolism. However, though a distinct peak appears in the loading plots, the relatively small magnitude of this peak (loading value) likely provides only a small contribution to PC scores and the separation of samples observed in PLS analysis and PC-DFA distance plots.\n\nCollectively, these observations of changes in protein and amine related vibrations may be indicative of radiation damage to proteins or may suggest differences in protein metabolism immediately after irradiation. In conjunction with the tentative assignment of the region 988 to 1187 cm−1 to saccharides, these data may suggest that, alongside radiation damage to specific biomolecules, saccharide and protein turnover was perturbed, possibly due to irradiated cultures switching to alternative metabolic substrates as they attempt recovery. Indeed, these protein and saccharide substrates may be derived from dead cells, released during cell lysis. Alteration to the metabolism of these molecules, along with nucleic acid and fatty acid metabolism, is likely responsible for the observed growth effects and the phenotypic differences between irradiated and control cultures in subsequent generations, as discussed earlier.\n\nRadiation induced changes to proteins\n\nIn order to examine further the potential influence of radiation on proteins of S. oneidensis revealed by FT-IR spectra and to determine whether ionizing radiation targets specific proteins, whole cell samples were analysed using MALDI-TOF-MS. Mass spectra of irradiated samples (12 and 95 Gy) and batch controls are shown in Fig 5 and peaks which appeared discriminant in subtraction spectra (S7 Fig) are highlighted. Annotations of peaks are documented in Table 1 along with tentative assignments to proteins.\n\nMean MALDI-MS spectra of S. oneidensis MR-1 exposed to (A) 12 Gy X-radiation and (B) 95 Gy X-radiation. Spectra have been offset in the y-axis so that spectral features are clearly visible. Asterisks (*) show mass peaks in irradiated spectra that are discriminant with respect to batch controls, as observed in difference spectra (mean irradiated spectrum minus mean control spectrum) (S7 Fig). The mass range has been limited in the figure to only include peaks which are discriminant and to which tentative annotations can be assigned, displayed in Table 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131249.g005\n\nMany of the proteins are predicted from the S. oneidensis genome [64], and thus, do not take into account mass variability arising during translation and from processes such as post translational modification, although the latter effect is likely minimal in a bacterium. Indeed, it is also possible that radiation may modify the protein mass via fragmentation, as a result of peptide bond cleavage [61,63,65] and by ionization, which may generate subtle variations in the molecular mass. Hence, although Table 1 indicates the mass range in which the maximum peak intensities of each sample were observed, care is needed when discussing these results with regard to protein identification.\n\nSamples exposed to 12 Gy X-radiation generally displayed peaks with a greater intensity than respective controls (S7 Fig and Table 1). These increases in protein levels as a result of irradiation may be related to the up-regulation of genes associated with amino acid transport and metabolism, and protein turnover, post translational modification and chaperones [23]. Up-regulation of proteins has also been observed in irradiated D. radiodurans, of which, some had functions related to protein turnover [66].\n\nIn addition to peak analysis, PC-DFA was applied to the data in order to assess dose dependent changes and establish whether differences in the proteome were maintained throughout growth. Euclidean PC-DFA distances show that at low dose (12 Gy), separation between control and irradiated clusters was greatest immediately after irradiation and decreasing with growth phase (Fig 2). These data suggest recovery of cultures from low dose irradiation and the up-regulation of proteins at lag phase may be related to this recovery. However, whilst a strong response of genes related to DNA repair, oxidative stress and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species has been observed during transcriptomic analysis of S. oneidensis recovering from irradiation [23], Table 1 indicates that up-regulated proteins do not appear to be related to repair mechanisms. Of the proteins that showed a change in concentration, most were unfortunately uncharacterised. An increase in a possible protein which is encoded in the S. oneidensis lambda phage was observed and this is supported by previous observations of the expression of phage genes after exposure to UV and ionizing radiation [23,67]. Indeed, the induction of phage genes and the subsequent prophage lytic cycle has been inferred to contribute to the sensitivity of this organism to ionizing radiation [23]. In addition, a putative carbon storage regulator homolog (CsrA) was observed to increase (p < 0.05, n = 9), along with a potential 50S ribosomal protein L29 (RpmC) (p < 0.05, n = 9). The reason for this response is unclear, though it may be related to a general response in metabolism and protein turnover [23] and these changes may contribute to the recovery of cultures at lower doses.\n\nCultures exposed to 95 Gy X-radiation showed a reduction in the levels of most detectable proteins (Fig 5, S7 Fig and Table 1), with respect to control treatments. Peaks at 7366, 7393 and 8903 Da showed a decrease as a result of radiation; however, the functions of predicted proteins at these masses are uncharacterised. This may be the result of down regulation of genes related to protein metabolism [23], however, at this higher dose, it is perhaps more likely a result of protein damage arising from reactions such as oxidation and carbonylation [21,25]. In contrast to the reduction observed in most proteins after 95 Gy irradiation, increased levels of a possible protein at 7406 Da was observed. This mass can be tentatively assigned to a cold shock protein (Csp family) or a sulfur carrier protein (ThiS). Cold shock proteins may serve as RNA chaperones and gene regulators and have various physiological roles in response to a variety of stresses [68,69]. The up-regulation of this protein may be a reaction to cellular radiation stress which may share physiological triggers with cold shock. In addition, cold shock proteins have also been implicated in regulation of membrane fluidity [70] and thus, the up-regulation of this protein could also be related to the increase in lipid related bonds revealed by FT-IR spectra. A protein with mass 7269 Da also increased, which can be tentatively assigned to a predicted protein at Locus SO0886, although its function is currently uncharacterised.\n\nIn contrast to the 12 Gy treatment, the clusters of control and 95 Gy treated samples showed greatest Euclidean PC-DFA distances between stationary phase samples (Fig 2). These data suggest that, whilst the proteome of a 12 Gy treated culture appears to show recovery, at 95 Gy, alteration to the proteome may be preserved, or indeed exacerbated through successive generations of the culture. This response is likely a result of changes in gene expression which may be persistent throughout the exponential growth of cultures irradiated to a high dose. Thus, it is evident that radiation induced changes to the levels of protein in S. oneidensis are dose dependent and this dose dependence also strongly influences the phenotype in latter growth phases."
