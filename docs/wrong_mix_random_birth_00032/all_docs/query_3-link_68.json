        "text": "Ever wonder what the namesake is for a Myrtle Beach road, building or park? Most namesakes honor or memorialize community members for their civic involvement. Other namesakes stem from Myrtle Beach’s military history or natural formations. The city’s collection of namesakes tells the story of our people, growth and progression.\n\n“MYRTLE BEACH”\n\nEarlier names for Myrtle Beach included Long Bay, Withers and New Town. The area was called Long Bay when a hurricane swept through in 1822. It was later known as Withers (hence Withers Swash) for the Withers family, which had owned property in the area since the late 1700s. A Withers post office even opened in 1888. The Burroughs and Collins Company of Conway purchased much of the Withers’ family land in 1881, and the growing community was called New Town at the turn of the century. (Conway was “old town.”) In 1900, a contest was held to give New Town an official name, and Addie Burroughs, widow of Franklin G. Burroughs, suggested “Myrtle Beach” because of the wax myrtle bushes growing abundantly. The second-place suggestion was “Edgewater.” The Withers post office was replaced by the first Myrtle Beach post office in the early 1910s. By the way, no other incorporated cities or towns exist with the name “Myrtle Beach.” There are towns called Myrtle, Myrtle Grove and Myrtle Island, but no other Myrtle Beach exists!\n\n“GRAND STRAND”\n\nThe Grand Strand was coined in 1949 by Claude Dunnagan as the title for a newspaper column about area happenings. The name stuck for the whole region.\n\nBUILDINGS & FACILITIES\n\nAshley Booth Field is named for Ashley Booth, a longtime youth coach and youth sports official for the city’s recreation department. Ashley Booth became even more well known for “Ashley’s Booth” concession stand! Since the booth itself no longer exists, the new youth football field was named “Ashley Booth Field” in his honor. Coach Booth’s sons participated in the city’s recreation programs as children. And, like their father, the sons have served the city as coaches and officials, too.\n\nYou’ll find the Buddy Rogers Memorial Wall located within the Myrtle Beach Sports Center, 2115 Sports Center Way. Myrtle Beach officials unveiled the memorial wall in 2015, honoring the late Buddy Rogers, an outstanding teacher and coach at Myrtle Beach High School. Coach Rogers’ promoted character, integrity and sportsmanship. Coach Rogers' basketball and tennis teams were known state-wide for their outstanding sportsmanship and winning records. He also served as assistant football coach. During his career, the Seahawks' boys and girls tennis teams won a total of 14 state championships. The boys basketball team won the state AAA championship in 2005 with a 30-1 record. Coach Rogers passed away on September 24, 2005, but his legacy lives on with the new memorial at the Myrtle Beach Sports Center. On another wall of the main court area, you’ll see the Buddy L.I.S.T. It stands for Leadership, Integrity, Sportsmanship and Teamwork. The Sports Center hosts thousands of athletes each year in tournament competition, and the Buddy Rogers Memorial Wall sets the tone for good sportsmanship, both on and off the court.\n\nChapin Memorial Library, 400 14th Avenue North, is the only city-owned library in South Carolina. The public library opened in 1939 at a location on North Kings Highway with 501 books. During World War II, the library relocated to the Chapin Company building as part of the government recreation program for soldiers. In August 1948, the Chapin Foundation provided $40,000 for a library on city park land and an additional $2,000 for landscaping. Chapin Memorial Library opened on June 1, 1949, on the corner of Kings Highway and 14th Avenue North. The facility has been expanded four times.\n\nCharlie's Place is named for the former property owner and Myrtle Beach resident, Mr. Charlie Fitzgerald. From the late 1930s to the early 1960s, Charlie’s Place was a Myrtle Beach nightspot operated by Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife, Sarah. The nightclub was on Carver Street in the Booker T. Washington Neighborhood, next door to their home and a small hotel they operated. Early Motown performers brought their music to Charlie’s Place in the days before integration. It provided a place for African-American artists of the day to perform, including Dizzy Gillespie, Little Richard, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and many others.\n\nCrabtree Memorial Gymnasium is named for the late Clement Gurley Crabtree, a longtime recreation director at the former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. Born in 1918, Crabtree attended Wake Forest University (then college) and played professional football for Detroit in the NFL during the 1940 and 1941 seasons.\n\nDoug Shaw Memorial Stadium, home of the Myrtle Beach Seahawks, was re-named for long-time Myrtle Beach High School football coach Doug Shaw, who died suddenly November 11, 1994, at age 52. The football stadium was built in 1968 on city-owned land behind Pepper Geddings Recreation Center and given to the city. A $200,000 community fund-raising effort for the new stadium was prompted by a bleacher collapse at the high school field then in use near Oak Street and 12th Avenue North. Originally, the new football field was simply named Memorial Stadium, but on September 12, 1995, City Council approved a resolution renaming the facility in Doug Shaw's memory. Shaw had been Myrtle Beach's head football coach for 25 years and an assistant coach the two previous years. His football teams had a record of 223 wins, 77 losses and two ties. They won four state championships and 16 conference titles and competed in the playoffs 23 of his 25 years. As one of South Carolina's greatest and most loved coaches, his death was front-page news across the state. Today, Doug Shaw Memorial Stadium is jointly owned by Myrtle Beach and the Horry County school district.\n\nGeneral Robert H. Reed Recreation Center (formerly Base Recreation Center) was renamed in 2018 in memory of General Robert H. Reed. Reed was the city’s appointee to the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Authority upon its inception and was instrumental in the base’s transformation into the Market Common district. He worked tirelessly to preserve and maintain the history of the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base (U.S. Air Force closed the base in 1993) and its personnel, both military and civilian, through various projects, including: Valor Memorial Garden, Warbird Park and more than 160 historical markers. The four-star Air Force general made Myrtle Beach his home when he retired after 36 years of service.\n\nThe Jake Abraham Transfer Station, the City of Myrtle Beach's solid waste and recycling facility, is named in memory of a long-time city employee. Following military service during World War II, Jake Abraham came home to Myrtle Beach. He found employment with the city and served our residents and businesses from 1947 to 1986. As a solid waste collection operator, he was well-known in the community during those 39 years. “Mr. Jake,” as he was called, died in 2011 at age 91.\n\nJames C. Benton Miracle League Field, 690 33rdAvenue North, serves as the host of the Grand Strand Miracle Leagues’ events. Founded in 2001, Grand Strand Miracle Leagues is an organization fueled by generous and passionate community support. The ADA approved, adapted baseball field was constructed featuring a rubberized field surface that suits wheelchairs and walkers. The field is named for the late James Carson Benton, the former Board of Directors’ Chair of the Grand Strand Miracle Leagues organization. He was a Myrtle Beach High School graduate and served in the United States Navy. Benton graciously donated his time and funds to many charitable causes in the Myrtle Beach community and was well-known as a caring neighbor and successful businessman.\n\nThe John T. Rhodes Myrtle Beach Sports Center is named after three-term Myrtle Beach Mayor John Rhodes, who passed away from COVID-19 in early 2021. Rhodes served as mayor from January 2006 to January 2018. During his tenure, the city built the Myrtle Beach Sports Center, Grand Park Athletic Complex, Myrtle Beach Boardwalk and, dearest to his heart, Savannah’s Playground, for which he personally raised more than $1 million. As executive director of the Beach Ball Classic for 40 years and a member of the McDonald’s All-American Selection Committee, Rhodes was one of the earliest proponents of “sports tourism” in Myrtle Beach. Future basketball stars emerged from this national high school holiday tournament. John came to Myrtle Beach as a teen and never left. He worked as a beach lifeguard in his youth before beginning a successful career in restaurant and hotel management. Well-known for supporting our youth and our tourism industry, Rhodes received an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Coastal Carolina University, his alma mater, in 2020. The new sign for the John T. Rhodes Myrtle Beach Sports Center was unveiled April 3, 2021, which would have been his 78th birthday.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Colored School served African-American students in the Myrtle Beach area for more than 20 years. Now, a new Historic Myrtle Beach Colored School Museum and Education Center provides a window on that past, as well as a door to the future for all. Thanks to leadership from the City of Myrtle Beach, vision from former students and a partnership among public and private entities, the old school has been preserved in spirit and recreated in fact and continues to fulfill an educational mission. The original four-room, wood-framed Myrtle Beach Colored School opened in 1932 as a product of segregated times. Previously, African-American students were educated in local churches, since they could not attend the official “white” schools. Having a school to call their own was a great advancement and source of pride, and the Myrtle Beach Colored School fulfilled a vital role in the African-American community during that period of transition and growth. The need for the Myrtle Beach Colored School was eliminated in 1953 with the opening of Carver Training School. No longer in use, the old schoolhouse served as a warehouse for a while, but eventually languished in the heart of the neighborhoods that it once served and fostered. In 2001, City Council appointed former students, community representatives and other interested parties to a newly created committee charged with the task of saving the school. Unfortunately, as everyone discovered when the old school was surveyed, the building itself could not be saved. With the site of the old school about to be halved by the new road, Burroughs & Chapin Company, Inc., offered to donate a site nearby, less than two blocks away, where a new “old” school could be rebuilt. This land donation, along with City Council’s pledge of construction money, gave the former students hope that their dream might be realized. The former students were adamant about retaining the school’s original name. To them, it had always been the Myrtle Beach Colored School, and they were unconcerned with whether that name might be uncomfortable or politically incorrect. Segregation was wrong, but it happened, and changing the name now was an unthinkable act of revisionist history. The modern-day Historic Myrtle Beach Colored School and Education Center opened its doors in 2006 and continues to serve the community as a museum and education center.\n\nThe Mary C. Canty Recreation Center (formerly Canal Street Recreation Center) was renamed in 2015 in recognition of Ms. Canty’s many contributions and achievements during a lifetime of service. The name memorializes the beloved woman who shaped our city through her civic involvement. The late Mary C. Canty emphasized the importance of youth advocacy. Ms. Canty was instrumental in choosing the Canal Street location, and the facility she helped conceive provides an outlet for recreational activities and civic involvement. Ms. Canty passed away in January 2015 at age 81.\n\nThe Ned Donkle Field Complex is affectionately named for Mr. Ned Donkle, who served as a devoted baseball and football coach for the city’s recreation department in the 1970s. He was a member of the Beachcomber Shriners, a major sponsor of the Myrtle Beach’s youth sports programs at the time. Coach Donkle was an extraordinary mentor to many young people. He treated every team member as “one of his own,” and left a lasting imprint in the memories of countless young people in the community with his energy and words of encouragement.\n\nPepper Geddings Recreation Center is named for Arthur Joseph “Pepper” Geddings, Jr. Nicknamed “Pepper” for his lively, positive personality and his competitive spirit, Geddings took part in city recreation programs for seven years and was well known by all. He graduated from Myrtle Beach High School in 1965 and left for college to continue his love of baseball. Pepper graduated with honors from Wingate Junior College in 1967. Then, during a game between Appalachian State University, where he was a junior, and Wingate, Pepper was accidentally struck by a pitched baseball. He died from the injury at age 20. Myrtle Beach was building a recreation center at the time, and in 1968 the new facility was named in Pepper’s memory.\n\nSavannah’s Playground is named in honor of Miss Savannah Thompson, a young woman who serves as an inspiration to those who have the privilege of meeting her. The award-winning, enabling playground is located behind Crabtree Memorial Gymnasium and was the brainchild of former Myrtle Beach Mayor John Rhodes. The $1.5 million project includes play structures and equipment that are ADA compliant. Funding was received from a variety of sources, including the City of Myrtle Beach, the State of South Carolina, the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Authority and Horry County. Additional expansion projects are currently underway!\n\nThe Ted C. Collins Law Enforcement Center on Oak Street is named for the late Ted C. Collins, who served the city for 20 years, first as a member of City Council and then as a municipal judge. Judge Collins died suddenly December 26, 2000. He served on City Council from 1978 to 1986 and then as a Municipal Court judge from 1988 until his death. City Council named the Law Enforcement Center in Judge Collins’ memory on March 13, 2001. Council’s proclamation reads, in part, “Ted Collins was well known for his compassion, humor, friendliness, warmth and personality.”\n\nPARKS & PLAZAS\n\nAnderson Park on Ocean Boulevard at 20th Avenue North was named for James and Dorothy Anderson. The duo owned the adjacent Camelot Hotel. The Andersons helped build Myrtle Beach into the seaside resort populated town it is today with their lodging facilities. The park was received as part of the open space requirements for the 21stAvenue North Planned Unit Development.\n\nThe Andre S. Pope Mountain Bike Skills Park, 4670 South Kings Highway, is named for Andre S. Pope, a lifelong resident of Horry County and dedicated member of the cycling community. Pope had a desire to support cycling in the community by providing a safe space for all levels of mountain bikers to learn and improve their skill levels and confidence on their bicycles. Pope utilized his talent as a graphic artist, and created (on his own time and at his own expense) a full color glossy brochure showing in graphics and text all that such a park could be. Andre was part of the team that presented the concept of this park to the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Authority. Upon project approval, Andre was instrumental in mapping and clearing the trail, making the mountain bike skills park a reality.\n\nArchibald Rutledge Memorial Park, a mini park located at 224 48thAvenue North, is named for the late South Carolina writer Archibald Rutledge.

He wrote his first poem at age three, attended McClellanville High School and later Porter Academy in Charleston. After receiving a scholarship to Union College in New York, Rutledge later graduated valedictorian in 1904 and became a teacher. He later produced 25 volumes of poetry and 45 volumes of prose. Upon retiring in 1937, Rutledge returned to his plantation home to restore it (now known as Hampton Plantation State Park). In his lifetime, Rutledge received many honors, including more than 20 honorary degrees and more than 30 gold medals. His books have been published around the world. Notably, he won second place in the Pulitzer Contest in poetry on two occasions (Robert Frost and Edna Millay were selected as the winners).\n\nBathsheba Bowens Memorial Park, 840 Nance Street, is named in memory of Miss Beulah Bathsheba Bowens, a Myrtle Beach resident. Born in December 1951, Bowens served as an outstanding role model as a student, tutor, choir singer, church member and community leader. She passed away unexpectedly in February 1968 at 17. The park was made possible by Sandy Grove Baptist Church.\n\nChapin Park, located beside Chapin Memorial Library, was named after Simeon Brooks Chapin. Chapin was a successful banker and broker in Chicago, Illinois, when he acquired several business interests in the Carolinas. In 1911, Chapin first visited Myrtle Beach. Soon after, he joined the Burroughs brothers to form the Myrtle Beach Farms Company, holding an estate of 66,000 acres of land. Chapin embraced the vision that the future of Myrtle Beach offered unlimited potential. Simeon Chapin was known for his philanthropic involvement, later founding the Chapin Foundation.

Gray moved to Myrtle Beach around 1936 at the age of 21 to work on the Intracoastal Waterway. He married Esther Nance in 1940 and started Gray Welding Company in 1945 (later renamed Grayco Steel Company). Philip Gray served on the Myrtle Beach City Council from 1947 to 1953. Gray also served on the Myrtle Beach High School Board of Education from 1950 to 1954. In the 1950s, Philip Gray founded two new companies: Sunco Pool Company and Genco Chemical Company. After Hurricane Hazel’s destructive visit to Myrtle Beach in 1954, the city and Grand Strand experienced tremendous tourism growth. Mr. and Mrs. Philip Gray were avid supporters of the growth of the hospitality industry in Myrtle Beach due to positive economic impact. Philip Gray later served as Chairman of the Organizing Committee for Horry-Georgetown Technical College in 1962.\n\nHolmes B. Springs Park is named for Holmes B. Springs, who was born in 1879 in the Bucksville area of Horry County. His father was the captain of a sailing ship that carried cargo out of Georgetown, South Carolina, and his grandfather served as a blockade-runner during the Civil War (was captured and hung by Union soldiers at Southport, North Carolina). Springs grew up in Georgetown and Pawley’s Island, and was a graduate of Georgetown High School in 1895.

The city acquired Hurl Rocks Park in the 1970s. The original name was Hearl Rock, named for a family from the Socastee area in the late 18th century. Subsequently, the name was changed in 1913 to “Hurl” Rocks by Margaret Ann Klein after purchasing the property. Klein felt the new name more aptly described the wave movements against the rocks. The unique, unusual rock formations have been covered by sand for many years.\n\nThe Marcus and Frankie Smith Memorial Park at 38th Avenue North is named for one of Myrtle Beach's founding couples. J. Marcus Smith was the city's first optometrist, and in his spare time he was a history buff who wrote columns for local newspapers.

A master builder, Daniel Wayne Nance was responsible for many downtown buildings near the modern-day location of the plaza, as well as historic homes built along North Ocean Boulevard. The late Mr. Nance moved to Myrtle Beach from Shallotte, North Carolina, at the age of sixteen. The year was 1909, and he traveled on an ox-driven cart! The late Mrs. Nance’s family owned a large farm and fishery near Withers Swash. The duo together raised ten children while building and operating guest-boarding facilities. Mr. Nance served as a commissioner for “Dogwood Neck Township,” which was included in modern-day Myrtle Beach. He also petitioned at the state capital, alongside 13 other individuals, for the town’s name change to “Myrtle Beach.” The plaza features brick pathways and an animated, lighted water fountain centerpiece.\n\nOcean Forest Memorial Park marks the former site of the former Ocean Forest Hotel, one of the East Coast’s most grand hotels. South Carolina textile visionary John Woodside arrived in Myrtle Beach in 1926. He, alongside his brothers (now known locally as the Woodside brothers), were inspired by Brig. General Holmes B. Springs to build a Riviera-style resort and playground for America’s wealthy. Woodside reportedly paid Myrtle Beach Farms Company a staggering $950,000 for about 66,000 acres of land. Built on the ocean-side surrounded by pines and myrtle bushes lining the shore, the new grand white structure earned the name, “Ocean Forest Hotel.” Nearby, Woodside built a 27-hole golf course designed by Robert White, the first PGA President. The golf course is now known as the Pine Lakes Country Club and Golf Course. The million-dollar hotel’s doors opened on February 21, 1930, four months after the stock market crashed in 1929. Woodside’s vision faded after the crash and onset of the Great Depression, and outside investors later bought the hotel and golf course. Ocean Forest Hotel occupied thirteen acres and was designed by architect Raymond Hood (well-known for designing New York’s popular Rockefeller Center). The hotel stood 29 feet above sea level and featured a 10-story wedding cake tower, with two additional five-story wings. The property included gardens, pools, stables, marble stairways, crystal chandeliers, Greek-style columns, faucets that dispensed both fresh and salt water, 202 ventilated bathrooms, oriental rugs, a grand ballroom and more. Guests lounged ocean-side and dined like royalty. A carpeted double stairway flanked the ground floor entrance. The property changed hands several times over the course of the next few decades. On a Friday morning in 1974, the city lost a piece of heritage when the property was razed by owners due to the high cost of remodeling.\n\nPlyler Park, 1000 North Ocean Boulevard, is named for Justin Whitaker Plyler, an early visionary who loved Myrtle Beach and saw what it could become.
