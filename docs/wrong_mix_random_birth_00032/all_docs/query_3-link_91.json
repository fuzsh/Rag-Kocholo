They require resilience, agility and flexibility in navigating and supporting hybrid workplaces and spaces as they face the new realities of our world. And it’s the people in those organizations that drive knowledge sharing. KMers have risen to the challenge by harnessing innovative strategies, new technology and tools to enable knowledge sharing in our new hybrid working reality as well as our global economic, social and climatic challenges.\n\nThis year’s KMWorld shares stories of innovative breakthroughs and learning experiences from KM practitioners as they steer their organizations into the future. It also considers how KM aligns with the CEO agenda moving forward to deal with the governance and sustainability, SDGs (U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals), political disruptions, COVID-19, workforce staffing issues and workplace changes, and more.\n\nKMWorld 2023 addresses the human and technology factors of collaboration and knowledge augmentation via AI, the sharing and reuse of knowledge with new tools, the human roles that are even more important than the tools and the hybrid workplace shift in traditional organizations. The program's emphasis is on strategic versus operational knowledge—understanding and aligning with the big organizational or community picture and leadership skills driving knowledge adoption and reuse, especially from outside the organization, such as the environmental and sustainability movement.\n\nKMWorld features new creative knowledge sharing tools and techniques as well as human strategies that have an impact on all types of organizations and communities. Join us and take home exciting insights and ideas to apply in your environment or community."
