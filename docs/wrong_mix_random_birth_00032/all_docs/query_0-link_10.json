        "text": "Exciting news from Sotheby's! They recently launched a groundbreaking $500 million art-backed bond, securitising loans against an incredible $2.85 billion worth of artworks, including masterpieces by #Rembrandt, #Warhol, and #Picasso. If you're intrigued by the idea of securitising loans for artworks or other luxury asset classes, you're not alone. My talented colleagues at Addleshaw Goddard â€“ Laura Uberoi, Marcus Collins, Taymour Keen â€“ and I have written a brief note below explaining the essence of art finance, the advantages of securitisation, and key considerations to keep in mind.

Addleshaw Goddard #RealEstate #RealEstateDisputes #RESOLVED\n\nMichael Burry: \"If you are not using leverage, you are not trying\" Somewhat in contrast to his quote, Burry typically uses put options - CDS in 2008 when he bet against the housing market. Puts are a form of leverage but they do not involve high debt levels typically associated with highly levered positions. Managing debt levels and its aspects is vital for our business at SAV, so working with lenders who understand our risk-taking approach and support our growth is essential for us, especially during volatile times. (Not sure what Michael Burry has to do with SAV but I just thought he is fun to mention!) We are pleased to share that we have secured another development facility from Coutts for our Bedford Place scheme. Coutts has been our partner for over five years across multiple schemes and sectors - we value their approach, which aligns with our philosophy when it comes to leverage and risk taking. I want to thank our team and partners for their support to get this loan over the line: Coutts â€“ Mehmet Hassan and Shona Pushpaharan Addleshaw Goddard â€“ Laura Uberoi Freeths - Mathew Stephens DECIMUS FEARON LLP â€“ Wei Jien Yeow The Grade II listed town house hotel will deliver 43 new rooms, with a bespoke bar, garden entertainment space and luxurious interior design inspired by the buildingâ€™s 250 year history. Despite the significant limitations of the buildingâ€™s historic fabric, we have prioritised sustainability by incorporating solar panels, air source heat pumps and a heat recovery system, and are currently on track to achieve BREEAM Excellent. We look forward to inviting you to an opening once the hotel is operational next year! #RealEstate #Development #Investment"
