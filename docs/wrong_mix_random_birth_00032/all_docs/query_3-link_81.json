        "text": "The Enigmatic Miss Nabby\n\nAbigail (Nabby) Adams (1765-1813), the only daughter of John and Abigail Adams was a hard one to figure. By her mid-teens (considered courtin’-age, if not actually marriageable), she was considered a fine looking young woman, well dressed and well mannered. Most people commented on her good sense, combined with a formidable reserve, which tended to keep people at a distance.\n\nEven her mother, a formidable woman herself, recognized Nabby’s “apparent coldness and indifference”, and perhaps almost “wooden” traits. Tainting with faint praise, Abigail commented on Nabby’s prudence and lack of Sensibility. In AA’s time, “Sensibility” connoted more emotional softness of manners.\n\nWhile some sources comment on Nabby’s closeness to her mother, others conclude that the young teenager was happy to escape Abigail’s overwhelming presence whenever she could. When Nabby visited Mercy Warren (on her own), it was noted that she not only enjoyed herself, but was reluctant to return to Braintree. Her visits to her Aunt Mary Cranch also afforded her time away. Some sources claim she missed her brothers John Quincy and Charles dreadfully when they went to Europe with their father; others note that she seldom wrote to them.\n\nAs the older sister to three younger brothers, Nabby, like her mother, was not unaware of the marvelous opportunities destined to fall in her brothers’ laps, and lack of them in her own. She may also have suspected her own lack of intellectual genius, or “curiosity.” She kept most of her thoughts to herself. Definitely enigmatic.\n\nMr. Royall Tyler\n\nRoyall Tyler (1757-1826), was Boston born and raised in a wealthy family, educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University. When his parents died, young Tyler inherited a considerable estate, but gossip had it that he dissipated it substantially while “sowing his wild oats” at Harvard, which may (or not) have included fathering a child with a serving girl.\n\nHe served briefly in the militia during the early days of the Revolutionary War, studied law, passed the Massachusetts Bar, and, as a “reformed rake” with more maturity and purpose, moved to Braintree to open an office and pursue a legal career.\n\nWhen Nabby first heard of the new fellow in town, she warned her cousins Betsy and Lucy Cranch against Tyler’s “artfulness,” since he boarded with the Cranches. Nabby also resolved to avoid him completely, since “our sex cannot be too careful of the characters of the acquaintance we form.”\n\nNaturally Tyler became acquainted with Abigail Adams, ostensibly requesting to borrow some law books. He was invited to call. Attractive, well dressed and mannered, witty and very amiable, he met young Miss Adams, eight years his junior. Notwithstanding her reservations at sixteen, Nabby appears to have been smitten, although she was not easily wooed.\n\nMr. Tyler however, was definitely smitten, and proceeded to call at the Adams home regularly.\n\nAs soon as Mamma Abigail noticed a budding romance, she wrote her husband, (who responded to his daughter’s situation much faster than he did to his wife’s other letters), indicating his displeasure. Despite the pater-familias mindset of his generation, John Adams was sincerely an affectionate and caring parent. His disapproval of Nabby’s “courtship” was partly due to her youth, and partly due to whatever character defamation gossip Abigail included in the letter. He had little faith that a “reformed rake” could mend his ways.\n\nJohn also disapproved of “courting the mother.” Mr. Tyler seems to have enjoyed his conversations with Mrs. Adams – perhaps even more than Nabby’s company. And there is no indication that Nabby was writing to her father, desperately wanting to marry…\n\nMary Cranch, Abigail’s sister (where Tyler was boarding) continued to add indignant aspersions to Tyler’s character, (although his conduct was above reproach in Braintree, and he continued to build his law practice). Interestingly, Abigail, who seldom altered her opinions or resolve, had grown not only to like Mr. Tyler, but had begun to regard him favorably as a potential “relation.”\n\nNevertheless, Abigail, Aunt Mary, Aunt Betsey, John’s aged mother, Abigail’s aged father, and even her uncle Cotton Tufts were all chiming in with opinions on the match!\n\nAbigail was also in the process of planning to join her husband in Europe by this time, and expected to take Nabby with her. Her daughter offered no objection. Europe would be nice, and she would never marry without her father’s consent. John was conflicted about Tyler, but perhaps wavering.\n\nChange of Heart, Change of Mind\n\nBy the time the Adams women sailed for Europe in 1784, an engagement between Nabby (now seventeen) and Tyler was at least tacit, if not actually formalized. The couple had exchanged miniature portraits.\n\nBoth John and Abigail believed that an ocean of separation would either strengthen the bond, or weaken it. Either way, it was a good thing. Again, Nabby said little, but her serious nature had always masked her “Sensibilities.”\n\nJohn was coming around; Abigail was certain that Nabby and Tyler would marry in time. But the letters were few. More letters seem to have been exchanged between Tyler and Abigail, rather than with Nabby. Reports from relatives suggested that his conduct had lapsed.\n\nThen unsettling rumors abounded that Tyler had returned to Boston, living in a boarding house run by a niece-by-marriage to Mary Cranch. Even more rumors abounded that he fathered another child, this time with his landlady. Hmmm.\n\nNabby eventually wrote to end their engagement, which did not seem devastating to either of them. Or to the senior Adamses.\n\nShe was now being courted by Col. William Stephens Smith, former ADC to General Washington and now private secretary to her father. John and Abigail approved, and were pleased to give their blessing. Nabby also seemed pleased, but again left the matter with her parents and fiancée.\n\nAn Ironic Epilogue\n\nNot long before the Adams family returned from Europe, relatives strongly suggested that they required a better house than their little salt box cottage. After all, JA was A-listed for an important position in his fledgling country.\n\nA fine house not far away had recently come on the market, and Abigail had visited there on occasion. She asked her Uncle (via power-of-attorney) to purchase it for them if he believed it was suitable. It was, and it became “Peacefield,” the Adams house for four generations, and “the country’s” to this day.\n\nThe house had previously been owned by Royall Tyler.\n\nSources:\n\nAkers, Charles W. – Abigail Adams: A Revolutionary American Woman – The Library of American Biography – Pearson Longman, 2007\n\nGelles, Edith B. – Abigail and John: Portrait of a Marriage – William Morrow, 2009\n\nLevin, Phyllis Lee – Abigail Adams – St. Martin’s Press, 1987\n\nhttps://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/william-stephens-smith-1755-1816/\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/places.htm\n\nThe Era of Good Feelings\n\nThe Monroe years 1817-25, are commonly referred to as “The Era of Good Feelings,” with fair reason. The country was at peace, following a military and economic misery known as the War of 1812. The Democratic-Republicans were in high political ascendancy; the old Federalist Party was practically moribund, with little political leadership or clout. The country was growing by leaps and bounds, both in land and population. The economy was strong, and anyone who wanted to work could find it easy to find a job – or a piece of cheap land for the taking. Times were good.\n\nAnd James Monroe (1758-31), sometimes considered the last of the Founding Fathers, perhaps more like an older brother, was a man well known to the electorate, and one who came with long list of public offices on his resume.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia, he attended the College of William and Mary just prior to the American Revolution, and served as scout and officer to General George Washington himself. Recuperating from serious wounds, he returned to Virginia to read law with its Governor Thomas Jefferson. Preferring public service to mundane law practice, he held various offices in Virginia’s Legislature plus a couple of terms as its Governor. He served via the Articles of Confederation and was named to the Constitutional Convention, and knew just about everyone who counted.\n\nOnce the USA became officially the USA, served as Virginia’s Senator. President George Washington assigned him to high diplomatic post in Paris. Once Thomas Jefferson became President in 1803, more diplomatic assignments followed. Once James Madison became President in 1809, cabinet positions followed. Monroe was a sure winner in 1816.\n\nThe Distaff Monroes\n\nThe tall Senator serving in then-capital New York, saw and fell in love and married a pretty and petite daughter of a former British soldier (French-Indian War) who stayed in America. In early 1786 when they married, Monroe was twenty-seven. His bride, Elizabeth Kortright, was seventeen. In a difficult to document relationship (they were seldom apart), it appears to have been a happy marriage of more than 40 years, despite her frail health, which modern history believes to include recurrent seizures: epilepsy. Her condition was downplayed. It bore a stigma kept from public knowledge.\n\nTheir first child, a daughter named Eliza, was born within the year.\n\nWhen Eliza was about six or seven, the Monroes were sent to Paris by President George Washington. The French Revolution was already underway, but the upstart USA (who understood Revolution pretty well) needed to maintain diplomatic ties with its former friend and ally – without getting too involved or alienating any other country.\n\nLittle Eliza was placed at the Maison d’education de la Legion de Honneur, run by the aristocratic Henriette Campan, who had been a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette. But the former French Monarchs had been deposed and indeed executed. The “Reign of Terror” was giving way to the Age of Napoleon.\n\nOne of little Eliza’s school chums was Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Josephine, the stunning widow who became Napoleon’s wife. The friendship between the two little girls lasted the rest of their lives. They continued to correspond regularly, and in later years, when Eliza (now Mrs. George Hay) bore her only child, she named her Hortensia. Hortense de Beauharnais (now the wife of Louis Bonaparte) was the Queen Consort of Holland, happy to stand godmother to the daughter of her American friend.\n\nThe imperial connections also colored the image and behavior of both Elizabeth and Eliza Monroe permanently, and both mother and daughter were indelibly stamped with the formality of diplomatic Europe, and maintained those remote “aristocratic airs” permanently.\n\nWhen Monroe became President in 1817, his wife and daughter considered themselves equal in status to the crowned heads in Europe.\n\nPresident Monroe’s Social Headache\n\nUndoubtedly the First Lady’s predecessor Dolley Madison was a social entity unto herself. Confident, sincerely outgoing and accessible to all, she was a hard act to follow. The Monroe mother and daughter had no intention of even making the effort.\n\nFrom the outset, they announced that in the European style, they would neither pay or return calls. Claiming poor health, Elizabeth Monroe generally declined many of her First Lady social duties, allowing “Mrs. Hay” to substitute. It did not set well in the new democracy.\n\nBelieved to be in a contentious marriage with attorney and legislator George Hay, Monroe’s elder daughter had neither charm nor diplomatic skills. Her pretensions and tactless comments alienated much of social Washington, making White House dinners and receptions formal, icy and stag affairs, devoid of society’s matrons.\n\nEven when she arranged her much-younger sister’s wedding (the first Presidential daughter to be married in the White House), Eliza Hay further estranged much of official Washington, limiting the guest list to only family and very close friends. The new couple, Maria Hester and Samuel Gouverneur, were overpowered by the domineering Mrs. Hay, and said to have moved to New York as soon as possible to disassociate themselves from their officious relative and her imperious manners.\n\nOne story about the bickering Hays’ comes from a diary entry of one Egbert Watson… “I do not think I heard them agree on one subject since I am here…I think I heard him tell her today at dinner 3 distinct times “that she talked too much and should talk less.”\n\nLater….\n\nWhen her mother, father and husband all died within a year, Eliza Hay moved to Paris, where she had enjoyed her happiest times. She converted to Catholicism, and became a nun. She did not have to socialize.\n\nSources:\n\nCaroli, Betty Boyd – First Ladies: An Intimate Look at How 38 Women Handled what may be the most Demanding, Unpaid, Unelected Job in America – Oxford University Press, 1995\n\nUnger, Harlow Giles – The Last Founding Father – DeCapo Press, 2009\n\nWead, Doug – All The Presidents’ Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America’s First Families – Atria – 2003\n\nhttps://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/james-monroe\n\nFirst Ladies Never Married to Presidents: Eliza Monroe Hay\n\nSpoiler alert: Abraham Lincoln never met Prince Albert or Queen Victoria….but….\n\nThe Protocol of Nations\n\nIn the earlier days of the country, long before “the hot line” existed, direct communication between heads of state was not considered proper. Written communication (and even most face-to-face conversation) pertaining to diplomatic situations went through the channels of designated intermediaries, i.e. the Secretary of State or ambassador or similar officialdom.\n\nIn addition to the proper channels, protocol was rigid. Who was presented first, who entered first, who sat where, right side vs. left side, etc. Lapses of these formalities could create an international incident.\n\nAbraham Lincoln: New President\n\nAbraham Lincoln’s first months as POTUS in 1861 were fraught with crises upon crises, and most historians (and his contemporaries) believe that AL was perhaps not at his most effective in those early days. Several months passed before he began to grow into his new challenges, which seemed to change daily.\n\nWhen it came to foreign policy, he had little experience, spoke no foreign languages, and his knowledge of the ins-and-outs of diplomacy was still to be learned. For many months he relied on his Secretary of State, William Seward, who had far more expertise in those areas.\n\nPrince Albert: Queen Victoria’s Consort\n\nAlbert, Prince Consort of England, was a German man, a decade younger than the US President, but he had been given a superb classical education and a background of European protocol. Only twenty when he married the Queen of Great Britain, he was obliged by their constitution to remain above all politics. He also grew into his position – that of advisor to the Queen, and counselor to a succession of Prime Ministers, Foreign Secretaries, and similar high ranking officials – of all parties. Most historians concur, that while Albert was not warmly regarded in his adopted country, the populace had come to respect his considered advice, which was usually excellent.\n\nIn personality, the Prince was far more like Jefferson Davis than like Abraham Lincoln. Both were formal in bearing, invariably polite but cool, and generally humorless, narrow and rigid in their ways and opinions.\n\nBut in the early days of the American Civil War, while the British people were very much opposed to slavery (which they had abolished decades earlier), they appreciated Southern manners, and most of all, the benefit of American cotton which had become a mainstay of their textile economy.\n\nThe Southern Plan\n\nJefferson Davis was not a stupid man, and realized from the outset that seceding from the Union to form a “new” country was fraught with problems on many levels: economic, transportation, manufacturing, manpower, etc. Gaining diplomatic recognition would go a long way to alleviate many of those problems.\n\nTo initiate some of those plans, James Murray Mason and John Slidell were sent as envoys to Britain and France to press the Confederacy’s case for diplomatic recognition, and to lobby for financial and military support. Both men were widely respected in the South, with solid credentials in foreign affairs. They were also prepared to run the blockade that the Union had immediately put into effect from Maine through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nCutting to the Chase\n\nIt was a complicated scheme, and Union intelligence was well aware of their intentions, as well as the potential diplomatic dangers. After a convoluted path of embarkation plans and vessels, Mason and Slidell finally boarded the RMS Trent, a British mail packet ship, in Havana. They were bound for St. Thomas, and then to England. Captain Charles Wilkes of the USS San Jacinto immediately gave chase.\n\nAccording to Prince Albert’s diary on November 28, 1861 “An American warship holds up our mail packet Trent on the high seas and boards her, and removes by force four gentlemen from the Southern States, who were to have gone to London and Paris as envoys. They are carried off to New York. General indignation. The Law Officers declare the act as a breach of international law.”\n\nLord John Russell, British Foreign Secretary drafted a bellicose memorandum for the British ambassador in Washington, “threating to recall” our man in Washington.” It was tantamount to a declaration of war. A copy was sent to the Prince Consort.\n\nOn November 30, desperately ill with only two weeks to live, Prince Albert drafted an amended version for the Queen. It was firm, but lacking in the belligerence of the original. He noted that [the Queen] should have liked to have seen the expression of a hope, that the American captain, did not act under instructions, or, if he did that he misapprehended them, that the United States Government must be fully aware that the British Government could not allow its flag to be insulted, and the security of her mail communications to be placed in jeopardy; and Her Majesty’s Government are unwilling to believe that the United States Government intended wantonly to put an insult upon this country…”\n\nWithout knowing it was Prince Albert who suggested this form of response, Abraham Lincoln was like minded in sentiment. Although a relative novice in both foreign relations and maritime law (he would improve with time), he obviously knew it was a definite breach of international law.\n\nSeward and Lincoln\n\nSecretary of State Seward, who was far more knowledgeable in those matters that the President, saw a foreign incident as an opportunity to divert attention and possibly even reunite the country.\n\nLincoln disagreed, claiming “One war at a time.”\n\nBoth men agreed however, that the aggressive Captain of the San Jacinto had exceeded his authority, and in due time, quietly permitted Mason and Slidell to be released. No apology, no explanation. And the British government continued to maintain its neutrality.\n\nLincoln likely never knew that it was Prince Albert who suggested the “plausible out.”\n\nIt was the last memo the Prince ever wrote.\n\nHe died on December 16.\n\nSources:\n\nBough, Richard – Victoria and Albert – St. Martin’s Press, 1996\n\nWhite, Ronald C.

Her education, considered excellent for the time, was via a Moravian finishing school, but cut short by the untimely death of her father.\n\nAt twenty, she married Tennessee lawyer-with-ambition James Knox Polk. Legend says that it was Andrew Jackson himself who suggested that the young politician “look no farther” than Miss Childress when choosing a wife. Legend or fact, it proved to be good advice. The marriage was a happy union.\n\nMrs. Sarah Polk\n\nPartly because of her innate intelligence, and perhaps mostly because the Polk marriage was childless, Sarah became an especially close companion to her politician husband. Few letters exist between them, since they were seldom apart for very long leaving little need to correspond.\n\nWith no family responsibilities at home, little inclination toward traditional domesticity, and her health unimpaired by childbirth, Sarah was free to accompany her Congressman husband to Washington. He was happy for her company. The Congressional social set – men and women – liked her.\n\nSarah the Fashionista\n\nSarah was a good looking woman. She was not tall. (Polk himself was perhaps 5’7”.) But she was well-figured and had intelligent eyes. Her dark hair was arranged in fashionable corkscrew curls, sometimes adorned with feather plumes or other stylish accents. She favored jewel-toned deep colors, like royal blue or rich maroon or emerald green, which accented her dark complexion.\n\nThe low-cut Empire gowns popularized in America by Dolley Madison had long been passe by the mid-1840s when Sarah was First Lady. Necklines were generally higher; sleeves were long. While Sarah was considered impeccably attired, her taste was modest, even in a modest age. The few portraits and photographs of Mrs. Polk depict a well-dressed woman, but far from flashy. She had nothing of the overt glamorous style of Julia Tyler, her young predecessor, seventeen years her junior. Sarah was dramatic, understated – and looked smashing!\n\nThe Fans\n\nPerhaps the most important accessory for a nineteenth century woman was her fan. A head covering of some kind was an age-old tradition and mandatory. Jewelry was a luxury. A lady’s fan however, was a necessity, particularly among women of a certain age when great changes occur. Fans had been around for centuries, and the basic style never varied.\n\nIn their teens, young ladies had actual lessons in learning the “unspoken language” of fans for flirtatious coquetry. How it was opened, how it was closed, how it fluttered, could signal “I am interested/I am not interested.’ Sometimes it was for modesty or a fashion statement. But essentially a fan was used for its stated purpose: to create a breeze.\n\nClothing was designed to cover the body, especially women’s clothing, with its hoops and petticoats and yards and yards of material. It was hot, pure and simple.There was no air conditioning, nor any table-mounted electric fans.\n\nMost ladies’ fan frames were made from ivory or bone, and sometimes wood. Then the ribs were covered with various fabrics or specialty papers, decorated in any number of ways. Most women had several fans in their wardrobe, and being a high ranking congressional wife (Polk was Speaker of the House of Representatives for a time), Sarah no doubt had many. She had them for daytime wear, for casual veranda-sitting, and for evening or formal occasions. All were designed to coordinate with her gowns.\n\nOne of her documented (and existing) fans is made of a delicate white lace, which naturally went with everything.\n\nPerhaps her most renowned fan is the one she was given by her husband at the time of his inauguration as president in 1845. It was a magnificent object of hand-crafted paper with a portrait of her husband in the center and all Polk’s predecessors surrounding it. It was one-of-a-kind, and remains today as one of the treasures at a Polk family home in Columbia, Tennessee. (Polk Place, their primary home in Nashville, was destroyed by fire long ago.)\n\nAh, But The Metaphorical Fans\n\nJames Knox Polk retired from his single term in 1849, and died only three months later, many claim “from overwork.” Sarah was only forty-four, and had long been accustomed to playing an active albeit behind-the-scenes role in her husband’s career. Now she became a “professional widow” for more than four decades. Her “fans” now took on a metaphorical purpose: they allowed her to hide in public sight, which she believed was her womanly duty. It is said she seldom left her house in Nashville except to attend church.\n\nBy mid-nineteenth century, Victoriana culture was entrenched, and the prompt remarriage tradition of an earlier era was replaced by long, if not eternal, mourning. Like Mary Lincoln, Lucretia Garfield and Ida McKinley, widowed First Ladies who followed her, Sarah wore nothing but black thereafter.\n\nShe busied herself with some good works, hosting occasional parties for orphaned children, and enjoyed the weekly visits from her minister. But mostly she sorted and resorted, and organized and re-organized her husband’s papers. Her reputation and pious reserve kept Polk Place off-limits for both Union and Confederate soldiers, who otherwise used most of Tennessee as a Civil War battlefield. Visiting dignitaries to Nashville always made a point of paying their respects to the former First Lady. She herself made no political statements, and only released her slaves when it became law.\n\nWhatever talents or intelligence Sarah had, whatever opinions or political philosophies she espoused or decried, and whatever opportunities she may have let slip away, were forever hidden by her metaphorical fan. It kept her away from the public’s prying eye.\n\nPerhaps it also hid her self-inflicted boredom.\n\nSources:\n\nBoller, Paul – Presidential Wives – 1988 Oxford University Press\n\nFoster, Feather Schwartz – Mary Lincoln’s Flannel Pajamas and Other Stories from the First Ladies’ Closet – Koehler Publishing, 2016\n\nNelson, Anson and Fanny – Memorials of Sarah Childress Polk – ADF Randolph Company (reprint of 1892 publication)\n\nThe entire country was stunned by Lincoln’s Assassination in 1865.\n\nNew York’s Electoral Votes\n\nBy 1860, New York had been the most populous state for more than a half-century. It accounted for a whopping 35 electoral votes, and gave them all to Republican Abraham Lincoln. It tipped the election balance in that convoluted four-way race. Had the votes gone otherwise, it would have been an even bigger mess than it was.\n\nDespite the electoral votes, the popular votes were much closer, mainly due to the huge population of New York City and its immediate environs (the five-boroughs were not incorporated until the 1890s). The Empire State had a population of a little under 1.09 million; the City and its surroundings accounted for more than 800,000!\n\nThe NYC-area not only voted against Lincoln, but did so again in 1864.\n\nNew York City was the financial hub of the entire country. The banks, the financiers, the industrial magnates, railroads and shipping and the places of big-business – all were centered (or had major facilities) in New York City. When the Civil War was ramping up, and southern secession was becoming far more than foolhardy blather, NYC was far more interested in what it would (or wouldn’t) do for business.\n\nVery few New Yorkers were actual secessionists, although many were “sympathetic.” Very few were radical abolitionists. While respectable New Yorkers never condoned brutality or mistreatment, many believed that southern slaves were by and large in better circumstances than the influx of recent immigrants living in squalor and populating the factories of the north.\n\nBut when secession did happen, and Lincoln’s election did happen, and the Civil War did start in earnest, there was a serious movement in NYC to secede from New York State and become its own neutral entity. This way, they could trade with both the North and the South, and the European nations that did business with them – and they would make a fortune!\n\nIt was all about money. And a huge number of said bankers, financiers, etc. managed to make a huge amount of money, anyway.\n\nLincoln’s assassination in April, 1865 drastically changed their collective attitude. They were as horrified by the event as everyone else, and were quick to realize that whatever faults they found in Lincoln-the-President, were more than offset by the virtues of Lincoln-the-Man.\n\nGeneral Townsend and the Procession\n\nAbraham Lincoln had very little blood kin. His closest relative was his 21-year-old son Robert. Thus Secretary of War Edwin Stanton took charge, and assigned the complete mechanics of Lincoln’s Funeral (with few exceptions) to the Military. Brevet Brigadier General Edward. D. Townsend was placed in charge of orchestrating the final circuitous journey of the fallen President from Washington back home to Springfield, IL. The train-processional would follow the route Lincoln had taken when he first was elected in 1860.\n\nEvery step was immaculately planned, coordinated and followed to the minute. The train itself, which made several “exchanges” with competitive/ancillary railroad lines across state borders. The speed of the train, where it stopped, and for how long. Where it “slowed” to accommodate local citizens lining the tracks and tossing flowers.\n\nWhile the military honor guards included a permanent escort for the full ride, thousands of soldiers from local units were interchanged along the way. Most were engaged in crowd control for the hundreds of thousands of citizens who wanted to lay a wreath or bear witness and say a prayer at his coffin.\n\nStaff officers under General Townsend vetted and choreographed placing the plethora of dignitaries wishing to pay formal or private respects. State governors and past governors, mayors, council members, prominent citizens, Union veterans of all ranks, clergymen, local undertakers, civic groups, ladies’ clubs, choirs… and occasionally old personal friends of Lincoln. The numbers were overwhelming. Old records show that each mourner was allowed one second to pass by the coffin. Some even less. And thousands upon thousands did just that. Some were even turned away for lack of time.\n\nAnd then there were the crowds of just-plain-citizens come to pay their tearful respects.\n\nThe Core of the Big Apple\n\nFrom New Jersey, where Lincoln’s bier and catafalque were rowed with muffled oars on a barge across the Hudson River, nearly a hundred thousand silent New Yorkers stood waiting at the pier where the trappings of grief were hitched for the slow march to City Hall. Nearly everyone was in mourning garb, or wore a respectful black sleeve or hat band, available for purchase from vendors on nearly every street. Along the route, choirs sang requiems and bands played funeral dirges. And rows upon rows of veterans marched in respectful silence behind the hearse.\n\nAlong the way, the procession stopped briefly for various smaller ceremonies for “invited” mourners.\n\nPhotographs of the President in his coffin was expressly forbidden, requested by a deeply grieving Mrs. Lincoln, and honored by Secretary Stanton. Nevertheless, dozens of photographs from a respectful long distance were taken of the procession for the newspapers, and for posterity.\n\nNearly a century later, one of those photographs of New York City’s funeral procession down 23rd Street, was studied minutely and enlarged by historian Stefan Lorant. In an upstairs window of a townhouse, two little boys were watching the event: Six-year-old Theodore Roosevelt and his five-year-old-brother Elliott bore witness, and TR never forgot.\n\nA Final Salute\n\nWhen the coffin finally came to the station to be carried aboard the special train to Albany, there was a carriage waiting a couple of blocks away. General Townsend was nearby, and recognized the carriage. He walked over, and greeted his old, retired commander.\n\nWinfield Scott, General of the Army since the War of 1812, now past eighty, would die the following year. The younger Townsend offered to have Scott’s driver bring the carriage closer to the station, but the ailing Scott insisted on walking the distance to pay personal respect to his commander-in-chief.\n\nSources:\n\nSearcher, Victor – The Farewell to Lincoln – Abington Press, 1965\n\nhttps://lostmuseum.cuny.edu/archive/a-city-divided-new-york-and-the-civil\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/marchapril/feature/lincolns-assassination-stuns-the-nation\n\nhttps://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/scott-winfield-1786-1866/\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was about five, frail and suffering from severe asthma, his wealthy and devoted parents provided the best medical treatment money could buy. In the early 1860s, one of his medically approved treatments was smoking big black cigars (for a five year old with asthma!) and copious amounts of black coffee. As an adult, Theodore never smoked anything, but he did become a mega coffee drinker. One of his sons noted that when TR was President, he drank a gallon of coffee every day – supplemented by four heaping spoons of sugar in every cup!\n\nBetween the caffeine and the sugar, TR was perpetually wired! More than just about anything, Theodore Roosevelt was energy personified. He required little sleep, read a book-a-day, traversed the country more than any other President up to that time, exhausted two-at-a-time stenographers with his correspondence, found time to take his wife rowing, his kids camping – and never missed a deadline.\n\nAuthor, historian and political cartoonist Rick Marschall, is more than just an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt. He is an extremely knowledgeable maven on his favorite subject! His latest effort, The Most Interesting American is a biography of TR’s reputation, reputation being how other people perceived him. A very interesting way of looking at a very interesting American.\n\nDuring his relatively short on-paper lifetime (he died at only sixty), he likely died of extreme old age, having packed at least three or more full concurrent lifetimes into those years. And since such a multi-faceted individual presents different faces on his prism, Marschall divides the essence of Roosevelt into enough stand-alone chapters to be books in of themselves, and pepper every presidential TR library: the president, the politician; the sportsman; the conservationist; the family man, etc., etc.\n\nEach section contains prescient annotated commentary from Marschall, followed by comments and excerpts from people who knew him personally. The quotes come from casual to close to lifetime friendships with hundreds (and maybe thousands) of people, many of whom achieved high prominence themselves. Prominent people usually get to know other prominent people.\n\nAnd very high on the list of TR’s many admirable qualities, is the one well known in his own time, but usually overlooked a hundred years after his death: his intelligence. He surely must rank very highly among presidents of exceptional intellect. His gift of remembering names and faces, and even small minutiae of their lives or past conversation, is an asset to every politician. His photographic memory of the details (to include multi-lines of poetry) from his book-a-day reading habit was extraordinary. But perhaps the biggest part of his true intellect-cum-intelligence was the scope, variety and broadness of his interests and abilities. He could navigate between mediating labor disputes and foreign wars, and became a master of the end-run – the alternative that usually makes winners of both sides.\n\nHis personal companions were from every sort throughout his life. From outdoorsmen to Ivy League scholars, to poets, policemen and social reformers, to aristocrats and Kings. And children of all ages.\n\nHe could discuss a Supreme Court decision, the second act of Macbeth, the history of Lithuania, and the best way to skin a moose – and he could do it all knowledgeably … before dessert.\n\nAnd, according to Marschall, TR was very straightforward in evaluating his own abilities, and believed himself to have average skills. OK, perhaps a bit better than average, but surely not exceptional. As a writer, he had a nifty way with the vernacular that poured out of him like Niagara. But many writers were better. As a natural-scientist, he could likely have his own television series today, but career opportunities in the late nineteenth century were limited. And TR’s oversized personality might succumb to the boredom of day-after-day scientific research. As an outdoorsman, he was a mediocre rider and marksman. Even as a politician, in rarefied company, he knew that with politics, the events are usually in control – not the “man in the arena.” Theodore Roosevelt also self-evaluated one of his most important qualities: the one that resonated with the electorate: “sincerity.” And he was a sincere man. His belief that his abilities were average was not false modesty; TR was neither modest, nor false. He was very intelligent and insightful.\n\nIf he had any quality that might be less desirable, it could be his “preachy” side. Marschall, the compiler of the excerpts and quotes, spends a hefty amount of space on TR’s morals, faith, religion and example-setting. Not that it is untrue or insincere. But morals, faith and religion are like garlic in the salad dressing: a little is fine…too much, not so fine. People tend to weary of crusaders, and after a while, said crusaders seem to be tilting at windmills.\n\nBut overall, Rick Marschall has produced a masterpiece of observations by TR’s own contemporaries. Some, like his family members, were private and circumspect in their comments. Some, like John Hay, bridged the decades between knowing Lincoln and knowing TR, and loved them both. Some like Bill Sewell, his earliest guide to the great outdoors. Some like John Muir and John Burroughs, were the naturalists who considered TR their pal. Some were like Archie Butt, his Military Aide whose glances into the personal TR were private letters, never meant to be seen by the general public. There were a slew of newspaper reporters who followed his career for years. And even President Woodrow Wilson, his antagonist and rival, commented about Theodore Roosevelt’s lovable side! And dozens and dozens of people whose names are lost to history, but have left their marks anyway.\n\nThe Most Interesting American is a joy for the Theodore fan, and a treasure for the Theodore scholar!

His bride was twenty-three.\n\nBride and Groom\n\nBy the time John Quincy Adams was eighteen and ready to enter Harvard, he was already the most cosmopolitan young man in the country. As a boy, he had accompanied his father on diplomatic missions, representing the USA in Paris and later London. JQ was exceptionally bright, exposed to the finest education possible in Europe, fluent in several languages, and by fourteen, was engaged as secretary (and translator) to a diplomatic mission in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nHe returned to the US at eighteen, sailed through Harvard, read law, passed the Massachusetts bar… then realized that the mundane practice of law bored him to death. Politics and international diplomacy were high on his list of alternative career choices.\n\nJQA (as he called himself) published prescient essays in the newspapers regarding the new US government, which brought the attention of President Washington. He developed a high opinion of the young man, (to the delight of Vice President John Adams) and started him on his diplomatic career.\n\nAs minister to the Netherlands, his assignments frequently took him to London and the home of the prominent and well-to-do American merchant Joshua Johnson, who had settled in Britain years before the Revolution, married, and raised a family. His daughter Louisa Catherine was twenty, pretty, French convent educated, well-mannered, and adept at all the social graces of a well-to-do Englishwoman. JQ was moderately interested; his passions were for intellectual pursuits rather than people. But he also knew that he was ready for marriage and family, a necessary step in his professional advancement. Louisa likely realized that being courted by the son of the American Vice President was a coup! And her father was delighted!\n\nTheir courtship last about two years – mostly by correspondence. Louisa Johnson had ample time to assess the cool disposition of her fiancé, as well as his controlling nature. Nevertheless, the courtship persisted, and in 1797 they married.\n\nThe Bad News\n\nShortly before their wedding, the bride and groom were apprised of the financial embarrassment of Joshua Johnson, who had overstretched his shipping enterprises. Bankruptcy was looming. Whatever JQ might have expected as a dowry would not be forthcoming.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams was not born to wealth, nor did he aspire to anything more than comfortable middle class. The Johnson financial distress affected Louisa perhaps more subliminally than she realized at first. It bothered her throughout her life. She felt personally embarrassed, even perhaps devalued, and ashamed of her family. In her diaries, she wondered if her husband’s coolness was predicated on his disappointment in her dowry. (It probably was not; JQ was just cool by nature.)\n\nThe only thing Joshua Johnson could give the newlyweds was an opulent honeymoon trip on his last remaining ship. They set sail for Portugal, which was JQ’s new diplomatic post. But the good news, was that his new post was reassigned to Prussia – larger, and far more important.\n\nPrussia\n\nTheir new assignment was exciting for both the young Adamses. He already knew passable German, and would quickly improve to fluency, both written and spoken. Louisa, already fluent in both English and French, also learned sufficient German for the expected pleasantries. Their social life glittered. Frederick William III, the young King of Prussia took a liking to his new American diplomat, and Queen Louise considered his bride delightful.\n\nJQ, without intending to hurt his new wife, was an inconsiderate husband. He focused most of his “socio-diplomatic” attentions on his fellow diplomats and their man-stuff: brandy and pipes, card games, and political discussions. JQA thrived in that environment – and usually forgot that his young wife was left to fend for herself in a sea of opulently-dressed strangers. JQ had brought his brother Thomas along as his secretary, charged with escort duty and dancing partner for his sister-in-law. Fortunately they got on well. But Louisa was neglected, and JQ was oblivious.\n\nRouge: Part I\n\nRouge is a cosmetic, used since ancient time to add an attractive “blush” to the feminine cheek. It was also expensive, and as such, an affectation of the upper class. It was common in Europe, particularly in court circles.\n\nIn 18th century America, rouge had not yet hopped the pond. Some young women pinched their cheeks for added color, but that was about it.\n\nThe Queen of Prussia was a socially sophisticated woman, born into royalty and exposed to all the nuances of feminine graces. She was close in age to Louisa Adams and found her companionable.\n\nThe Queen had married at sixteen, and already had two babies. She noticed that Mrs. Adams seemed particularly pale and quickly surmised the reason. It was she who suggested a bit of rouge to brighten her complexion. She even gave her a little tub of rouge as a personal gift.\n\nRouge: Part II\n\nThe Queen had been correct in her suspicions. Louisa was indeed pregnant – the first of fifteen pregnancies, although only four were completed to term, and only three lived to maturity.\n\nThe next time the Adamses were invited to the palace, Louisa had applied some of the rouge. When her husband saw his wife wearing cosmetics, he was livid, and insisted that she remove it immediately! She refused, saying that it was a gift from the Queen, and she felt obliged to use it.\n\nJQA thought otherwise, and personally scrubbed her face with soap and water. According to one source, she then refused to go to the palace with him. The source continues saying that Louisa considered it a “victory” by not attending. Another source says that Louisa reapplied the dab of rouge, and went alone to the palace.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut JQA “erasing” the rouge part is true.\n\nSources:\n\nNagel, Paul C. – Descent From Glory: Four Generations of the John Adams Family – Oxfvord University Press – 1983\n\nShepherd, Jack – Cannibals of the Heart – 1980, McGraw Hill\n\nUnger, Harlow Giles – John Quincy Adams – DeCapo Press, 2012\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Quincy-Adams\n\nhttp://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=6\n\nServing as a pallbearer is the most unselfish “good deed” someone can do for another. The deceased can never return the favor.\n\nThe Great General\n\nUlysses S. Grant was not born to anything even remotely connected with fame or renown or even great ability. He came from a strictly middle-class family, with middle-class values and abilities.\n\nThat he was sent to West Point for his education was a great milestone in his life. He was initially resistant, but then again, he was seventeen, and his father was an overbearing man. He did well enough to graduate in the middle of his class, distinguished only for his superb horsemanship.\n\nNevertheless, the associations and friendships made at the Academy would figure prominently throughout his life.\n\nThe Great General Dies…\n\nCivil War General Grant’s successes in the field, i.e. the Victor of Vicksburg and the Hero of Appomattox, catapulted him to national prominence, and into the White House itself. For two terms. And then a round-the-world tour of the great cities and capitals!\n\nWhen he returned, he settled in New York City, feted and partied, and eventually assuming a partnership in a financial brokerage, despite his sincere confession that he “didn’t know anything about finance.” His “I-know-everything” partner was also a scoundrel, who concocted a borrow-from-Peter-to-pay-Paul scheme that left the brokerage in financial chaos, scandal, and riddled with debt that a humiliated Grant committed himself to repay.\n\nAbout the same time, the General, now 62, was diagnosed with throat cancer.\n\n…And It Wasn’t Peachy\n\nGrant insisted (and it was often repeated by his family members) that he got cancer from eating a peach. But what did he know? It is more likely that he first recognized the discomfort in his throat while eating a peach, which can be acidic.\n\nBut it is even far likelier that he developed the cancer from thirty cigars a day for thirty years…\n\nBottom line, the General suffered for about a year, in pain and decline, while he churned out his remarkable War Memorials, written with one purpose in mind: to pay his debts and provide for his family. Redeeming his reputation was also a side benefit.\n\nThe Cost of Dying\n\nGrant’s only absolute demand regarding his funeral, was to have his beloved wife Julia lie beside him when her time came. The rest (with perhaps a few of his caveats) was arranged by his sons – and by the U.S. Military.\n\nEven today, people of no prominence at all are overwhelmed by the cost of even a modest funeral. Grant’s Funeral was an event worthy of a monarch. The procession itself was seven miles long! And New York City, which was chosen in no small part by Julia Grant (who loved the Big Apple), had deep municipal pockets to do itself proud. President Grover Cleveland and former-President Chester A. Arthur (both New Yorkers, by the way) were the honorary chairmen, and former POTUS Rutherford B. Hayes (a 4x-wounded Union General) led the procession of tens of thousands of war veterans.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, from the highest of the high to the lowest of the low, lined the streets. Many to march, and many more to pay respects.\n\nIt was the Army (with the input of Frederick D. Grant, a former West Point trained Colonel himself) who selected the handful of pallbearer escorts for the procession.\n\nThe Pallbearers\n\nLeading the regular pallbearers was Admiral David Porter, who had not only known Grant during the War, but had successfully partnered with him on numerous occasions where the Army and Navy worked in happy unison. Hamilton Fish, a New York Congressman and two-term Secretary of State under POTUS Grant was a personal friend. His wife and Julia Grant were very close. George S. Boutwell had been secretary of the Treasury during the Grant Administration. John A. Logan, was one of the best “political” generals during the Civil War, and at the time of Grant’s death was the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, the foremost Union Veterans’ association. George S. Childs was a Philadelphia newspaper publisher and neighbor to the Grant’s summer cottage in Long Branch, NJ. George Jones and Oliver Hoyt had raised huge sums to provide for the “retirement” for the never-wealthy Grants.\n\nThen there were the Honorary Pallbearers…\n\nFriends and former foes, and West Pointers all, were assigned special roles in Grant’s Funeral Procession.\n\nWilliam T. Sherman. The best known Union General next to Grant, was a fellow Ohioan, two years older and ahead of USG at West Point. Their Academy acquaintance was pleasant but generally superficial, given their ages/classes. Subsequent meetings were also pleasant but superficial. Their friendship began during the War, grew at Shiloh, and was cemented during the long Vicksburg campaign. They thought alike. Sherman later became General of the Army.\n\nPhilip A. Sheridan. Nine years USG’s junior, the best known Cavalry General in the Union Army barely made the WP physical list, at only 5’4”. Nevertheless he packed a cannonade of energetic leadership into his small frame, and at the time of Grant’s death, was General of the Army (after Sherman retired.)\n\nJoseph E. Johnston. Nearly fifteen years USG’s senior, he had attended West Point at the same time as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis. As a Confederate General, he suffered both from serous wounds (during the Peninsula Campaign), and a long-running feud with Jefferson Davis. Nevertheless he was able and capable, and at the time of USG’s death, was the best known living ex-Confederate officer.\n\nSimon Bolivar Buckner. This CSA General had been a close friend of Grant’s since their Academy days. He was a pal when Grant needed one, later surrendered to Grant at Ft. Donelson, and came to visit him as he lay dying twenty-one years later. It was personal.\n\nSources:\n\nFlood, Charles Bracelen – Grant’s Final Victory: Ulysses S.

A skirmish known as the Black Hawk War had erupted in the region, and volunteers were needed. Thus the New Salem fellows signed up, perhaps for larks or an escape from their humdrum farming chores.\n\nAs it was, they saw no action, saw no enemy and fired no shots other than for target practice. Mostly it was a month-long camp-out with marching drills. Lincoln, to his great pleasure, was elected by his peers to serve as the captain of their unit. He would later call that election the most gratifying to him.\n\nSumming up his “military experience,” there was none to speak of. He spent the next thirty years as a civilian.\n\nLincoln: Commander-in-Chief\n\nSuffice it to say, that when Abraham Lincoln became President in 1861, his knowledge of the military was minuscule. He needed to rely on the professionally trained officers who knew about such matters. He was particularly respectful of the aging General Winfield Scott – who had been the commanding general during the long-forgotten Black Hawk War.\n\nOne thing Lincoln did know about the military, civilian or not, was that military power (army, navy, marines, etc.) is essential to any nation. He also knew that said military has a plethora of rules, regulations, officers, orders, orders and more orders. By and large, it is necessary, and President Lincoln, as Commander-in-Chief of the US Military, respected that need. Without sufficient (and enforceable) discipline and order, an Army will quickly fall apart.\n\nBut as Southern States seceded, and shots were fired at Fort Sumter, and the Civil War began in earnest, things changed. The tiny US Army consisted of perhaps 15,000 men and 1500 officers – and a call for 75,000 volunteers was quickly raised and exceeded.\n\nOne of the Problems\n\nMost of the new volunteers had no military training past shooting at tin cans on a fence or varmints in their fields. Most of them were farm boys, backwoods men, clerks and otherwise entry-level recruits. And while a high percentage of them could read and write, some didn’t know their left and right. And a very high percentage of them had never been more than a few miles from their homes.\n\nNaturally, the educated recruits, the professionals, the businessmen, the “older guys” and the politicians were the stuff of officers. President Lincoln signed hundreds of military appointments for colonels and generals. He was not a fool, and realized that while many of them made fine officers, a lot of them were bumbling and pontificating mini-autocrats.\n\nWhen some eighty thousand new recruits enlisted, armed, trained and sent into the field after only a month, there were bound to be problems. If rules and regulations were disobeyed or deliberately flaunted, the punishment could be draconian, if not deadly.\n\nLincoln-the-compassionate was a practical man, however. If a soldier deserted, or bounty-jumped to reenlist elsewhere (for the money), or encouraged mutiny, etc., he obviously deserved punishment, however severe. But an exhausted young soldier sleeping on sentinel duty, or scared and running to hide, or similar situations was a different story.\n\nHigh-level commanding officers regularly complained that the President was undermining their discipline.\n\nLincoln insisted on his own latitude. As time went on, he ordered that he personally had to sign off on any court martial for the death sentence.\n\nThe Case of William Scott\n\nWilliam Scott, was a private in Company K of the Third Vermont Volunteers. He had enlisted right off, and had seen action at the First Battle of Bull Run. They, like the others, had fallen back to Washington in disarray, and the husky young Scott was detailed for night-time sentry duty on the bridge across the Potomac, between Maryland and Virginia (enemy territory)!\n\nThey had fought all day, and then had marched miles to their current position, exhausted and demoralized. Young Pvt. Scott nodded off while on watch. He was caught by the Duty Officer, court-martialed and sentenced to death.\n\nPrivate Scott’s comrades were horrified at the severity of the punishment, and managed to have his case put before the President, who was equally horrified. He pardoned the young private, and had him sent back to his unit.\n\nThe story quickly made rounds in the newspapers and magazines, and puffed and embellished via poems and songs, and Private Scott was now “The Sleeping Sentinel,” and in his day, became the best-known Private in the Union Army.\n\nThe Sad, Sad End\n\nLess than a year later, General George McClellan initiated a mammoth military campaign in Virginia. On one of the first Union assaults of that effort, Private William Scott received his red badge of courage: six bullets to his body. His fellow soldiers dragged him to safety, where he expired. He was 23.\n\nFrancis de Hayes Janvier was an American poet of modest renown, and well skilled in the Victorian sentimentality of his time. He wrote the poem “The Sleeping Sentinel,” commemorating young Pvt. Scott being pardoned by the President just as he was lined up before the firing squad. (That part was an exaggeration). The poem was so poignant, it was read to President and Mrs. Lincoln at a White House reception in early 1863.\n\nThe poem was published throughout the North, and even reprinted for many years afterwards. In the nineteen-teens, as moving pictures grew in popularity, a short film, “The Sleeping Sentinel” was based on that poem.\n\n… And, in the last expiring breath, a prayer to Heaven he sent\n\nThat God, with his unfailing grace, would bless our president.\n\nEven today, Pvt. William Scott is honored in Vermont.\n\nSources:\n\nSearcher, Victor – The Farewell to Lincoln – Abington Press, 1965\n\nhttps://acws.co.uk/archives-military-discipline\n\nDaily writing prompt\n\nDescribe one simple thing you do that brings joy to your life.\n\nDespite historical innuendos, Aaron Burr was not a suitor for Dolley Payne’s hand.\n\nThe Promising Burr\n\nAaron Burr (1756-1836) had a childhood mix of tragedy and blessings. His NJ family was reasonably prosperous; his grandfather was the well-known Puritan preacher Jonathan Edwards.\n\nAlas, Burr’s father, grandfather, mother and grandmother all died by the time baby Aaron was two. He was raised by relatives and guardians. It is said the relationships were strained, and young Aaron tried to run away at various times. Nevertheless, he received an excellent education at the Elizabethtown Academy, and excelled.\n\nAt thirteen, he was admitted to the College of New Jersey (Princeton), and became a classmate of James Madison, five years his senior. He showed promise, graduating in 1772, at sixteen. He stayed on to study theology, but lost interest, and went to Connecticut to read law with a relative. Then the Revolutionary War interfered. Burr enlisted, served bravely and commendably, and eventually became Lieutenant Colonel. Then he was severely wounded.\n\nContinuing his legal studies during his recuperation, Aaron Burr entered the political arena in New York, and again showed promise. He opened a successful legal practice and was elected to the NY Legislature. By 1791, he was elected to the United States Senate. Life was definitely promising, although there were hints from some of his peers that his greatest “talents” were for intrigue.\n\nWhen the USA Capital was in Philadelphia, Senator Burr boarded with Mary Coles Payne, Dolley’s mother, who had opened her house to boarders when her husband’s business failed.\n\nSenator Burr and The Widow Todd\n\nDolley Payne was a young Quaker bride when Senator Burr lived in Philadelphia, but since her house was only a short distance from her parents’ home, they became pleasantly acquainted.\n\n1793 was a horrible year for both Dolley Payne Todd and Aaron Burr. A yellow fever epidemic raged, decimating nearly 25% of Philadelphia’s population. Dying on the same day was Dolley’s husband John Todd and her newborn son William Temple. Only days earlier, both her husband’s parents had died.\n\nIn New York, Aaron Burr lost his wife Theodosia Provost, who succumbed after a long battle with cancer. His closest relative now was his ten-year-old daughter Theodosia.\n\nThe recent Widow Dolley Todd now faced another problem: her brother-in-law was conniving to prevent her from inheriting the modest estate left by her late husband. This included their house – and John Todd’s law books!\n\nSenator Burr was one of the attorneys she consulted in order to claim her rightful property. In addition, when she was advised to make a will, the twenty-five year old widow’s first responsibility was to name a guardian for her surviving son. Her father had died; three older brothers had died. She had no available male kin, and her son, John Payne Todd was only two-years-old.\n\nDolley named Senator Aaron Burr as Payne’s guardian, should anything happen to her.\n\nBoth of them were now newly widowed, but there does not appear to be any romance.\n\nThe Introduction\n\nMeanwhile, the Widow Todd having weathered a recent childbirth, an epidemic of huge proportions, the loss of her in-laws, followed by the loss of her husband and her infant son, followed by legal wrangling over her lawful inheritance, tried to pick up the pieces of her life.\n\nIt is said that she was “noticed” shopping at the market stalls by Virginia Congressman James Madison, one of the key members of the Constitutional Convention held a few years earlier to chart the governmental direction of the new country. Dolley was a fine-looking woman, and it appears that she was “noticed” by many people.\n\nIt is not documented, but Madison may also have noticed her some time earlier at one of President and Mrs. Washington’s levees. Mistress Todd was kin-by-marriage to the Washingtons. Her sister had married one of GW’s nephews.\n\nWhat is known, however, is that Madison wanted to meet this charming young woman whose bright eyes and warm smile seemed to attract everyone she met. He asked Senator Burr, his Princeton classmate, to arrange the introduction.\n\nOnly four or five months after Todd’s death, Dolley sent a note to her closest friend Eliza Collins, “Thee must come to me at once. Senator Burr says the Great Little Madison wants to meet me.”\n\nThe introduction was successful, and five months later Dolley Payne Todd married James Madison, and they lived happily for the next forty years.\n\nPromises Broken\n\nAll the promise shown by young Aaron Burr, whether academically, militarily, legally, politically and even financially… was destroyed by Burr himself in a series of self-inflicted miscalculations – and his penchant for grandiose intrigue.\n\nWhen he ran for the position of Vice President (so he claimed) in 1800, the electoral vote was a tie between him and Thomas Jefferson. (According to the Constitution, the winner became President, and the first-runner-up became the Vice President.) But the wily Burr declared that the “tie” permitted him to claim the Presidency for himself, and the election was thrust into the House of Representatives. Perhaps sensing Burr’s deficiency of character, they voted for Jefferson. Burr became Vice President, and generally non-grata in the new capital of Washington DC. Congress promptly amended the Constitution to prevent a repeat of that situation.\n\nIn early 1804, his long bitter rivalry with Alexander Hamilton, George Washington’s Treasury secretary, NY lawyer, businessman and entrepreneur, culminated in a duel. Burr fired the fatal bullet, and became non-grata in most of the country.\n\nAs ex-Vice President (replaced by Jefferson in 1804), Burr devised grandiose plans to claim a substantial part of the recent Louisiana Territory for his own fiefdom. It resulted in a trial for treason, but he was acquitted for lack of evidence. He self-exiled himself in Europe, where he was generally non-grata by everyone.\n\nBoth Dolley and James Madison were deeply disappointed by their old “friend.” He had played an important role in both their lives.\n\nBut for good or ill, they never spoke publicly about him.\n\nSources:\n\nCote, Richard N – Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolley Madison – Corinthian Books, 2005\n\nMoore, Virginia – The Madisons: A Biography, 1979, McGraw Hill\n\nhttps://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-great-trial-that-tested-the-constitutions-treason-clause\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Aaron-Burr\n\nEvery First Lady is entitled to some new clothes for the inauguration!\n\nClothes Make the Woman…\n\nOf course it helps if you are good looking. It helps even more, if you have money.\n\nMartha Washington in her late fifties was certainly no beauty when she became the First Lady. She didn’t even attend the inauguration, new gown or not.\n\nAbigail Adams was never a beauty. She didn’t attend the inauguration either.\n\nThe first FLOTUS to attend was Dolley Madison. She was forty, good looking and stylish – without being opulent. She set the standard for First Ladies to follow.\n\nBut not all FLOTUSes were good looking.\n\nMary Lincoln, however…\n\n…was in her early forties. Certainly not beautiful, but nice-enough looking at the time. Certainly not wealthy, but she had splurged in both Chicago and New York on “appropriate” style-setting outfits. The problem was, they were not up to sophisticated Washington styles. She learned that part very quickly. One of her first FLOTUS actions was to engage a personal dressmaker.\n\nShe also learned that the merchants in New York and Philadelphia were happy to grant her unlimited credit for her gowns and bonnets, jewelry and shawls. She took full advantage, but her “taste” didn’t quite catch on.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that did catch on was her extravagance, mostly unknown to the President.\n\nFast Forward a Hundred Years\n\nJacqueline Kennedy was definitely a “looker.” She was young, and her simple elegance (nothing but the best) caught on like wildfire. When her husband complained of her “extravagance,” her father-in-law, a man of deep pockets, told her to buy whatever she wanted and send HIM the bill. She was happy to oblige.\n\nBut her clothes, even today, are perfection. They were of the finest quality (but so were Eleanor Roosevelt’s, and they didn’t set any styles), and they were easily copied for the mass market. And the market massed like no other!\n\nPerhaps the best part of Jackie’s fashion influence was that her A-line styles looked good on everyone, no matter their size or shape.\n\nGoing Backward Again\n\nIda McKinley became First Lady in 1897. She was fifty. She had been, as her husband was happy to let everyone know, “the prettiest girl in Canton Ohio” some twenty-five years earlier. She was also one of the wealthiest. Her father, James Saxton, was the newspaper publisher, the banker and a large property owner in town. He liked his new son-in-law a lot! Things looked good!\n\nBut Ida’s life had taken a dreadful turn a few years into her marriage to William McKinley. A series of tragedies, deaths of two children, and serious health problems had turned her into a demanding semi-invalid. The remnants of her frail, petite beauty remained, but her life was sad.\n\nHer marriage, however, was still a happy one. McKinley adored his ailing wife and made every effort to grant her every wish. Or whim. She had become self-centered and difficult, completely revolving her life around herself, her husband, and their life together. He was, in the Victorian phrase, “her all.”\n\nEven his decision to run for Congress (he was thirty-three, and they had been married for only five years) was predicated on her health. He believed a complete change of venue might lift her despondency.\n\nHis political rise was not meteoric, or even particularly notable. He became a tariff-maven, which in itself creates as much zing as a bowl of oatmeal. But he was also one of the nicest fellows in Congress – or Ohio, for that matter. He made friends everywhere. Even his political opponents could find little disparaging to say about him.\n\nAnd a man so devoted to his invalid wife packs a substantial political plus!\n\nThe Trousseau\n\nJames Saxton lived a full life, and when he died, he left Ida, his eldest daughter, a substantial inheritance: About $80,000, worth more than a million today.\n\nBy the late 1890s however, styles had changed to reflect the emergence of a new type of woman. Smart. Athletic. Active. Healthier. On-the-move. The A-line skirts and short jackets were made for this kind of lifestyle. The split (or divided) skirt was specifically fashionable for bicycles.\n\nDespite her frail condition and inability to exercise at all, and despite the three gargantuan meals the McKinley’s were said to enjoy daily, Ida remained petite. And she loved clothes and jewelry and all the trimmings.\n\nTaste being taste, she had her own – and it was frilly and perhaps a little out of style. Taffeta silk gowns that caused the pleasant rustling of frou-frou (rich noise) were party clothes, mostly worn by wealthy women.\n\nThat was Ida’s style.\n\nThe election of her husband to the presidency was a monumental event in her life, and with her inheritance (or at least some of it), she wanted to splurge on herself. William McKinley was only too happy to acquiesce. She deserved some personal pleasure.\n\nIda Goes Shopping\n\nTrousseaus are usually connected to brides and weddings. But they also connote a complete new wardrobe purchased for a major event. Like becoming First Lady. Ida consulted the finest dressmakers and modistes, and purchased an assortment of gowns and wraps, shoes and shawls and perhaps even negligee plus all the accessories. All of the finest material, the most expensive ribbons and laces. Nothing but the best! It is said to have cost her $10,000 – well into six-figures today.\n\nAnd in every newspaper article about the McKinley campaign of 1896, there was mention of Mrs. McKinley’s inaugural trousseau – and its price tag. It would probably be tacky today, but back then she was thrilled to be included. And the POTUS-to-be was happy to provide some joy in her life.\n\nAnd it was her own money.\n\nSources:\n\nFoster, Feather Schwartz – Mary Lincoln’s Flannel Pajamas and Other Stories from the First Ladies’ Closet – Koehler Publishing, 2016\n\nLeech, Margaret – In the Days of McKinley – Harper & Brothers, 1959\n\nMorgan, H.

Hundreds, and even thousands of soldiers glittered in their armor, assembled and proud.\n\nMost marched. The leaders rode on horseback. In some cultures, kings and princes rode in horse-drawn wagons or chariots, decked out in all their glory. Some rode on elephants. Wagons followed in the parade, filled with the spoils of war: gold and silver, jewels, the finery and opulence of wealth and power now in possession of others.\n\nToward the end of the procession, were the vanquished. Men, women and children, including the ill and frail, often shackled together, to be distributed as slaves – to the victorious. And the crowds cheered. Occasionally great arches were built to commemorate the great victory.\n\nThe parades were repeated over and over throughout millenniums. Some of the arches still stand.\n\nApril 2, 1865\n\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis had received the news he had been dreading for weeks. General Robert E. Lee had advised him that his disintegrating army could no longer withstand the long siege in Petersburg, nor protect the Confederate Capital in Richmond, just across the River. He advised the President to evacuate.\n\nIt was not a surprise to Davis, a former West Point officer himself. The department heads of the remaining Confederate government had already packed up their records and paperwork and loaded it onto waiting trains.\n\nWhen all was done, strategic fires were set to deny any goods, services, arms, ammunition – and even shelter, to their enemy.\n\nApril 4, 1865\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, tired, underweight and visibly aged from the stresses of four years of a country at war with itself, had arrived two weeks earlier at City Point, VA, at the confluence of the James and Appomattox Rivers, not far from the besieged Petersburg. Said to be the tenth largest city in the Union at the time, City Point had been thrown together some months earlier to supply and support the huge Army of the Potomac, which was now in the throes of mopping up the remainder of the Civil War.\n\nEveryone knew it was only a matter of time before it would finally be over and the killing stopped, and perhaps, the healing could begin.\n\nSpring had come early that year in Washington, some hundred miles away. The President and his family decided to “visit the army” at the invitation of General Ulysses S. Grant. They sailed down the Potomac aboard the River Queen, into the Chesapeake Bay, and finally up the mighty James River.\n\nHe had already spent nearly two weeks with the Army, reviewed their parades, met with their commanders, and greeted the rank and file, something he always enjoyed. The soldiers had grown to love and respect him, and it is said, it was their that ballots guaranteed his second term. Lincoln had also met the USCT (United States Colored Troops, as they were then called), who revered him as their savior. AL was sincere in his recognition of their valor and contribution, and was visibly touched by his reception.\n\nGeneral Grant had already amassed his vast army and began chasing the exhausted Rebels through central Virginia.\n\nIt was a rarity. The President had a free day.\n\nRichmond\n\n“I have always wanted to see Richmond,” Lincoln is said to have commented. So with his eleven-year-old son Tad, Admiral David Porter, and a handful of military escorts, the President boarded one of the riverboats, and sailed the short distance to Richmond. The smell of smoke and ash from its self-inflicted fires permeated the air, as a barge rowed him and his party ashore.\n\nNobody knew he was coming. That included a skeletal Union Army dispatched to maintain order. Of course the tall, lanky President, made a foot taller in his stovepipe hat, was visible. If he had any thought or fear that he might be a target for a well-placed sniper, it is unknown. If he thought his appearance was an act of heroism, it is also unknown.\n\nBut immediately after stepping ashore, he was recognized by some of the Negroes, and according to Admiral Porter, “No electric wire could have carried the news faster.” Within minutes, the President was surrounded by throngs of Negroes and whites alike, eager to touch him – or his clothing. Or shake his hand.\n\nIt was perhaps a mile from the river to the Confederate “White House,” – a mostly uphill walk. It was also a particularly warm day, and Lincoln was perspiring heavily. He moved slowly, since he was completely surrounded by hundreds of men, women and even children. When some Negroes knelt in his path, Lincoln was embarrassed, saying they should kneel only to God.\n\nWhen he finally entered the Confederate White House, which in essence was a comfortable city-mansion, he was taken to Jefferson Davis’ office, and sat in his chair. When asked by his escort if they could get anything for him, he asked for “a glass of water.” He was hot and tired. And emotionally drained. The past four years were catching up with him. People remarked how much he had aged. He likely agreed. It hadn’t been easy.\n\nOne cannot fathom what went on in Abraham Lincoln’s mind while he sat at Davis’ desk. The ghosts of a hundred thousand – or more – Americans North and South who had given their lives in the War, could not have been too far from his thoughts. They never were.\n\nWhile he was in still in Richmond, he received a wire from Secretary of War Stanton. Secretary of State William Seward had been seriously injured in a carriage accident. His little respite was over.\n\nIt was time to go back to Washington.\n\nSources:\n\nFoote, Shelby – The Civil War: A Narrative: Volume 3: Red River to Appomattox – Vintage Book, 1986\n\nKelly, C.

It basically an offshoot of milk, whether from a cow, a sheep or a goat, etc. to include the curd. As one would expect, the different animal milk produces different types of cheese. A cheese press covered with cheese cloth (no surprise regarding the name) is used to collect the milk and curd, and pressed to smooth all the lumps. After a certain amount of time for aging, etc., a round wheel of cheese is produced. Some are very small. Some are very large.\n\nThe Election of 1800\n\nIn a phrase, the presidential election of 1800 was indeed very cheesy (groan), with incumbent John Adams (MA), a Federalist, losing to an unexpected and convoluted tie between Thomas Jefferson (VA) and Aaron Burr (NY), both considered “Republicans” (a forerunner to the Democrats). Burr’s original intention was to become Vice Presidency, but his decision (because of the tie) was to challenge/opt for the Presidency. Thus the definitely cheesy part. The House of Representatives had to weigh in on that decision.\n\nThey selected TJ as President, and Aaron Burr as Vice President. (As an aside, the 12th Amendment was quickly proposed and ratified to ensure a separate ballot for POTUS and VP, so such a crisis would never occur again.)\n\nThe Massachusetts Baptists\n\nMassachusetts was primarily an industrial and commercial state, with Puritan ethics of hard work and regular habits. By the the latter part of the 18th century, the Baptists had become a large offshoot of the Congregationalists, differentiating by minor changes in their liturgy. While most of industrial Massachusetts citizens were political Federalists in the manner of George Washington and John Adams, there was a growing number of “Republicans” – especially among the more agrarian Baptists in Cheshire, in the western part of the state, around the Berkshire Mountains.\n\nOne of their political leaders was John Leland, a preacher who was an ardent supporter of the separation of church and state. He had met Thomas Jefferson some time earlier, and respected him. They had become friends, and were particularly like minded on the church-state issue. Leland campaigned vigorously for TJ.\n\nLet’s Send A Cheese!\n\nThere is something about cheese that lends itself to being a welcome gift. Cheese trays with fancy wedges wrapped in colored foil surrounded by other goodies abound – especially around holidays!\n\nOnce Jefferson was duly sworn in, John Leland organized his congregation to commemorate the occasion by sending the new President a gift. Since his town of Cheshire was primarily a dairy farming community, rather than collecting money per se, he urged every one who owned a cow to collect every quart of milk and curd from a single cow on a particular day. They were then instructed to bring it to a location where a large apple cider press had been commandeered for the cheese-making process.\n\nThe caveat: Only “Republican” farmers with “Republican” cows were invited to participate. Federal cows were not included. The milk from 900 cows was collected in the process and created a cheese that was 4’ across, 15” thick, and weighed more than a half ton! Alas, no tray, no fancy wedges and nobody knew about colored foil.\n\nPastor Leland insisted the cheese was made to show “profound respect” to the ratification of Jefferson’s election.\n\nThere was one more caveat: The farmers were all free-born. No slave labor was used to make the cheese.\n\nWhen the cheese was ready to be shipped, the entire congregation gathered to sing hymns and say prayers over the massive cheese.\n\nShipping The Cheese\n\nNobody in Cheshire, or even in Berkshire County itself had a wagon large enough and strong enough to handle such a massive load. And the roads between western Massachusetts and Washington, a distance of nearly 500 miles, were primitive for the most part.\n\nSo a sleigh was hired to transport the cheese to a barge on the Hudson River, and float it down to New York City, where it was hefted aboard a sloop bound for Baltimore. Then it was hauled by a huge horse drawn wagon to Washington – and the President. The trip took three weeks. But that doesn’t really matter. Cheese is known to age very well.\n\nWhen it was delivered on January 1, 1802, it came with a note, underscoring the fact that it was made from “Republican” milk, crafted voluntarily by the farming men, women and children of the town, and entirely done by free labor. Not a single slave assisted in its making.\n\nPresident Jefferson praised it as proof of the domestic skills of the farmers of Berkshire County. He thanked them by cutting off a large chunk of the cheese to send back its “donors,” along with his personal check for $200 as a donation to their congregation. TJ was very particular about not accepting gifts. He likely thought it was cheesy.\n\nIt is said that chunks of the cheese were part of the White House July 4th celebrations.\n\nComparing Cheeses\n\nSome thirty years later, President Andrew Jackson was also given a humongous cheese from his admirers. It sat aging in the lobby of the White House for nearly two years before AJ threw a huge party and invited everyone in town to come with their knives and napkins to partake.\n\nIt was also said to have left an odor that took months (maybe years) to dissolve, and even longer to clean out of the carpeting.\n\nAnd don’t think they didn’t compare notes! Jefferson’s cheese was indeed larger, by as much as 200 pounds.\n\nSources:\n\nJohn P. Kaminski, Thomas Jefferson: Philosopher and Politician.
