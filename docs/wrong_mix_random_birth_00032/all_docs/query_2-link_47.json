Alkalinity can be created via dissolution of alkaline materials, like limestone or soda. Presented research studies boundaries for increasing alkalinity in seawater. The best way to increase alkalinity was found using an equilibrated solution, for example as produced from reactors. Adding particles for dissolution into seawater on the other hand produces the risk of losing alkalinity and degassing of CO2 to the atmosphere.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Landâocean connectivity through groundwater\n\nDamian L.

Here, we discuss our perspectives on future research directions to better understand land–ocean connectivity through groundwater and its potential responses to natural and human-induced environmental changes.\n\nBioclimatic change as a function of global warming from CMIP6 climate projections\n\nMorgan Sparey, Peter Cox, and Mark S. Williamson\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 451–488, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-451-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-451-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate climate models are vital for mitigating climate change; however, projections often disagree. Using KÃ¶ppen–Geiger bioclimate classifications we show that CMIP6 climate models agree well on the fraction of global land surface that will change classification per degree of global warming. We find that 13 % of land will change climate per degree of warming from 1 to 3 K; thus, stabilising warming at 1.5 rather than 2 K would save over 7.5 million square kilometres from bioclimatic change.\n\nReconciling different approaches to quantifying land surface temperature impacts of afforestation using satellite observations\n\nHuanhuan Wang, Chao Yue, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 75–92, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-75-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-75-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provided a synthesis of three influential methods to quantify afforestation impact on surface temperature. Results showed that actual effect following afforestation was highly dependent on afforestation fraction. When full afforestation is assumed, the actual effect approaches the potential effect. We provided evidence the afforestation faction is a key factor in reconciling different methods and emphasized that it should be considered for surface cooling impacts in policy evaluation.\n\nDrivers of intermodel uncertainty in land carbon sink projections\n\nRyan S. PadrÃ³n, Lukas Gudmundsson, Laibao Liu, Vincent Humphrey, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5435–5448, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5435-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5435-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe answer to how much carbon land ecosystems are projected to remove from the atmosphere until 2100 is different for each Earth system model. We find that differences across models are primarily explained by the annual land carbon sink dependence on temperature and soil moisture, followed by the dependence on CO2 air concentration, and by average climate conditions. Our insights on why each model projects a relatively high or low land carbon sink can help to reduce the underlying uncertainty.\n\nReviews and syntheses: A framework to observe, understand and project ecosystem response to environmental change in the East Antarctic Southern Ocean\n\nJulian Gutt, Stefanie Arndt, David Keith Alan Barnes, Horst Bornemann, Thomas Brey, Olaf Eisen, Hauke Flores, Huw Griffiths, Christian Haas, Stefan Hain, Tore Hattermann, Christoph Held, Mario Hoppema, Enrique Isla, Markus Janout, CÃ©line Le Bohec, Heike Link, Felix Christopher Mark, Sebastien Moreau, Scarlett Trimborn, Ilse van Opzeeland, Hans-Otto PÃ¶rtner, Fokje Schaafsma, Katharina Teschke, Sandra Tippenhauer, Anton Van de Putte, Mia Wege, Daniel Zitterbart, and Dieter Piepenburg\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5313–5342, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5313-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5313-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong-term ecological observations are key to assess, understand and predict impacts of environmental change on biotas. We present a multidisciplinary framework for such largely lacking investigations in the East Antarctic Southern Ocean, combined with case studies, experimental and modelling work. As climate change is still minor here but is projected to start soon, the timely implementation of this framework provides the unique opportunity to document its ecological impacts from the very onset.\n\nAcidification impacts and acclimation potential of Caribbean benthic foraminifera assemblages in naturally discharging low-pH water\n\nDaniel FranÃ§ois, Adina Paytan, Olga Maria Oliveira de AraÃºjo, Ricardo Tadeu Lopes, and CÃ¡tia Fernandes Barbosa\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5269–5285, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur analysis revealed that under the two most conservative acidification projections foraminifera assemblages did not display considerable changes. However, a significant decrease in species richness was observed when pH decreases to 7.7 pH units, indicating adverse effects under high-acidification scenarios. A micro-CT analysis revealed that calcified tests of Archaias angulatus were of lower density in low pH, suggesting no acclimation capacity for this species.\n\nMonitoring vegetation condition using microwave remote sensing: the standardized vegetation optical depth index (SVODI)\n\nLeander Moesinger, Ruxandra-Maria Zotta, Robin van der Schalie, Tracy Scanlon, Richard de Jeu, and Wouter Dorigo\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5107–5123, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5107-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5107-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe standardized vegetation optical depth index (SVODI) can be used to monitor the vegetation condition, such as whether the vegetation is unusually dry or wet. SVODI has global coverage, spans the past 3 decades and is derived from multiple spaceborne passive microwave sensors of that period. SVODI is based on a new probabilistic merging method that allows the merging of normally distributed data even if the data are not gap-free.\n\nEvaluation of soil carbon simulation in CMIP6 Earth system models\n\nRebecca M. Varney, Sarah E. Chadburn, Eleanor J. Burke, and Peter M. Cox\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4671–4704, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4671-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4671-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil carbon is the Earthâs largest terrestrial carbon store, and the response to climate change represents one of the key uncertainties in obtaining accurate global carbon budgets required to successfully militate against climate change. The ability of climate models to simulate present-day soil carbon is therefore vital. This study assesses soil carbon simulation in the latest ensemble of models which allows key areas for future model development to be identified.\n\nDiazotrophy as a key driver of the response of marine net primary productivity to climate change\n\nLaurent Bopp, Olivier Aumont, Lester Kwiatkowski, Corentin Clerc, LÃ©onard Dupont, Christian EthÃ©, Thomas Gorgues, Roland SÃ©fÃ©rian, and Alessandro Tagliabue\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4267–4285, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4267-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4267-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of anthropogenic climate change on the biological production of phytoplankton in the ocean is a cause for concern because its evolution could affect the response of marine ecosystems to climate change. Here, we identify biological N fixation and its response to future climate change as a key process in shaping the future evolution of marine phytoplankton production. Our results show that further study of how this nitrogen fixation responds to environmental change is essential.\n\nImpact of negative and positive CO2 emissions on global warming metrics using an ensemble of Earth system model simulations\n\nNegar Vakilifard, Richard G. Williams, Philip B. Holden, Katherine Turner, Neil R. Edwards, and David J. Beerling\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4249–4265, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4249-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4249-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo remain within the Paris climate agreement, there is an increasing need to develop and implement carbon capture and sequestration techniques. The global climate benefits of implementing negative emission technologies over the next century are assessed using an Earth system model covering a wide range of plausible climate states. In some model realisations, there is continued warming after emissions cease. This continued warming is avoided if negative emissions are incorporated.\n\nAcidification, deoxygenation, and nutrient and biomass declines in a warming Mediterranean Sea\n\nMarco Reale, Gianpiero Cossarini, Paolo Lazzari, Tomas Lovato, Giorgio Bolzon, Simona Masina, Cosimo Solidoro, and Stefano Salon\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4035–4065, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4035-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4035-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture projections under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios of the Mediterranean Sea biogeochemistry at the end of the 21st century show different levels of decline in nutrients, oxygen and biomasses and an acidification of the water column. The signal intensity is stronger under RCP8.5 and in the eastern Mediterranean. Under RCP4.5, after the second half of the 21st century, biogeochemical variables show a recovery of the values observed at the beginning of the investigated period.\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement â avoiding runaway CaCO3 precipitation during quick and hydrated lime dissolution\n\nCharly A. Moras, Lennart T. Bach, Tyler Cyronak, Renaud Joannes-Boyau, and Kai G. Schulz\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3537–3557, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3537-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3537-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research presents the first laboratory results of quick and hydrated lime dissolution in natural seawater. These two minerals are of great interest for ocean alkalinity enhancement, a strategy aiming to decrease atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Following the dissolution of these minerals, we identified several hurdles and presented ways to avoid them or completely negate them. Finally, we proceeded to various simulations in todayâs oceans to implement the strategy at its highest potential.\n\nAssessment of the impacts of biological nitrogen fixation structural uncertainty in CMIP6 earth system models\n\nTaraka Davies-Barnard, SÃ¶nke Zaehle, and Pierre Friedlingstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3491–3503, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3491-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3491-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBiological nitrogen fixation is the largest natural input of new nitrogen onto land. Earth system models mainly represent global total terrestrial biological nitrogen fixation within observational uncertainties but overestimate tropical fixation. The model range of increase in biological nitrogen fixation in the SSP3-7.0 scenario is 3 % to 87 %. While biological nitrogen fixation is a key source of new nitrogen, its predictive power for net primary productivity in models is limited.\n\nSoil carbon loss in warmed subarctic grasslands is rapid and restricted to topsoil\n\nNiel Verbrigghe, Niki I. W. Leblans, Bjarni D. Sigurdsson, Sara Vicca, Chao Fang, Lucia Fuchslueger, Jennifer L. Soong, James T. Weedon, Christopher Poeplau, Cristina Ariza-Carricondo, Michael Bahn, Bertrand Guenet, Per Gundersen, Gunnhildur E.

OddsdÃ³ttir, Ivika Ostonen, Josep PeÃ±uelas, Andreas Richter, Jordi Sardans, PÃ¡ll SigurÃ°sson, Margaret S. Torn, Peter M. Van Bodegom, Erik Verbruggen, Tom W. N. Walker, HÃ¥kan Wallander, and Ivan A. Janssens\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3381–3393, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3381-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3381-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn subarctic grassland on a geothermal warming gradient, we found large reductions in topsoil carbon stocks, with carbon stocks linearly declining with warming intensity. Most importantly, however, we observed that soil carbon stocks stabilised within 5 years of warming and remained unaffected by warming thereafter, even after > 50 years of warming. Moreover, in contrast to the large topsoil carbon losses, subsoil carbon stocks remained unaffected after > 50 years of soil warming.\n\nThe European forest carbon budget under future climate conditions and current management practices\n\nRoberto Pilli, Ramdane Alkama, Alessandro Cescatti, Werner A. Kurz, and Giacomo Grassi\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3263–3284, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3263-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3263-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo become carbon neutral by 2050, the European Union (EU27) forest C sink should increase to −450 Mt CO2 yr-1. Our study highlights that under current management practices (i.e. excluding any policy scenario) the forest C sink of the EU27 member states and the UK may decrease to about −250 Mt CO2eq yr-1 in 2050. The expected impacts of future climate change, however, add a considerable uncertainty, potentially nearly doubling or halving the sink associated with forest management.\n\nThe influence of mesoscale climate drivers on hypoxia in a fjord-like deep coastal inlet and its potential implications regarding climate change: examining a decade of water quality data\n\nJohnathan Daniel Maxey, Neil David Hartstein, Aazani Mujahid, and Moritz MÃ¼ller\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3131–3150, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3131-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3131-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeep coastal inlets are important sites for regulating land-based organic pollution before it enters coastal oceans. This study focused on how large climate forces, rainfall, and river flow impact organic loading and oxygen conditions in a coastal inlet in Tasmania. Increases in rainfall were linked to higher organic loading and lower oxygen in basin waters. Finally we observed a significant correlation between the Southern Annular Mode and oxygen concentrations in the system's basin waters.\n\nContrasting responses of phytoplankton productivity between coastal and offshore surface waters in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea to short-term seawater acidification\n\nGuang Gao, Tifeng Wang, Jiazhen Sun, Xin Zhao, Lifang Wang, Xianghui Guo, and Kunshan Gao\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2795–2804, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2795-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2795-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfter conducting large-scale deck-incubation experiments, we found that seawater acidification (SA) increased primary production (PP) in coastal waters but reduced it in pelagic zones, which is mainly regulated by local pH, light intensity, salinity, and community structure. In future oceans, SA combined with decreased upward transports of nutrients may synergistically reduce PP in pelagic zones.\n\nModeling interactions between tides, storm surges, and river discharges in the Kapuas River delta\n\nJoko Sampurno, Valentin Vallaeys, Randy Ardianto, and Emmanuel Hanert\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2741–2757, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2741-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2741-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study is the first assessment to evaluate the interactions between river discharges, tides, and storm surges and how they can drive compound flooding in the Kapuas River delta. We successfully created a realistic hydrodynamic model whose domain covers the land–sea continuum using a wetting–drying algorithm in a data-scarce environment. We then proposed a new method to delineate compound flooding hazard zones along the river channels based on the maximum water level profiles.\n\nThe application of dendrometers to alpine dwarf shrubs â a case study to investigate stem growth responses to environmental conditions\n\nSvenja Dobbert, Roland Pape, and JÃ¶rg LÃ¶ffler\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1933–1958, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1933-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1933-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how vegetation might respond to climate change is especially important in arctic–alpine ecosystems, where major shifts in shrub growth have been observed. We studied how such changes come to pass and how future changes might look by measuring hourly variations in the stem diameter of dwarf shrubs from one common species. From these data, we are able to discern information about growth mechanisms and can thus show the complexity of shrub growth and micro-environment relations.\n\nClimate, land cover and topography: essential ingredients in predicting wetland permanence\n\nJody Daniel, Rebecca C. Rooney, and Derek T. Robinson\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1547–1570, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1547-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1547-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe threat posed by climate change to prairie pothole wetlands is well documented, but gaps remain in our ability to make meaningful predictions about how prairie pothole wetlands will respond. We integrate aspects of topography, land cover/land use and climate to model the permanence class of tens of thousands of wetlands at the western edge of the Prairie Pothole Region.\n\nNot all biodiversity rich spots are climate refugia\n\nÃdÃ¡m T. Kocsis, Qianshuo Zhao, Mark J. Costello, and Wolfgang Kiessling\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 6567–6578, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6567-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6567-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBiodiversity is under threat from the effects of global warming, and assessing the effects of climate change on areas of high species richness is of prime importance to conservation. Terrestrial and freshwater rich spots have been and will be less affected by climate change than other areas. However, marine rich spots of biodiversity are expected to experience more pronounced warming.\n\nEvaluating the dendroclimatological potential of blue intensity on multiple conifer species from Tasmania and New Zealand\n\nRob Wilson, Kathy Allen, Patrick Baker, Gretel Boswijk, Brendan Buckley, Edward Cook, Rosanne D'Arrigo, Dan Druckenbrod, Anthony Fowler, Margaux Grandjean, Paul Krusic, and Jonathan Palmer\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 6393–6421, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore blue intensity (BI) – a low-cost method for measuring ring density – to enhance palaeoclimatology in Australasia. Calibration experiments, using several conifer species from Tasmania and New Zealand, model 50–80 % of the summer temperature variance. The implications of these results have profound consequences for high-resolution paleoclimatology in Australasia, as the speed and cheapness of BI generation could lead to a step change in our understanding of past climate in the region.\n\nAnthropogenic CO2-mediated freshwater acidification limits survival, calcification, metabolism, and behaviour in stress-tolerant freshwater crustaceans\n\nAlex R. Quijada-Rodriguez, Pou-Long Kuan, Po-Hsuan Sung, Mao-Ting Hsu, Garett J. P. Allen, Pung Pung Hwang, Yung-Che Tseng, and Dirk Weihrauch\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 6287–6300, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6287-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6287-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic CO2 is chronically acidifying aquatic ecosystems. We aimed to determine the impact of future freshwater acidification on the physiology and behaviour of an important aquaculture crustacean, Chinese mitten crabs. We report that elevated freshwater CO2 levels lead to impairment of calcification, locomotor behaviour, and survival and reduced metabolism in this species. Results suggest that present-day calcifying invertebrates could be heavily affected by freshwater acidification.\n\nQuantifying the role of moss in terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in northern high latitudes\n\nJunrong Zha and Qianlai Zhuang\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 6245–6269, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6245-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6245-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study incorporated moss into an extant biogeochemistry model to simulate the role of moss in carbon dynamics in the Arctic. The interactions between higher plants and mosses and their competition for energy, water, and nutrients are considered in our study. We found that, compared with the previous model without moss, the new model estimated a much higher carbon accumulation in the region during the last century and this century.\n\nOn the influence of erect shrubs on the irradiance profile in snow\n\nMaria Belke-Brea, Florent Domine, Ghislain Picard, Mathieu Barrere, and Laurent Arnaud\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5851–5869, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5851-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5851-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExpanding shrubs in the Arctic change snowpacks into a mix of snow, impurities and buried branches. Snow is a translucent medium into which light penetrates and gets partly absorbed by branches or impurities. Measurements of light attenuation in snow in Northern Quebec, Canada, showed (1) black-carbon-dominated light attenuation in snowpacks without shrubs and (2) buried branches influence radiation attenuation in snow locally, leading to melting and pockets of large crystals close to branches.\n\nTolerance of tropical marine microphytobenthos exposed to elevated irradiance and temperature\n\nSazlina Salleh and Andrew McMinn\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5313–5326, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5313-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5313-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe benthic diatom communities in Tanjung Rhu, Malaysia, were regularly exposed to high light and temperature variability during the tidal cycle, resulting in low photosynthetic efficiency. We examined the impact of high temperatures on diatoms' photosynthetic capacities, and temperatures beyond 50 °C caused severe photoinhibition. At the same time, those diatoms exposed to temperatures of 40 °C did not show any sign of photoinhibition.\n\nPersistent impacts of the 2018 drought on forest disturbance regimes in Europe\n\nCornelius Senf and Rupert Seidl\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5223–5230, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5223-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5223-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEurope was affected by an extreme drought in 2018. We show that this drought has increased forest disturbances across Europe, especially central and eastern Europe. Disturbance levels observed 2018–2020 were the highest on record for 30 years. Increased forest disturbances were correlated with low moisture and high atmospheric water demand. The unprecedented impacts of the 2018 drought on forest disturbances demonstrate an urgent need to adapt Europeâs forests to a hotter and drier future.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st century\n\nJessica L. McCarty, Juha Aalto, Ville-Veikko Paunu, Steve R. Arnold, Sabine Eckhardt, Zbigniew Klimont, Justin J. Fain, Nikolaos Evangeliou, Ari VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Nadezhda M. Tchebakova, Elena I. Parfenova, Kaarle Kupiainen, Amber J. Soja, Lin Huang, and Simon Wilson\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5053–5083, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFires, including extreme fire seasons, and fire emissions are more common in the Arctic. A review and synthesis of current scientific literature find climate change and human activity in the north are fuelling an emerging Arctic fire regime, causing more black carbon and methane emissions within the Arctic. Uncertainties persist in characterizing future fire landscapes, and thus emissions, as well as policy-relevant challenges in understanding, monitoring, and managing Arctic fire regimes.\n\nSlowdown of the greening trend in natural vegetation with further rise in atmospheric CO2\n\nAlexander J. Winkler, Ranga B. Myneni, Alexis Hannart, Stephen Sitch, Vanessa Haverd, Danica Lombardozzi, Vivek K. Arora, Julia Pongratz, Julia E. M. S. Nabel, Daniel S. Goll, Etsushi Kato, Hanqin Tian, Almut Arneth, Pierre Friedlingstein, Atul K. Jain, SÃ¶nke Zaehle, and Victor Brovkin\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4985–5010, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4985-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4985-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite observations since the early 1980s show that Earth's greening trend is slowing down and that browning clusters have been emerging, especially in the last 2 decades. A collection of model simulations in conjunction with causal theory points at climatic changes as a key driver of vegetation changes in natural ecosystems. Most models underestimate the observed vegetation browning, especially in tropical rainforests, which could be due to an excessive CO2 fertilization effect in models.\n\nEffects of elevated CO2 and extreme climatic events on forage quality and in vitro rumen fermentation in permanent grassland\n\nVincent Niderkorn, Annette Morvan-Bertrand, Aline Le Morvan, Angela Augusti, Marie-Laure Decau, and Catherine Picon-Cochard\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4841–4853, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4841-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4841-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change can change vegetation characteristics in grasslands with a potential impact on forage chemical composition and quality, as well as its use by ruminants. Using controlled conditions mimicking a future climatic scenario, we show that forage quality and ruminant digestion are affected in opposite ways by elevated atmospheric CO2 and an extreme event (heat wave, severe drought), indicating that different factors of climate change have to be considered together.\n\nCushion bog plant community responses to passive warming in southern Patagonia\n\nVerÃ³nica Pancotto, David Holl, Julio Escobar, MarÃ­a Florencia Castagnani, and Lars Kutzbach\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4817–4839, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4817-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4817-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the response of a wetland plant community to elevated temperature conditions in a cushion bog on Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. We measured carbon dioxide fluxes at experimentally warmed plots and at control plots. Warmed plant communities sequestered between 55 % and 85 % less carbon dioxide than untreated control cushions over the main growing season. Our results suggest that even moderate future warming could decrease the carbon sink function of austral cushion bogs.\n\nBlue carbon stocks and exchanges along the California coast\n\nMelissa A. Ward, Tessa M. Hill, Chelsey Souza, Tessa Filipczyk, Aurora M. Ricart, Sarah Merolla, Lena R. Capece, Brady C O'Donnell, Kristen Elsmore, Walter C. Oechel, and Kathryn M. Beheshti\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4717–4732, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4717-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4717-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSalt marshes and seagrass meadows (\"blue carbon\" habitats) can sequester and store high levels of organic carbon (OC), helping to mitigate climate change. In California blue carbon sediments, we quantified OC storage and exchange between these habitats. We find that (1) these salt marshes store about twice as much OC as seagrass meadows do and (2), while OC from seagrass meadows is deposited into neighboring salt marshes, little of this material is sequestered as \"long-term\" carbon.\n\nOceanic primary production decline halved in eddy-resolving simulations of global warming\n\nDamien Couespel, Marina LÃ©vy, and Laurent Bopp\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4321–4349, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4321-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4321-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn alarming consequence of climate change is the oceanic primary production decline projected by Earth system models. These coarse-resolution models parameterize oceanic eddies. Here, idealized simulations of global warming with increasing resolution show that the decline in primary production in the eddy-resolved simulations is half as large as in the eddy-parameterized simulations. This stems from the high sensitivity of the subsurface nutrient transport to model resolution.\n\nAssessing climate change impacts on live fuel moisture and wildfire risk using a hydrodynamic vegetation model\n\nWu Ma, Lu Zhai, Alexandria Pivovaroff, Jacquelyn Shuman, Polly Buotte, Junyan Ding, Bradley Christoffersen, Ryan Knox, Max Moritz, Rosie A. Fisher, Charles D. Koven, Lara Kueppers, and Chonggang Xu\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4005–4020, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4005-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4005-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a hydrodynamic demographic vegetation model to estimate live fuel moisture dynamics of chaparral shrubs, a dominant vegetation type in fire-prone southern California. Our results suggest that multivariate climate change could cause a significant net reduction in live fuel moisture and thus exacerbate future wildfire danger in chaparral shrub systems.\n\nDoes drought advance the onset of autumn leaf senescence in temperate deciduous forest trees?\n\nBertold MariÃ«n, Inge Dox, Hans J. De Boeck, Patrick Willems, Sebastien Leys, Dimitri Papadimitriou, and Matteo Campioli\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3309–3330, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3309-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3309-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe drivers of the onset of autumn leaf senescence for several deciduous tree species are still unclear. Therefore, we addressed (i) if drought impacts the timing of autumn leaf senescence and (ii) if the relationship between drought and autumn leaf senescence depends on the tree species. Our study suggests that the timing of autumn leaf senescence is conservative across years and species and even independent of drought stress.\n\nOcean carbon cycle feedbacks in CMIP6 models: contributions from different basins\n\nAnna Katavouta and Richard G. Williams\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3189–3218, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3189-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3189-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDiagnostics of the latest-generation Earth system models reveal the ocean will continue to absorb a large fraction of the anthropogenic carbon released to the atmosphere in the next century, with the Atlantic Ocean storing a large amount of this carbon relative to its size. The ability of the ocean to absorb carbon will reduce in the future as the ocean warms and acidifies. This reduction is larger in the Atlantic Ocean due to a weakening of the meridional overturning with changes in climate.\n\nSensitivity of 21st-century projected ocean new production changes to idealized biogeochemical model structure\n\nGenevieve Jay Brett, Daniel B. Whitt, Matthew C. Long, Frank Bryan, Kate Feloy, and Kelvin J. Richards\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3123–3145, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3123-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3123-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify one form of uncertainty in modeled 21st-century changes in phytoplankton growth. The supply of nutrients from deep to surface waters decreases in the warmer future ocean, but the effect on phytoplankton growth also depends on changes in available light, how much light and nutrient the plankton need, and how fast they can grow. These phytoplankton properties can be summarized as a biological timescale: when it is short, future growth decreases twice as much as when it is long.\n\nOcean carbon uptake under aggressive emission mitigation\n\nSean M. Ridge and Galen A. McKinley\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2711–2725, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2711-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2711-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nApproximately 40 % of the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have been absorbed by the ocean. The goal of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement is to reduce humanity's emissions so as to limit global warming to no more than 2 °C, and ideally less than 1.5 °C. If we achieve this level of mitigation, the ocean's uptake of carbon will be strongly reduced. Excess carbon trapped in the near-surface ocean will begin to mix back to the surface and will limit additional uptake.\n\nEffects of Earth system feedbacks on the potential mitigation of large-scale tropical forest restoration\n\nAlexander Koch, Chris Brierley, and Simon L. Lewis\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2627–2647, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimates of large-scale tree planting and forest restoration as a carbon sequestration tool typically miss a crucial aspect: the Earth system response to the increased land carbon sink from new vegetation. We assess the impact of tropical forest restoration using an Earth system model under a scenario that limits warming to 2 °C. Almost two-thirds of the carbon impact of forest restoration is offset by negative carbon cycle feedbacks, suggesting a more modest benefit than in previous studies.\n\nWetter environment and increased grazing reduced the area burned in northern Eurasia from 2002 to 2016\n\nWei Min Hao, Matthew C. Reeves, L. Scott Baggett, Yves Balkanski, Philippe Ciais, Bryce L. Nordgren, Alexander Petkov, Rachel E. Corley, Florent Mouillot, Shawn P. Urbanski, and Chao Yue\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2559–2572, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2559-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2559-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examined the trends in the spatial and temporal distribution of the area burned in northern Eurasia from 2002 to 2016. The annual area burned in this region declined by 53 % during the 15-year period under analysis. Grassland fires in Kazakhstan dominated the fire activity, comprising 47 % of the area burned but accounting for 84 % of the decline. A wetter climate and the increase in grazing livestock in Kazakhstan are the major factors contributing to the decline in the area burned.\n\nPhysiological responses of SkeletonemaÂ costatum to the interactions of seawater acidification and the combination of photoperiod and temperature\n\nHangxiao Li, Tianpeng Xu, Jing Ma, Futian Li, and Juntian Xu\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 1439–1449, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1439-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1439-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFew studies have investigated effects of ocean acidification and seasonal changes in temperature and day length on marine diatoms. We cultured a marine diatom under two CO2 levels and three combinations of temperature and day length, simulating different seasons, to investigate combined effects of these factors. Acidification had contrasting effects under different combinations, indicating that the future ocean may show different effects on diatoms in different clusters of factors.\n\nTechnical note: Interpreting pH changes\n\nAndrea J. Fassbender, James C. Orr, and Andrew G. Dickson\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 1407–1415, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1407-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1407-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA decline in upper-ocean pH with time is typically ascribed to ocean acidification. A more quantitative interpretation is often confused by failing to recognize the implications of pH being a logarithmic transform of hydrogen ion concentration rather than an absolute measure. This can lead to an unwitting misinterpretation of pH data. We provide three real-world examples illustrating this and recommend the reporting of both hydrogen ion concentration and pH in studies of ocean chemical change.\n\nTiming of drought in the growing season and strong legacy effects determine the annual productivity of temperate grasses in a changing climate\n\nClaudia Hahn, Andreas LÃ¼scher, Sara Ernst-Hasler, Matthias Suter, and Ansgar Kahmen\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 585–604, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-585-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-585-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhile existing studies focus on the immediate effects of drought events on grassland productivity, long-term effects are mostly neglected. But, to conclude universal outcomes, studies must consider comprehensive ecosystem mechanisms. In our study, we found that the resistance of growth rates to drought in grasses varies across seasons, and positive legacy effects of drought indicate a high resilience. The high resilience compensates for immediate drought effects on grasses to a large extent.\n\nContrasting responses of woody and herbaceous vegetation to altered rainfall characteristics in the Sahel\n\nWim Verbruggen, Guy Schurgers, StÃ©phanie Horion, Jonas ArdÃ¶, Paulo N. Bernardino, Bernard Cappelaere, JÃ©rÃ´me Demarty, Rasmus Fensholt, Laurent Kergoat, Thomas Sibret, Torbern Tagesson, and Hans Verbeeck\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 77–93, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-77-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-77-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large part of Earth's land surface is covered by dryland ecosystems, which are subject to climate extremes that are projected to increase under future climate scenarios. By using a mathematical vegetation model, we studied the impact of single years of extreme rainfall on the vegetation in the Sahel. We found a contrasting response of grasses and trees to these extremes, strongly dependent on the way precipitation is spread over the rainy season, as well as a long-term impact on CO2 uptake.\n\nReduced growth with increased quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi under future ocean climate change conditions\n\nYong Zhang, SinÃ©ad Collins, and Kunshan Gao\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6357–6375, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6357-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6357-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur results show that ocean acidification, warming, increased light exposure and reduced nutrient availability significantly reduce the growth rate but increase particulate organic and inorganic carbon in cells in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, indicating biogeochemical consequences of future ocean changes on the calcifying microalga. Concurrent changes in nutrient concentrations and pCO2 levels predominantly affected E. huxleyi growth, photosynthetic carbon fixation and calcification.\n\nOcean-related global change alters lipid biomarker production in common marine phytoplankton\n\nRong Bi, Stefanie M. H. Ismar-Rebitz, Ulrich Sommer, Hailong Zhang, and Meixun Zhao\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6287–6307, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6287-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6287-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLipids provide crucial insight into the trajectory of ecological functioning in changing environments. We experimentally explore responses of lipid biomarker production in phytoplankton to projected changes in temperature, nutrients and pCO2. Differential responses of lipid biomarkers indicate rearrangements of cellular carbon pools under future ocean scenarios. Such variations in lipid biomarker production would have important impacts on marine ecological functions and biogeochemical cycles.\n\nMulti-decadal changes in structural complexity following mass coral mortality on a Caribbean reef\n\nGeorge Roff, Jennifer Joseph, and Peter J. Mumby\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5909–5918, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5909-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5909-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn recent decades, extensive mortality of reef-building corals throughout the Caribbean region has led to the erosion of reef frameworks and declines in biodiversity. Using field observations, models, and high-precision U–Th dating, we quantified changes in the structural complexity of coral reef frameworks over the past 2 decades. Structural complexity was stable at reef scales, yet bioerosion led to declines in small-scale microhabitat complexity with cascading effects on cryptic fauna.\n\nStable isotopes track the ecological and biogeochemical legacy of mass mangrove forest dieback in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia\n\nYota Harada, Rod M. Connolly, Brian Fry, Damien T. Maher, James Z. Sippo, Luke C. Jeffrey, Adam J. Bourke, and Shing Yip Lee\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5599–5613, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5599-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5599-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2015–2016, an extensive area of mangroves along ~â1000 âkm of coastline in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, experienced dieback as a result of a climatic extreme event that included drought conditions and low sea levels. Multiannual field campaigns conducted from 2016 to 2018 show substantial recovery of the mangrove vegetation. However, stable isotopes suggest long-lasting changes in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling following the dieback.\n\nGlobal climate response to idealized deforestation in CMIP6 models\n\nLena R. Boysen, Victor Brovkin, Julia Pongratz, David M. Lawrence, Peter Lawrence, Nicolas Vuichard, Philippe Peylin, Spencer Liddicoat, Tomohiro Hajima, Yanwu Zhang, Matthias Rocher, Christine Delire, Roland SÃ©fÃ©rian, Vivek K. Arora, Lars Nieradzik, Peter Anthoni, Wim Thiery, Marysa M. LaguÃ«, Deborah Lawrence, and Min-Hui Lo\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5615–5638, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5615-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5615-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find a biogeophysically induced global cooling with strong carbon losses in a 20 million square kilometre idealized deforestation experiment performed by nine CMIP6 Earth system models. It takes many decades for the temperature signal to emerge, with non-local effects playing an important role. Despite a consistent experimental setup, models diverge substantially in their climate responses. This study offers unprecedented insights for understanding land use change effects in CMIP6 models.\n\nCited articles"
