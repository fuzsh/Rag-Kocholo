        "text": "---History of George Washington: Bicentennial Celebration, Volume III Literature Series [George Washington Bicentennial Commission:Washington DC] 1932 (p. 280)\n\n\"With Martha's arrival the social pattern of the President's duties was established. The formal diners began at 4 P.M., and there was no waiting for unpunctual guests. If no clergyman was present, Washington himself said grace. In a mixed company , the President and his lady sat across from each other, halfway down the long table, with a secretary at the head and the foot, to aid the serving and the conversation...Fraunces, in a dazzling white apron, white silk shirt and stockings, velvet breeches, and powder in his hair, presided in the dining room and placed the dishes on the table, uncovered, while the carving and helping were mostly done by the secretaries. When the ladies retired to the drawing room it was Washington's habit to follow them after fifteen minutes for coffee, leaving one of the secretaries to entertain the gentlemen who wished to linger over the wine. If there were no other ladies present, Martha sat at the head of the table, with a secretary at the food, and the President half way betwen. For the family meals they reverted to the side-by-side chairs at the head of the table, with a carver at the food.\"\n\n---Washington's Lady, Elworth Thane [Dodd, Mead:Nwe York] 1960 (p. 281-282)\n\nEntertainment, Washington style, NYC\n\n\"[May 1-July 4, 1789) Washington's first task was not to ascertain his duties but to find time in which to discharge those awaiting him...These were duties of varying complexity but the least difficult of them would demand hours on hours of work every week and some would require long attention daily; how could this be given? If visitors were being ushered endlessly into the house all day, and the President went out every evening to return calls or to appear at civic entertainments, would not the public service suffer fatally and he, himself, disappoint popular expectation? The rule to receive \"visits of compliment\" on two designated says of the week and then for an hour only was made effective forthwith. Invitations to dinner in the President's House, which usually was served at 3 o'clock, had not been issued between the date of Washington's arrival in New York and that of the assumption of office. It was decided to make no exception to this rule for the time being, though Lear, on reaching the city, had hired Black Sam Fraunces as steward. The former proprietor of the tavern where Washington had said farewell to his officers, tossed off such a number of fine dishes, according to Lear, that we are distracted in our choice when we sit down to table, and obliged to hold a long consultation on the subject before we can determine what to attack. Although it seemed bad to leave these viands untouched while members of Congress were eating poor meals at noisy taverns, the Generals tentative decision to do no entertaining at dinner was approved and perhaps as promoted by old Federal lawmakers of taste and by conspicuous New Yorkers.\n\n---George Washington, Douglas Southall Freeman, Volume VI: Patriot and President, 1784-1793 [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 1954 (p. 199-200)\n\n\"It was life as far removed as decent existence could be from the routine of Mount Vernon...To be sure, there were at least two embarrassing situations. In one of them, the General had made arrangements to entertain guests at the afternoon meal on the 28th, the day after Martha's arrival; but perhaps because the servants were confused, the affair was neglected. Senator Paine Wingate, like the General, did not consider himself particularly \"nice,\" but even he wrote: \"It was the least showy dinner that I ever saw at the President's...After the dessert a single glass of wine was offered to each of the guests, when the President rose, the guests following his example, and repaired to the drawing-room, each departing at his option, without ceremony. Martha's activity and experience changed all that. Before the summer was over, a none-too-friendly Senator was to write of a meal at her table, \"It was a great dinner, and the best of the kind I ever was at.\"\n\n---George Washington, Douglas Southall Freeman, Volume VI: Patriot and President, 1784-1793 [Charles Scribner's Sons:New York] 1954 (p. 211)\n\nDespite the restriction of the invitations to officials the dinners could be gay, since such of Washingtons favorite friends as Knox and Robert Morris held office. He often tried to leaven a lump and create a party more like those at Mount Vernon by invitingnot only the elders but grownup sons, daughters, and daughters-in-lawThe president and Mrs. Washington sat opposite each other in the middle of the dinner table, the ladies being ranged on both sides of Martha, the gentlemen opposite them on both sides of GeorgeThe dinner began with soup, fish, roasted and boiled meats, gammon, fowls, etcThe dessert was first apple pies, pudding, etc., then iced creams, jellies, etc., then watermelons, muskmelons, apples, peaches, nuts.the food was eaten in solemn silence\n\n---George Washington and the New Nation: (1783-1793), James Thomas Flexner [Little Brown:New York] 1969 (p. 201-202)\n\nThe Samuel Fraunces connection?\n\n\"Perhaps thae most telling glimpse of Samuel Fraunces' character is gleaned from an exploration of his relationship with George Washington. Like many other Americans, Fraunces respected and revered Washington. Their relationship was ever one of master and servant; however, Washington clearly respected Fraunces' abilities as a manager and early in their acquaintance relied on him to select sundries such as china and glassware for his household and to recommend servants, particularly cooks and stewards. Washington used the [Fraunces] tavern when he gave his famous farewell speech to his officers on December 4, 1783. Fraunces, on the other hand, did not hesitate in the years before he joined the President's staff, especially as his monetary situation worsened, to exploit their friendship... Motivated by a downturn in his personal finances, Fraunces joined the first President's staff as his chief steward...Fraunces also selected food for Washington's table and supervised its preparation. Washington, however, was not completely satisfied with Fraunces' performance, and he noted the steward's \"taste for the high life,\" to which Washington did not object as long as expenses were kept low. The President entertained frequently, and it is no wonder that Fraunces was not able to stay within his budget. Washington, however, wanted to avoid projecting a royal image to the public and politicians. The President also complained that his servants were eating as well as he, and the two men appear to have had at least one disagreement over the serving of wine at the servants' table. Fraunces worked for Washington in New York for less than one year (May 1789 to February 1790) and the was discharged. Washington later admitted, \"I have entertained much harder thoughts of the latter [Fraunces] than I might have done. After the Federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790, Samuel Fruances rejoined Washington's household. Fraunces apparently never intended to return to New York.\"\n\n---Early American Taverns: For the Entertainment of Friends and Strangers, Kym S. Rice for Fraunces Tavern Museum [Regnery Gateway:Chicago] 1893 (p. 131-132)\n\nNeed to make something for class? We suggest Washington cake.\n\nJohn Adams\n\nWhat our presidents eat is a function family heritage, personal preference, physical condition, and social obligation. John and Abigail Adams were New Englanders who grew up on simple, frugal fare. Food historians tell us Mr. and Mrs. Adams also appreciated a variety of cuisines and fine foods, which they enjoyed while living in other cities (Paris, London, New York, Philadelphia). Although well versed in elegant entertaining, we are told Mr. and Mrs. Adams generally served simple dinners at the White House. Menus often included of their New England favorites. This was due mostly to the fact that the White house was *brand new.*\n\n\"Of course it was imperative that there be some official celebration of the opening of the new Executive Mansion...Finally plans were completed, and the big reception was scheduled for New Year's Day, 1801. This was the day the White House was formally opened to the public. The preparations were elaborate. This was the Adamses' most lavish reception...Tea, coffee, punch, and wine were served. There were also cakes and tarts, all baked in the new ovens on either side of the enormous kitchen fireplace. In addition, curds, creams, trifles, jellies, floating island, syllabub, sweetmeats, and assorted fruits graced the tables and were passed among the guests...Everything after the New Year's Day reception was anticlimactic. Because of the short time left in office, the Adamses did little formal entertaining...The dining habits of the [John Adams] presidential family were relatively simple, at least by Virginia standards. Menus were based largely on the couple's New England heritage, which differed considerably from the Southern heritage of Washington....The net result was a plainer cuisine. John Adams noted in his diary that his guests were served dinners that consisted of Indian pudding, molasses, and butter as a first course, veal, bacon, neck of mutton and vegetables as a second...However, the Adamses' wide experience in Paris and London and later in social Philadelphia, and their exposure to the Southern cuisine of the Washingtons and others, gave them a taste and respect for a more varied diet. It may well have been Abigail's determined economy that limited their menus, for John noted in his diary several dinners worthy of comment. Adams described at the home of Miers Fisher, a young Quaker lawyer: \"This plain Friend, with his plain but pretty wife with her Thees and Thous, had provided us a costly entertainment: ducks, hams, chickens, beef, pig, tarts, creams, custards, jellies, fools trifles, floating islands, beer, porter, punch, wine.\" Another time Adams saw fit to mention the quality of a meal at the home of Chief Justice Chew, describing it wryly: \"About four o'clock we were called to dinner. Turtle and every other thing, flummery, jellies, sweetmeats of twenty sorts, trifles, whipped syllabubs, floating islands, fools, etc., with a dessert of fruits, raisins, almonds, pears, peaches. A most sinful feast again! Everything which would delight the eye or allure the taste...Parmesan cheese, punch, wine, porter, beer.\" The ironic intent of \"a most sinful feast\" suggestst that Adams was not averse to rich foods. One suspects that Abigail's eye on that $25,000 [John Adam's presidential salary] accounted for the more mundane menus at home.\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon & Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 40-42) [NOTES: (1) This book contains far more information than can be paraphrased here.

This book also provides a general of the Adamses' entertaining habits and notes about the White House in its earliest years and a photgraph of a cookbook owned by the family.\n\nNeed to make something for class?\n\n\"Apple Pan Dowdy\n\nApples, like molasses, were a standby in New England Desserts.

Blend in 1/2 cup shortening until the mixture is mealy. Sprinkle a little ice water over the mixture, just enough to hold the dough together. Roll the pastry out, brush with 1/4 cup melted butter, and cut pastry in half. Place the halves on top of each other and cut again. Repeat until you have 16 separate but equal pieces of pastry piled on top of each other, then chill them a full hour. Roll the pastry once again, cut in half, and line the bottom of the baking dish with one half. Save the other half for the top. Keep both on ice while making the filling.\n\nTo make the filling: Mix 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Peel and core 10 large apples. Cut then into thin slices. Mix the apples with sugar-spice mixture and place in pastry-lined dish. Combine 1/2 cup molasses (or maple syrup) with 3 tablespoons melted butter and 1/4 cup water. Pour this over the apples. Cover with the top pastry layer and seal. Place in a preheated hot (400 degree F.) oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to low (325 degrees F.). After reducing the heat, \"dowdy\" the dish by cutting the crust into the apples with a sharp knife. Return dish to oven and bake a full hour. Serve hot with vanilla ice cream or with heavy cream or whipped cream. Serves 6.\"\n\n---Presidents' Cookbook (p. 51-52)\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nGourmet, scientist, traveler, farmer, diplomat: our third President was truly a Renaissance man. Biographers confirm Jefferson's love for native foods and passion for foreign fare. Jefferson's tables, both public and private, reflected his love for culinary adventure.\n\n\"Many of [Jefferson's] innovations are today an accepted part of our national diet...[he had an] adventurous palate and active interest in a wide range of foods...In his four years in Paris he sampled widely French cuisine, making copious notes of dishes he liked so he could serve them back home...In Holland he sampled waffles for the first time and was so pleased he immedately bought a waffle iron...A particular tea in Amsterdam appealed to him; he bought some to take along. In Nancy it was chocolate that caught his fancy, and in southern France he made notes on the differences in oranges in various communities he visited...Notes made on a visit to Rozzano included details of butter- and Parmesan cheese-making. He tasted a frozen delicacy and observed that \"snow vives the most delicate flavor to creams, but ice is the most powerful congealer and lasts longer.\" Like many a traveler returning home, Jefferson missed the dishes to which he had become accustomed. To his valet returning after him he sent a request for him to \"bring a stock of macaroni, Parmesan cheese, figs of Marseilles...raisins, almonds, mustard...vinegar, oil and anchovies.\"...President Jefferson was particularly addicted to intricate dishes and brought back from Paris...His bouilli, daubes, ragouts, gateaux, souffles, ices, sauces, and wine cookery...Jefferson confessed a preference for French cooking \"because the meats were more tender.\"...He as especially fond of fresh vegetables and kept a careful chart of the season when certain ones would be available in the local market...A gourmet...Jefferson ate lightly...He preferred vegetables to meats and was particularly fond of olives, figs, mulberries, crabs, shad, oysters, partridge, venison, pineapple, and light wines. He was a connoisseur s well of delicate French pastries, souffles, light cakes...His table drinks were cider and malt drinks...his greatest field of expertise was wine...the president's favorite wine was Madeira...\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon & Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 57-64)\n\n[NOTE: recipes included in this book are Old-Fashioned Coffee Cake, Dutch Waffles, Capitolade of Chicken, Batter Cakes, Soup a la Julienne, Gumbo, Potato Soup, Mexican Black Bean Soup,Okra Soup, Jamablaya, Noodles a la Jefferson, Macaroni and Cheese Pudding, and Bachelor Buttons (cookies).\n\n\"Despite his fondness for French cookery, Jefferson retained his liking for sweet potatoes, turnip grees, baked shad, Virginia ham, green peas, crab and many other native delicacies...He was so fond of his Virginia sweet corn that he raised it in his Paris garden. His kitchen garden at Monticello contained a variety of vegetables including his favorite peas, of which he was familiar with more than thirty varieties.

Conkey Company:Hammond IN] 1913 p. 633) James Madison\n\nMadison's biographers generally agree little is known about the private life, including food likes/dislikes, of James Madison. Dolley Madison's lavish dinners and entertainments represented the finest mix of Virginian fare and French cuisine. Presumably, Mr. Madison enjoyed some of these foods. The French connection was Jefferson's legacy. By the time the Madisons took residence in the White House, these types of meals/dishes were expected to be served. Biographers note Mr. Madison's early love of agriculture growing up in Virginia remained with him throughout his life. Some of his contemporaries (see below) reference bounteous harvest-style dinners. It is quite possible Mr. Madison's favorite meal consisted of Virginia ham, buttery rolls, apple pie and cider.\n\n\"In considering the social side of James Madison's administration, it become immediately apparent that the dominant figure was Mrs. Madison. No President's wife before her was so thoroughly in charge of the nation's social life...On the surface, the social scene during Madison's administration followd the pattern established by Jefferson. The cuisine was French as well asn English--Virginian; the wines were the finest French vintages; the hospitality was as open and cordial as Jefferson's. But Dolley was an innovator in her own right, with a style of her own. She did not share Jefferson's preference for intimate gatherings above all else, but enjoyed having masses of people about--for dinner, lawn parties, luncheons, teas, and dances...Dolley's idea of entertainment was in effect \"the more the merrier.\"...Like Jefferson politically, the Madison shared his aversion to formality and pompousness....The servant problems that nagged at the preceding Presidencies did not seem to affect Dolley Madison. Fore one thing, she supervised her own kitchen...When the President and his wife had a dinner party, provisions were lavish. Mrs. Seaton, wife of the owner of the National Intelligence (news publication), commented on one occasion: 'The dinner was certainly very fine, but still I was rather surprised, as it did not surpass some I have eaten in Carolina. There were many French dishes and exquisite wines...Ice creams, macaroons, preserves and various cakes are placed on the table, which are removed for almonds, raisins, pecan-nuts, apples, pears, etc...'...Dolley, following the customary form of her day, was expected to do the serving and even the carving...After dinner and a second dessert of fruit and nuts, there were parlor games, songs, music and even dancing...It was Dolley Madison who introduced the Easter Egg Rolling on the White House lawn, which was to become a tradition with almost all succeeding Presidents' families...The Madison present a paradox. Considering the length of time they were on the national scene, there is little known about their private persons...James Madison, small and slender, was undoubtedly a sparing eater. But what foods pleased him most? Dolley...undoubtedly liked food. But of her special favorite dishes little is known. Some few choice recipes and preferences were recorded, but they were relatively few, considering the frequency of her entertaining.\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 79-84)\n\n[NOTE: This book offers modernized recipe for the following items favored by the Madisons: Dolley Madison's Bouillon (soup), Chicken and Okra Soup, Pickled Eggs, Crab Omelet, Croquettes (like meatballs), Corn Oysters (like corn bread muffins), Puff Pops (popovers), Orange and Cranberry Relish, Cranberry Chutney (a relish), Virginia Potatoes (with ham & onions), Fairy Butter (hard boiled eggs, orange-flower water, powdered sugar, butter), Dolley Madison's Layer Cake, Caramel, Seed Cake (caraway seeds), Dolley Madison's Soft Gingerbread, Ginger Poun Cake, Cinnamon (Woodbury) Cake, Cinnamon Cakes (cookies), Dolley Madison Cake (spice cake), Apricot Ice Cream, Pink Peppermint Ice Cream, Cranberry Sherbet, Hen's Nest (a type of custard), A Yard of Flannel (alcoholic drink composed of ale, eggs, sugar, nutmeg, ginger, rum or brandy.]\n\n\"The most famous hostess in the White House has ever had came from the unlikely background of a devout Quaker family. The orderly, quiet routine of her childhood in Virginia and her girlhood in Philadelphia had given her no training in the art of hospitality. Indeed at the time she married James Madison in 1794, as the yound widow of Todd, with one child, her life and personality seemed already set into the traditional Quaker molds. But the...warmhearted Dolley inside the Quaker mold adapted quickly to her new life and loved every minute of it...Dolley soon adapted herself to the worldly customs of the new life she was leading... Before long, she was the recognized leader of Washington society...At dinner parties, Mrs. Madison also gracefully took the reins. She presided at the head of the table with her guests on her right and left, Madison at the side and his secretary at the foot of the table. This saved him from the effort of serving the guests, drinking wine, and leading the conversation...After their retirement the hospitality of Montpellier was Dolley's chief occupation...Dinner at Montpellier was an elaborate affair. The food on the table was always luxurious. Food for a party would incude three or four kinds of meat, three or four kinds of bread, fresh vegetables, fruit, pastry, champagne and ice.\"\n\n---The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States, Margaret Brown , historical text [GMC Publishing:New York] 1982 (p. 43-37)\n\n[NOTE: this book offers three modernized period recipes: Macaroni Soup a la Napeoliatine, Madison Cakes (yeast-based potato rolls), and Williamsburg Pound Cake.]\n\n\"The President, following Washington's practice, accepted no invitation to dine out...but everybody flocked to special dinners and the regualr Wednesday evening \"drawing rooms\" at the White House.\"\n\n---James Madison: A Biography, Ralph Ketcham [MacMillan:New York] 1971 (p. 519)\n\nMadison's college [Princeton University, NJ] food\n\n\"The students, tutors, and sometimes the president of Princeton ate together in the dining hall, which was managed by a steward who supervised the living quarters as well. The students drank tea and coffee at breakfast, and a tinner \"almost all the variety of fish and flesh other country here affords, and sometimes pyes were served.\" \"Small-beer and cyder\" were the usual table drinks, though milk was provided at supper. Variety and wholesome nourishment were promised, by proscptive students were warned not to expect \"luxurious danties, or costly delicacies,\" and private meals were not permitted in student chambers. Some \"young gentlemen,\" however, were allowed \"to make a dish of tea in their apartments, provided it be done after evening prayer [and does] not interfere with hours of study.\"\"\n\n---James Madison: A Biography, Ralph Ketcham [MacMillan:New York] 1971 (p. 33)\n\nEarly marriage tables\n\n\"The Madisons spent three winter seasons in Philadelphia...'They breakfasted at nine o'clock on ham or salt fish, herring,....coffee or tea, and slices of toast or untoasted bread spread with butter.

Scholars examine primary documents from different angles with specific agendas. Some come close; others take liberties. The War of 1812 was complicated. We examined primary, secondary, and presidential culinary history sources for this particular question. While they generally cite the same primary sources, they return conflicting accounts; some of which do not make sense.\n\nStandard stories\n\n\"President's House, 11 P.M., Wednesday, August 24. [Robert] Ross need not have placed the order for food. Moving on to the President's House, the British walked unmolested through the front door and found the mansion deserted, but ready to host visitors. The table in the state dining room was set for dinner for forty. Plate holders by the fireplace were filled with dishes; knives, forks, and spoons were laid out; and fine wine poured into cut-glass decanters was chilling on ice on the sideboard. Unfamiliar with Dolley Madison's hospitality, the British assumed the Americans had prepared a victory banquet. The sight tickled Ross's Irish fancy. 'So unexpected was our entry and capture of Washington, and so confident was Madison (President of the States) of the defeat of our troops, that he had prepared for supper for the expected conquerors; and when our advance party entered the president's house they found a table laid with 40 covers.' he delightedly wrote his brother-in-law, Ned Glascock. 'The fare, however, which was intended for Jonathan was voraciously devoured by John Bull, and the health of the Prince Regent, and success to His majesty's arms by sea and land, was drunk in the best wines, Madison having taken to his heels and ensured his safety on the opposite bank of the river...' Exuberant toasts were offered: 'Peace with America--war with Madison, ' proposed Ross. 'Nor was Mr. Madison's health forgotten, in his own best claret, for being so good a fellow as to leave us such capital supper,' recalled Major Norman Pringle, commander of the 21st Regiment Genadier Company. Lieutenant Scott, exhausted and feverish with heat and thirst, picked up a crystal goblet of madeira and gulped it down. He pronounced it 'super-excellent,' The men, including a company of hungry Fusiliers, wolfed down the food.\"\n\n---Through the Perilous Fight: Six Weeks That Saved the Nation, Steve Vogel [Random House:New York] 2013 (p 178-179)\n\n\"With an army encamped just east of the Capitol, Ross and Cockburn lead a contingent of redcoats through the silent city to the White House, where, entering the dining-room, they found the banquet table set as Jennings had left it, decanters cooling on the sideboard. In the kitchen, 'spits, loaded with joints of various sorts stood before the fire; pits, saucepans, and other culinary utensils stood on the grate with all other requisites for and elegant and substantial repast. The invaders helped themselves gratefully. Having enjoyed this fortuitous hospitality, and toasted the king in presidential wine, they systematically ransacked the other rooms, robbed the cellars of their bottles, then prepared to burn the place down.\"\n\n---The Scorching of Washington: The War of 1812, Alan Lloyd [Robert B. Luce Co.:Washington] 1974 (p. 171)\n\n\"It was midnight on the evening of August 24, 1814, by the time the British arrived at the President's House, where they were met by a surprise: an elegant and elaborate dinner laid out as if for their arrival...major General Robert Ross...reported that the dinner 'intended for Jonathon was voraciously devoured by John Bull.' Every account praised the quality of the president's excellent wine, used to toast the health of the Prince Regent.\"\n\n---1812: A Nation Emerges, Sidney Hart & Rachel L Penman [Smithsonisan Institution Scholarly Press:Washington DC] 2012 (p. 165) ?\n\nThe myth\n\n\"In 1814, when the British were advancing on and burning the Capitol City, she was among the last to leave. Finally, at the frantic urging of servants, she came down from from the roof of the White House, her spyglass in hand, gathered together valuable state papers, ordered the Stuart portrait of Washington taken from the wall, wrote a letter to her sister, and, dressed as a farmer's wife, left the city in a wagon and spent the night in an army tent.\"\n\n---The White House Cookbook, edited by Janet Halliday Ervin [Follett Publishing Company:Chicago IL] 1964 (p. 323)\n\n[NOTE: Dolley Madison did have a spyglass but she was across the river at a friend's house, not on the White House roof.] ?\n\nRevisiting the story: a study of primary sources.\n\n\"The legendary Madison entertaining gave rise to the story that even when the British were descending on Washington, about to set it afire during the War of 1812, Dolley was in the midst of plans for a dinner party. An English writer, Gleig, said that the British troops arrive at the Executive Mansion and 'found a bountiful dinner spread for forty guests. This they concludes was for the American officers who were expected to return victorious from the field at Bladenburg.' One assumes that if the report is true, the British consumed the meal before plundering and burning the White House. While this is an intriguing story, there is nothing on record that substantiates it. The White House was burned August 24, 1814, and Dolley's letter of August 23 to her sister indicates that she had dozens of things on their mind--but not a dinner party. What perhaps gave currency to the feasting-while-the-capital-burns story was a book published in 1865 called A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison. The author was Paul Jenings, a slave of Madison's, and in the book he corroborated Gleig's report of the dinner. Jenings was there at the time and wrote: 'I set the table myself.' Still, he wrote many years after the incident had supposedly occurred, and memory in an old man plays tricks.\" ---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnall's:New York] 1968 (p. 83)\n\n[NOTE: This information was also published in the book In and Out of the White House/Ona Griffin Jeffries [Wilfred Funk:New York] 1960 (p. 60, 62)\n\n\"To the delight and surprise of the hungry British soldiers, the dining table was loaded with viands choice enough to spread before a gourmet like the Prince Regent. It was laid out for a banquet of forty persons--a sizable dinner company even for entertainers like the Madisons. For the British home public the most amusing feature of the invasion was that the American President had ordered an elaborate dinner which he through to enjoy a at leisure with his friends and Army officers in celebration of the deliverance of the capital city. No doubt it was the merriment of the British which caused the banquet story to be denied so emphatically by American sources, including some of the members of Madison's staff, who refused to concede that the President's meal, prepared for cabinet members, dignitaries and generals, was eaten by privates of the wrong army. The first reference to the banquet was contained in a letter from a British midshipman published in a London newspaper. The historian of the 44th Regiment relates the story. Gleig adhered to it sixty-odd years later, after the various reasons why it was challenged were submitted to him . His description ran: 'Several kinds of wine, in handsome glass decanters, were cooling on the sideboard. Plate holders stood by the fireplace, filled with dishes and plates; knives, forks and spoons were arranged for immediate use; in short, everything was ready for the entertainment of a ceremonious party. In the kitchen spits loaded with joints of various sorts, turned before the fire. Pots, saucepans and other culinary utensils stood upon the grate, and all the other requisites for an elegant and substantial repast, were exactly in a state which indicated that they had been lately and precipitately abandoned. Jean P. Sioussa, a refugee of the French Revolution known around the President's house as 'French John,' formerly a retainer of the British minister, Anthony Merry, served as Madison's doorkeeper at the time of the invasion. He repudiated the entire banquet story. Nothing was in the kitchen when the British came, he asserted, except a little meat. One wonders that the matter has been considered of sufficient importance for all the inquires and denials, but controversies lead to re-examinants and conclusions. The British did, in fact, find a banquet awaiting for them. One of the enlightening accounts of what occurred at the President's house before the coming of the British has been supplied by Madison's body slave, Paul Jennings. In his pamphlet, A Colored man's Reminiscences of James Madison, Jennings tells how he had set the table on the afternoon of August 24 and had 'brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in coolers, as all the cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers were expected.' Mrs. Madison had informed him that dinner would be ready at the regular hour of three, when the President, who ordinarily ate no supper, dined. The slave's account leaves no doubt that a large meal was in prospect, and that it was ordered by either the President or his wife. The question of who ordered it might have been answered had Admiral Cockburn preserved the trinkets and souvenirs he took from the executive palace. They included penciled notes Madison had written to Mrs. Madison from Bladensburg battlefield.\"\n\n---Poltroons and Patriots: A Popular Account of the War of 1812, Glenn Tucker, Volume 2 [Bobbs-Merrill Company:Indianapolis IN] 1954 (p. 563-564)\n\n? Mr. Jenning's own words\n\n\"Well, on the 24th of August, sure enough, the British reached Bladensburg, and the fight began between 11 and 12. Even that very morning General Armstrong assured Mrs. Madison there was no danger. The President, with General Armstrong, General Winder, Colonel Monroe, Richard Rush, Mr. Graham, Tench Ringgold, and Mr. Duvall, rode out on horseback to Bladensburg to see how things looked. Mrs. Madison ordered dinner to be ready at 3, as usual ; I set the table myself, and brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in the coolers, as all the Cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers were expected.\"\n\n---A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison, Paul Jennings [1865]\n\n[NOTE: No mention here of number of place settings, food, or kitchen cooking.]\n\nPrimary sources\n\nWhite House History: Burning of the White House (64 pps)\n\n...includes a copy of Dolley Madison's letter, with historical critique as to when it was written and accuracy.\n\nBackground from the White House, including links to selected primary documents, here\n\n...includes primary documents from Jennings & Gleig.\n\nWhat is the \"real\" truth?\n\nHard to say. In this case, primary documents/eyewitness accounts support different national agendas. Scholars generally agree that neither James or Dolley Madison were on White House (President's house) grounds the night of the fire. If a table was set for dinner (@3, the normal time for formal main meal of the day), it makes no sense it would be sizzling in the kitchen ready-to-go when the British torchers arrived at 11PM. Especially when the President & his wife were not at home. The story of finding the table set for 40 covers may be plausible because it might have been standard protocol at that time. The idea of ransacking arsonists sitting down to a nicely prepared feast before completing their assignment is a stretch. On the other hand, if food was out, hungry soldiers would have done a grab & go. The story of British soldiers consuming Madison's bar is very believable.\n\nNeed to make something for class?

Popular American history generally credits Dolley Madison for initiating the Easter Egg roll/hunt in Washington D.C. Hillary Clinton's official statements (below) perpetuate the myth. Serious White House historians and several academic experts respectfully question the validity of this claim based on lack of primary evidence.\n\n\"One delightful piece of Dolleyania has defied accurate documentation to the day: the belief that it was Dolley who inaugurated the tradition of the annual White House Easter egg roll on Easter Monday. Neither Dolly nor any of her contemproaries mentions this event in any document located to date, but true or not, the tradition is now firmly attached to Dolley's White House years. Ethel Stephens Arnett, one of Dolley's more recent biographers, wrote that young John Payne Todd had heard that an egg hunt or roll had been practiced by the Egyptians and suggested that his mother adopt the game for him and his friends. \"Dolley liked the idea,\" Arnett wrote, \"and with her own hand tinted hundreds of hard-boiled eggs in bright colors, invited the children of the earea to come and play with them, and thus started the Easter Egg Hunt on the White House lawn. She is said by some to have started the tradition on the grounds of the Capitol. In the original version of the egg roll, children brought baskets of colored hard-boiled eggs and sat in long rows...White House historian, William Seale, researched the tradition and wrote that President Rutherford B. Hayes \"had begun the tradition of rolling Easter Eggs on the White House lawn. This Easter Monday custom had originated at the Capitol many years before; now one remembering exactly when.\"\n\n---Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolley Madison, Richard N. Cote (p. 362-363).\n\n[NOTES: (1) this book is accessible via GoogleBooks; (2) the Arnett book is Mrs. James Madison; the Incomparable Dolley.]\n\n\"MRS. CLINTON: Well, I'm so glad to see all of you here. And this year we've done a few things a little differently to try to make it even better for all of you. You know, the very first Easter Egg Roll took place in 1809. Now, how many of you were here for that one? (Laughter.) Good. That was Dolly Madison who started it in 1809, and it used to be at the Capitol. And then it was moved here to the White House. And every year the Monday after Easter is when we do this.\"\n\n---NARA.\n\nJames Monroe\n\nJames Monroe, like Thomas Jefferson, acquired a taste for French cuisine while serving abroad.

He also enjoyed dishes from his native Virginia.\n\n\"On the Monroe family plantation in Virginia...[Elizabeth Monroe] served many old Southern recipes, dishes her husband hand known from boyhood. One of the most famous, spoon bread, dates back to early Indian days...James Monroe, like his former teacher and mentor, Thomas Jefferson, was fond of Continental cuisines, but he was equally fond of the foods of his Virginia childhood...Chicken Fried with Rice...[was] used frequently by Elizabeth Monroe at the Monroe plantation, Oak Hill...Hot breads and biscuts were a way of life in James Monroe's Virginia... \"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon & Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 97-103)\n\nWhat to make for class?\n\nMonroe Family recipes.

His culinary education had certainly been extensive...Yet throughout the Adamas diary rood references are sparse.

Then General Andrew Jackson and his wife Rachel will arrive in a carriage. It's The Three Stars Collation & Frolicking Preview Party at The Aeneas Building that will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will recreate the historic evening of Sept. 18, 1825, when Jackson and his wife were wined and dined by the city's residents. Jon Meacham, editor of Newsweek magazine, is honorary chairman. Chairwomen for the event are Roberta Price, Patty Lewis and May Scott. The evening's menu will include some of Jackson's favorites: Spiced round of tenderloin with mini biscuits and jezebel sauce; hot water corn cakes with caramelized onions & squash relish, roasted lamb chops with rosemary, hoppin' John, cheese and grapes, benne wafers, floating islands and mini-custard tarts. ...The exhibit curator is Dr. Larry Ray, an art historian specializing in the history of interiors and decorative arts. The collection comes from across Tennessee, including the Tennessee State Museum. ...But he also was a man who had a French chef and enjoyed French wines. He was as familiar with the fine art of cooking as he was with the fine art of hunting men in war. Gala co-chair Patty Lewis said the event will include fall decorations, \"quilt tops, pumpkins of all varieties, mums and bittersweet. There will be four tablescapes. When you enter the Aeneas Building, you'll see an alcove on the back wall where a portrait of Andrew Jackson by Jordan Stonecipher will be unveiled and presented to the city. The exhibit at The Carnegie will be fabulous, and it's catalogued in a book created by Dr. Ray.\" The event will be a cocktail dinner and buffet with heavy hors d'oeuvres, \"enough to be dinner,\" said Gena Mandle, caterer, who is preparing the meal. \"We're recreating a lot of Jackson's favorites. We brainstormed about what would work and what wouldn't.\" \"We also wanted a menu with items that fit together,\" said Lewis, \"and feasible to serve to 250 people.\" She added that there will be an open bar and wine and beer for guests. Mandle said the floating islands will be lemon raspberry and chocolate mousse with creme anglais. She'll also offer Old Hickory Nut Soup in shot glasses for a taste and mini-trifles of gingerbread, pear and custard. Terry Ford of Lauderdale County, a long-time food historian, researched the menu. Ford has one of the nation's largest collections of cookbooks, some dating from the Middle Ages. ...\"I have quite a large library, and I have presidents' cookbooks on a shelf. There are a lot of menus and recipes of the presidents. Andrew Jackson - a quite colorful fellow - liked a variety of things. He kept a horseshoe-shaped table in the state dining room. He had the finest china, silver and furniture for the East Room. People called him King Andrew because of the magnificence of his culinary banquets,\" Ford said. He liked leg of lamb and lamb chops, particularly with rosemary. The Hermitage had a lot of rabbits, and he was fond of that. He had a French chef. He was not so 'backwoodsy.' There were a lot of things at the White House, oysters on the half shell, blue points, primarily - and they had French wines. Rachel Jackson died of a heart attack Dec. 22 before Jackson's inauguration was held in January, so White House entertaining was handled by Emily Donelson, who became his hostess. Other foods Jackson enjoyed were \"Leather Britches,\" which was green beans cooked with water and bacon, braised wild duck and wild goose and fried apple pies for snacks. \"And he liked fried ham and ham gravy, oh yes,\" said Ford. \"He had an Old Hickory nut soup - that was hickory nuts, hot water and sugar, pound it with a mortar and pestle and make a paste, add water to it, strain it, of course.\" The floating islands involved whipping up a meringue and having boiled custard underneath. \"Sometimes you add sherry and almond flavoring to it and sometimes cake,\" he said. He liked to serve his White House guests Daniel Webster's punch, which included lemon, sugar, green tea, brandy, claret, champagne, bananas, orange pineapples, cherries and strawberries. \"Anyone who drank this, one cup would do it,\" Ford chuckled. Ford said the preview party \"is going to be very elaborate and will be quite an event in many ways - and it will be fun.\"\n\nNon-stick vegetable oil spray\n\n1/2 cup sugar\n\n2 large egg whites\n\nFor the mousse: 1/2 cup whipping cream\n\n1/4 cup creme fraiche or whipping cream\n\ncreme anglaise 6 ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate, shaved\n\nassorted berries\n\nMeringue: Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Omelets, spring chicken, pigeons and woodcock, ham and eggs, salmon, beefsteaks, kidneys boiled eggs, and young duck......With only eight months left of Tyler's term of office, Julia decided to make the most of it. Accustomed to the flourishes of high society in Europe, she set about duplicating some the the pageantry she had witnessed there...... Roast ham, a saddle of venison or some other heavy roast, roast wild ducks, or other poultry all were in evidence. Enormous supplies of home-baked cakes and pudding were on hand. Puddings were a great Tyler favorite. Punch, Madeira [a type of wine], and the ubiquitous champagne were ready.\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 167-171) [NOTE: this book contains several recipes in the Tyler chapter, these two puddings among them.]\n\n\"Tyler Pudding-Pie\n\nOf all our Presidents, John Tyler had the most children--seven by his first wife, seven by his second, for a grand total of fourteen.

Under his administration, the first iron cookstove was installed. Prior to this time, all cooking was still conducted colonial-style, with open hearth. These modernizations were not immediately embraced by his staff.\n\n\"We would like to be able to say that Fillmore's single-minded efforts on behalf of the Excecutive Mansion's new stove were merely indicative of his zest for fine food, his appreciation for gourmet repast, his adventurous eating habits. Alas...He had little time for frivolity or luxuries, in dress or food,...By the time he was president, his life patterns were established. Plain food, prepared in a simple, farm style, as part of the pattern...Meat, potatoes, and vegetables were the ingredients of life for the Fillmores...Corn Pudding...has been a favorite dish of simple eaters such as the Fillmores as well as of White House gourmets ...To...Millard Fillmore, it was natural that a good hearty soup would often serve as a full meal...Soup to a New York farm family such as Fillmore's was more of a stew of meat, potatoes, and vegetables; when ready to serve, the solids were removed from the soup kettle to a platter.

He also delighted in Pennsylvania Dutch (German) fare. Below please find historic notes and selected recipes:\n\n\"With the election of President James Buchanan, our only unmarried president, the Capital began the gayest social season in its history. The man in the White House was wealthy, an epicurean, a...bachelor with a flair for society and impeccable knowledge of its ways. The First lady was to be his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, a lovely young lady of twenty-five who had been well prepared and trained for her exciting new role...The White House receptions again became gorgeous displays of finery...Buchanan was so particular about the quality of his food that he had fresh butter sent him regularly from Philadelphia in a locked brass-bound kettle.\"\n\n---The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States, Margaret Brown Klapthor [Parents Magazine Enterprises:New York]1982 revised edition (p. 104-105)\n\n[NOTE: Recipes included in this book: Pennsylvania Dutch Stuffed Shoulder of Pork, Mashed Potatoes, Gooseberry Tart, & Cinnamon Apples.]\n\n\"For a brief moment before the storm of war--the four years before the Civil War--gaiety returned in full force to the White House, after four administrations of deprivation...Buchanan...had had wide exposure to European manners and had developed a certain partiality for French cuisine. He liked the formal elegance of European socitey...The President did not stint on entertaining. For elaborate dinners and receptions he called on the services of Gautier, a French caterer. Gautier had a reputation for the beauty and finesse of his service and preparations as well as the superb quality of his cooking. Gourmets exclaimed over the partridge, terrapin, oysters, lobster, and wild turkey served under his supervision...Frequently, Buchanan was forced to pay the bills for his lavish dinners and receptions out of his own pocket. In spite his innate formality, he did not mind this, for he enjoyed entertaining and wanted to do it well. The biggest social event of Buchanan's four years was surely the visit of England's Prince of Wales to Washington...This was the first visit to the former American colonies of an heir-apparent to the British throne...Two lavish dinner parties were held for the Crown Prince...[at Buchanan's inaugural ball, March 4, 1857]...The five thousand revelers were served eight rounds of beef, seventy-five hams, sixty saddles of mutton, four saddles of venison, four hundred gallons of oysters, five quarts of jellies, twelve hundred quarts of ice cream in assorted flavors, and pates of infinate variety. Three thousand dollars had been spent on the wines. And the high point of the evening was a pyramid of a cake, four feet high and cleverly ornamented with a flag bearing the insignia of every state in the Union...Olympian as this all was, it was still but a hint of the gargantuan banquets of the administration to come. One might think that such quantiites of food would be enough for several armies, but the food actually ran out before the guests had completely given up...Those critics who may have objected to Buchanan's adherence to a formal etiquette had no complaint about the bounty of his service. His dinners were generally \"pronounced superb in manner and style.\" The presidential routine was simpler than his entertaining patterns. He normally rose early, and had an early breakfast, read the newspaper and was buisily at work at his desk by eight o'clock. At five in the afternoon, a brisk your's walk gave him a good appetite for the elaborate dinner that usually followed. Dinner was almost always at the White House...One day a week, some of the cabinet members and their wives were invited to have dinner at the White House en famille [together as a family]....Although not of German stock, President Buchanan enjoyed the specialties prepared by the Pennsylvania Dutch inhabitants of his native state.\"\n\n---Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 220-224)\n\n[NOTE: Recipes included: Terrapin a la Gautier (turtle soup), Boiled Lobster, Calf's Head Dressed as Terrapin, Pannhas (Scrapple), Sauerbraten, Chicken Salad, Duck un Kraut, Pennsylavnia Dutch Succotash, Pennsylania Red Cabbage, Jeff Davis Pie, Confederate Pudding, Confederate Sauce, Moss Rose Cake, Peach Charlotte, Charlotte Russe, Apees & Muscadine (grape) Pie.]\n\nNeed to make something for class?\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nMary Todd Lincoln\n\nLincoln recipes\n\nAbraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural Dinner\n\n\"During several years of collecting material for The Presidents'Cookbook...we ran into all sorts of controversey concerning President Lincoln's habits, his likes and dislikes, when it came to food. Judging from menus of the state balls and banquets given at the White House during Lincoln's Administration--some of the most elaborate in our history--one might conclude that Honest Abe was a gourmet to end all gourmets. Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. Giving the opposite side of the picture, certain observers of the times...said flatly that Lincoln was almost entierely indifferent to food, 'Except that he liked apples and hot coffee.' The President's bodyguard wrote, however, 'Mr. Lincoln was a hearty eater. Her never lost his tates for things that a growing farmer's boy would like. He was particularly fond of bacon.' Probably like most of our strongest Presidents (excepting Jefferson), Lincoln relied on food to feed the furnace. Undoubtedly he ate well when served a tasty meal but was usually so preoccupied that he gave little thought to food. One thing seems certain: hew was a gentle man at the table and uncritical. His stepmother said, 'He ate what was before him, making no complaint.' A companion of his lawyer days, Leonard Sweet, wrote, 'I never in the 10 years of circuit life I knew him heard him complain of a hard bed or a bad meal of victuals.\"\n\n---\"Fast Gourmet: Honest Abe's favorite Food,\" Poppy Cannon, Chicago Daily Defender, February 8, 1968 (p. 22)\n\n\"Just as so much about [Abraham Lincoln's] life has been shrouded in latter-day myth and legend, making it difficult to assess the truth about the man, so, too, have his food habits and tastes been the subject of controversy...It seems to us that the food truth about Lincoln must lie somewhere between these extreme points of view...One aspect of Abraham Lincoln's characteristically gentle nature was apparent in his approach to food... Temprementally...Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln were totally unlike...This was striking apparent when it came to food and food history. Although both came originally from Kentucky, they reflected two completely different Kentucky traditions. Mary had been raised in the lush bluegrass region of the state, where gracious, comfortable living and rich, elaborate cooking were legendary. Abe gew up on the frontier, where he ate very plain food, partly for economic reasons, partly because of the frontier tradition. Corn dodgers, cakes made of coarse cornmeal, were a staple. Wild game provided the protein a growing boy needed. During the days of young manhood, where he boarded at the Rutledge Tavern in New Salem, his diet consisted largely of cornbread, mush, bacon, eggs, and milk. Several friends of that period recalled later that if Abe was partial to any one food it was honey, a great delicacy for him at the time.\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnall's:New York] 1968 (p. 236-7)\n\n\"Family meals at the Lincolns' were routine. Early in the morning the President liked a \"good hot cup of coffee.\" But often he would forget about breakfast until 9 or 10A.M. John Hay, one of Lincoln's privage secretaries, occasionally ate with the President. He noted that the frugal repast might consist of \"an egg, a piece of toast, coffee, etc.\" On occasion breakfast was a single egg. For lunch, Hay reported, Lincoln \"took a little lunch--a biscuit, a glass of milk in winter, some fruit or grapes in summer...He ate less than anyone I know.\" Lunch was usually eaten irregularly...\"\n\n---ibid (p. 239)\n\n[NOTE: This book contains modernized recipes for Lincoln's favorite foods: Nob Creek Kentucky Corn Cakes, Rail Splitters (corn muffins), Nancy Hanks' Steamed Potatoes, Rutledge Tavern Squash Pie, New Salem Fruit Pies, Gooseberry Cobbler etc. Happy to scan/send.]\n\n\"Abraham Lincoln dined in a spartan fashion...He would rather nibble fruit. His wife Mary tried everything to make Abe eat but has frustrated time and time again to see the finest foods left all but untouched on his plate. One of the few entrees that would tempt Lincoln was Chicken Fricassee. He liked the chicken cut up in small pieces, fried with seasonings of nutmeg and mace and served with a gravy made of the chicken drippings. Mary Lincoln set a table at the White House, which included such food as Aspic of Tongue, Pate de Foie Gras, Turkey stuffed with Truffles, and all sorts of wild game, such as venison, pheasant, or canvasback duck. But all too often the President merely picked at his food.\" ---A Treasury of White House Cooking, Francois Rysavy [G. P. Putnam:New York] 1972 (p. 250)\n\nThe gingerbread story, retold by Carl Sandburg:\n\n\"The 'gingerbread story,' which [Lincoln] had mentioned without telling, in one of the debates with Douglas, touched yound and old. ...'When we lived in Indiana,' he said, 'once in a while my mother used to get some sorghum and ginger and make some gingerbread. It wasn't often, and it was our biggest treat. One day I smelled the gingerbread and came into the house to get my share while it was still hot. My mother had baked me three gingerbread men. I took them out under a hickory tree to eat them. There was a family near us poorer than we were, and their boy came along as I sat down. 'Abe,' he said, 'gimme a man?' I gave him one. He crammed it into his mouth in two bites and looked at me while I was biting the legs off my first one. 'Abe,' he said, 'timme the onter'n.' I said to him, 'You seem to like gingerbread.' 'Abe,' he sais, 'I don't s'pose anybody on earth likes gingerbread better'n I do--and gets less'n I do.'\"\n\n---Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years, Carl Sandburg [Harcourt, Brace:New York] 1926, Volume 2, (p. 290)\n\nWhat kind of cook was Mary Todd Lincoln?\n\nMary Todd Lincoln was born to a wealthy family in Lexington Kentucky. As such, she was well schooled in the fine aspects of social etiquette rather than the practical arts of domestic life. Her biographers note Mary's early frugality and preference for simplicity. Her entertainments were well attended and, as one might expect, grew lavish in the White House period. She was especially fond of strawberries, and enjoyed giving strawberry sociables, where these fine fruits were combined with cake and ice cream.\n\n\"By the 1840s improved methods of salting and icing allowed Mary Lincoln to keep food longer than her mother could. Imported oysters, a delicacy on local menus, could be preserved for weeks by bountiful washing in salted water and some help from the weather. A few heretics (Mary Lincoln was not usually one of them) no longer baked bread, depending, instead, on a wagon that delivered bread, crackers, and cakes three times a week. The Springfiled stores were beginning to sell prepared butter, and in season local farmers brought vegetables and fruits down Jackson Street for the unfixed prices that proper ladies were not supposed to contest. Penny-pinching Mary Lincoln was among those who violated the prescription that ladies don't beat down prices, and she had several public battles with the fruit peddler over the prices of his less than perfect strawberries...Lincoln was never a fussy eater, and was satisfied most mornings with an apple for his breakfast. Still, he would be home for dinner in the middle of the day, and only delinquent housekeepers kept men waiting. But in Mary Lincoln's home it was the husband whose casual sense of time and lack of appetite made regular hours an impossibility...Sometimes Abraham helped out by shopping...Even with improved technology and help with marketing, cooking took up the largest part of Mary Lincoln's day. Some Springfield women relished their culinary labors and earned awards at the country fair for their pickles, preserves, cakes and pies...Mary never entered those competitions, or at least she never won a prize. The one household product for which she was remembered--what the family circulated as Mary's recipe for white cake--was a simplified gloss on the more complicated version of a standard cake...Having grown up without practical experience in cooking, Mary relied on Kentucky staples. Years later, amid the haute cuisine of France, she fondly remembered the \"waffles, batter cakes, and egg cornbread--not to mention \"buckwheat cakes\" of Lexington. The Lincoln menu was also full of what Mrs. Trollope disparaged as America's \"sempiternal ham,\" and Mary Lincoln's frugality encouraged the appearance of cheap local game, such as woodchucks, pheasants, and prairie chickens. In any case, she learned to do what the slaves had done in Lexington: roast coffee, make calf's-foot jelly, preserve fruit, and prepare cheese. In the summer the kitchen ran her, and it was both the repetitiveness and the lack of control that led disaffected matrons to compare themselves to slaves...By 1851, after nearly ten years of housekeeping, Mary Lincoln had progressed to an advanced version of Miss Leslie's Cookery, purchasing this, along with Miss Leslie's House Book or Manual of Domestic Economy for Town and Country...In the more difficutlt version there were recipes for everything from family soup to to invalid cookery of beef tea and blackberry preserve...Because she had not learned the vices of sugar and, like everyone in Springfield, innocently belived it the \"most nourishing substance in nature,\" she spent hours making puddings, cakes, candies, and cookies. By modern standards, the Lincoln household consumed a vast amount of sugar...Some of these sweets were eaten by others, for if Mary Lincoln was a novice cook, she was a practiced hostess with an easy charm that obscured any shortcomings in her menus. Her contemporary Julia Jayne Trumbull acknowledged her as the \"prettiest talker in Springfield,\"...\"Mary Lincoln often entertained small numbers of friends at dinner and somewhat larger numbers at evening parties. Her table was famed for the excellence of its rare Kentucky dishes and in season was loaded with venison, wild turkeys, prairie chickens and quail and other game\" ...In her kitchen at Eighth and Jackson Mary Lincoln relied on simple fare, offering her guests not four courses but tea and cakes and strawberries in season. \"This last week, we gave a strawberry company of about seventy,\" she wrote in 1859. \"If your health will admit of venturing out, in such damp weather,\" went one Mary Lincoln invitation, \"we would be much pleased to have you, Mr. B., and the young ladies came round, this eve about seven and pass a social evening.\" By seven Mason and Mary Brayman would have eaten their middle-of-the-day dinner as well as their supper, leaving the hostess responsible only for dessert. Unlike some of her friends and family, Mary Lincoln did not use her cooking for charitable purposes...though she often invited friends from the...church for tea and cakes...By the mid-1850s Lincoln's prominence required substantial entertainments, and with money available from his successful law practice, Mary Lincoln hosted large receptions--what in the East passed a levees. On the prairies, as elsewhere, French was the language of sociability, used by Mary and her friends to distinguish their grandest affairs from the even more elegant soirees or \"grand fetes,\"..Instead, she simply put food on the table, and the crowds poured into the house to eat it...\"\n\n---Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, Jean H.

They are most likely the foods enjoyed by Mrs. Lincoln's family.\n\n\"Mary Todd's Courting Cake\n\n\"Several of Lincoln's biographers mention the burnt sugar cake Mary Todd prepared for him when he came courting. Many recipes purport to be Mary's own. This one...can actually be traced down through the Todd family to Mary Hosford, a granddaughter of one of Mary's cousins, who included it in her Missouri Traveler Cookbook. [FT Editor Note: This recipe appears on in a chapter titled \"Jane,\" p. 16-19 of The Missouri Traveler Cookbook. \"Jane\" is an African-American cook. Ms. Hosford states the recipe is \"Jane's,\" She does not mention Mary Todd Lincoln anywhere in in the book, which strikes us as odd since the book is liberally sprinkled with family (\"Grandma Hebel\") and celebrity references (Tommy Dorsey).]\n\nSugar\n\nCaramelized sugar syrup\n\nEgg whites\n\nButter\n\nBaking powder\n\nCake flour\n\nSalt\n\nVanilla\n\nOne begins by 'burning' the sugar. Melt 1/2 cup sugar in a heavy iron skillet. Heat slowly, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, until the sugar becomes a very dark brown. Then add 1/2 cup hot water and stir until sugar dissolves. This is the caramelized sugar you will use in the cake. Now beat 3 egg whites until very stiff, adding to them a little ast a time 1/2 cup white sugar. Set aside. In another bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup white sugar. Add 2 teaspoons baking powder to 1 1/2 cups cake flour, along with a dash of salt. Sift together then add to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the caramelized sugar syrup--first a little flour, then a little syrup, until all have been used. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Flavor with 1 teaspoon vanilla and bake in 2 greased and floured 8-inch cake pans. Bake about 45 minutes in a preheated moderate (350 degree F.) oven.\n\nFrosting for Mary Todd's Courting Cake\n\nMelted butter\n\nDark brown sugar\n\nMilk\n\nPowdered sugar\n\nBlack walnuts (optional)\n\nMelt 1/2 cup butter in a heavy saucepan. Add 1 cup dark brown sugar and cook over low heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, add 1/3 cup milk and bring to a boil again. Cool to lukewarm and stir in gradually 2 cups powdered sugar. Beat vigorously until mixture is smooth. This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of an 8-inch layer cake. If you like, even though it isn't strictly authentic, sprinkle black walnuts over the frosting. Delicious even if not Toddian.\n\nMary Todd's Vanilla Almond Cake\n\nThere are reports attributable to President Lincoln that this cake of his wife's was the best he ever ate...This delicious cake was the invention of Monsieur Giron, a Lexington [KY] caterer, who created it in honor of the visit to that city in 1825 of his fellow Frenchman, Lafayette. The Todd family acquired the recipe and cherished it ever after. The baking powder must have been added at a later date.\n\nSugar\n\nButter\n\nFlour\n\nBaking powder\n\nMilk\n\nBlanched almonds\n\nEgg whites\n\nVanilla (or almond extract)\n\nCream together 2 cups sugar with 1 cup butter. Sift 3 cups flour and 3 teaspoons baking powder three times and add to the butter-sugar mixture alternately with 1 cup milk. Chop 1 cup blanched almonds until very fine and add them to the mixture. Beat vigorously, then fold in 6 stiffly beaten egg whites carefully. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, then fold in 6 stiffly beaten egg whites carefully. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla (almond extract if you prefer) and pour the mixture into a greased and floured angel-cake pan. Bake in a a preheated moderate (350 degree F.) oven for approximately 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the cake's center. Turn the cake out on a wire rack and allow to cool before frosting it. This makes a very large cake. If you prefer, you can bake it in 2 9-inch layer-cake pans. The cake may be made without the almonds and is a splendid plain white cake, very light and good.\n\nMary Todd's Candied Fruit Frosting\n\nEgg whites\n\nSugar\n\nWater\n\nVanilla (or almond extract)\n\nSalt\n\nCandied pineapple\n\nCrystallized cherries\n\nBeat 2 egg whites until very stiff. Set aside for a moment. Beat together 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water until the syrup spins a thread about five inches long. Then slowly fold into the egg whites, a spoonful at a time, very slowly, beating well with an electric beater as you add. Beat at top speed (very hard if you use a hand beater) until all the syrup is used and the mixture forms peaks when dropped from a spoon. When stiff, slowly add 1 teaspoon vanilla or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Fold into the mixture 1/2 cup diced candied pineapple and 1/2 cup crystallized cherries cut in half. Spread between the layers and over the top and sides of the vanilla almond cake. If desired, the candied fruit may be eliminated. The frosting is delicious without them.\"\n\n---The Presidents' Cookbook, Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks [Funk & Wagnalls:New York] 1968 (p. 256-258)\n\nAbraham Lincoln's second inauguration supper: an eyewitness account\n\nAbraham Lincoln's second Inauguration was recounted in several magazines and newspapers by a variety of reporters. The New York Times reporter was not named. Just noted as \"Special Correspondence.\" We wonder who he (or she) was? Clearly, the meal was a disaster.\n\n\"The Supper. It had been rumored--and the foundation for the report was only rumor--that the supper was to be something extraordinary. We were suprised at this, because we knew good taste and modern custom, in small places like New-York, have, of late years, literally eschewed the practice of immense suppers at public balls; and this reform had been reconcilated by the fact that such attempts had generally ended in catastrophes to the toilets and tempers of all participants. It was, therefore, with misgivings that we saw it announced that a grand supper would be served in one of the corridors of the extensive building. The American people, in general, we are ashamed to say, have not yet learned how to behave at table; and that species of etiquette, not too prevalent in private, is certainly always absent at public suppers. So it was not strange that we should have had warning visions of a grand rush, then a crush, and a demolition in the twinkling of an eye of all th confectioner's handiwork, the frantic snatching of viands from the tables, the brandishing aloft of wine cup, and plate, and cutlery, laden with article alike dangerous to toilet and stomach; of munching and crunching sans ceremonie; of defilement and ruin to precious apparel, the result perhaps of weeks of the dressmaker's effort; of the loss of temper, and loud cries of complaint. And indeed, we harbored a fear as a consequence that a graceful assemblage of dignified ladies and gentlemen might be transformed, as if by the wand of some evil spirit, into a social raffle, where he who was rudest should be most successful in appeasing the cravings of the appetite, and in pocketing the delicate ornamentations of the table.\n\n\"The name of the cuisiner has escaped us, and it is not worth while to hand it up now. Suffice it to say it was not Delmonico, therefore we did not expect perfection. The hall set apart for supper was the grand corridor in the west wing. The table was set in the centre, and it gave standing-room for about three hundred persons one time. The cabinets of the works of genius and invention, placed at intervals, served to form alcoves on each side of the supper-table. On one side, some of these were provided with seats; on the other, they were reserved for depositing the extraordinary quantity of material necessary for such a host, and for the operations of the waiters.\n\n\"The ornamentation of the table, though limited in extent, was in excellent taste, and perhaps quite as profuse os the unfortunately small space devoted to the supper would permit. There were three leading and conspicuous pieces form the confectioner's hands, placed at approprote points in the centre and at each end of the table; in the centre, our imposing Capitol--perfect in minature; at one end an exquisite representation of the heroic deeds of the gallant army; at the other, a similar device of the proud achievements of the navy. The representation of the Capitol was admirably executed; no detail seemed to be too minute for imitation. Even the lamps at the entrance seemed to give forth light. The columns, pedastals, cornices, frieses, entablatures, windows, situary, and the majectis dome, and towering above all else, the Goddess of Liberty, were all there as perfect as mould and model could make them. In addition, there were several allegorical representations of the progress of civilization, the genius, the arts, the sciences and literature of the day. The piece on the right was in honor of the army; and the glory and fame of the defenders of our liberty were illustrated by a pyramid, around which were clustered in tasteful profusion all the insignia of war, the paraphernalia of battle and the emblem of victory. The navy was honored in the same manner, the representation being surmounted with Admiral Farragut's old flagship Hartford, gallantly riding the withe crested waves, while aloft might be seen the Admiral himself lashed to the rigging, emblematical of the old hero's achievements in the Bay of Mobile; then battered Fort Sumter, the sad epitome of secession; then Neptune with chariot and trident, and the Goddess of Liberty, inspiring the brave sailor to greater glory and higher fame. There were other ornamentations, principally pyramids of which the detail is unimportant, for nougats, croquant, and chocolate are the same here as elsewhere. The bill of fare provided a select and tasteful variety, and no better idea of it can be obtained than by inserting it right here verbatim.\n\nBill of Fare.\n\nOyster stews, terrapin stews, oysters pickled; beef--roast beef, filet of beef, beef a la mode, beef a l'anglais; veal--leg of veal, fricandeau, veal Malakoff; poultry--roast turkey, boned turkey, roast chicken; grouse--boned and roast; game--pheasant, quuail, venison, patetes, patetes of duck en gelee, pate de fois gras; smoked ham, tongue en gelee, tongue plain; salades, chicken, lobster; ornamental pyramids--nougate, orange, caramel with vany cream candy, coconut, macaroon, croquant, chocolate; three cakes--cakes and tarts, almond soonge, belle alliance, dame blanche, macaroon tart, tart a la Nelson, tarte a l'Orleans, tarte a la Portuguese, tarte a la Vienne, pound cake, sponge cake, lady cake, fancy small cakes; jellies and creams--calf's foot and wine jelly, Charlotte a la Russe, Charlotte a la vanilla blanc mange, creme Neapolitiane, creme a la Nelson, creme Chateaubrand, creme a la Smyrna, crreme a la Nesslefored, bombe a la vanilla, ice cream, vanilla, lemon, white coffee, chocolate, burnt almonds, maraschino, fruit ices, crabeerry, orange, lemon; dessert--grapes, almonds, raisins &c., coffee and chocolate.\n\n\"This was the programme for the feast. The only thing which did not seem promising was the fact that but three hundred could be confortably accomodated at one time, while there were five thousand persons to be accomodated, and a large majority of them ladies. About the hour of 12, the Presidential party were secorted by a private entrance to the privileged places. Soon afterward the doors were opened, and a throng of more than a thousand, who had collected at that end of the hall, poured into the supper-room . Of course, when three persons occupy the space barely sufficient for one, a 'crush' is the result; and the crush which followed can better be imagined than depicted.\n\n\"But this was not the worst feature. With the indecency of conduct and want of politeness and etiquette which charcterizes man American people at table, and which is the certain accompaniment of a large grows at a public supper, many gentlemen, and ladies, seized upon the most ornamental and least nutritious part of the table decorations, demolished them, carried the pieces off in a handkerchief or crushed them under foot. Then the more substantial viands were served likewise. Large dishes of choice meats, tatetes, saldes and jellies were carried off vi et armis into the alcoves, or elsewhere. One gentleman presented a very ludicrous attitude with a large plate of smoked tongue, requiring both hands to hold it, no place to sit down, and no way to eat it! He looked the picture of despair.\n\n\"In less than an hour the tables was a wreck; a few ornaments not destroyed were removed, and the array of empty dishes and the debris of the feast were postitively frightful to behold. The doors were now wide open, and hundreds of ladies in elegant silks, satins and velvets, and gentlemen in dainty broadcloath, surged and struggled back and forth. A few obtained something to eat, others very little, and many more only succeded in ruing their toilets. As much was wasted as was eaten, and however much may have been provided more than half the guests went supperless. By it was a public supper; we were not much disappointed, and though the gentlemen who managed it may have been to blame for the want of room, the fact remains that the supper was a disaster, and detracted from the otherwise pleasant aspect of the occasion.\" ---\"The Inauguration Ball,\" The New York Times, March 8, 1865 (p. 1)\n\n[NOTES: (1) The word \"toilet\" in this period meant personal grooming.
