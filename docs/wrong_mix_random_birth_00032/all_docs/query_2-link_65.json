We report the longitudinal evolutionary analysis of 126 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours from 421 prospectively recruited patients in TRACERx who developed metastatic disease, compared with a control cohort of 144 non-metastatic tumours. In 25% of cases, metastases diverged early, before the last clonal sweep in the primary tumour, and early divergence was enriched for patients who were smokers at the time of initial diagnosis. Simulations suggested that early metastatic divergence more frequently occurred at smaller tumour diameters (less than 8 mm). Single-region primary tumour sampling resulted in 83% of late divergence cases being misclassified as early, highlighting the importance of extensive primary tumour sampling. Polyclonal dissemination, which was associated with extrathoracic disease recurrence, was found in 32% of cases. Primary lymph node disease contributed to metastatic relapse in less than 20% of cases, representing a hallmark of metastatic potential rather than a route to subsequent recurrences/disease progression. Metastasis-seeding subclones exhibited subclonal expansions within primary tumours, probably reflecting positive selection. Our findings highlight the importance of selection in metastatic clone evolution within untreated primary tumours, the distinction between monoclonal versus polyclonal seeding in dictating site of recurrence, the limitations of current radiological screening approaches for early diverging tumours and the need to develop strategies to target metastasis-seeding subclones before relapse. A longitudinal evolutionary analysis of 126 lung cancer patients with metastatic disease reveals the timing of metastatic divergence, modes of dissemination and the genomic events subject to selection during the metastatic transition.",

        "text": "The TRACERx 421 cohort\n\nThe TRACERx study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01888601) is a prospective observational cohort study that aims to transform our understanding of NSCLC, the design of which has been approved by an independent research ethics committee (13/LO/1546). Informed consent for entry into the TRACERx study was mandatory and obtained from every patient. All patients were assigned a study identity number that was known to the patient. These were subsequently converted to linked study identities such that the patients could not identify themselves in study publications. All human samples (tissue and blood) were linked to the study identity number and barcoded such that they were anonymized and tracked on a centralized database, which was overseen by the study sponsor only.\n\nThe cohort represents the first 421 patients whose primary tumour and metastatic samples were received for processing, who met the eligibility criteria as outlined in ref. 17 and from whom collected tumour samples could be sequenced prospectively according to the filtering steps outlined in the CONSORT diagram (CONSORT flow chart; Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\nSample processing\n\nSample extraction and sequencing\n\nFresh frozen\n\nSample extraction and sequencing for fresh frozen samples is summarized in the accompanying Article17. Where smaller samples were acquired (for example, core or endobronchial ultrasound guided biopsies), multiregion sequencing was not performed. For sequencing of fresh frozen recurrence/progression samples, paired germline DNA was resequenced in the same run, using germline DNA from aliquots extracted at recruitment.\n\nFFPE\n\nFor every formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block, 2 × 20 μm sections of Cresyl-Violet stained slides were acquired and mounted onto Leica glass slides with a polyethylene naphthalate membrane (4 μm, 27 × 76 mm), sandwiching a 5 μm haematoxylin and eosin slide, which was used to guide dissection. The area was marked by a histopathologist, and any lesions of less than 3 mm in diameter underwent laser-capture microdissection, with larger lesions undergoing macrodissection with a sterile scalpel.\n\nDNA was extracted within 48 h of micro/macrodissection using the Qiagen GeneRead FFPE DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This kit contains the UNG (uracil-N glycosilase) to minimize FFPE-associated C > T artefacts. The DNA was quantified (Qubit; Invitrogen) and quality-assessed (TapeStation; Agilent technologies) and only samples with a DNA integrity number of greater than 2 were used for downstream processing. The samples were mechanically sheared using the Covaris instrument in a 0.1 mM EDTA buffer solution. Libraries were prepared using 50–200 ng of sheared DNA as input for a modified version of the KAPA HyperPrep library preparation kit (Roche). Modifications included the incorporation of the Agilent SureSelect XT oligo adapters and primers. The remainder of the protocol was performed according to the fresh frozen TRACERx WES sequencing pipeline, with 7–9 PCR cycles used to amplify the DNA to the required 750 ng for hybridization. Sequencing was performed as for the fresh frozen samples, although no additional germline sequencing was performed.\n\nBioinformatics pipeline\n\nThe bioinformatics pipeline, including quality-control checks, filtering of low confidence variants and phylogenetic reconstruction, used for data analysis is summarized in the accompanying Article17. When combining the primary tumour and metastasis regions, the resulting mutation calls and somatic copy-number segmentation may differ from the output of analysing the primary tumour regions alone. These changes could affect downstream analyses, including WGD calls, mutation clustering and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Similar to the accompanying Article, unless otherwise specified, we limit our phylogenetic-based analyses to the default tree topology, even if multiple tree solutions were reconstructed.\n\nFor FFPE samples, modifications to the somatic copy-number aberration detection pipeline were incorporated to address the increase in the fluctuations seen in FFPE-sample logR segmentation. The mean logR value for all SNPs within a BAF segment was assigned as the segmented logR value for that BAF segment. Many small segments remained after this adjustment. These small segments corresponded to logR segments that do not have heterozygous SNPs within them and, therefore, no corresponding BAF segments. Each of these non-BAF segments was subsequently compared to its preceding or following segment within the same chromosome, and joined to the segment with the closest mean logR value until there were no logR-only segments present. The overall mean logR in the newly joined segments was recalculated and used for downstream analyses. Finally, segments corresponding to the lowest logR values (<5% of the sample) were removed.\n\nAnalysis\n\nTiming divergence\n\nPhylogenetic-based definitions\n\nTiming of divergence was performed relative to the last clonal sweep in the primary tumour. A summary of how individual mutation clusters were defined as clonal, subclonal and absent in individual tumour regions can be found in our accompanying Article17. Briefly, clusters that were clonal in all regions of interest (i.e. all primary regions, or all metastatic samples) were defined as clonal within the primary or metastases, respectively. Clusters that were subclonal or absent from at least one region of interest were defined as subclonal, while clusters that were absent from all regions of interest were defined as absent at the tumour level. The total number of mutations associated only to clusters defined as clonal across all primary tumour regions was calculated. For each metastatic sample, the total number and proportion of primary-clonal mutations that were also clonal in the metastasis was computed. If this proportion was less than one, meaning that not all primary-clonal mutations were defined as clonal in the metastatic sample, the metastasis was classified as early diverging. By contrast, if all primary-clonal mutations were clonal within the metastasis, the metastasis was defined as late diverging.\n\nIf multiple metastatic sites were sampled for a patient, the case-level classification of the timing of divergence was performed analogously by estimating the metastasis-level clonality. Thus, if all metastatic samples were defined as late diverging, the overall classification would also be late divergence, whereas, if at least one metastatic sample was defined as early diverging, the overall timing would also be early.\n\nRegion-based presence/absence of mutations\n\nAn orthogonal region-based approach was used to define the mutations present in all primary tumour regions (primary-ubiquitous). All mutation loci overlapping genomic segments of LOH in any region were filtered out.\n\nSimilar to the phylogeny-defined method, the proportion of primary-ubiquitous mutations shared with the metastatic samples was calculated. This proportion was compared in the phylogeny-defined early- and late divergence cases.\n\nLOH-based definitions\n\nThe timing of divergence of metastases was also examined using LOH. If a primary tumour clonal LOH event occurred (that is, lost in all cells in the primary tumour or is ubiquitously lost in the primary tumour), a metastasis that does not demonstrate the same LOH event must have diverged earlier as such events cannot be regained later in tumour evolution.\n\nAllele-specific arm-level LOH events were defined as primary-ubiquitous if the same allele was lost in all primary tumour regions. Arm-level loss was defined as ≥75% of the chromosome arm being lost. The proportion of primary-ubiquitous LOH events shared in the metastases was compared in the phylogeny-defined early and late divergence cases.\n\nWGD-based definitions\n\nPrimary tumours with a clonal WGD (that is, the same WGD event in all primary regions17) were identified and the WGD status of the paired metastases was explored. A metastasis was defined as diverging early if no WGD was seen in the metastasis, or a separate WGD event was identified. Metastases were defined as having diverged late if the same WGD event detected in the primary tumour regions was identified in the metastases.\n\nSampling bias\n\nTo determine the effect of primary-tumour sampling bias on the timing of metastatic divergence, all cases defined as late divergence were considered. For each such case, given n primary regions, all possible combinations of primary tumour region downsampling were considered between 1 and n-1 regions.\n\nFor each single region, the clonal clusters defined in the single region were considered and the proportion of shared clonal mutations between the single region and the metastases was calculated, as described above.\n\nSimilarly, when downsampling to two regions, all possible combinations of two out of n regions were considered and the percentage of clonal mutations, as defined across the two regions, shared with the metastases was calculated. Finally, the average percentage of shared clonal mutations was computed across all possible combinations to determine the timing of divergence.\n\nThis approach was repeated until n −1 regions were considered, and the average proportion of shared clonal mutations as well as the classification of the timing of divergence were highlighted.\n\nSignature detection\n\nMutations private to the recurrences or progression samples were fit to deconstructSigs (v.1.9.0)44. Mutation counts were normalized using the ‘exome2genome’ parameter within the package. COSMIC Mutational Signatures v.3.2—in particular, SBS1, SBS2, SBS4, SBS5, SBS13, SBS17b, SBS18 and SBS92, which are signatures found to be active in lung cancer genomes45, and SBS31 and SBS35, related to cisplatin exposure6,46—were used to reconstruct the mutational profiles. Only samples with more than 50 mutations were included. Thus, of the 67 recurrence/progression samples from 48 patients, only 20 samples from 19 patients were included.\n\nModelling\n\nA previously existing agent-based model of tumour growth and evolution9,47 was adapted to simulate the timing and mode of metastasis divergence. In brief, the original model simulates the growth of a tumour through the division of individual cells which accumulate mutations at a set mutation rate. The tumour grows in populations or ‘demes’ of 5,000 cells until it reaches a size of 109 cells, when the simulation stops. The simulated tumour is then ‘sampled’ in 8 regions of around 50,000 cells. For each region, exome sequencing is simulated taking into account sequencing error rates for standard Illumina short read sequencing and a mean depth of coverage of 400×, similar to that used in the sequencing of the TRACERx cohort. The simulation produces a file with the minor allele frequency of the detected mutations in each sample.\n\nThe model used here was modified from the original to include a dynamic selection landscape. Each individual cell has a fitness value associated with it, which controls its probability of dividing. A cell will divide if its fitness divided by the maximum fitness in the deme is larger than a random number between 0 and 1 drawn from a uniform distribution. Cells with large fitness values will therefore be more likely to divide than those with lower values. Moreover, division will be more likely in demes with low populations and will become increasingly unlikely as the deme approaches its population limit of 5,000 cells. Given that the growth rate is a combination of the division and death rates, the death rate was fixed to avoid further increasing the stochasticity of the model. The death rate of 0.2 was chosen so that the modeled mutation burden was comparable to the mutation burden observed in the TRACERx cohort.\n\nThe fitness effect of each mutation is drawn from a distribution of fitness effects (DFE) defined by an asymmetric Laplace distribution centred around 0, and skewed towards negative values, based on the DFE measured in different somatic evolution systems48,49,50. The global selection coefficient defined the mean of the exponential distribution of negative fitness effects, whereas the mean of the exponential distribution of positive fitness effects was half this value. The global selection coefficient therefore controls the spread of the DFE. Furthermore, the possibility of driver mutations was added where a mutation could have a positive fitness effect 10 times larger than the global selection coefficient with a probability of 10−5, the mutation rate of driver mutations for somatic evolution in cancer51. A global selection coefficient set to 0.01, the maximum selection coefficient used in all simulations, would result in a DFE for normal mutations ranging from −0.07 to 0.02, with low probability driver mutations with a fitness effect of around 0.1. These values are similar to those observed in somatic evolution when selection is measured as the relative increase in growth rate49,52. A high global selection coefficient would result in broader DFE distributions and, therefore, more intense selection, whereas a global selection coefficient of 0 would result in neutral evolution, in which none of the mutations have a fitness effect. We also accounted for the fitness effect of large genomic events. The DFE for such events is less well defined but their fitness effects are likely to be vast, given that such events can affect multiple genes at once53. To account for these events, a DFE broader than that used for mutations was defined, whereby the mean of positive fitness effects was twice that of mutations, and three times larger for negative effects. These events therefore had the potential to result in highly positive or negative fitness effects. The probability of such events taking place was set at 0.3 per cell division based on observed rates of genome mis-segregation during cell division54,55. Only cells that had acquired a specific mutation enabling structural rearrangements were affected.\n\nTo simulate metastases, cells were randomly taken from the cell surface to seed a new tumour26. The cells were sampled at different primary tumour sizes, and from one or three regions of the primary tumour. Moreover, one or multiple seeding cells were taken from each primary region.\n\nTo obtain measures of timing of divergence, mutations that had a variant allele frequency of above 0.3 in 90% of all regions sampled from the primary tumour were considered to be clonal in the primary tumour. Primary–metastatic pairs were considered to be late if all primary clonal mutations were present in the metastatic tumour, and early otherwise, similar to the approach used in the sequencing data. All simulations were run with a selection coefficient of 0.01 both in the primary and metastatic tumours. To examine the mode of dissemination from different seeding patterns, the metastases were seeded from either 1, 10, 30 or 100 cells from either one or three regions of the primary tumour. The primary tumour was always run under a selection coefficient of 0.01, whereas metastatic tumours were run under selection coefficients of either 0, 0.001, 0.005 or 0.01. The resulting variant allele frequency files from the simulations were then formatted to be run through the same PyClone pipeline used to infer dissemination modes from the sequencing data.\n\nAll simulations were run for mutation rates of either 0.4 or 0.6 mutations per division per base pair (bp) in the exome (6.6 × 10−9 and 10 × 10−9 bp per division, respectively) on the basis of observed mutation rates in lung cancer56. Twenty replicates of simulated primary–metastatic pairs were run for each combination of parameters.\n\nCell volume was calculated assuming a cubic cell with a side of 15 μm, the typical diameter for a parenchymal cell57. Total tumour volume was calculated as the individual cell size multiplied by the number of cells in the tumour. A percentage of the total tumour cells in the tumour were added to account for purity.\n\nClassifying dissemination patterns\n\nWithin each primary tumour, we identified which cancer clone(s) were involved in metastatic dissemination and classified the dissemination pattern as monoclonal, if only a single clone of the primary tumour seeded metastatic tumours, or polyclonal, if multiple cancer clones were involved in seeding. Specifically, for each individual metastatic sample, if all mutation clusters shared between the primary tumour and metastasis were found to be clonal within the metastasis, the dissemination pattern was defined as monoclonal. Conversely, if any cluster defined as subclonal within the metastatic sample was also present in the primary tumour, the divergence was classified as polyclonal.\n\nIf only a single metastatic sample was considered for a case, the case-level dissemination pattern matched the metastasis level dissemination pattern. If multiple metastases were sampled and the dissemination pattern of any individual metastatic sample was defined as polyclonal, the case-level dissemination pattern was also defined as polyclonal. Conversely, if all metastatic samples followed a monoclonal dissemination pattern, all shared clusters between the primary tumour and each metastasis were extracted. If all shared clusters overlapped across all metastatic samples, the case-level dissemination pattern was classified as monoclonal, whereas, if any metastatic sample shared additional clusters with the primary tumour, the overall dissemination pattern was defined as polyclonal.\n\nFurthermore, the origin of the seeding clusters was determined as monophyletic if all clusters appear along a single branch, and polyphyletic if clusters were spread across multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree. Thus, if a metastasis was defined as monoclonal, the origin was necessarily monophyletic. For polyclonal metastases, the clusters were mapped to branches of the evolutionary tree. If multiple branches were found, the origin was determined to be polyphyletic, whereas, if only a single branch gave rise to all shared clusters, the origin was defined as monophyletic.\n\nFor case-level definitions, a similar approach was used. If any metastasis was defined as polyphyletic, the overall origin was also defined as polyphyletic. Conversely, if all metastases were monophyletic in origin, all branches containing shared clusters were counted. If only a single such branch existed, the case-level origin was classified as monophyletic.\n\nTo account for variation in the topologies of the phylogenetic tree, the classification of origin was performed on every possible tree topology for a given case. If all classifications overlapped, the multitree adjusted origin was defined as the consensus, while cases with differing origins based on the topology were highlighted as uncertain.\n\nDefining the seeding clones\n\nThe seeding clone is defined as the most recent shared clone between the primary tumour and metastases. Any cluster present in the primary tumour (defined as clonal or subclonal) and absent from the metastases was defined as primary-unique, any cluster present solely in the metastases and absent from the primary tumour was defined as metastasis-unique, while all clusters present in both the primary tumour and metastases were defined as shared.\n\nThe shared clusters were mapped to the phylogenetic tree to determine the most recent shared cluster using a leaf-up approach. If the shared clusters could be mapped to a single branch of the phylogenetic tree, the clonality of the most recent shared cluster was determined in the metastasis. If the most recent shared cluster was clonal in the metastasis, this cluster was defined as the only seeding cluster for the metastatic sample. By contrast, if the most recent shared cluster was subclonal within the metastasis, the parent cluster was also considered. This was done iteratively until the first shared cluster that was clonal in the metastasis was found. Clusters along this path were defined as seeding if their phylogenetic CCF17,58 (phyloCCF) value was greater than the phyloCCF of the child cluster.\n\nIf the shared clusters mapped to multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree, each branch was considered separately in the manner described above. If a parent cluster was shared between multiple branches, CCF values of both branches were added together, and the iterative approach continued until the first cluster was found to be clonal in the metastasis.\n\nInferring metastatic migration patterns\n\nThe MACHINA algorithm18 (v.1.2) was applied to infer the metastatic migration patterns of distinct tumour clones across the cohort. As MACHINA requires a tumour phylogenetic tree for each patient as input, we provided MACHINA with the default phylogenetic trees reconstructed in this study, and applied MACHINAs pmh_tr function, which infers the most parsimonious migration histories with tree polytomy resolution18. Furthermore, MACHINA requires as input clone proportions, that is, the proportions of cancer cells belonging to each tumour clone present at the time of sampling in each tumour region. As such, we estimated clone proportions in each region by using the estimated mean phyloCCF value across the related mutation clusters. To do this, we developed a bottom-up iterative algorithm that estimates clone proportions starting from the leaves of the tumour phylogenetic tree. Specifically, the clone proportion of each mutation cluster corresponding to a leaf of the phylogenetic tree was estimated to be equal to its phyloCCF, as the corresponding mutations were inferred to be present only in the cells belonging to its related clone. For every ancestral mutation cluster, the clone proportion of the corresponding clone was inferred by calculating the difference between the phyloCCF of the mutation cluster and the sum of the phyloCCFs of all its descendants. For example, if the leaf cluster had a phyloCCF of 1 in a region, no other clusters in the phylogenetic tree were present as clones. However, if a leaf cluster had a phyloCCF of 0.75, some parental clusters along the tree were inferred to have a clone proportion summing to 0.25. As phyloCCF is a point estimate of the corresponding underlying parameter, the phyloCCF of mutations that were inferred to be clonal in a tumour region might be generally different to 1. Since these deviations might affect the estimation of clone proportions, we corrected the mean phyloCCF of every clonal cluster to be exactly equal to 1.\n\nThe estimated clone proportions were used to create a clone tree, which was used as an input to MACHINA to infer metastatic migration patterns. Specifically, MACHINA was run by specifying the primary lung tumour and implementing each metastatic tumour as a separate site. Moreover, MACHINA was run considering all of the possible assumptions about the possible migration patterns that can be evaluated (parallel single source seeding, single source seeding, multi-source seeding, reseeding). To explore seeding of one metastasis by another site, the results from the single-source seeding output from MACHINA were used, as these provide the most conservative results of MACHINA.\n\nIn addition to exploring the different routes of metastatic dissemination, the results of MACHINA can be used to identify metastatic seeding clones. Thus, to provide further evidence to the identified seeding clones, we compared the results of MACHINA with those inferred by the new method in this study. Under the parallel single-source seeding assumption adopted in this analysis, we considered only the results of MACHINA using the same dissemination model. Moreover, the definition of monoclonal and polyclonal seeding from MACHINA does not take into account the tree, as done in this study. Thus, whereas MACHINA defines cases as polyclonal only if at least one metastasis sample is polyclonal, cases with a single monoclonal or multiple monoclonal metastases are both defined as monoclonal. To reconcile these differences, we adapted a similar definition: all cases that we define as polyclonal but that have multiple monoclonal metastases were redefined as monoclonal for this comparison.\n\nCalculating the clonal dispersion index\n\nThe clonal dispersion index was calculated as follows. For a tumour with n regions, subclonal cluster dispersion of each cluster i, with CCF xi, was calculated as:\n\n$$D=1-\\frac{\\max \\left({p}_{i}\\right)-\\frac{1}{n}}{1-\\frac{1}{n}},$$\n\nWhere \\({p}_{i}=\\,\\frac{{x}_{i}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{x}_{i}}\\) is the vector of CCF proportions. Each subclone was therefore given a score from 1, indicating the clone was evenly spread across all regions, to 0, where the clone was entirely unique to a single region. We compared the maximum CCF and subclonal dispersion to investigate both how dominant in any region and spread out across the regions the clusters were to quantify subclonal expansion.\n\ndN/dS analysis\n\nCohort level\n\nAn adapted version of the dNdScv method (v.0.0.1.0)20 was used to estimate global dN/dS values. In this adapted version, the global rates were estimated using all mutations (similar to running the original dNdScv function without specifying a gene list). Subsequently, the inferred global rates were used to estimate the global dN/dS estimates for a curated set of lung cancer genes. This list was formed of lung cancer genes as described in refs. 3,20,21,59, which were subsequently filtered based on expression in the TRACERx 421 cohort (median transcripts per million (TPM) > 0.2). This approach was run separately on mutations found in the seeding cluster and primary-unique mutations, as well as on subclonal mutations of non-metastatic primary tumours, as well as for LUAD and LUSC.\n\nGene level\n\nThe dNdScv function was run on mutations associated with the seeding clusters, as well as on the combination of mutations classified as primary-unique and subclonal mutations of non-metastatic tumours, for a curated set of lung cancer specific genes. This list was formed of lung cancer genes as described in refs. 3,20,21,59, which were subsequently filtered based on expression in the TRACERx 421 cohort (median TPM > 0.2).\n\nThe dN/dS point mutation estimate was calculated by combining the dN/dS estimates of missense and truncal mutations. The odds ratio of each gene was computed as the dN/dS estimate within the seeding mutations divided by the dN/dS estimate within the combined primary-unique and non-metastatic mutations. If the odds ratio was >2, the gene was classified as seeding favoured; if the odds ratio was <0.5, the gene was classified as primary favoured; and, otherwise, the gene was classified as primary and seeding favoured. The results were plotted for all genes with global q < 0.1 as calculated by dNdScv.\n\nThis analysis was performed separately for LUAD and LUSC tumours, as well as by combining both histological subtypes.\n\nTo statistically compare dN/dS values across the two groups (seeding mutations versus combined primary-unique and non-metastatic mutations), a published approach outlined in ref. 60 (https://zenodo.org/record/3966023#.YanjS_HP2cZ) was used (variable_dNdS_twodatasets). This approach compares dN/dS ratios of two datasets using a likelihood-ratio test. For a given gene g, the one-sided test uses the following null and alternative hypotheses60:\n\nH0: ωg,1 ≤ ωg,2\n\nH1: unconstrained ωg,1 and ωg,2\n\nWhere ωg,i is the dN/dS estimate for gene g in dataset i. This approach corrects for differences in mutation density due to coverage or mutational signatures, as well as removes the effect of global differences in dN/dS ratios across the genes.\n\nTherefore, dNdScv was run on the two datasets (seeding mutations := mutations from seeding clusters; non-seeding mutations := mutations from primary-unique clusters and mutations from non-metastatic tumours) independently. All genes with q < 0.1 as calculated by dNdScv were selected from both datasets and used for subsequent comparison. To calculate which genes were significantly enriched in seeding mutations, the function variable_dNdS_twodatasets was applied to seeding mutations as dataset 1 and non-seeding mutations as dataset 2 using the genes that were significant (q < 0.1) in the seeding mutations. Conversely, to calculate which genes were significantly enriched in non-seeding mutations, the function variable_dNdS_twodatasets was applied to non-seeding mutations as dataset 1 and seeding mutations as dataset 2 using the genes that were significant (q < 0.1) in the non-seeding mutations. For both analyses, multiple-testing correction (BH) was performed for the final list of significantly enriched genes.\n\nPaired mutation analysis\n\nEach mutation cluster was classified as metastasis favoured if it was absent in the primary and subclonal or clonal in the metastasis, or subclonal in the primary and clonal in the metastasis; primary favoured if it was clonal in the primary and subclonal or absent in the metastasis, or subclonal in the primary and absent in the metastasis; and maintained otherwise. The mutation cluster definition was then applied to each mutation within that cluster. The cohort was separated into LUAD and LUSC.\n\nFirst, non-driver mutations were used to calculate the ‘background’ rate of metastasis favoured, primary favoured and maintained mutations. Subsequently, the number of metastasis favoured, primary favoured and maintained driver mutations was calculated for each gene containing at least 5 driver mutations and compared to the background proportion of non-driver mutations.\n\nThis was used to estimate the proportions of metastasis favoured, primary favoured and maintained mutations using a multinomial test; P value correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg61 method was subsequently performed.\n\nUnpaired SCNA analysis\n\nTo identify genomic regions that demonstrated a significant SCNA positive-selection score at each genomic location, GISTIC2.0 (v.2.0.23)22 was run on the following two cohorts independently to produce SCNA positive-selection scores (G-score values), treating LUAD and LUSC separately: primary tumour samples from non-metastatic patients, excluding patients that presented with LN metastases at surgery; and metastasis samples from recurrent patients, including primary LN metastases.\n\nGISTIC2.0 takes as input a copy-number profile across the genome from one sample per patient. To investigate genomic regions of recurrent amplifications (/losses and deletions, respectively), we constructed the single-sample copy number profile for each tumour by selecting the maximum (/minimum, respectively) ploidy-corrected total copy number per segment across the genome.\n\nTo compare the GISTIC2.0 output between the metastasis and non-recurrent primary cohorts, we compared the G-score of all genes between the two cohorts. To measure the G-score per gene, we matched overlapping GISTIC2.0 segments with gene genomic positions. For genes that did not overlap any GISTIC2.0 output segments, we used the mean G-score of the two neighbouring segments. We then investigated oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes from our curated driver gene list in amplifications and losses, respectively, taking forward those that were found to have significant G-scores in our metastasis cohort for further analyses. For these genes, we calculated the difference in G-score values (G-score difference, GSD) between the metastasis and non-recurrent primary cohorts, to measure the difference in positive selection at these loci for the two cohorts.\n\nWhen performing the unpaired SCNA analyses separately for primary LN/satellite lesions and recurrence/progression samples, we constructed a single copy number profile for each sample type (that is, primary tumour, primary LN/satellite lesions and recurrence/progression samples), and performed comparison analyses as described above.\n\nPaired SCNA analysis\n\nUsing the driver genes found to be significantly recurrent in the unpaired analyses, we performed paired analyses of metastasizing primary tumour regions and their matched metastases to determine where in the metastatic transition these events had occurred. We first classified the copy number status of all segments overlapping these genes in the matched primary–metastasis cohort as lost or amplified relative to the sample ploidy62. Next, for tumours that had an event in a gene in at least one sample, we classified the event as primary favoured, metastasis favoured or maintained: if the event was present in both metastasizing primary regions and matched metastases, it was classified as maintained; if the event was present in metastasizing primary regions but absent from matched metastases, it was classified as primary favoured; and finally, if the event was absent from the metastasizing primary regions but present in the matched metastases, it was classified metastasis favoured. For each driver gene with an event present in at least five tumours, we then performed a multinomial test to determine whether the number of event classifications in this gene was significantly different compared to the background proportion of maintained, metastasis favoured and primary favoured classifications in all non-driver genes.\n\nWhen performing the above paired SCNA analysis separately for primary LN/satellite lesions and recurrence/progression samples, we considered only patients whose set of metastatic samples were either all primary LN/satellite lesions or all recurrence/progression samples.\n\nDepiction of clonal structure in tumour samples using clone maps\n\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, we depict the CCFs of subclones estimated using our WES pipeline accounting for the nesting structure determined by phylogenetic tree building. These depictions were generated using the cloneMap R package63 (v.1.0.0), which is available at GitHub (https://github.com/amf71/cloneMap).\n\nStatistical information\n\nAll statistical tests were performed in R (v.3.6.3 and 4.1.1). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Tests involving comparisons of distributions were performed using two-sided Wilcoxon tests (‘wilcox.test’) using paired or unpaired options where appropriate. Tests involving comparison of groups were performed using two-sided Fisher’s exact tests (‘fisher.test’). Hazard ratios and P values were calculated using the survival package (v.3.2.13). For all statistical tests, the number of data points included is plotted or annotated in the corresponding figure; and all statistical tests were two-sided unless otherwise specified.\n\nReporting summary"
