Belle Isle is the largest city-owned island park in the United States, and it is connected to mainland Detroit by the MacArthur Bridge. It's home to the Belle Isle Aquarium, the Belle Isle Conservatory, the Belle Isle Nature Center, the Detroit Boat Club, the James Scott Memorial Fountain, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, a municipal golf course, a half-mile swimming beach, and numerous monuments.\n\n1901 Â· Assassination of Mckinley\n\nPresident William McKinley was shot at the Temple of Music, in the Pan-American Exposition, while shaking hands with the public. Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen because he thought it was his duty to do so. McKinley died after eight days of watch and care. He was the third American president to be assassinated. After his death, Congress passed legislation to officially make the Secret Service and gave them responsibility for protecting the President at all times."
