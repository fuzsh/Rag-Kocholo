        "text": "Before Saturday's apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there have been multiple instances of political violence targeting U.S. presidents, former presidents, and major party presidential candidates.\n\nA historical overview highlights some of the notable assassinations and attempted assassinations: Abraham Lincoln was the first president to be assassinated in 1865, followed by James Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. Each incident profoundly impacted the nation, altering its course.\n\nOther attempts involved presidents like Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, who survived despite serious threats to their lives. The history of political violence in the United States underscores the perils faced by its leaders across centuries.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"
