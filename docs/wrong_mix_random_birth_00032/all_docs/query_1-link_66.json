        "text": "On September 14, 1901, President William McKinley,the 25th President of the USA, died, as a result of a shot in the stomach, which happened eight days earlier at the World’s Fair in Buffalo, New York. He was the third U.S. President to be assassinated.\n\nPresident, McKinley became known as a protector of big businesses, which enjoyed unprecedented growth during his presidency He advocated for the protective tariff as a way of protecting U.S. business and labor from competition abroad , and he maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver.\n\nOn September 6, 1901, William McKinley, , was shot on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York. He was shaking hands with members of the public when Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American anarchist and former steel worker, shot him twice in the abdomen.\n\nMcKinley was approached by Leon Czolgosz, carrying a concealed .32 revolver in a handkerchief. Drawing his weapon, he shot McKinley two times at close range. One bullet deflected off button on McKinley’s suit , but the other went into his stomach, passed through the kidneys, and lodged in his back.\n\nDr. Matthew D. Mann and a team of other physicians were not able to find the bullet during an operation, due to this gangrene soon spread throughout his body. McKinley died eight days later.\n\nCzolgosz was convicted of murder and executed on October 29, 1901. His last words were\n\n“I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people – the good working people. I am not sorry for my crime. I am sorry I could not see my father”\n\nThe president had, had a fairly relaxed approach to security, even though two of his predecessors (President Lincoln and President Garfield) had been killed in the past half-century.\n\nAfter McKinley’s assassination, newspaper editorials across the country heavily criticized the lack of protection afforded to American presidents. Though it still lacked any legislative mandate, by 1902, the Secret Service was established and was protecting President Theodore Roosevelt full-time."
