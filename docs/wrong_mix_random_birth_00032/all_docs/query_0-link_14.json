        "text": "262. William McKinley, born probably Bet. 1750 and 1760 in Ireland; died Abt. February 1829 in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He married 263. Margaret or Jane Thompson in Ireland.\n\nNotes for William McKinley:\n\nWilliam McKinley immigrated to the U.S. and settled in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The latter is proven by his will written December 23, 1828 which was made known to me by a McKinley researcher. The will was witnessed by James McKinney and Samuel Vankirk. James and Samuel personally appeared February 13, 1829 in Allegheny County court to testify to the validity of the will and to the sound mind and memory of William. On that date Letters Testamentary were granted to James Scott and William McKinley, Jr. as named executors, and were instructed to produce within one month an inventory \"of the personal estate of said deceased\".\n\nIt is so often the bequeaths we are most interested in and this will provides us the needed clue to make the association of this William McKinley as father of Elizabeth McKinley Forsyth with this statement \".. I Will and Bequeath My Dauter Elizebeth Mckinley Now Elizebeth for Sythe the Sum of five Dollers to Be paid By William Mckindley My Son to heir if She Comes to america ...\"\n\nHis first heir listed was his beloved wife \"Margret\". In addition to Elizabeth, he also named son William, youngest daughter \"Jain\", daughter \"Eloner\" and grandson William. This matches the 1820 census, page 171, which shows William McCinley enumerated August 7 with 1 male 26 thru 44 years, 1 male 45 and over, 1 female 16 thru 25, 1 female 26 thru 44 and 1 female 45 and over. James Scott, co-Executor, and Samuel Vankirk, witness, will appear later in the narratives of William Jr. and Thomas Forsythe, Jr.\n\nWith William Sr. established as the father of Elizabeth McKinley Forsyth, the following can be attached to him. The John and Elizabeth McKinley Forsyth descendants held an annual reunion beginning in 1904 and for several years thereafter. In 1905 the reunion was held in Oskaloosa, Mahaska County, Iowa at the home of Archibald, the last surviving child of John and Elizabeth. A newspaper article was printed which included some elements of family history. A transcription of the article is found in the \"Forsyths of Wapello Co., IA - A New Line\" section of this website under the navigation selection \"Addendum: Forsythe Reunion\". Included was the following, \"In the revolution of 1798, William McKinley ... had taken a part, and was a political refugee in America.\" This was the Irish Rebellion of 1798, an uprising against British rule in Ireland. It was focused in northern Ireland and led by Presbyterians angry at being shut out of power by the Anglican establishment, and increasingly joined by Catholics who were the majority of the population. It started May 24 and ended with a defeat at Vinegar Hill on October 12. After defeat of the rebels the British executed large scale massacres of rebels and sympathizers. Captured and wounded rebels were hung, piked to death, and burned alive. In one instance Protestant men, women, and children were imprisoned in a barn which was then set on fire. Little is known of what, if any, atrocities occurred in County Down where William was from.\n\nThe aforementioned McKinley researcher notified me of information she had found at the Western Pennsylvania Genealogical Society in Pittsburgh where she found William and William Jr. listed as immigrating in 1807 with the arrival location of Maryland; their sponsor was John McCullough (McCullough and McCollough are used interchangeably in documents, even in his will); they stayed there a year or two before migrating to Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. I do not have a copy of this documentation.\n\nThe McKinleys, McCulloughs and Forsyths appear to have had a close relationship in Ireland, which continued when they immigrated to America and to Iowa. Regarding the Rebellion of 1798, it is indeed very possible William participated in some form. But with him not immigrating until 1807, it may be questionable whether he immigrated as a political refugee. Americans encouraged relatively free and open immigration during the 18th and early 19th centuries. He could have immigrated at any time following the Rebellion, so he may have finally gotten tired of the \"second class citizen\" role of the non-Anglican population and decided to immigrate after hearing of American \"riches\" from friends and family who had immigrated before. Also the McKinley researcher stated the document identified the sponsor, John McCullough, as a revolutionary war soldier. I have not been able yet to prove that. However, there was a John McCullough buried in Round Hill Cemetery in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County who was included in the Pennsylvania Veterans Burial Cards, Series 1, 1929-1990 as a Revolutionary War veteran. This is not the same John McCullough we are interested in. This veteran died in 1830. John the sponsor died in 1836. I do not know if there might have been confusion as to which John McCullough was which, or if both were War veterans.\n\nJohn McCullough, the sponsor, and family migrated to Pennsylvania about the same time as the William McKinley, Sr. family and settled in neighboring Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County. John died circa June 1836 in Rostraver Township. He wrote his will February 17, 1830, but it did not enter probate until it was proved June 7, 1836 and thus recorded and letters Testamentary issued to son David McCullough and he was sworn as Executor. John's 1830 census entry shows him in his 60's. Sarah died between 1840 and 1850, likely in Rostraver Township. John's will names the children of John and wife Sarah as Sally, Hanna, Betsy, Peggy and David. The McCullough children will come up in the William McKinley, Jr. narrative and in the Forsyth narratives.\n\n263. Margaret or Jane Thompson, born Bet. 1750 and 1760 in Ireland; died probably Bet. 1840 and 1850 in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.\n\nNotes for Jane Thompson:\n\nWilliam Sr.'s first heir listed in his will was his beloved wife Margaret. As was stated in the \"Forsyths of Wapello Co., IA - A New Line\" section of this website, Frances Forsyth Hayden, daughter of John and Elizabeth McKinley Forsyth, had a written history of her Forsyth family unit. In it she gave her mother's parents as William McKinley and Jane Thompson. Was the mother's name Margaret Jane or did Frances have an incorrect name just like she had the given name wrong for the spouse of sister Eliza(beth) Forsyth? It does not seem likely that William would give an incorrect first name for his own wife. Of course, another plausible explanation could be that Margaret is his second wife. I tend to think the correct answer is that her name was Margaret Jane, because the first daughter born to son William Jr. and wife Martha Margaret McCullough was named Margaret Jane. That certainly offers no proof of her name, but is rather a possible explanation for the naming of the granddaughter.\n\nWilliam McKinley, Jr. appears in the 1830 Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County census, page 196 (as William McKinly), with 3 sons under 5 years of age, one male 30 to 40 years, 2 females 30 to 40 years, and one female 70 to 80 years (He is 6 households away from Thomas Forsythe - another family line of mine who also happened to marry into the Forsyth family and had a military relationship with William Jr.). The 3 sons are William III, John, and Archibald. One female in the 30-40 age bracket is obviously William Jr.'s wife Martha, born ca 1794. The other female in that category is most likely William Jr.'s sister Jain (Jane). William Sr. refers to her in his 1830 will as his youngest daughter. He follows that with \"... and to my Dauter Jain I Bequeth one Cow and one Bed With Bedding one Beurow one Sett of Cheirs and one table With a Comfortable Support of My farm While She Remains Single...\"\n\nWilliam McKinley, Jr. appears in the 1840 Elizabeth Township census, page 3 (as Wm McKindley), all children he and his wife were to have were present in the household. Also, there were 2 females in the 30 to 40 age group present and 1 female in the 50 to 60 age group. The older female numbers are suspiciously like those of the 1830 census. William Jr.'s wife is surely one of the 30-40 bracket, and she should be in the 40-50 bracket. It is possible the other 2 older women are Jane and Williams Jr.'s mother Margaret/Jane and also enumerated in the wrong age columns.\n\nThe William McKinley, Jr. family was found in the 1850 census with a little detective work. They are in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, page 170B and recorded as the William King family. It is the McKinley family because all children are present except for John and ages and birth locations check out. Son John is found (as John McKinly) in Elizabeth Borough of Elizabeth Township, page 146, in the household of C. F. Diehl with occupation as clerk. Mr. Diehl has occupation of merchant. Also in the William Jr. household a Jane Todd, age 54 and born in Ireland is enumerated. From the given name, age and birth location it appears this is sister Jane. No marriage records have been found to know who she married, or what happened to her spouse. But no mother Margaret/Jane was found. It appears from this information that mother Margaret/Jane likely died between 1840 and 1850, in her 80's, which in turn set the stage for William Jr.'s family to be free to migrate to Iowa.\n\nChild of William McKinley and Margaret or Jane Thompson is:\n\n264. Thomas Forsythe, Sr., born perhaps Bef. 1755 in Ireland; died Abt. 1807 (date of will) in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of 528. ? Forsythe. He married 265. Nancy Parker Bef. 1776 perhaps in Westmoreland (now Fayette) County, Pennsylvania.\n\nNotes for Thomas Forsythe, Sr.:\n\nThe following is from the book \"The Pioneer Forsythes of Fayette County, Pennsylvania and Their Descendants\" (Forsythe Book) by Glenn Luther Forsythe, \"According to a letter written by Mary Ann Forsythe, a granddaughter of Thomas and Nancy (Parker) Forsythe, to Mary Ann's daughter, L. W. Reynolds, 'Thomas Forsythe came to America from Ireland and settled in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. He met a Dutch lady, Miss Nancy Parker, (and) they were married and had a family of ten children.'\n\n\"There is some doubt as to whether Nancy Parker was Dutch. Parker is not a Dutch name and there were no substantial Dutch settlements in the vicinity at the time. One of the daughters did marry a Mr. Vandine (VanDyne?), though, so it is possible that Nancy did have some Dutch ancestry.\n\n\"The earliest record located so far shows that Thomas Forsithe acquired a warrant to purchase a tract of land in Tyrone Township (now Perry Township), Fayette County, Pennsylvania on January 21, 1785. In December of the same year he obtained a patent for that land and purchased it. In the first records concerning him the Forsythe name was spelled Forsithe. It is spelled Forsythe in the 1790 Federal population census and in current usage.\"\n\nFurther from the Forsythe Book, \"Little information about the origin of Thomas Forsythe other than what has been passed on by family traditions and the federal censuses exists. Mrs. George Marsh of West Newton, Pennsylvania, stated that Thomas tomahawked a tract of land, probably the same tract which he later acquired by warrant when Fayette County was first opened to settlers. But he had to leave because of Indian hostilities. In 1774 (?) he returned when Governor Dunsmore of Virginia reopened the area. Thomas probably married at that time as his first child (Elizabeth?) was born about 1779.\"\n\nNow the Indian problems occurred in the mid-1760's after the white encroachment reached an intolerable level, and several incidents of whites killing Indians raised the Indian rage to a fever pitch. At that point Governor Dunsmore of Virginia, who was the primary official who turned his back as the whites encroached, finally called for all whites to vacate the area. By 1768 a treaty had been executed with the Indians and their lands comprising current day south-western Pennsylvania was purchased for white settlement. The territory was officially opened in 1769 for settlement. If Thomas was present at the time of the Indian hostilities, then he was likely born 10 to 15 years earlier than his estimated birth date stated above. That part of Pennsylvania was part of Bedford County, Pennsylvania in 1772. According to the 1772 Bedford County tax list as published in \"The Monongahela of Old or Historical Sketches of South-western Pennsylvania to the Year 1800\" by James Veech, 1910, no Thomas Forsythe was listed - either among the heads of household, borders with no household, or freemen. It is possible he came to the area sometime after 1772 or it is possible he was there and not counted or counted among Virginia tax rolls. This same area of southwestern Pennsylvania was also claimed by Virginia. From the early part of the 18th century France had put forth maps of the North American continent that showed a Louisiana territory which included among other large tracts that part of present day Pennsylvania that was west of the Susquehanna. As early as 1731 Pennsylvania was being warned that France was tyring to gain a foothold on huge tracts of land that lay within that colony's charter boundaries. Bogged down in many years of controversy with Lord Baltimore over boundaries with the colony of Maryland, the Pennsylvania Assembly ignored the French intrusions. It was when Virginia, in 1748-49, took the initiative and established the Ohio Company in the vicinity of present day Pittsburgh that Pennsylvania finally took notice (this is the reason Virginia Governor Dunsmore was taking the lead during the Indian troubles above, and not the Pennsylvania authorities). This Virginia incursion, which helped precipitate the French and Indian War, also led to 3 1/2 decades of conflict between Pennylvania over territory that would become Washington, Greene, Fayette, Westmoreland and Allegheny counties and Virginia with territory they named West Augusta later divided in Yohogania, Ohio and Monongalia counties. This conflict between Pennsylvania and Virginia became quite heated, at times coming to blows and near bloodshet. Both Colonies were selling land in the area under contention, with Virginia selling at a greatly reduced price. (Virginia sold land for as low as 10 shillings per 100 acres and Pennsylvania sold for about 5 pounds sterling, according to Veech. There was much contention between the two factions with anyone holding office under the laws of Pennsylvania and attempting any official act was likely to be arrested and jailed by persons claiming to hold office under the government of Virginia, and vice versa for the Virginia officials. The issue was not settled, in Pennsylvania's favor, until the Mason-Dixon Line was officially run in 1785 - the year Thomas purchased his land.) It is in these short lived Virginia Counties that a few records occur that might pertain to this family:\n\nFrom \"Annals of the Carnegie Museum, Vol. I, 1901-1902\", by W. J. Holland & J. B. Hatcher; New Era Printing Company; Lancaster, PA; 1902, the following are the earliest instances found of Forsythe in SW Pennsylvania (spelling as given)\n\nMinutes of Court of Yohogania County, pg 228\n\nCourt met According to adjournment May 26, 1778.\n\nThe Court being Constituted, Took their seats and proceeded to Business.\n\nJames Fasithe was Brought into Court and Stands Charged with Disaffection to the State, who pleads not Guilty, whereopon come the same Jury as before, who say that the sd.

It is not clear whether there is any relationship to the William and James also mentioned in these court notes. Noted below is the land purchase made by Thomas, which confirms his presence at this early date) and also two purchases made by a William, although not in the same township. James is not found in Fayette County records.\n\nThe 1772 Bedford County tax list did contain the name of Frederick Parker listed in Springhill Township. Could this have been Nancy's father? Also listed in Springhill Township was Christian Pitser, father of Rebecca who was wife-to-be of John, son of Thomas Sr.\n\nThe \"Annals of the Carnegie Museum\" resource also contained other Parkers who could be potential candidtates for Nancy's father:\n\nMinutes of Court of Yohogania Court, page 126\n\nMarch 24th 1778, the Court met pursuant to adjournment.\n\nBargain and Sale.

This county was all of southwestern Pennsylvania, which included the area that is now Fayette County. Glen Swartz in the RootsWeb World Connect database \"glen_swartz\" quotes research done by the late W. Don Shoaf from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Deed Book A-1, page 160, \"1778 Jun 01, Deed. Charles Martin to Thomas Forsythe, 150 acres (with all improvements) on the south side of Youghiogheny River, adjoining John Vanmeter, a run, the top of Rich Hill, Mr Powers, and Moses Thompson; it being the upper part of a 300 acre tract, the lower 150 acres of which was sold to Thomas Reed. Price: 100 PA currency. Witnesses: Moses Thompson and Edward Cook.\" This timeframe fits the estimated time of the start of his family, and this area fits the general area of the subsequent warrant and purchase mentioned in the Forsythe book above and in the material that follows. That warrant was in Fayette County, and Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County on September 26, 1783.\n\nAs found in \"History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania: with Biographical Sketches of Many of Its Pioneers and Prominent Men\"; edited by Franklin Ellis; L. H. Everts & Co., Philadelphia, 1882, page 715 in the Perry township history section, \"Gen. J. B. Sweitzer owns 240 acres of land adjoining the Beeler tract, east on Jacob's Creek. This was part of the Turnbull lands. Thomas Forsyth took out a patent for 171 acres of land in this part of the township. He had sons, - Ezekiel, David, and Thomas. Ezekiel settled on the homestead. His son Thomas now lives on the farm adjoining. Henry and John, sons of Ezekiel, both live near. David, son of Thomas, lived in Westmoreland County.\" This warrant description is supported by the following information.\n\nFayette County attained its final, and current, boundaries in 1784 and the county government set about mapping out the land claims of its inhabitants. According to the Fayette County Warrant Register, page 84, Thomas Forsithe obtained Fayette Co, survey warrant No.4 for Patentee surnames starting with F for these 150 acres he purchased in 1778. The date of the survey warrant was January 21, 1785 with the return date being December 17, 1785 and the acres in the return determined as 171 acres by survey rather than 150. The survey register identifies the Thomas Forsithe patent to be registered in Vol. P, No. 4, Page 268 and the survey to be found copied in Book A61, Page 197 in Tyrone Township. The survey states \"Situated in Poverty Neck on the East Side of Youghiogeni River in Tyrone Township Fayette County and surveyed the 21st Day of May 1785. In Pursuance of a Warrant Dated the 21 Day of January 1785 by Alexander M Clean Deputy.\" The accompanying map identifies Thomas' property, which he named \"Greenland\", as adjoining those of Joseph Whitesides, Peter Studibaker and an area to the south and west identified as Vacant Inaccesable River Hills.\n\nA William Forsythe (likely from the Carnegie Annals above) registered two tracts in Washington Township of Fayette County, whereas Thomas' tract above is found in Tyrone Township. William's first tract, \"Wolf's Harbour\", consisting of 122 acres had a survey warrant date of September 29, 1784 with a return date of December 2, 1785. This entry is registered in Vol. P, No. 4, Page 174 and the survey can be found copied in Book A61, Page 196 where the description is given \"Situate on the East Side of Monongahela River below the mouth of Redstone Creek & Nearby adjoining the same in Washington Township Fayette County & surveyed the 5th day of Novenmber 1784 In Pursuance of a Warrant Dated the 29th day of September 1784.\" William's second tract, \"Forsyth's Purchase\", consisting of 296 acres had a survey warrant date of Janury 4, 1787 with a return date of January 8, 1787. This entry is registered in Vol. P, No. 8, Page 191 and the survey can be found copied in Book C48, Page 162 where the description is given \"Situated on the East Side of Monongahela River in Washington Township Fayette County about one and half Miles below the Mouth of Great Redstone Creek & Surveyed the 25th Day of August 1784 By Order of Survey in the Name of William Colvin No 3476 Dated the 14th Day of June 1769.\" No evidence has been found at this time of the James Forsythe above taking out any land patents in Fayette County.\n\nOther data involving Thomas included in Tyrone Townnship tax records from FHL film #1449318 - Fayette County, Pennsylvania Tax records of Tyrone Township, 1785-1855, and census records are:\n\n1785 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsith, 150 acres, 2 horses, 2 horned cattle.\n\n1786 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursithe, 150 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1787 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1788 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsith, 171 acres, 2 horses, 4 cattle.\n\n1789 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fersithe, 170 acres, 3 horses, 3 cattle.\n\nThomas Forsythe 1790 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania census, page 65:\n\n1 male 16 and over, 3 males under 16, and 5 females\n\n1791 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursithe, 71 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1793 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursithe, 71 acres, 3 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1795 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 170 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1796 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 3 horses, 4 cattle.\n\n1797 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsithe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 5 horned cattle.\n\n1798 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 2 cattle.\n\n1799 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1800 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle.\n\nThomas Forsith 1800 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania census, page 605:\n\n2 males under 10, 2 males of 10 & under 16, 1 male 45 and over\n\n2 females under 10, 1 female of 10 & under 16, 1 female 45 and over\n\n(3 females were already married and out of the house.)\n\n1801 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle\n\n1802 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 3 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1803 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 3 horses, 4 cattle.\n\n1804 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsythe, 171 acres, 3 horses, 3 cattle.\n\n1805 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Fursythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 2 cattle, 1 still.\n\n1806 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsithe, 171 acres, 1 horse, 2 cattle, 1 still.\n\n1807 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThos Fursythe, 171 acres, 2 horses, 3 cattle, 1 still.\n\n1808 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsithe, 171 acres, 3 horses, 3 cattle, 1 still.\n\n1809 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania tax record:\n\nThomas Forsithe, 171 acres, 1 horses, 3 cattle, 1 still.\n\nIn Thomas Forsythe's will, dated November 9, 1807, he does as we all wish with wills of our ancestors and names all of his children. He provides for wife, Nancy, with the house and two cows and the provision that she be \"supported with bread and meat\" while she remained a widow. He then provides for sons John, Thomas, David and Ezekiel and for daughters Elizabeth Vandine, Peggy (Margaret) Jones, Nancy Jones, Hannah McKenna, and Polly and Sally (both of whom he mentions have not yet come of age). The lands, goods and chattels were to be split equally by David and Ezekiel and to be paid at Nancy's death. The will went to probate on January 16, 1808 with son-in-law Richard Jones \"My hole and Sole Executer of this My Last Will and Testement\" and son David \"Forsithe Executer of this My Last Will and Testement\". I am not clear as to Whole and Sole Executor versus Executor.\n\n265. Nancy Parker, born Bef. 1755 in possibly Pennsylvania; died Abt. 1820-1821 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.\n\nNotes for Nancy Parker:\n\nNot a great deal is known about Nancy, other than what was mentioned in the notes for Thomas. The name has evidently been passed from generation to generation as there has been no documentation found other than the letter mentioned above. It is possible she was born in Pennsylvania, but that also is unknown. If Fredrick Parker from above is indeed her father, then we know she was in the area by 1772. She might not have been in the immediate vicinity too much before that because settlement in this area was not \"officially\" allowed until 1769, after a peace settlement had been reached with the Indians, although many settlers took it upon themselves to encroach on Indian land long before 1769. Her birth date is estimated from the 1800 census which has her at age 45 or greater.\n\nNancy is shown as head of household, age greater than 45, in 1810 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, page 235. Also in the household were 1 male age 16 to 26, 1 female age 10 to 16, and 1 female age 16 to 26. Nancy is shown on line 27. Nearby are other members of the family - line 26 David Forsythe, line 23 Thomas Forsythe, line 22 Richard Jones, and line 21 Aaron Jones. Aaron is not proven to be a son-in-law, but there is that possibility and will be mentioned below. Nancy is not found by name in the 1820 census, but there is a possibility she is the female of age 45 and up living in the Ezekiel Forsyth family in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, page 144 (and on the line immmediately below David Forsythe). Now Thomas Jr. was in Tyrone Township in 1817, 1818 and 1819 tax lists, then was found in the 1820 Brown County, Ohio census (see Thomas Jr. narrative in previous generation). It is very possible he was in Tyrone because his mother's health was declining during that time and that he left for Brown County, Ohio after her death to be with brother John and his family. Since the 1820 census day was officially August 7, 1820, with the following 13 months alloted for collecting the enumeration data, it is likely Nancy died between that date and September 7, 1821 and Thomas Jr. and family still had time to get to Brown County, Ohio for that enumeration. Even if Nancy had died before the census taker got to Ezekiel's home, the enumerator was instructed to include her if she had been alive on August 7, 1820. In the 1821 tax list Ezekiel and David had divided the land of Thomas Forsythe, each taxed on 80 acres. Presumably this supports the above possibility and means then that Nancy had died, for Thomas wrote in his will the lands, goods and chattels were to be split equally by David and Ezekiel and to be paid at Nancy's death.\n\nThomas and Nancy are believed to be buried at Jacobs Creek Cemetery in Westmoreland County, just across the Fayette County line. This is located about a mile and a half from the original family homestead. It is located on the flood plain of the Youghiogheny River and many stones have been destroyed. Whatever the reason, their stones have not survived.\n\nChildren of Thomas Forsythe and Nancy Parker are:\n\niii. John Forsythe, born February 16, 1781 in Westmoreland (now Fayette) County, Pennsylvania; died March 25, 1855 in Moulton, Wells Township, Appanoose County, Iowa; married Rebecca Pittsor/Pitzer Abt. 1808 in Clermont County, Ohio; born December 1, 1790 in Fayette County, Pennsylvania; died March 29, 1833 near Straight Creek, Brown County, Ohio.\n\nJohn is identified in his father's will, \"Secondly I do Will and allow My Son John Forsithe One Hundred and Forty Dollars to be paid as soon as possible of the Produce of the Orchard.\" John is unique among the heirs in that he was to be paid as soon as possible while all others were to be paid at their mother's death. Chances are that he had been preparing to leave the area. John appears in the 1805 Tyrone Township, Fayette County tax list as single with 0 acres, 0 horses, and 0 cattle, but he is found nowhere in the Fayette County area after that point.\n\nThe Forsythe Book states, \"As a young man he moved to Brown County, Ohio, in 1800. He was one of the earliest residents of the area. The move was probably made by boat down the Youghiogheny, Monogahela and Ohio Rivers. John traveled to Brown County with a Robert Forsythe. This Robert may have been a son of one of the original Thomas Forsythe's brothers...\" It may be that he had been in \"Brown\" County, Ohio, and perhaps he came back when his father started failing, but we do know he was residing in Fayette County in 1805 as well as among the Thomas Forsith family enumeration on the 1800 Fayette County census (page 605). So it is likely he did not leave until after the 1805 tax list was generated, so the haste noted in the will could possibly support the fact that John was only there for a short while. Some additional information brings into doubt the story about John traveling with Robert Forsythe. There were two John Forsythes in the \"Brown\" County area in the early 1800s and it was most likely the other John who was there with Robert, as supported by the following notation. In \"The Virginia Military Surveys of Clermont and Hamilton Counties, Ohio 1787-1849\" by Alam Aicholtz Smith, 1985, \"Brown, John Survey No. 4858. Surveyed for John Brown, assignee, 500 acres of land on part of a Military Warrant No. 4666 on the waters of the East Fork of the Little Miami. Batavia Township, Military Warrant 4666, Robert Forsythe and John Forsythe, heirs of Robert Forsythe, a captain for 3 years, patent to John Brown.\" (Note: This area at that time was still a military tract, and Brown County had not come into existence yet. Brown became a county in 1818 from parts of Clermont and Adams Counties.) There is no clear reason why our John would be an heir of Robert Forsythe.\n\nGlen Swartz in the RootsWeb World Connect database \"glen_swartz\" states \"according to Chris Pitzer (well documented): Rebecca Pitzer, b. 1 Dec 1789 PA, d/o Christian Pitzer (ca 1740-1797) and Maria Elizabetha Reede.\" Christian's family was in Bedford County, Westmoreland County and Fayette County, Pennsylvania from at least 1772 until 1791 when he appears in county records in Mason County, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Clermont and Adams Counties, Ohio (later to include Brown County). It appears some of the Pitzers may have moved across the river to Ohio. In Clermont County a John Pitzer married Catherine Leeferry on March 14, 1805 a Jamima Pitzer married John F. Foor on August 27, 1811, a Mary Pitzer married John Jones on March 1, 1814, and a Jonathan Pitzer married Elizabeth Foore on January 15, 1818. I checked Adams County in that timeframe and found no Pitzer marriages or John Forsythe marriage. In checking Clermont County there was no John Forsythe marriage, but then marriage records for that county between March 12, 1807 and April 26, 1810 are missing (just our luck). With all the other Pitzer marriages in that county and with the aid of a letter from his second born child who stated she was born July 17, 1810 some 8 or 10 miles west of Georgetown (which placed her in Clermont County at the time), it is probably safe to say that is where John was married. Additionally, since their first born child was born in December of 1808, it probably lends credence to the theory that John migrated to Clermont County between 1805 (tax list entry) and 1807 (Thomas writing his will and his demise), then was in a hurry to return to Ohio. I have estimated their marriage as abount 1808, but it could have been late 1807 and John was in a hurry to get back to his new wife.\n\nJohn and Rebecca had 2 sons and 4 daughters, with all but the last child born likely in Clermont County. Hannah was born in 1820, after Brown County has been formed and the family is found in 1820 Clark Township, Brown County census, page 389. Clark Township is to the northwest of Georgetown, which is consistent with his daughter's letter stating she was born west of Georgetown. Rebecca dies in 1833, but the family continues to live in Brown County before the wander lust strikes - 1830 Scott Township (page 470) and 1840 Jefferson Township (page 226). Sometime in the late 1840s they choose to move and John is found living in the Aaron Reynolds family in 1850 Township 4S Range 3W, Pike County, Illinois census, page 75B (wife Mary Ann Forsythe Reynolds is John's second born child). Son Thomas Jefferson Forsythe is in Township 3S Range 3W on page 44A, three households away from Samuel and Elizabeth Forsythe Gregg. Also in Pike County, in Township 3S Range 4W census (page 128A) is Jackson and Hannah Forsythe Morrow. From here the family units move to Appanoose County, Iowa in 1854 where John dies March 25, 1855 in Wells Township at the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Samuel and Elizabeth Forsythe Gregg, and is buried in Hilltown Cemetery there.\n\nNote: John Fosythe from Davis County, Iowa, nephew of John, wrote a letter to cousin Thomas Forsythe in Fayette County on June 6, 1859 saying, \"I will give you the name of his (Uncle John of Ohio) Soninglaus in Iowa, Appanoose County, 15 miles from where we live...William Morrow (married) Nancy.\" Nancy died in Brown County, Ohio in 1842 and in the 1850 Franklin Township census (page 404) William has married the widow Rachel Thompson and they are there yet in 1851. Then in the 1860 Wells Township, Appanoose County, Iowa census (page 655) William and Rachel are shown as having followed Jackson Morrow west.\n\nix. Ezekiel Forsythe, Sr., born June 02, 1794 in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania; died June 14, 1845 in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania; married Mary Ann Bird Abt. 1817-1818 in Fayette County, Pennsylvania; born December 24, 1799 in Pennsylvania; died June 14, 1879 in Perry Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.\n\nEzekiel is an heir in Thomas' will - \"of the rest I do allow ... my son Ezekiel the other half of all My Lands Good and Chattels Each to be Equel shares of all at their Mothers Death and said ... Ezekiel is to pay all the Above Mentioned Legacyes to the rest\". From the Forsythe Book \"Ezekiel Forsythe, the youngest son of Thomas and Nancy Parker Forsythe, was born June 2, 1794 in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. He was raised on the Thomas Fosythe homestead.\"\n\nThe Tyrone Township tax lists show Ezekiel Forsythe in 1814 as \"not of age\" and 160 acres, in 1815-1817 as single, 160 acres valued at 960, in 1818 160 acres (no longer listed as single), and in 1821-1837 as farmer, 80 acres (from the division of land his father left him by will), plus horses and cattle. This would suggest, along with their first child being born May 5, 1819, Ezekiel was married in late 1817 or early 1818. Ezekiel Forsyth is found in the 1820 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania census (page 144). The woman age 45 and above is presumed to be his mother Nancy. He is also found in the 1830 Tyrone Township census (page 268) and the 1840 Perry Township census (page 245). Ezekiel died on June 14, 1845, still living on his half of the original Forsythe homestead.\n\nThe Forsythe Book states, \"In the 1790 Fayette County Federal census, a Samuel Burd is listed as head of a family. But he is not found on either the 1800 or 1810 census. We are not sure if Mary Ann Bird Forsythe was or was not part of the Samuel Burd family.\" While I did not find Samuel Burd in 1790, I did find Samuel Burd in 1800 Tyrone Township (page 604) and Samuel Bird in 1810 Tyrone Township (page 233). Samuel is not found in Fayette County in 1820, but Samuel Bird with children that seem to fit the right age categories is found in Lackawannock Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania (page 64). It is not known if this is Mary Ann's father, but the census enumerations certainly fit her birth date and location.\n\nIn the 1850 Perry Township census (page 262A) Mary Forsythe appears to be living on the 80 acres of the original Forsythe homestead with the census showing real estate with the value of $1,600. She is living next to brother-in-law David Forsythe and has three sons yet at home - Daniel, age 18, Ezkael, age 16, and John, age 10. In the 1860 Perry Township Mary A Forsyeth is shown with real estate valued at $2,000 and son Ezekel, age 22 and laborer, and son John, age 21 and Cropper. She is not found in the 1870 census and her will written August 22, 1872 was proved July 12, 1879 (Fayette County, Pennsylvania Wills Book 5, page 220). Mary Ann as included in the U.S. Federal Census Mortality Schedule, 1880. She died June 14, 1879. She and Ezekiel had 5 girls and 6 sons.\n\nEzekiel Sr.'s estate papers give some insight into his family.

For example, Susan was identified as married to Jacob Smith and residing in South Huntingdon Township, Westmoreland County. The earliest receipt from a couple of her heirs was dated February 14, 1880 identifying a date by which we know Susan had died. The 1850 thru 1870 censuses show the Jacob Smith family in South Huntingdon Township with combined children of Mariah, Mary, Henry, Catharine, Joseph, David, Sadie, Anna, and William. By 1870 Susan in no longer listed and by 1880, when marital status is recorded for the first time, Jacob is shown as a widower. An additional benefit is that some of the daughters are shown as heirs with their married name.\n\n284. William Sidwell, born Abt. 1768 in Chester County, Pennsylvania; died Bet. 1838 - 1840 in Fayette County, Illinois. He was the son of 568. Richard Sidwell and 569. Frances Brown. He married 285. Mary Key March 12, 1791 in Greene County, North Carolina (current day Tennessee).\n\nNotes for William Sidwell, Sr.:\n\nWilliam's story begins with his parent's decision to move from Chester County, Pennsylvania back to North Carolina. The first communication on the subject occurred in the July 29, 1769 Nottingham minutes of Chester County whereby, \"West Nottingham Informs this Meeting that Richard Sidwell Removed himself and family to Carolina last fall, without Settleing with his Crediters, Joseph Brown and Henry Reynolds Jur. are Appointed to Inspect into the case more fully & Report to Next Meeting.\" The underlining is my doing. Subsequent communications listed their children as Hannah, Ruth, Elizabeth, John & William, in that order. A P.S. was added to the message stating, \"as the three Eldest were Born in Carolina,...\" thus leaving John and William as born in Chester County, Pennsylvania. That is confirmed when comparing to the minutes of the East Nottingham, Chester County meeting of October 3, 1761 where the incoming children of Richard and Frances are listed as Hannah, Ruth, Susannah, & Elizabeth. Since the family exited Chester County in the fall of 1768, that suggests William was born no later than early to mid-1768.\n\nSometime around 1789-90, or earlier based on when Richard and Frances moved, William left Guilford County, North Carolina for western North Carolina territory that would become the state of Tennessee on June 1, 1796. On March 7, 1791 William married Mary Key in Greene County.\n\nFrom Greene County they are found in Knox County, western North Carolina Territory when it was formed in 1792. This may not have required a move on their part depending on where in Greene county they lived and whether that was the part that formed part of the new Knox County. He is found in Knox County serving as a private in the local frontier militia of the Territory South of the Ohio under the command of Capt. John Menefee for protection from Indian attacks. He served September 11-15 1792 for $.50 pay and May 31-June 14, 1794 for $11.25 pay. In 1790 North Carolina ceded her western territorial land to the young Federal Government, at which time it became known as the Territory South of the River Ohio. To protect themselves from the dangers of the frontier, a territorial militia was instituted and when Knox became a county in 1792 it was known as the Knox County Regiment, Hamilton District Militia, Territory South of the Ohio. The expectation was that any able bodied male 18 and older would serve to protect the frontier communities and this is what William volunteered for.\n\nThis area was a frontier, and church formation always lagged people entering new territory. It was not until May 20, 1797 that the Lost Creek Monthly Meeting of the Quaker church was established near the present day town of New Market, Tennessee. That is right on the border with Knox County, near where William and Mary had settled. When his parents moved the family from Pennsylvania back to North Carolina and were disowned because of financial mismanagement, the recommendation from the Pennsylvania meeting was to disown the parents but allow the children to be part of the Society in North Carolina. William must have benefited from that as the minutes of the June 1797 Cane Creek meeting in North Carolina reports \"Also Complains of William Sidwell for accomplishing marriage Out of Unity, Jacob Marchill is therefore Appointed to produce a testimony Against him to next meeting.\" The July 1 meeting reports \"The friend Appointed to prepare A testimony Against William Sidwell hath produced one which was approved of & Signed, Hugh Maxwell is appointed to Send a Copy thereof to the montly meeting of lost Creek.\" The September 23, 1797 meeting of Lost Creek records they received the testimony from Cane Creek and instructed he be informed of the decision to disown him. These actions were likely initiated by William wishing to transfer his membership from Cane Creek to Lost Creek.\n\nWhile I have no proof at this time they are siblings, it appears 4 siblings may have joined William in Knox County in this time frame. The following Sidwell marriages occurred in Knox County: Rachel Sidwell (John Bryan security) married Joseph Williams March 20, 1797, Isaac Sidwell (Joseph Sidwell security) married Elizabeth Conn Jamuary 27, 1798, Fanny Sidwell (Joseph Sidwell security) married William Brown February 26, 1798, and Joseph Sidwell (William Davison security) married Margaret Hutchinson September 15, 1798. This assumption seems entirely feasible in light of father Richard appearing in Hawkins County at least by 1793 and two other siblings making the same move. While children who might have been born after Richard and Frances were disowned by the Quaker Society and were not members of the Society of Friends, the following children were born prior to that action and were recorded as members of the Society. Sister Hannah married James Davison, Jr. December 29, 1777 in Guilford County, North Carolina, then March 07, 1795 the family received a certificate to transfer from Cane Creek Meeting to Westfield Monthly Meeting followed by a transfer to Lost Creek Meeting in January 1812. Settlement by Friends in Greene County, Tennessee began as early as 1784 while Westfield Monthly Meeting was not established until 1786 it was thought to be most convenient for Tennessee Friends to have their membership. Sister Ruth married William Davison (brother to James Davison, Jr. and security for Joseph Sidwell marriage bond) November 30, 1778 in Guilford County, North Carolina, then the family got a certificate November 07, 1795 to move from Cane Creek Meeting to Newhope Meeting in Greene County, Tennessee followed by a transfer to Lost Creek Meeting in October 1798. It is likely the two Davison families migrated to the same area of Greene County in the same time frame and at a much earlier time than what 1795 and 1798 dates indicate. That is suggested by William's marriage date, Richard's settlement dates, and the fact that the later dates were more a result of when the Monthly Meetings were created than when the families moved to the area.\n\nThe next move for William and family was circa 1799-1800 and just across the state line to assume a 190 acre land grant surveyed September 15, 1800 and located on Illwill Creek in Cumberland County, Kentucky. This land grant was among the Grants South of Green River as described in Adam Guthrie's narrative in generation 6. Illwill Creek was in eastern Cumberland County at the time, and fell in Clinton County when it was formed in part from Cumberland County in 1836. According to tradition, Illwill Creek was so named when pioneers at the site retreated reluctantly (with an \"ill will\") to hostile Indians as told in \"From Red Hot to Monkey's Eyebrow: Unusual Kentucky Place Names\" by Robert M. Rennick, University Press of Kentucky, 2013, pp 9-10. Presumed brother Joseph Sr. followed later when he assumed a 100 acre land grant on Illwill Creek surveyed on June 26, 1805. 1805 was also the year that father Adam and sons James, Thomas and George Guthrie/GuthreyGuthry/Gurhtery settled on Illwill Creek. George Guthrie's daughter Mary and William Sidwell's son David Sr. would marry to continue my ancestral line. It is possible Joseph Sr. delayed his move until after his parents died. William and Polly (Mary) are listed on the membership of the Sinking Springs Baptist Church in 1805 and again in 1806 when he was also appointed clerk of the church. Evidently being disowned by the Quakers led him to membership in the Baptist church, which continued with his sons David and Isaac into Iowa. In 1806 he is listed as owning an additional 100 acres surveyed on Sulpher Lick of Obey Creek and in 1813 he sold some of his land to a Warren Sams. They continued farming on the remainder of their land until approximately 1828, when William and Mary and a couple of their children, David Sr. being one, moved to Fayette County, Illinois.\n\nThe 1830 Fayette County, Illinois census, page 245, line 14 shows the Wm Sidwell household, with one male age 60 through 70 (born 1761-1770) and one female age 50 through 59 (born 1771-1880). Also in the household is a female age 20 through 29 (born 1801-1810) which would have been the youngest child of William Sr. and Mary, Rebecca Jane who would get married in another 3 years. One line above, on line 13, is the household of son Isaac Denton. Son David also migrated to Illinois, settling in Shelby County on the north Fayette County line. He and family are on page 140, line 14 and on the next line is his brother-in-law Adam Guthery (Guthrie). As was common on the frontier, they \"squatted\" on the land for quite some time before purchasing a tract. Often times they needed this time to build up enough cash for the purchase. Son David purchased 40 acres at $1.25 per acre on January 21, 1837 with certificate #5970 issued August 10, 1838. Son Isaac Denton purchased 40 acres at $1.25 per acre on October 06, 1832 with certificate #1422 issued October 8, 1834 and another 40 acres at $1.25 per acre on March 01, 1837 with certificate #6646 issued on November 01, 1839. Also, William purchased 40 acres at $1.25 per acres on March 22, 1838 with certificate #8283 issued November 01, 1839.\n\nAccording to information from The Primitive Baptist Library as provided by Elder Robert Webb, William Sidwell was a member of Clear Spring Baptist Church of Fayette County. As found on The Primitive Baptist Library of Carthage, Illinois website, \"Clear Spring Church, in Fayette County, was organized in 1829 or earlier, as it united with the Illinois Association in September 1829, James Beck and Guy Beck being the messengers, who reported 9 members. William Sidwell and James Beck were messengers to the Illinois Association in 1830. In 1830, this church was dismissed to go into the constitution of the Kaskaskia Association. The Kaskaskia Association met here in 1834. Elder Isaac Sidwell was also a member here for a few years before moving to northeast Missouri.\"\n\nThe State of Illinois conducted a census in 1835 and William Sr. and Mary appear in the July 3 Fayette County census as heads of household with what appears to be the family of Isaac Denton living with them. I say that because Isaac, David and William appear in the 1830 Federal Illinois census while the 1835 Illinois State census only contains William and David with a family that would match Isaac's enumerated in William Sr.'s household. In this census William Sr. is enumerated as age 61-70 (born 1765-1774) and Mary as age 61-70 (born 1765-1774). Combining these date ranges with those from the 1830 census above, William Sr. was born about 1765-1770 and Mary was born about 1771-1774. Sometime between the 1835 census and the taking of the 1840 census Mary died and between the purchase of 40 acres on March 22, 1838 and the 1840 census William Sr. died. Mrs. Lila M. Mulford wrote in the Vol. 13, No. 3 (1984) issue of the \"Fayette (Illinois) Facts\" newsletter, \"There was a land transaction in which William Sidwell deeded land to Isaac D. Sidwell, 1 Dec., 1838 in Fayette Co., Bk C, p. 250.\" That suggests he knew his health was failing and decided to dispose of his land, thus providing another point to help fix his death date. Children David Sr. and Isaac Denton continued farming in Fayette County for roughly another decade before deciding to pick up stakes and move to Missouri/Iowa.\n\nOne last note. Many trees and the Find A Grave memorial show this person as William Thomas Sidwell. I have found no documents that show William with a middle name. If he did have a middle name I would not think it Thomas unless that was a family name in his mother's family. It was not common in William's family. The William Thomas is also shown as son of Hugh Sidwell and Annie Haines. Hugh and Annie may very well have had a son William Thomas, but he is not the William of Cumberland County, Kentucky.\n\n285. Mary Key, born Bet. 1771-1775; died Bet. 1835 - 1840 in Fayette County, Illinois.\n\nWhen Mary married William Sidwell March 07, 1791 in Greene County, Tennessee Zachariah Key served as security along with William on the marriage bond. While not unheard of it is not common to have a father serve as security on a marriage bond. There were a couple of other Keys in the area at this time. David married Margaret Williams March 22, 1797, then Mary Keller September 17, 1799 both in Greene County, Tennessee. Mary Key married Luke Hail August 4, 1794 in Knox County, Tennessee. Zachariah is not found in the Tennessee marriages and did not serve as a security in these other marriages.\n\nThe lack of Tennessee census records for 1810 and 1820 (only partial) hinders a great deal of the research, but over the next few years more Keys are found in the area via one record or another:\n\n1792 - Andrew Key private Singleton's Company Knox County Militia Territory South of the Ohio River\n\n1793 - Job Key 100 acre land grant Sullivan County, Tennessee\n\n1793 - Zachariah Kee private in Christian's Regiment, Militia Territory South of the Ohio River (Sullivan Co.)\n\n1793 - William Key private in Christian's Regiment, Militia Territory South of the Ohio River (Sullivan Co.)\n\n1794 - Andrew Key private Singleton's Company Knox County Militia Territory South of the Ohio River\n\n1794 - Peter Key private in Kennedy's Regiment, Militia Territory South of the Ohio River (Greene Co.)\n\n1794 - David Key private in Kennedy's Regiment, Militia Territory South of the Ohio River (Greene Co.)\n\n1796 - Joab Key Sullivan County, Tennessee tax list, 59 acres\n\n1797 - Joab Keys Sullivan County, Tennessee tax list, 59 acres\n\n1797 - William Keys Sullivan County, Tennessee tax list, 100 acres\n\n1799 - Zachariah Key \"Formerly lieutenant, Knox County militia\" footnote in 1802 Anderson County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1802 - David Key Anderson County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1802 - Peter Key Anderson County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1802 - Zachariah Key Anderson County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1805 - David Key Greene County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1805 - John Key Greene County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1805 - Zachariah Kee Anderson County, Tennessee tax list\n\n1820 - James Key census for Cumberland County, KY, age 16 thru 25 (1795-1804)\n\n1820 - Theophilus Key census for Cumberland County, KY, age 45 and over (1775 and before)\n\n1830 - Theos Key census for Cumberland County, KY, age 50 thru 59 (1771-1780)\n\n1830 - James Key census for Cumberland County, KY, age 30 thru 39 (1791-1800)\n\n1830 - Golsberry Key census for Cumberland County, KY, age 20 thru 29 (1801-1810)\n\n1830 - David Key census for Greene County, TN, age 50 thru 59 (1771-1780)\n\n1830 - David Key census for Greene County, TN, age 20 thru 29 (1801-1810)\n\n1830 - Peter Key census for Greene County, TN, age 60 thru 69 (1761-1770)\n\n1830 - Dan'l Key census for Greene County, TN, age 60 thru 69 (1761-1770)\n\n1830 - Henry Keys census for Knox County, TN, age 20 thru 29 (1801-1810)\n\n1830 - Peggy Keys census for Knox County, TN, age 20 thru 29 (1801-1810)\n\n1830 - Mathew Keys census for Knox County, TN, age 20 thru 29 (1801-1810)\n\n1830 - David Kee census for Anderson County, TN, age 60 thru 69 (1761-1770)\n\nAccording to the 1810 Cumberland County, Kentucky census Mary Key Sidwell was 26 thru 44 years old (born 1766-1784). In 1820 she was 45 years old and over (born 1775 and before). In 1830 Fayette County, Illinois she was 50 thru 59 years old (born 1771-1780). Unfortunately, without earlier Tennessee census information we are likely at an enpass in trying to determine Zachariah's relationship to Mary. There are some interesting groupings in the list above. Andrew and Zachariah appeared in Knox County with Andrew arriving there first. Then Zachariah appears in neighboring Anderson County. Zachariah is there yet in 1829 to execute the following land transactions. Anderson County Deed Book G-1 1824-1830, page 147, September 28, 1829 Zachariah Key to Nathan A. Farmer, for $50, 10 acres on Brushy Creek and page 148, September 28, 1829 Zachariah Key to Nathan Anderson Farmer, for $300, 98 acres on same Brushy Creek. That is the last occurrence of Zachariah I have been able to find.\n\nDavid and Peter Key begin appearing in Greene County in the early 1790's and continue to appear there into the 1830. In 1830 David (1771-1780), Peter (1761-1770), Daniel (1761-1770) and Mary Key Sidwell (1771-1780), all with Greene County background, are in age groupings to be thought of as siblings. Could Zachariah fit in that category as well? [A note regarding the David and Peter Key who appear in Anderson County. They appear not to be the same as the David and Peter in Greene County. David appears as a witness to deed between Jacob McComb and Obadiah Ashlock on Marcy 25, 1818, is enumerated in the 1830 Anderson County census, and appears in Anderson County tax lists of 1837 and 1838. Peter does not reappear in Anderson County.]\n\nThe elder David Key in the 1830 Greene County census was the David who married Margaret Williams March 22, 1797 in Greene County, security John Jones. When she died he married Mary Keller September 17, 1799 in Greene County, securities Jesse Carter and James Stinson. David died in Greene County on June 6, 1842 and his will is posted on page 243, Will Book Vol. 1-2 1828-1897. The will lists wife Mary and children John, Peter, Mary, Elizabeth, Lurrinda, and Alfred. A couple of names that appear in the older generation. Dan'l Key from the 1830 Greene County census died in Greene County April 07, 1840 leaving a will posted on page 217 Will Bolk Vol. 1-2 1828-1897 in which he leaves everything to his wife Temperance \"...two shares of all the lands that David Key owns towit to include the house and improvements where I now live as long as she lives...\". Peter Key from the 1830 census is not to be found in the 1840 census, and a will is also not to be found. I suspect that Zachariah, Andrew, the elder David, Peter, Daniel and Mary Key Sidwell are all siblings, but can not prove that with the material I have access to.\n\nThe Theophilus Key found in 1820 Cumberland County (born 1775 and before) may be, I suspect, the Theophilus Key who married Lucy Bibee on November 08, 1805 in Tyrrell County, North Carolina. Between the 1820 and 1830 censuses it appears Theophilus was born 1771-1775, which would put him in the same time frame as David, Peter, Daniel and Mary above. Could that be a reason Theophilus relocated to Cumberland County, or was that just a coincidence? I am not sure about the James Key who appears for the first time in the 1820 Cumberland County census, as does Theophilus. Comparing his 1820 and 1830 census entries places his birth as 1795-1800. That is prior to the marriage of Theophilus, or was the marriage to Lucy Bibee the second marriage for Theophilus? Or perhaps there is no relationship between Theophilus and James. On the other hand the Golsberry Key that appears in the 1830 census could qualify as a son of Theophilus. There is another son in the 1830 census who appears to be married and with family living with Theophilus and Lucy, and he also is in the 1801-1810 age group as is Golsberry. Goldsberry appears in the 1840 Crawford County, Indiana census, page 470, with a James Key family on the next line. In the 1850 census Goolsbury's family appears in neighboring Orange County, Indiana and he is recorded as born about 1807/1808 in Tennessee and oldest son born about 1831/1832 in Kentucky. The 1870 shows he was born in North Carolina and 1880 census also shows that, along with his father and mother also being born in North Carolina. The next family is the William Key family and he is recorded as born about 1808/1809 in Tennessee and could qualify as a son of Theophilus, especially since they have a son, age 10, and named Theophilus.\n\nThere is another Theophilus in the \"neighborhood\" that needs to be looked at. Across the Kentucky state line, in Overlon County, Tennessee census for 1820, there is a Theophilus Kea family and the head of household is age 26 thru 44 (1776-1794). Then this Theophilus disappears, but in 1836 Anderson Key appears in the Overton County tax list. His 1850 Overton County census records him as born about 1805/1806 in North Carolina. He had a son Goolsby Key born about 1824/1825 in Tennessee. I do not know who the Theophilus was, but I am not sure whether the spelling was meant to be Key, or some other surname. As for the Anderson Key family, a story in \"History of Overton County, Tennessee\" by Overton County History Book Committee, 1992, written by Luther B. Atkinson says, \"The Keys have run lineage back to my great-great-grandfather, Benjamin Anderson Key, who with his wife, Mary Newberry, his widowed mother and four brothers came from Virginia via IN to Tennessee around 1810. It has been told that he took the name of Key after his mother and that his real name should have been Campbell.\" DNA testing seems to confirm this point. The similarity between the name Goolsby in Overton County and Goolsbury in Cumberland County is eerie.\n\nI am afraid we have made no headway regarding the relationship of Zachariah to Mary, but I am thinking that he is most likely a brother to Mary rather than father. Hopefully this information will help someone else be able to jump start some more in-depth research.\n\nThe children for William and Mary was recorded by some unknown individual originally and has been handed down from tree to tree with no documented proof. I am sorry to say I also do not have proof for most of the children either. I will attempt to develop a circumstantial argument for those I can and in other instances I will not attempt to guess the names where the census has suggested the presence of someone in a particular age category. I would welcome someone coming forward with documentation that proves names and relationships.\n\nChildren of William Sidwell, Sr. and Mary Key are:\n\nii. Son Sidwell, born Abt. 1794 in probably Knox County, Tennessee; died Unknown.\n\nI believe this is the next oldest child in the William/Mary Sidwell household based on the age grouping for the next two daughters. In the 1810 census the next two oldest girls were 10 thru 15 years old (1795-1800) while the oldest son was born 1794/1795 as explained next. Most researchers have this son as William Jr. It is possible this assignment was the result of the 1820 census where 2 William Sidwells appear in the Cumberland County enumeration. Let's look at that more closely, concentrating only on the male entries:\n\n1810 Burksville, Cumberland County, Kentucky, page 180, line 37, William Sidwell entry\n\n2 males under 10\n\n1801-1810 1 male 16 thru 25\n\n1785-1794 1 male 45 and over\n\n1765 and before\n\ntic mark for William may be in wrong column\n\n1820 Paoli, Cumberland County, Kentucky, page 154, line 38, the senior William Sidwell entry\n\n2 males 10 thru 15\n\n1805-1810 1 male 16 thru 25\n\n1795-1804 1 male 45 and over\n\n1775 and before\n\nSo there were 3 sons in 1810 and still 3 sons in 1820 in the William Sidwell household. This does not tell us who the eldest son was but does tell us that he was born 1794/1795. So who was the other William Sidwell found on line 33, page 154 in the 1820 census? The place to start might be the line above, i.e. Joseph Sidwell, Sr. presumed possible brother of the senior William Sidwell.\n\n1810 Burksville, Cumberland County, Kentucky, page 181, line 2, Joseph Sidwell, Sr. entry\n\n4 males under 10\n\n1801-1810 1 male 10 thru 15\n\n1795-1800 1 male 16 thru 25\n\n1785-1794 1 male 26 thru 44\n\n1766-1784\n\n1820 Paoli, Cumberland County, Kentucky, page 154, line 32, Joseph Sidwell, Sr. entry\n\n3 males 10 thru 15\n\n1805-1810 1 male 16 thru 25\n\n1795-1804 1 male 45 and over\n\n1775 and before\n\nSo Joseph Sr. has 2 fewer sons in the 1820 household from his 1810 household. Coincidentally there are two new Sidwell families in the 1820 Cumberland County census.\n\nThe first new Sidwell in the 1820 census is the next line below Joseph Sr., namely a William Sidwell, age 16 thru 25. The other new Sidwell in the 1820 census is John found on page 152, line 22, just 3 lines below Jesse Carpenter who married Polly Sidwell. John is age 26 thru 44. Thus John could have graduated from the 1810 16 thru 25 age group to now have his own household in 1820, while William could have graduated from the 1810 10 thru 15 age group to now have his own household in 1820. The 4 sons under 10 in 1810 then filled the 3 age 10 thru 15 and 1 age 16 thru 25 groupings. I have not found any primary documents to prove this position, but it seems there is a lack of information to say the younger William in 1820 is William Jr., son of the elder William.\n\nThere is a William Sidwell that appears across the state line in the Overton County, Tennessee 1830 census in age group 30 thru 40 (1791-1800) and the younger William Sidwell that was in Cumberland County in 1820 is not present there in 1830. The William in the 1820 Cumberland census has no boys and one girl under 10 years old. The William in the 1830 Overton census has one boy under 5 years of age, one girl under 5 years of age, and 2 girls ages 5 thru 9. It is possible these are one in the same William. The trouble is there is not enough evidence here to determine who the Overton County William belongs to. Later censuses show him as born about 1799 in Tennessee, so it would be unlikely he is son of the elder William of Cumberland County since the older son of William of Cumberland County is likely born 1794/1795 and the younger boys were born after 1800.\n\nWhile we are in Overton County, Tennessee, many trees show a William Sidwell, Jr. son of William Sr. and Mary Key Sidwell. and have him married to Anna in 1819 Cumberland County, and with children Sara J., Harriet C., Martha C., Nancy O., Matilda B., Liza W., and William Thomas III. This looks suspiciously and exactly like the W. S. Sidwell family in the 1880 Overton County, Tennessee census with the only child missing from that family being William Thomas III. The 1941 death record for daughter Martha gives her parents names as William Sidwell and Anna Rigsby. With the census giving William's birth as about 1825 and Anna's as about 1832 it would be hard to see this individual as a candidate for William Jr. of Cumberland County who married an Anna in 1819.\n\nAn additional William also needs to be looked at. Several trees, as well as Find A Grave, have a William Thomas Sidwell, Jr. as this son and buried in Unionville Cemetery in Appanoose County, Iowa in 1875. It is noted that he enlisted November 01, 1862 at Louisville, Kentucky (his residence) in service to the Union cause in Company D, Kentucky 12th Infantry Regiment and was mustered out on July 11, 1865 at Greensboro, North Carolina. This would mean he was 68 years old when he enlisted?! This William T., the Union soldier, was alive and enumerated on the 1890 Veterans census in Overton County, Tennessee, which would now have made him 96 if he were the son of William and Mary. His Civil War pension index shows his death date and location as February 05, 1923 at Kyles, Missouri, which would now have made him 129 if he were the son of William and Mary. Obviously this person can not be the son in question and was likely arrived at by the mistaken notion that the father was William Thomas, so this son must also be William Thomas.\n\nFacts regarding William T. Sidwell, the soldier, follow. First, I researched the cemetery listings at the Iowa State Historical Library in Des Moines and found no Sidwell buried in Unionville Cemetery in Appanoose County, Iowa, let alone a William Thomas Sidwell. There are Sidwells buried in Oakland Cemetery near Moulton and Exline Cemetery in Exline, but they are not of William's family line. Second, William T. Sidwell was not born in 1794. His Civil War papers found on Fold3.com show he was 21 years old at enlistment November 19, 1862, i.e. born ca 1841. According to the papers, he was born in Clinton County, Kentucky. The 1850 Clinton County, Kentucky census, page 206B, shows a Thomas Sidwell, age 10, in the Nancy Sidwell household, Nancy being the widow of Joseph Sidwell, Jr., son of Joseph Sr. who was possible brother to the elder William Sidwell. In the 1860 Clinton County, Kentucky census, page 193, he is enumerated as Wm. T., age 19, and still living in Nancy's household. William T. enlisted at Liberty, Casey County, Kentucky November 19, 1862 for a period of 3 years and was mustered in as Private in Company D, 12th Regiment Kentucky Infantry Union Forces at Louisville on January 17, 1863. He was described as a farmer with blue eyes, light hair, fair complexion, and height 5 feet 10 inches. Private William T. was mustered out July 11, 1865 in Greensboro, North Carolina. After his discharge Pvt. William T. married Margaret Warren and their young family is found in 1880 Ovoerton County, Tennessee census, page 259B. Pvt. William T. is listed there on the 1890 Veterans census in Overton County, Tennessee complete with his military unit assignment and dates. In the 1900 Wayne County, Missouri census, page 10, the William T. family resides in St. Francois Township and he gives his birth date as June 1841. He remained in Wayne County Missouri until his death February 05, 1923 according to his Civil War pension. He filed for his invalid pension June 16, 1883 in Tennessee and received certificate #427592. This gives his death date with location as Kyles, Missouri, an extinct community in Wayne County. He was a widower and living in the home of his daughter and son-in-law Parilee and Nathan Hicks when he died. He was indeed named William Thomas, but not a son of William and Mary Key Sidwell.\n\nNow for an additional note in Overton County, Tennessee. On page 249 of the 1820 Overton County census there is a John Sidwell in the 26 thru 44 age group (1766-1794). He is likely closer to 1794 and 1766 as the female is in age group 16 thru 25 (1795-1804). Those are the only individuals enumerated in this household. Four lines above this entry is one for the Richard Melton household. This will be important in a later narrative. This John is not John, son of Joseph Sidwell, Sr. as he is in the 1820 Cumberland County census and every Cumberland/Clinton County census through 1860. John of Overton County is in the 1830 census but seems to disappear after that. In that 1830 census enumeration he is in the 30-39 age group, which, when combined with the 1820 enumeration suggests he was born 1791-1794. Then in the 1850 census a David Sidwell appeared that could very will have been a son of John.\n\nDavid appeared in the 1836 and 1837 Overton County, Tennessee tax lists, so I am not sure why he was not enumerated in the 1840 census. The 1850 census shows him as 32 years old, born about 1818 in Kentucky. That is consistent with John's oldest son in 1830 enumerated in the 10-14 age group (born 1816-1820). In that same census William Sidwell of Overton County had only one son and he was under 5 years of age (born 1826-1830). David's family appeared in the Overton census again in 1860, then sometime after 1860 the family moved to Fayette County, Illinois, same as William and Mary sons David and Isaac Denton did ca 1828. In the 1870 Fayette County census David is missing and evidently dead, with his widow and 7 children were living in Wilberton, Fayette County.\n\nUser bpoores1 included a narrative in her Ancestry.com tree for David as follows, \"This summary was found in a record search on the Sidwell family by Alice Helen Kaiser Sidwell, wife of Jesse David Sidwell, born March 28, 1896, died Oct. 10, 1974, son of George Washington Sidwell, born March 4, 1848, Oakley, Overton County, Tennessee, died July 20, 1933 of pnemonia and stroke, buried in Mt. Gilead Cemetery, Greenville, IL. George Washington was the son of David Sidwell and Jane Penina Taylor.\"\n\n\"Alice's research discovered that David and family were burned out in Tennessee. They and several other families came north by wagons and oxen making about twenty miles a day. David served in the Civil War; his papers show that he enlisted for one year. He was mustered in on Sept. 15, 1861 at Camp Zollecoffee, and discharged Dec. 16, 1961 but final date of discharge is April 28, 1862. It was said that he carried mail in the service. Census records show them in Tennessee in 1860 and in 1870 are in Illinois under the name of Penina Scydwell, not Sidwell. In Tennessee she used the name of Jane. The story is told that Jane Penina fell out of a hayloft, broke her neck and died. There is no record of where she is buried but they were living in Fayette County, IL. David died a short time after they got to Illinois of a gunshot in the heel which resulted in gangrene, was buried in Pleasant Grove Cemetery, Logootee, Ill, but no grave marker.\"\n\nOne last comment regarding John and David Sidwell of Overton County. Isaac Denton Sidwell, whose narrative is below, is thought to be a son of William and Mary Key Sidwell. In his obituary it is stated he visited Overton County in 1844. Why did he go to Overton County? Could it be to visit \"brother\" John? It is thought by some that John died around this time frame. Was that a contributing factor, or simply a coincidence?\n\nI believe John Sidwell deserves more attention as a possible candidate for this son of William/Mary. Another reason for considering the name is because Jonathan was among the other members of the Cumberland County Baptist Church - Rebecca Sidwell, Polly Sidwell, Susannah Sidwell and Jonathan Sidwell. I do not believe this Jonathan was a son of Joseph Sidwell, Sr. as Joseph Sr. was not mentioned as being part of this church. I know there are questions that need to be answered - How could John be in Overton County in 1820 and there be a son born 1794/1795 enumerated in William and Mary's household in Cumberland County? Why did John's household in 1820 Overton County not have any children enumerated when the 1830 census showed a son born 1816-1820? Could they have been readying a move to Overton County in 1820 but were still in Cumberland County at the time of the census enumeration, and because John had been in the Overton area earlier a neighbor gave his information to the census enumerator without knowing who all was in the household (this happened to one of my Sexton relatives).\n\nOne other scenario certainly needs to be mentioned. Just as happened with my Forsythe family line, this son may have been born with disabilities, or been severely disabled in a farm accident, and may have died before the family left for Illinois.\n\niii. Daughter Sidwell, born Bet. 1795 and 1800 in probably Knox County, Tennessee; died Unknown.\n\nThere are two daughters in this age groupings in the 1810 census and in the case of the first one I look at here she has yet to have been found in the 1850 or later censuses. In fact, there has been no confirmed census after 1810 to use as a barometer to better gauge her age. Several researchers have this daughter as Lucinda Sidwell, born about 1793 in Cumberland County, and married Moses Beck February 6, 1840 in Fayette County, Illinois. This is an assignment that does not make sense for several reasons. The 1840 censuses for Fayette County, Illinois and Effingham County, Illinois do not contain any Sidwells who have a female in the age grouping of this daughter. There is one possible Beck family in Fayette County that contains a male fitting the age category. There is no Moses Beck in the 1845 Illinois State census from which to look at age categories, nor is there any entry for Moses Beck in the 1850 Illinois census.\n\nWhat is in the 1850 census are 3 Beck children, David age 10, Lewis age 7, and Franklin age 4, living in the Montgomery County, Illinois household of William and Rebecca Simpson. David's death record says his parents were Moses Beck and Lucinda Sidwell as does Franklin's death record. Then Moses is recorded as marrying Emily Caroline Barlow November 06, 1851 in Montgomery County, Illinois. So Lucinda died circa 1849 and their 3 children were being cared for in a \"foster home\". Emily and Moses had six children in their 53 years of marriage.\n\nMoses was born October 02, 1819 in Montgomery County, Illinois and died March 06, 1904 in Nokomis, Montgomery County, Illinois. Lucinda is thought to have been born circa 1793, a 26 year age spread, which is point one in considering the veracity of this partnering. Lucinda would have been 48 years old with the birth of their first son, David, and 53 years old with the birth of their last son, Benjamin, which is point two in considering the veracity. Those ages at childbirth are not unheard of, but are rare. It is possible Lucinda traveled to Fayette County after the 1835 census when her father and mother were failing and stayed after their death and married Moses. I also can imagine that having children at ages 48 to 53 could affect her health and cause death at age 56. This scenario is a possibility, however I find this paring very much in question.\n\nOne parting comment on this pairing. Mrs. Lila M. Mulford wrote in the Vol. 13, No. 3 (1984) issue of the \"Fayette (Illinois) Facts\" newsletter, \"Lucinda Sidwell m Moses Beck, 16 Feb., 1840. She was supposed to be under age, but no consent was found.\" This seems to be one more argument that the name Lucinda for a daughter of William and Mary may have been falsely assumed from this Fayette County marriage record. See son David Sidwell Sr.'s narrative for more on Lucinda.\n\nAnother pairing that seems to make sense, but has no documented proof, is presented. Other researchers also use the name Lucinda for this daughter, but have her married to Richard Melton, Jr. Richard Jr. was born about 1790 in North Carolina according to his 1850 Clinton County, Kentucky census record, but he was in Cumberland County, Kentucky by 1810 where he is enumerated in his parents home. There he is in the Richard Melton, Sr. household in the 16 thru 25 age group (born 1785-1794). In the 1820 Overton County, Tennessee census Richard Jr. and young family are enumerated on page 249, 4 lines above the John Sidwell household. The Richard Jr. household has one son under age of 10 with Richard as age 26 thru 44 (born 1776-1794) and a female age 10 thru 15. The female shown as age 10 thru 15 could very well be his wife with the tick mark in the wrong age column. One column to the right would be age 16 thru 25 (born 1795-1804). This would be consistent with the 1830 census where the only females in the household are 1 under age 5, 1 age 10 thru 14, and 1 age 30 thru 39 (born 1791-1800). The 1830 census places the Richard Jr. family in Cumberland County, Kentucky, page 135, 4 lines after Joseph Sidwell, Sr., 3 lines after John Sidwell (son of Joseph, Sr.), and 1 line before Isaac Sidwell (son of Joseph, Sr.). In 1830 Richard Sr. is now in Overton County, Tennessee, widowed with a presumed son and granddaughter.\n\nIn 1840 the Richard Jr. family was enumerated in Clinton County, Kentucky [Clinton County was formed from Wayne and Cumberland Counties in 1836] and now noted as Richard Sr. as his oldest son was named Richard. He was 2 lines away from Isaac Sidwell (son of Joseph Sr.) and 3 from John Sidwell (son of Joseph Sr.) and son John Melton was the next line after John Sidwell and just 3 lines from the bottom of the page. On the second line of the next page is Josiah (Joseph) Sidwell, Jr., line 4 is Thomas Sidwell (son of Joseph Sr.) and line 13 is Josiah (Joseph) Sidwell, Sr. The household contained 3 sons and 3 daughters with no one under age 5. The older female is age 50 thru 59 (born 1781-1790). It is possible this person was a housekeeper as it is thought that Lucinda died between 1835 and 1840. Then by late 1840 he married Phoebe Hutchenson and they had another 5 or 6 children.\n\nIn the 1850 Clinton County census, starting with page 206B, the family is surrounded by Sidwell \"relatives\": family #319 Nancy Sidwell (Jospeh Jr.'s widow), family #320 Hardin Daniel (wife Lavina, daughter of Joseph Sidwell, Sr.), family #321 Richard Melton Jr., family #322 William Daniel (wife Delilah Sidwell, daughter of Joseph Sidwell, Sr.), family #323 John Melton (son of Richard Sr.), family #324 Richard Melton Sr., family #326 John Sidwell (son of Joseph Sr.). With all this \"closeness\" to family members of Joseph Sidwell, Sr.'s family members it would be easy to assume Richard's first wife was of that family, however the 1810 census for Joseph Sr.'s household shows no daughters, only sons. This Melton family did not appear in the 1860 census and only Phoebe shows as head of household in 1870 and 1880 Barren County, Kentucky censuses. The 1870 census shows the youngest child as Shadrick, born March 06, 1859 in Barren County with parents identified on his birth record as Richard Melton and Pheba Hutchinson, so it is presumed Richard died between 1858 and 1870.\n\nAs an interesting side note, Nancy A. Meton, widow of veteran John L. Melton son of Richard Sr., was found on the 1890 Veterans Schedule for Overton County, Tennessee. She was found on line 9 and William T. Sidwell was found on line 1.\n\nThis latter scenario seems the most logical of the two given. Close proximity and closeness of ages seems to make the most sense, which makes this good possibility for further research. After all this information, this daughter's first name may not even be Lucinda. That name was probably assumed by the unknown individual who originally \"identified\" the family of William and Mary, without giving documentation, because of the record of the marriage of a Lucinda Sidwell to Moses Beck in Fayette County, Illinois and as a result jumped to the assumption she must be a daughter of William and Mary Key Sidwell. Another possibility for the name could be Susannah as other members of the Cumberland County Baptist Church were Rebecca Sidwell, Polly Sidwell, Susannah Sidwell and Jonathan Sidwell. Are there any other scenarios that seem to make sense? Can anyone come up with the documentation that proves or disproves either of these scenarios?\n\nvii. Anna Sidwell, born Abt. 1806 in Cumberland County, Kentucky; died Aft. probably 1870 in Kansas; married Joseph Carter, Jr. 1823 in Kentucky; born 1804 in Cumberland County, Kentucky; died Aft. 1870 probably in Kansas.\n\nThe 1810 census for William Sidwell shows 2 daughters under age 10 (born 1801-1810). Those 2 daughters in 1820 are shown in the 10 thru 15 age group (born 1805-1810). In that same census, Joseph Sidwell, Sr. has no daughters. This name was given as Anne Elizabeth without documentation and has been adopted by many trees, but I have found no instances where the name Elizabeth has presented itself. She is supposed to have married Joseph Carter about 1823 in Cumberland County, Kentucky.\n\nIn the 1820 Cumberland County census, page 154, there is a Joseph Carter, age 45 and over, and one of the presumed children in the household is a son age 16 thru 25 (born 1795-1804). This Joseph Carter arrived in Cumberland County around the time of the Sidwells and Guthries, receiving a land grant on Illwill Creek, survey date June 27, 1805. There are 11 other Carter households in Cumberland County, but this is the only household with a son in this age grouping. This Joseph Carter household is on line 36, 3 lines from the bottom on the page. On this same page Joseph Sidwell, Sr. is line 32, William Sidwell is line 33, and William Sidwell is line 38. This would certainly offer opportunity for plenty of socialization for the Carter son age 16 thru 25 and the 2 Sidwell daughters age 10 thru 15. Looking ahead to the 1830 Cumberland County census all Carters had gone elsewhere except the Joseph from the 1820 census, and he is now in the 60 thru 69 age group. This household also does not contain a son who would be a 10 year older equivalent of the 16 thru 25 year old from 1820.\n\nSo where was that son in 1830? He could possibly be the one who is found in Fayette County, Illinois, page 245. There are 2 males in the 20 thru 29 age grouping (born 1801-1810) and one female in the same age grouping. There are 3 children, 1 son age 5 thru 9 (born 1821-1825) and 1 son and 1 daughter under age 5 (1826-1830). This family is on line 24 and on the same page are Isaac Sidwell's family, line 13, and William Sidwell's family, line 14. The Joseph Carter family appears again in the 1835 Fayette County, Illinois census, then disappears from Fayette County after this point - not present in the 1840 census.\n\nThey next appear in the 1847 Iowa census, but first some notes from Davis County, Iowa history. \"The Ferry privileges were an item in days of stage coaches, and prairie schooners. Early in the 1844, a man named Van Caldwell, kept a ferry across the Des Moines river, at a place called 'Caldwell's Ferry,' where the old 'Mormon Trace' crossed the river; and on paying $3 into the treasury, Davis county gave him the exclusive right to run a ferry there. His rates of ferriage were ordered to be the same as required by Van Buren county. At the same time, Job Carter for $5, was given the exclusive ferry privileges, at the place where the 'Territorial Road,' from Iowa City, Iowa, to Jefferson City, Missouri, crosses the Des Mines river, and his rates for ferriage were ordered to be,\n\nFor man and horse\n\n12 1/2 cts.\n\nFor man\n\n6 1/4 cts.\n\nFor horse\n\n6 1/4 cts.\n\nFor man and two-horse wagon\n\n25 cts.\n\nFor each head of cattle\n\n6 cts.\n\nFor each head of sheep and hogs\n\n3 cts.\n\n\"The great wolf hunter of Davis county, was Joseph Carter, who was paid $4, for killing wolves, in 1844, receiving the first bounty paid by Davis county. He became quite celebrated, in those days, as a wolf and deer hunter.\n\n\"Salt Creek township was first settled by James H. Jordan, Van Caldwell, Jesse Testament, Job Carter, William Higgins, Henry Smith, John Tollman, Peter Woods, and others, in 1837 and 1838.\n\n\"Wyacondah township had among its early settlers Henry Dooley, Joel Fenton, Samuel and Reuben Riggs, James Rigsly, Snow Sailing, Jonathan Riggs, Anderson Willis, Abner Tharp, Joseph Carter, Adam Smith, William Russell, John Bragg, David Howell.\n\n\"Hill, James A., ... was married May 5, 1854, to Mary A., daughter of Joseph and Anna Carter, who were among the first settlers of this county. They have had seven children, William D., Henry T., Martha A. wife of Moses McClure; Isabelle, Emeline, Leonard F. and Eva D.\"\n\nThese quotes are from \"History of Davis County, Iowa, Containing a History of the County, Its Cities, Towns, Etc.\", State Historical Company, Des Moines, 1882.\n\nA Job Carter was enumerated in 1820 Cumberland County, Kentucky and the Davis County censuses identify him as born in Kentucky. This may be one in the same person, and from his age could be a brother or cousin to Joseph. [Note: Job's son, Job, died May 26, 1909 in Eldon, Wapello County, Iowa and his death record showed his parents as Job Carter and Sarah Maberry. Could Sarah have been a sister to Rebecca, wife of Isaac Denton Sidwell?] It appears Joseph and Anna moved to Davis County, Iowa quite early and the censuses confirm this. Joseph, Job and James Carter families are in the 1847 census. Joseph, age 46 born in KY; Ann, age 46 born in KY; Parry L. age 24 born in KY; Davis age 20 born in IL; Joshua age 18 born in IL; Polly age 16 born in IL; George age 15 born in IA; James age 13 born in IA; Mahala age 9 born in IA; John age 7 born in IA all appear in the 1850 Wyacondah Township, Davis County, Iowa census, page 292B, family 32. On the same page, family 30, is the David Sidwell family The 1856 Wyacondah Township State of Iowa census, page 946, shows the Joseph Carter family, with children James, Mahala and John as the only children left in the household, and with the column for how long they have resided in Iowa responded to by Joseph and Anna as 18 years (i.e. since 1838).\n\nSon George Washington Carter, as found in the 1850 Davis County, Iowa census, died September 13, 1913 in Moulton, Appanoose County, Iowa. Joseph is given as the father and his mother is given as Sarah Sidwel. I show no record of Joseph's wife being called Sarah. Either his wife was Sarah Anna or the person providing the information for the death certificate, son Abner B. Carter, mistakenly called her Sarah. The latter is the most probable. Abner was not even born until after his grandparents had moved to Kansas, and he was probably not very familiar with them at all. This seems to suggest that Joseph married an Anna Sidwell, but I have seen nowhere where she has the name Elizabeth. I can only combine this piece of information with the previous information to infer that Anna is daughter of William and Mary Key Sidwell.\n\nIn the 1860 Iowa census Joseph and Anna are at home in Wyacondah Township, Davis County with daughter Mahala and son John. This same family unit is next found in 1865 Kansas State census in Belmont Township, Woodson County. In the 1870 Kansas census Joseph and Anna, along with family members, are at home in Toronto Township (P.O. Neosho Falls), Woodson County, but are not found in the 1875 Kansas State census or any other documents after that date.\n\nThis has not proven that Anna was a daughter of William and Mary Key Sidwell. Her age puts her in a census category consistent with the children of William and Mary. She was consistently identified as born in Kentucky in the 1850 census and later. The families consistently followed each other, first the Carters moving with the Sidwells to Fayette County, Illinois followed by David and Isaac Denton following the Carters to the Davis County, Iowa area.\n\n286. George W. Guthrie, Sr., born likely Abt. 1780 in probably Sullivan County, Western North Carolina Territory (current Tennessee); died Aft. 1840 in Fayette County, Illinois. He was the son of 572. Adam Guthrie and 573. Mary Anderson. He married 287. Hannah ?.\n\nNotes for George W. Guthrie, Sr.:\n\nFrom the narrative for Adam and Mary Anderson Guthrie we know that Adam resided in Cumberland County, Kentucky when he wrote his will (May 1, 1825) and when his will was proved (August 20, 1827). That narrative also identified the land purchases made by Guthries in Cumberland County:\n\nGrantee Acres Book Page Date Survey County Watercourse Guthery, James 50 3 459 8/25/1805 Cumberland Illwill Cr Guthry, Adam 92 1/2 7 582 10/11/1806 Cumberland None Guthrey, Geo 200 9 87 8/29/1805 Cumberland Illwill Cr Guthery, Adam 130 19 485 7/3/1806 Cumberland Illwill Cr\n\nThe 1810 Cumberland County census shows 3 Guthrie family units:\n\nGeorge Guthrie family, page 180, line 32\n\n2 males under 10 2 females under 10 1 male 26-44 1 female 26-44\n\nJames Guthrie family, page 180, line 35\n\n1 male under 10 1 female 16-25 1 male 26-44\n\nHannah Guthrie family, page 177, line 1\n\n2 males 10-15 1 female under 10 2 females 10-15 1 female 26-44\n\nThe page numbering on the 1810 census is confusing.
