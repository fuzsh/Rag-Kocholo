Their purpose is acquisition of treasuries, carrying of beautiful objects , and preservation of values across the generations.\n\nBurdened Banker Busy Bee\n\n[Sweetly Suave Shukra] -ruled Bharani masculine-figures are the Money Guys. Yamuna-born are often found in the worlds of banking, valuation, capital markets, currency-trading, mints and coinage. Connoisseurs of pricing and aggressive deal-makers, they vigorously seek acquisition of precious objects. In addition to their financial abilities, due to their intuitive understanding of sound-and-color values, bharani males may also pursue careers in music and arts. Most Bharani men can sing beautifully.\n\nThe harmonious arrangements of Apa-bharanishe may be lovely even while they vigorously compete for dominance. Their expertise in the fields of preservation, containment, and collecting may extend to wines, perfumes, fine textiles, works of art, and any commodity which may capitalize or increase in value. Like all Shukra-governed births, they must take care to avoid the misuse of drugs and alcohol.\n\nThemes of competitive acquisition, precious sounds and song, and investment in cherished values may contextualize Bharani's terrestrial experience. Applies also to Chandra in Bharani.\n\nDistinctive Features of the Nativity\n\nPOTUS-25 Gold Standard 1843-1901 William McKinley\n\n[Sparkling Splendid Surya]\n\npitri-karaka [father] jyoti-karaka [light]\n\n[dikbala]\n\n[political-theatrical vidya-pati for Mesha indriya-lagna]\n\n[bright focus of hierarchical elite]\n\n[confidently displays conventional social authority]\n\n[center-stage command roles in regulatory governance]\n\n[tends to dull the independent intelligence, yet can shine in status-ranked, legitimating corporate institutional structures]\n\n[class-conscious bureaucratic boss-leader-executive father]\n\n...\n\n[collaborative-mercantile Śrāvaṇa-3] [navamsha Surya-Mithuna] intuitively confident detailed explanations instructions\n\n[Surya-yuti-Chandra]\n\n[Surya-yuti-Guru]\n\n[Surya-Makara-Draco] Savitra * the stimulator * brightly charismatic confidence of Center-stage Surya radiates through the hierarchical structuring rashi of Shani\n\n[Surya in bhava-10] bright center of hierarchy * confidently governing * legislative intelligence * focus on social order * regulatory entitlements * political authority * brilliant career * eye on elite positions * radiant reputation * sparkling center of the leadership drama * father may be a governor, director, supervisor, boss\n\n[Surya-yuti-Chandra] confidently sensitive * bright comforter * entitled to parent * radiantly rhythmic * creatively intelligent mother * emotional father-figure * sensitive to the spiritual rays of the Sun * politically and culturally aligned parents\n\n[Surya-yuti-Guru] confidently expansive in drama * generous in games * smart children * multiple father-figures * brightly self-referential teachers * charitably manifests the spiritual rays of the Sun * creatively intelligent doctrine * entitled to philosophize * inclusively idealistic in romance\n\nOUTCOMES -

ISM was 23 + WM was 27 when they married. Although beautiful, intelligent and an unfailing supporter of her husband's career, ida suffered from fragile health both mentally and physically, including epilepsy.\n\nEnduring an endless grief from the tragic early deaths of both of her daughters which coincided with the death of her mother, ida was increasingly unable to attend public functions.\n\nHer epilepsy and other health concerns were compassionately accommodated by her husband, who showed her every respect and affection in public. His finances might at times have been somewhat strained by his wife's condition\n\nshe would have been integrated easily into his large family of origin [2] and his religious ideology would also have smoothed any unevenness in their public presentation.\n\nShukra-yuti-Shani-yuti-Rahu cluster suggest that additional discrete involvements for Mr. McKinley may have obviated any marital unavailability. Most of Ida's expected social duties as the wife of a high official were carried out by various other ladies. She died quietly in 1907, afew years after her husband was killed.\n\n[Competitive Champion Kuja]\n\nbhratru-karaka [brother] virya-karaka [virile]\n\n[energizing-identifying lagnesha for Mesha indriya-lagna]\n\n[mysterious-revealing randhresha for Mesha indriya-lagna]\n\n...\n\n[financial-evaluating Viśākha-2] [navamsha Mangala-Urisha]\n\n[Mangala-Tula] vigorous pursuit of alliance * penetrating advocacy * thrust toward union * proactive bargaining * military negotiations * push toward terms of agreement * aggressive deal-making *energetic arbitration * athletic balancing * champion of fair contracts\n\n[Mangala in bhava-7] drive toward bargaining * pursuit of agreement * impatient with stagnant arrangements * invasive negotiation * diplomatic dynamics * energized contracts * innovative conquests * pushes toward liaison * invigorates alliances\n\nOUTCOMES - MANGALA\n\ncompetitive bargaining, self-promoting negotiator, pursues agreements, aggressive match-making, dynamic adjustment, fights for justice, forward-pushing diplomacy, conquering warrior in relationships, dominating advocacy, pro-active work in lawcourts, energetically innovative arrangements, champion of pioneering new harmonies [Mangala in bhava-7] rules\n\n1- distinctive attributes of personality, dense material incorporation, individual personification, earthen embodiment, physical integrity, kinetic energy, dance, style of movement, athletic prowess, muscular mobility, unique character, kinetic vitality, circumstances of birth, tangible appearance, coherent social identity\n\n8-unexpected eruptions of regenerating force, occult initiation, mystical revelation, shocking intervention, opaque empowerments, invasive surgery, intensive healing, evolution, violent explosion, sudden identity change, rejuvenation, recycling, rebirth, hidden assets, upheaval, undisclosed secrets, transformative events, discovery, in-laws of first marriage, health of younger sibling-cousin\n\nCAREER - KUJA\n\nlagnesha = Mangala-Tula 7 = identified with Partnerships\n\nKingmaker Mark Hanna\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hanna\n\nMcKinley's boss-friend by all accounts was the influential Ohio coal-and-iron businessman Mark Hanna.\n\nIn the late 1900's in eastern Ohio++ western Pennsylvania, the marketplace was rapidly expanding for investment in mining and minerals. Hanna was pugnacious, controlling, and had big money.\n\nHanna paid all costs of McKinley's political campaigns, which freed McKinley from needing to discover what his electorate wanted . Hanna managed McKinley's career. With few exceptions, Hanna determined McKinley's voting and veto behaviors.\n\nMcKinley was considered by most of his peers and most later historians to have been sorely manipulated by Hanna and Hanna's cohort. In an age of cronyism, entire cohorts of financially privileged and ambitious men would hunt in packs in order to promote their commercial interests.

Most of McKinley's administration was consumed with the issue of USA intervention to liberate Cuba from its colonial owner, spain. When the USA won, philippines, puerto Rico, Guam, and Cuba were ceded by Spain to USA.\n\nWhile McKinley dragged his feet looking for diplomatic solutions [Shukra], the war-mongers accused him of spinelessness and lack of manly ambition. His Assistant Secretary of War at the time, soon to be POTUS-26 National Parks 1858-1919 Theodore Roosevelt, complained that McKinley has \" no more backbone than a chocolate éclair\" .\n\nEventually WM acquiesced to the will of the war-profiteers, and a costly bloody Spanish-American war ensued. The expense of managing the acquired territories have dogged the national budget ever since.
