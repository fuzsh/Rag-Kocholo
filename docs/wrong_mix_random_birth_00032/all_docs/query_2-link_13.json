For current students who wish to move to an Eberly degree program, the minimal College requirement for admission is a 2.0 overall average. Please see the Admission Tab for each major to see specific admission requirements.\n\nEberly GPA Policy\n\nAll degree programs in the Eberly College require a cumulative grade point average of 2.0, unless accreditation standards require a higher cumulative GPA.\n\nAll majors in the Eberly College set performance standards for courses applied to meet major requirements. Performance may be evaluated in 3 different ways, at the discretion of the unit (please see individual major pages). If a major offers areas of emphasis (AOE), the AoE follows the same rules as the rest of the major.\n\na GPA of 2.0 in all courses applied to major requirements;\n\na minimum grade of C- in all courses applied to major requirements;\n\na GPA of 2.0 in all courses applied to major requirements, with a minimum grade of C- in selected courses.\n\nOffice Hours\n\nFaculty must hold regular weekly office hours during the semester/instructional period in which students may consult outside of class time to discuss course content and other related matters. Modality of the office hours will follow that of the course.\n\nFaculty teaching one or more courses are expected to hold a minimum of three regularly scheduled office hours per week outside of class times.\n\nDepending on the course’s modality, these office hours can be scheduled either for face-to-face interaction and/or synchronous online communication.\n\nIn the case of face-to-face courses, instructor may opt to conduct only one office hour synchronous online.\n\nAt least one of the three office hours shall be scheduled on a day the course is not in session.\n\nIn addition to regularly scheduled office hours, faculty shall arrange alternative appointments (by appointment at a mutually convenient time) for students’ conflicts.\n\nOffice hours, including schedule, location, and contact information, shall be listed on the syllabus, on eCampus, and posted near the faculty member's office by the end of the first week of instruction.\n\nPermission to Enroll in a Graduate Course\n\nAs per university policy, students who meet the criteria may seek permission to enroll in a graduate course numbered 500-599.\n\nIf approved, students may enroll for up to one graduate course per semester.\n\nThe percentage of undergraduate students in a 500 level class may not exceed 20% of the overall enrollment.\n\nMinimum and Maximum Load\n\nStudents should earn 15 credits a semester (or 30 credits a year) in order to stay on track in their 4-year graduation plan. A minimum of twelve hours in a semester is required for full-time status. No student enrolled in the College may enroll for more than twenty hours in a semester without permission from the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Student Services and Programs. Typically, overload petitions are restricted to graduating seniors who take degree-pursuant courses, who have a completion rate above 90%, and have earned an overall GPA of 3.00.\n\nCredit by Examination Rules\n\nCredit by examination provides students the opportunity to receive credit in courses by demonstrating that they have acquired sufficient knowledge of a subject without formal enrollment in a course or study in the classroom. This opportunity is offered only to students enrolled full- or part-time at the University. The initiation of a credit-by-examination request does not entitle a student to special in-class instruction or tutoring by an instructor.\n\nStudents may petition to receive credit by examination for any course listed by a department in the College as a course for which credit by examination is appropriately awarded. Applications, course lists, and examination schedules are available each semester.\n\nA student may apply to challenge a course for credit by examination if\n\nThe student is at the time of examination registered in the University\n\nThe student’s official record does not show credit for the course (i.e., any grade of S, P, A, B, C, D, or I)\n\nThe student is not officially enrolled in the course at the time of examination (a student who withdraws from a course after the end of the official registration period is officially enrolled in that course until the end of the semester, and not eligible to take the course by examination during that semester); and\n\nA grade of F, FNA, FSA, IF, or UF has not been recorded on the student’s transcript for the course within 2 calendar years of the date of the examination. A student may challenge the same course by examination only two times\n\nCredit only (not a grade) will be awarded for the successful completion of the examination with a grade of C or higher. Because a comprehensive examination is used to establish credit, it is the policy of the College that a student should demonstrate at least an average (C) knowledge of course content to receive any credit. The criteria for earning a C are made known in advance to students who request the information from the department offering the course examination.\n\nA non-refundable fee is charged for credit by examination and must be paid within the prescribed period prior to each examination period.\n\nProbation and Suspension\n\nAcademic Probation\n\nAfter final grades are complete for the fall and spring semesters, the Registrar notifies students who have a GPA of less than a 2.00 and places them on Academic Probation until their GPA reaches the minimum 2.00. Probationary students must remedy their deficiency during the following semester. Students who accumulate three semesters of Academic Probation and who do not remedy their GPA by the end of the third term of Academic Probation will receive an Academic Suspension.\n\nAcademic Probation\n\nAfter final grades are complete for the fall and spring semesters, the Registrar notifies students who have a GPA of less than a 2.00 and places them on Academic Probation until their GPA reaches the minimum 2.00. Probationary students must remedy their deficiency during the following semester. Students who accumulate three semesters of Academic Probation and who do not remedy their GPA by the end of the third term of Academic Probation will receive an Academic Suspension. The three semesters are in total and need not be consecutive. Please see the university policy on Academic Probation and Suspension for more details.\n\nEberly students who are placed on Academic Probation sign a contract which outlines schedule, meeting, and GPA requirements. Please see the Eberly website for details.\n\nNOTE: The plan of study and the probation contract will be used at the end of the semester if the student has to file an Academic Suspension and/or a Financial Aid appeal.\n\nPlease see the university policy on Academic Probation and Suspension for more details.\n\nEberly students who are placed on Academic Probation sign a contract which outlines schedule, meeting, and GPA requirements. Please see the Eberly website for details.\n\nNOTE: The plan of study and the probation contract will be used at the end of the semester if the student has to file an Academic Suspension and/or a Financial Aid appeal.\n\nDismissal from major\n\nEberly students must meet the benchmarks outlined in the Degree Progress tab; failure to do so may result in removal from the major. All Eberly majors require that students have a 2.00 overall grade point average, but a few programs require a higher GPA. At the discretion of the department and the Dean, students with a GPA of 1.9 may be retained within their major. Students who have a GPA below a 1.9 are placed in the Bachelors of Integrated Studies (BIS) major until they bring their GPA to the desired 2.00. At that point, they can either go back to their original major, or switch to another major, either within or outside of the college. Students in the BIS major are advised in the Academic Affairs Office, where they can explore their major and career choices. This is a temporary placement, usually for one semester. While students are listed in the BIS program, they must remain in contact with their desired program adviser, who will place a note in DegreeWorks to attest the student’s visit. The Eberly Director of Undergraduate Advising will remove the advising hold after students have also met with their desired program adviser.\n\nAcademic Suspension\n\nAfter final grades are posted in fall and spring, the Registrar notifies students who have a deficient GPA (please check the Catalog).\n\nAcademic Suspension Appeals\n\nStudents can file an Academic Suspension appeal by submitting a Suspension Appeal form, along with supporting documentation, to the Director of Undergraduate Advising. Please refer to the College website for important deadline information. The appeals are heard by a committee of faculty.\n\nReadmission after suspension\n\nStudents who have been suspended need to reapply to the university. When they come back to WVU, they are placed on Academic Probation until their GPA reaches a 2.00. Students seeking readmission should consult the Eberly Office of Academic Affairs website, under \"Student seeking Readmission.\"\n\nGraduation\n\nGraduation and Diploma Application\n\nThe semester of graduation, seniors will receive an email from the Registrar's Office to remind them to fill out a graduation application online through their MIX account. The application is usually available the second week of any given semester for graduation at the end of that term, and remains open for about 6 weeks.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nNo candidate can graduate without completing an application for graduation and diploma.\n\nIf students' curriculum is incorrect in DegreeWorks, they should first submit a graduation application and then immediately email ECASUGFORMS@mail.wvu.edu to fill out the proper curriculum change forms.\n\nAfter submitting their application online, students will receive an email confirmation. Subsequently, they will receive a conditional approval email, or a denial notification. The conditional approval does not guarantee graduation.\n\nIf students do not graduate on the date for which they initially applied, the graduation application is submitted automatically for up to three additional semesters.\n\nCommencement Ceremony\n\nIn addition, students who wish to participate in the Commencement Ceremony (May or December) should register on line through the University Graduation website the semester of graduation. Participation in the Commencement Ceremony does not mean that a student will graduate and be eligible to receive a diploma.\n\nStudents may petition the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Student Services and Programs to participate in the Commencement Ceremony prior to completion of their degree requirements if they are registered for their last six credit hours the following semester (Fall, Spring, Summer). For example, a student who will graduate in August and is registered for the last six credits during the summer term may petition the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Student Services and Programs to participate in the May ceremony."
