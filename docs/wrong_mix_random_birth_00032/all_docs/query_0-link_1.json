        "text": "1876 Â· The First Worlds Fair in the U.S.\n\nThe First official World's Fair, was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. 37 Countries provided venues for all to see.\n\n1895 Â· College Hall Catches on Fire\n\nOn January 27, 1895, College Hall catches on fire and is fully consumed within one hour. During the fire, many students and faculty work together to save many of the items in the building. Some of these are library books. They save the books by piling them onto the rugs and dragging them out of the burning building. College Hall is then later rebuilt and renamed Davis Hall after Governor John W. Davis.\n\n1901 Â· Assassination of Mckinley\n\nPresident William McKinley was shot at the Temple of Music, in the Pan-American Exposition, while shaking hands with the public. Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen because he thought it was his duty to do so. McKinley died after eight days of watch and care. He was the third American president to be assassinated. After his death, Congress passed legislation to officially make the Secret Service and gave them responsibility for protecting the President at all times."
