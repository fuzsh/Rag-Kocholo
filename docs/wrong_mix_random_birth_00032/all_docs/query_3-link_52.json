        "text": "Message from the Director\n\nThis report highlights a remarkable year of historic achievement for the women and men of the Secret Service. United in our determination to carry out our integrated mission of protection and investigation, we did so with the practiced perfection for which our agency is known throughout the world.\n\nEvery day, our agency is entrusted with protecting key leaders, locations, and events. In FY 2022, we continued executing our protective responsibilities with 100% incident-free protection while planning, coordinating, and implementing two National Special Security Events, the State of the Union and the 77th United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThis year the Uniformed Division celebrated its 100th anniversary. This diverse team of highly trained professionals protect key locations in the nation’s capital and travel across the world to secure facilities for U.S. Secret Service protectees. In FY 2022, that included 4,867 protectee visits.\n\nSecret Service special agents and criminal analysts also protected the integrity of the U.S. financial system from a broad range of fraud, network intrusions, and other cyber-enabled attacks. This past year, Secret Service employees across the globe prevented more than $2.6 billion in cyber financial crime losses and seized more than $41.5 million in counterfeit currency. These achievements are only possible thanks to innovative training, cutting-edge technologies, and robust investigative partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with our partnership resulted in the return of $286 million in fraudulently obtained Economic Injury Disaster Loans to the Small Business Administration, which will ultimately be returned to the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nTo maintain our standing as one of the world’s preeminent law enforcement organizations, the Secret Service fosters a culture of world-class training and ongoing professional development for all employees. Our agency’s success would not be possible without a cadre of mission support professionals who conducted business processes, secured proper resources, hired new employees, and ensured a safe working environment throughout the year.\n\nOur workforce diversity is critical to tackling the unique challenges of our integrated mission and to maintaining the strength and stability of the legacy we’ve been building since 1865. As we build on our successes, we honor the past by leveraging the collective knowledge and experiences of those who came before us, respect the present by recognizing the hard work and sacrifices of those currently serving, and build on our storied past by promoting positive change through innovation and ingenuity.\n\nAs guardians of the world’s most enduring democracy, we have an obligation that is centuries in the making. The great philosopher Plato once said, “It does not matter if the cobblers and masons fail to do their jobs well, but if the guardians fail, the democracy will crumble.” Our mission is one that cannot fail, and our actions must reflect that reality.\n\nWorking together, our presence, our persistence, and our professionalism are vital to the success of this agency, and by extension to the durability of our democracy.\n\nSafeguarding transportation is a critical element of the protective mission. RTC created the Protective Transportation Training Section to provide special agents and Uniformed Division officers with the skills needed to safeguard protectees across all modes of transportation. At the Secret Service, Robert “Bob” Diehl played an instrumental part in the evolution of the service’s protective transportation capabilities.\n\n“The features we are putting into the armored cars are now light years ahead of when we started. I have no doubt we build the best armored cars in the world.”\n\nAfter completing two tours with the Navy in Vietnam, Bob wanted to continue to serve his country. Bob joined the Secret Service as an officer in what is now called the Uniformed Division and later became a firearms instructor at the Secret Service’s training facility. During this time, he helped create the Counter Assault Team (CAT), a specialized program designed to provide tactical support to Secret Service protective details.\n\nWhile Bob was skillful in firearms and tactical training, he always had a passion for vehicles. In his free time, he could be found in the garage working on cars. Eventually his passion for vehicles led him to the Special Services Division, which is responsible for safeguarding transportation at every aspect of the protective mission.\n\nOriginally, the Protective Transportation Training Section’s only responsibility was teaching the Protective Driving Course in standard vehicles. Once Bob joined the Protective Transportation Training Section, he helped evolve this training to include protective driving training in every wheeled conveyance operated by Secret Service personnel. In addition to teaching motorcade operations and tactical driving techniques, Bob also collaborated with a team of technicians to develop a first-in-class armored vehicle program. This program is responsible for developing the most notable armored vehicle, the presidential limo, also known as “The Beast.”\n\nAfter a lifelong career of service, Bob retired from the Secret Service in 2021. In recognition of his many contributions to the Secret Service, Bob was awarded the DHS Civilian Medal of Honor by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and a building at RTC was named in his honor.\n\nHonoring the past is part of the Secret Service culture. As an agency, employees participate in traditions intended to honor those who have served before. For some employees, this concept takes on an even greater meaning because they not only commemorate the accomplishments of the workforce before them, but also honor the legacy of their parents.\n\nDanielle Davis Watson is the Division Chief of Performance Management and Employee Relations in the Office of Human Resources. In this role, she leads two branches that work to enhance the employee experience, increase agency efficiency, and advance work-life and retention initiatives. Officially, Ms. Davis Watson started her career at the Secret Service in 2009, however, if you ask her, she’ll say it was the year she was born. Ms. Davis Watson explained that the Secret Service has been part of her life for as long as she could remember. She recounted memories of her childhood when her father, a special agent with the Secret Service, would be preparing for protective travel or coming to her elementary school career day to talk about life as a special agent. The Secret Service was a constant part of her life, and the families of her father’s colleagues quickly became a close-knit extended family.\n\n“We have a unique insight on the life of an agent; We lived it with our fathers. It’s built a deep sense of loyalty to the agency and the mission. We understand what their families go through, from the start of their career through retirement. As Human Resources professionals, we have the advantage of customer perspective.”\n\nDANIELLE DAVIS WATSON\n\nMs. Davis Watson's father, Thomas W. Davis Jr., was with the Secret Service for 23 years. Beginning his career in the Uniformed Division, Mr. Davis transitioned to a special agent in 1972. Throughout his career he worked in the Detroit, Baltimore, and Washington Field Offices. At the time of his retirement, Mr. Davis was the Deputy Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations. Ms. Davis Watson recounted that one of the many things her father did at the Secret Service was start a minority and women recruitment program. Through her role in Human Resources, Ms. Davis Watson feels the impact of the program her father created and can continue to contribute to its legacy. She shared that, “by being a leader in Human Resources, I am carrying on his legacy every day.”\n\nPatricia Parr-Brandt started her career with the Secret Service in 1999 and has served in the Office of Human Resources for the past 23 years. Like Ms. Davis Watson’s experience, Ms. Parr-Brandt recounted memories of growing up with a father who was a special agent. Her father, Jerry Parr, joined the Secret Service in the 1960s. Throughout his career, he was the Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) of the Presidential Protection Division, the Deputy Assistant Director of the Office of Protective Research, and the Assistant Director of the Office of Protective Research. Mr. Parr protected the life of President Ronald Reagan during an assassination attempt in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 1981. SAIC Parr shielded the President’s body with his own after shots were fired and propelled the President into the limousine. The driver started heading back to the White House, but after assessing the President’s condition, SAIC Parr re-directed the driver to the hospital, potentially saving President Reagan’s life.\n\nMs. Parr-Brandt remembers that day, and her father’s actions had an impact on why she decided on a career at the Secret Service. Ms. Parr-Brandt knew she wanted to have a career where she could help people. Being inspired by both her parents working in public service, she decided to apply for a role in human resources at the Secret Service. “There is a certain aspect [of following in my father’s footsteps] that inspires and motivates me. People see my last name and they know my legacy. It is very motivating.” As a Human Resources professional, Ms. Parr-Brandt carries on her father’s memory by supporting the men and women of the service through every aspect of their career. “I am proud that he is my father, and I am proud that I work where I work. I will never push someone into a vehicle, but his service is a big part about why I’m here.”\n\nMs. Parr-Brandt's and Ms. Davis Watson’s fathers made a significant impact during their careers at the Secret Service. By continuing in their footsteps, both Ms. Davis Watson and Ms. Parr-Brandt have dedicated their careers to supporting the integrated mission. They honor their fathers' legacies daily, all while finding a way to serve and support the entire workforce and create legacies of their own."
