        "text": "Quantitative surveys\n\nThe response rates for Phases 1, 2 and 3 were 48% (158), 63% (166) and 58% (205), respectively; all within the projected sample range of 75–180 participants, and acceptable for analysis. The total numbers of responses from Ormskirk, Rural and Skelmersdale in Phase 1 were 98, 33 and 27, respectively; with corresponding figures of 89, 48 and 29 for Phase 2, and 74, 66 and 86 for Phase 3.\n\nThe proportion of younger participants reduced over the surveys: those aged under 65 years reduced from 20% in Phase 1 to 12% in Phase 2 to 9% in Phase 3, and those aged 65–74 years similarly reduced from 36 to 33 to 26%. By contrast, the proportion of participants aged 75–84 years increased from 20 to 30 to 42%, and the proportion aged 85 years and over increased from 10 to 11 to 14%.\n\nThe number of women in each phase was 121 (77%), 140 (84%) and 160 (78%), respectively. Examination of the balance in responses between the activity groups over time was constrained by some non-responses (see the ‘Limitations’ section). However, for the full response Phase 3, Education/Informative accounted for 32%, Support Group accounted for 20%, with Physical/Exercise, IT/Communications and Social Engagement accounting for 15, 16 and 17%, respectively. Noticeably, activities attendance varied for gender: in Phase 3 men accounted for 36% of IT/Communications, 26% of Social Engagement, 23% of Education/Informative, 14% of Support Group and 10% of Physical/Exercise.\n\nTable 3 sets out the number of responses for each question and highlights the mean scores and standard deviations. All means for variables measured were positive (greater than neutral) indicating positive agreement, satisfaction and improvement for all respective variables. For Phase 1 the highest mean agreement was 4.38 for Question E, whereas the lowest mean agreement was 4.11 for Question A (all ‘agree to strongly agree’). The highest mean satisfaction was 4.37 for Question G, whereas the lowest mean satisfaction was 4.21 for Question F (both ‘satisfied to very satisfied’).\n\nFor Phase 2 the highest mean agreement was 4.47 for Question K, whereas the lowest mean agreement was 4.12 for Question I (all ‘agree to strongly agree’). Phase 2 also established that 92 (56%) respondents attended every session, 63 (38%) attended frequently, seven (4%) attended occasionally and two (1%) attended rarely. In total, 162 (99%) respondents said they would recommend the activity group to family and friends, with only one saying they would not.\n\nFor Phase 3 the highest mean agreement was 4.03 (agree to strongly agree) for Question N, whereas the lowest mean agreement was 3.65 (neutral to agree) for Question O. A mean satisfaction of 4.02 (satisfied to very satisfied) for Question P was observed and highest mean improvement of 4.07 (improved to greatly improved) was observed for Question R, whereas the lowest mean improvement was 3.78 (neutral to improved) for Question Q. Phase 3 established that 92 (48%) respondents attended one or two groups, 70 (37%) attended three or four, 17 (9%) attended five or six, three (2%) attended seven or eight and eight (4%) attended nine or more; with a mean of 3.0. Moreover, 176 (94%) respondents were able to attend all the activity groups that they wanted to, with only 12 (6%) unable.\n\nFor each phase, a MCA was undertaken to segment the profiles into quadrants, with the results for Phases 1–3 shown in Figures 1–3, respectively. Each included the profiles Activity, Age group and Site; with ‘Would you recommend to family & friends?’ included for Phase 2 and ‘Have you attended all groups you wanted to?’ included for Phase 3. As MCA is concerned with relationships amongst (or within) sets of variables, each MCA (as shown in the Figures) indicates those variables which have the strongest relationships/correspondence with one another, separating them into four groups, as represented by the quadrants. The results are as follows for each survey phase.\n\nFor Phase 1, there was multiple correspondence between (i) the activity Education/Informative, the age groups under 65 years and 65–74 years and the Rural site; (ii) the age group 65–74 years, the activity Physical/Exercise and the Ormskirk site; (iii) the activity Support Group, the age group 75–84 years and the Skelmersdale site; and (iv) the activities IT/Communications, Social Engagement and the age group 85+years.\n\nFor Phase 2, there was multiple correspondence between (i) the site Ormskirk, the activities Physical/Exercise, IT/Communications, the age group 65–74 years and ‘Yes’ as a recommendation to family and friends; (ii) the activities IT/Communications, Education/Informative, the age group 75–84 years and ‘Yes’ as a recommendation to family and friends; (iii) the site Skelmersdale, the activity Support Group, the age group under 65 years; and (iv) the activity Social Engagement, the age group 85+years and the Rural site.\n\nFor Phase 3, there was multiple correspondence between (i) the activity Education/Informative and the Ormskirk site; (ii) the activities Physical/Exercise, IT/Communications, the ages groups under 65 years and 65–74 years, and those attending all the groups they wanted to; (iii) those not attending all the groups they wanted to, the age group 85+years and the Rural site; and (iv) the activities Social Engagement, Support Group, IT/Education, the age group 75–84 years and the Skelmersdale site.\n\nTests for differences between means for common variables measured in different phases were undertaken: Questions F and P (Satisfaction with range of activities) and Questions C and I (agreement on activities well organised). For the former, the mean satisfaction was statistically lower (P<0.05) when moving from Phase 1 to Phase 3 (Phase 1 mean=4.21, Phase 3 mean=4.02), even though both means were in the same grouping (between satisfied and very satisfied). For the latter, there was no statistical difference between means of agreement (P>0.05) moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2 (Phase 1 mean=4.14, Phase 2 mean=4.12) and both were in the same grouping (agree to strongly agree).\n\nThe profiles Gender, Site, Activity and Age Group were common to each survey. Tests for differences between means for variables measured for these common profile questions were undertaken. Given the hundreds of comparisons involved, Table 4 summarises only those where a statistical difference was found (P<0.05). Any comparisons not included in Table 4 can be inferred to be not statistically significant (P>0.05); interestingly, there were no statistical differences observed for Age group on means for any variables measured in Phase 1 and Phase 3 surveys and no statistical differences observed for Gender on means for any variables measured in the Phase 3 survey.\n\nPhase 2 demonstrated the largest number of differences between means of variables measured (particularly for age groups, activities and sites). All profiles demonstrated mean differences for ranges of Agreement measures in this phase. In the Phase 3 survey only the Site profile demonstrated difference for the satisfaction and improvement variables measured.\n\nA series of tests were undertaken to observe if correlations existed between the variables measured for each survey phase. This allowed for possible co-relationships between those items measured to be determined. Where significant correlations existed this indicated that an increased agreement in one measure was related to an increased agreement or satisfaction in another measure.\n\nFor Phase 1, all variables were significantly positively correlated (P<0.05) with the exception of Questions A, B and E, where no significant correlations were observed. The largest significant correlation (r=0.527) was for Question C versus Question D and the smallest significant correlation (r=0.167) was for Question A versus Question G.\n\nFor the Phase 2 survey all variables were significantly positively correlated (P<0.05 and P<0.01). The largest significant correlation (r=0.423) was for Question J versus Question K and the smallest significant correlation (r=0.213) was for Question J versus Question L. For all possible co-relationships observed here, increases in agreement for all measures were related to increases in agreement for others.\n\nFor Phase 3, all variables were significantly positively correlated (P<0.05 and P<0.01). The largest significant correlation (r=0.491) was for Question Q versus Question R and the smallest significant correlation (r=0.144) was for Question N versus Question P. For all possible co-relationships observed here, increases in agreement, satisfaction and improvement for all measures were related to increases in agreement, satisfaction improvement in another measure.\n\nImpact of programme\n\nFour Phase 3 questions were designed to establish the potential impact of attending activities on people’s personal situations: health and well-being; social well-being and quality of life; social isolation; and healthy eating. No single causal relationship between the programme and individuals’ situations can be assumed, as the latter is subject to many factors and influences, some beyond their control (eg, death of spouse). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to infer the impact of the programme was positive and contributed to people adopting healthier and more active lifestyles; all means for variables measured were positive (greater than neutral) indicating positive agreement, satisfaction and improvement, respectively, and all variables were significantly positively correlated (P<0.05 and P<0.01). This is consistent with the WHO (2015) policy on active ageing.\n\nThe programme positively helped health and well-being, but it was notable that 38% of people gave a neutral response; which suggests a critical contribution to the maintenance of health and well-being. This concurred with focus groups’ findings, which stressed links between physical activity, mental health and well-being (Bell et al., Reference Bell, Gandy, Barraclough and Roe2014), and is consistent with findings that older adults’ health and well-being improves through physical activity (Angevaren et al., 2008; Yeom et al., Reference Yeom, Keller and Fleury2009; Windle et al., Reference Windle, Hughes, Linck, Russell and Woods2010; Reimers et al., Reference Reimers, Knapp and Reimers2012; Chase, Reference Chase2013; English et al., Reference English, Manns, Tucak and Bernhardt2014), and cognitive decline can decrease by increasing older adults’ leisure and physical activities (Angevaren et al., 2008; Stern and Konno, Reference Stern and Konno2009; Plooij et al., Reference Plooij, Scherder and Eggermont2012). Healthy active ageing encourages good mental well-being (Sprange et al., Reference Sprange, Mountain, Brazier, Cook, Craig, Hind, Walters, Windle, Woods, Keetharuth, Chater and Horner2013) and certain activities decrease levels of depression (Pinniger et al., Reference Pinniger, Brown, Thorsteinsson and McKinley2012). Notably, MCA indicated correspondence with: age group 65–74 years and Physical/Exercise activity in Phase 1; activities Physical/Exercise, IT/Communications, and the age group 65–74 years for Phase 2; and activities Physical/Exercise, IT/Communications, and age groups under 65 years and 65–74 years for Phase 3. This suggests that the two activities arguably most relevant to physical and mental health corresponded with participants aged under 75 years.\n\nSimilarly, there was (strong) agreement that the programme helped social well-being and quality of life, and helped reduce social isolation, which was consistent with the emphasis placed on making and maintaining new friendships and avoiding loneliness by the focus groups (Bell et al., Reference Bell, Gandy, Barraclough and Roe2014). Therefore, the programme addresses the growing concern of social isolation and loneliness (Findlay, Reference Findlay2003; Clough et al., Reference Clough, Manthorpe, Green, Fox, Raymond, Wilson, Raymond, Sumner, Bright and Hay2007) where the impact of the latter on health can be profound, increasing the risk of premature death (McNamee, Reference McNamee2014). Hunter (Reference Hunter2012) suggests that older adults with solid social networks can expect a 50% boost to longevity. MCA showed correspondence with Social Engagement and the 85+years age group in Phases 1 and 2, and the 75–84 years age group in Phase 3. This suggests that the activity most relevant to social well-being corresponded with the oldest participants.\n\nHealthy eating is emphasised nationally for all age groups, let alone older people [eg, eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day (NHS Choices, 2015)] and is politically sensitive because of increasing use of food banks (Loopstra et al., Reference Loopstra, Reeves, Taylor-Robinson, Barr, McKee and Stuckler2015). Generally, AUKL luncheon clubs are always popular and well attended. However, the related survey responses gave the lowest mean value of all questions in all three surveys (3.65), which was largely due to nearly 40% of respondents giving a neutral response to the question. After discussion, AUKL staff and the evaluation team inferred that this is the issue where the programme was likely to have had least impact because most people’s meals will be provided by themselves at home. The socio-economic status of the programme participants was not known, or specifically canvassed, as part of the evaluation; although it was assumed the programme would generally cater for those less well-off. Therefore, it was not known if some participants experienced financial difficulties which impacted on their eating habits. Responses showed site and activity-specific differences for Question O: Skelmersdale had higher agreement than Ormskirk and Rural; and Support Group had higher agreement than Social Engagement, Physical/Exercise and IT/Communications.\n\nLimitations\n\nAll surveys and collected data have limitations which need to be borne in mind when considering the results. This research was reliant on AUKL for activities data without independent verification on its reliability, validity and accuracy; which was acceptable. The data used for the costs analysis covered the most recent year available, although the exact period was not specified. Some queries were raised with AUKL staff about certain attendance numbers, but they gave assurance of their accuracy. No data were available on numbers of people that ‘dropped out’ from the programme. Anecdotally, AUKL thought such numbers were small.\n\nThe ‘number of individuals’ was taken to be the number registered for a given activity (for the year in question). This was a mix of ‘new’ attendees and those attending throughout the programme, however, (in)frequently. The nature of the activity was an influence: some (eg, education courses) were for set time periods, whereas others (eg, lunch clubs) were ongoing. People attending multiple activities counted against each and every activity and site attended; and such people could complete surveys for each activity and site combination attended. This was perfectly acceptable because responses could vary for different combinations. Survey anonymity meant calculating numbers of multiple responses was not possible. To gauge the actual number of individuals participating in the overall programme, responses to the question ‘How many different activity groups have you attended since 2012?’ in the final survey were used to calculate the average number of different activities each client attended. This figure was then divided into the total aggregate number of individuals attending the individual activities.\n\nIt was agreed from the outset that questionnaires must be simple and anonymous, so as to maximise the number and ensure the quality of responses, given the age group involved (see the ‘Reliability and validity’ section). Accordingly, it was not possible to compare individuals across the phases, making any matched pairs analyses impractical. Consequently, there was reliance on self-reported changes in individual status, for the small number of related questions (see Table 3); any external measurement against set criteria was neither feasible nor appropriate. It should be noted that anyone participating in all survey phases may have moved from one age group to another during the overall 21-months involved; but these should be comparatively few given the 10-year age categories used.\n\nDespite AUKL’s best endeavours some groups did not provide data: six groups in Phase 1 (Ormskirk Education/Informative and Support Group; Rural IT/Communications and Physical/Exercise; and Skelmersdale Education/Informative and IT/Communications) and four groups in Phase 2 (Rural IT/Communications, Physical/Exercise and Support Group; Skelmersdale Education/Informative)."
