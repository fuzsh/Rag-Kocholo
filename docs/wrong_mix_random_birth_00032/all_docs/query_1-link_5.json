        "text": "The years draw on when his name shall be counted among the illustrious of the earth. William of Orange is not dead. Cromwell is not dead. Washington lives in the hearts and lives of his countrymen. Lincoln, with his infinite sorrow, lives to teach us and lead us on. And McKinley shall summon all statesmen and all his countrymen to purer living, nobler aims, sweeter faith and immortal blessedness.\n\nWilliam McKinley was one whose name, even if misfortune had not overtaken him, would have gone down to posterity as one of the greatest Presidents of the United States. This is conceded by all, those who opposed him politically as well. He was really the idol of the nation.\n\nMr. McKinley had always been a strong partisan, and yet he had been so gentle in manner, so courteous even to his opponents, and so manly and honorable in his business and social life, that there was no bitterness in any heart toward him. Those who had differed with him in policy cheerfully conceded his uprightness and sincerity. But, above all, there was a sentiment, more evident here than in any other case, that this man was the President of the whole nation; that he was, in some sense, the expression of the purpose and the dignity of every law-abiding man and woman. It was the perfection of the national sentiment; and every citizen felt a personal sense of bereavement. . . .\n\nAs a wise, just, pure-hearted statesman, William McKinley achieved imperishable fame. In the Chief Magistrate the man was never lost. Modest, equable, benign, patient, and magnanimous, he won esteem and inspired love. Of all our Presidents, he was the most popular for his human qualities, and no man could better deserve the regard of his countrymen. Posterity will acclaim him one of the greatest Presidents of our Republic, and in the hearts of Americans McKinley will be enshrined with the lamented Lincoln.\n\n. . . his career speaks to us on behalf of a broader life. It is a call to more religion and more patriotism; more composure and more kindness. Nobody can think quietly of his life as we have been forced to do during these past days without feeling that he teaches us something that we individually need; and that not only on the active side of life, but also on the passive side. How to take trouble; how to stand before the sudden stroke that shatters hopes; how to hold ones self when the fondest dreams are broken. That message has come home to us all from these last days of our beloved Presidents life. And how to die. We have seen how a good man dies; we have seen the strong arm of faith clinging to the cross. Simple, genuine, unfaltering trust in the eternal love of the Father.\n\nNow lift our martyr up\n\nWho hath drained the bitter cup,\n\nWho hath said, Gods will is best;\n\nLet us bear him to his rest,\n\nGive him all the honors due\n\nTo a soldier tried and true,\n\nTo a statesman broad and great,\n\nTo a father of the people and a chieftain of the State.\n\nWhatever objection may be taken to the policy for which he stood, it is everywhere admitted that he has courageously, manfully and honorably worked out his share of it. Moreover, he is a man of a chivalrous nature and kindly disposition, who has made more friends and fewer enemies than most public men in his country.\n\n. . . he has done more injury to the cause and the good name of the great republic than any of the men who preceded him in the presidential office. His very personal virtues have enabled him the more effectively to commit what we consider national crimes. His sweetness and suppleness of disposition have made possible the success of measures which cruelly destroy American ideals and are stamped upon weaker lands with blood and fire. Under his administration the United States has become an unclassable government, a republic-empire, a Janus among nations, wearing two faces.\n\n. . . Mr. McKinley has in this great crisis of his career revealed yet more virtues which endear him to the popular heart. The private, personal excellences of public men are often thrown into the shade by the light of publicity and are not seen or appreciated. But in this case the man, not the President, was put to the test and all the world knows the patience of the illustrious sufferer, his magnanimity, his heroic calm.\n\nPresident McKinley has probably not an enemy in the world. Rivals he has, and of opponents and critics his sharebut personal enemies, no. He is a singularly lovable man. We who oppose many of the policies with which his name is identified, feel that President McKinley has made serious mistakes; but no man questions his personal rectitude, or doubts that he tries to do right. Perhaps to no public man in our history as a nation have good intentions been so generally, and so cheerfully, attributed.\n\n. . . Mr. McKinley is everywhere regarded as a man of moral worth and high intelligence, as a true patriot and an exemplar of honorable citizenship. He has endeared himself to the people of this country by manifestations of goodwill toward all classes of citizens, and it is to be hoped there are few who do not feel deep detestation for the dastardly crime of which he has become the victim.\n\nHe had reached the summit of earthly ambition for an American and was sincerely trying with all his immense ability and unrivaled experience and profoundly patriotic spirit to serve the nation that had called him to administer its affairs. He had succeeded to a degree that gave him rank with Washington and Lincoln among the greatest three of all our Presidents.\n\nIn the long line of Presidents who have held this high office, no one of them was so popular as Mr. McKinley is. There are Presidents in the list, some of whom we look back to with a feeling of reverence for their greatness, or of admiration for their astuteness, or of sincere regard for their courage and independence, but not one of them all, especially during his term of office, has enjoyed so completely the affection of his fellow-countrymen.\n\n. . . every sign points to assured speedy and complete recovery. If the President were younger by twenty years it would be possible for him to be up and around in ten days. As it is his reaction all through the course of the affection has been that of a man much younger than his years. There is, then, really very little danger of sepsis developing and its possibility is held out by the surgeons merely in order not to seem too sure of the distinguished patients recovery, for, after all, stranger things have happened than a turn for the worse in cases that have apparently progressed as favorably as this.\n\nMr. McKinley may not be classed in history as one of the great presidents. He has not been such an imposing personality as George Washington, who was regarded with veneration rather than love. He had not the keen and philosophical intellect of Jefferson, but neither had he the Jeffersonian duplicity. The rude, half-barbaric force of Jackson would be foreign to the last president. In the nature of things President McKinley cannot fill so large a place in history as Lincoln, the war president, with his unique character and singular appropriateness for the work he had to do. But if fortune has not cast the lot of President McKinley amid such memorable events as those which Washington and Lincoln saw, he was not chosen for an altogether unimportant part. In his presidency the United States has entered upon a career of expansion such as Washington or Lincoln never dreamed of, and the republic has for good or evil taken her place among the great powers.\n\nThe remains of such as William McKinley enrich the earth to which they are returned; they make it better to live upon, and enable the survivors to look destiny more confidently in the face through the thought of what one man had been as an example of what other men might strive to emulate.\n\nThe United States, the whole world, could not afford to spare William McKinley for he was a man whose influence reached to every part of the globe. His work not alone elevated the United States through the careful and liberal exemplification of a policy that had for its object the greatest good to his fellow citizens, but commanded the respect of the nations of Europe where there had been formerly only villification. Those nations later sought his good will and pronounced his praises as a statesman without stint. He had reached the highest pinnacle in the affections of his fellow countrymen and brought the nations of the earth under the influence of his greatness.\n\nHis services will be more and more appreciated as time advances and as men look at his achievements dispassionately; and when the few great names are mentioned of those who are esteemed greatest for what they have done, prominent in the list as a faithful and helpful servant of his country will be the name of William McKinley.\n\nHis mouth betokened the ready speaker, and his gift of speech was, indeed, natures passport to distinction in a country where oratory has such a hold on the popular affection as it has in ours; but his imperfect education deprived his addresses of all grace or literary quality. The one collected volume of his speeches shares the unreadability which even the greatest orators seldom escape.\n\n. . . it is on Mr. McKinleys private life that the American people will dwell most affectionately. They think of him as the kind husband, the loyal friend, the forgiving enemy, the good citizen. No public man in our generation has more closely approached the ideal of the simple, pious, domestic life which we like to think is the foundation of all our power as a nation.\n\nMarvelous is the gift of wisdom and power that enabled this chosen head of a mighty nation to guide the ship of state steadily and safely through the perilous currents of the past four years, and well and nobly was the duty performed, but for nothing in all his long and brilliant career will the memory of William McKinley be cherished with more genuine affection than for his tender, chivalrous devotion to his invalid wife.\n\nStainless amid all the temptations of public life, without blot under the fierce light which has beat upon him in these recent years, with a devotion to his wife as dignified and touching as anything in the annals of chivalry, President McKinley, in the first place of the Nation, stood for the noblest qualities of the men of the English-speaking race. He had the purity of Washington and the sweetness of Lincoln; and in the supreme hour his dignity and strength sustained at the highest levels the tradition of personal character which has never departed from the White House.\n\nPresident McKinley crowned a life of largest love for his fellow-men, of most earnest endeavor for their welfare, by a death of Christian fortitude; and both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which, in the supreme hour of trial, he met his death, will remain forever a precious heritage of our people.\n\nHe had nothing of the Napoleon or the Bismarck in him, happily both for himself and for the people whose elected chief he was. For in the constitutional ruler of a free people the qualities that mainly distinguished these two eminent men would have been altogether out of place. In all his instincts and habits of mind he was an American to the hearts core, with that happy combination of useful qualities which has enabled most of the American Presidents to rise to the height of their great responsibilities.\n\n. . . in his very last words, as his grand spirit hovered over the brink of eternity, he bequeathed a legacy of faith in God and of submission to the Almighty Ruler of all men and of all nations, that will go ringing down the vestibule of the future, and may yet be the keynote of Americas salvation and of the Republics glory in centuries yet to come.\n\nPresident McKinley was a good officer of the government and carried out the policy of his party with fidelity and intelligence, and at the same time moderately. So far as the representative of a party with distinct principles can be, he was the President of the whole people. That he entered upon some projects and courses that a large part of the people disapproved was the fault of his party rather than of the man. Personally he was above reproach, and his tender affection for his wife and his blameless life endeared him to the people as a man, whatever they thought of his political actions.\n\nI have known him not only as a statesman, but I have known him, through the public press and otherwise, as a citizen, a man of irreproachable character, a loving husband, a grand man in every aspect that you could conceive of, and his death has been the saddest blow to me that has occurred in many years.\n\nPresident McKinley I loved and revered as the highest type of American citizenship we have as yet had presented to us. It is with a glad heart I look into the future and know that in years to come there will be no more illustrious name in American history than that of William McKinley.\n\n. . . there was that about the man that disarmed personal hostility, and seemed to make almost every one who came to have personal relations with him, his friend. He was full of good will to men, was exceedingly amiable, and had great charm of manner. The sweetness of temper, the buoyancy of his spirit, his patience, his courtesy, his tact, his ready gift of pleasant speech made him beloved in a way that no President has been beloved since Lincoln. It was those qualities, largely, that made him so remarkably successful in his dealings with Congress; that made warm personal friends of thousands of his political opponents and critics, and stirred such a wail of grief and lamentation over his death. Whether he will rank among the greatest of Americans we must leave it to history to determine. That he will rank high among the best beloved of Americans there is no question.\n\nIt has always been my pride that in the American home is laid the foundation for that love of liberty and fair play; of giving to each his just due, which are traits of American character and which have nowhere in public station found fuller, freer or better expression than in the life and services of William McKinley, an American of Americans.\n\nLike some of the knights of ancient tradition, his character seemed to bear a charmed existence. Through all the vicissitudes, trials and allurements of an environment which we may well believe expose all the weak points of any character, his emerged without taint or blemish. Every experience through which he passed seemed only to broaden, chasten and purify it.\n\nThe crucial test of his character came in his cruel and apparently useless sacrifice. Calmly, bravely, nobly, he met his fate, prepared by his long years of faithful devotion to his ideas of right. He did not flinch when put to the test, and in such a calm and holy faith he sealed the influence of his life to the upbuilding of a sorrow-stricken nation.\n\nWe all rejoice in the example of Christian manhood manifested in the life of our dead President, and especially in the simple, impressive and peaceful manner of his death.\n\nNo better and more valued legacy could have been left the people of this nation than that. Its influence will not soon pass away.\n\nHaving lived a life that was blameless, full of love and reverence for his family, and peace, law and order,a life of energy, earnestness, study and application, worthy of emulation by the wisest, and an inspiration to the youths of this country, it is difficult to understand what excuse the most rabid Anarchist or even Nihilist can make for so dastardly a deed.\n\nIn private and domestic life he was such a man as we could wish all our public men to be, in simplicity, loyalty, purity. These virtues were universally granted to be his, but his noble behavior in his last hours, so full of bravery, consideration for others, and resignation to the Power which disposes of all human affairs, has raised him into a character of heroic mould in the memory of a great nation.\n\nIt is fortunate for the rising generation that in McKinley there were all the elements that make a Man rather than simply those elements which make a Hero. He was every inch a Man! Wise as a statesman, prudent as an executive, strong in council and valiant in political conflicts, he was yet everywhere, and at all times, the gentlemanly gentleman, the manly man, and it is this which has drawn all the world unto him.\n\nUnlike any of his predecessors, and unlike great men generally, he had won by moral worth, political sagacity, and his power to fathom the will of the people. In the hearts of the people he had secured an affectionate regard never before accorded a chief magistrate during his lifetime. This man of lofty patriotism, large and clear administrative ability, with boundless love for the weakest and humblest American citizen, had a sublime Christian character which will shine in the hearts of all lovers of truth and liberty with a luster which shall grow as the years of the Republic increase.\n\nHe made the flag respected where it had been lightly esteemed. He conducted the nation through a foreign war that reflected honor upon it. He met questions arising out of that war without flinching. He found the United States a second and left it a first-class power. That is his best monument. He broke our fetters of national isolation, and taking the manumitted Columbia by the hand led her into the charmed circle of world powers.\n\nWhatever enemies Mr. McKinley may have had, partisan hatred, envy, and cavil ceased at the bedside of the stricken man. Both the North and the South, Republicans and Democrats, see in him the representative of the nation, and all unite in their admiration of his courageous behavior in the hour of trial and in the face of death.\n\nThe halo of martyrdom now surrounds his head, and history will gladly and fully recognise the merits of his administration. His memory will be kept sacred by the side of his predecessors Abraham Lincoln and James A. Garfield.\n\nThen again there was the honesty of the man. His purity of character none can seriously question, while his sense of honor was as keen as that of any knight of old. He despised the low arts of the politician. No one could live long in Washington without realizing who was the real master of the White House. And in an age so largely given over to ideals quite the reverse of those his long and industrious career bore witness to, well may we laud his integrity, his singleness of purpose, his unexampled disinterestedness and self-abnegation.\n\nA man whose life, in the widest range of condition and service, was simple, consistent, sincere. No mans life was ever more fully revealed, or showed more honorably in the full revelation. No life more perfectly fulfilled the duties of those relations which bind us in homes, in neighborhoods, in wider communities. His life was sound and pure in all that gives stability and honor to states.\n\nIn public and in private life he lived without reproach. As a constitutional ruler he will take a high place. A great man in many ways, he had risen from a humble positionschoolmaster, soldier, lawyerto be the head of a great nation. Deservedly popular and respected and growing daily in the esteem of his people, the last days of his life told of a man even greater than his record. In his words of pleading for his murderer, his brave patient endurance, and his resignation to the Divine will, he breathed the spirit of his Master, whom he loved and sought to serve.\n\nIt has been inevitably said that William McKinley was not great as Washington and Lincoln, or even as some others between and after, were great. But it would be irrelevant to emphasise the inevitable. The important point is that if he was less memorable as a man he was not less memorable as President. Fundamentally sound in ability and character and full of homely excellence, he was as completely the apt representative figure of his own epoch as were even the founder and the saviour of the Republic of theirs.\n\nThat a man born among the lowly can climb to the highest peak that ambition offers to the aspiring, and at the same time never commit any act that lays him open to condemnation, never sully the highest ideal of manhood, never go beyond the limits of the Christian religion, all the time living a life open to the whole people, shows that success does not depend on sharp practice nor high position nor underhanded efforts.\n\nMr. McKinley had some admirable qualities, and no man would withhold from him the praise that is due to his memory. But to place him on a line with the noblest and greatest men of all time, is a gross offense against truth and common sense. He was by no means faultless as a public man, and his administration, we believe, was full of dangerous mistakes. While himself a man of good intentions, he was dominated by his party, and his party was dominated by the worst influences in American politics. Again and again he avowed the most intense convictions on grave questions, and then yielded them to party pressure.\n\nHe has inspired nobler ideals in public and private life, and thus has left a shining example that has stirred the pride and awakened the emulation of the youth of the land. Their scalding tears have fallen upon his mangled body, but their hearts still cherish the glory that was hisa glory they will seek by noble living to make their own.\n\nMcKinley was an opportunist; a very capable man, a very practical man, with instincts that led him to side with the rich and powerful few, rather than with the poor and oppressed masses. Hence he easily persuaded himself that a strong centralized government in the hands of a few strong and capable rulers was better for all concerned than any attempt at self-government by the poor, the ignorant, the incapable.\n\nMake every allowance for the ambition which every public man feels for success and fame and popularity; make every allowance for the selfish motive that enters into every act even when it is good, and yet there remains in President McKinley the instinctive, inherent impulse to do good for its own sake, to serve his country, to better the condition of its people, to help those who labor, to lighten toil, to promote human happiness.\n\nIf any one could know what it is to have a wife sick, complaining, always an invalid for twenty-five years, seldom a day well, he knows, and yet never a word of unkindness has ever passed his lips. He is just the same tender, thoughtful, kind gentleman I knew when first he came and sought my hand.\n\n. . . the manner of his death should awaken in the breasts of our people a keen anxiety for the country, and at the same time a resolute purpose not to be driven by any calamity from the path of strong, orderly, popular liberty which as a nation we have thus far safely trod.\n\n. . . it may be said that while as a man of genius or of culture William McKinley was probably not above the average American chief magistrate, in one particular he was eminent if not pre-eminent, and that is in the possession of TACT. As was said of Louis the Fourteenth of France, often called the Grand Monarch, namely, that while he was not a great statesman; not a great captain; not a great philosopher nor great man in any sense, he was in pre-eminent degree a great KING. He understood kingcraft as few kings had ever done.\n\nIn like manner it can truthfully be said of McKinley: He was not a great warrior; not a great statesman; not a great philosopher or great MAN in any sense, but he was, in one respect at least, a great PRESIDENT. He understood PRESIDENT-CRAFT. He understood how to prevent party strife, how to head off the factional spirit that so often disrupts and defeats political parties in the hour of victory.\n\nNo man ever broadened out more than William McKinley after he reached the Presidency, and if he had no other record to leave as a legacy to the country than his spontaneous addresses delivered during his journey to the Pacific coast, and his grandest of all deliverances at the Pan-American Exposition the day before he fell by the bullet of the assassin, he would stand out in American history as among the most lustrous of our statesmen.\n\nMy associations with him during the years of executive life gave me further opportunity to appreciate as I never had before, the great reserve force which he possessed. He seems to have met every emergency, and the unusual problems and annoying complications of the times, in a masterful way. These conditions furnished the opportunity for him to demonstrate his enormous talent and ability for successfully solving every problem, rising to the full measure of every situation, and overcoming all obstacles.\n\nI was somewhat disgusted to hear many of those who condemned Mr. McKinley in most emphatic and savage terms when alive eulogize him to a state of godhood when dead. The fact is, he was neither a devil when alive nor a god when dead, but only a man trying to do his duty as he saw itfailing, no doubt, as we all do to live up to his highest ideals, but nevertheless struggling to do the right as he perceived it.\n\nOur lamented President showed a Christ-like spirit when he said of the vile wretch that fired the fatal shot: May God forgive him. And he showed a deep and abiding sense of the sanctity of law when in the agony of a mortal wound ho remonstrated against any acts of personal violence toward his assailant. If there were no other reason for cherishing the memory of President McKinley it ought to be handed down in high esteem to coming generations because of his dying plea for the sanctity of law.\n\nNo president except Lincoln has had to face more difficult problems involving the unity of the people and the prosperity of the country than did William McKinley. Yet since the days of Washington no president had fewer personal enemies. There is an entire lack of bitterness toward the late head of the nation; for his beautiful character there is an admiration not limited by the artificial boundary of class or party. Behind McKinley the president stood McKinley the man. In all his public life, whether as soldier, lawyer or statesman, whether as a representative, governor or president, he was an exemplary citizen. There was not a time when he could not look the world in the face and say, these hands are clean.\n\nHe was as good and kind as he was great and wise. His gracious and considerate course drew to him the hearts of his countrymen of all parties and every section. He had not an enemy in the world. Oh, irony of Fate, that such a man should be singled out for slaughter!\n\nThere is no use guarding me or any one. A desperado may take my life, any life, in a moment, if willing to pay his life as the price. I cannot give attention to self-protection. If I did it would be vain; recent examples show this. I am not disposed to change my ways, and indeed do not think there is reason to do so. I must take the chances of my duties.\n\nFew presidents enjoyed the affection of the people more than did Mr. McKinley in his lifetime, but the passage of time will increase that respect; while the revelation of his Christian character made during his last hours will cause him to be reverenced as perhaps no other president has ever been.\n\nMcKinley was no bloody tyrant. He was a tool. Moreover, he was the representative of the majority in this country. It was for the interest of capital to bamboozle that majority into accepting him as their representative; but the fact remains that the great mass of the people of the United States regarded McKinley as their representative and they supported the atrocious acts of his administration.\n\nNo President from the birth of this Republic to the present hour ever grew more rapidly in the hearts and affections of the American people than did William McKinley, and when he was lying, hovering between life and death, the prayers that ascended to the Throne of Grace for his recovery from every section of this Republic were as countless as the leaves of a forest.\n\nMr. McKinley . . . may be said to have ended the line of the familiar school of American presidents. His physical appearance was of that character for which the people are accustomed to look in the selection of their presidents. His manner and his speech were modeled after the presidential type. And yet he bore some resemblance to Augustus Caesar. Like the latter, Mr. McKinley was a dissembler; he was plausible; he was crafty.\n\nThere is not one of us but feels prouder of his native land because the august figure of Washington presided over its beginnings; no one but vows it a tenderer love because Lincoln poured out his blood for it; no one but must feel his devotion for his country renewed and kindled when he remembers how McKinley loved, revered, and served it, showed in his life how a citizen should live, and in his last hour taught us how a gentleman could die.\n\nHe died at an hour that was friendly to his fame. A foreign war had ended in the triumph of the American arms. The Republic of the West had at last assumed its place among the greatest nations of the earth. Political bitterness had spent itself in the electoral contest of the preceding year, and there had succeeded a lull which brought with it good will and tolerance. Extraordinary material prosperity had enriched the nation, so that men might at some future day look back upon those years as to a Golden Age. And finally, the tragic ending of a useful, honourable life stirred all the chords of human sympathy, and seemed to cast upon that life itself the pathos and the splendour of a consecration.\n\nHe had achieved the most exalted station of political power in this government, the loftiest eminence, the very keystone of the tallest arch of American honor that ever sprung from the basic foundations of our Constitution. Other men before him had occupied that high position, had risen, reigned, and fallen. Other men had reached those towering heights and returned again to the walks of private life, to pass their days in peace among their families and friends. But not so with him. He came down no more. The departure of this spirit from this proudest pinnacle of earthly honor and power to realms yet higher still may be likened to the eagles flight, as standing upon the peak of some splintered crag, lifted above the storm-swept summit of some lonely mountain height, he plumes his pinions in the sun, unfurls his mighty wings, then boldly launching upwards to the sky, he cleaves his gallant way beyond the clouds of earth.\n\n. . . McKinley as a President in his private and domestic life was a living lesson to all Christian civilization. His daily walk and conversation was a living lesson constantly exemplifying the real strength of the national characterthe purity of individual conscience, the strength of personal will, the reverence of Divine power. As a President of eighty millions of free people he measured up to the most exalted standard for him who fills that office. He loved and served all sections and all classes, and was an exemplar worthy of all imitation. He lived and died a manly man.\n\nThe theory that Mr. McKinley subordinated his judgment to the will of Senator Hanna, or of anybody else, is a delusion. He was always the master. He had the gentle persistency of Lincoln. I was with him night and day and I know that he was always the master. No will controlled him but his own.\n\nWilliam McKinley had a soul who loved to see women grow and progress and mount to the highest part of civilization; he would protect their honor and virtue with his life; his was a spiritual soul, working for the benefit of his fellow men and women, but alas, he had to be cut off from this noble life in which he was an example to our nation.\n\nHe had neither the austere mastery of men of Washington, the constructive genius of Hamilton, the philosophic breadth of Jefferson, the brilliant magnetism of Clay, nor the profound reasoning of Webster. His nearest analogue is Lincoln. Like Lincoln, he had the genius of common sense, that instinctive sense of and regard for the just relation of things to each other; like Lincoln, he had profound sympathy with the inmost thoughts, the deepest feelings, the loftiest aspirations of the American people; like Lincoln, he had the gift of grasping the fundamental principles underlying a controversy and interpreting them to the masses in convincing phrases. Above all, like Lincoln, he had that greatest of all dynamic powers, a great, loving, sympathetic heart.\n\nYou have been told that he did not possess the matchless eloquence of a Webster, the deep learning of a Sumner, and the unique power of a Lincoln, but that he was an all-round, symmetrical man with his faculties completely under his power; a born leader; a clean gentleman, so that after he became president he grew and developed himself and has exhibited a power in his actions that no one could foresee at the time of his election.\n\nPresident McKinley was the most beloved of our Presidents. Beyond any of them he possessed the affection of the whole American people. Parties and partisanship had ceased to have any enmity toward him personally. He was not only the best friend of the workingman and the wage-earner who ever filled the place of ruler of a great country, but they all knew it and so regarded him.\n\nA son, loving, thoughtful, obedient, he secured the blessings of a happy mother and the blessing of Almighty God. A husband, devoted, faithful, pure, tender, and watchful as the stars, he exalted the American home. A soldier, brave, vigilant, prompt, he performed every duty with alacrity and courage. A scholar, thoughtful, industrious, he was practical, mastering the departments of knowledge involved in his pursuits. A leader in Congress, he illumined every subject he discussed with the fullness and accuracy of his information and secured the attention and retained the confidence of his colleagues by the clearness of his statements and the candor of his convictions. An exalted politician, he harmonized his party, conciliated his rivals, pacified his opponents, and justified his measures by their success. A Christian, he illustrated the saving power of grace, and retained the favor of God. A man, he represented the typical American on the Mount of Transfiguration. He has gone into history, to be catalogued with Washington and Lincoln and Grant, and to be loved and honored forever.\n\nI had the closest revelations of William McKinleys character, I think, in our quiet hours of smoking and chatting when all the rest had retired. For past midnight we have sat many times talking over those matters which friends always discussand the closer I came to the man, the more lovable his character appeared. There was revealed the gentle growing greatness of the man who knew men, respected them and loved them. These pleasant episodes of a purely personal nature are emphasized more and more as I think of him, and it is these that I most cherish in the memory of the man. His greatness as a statesman was but the reflection of his greatness as a man.\n\nHe bore his illness and such pain as he suffered with beautiful, unflinching and Christian fortitude, and no more tractable or agreeable patient was ever in charge of his physicians. No harsh word of complaint against his assassin was ever heard to pass his lips. As the days went by, the peculiarity of his Christian character became ever more apparent, and was particularly noticeable at the last, up to the very moment of his lapsing into unconsciousness. Up to this time I had hardly ever believed that a man could be a good Christian and a good politician. His many public acts showed him to be the latter, while the evidences of his real Christian spirit were most impressive during his last days. His treatment of Mrs. McKinley during the many trying experiences which he had with her fortified a gentleness in his manly character, while the few remarks or expressions which escaped from him during his last hours stamped him as essentially a Christian in the highest and most lovable degree."
