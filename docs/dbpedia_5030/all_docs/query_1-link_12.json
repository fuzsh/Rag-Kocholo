In September 2011 SBB Cargo International was created, with head quarters in Olten. This subsidiary hires locomotives from SBB Cargo, for international freight trains.\n\nIn 2019 SBB produced 19.7 billion passenger-km with 1.3 million passengers a day, 5.8% more than in 2018. SBB Cargo produced 16.4 billion tonne-km, 3.5% less than in 2018. In 2020 35% of SBB Cargo was sold to Swiss Combi AG (Planzer, Camion Transport, Galliker and Bertschi).\n\nIn Covin-19 year 2020 passenger numbers dropped from 1.3 million to 843,000 per day, SBB producing 11.7 billion passenger-km (down 40% from 19.7 billion).

The former SGA is partly rack, and some of the latest EMUs are intended for operation throughout the system. Since the bankrupcy of MThB, AB also manages the FW railway. In 2019 AB transported 5.21 million passengers, 5.6% more than in 2018 (when St. Gallen-Teufen was temporarily closed).\n\nIn 2006 four regional railways - including the old Appenzeller Bahnen - merged into the \"new\" Appenzeller Bahnen.\n\nThe Rorschach-Heiden-Bergbahn operates a short rack-and-adhesion line running into the hills above Rorschach, with through running over the SBB line to Rorschach Hafen.\n\nThe Bergbahn Rheineck-Walzenhausen was rebuilt from a tramway and a connecting funicular to a rack-and-adhesion railway in 1958. They just have 1 item of motive power.\n\nThe Trogenerbahn (10km, 1000V=) is a light railway/interurban tram line that provides a link between St. Gallen(SBB and AB station) to Trogen.\n\nSince 2006 Appenzellerbahnen is a member of RAILplus AG, a company set up by a number of private railways to coordinate marketing, maintenance, etc. In 2008 passenger traffic amounted 6.3 million passengers (6.1 million in 2007) and 55 million passenger-km.\n\nIn 2018 AB saw major changes. A new tunnel allows the rack section near St. Gallen to be abandoned. The Trogenerbahn is now connected to the SGA line, allowing through adhesion-only tram-trains Trogen-St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell. The overhead voltage on TB was increased from 1000V= to 1500V= apart from the city section in St. Gallen (600V=).\n\nAlso for the Gossau-Appenzell-Wasserauen line new trainsets were delivered by Stadler. Two older rack-fitted trainsets are still used on Gais-Altstätten Stadt. This line is intended to close in 2035 and to be replaced by busses.\n\nIn January 2021 AB merged with the Frauenfeld-Wil bahn. This line is not connected to the other AB lines. The FW brand will still be used in the future.\n\nFW operates trains between Frauenfeld (SBB/CFF/FFS station) and Wil (SBB/CFF/FFS and Thurbo station). The FW ends on the station square in Frauenfeld. It transports around 1.32 million passengers per year.\n\nIn 2022 passenger numbers grew by 17% to 6.15 million passengers. This is still 5% less than in 2019, pre-Covid.\n\nWebsite: http://www.appenzellerbahnen.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nAB locomotives and trainsets\n\nRHB locomotives and trainsets\n\nRhW motor cars\n\nFW trainsets\n\nASm - Aare-Seeland Mobil\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (1994):\n\n59km narrow gauge(1000mm), electrified at 1200V=\n\nASm is the new name for the former cooperation of 3 railways, called OSST (Oberaargau-Solothurn-Seeland Transport). The company consists of the former Biel-Täuffelen-Ins-Bahn(BTI), Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn(SNB) and Regionalverkehr Oberaargau(RVO), completed by bus operator OAK. The company operates two separate railways: Biel-Ins and Solothurn-Niederbipp-Langenthal-St. Urban - Melchnau (in 2015 St. Urban Ziegelei-Melchnau was broken up). One standard gauge shunter was aquired for service in Niederbipp.\n\nWork to extend the Solothurn-Niederbipp line from Niederbipp to Oensingen was completed in 2012 and opened on 9 december that year.\n\nIn 2004 ASm transported 4.4 million passengers, 1% more than in 2003. Since 2006 this company is a member of RAILplus AG, a company set up by a number of private railways to coordinate marketing, maintenance, etc.\n\nWebsite: http://www.aare-seeland-mobil.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nASm locomotives and trainsets\n\nAVA - Aargau Verkehr AG\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2018):\n\n2.1km standard gauge, not electrified (BDWM)\n\n19km narrow gauge(1000mm), electrified at 1200V= (BDWM)\n\n32km narrow gauge(1000mm), electrified at 750V= (WSB)\n\nIn 2018 the former Wynental- und Suhrentalbahn (operated under the AAR bus + bahn brand) and the BDWM merged into Aargau Verkehr.\n\nWSB operates trains on two connected lines starting from the AVA station in Aarau, alongside the SBB/CFF/FFS station: from Aarau to Schöftland and from Aarau to Menziken-Burg. A few years ago the WSB line was relaid on the former SBB grade from Reinach Unterdorf to Menziken-Burg, replacing street running on this section. In November 2010 the section Suhr-Aarau was moved to the former SBB standard gauge line connecting these cities, replacing much more street running.\n\nThe standard gauge network of BDWM is a short branch line of WM, from Wohlen to Meisterschwanden. Passenger service from Wohlen to Meisterschwanden has been cancelled since May 1997. Passengers are moved by bus. In 1999 Villmergen-Meisterschwanden was lifted, such that of the WM only the (unelectrified) part Wohlen-Villmergen is left for freight. The remaining freight trains are operated by SBB Cargo.\n\nThe narrow gauge part of this company consist of a light railway with mostly roadside running between Dietikon and Wohlen. The part Bremgarten-Wohlen used to be mixed gauge until 2015, to allow standard gauge freight trains to reach Bremgarten. BDWM leases this railway from SBB since 1912.\n\nCurrently BDWM runs two passenger trains per hour on Wohlen-Bremgarten-Dietikon, with two additional trains Bremgarten West-Bremgarten-Dietikon during the day on weekdays.\n\nSince 2022 AVA also operates the new Limmattalbahn in Zùrich with 8 new Tramlink trams from Stadler, the same as the new trains for the Waldenburgbahn (BLT).\n\nWebsite: http://www.aargauverkehr.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nWSB locomotives and trainsets\n\nBDWM locomotives and trainsets\n\nBLS - BLS AG (former BLS Lötschbergbahn and Regionalverkehr Mittelland)\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2008):\n\n436km standard gauge, electrified at 15kV 16.7Hz\n\nIn 1997 the \"old\" BLS, the Bern-Neuenburg-Bahn(BN), the Gürbetal-Bern-Schwarzenburg-Bahn (GBS) and the Simmentalbahn (SEZ) merged to form the \"new\" BLS Lötschbergbahn. The BLS has the largest standard gauge network of the Swiss Private Railways. The Lötschberg Pass forms part of the Berne to Milan main line, which has extensive joint operation with the SBB/CFF/FFS. The company also operates frequent commuter trains from and to Berne.\n\nIn June 2001 BLS Cargo AG was founded, a daughter company of BLS especially focused on freight traffic. In 2017 45% of BLS Cargo was sold to SNCF Logistics (France).\n\nSince 2004 SBB operates all long-distance services over the BLS main line, while BLS has taken over all Bern S-Bahn services and local/RegionalExpress trains on Bern-Neuchatel, Bern-Langnau-Luzern, Spiez-Zwiesimmen and Spiez-Kandersteg-Brig.\n\nRegionalverkehr Mittelland was formed in 1997 out of the EBT(Emmenthal-Burgdorf-Thun-Bahn), SMB(Solothurn-Münster-Bahn) and VHB(Vereinigte Huttwil-Bahnen). The new company operated an extensive standard gauge network east of Bern. Although one branch has closed, much of the fleet was modernised during recent years.\n\nIn 2006 the \"old\" BLS merged with Regionalverkehr Mittelland (RM) to form BLS AG. This new BLS (note: this is not an abbreviation anymore) operates trains from the railway centers Bern, Thun and Burgdorf to the stations Luzern, Huttwil, Langenthal, Solothurn, Moutier, Biel/Bienne, Neuchâtel, Payerne, Fribourg, Zweisimmen, Brig and Interlaken. Also BLS AG operates the entire S-Bahn network of Bern. From December 2025 BLS will operate the new hourly IR56 service Basel-Delémont-Biel, with 7 extra \"MIKA\" trainsets class RABe 528.1.\n\nIn 2019 passenger traffic grew by 2.5% to 67.7 million passengers (including busses and ships). The number of freight trains operated was much more than in 2018, as Crossrail Benelux is now included: 22,265 in 2019 versus 17,051 in 2018.\n\nCrossrail - a Belgian private freight railway operating in Belgium and Germany - was bought by BLS Cargo in 2019.\n\nWebsites: http://www.bls.ch/ and http://www.blscargo.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nBLS Passenger locomotives and trainsets\n\nBLS Cargo locomotives and shunters\n\nBLS departmental locomotives and shunters\n\nBLS historic locomotives and trainsets\n\nBLS/RM withdrawn classes\n\nBLT - Baselland Transport\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2021):\n\n65km narrow gauge(1000mm), electrified at 600V=\n\n13km narrow gauge(1000mm), electrified at 1500V= (Waldenburgerbahn)\n\nBLT company operates light trains on Rodersdorf-Basel-Aesch/Dornach (lines 10, 11 and 17), partly running over city tram tracks. It also owns the line to Pratteln (line 14, operated by BVB). The company was founded in 1974 by a merger of BTB(Birsigtalbahn), BEB(Birseckbahn), BÜB(Basler Uberland Bahn) and TBA(Trambahn Basel-Aesch).\n\nIn 2019 55.1 million passengers travelled with BLT. Traffic by tram grew by 0.6%.\n\nSince 2015 BLT runs the management of the Waldenburgerbahn, operating as BLT line 19. Between April 2021 and December 2022 the Waldenburgerbahn has been completely modernised and regauged from 750mm to 1000mm gauge, the same as the other BLT tracks. New trams/trains were ordered and the 750mm gauge motor cars and trailers were withdrawn.\n\nWebsite: http://www.blt.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nBLT trams\n\nBRB - Brienz-Rothorn-Bahn\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2006):\n\n7.6km narrow gauge(800mm), not electrified\n\nThis company operates on one of the few non-electrified lines in Switzerland.

They operate trains on Morges-Apples-Bière/l'Isle-Mont-la-Ville. In 1997 a new 2km branch line to an army base was opened. Tanks on standard gauge cars are the most important freight traffic on the line.\n\nIn 2003 the name of the company was officially changed into MBC (Transports de la région Morges-Bière-Cossonay), the railway operations used to be known as BAM until then. In 2008 some 620,000 passengers travelled with BAM, and 42,000 tonnes of freight were transported.\n\nWebsite: http://www.mbc.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nMBC locomotives and motor cars\n\nMG - Ferrovia Monte Generoso SA\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (1994):\n\n9km narrow gauge(800mm), electrified at 800V=\n\nThis is the only rack mountain line south of the Gotthard pass. It was electrified as late as 1982, DMUs were scrapped or sold but the diesel locomotives were kept.

Until 1982 through trains over the Furka Pass could only run during the summer. Now there is a long tunnel, and the old tracks are operated by the 'Dampfbahn Furka Bergstrecke (DFB)' with amongst others steam locomotives once sold to Vietnam.\n\nThe line runs from Disentis/Mustèr to Brig, with a branch line from Andermatt to the SBB/CFF/FFS station in Göschenen. Several stretches of rack remain on this very scenic line. In 1999 a 2.2km branch line (with rack) was opened from Sedrun to Las Rueras, to remove spoil from the new Gotthard base tunnel. In the mean time this has been removed again after opening of the tunnel.\n\nThe BVZ line provides the transport link to Zermatt to which public road traffic is not permitted. Hence, in addition to the main service from Brig, there is a frequent shuttle service Täsch(car parking)-Zermatt.\n\nThe MGB has a common management with GGB that runs rack trains from Zermatt up into the mountains. BVZ Holding AG owns 75% of the company.\n\nSince 2006 this company is a member of RAILplus AG, a company set up by a number of private railways to coordinate marketing, maintenance, etc.\n\nIn 2023 8.68 million passengers travelled with MGB, 2.4% more than in 2022.

There are also branch lines to Einsiedeln and Wädenswil.\n\nThe BT (Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn) formed the eastern section of the Luzern to Romanshorn route. They also operated between Wil and Nesslau.\n\nAt the end of 2001 the BT and SOB merged, to form the \"new\" SOB. In its first year (2002) the new SOB transported 10.127 million passengers, up by 2.8% on the combined BT and \"old\" SOB numbers. Freight traffic fell by 8%.\n\nIn 2022 27.2 million passengers travelled with SOB, two-third of this on long-distance services (2019: 13.7 million without the services over SBB lines).\n\nThe \"Voralpen-Express\" Luzern-Romanshorn used to be operated by SOB and SBB together, since December 2013 SOB operates it on its own.

The combined section to Zürich Central Station used to have two overhead wire systems, the DC one was located on one side. So the DC-only EMUs had off-centre pantographs!\n\nFrom April 2022 the Uetliberg line was converted from 1200V DC to 15kV AC. New (dual voltage) trainsets were ordered to be used during and after the conversion. The older DC motor cars were withdrawn.\n\nIn 2023 25.14 million passengers travelled with SZU, of which 9.2 million on the Sihltalbahn (S4, +17.5%) and 4.8 million on the Uetlibergbahn (S10, +22%).

The former MO operates a standard gauge light railway serving an area to the south of the Rhône Valley, between Martigny and Orsières/Le Châble. Trains run as \"Saint-Bernard Express\". TMR and SBB cooperate as Regionalps, that operates all regional standard gauge passenger services in Valais/Wallis province. In 2021 new trainsets were ordered from Stadler to replace both the SBB Domino trainsets and MVR Nina trainsets.\n\nThe former MC operates a partly rack line that has stretches of overhead wire and stretches of 3rd rail. The connecting SNCF line in France also has 3rd rail. Through operation from Martigny to St. Gervais(F) is now possible with the new EMUs class BDeh4/8 (MC, 2x) and Z 800 (SNCF, 3x).

Since January 2000 they have merged into the TPC. These companies operate trains in the region around Aigle, south of Lake Geneva and close to the French Border. The AL runs from Aigle to Leysin-Grand-Hôtel and is mainly rack operated. The AOMC operates trains on two sections: Monthey-Aigle and Monthey-Champéry. Only the latter has three rack sections. The ASD operates trains between Aigle and Les Diablerets, with changing direction in Le Sépey. This line has no rack sections. The BVB operates trains on Villars-Bex and Villars-Col de Brétaye, with rack between Bévieux and Gryon, and between Villars and Col-de-Bretaye.\n\nThe AL and ASD connect to the SBB/CFF/FFS in Aigle, the AOMC in Aigle and in St. Triphon and Monthey (stations within walking distance). The BVB connects to the SBB/CFF/FFS in Bex. In 2007 TPC carried 2.1 million passengers, producing 14.5 million passeger-km.\n\nIn 2008, after opening of the new narrow-gauge platforms in Aigle and the new depot, it was decided to change the voltage on the AOMC line from 900 to 1500V DC and change the rack type from Strub to Abt. This has finally taken place during the summer of 2016.

This new company now operates narrow gauge trains on Luzern-Interlaken Ost, with a branch from Hergiswil to Engelberg (the former LSE). Both the main line and the branch have rack sections. A new line to Engelberg opened in December 2010, it reduces the gradients from 25% to 10.5% such that standard and longer trains can be used.\n\nIn 2019 10.3 million passengers travelled with ZB producing 190.8 million passenger-km, 1.5% more than in 2018. Most popular is the Luzern-Interlaken Express service.\n\nOn 1 January 2021 ZB has taken over the Meiringen-Innertkirchen Bahn from KWO. This line used to be a construction railway for the hydro-electric power plant. Later the line was opened to the public and operated by battery cars. In 1977 it was electrified and second-hand cars were bought from OEG in Mannheim(D).\n\nIn the future the former MIB line (5km, 1200V DC) might be adapted to allow through trains from Interlaken Ost to the Aareschlucht and Innertkirchen. There is already a physical connection between the ZB and MIB lines at Meiringen but the overhead voltage is different and platform lenghts do not match. Another new development might be the Grimseltunnel which would connect Innertkirchen with Oberwald (on the MGB Andermatt-Brig line).\n\nWebsites: http://www.zentralbahn.ch/ and https://www.grimselwelt.ch/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nLast update: 07-05-2024"
