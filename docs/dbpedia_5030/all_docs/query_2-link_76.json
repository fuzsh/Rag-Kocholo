        "text": "BARI\n\nThe city of Bari, a place that flies under the average tourist’s radar, is much more than a capital city of the gorgeous Puglia region, or just a departure port for ferries crossing the Adriatic. I first thought I would visit Bari for a few hours, then want to quickly descend into the rest of Puglia to enjoy the quaint coastal towns and to escape urban hustle. Following an exciting first afternoon exploring Bari, I decided to stay a few additional days to soak it all up. Below are some takeaways from this recent stay.\n\nJust The Right Size For Walking\n\nBari is a lovely medium-sized city (approx 300k); large enough to support excellent culinary and cultural options (including Teatro Petruzzelli, an ornate Theater-Opera house!), but also small and flat enough you can do it all on foot. The city sits directly on the Adriatic Sea, and is so pedestrian friendly they have even preserved and converted their ancient fortress/sea wall into the easily accessible pedestrian walkway, Via Venezia. This elevated pedestrian path allows you to encircle the old town while also looking out at the sea. You will find locals walking here and enjoying the dolce vita at all hours, but especially in the evenings where even on the most random weeknight, you will find thriving local life enjoying their gorgeous city.\n\nMemorable Food\n\nWe know Italy has some of the best food around. This is true in Puglia and well-on-display throughout Bari. If you’re really interested in Italian pasta, you may have heard about the famous Pasta Grannies. Bari has a bunch of these internationally celebrated women who spend their days opening up their homes, setting out tables, and allowing pedestrians to sample and purchase freshly formed pasta like the famous Apuglian ear-shaped orecchiette.\n\nThere are several other special foods found easily directly from these street vendors: Fried polenta (sgagliozza), warm Barisian foccacia bread with cherry tomatoes, crispy rolled taralli bread, or deep-fried panzerotti (similar to a calzone), and others.\n\nClassic Coffee & Pastry Bars\n\nSomething I love to do when visiting any new town is to figure out a list of all the best coffee shops. Sometimes that can look like sitting down with a colorful mug of 3rd Wave filtered coffee, delivered by hipsters in over-sized sweatshirts. But in Italy, I prefer to go where the old-timers go: an classic cafe or pastry shop. Bari is no exception to the Italian cafe stereotype you may be imagining, and you can easily discover these atmospheric cafe counters, where sharply-dressed baristas efficiently serve a line of locals, standing confidently with an espresso cup in hand. You have little choice but to join in on the tradition and leave your comfort zone behind.\n\nMy favorite spot in Bari is Pasticceria Rex dal 1960 with a close second going to Boccia Pasticceria (both pictured below).\n\nLocal Street Culture\n\nI touched on in the city’s walkability, but something you pick up on as you cross town multiple times are some unique aspects of a city’s street culture. In Bari, the city isn’t yet taken over by tourism. There are still old Italian families living on the small streets of the ancient city’s interior. And those people live out on the streets in a way I haven’t often seen in a capital city. You will see families extending their living rooms out onto the city streets. They use mops to clean the gorgeous stone streets, placing out dining and card tables, leaving children’s toys out, and of course decorating the walls outside their front doors with personal and local items such as flowering cactus leaves, religious figures, ribbons, and balloons.\n\nHistory\n\nAs a port city on the Adriatic sea, Bari has a long history, touched by many cultures, but mainly that of old Greek and Roman rule. Bari is currently home to the giant 11th-century Basilica di San Nicola, a key pilgrimage site, that still holds the remains of St. Nicholas. The old town is full of reminders of the past, all on open public display: from incredibly narrow streets, to countless ancient chapels and unmarked hefty columns preserved in place after old roofs and walls proved less sturdy. Also, you can find reused stone relics from these lost walls, like a carving of Mother Mary placed randomly on its side to construct a back alley stairwell. Even a section of ancient Roman road sits unearthed. So many opportunities to reach out and touch history.\n\nLocation Location Location\n\nPuglia may seem a little isolated when you look at the map, but don’t let that discourage you. Located southeast from most of Italy’s major tourist spots, it could be considered a trek when compared to other accessible tourist zones throughout Italy. But, if you are coming from Rome, there are frequent fast trains to Bari, and in just 4 relaxing hours (I suggest reserving the quiet train car), you will walk out into another world that is Puglia, and the zany crowds of Rome will quickly fade into memory. Bari and Brindisi also host small airports if you’re hoping to Puglia from another city in Europe, but I came directly by train from Florence and found the trip enjoyable. I suggest using Bari as a base for exploring the smaller coastal and mountain towns of Pulgia. Day trip-worthy hot-spots include Monopoli, Polignano a Mare, Alberobello, Ostuni, Lecce, and Matera.\n\nWhen to Visit Puglia\n\nI found a way to make this wonderful place even better: visit in October. After two weeks of exploration around Italy by train this October, I don’t think I will ever return in any another season. Olives are starting to drop from the trees, weather is ideal, and it’s noticeably less crowded. Unless you’re a fan of sweating through multiple shirts a day or are searching for holiday markets, just trust me on this one and book your next trip in October.\n\nI spent a summer studying in Italy as a college student, and I recall the pleasure — and also the absolute need— for mid-day naps. This wonderful Italian tradition serves as a cool escape from the intimidating strength of the southern summer sunshine. While naps are fun, sunny days that don’t absolutely destroy your energy levels are infinitely better when you actually want to explore all that Italy has to offer. I would gladly trade long, scorching summer days for 70 degree comfort. This is what I found all over Italy in October, but especially in the southern area of Puglia, where the beaches were still gorgeous and warm, but didn’t make me want to nap under the shade of the nearest beach cave.\n\nWhen a global pandemic descended after spending months perfecting the itinerary for an epic honeymoon to Portugal, I at first reacted badly. I walked around Brooklyn (masked, of course) avoiding everyone, not only to do my part and reduce the risk of coronavirus spread, but to also hide my grief. It quickly became obvious that if I was to leave New York City this year, it was going to be on a road trip to somewhere safe.\n\nI grew up in a rural Vermont/New Hampshire border village, so my mind often wanders north when I think of a stress-free city escape. And with a pandemic putting absolutely everyone on edge, time in the woods sounded like the perfect plan.\n\nVermont responded brilliantly to the COVID-19 virus: They shut down non-essential businesses and the community acted quickly while respecting new public health initiatives. Out-of-state visitors were prohibited without a 14-day quarantine, which was fairly strict compared with other rural American states with low coronavirus numbers. While I did not wish to bring disease with me from NYC, I knew I could travel there safely by car and quarantine at my parents’ house until I could take a nasal swab test. The trip was a huge success and the highlights are featured below by regions visited.\n\nThe Northeast Kingdom\n\nThe Northeast Kingdom, a romantic name for Vermont’s northeastern corner, is a region known for its sparse population, gorgeous hiking trails and remote lakes, as well as the sense that you’ve successfully escaped modern times and returned to a New England you thought was long gone.\n\nSt. Johnsbury, VT\n\nThe Northeast Kingdom hides one of nature’s greatest creations, Lake Willoughby. Carved out by a giant glacier, the narrow and deep lake stays cold and fresh all year long. You will be rendered speechless as you visit beaches on the north or south end of the lake and gaze out at the water’s serenity and exciting charms of the cliff faces of Mount Pisgah and Mount Hor looming overhead. You might get lucky and hear the warble of the local loons that regularly nest on this remote lake. If hiking is your thing, Mount Pisgah has a gorgeous hike that takes you past ponds, boulders, rock faces, and unforgettable overlooks.\n\nThe Upper Valley\n\nStraddling the Connecticut River, The Upper Valley of New Hampshire and Vermont offer well-preserved historic villages, plus a bit more hustle-bustle compared to the Northeast Kingdom up the road. Best known as the home of Dartmouth College, Queechee Gorge, or the renowned King Arthur Baking Company. This region deserves at least a day of your time as you bop around Hanover, NH, Norwich, VT and Woodstock, VT.\n\nHanover, NH\n\nAfter you spend some time admiring the campus buildings surrounding the Dartmouth College Green (and possibly visiting the Baker Library’s stunning Orozco Room murals), you may need a special place to grab coffee or food. Lou’s Restaurant & Bakery is both an ultimate comfort food destination and an essential Dartmouth institution. If you want less American diner and more Irish pub vibes, then head over to Murphy’s On The Green for excellent bar food.\n\nCollege towns often have ample coffee shops and Hanover is no exception. Stop into Dirt Cowboy Cafe for a hot cup of their specialty brew sourced from around the globe. My favorite is the Ethiopian Harrar. Umpleby’s Bakery Cafe is newer to the Hanover scene, but is already a favorite due to it’s quality sandwiches, pastry, caffeinated drinks and bright, ample seating areas.\n\nWoodstock / Queechee, VT\n\nTwenty minutes down the road, the neighboring towns of Woodstock and Quechee (pronounced “kwee-chee”) mix natural beauty and historic splendor. Driving over Quechee Gorge might make you feel a twinge of vertigo as you glance into the surprisingly deep valley cut through dense forest, with a moody river far below. If you’re curious about such things, park in one of the lots at the end of the bridge and view the gorge more closely via the bridge edge or by carefully walking the path down through the forest.\n\nAs you head west on Route 4, you’ll want to stop at Simon Pearce. This old mill was converted into a glass blowing studio, retail shop, and high-end restaurant over the course of the past 40 years by a skilled artisan from Ireland. Even if hand-blown glass isn’t your thing, it’s a wonderful place to stop just to walk around the mill building and feel the power of the raging river beside you.\n\nA popular destination for tourists, the historic town of Woodstock is small but extremely charming. It feels as though you are walking into a 19th Century movie set of the perfect New England town. Stroll across the Woodstock Covered Bridge and stop into the Cafe into the Mon Vert Cafe for a treat.\n\nNorwich, VT\n\nA visit to the Upper Valley is not complete unless you stop in Norwich to visit both their famous general store, Dan & Whit's, and the quaint Norwich Inn next door. The pub behind Norwich Inn, Jasper Murdock's Alehouse, is small but provides a warm atmosphere. I like stopping in for a drink at the bar where you feel not as much in an inn, but in a historic local pub.\n\nThe White Mountains\n\nA stay in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom puts you conveniently alongside the gorgeous, protected White Mountain region across the river in New Hampshire. The gateway to this highland region is a town called Littleton, with a bustling downtown full of adorable shops, antiques, breweries, and a trusty diner.\n\nLittleton, NH\n\nMere steps from Schilling, you can pick up more sweetness than you can handle, at either the Doughnut Cellar or the long candy counter at Chutters candy store. With your treats in hand, stroll across the river through the Riverwalk Covered Bridge then meander along the banks of the Ammonoosuc where you will certainly find your zen.\n\nFranconia / Sugar Hill / Lincoln, NH\n\nJust a few minutes down the road from Littleton, you will find the heart of the White Mountains. The bucolic town of Sugar Hill hides away an insider cult favorite breakfast stop, Polly’s Pancake Parlor. This pancake parlor is huge, allowing you to look over the nearby mountains while you try a fun variety of pancakes and waffles, with of course local maple syrup and spreads on the side.\n\nThe Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe is worth a stay if you have a little extra cash, but if not, you can always drop on by anyway to view the impressive gardens or to taste local Austrian-inspired beer and snacks at the von Trapp Brewery & Bierhall. I find that just visiting the lodge with it’s dark chalet-style architecture, makes me want to watch Sound of Music and spend more time getting to know this fascinating musical family that has thrived in Vermont since the 1940s.\n\nSince local beer and food are both clearly a focus when I travel through Vermont, I discovered in Downtown Stowe an excellent brewery called Idyltime Brewing Company that has created a large outdoor garden for distanced drinking.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts, my favorite hike in Stowe is The Stowe Pinnacle Trail. This popular hike takes a couple hours and has some steep moments, but the rewarding views at the top make it well worth the effort.\n\nFine dining may not come to mind when you think of Vermont, but in a state with such quality comfort food and drink, you will indeed find a few elevated dining options, like Hen of the Wood-Waterbury. This is the place you might go for an anniversary dinner or when you might want to pop the question to your significant other. Their food is so consistently good, you may get caught up in the meal and forget to take photos of your special moment.\n\nIf you’re in Vermont in summer, Creemees (soft serve ice cream) will be on every local’s mind and tongue. The very best can be found at Canteen Creemee Company in Waitsfield or Palmer Lane Maple in Jericho.\n\nBurlington\n\nVermont’s Queen City, Burlington is one place I return to every year. In the One Day In Burlington article I wrote last year, I covered my favorite Burlington spots, but this summer I discovered a few more:\n\nAs you already know, Vermont is well known for being both beautiful and green, so naturally visitors and locals alike spend a lot of time outdoors. If you’re a lover of gardening, visit the ginormous Gardener's Supply Company in Williston and start envisioning a back-to-nature kind of life you could lead in Vermont. The garden center can work to whet your appetites, but hitting some unpaved trails will really allow you to appreciate the nature of Vermont. I researched deeply and decided to go on three rejuvenating hikes and one epic bike ride:\n\nA bucolic walk throughout the farmland estate and coastline of Shelburne Farms\n\nA rewarding vista from the top of Mt. Philo State Park in Charlotte\n\nA bike ride along Lake Champlain up the Island Line Trail using rented bikes from Local Motion Bike Rentals in Burlington\n\nA woods to lake trail at Niquette Bay State Park in Colchester that featured several Pileated Woodpeckers\n\nAfter a rewarding day in nature, explore the hip Winooski food and drink scene! I enjoyed a wonderful walk around the Winooski River and then devoured lobster rolls at Waterworks Food & Drink. Finally, find the energy for an after-dinner drink at one of WInooski’s hip cocktail bars, Misery Loves Co. or Mule Bar.\n\nAs is true after every trip to Vermont, I returned to the big city both completely rested and reinvigorated. I promise that if you try some of the above advice, that you, too, will find yourself re-energized and ready to fight a novel coronavirus and other pressing injustices of our modern world.\n\nIf you’re determined to eat at excellent local restaurants during your travels, then you probably do a lot of research and make dinner reservations well in advance. I did not always plan ahead for my meals abroad, but after an unfortunate Saturday evening spent searching the streets of rainy Paris for what felt like hours, I decided it would be the last time.\n\nIf I’m new to a city or visiting on a Thursday through Saturday, I travel with a long list of highly-regarded restaurants and a few dinner reservations made in advance. Sometimes I cancel my reservations depending on how the day turns out (you can’t tie me down!), but more often than not, my research and reservations save the day! It also gives me something to confidently anticipate throughout the day.\n\nMexico City is so famous for its food that I put a lot more time than usual into restaurant research. I consulted friends, articles, and blogs. I looked at hundreds of photos on Google Maps, Facebook, and Instagram pages. Below is the list of restaurants that excited me most.\n\nWhere We Actually Had Dinner\n\nFonda Fina: Medellín 79, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico\n\nFonda Fina provided an ideal first meal the evening we arrived in CDMX. The menu had many classic Mexican dishes and really excelled at lively sauces and fresh ingredients. The restaurant had a warm, intimate feeling and the wait staff were very attentive. I recommend trying one of their fruity cocktails.\n\nPujol: Tennyson 133, Polanco, Polanco IV Secc, Miguel Hidalgo, 11550 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico\n\nWe had to try the infamous Pujol. We understood it was expensive, even for us New Yorkers. However, we budgeted for it and went in with a very open mind. It turns out, you will certainly need an open mind during your visit to Pujol. The menus add several surprises and are guaranteed to introduce you to foods you have never encountered. Think sea urchin, algae, and ant larvae. I am certainly not very adventurous but sometimes it’s fun to just dive in and surrender to new and exotic foods as you leave your old self behind!\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts, with an impressive history as a lasting academic center in United States higher education, has long attracted intellectuals and artists from around the world. As English America’s first planned village, founded in 1630, and home to America’s oldest University (Harvard), the area deserves a visit for anyone interested in American history or fantastic bookstores (shout-out to Harvard Bookstore!).\n\nFortunately, Harvard Square, the area of Cambridge that surrounds Harvard University, has an appeal that far surpasses a typical college town. After living within the bounty of New York City for several years, I still think fondly of the 6 years I lived in Cambridge. Balancing both its fascinating history and now, a quality food scene, Harvard Square is an enriching place to spend a few days.\n\nNew York City offers just about everything in the area of baked goods. Finding the perfect spot for a sweet, bready treat should not be a hard task, but there are a many mediocre places to sift through before finding the true gems.\n\nThis list below names not only my favorite shops that produce their own baked goods, but also places that have one or two specialty treats that I deem go above and beyond the competition.\n\nBourke Street Bakery - Ginger Brûlée Tart\n\nThis bakery is a relatively new competitor to the NYC scene. However, back in Sydney, Australia, the quality of Bourke Street is well known. Located just north of Madison Square Park, between Flatiron and Koreatown, this bakery is central, as well as spacious. I was surprised to see how much quality seating they provide for the bakery visit when you absolutely cannot wait another minute to eat your treats.\n\n15 E 28th St, New York, NY 10016\n\nBreads Bakery - Babka\n\nBreads sure did its best to turn me off at first. Located next to Union Square and The New School, every visit was annoyingly crowded with students and made me wonder what the appeal was all about. Then, thankfully, I was pointed in the direction of their chocolate babka. I stopped by one morning before the students were awake, and ate some of the best babka in existence. Now I get it. And thankfully, they’ve opened a few additional locations.\n\n18 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003\n\nThe Hungarian Pastry Shop - Napoleon Pastry\n\nThis shop makes my top 10 list for so many reasons: 1) Nerdy Columbia students who sit here wishing they were studying abroad in Europe. 2) Producers of desserts you don’t find in most other bakeries. 3) Old-school service with white takeaway boxes and red string. 4) Located across the street from the massive Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. And finally, 5) a baked creation called a Napoleon pastry. Beige in color, you might not understand the appeal of this mille-feuille creation at first, but once you get a bite of the frosted, crunchy layers with an overflowing custard middle, you will begin planning more weekend excursions to Morningside Heights.\n\n1030 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10025\n\nSwitzerland has a lot going for it: centrally located in Europe, compact in size, gorgeous, connected by an infamously reliable train network, and did I mention gorgeous?!\n\nKnown best for the massive alpine range, The Alps, covering 65% of its land, Switzerland draws mountain sport enthusiasts from around the world to its many resort towns. This impressive geologic feature has helped the country maintain a long history of tourism, and due to the multi-lingual residents (4 official languages!), it is always easy to connect with locals to ask questions. But what may be lesser-known about Switzerland, is the beauty within its cities and towns.\n\nOf course you probably know of Zurich, Geneva, Lucerne, Basel, and Bern, which are already an impressive number of famous cities for such a small country, but the list gets longer when you think outside the box and consider towns like Lugano, Lausanne, Montrieux and Neuchatel. But for this article, let me make a case for one town that isn’t yet on many must-see lists: Fribourg.\n\nFull disclosure: I spent a year abroad living in Fribourg, Switzerland, so I am partial. I was lucky to get to know Fribourg and many other Swiss towns, and for reasons unknown, Fribourg does not draw a tourist crowd. For you, this could mean an opportunity to explore a Swiss town not spoiled by crowds, where you’ll have a chance to get closer to local cultures and foods-- with zero lines!\n\nLet me explain my top reasons for proposing you add Fribourg as a stop on your next Swiss adventure:\n\nCentral and Accessible\n\nFribourg is a stop on most express train lines travelling through Switzerland’s plateau, between Geneva and Zurich. This means that if you’re visiting Switzerland and board a train at either major airport, there’s already a train waiting that will bring you to Fribourg in just a few stops. Fribourg is also quite centrally located in the country, just 20 miles from the capital city of Bern.\n\nPreserved Medieval Town\n\nFribourg is easily accessible, but more importantly, it is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Switzerland. Situated on a sharp turn in the swift river Sarine, Fribourg was built at this enviable location not to create the gorgeous and compact peninsula town we see today, but because it could be easily defensible. This unique geographic position results in dramatic viewpoints that often include river, bridge, village, and cliff all in a single point of your camera.\n\nWalkability\n\nAs you would in any new place, you will want to attempt to walk as much of Fribourg as possible. This way you can stop to admire the historic tavern signs, the hand-forged door bell pulls, decorative shutters, and leaded glass windows. Much of this is precious (and instagramable) detail is in the old lower city, near the river.\n\nIf you dare, attempt walking some of the steep wooden and stone stairways shortcuts scattered all over town; the best being Escaliers du Collège, Stalden, and Escalier du Court-Chemin.\n\nThe highlights on your visit can be seen all by taking a walking tour that brings you from the train station in the upper town, down toward the old town peninsula. This path will first bring you past the adorable shopping district on the Rue de Lausanne to the imposing gothic Cathedral St-Nicolas (started in 1283). Near the cathedral, be sure to walk down the narrow Rue des Epouses to spot the historic signs overhead. Continue past the cathedral towards the tip of the peninsula. You’ll notice streets become narrow and wonderfully steep.\n\nAt the tip of the peninsula, you’ll find two bridges that are huge highlights of the town, the Pont de Berne and the Pont du Milieu, the former a wooden bridge built in 1653 and the later, a stone archway. Both provide dramatic views of both river and town. Keep an eye out for the benches alongside the river, underneath the Pont du Milieu. Don’t be jealous now, but this is where I used to eat lunch in high school!\n\nIf you’re less excited about walking all the way back up to the train station after this, you can hop on the Fribourg Funicular, that, for just a few coins, will take you (slowly) back up the walls of the old city to the upper town. Or, if you’re up for more exploration, take the Chemin de Lorette up above the city walls to the adorable Chapelle de la Lorette for fantastic views down upon the town, and to spot some local cows along the path!\n\nVillars Chocolate\n\nEveryone knows the Swiss produce quality chocolate, but Fribourg is home to one of the best chocolatiers in the country. The locally produced Villars Maitre Chocolatier has a perfect Fribourg cafe to visit to both learn more about the company, sample chocolate, and buy a few gifts for your loved ones at home.\n\nSwiss French and German Cultures Combine\n\nFribourg is a canton (a Swiss state) that cuts through the border of the German and French speaking regions of the country. This results in a unique bilingual capital city. While it is a majority French-speaking, tourists can enjoy the convergence of the two languages and cultures. Even the Cathedral represents a mix of both sides, it was begun by German architects in 1283 and finished by French-speaking citizens in 1490.\n\nI found the relationship between the French and German-speaking Fribourgeois to be fascinating, as the high school I attended in Fribourg was split in two sections by language. I recall an epic high school drama between a girl in my French-speaking class falling in love with a German-speaking boy. The cultural and linguistic differences can be such that this situation was presented to me a major issue!\n\nMore Affordable than other Swiss Towns\n\nIf you’re like most visitors to Switzerland, you’ll feel your wallet groaning as you begin to book hotels and train passes. Consider using a central town like Fribourg as a home base for a few nights instead of Bern, since you’ll find charming hotels in Fribourg at half the cost and it’s only a 20 minute train ride away from the center of Bern, and under an hour from Lausanne or Gruyères Castle!\n\nWhether you crave a basic hamburger or a burger crafted from prime dry-aged beef and Brooklyn Brine pickles, you will be able to find several top-quality options in New York City.\n\nBurgers have been my dinner of choice for as long as I can remember, even growing up with a vegetarian mother (sorry, mom)! When I discovered how delicious they could be served medium rare or with the delightful texture of a lightly-toasted potato bun, my obsession grew.\n\nThere are several excellent options in NYC, so please don’t default to that burger chain because you assume they know what they’re doing; like with most things, the very best can be hard to find, but it’s worth going for. The good news is you don’t need to spend big bucks to be served an amazing burger in New York. Below, I organize the best burgers into 3 price levels, from the high end special occasion burger to the everyday burger.\n\nTHE HIGH END BURGER (>$20)\n\nThese burgers may be expensive, but they are worth every penny. And the below restaurants are phenomenal culinary establishments in their own right, no matter what you order.\n\nBreslin, $29\n\nThe first time you bite into the Chargrilled Lamb Burger at Breslin, a tear will probably come to your eye. It’s truly a phenomenal experience. And if you’re weirded out by lamb, you are not alone. I was nervous my first time back in 2010, until that first bite, when I realized I would never be the same. This burger is the most expensive on my list, but for a meal that makes you cry, you should go for it and save money somewhere else in your day.\n\nTHE MIDDLE RANGE BURGER ($15 to $20)\n\nBuying a mid-range burger doesn’t mean it’s middle-of-the-road in flavor! The burgers below will all keep you dreaming of a return visit.\n\nHenry Public, $16 to $19\n\nHenry Public is an essential Brooklyn experience. You walk in and feel like you’ve stepped into an 1890’s tavern. You won’t find people on cell phones, instead you may find an eclectic mix of locals having actual conversations over a beer or classic cocktails. And they serve up just a few food items, but they have perfected each offering.\n\nHenry Public: 329 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201\n\nBernie’s, $17\n\nWilliamsburg can be an anxiety-producing neighborhood to eat out in. It attracts a lot of tourists (something Brooklyn was not always used to!) and there are several bars and restaurants to choose from. Bernie’s flies slightly under the radar, and feels like a hometown place, stuck in the middle of this expensive hipster a paradise. People look happy and relaxed, and the food is to die for.\n\nBernie’s: 332 Driggs Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11222\n\nThe Double Windsor, $15\n\nThis beer and burger pub in South Park Slope, Brooklyn serves up excellent food from a window in the back. Just order a fine craft beer from the bar, then wander to the food window and ask for a burger. This place is always busy, in an otherwise chill part of Brooklyn, for a very good reason.\n\nThe Double Windsor: 210 Prospect Park West, Brooklyn, NY 11215\n\nTHE AFFORDABLE BURGER (<$15)\n\nI couldn’t ignore the less expensive, but still delicious options that exist around NYC. These compare in quality and price to a Shake Shack or Five Guys burger, but have the local, non-chain vibe that I adore. Hit these up for a quick, anytime meal next time you’re hungry in Manhattan.\n\nCorner Bistro, $11 to $13\n\nCorner Bistro occupies a delightful corner in Manhattan’s well-loved West Village. You would think, if you looked at the prices of restaurants in this area, that anything served here would cost a ton. However, this bistro keeps costs low, yet somehow always comes through with a fun dining experience. Don’t expect a fancy place, food is served on paper plates and fries cost extra. But boy, the people watching from the windows here is worth something in itself.\n\nCorner Bistro: 331 West 4th Street, New York, NY 10014\n\nJG Melon, $12 to $13\n\nJG Melon has been around since the 1970s. Starting on the Upper East Side, this burger-centric establishment is dripping in old-school New York charm. Watermelon paintings crowd the walls. You have to give in to the charms of green and red decor, and to the quality of their burger. They recently opened a restaurant in Greenwich Village that is more spacious than the Upper East Side spot, but I still prefer the original location, if I can manage to get a seat!\n\nJG Melon: 1291 Third Ave, New York, NY 10021\n\nOne can live for years in New York struggling with this simple food dilemma: where to eat before that 7PM Broadway show in Midtown. Now, this issue for me was exacerbated by the fact I am an avid Broadway Lottery player, meaning if I win lottery tickets on any given day, I have very little time to convince my partner to attend a show that same night, pay for the discounted tickets, and then run to the show immediately after work. And as many New Yorkers will tell you, they completely avoid midtown Manhattan, making them totally unaware of tasty food options there.\n\nBars:\n\nJimmy’s Corner: 140 W 44th St, New York, NY 10036\n\nA narrow and packed classic NYC dive bar. You’ll find all ages and types here, and you’ll be squeezing by everyone, so this is not for the claustrophobic.\n\nFlaming Saddles: 793 9th Avenue (between W 52nd/ W 53rd St), New York, NY 10019\n\nThis is an energetic gay bar, popular with all genders and orientations. This is a perfect spot to grab a quick beer and get in the mood for a musical. The bartenders here all wear cowboy boots and dance on the bar à la Coyote Ugly.\n\nPocket Bar: 455 W 48th St, New York, NY 10036\n\nSuper small bar only locals know about with a wonderful owner/bartender. You’ll feel welcome the instant you enter, and they give out free popcorn. Also consider their sister bar Back Pocket one block north."
