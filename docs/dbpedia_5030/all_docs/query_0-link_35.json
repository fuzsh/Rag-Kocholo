        "text": "Country Name\n\nSwitzerland (Suisse/Schweiz/Svizzera)\n\nNational Railway System\n\nNational Railway Operator\n\nSchweizerische Bundesbahnen AG (SBB), Chemins de fer fédéraux suisses SA (CFF) and Ferrovie federali svizzere SA (FFS) are the German, French and Italian renderings of Swiss Federal Railways. The form used on buildings and other fixed installations depends on the language area in which they are situated. At a few locations, notably Biel/Bienne, two languages are used. Most rolling stock carries all three sets of initials.\n\nLanguage\n\nGerman is the main language.\n\nWritten German is almost identical to that found in Germany - one main difference is that the Esszett ('ß') is rarely used, with 'ss' being preferred. Spoken Swiss German however differs considerably from standard German to the extent that many Germans find it hard to understand.\n\nThere is an extensive French-speaking area covering Cantons Genève, Vaud, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, plus the western half of Valais and a small part of Bern. Certain towns to the west of Bern are officially bilingual. They are normally shown in both languages, e.g. Biel/Bienne and Fribourg/Freiburg.\n\nItalian is spoken in Canton Ticino.\n\nThe predominant language in Canton Graubünden is German, but there is a minority language, Romansch. Some place names in this canton are generally given in both German and Romansch, e.g. Disentis/Mustér.\n\nCurrency\n\nSwiss franc\n\nUIC code\n\nnumeric 85; alpha CH\n\nTimetable\n\nJourney Planner\n\nSBB Journey Planner\n\nSwiss transport journey planner\n\nDownloadable Timetable\n\nAll services: oev.info.ch/de (German) tp-info.ch/fr (French) and tp-info.ch/it (Italian). These sites replaced the former fahrplanfelder.ch site in April 2023. The German language URL was amended from öv.info.ch to oev.info.ch in July 2024.\n\nSearches can be made by placename, station or stop name and by table number. All Swiss public transport timetables (SBB/CFF/FFS, other rail operators, tram, bus, Metro, ferry, cable-car, ski lift etc) are available on these sites.\n\nAn archive of previous years' timetables back to 2006 is on the oev.info.ch site here.\n\nDeparture tables for individual SBB stations can be found on the SBB site here. This site can be switched to English, French or Italian.\n\nPrinted Timetable\n\nThe last printed Offizielles Kursbuch/Indicateur officiel/Orario ufficiale was published in 2017. It is still available in downloadable pdf format; see above. However, a private publisher still produced the printed volume see Kursbuch but this has now ceased with the 2024 edition due to lack of demand.\n\nEngineering Information\n\nTemporary timetable amendments: öv-info.ch/de/fahrplan-aktuell/temporaere-fahrplanaenderungen\n\nBus Information\n\nThe Journey Planner (above) selects bus services if they provide the best journey.\n\nThe Post Bus website provides comprehensive public transport information.\n\nMaps\n\nPrinted Maps\n\nEisenbahnatlas Schweiz by Schweers + Wall.\n\nEuropean Railway Atlas (All-Europe Edition) by M.G. Ball.\n\nEuropean Railway Atlas (Regional Series - Switzerland) by M.G. Ball.\n\nTrack plans for RhB (ISBN 3-89494-101-4 pub. 1999) were published by Schweers + Wall.\n\nSBB's Schweizer Bahn-Karte, which is widely available, shows all passenger railways, inter-urban bus routes, ferries, cable cars and chair lifts on a 1:301000 relief map of Switzerland.\n\nSchienennetz Schweiz: Ein technisch-historischer Atlas, published by AS Verlag, includes track layout diagrams and gradient profiles for all Swiss railways, as well as a vast amount of other technical and historical data. The third edition was published in 2010 and it is not known if there is a later one.\n\nWeb-based Maps\n\nA zoomable network map (without timetable numbers) is available online the Swiss public transport atlas.\n\nSporenplan has an on-line map giving access to a series of schematic track diagrams.\n\nMap of Switzerland dated May 2022 - on the Railroad Maps site.\n\nDirect download link to SBB map showing if the GA travelcard is valid on a line or not, all lines shown on map [1].\n\nMaps and Plans - Switzerland.\n\nTicketing\n\nFares on some mountain railways are very expensive, though rover tickets, holiday cards, half fare passes and city tickets given free by hotels may give reductions. Discounts may be available for travel on trains early in the morning or late in the afternoon or in low season.\n\nThe Interrail One Country Pass for Switzerland is considerably cheaper than the well-promoted Swiss Travel Pass, although the latter includes bus services, lake shipping services and urban transport in most Swiss cities and large towns. Entry to most Swiss museums is also included in the Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nA downloadable map shows the lines on which Interrail tickets are valid in Switzerland, either free of further charge or at a reduced rate.\n\nAn online validity map shows where Swiss travel passes, including the Day Saver Pass, are valid.\n\nIt is not possible to purchase a ticket on board a train without paying a substantial fine. Tickets must be bought in advance from a machine on the platform, online, or by smartphone. However, the transaction must be completed - including the payment being received by SBB - before the train departs. Some tickets must be date-stamped in a machine on the platform. These rules are enforced rigidly. A few exceptions will be made, for example for travellers changing from an international train who have had no opportunity of buying a ticket.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure Authority\n\nSBB Infrastructure, a division of SBB.\n\nA few lines in Switzerland are owned by DB InfraGO AG, the German national railway infrastructure company (formerly DB Netz).\n\nNetwork Statement\n\nLinks towards the bottom of the Track access page\n\nGauge\n\nThe SBB/CFF/FFS system is standard gauge. Most other railways are either standard gauge or metre gauge, and some have sections of both. Various other gauges are used. The Rhätische Bahn and the Matterhorn-Gotthard Bahn together form an extensive metre gauge system with through workings between the two lines.\n\nA gauge changer at Zweisimmen enables through running of dual gauge stock between the metre gauge MOB and the standard gauge BLS. This is the only such installation in Switzerland.\n\nElectrification\n\nAlmost all standard gauge lines are electrified at 15 kV 16.7 Hz ac with 11 kV 16.7 Hz ac on the RhB/MGB metre-gauge system. Various systems are used by other railways, including low voltage dc. The CFF line from Genève to the frontier at La Plaine (but excluding the tracks to Genève Aéroport) was electrified on 29.09.1956 at 1500 V dc. This was last used on 14.07.2014 and the line reopened on 25.08.2014 electrified at 25 kV 50 Hz ac for through running by SNCF trains. Very few lines are not electrified, the main exceptions being the steam-worked Brienz Rothorn Bahn, the freight-only Sursee – Triengen and Solothurn – Büren an der Aare lines (the latter de-electrified when closed to passengers on 28.05.1994) and the Etzwilen to Singen (DE) heritage line.\n\nWith the electrification of Erzingen (Baden) to Schaffhausen, the only remaining unelectrified section of the Basel to Schaffhausen line within Switzerland is the 2 km between Basel Bad Bf and the border. DB diesel units continue to operate Basel - Singen services including over the electrified Swiss sections either side of Schaffhausen. Electrification of the Basel to Erzingen section (almost all within Germany) is planned for completion in 2027; see this DB press release.\n\nMost tramways operate at 750 V dc.\n\nRule of the road\n\nLeft, except for right hand running as follows:\n\non DB InfraGO lines between Basel Bad Bf and the frontiers towards Weil am Rhein and Grenzach\n\non the DB InfraGO line between Erzingen (Baden), Schaffhausen and Thayngen Grenze\n\non the SNCF Réseau line from Mulhouse between St Louis Grenze/Frontière and Basel SBB / Bâle SNCF\n\nbetween Genève and Annemasse (SNCF) which reduces conflicts at La Praille and Annemasse.\n\non double-track sections of the RBS (Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn) network\n\non the northern (fast) pair of lines between Zürich Altstetten and the flyover adjacent to RB Limattal (Rangierbahnhof/marshalling yard). The southern (slow) lines have left-hand running. The westbound fast line uses the flyover to cross the other three lines so that west of there the lines are paired by direction with left-hand running.\n\nThere is extensive bi-directional signalling, so it is quite usual for trains to run on the right-hand track if this suits operating requirements.\n\nDistances\n\nEisenbahnatlas Schweiz by Schweers + Wall is the most easily available source of distance information.\n\nDetailed distances for most of SBB can be found at Linie mit Betriebspunkten. This is a list of stations and junctions with distances to 3 decimal points. It does not, however, take account of deviations which increase or decrease the distance.\n\nThe Schienennetz Schweiz (see the Printed Maps section) was the definitive publication. However it may not be easily available or up to date.\n\nOther Railways\n\nCantons (local government) have extensive shareholdings in many of these railways. Some railways have amalgamated in recent years or combined their operations. Rolling stock, tickets and publicity may still bear old names in some cases. In many cases other railways operate over SBB lines and vice versa. Funicular railways are not listed.\n\nAare Seeland mobil AG www.asmobil.ch: Biel/Bienne to Ins; Niederbipp to Langenthal and St Urban Ziegelei; Solothurn to Niederbipp: Metre gauge, 1200V dc.

Through services were suspended from 26 February 2023 after further problems were encountered, but resumed, initially with only one train each way, on 11 June 2023, increasing to two train pairs (out of the three scheduled) from 2 July 2023.\n\nA diveunder opened on 12 September 2022 at Bern Wylerfeld, where the lines towards Thun and Olten diverge just short of Bern Wankdorf station. This has permitted the introduction of direct services between Romanshorn, Zürich Flughafen and Interlaken from December 2022, among other service improvements.\n\nA new flyover between Prilly-Malley, west of Lausanne, and Renens VD was brought into use on 4 July 2022. It carries Bern – Lausanne – Genève trains over the tracks used by trains between Lausanne and Yverdon-les-Bains. The line between Lausanne and Renens has also been quadrupled throughout.\n\nThe new Eppenberg Tunnel, between Aarau and Däniken, opened to traffic on 12 October 2020, with full use by main line trains starting on 13 December 2020.\n\nThe first revenue freight train through the 15.4 km Ceneri Base Tunnel, between Bellinzona and Lugano, ran on 4 September 2020. Passenger trains started running with the December 2020 timetable change, including over the new south to west curve from the tunnel to the Locarno line (Biv. Camorino to Biv. Vigana).\n\nThe Léman Express cross-border suburban network serving Genève and Annemasse began regular operation on 16 December 2019, following a formal inauguration on 12 December 2019 of the last section (Lancy-Pont-Rouge - Genève Eaux Vives - Annemasse). In the first step, local trains were introduced over part of the La Praille freight branch, to Lancy-Pont-Rouge, where a new station opened 8 December 2017. From here the line uses the existing freight line to Bachet-de-Pesay, beyond which a new line crosses the river Arve then runs in tunnel most of the way to Annemasse. The new underground line follows the alignment of the closed Eaux Vives branch. For more detail of the Cornavin - Eaux-Vives - Annemasse [CEVA] Project follow link.\n\nOpenings (new lines replacing other lines)\n\nA new approx. 1.4 km section of underground line on the metre-gauge LEB (Lausanne–Echallens–Bercher) line between Lausanne-Chauderon and Union-Prilly was inaugurated on 14 May 2022, with public opening the following day. This replaced the previous route which mainly had on-street running.\n\nFollowing the linking of the Appenzeller and Trogener Bahn lines in St Gallen, a more direct exit route from St Gallen towards Appenzell to the north of the former SBB goods station opened on 25 October 2021, replacing the line to the south, which closed on 17 October. A new tunnel, which replaced the rack-equipped section between St Gallen and Riethüsli, opened on 7 October 2018.\n\nThe new Bözberg Tunnel, between Brugg AG and Frick, was completed in February 2020. It has a larger loading gauge which allows piggyback services with 4-metre high trailers to use this route. Trains towards Brugg started using the tunnel on November 2 2020 and those towards Basel on the 6th when the old tunnel closed\n\nOn the metre-gauge Regionalbahnen Bern-Solothurn line between Bern and Worb-Dorf, a deviation at Boll-Utzigen including a new station was opened on 26 September 2020. The old route and station closed on the 25th\n\nA new station and line came into use at Châtel St Denis on 14 December 2019, enabling TPF trains to run between the Palézieux and Bulle lines without having to reverse.\n\nA new Albulatunnel, on the Rhätische Bahn, opened to service trains on 12 June 2024. (Free shuttle trains through the new tunnel ran during an open day on the 9th.) The old tunnel will be retained (without rails) for maintenance access and safety evacuation.\n\nReopenings after temporary closures\n\nThe TPF branch from Bulle to Broc Fabrique reopened fully on 24 August 2023 after having been regauged from metre to standard gauge, and realigned in a few places. It had closed on 6 April 2021 and was reopened as far as Broc-Village on 11 December 2022. Broc Fabrique station was renamed Broc-Chocolaterie on 10 December 2023. There is no longer any rail access to the chocolate factory itself.\n\nThe former 750mm-gauge line between Liestal and Waldenburg (Waldenburgerbahn) reopened on 11 December 2022 after having been converted to metre-gauge. It had been closed since 6 April 2021. A longer-term aspiration is to link this line up with BLT tram route 14 at Pratteln.\n\nThe TPC-operated Aigle–Sépey–Diablerets (ASD) line reopened on 2 May 2022, having been closed since 30 July 2021 between Exergillod and Les Planches as a result of landslide damage at Les Fontanelles.\n\nIn the \"heritage/museum\" sector:\n\nThe SEHR preservation group reopened the last section of the Etzwilen (CH) to Singen (DE) line, the section in Germany between Rielasingen and Singen, with an inaugural day of service over the full cross-border route on 16 August 2020.\n\nPermanent Closures (not replaced by other lines)\n\nRegular services on the sparsely-served 250 m extension of the Ferrovia Monte Generoso from Capolago-Riva S. Vitale to Capolago Lago (KBS 636) ceased after 29 October 2023. The line however remains available for private charters or special workings.\n\nA new station came into use at Laupen on 5 April 2021. This is east of the old one, resulting in the branch line becoming slightly shorter.\n\nIn the \"heritage/museum\" sector:\n\nClub del San Gottardo ceased operations on the cross-border section of their Mendrisio – Stabio – Malnate (IT) line in 2015 as a result of the start of work on the new Stabio – Arcisate regular passenger line, the tourist service operating from then on exclusively in Swiss territory. After a considerable period of inactivity the Club closed the Mendrisio site from 31 December 2020 to concentrate on their \"Swiss Railpark\" site at Biasca, to where all rolling stock and offices have been transferred. There are no longer any tourist trains on any part of this line.\n\nTemporary closures\n\nThe RBS branch from Worblaufen to Unterzollikofen is closed from start of traffic 15.06.2024 until end of traffic 06.10.2024. This is not due to work on the branch itself but because of single line working in the Bern tunnel reducing overall system capacity.\n\nFollowing a serious freight train derailment which blocked the northern end of the Gotthard Base Tunnel on 10 August 2023, the eastern bore reopened on 23 August but for freight traffic only, while the western bore remains closed. Over 7 km of track and concrete trackbed were damaged and have to be replaced. A very limited passenger service resumed through the eastern bore on 29 September 2023. SBB announced in early November 2023 that full service through the tunnel will not resume until September 2024, but an improved passenger service has run through the eastern bore from Fridays to Sundays from 10 December 2023.\n\nOn June 27 2024 it was announced that normal use of both tunnels would resume on September 2 2024\n\nThe cross-border line between Le Locle-Col-des-Roches and Morteau (FR) will be closed between 4 March and 31 October 2024. Replacement buses will operate.\n\nThe SZU line between Langnau/Gattikon and Sihlwald will be closed to passengers from start of traffic 15.04.2024 until end of traffic 04.12.2024. This is to facilitate the construction of anti-flooding measures in the Sihl Valley including a tunnel designed to take surplus water from the area to Lake Zürich. Some of the overhead wires will be removed during the work. Diesel powered spoil trains will still be running as will the Zürcher Museumsbahn steam trains: see entry CH24/19.\n\nThe TRN line from Travers to Buttes will be closed for engineering work from start of traffic 08.07.2024 until end of traffic 10.11.2024. It will again be closed from start of traffic 15.12.2024 until end of traffic 27.04.2025\n\nThe rack-operated line from Rheineck to Walzenhausen (KBS 858) is to close on 14 December 2024 for work to replace the currently-used 1958-built vehicle with a new automatic rack vehicle. The line is expected to reopen in 2026 and will then be the first fully-automatic driverless rack railway in the world. More details are in this press release from Appenzeller Bahnen (in German).\n\nTRAVYS Chavornay to Orbe is expected to be closed for the entire 2026 timetable period while it is converted to 15000v AC and the curve from the Lausanne direction is built\n\nOther changes\n\nA re-sited station at Le Day, between Lausanne and Vallorbe, opened on 16 May 2022. It has been moved 300 metres nearer Vallorbe, from within the V of the junction for the Le Brassus line to the other side of the junction. This is to allow portion working from Lausanne of trains to Vallorbe and Le Brassus, splitting at Le Day.\n\nFuture Changes\n\nPlanned Closures\n\nClosures expected to go ahead\n\nTimetable changes effective from December 2024 include the hourly IC service between St Gallen and Genève Aéroport via Biel/Bienne being diverted to Lausanne, with connections to and from Genève at Renens. This will result in there being no trains (or a very limited service) via the line between Bussigny and Denges-Echandens.\n\nThe station at Sihlwald on the SZU line from Zürich is proposed to be relocated 300 m north in 2026, thus closing a short section of the line to regular passenger services. The line beyond the new station is still expected to be used by the Sunday steam specials to Sihlbrugg.\n\nThe rack line from Gais to Altstätten Stadt is planned to be closed in 2035 when the existing rolling stock comes up for replacement, following a review in 2019 by Cantons St Gallen and Appenzell-Ausserrhoden.\n\nClosures proposed but not going ahead\n\nThe metre-gauge branch from Le Locle to Les Brenets was to close in December 2023, with the trackbed being converted to a busway for electric buses. However, 'geological problems' encountered in planning the enlargement of the rail tunnels to accommodate buses have led to the closure being deferred until at least 2031, and possibly later than that, or cancelled altogether. As a result of storm damage on 24 July 2023 the line was closed and replaced by buses, but despite fears that it would remain closed, rail services resumed on 1 November 2023.\n\nThe Berner Oberland Bahn was reported to be reviewing the future of the Schynige Platte Bahn, which operates from the end of May until the end of October. It is increasingly difficult to maintain the historic rolling stock, the line is only marginally profitable and there were no reserves for modernisation. However, in June 2019 it was announced that the railway would continue to operate with the existing rolling stock for at least the next 25 years, and in September 2021 a financing package was finally approved by Canton Bern for track and trackbed renewal and refurbishment of the depot at Wilderswil.\n\nThe Porrentruy – Bonfol line had reportedly been threatened with closure owing to the cost of renewing the signalling and providing universal access, although no actual closure plans were published. In late 2023 it was announced that the line will close between late June and early October 2024 for track renewal, so it would appear that the line is now safe from closure.\n\nOpenings\n\nNew lines under construction\n\nTPC (Transports Publics du Chablais) are to construct a short (220 m) curve at Les Planches on their metre-gauge Aigle – Le Sepey – Les Diablerets (ASD) line to allow direct running from Aigle to Les Diablerets, therefore avoiding the reversal at Le Sepey. Opening is planned for 2025; after opening, alternate trains will run via the new curve or via Le Sepey.\n\nA new 7.7 km-long standard-gauge tramway is under construction between Lausanne-Flon and Croix-du-Péage, north of Bussigny. The first stage of 4.6 km is due to open in mid-2026. It will run to the north of the Lausanne to Renens railway line along the main road between Lausanne and Renens (Rue de Genève and Rue de Lausanne). The second stage of 3.1 km turns north and runs towards Villars-Sainte-Croix and is due to open at the end of 2027. Loops at either end will not be required as double-ended trams have been ordered.\n\nAlternative lines under construction\n\nThe Rhätische Bahn have received approval for a deviaton between Fideris and Küblis. The deviation will be around 1660 metres of which 1400 will be in tunnel. Its purpose is to eliminate curves to increase linespeed from 45 km/h to 90 km/h. Work is scheduled to start in 2027 with the line opening in 2032. Fideris station will be relocated as part of the work and the line distance will be reduced by approximately 160m\n\nA new low-level part of Bern station is under construction. This will replace platforms 21-24 which serve the RBS lines via Worblaufen to Worb Dorf and Solothurn. A new line will diverge from the existing line 1.324km south of Bern Felsenau station and lead to the new station, which will have two island platforms and four platform faces. The new line and station are expected to open in mid-2029.\n\nA double-track tunnel of 2130 m is under construction as part of a 3.3 km deviation to replace the single-line section between [La Neuveville], Chavanne and Twann, on the line between Neuchâtel and Biel/Bienne. This is the last single-track section on the entire route between Lausanne and Olten. The halt at Ligerz on the current line will close without replacement. The new line was due to open in December 2026 but opening has been postponed until 2029 because of protests and appeals, and new environmental protection requirements.\n\nThe ASm narrow gauge line from St Urban to St Urban Ziegelei will close in 2030. A new line, about 250m long, will be built from St Urban to near the town's Abbey to replace it. [ https://tinyurl.com/bdtb3sa6 ]\n\nOn 26.02.2024 the Swiss Government approved finacing for the completion of the second Lötschberg Base Tunnel. To save money km 14.65 to km 35.22 was built with only one tunnel completed. It is aimed to have full double track operation by 2035\n\nThe Matterhorn-Gotthard Bahn is planning a major deviation between Täsch and Zermatt. It will start at km 38.90 (Täsch Station is 38.37) and end at 43.46 (Zermatt 43.98) The project will elminate a rack section and halve the journey time between Täsch and Zermatt. It will include the 4144 metre Mattertal Tunnel, the middle 1358 metres will be double track. Available documentation suggests the overall distance will not change. Work is due to start in 2028 with the new line opening in December 2035. A detailed pdf on the project is at https://gemeinde.zermatt.ch/pdf/projekt/2024-03-25_Praesentation_Mattertal_Tunnel.pdf\n\nNew or alternative lines planned\n\nThe TRAVYS operated Chavornay – Orbe branch is to be converted from 750 V DC to 15 kV AC and the current station forecourt platform and level crossing at Chavornay replaced by a new alignment from 1.3 km north. Work was intended to commence in summer 2021 for completion in 2023, but legal action from the local authority demanding an underpass instead of a bridge to cross the main road delayed the process. After they lost their final appeal on March 5th 2024 work started in June 2024 for opening with the December 2026 timetable change\n\nA 3.336 km diversion of the Romont to Bulle line is planned, in order to remove a number of sharp curves and level crossings. This is currently expected to open in December 2028\n\nIt is planned to divert the Lugano-Ponte Tresa line of Ferrovie Luganesi via a direct tunnel between Lugano and Bioggio, with the present route via Capella-Agnuzzo closing. This could be completed by 2029.\n\nThe Transports Publics du Chablais (tpc) have two projects:\n\nMonthey-Ville on the Aigle – Monthey – Champéry line is to be closed and the lines serving it diverted to Monthey SBB. The project was suspended in December 2019 following local objections. A revised plan has been published but work is not expected to commence until 2025, with completion in 2030. See this website for details.\n\nThe Aigle – Leysin line is to be extended by 1140 m in tunnel from the site of the existing Leysin-Village station to a new station at Leysin-Belvédère to serve a ski lift, Télésiège Tête d’Aï. Intermediate stations will be built at Village-Versmont, replacing the current Leysin-Village and Versmont stations, and at Leysin-Centre. The rack line from Leysin-Village to the current terminus of Leysin-Grand Hôtel will be closed, to be replaced by an underground funicular which will run from Leysin Centre Sportif, via an interchange at Leysin-Centre, to Leysin-Grand Hôtel-Feydey. Construction is planned to commence in 2026, with services due to begin in 2030. See the map on the tpc website for details.\n\nIn June 2019 the Swiss Parliament approved funding for a programme of works to upgrade and modernise the railway network, for the period up to 2035. Projects include:\n\nA rail line to Basel/Mulhouse airport\n\nA new line between Neuchâtel and La Chaux-de-Fonds, to avoid the reversal at Chambrelien\n\nCompletion of the southern section of the Zimmerberg tunnel, between Zürich and Zug\n\nA new, more direct line between Zürich and Winterthur, including the Brüttener tunnel from Bassersdorf and Dietlikon to Winterthur\n\nThere will also be detailed planning of new lines between Basel SBB and Basel Bad Bf and at Luzern, to avoid reversal at the main station. The latter is expected to include a new line in a tunnel below the Vierwaldstättersee.\n\nA 22 km metre-gauge link between Innertkirchen and Oberwald (the Grimselbahn), which would be mostly in tunnel including the long (8 km) Grimsel tunnel, but only single track, has been proposed. This would connect the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn and Zentralbahn metre gauge systems. The tunnels would be shared by power cables diverted from their existing route over mountains.\n\nOlder Changes\n\nFor details of older changes dating back to the year 2007 see Switzerland - Older General Information.\n\nSpecial notes\n\nDistinctions between main line railways, light railways and tramways are more difficult in Switzerland than perhaps any other country. For example, the main line of the Rhätische Bahn from St Moritz to Tirano has several sections of street running. In Chur, the first section of the Arosa line out from Chur station is street running dual track, but not wide enough to permit trains crossing. In addition there is 11 kV ac over the street.\n\nThe Matterhorn-Gotthard, Rhätische Bahn and Montreux Oberland Bernois are among the railways running \"Panoramic\", \"Glacier Express\" or other trains with special facilities, such as observation cars. A supplementary fare is usually charged and advance reservation compulsory or strongly recommended.\n\nThe European Train Control System, Level 2, incorporating in-cab signalling, is used on the Mattstetten (Bern) to Rothrist (Olten) high-speed line and through the Lötschberg, Gotthard and Ceneri base tunnels. ETCS for the Gotthard base tunnel starts at Brunnen and also goes as far as Erstfeld on the old line. South of the base tunnel ETCS goes as far as Castione-Arbedo and is also in use from a point between Bellinzona and Giubiasco to San Antonino on the Locarno line and between Taverne and Lugano.\n\nLausanne (except the station itself) to Villeneuve also has ETCS as does the line from Lausanne to Brig between km 87.1 and 112.1 (including Sion and Sierre).\n\nThe only trackside signals on these sections are shunt signals and only trains fitted with ETCS L2 in-cab signalling can operate on them.\n\nTourist railways up mountains are sometimes of limited capacity, but subject to high demand, particularly at holiday periods and during the winter sports season. In such cases it may be necessary to wait some time before being able to board a train, so it is best to arrive at the railway as early in the day as possible. When booking a trip it is often necessary to reserve a seat on a specific train down the mountain. Once the railway’s capacity to bring people back down the mountain is fully booked, no more can ascend, unless they are staying at a summit hotel."
