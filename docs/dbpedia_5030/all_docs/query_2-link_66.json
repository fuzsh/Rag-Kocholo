Transports publics fribourgeois Ensures Reliable Public Transportation Services with Engineered Database Infrastructure Fribourg, located just 17 miles from the Swiss capital Berne, is an important economic, administrative, and educational center on the cultural border between German and French Switzerland. Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF) SA, which is majority-owned by the canton of Fribourg, operates a 940-kilometer public transportation network within the metropolitan area and its adjacent rural areas. Six transport companies cover the Fribourg and the Broye regions in the canton of Vaud’s TPF’s Frimobil fare network, where the same basic fare structure applies to all travel across the region. In 2012, the organization transported almost 28 million passengers by road and rail. Oracle Customer: Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF) SA Location: Fribourg, Switzerland Industry: Travel and Transportation Employees: 700 Annual Revenue: $100 to $500 Million Challenges  Ensure high availability of database applications—such as route planning, vehicle management, and staff allocation— to enable efficient and cost-effective public transportation  Protect database applications from unforeseen downtime through hardware redundancy between production and test environments to avoid negative impact on public transportation—for examples, due to vehicle delays, customer complaints, or even legal liability  Establish efficient database support to ensure that potential issues with business-critical applications are solved rapidly, before they become apparent to customers  Optimize use of public budgets by deploying a cost- effective, integrated database application platform that a small team of in-house specialists can administer A word from Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF) SA  “Our high-availability solution, based on Oracle Database Appliance will support future business growth, as it provides real capacity on demand, excellent hardware and software integration, a complete monitoring interface with plug-ins for various services, and outstanding overall performance. It is a key tool for us, because it enables everything, from on-time public transportation and payroll, to cost-effective service growth.” – Grégoire Ramuz, IT Manager, Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF) SA\n\n2. Solutions  Deployed two Oracle Database Appliances—each equipped with four, active, central processing units (CPUs)—in clustered mode connected via Oracle Active Data Guard—to deliver outstanding performance for the company’s core applications, which ensure every resource planning aspect, from bus and train scheduling, to staff allocation and payroll  Improved logistics and service to customers—for example, by increasing public transport frequency during anticipated rush hours—with high availability of core applications  Ensured cost-effective operation and maintenance of Oracle Database Appliance through a fully integrated system of software, servers, storage, and networking with built-in diagnostics and automatic service request logs, enabling the organization to operate its IT environment with only six employees  Created the foundation for seamless public service growth with Oracle Database Appliance’s ability to scale up to 20 CPUs on demand by simply entering a software license key, eliminating the need for hardware upgrades during the entire lifecycle with a pay-as-you-grow licensing model  Used Oracle Active Data Guard to establish robust disaster recovery using fully redundant systems that redirect client connections automatically to the standby system, ensuring 24/7 operations in the case of a production system failure  Used Oracle Real Application Clusters to minimize downtime by using rolling maintenance procedures that validate patches on test environments before applying them to the production system, with complete transparency for system administrators  Enabled faster database application development and testing with 96 gigabytes of random access memory on each cluster node—a key requirement because public transportation is expected to grow in the booming Fribourg region  Increased backup capabilities and file sharing between applications by simply connecting Oracle Database Appliance to externally networked, file-system-based storage systems  Used Oracle’s best practices as deployment instructions to configure Oracle Database Appliance with few commands, deploying the solution, including definitions of Internet Protocol addresses, within three hours  Used the solution’s comprehensive monitoring interface with plug-ins for various third-party service management tools to monitoring the platform in-house, providing more stringent control over data quality"
