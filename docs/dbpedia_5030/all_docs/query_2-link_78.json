        "text": "The famed metre gauge GFM system, often known as La Gruyère, is undergoing major renovations that will make the once-historic network virtually unrecognisable.\n\nStations have been completely demolished, lines torn up and are to be replaced with standard gauge and freight operations have been disbanded altogether. Its part of a task to make the network more passenger oriented as well as create level boarding, which is something the Swiss legislation is now demanding of all its railways.\n\nOn the GFM/TPF new stations are coming on stream and these will be at the centre of huge new developments which sweep away every inch of the old system including goods yards and depots. Even the famous 'Chocolate Express' to Broc-Fabrique no longer runs. The centre of the system at Bulle is swept away entirely and replaced by a new elevated station in the middle of a vast new development.\n\nThe only saving grace in terms of heritage is the relocation of the GFM Historique stock to Montbovon on the Montreux-Oberland Bernois railway and the continuation of the famous Le Train du Fromage from Château-d'Oex to Gruyère.\n\nThe old station at Châtel-St-Denis, its goods yard, train depot and rail junctions have been swept away completely. A new chord, including a brand new station, has been built to give trains a direct route from Bulle to Palézieux and I have written about that. The Bulle-Broc section is next.\n\nUpgrading the Transports Publics Fribourgeois\n\nYes I know its not a very long line I've been on it, its about 6km. I didn't want to write what would amount to an essay on here!\n\nHowever its quite substantial that it replaces a 100 year plus tradition of delivery/despatch by the narrow gauge to the chocolate factory and a lot of people were disappointed because the move was apparently forced upon the TPF and the factory by way of SBB/CFF/FFS intransigence in how freight operations in the country were managed. Otherwise the narrow gauge would have stayed and freight on it would have continued.\n\nNestlé Broc is not interested in freight operations, nothing to do with standard or narrow gauge. Without a customer, there will not be any freight operations. Making the narrow gauge fit for level boarding would cost 35 Mio CHF, the transformation to standard gauge will cost around 50 Mio CHF. The operation costs will be reduced by a massive amount, as the same unit now waiting in Bulle for the return trip to Fribourg can be used for the return trip to Broc. The direct trains to and from Fribourg add a lot of value for passengers.\n\nThe narrow gauge line was only covering around 18-20% of its costs, in combination with the line Fribourg - Bulle it should be able to reach around 50%. This transformation might actually save the line.\n\nNestlé Broc is not interested in freight operations, nothing to do with standard or narrow gauge.

I expect you know far more than me but its not what I read of the matter when trying to find the reasons this was being done.\n\nUpgrading the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) #2\n\nThis post covers the former GFM network (often known as La Gruyère) which is now of course under the management of the TPF (Transports Publics Fribourgeois.) This section looks at the huge modernisation taking place in Bulle - the railway station's mixed gauge freight and stabling yards will have been totally swept away once the work is finished.\n\nThere's also a look at what's happening on the Broc Line, which some claim to be the biggest ever conversion from a metric to a standard gauge route in Switzerland!\n\nThird part will be the Broc line itself - its conversion to standard gauge and cessation of its substantial freight traffic.\n\nJust wanted to say it hasn't been a breeze writing this stuff - its been very hard work trying to dig up stuff and then translate it.\n\nUpgrading the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) #2\n\nThis post covers the former GFM network (often known as La Gruyère) which is now of course under the management of the TPF (Transports Publics Fribourgeois.)

I've been to Broc on the train as a kid and loved it. Cailler is some of the best chocolate out there in the whole world.\n\nVery well written/très bien écrit.

Yes its lovely chocolate!\n\nBefore the third and final part of the La Gruyère articles gets published, I slipped in a post on the adjacent Montreux Oberland Bernois line as its the line's 120th anniversary. Both systems form a considerable network of metre gauge lines in that part of Switzerland. Like the La Gruyère articles I've done, there's also stuff on the MOB's upgrades too, including Montbovon which is shared by both of these railway systems.\n\nMontreux Oberland Bernois 120th Anniversary Part One.\n\nSo, is what you’re saying is that what has been described as a conversion from Bulle to Broc is only a conversion from the junction to Broc with a new alignment from Bulle to the junction in standard gauge and the existing metre gauge from Bulle to the junction being ‘shuffled’?\n\nAFAIK yes. I think that there will be separate metre- und standard-gauge tracks entering Bulle. A dual-gauge Track would have the problem of different voltages.\n\nI’ve been looking at the info on the conversion from Bulle to Broc and there’s no mention of dual gauge. Are TPF abandoning the service to Montbovon, converting it to standard gauge or running a shuttle on the isolated section?\n\nI think all your questions have been answered in part so far, sorry I didnt get to see this thread until today!\n\nYes the section from Bulle to Tour de Treme junction where the lines for Montbovon and Broc diverge will be dual gauge. Montbovon will continue to be used by metre gauge trains from Palézieux.\n\nThe dual gauge section will be switchable between 900v DC (metre gauge) and 15KV (standard gauge.)\n\nIts actually very hard to find the information as the TPF website seems to be missing a number of important factors such as this - but I managed to dig it up!\n\nI know, but it’s quite rare to build it from scratch nowadays.\n\nIt probably is, however this is the second new example to be built in the area. Besides Bulle to Broc the MOB and the BLS have totally rewired the OHLE in Zweisimmen so that each companies own trains which use the same tracks can run on these in their respective voltages! MOB voltage is 850v dc and BLS 15kv.\n\nIts a very complex system, but its necessary for the variable gauge trains that are due to run through from Montreux to Interlaken next year if all goes well.\n\nThat means that my own answer was completely wrong and I apologize for it.\n\nNo worries!\n\nI think all your questions have been answered in part so far, sorry I didnt get to see this thread until today!\n\nYes the section from Bulle to Tour de Treme junction where the lines for Montbovon and Broc diverge will be dual gauge.

It seems as if the majority of the info is restricted to the Bulle to Broc line.\n\nI write to inform that the third part of my Upgrading the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (the former GFM network) has been completed. This of course looks at the line to Broc and its conversion to standard gauge and some of the huge engineering difficulties involved.\n\nAdditionally there's a retrospective look at the historic metre gauge freight operations, plus a considerable amount of research as to why this very important and indeed busy freight operation was abandoned. Its an issue that has irked rail advocates in Switzerland especially in the light that rail could do so much better than road in terms of the environment.\n\nNext in the series will be a look at the various upgrades to the Montreux Oberland Bernois including the new automated train control now being stipulated by the Swiss government, the line's brand new stations and of course the many new bridges and tunnels - including engineering designs never used in Switzerland.\n\nUpgrading the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) #3"
