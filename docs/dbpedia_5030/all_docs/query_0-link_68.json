There is also a 12.9 km (8.0 mi) branch-line from Zweisimmen to Lenk.\n\nMontreux-Oberland Bernois Railway History and Route\n\nThe main line of the MOB was opened in stages, the first, from Montreux to Les Avants (10.9 km or 6.8 mi) on 17 December 1901, followed by the Les Avants to Montbovon (11.2 km or 7.0 mi) section on 1 October 1903. The next stages from Montbovon to Château-d'Œx (10.6 km or 6.6 mi) and then Gstaad (13.1 km or 8.1 mi) followed on 19 August 1904 and 20 December 1904 respectively, the final 16.6 km (10.3 mi) of the line reaching Zweisimmen on 6 July 1905. The spur line to Lenk was opened in 1912.\n\nFrom the very start, the MOB had the character of a mainline railway and, at an early stage, through trains with dining and saloon coaches were introduced. The creation of the Golden Mountain Pullman Express in 1931 was unfortunately at a time of world economic crisis and this accounted for its lack of success. The saloon coaches 103-106 built for this train by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) were sold to the Rhaetian Railway in 1939, where they are still in use (As 1141-44). Two of the original (1913-14 built) coaches have been restored by the MOB and are used for \"Chocolate Train\" services in the summer months, but still regularly find work on the main line \"Classic train\" services on Sundays throughout the year. The modern successor of this luxury train is the Golden Pass Panoramic Express, which for the past few years has aroused growing enthusiasm.\n\nThe MOB begins its journey in Montreux, departing trains normally making use of platform 5 and arrivals platform 6, between the Swiss Federal Railway platforms and those of the rack and pinion railway to the Rochers de Naye. Winding its way up through the vineyards above Lake Geneva via Chamby, as far as Les Avants, the line passes through the crown tunnel under the Col de Jaman to reach the Saane Valley. In Montbovon there is a connection to the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF; previously GFM) network. Following the Saane upstream, passing the famous hot-air ballooning centre of Château-d'Oex, it leaves the French-speaking canton of Vaud near Rougemont and enters the German-speaking canton of Berne. After Saanen the planners would have liked a direct ascent of the Sannenmöser Pass but without the aid of a rack and pinion system this was impossible and the line was diverted to loop around the village of Gstaad, adding greatly to the development and prosperity of the community. Beyond Gstaad railway station it begins the climb to the head of Saanenmöser Pass, the highest point on the line at 1270 m (3937 ft). On the other side it descends the Simmen Valley to Zweisimmen, where there is a connection to the standard gauge line of the BLS to Spiez.\n\nOver the years, while passenger traffic boomed, freight traffic diminished with 2006 seeing the end of cement transport between Montreux and Saanen and the transport of standard gauge wagons on transporter bogies between Zweisimmen and stations to Rougemont and Lenk. By the end of the year the MOB was a passenger only operation, however in Spring 2007 the company purchased nine gravel (hopper) wagons and two surplus locomotives from the TPF. The MOB now operates this transport from Grandvillard (on the TPF line) to Saanen.\n\nThe Lenk branch retraces this route for a very short distance before continuing on its own trackbed. Because of its poor state of repair, this line was closed on 14 June 1975, however, it was fully modernized between 1977 and 1979, having new tracks and overhead lines, reopening on 27 September 1979. New rolling stock was purchased (* in the list below) to operate this line together with the weekdays school service between Zweisimmen and Saanen. Since reopening it has been included in the regular operating schedule of the MOB with timetabled connections to the main line services. To celebrate the centenary of the opening of the Lenk line (June 2012), the MOB arranged a week of festivities with a dinner, special fares and operation and display of rolling stock usually to be found on museum lines, particularly that at Blonay-Chamby.\n\n(Source: Journal du Pays D'Enhault, published 24 May 2012)\n\nMontreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Modernisation Program\n\nIn Spring 2008 the MOB announced a four-year plan to modernise the railway infrastructure and rebuild stations to bring them all into the 21st century. This programme began with the demolition of little used facilities; the goods shed in Gstaad and the shed in Château-d'Œx, this latter structure being replaced by a free-standing shelter, for example. During 2008 much work took place on the overhead line equipment with replacement supports being positioned along the line although not brought into use they stand ready for the new wiring. It is expected that this work will continue, up to 4 nights per week through to December 2009, subject to weather conditions. New deeper ballasting has taken place along many sections of the line and this will be continued until the line has all been done.\n\nThe work at Gstaad consisted of a complete rebuilding of the platforms to full height and simplification of the track layout. After almost 100 years the station got platform canopies and passenger operated lifts linked by a pedestrian underpass. During this rebuilding the station was reduced to a single line. The canopy is of wooden construction supported on metal uprights. The new layout gives the original platform as No.1 with the new island platform being Nos. 2 and 3. This work was officially opened, if not fully finished, on 13 June 2009.\n\nAt Saanenmöser station a straightforward relaying and alignment took place through late 2008 / early 2009 which maintained the passing and siding facility at that location.\n\nDuring the early part of 2010, by the end of May, the stations underwent a rebranding along with those of other lines which come under the \"Golden Pass\" banner. All were fitted with signs bearing the new \"Golden Pass\" logo and name alongside the station nameboards, which were retained in their original colours.\n\nOne of the smallest stations / halts, Les Combes, between Château-d'Œx and Rougemont, was given a new, raised platform during Autumn 2011 leaving only the waiting shelter as original, quite a lot of money spent for so few passengers.\n\nWork commenced on the rebuilding of Château-d'Œx station in mid - September 2013 and plans were published in the local newspaper with details of the work which is carried out in three phases and completed by the end of 2014. Throughout the work the passing loop facility was maintained and raised platforms constructed reached by subways from the station front. Construction work was delayed and the station officially reopened on 28 November 2015.\n\n(Source : 24 heures, Vaud edition, various dates in April/May 2009)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 1 October 2009)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 12 September 2013)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 26 November 2015)\n\nMontreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Timetables and Train Formations\n\nFrom the beginning of 2011 timetable there are two Golden Pass Panorama services, with VIP seating (domed end cars), departing Montreux at 09h45 (Train 3118) and 15h45,(Train Nos 2128), the Lenk branch ceases to be served, the \"through\" working only lasting one year (2010). It is normally made up in the following formation and operate in the \"push-pull\" mode :\n\nAst / Brs / As / Locomotive / BDs / Bs* / Arst* : This is the length limit of the train due to platform lengths. Trains may be shorter off-season.\n\nThere are other Golden Pass trains without VIP seating (dome end cars) and these depart Montreux at 07h45, 11h49, 14h47 and 17h45 (Trains 2112, 2124, 2228 and 2134) and from Zweisimmen at 08h26, 10h26, 14h26 and 17h05 (Trains 2111, 3115, 3123 and 2229). These trains are locomotive hauled and use stock not required for the trains with VIP seating. The formation, which is flexible, is usually as follows :\n\nLocomotive / As / As / BDs / Bs / Bs\n\nThis leaves a surplus of one domed observation car (two in use on the Golden Pass Panorama and one on the \"Chocolate Train\")\n\nGolden Pass Classic trains operate daily departing Montreux at 08h47 and 13h45 (Trains 2216 and 3126), returning from Zweisimmen at 11h09 and 16h26 (Trains 2217 and 2127) and are made up in the following formation :\n\nLocomotive / As / As / Brs / Bs / Non-Classic Type BD (to provide cycle / luggage space)\n\nThe Golden Pass \"Chocolate Train\" operates in June, September and October every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and in July and August Monday to Friday, departing Montreux at 09h12 (Train 2118) but no return working is shown in the timetable. Until the end of the 2008 season it was made up in the following formation which ran throughout between Montreux and Broc Fabrique:\n\nLocomotive / Belle Epoque Ars / Belle Epoque As / Other vehicles as required (usually Panorama type and/or Non-Classic type BD).\n\nIn the 2009 timetable the formation was changed and only operated between Montreux and Gruyere only with a coach connection to Broc (Due to operating problems), as follows:\n\nLocomotive (Usually 6003 Saanen, in special Chocolate Train livery) / Belle Epoque Ars / Belle Epoque Ars / Golden Pass Panorama observation car (No. 116 or 117) operating in \"Push - Pull\" mode.\n\nOther trains Montreux-Zweisimmen may be pulled by a The Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Ge 4/4.\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: GDe 4/4.\n\nOr The Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: ABDe 8/8 and they can have up to five coaches.\n\nLocal services operate connecting Montreux to Fontanivent (Mon - Fri ), Chernex, Sonzier and Les Avants, operated by Be 2/6 7001-7004 and from Château-d'Oex, Saanen or Gstaad to Zweisimmen.\n\nThe branch-line from Zweisimmen to Lenk offers a regular service timetabled to connect into and out of the MOB main line services.\n\nThese trains are operated by The Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: Be 4/4 5001-5004.\n\nMontreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 3\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Tm 2/2\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Manufacturer: KHD\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 55736-1955\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: Ex- V22, Euskirchener Kreisbahnen, Germany: Sold 1966 to VGH (Germany) V121.\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 34\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Tm 2/2\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 1934\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: Ex-Rhätische Bahn 9913\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 35\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Name: Béa\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Tm 2/2\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Manufacturer: Kaelble-Gmeinder\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 5553-1976\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: 2007 ex-Benkler 25\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 36\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Name: Elsbeth\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Tm 2/2\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Manufacturer: Kaelble-Gmeinder\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 5586-1980\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: 2007 ex-Benkler 26\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 37\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: Tm 2/2\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 1950\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: Ex-Rhätische Bahn 9914\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Number: 328\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Class: De 4/4\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Manufacturer: SIG/BBC\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Works No./Date Built: 1924\n\nThe Montreux-Oberland Bernois Railway Locomotives and Motor Coaches Notes: Engineers Dept.

This was to include the various railways and funiculars marketed under the \"Golden Pass\" banner and the buses operated by the company. The colour scheme is to be a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) with all stock being rebranded \"Golden Pass\". The new colours will be applied to the stock as it passes through works, although the \"Golden Pass\" logo will be applied as soon as practicable. The first vehicle to be reliveried, First / Second Composite Coach AB307, appeared in traffic on 27 August 2010.\n\n(Source : Journal de Pays d'Enhaut, 1 October 2009)\n\n(Source : Journal de Pays d'Enhaut, 26 August 2010)\n\n(See our additional page on the Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway - Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway (A))"
