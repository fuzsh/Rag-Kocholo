        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nIntro\n\nMe and my fiancee have been given the opportunity to work remotely in Switzerland (while keeping the same salary and benefits). We are currently in Schaffhausen and learning German: she is B1 in German and I am A2 in German.\n\nCombined Salary is at 190K.\n\nCurrent rent is 1590/mo for a 2.5 modern flat near the train station.\n\nWe do not own a car and are planning to avoid owning one for as long as possible.\n\nWe would prefer paying +200-300/mo in rent vs living far away somewhere and owning a car\n\nWe both have family in the french part of Switzerland (Montreux+Clarens+Chatel-St-Denis) and with a plan to stay long term and eventually start a family.\n\nI feel like it would be great if we have a support system around us.\n\nAdditionally, I have heard horror stories from portuguese immigrants whose kids face challenges in school due to German not being their native language. Both me and my fiancee have master degrees and want our future children to have sucess and not be limited due to a language barrier.\n\nBig Decision\n\nThis is where your feedback comes in, if you could freely choose where to live, where would you live?\n\nSome of what we are looking for:\n\nClose to a Train Station would be preferable\n\nThe closer to Montreux the better, closer to Clarens or Chatel-St-Denis would also be great (we are open to other cantons/cities as well)\n\nOur main goal is to get C1-C2 in French with this move so that we can be fully integrated and provide a good future to our future family\n\nThe lower the tax the better but I understand that in the French part, this is so common. But Schaffhausen has a relatively high tax burden anyways\n\nWe would prefer to live in a larger city rather than a small city (+50k would be great)\n\nSince we would be working remotely, any city with a lot of clubs would be appreciated! We have a couple of mainstream hobbies so we should be able to find something (Running, Hiking, Cycling, Target Shooting, etc)\n\nI know that everyone is different but for my fellow portuguese, how long did it take for you to become conversational in French?\n\nAdditionally, if you guys think I am not paying enough attention to a particular detail, I would really appreciate it if you would call it out!\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\nValais doesn’t really have cities. The closest decently sized town to your family would be Monthey. There are some activities and there is some cultural life but it’s nowhere close to what you’d find in a “city” like Lausanne. Carnaval is the signature festival of the town. People who grew up in Monthey tend to have a sense of community and stick together later on.\n\nFarther would be Martigny, smaller though with a nice historical background, nice summer evenings on the Place centrale and no trouble getting back home after having spent the day at the infamous “Foire du Valais” one week per year. Your children would thank you for that.\n\nFarther yet is Sion, the capital. Decent enough cultural life, decent amount of activities, nice town design, a decent array of shops, colleges and part of the HES-SO Valais, decent summer scene, decent Carnaval, nice weekly market, decent amount of fairs throughout the year (outside of Covid times, of course).\n\nOnly you can know where you want to live. Given your situation, I’d spend a weekend in each of Vevey, Montreux, Lausanne, Fribourg, Sion and maybe Monthey. See if you like the experience then dig deeper into what those who caught your attention really have to offer.\n\nFribourg has lower taxes than Vaud. It’s also a bit further from the Leman which might result in lower rents. Some places in FR are not that far from Montreux, check Attalens for example. It’s quite literally on the border of VD.\n\nThe population of Attalens is nowhere near your goal though and you will need a car. Wherever you consider going, try to find people who can give you an honest and experience based (this topic can be a bit of a taboo) opinion on the local school (they are not all equal no matter what people say). In the end that may be the biggest thing affecting your happiness.\n\nIt should be mentioned that public transport connections with Montreux from Fribourg, Bulle, and even Châtel-St-Denis are far from great (you can check yourself on sbb.ch)\n\nThe area Attalens-Châtel-St-Denis has become a sort of residential suburb of the Montreux-Lausanne area, with slightly cheaper housing and lower taxes.\n\nHowever, you’re loosing the advantage of the great train connections along the lake shore and you get a slightly cooler climate (more fog in winter, more northern wind than in Montreux or Lausanne).\n\nI think the Portuguese community is quite large in most of the French speaking part of the country.\n\nI love Wallis, but from your description of your free time, I wouldn’t want to settle too far from Lausanne.\n\nI would also strongly recommend to spend at least a few weekends in these areas and check by yourself."
