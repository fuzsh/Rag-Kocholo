The first part of our GFM journey is the only piece of street running on the network.\n\nSection 2: Grandvillard is seen in both 1990 and after remodelling in 2010. Onwards we see all stations on our journey to Gruyères and visit the town.\n\nSection 3: Gruyères sees train services passing, then onwards to Bulle.\n\nSection 4: Now to Broc, home of the Cailler-Nestlé chocolate factory. After a local service to Bulle departs the stock for the GoldenPass chocolate train arrives to form the return to Montreux. This is then seen on its way to Bulle.\n\nSection 5: Gruyères sees the train on both the outward and return journeys. After the Montbovon street running the chocolate train rejoins the MOB route.\n\nGFM - La Gruyere (Part 2) 50 mins\n\nDisc AV652: Bulle - Palézieux - Romont\n\nSection 1: Bulle station is visited in 1989 and 1990 as GFM and then revisited in 2010 as TPF (Transports Publics Fribourgeois). Wide verities of liveries are seen as well as piggy-back movements. Also a look at the town.\n\nSection 2: We start and pass a busy GFM Bulle depot in 1990. This is a mixed journey comparing 1990 and 2010 At La Verrerie we await the single line. Many more stations are seen before arrival at Châtel-St-Denis.\n\nSection 3: The route from Châtel-St-Denis to Palézieux was filmed in 1990. SBB mainline and TPF and Postbus activity is seen at Palézieux.\n\nProduced by - Anbrico Felixjaz\n\nRunning time - 102 Minutes (2 discs)\n\nDVD only"
