The region's 17 transportation companies have banded together to create a system in which one ticket will get you anywhere in the region.\n\nFor more information, including maps and timetables, see the VAG transit site or the RVF regional transportation authority's Web pages. You can buy printed maps, tickets, and transit souvenirs (including official tram drivers' neckties) in the VAG-pluspunkt Freiburg office, which is located at Salzstrasse 3.\n\nBicycle: Although bikes aren't allowed in the pedestrian zone, they're useful for excursions, and there are more than 450 km (300 miles) of bike paths outside the Altstadt. You can rent a two-wheeler at the Bicyle Station and Mobility Station next to the main railroad station, which also has parking for 1,000 bikes. (Other bike parking lots are scattered around the city.)\n\nTaxi: You can get a cab at the train station, and several firms (including ROLLIMOBIL, 0761/28 35 58) offer wheelchair taxis.\n\nCablecars: Small aerial gondolas of the Schlossbergbahn connect the Stadtgarten or city park with the Dattler Restaurant and the Burghaldering, 80 meters above the city center. In the suburbs, the Schauinslandbahn offers 20-minute, 3.6-km aerial cablecar rides to the Bergwelt Schauinsland, where you can climb up an observation tower, go hiking, or enjoy attractions such as skiing, a wildlife park, and the world's longest accessible rope bridge.\n\nParking"
