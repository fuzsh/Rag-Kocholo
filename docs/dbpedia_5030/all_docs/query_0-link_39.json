        "text": "What were the goals/parameters (scale of the issue or opportunity)\n\nKeeping track of a dynamic fleet of buses within a large indoor and underground space is a challenge. This was recognised by the management at the TPF bus depot in Switzerland where a Ubisense real-time location system (RTLS) has been installed in conjunction with a web-based depot management system software. This software was specifically developed for TPF to seamlessly work with SmartSpace, Ubisense’s modular software platform that uses real-time location and identification data from multiple sources to create mission-critical visibility and control applications.\n\nThe TPF depot management team were looking for a reliable and cost-effective RTLS that would improve the daily management of their bus depot.\n\nIn order to ensure each route is covered according to the timetable, the arrival and departure times of the buses must be monitored and maintained alerting key personnel to possible timetable deviation. Therefore, the precise location and positioning of each vehicle is critical to ensuring that they can be dispatched according to schedule and in the right order.\n\nThe Solution: How does Ubisense technology help you overcome your challenge or achieve your vision\n\nA real-time location ultra-wide-band (UWB) radio system transmitter, known as a Ubisense tag, is attached to each bus. The tag emits small signals which are picked up by the network of Ubisense sensors located around the depot. The real-time location information is displayed within the depot management solution online interface enabling the despatch as to schedule and process-manage the depot efficiently.\n\nThe depot management system in conjunction with the Ubisense RTLS system has provided the perfect solution for the TPF bus depot offering 24/7 visibility of the buses across the depot and making significant efficiency improvements.\n\nWhat have been the outcomes (results of the project)"
