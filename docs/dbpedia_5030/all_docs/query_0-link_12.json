        "text": "This page shows postcards and images of la GruyÃ¨re which operates metre and standard gauge railways in the Swiss canton of Fribourg.\n\nThe main line of the narrow gauge network runs from PalÃ©zieux, on the SBB main line from Bern to Lausanne, via ChÃ¢tel-St-Denis and Bulle to Montbovon and has a total length of 44.2 km. The short Bulle-Broc branch, which was opened for traffic in 1912, leaves the main line just before La Tour-de-TrÃªme station and serves the nearby NestlÃ© chocolate factory (previously Cailler), as well as the village of Broc. There is talk (in 2014) of converting the Broc branch to standard gauge.\n\nThe system was opened in stages, that from ChÃ¢tel-St-Denis to PalÃ©zieux (CP) in 1901, then over the following three years by the lines which made up the Chemins de fer Ã©lectriques de la GruyÃ¨re (CEG), originally named CBM, those from ChÃ¢tel-St-Denis to Vaudens, Vaudens to Bulle, Bulle to La Tour-de-TrÃªme and from La Tour-de-TrÃªme to Montbovon. From 20 December 1907 the CP was absorbed into CEG, and the branch line to Broc being added in 1912. Soon the company extended its activity into the bus sector and built up a large network. From 1 January 1942, and with the addition of two standard gauge lines, Bulle-Romont and Fribourg-Murten- ns, they formed the Chemins de fer Fribourgeois, GruyÃ¨re-Fribourg-Morat (GFM).\n\nBulle is the centre of operations with depot, workshops and, within its modern station, the connection between the metre and standard gauge lines as well as many bus routes. Transfer to the trains of the Montreux-Oberland Bernois takes place in Montbovon, and until 1969, ChÃ¢tel-St-Denis was also reached by a line of the CEV from Vevey.\n\nRailcars were the chosen motive power from the early days in the main due to the reversal of trains at ChÃ¢tel-St. Denis, and this has continued with rebuilt or new modern units, working as single cars or in multiple. In 2000 the company was renamed Transports publics Fribourgeois SA (Freiburgische Verkehrsbetriebe AG) and the city of Fribourg motor bus and trolley bus routes were integrated.\n\nSince 1958 goods traffic, much of which is shipped onwards by the standard gauge, has been carried by a \"piggy back\" system where the standard gauge wagons are transported on carrier trucks. In 2004 the NestlÃ© factory at Broc Fabrique generated over 1500 wagonloads over the system. From December 2006 the TPF handed its freight traffic to the CFF/SBB/FFS and its two locomotives, numbers 101 and 102 became surplus to requirements. In April 2007 they were sold to the MOB, who ran identical locos."
