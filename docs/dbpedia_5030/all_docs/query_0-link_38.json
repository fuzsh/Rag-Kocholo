        "text": "The Chemin de fer Montreux-Oberland bernois (MOB) or Montreux-Oberland-Bahn is a 1m gauge railway that runs between Montreux on Lake Geneva to Zweisimmen in the Simmental and from there continues to Lenk, a distance of 75km. There are no rack sections on the line. The electric system is 900V DC. The line was opened in 1905.\n\nFour class Be 4/4 railcars were delivered in 1976. They were particularly used for shuttle trains between Zweisimmen and Lenk, and also on trains near Montreux. One of the railcars in Zweisimmen. [May 2002].\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009 these railcars were rebuilt. They don't have a driver's cab any more, instead a low-floor driving trailer with cab was added on each side. One such train stands in Zweisimmen ready for departure towards Lenk. On the adjacent track is a standard gauge train of the BLS. [Dec 2015]. A class Be4/4 railcar with a driving trailer on each side. Teh pantographs of the railcar at the middle of the train can be seen clearly. Lenk is particularly a winter sport resort. [Mar 2015]. The four class ABDe 8/8 railcars were introduced from 1968 onwards. They are used for Regio trains between Montreux and Zweisimmen, generally running the whole length of the line. Sometimes they haul additional carraiges, sometimes a train consists of just the railcar. One of the railcars in Zweisimmen ready for departure towards Montreux. [Dec 2015].

Between Montreux and Zweisimmen the MOB operates the Golden Pass Panoramic Express. These trains have carriages with panorama windows. Several of the trains have special driving trailers, where passengers have a view on the line ahead. The driver sits in a small compartment above the passengers. One of the Golden Pass Panoramic Express trains arrives in SaanenmÃ¶ser. [Apr 2015]. At an altitue of 1269m SaanenmÃ¶ser is the highest station of the MOB. A class BDe 4/4 railcar with attached snow plough arrives in SaanenmÃ¶ser during a snow storm. That day it ran regularly over the line to allow other trains to pass. The railcar entered service in 1944 and is now used as maintenance vehicle. [Dec 2014]. A Golden Pass Panoramic Express without driving trailer passes through the snow near SaanenmÃ¶ser. The Golden-Pass-Route runs from Montreux via the MOB to Zweisimmern, from there via the BLS to Interlaken Ost, and finally via BrÃ¼nig Pass (ZB) to Luzern. But it is particularly the MOB that uses the name ini its promotional material. [Dec 2014]. It is Christmas time and a class ABDe 8/8 railcar has arrived in SchÃ¶nried. [Dec 2015].

Today it is only used as a reserve railcar. [Apr 2015]. A class ABDe 8/8 arrives in Montbovon as Regio from Montreux to Zweisimmen. At this hour of the day only few people are still travelling on this remote railway. [Aug 2015]. In Montbovon the MOB connects to the TPF, the Transports publics fribourgeois. The TPF has a narrow gauge line from Montbovov via Gruyere to Bulle and from there to Broc. This photo shows a TPF train on the left and a MOB Golden Pass Panoramic Express on the right. [Apr 2015]."
