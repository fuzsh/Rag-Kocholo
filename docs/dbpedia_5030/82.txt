SBB, the ski resorts (including Verbier), Regionalps, Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) and TMR are launching the VosAlpes Express – a train service providing a direct connection from Fribourg to Le Châble railway station – during winter 2021/22. During the first year, this new service will run every Saturday and Sunday from 15 January to 13 February and then from 12 to 27 March 2022.

By opting for this mode of transport, you will receive reductions on the train ticket (up to 70%) as well as the one-day ski pass for the Verbier ski area which can be loaded directly onto your SwissPass.

So leave your car at home and travel on a convenient and eco-friendly service instead.
