        "text": "The iconic and inimitable Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Tina Turner, gave the world nearly two dozen albums, 18 hit songs, and imbued a sense of confidence across generations. “If you are unhappy with anything... whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you’ll find that when you’re free, your true creativity, your true self, comes out,\" said Turner in the November 1986 issue of Ebony.\n\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock in 1939 in Tennessee, Turner was given the stage name Tina by her long-time partner and R&B singer, Ike Turner, whom she had a publicly turbulent relationship with for nearly 30 years. As a Black woman in rock, Turner carved a unique niche into the modern soundscape and paved a road for artists that followed.\n\nTop Tina Turner Songs\n\nWith an endless catalog of popular hits “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” “Proud Mary,” and “The Best,” Turner also had hidden gems like “I Can’t Stand The Rain” and “It Sho Ain’t Me” which show a softer side of the Queen of rock ‘n’ roll. Here are Turner’s top 10 greatest songs that stand the test of time.\n\n10. “It Sho Ain’t Me” by Ike and Tina Turner (1968)\n\nThe seventh studio album from the Ike and Tina duo out of nearly twenty albums, So Fine, released in 1968, was a soulful gem and a glimpse at Tina’s vocal abilities. “It Sho Ain’t Me” is reminiscent of the Motown sound of the 1960s layered with dynamic backup singers and the emotion of Turner’s rock splendor.\n\n9. “I Can’t Stand The Rain” by Tina Turner (1984)\n\nA cover of Tennesee soul singer Ann Peebles’ 1973 classic, “I Can’t Stand The Rain,” Turner’s version takes a groovy downtempo soul song and makes it authentically rock ‘n’ roll. Peebles’ song has been famously sampled and popularized for new generations by Missy Elliott, Kaytranda, and others.\n\n8. “Proud Mary” by Ike and Tina Turner (1970)\n\n“Rollin’, rollin’, rollin' on the river,” might be one of Turner’s most well-known sing-a-long songs. \"Proud Mary,\" was originally written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival about an old steamboat on the Mississippi River–subject matter that may seem unusual for Turner’s style–but in true Tina fashion, the singer breathed new life into this classic, making it uniquely her own.\n\n7. “What’s Love Got to Do With It” by Tina Turner (1984)\n\nThis 1980s hit opens up with the iconic, warm-sounding synthesizer of the decade as Turner’s sultry R&B vocals lead into the rock-flavored chorus. “What’s Love Got to Do With It” was Turner’s best-selling single winning three Grammy’s: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song was also used as the title for the 1993 film based on Turner's life.\n\n6. “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)” by Tina Turner (1985)\n\nFalling well under the radar of Tina Turner songs, “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)” is from the 1985 action film, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (or Mad Max 3), which starred Mel Gibson and Turner who played Aunty Entity, the founder and ruler of the film’s wasteland, \"Bartertown.”\n\n5. “Nutbush City Limits (90s version)” by Tina Turner (1991)\n\nAn update to her 1973 song with Ike Turner, Turner rewrote “Nutbush City Limits” about her hometown in Nutbush, Tennessee in 1991 and released it on Simply The Best, a limited-release compilation album of the artist’s greatest hits. Turner’s self-remake of the 1991 song, an uptempo, dance track, was only available on 12“ vinyl record.\n\n4. “Missing You” by Tina Turner (1996)\n\nA strong and emotional vocal powerhouse, Turner delivers John Waite’s “Missing You” love song as simultaneously delicate and heavy. In 1996, Billboard described the song perfectly, “Turner's distinctive growl pushed to deliciously dramatic heights matched by countless layers of synths and a crisp rock backbeat.”\n\n3. “Funkier Than a Mosquito's Tweeter” by Ike & Tina Turner (1970)\n\nWritten by Alline Bullock, Turner’s older sister, a songwriter, and the manager of the Ikettes trio, “Funkier Than a Mosquito's Tweeter” was, as it sounds, incredibly funky. Produced by Ike Turner, the song tells the story of a sketchy, unidentified man–a topic so relatable that Nina Simone famously went on to create a rendition of the song which became the best-known version.\n\n2. “The Best” by Tina Turner (1989)\n\nComplete with a funky bass line and swinging drum pacing, “The Best” is Turner’s cover of Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler’s 1988 Norwegian hit. Turner’s celebrity and skill positioned the song as a global success and went on to garner double platinum status in the United Kingdom.\n\n1. “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine” by Ike & Tina Turner (1961)\n\nIke and Tina’s second Grammy-nominated song, this 1961 record almost foreshadows the future in a call and response style. True to the 1960s sound, “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine” is laced with gospel, soul and a timeless sway.\n\nBottom Line"
