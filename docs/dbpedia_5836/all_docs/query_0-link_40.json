        "text": "We are Time Travelers. We are more than a mid-century lighting brand. We get inspired and we inspire. You just won a free ticket to travel in time with Turner Lamp! This mid-century design was inspired by the electrifying and memorable dance moves of Tina Turner. Come aboard and see which were the most important events when the pop singer was born!\n\nDelightFULL has the power to travel in time with its pieces. We like to call ourselves Time Travelers, because when we look at one piece we are in the past, in the present and in the future, simultaneously.\n\nThe Past, because DelightFULL’s pieces were inspired by great jazz musicians, singers and composers from the 50’s. The Present, because our pieces are handmade by national producers that use peculiar and unique techniques. And, of course, the Future, because we are witnessing innovative designs. The mid-century lighting brand ’s designers deconstruct certain concepts and create innovative pieces that are going to be presented at Light and Building 2018, in Frankfurt, from 18th to 23rd March.\n\nToday, we give you the opportunity to travel with Turner Lamp. Let’s get straight to the year when Tina Turner was born!\n\nRead Also: Complete Your Art Deco Interior Design with Turner Family\n\n1939\n\nTina Turner was born on November 26, 1939. Just like Tina, this was a very outstanding year!\n\nIt was the beginning of the Second World War. It was the most global war in history and it directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. It was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of which were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease, and the first use of nuclear weapons in history.\n\nIt was a very dark phase of history. Fortunately, 1939 was also marked as the year of Tina Turner’s birth, born as Anna Mae Bullock. She is an American-born Swiss singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, and author. Born and raised in the Southeastern United States, Turner relinquished her American citizenship.\n\n1958\n\nShe began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm, first recording under the name “Little Ann”. Ike Turner was Tina’s husband and he was an American musician, bandleader, songwriter, arranger, talent scout, and record producer. An early pioneer of fifties rock and roll, he is most popularly known for his work in the 1960s and 1970s with his then-wife Tina Turner in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\n1983\n\nAfter her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career through live performances. In the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback with another string of hits, starting in late 1983 with the single “Let’s Stay Together” followed by the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer which became a worldwide success. The album contained the song “What’s Love Got to Do with It”, which became Turner’s biggest hit and won four Grammy Awards including Record of the Year.\n\n2008\n\nOne of the world’s best-selling artists of all time, she has also been referred to as The Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Her combined album and single sales total approximately 100 million copies worldwide. Turner has also sold more concert tickets than any other solo performer in history. In 2008, Turner returned from semi-retirement to embark on her Tina! 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner’s tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008.\n\nShe is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n\n2016\n\nIn this year, the first member of DelightFULL’s Turner Family was born. Based in all the historical and personal events, it is easy to understand why DelightFULL did this tribute. With its mid-century modern touch, it is one of the most peculiar and fun pieces!\n\nTurner Table Lamp\n\nTurner Suspension Lamp\n\nTurner Floor Lamp\n\nTurner Wall Lamp\n\nIt is Simple the Best to see that Turner Family is completed! Its five movable arcs can be rotated into the desired position, which gives this lamp a sense of fun, and allows you to create the best composition to fit your modern home décor. A versatile piece, that can be used in almost any room of your house, this brass lamp looks its best when placed in a modern home office or art deco inspired living room.\n\nYou can see members of this family at the Frankfurt fair, Light and Building. You can find DelightFULL booth at Hall 1.1, Stand F-30.\n\nWe expect you enjoyed this trip to the past.
