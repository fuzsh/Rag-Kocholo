        "text": "When the news broke on Thursday, May 24th that the great Tina Turner had passed away, music journalists from around the world mobilized to memorialize this towering woman of music in many different ways. For Saving Country Music, this took shape as a recitation of Tina Turner’s contributions to country music that came as a surprise to many people.\n\nNo, Tina Turner was not a country music star. But her first solo album in 1974 was called Tina Turns The Country On! and included country and folk classics. Turner also recorded about 10 or so other country songs during her career, both during her time with Ike Turner and afterwards. She also inspired Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson to write the country classic “Good Hearted Woman.”\n\nWe’re all music fans first, and then our loyalties split down genre lines. That’s why the entire music world mourned the loss of Tina Turner, including country fans. But it’s always cool when you discover that someone you may not expect loves country music like you do, whether that’s some sports celebrity, actor, or in this case, a pop, soul, and rock star. It’s even more cool when they performed country music, like Tina Turner did.\n\nThough Turner definitely deserved more recognition for her efforts in the country music realm while she was still alive, it was warm to see country fans discovering that in her own little way, Tina Turner was one of us. She loved country music. But of course, in this polarized and outrage-driven environment that we live in today, some are taking the moment of Tina Turner’s death to assert that the singer was one of country music’s Black contributors that was somehow shut out or shunned by the country music industry.\n\nThough it’s certainly true that at times in the past, country music has been less than accommodating or outright hostile to certain Black performers in shameful ways, this is absolutely not the case with Tina Turner. Creating this canard is a gross rewriting of history being perpetrated by people who want to use Turner’s death to morally preen while once again using country music as the foil.\n\nThe day after Tina Turner passed away, Rolling Stone posted a story entitled, “Tina Turner’s Solo Debut Was a Country Album. Why Hasn’t the Genre Claimed Her as Its Own?” Of course, it’s paywalled, like so many of these think pieces these days. But the summation of the article reads in part,\n\n“Despite recording a series of country songs by Dolly Parton, Hank Snow, and Kris Kristofferson for her 1974 solo debut ‘Tina Turns the Country On!’, the album remains a curiosity, or entirely unknown, by today’s country music listener. What’s more, Nashville and the genre have yet to embrace Turner the way it has other country-adjacent icons…”\n\nThe article is rather quick and surprisingly poorly-constructed by Joseph Hudak. It’s not even clear if he wrote it, or if it was author Francesca T. Royster who is also cited. Either way, instead of running down the full breadth of Tina Turner’s country music contributions and bonafides in an attempt to educate the public and re-introduce Tina’s legacy into the country music canon, the article just descends into a succession of buzzwards and sloganeering about Tina Turner to try and ingratiate itself to a constituency, speaking about her “power” and her ability to “weaponize lots of different kinds of music.”\n\nMarcus K. Dowling writing for The Tennessean does a much better job actually running down what Tina Turner did within the country music realm, why country music meant something to her, and why Tina Turner should mean something to country music. But still, the implication is that it’s country music’s fault that Turner didn’t make it as a country music star. Once again stuck behind a paywall, the article is titled “How Tina Turner’s interrupted country legacy could have changed the genre.”\n\nBut in neither of these stories do you read about how Tina Turner came to Nashville and couldn’t find producers and players to work with her, or how she was shuffled out the back door at the Grand Ole Opry, or how they released a single to country radio but country radio refused to play it. The reason for this is because these stories don’t exist, nor do any others that in any way implicate “country music” as being unfair or unaccommodating to Tina Turner or her music in any way.\n\nAs one former country music DJ commented:\n\nI’m a lifelong fan of country music and I was working full-time in country radio in 1974. But this is the first I’ve ever heard of Tina Turner’s country album! Don’t remember my station having a copy of a single or an album by her. Nor do I recall hearing her played on any other country radio station around that time. Our playlist was tracked weekly by Billboard, Cashbox and Record World so we consistently had great service from all the country record labels in Nashville. Maybe if we had a copy we might have played it.\n\nFor the record my station did play “Fairytale” by the Pointer Sisters that same year. Their record label ABC/Blue Thumb sent us a promotional copy. I recall quite a few other country stations played that song too. Great tune."
