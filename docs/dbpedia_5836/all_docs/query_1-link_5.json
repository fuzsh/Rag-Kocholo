        "text": "Ike Turner (November 5, 1931 – December 12, 2007) was an American singer, songwriter and recording artist. He recorded many hit records, most of which were done with his wife Tina Turner. He was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, although he later moved to St. Louis, Missouri then to California.\n\nHe recorded “Rocket 88” a hit in 1951 for Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats. Brenston was Turner's saxophonist and the Delta Cats were actually Turner's Kings of Rhythm back-up band. Some people think this was the first rock and roll record.[1]\n\nHe died of an accidental cocaine overdose in San Diego."
