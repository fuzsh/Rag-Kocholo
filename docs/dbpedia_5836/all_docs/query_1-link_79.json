        "text": "The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture mourns the death of Tina Turner and celebrates her tremendous legacy with gratitude. Born Anna Mae Bullock Nov. 26, 1939, Turner grew up in the rural community of Nutbush, Tennessee, and moved to St. Louis at 16 years old. After seeing Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm perform in local nightclubs, she decided she would become their singer. That began a professional and personal relationship with Ike that would catapult her into the spotlight and ultimately shape her continued defiance and determination.\n\nTurner was introduced to the world with the 1960 single “A Fool in Love.” The Ike & Tuna Turner Revue toured the country with the band Kings of Rhythm and the singers The Ikettes, earning commercial and critical acclaim. Turner commanded every performance with her powerful voice and seemingly infinite energy. After a concert at the Apollo Theatre in 1965, the Apollo’s co-owner Frank Schiffman wrote, “The fastest paced act to show here….Tina moves like quicksilver….” The influence of her costumes and dance routines from that era can be seen in countless music videos and stage performances of the past few decades.\n\n“A sonic icon, Tina Turner’s innovations and influence span stage and screen, music and movies and every corner of pop culture,” said Kevin Young, the Andrew W. Mellon Director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. “She taught us about survival and joy, bravely speaking out about domestic violence and embodying Black resilience and artistry. Her unparalleled career and remarkable life inspires all, and her rich legacy continues to heavily influence modern times.”\n\nIke & Tina’s 1971 cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” transformed the song into a Grammy Award-winning soulful rock anthem. In the early ’70s, Turner began writing more, contributing nine of the 10 songs on their 1972 album, Feel Good. All the while, Turner was balancing her polished public persona with the private realities of the embattled, abusive relationship that was her marriage with Ike. After her first solo album, more music with Ike and success in film, Turner ended her relationship with Ike in 1976.\n\nIn the late ’70s, Turner returned to the road and headlined a series of concerts in Las Vegas. Throughout the late ’70s and early ’80s, Turner reinvented herself. In 1983, she signed with Capitol Records, and in 1984, she released Private Dancer, her most commercially successful album. The second single, “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” became Turner’s first and only Billboard No. 1 hit.\n\nTurner achieved unprecedented rock ’n’ roll superstardom in the ’80s. She repeatedly defied oppressive notions of genre, gender and race to become the Queen of Rock ’n’ Roll. Turner continued to release new music and tour throughout the ’80s and ’90s, also making further forays into acting. In 1999, she released her 10th and final solo album, Twenty-Four Seven. She was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor in 2005, performed with Beyoncé during the 2008 Grammy Awards and went back on the road for her 50th Anniversary Tour. Tina, the musical about her life, opened in 2018, and in 2021, she was featured in a documentary film. That same year she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for the second time."
