        "text": "Remembering Ike Turner\n\nFrom Entertainment Producer Denise Quan in Los Angeles:\n\nWe pulled up in front of a modest home in suburban San Diego. Newspaper in the driveway. No security gate.\n\n\"Are you sure this is the house?\" asked my cameraman, Rick.\n\nI checked my assignment sheet. \"Yup. According to my notes, this is where Ike lives.\"\n\nIke Turner. In April, we'd gone to interview the rock and soul icon about Phil Spector, on the eve of the music producer's trial for murder. We ended up talking about Ike's legendary career, his time in jail on drug charges and his physical altercations with Tina Turner -- his ex-wife and former partner. \"Yeah, I hit Tina,\" he admitted unapologetically. \"But Tina hit me, too. It was a different time back then.\" He likened it to spanking children.\n\nIke Turner was a complicated man. Yes, he had his demons, but he was also a proud man who took care with his appearance and wasn't afraid of hard work. His shirt was perfectly pressed. His hair was a glossy flat-top -- jet black and meticulously coiffed. He sang us a song he'd just written about how peace could occur if we all just loved each other a little more. And despite reports of emphysema, he was planning to tour early next year.\n\nIke was 75 at the time we interviewed him, and he still had an eye for the ladies. They kept coming out while we were at his house. There was a woman -- presumably an assistant and/or housekeeper -- who answered the door. There was an attractive singer he introduced as his latest protege. Then there was a third woman who offered us something to drink.\n\nMaybe it was because of his age, but you got the feeling he had come to terms with his life, and didn't have many regrets. Not even about the 17 months he spent in prison. He told us he loved being in jail -- that he had been treated well, and didn't have to worry about his bills or figuring out what to have for his next meal. Incarceration also helped him kick drugs, and for that, he was grateful.\n\nThe only subject that seemed to unnerve him was the state of his relationship with Tina. When asked how long it had been since he'd last spoken with her, he got up and said, \"That's the end of the interview.\"\n\nBut Ike Turner wasn't one to hold a grudge. In true Ike fashion, he grabbed an 8 x 10 glossy, autographed it, then promptly asked me out to dinner.\n\n-- Denise Quan"
