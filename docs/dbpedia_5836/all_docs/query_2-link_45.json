        "text": "Did you know in 2000 age 60 Tina Turner was the most successful concert artist!!\n\nAn American-born and naturalized Swiss singer. Known as the “Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll”, she rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue before launching a successful career as a solo performer. Turner began her career with Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm in 1957.\n\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock on November 26 1939 in Brownsville, Tennessee US.\n\nOn her official social page the news of her death was broken by the following statement.\n\n“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner. With her music and boundless passion for life, she enchanted fans worldwide and inspired future stars. We say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us her greatest work; her music. Tina, we will miss you dearly.”\n\nIke & Tina Turner the American musical duo consisting of husband and wife Ike Turner and Tina Turner. From 1960 to 1976, they performed live as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, supported by Ike Turner’s band the Kings of Rhythm and backing vocalists called the Ikettes. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was regarded as “one of the most potent live acts on the R&B circuit.\n\nProud Mary cover in 1971: Tina did not make any money from this song for decades. But it made the Ike & Tina Turner Revue into a household name. “Proud Mary” hit No. 4 on the Billboard pop chart and sold over 1 million copies. Winning the group its first and only Grammy as well.\n\nA Fool in Love: Released as a non-album track in April 1964.\n\nPrivate Dancer is the fifth solo studio album by Tina Turner. It was released on May 29, 1984, through Capitol Records and was her first album released through the label.\n\nAfter several challenging years of going solo after divorcing Ike Turner, Private Dancer propelled Turner into becoming a viable solo star, as well as one of the most marketable crossover singers in the recording industry. The 1984 multi-platinum album Private Dancer contained the hit song “What’s Love Got to Do with It”, which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became her first and only number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100. Aged 44, she was the oldest female solo artist to top the Hot 100. It became a worldwide commercial success, earning multi-platinum certifications, and remains her best-selling album in North America to date.\n\nWhat’s Love Got to Do with It, a biographical film adapted from her autobiography I, Tina: My Life Story, was released. In 2009, Turner retired after completing her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour, which is the 15th-highest-grossing tour of the 2000s. In 2018, she became the subject of the jukebox musical Tina.\n\nHaving sold over 100 million records worldwide, Turner is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. She received 12 Grammy Awards, which include eight competitive awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nShe was the first black artist and first woman to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone ranked her among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nTurner had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She was twice inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Ike Turner in 1991 and as a solo artist in 2021. She was also a 2005 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and Women of the Year award.\n\nTina Turner died on May 24, 2023, aged 83, following a long illness. #tinaturner"
