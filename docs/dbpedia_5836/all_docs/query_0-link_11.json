        "text": "Ike Turner's dead. He was a lot of things. Among them, he was a badass guitar player, piano player, producer, arranger, bandleader, songwriter, and a talent scout for Sam Phillips at Sun. He was also a bad motherfucker. Unfortunately, he'll probably be best remembered as a wife beating substance abuser. He probably wasn't a \"nice guy,\" but his contributions to American music are vast and deep. I remember reading an interview with him in an early issue of Spin, where when asked about Tina's suicide attempt, he tried to make light of the matter by saying (and I'll paraphrase this from memory) \"There's something you gotta understand about black folks, Tina tried to kill herself by jumping out of a first story window.\" Ike did eventually serve time in jail, get clean, and make a Grammy nominated comeback record.\n\nDownload: \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" mp3\n\nby Ike and Tina Turner, 1960.\n\n(and as pointed out in the comments that's\n\nMickey Baker not Ike answering Tina)\n\navailable on Golden Classics\n\nDownload: \"A Fool In Love\" mp3\n\nby Ike and Tina Turner, 1961.\n\navailable on Golden Classics\n\nDownload: \"Anything You Wasn't Born With\" mp3\n\nby Ike and Tina Turner, 1966.\n\nDownload: \"Dust My Broom\" mp3\n\nby Ike and Tina Turner, 1966.\n\navailable on The Soul Anthology\n\n****** BONUS ******\n\nDownload:\n\n\"You Keep On Worrying Me\" mp3\n\n\"You've Got To Lose\" mp3\n\nIke Turner & The Kings of Rhthym\n\nvocals by Jackie Brenston\n\nrecorded in St. Louis, 1958.\n\navailable on 1958-1959\n\n\"I'm Gonna Forget About You\" mp3\n\n\"Down and Out\" mp3\n\nIke Turner & The Kings of Rhthym\n\nvocals by Tommy Hodges\n\nrecorded in St. Louis, 1958.\n\navailable on 1958-1959\n\nAnd from the Club Imperial in St.Louis\n\nhear but not see Ike Turner & The Kings of Rhythm\n\nplaying for some jitterbuggers on local TV....\n\nFor the entire show, go to Bedazzled HERE\n\nIt's quite amazing. In between smoking performances\n\nby the Kings of Rhythm, fans of late night St. Louis\n\ntelevision can get a glimpse of Steve Mizerany selling\n\nNorge refrigerators before the toupee, roller skates\n\nand gorilla suits."
