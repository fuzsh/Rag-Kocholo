        "text": "A public-private partnership in Nigeria aims to increase access to sustainable renewable energy across the country.\n\nWith this purpose in mind, the government’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL).\n\nREA said the MoU signing is meant to boost collaboration between the private sector and government agencies “towards the deployment of sustainable renewable energy access across the country.”\n\nThis signing follows the recently held Solar Power Naija (SPN) investor matchmaking event.\n\n“As the agency continues to play a key role in the nation’s off-grid, renewable energy space, it has maintained a strong history of drawing in private sector investment, facilitating inter-sectorial collaboration and ultimately, aiding the implementation and delivery of fit-for-purpose off-grid solutions nationwide.\n\n“The REA-Oando collaboration marks the beginning of another timely and strategic partnership targeted at exploring new approaches to clean energy development for socio-economic impact in post-subsidy Nigeria.”\n\nHave you read?\n\nNigeria: project to turn waste into sustainable energy sources\n\nREA Managing Director Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad said one of the ways to mitigate the effects of subsidy removal in Nigeria is through “the exploitation of opportunities to optimise the critical role of renewable energy.”\n\nOando Clean Energy Limited president Dr Alex Irune said: “Oando is keen on renewable energy and excited for this opportunity to create value that the country needs.”\n\nPrivate sector encouraged to invest in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector\n\nHead of the Solar Power Naija Programme, Barbara Izilien said the REA continues to “deepen private sector engagements, targeted at drawing in funding, sustainably while expanding access across the nation.”\n\n“The intention for this collaboration is to encourage private sector investment to deploy sustainable renewable energy projects across the country.\n\nHave you read?\n\nNigeria: New finance vehicle looks to unlock renewable energy projects\n\n“We are trying to grow the funding of the Solar Power Naija to and this MoU signing will support the expansion targets of the REA in providing energy access to communities.”\n\nLast August, the Nigerian government launched its national Energy Transition Plan.\n\nTargets include generating 30,000MW of electricity from renewable energy sources and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060."
