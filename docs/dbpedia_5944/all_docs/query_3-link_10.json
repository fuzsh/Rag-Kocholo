The cleantech leadership is about #investments and #regulations, but equally about the acceleration of scientific and technological breakthroughs, #talent and #skills. What are the #innovations that will drive the market forward? What defines the Iberian DNA in #cleanenergy development, and what challenges must we overcome to massively advance new technologies? Join us tomorrow in #Madrid as we explore these questions and more at the Cleantech Innovation Collider—an open innovation conversation designed to bridge the gap between #industry, #investment, and #academia, co-organized with IE School of Science and Technology. 🎤 Featured Speakers: Investment: Natalia Ruiz Saez / Net Zero Ventures Research: David Gómez-Ullate Oteiza / IE School of Science and Technology Long duration energy storage : Michael Geyer / Malta Inc Recycling the un recyclable plastics: Carlos Monreal / Plastic Energy Deep Tech Acceleration and VC: Pol Hortal / Zubi Labs + Matteco 🎙 Moderated by: Ikhlaq Sidhu, Bianca Dragomir, Alberto Toril Castro You too can shape the future of #CleanTechInnovation in #Iberia: 👇\n\nRegional clusters of world-class innovation across the UK are being backed by a share of £75 million that will boost local economies and pioneer game-changing solutions from healthcare to net zero, UK Science Minister George Freeman announced on Monday. Following pilots in Liverpool and Teesside, launched earlier this year, a further 8 Launchpads, facilitated by Innovate UK, will be rolled out across every nation of the UK. These initiatives will build on existing clusters of high-tech innovation in each region, such as renewable energy in Southwest Wales, Agri-tech in East Anglia and digital health in Yorkshire. Launchpads is a programme that supports emerging clusters of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by providing each Launchpad up to £7.5 million from Innovate UK to fund innovation projects led by local businesses. The £7.5 million bespoke funding from each Launchpad will allow SMEs in each region to bid for support that is tailored to the unique needs of each business cluster, helping them drive innovation, expand operations, and boost their local economies.\n\nRegional clusters of world-class innovation across the UK are being backed by a share of £75 million that will boost local economies and pioneer game-changing solutions from healthcare to net zero, UK Science Minister George Freeman announced on Monday.
