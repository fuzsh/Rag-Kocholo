Computer can be used for virtually everything we humans can do and it makes life easy for us.\n\nComputer Aided Troubleshooting in automobile is the use of computer to help individuals or automobile engineers in detecting faults and providing them with the appropriate solution. This can only be achieved by building an expert system. One of the reasons for this research is to preserve the knowledge of a leading expert in the field of study after his death.\n\nAlso, this expert system will make junior workers rise to equal level with the engineers where there are no enough leading engineers.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nTITLE PAGE\n\nAPPROVAL PAGE\n\nDEDICATION\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVE/SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\n1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\n1.5 DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.1 LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n2.3 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF OANDO PETROLEUM PLC\n\n2.4 DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA OIL INDUSTRIES\n\n2.5NIGERIA GOVERNMENT INVOLUEMENT IN OIL INDUSTRY\n\n2.6 DETERMINATION OF OFFICIAL SELLING PRICE\n\n2.7 PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PETROLEUM PROJDUCT\n\n2.8 PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PROMOTION\n\n2.9 THE RISE OF INDEPENDENT MARKETER\n\n2.10 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE LAYOUT\n\n2.11 NATURE, PATTERN AND STRATEGY OF OIL\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.1 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n3.2 SAMPLE SIZE\n\n3.3 OANDO PETROLEUM RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER COMPANY\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.1 DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS\n\n5.2 RECOMMENDATION\n\n5.3 CONCLUSION\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe discovery of petroleum has taken place for about one hundred and fifty years ago, that was 1859 when the first underground oil was drilled in the United State in Titusville and Pennsylvania.\n\nPetroleum is different from other oils, because it is being manufactured from mineral source rather than animal and vegetable. The source from which petroleum comes from distinguish it from other kinds of oils, since it has been discovered as the valuable product in the world, there was modern technology on the consumerism of petroleum energy which made the product probably to become the most valuable.\n\nSince petroleum is the most widely used source of energy in the world due to the industrialization development and also because a nation blessed with petroleum is economically well positioned because the product is very significant in the nations development. Petroleum is very important and popular base on the fact that, it produces energy in the operation of machines for the use of mankind.\n\nThe oil product is used in lubricating most machines in different industries to have long lifespan and it is also used to powered most form of transportation, like ship, train aero plane etc.\n\nThe work of exploration and exploitation of petroleum involve geologist who discovered the oil exploitation to be a risky business. The first oil well was only sixty percent (60%) deep, under normal circumstances a well must be drilled before the possibility of a settlement of oil at a particular location can become certainty.\n\nThe techniques used in drilling oil well is cable tool which is still the same as the one used for the first oil well in the year 1959, mean while, after the oil must have been ascertained to be in a particular oil well, it is passed to the storage tanks to be refined and later for marketing.\n\n1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nPetroleum serves as form of natural product, but it could have not been discovered if not for the assistance of some geologists who worked on oil exploitation.\n\nMoreover, the marketing of petroleum products serve great advantage to the nation most especially the Nigerians, because this product could have been of no advantage a benefit to the poor people if not because it has been introduced into the market and to be marketing in the best possible way in which people can obtain it easily for their use.\n\n1.3OBJECTIVES/ SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objective is to find out the importance of marketing of petroleum, products in Ilorin depot and to also study why Oando petroleum as an independent marketer finding it some how difficult to get its allocation from NNPC depot in Ilorin to its final consumers.\n\nTo get some basic information on how people choose to buy Oando petroleum product.\n\nOne have to analyze and conclude on the marketing of Oando petroleum product in Ilorin and also to find out why Oando petroleum have the largest market share in Ilorin town and factors responsible for it.\n\nThe choice of the topic marketing of petroleum product as a case study of Oando petroleum Ilorin depot, have made it from their major objective.\n\n1) To make this project is also significant to the oil company in the sense that apart from Oando petroleum, other oils companies such as National oil, Chevron, Exton Scan also find the research useful in their business.\n\n2) The study is also significant in the sense that Oando petroleum may find the findings recommendations and suggestions made in the study useful in its future operation.\n\n3) This project is also significant in the sense that it highlights the implementation process of attaining high standard of living of marketing of petroleum product. In Nigeria and how government implements could be removed by the process of marketing research which will generally lead to high standard of petroleum product and thus result to the growth of the Nigeria’s oil industry which is basically the backbone of Nigerian economy.\n\n4) To pursue my academic alternative that is in partial fulfillment for the Award of Higher National Diploma in Purchasing and supply.\n\n1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nFor the purpose of accuracy and easy collection of data, this research is restricted to the operations of Oando petroleum Ilorin Depot.\n\nThe study course the concepts of marketing of petroleum product in Ilorin, concerted efforts are made on the study concerning the marketing of Oando petroleum within Ilorin in order to know all their activities and operations also to study how they market their product and equally know their location.\n\nAlso, the intentions of the product critically examine, analyze and appraise the operation fat Oando petroleum PLC, Ilorin depot, with the view to generating an oil product marketing in Ilorin and their contribution towards the development of Ilorin town.\n\nFurthermore, the project will be of immense important to petroleum product marketers and the generality.\n\nLIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nOne of the major limitations of the study is collection of primary data such as Observation, interview and questionnaire as an instrument of concrete records. The other includes validity of secondary data which were used in the writing of the research project. The manual analysis of data collection for the research project is another limitation concerning marketing of petroleum product In Nigeria.\n\n1.5 DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS\n\nMarketing: Human activities directed toward satisfaction and want through exchange process.\n\nMarket: The set of all activities and potential buyers of product and services.\n\nProduct: Is a set of tangible and intangible attributes including packaging, colour, size, price manufactures and retailers which the buyer may accept as offering want satisfaction.\n\nIndustrial goods: These are goods meant for the further production and reselling services.\n\nConsumer Goods: These are goods that are made specially for final consumer.\n\nMarketing Strategy: This means the regenerating of company in terms of its product life cycle, the promotion strategy for any product that are influenced by product life cycle.\n\nMarketing research: The systematic problem analysis model building and fact finding for the purposes of completing the research."
