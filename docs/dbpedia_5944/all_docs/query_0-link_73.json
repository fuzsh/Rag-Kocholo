For years, the country has been using fairly used cars otherwise known as Tokunbo, and Oando has lubricants for people driving such cars,” she said. “In recent times, there has been a paradigm shift from the use of Tokunbo to new cars. Nigerians are now driving new and highly sophisticated vehicles, and the only way to satisfy people in that segment was to produce synthetic lubricant.” She said every litre of Oleum SYN is formulated with high quality base oils and additives and that the product meets international standards. “A log of research was conducted by Oando Marketing  in order to produce a wide range of lubricants.
