        "text": "FuelCell Energy and Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL), the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando Energy Resources (OER), have collaborated to develop a 5 to 15 MW power plant to help strengthen electricity access in Nigeria through low-carbon renewable energy sources.\n\nA memorandum of understanding will allow the companies to utilize FuelCell Energy’s fuel cell, electrolyzer, and carbon capture and sequestration technologies.\n\nWhile FuelCell Energy's platforms are helping utilities and independent power producers transition to net zero, they are also improving grid reliability with zero particulate matter emissions. The platforms also help improve grid resiliency by adding a reliable source of on-site power generation.\n\n“The opportunity to bring our technology to Nigeria is a critical moment for FuelCell Energy,” said Jason Few, CEO and President of FuelCell Energy. “Nigeria has an abundance of renewable energy sources that can be harnessed with the power of fuel cell technology. We are proud to have the opportunity to collaborate with OCEL to deliver stable electricity supply, better grid reliability, and security while contributing to Nigeria’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2060.”\n\nAround 84% of urban households in Nigeria use backup power supply systems such as diesel or gasoline generators and/or solar-based systems, while about 86% of the companies in Nigeria own or share a generator. Additionally, there is a shortage of access to power, and as a result, 85 million Nigerians remain unconnected to the national grid.\n\nThe Nigerian Federal Government’s Renewable Energy Master Plan hopes to increase the share of renewable electricity to 23% in 2025 and 30% by 2030 from 13% of total electricity generation in 2015.\n\n“The increased awareness and acceptance of renewable energy as a sustainable and long-term approach to the world’s power needs has led to lower prices and increased innovative and more accessible solutions, including FuelCell Energy’s solutions. Their technology gives us confidence that we have chosen a good partner to help Nigerians access reliable, low-carbon energy. Beyond access to power, this collaboration is in tandem with OCEL’s overarching strategy of building a clean energy ecosystem whilst supporting the Federal Government’s vision of net zero emissions by 2060,\" said OCEL Chairman Adewale Tinubu.\n\nNigeria has also passed the Climate Change Act to lower greenhouse gas emissions and implement a supporting framework to meet the country’s target of net zero emissions by 2060."
