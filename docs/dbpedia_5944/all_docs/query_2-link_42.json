        "text": "<strong>Oando</strong>news A Quarterly In-house Journal of <strong>Oando</strong> Group Apr - Jun, 2009. Quarter 2 <strong>Oando</strong> <strong>Energy</strong> <strong>Services</strong>, a subsidiary of <strong>Oando</strong> <strong>PLC</strong> - Nigeria’s leading integrated energy solutions provider, has emerged Nigeria’s largest indigenous drilling contractor with <strong>Oando</strong>’s acquisition of two inland barge rigs from Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) for an estimated USD 43.5 million inclusive of VAT. This latest acquisition brings to five, the total number of rigs in <strong>Oando</strong>’s fleet and clearly reinforces the company’s position as the leading beacon in the oilfield services sector of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. Commenting on the acquisition, Mr. Uche Dimiri, Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Oando</strong> <strong>Energy</strong> <strong>Services</strong>, said: “The Niger Delta swamps contain abundant reserves that are crucial to Nigeria achieving its plan to increase production levels to 4 million barrels per day by 2010. The understanding that there must be increased drilling activity across all stages of oil exploitation, from exploration to development, for the government’s targets to be realised forms the basis of our continued investments in swamp drilling rigs. The cantilever capability of Rig 2 (formerly Parker rig 75) is unique in Nigeria. This feature enables Rig 2 to drill multiple well slots while remaining at the same client location, thus optimising reservoir drainage while reducing the overall cost of well construction. We intend to combine this uniqueness with our superior community relations expertise to deliver not only significant cost savings but other operational efficiencies to our customers. An added feature of Rig 1 is its 3,000 horsepower rating which gives <strong>Oando</strong> the flexibility to upgrade it to a High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) rig. This conversion will increase to two the number of such rigs in-country for exploiting reservoirs with such peculiarity.” <strong>Oando</strong> <strong>Energy</strong> <strong>Services</strong> <strong>Emerges</strong> Nigeria’s <strong>Largest</strong> Indigenous Drilling <strong>Services</strong> Provider • Rigs in fleet now five • Investment in energy services now $250 million Searex VI now OES Respect Searex XII now OES Teamwork Constitution now OES Integrity Content <strong>Oando</strong> Signs AGIP Agreement - Pg. 2 “Rig 2 was acquired together with an existing contract whilst Rig 1 (formerly Parker 73) is scheduled to proceed to the shipyard where it will undergo life enhancement and upgrade prior to its deployment in 2010.” Mr. Dimiri added. Mr. Wale Tinubu Group Chief Executive said, “This latest acquisition boosts our investment to approximately $250 million out of the $500 million five-year development plan announced prior. With a further resolve to increase our rig fleet in the near future, we are positioning <strong>Oando</strong> as the partner of choice for worldclass land and swamp oil field services. By the purchase of an asset already in contract, we expedite value extraction for our shareholders, whilst guaranteeing significant and steady long term revenue for the group.” Parker 73 now OES Passion Parker 75 now OES Professionalism <strong>Oando</strong> Sponsors Business Day CEO Forum - Pg. 3 <strong>Oando</strong> Sponsors First South-South Economic Summit - Pg. 5 OG & P Celebrates Childrens Day - Pg. 5 Photo News -Pg. 6 - 7 <strong>Oando</strong> at the 2009 OTC Conference - Pg. 8 <strong>Oando</strong> Sponsors Ohada Conference - Pg. 9 Corporate Governance / CSR - Pg. 10 Social Diary - Pg. 11 <strong>Oando</strong>News"
