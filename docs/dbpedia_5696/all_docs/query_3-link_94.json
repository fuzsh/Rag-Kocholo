Brilliant Minds stars Zachary Quinto as an intelligent specialist looking to connect with his patents while St. Denis Medical has Wendi McLendon-Covey leading the charge in the mockumentary.\n\nFall 2024 TV Schedule: See When NBC’s ‘Happy’s Place,’ ABC’s ‘9-1-1’ and More Shows Return\n\nKeep scrolling for a guide to each medical show to keep an eye out for:\n\n'Brilliant Minds' (NBC)\n\nBased on Oliver Sacks' books The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and An Anthropologist on Mars, Brilliant Minds premieres on September 23 and centers around an eccentric yet gifted neurologist played by Quinto. His character, Dr. Oliver Wolf, is determined to get inside the minds of his patients to understand their treatment needs.\n\n'Doctor Odyssey' (ABC)\n\nMurphy is growing his TV empire with ABC's procedural Doctor Odyssey, which premieres on September 26.
