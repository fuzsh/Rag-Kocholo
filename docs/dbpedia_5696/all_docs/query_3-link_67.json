        "text": "It’s all made Rhimes one of the highest-paid showrunners in TV, with Forbes estimating her net worth at US$135 million.\n\nFrom buying the Grey’s Anatomy cast holidays to snapping up properties around Los Angeles, here’s how Rhimes spends her millions.\n\nHow did she make her fortune?\n\nRhimes didn’t always see herself working in TV. As a kid, she dreamt of being a novelist. That all changed after she saw Whoopi Goldberg on Broadway.\n\nShe earned her MFA in film at the University of Southern California, where she discovered a “new way of storytelling,” she said, and worked as an assistant on several film projects.\n\nHer TV career launched in 2003 when ABC picked up Grey’s Anatomy, which garnered 20 million viewers by the end of its first season. It made Rhimes the first black woman showrunner of a successful prime time drama on a broadcast network.\n\nScandal followed, premiering in 2012 and raking in roughly US$100 million per season in ad revenue at its peak. Then came How to Get Away with Murder in 2014.\n\nIn between those years, Rhimes’ production company also debuted shorter-lived series like The Catch, For the People and Grey’s Anatomy spin-off Private Practice, all of which aired on ABC. Rhimes became the woman who “owns Thursday night television”, earning impressive fees for each episode produced, according to Forbes.\n\nShe also took home 10 per cent of the profits when Grey’s, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder and Private Practice were syndicated or sold to streaming services at US$1 million per episode. By 2017, Shondaland had generated US$2 billion in revenue from advertising, rerun sales and international licensing.\n\nBoosting all of that was Rhimes’ base salary. In 2014, she signed a new four-year deal with ABC that earned her US$10 million per year. But that paled in comparison to the four-year deal she signed with Netflix in 2017, estimated at US$150 million. She was one of the first showrunners to sign a deal with the streaming service.\n\nThe deal allowed Rhimes to keep working on her ABC series without the US$10 million per year, while enjoying new liberties to produce films, series or miniseries at Netflix.\n\nTwo days after the premiere of her first Netflix show, period drama series Bridgerton, it was holding the No 2 spot on the platform’s most-watched list.\n\nIn recent years, Rhimes has ventured into other forms of media, too. In 2015, she published the memoir Year of Yes, which became a New York Times bestseller. At the time it was announced, Rhimes joked in a press statement, “Simon & Schuster is crazy for giving me a book deal, as I am clearly in no position to be handing out wisdom.”\n\nDetails about the value of the book deal, including any advance Rhimes might have been paid by the publisher, were not made publicly available.\n\nIn September 2017, she partnered with Hearst to launch lifestyle website Shondaland.com. And in 2019, she partnered with iHeartMedia in a three-year podcast deal to launch Shondaland Audio.\n\nAt Elle magazine’s 2018 Women in Hollywood celebration, Rhimes stated that she was the highest-paid showrunner in Hollywood, but an April 2019 Observer ranking put her at No 4 behind Greg Berlanti, Ryan Murphy and Mike Schur. Regardless, Rhimes is clearly pocketing some of TV’s biggest pay cheques.\n\nAnd how does she spend it?\n\nBut Rhimes still has several residences in the area, like the 1920s Spanish-style duplex she bought in 2007 for US$1.66 million and the English country manor house she bought in 2017 for US$4.6 million. She also has the 8,400 sq ft Elmer Grey-designed mansion that she dropped US$8.8 million on in 2014.\n\nRhimes may have a thing for LA real estate, but she expanded her portfolio to the East Coast in 2018 when she bought an $11.75 million two-bedroom penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side.\n\nRhimes also spends on beauty and wellness. She wrote in her 2015 memoir that she hired a personal trainer to help her lose 100 pounds (45kg). She also has a “clothing therapist”, Asher Levine, who is known for dressing top female Hollywood execs.\n\nBut she’s previously said her happy place is with her three daughters. She adopted Harper and Emerson in 2002 and 2012, respectively, and had Beckett in 2013 via a surrogate.\n\nRhimes is also a philanthropist. In 2016, she established the Rhimes Family Foundation to support arts, education and activism. It emphasises cultural inclusion and equality. Through the foundation, Rhimes has given at least US$10 million in grants to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and at least US$1 million to the Obama Foundation.\n\nIn 2017, Rhimes became a patron of the arts for IAMA Theatre Company. The amount of the endowment, provided by the Rhimes Family Foundation, was not disclosed.\n\nShe’s also a generous boss. Rhimes once bought everyone in the Grey’s Anatomy cast and crew a holiday to a luxury resort as a gift for the show’s 350th episode, Grey’s actor Kevin McKidd revealed in a Live with Kelly and Ryan interview in November 2019.\n\nBut she’s not one for holiday herself. In 2016, she ditched her first three-week holiday in 10 years to film a short video for Hillary Clinton during her election campaign.\n\nWhile Rhimes has a few splurges, they’re not atypical from any other celebrity. Her less than lavish lifestyle might be due to her humble upbringing.\n\n“When I was a struggling graduate student in film school, I often had no money,” she said in a commencement speech at Dartmouth, her undergrad alma mater. “And so I often had to choose between wine and things like toilet paper. Steak did not even enter into the equation.”"
