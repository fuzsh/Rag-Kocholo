Baker received his MD in 1944, and then joined the U.S. Navy, where he served shipboard, in shore-based hospitals and at naval-air bases. After he was discharged from the service, he enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley where he earned a master's degree in biochemistry. Baker joined the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1949 where he carried out research on cholesterol and amino acid metabolism in the Laboratory of Biochemistry. He had to leave laboratory research behind in 1951, when he developed asthma as a result of an allergy to rat dander. Baker then launched his administrative career as assistant to the Associate Director of NIH. He next took a position in the Research Grants Branch of NCI. Baker left the NCI for the Office of the Associate Director for NIH Intramural Research. He returned to the NCI in 1958, as Assistant Director and (1960 to 1961) as acting scientific director. He was appointed Scientific Director for Cancer Etiology in 1967. Baker was named Acting Director of the NCI in 1969, rising to full director in July 1970. This coincided with President Nixon's declaration of \"war on cancer.\" Baker profited from a clear image of the direction NCI should proceed and provided guidance for Congress, shaping legislation aimed at implementing the increased effort on cancer research. Over his tenure, the NCI budget doubled from $181 million to $378 million (1970s dollars). He concurrently held the rank of Rear Admiral in the Public Health Service.

He was a cardiologist that went into medical informatics. Founder and former Senior Scientific Director of the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and was recognised world-wide as one of the founding fathers of Medical Informatics who pioneered the use of computers in patient care. In 1964, Dr. Barnett was recruited by MGH to head the Hospital Computer Project, an ambitious plan to implement a large hospital information system. From this project, the Laboratory of Computer Science was born. Although he described himself humbly as just a country doctor, Dr. Barnett altered the course of the practice of medicine when he suggested, in the 1950s, We ought to try using time sharing computer systems to improve medical care. He was co-developer of COSTAR, one of the nations first computerized electronic health records, and of DXplain, one of the best known, widely used diagnostic decision support systems. The programming language known as Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi- Programming System (MUMPS), which remains in widespread use today as the foundation of numerous clinical systems, was invented in LCS under his leadership.

This collaborative project was conceived of by Dr Nicole Lurie, Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response (ASPR). HMD historian Sheena Morrison was embedded into weekly ASPR stand-up meetings to record meeting activities and collect ancillary public relations material. She later interviewed Federal employees from lead agencies engaged in the response efforts to record their thoughts and positions on policy issues, deliberations, and actions taken to protect the public's health. Another purpose of the oral histories was to provide a future knowledge base; if the country again faces the threat of influenza or other pandemics, it is likely that an in-depth knowledge of the lessons learned from the H1N1 response efforts will prove relevant.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nAccession #:\n\n2010-004\n\nName of Collection:\n\nHalsted Society.

Mutual Chemical Company of America operated a chrome manufacturing plant in Jersey City, New Jersey from 1895 to 1954. During that time, the company deposited approximately 1.5 million tons of industrial waste residue containing hexavalent chromium into wetlands along the Hackensack River. In 1954, Allied Corporation purchased the plant and ended the dumping. Allied Corporation was succeeded by Allied Signal, Inc., and later by Honeywell International. Although the dumping stopped, the contaminated area was not cleaned up. In 1995, the Interfaith Community Organization and five residents of the nearby community collectively, \"ICO\"), represented by the Washington, D.C. law firm of Terris, Pravlik and Millian, LLP, filed the original suit against Allied Signal, then the owner of the site, seeking the cleanup of a contaminated area designated \"Study Area 7.\" ICO sued Allied Signal under the citizen suit provision of RCRA, which allows individuals to bring a civil action against any person \"who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the\n\nReturn to Top\n\nAccession #:\n\n2001-158\n\nName of Collection:\n\nInternational Librarianship\n\nDates:\n\nQuantity:\n\n.10 lin. ft.

(26 record cartons)\n\nRestrictions:\n\nContents:\n\n[Wikipedia] Robert Steven Ledley (born 28 June 1924) pioneered the use of digital electronic computers in biology and medicine. In 1959 he wrote two influential articles in the journal Science: \"Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis\" (with Lee B. Lusted) and \"Digital Electronic Computers in Biomedical Science\". Both articles encouraged biomedical researchers and physicians to adopt computer technology. In 1960 he established the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF), a non-profit research organization dedicated to promoting the use of computers and electronic equipment in biomedical research. At the NBRF Ledley pursued several major projects: the early 1960s development of the Film Input to Digital Automatic Computer (FIDAC), which automated the analysis of chromosomes; the creation in 1965 of the Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (edited by Margaret O. Dayhoff); the invention of the Automatic Computerized Transverse Axial (ACTA) whole-body CT scanner in the mid 1970s; and the establishment of the Protein Information Resource in 1984. Ledley also served as editor of several major peer-reviewed biomedical journals. In 1990, Ledley was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nAccession #:\n\n2008-058\n\nName of Collection:\n\nLedley, Robert S./National Biomedical Research Foundation.
