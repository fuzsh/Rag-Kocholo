        "text": "Private Practice is a spin-off of the television series, Grey's Anatomy. The series ran for 6 seasons from September 2007 to January 2013. The show was broadcast on ABC, the same network that broadcasts Grey's Anatomy.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe series focuses on Dr. Addison Montgomery, who relocates from Seattle to Los Angeles, needing a big change in her life. In Los Angeles, Addison joins the private practice of her friends Naomi, a fertility specialist and endocrinologist, and Sam Bennett, an internist and cardiothoracic surgeon.\n\nAt the practice, Addison also gets to work together with psychiatrist Violet Turner, pediatrician Cooper Freedman, alternative medicine and infectious diseases specialist Pete Wilder, and receptionist and trainee midwife Dell Parker. All staff members of the practice have privileges at the local St. Ambrose Hospital, where Charlotte King is Chief of Staff, Urologist, and eventually Sexologist at the practice.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, Addison continues to help pregnant women while looking for love and a child of her own.\n\nProduction[]\n\nCreated by Shonda Rhimes, the series chronicles the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery as she leaves Seattle Grace Hospital for Los Angeles in order to join a private practice.\n\nRhimes also serves as executive producer alongside Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Mark Tinker and Marti Noxon; the latter serving as showrunner for the first season only in lieu of Rhimes' duties on Grey's Anatomy.

However, unlike Grey's Anatomy, the third and fifth season have had two-hour mid-season finales: The Parent Trap and Blowups served as the third season's mid-season finale, while Who We Are and The Breaking Point served as the fifth season's mid-season finale. These two two-hour events are Private Practice's only two-hour episodes, whereas Grey's Anatomy has had many more.\n\nOn her YouTube page, Kate Walsh made vlogs answering questions from fans about the show.[source?]\n\nIt is sometimes called PPP which stands for Private Practice Program.[source?]\n\nThere is no season of the show where all the main characters appear in all episodes.\n\nAccording to Caterina Scorsone and Betsy Beers, the show's set was one of the best and most relaxed sets ever, with everyone always happy and cuddling and massaging each other. This sentiment has been echoed multiple times by other cast members on social media throughout the years.[source?]\n\nIn 2020, many members of the cast (Kate Walsh, KaDee Strickland, Paul Adelstein, Caterina Scorsone, Audra McDonald, and Brian Benben), plus crew member Sergio Lopez-Rivera appeared on Amy Brenneman's podcast, The Challengers to support No Kid Hungry and discuss the impact of COVID-19.[source?]\n\nReferences[]"
