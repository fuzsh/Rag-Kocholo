        "meta_description": "Beyoncé - Bey is not one to lash out, speak out or act out, but if you cross her, she will most certainly shut you out. That's effectively what she did to the media these past couple of years. After her 2013 GQ cover story was met with some backlash (the writer painted her as something of a controlling egomaniac), the pop icon went radio silent in the press, opting instead to communicate with her fans directly through social media. The fact that Bey is the most intriguing woman in the world without speaking to the media in two years is a feat only she could accomplish. Sometimes no response is the best response!
