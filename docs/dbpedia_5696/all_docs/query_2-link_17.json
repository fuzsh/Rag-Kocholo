        "text": "Native Americans who lived in the Los Angeles area and the Southern Channel Islands (including Santa Catalina Island) spoke a language distinct from their neighbors to the North and South of them. They have come to be known as the Gabrielino, because many of those who survived European diseases and the disruption on their normal trade patterns and culture went to the Mission San Gabriel in Los Angeles, some forcibly and some willingly. The most recent radiocarbon dating indicates human habitation of the Island for approximately 7,000 years before present. Other Channel Islands have found even earlier dates.\n\nThe Native Americans who lived here at the time the Spanish found them called Catalina Island “Pemú’nga” (most current spelling based on linguistic research of scholars; there are no fluent speakers of the Gabrielino language). We’re not sure when the last native Gabrielino went to the missions, but the missions’ baptismal records show Islander baptisms until the 1820s. Today one mainland group of Gabrielino ancestry, located in the San Gabriel area, calls themselves “Gabrielino/Tongva.” The United States government has not yet formally recognized any of the Gabrielino groups.\n\nLearn more about the Indians\n\nLearn about Catalina Island History\n\nThe Gabrielino Indians lived on Catalina Island for over 7,000 years. When Cabrillo discovered the island in 1542, it was claimed by the king of Spain. Mexican ownership dates from 1821, when Mexico achieved its independence from Spain. In 1846, Governor Pio Pico of Mexican California granted Catalina Island to a private citizen, Tomas Robbins, who owned it until 1850. In that year, he sold Catalina to Jose Maria Covarrubias for $10,000.\n\nCovarrubias sold the island to Albert Packard of San Francisco in 1853. The Island then went through a complex phase of ownership changes and divisions until it was acquired by James Lick in 1864. By 1867, Lick had entire ownership of the Island. In 1887, George Shatto bought the entire Island for $200,000 from the Lick Estate (Lick died in 1876), but lost the island due to debt and foreclosure.\n\nThe Lick Estate then sold the island to William Banning in 1892 for $128,740. The Bannings established the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1896 and transferred ownership of the Island to the Company that year. After a devastating fire that burned a quarter of Avalon in 1915, the Bannings faced financial difficulties and sold the Island Company to William Wrigley, Jr. of Chicago Cubs and chewing gum fame.\n\nThis now-historic event cast the die for permanently preserving substantially all of Santa Catalina Island in its natural state. During the next 56 years, various conservation practices were initiated by the Wrigley-led Santa Catalina Island Company, including much-needed animal controls, protection of watersheds and reseeding of overgrazed areas.\n\nThroughout the term of the Wrigley family stewardship, the interest in conservation increased. In 1972, members of the Wrigley family established the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy as a nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation and preservation of Santa Catalina Island. On February 15, 1975, the final step was taken to ensure the protection of the majority of Santa Catalina Island when Mr. and Mrs. Philip K. Wrigley and Mrs. Dorothy Wrigley Offield, through the Santa Catalina Island Company, deeded 42,135 acres of the Island to the Conservancy. With this gift, the conservation and preservation of most of Catalina’s interior and 48 miles of its coastline were given permanent status in perpetuity. Prior to this, in 1974, the Santa Catalina Island Company entered into a 50-year open space agreement with Los Angeles County, guaranteeing public recreational and educational use of 41,000 acres of Santa Catalina Island, consistent with good land conservation practices. When the Conservancy received land title to most of the Island a year later, it took over the responsibility for the County easement of 41,000 acres of the Conservancy’s 42,135 acres.\n\nCatalina Island Museum\n\nCatalina Island Conservancy\n\nThe island where the Native American woman lived alone for 18 years (after the rest of her people were taken by boat to the mainland) was San Nicolas Island. The book Island of the Blue Dolphins was written by Scott O’Dell. The true story on which he based his book tells of the “Lone Woman of San Nicolas.” Because of the island Indians’ repeated confrontations with sea otter hunters, mission padres on the mainland feared for the Indians’ safety and in 1835 sent a schooner to evacuate the island. As they were loading the ship, one woman realized her child had been left behind in the village and hurried off to find it. With strong winds rising, the ship had to sail away, leaving the woman behind. Wild dogs apparently had killed her child and the ship could not go back for her. She stayed alone on the island until a hunter, George Nidever, discovered her. He brought her home to live with him and his wife in Santa Barbara, but she died less than two months later of dysentery. (Information from Jan Timbrook, “The Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island,” Bulletin of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, no. 155 (November 1991.)\n\nLearn about Channel Islands\n\nFenced in by ocean and free of large predators, Santa Catalina Island attracted enterprising ranchers who hoped to make money raising sheep and cattle for wool, mutton, hides, and beef. Tomas Robbins, an American who became a naturalized Mexican citizen, established the first ranch on Santa Catalina island in 1846 when he received the Island as a land grant from Mexican governor Pio Pico. Four years later, he sold the Island to Jose Maria Covarrubius, first in a series of absentee owners. Squatters soon settled in various coves that still bear their names. Most of them raised sheep, which reportedly numbered more than 20,000 by 1864. When James Lick acquired the Island in 1867, he evicted all but three of the squatters, who were granted leases to run sheep and cattle. From 1915-1923 the Mauer Cattle Company leased grazing rights from the Santa Catalina Island Company (formed in 1894). When its lease expired, the Santa Catalina Island Company took over ranching operations, maintaining several thousand head of cattle until the 1950s. Today, no sheep or cattle remain on the Island.\n\nPhineas Banning, a prominent stage coach line operator based in the Los Angeles area, began operating a regular steamship between the Island and the mainland in the mid 1800s. By the early 1880s, the Banning family saw another opportunity as the Island started to attract visitors and residents. In 1884, they established the Wilmington Transportation Company, which oversaw a series of ships making the run to the Island. When George Shatto ran into financial troubles, the Bannings purchased the Island from him in 1892, increased their fleet of ships, and spurred on the Island’s fledgling tourist industry.\n\nThe Bannings built the island’s first substantial infrastructure, providing water, electricity, waste disposal, and communications services, building good roads, and installing law enforcement and fire protection services. During the period they owned the island, from 1892 to 1919, visitor attractions on the Island also expanded exponentially to include a dance pavilion, golf course, tennis courts, an incline railway, Greek amphitheater, and aquarium. Tourists could enjoy the music of the Porters Catalina Island Marine Band, hunt and fish, watch fireworks, take stagecoach rides, and view the wonders of the sea through the floors of glass-bottomed boats. George S. Patton, Jr., destined to become famous as a general during World War II, spent his summers at a family home on the Island during this time."
