        "text": "Is Cafe Tavolini still open?\n\nCafe Tavolini Update - What Happened Next?\n\nNow that we’ve recapped the Kitchen Nightmares Tavolini episode, let’s talk about what happened to the restaurant after Gordon Ramsay and his crew left Bridgeport, CT.\n\nUnfortunately, Cafe Tavolini has a very sad ending.\n\nKeith and Lisa separated soon after filming and the restaurant really had no chance.\n\nThe restaurant closed for good in December, 2011.\n\nBeyond the marital troubles, it seems the main reason for the closure is that Cafe Tavolini’s debt bill had just grown too large.\n\nWith such a large debt to start with, I don’t think Gordon really had any chance with this restaurant.\n\nSome of the staff, notably Chef Michael Sirico, moved on to B Line Bar & Grill.\n\nThere was some additional drama with the closure as some customers had purchased gift certificates that would no longer be honored after Cafe Tavolini closed.\n\nThese issues led to a Connecticut Attorney General investigation.\n\nI’m not sure what happened, but Keith Restivo (the owner) said that they would reimburse customers for the gift card amounts if they were unable to reopen Cafe Tavolini.\n\nGiven that Cafe Tavolini remained closed, I hope that people were able to get their money back.\n\nYou can read about this event in this article from the Connecticut Post.\n\nIs Cafe Tavolini still open after Kitchen Nightmares?\n\nCafe Tavolini closed in December 2011, which was just six months after the Cafe Tavolini Kitchen Nightmares episode aired on TV.\n\nAs of 2023, the old Cafe Tavolini Bridgeport, CT location is now occupied by a new restaurant called Bryac Restaurant and Raw Bar, which focuses on seafood dishes.\n\nReviews for the new Bryac Restaurant seem pretty good as it has a 4 star rating on its Yelp page, as well as a 4 star rating on TripAdvisor.\n\nHere’s what the old Cafe Tavolini Connecticut location looks like in the most recent picture from Google Maps street view:\n\nWhat happened to Van from Cafe Tavolini?\n\nVan Restivo was the son of Keith and Lisa Restivo, the Cafe Tavolini owners.\n\nUnfortunately, Van doesn’t really have an online presence so I’m not sure what happened to him after the Tavolini Kitchen Nightmares episode.\n\nWhat happened to Lisa Restivo from Cafe Tavolini?\n\nAfter Cafe Tavolini, Lisa opened a consignment shop in the Black Rock neighborhood of Bridgeport, CT.\n\nThe shop was named Bella Collections and she opened it with her friend Bonnie.\n\nSadly, the shop had to close around a year after it opened.\n\nYou can see a post about it on Patch.com.\n\nI’m not sure what she’s been up to since then – I hope she’s doing well!\n\nWhat happened to Keith Restivo from Cafe Tavolini?\n\nKeith Restivo, one of the former Cafe Tavolini owners, is living in Norwalk, CT.\n\nHe’s listed as the owner for New England Spirits, Inc, so it appears like he owns a liquor store in Norwalk.\n\nI believe the exact name of the shop is Warehouse Wines & Spirits.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Kitchen Nightmares Cafe Tavolini episode\n\nOverall, Cafe Tavolini was not a Kitchen Nightmares success, as it closed just around six months after the episode aired on TV.\n\nAs of 2023, the old Cafe Tavolini Bridgeport CT location is occupied by a new seafood restaurant named Bryac.\n\nAfter Cafe Tavolini closed, Lisa opened a consignment shop with a friend, but that also closed around a year later.\n\nKeith is listed as the owner of a liquor store, so it appears that he’s gone back to his original occupation.\n\nI’m not sure what happened to Van from Cafe Tavolini, but I hope he’s doing well.\n\nIf you want to see another Kitchen Nightmares Connecticut episode, you can also check out my Sabatiello’s update in Stamford CT.\n\nOther nearby restaurants include Fiesta Sunrise in West Nyack NY, Handlebar in Mount Sinai NY (Long Island), and The Olde Stone Mill Steakhouse in Tuckahoe NY.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nMore Information\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-tavolini-bridgeport\n\nWhat did you think about the episode?
