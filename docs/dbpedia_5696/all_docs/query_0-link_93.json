It is expected Mohamed Fahmy will be deported to Canada; Baher Mohamed has only Egyptian nationality. “Peter’s integrity is not just intact, but has been further enhanced by the fortitude and sacrifice he has shown for his profession of informing the public,” saidMostefa Souag, acting director general of Al Jazeera Media Network. “We will not rest until Baher and Mohamed also regain their freedom.”\n\nComcast and Time Warner Cable agreed to a six-month extension to the end date of their merger agreement. The companies informed the SEC their new timeline gives them until August 12, 2015 to complete the deal, first announced in February 2014.\n\nHBO grabbed U.S. rights to 3½ Minutes, a documentary about the 2012 Florida shooting death of black teen Jordan Davis. The film from director Marc Silver will have its TV premiere in the fall, following a theatrical release.\n\nIt’s official: Almost half (47 percent) of people watching the Super Bowl are just there for the ads, according to Horizon Media’s Finger on the Pulse survey. “It’s clear support for why advertisers continue to make big investments in the Super Bowl,\" said Kirk Olson, VP of TrendSights at Horizon. \"On top of the enormous reach, Americans still very much believe in the event as a sports and advertising tradition.”\n\nSo what did you think of this year’s Super Bowl ads?
