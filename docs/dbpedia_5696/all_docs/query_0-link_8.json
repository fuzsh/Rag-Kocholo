        "text": "It all started with an accomplished lawyer. And a death. And a secret. Okay — make that a lot of deaths and secrets. As fans of How to Get Away With Murder can attest, summing up the series’ twists and turns is no small task. (However, if you need a refresher we’ve got you covered.) But we can say this: over its six-season run, HTGAWM, as its affectionately abbreviated across social media, has defined itself in many ways. It's been a twisty, turny, tension-fueld ride that, with every well-timed flashback, has kept our attention as we figured out just who in Annalise Keating's band of young attorneys is guilty of what. The show hasn't shied away from tackling heavy issues like criminal justice reform, systematic racism of police brutality, and mental health issues. And, it must be said, it's offered one hell of a vehicle for Viola Davis to deliver incredible performance after performances as Keating with all her many flaws, complications, and motivations.\n\nSuch bright spots, narrative bombshells, and layered storytelling are the work of creator Peter Nowalk.\n\nWhile in the past he’s had his fingerprints in both Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder has been his vision from the ground up. Perhaps understandably, he isn’t quite ready for a post-Annalise Keating world. (“We will tie up everything that was very prominent,” he promises with a cryptic laugh.) Ahead of the final episode, we caught up with the show runner to learn about storylines that never came to be, the unexpected character that informed much of the show’s DNA, and why he’ll always welcome your DMs.\n\nLAURA STUDARUS: Congratulations on bringing six years of work in for a landing.\n\nPETER NORWALK: Thank you so much. We'll see if I stick it! I think we did as good as we could. So yeah, I'm really happy and relieved.\n\nLS: I imagine that there's a lot of different emotions going on right now.\n\nPN: I have to separate my feelings about coronavirus because it's strange. My first feeling is I'm grateful because we finished and there's a lot of shows that didn't and I would have been personally heartbroken. I know the cast would have been too. Just this idea that we thought about this finale for so long. You write it, and you plan it down to every little detail. And we finished it by the skin of our teeth, by just a couple of weeks.\n\nI was in the editing bay up until the day of the quarantine. We finished it that day, our version or like, \"if we can't touch this again, it's fine.\" And then we made little tweaks. Because we knew the lockdown was coming. I'm very grateful about that. It's also been a distraction for me to think about the loss of the show. Obviously, I've worked on it for seven years, probably at this point, and it really was my baby. It's still airing and I'm talking to you, it still feels like it's going. So, I'm holding on to just the fact that people still haven't watched the finale and there's still something to look forward to.\n\nLS: What’s your favorite memory of being on set?\n\nPN: I guess I'll go back to the pilot. To the scene where in the pilot where Annalise goes into the bathroom at Wes' and she manipulates him by rubbing his chest. And it's very sensual and sad and desperate — and wrong. And Viola just did that. She definitely was supposed to touch him, but I don't think I wrote she should rub his chest into the script. It was way more than I pictured. And at first I was like, \"Oh no, she can't do that, that's too much!\" in my head. And then instantly I was like, but that's what makes it awesome. And that's what makes me scared, and so don't ever do it another way because I want to be scared. That just speaks to like what Viola brought to the role. She's a risk taker, and the show became even more subversive than I imagined, which in retrospect has become a dream come true.\n\nCicely Tyson, Viola Davis and \"How to Get Away With Murder\" creator/executive producer Peter Nowalk.\n\nLS: I think that speaks to the fact that this series, in particular, has been surrounded by so many incredible women, both on screen and off. What's been your biggest takeaway from working with all these strong, creative people?\n\nPN: I feel very lucky in that, from the first moment I came to Hollywood, almost all of my bosses have been women. I don't know why. But I was an assistant to two women at a production company. I worked for a female agent at Endeavor. When I worked at Sony Pictures, the head of the studio was Amy Pascal. At Shondaland, it was obviously Betsy Beers and Shonda. My bosses were always women to the point that, after a while, I just thought that was normal. It didn't ever really strike me until questions like this, just because that's who I've always been surrounded with. So, the idea that there wasn't parity for female directors and writers, which is very true, was never true in my world. That was something that I had a blind spot to actually. Like, isn't everywhere like Shondaland? Of course, your writers room is at least half women!\n\nLS: Was that an idea you tried address with your characters as well?\n\nPN: I didn't think of it so much when I was creating the characters of the show. I thought, I'll just draw from instinct. And I think I just knew that I wanted a really inclusive cast and didn't write any ethnicity into the script because I just wanted to see who I liked as an actor. But for me, it's an organic thing to want a lot of different types of people around me because that's the fun of writing a TV show — it's about a lot of different types of people. I obviously wrote a show where none of them knew each other and I wanted to conflict that they all had different points of view. And that was drama to me, and that's all I wanted was to write conflict and drama.\n\nBut as a leader, for example, I actually had to be the one in charge of hiring. I learned along the way that I have to really insist upon reading enough writers of color in order to get those people in the room, and especially directors. Honestly, the first season I didn't think about it. And we had some female directors, but it definitely wasn't half. And it was only when that conversation became much louder. I've been learning just along with everyone else.\n\nLS: Was there an awareness going into the show about how ground-breaking some of these characters' plot lines would become?\n\nPN: Not at all. I think what I learned from Shonda was, you want to write an ensemble where the characters really are distinct. That was my goal. I just wanted all the voices to be really loud so my writers could understand who these characters were and so the audience could understand who they were. And they all felt really different. I didn't want anyone to feel typical or like a character you've seen on TV before. That's where the instinct came from.\n\nOther people have used the word ground-breaking, but that came after we made most of season one, that people were like, \"this is really special\" in terms of the representation. I wish I could say like, \"Oh, that's what I wanted.\" With Connor, I'm a gay man. So, that was very personal to me. I was desperate for a character like him, and I'd seen really good gay characters in Queer as Folk, but that was a long time ago. So, that was when I realized, he's gonna be out and loud, and obnoxious, and confident, and sexual. That was very purposeful. But that was the only one where I felt like I went in with motive, and then the rest of all your other characters have to compete with that.\n\nThe stars of ABC’s “How to Get Away with Murder,” along with creator and executive producer Pete Nowalk and executive producers Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers and Stephen Cragg celebrated the series production wrap of “How to Get Away with Murder” on February 8 at Yamashiro in Hollywood, Calif.\n\nLS: How much of the story was shaped by the news cycle?\n\nPN: That's an interesting question, because I think, at first, I wasn't reading the news as much. It was 2014. My world wasn't that political or controversial. As we went on, the Trump presidency changed how much how I was reading the news and how we were writing the story. It felt like all of a sudden, Annalise was living in a different world, just like all of us were, and so was her fight against the man, and fight against whiteness, and white supremacy, and the corrupt criminal justice system. That all came out just because my writers and actors were all just feeling this need to put voice to things that we cared about in the show.\n\nLS: Was there a plot point or an element that you wanted to see happen that never quite made it?\n\nPN: You introduce certain characters sometimes because you're like, \"Oh, this is what I want to happen.\" And this is coming to mind because I was just talking to Amirah Vann, who we cast as Teagan. That character, that impulse to introduce that character, was, \"Let's give Michaela a boss that's a woman that's very different than her relationship with Annalise.\" And maybe there's some sexual tension there. And Michaela, who's sort of been dismissive of her first fiancé’s bisexuality, can kind of explore bisexuality herself. So, the intention was, \"Oh, we're gonna get them together.\" And we played around with it a lot. But it just wasn't matching Michaela's story. She was with Asher. And then they were murdering people. And then her and Tegan were in conflict. So as much as we intended to get them together, we didn't.\n\nThat said, not doing that has led us to this other storyline between her and Annalise. Which is still ongoing in terms of what we've aired. There's romantic longing there. And so what's cool is you kind of introduce a character with an idea to get together with one person. And I love this about TV — that you watch what's going on, and adjust the writing based on that. I just follow the story, versus me lead it somewhere at times. And it just led me to a place that's equally interesting and I think very unexpected for me, because I didn't picture her and Annalise to end up as close as they are.\n\nLS: How much has fan feedback and opinion and all the passion surrounding the series played into the final product?\n\nPN: I think it plays into it a lot because what people have to also think about is we're way ahead of the audience in terms of our schedule. But the writers and the crew and actors are the first audience. So, when people are like, \"We love Amirah and Viola together on screen,\" then I get to watch it and I see there's something there as well. And what gives you joy, you write toward. Even if it's dark joy, too. For instance, I would watch Bonnie and Frank together on screen sometimes. While I never pictured them together, there was some weird twisted chemistry there. And I was like, \"That makes me feel weird. I'm going toward that.\"\n\nLS: So how much clarity can fans expect going into the final episode?\n\nPN: We will tie up everything that was very prominent and needed to be answered. They'll tell me, of course, after they watch it if we did that. But in terms of the questions that really affect our core characters and how they end up, I think we both answer that and leave room for the audience to dream a little bit.\n\nLS: How has the How to Get Away With Murder team marked the end of your time together?\n\nPN: We had an awesome wrap party that ABC and put together for us at Yamashiro, which is up in the Hollywood Hills. We had blood spattered on the roses. It was so creepy but so fun, and we all just got to be thankful. And I got to see every actor shoot their last scene. Except Matt McGorry — I'm still kicking myself for that. But we had lots of markings to the point that you're like, I just need to stop saying goodbye because it's too sad. You get turned into a family, dysfunctions and all. And it's weird to have people filling your life. I mean, I've had all these actors' voices and faces in my head for years, and they're still there. But it was going to end eventually. I think we ended it appropriately at the right time.\n\nViola Davis addresses her cast and crew at the wrap party for \"How to Get Away With Murder.\"\n\nLS: Do you have any special plans for watching the final episode?\n\nPN: I need a friend to tell me what to do because I'm bad at that stuff. But I think I should probably have a Zoom with some people. So many people watch the show in different formats, and later and I get tweets or Instagram messages from all over the world. Then people watch it much later on Netflix, and that's just so cool because it means it lives on and it's never really done. I had to translate some of the messages from Russia. That's so cool. Thank you, Netflix.\n\nLS: Do any of these messages in particular stand out to you?\n\nPN: This won't be a surprise. I really love the ones from younger gay people and queer people who say that it made it easier for them to come out to their parents because there was something they watched together. And even if it's not about coming out, it's about showing them there's lots of different ways to be gay or queer. I just wanted to create Connor to be awesome. And I went from there. And so that just tells me that it worked. And I feel proud of that. There's nothing like getting a nice fan message because that's why I wanted to write TV, because I was that kid – just loving and living vicariously through a TV show.\n\nLaura Studarus is a Los Angeles-based travel writer with bylines at Fast Company, BBC Travel, and Thrillist.
