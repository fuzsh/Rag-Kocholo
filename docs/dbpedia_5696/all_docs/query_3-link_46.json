        "text": "If you’re a fan of hit shows like How to Get Away With Murder, Grey’s Anatomy, and Bridgerton, then you’re a fan of American television producer and writer — Shonda Rhimes. Inspired by Oprah Winfrey, the Scandal writer took on Hollywood to make a successful career out of writing and storytelling shows that will go on to earn her numerous awards and achievements.\n\nEveryone’s wondering where she gets the inspiration for such incredible entertainment, and we’ve found the answer. It turns out, it can come from anywhere. And for her, it was the conversations between her and her sisters about the Discovery Channel.\n\nThe premise of ‘Grey’s Anatomy’\n\nGrey’s Anatomy is a medical drama that gives viewers more insight into the personal relationships and struggles of the medical profession. Meredith, played by Ellen Pompeo, is the leading lady who the entire storyline revolves around, with several expanding storylines that give fans a more in-depth look into other characters as well.\n\nThere is no shortage of drama, love, tragedy, fear, deaths, births, and everything in-between. It’s the perfect representation of characters of all genders and ethnicities pushing through life, overcoming challenging obstacles, and leaning on each other for love and support.\n\nEven though it is unrealistic to doctors in real life in some cases, it certainly sets the tone for doctors today who have more empathy than the traditional portrayal of emotionless doctors from decades ago.\n\nThe medical drama has earned extreme success\n\nSince its premiere in 2005, Grey’s Anatomy has captured audiences all over and generated significant interest in medical dramas and the medical field in real life.\n\nTheir talented cast and fascinating stories have earned them prestigious award-wins like Golden Globes, Primetime Emmy Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, BET Awards, and many more. In fact, IMDB reports an amazing 80 award-wins and 233 nominations.\n\nIt has even earned its spotlight on Twitter as the show that garnered the most buzz during its 11th season.\n\nHowever, with extreme success comes the pressure to stay that way. In an interview with OprahMag, Rhimes was asked about the pressure to keep her ratings up and responded, “It’s a huge amount of pressure. The night before we aired this season’s premiere, I couldn’t sleep. All week I drove everybody crazy with my doom-and-gloom attitude. I knew there was a chance no one would watch, and I just had to breathe my way through it.”\n\nNeedless to say, the season’s premiere was a hit as always.\n\nHow the Discovery Channel inspired Shonda Rhimes\n\nInspiration can come from anywhere and sometimes at the drop of a hat. For Rhimes, it began with her fascination with surgeries but was fueled by the content she and her sisters watched on the Discovery Channel.\n\n“My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we’d seen on the Discovery Channel,” Rhimes told Oprah in an interview. “There’s something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you’d never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they’re cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the OR seemed like the natural setting.”"
