        "text": "Life at fictional Seattle Grace Hospital lives on.\n\nABC has renewed veteran Grey’s Anatomy for a 21st season. Comparably, this extends the series, which debuted in 2005, as the longest running primetime medical drama in TV history, which initially occurred in 2019. Prior to Grey’s Anatomy, NBC’s ER, at 15 seasons, had that distinction. It ran from 1994 to 2009.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy is also longest running primetime scripted series in ABC’s history. Prior to Grey’s Anatomy, family-themed comedy The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, at 14 seasons, held the ABC record. It aired from 1952 to 1966.\n\n“The loyalty and love of Grey’s Anatomy fans has propelled us into a historic 21st season, and I could not be more grateful,” said series creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes in a statement. “Meg Marinis’ storytelling is a gift that continues to keep the show vibrant, compelling and alive, and I can’t wait to see what she has in store for next season.”\n\nGrey's Anatomy airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. and the next day on Hulu. All 20 seasons are streaming on the Disney-owned platform as well, for the first time. Current spinoff Station 19, which follows Grey’s Anatomy on the ABC schedule, will be concluding after seven seasons in May. Earlier spinoff Private Practice ran for six seasons, from 2007 to 2013.\n\nThe current cast of Grey’s Anatomy includes original castmates Chandra Wilson and James Pickens Jr., as well as Kevin McKidd, Kim Raver, Camilla Luddington, Caterina Scorsone, Anthony Hill and Alexis Floyd. Ellen Pompeo - another original cast member - exited the show as a series regular in 2019 but returned for four episodes this season. The cast for the upcoming 21st season has not been confirmed."
