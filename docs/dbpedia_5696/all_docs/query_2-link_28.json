        "text": "\"The team works overnight to remodel the restaurant.\"\n\nThis page is under construction.\n\nPeople[]\n\nJoe Nagy, Owner[]\n\nJoe opened Mill Street Bistro in Norwalk, Ohio after losing his job at food sales. However, he has zero previous restaurant experience.\n\nJoe is one of the typical owners appearing on Kitchen Nightmares USA that can be summed up as \"small man with a big ego\". However, he stands out by being one of the few people that pushes nearly all of Gordon's buttons. Joe abuses his staff, constantly berates and insults them for even the pettiest of reasons, he even does it in front of the customers which drove a lot of them away. Joe also frequently held meetings with his staff, but these meetings usually involves him insulting them further and blaming them for every little issue. He is in complete denial about how poorly his restaurant is doing, is highly resistant to change, refuses to take responsibility and constantly come up with excuses for his failures, has zero respect for the food industry and is completely dishonest to his customers and to Gordon, uses frozen ingredients, and is a fairly incompetent cook.\n\nEven so, Joe is extremely full of himself, and even seems to look down on Chef Ramsay, believing himself to be superior to the world renowned chef in some ways, during his first lunch service, Joe made a poor attempt to mimic Gordon's Scottish accent to mock him behind his back.\n\nWhile Joe's ego is obviously over inflated, it also appears to be a very fragile one. Joe constantly roves around his dining room looking for praise and approval from his customers, while preaching how good his restaurant supposedly is. He invited Gordon Ramsay to his restaurant in hopes to gain Gordon's approval, and when Gordon criticizes his food, Joe quickly became defense, and will go as far as claim that he's above Gordon somehow.\n\nJoe's stubbornness and arrogance is best described as legendary, being second to only Amy from Amy's Baking Company.\n\nTom, Cook[]\n\nTom is the sous-chef of Mill Streets Bistro, he's a man of little words normally, likely because he's fully aware that arguing with Joe is utterly pointless and will likely get him fired. Tom admitted that the method of cooking used in the restaurant are flawed and can be improved, and if he has a choice, he'll not eat here. Gordon easily sees that Tom is a better chef than Joe and has more respect for the sous-chef.\n\nAmy, Server[]\n\nAmy considered Joe the reason why the Mill Streets Bistro is failing. She clearly resents Joe and feels bitter about the way she and the rest of the staff are treated, she sometimes make subtitle jabs at Joe and his cooking both before him and behind his back. Amy also dislikes the menu of the restaurant, she dislikes the elk quesadilla and vegetarian raviolis.\n\nRebecca, Server[]\n\nMuch like the rest of the servers, Rebecca resents Joe, calling him an \"arrogant, selfish jerk\". Which is not surprising considering that Joe constantly talks down and disrespects her like the rest of the staff. Joe's arrogance sometimes even got into the way of Rebecca's work, as his failing business directly affects her livelihood. Joe also considers her serving a table of guests he's talking to interrupting his \"meeting\".\n\nBill, Server[]\n\nBill, unsurprisingly, has no love for Joe. He resents how Joe never takes responsibility and always blames other people or factors for his muck ups. He considers that one of the main reasons Mill Street Bistro is failing is how Joe looks down on the local customers, and never make any effort to market the restaurant to them. Neither does Bill believe that the food is good, giving it only a 5 out of 10.\n\nKaleigh, Server[]\n\nWhile she wanted to see the restaurant become a success, Kaleigh sometimes find it hard top work under all the pressure, she resents Joe for the way he treats her, however, complaining to Joe has no use, as he basically told her to either take it or leave. At one point Joe berated her so badly that it drove her to tears and caused the customers to leave in disgust.\n\nJen, Server[]\n\nJen, much like the rest of the staff, is treated by Joe like tools. Naturally, she's eager to see Gordon Ramsay give Joe a lesson he won't soon forget.\n\nBrian Goodman, Chef(hired to replace Joe in the kitchen)\n\nBrian is from a reputable restaurant in Cleveland\n\nBefore Gordon's Arrival[]\n\nJoe Nagy owns a farm in Ohio and has established Mill Street Bistro. Joe previously worked in food sales. Joe claims he has worked for many old-school European chefs and always dreamed of having his own place. He feels as though you should only call your place fine dining if you can back it up. His staff aren't as bullish on his ability as he is. He believes his food is exceptional, they believe it's mediocre at best. The staff knows a lot of things are frozen, and he's not even nice to them. They even go so far as to say Joe turns customers off more than anything.\n\nFirst Impressions[]\n\nBefore Gordon arrived at Mill Street Bistro, Joe invited Gordon to his livestock farm to show off where the produce from the restaurant allegedly comes from in hopes to impress the world famous chef. Joe also tells Gordon that he's \"self-taught\" with some of the best old-school chefs in Europe. He also introduces Gordon to his pet goat, Skinny, who proceeds to attempt to headbutt Gordon. Joe told Gordon that he believes the issues with Mill Street Bistro is how there are not enough asses in the seats because people do not take the restaurant seriously.\n\nGordon is impressed with how Joe runs the ranch singlehandedly, and he has a liking for farm to fork restaurants, so he's quite eager to try out the food. However, when he arrived at Mill Street Bistro, Gordon is immediately left unimpressed with the decor, he also doesn't like the name badges the servers wear and processes to have them all remove the badges, much to the servers' pleasure. Gordon is also a little baffled by how specials are referred to as \"features\" in Mill Street Bistro unlike other restaurants.\n\nAmy is the one to welcome Gordon into the restaurant, she confesses to Gordon that Joe is the main reason why the restaurant is failing, as his constant beratement of the staff drives away customers. Amy also admitted that she doesn't believe that Joe is trained with European masters. After taking his orders, Bill arrived to serve some drinks, he tells Gordon that Joe is arrogant and thinks the restaurant is too good for the locals.\n\nFirst Meal[]\n\nFood Ordered[]\n\nGordon wanted to see as much as he could, so he ordered a large amount of items for lunch.\n\nElk Medallion \"feature\" served over a grilled portobello mushroom. (medium rare)\n\n\"Catch of the day\", a trio of Ohio raised bluegill, perch and largemouth bass.\n\nElk Quesadilla\n\nVegetarian Ravioli Primavera\n\nScallops en Croute\n\nFrench Onion Soup\n\nOyster Rockefeller\n\nImpressions of the Food[]\n\nWhen reviewing the menu, Gordon noticed how expensive some of the items the restaurant provided are. But since it's farm-to-table (supposedly), he remained hopeful.\n\nThe French Onion Soup was a bad start, the cheese in it were small in quantity and barely melted, the soup itself is way too greasy, watery, and overall lacking in onions.\n\nThe order of Oysters Rockefeller was so bitter in taste (usually caused when the oysters themselves are frozen) that Gordon ended up spitting it out. He also dislikes how the parsley infused olive oil around the rim ended up on the oysters themselves.\n\nJoe didn't take Gordon's criticisms seriously, and simply passed them off as \"amusing\", while he did offer to make a new French Onion Soup, Gordon decided to move on, pointing out how it takes around 4 hours the caramelize the onions for the soup, as he's starting to realize that Joe is most likely bluffing about his cooking skills and background.\n\nFirst Dinner Service[]\n\nGordon asks Amy where he can find some food, and she names a place. Gordon announces he will return for the dinner service. When Amy tells Joe that Gordon is going somewhere else to eat, he is insulted and starts cursing. When Gordon returns, the staff are all standing together, eager to hear Gordon relay the rest of his criticisms for Joe. He asks Joe how he thinks his lunch went. Joe says nobody has ever critiqued him the way Gordon did, and flat out says this was uncalled for. Gordon retorts that he wasn't impressed by anything, never even wanting a second bite. Gordon relays his criticisms one by one. He then asks if the fish are fresh. Tom, the sous chef finally gives Gordon the answer he's looking for(the fish are in the freezer). Joe is growing more irate and just asks to move on. Gordon obliges and moves on to the elk. Gordon had ordered his medium rare, Joe claims it would have been better had he asked for medium. Gordon says for $35, he should be able to get it how he wants it. Joe challenges him, questioning if he knows anything about elk at all, such as having it in his own restaurants. Gordon informs him that he does, but only seasonally, for elk should only be sold when it's at its absolute best. Gordon sums it up by saying \"You are not a chef, stop pretending to be one\". Joe says he never claimed to be one. Gordon recalls the story about training with \"master chefs\", and suddenly Joe denies ever saying this(at this point, the clip re-airs). Gordon calls Joe a small man with a fake bistro. The staff are enjoying this as much as they thought they would, with Bill saying \"I feel like Christmas has come early\". Joe tries in one fell swoop to just say Gordon is all the same things he accused him of being, to which Gordon says the difference is \"I can cook, Joe\".\n\nBefore the dinner service, Joe gathers the staff, mostly to berate them and to vent about Gordon. Joe asserts that Gordon doesn't know about lake fish, or elk, or beef, or buffalo. The staff are afraid to answer him when he asks if elk ever comes back. Unbeknownst to Joe, some customers have arrived and can hear the whole exchange. Joe says they all need to get their shit together. One customer finally breaks this up when he shouts from outside \"You got customers out here!\". Joe peeks out and sees them and is immediately embarrassed, goes back to the staff and tries to change his tune, saying he appreciates them. The staff don't buy it, but are happy to get on with dinner service anyway.\n\nBack in the kitchen, Joe is still pontificating about the elk for the camera, and mocking Gordon's seasonal usage of it. Jen asks Tom a question about a dish, and Joe tells her to get out. Gordon notices a large sign that says \"QUIET\", and asks Tom about it. Tom explains and Gordon asks \"So how are you supposed to communicate?\". Joe answers and says they have a job to do, \"mediocre as we are\". Nonetheless, Joe and Tom put the food out fairly quickly. However, a lot of it gets sent back. Gordon agrees with the feedback, but of course Joe disputes this. Gordon starts to mock his earlier statements about passion. Joe starts playing victim again, when suddenly Gordon gets a call. The caller is a former employee he had reached out to earlier, a prep cook named Teresa. Gordon goes outside to talk to her. She says due to a lack of organization, she had to do far more than her job title called for. She goes on to say Joe always berated her, which drove her to quit. She has some pictures on her phone that she shows Gordon. She also tells him that he buys his meat from wholesale clubs and refers to his customers as hillbillies.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, he takes the opportunity to inspect the fridge. Some of the food is undated. Another item has been there for three years. He finds the frozen oysters, confirming his earlier suspicions. Clearly, this is not a farm to table restaurant. He goes to Joe, and once again Joe is defensive. Gordon starts to contemplate leaving, and at that exact moment, Joe is asked for some French Onion soup, which Joe says is ready. Gordon had the soup earlier, and looks at it, spotting raw onions. He asks Tom if he put them in, to which Tom says no. It was Joe who did. Joe says because Gordon told him the soup needed more onions, he put more onions in. Gordon is furious(French Onion Soup is not supposed to have raw onions in it), and demands he take it off the menu for the night. Gordon continues ranting \"I'm not here to show an idiot that you can't put raw onions in a soup. I can't teach you that, that's just common sense, which in your tiny mind is not common!\". He summons Tom to back him up and Tom obliges. Gordon praises Tom, saying Joe's got a talented staff. Gordon offers to leave....\n\nPart 2 begins at this point. Joe says he doesn't want him to leave. Gordon says \"You wanted a band-aid, but you need surgery\", and says his staff are just afraid to criticize him because he's a dictator. He also says the fine dining aspect is not right for the market they're in. Joe says he just wants a quality restaurant and wants to succeed not only for himself, but his staff. This is enough to make Gordon stay.\n\nReflections[]\n\nGordon says it was a shit day, but is willing to move on.\n\nRemainder of the Visit[]\n\nThe next day, Gordon gathers the staff, not telling them that he has Joe listening in another room, watching on camera. After some trepidation, Amy is the first to speak. She says Joe is the main reason for the lack of business, for he berates them in front of the customers. Others echo similar sentiments. Tom says the food is a 2 at best(on a scale from 1-10). Joe also has a habit of talking about himself to customers for long stretches of time. Joe also holds meetings to berate his staff all at once. Gordon asks them as a group who has thought about quitting. They all raise their hands. Gordon reveals the ruse, which immediately makes all of them nervous. Gordon brings Joe out. Joe accepts responsibility for what he's done to them, and says he needs to soften up, but quickly turns it into \"we need to change\". Gordon asks him to commit to change. Kaleigh doesn't believe him. Gordon then conducts a demonstration. He pulls out steaks, a lot of great produce, and even a bottle of wine. Gordon says that's five dinners at home worth of food, which still came out to less money than it would for a young couple to have one meal at Joe's restaurant. Joe concedes his prices are too high.\n\nIn the kitchen, Gordon asks if Joe's ever had a burger on the menu. Joe says no, because the staff didn't want him to put one on when he asked them. Gordon doesn't believe him, so he tasks Tom with grilling the burgers while he and Joe ask the servers if this is true. They deny this ever happened. Gordon says \"Every time I smell BS, I'm coming for you\" referring to Joe. Back in the kitchen, Gordon starts working with some fresh local walleye. Back to the burgers, Gordon praises Tom for grilling the burgers correctly and shows them that and the walleye as specials, presenting them to the staff. The staff raves about the specials. Gordon then takes down the \"QUIET\" sign. The next dinner service begins. Joe gets confused on how to put the burger together. Gordon shows him again. The customers enjoy the specials. However, Joe is still struggling with the new items, and communication breaks down. An order comes in for an elk quesadilla, and Joe can't resist, asking him to give him insight on it. Gordon has no interest in doing so, other than to say get rid of it. Joe gets even more heated and says \"I'm asking for help! You come here and help me instead of running your jaw!\". What follows is one the better known exchanges in Kitchen Nightmares history. \"THEN WAKE UP!\", \"YOU wake up!\". Gordon kicks Joe out of the kitchen, taking over himself with Tom. Gordon takes a deep breath, \"Now we've got rid of the fucking problem\".\n\nJoe goes into the dining room and sulks to the customers. The customers aren't enjoying hearing this. Gordon and Tom finish the service strong. Outside, Joe is still sulking for a customer. Joe is now mad that Gordon kicked him out of his own kitchen, and he goes to confront Gordon again after the service. Joe now starts to blame Tom for the items Gordon doesn't like, but Gordon cuts him off, not buying it. Gordon tells him point blank, \"You are running this business into the ground. You cannot be in that kitchen. It's done, apron off.\" Gordon vows to get help for him. Gordon goes into the kitchen and starts designing a new menu.\n\nRestaurant & Menu Remodel[]\n\nGordon already liked the look of the restaurant, and declines to renovate the restaurant or call his design team in. He does redesign the menu. The new menu is much more simple, and emphasizes fresh, local ingredients. Gordon announces that Joe will no longer be the chef. He announces the new chef, a man named Brian Goodman, from one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Brian promises to find a train a chef to succeed him.\n\nFinal Service[]\n\nGordon holds a charity event to drum up support in the community. Brian will run the kitchen and Joe will be on the front. Tom enjoys Brian's leadership a lot better than Joe's. Joe shows some enthusiasm in the front of house. He makes the only mistake of the night, but Brian quickly makes up for it. Overall, the service went very well. Gordon praises everyone, and says this is what a real neighborhood bistro looks like. Gordon tells Joe he has a nice restaurant and a good staff. Gordon talks to Joe one-on-one for the last time. He implores him to not go back to his old ways. He says he doesn't want to see him in the kitchen when he comes back. Joe says he doesn't know what the future holds. Gordon leaves, still unsure about Joe.\n\nAfter Gordon's Departure[]\n\nJoe keeps most of Gordon's menu. Kaleigh, Tom, Jen and Rebecca leave. However, Joe breaks his promise and re-inserts himself as chef. Joe renamed the restaurant later that year, and it closed in 2015. A steakhouse now occupies the building.\n\nProduction Notes[]\n\nTBA\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJoe sued Gordon and his production company. They settled for $1,000.\n\nReferences[]"
