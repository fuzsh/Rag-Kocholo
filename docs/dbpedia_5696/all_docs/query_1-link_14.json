        "text": "Grey’s Anatomy, prime-time American television medical drama that debuted on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network in 2005. The series enjoyed top 10 ratings, earned numerous Emmy Award nominations, and won the 2007 Golden Globe for best drama.\n\nGrey’s Anatomy’s title was inspired by the classic medical text Gray’s Anatomy and alludes to the show’s main character, Meredith Grey (played by Ellen Pompeo). The program focuses on the personal and professional lives of surgical interns and their medical mentors. Other notable characters included Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), and Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Most of the action takes place in Seattle Grace Hospital, where Meredith and her peers face obstacles, first as interns striving to become residents and later as residents who must define their career paths while mentoring interns of their own. Although the field of medicine is always a core component of the show’s plots, much of the drama in Grey’s Anatomy draws on the characters’ personal tribulations. The show adopts a sex-driven and sometimes humorous treatment of its subject matter. The intense demands of the medical profession necessitate a strong support group, but the relationships that emerge often exacerbate the already difficult tasks of maturing in medicine and in life. The characters’ love lives provide an ongoing saga, as the medical staff fall in love with each other or, occasionally, with patients. The word grey in the show’s title also highlights the complex situations in which Meredith and her colleagues find themselves, where there are no clear-cut black-and-white solutions.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
