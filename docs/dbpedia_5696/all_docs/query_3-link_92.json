        "text": "Each week on Grey’s Anatomy: Post-Op, host Gordon James will ask cast, writers, producers, and crew members to give behind-the-scenes secrets, discuss iconic scenes, and share their favorite memorable moments from the show's 14 seasons on-air.\n\nWith the outpouring of love shown for last week's 300th Grey's Anatomy episode, we figured it was only right to bring you a special bonus installment of Post-Op. This week's final episode features the incomparable triple-threat, director, producer, and actress, Debbie Allen. You've seen her on Grey's as Dr. Catherine Avery, but she's often behind the camera as well, directing several episodes of the series, including the 300th episode. This week she's talking to Gordon about the first time she met Shonda, how she transitioned from directing the show to appearing on it, her own \"boss moves\", and spilling some secrets about this week's mid-season finale. Make sure you watch all the way to the end of this exclusive interview.\n\nRe-watch the full episodes featured in this week's Post-Op on Netflix:\n\nSeason 3 Episode 16 “Drowning on Dry Land”\n\nSeason 8 Episode 5 “Loss, Love and Legacy”\n\nSeason 8 Episode 24 “Flight”\n\nSeason 9 Episode 4 “I Saw Her Standing There”\n\nSeason 11 Episode 24 “You’re My Home”\n\nSeason 12 Episode 5 “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner”\n\nSeason 13 Episode 18 “Be Still My Soul”\n\nSeason 13 Episode 24 “Ring of Fire”"
