        "text": "Shonda Rhimes -- the mastermind writer-producer behind the hit ABC shows Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder -- knows how to toy with our emotions.\n\nHer signature move is have us convinced we know what will happen, and then rip that conviction to shreds with outcomes that have us all dropping our jaws and exclaiming: \"What just happened?\"\n\nPrepare for Thursday's finales of Grey's and Scandal by reliving the most OMG moments of all time in the TGIT shows. And fear not, adrenaline junkies: All three shows start back in the fall.\n\nMAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nScandal\n\nFitz gets shot.\n\nSeason 2, episode 7: \"Defiance\"\n\nYou know something's up when Mellie changes her mind about wanting to attend Fitz's birthday party. But we bet you weren't expecting Fitz to take a bullet to the shoulder moments later.\n\nOlivia's mom is alive.\n\nSeason 3, episode 7: \"Everything's Coming Up Mellie\"\n\nIs there any detail about Olivia's parents that's not a plot twist? The most intense of these, though, is when Olivia finds out that her mother was never on the plane that crashed and killed its passengers 22 years ago.\n\nOlivia gets kidnapped.\n\nSeason 4, episode 9: \"Where the Sun Don't Shine\"\n\nIt seems no one is untouchable on this show, even Olivia. Just when she lets her guard down, kidnappers break into her apartment and steal her away, setting up the page-turner of a plot in the second half of the season.\n\nTap to watch if you're viewing on the news app.\n\nHow To Get Away With Murder\n\nAnnalise knows more than we thought about her husband.\n\nSeason 1, episode 9: \"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\"\n\nThe jaw-dropping winter finale ended with two big revelations -- that Annalise knew about Sam and Lila, and that, because of this, Annalise was complacent about Sam's murder all along.\n\nWatch that moment here.\n\nGrey's Anatomy\n\nDenny dies -- right after proposing to Izzie.\n\nSeason 2, episode 27: \"Losing My Religion\"\n\nIn what has become perhaps the most iconic scene from Grey's, Izzie curls up next to Denny in his hospital bed, and she's wearing the dress that was supposed to be for her date with Denny to the hospital prom. And your poor little heart couldn't take it.\n\nThe doctors' plane goes down.\n\nSeason 8, episode 24:\"Where the Sun Don't Shine\"\n\nPlenty of the cast have been in mortal peril (and plenty have not survived), but things never looked so grim as when their plane went down, seriously injuring several of the doctors. Dr. Lexie Grey didn't make it.\n\nDerek Shepherd dies after a car accident.\n\nSeason 11, episode 21: \"How to Save a Life\"\n\nIf you've been on the Internet in the past few weeks, you know no one was ready for this. Shonda hit us right in the feels with this one -- and then again when we found out Meredith was pregnant.\n\nTap to watch if you're veiwing on the news app.\n\nWhich Shonda Rhimes moment shocked you the most? Let us know in the comments."
