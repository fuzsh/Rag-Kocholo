        "text": "‘Islamophobia’ is today’s blasphemy – wrongspeak may be criminalised\n\nOffending against religion was once a crime. It could become one again, albeit only if the belief is Islam\n\nMiddle England is being taxed into submission. No wonder it’s furious\n\nJeremy Hunt must reward hard working professionals, who have suffered from the current personal tax regime\n\nThe Tories refuse to admit that mass migration is driving the housing crisis\n\nThe Government’s belated new plans are all very well, but will hardly make a dent, given population pressures\n\nBritain is abandoning hard work in favour of welfarism and idleness\n\nIt’s as if we now live in two countries, with millions thinking there is no stigma attached to not working\n\nBritain is facing a constitutional crisis that could end Sunak’s premiership\n\nThe row over the Rwanda policy has turned political attitudes to the House of Lords on their head\n\nMinisters blundered by turning a new Holocaust memorial into a controversy\n\nHow have we got to a point where even survivors of the death camps oppose the ill-considered plans?\n\nTory splits could turn a 1997-style defeat into a total electoral wipeout\n\nThere’s a common factor behind big past losses: divided parties do worse than they would otherwise\n\nThe Post Office Horizon scandal has shattered faith in British justice\n\nOne of the most shocking facets of this affair is how long it has taken for those wronged to receive redress\n\nBritain has become a safe haven for terrorists and foreign criminals\n\nHuman rights law stops us from protecting national security, and politicians are doing nothing about it\n\nKeir Starmer plans to play the class card, just as Wilson did 60 years ago\n\nAfter 13 years of Tory rule, the 1964 election gave Labour a narrow win. Is history about to repeat?\n\nThe NHS will face a permanent winter unless Labour confronts its original sin\n\nThe root cause of its ills is that it is a nationalised system funded almost entirely out of taxation\n\nThe Covid Inquiry has already made up its mind on who to blame: Boris\n\nThe guilt for the disaster of lockdown is collective. Too few asked whether we got the balance right\n\nThe common sense majority is being cowed into silence by activist zealots\n\nSmall groups are being allowed to impose their views on green policy and identity politics on all of us\n\nReckless public spending is pushing the country towards the debt abyss\n\nIt’s an illusion Jeremy Hunt has money to burn. Our grandchildren will pay the price for this profligacy\n\n‘Thatcher should be ashamed’ – an insider’s tale of the last Tory catastrophe\n\nNorman Fowler’s account of 17 years in office tends to the polite and generous, but evidently he prefers John Major to the Iron Lady\n\nIt’s a testament to British freedom that banning a march is no easy decision\n\nWe cherish free expression but tolerance towards the intolerant could prove to be the end of our way of life\n\nSunak’s Bletchley Park summit won’t put the AI genie back in the bottle\n\nOur leaders have been ultra-cautious in trivial areas, yet turned a blind eye to this looming threat\n\nExtremists are exploiting Britain’s tolerance to plot our destruction\n\nWe have allowed the UK to become a haven for radical activists and dissidents who would do us harm\n\nThe Tories are about to rediscover the cost of being seen as soft on crime\n\nMinisters are only raising the downsides of short sentences because they’ve not built enough prisons\n\nA spectre haunts the Labour Party, the spectre of a 1992-style disaster\n\nThere’s a reason Starmer talks in hackneyed clichés: he is terrified of giving the Tories any ammunition\n\nIt’s not just the triple lock that faces oblivion, but the state pension itself\n\nThe parties should be working out now how the younger generation can save enough to live on\n\nFrom Ulez to pylons, ‘consultations’ are being used to quash opposition\n\nLeaders claim they are listening to the public, but never seem to hear even the most vocal dissent\n\nNobody is held accountable for failure in Britain’s broken public sector\n\nHonourable resignations appear to be a thing of the past. Just look at Northern Ireland’s chief constable\n\nThe Bibby Stockholm is a symbol of Britain’s failed migration policy\n\nThe Government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda looks dead. But if not there, then where will they go?\n\nI’ve been fined for driving on a 20mph road. The criminal justice system is upside down\n\nThe whole criminal justice system is upside down. It would be dangerous if we lost trust in it entirely\n\nA nuclear war could wipe out all of humanity, and nobody seems to care\n\nPeople prefer to fret about the threat from climate change, even though we can adapt\n\nThe scandalous Stonehenge tunnel is a very British waste of taxpayer money\n\nWhy do public projects in the UK always cost so much more than similar schemes in other nations?"
