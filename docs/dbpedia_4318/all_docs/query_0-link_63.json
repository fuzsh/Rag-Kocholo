        "text": "Todayâs podcast is a roundtable discussion focused on the topic of compassionate leadership, which is top of mind for nearly every executive, whether youâre running a large or small business or for-profit or not-for-profit organization.Â\n\nLeading the roundtable is Donato Tramuto, author of a new book entitled, The Double Bottom Line â How Compassionate Leaders Captivate Hearts and Deliver Results. The book is at the top of its category on Amazon.\n\nThe other members of the roundtable are Kurt Small, President, East Markets, Commercial and Specialty Business Division, Anthem Inc., which is the largest for-profit managed health care company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association network, with over 40 million membersâ¦Tom Riley, former CEO of SeniorLink, which is the largest provider of family caregiver servicesâ¦Laurie Cameron, CEO of PurposeBlue, which is a pioneer in science-backed mindfulness-based programs for corporationsâ¦and Phil Johnston, CEO of PWJ Associates, which provides government relations, business development, and PR services to for profits and not-for-profits. Heâs also my Dad, so this was an especially fun podcast for me.Â\n\nDuring the discussion, we dive into the notion of compassionate leadership, why write a book on the subject, and why itâs important right now in the evolution of companies and society.Â\n\nDonato interviewed 40 leaders across many industries to come up with his nouvelle framework around compassionate leadership. During this research, he uncovered a number of areas to address, including a âcompassionate leadership gapâ between the old ways of managing a workforce and what is needed now. The bookâs approach goes beyond empathetic leadership and focuses on helping leaders get the balance right between tenderness, trust and toughness.\n\nThe roundtable guests also touch on the compassion moments in their own lives that shifted their way of thinking, managing and being a leader. They discuss why the recent Great Resignation should be re-labeled the Great Reflection â people are resigning because they have reflected that they are tired of not being heard and respected.Â\n\nThrough this lens, trust and rewards systems, both formal and informal, are important elements along the journey of compassionate leadership. Customers, employees, and community all play crucial roles. Further, creating an environment for psychological safety of employees can engender tremendous goodwill and virtuous effects within an organization that have real-world, tangible and tactical outcomes on revenue and workforce motivation/attrition. You rent your tile but you own your dignity, as Donato noted.\n\nLastly, I should note that compassion can be used in your personal life, too. Listening to understand instead of listening to react is one of Donatoâs mantras. Be more compassionate to yourself, who often can be your own worst enemy, and to the people who you care about and, notably, who care about you. This means call your Mom or Dad or someone you care about today â donât email or text her â but call her.\n\nDonato &Â Roundtable Bios:\n\nDONATOÂ TRAMUTO\n\nDonato J.
