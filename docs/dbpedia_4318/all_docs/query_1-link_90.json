        "text": "All who knew Timothy Johnston, Sr. would agree that he brought the world around him to life. He was willing to work hard, but he liked to play hard, too, and he was the sort of person who was usually willing to try anything once. Tim loved working on cars, but it was being with his family and friends that he treasured most. He was passionate about his work and loved being a contractor. With a life that spanned times of great change in the world around him, Tim created a priceless collection of memories that his loved ones will forever cherish\n\nIt seems only fitting that Tims journey began during a time that was as colorful as he was. It was the 1950s when televisions were becoming part of our homes in record numbers, James Dean dominated the silver screen among the male actors, and Elvis Presley took the music world by storm with his introduction to rock n roll. Amidst this eventful time was the year 1955 when Timothy made his arrival on May 22 at 1:30 a.m. at St. Edwards Hospital in New Albany, Indiana. Born to Richard and Mary (Craig) Johnston, he was joined in his family by his brother, Russell. While he was growing up, Tim and his family moved around Southern Indiana. He developed a love for the outdoors while growing up with squirrel and rabbit hunting being among his favorite activities. He played Little League baseball for 12 years. Since he was the first grandchild in his family, Tim loved being with his grandparents since they went overboard in spoiling him! Actually, his aunts spoiled him as well! A student at local schools, Tim played in the high school band at Jeffersonville High School in Jefferson, Indiana, and with that his love for playing the drums was born. He did end up earning his GED in 1994.\n\nAs a young man, Tim started off pouring concrete in the construction industry with his father. He then spent some time working at a sod farm. Tim eventually worked his way up to the Gary area where he worked in the steel mills before becoming a long time contractor. He truly loved his work and everything about being a contractor. For the past 12 years, Tim worked at Reelcraft in Columbia City.\n\nTim loved being with his family whenever he could. Anytime there was a special event, he loved having his family go with him to Golden Corral. Tim was an amazing cook who also enjoyed cooking, but he loved the extensive food selections at Golden Corral. Among the specialties that came out of Tims kitchen were his various Southern comfort foods. His fried chicken, fried potatoes, collard greens, chicken and dumplings, and egg rolls were just some of the things that his family absolutely loved. All year, Tim looked forward to celebrating the Fourth of July. It was because of his father that he loved this holiday, and every year he was certain to see fireworks. Later in life, Tim treasured having his family all together more than anything else.\n\nIn his free time, Tim could usually be found doing something he enjoyed. He was a backyard mechanic who gained a great sense of satisfaction from working on cars. Being mechanically minded, Tim also enjoyed building things. Tim liked traveling and relaxing with a game of Call of Duty on his Xbox. Tim was always up for a good time and loved having his Crown Royal on the rocks.\n\nA vibrant, fun-loving, and lively man, Timothy Johnston, Sr. maintained an active lifestyle filled with the people and things he loved. He could be stubborn and blunt at times, yet his love for his family also ran deep, and he wasnt afraid to do things his own way. Tim experienced so many enriching experiences, but his family brought him the greatest joy. Deeply loved, he will never be forgotten.\n\nTimothy Johnston, Sr., age 60, of Columbia City, Indiana, died at 2:57 p.m. Saturday, November 7, 2015, at IU Health Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis. Tims family includes his mother, Mary; children, Timothy Johnston, Jr. of Columbia City, Jeremiah (Schaun) Johnston of Columbia City, Aaron Johnston of New Haven; Christopher Johnston of Calhoun, Ga., Shanda Akins of Canton, Ga., Adele Vallow of Fort Wayne, Candiest (Scott) Sackel of Greenville, S.C., Christina Johnston of South Whitley and Danielle (Mat) Shoda of Columbia City; brother, Russell (Tina) Johnston of Roswell, Ga. ; his childrens mothers, Belinda Griffin, Deb (Brown) Fast and Wanda Garrett; 28 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Tim was preceded in death by his father; children, Richard J. and Richard W. Johnston and 3 infant children; and grandchildren, Kayla and Phillip Johnston.\n\nVisitation will be held on Wednesday, November 11, 2015, from 2-7 p.m. at DeMoney-Grimes, a Life Story Funeral Home, 600 Countryside Drive, Columbia City. Funeral services will start at 7. Memorial gifts may be given in his memory to Parkview Heart Institute, I.C.O. Parkview Foundation. To send the family condolences, visit www.demoneygrimes.com ."
