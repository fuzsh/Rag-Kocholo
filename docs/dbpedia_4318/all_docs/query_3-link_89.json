        "text": "“I had virtually no qualifications, but had an idea I would like to do something in the art line. My mother met someone who engraved glass and thought it might suit me. It took a while for her to persuade (nag) me to do something about it and when I eventually did I thought it worth a try. That was it. That was 1971, 51 years ago and I’ve never done anything else,” recalls Philip, who never received any formal art training other than art classes when he was young.\n\nThere was virtually no one teaching the craft when he started so an apprenticeship wasn’t possible. “Therefore, I taught myself by trial and error, (scratch and break!). As to when I mastered my craft, I would have to say that I am still learning and will continue to do so.”\n\n“My intention is to create on glass designs that not only are pleasing to the eye and accurate in what they portray, but also reflect in some way the care and attention to detail of the Creator, as observed in the world around us,” says Oxford-based Philip.\n\nMany consider glass hand engraving to be a dying art form, and specialist hand-engravers are a disappearing breed, but there is hope.\n\nI had the rare opportunity to partially see Philip at work in Singapore, where he was commissioned to hand-engrave 25 Baccarat bottles, a one-time-only release limited edition in collaboration with Johnnie Walker House to commemorate Singapore’s 50th anniversary. The ornate designs were symbolic of Singapore’s iconic landmarks including Raffles Hotel and the Super Trees and Flower Dome at Gardens By The Bay.\n\n“I completed exactly 25 bottles in five days. I couldn’t afford to shatter any glass (made of Baccarat crystal), ” he says. 24 of the SG50 tribute decanters were sold at S$65,000 each. Bottle No. 25, which carries additional unique features engraved by Philip, was sold in a silent auction.\n\n“The beauty of these creations lies in the intricate details – where no two pieces are engraved the same,” says Philip, who has a studio at home."
