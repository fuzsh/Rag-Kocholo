        "text": "This week's episode features audio from a workshop by Phillip Johnston entitled, The Perfect Lie of Liberty - Pursuing Freedom in a Culture of Choice.\n\nAn inescapable aspect of life today is a constant sense of FOMO (fear of missing out). We are awash in options, a condition that has led to increased anxiety rather than enduring peace. At the root of this anxiety is a commonplace misunderstanding of freedom. What if true freedom is more than simply the ability to choose what we want?\n\nPhillip Johnston&rsquo;s L&rsquo;Abri journey began in 2008 when he walked through the big red door at Southborough L&rsquo;Abri and quickly realized his abundant cynicism was a vice, not a virtue. Though a Christian from an early age, this dawning awareness opened his heart to the beauty of Christ and left him a changed person.\n\nIn the ensuing years, Phillip spent time as a helper at Southborough and at English L&rsquo;Abri before enrolling at Covenant Theological Seminary in 2012. After completing a Master of Divinity in 2015, Phillip took up a post as a worker at English L&rsquo;Abri for over two years. While in England, he met a Nashvillian named Christa and returned to the USA to marry her in 2018. He now lives and works in East Nashville.\n\nPhillip is an avid student of the Bible and culture, and finds great joy in helping people navigate the many barriers to Christian belief that proliferate in our distracting, secular world. He geeks out on slow movies, Bach cantatas, liturgical theology, and all things food. He&rsquo;s also the curator of Three Things, a newsletter digest of three resources to help readers better engage with God, neighbor, and culture.\n\nTo receive e-mail updates about the podcast including lecture handouts, articles, books referenced in the lectures and updates about future gatherings, please submit your e-mail address at nashvillelabriconference.com."
