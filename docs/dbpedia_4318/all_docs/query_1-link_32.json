My work is primarily in Iron Age Southwestern Spain (c. 825-550 BC), and in the Middle Bronze-Iron Ages in the Southern Levant (c. 1925-586 BC). My dissertation examines the social repercussions of regional ecoNomic specialization at the site of El Castillo de Do√±a Blanca (Spain), using pottery analysis to shed light on the organization of production, modes of exchange, and techNological inNovation/dissemination among Phoenician and indigeNous potters."
