Dr. Philip Johnston made the bold decision to commit his career to serving in the medically deprived inner city of Indianapolis when he finished his Family Medicine residency in 1973. With the partnership of other like-minded and dedicated physicians, this brave beginning blossomed into a nationally recognized network of now ten clinics with more than a hundred providers. Over those 42 years of practice and 200,000 patient visits, Dr. Johnston saw patients with a mind-boggling variety of medical challenges and very early in his practice life recognized the seeds of a compelling collection of stories - stories that would not only illustrate the challenges of life and healthcare in the inner city, but also serve as a powerful teaching tool for practitioners considering where to best devote their lives. A deep Christian faith - responding to Jesus' promise that the "poor would always be with us" - and a profound sense of "calling" contributed to his lifetime of practice in the same location. Having graduated with a degree from a excellent liberal arts college (Wheaton College in Illinois), Phil has maintained diverse interests beyond medicine. Even after retirement from active medical practice, he plans to continue traveling (especially to visit grandchildren), reading copiously, singing in the Indianapolis Symphonic Choir and other ensembles. He and his wife of 49 years will continue their deep involvement and ministry in their local church, traveling overseas as well as reveling in being able to spend more time tending the gardens and forest around their home.
