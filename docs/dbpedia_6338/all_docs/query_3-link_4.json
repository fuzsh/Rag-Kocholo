        "text": "The US team was originally to have had Ed Conwell but he had to withdraw with asthma, and was replaced by Lorenzo Wright, who had medaled in the long jump. The US won the final quite comfortably, but were initially disqualified for a faulty exchange between Barney Ewell and Wright. On reviewing film of the race, it could be seen that the exchange had occurred within the legal zone, and the DQ was reversed, giving the United States the gold medal. However, the final decision did not become official for three days.\n\nSimon Ammann won ski jumping gold medals on the Normal Hill and Large Hill at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. His victories were a huge upset, as he placed only 17th overall in the World Cup that season."
