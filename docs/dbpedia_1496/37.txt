He was with the Steelers during their run to Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks. He had 18 tackles in the playoffs that season, including five in the Super Bowl, along with a sack of Matt Hasselbeck.

In 2012, he became the first player to support the Black Out Child Abuse campaign, which brought awareness to child abuse through sports. He wore blackout paint on his face for the cause.

He finished his NFL career with 520 tackles, 46.5 sacks and 16 forced fumbles.
