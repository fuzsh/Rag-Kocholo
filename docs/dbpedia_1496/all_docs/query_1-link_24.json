        "text": "A Pro Bowler in 2004, Smith played 13 seasons in the NFL, all with the Steelers. Drafted in the fourth round out of Northern Colorado in 1999, Smith became a starter on Pittsburgh's defensive line the following season, and remained a starter for the rest of the decade. He helped anchor a defense that ranked No.1 in the NFL five times, and in 2005 and 2008, was a key member of a defense that helped the Black and Gold win the franchise's most recent Super Bowl titles. The 2008 defense was one of the best of all-time, as the unit allowed a putrid 237 yards a game. Smith, who didn't miss a game from 2000-06, was forced to retire due to injuries following the 2011 season.\n\nAn undrafted rookie back in 2002, Harrison was cut several times before finally sticking on the Steelers' 53-man roster in 2004. He started in four games that season while recording his first career sack, fumble recovery and touchdown for the Steelers, who went 15-1 that season. Harrison continued to be a key reserve during the next two seasons while helping Pittsburgh defeat Seattle in Super Bowl XL.\n\nHarrison broke into the starting lineup in 2007, after the team released fellow outside linebacker, Joey Porter, that offseason. Harrison was named to his first of five consecutive Pro Bowls that season that included All-Pro nods in 2008 and 2010. In 2008, Harrison took home the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award after recording a franchise single season record 16.0 sacks. Harrison capped off his memorable season with a 100-yard interception return for a score in Pittsburgh's victory over Arizona in Super Bowl XLIII. In all, Harrison totaled 54 regular season sacks from 2007-11 while helping the Steelers win three division titles, two AFC titles and one Super Bowl championship during that span.\n\nHarrison briefly retired following the 2013 season before being coaxed out of retirement by the Steelers several games into the 2014 season. Despite starting in just four games that season, Harrison recorded 5.5 sacks while helping Pittsburgh win their first division title since 2010. After recording sacks in each of Pittsburgh's playoff games in 2015, Harrison led the Steelers in sacks in 2016 despite barely seeing playing time during the first half of the season. He also became the franchise's all-time career leader in sacks while helping Pittsburgh advance to the AFC title game for the first time in six years.\n\nQuite possibly the greatest free agent signing in franchise history, James Farrior came to the Steelers in 2002 after spending his first five NFL seasons with the Jets. Farrior spent a decade in Pittsburgh, earning All-Pro honors in 2004 while helping the Steelers go 15-1 during the regular season.\n\nFarrior and the defense reached the height of their powers in 2008. He helped mentor young linebackers LaMarr Woodley and Lawrence Timmons into major contributors on the team’s run to Super Bowl XLIII. His presence also helped in the evolution of James Harrison, who won the NFL’s Defense Player of the Year award in 2008. Facing the NFL's hardest schedule in decades, the Steelers defense stepped to the challenge. They led the NFL in total defense and were in the discussion as one of the best defenses in league history. While not always in the limelight, Farrior was in the middle of it all, recording 133 total tackles en route to a second Pro Bowl bid along with fellow defenders Harrison and Troy Polamalu.\n\nThroughout his 12-year career with the Steelers, Polamalu consistently made the impossible play look routine. Whether it was a diving tackle, a shoestring catch, or an incredible return of an interception, Polamalu time and time again left Steelers fans (and opposing fans for that matter) looking on in sheer disbelief of what they were witnessing.\n\nAfter breaking into the Steelers' starting lineup in 2004, Polamalu made an immediate impact, earning Pro Bowl honors that season while helping Pittsburgh become the first AFC team in NFL history to win 15 regular season games.\n\nThe next season, Polamalu earned the first of his All-Pro selections, helping the Steelers win their first championship since 1979. Three years later, he made the key interception and touchdown that helped Pittsburgh defeat the Ravens in the AFC title game en route to a victory in Super Bowl XLIII.\n\nIn 2010, Polamalu was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year, joining Joe Greene, Mel Blount, Rod Woodson and James Harrison as Steelers players to win the honor. Polamalu was also an extremely popular player within the Steelers' organization, something that was clear when Ben Roethlisberger spoke on 93.7 The Fan shortly after Polamalu announced his retirement in April of 2015.\n\n“It’s a tough day,” Roethlisberger said. “It’s like a funeral where it’s sad, it’s a sad day, but also a day where you should reflect on the greatness of what Troy is and was to this city and to this team. As a teammate and a brother, he will be dearly missed.”"
