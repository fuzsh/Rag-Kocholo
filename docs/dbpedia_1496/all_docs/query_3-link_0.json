        "text": "American football player (1977–2023)\n\nAmerican football player\n\nClark Cromwell Haggans (January 10, 1977 – June 17, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Colorado State Rams as a defensive end, and was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Haggans played in the NFL from 2000 through 2012 for the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nHaggans earned a Super Bowl ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHaggans played defensive end at Colorado State University. He was a productive pass rusher at Colorado State, where he walked on as a freshman, eventually earning a scholarship. He was a teammate of former Steelers teammate Joey Porter and former Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Adrian Ross. Haggans holds the Colorado State all-time sack record to this day, with 33 sacks recorded. He was inducted into the Colorado State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash 10-yard split 20-yard split 20-yard shuttle Three-cone drill Vertical jump Broad jump Bench press 6 ft 3+3⁄8 in\n\n(1.91 m) 253 lb\n\n(115 kg) 32+1⁄4 in\n\n(0.82 m) 9+5⁄8 in\n\n(0.24 m) 4.98 s 1.67 s 2.82 s 4.21 s 7.12 s 31.5 in\n\n(0.80 m) 9 ft 1 in\n\n(2.77 m) 20 reps All values from NFL Combine[1]\n\nThe Steelers selected Haggans out of the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.[2] He became a regular starter at left outside linebacker in 2004 when the team released long-time starter Jason Gildon.\n\nHaggans recorded six quarterback sacks in 2004, and had nine sacks during the 2005 regular season. Haggans was second on the Steelers defense in tackles for Super Bowl XL, and also recorded a sack, helping the Steelers defeat the Seattle Seahawks. In 2008, Haggans became an unrestricted free agent.\n\nOn March 26, 2008, Haggans agreed to a one-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals. He was placed on injured reserve with a foot injury on December 19, ending his season. Without Haggans, the Cardinals would reach Super Bowl XLIII, but would lose to his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, 27−23.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Haggans was re-signed to a three-year contract by the Cardinals on March 17.[3] In 2009, he would go on to register 74 tackles, 5 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles in 16 games played. In 2010, he had 47 tackles, 5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in 13 games.[4] In 2011, he reunited with Ray Horton who was hired as the new Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator to implement the Pittsburgh Steelers style defense at Arizona.\n\nHaggans re-signed with the Cardinals on June 5, 2012, on a one-year deal.\n\nOn September 2, 2012, Haggans agreed to a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers finished the 2012 NFL season with an 11−4−1 record and reached Super Bowl XLVII, but lost 34−31 to the Baltimore Ravens.[5][6]\n\nLegend Bold Career high\n\nYear Team Games Tackles Interceptions Fumbles GP GS Cmb Solo Ast Sck TFL Int Yds TD Lng PD FF FR Yds TD 2000 PIT 2 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2001 PIT 16 1 22 12 10 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2002 PIT 16 1 44 29 15 6.5 4 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 2003 PIT 16 2 33 24 9 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2004 PIT 13 13 37 29 8 6.0 7 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 2005 PIT 13 13 61 42 19 9.0 7 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 2006 PIT 15 15 77 52 25 6.0 9 1 0 0 0 4 2 1 0 0 2007 PIT 16 16 58 37 21 4.0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 2008 ARI 11 0 19 18 1 1.0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 2009 ARI 16 14 74 57 17 5.0 5 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 2010 ARI 13 13 47 38 9 5.0 6 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2011 ARI 16 16 46 30 16 3.0 5 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 2012 SFO 9 0 2 2 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 172 104 520 370 150 46.5 49 1 0 0 0 24 16 5 0 0\n\nYear Team Games Tackles Interceptions Fumbles GP GS Cmb Solo Ast Sck TFL Int Yds TD Lng PD FF FR Yds TD 2001 PIT 2 0 2 2 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2002 PIT 2 1 4 3 1 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2004 PIT 2 2 7 3 4 2.0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2005 PIT 4 4 18 14 4 1.5 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2007 PIT 1 1 1 1 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009 ARI 2 2 4 3 1 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2012 SFO 2 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 10 36 26 10 3.5 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nHaggans played football, basketball, and track at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School (PVPHS) in Southern California, earning three letters in each sport. During his freshman and sophomore years, he was on football teams that went undefeated. In 1993 and 1994, he was named all-league as a tight end and defensive tackle, while also earning all-division honors. In 1994, Haggans helped lead PVPHS's varsity team to a league title. He had a son named Damon and a daughter named Alianna. He majored in art at Colorado State.\n\nHaggans died on June 17, 2023, at the age of 46.[7] His death was attributed to chronic alcohol use.[8]\n\nIn 2012, Haggans became the first NFL player to support the Black Out Child Abuse Campaign. Black Out Child Abuse, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, with offices in Westerville, OH, was founded in 2012 and serves families and organizations across the country; bringing education, assistance and support to those in need. Haggans wore blackout paint as opposed to the stick on in support of this cause."
