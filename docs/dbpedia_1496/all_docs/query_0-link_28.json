        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Clark Haggans must wait at least a month\n\nlonger to take over Jason Gildon's vacated starting job at inside\n\nlinebacker.\n\nHaggans, who is entering his fifth NFL season, needed surgery\n\nlast week to repair a broken right hand sustained during a\n\nweightlifting accident and will miss at least the first four weeks\n\nof training camp. Two pins were placed in the hand during the\n\noperation.\n\nThe Steelers hope to get Haggans back by Aug. 19, two days\n\nbefore they play Houston in the third of their four exhibition\n\ngames.\n\n\"Giving him two weeks before the season starts, hopefully he'll\n\nbe able to get his timing back,\" coach Bill Cowher said Monday.\n\n\"He'll be able to run ... he'll be able to do a lot of things\n\nconditioning-wise that should allow him to not have to worry about\n\nthat.\"\n\nThe Steelers signed the 6-foot-4, 243-pound Haggans to a $10.2\n\nmillion, four-year contract extension that included a $3 million\n\nsigning bonus.\n\nOnce they locked up Haggans, the Steelers released Gildon, a\n\nlongtime starter who set their career sacks record of 77 last\n\nseason. Gildon subsequently signed with the Buffalo Bills.\n\nHaggans has started four games in four NFL seasons, two last\n\nyear after inside linebacker Joey Porter was shot the weekend\n\nbefore the NFL season started. Haggans had 11 tackles, one sack and\n\na forced fumble during those two starts."
