        "text": "The Arizona Cardinals have re-signed outside linebacker Clark Haggans to a 1-year contract.\n\nHaggans has played the last four seasons with Arizona after eight years with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Last year, he started all 16 games with 54 tackles, three sacks, three passes defended, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\n\nRe-signing him adds some veteran experience at a position where Arizona has high hopes for younger players O'Brien Schofield and Sam Acho. The recent signing of defensive end Calais Campbell to a long-term deal cleared salary cap space to re-sign Haggans.\n\nTo make room on the roster, the Cardinals released linebacker Broderick Binns."
