        "text": "A player like James Harrison is what the Browns do not have and exactly what they need to pump some blood into their anemic pass rush. Harrison is the quarterback-seeking missile fired from the right outside linebacker spot in the Steelers top-ranked defense. Put another way, Harrison has 16 sacks. The entire Browns defense has 17. Harrison, 6-foot, 242 pounds, is a typical Steeler, and one the Browns must deal with Sunday in Pittsburgh if his coach does not give him the day off to rest an ailing hip. He was not a high draft pick. He wasn’t even drafted. Nose tackle Casey Hampton, picked in 2001, is the only player among the Steelers front seven drafted in the first round. Left end Aaron Smith was a fourth-round pick in 1999. Right end Brett Keisel was a seventh-round pick in 2002. Left outside linebacker LaMarr Woodley was a second-round pick in 2007. The Browns did not have a pick that year because they traded it to the Cowboys along with their first choice in 2008 so they could draft Brady Quinn. Right inside linebacker James Farrior was signed as a free agent from the Jets in 2002 and left inside linebacker Larry Foote was a fourth-round pick in 2002. It should be noted that of the starting front seven in the Steelers’ 3-4 defense, Woodley is the only one acquired after 2005, when Phil Savage was hired as Browns general manager and Romeo Crennel as head coach. Crennel wanted to play a 3-4 defense from the start. Savage’s job was to get him those players. When Mike Tomlin took over for retired Bill Cowher in 2007, he kept the same defensive scheme and many of the same players. “That’s one of the good things about continuity within a system,” Crennel said. “Everybody gets on the same page and knows what they’re looking for and are able to go out and try to find those guys. Even though the guy doesn’t work right away, he’s able to show enough that they keep him around and then he develops into a player.” The Steelers found Harrison right in the Browns’ backyard at Kent State in 2002. His success story was not immediate. He was on the practice squad as a rookie and started 2003 on the practice squad. He was released in October and was out of football until the Steelers called him back just before the start of the 2004 season. They needed a linebacker because Clark Haggans broke his hand. “What you put in is what you get out,” Harrison said in a conference call. “I’ve put in a lot of work to get to the position I’m in right now. I’ve been fortunate and blessed by God to have an opportunity to do that. If it wasn’t for the fact Clark Haggans broke his hand way back, I would have never had another opportunity to play ball.” Colts coach Tony Dungy recently said Harrison is the MVP of the NFL. That’s high praise coming from the man who coaches Peyton Manning. “(The Steelers) do a good job of creating one-on-ones,” Crennel said. “Sometimes they have him isolated vs. backs. Harrison has the ability to come off the ball with some quickness, leverage and power. “He can bull-rush an offensive lineman. That’s one of the things that makes a guy with speed and quickness off the edge better rushers. Not only does the offensive tackle have to worry about the speed and quickness, he has to worry about the power.” Harrison was primarily a special teams player his first three seasons. In 2007, the Steelers parted ways with Joey Porter. Harrison took Porter’s job and had 8 1/2 sacks and 80 tackles. His teammates voted him MVP. Harrison is the third major undrafted success story from Kent State this decade. The Browns missed on Antonio Gates in 2003. He is a Pro Bowl tight end with the Chargers. The Browns did not miss on Joshua Cribbs in 2005. Cribbs has his place with the Browns and Harrison has his with the Steelers. Neither forgets that in the beginning the NFL did not find them worthy. “I feel (Cribbs) and I both play with a little bit of a chip on our shoulders,” Harrison said. “To be honest with you, each year when I come in and prepare to get ready for the next season, I’m coming in and I’m that same undrafted free agent that’s fighting for a position and a spot on the team.” Cribbs says he approaches each season the same way."
