Officials said in a statement “no foul play is evident,” but an investigation is on-going.\n\nHaggans spent seven years with the Steelers, helping them claim a Super Bowl XL championship. He also helped lead Colorado State to two Mountain West conference championships.\n\nThe school plans on arranging memorial services."
