        "text": "The sports world has lost another star. Former NFL linebacker Clark Haggans has sadly passed away at the age of 46, a spokesperson from the Pittsburgh Steelers confirmed on Wednesday. The cause of death has not yet been released.\n\nPittsburg radio host Colin Dunlap was the first to report on his passing. He said in a tweet, ‚ÄúFormer Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans has died. He was 46. Haggans played for the Steelers from 2000-07, was a 2000 5th round pick of the organization, and member of the Super Bowl XL championship team.‚Äù\n\nThe Larimer County coroner‚Äôs office released a statement and provided more details. It said that they responded to a residence in Fort Collins, Colorado, on Monday to investigate the death of a male who was identified as Haggans. It was almost noted that an autopsy was completed Wednesday with the cause and manner of death pending further investigation, the coroner‚Äôs office said. No foul play was evident.\n\nRELATED: Ray Lewis lll, Son Of Baltimore Ravens Legend Ray Lewis Dies at 28\n\nRemembering Colin Dunlap\n\nHe was a fifth-round pick by the Steelers out of Colorado State in the 2000 NFL draft. He also spent eight seasons in Pittsburgh and defeated the Seattle Seahawks to win Super Bowl XL in 2006. While playing professionally, Haggans was a full-time starter during his final four seasons in Pittsburgh and finished his Steelers career with one interception, 12 forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, 332 tackles, and 32.5 sacks, ESPN notes.\n\nFollowing his time there, Haggans spent four seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. He eventually retired after one final season with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. He was inducted into the school‚Äôs Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nThe heartbreaking news of his passing has shocked many social media users. While reacting online, one sports fan said, ‚ÄúClark Haggans‚Äô life was obviously so much more than one Super Bowl or the game of football. But he was a key piece to some great Steelers‚Äô defenses. Nine sacks in 2005. Took down Matt Hasselbeck on the opening drive of SB 40.‚Äù Another said, ‚ÄúStill in shock. We think we have enough time until we don‚Äôt. üòî #CSURams #ClarkHaggans #StalwartRam #PittsburghSteelers #ArizonaCardinals #53.‚Äù\n\nA third added, ‚ÄúDamn üíî. Just saw the news of my teammate Clark Haggans. Was a good one man. RIP brother!‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs How Other Sports Fans Are Reacting To News Of Clark Haggans Passing<:h2>"
