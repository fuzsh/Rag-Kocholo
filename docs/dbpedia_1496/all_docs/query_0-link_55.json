A sixth round selection from the University of Miami (212th overall), Chickillo was identified as a prospect, a 3-4 defensive lineman who would be tasked with making the conversion to outside linebacker.\n\nThe Steelers have had a long history of drafting defensive lineman and converting them to outside linebacker. They've had successes: Joey Porter, Clark Haggans, and Lamar Woodley.\n\nAnd they've had failures: Alonzo Jackson, Bruce Davis, and Steven Conley.\n\nAs with most, if not all of these players, the first step in securing a spot on the team by excelling on special teams, something Chickillo did during his rookie season. He recorded six tackles, forced one fumble, and recovered another.\n\nHe even had an opportunity to get in some snaps at linebacker during the team's season finale against Cleveland.\n\nEntering his second season, Chickillo needs to further impress coaches and prove that he's ready to assume a larger role in the defense.\n\n(continued)\n\nhttp://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com...xt-mike-vrabel\n\nI would settle for Chickillo first proving that he can be an adequate NFL starter. At this point, Jones is better than Chickillo. Jones has demonstrated that he is at least replacement level to average at NFL OLB.\n\nChickillo proved he can cover kicks and flash some intriguing potential against 3rd and 4th team guys in the preseason. There have been many Steelers OLB \"camp favorites\" that did the same thing. Only one of them turned out - James Harrison.\n\nI hope Chickillo is great. But until otherwise, I will play the averages and not get my hopes up."
