        "text": "Steelers Nation was shocked to hear about the death of former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans on June 20. One player on the team’s current roster was deeply impacted as well.\n\nIn response to the news of Haggans’ death at age 46 in Fort Collins, Colorado, Steelers rookie cornerback Joey Porter Jr. posted a heartfelt message on social media, bidding farewell to a close friend of his father’s.\n\n“Love you uncle,” Porter Jr.’s message said on Instagram Stories. “You will be missed. Rest in paradise. Never had a dull moment with you! You could Light up any room you stepped in!”\n\nHaggans played seven seasons in Pittsburgh with Joey Porter Sr., from 2000 to 2006. Both were starting outside linebackers when the Steelers won their fifth Super Bowl in franchise history, following the 2005 season.\n\nBefore the NFL, Haggans and Porter Sr. also spent three seasons together at Colorado State, from 1996-98. Porter Jr. was born in July 2000, during his father’s second NFL season. That was also about two months before Haggans made his league debut.\n\nClark Haggans Dies at Age of 46\n\nThe Larimer County, Colorado, coroner’s office officially announced Haggans’ death on June 21. No foul play was evident, an autopsy was completed June 21 “with the cause and manner of death pending further investigation, the coroner’s office said,” according to The Associated Press. 93.7 The Fan’s Colin Dunlap broke the news on June 20 that the former linebacker had died.\n\nThe Steelers selected Haggans in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL draft. He played just two games as a rookie and started only four games combined in his first four seasons (2000-03).\n\nBut in 2004, he became a regular starter for Pittsburgh’s defense, which finished first in total defense, points allowed and rushing yards yielded. Behind that defense, the Steelers went 15-1, which is the best regular season record in franchise history.\n\nThe following season, the Steelers ended the year third in rushing yards allowed and fourth in total defense and points allowed. With an 11-5 record, the Steelers earned the AFC’s No. 6 seed and became the first team to win three road playoff games and the Super Bowl.\n\nDuring the Super Bowl campaign, Haggans had a career-high 9 sacks and 4 forced fumbles. He also had 61 combined tackles, including 7 tackles for loss.\n\nHaggans had 5 solo tackles, 1 pass defense and a sack against the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl victory.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Haggans recorded 21 sacks and 23 tackles for loss in 41 games. He had 32.5 sacks in 61 games over eight years with the Steelers.\n\nWith the Arizona Cardinals, Haggans played against the Steelers in the Super Bowl following the 2008 season. He spent four seasons with the Cardinals from 2008-11 and then finished his career with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012.\n\nIn 13 NFL seasons, Haggans had 46.5 sacks, 49 tackles for loss, 24 pass defenses and 16 forced fumbles in 172 games.\n\nHaggans and Porter Sr. (after he was with the Miami Dolphins for three years) played together for the Cardinals from in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIncluding college, they spent 12 years as teammates.\n\nSteelers Nation Reacts to Haggans’ Death\n\nWhile Haggans wasn’t a nationally recognized star like Porter Sr. and some other players from the mid-2000s Steelers defense, his death caused quite a reaction from people across Steelers Nation.\n\nPorter Jr. was just one of many who shared their reactions to news of Haggans’ death.\n\n“Clark was an amazing football player, but just a great friend, a great person and teammate,” former Steelers defensive tackle Chris Hoke said on 93.7 The Fan on June 21. “This is a tough one to swallow.”\n\nFormer Steelers wide receiver Nate Washington posted a picture of Haggans with the Lombardi Trophy hours after Dunlap’s report.\n\nFormer Cardinals quarterback Matt Leinart tweeted his heartbreak over hearing about Haggans’ death.\n\nLongtime Steelers beat writer Gerry Dulac of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette tweeted that Haggans was “always near the top of” his list of all-time favorite Steelers.\n\nOther members of the media and Steelers fans also shared their memories of watching Haggans and offered condolences on Twitter."
