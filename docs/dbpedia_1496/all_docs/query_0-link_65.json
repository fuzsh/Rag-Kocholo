        "text": "The Cardinals announced Tuesday they have re-signed\n\nveteran\n\nlinebacker Clark Haggans to a one-year contract, according\n\nto a release from the team.\n\n“I’m just excited to be back running around with the boys,\n\nand just sweating and getting sunburned,” Haggans joked.\n\n“I’m very fortunate, very happy, and back at work.”\n\nHaggans, 35, started all 16 games for the Cardinals last\n\nseason, registering 54 tackles, three sacks, three passes\n\ndefensed, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\n\nFor his career, the former Colorado State product has\n\ntallied 495 tackles, 46.5 sacks, 16 forced fumbles, five\n\nfumble recoveries, one interception and 25 passes\n\ndefensed.\n\n“I think that he brings a known quantity to the team, and\n\nhe’s a hard worker,” Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt said\n\nof Haggans. “I think he sets a good example for the young\n\nplayers.\n\n“He knows the defense; it’s good to have those kind of\n\nguys back, competing.”\n\nHaggans figures to take on more of a leadership role this\n\nseason, helping young linebackers like Sam Acho and\n\nO’Brien Schofield, both of whom the team is going to rely\n\non heavily this season.\n\n“It’s a flattering thing, kind of makes you feel old in a\n\nway, but there’s no rocking chair in front of my locker\n\nyet,” Haggans said of his role. “So, just take it and roll\n\nwith it.”\n\nHaggans joined the Cardinals in 2008 following eight\n\nseasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe team released linebacker Broderick Binns to make room\n\nfor Haggans.\n\nArizona Sports’ Craig Grialou contributed to this\n\nreport"
