        "text": "LATROBE, Pa. -- Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans made this same call a hundred times, so he instinctively reached for his cell phone before leaving for training camp.\n\nRing up teammate and fellow linebacker Joey Porter and ask for a ride.\n\nOnly this time, the call would have been long\n\ndistance.\n\n\"I said, 'Oh yeah, he's in Miami,' \" Haggans said. \"Not having him out here is a little bit of a change.\"\n\nFor the first time since he entered the NFL in 2000, Haggans no longer has Porter for a teammate. The Steelers released the former Pro Bowl linebacker in a salary-cap move last spring and Porter, who had played for them since 1999, quickly signed with Miami.\n\nHow the Steelers react without Porter, on and off the field, is one of the big challenges of new coach Mike Tomlin's first season.\n\nThe Steelers without Joey Porter, one of the NFL's loudest, proudest and, at times, best players? Haggans, who was also Porter's teammate for all but one college season at Colorado State, needs some time to get used to this.\n\n\"I've played my college career and whole professional career up to now with him,\" Haggans said. \"I know this: It's a lot quieter now when we stretch.\"\n\nA lot quieter in the locker room, too, where Porter often was the first to defend his teammates, motivate them, drive them. His play at right outside linebacker might have slipped some as the Steelers went 8-8 last season after winning the Super Bowl the season\n\nbefore, but it was obvious the three-time Pro Bowl player remained one of their leaders.\n\n\"Joey's still going to be Joey, but we're still the Steelers and we've still got a season,\" Haggans said. \"We've just got to push forward. He wishes us luck and can't wait to play us.\"\n\nThat will be Nov. 26, when the Dolphins play in Pittsburgh for the second season in a row. Receiver Hines Ward, who has heard so many of Porter's us-against-the-world tirades, still can't imagine Porter talking down to his longtime teammates.\n\n\"I want to see if there's really going to be trash talking, if he really can trash talk us,\" Ward said. \"You can't trash talk your boys, Joey.\"\n\nWard was among the veteran players who questioned whether it was wise for the Steelers to let Porter go at age 30, possibly with some good seasons left.\n\nHowever, the Steelers were convinced they lacked the cap room to re-sign Porter, a decision supported by the $20 million the Dolphins guaranteed him. Porter would have made only one-quarter of that this season in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"We'll miss Joey, there's no question, and he was great at getting guys up each day,\" Ward said. \"But that's how this game goes, players come and go.\"\n\nPlayers like Porter don't come along frequently, and the Steelers know it. It was no coincidence that, for the first time, they drafted pass-rushing linebackers in the first two rounds -- Lawrence Timmons and LaMarr Woodley -- after releasing Porter.\n\n\"He did what great leaders do, and that's make everybody around him better,\" Ward said. \"He's still a great ballplayer and he raised the level of the defense to where it needed to be. It was sad losing him because I thought he had a lot of football left in him. It's hard to replace a guy like Joey Porter.\""
