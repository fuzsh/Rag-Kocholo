        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- A punt was blocked an assignment was missed a penalty was assessed and coach Bill Cowher was furious.\n\nIt was only the first half of the Pittsburgh Steelers' first preseason game and already the mistakes of the AFC championship game were being repeated.\n\nAs Cowher turned and yelled the target was the same as it was in that 24-17 loss to the Patriots in January that kept the Steelers out of the Super Bowl -- the special teams coach.\n\nRight about then Kevin Spencer must have wondered what he had gotten himself into.\n\nSpencer a former Colts assistant hired to clean up the mistakes that troubled the Steelers' special teams last season couldn't have had a much worse debut than Pittsburgh's 16-6 exhibition loss to the Jets on Aug. 8.\n\nJosh Miller's first punt was blocked a too-many-men-on-the-field penalty was handed out and Troy Edwards whose key penalty in the AFC title game cost the Steelers a touchdown was called for grabbing a face mask.\n\nSince then though the special teams have been much improved and as the Steelers go into Monday night's rematch with New England Spencer no longer hears himself being compared -- and not favorably -- to Jay Hayes the special teams coach of a year ago. Hayes was fired two days after the loss to New England.\n\n\"I've been pleased\" Cowher said. \"Kevin has done a very good job. Hopefully we'll be able to make some big plays.\"\n\nThe only big plays Pittsburgh's special teams made in the AFC championship game for were the Patriots and they've haunted the Steelers ever since.\n\nOffensively the Steelers outscored the Patriots 17-10 but the two special teams touchdowns -- Troy Brown's punt return and Antwan Harris' return of a blocked field goal -- kept the Steelers from playing St. Louis in the Super Bowl.\n\nAfterward several players were unusually critical of the special teams with safety Lee Flowers suggesting more starters should play on them this season. It wasn't just because of that one game either; kicker Kris Brown also missed a league-high 14 field goals and the Steelers' kickoff and punt teams ranked among the NFL's lowest.\n\nSo far Spencer's overhaul has been thorough but unlike Flowers' suggestion hasn't been carried out just with starters.\n\nThree of the key special teams players Monday will be rookies punt returner Antwaan Randle El who scored three times in the preseason; kick returner Lee Mays; and Chris Hope who will play on punt coverage. The new kicker Todd Peterson is no rookie but will be playing his first game with Pittsburgh.\n\nHope and reserve cornerback Hank Poteat will be the key men on the punt coverage team. They are the gunners -- some teams call them the flyers -- responsible for getting down field in a hurry to make the tackle or disrupt the wedge around the returner.\n\nOn kickoff coverage Poteat cornerback Deshea Townsend Hope and backup wide receiver Lenzie Jackson will be outside with running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala linebackers Clark Haggans and John Fiala and safety Mike Logan lining up inside to break up the wedges. Logan played outside last season.\n\nRandle El no doubt is the player who will most occupy the Patriots' attention. With his speed and ability to find running lanes the former Indiana quarterback has the potential to make exactly the kind of game-altering play Brown did in the AFC championship game.\n\n\"The only thing that jumps out in the preseason is the return game\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. \"The Steelers have been productive there. They haven't had penalties. They've had positive yardage.\"\n\nIf that can happen all season Spencer may go from being the most-watched assistant coach in town to being the least-noticed.\n\n\"That would be good because that would mean we're doing our job\" Spencer said.\n\nThis story appeared on Page B6 of The Standard-Times on September 8 2002."
