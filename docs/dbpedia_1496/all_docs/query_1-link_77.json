        "text": "BASEBALL\n\nCarlos De la Cruz hit an RBI single in the top of the ninth inning Wednesday night to give the Reading Fightin Phils a 5-4 win over the Portland Sea Dogs in an Eastern League game at Hadlock Field.\n\nPortland rallied from an early 4-0 deficit with the help of an RBI double by Ceddanne Rafaela in the third inning and a two-run double by Marcelo Mayer in the sixth. The Sea Dogs tied the game in the seventh on four consecutive two-out walks.\n\nDylan Spacke and Christopher Troye combined for six innings of one-hit relief after the Fightin Phils scored four runs in the second inning off Isaac Coffey in his Double-A debut. Ryan Zeferjahn allowed the winning run.\n\nThe Sea Dogs remained 1 1/2 games behind Somerset in the Northeast Division.\n\nNECBL: The Sanford Mainers scored four runs with two outs in the top of the ninth inning – aided by two errors, three walks, two wild pitches, two passed balls and a catcher’s interference – to rally for a 7-5 win over the Mystic Schooners in Mystic, Connecticut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Sanford trailing 4-3 and down to its last out, an error allowed Calvin Hewitt to score the tying run. Eddie Eisert scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch, and Devin Bade and Devin Russell both scored on passed balls.\n\nFormer Thornton Academy standout Cody Bowker started on the mound and struck out seven in four scoreless innings, allowing two hits and a walk.\n\nCOLLEGES: Cade Kurland’s ninth-inning infield single drove in the tiebreaking run, and Florida claimed a spot in the College World Series finals with a 3-2 victory over TCU in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe Gators (53-15) will play Wake Forest or LSU in the best-of-three championship series starting Saturday. LSU stayed alive with a 5-2 win over Wake Forest, sparked by Cade Beloso’s go-ahead three-run homer.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nWNBA: Jackie Young made a career-high five 3-pointers and scored 23 points, A’ja Wilson secured her seventh double-double of the season and the visiting Las Vegas Aces cruised past the short-handed Phoenix Mercury, 99-79.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoenix was without Brittney Griner (hip) and Diana Taurasi (hamstring) for the third straight game.\n\nTENNIS\n\nWIMBLEDON: Venus Williams is set to make her 24th appearance in the singles draw at Wimbledon after the 43-year-old American was given a wild-card entry.\n\nWilliams is a five-time Wimbledon singles champion and was a finalist at the grass-court major in 2017, two decades after her debut at the All England Club.\n\nQUEEN’S CLUB: Frances Tiafoe’s winning run on grass was ended by fellow American Sebastian Korda in a second-round match in London.\n\nKorda won 7-6 (2), 6-3, preventing the fourth-seeded Tiafoe from following up his title in Stuttgart last week with another grass-court trophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHALLE OPEN: Daniil Medvedev continued building momentum after recent setbacks as he moved into the quarterfinals in Germany, beating Laslo Djere, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, at the grass-court tournament.\n\nNicolas Jarry upset second-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, 7-6 (7), 7-5, to set up a quarterfinal match against home favorite Alexander Zverev. The ninth-seeded German beat Denis Shapovalov, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nBERLIN OPEN: Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina’s preparations for the grass-court Grand Slam hit a snag when she lost to Donna Vekic, 6-7 (1), 6-3, 6-4, in the second round in Germany.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nNFL: Clark Haggans, an outside linebacker who won a Super Bowl with the Pittsburgh Steelers during a 13-year career that included stops in Arizona and San Francisco, has died. He was 46.\n\nColorado State University, where Haggans starred in the late 1990s, said Haggans died Monday. No cause of death was given.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGOLF\n\nU.S. OPEN: The USGA is bringing the U.S. Open to Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles in 2031.\n\nThe fabled course off Sunset Boulevard is the longtime host of what now is the Genesis Invitational, long considered a favorite by top PGA Tour players. Riviera held the first U.S. Open in California in 1948 when Ben Hogan won with a record score of 276, but hasn’t held one since then.\n\nAUTO RACING\n\nNASCAR: Josh Berry has been chosen by Stewart-Haas Racing as the replacement for future NASCAR Hall of Famer Kevin Harvick, starting next season.\n\nHarvick is retiring at the end of this season, and Berry will be the new driver in the No. 4 Ford Mustang for SHR. Berry will be 33 when he begins his first full season at the Cup Series level."
