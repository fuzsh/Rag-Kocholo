        "text": "BTSC continues to rank the best numbers in team history on a standpoint of thriving over time throughout multiple players. It seems there are a few numbers which are always represented with quality play in Steelers lore. One BTSC author has wondered aloud “what is the most accomplished number in Steelers history?” Through player and jersey value rankings found in Pro Football Reference, we have ranked the most successful numbers in Steelers history worn by multiple players. You won’t see numbers like 12, 58, 75, 31, 32, 52, 59, 36 and 47 as it would be basically ranking an individual player over the other and not the cumulative effort. In today’s submission, we take a look at those ranked 3rd. Enjoy.\n\n3) No. 92\n\nCurrent Wearer: Olasunkanmi Adeniyi\n\nMost Notable: James Harrison 2004-2012 and 2014-2017, Jason Gildon 1994-2003 (pictured below), Jerry Olsavsky 1989 (pictured below wearing No. 55), Keith Gary 1983-1988\n\nCurrent Wearer: Olasunkanmi Adeniyi\n\nJason Gildon was a great disruption to offenses in Pittsburgh and held the title of Steelers sack master for 14 seasons until another No. 92 seized the honor in 2017. Arriving out of Oklahoma State in the third round of the 1994 draft, Gildon joined a stacked stable of linebackers that included Levon Kirkland, Kevin Greene, Chad Brown, Jerry Olsavsky and Greg Lloyd. In fact, comparisons to the five-time Pro Bowler earned him the nickname of “Baby Lloyd”. Because of the talent in front of him, Gildon didn’t become a starter until 1996 but quickly became a standout on special teams. Earning three trips to the Pro Bowl from 2000 to 2002, the First Team All-Pro tallied 77 sacks in his Steelers career, seizing the crown as all-time sack king from L.C. Greenwood in 2003. After three touchdowns, three AFC Championship Games and playing in Super Bowl XXX, Gildon left the Steelers for one last hurrah after ten seasons as a Steeler in 2003.\n\nHailing from Youngstown Ohio, Jerry Olsavsky spent his career playing for three-quarters of the AFC North (excluding Cleveland), but he is known most for being a Pittsburgh Steeler. Drafted in the tenth round out of Pitt, the All American Panthers linebacker started half of the Steelers games as a rookie in the Cinderella season of 1989 and wore the No. 92. Transitioning to the double-fives in 1990, the undersized tackling machine seemed to shine in the postseason with a key blocked punt in the Wild Card win over Houston and six tackles against the Colts in the 1995 AFC Championship Game. He also played for more than half of the defensive snaps in the Super Bowl XXX loss to the Dallas Cowboys. In 1997, Olsavsky left for Cincinnati, but didn’t see action for the Bengals. He ended up with the Ravens and started nine games that season before retiring. Olsavsky was a valuable presence at the inside linebacker position for nine seasons under Chuck Noll and Bill Cowher. Currently, Olsavsky is heading into his sixth season as the inside linebackers coach under Mike Tomlin where he has overseen a strengthening of that particular unit. After all of this time, Olsavsky is a Pittsburgh mainstay through and through.\n\nKeith Gary was the top choice for the Steelers in the 1981 Draft, but the Oklahoma Sooner took his time to get to the Steel City. Gary bypassed Pittsburgh and spent two seasons in Montreal of the Canadian Football League before finally joining the Steelers in 1983. The CFL team was making a practice at the time of throwing big bucks at American players like Vince Ferragamo and Gary. After 9.5 sacks with the Alouettes (renamed the Concordes in 1982), Montreal could no longer afford Gary and he went back to the states. Gary’s debut in black-and-gold was solid as he racked up 7.5 sacks that year. That total includes his most infamous of sacks, a near decapitation take down of Cincinnati’s Ken Anderson on a face mask during a win on Monday Night Football. In six seasons from 1983 to 1988, Keith Gary had a solid career with 25 sacks in Pittsburgh. It makes one wonder what could have been had he come to Pittsburgh first.\n\nJames Harrison took a long road to super stardom in the NFL, but it sure was epic. Harrison was not drafted out of Kent State in 2002 due to his height and weight being lower than desired by teams. The raw rookie joined the Steelers as an undrafted free agent but struggled mightily to adapt. Despite playing on special teams towards the end of 2002, the then No. 93 was released from the practice squad three times in two seasons. Picked up by the Ravens and representing them in the World League for the Rhein Fire, Harrison was released by Baltimore as well. The linebacker considered leaving the game after that last release, but Clark Haggans’ weightlifting injury summoned James back to the Men of Steel. His second stint with the Steelers in 2004 helped Harrison stick in the league for good, and with Jason Gildon gone, Harrison seized the No. 92. Playing mostly on special teams and sparingly at linebacker, a Joey Porter pregame ejection for punching William Green of the Browns led to a spot start and a good game in Cleveland. In Week 17, Harrison took advantage of resting starters and scored a touchdown against Buffalo. The next season, the man they call “Deebo” (for his resemblance to Tiny Lister’s character in Friday) made three tackles on special teams in the Super Bowl XL victory. After Porter was released for salary reasons in 2007, Deebo became the starter in Mike Tomlin’s first season at the helm. What followed was a stellar career that included being named the 2008 Defensive Player of the Year honor, the legendary Super Bowl XLIII 100-yard interception return that earned him a second ring and becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in sacks with 80.5. Harrison’s exit from the Steelers towards the end of 2017 was acrimonious, but the five-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro and two-time Steeler MVP ended up with a storybook Steelers career for 14 seasons.\n\nCheck back soon for the 2nd best jersey in BTSC’s countdown of the most prolific jersey number stables in Steelers history. But first, a recap of the countdown so far."
