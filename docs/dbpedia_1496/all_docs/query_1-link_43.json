        "text": "PITTSBURGH - Ben Roethlisberger's second concussion in slightly more than four months may not keep him out of the Pittsburgh Steelers' lineup Sunday or prevent him from practicing this week.\n\nThe Super Bowl-winning quarterback is questionable for Sunday's game in Oakland, but Bill Cowher sounded Tuesday very much like a coach who expects to have his starting quarterback ready to go this week.\n\n\"He had an MRI done on his brain and neck, and both of those came back normal,\" Cowher said. \"We also did the concussion test, and we're very encouraged by the results. We'll monitor his progress as the week goes on, but again, I emphasize that we're very encouraged by where he is.\"\n\nAsked if Roethlisberger would practice today, Cowher said, \"We'll see how he feels.\"\n\nRoethlisberger was briefly knocked unconscious during a helmet-to-helmet hit with the Falcons' Chauncey Davis midway through the third quarter of Pittsburgh's 41-38 overtime loss in Atlanta. The injury came in Roethlisberger's best game of the season - he was 16-of-22 for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nCowher expects the NFL to review the hit for a possible fine or disciplinary action, as the league does with almost any play that involves a quarterback's head injury.\n\nRoethlisberger was woozy and appeared dazed a few minutes later while being taken to the locker room on a motorized cart, but returned later to watch the rest of the game on the sideline.\n\nHis replacement, Charlie Batch, threw two touchdown passes during a day the Steelers passed for 413 yards in 60 minutes - the most they've had in a game in which their quarterback never stepped on the field past the fourth quarter. Their only better passing day was Tommy Maddox's 473-yard effort in the Steelers' previous game against Atlanta, a 34-34 tie in 2002 that lasted 75 minutes.\n\nRoethlisberger was deemed well enough to fly home on the team plane Sunday night, and he drove his car to a team meeting Monday. Later Monday, he met with a neurosurgeon and took the ImPACT concussion test that many NFL teams use to determine the severity of a concussion and when a player is fit to return.\n\nThe test measures a player's memory, attention, mental processing speed and reaction time. The results are compared to those taken when the player was healthy.\n\n\"He will take the test again later in the week to make sure he is cleared medically before we would subject him to playing,\" Cowher said. \"Again, it's too early to make a final decision on that. We will definitely do so by taking all necessary precautions to make sure he is cleared.\"\n\nThis is Roethlisberger's third significant medical-related problem since June. He also sustained a concussion, and needed seven hours of surgery mostly to repair facial injuries, when his motorcycle collided with a car June 12 in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe also missed the Sept. 7 season opener against Miami after needing an emergency appendectomy Sept. 3. He looked rusty after returning, losing his first three starts, but has looked much sharper the last two games by going 32-of-41 for 476 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions against the Chiefs and Falcons.\n\nBy contrast, he had seven interceptions and no touchdowns in his first three starts.\n\nDespite the Steelers' optimism about Roethlisberger's condition, a football player receiving a second concussion in a relatively brief time can be susceptible to succeeding concussions, according to doctors who have studied the issue.\n\nAlso, a player receiving multiple concussions in a brief time span may need a longer recovery time before playing again than one coming off his initial concussion.\n\n\"I don't take these things lightly and I don't think anybody should,\" Cowher said. \"I think as coaches, we have to know where our boundaries end. We have to leave that up to the people who are professionals. ... If they're not cleared, they're not going to play.\"\n\nSeveral doctors that the Steelers (2-4) use to test their players are those that helped develop the concussion tests and analyze the data for the NFL. The tests also are being implemented on the college and high school level, with several studies done in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nThe Steelers' lengthy injury list includes four other starters who are questionable: linebacker Joey Porter and nose tackle Casey Hampton with hamstring injuries, Clark Haggans (ankle) and wide receiver Cedrick Wilson (groin). Porter has missed the last two games.\n\nLinebacker James Harrison (ankle) and safety Mike Logan (hamstring) are out, and rookie wide receiver Willie Reid (foot) is doubtful.\n\nn FALCONS:\n\nDefensive end John Abraham will miss three to four weeks following surgery to repair a torn lower abdominal muscle.\n\nThe Falcons did not release details on the procedure, but coach Jim Mora said the torn muscle \"is related to but not solely linked to\" the groin injury that has limited the oft-injured three-time Pro Bowler to only two games this season.\n\nThe announcement came as a surprise because Mora said on Monday that Abraham may be able to play against Cincinnati Sunday. The torn muscle was discovered when Abraham was having his groin examined Monday.\n\n\"After rehabbing and working with our medical staff, it was our hope that John would be ready to play against Cincinnati,\" Mora in a statement. \"Unfortunately, a second opinion conducted Monday afternoon confirmed that John will need minor surgery to help him get back to 100 percent. We look forward to him helping us during the home stretch.\"\n\nAbraham, acquired from the New York Jets during the offseason for a first-round draft pick, enjoyed a successful debut in Atlanta. He was named NFC defensive player of the week after having six tackles, two sacks, two forced fumbles and one pass batted away in the Falcons' 20-6 win at Carolina.\n\nAbraham suffered the groin injury late in that game and didn't return until playing about 20 minutes and recording a sack against the New York Giants on Oct. 15. He was pulled when he said he felt the groin tighten, and didn't play in Sunday's win over Pittsburgh.\n\nAbraham, who had surgery to repair a torn groin while with the Jets in 2003, was expected to join Patrick Kerney and Rod Coleman to give the Falcons a potentially dominant pass rush.\n\nInstead, the team will be left with Chauncey Davis as the fill-in starter at defensive end when the Falcons visit Cincinnati this week. Davis recorded three tackles and one sack against the Steelers.\n\nGLOBAL GAMES:\n\nThe NFL will play as many as two regular-season games per year outside the United States starting in 2007, with Mexico, Canada, England and Germany as possible sites for starters.\n\nThe plan, first announced last month, was approved at the recommendation of new commissioner Roger Goodell, who said the benefits of reaching an international audience outweighed the loss of some teams' home games.\n\n\"We are talking about a limited number of games that we think will have a tremendous impact,\" Goodell said. \"It's in response to the growing fan interest in our game overseas. There are more and more fans on a global basis.\"\n\nMark Waller, senior vice president of NFL International, said the league expected to schedule only one overseas game in 2007.\n\nNo specific sites were given for the games. However, Waller said the league hoped to announce the first site by this coming Super Bowl, while the teams would be selected later.\n\n\"Germany has a large number of sites as it's just done the World Cup. UK has a significant number of great sites,\" Waller said. \"We know the sites in Mexico and Canada, so there's no shortage of venues that are interested in these games.\"\n\nThe plan would be set up so that teams would rotate over a 16-year period, with each team playing outside the country twice over that span, once as a visitor, the other as a home team. That means a team would lose one home team during that span.\n\n\"Obviously the league's going to work out the economics and if we lose a home game, we'll get compensated,\" said Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Broncos. \"We're comfortable with it. Obviously we'd like to play in Mexico or Canada and not have to travel to Europe and that's probably the way it would be set up because of our location. But as far as the league's concerned, I think it's a great idea.\"\n\nIn 2005, the NFL staged its first regular-season game outside the United States when the Arizona Cardinals hosted the San Francisco 49ers in Mexico City. A crowd of 103,467 flocked to Azteca Stadium, the largest crowd for a regular-season game in NFL history.\n\nThe league also has played numerous exhibition games overseas for the past two decades. The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will play a preseason game next August in Beijing.\n\nWaller said the international popularity of certain teams would not necessarily determine who goes abroad. He said people in foreign markets were more concerned with simply hosting a regular season game, rather than exhibitions in which the best players tend see little action.\n\n\"The overwhelming preference is the game itself,\" Waller said.\n\nNFL games regularly have been televised live in Mexico and Canada and more recently in Europe, notably Britain.\n\nThe owners also voted to take the league's Web site, NFL.com, in-house after allowing CBS SportsLine to operate it for the past five years. The league plans to relaunch the site next spring with the help of other league-owned media such as NFL Films and the NFL Network.\n\nThe visit to New Orleans was a short one as most owners arrived either Monday night or Tuesday morning and left Tuesday evening.\n\nFormer NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, before he officially left the job over the summer, had called for the regularly scheduled October meetings to be held in New Orleans as part of the league's show of support for the city as it rebuilds from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOwners and the commissioner said they have marveled at the repairs made to the Louisiana Superdome in less than a year and praised area fans for selling out the Saints' home stadium for the whole season.\n\nHowever, Saints owner Tom Benson, while pleased with the progress, said the Saints still have nearly 30 of 137 suites in the Superdome unsold and added that his team lagged behind others in corporate sponsorships.\n\n\"Our hospitality industry especially needs to come forward,\" he said. \"I don't want to finger-point or anything, but we have to work together in order to make this thing successful.\n\n\"The long-term market, nobody can tell right now,\" Benson continued. \"But a year ago, before Katrina, we weren't quite sure and look what we've done. There's no telling what could happen.\"\n\nAs for when New Orleans, which has hosted nine Super Bowls, might get its first since 2002, team owners were optimistic but noncommittal.\n\n\"I don't know about the next Super Bowl in line, but obviously New Orleans has always been a great place to host Super Bowls,\" Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said. \"I'd expect you'd see more.\"\n\nGoodell said the bidding process for the 2011 Super Bowl will begin soon with a decision hopefully made by the next owners' meeting, slated for March in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nThe Saints' lease in the Superdome ends that same season. So without an extension, the league would risk the awkward situation of placing a Super Bowl in a city that is in the process of losing its NFL franchise.\n\nProposals for a stadium in Los Angeles, often cited as a possible future home for the Saints or another small-market team, was discussed, but there was no substantial progress made.\n\nOne increasing concern is projected construction costs now escalating in the range of $1 billion. That makes the project less attractive to the league unless public funding or a possible outside investor materializes, owners said.\n\n\"At this meeting, I don't think (NFL owners) were prepared to pay that for Los Angeles' stadium,\" Benson said."
