        "text": "Pittsburgh 21-10 Seattle\n\nFOURTH QUARTER:\n\n0302: Hasselbeck nearly finds Stevens with one last effort, but time runs out and the Steelers seal their fifth Super Bowl win - their first since 1980.\n\nSteelers head coach Bill Cowher celebrates victory\n\n0258: Hasselbeck misses Mack Strong with a poor effort as Seattle make one last drive towards the Steelers line - Pittsburgh have victory in sight.\n\n0249: Time is running out for Seattle as Pittsburgh edge their way up field, gaining another first down and eating up vital seconds.\n\n0235: Seattle successfully challenge another debatable decision, this time on a wrongly-called fumble, to keep their latest drive alive. But Hasselbeck is sacked for a second time by Deshea Townsend.\n\n0227 TOUCHDOWN PITTSBURGH: Wide receiver Antwaan Randle El turns quarterback and finds the predatory Ward in the end zone with a fine 43-yard pass. Reed's kick extends the Steelers' lead.\n\n0220: Hasselbeck finds Stevens on the one-yard line, but once again the Seahawks are flagged and pushed back.\n\nHasselbeck is then sacked for the first time, with Casey Hampton nailing him on the 30-yard line. His next play is intercepted as the Super Bowl pendulum swings back in Pittsburgh's favour.\n\nTHIRD QUARTER:\n\n0212: Some poor special teams play sees Seattle pinned back on their own two-yard line, but Hasselbeck stays cool under pressure to edge the Seahawks up the field. It is still anyone's game.\n\n0153 TOUCHDOWN SEATTLE: Roethlisberger gets a reality check as Kelly Herndon intercepts a poor pass and rushes for 70 yards. Hasselbeck then connects with Jerramy Stevens from 20 yards to bring the Seahawks back to within four points.\n\nParker heads for touchdown glory\n\n0148: Pittsburgh's tails are now well and truly up, with Seattle starting to miss tackles and looking demoralised. Bettis is back in the game, gaining vital yards for the Steelers.\n\n0140: With the noise in the stadium making it hard for Hasselbeck to call plays, he finally starts to look like a man under pressure. Brown misses with a 50-yard field goal attempt to compound Seattle's misery.\n\n0132 TOUCHDOWN PITTSBURGH: Running back Willie Parker gets the second half off to a sensational start for the Steelers, making a Super Bowl record-breaking 75-yard dash into the Seattle end zone to put Pittsburgh further ahead. Jeff Reed kicks the extra point.\n\nHALF-TIME: As the debate continues over Pittsburgh's touchdown, British rock greats the Rolling Stones treat the 73,000 Ford Field crowd to a medley of some of their greatest hits. With plenty of refereeing decisions going against them so far, Seattle certainly can't get no satisfaction...\n\nSECOND QUARTER:\n\n0055: Seattle kicker Brown sees a 54-yard field goal attempt drift just wide as the clock runs out and the first half ends with Pittsburgh in front.\n\nRoethlisberger goes over from close range\n\n0040 TOUCHDOWN PITTSBURGH: Pittsburgh's pressure pays off as Roethlisberger dives for a TD from a yard out.\n\nReplays seem to show the ball did not cross the line, but the referee backs the initial call on review. The Steelers also kick the extra point.\n\n0033: Roethlisberger finds Hines Ward in the Seattle end zone but he fails to collect the 25-yard pass in mid-air. The quarterback tries again, and this time Ward takes the ball cleanly on the two-yard line.\n\n0024: Hasselbeck continues to have all the time in the world to make his passes, but the contest is bogged down in the middle third.\n\n0015: Pittsburgh talisman Bettis makes his first appearance of the game as the Steelers desperately try to get going on offence. It does the trick as their attack finally springs into life.\n\n0010: The Steelers defence cannot get to grips with the Seattle offence, and Hasselbeck is bossing the game despite the tight scoreline.\n\nFIRST QUARTER:\n\n2358: Hasselbeck just fails with a 40-yard pass to wide receiver DJ Hackett, but Seattle nail the first points of the game with a 42-yard field goal from Josh Brown.\n\nThe quarter ends with Seattle in control but only just ahead, and the Steelers offence going nowhere.\n\n2355: Seattle think they have scored the first touchdown of the game through Darrell Jackson, but referee Bill Levy calls a debatable pass interference penalty.\n\n2350: The Steelers are still suffering jitters going forward, with QB Ben Roethlisberger showing a few nerves on his Super Bowl debut.\n\n2343: Seattle's offence is in the ascendancy, but the steam is taken out of their latest surge when guard Chris Gray is penalised.\n\n2338: Pittsburgh's offence make a couple of basic errors at the line of scrimmage as Seattle demonstrate their unheralded defence is also on the game.\n\n2331: Hasselbeck is sacked by Pittsburgh's Clark Haggans as the Steelers begins to show their famed defensive quality.\n\n2327: The game gets under way, and Seattle have the first down at the 18-yard line. Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck begins to drive the Seahawks upfield, with Shaun Alexander the dangerman.\n\n2325: New England's Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady conducts the toss and Seattle win, electing to receive.\n\nBIG GAME BUILD-UP\n\nPittsburgh are favourites to win their first Super Bowl title since 1980 against Seattle, making their first appearance in the NFL showpiece.\n\nThe Steelers were only sixth seeds in the play-offs, but saw off Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Denver in their bid for a fifth Super Bowl win.\n\nThe top-seeded Seahawks had a fine regular season and have the NFL's Most Valuable Player in running back Shaun Alexander, but Pittsburgh are tipped for a narrow victory.\n\nTheir fans have turned Detroit's indoor Ford Field arena into a veritable home-from-home for the Steelers, with the stadium awash in black and gold.\n\nTemperatures outside the venue are below freezing, but the atmosphere inside is red-hot as Motown legend Stevie Wonder kicks-off the pre-match show, supported by the likes of John Legend and Britain's Joss Stone.\n\nThen an array of NFL legends are introduced, including Jerry Rice, John Elway and \"Broadway\" Joe Namath.\n\nThe teams take to the field, with Pittsburgh led out by veteran running back Jerome 'The Bus' Bettis, playing his final game in his hometown.\n\nAretha Franklin and Aaron Neville share the duties on the 'Star Spangled Banner'."
