        "text": "PITTSBURGH – The Pittsburgh Steelers haven’t played well in openers under Coach Bill Cowher. They are 4-6 in his 10 seasons with the team and scored only three points in the last two openers combined. So Cowher has done a self-critique, and as a result will use his starters longer and put more emphasis on winning Thursday night’s final preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n“We’re changing and it can’t be any worse than the last two openers we played,” Cowher said. “I look at myself, too, and maybe I’ve done a poor job of getting this team prepared. I’m taking a different approach and I’ve explained that to the players.”\n\nLast year, the Steelers lost in Jacksonville, 21-3, and the previous year were blanked at home by the Ravens, 16-0.\n\nCowher, who’s 4-6 in preseason finales, normally plays his starters little more than a few series before pulling them as a precaution against injuries. On Thursday, the starters will play the first half and use the 10 days off before the Monday night opener to heal.\n\n“I don’t worry about the week of the openers. There’s an excitement,” Cowher said. “The last thing we should do is overlook this game. We’re going to come out in pads tomorrow and we’re going to have a good practice.”\n\n“What matters,” said tight end Mark Bruener, “is that we go out there and play well, execute well, and not have to knock the rust off in the first part of the opening game. That’s what we need to do in preseason.”\n\nGood news, bad news\n\nThe good news on the injury front is that linebacker Clark Haggans’ knee injury isn’t nearly as serious as initially feared.\n\nAfter taking a hit on the opening kickoff and leaving Saturday’s preseason game against the Detroit Lions, Cowher felt that the injury was at least a sprained MCL. Sunday, the Steelers learned otherwise.\n\n“Everything was fine. All my ligaments were fine. My knee is OK,” Haggans said. “They said I bruised my fat sac. It’s a little soft tissue under the kneecap. I bruised the bone and maybe tore a little cartilage.”\n\nThe bad news came for wide receiver Troy Edwards.\n\nHis injury in Saturday’s game was thought to be minor, but instead a Grade 2 MCL sprain will force him out of Thursday’s game.\n\nIn addition to Edwards, Haggans and Hines Ward, on the sidelines for Monday’s practice were cornerback Chad Scott (shoulder), inside linebacker Kendrell Bell (ankle), backup running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma’afala (glute) and backup guard Kendall Simmons (hamstring).\n\nScott, Fuamatu-Ma’afala and Simmons might all return for Tuesday’s practice. Bell had his cast removed Sunday and could return to practice early next week.\n\n“He was able to stand up on his toes and that’s always the toughest thing with high ankle sprains,” said Cowher. “He was walking around the training room yesterday and he’s doing very well. We’re hopeful he’ll be on the field next week.”\n\nFirst cuts\n\nThe Steelers released 15 players Monday, including draft pick LaVar Glover and veterans R.J. Bowers and Cory Geason.\n\nAlso cut were rookies Leon Brockmeier (OT), Burke Dales (K-P), D.J. Flick (WR), Pernell Griffin (LB), Bary Holleyman (DE), Bob Jones (LS), Albert Tuipulotu (FB) and Ashante Woodyard (CB).\n\nThe Steelers also cut first-year free agents Eugene Clinton (CB), McAllister Collins (C), Rameel Connor (DL) and Scott Schultz (DL).\n\nBecause of NFL Europe exemptions Joe O’Donnell, Nijrell Eason and Tee Martin, the Steelers are allowed to keep 68 players. They must cut to 53 by 4 p.m. Sunday, Sept 1.\n\nGlover, a rookie cornerback out of the University of Cincinnati, was the first of the Steelers’ two seventh-round draft picks, but became a roster casualty after an abdominal injury had knocked him out of last week’s practices.\n\nBowers played last season with the Steelers and rushed for 84 yards on 18 carries. His best game was the regular-season finale against Cleveland, in which he carried 11 times for 67 yards and a touchdown. Bowers is the all-time, all-divisions NCAA rushing leader with 7,353 yards.\n\nGeason played two years with the Steelers.\n\nThe 270-pound tight end started three games in 2000 and played in parts of 16 games over the last two seasons. Geason caught three passes for 66 yards in those two seasons.\n\nThe Steelers can add up to five first-year players to their practice squad after 4 p.m. Monday, Sept. 2."
