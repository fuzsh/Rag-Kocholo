        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers built upon the momentum they gained during a strong close to 2023. After going _-_ after the bye week and pushing right up to the very edge of a playoff spot, they made key offseason additions that addressed positions of need.\n\nBut the Steelers' improvements on paper were not enough to convince one sportsbook that they won't be outpaced by one of the toughest divisions in football.\n\nBetOnline.ag released their \"Exact Division Position\" odds for the 2023 NFL season and the Steelers have the best odds of finishing fourth in the AFC North at +175. The odds get progressively longer from there, moving to +225 for a third place finish, +285 for second and +500 for a first place finish.\n\nThe Browns are close behind at +190 to finish fourth, followed by Baltimore at +340 and Cincinnati at +800.\n\nThe reigning champion Bengals have the best odds to finish first at +120, followed by the Ravens at +250 and the Browns +500.\n\nIf oddsmakers are correct, the order of finish in the division will go Bengals, Ravens, Browns and Steelers. Pittsburgh hasn't finished fourth in the AFC North since 1999.\n\nMake sure you bookmark All Steelers for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!\n\nSteelers CB Joey Porter Jr. Sends Heartfelt Goodbye to Clark Haggans\n\n5 Sleepers Who Could Make Steelers Roster\n\nFormer Steelers LB Clark Haggans Dead at Age 46\n\nAnthony Miller Release Boosts Three Steelers WRs\n\nSteelers WR Anthony Miller Tweets Cryptic Message"
