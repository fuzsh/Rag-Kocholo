        "text": "Pittsburgh Steelers 70th US football season\n\nThe 2002 season was the Pittsburgh Steelers' 70th as a professional sports franchise and as a member of the National Football League.\n\nThe Steelers were coming off a 13–3 record in 2001 and making an appearance in the AFC Championship game. The team failed to improve their 13–3 record, finishing 10–5–1, although this record was good enough for a division championship. With their finish, the Steelers became the first champions of the newly created AFC North. Bill Cowher's team won the Wild Card Game, defeating the rival Cleveland Browns at home, but lost to AFC South champion Tennessee Titans in the divisional round.\n\nWeek 4 saw Kordell Stewart's final game as the Steelers' starting quarterback, as he was replaced by Tommy Maddox during the game. Even though he did relieve an injured Maddox, Stewart never regained his job as he was released following the season.\n\nAdditions Subtractions QB Charlie Batch (Lions) WR Troy Edwards (Rams) WR Terance Mathis (Falcons) FS Jason Simmons (Texans) K Todd Peterson (Chiefs)\n\nMain article: 2002 NFL draft\n\n2002 Pittsburgh Steelers draft Round Pick Player Position College Notes 1 30 Kendall Simmons Guard Auburn 2 63 Antwaan Randle El Wide receiver Indiana 3 94 Chris Hope * Safety Florida State 4 128 Larry Foote Linebacker Michigan 5 166 Verron Haynes Running back Georgia 6 202 Lee Mays Wide receiver Texas El Paso 7 212 Lavar Glover Defensive back Cincinnati 7 242 Brett Keisel * Defensive end Brigham Young Made roster * Made at least one Pro Bowl during career\n\n2002 Undrafted Free Agents of note Player Position College Matt Anderson Center Texas Will Bouton Linebacker Furman Leon Brockmeier Tackle Northwestern Josh Burr Tackle South Dakota Dallas Davis Wide receiver Colorado State James Harrison Linebacker Kent State\n\n2002 Pittsburgh Steelers staff\n\nFront office\n\nPresident – Dan Rooney\n\nVice president & general counsel – Art Rooney II\n\nVice president – John R.

At this point his Pittsburgh career all but ended when he was benched and replaced by backup Tommy Maddox, who hadn't thrown a pass in the NFL since 1995 with the Giants but had resurrected his career with stints with the New Jersey Red Dogs in the Arena Football League and a championship season in the ill-fated XFL. With the Steelers down 13–6, Maddox found Plaxico Burress for the tying touchdown just before the two-minute warning. The game went to overtime, but Maddox was picked off on his first throw of the extra quarter. The Browns, however, gagged when Phil Dawson missed a 45-yard field goal try. With new life the Steelers led by Maddox marched in range for Todd Peterson's 31-yarder and the 16–13 final.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 0 14 7 8 29 Saints 10 9 10 3 32\n\nat Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nGame time: 1:00 pm EDT\n\nGame weather: Dome\n\nGame attendance: 67,734\n\nReferee: Larry Nemmers\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Gus Johnson (play by play), Brent Jones (color commentator)\n\nTommy Maddox made his first start replacing an ineffective Kordell Stewart.

Reeves' Falcons, however, were surging behind the running of sophomore quarterback Michael Vick. A 34–17 Steelers lead in the fourth could not be held as Warrick Dunn and Vick rushed the Falcons in range for a one-yard Bob Christian rushing touchdown, a Jay Feely field goal, and finally the tying Vick rushing score with 32 seconds remaining in regulation. In overtime the Steelers drove to range of a 48-yard field goal try by Todd Peterson, this after he'd missed a 40-yarder in regulation. The Falcons' Brian Finneran had caught six passes for 72 yards, but in his career debut on special teams he pulled off the play of the game by blocking the kick. Late in the extra quarter Maddox was picked off by Kevin Mathis, but the subsequent 56-yad Feely try was blocked, with one second left on the clock. Maddox launched a desperation heave and Burress caught it, but was ruled down at the one-foot line with the game declared over. This would be the last time the Steelers would tie until Week 1 of the 2018 season.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 7 0 0 16 23 Titans 7 7 14 3 31\n\nat Adelphia Coliseum, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nGame time: 1:00 pm EST\n\nGame weather: 42 °F (6 °C) (Partly Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 68,804\n\nReferee: Tony Corrente\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Gus Johnson (play by play), Brent Jones (color commentator), Marcus Allen (sideline reporter)\n\nMaddox's career nearly ended in tragedy as he threw a pass that Hines Ward turned into a 72-yard touchdown, but after completing just 14 of 28 throws for 194 yards and three picks he was sacked; the hit left him briefly paralyzed and he was taken to the hospital on a stretcher. He recovered from the hit but Kordell Stewart had to come off the bench for what turned out to be his final three games with the Steelers. He completed 13 of 17 throws for two touchdowns and the Steelers also completed two two-point tries. It wasn't enough as the Titans behind 257 passing yards (with two touchdowns) by Steve McNair and 121 rushing yards (McNair and Eddie George accounted for 103 of them) won 31–23.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Bengals 0 14 0 7 21 Steelers 14 3 3 9 29\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 1:00 pm EST\n\nGame weather: 45 °F (7 °C) (Partly Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 60,473\n\nReferee: Ed Hochuli\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Craig Bolerjack (play by play), Craig James (color commentator)\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 6 10 3 6 25 Jaguars 7 3 0 13 23\n\nat Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, Florida\n\nGame time: 1:00 pm EST\n\nGame weather: 53 °F (12 °C) (Sunny)\n\nGame attendance: 55,260\n\nReferee: Gerald Austin\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Gus Johnson and Brent Jones\n\nKordell Stewart made his last start as a Steelers quarterback, running for a touchdown.
