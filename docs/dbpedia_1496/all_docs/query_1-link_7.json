        "text": "Pittsburgh Steelers 73rd US football season\n\nThe 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season was the franchise's 73rd season as a professional sports franchise and as a member of the National Football League (NFL). It was the 6th season under the leadership of general manager Kevin Colbert and the 14th under head coach Bill Cowher. The Steelers failed to improve upon their 15–1 record from 2004 and in 2005, the Steelers struggled. At one point, they were 7–5 and in danger of missing the playoffs but rose to defeat the Chicago Bears on December 11 and started a four-game win streak to finish the season at 11–5.\n\nThe Steelers qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team as the #6 seed and became just the second team ever (and the first in 20 years) to win three games on the road after they beat the #3 seed Cincinnati Bengals (11–5),[1] the top-seeded Indianapolis Colts (14–2),[2] and the #2 seed Denver Broncos (13–3) to become the American Football Conference representative in Super Bowl XL.[3][4] They defeated the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL to secure their league-tying fifth Super Bowl title.[5][6] In doing so, they also became the only team at the time since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to win a Super Bowl without playing a single home playoff game; though the New York Giants would repeat the feat two years later.[7]\n\n2005 Pittsburgh Steelers staff\n\nFront office\n\nChairman – Daniel M.

However, the tactic failed and Houston fans were angered by having to sit in sweltering conditions and watch their team lose.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Patriots 7 0 3 13 23 Steelers 10 0 3 7 20\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 4:15 p.m. EDT\n\nGame weather: 82 °F (28 °C) (Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 64,868\n\nReferee: Bill Carollo\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Jim Nantz (play by play), Phil Simms (color commentator), Bonnie Bernstein (sideline reporter)\n\nNew England quarterback Tom Brady led a five-play, 37-yard drive to Adam Vinatieri's game-winning 43-yard field goal with :01 remaining. The drive countered Hines Ward's 4-yard scoring catch that tied the score at 20–20, but left 1:25 for Brady to march the Patriot offense. On the day, Brady completed 31 of 41 passes for 372 yards, with an interception.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 0 14 0 10 24 Chargers 0 7 6 9 22\n\nat Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, California\n\nGame time: 9:00 p.m. EDT\n\nGame weather:\n\nGame attendance: 68,537\n\nReferee: Jeff Triplette\n\nTV announcers: (ABC) Al Michaels (play by play), John Madden (color commentator), Sam Ryan (sideline reporter)\n\nJeff Reed booted a 40-yard field goal with :06 remaining to lift the Steelers to a win, but a play late in the game caused star quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to leave with a hyperextended knee and left his availability for the following week in doubt. The hit came from Charger rookie defensive lineman Luis Castillo and forced Roethlisberger to the sideline, and backup Charlie Batch merely handed off to Jerome Bettis three times to set up Reed's kick.\n\n1 2 3 4OT Total Jaguars 7 3 7 06 23 Steelers 0 14 0 30 17\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EDT\n\nGame weather: 54 °F (12 °C) (Partly Sunny)\n\nGame attendance: 63,891\n\nReferee: Terry McAulay\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Dick Enberg (play by play), Dan Dierdorf (color commentator), Armen Keteyian (sideline reporter)\n\nTommy Maddox capped a poor performance by throwing an overtime pass into a crowd of Jaguar defenders, and Rashean Mathis made him pay dearly, intercepting the pass and returning it 41 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Subbing for an injured Ben Roethlisberger (hyperextended knee), Maddox completed just 11 of 28 passes for 154 yards, with a touchdown and three interceptions.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 0 7 17 3 27 Bengals 3 3 0 7 13\n\nat Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EDT\n\nGame weather:\n\nGame attendance: 66,104\n\nReferee: Tony Corrente\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Kevin Harlan (play by play), Randy Cross (color commentator)\n\nPittsburgh regrouped following a sloppy first quarter to take an easy win in Cincinnati. After allowing two marches into the Steeler red zone, the defense tightened and gave up only two field goals, then coasted on the heels of two Ben Roethlisberger touchdown strikes and 131 rushing yards from Willie Parker.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Ravens 7 3 0 9 19 Steelers 7 3 7 3 20\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 9:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 56 °F (13 °C) (Partly Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 64,187\n\nReferee: Pete Morelli\n\nTV announcers: (ABC) Al Michaels (play by play), John Madden (color commentator), Sam Ryan (sideline reporter)\n\nUnderachieving against a Ravens team missing defensive standouts Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, the Steelers regrouped on the heels of a late 60-yard drive that set up Jeff Reed's game-winning 37-yard field goal with 1:36 remaining. Ben Roethlisberger completed 18 of 30 passes for 177 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 6 7 0 7 20 Packers 3 0 7 0 10\n\nat Lambeau Field, Green Bay, Wisconsin\n\nGame time: 4:15 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather:\n\nGame attendance: 70,607\n\nReferee: Ed Hochuli\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Jim Nantz (play by play), Phil Simms (color commentator), Bonnie Bernstein (sideline reporter)\n\nWith Charlie Batch starting at quarterback for an injured Ben Roethlisberger (knee), the Steelers capitalized on Packer mistakes – three turnovers – and won despite a lackluster offensive showing. The game's highlight came from Troy Polamalu, whose sack of Brett Favre forced a fumble that Polamalu himself scooped up and returned 77 yards for a second-quarter touchdown.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Browns 7 0 0 14 21 Steelers 0 17 7 10 34\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 8:30 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 57 °F (14 °C) (Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 63,491\n\nReferee: Larry Nemmers\n\nTV announcers: (ESPN) Mike Patrick (play by play), Joe Theismann and Paul Maguire (color commentators), Suzy Kolber (sideline reporter)\n\nThe Steelers handled the division-rival Browns despite another serious quarterback injury. Backup Charlie Batch, subbing for Ben Roethlisberger, broke his hand late in the first half and exited. Beleaguered third-stringer Tommy Maddox inherited a 17–7 third-quarter lead and, despite some miscues, cruised to the win. Wide receiver (and college quarterback) Antwaan Randle El completed a 51-yard scoring pass to Hines Ward in the third, making Ward the team's all-time receptions leader (passing Hall of Fame wideout John Stallworth).\n\n1 2 3 4OT Total Steelers 0 6 0 70 13 Ravens 0 13 0 03 16\n\nat M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather:\n\nGame attendance: 70,601\n\nReferee: Ron Winter\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Ian Eagle (play by play), Solomon Wilcots (color commentator)\n\nAn anemic offensive showing led to a surprising Steeler defeat at the hands of the Ray Lewis-less Ravens. Third-team quarterback Tommy Maddox got the starting nod and completed 19 of 36 passes for 230 yards, with a touchdown and an interception (a bizarre play that caromed off of wideout Hines Ward's swinging foot and was snatched by Terrell Suggs), but the Steelers' inability to handle the Raven pass rush was a serious blow. Maddox was sacked six times and under nearly constant duress. Matt Stover won the game on a 44-yard field goal in overtime.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 7 0 0 0 7 Colts 10 6 7 3 26\n\nat RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nGame time: 9:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: Dome\n\nGame attendance: 57,442\n\nReferee: Bill Leavy\n\nTV announcers: (ABC) Al Michaels (play by play), John Madden (color commentator), Sam Ryan (sideline reporter)\n\nThe banged-up Steelers were simply no match for the undefeated Colts on Monday Night. Indianapolis' first offensive play proved a harbinger for the Steelers, with Marvin Harrison scorching Pittsburgh cornerback Ike Taylor on an 80-yard touchdown strike and a 7–0 advantage. Ben Roethlisberger's return from a two-game absence (knee injury) was a shaky one; his first interception potentially caused a six-point swing, snuffing out a Steeler drive late in the first half and setting up the Colts to kick a field goal, taking a 16–7 lead into the break. Roethlisberger's struggles were heightened when injured left tackle Marvel Smith grew less and less able to deal with All-Pro Colt pass rusher Dwight Freeney & Co., and eventually left with an ankle injury.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Bengals 7 14 10 7 38 Steelers 14 3 7 7 31\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 30 °F (−1 °C) (Flurries)\n\nGame attendance: 63,044\n\nReferee: Bernie Kukar\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Dick Enberg (play by play), Dan Dierdorf (color commentator), Armen Keteyian (sideline reporter)\n\nBen Roethlisberger put up the most prolific numbers of his young career in his return from a knee injury, but he was ultimately out dueled by Carson Palmer. Roethlisberger outpassed his counterpart 386–227 and each threw three touchdowns, but his three interceptions were backbreakers. Ultimately, the Bengals simply made too many big plays, including a 94-yard kickoff return by Tab Perry, for the Steelers to keep pace.\n\nIn a snowy atmosphere, the Steelers snapped their three-game losing streak by ending the Bears' eight-game winning run. Jerome Bettis churned through the snow and mud for a season-high 101 rushing yards, scoring twice in the physical win.\n\nScoring summary\n\nQuarter Time Drive Team Scoring information Score Plays Yards TOP CHI PIT 1 9:16 Steelers Ward 14-yard touchdown reception from Roethlisberger, Reed kick good 0 7 1 2:30 Bears 29-yard field goal by Gould 3 7 2 7:25 Steelers Bettis 1-yard touchdown run, Reed kick good 3 14 3 7:25 Steelers Bettis 5-yard touchdown run, Reed kick good 3 21 4 13:38 Bears Jones 1-yard touchdown run, Gould kick no good 9 21 \"TOP\" = time of possession.

The Vikings had won six straight games, but were pounded up and down the field in losing to Pittsburgh. The Steelers forced three Minnesota turnovers and added a safety in the victory.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 14 6 14 7 41 Browns 0 0 0 0 0\n\nat Cleveland Browns Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 45 °F (7 °C) (Cloudy)\n\nGame attendance: 73,136\n\nReferee: Bill Carollo\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Gus Johnson (play by play), Steve Tasker (color commentator)\n\nThe Steelers turned a nearly flawless performance into a dominating win in Cleveland. The Browns were sacked eight times and were never really in the game. Willie Parker's 80-yard touchdown scamper in the third quarter broke the game open at 27–0. Ben Roethlisberger completed 13 of 20 passes for 226 yards and a touchdown before giving way to Charlie Batch with the game well in hand.\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Lions 14 0 7 0 21 Steelers 14 7 14 0 35\n\nat Heinz Field, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nGame time: 1:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 37 °F (3 °C) (Partly Sunny)\n\nGame attendance: 63,794\n\nReferee: Walt Coleman\n\nTV announcers: (FOX) Ron Pitts (play by play), Tim Ryan (color commentator)\n\nMere weeks after being all but counted out in an extremely tight AFC playoff race, the Steelers clinched a Wild Card berth, trading punches with lowly Detroit and coming out on top. Unexpectedly, the 5–10 Lions leapt to a 14–7 first-quarter lead on two Joey Harrington touchdown passes, but Jerome Bettis tied the game later in the period with the first of his three touchdown runs in his final game in Pittsburgh. Bettis and Willie Parker combined for 176 rushing yards as the Steelers closed out their regular season.\n\nFurther information: 2005–06 NFL playoffs\n\nRound Date Opponent (seed) Result Record Venue Recap Wild Card January 8 at Cincinnati Bengals (3) W 31–17 1–0 Paul Brown Stadium Recap Divisional January 15 at Indianapolis Colts (1) W 21–18 2–0 RCA Dome Recap AFC Championship January 22 at Denver Broncos (2) W 34–17 3–0 Invesco Field at Mile High Recap Super Bowl XL February 5 vs. Seattle Seahawks (N1) W 21–10 4–0 Ford Field Recap\n\nCarson Palmer was injured early on in a tackle by Kimo von Oelhoffen\n\nSee also: 2005 Indianapolis Colts season\n\nThe Steelers became the first No. 6 playoff seed (since the league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990) to defeat a No. 1 seed, and also the first No. 6 seed to reach a conference championship game.\n\nRoethlisberger's game-saving tackle on Harper would later be known as \"The Immaculate Redemption\" or just \"The Tackle\".\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Steelers 3 21 0 10 34 Broncos 0 3 7 7 17\n\nat Invesco Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado\n\nGame time: 3:00 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: 40 °F (4 °C) (Partly Sunny)\n\nGame attendance: 76,775\n\nReferee: Terry McAulay\n\nTV announcers: (CBS) Jim Nantz (play by play), Phil Simms (color commentator), Bonnie Bernstein and Armen Keteyian (sideline reporters)\n\n1 2 3 4 Total Seahawks 3 0 7 0 10 Steelers 0 7 7 7 21\n\nat Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan\n\nGame time: 6:30 p.m. EST\n\nGame weather: Dome\n\nGame attendance: 68,206\n\nReferee: Bill Leavy\n\nTV announcers: (ABC) Al Michaels (play by play), John Madden (color commentator), Michele Tafoya and Suzy Kolber (sideline reporters)\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers became the 4th wild card team to win the Super Bowl.
