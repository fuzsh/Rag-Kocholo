Former Pittsburgh Steelers NFL player Clark Haggans has passed away at the age of 46, shocking the American football world in the process.

The news was announced by a Pittsburgh sports radio host on Tuesday evening, confirming that the Super Bowl XL winner had died.

Haggans was an NFL player for 13 seasons and eight of those came with the Steelers between 2000 and 2007. The Super Bowl victory that he has to his name was in 2005. The Steelers won that game 21-10 and he collected a career-high nine sacks during the campaign.

Haggans' cause of death unknown

A cause of death for Haggans has not been given at this time but "no foul play is evident," the coroner's office said in a statement.

Haggans' other clubs included the Arizona Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers. He reached the Super Bowl again with the 49ers and was in the team that won the NFC title in 2012.

There was a particularly nice element to his drafting in 2000 with the Steelers, as one year prior, they had drafted his college teammate and friend Joey Porter.

"I was happy I was drafted - and to go and see Joey there with open arms. They should have played that Reunited song," Haggans told Steelersnow.com in 2019.

Reflecting on his first NFL game, Haggans said: "I was star-struck seeing Troy Aikman. I used to use him on my Techno-Bowl team," Haggans said. "Randall Cunningham was on their team then and when they snapped the ball, I didn't move. It all happened so fast - I just stood there grabbing my crotch.
