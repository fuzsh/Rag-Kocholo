        "text": "Road where history speaks\n\nThe Hindustan-Tibet Road, also known to us as the National Highway 22, leads to Kinnaur and presents an idyllic picture of life above 12,000 feet. This one conjures up images of a rich past, a valley flanked by the Trans Himalayas and The Kinner Kailash range, a road along the river Sutlej, flowing in from Mansarovar Lake in Tibet in gusto through the narrow gorge. The people are as rugged as the land, and Buddhism prevails alongside Hinduism, a place dotted with Monasteries and Temples.\n\nHistoric Background of Old Hindustan Tibet Road\n\nThe British Governor General of India, Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856) ordered to commission the work of constructing Hindustan Tibet Road in June 1850. Lord Dalhousie wanted to create trade ties with Tibet and this is felt to be the real reason for initiating the road other than his monitoring access to far off regions under British control. Then Commander-in-chief Sir Charles Napier has designed the map of road and immense machinery at the disposal of the East India Company was pressed into service and halfway down the nineteenth century, work on what was then styled as the Great Hindustan Tibet Road began. Beyond Shimla, to the Shipki La pass on the border, the route included a length of 228 miles through Shipki-la till Shipki village in Tibet. ‘Shipki La’ – The pass which the protagonists in ‘Seven years in Tibet’ crossed to get into India.\n\nWhile the Dalhousie road brought the route into focus, the area had long been on one of the peripheral trade circuits of the legendary Silk Route. The path that passed the tract carried goods like musk, borax, wool, livestock, dry fruits, precious and semiprecious stones to and from Tibet, Kashmir, Ladakh and Yarkand. It was basically a mule track constructed and maintained by British. Local traders used to do border trade through other passes also which were Lukma-La (Gongma-La), Yamrang-la, Gumarang-la, Shimdang la, Raniso-la, Keobarang etc. People of Baspa and near-by area used to go to Tibet through Yamrang-la and Chor-Gad valley.\n\nThe Route of the Hindustan Tibet Road\n\nThis road has been featured in the History Channel as one of the most “Deadliest Road” in the world. Built in 19th century, the Hindustan-Tibet road, also known as the Silk route or the National Highway No. 22, begins from Ambala in Haryana, as an offshoot of NH.1.\n\nIt runs 40 Km through Punjab and is known as Ambala Chandigarh Expressway. From Chandigarh, it runs north towards Zirakpur and meets NH.64. Thereafter it goes to Panchkula- Pinjore- Kalka and then enters Himachal Pradesh at Parwanoo.\n\nWith the change in the terrain it becomes a mountainous road, full of hairpin bends and continues north-east up to Solan and then goes northwards to Shimla. It joins the NH 88, where it repeatedly criss-crosses and goes along the Kalka Shimla Rail track, which is an “UNESCO World Heritage Site”.\n\nThen it heads north-east towards the Tibetan frontier from Shimla. About 569 km from Delhi, and 28 km from Sangla, the village Chitkul in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh is the last inhabited village on this road on the Indo-Tibet border.\n\nThe road reaches the border town Khab and then runs for a short distance through Namgial up to the Shipkila pass, and ultimately enters Tibet. Here the Indian side of the road ends at the Line of Actual Control.\n\nActually the road does not lead to the actual border. It closes about 90 km before the border and then rest of the road is under the control of ITBP, the Indian Paramilitary force guarding the frontiers.\n\nThe Kinnaur District\n\nThe major part of the Hindustan Tibet Road passes through Kinnaur valley. It goes along the bank of river Satluj and finally enters Tibet at Shipki La pass.\n\nThe headquarter of Kinnaur district is about 235 km from the state capital Shimla. It is surrounded by Tibet in the east and is the northeast corner of Himachal Pradesh, The valleys of the Satluj, Spiti and Baspa rivers along with their tributaries are enclosed in Kinnaur by three high mountains ranges in Kinnaur, namely, the Zanskar, the Himalayas and the Dhauladhar, The district was opened for the outside world in 1989.\n\nMythology rules\n\nKinnaur is a land seeped in mythology, nurtured and contained, no doubt, due to the inaccessibility of the region. Ancient Indian texts considered the mystical Kinners (people of Kinnaur) as supernatural beings, halfway between humans and gods. The Kinner Kailash range is purportedly the mythical winter abode of Lord Shiva. The Pandavas, too, chose Kinnaur to spend their last year of exile in. Visible from across Jangi, on the old Hindustan-Tibet Road, is a hamlet called Moorang, the name indicating a place where three water channels meet.\n\nRemarkable for the strikingly beautiful mountains surrounding the village, as much for a distinct mud structure crowning a rocky hilltop in the foreground. Silhouetted against the sky and the snowy peaks, it is an antediluvian structure of indeterminate architectural style and age. The Pandava Fort is supposed to have been built by them during their stay here; it presently houses Ormig Devta, the reigning deity of the village.\n\nThe Bhakra and Nangal are two separate Dams. Bhakra Dam is the main Dam that has a reservoir named Gobind Sagar. The capacity of this reservoir is 9.34 billion cubic meters of water, It is one of the most prestigious projects from the Indian Government whose inception was even before Independence around 1945-1946. These two Dams were built over the Sutlej River to control floods in these mountainous areas.\n\nNow if you note the capacity of this reserve it is the third largest reserve in India and has the potential to practically wash out the city of Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Parts of Haryana and Delhi. It has 4 canals in radial orientation originating from Nagal Dam which is the next dam after Bhakra Dam (moving from east to west).\n\nThe purpose of Nangal Dam is to stop the sudden rush of water from Bhakra Dam if it happens so that there is a chance to buy more time to evacuate important cities. Thus if only the Bhakra dam fails, the Nangal dam can control the severity of the damage to a major extent.\n\nNow if you ask what if both dams fail back to back: If this happens then several low-lying areas especially from Punjab and Haryana will get flooded. And from Punjab, there are 5 rivers and the land between these rivers is quite plain and thus these two states will be hit severely. Major cities would include Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Ferozepur, Rupnagar, Anandpur Sahib, Kalka and Ambala City.\n\nApart from physical damages, the states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Gujarat have stakes in Hydroelectricity generated from these dams which will also affect them. Northern Grid will also be affected. Up to what extent I have no idea to comment. Other minor industries such as tourism will also get hampered.\n\nAs such B-N Dam is very important to the economy of the states involved. And if it fails it is a huge loss. Another major project which has come up in Uttarakhand is Tehri Dam which is again a very ambitious one, and its failure will be more devastating in comparison to B-N Dam.\n\nBhakra and Nangal: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nLocated in the picturesque state of Himachal Pradesh, Bhakra and Nangal are home to a substantial population. These cities serve as the epicentre of economic activities and offer a vibrant lifestyle to their residents. However, the collapse of the Bhakra Nangal Dam would have dire consequences for both cities, affecting various aspects of life, infrastructure, and economy.\n\nThe Devastation of Surrounding Areas\n\nThe ripple effect of a dam collapse would extend well beyond the cities themselves. The surrounding regions, including nearby towns and villages, would bear the brunt of the disaster. The sudden release of water could result in severe flooding, leading to loss of life, displacement of residents, and widespread damage to infrastructure.\n\nAgricultural Heartland in Peril\n\nThe fertile lands in the vicinity of the Bhakra Nangal Dam have long served as the agricultural heartland of the region. However, a dam collapse would submerge vast areas of arable land under the deluge, leading to devastating consequences for the agricultural sector. The loss of crops, disruption of irrigation channels, and contamination of soil would severely impact the livelihoods of farmers and the overall food production in the area.\n\nEnvironmental Implications: An Ecosystem Under Threat\n\nBeyond human settlements and economic activities, the ecological ramifications of a dam collapse would be profound. The Bhakra Nangal Dam is situated amidst a fragile ecosystem, supporting diverse flora and fauna. The sudden release of water would result in habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and an imbalance in the delicate ecosystem. The long-term impact on wildlife and the surrounding environment cannot be overstated.\n\nPower Crisis: Plunging into Darkness\n\nThe Bhakra Nangal Dam plays a vital role in power generation, contributing significantly to the electricity needs of the region. Its collapse would lead to a severe power crisis, leaving millions in darkness. The disruption to industries, businesses, and households would have far-reaching consequences for the local economy and quality of life.\n\nNavigating the Aftermath: Rehabilitation and Reconstruction\n\nIn the event of a dam collapse, the foremost priority would be the rescue and rehabilitation of affected individuals and communities. Adequate measures for disaster management, including emergency response, medical aid, and temporary shelter, would be essential. Additionally, the subsequent reconstruction efforts to restore infrastructure, revive agriculture, and rehabilitate the affected areas would require substantial resources and meticulous planning.\n\nThe potential collapse of the Bhakra Nangal Dam would have catastrophic effects on Bhakra, Nangal, and the surrounding regions. The loss of lives, displacement of communities, damage to infrastructure, environmental degradation, and power crisis are among the many challenges that would be faced. It is imperative to understand the gravity of such a scenario and work toward preventing such a disaster through robust maintenance, safety protocols, and constant vigilance. By safeguarding this engineering marvel, we can ensure the well-being and prosperity of the people and the environment it serves.\n\nSometimes the stories related to a so-called haunted place get so mixed up that rather than being a legend, it all starts to sound like a fairy tale. As the word gets passed on from person to person, generation to generation, people keep adding their own spice to it and pretty soon, even something already as fictional as a ghost story starts to sound even more childish. One such legend or myth is of the Barog tunnel on the Kalka-Shimla railway.\n\nOften known as the queen of hills, Shimla was first settled by the British shortly after the first Anglo-Gurkha war in 1816. By 1830, it had developed as a major base for the British and by 1864, it was declared the summer capital of British India. For ease of transport, the foundation of a narrow gauge railway from Kalka to Shimla was laid by the British in 1898.\n\nConstruction officially began in 1900 and was completed within a short span of 3 years. Inaugurated by Lord Curzon on November 9th 1903, this railway was declared a heritage property by the Indian government more than 100 years later in 2007. In July 2008, the Kalka–Shimla Railway was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nCovering a distance of almost 100 km from Kalka to Shimla, this railway now passes through a mostly mountainous route, covering 18 stations, 864 bridges and 102 tunnels. At the time it was built, the total station count was 20 and operational tunnels were 107 but over time, 2 of the stations were abandoned and 5 tunnels were discarded.\n\nIt is one of these 102 left tunnels that the ghost stories are related to but the funny part is that no one can tell which tunnel for sure. If you made the mistake of asking any of the railway employees, they would start laughing considering you a total idiot for believing it.\n\nBarog is a small village located around 43 km and the 8th station on the railway from Kalka. This place was settled during the railroad construction between the years 1900 – 1903 and was named after an engineer called Barog who was involved in laying down the tracks. Tunnel No. 33 of this railway is just before Barog and it is said that Engineer Barog was in charge of building this tunnel.\n\nThe very fact that this railroad was completed within 3 years in times when technology was still in its diapers proves that all the work was being done in a hurry. To complete the tunnel in a very short period, as per the legend, Engineer Barog started digging Tunnel 33 from both sides of the mountain. There were no satellites, no GPS or radars in those days so it was pretty much Engineer’s calculations and measurements to ensure that diggings at both ends were in alignment with each other.\n\nTragically, Barog’s calculations proved to be incorrect and upon reaching the centre of the mountain, it was realized that the tunnel was not aligned and the workers were just digging two different tunnels in different directions, going right past each other. This was heavily criticized by the British government and Barog was removed from his duties as in charge of the tunnel after paying Rs. 1 as a fine.\n\nIt is said that he became the laugh of the town and the centre of all the jokes of British officers and even the Indian workers. Unable to cope with the humiliation, Barog one day just walked into the tunnel and shot himself inside. He has buried nearby the tunnel and the village was named after him.\n\nWork of the tunnel however was carried on at a different site after him under the supervision of Chief Engineer H.S. Harrington and a local sage, Bhalku. The tunnel that Barog was digging was abandoned and Harrington dug up a new tunnel that is operational today as Tunnel 33.\n\nThis entire story is what finally gave birth to the most popular haunting story of this railroad. As per the legend, Barog’s soul still haunts the tunnel that he could not finish and which eventually became the reason for his suicide. He is however believed to be a friendly ghost who would not even shy away from having a friendly chat with the living.\n\nPeople here often tell stories of how they went for a walk in the tunnel, met Barog’s ghost, and even sat down with him and shared a laugh. He seems to have told many people that his soul is trapped inside the tunnel for all eternity, never being able to leave it and depart for the heavenly abode. It is believed that if you walked into the tunnel and yelled out his name, he would definitely answer.\n\nIf the story ended here, it would still sound a little convincing. Someone dies in a place and haunts it forever, we all have heard that before but this is not the only legend of this railroad. In total, there are 5 different stories related to the hauntings here, including the ones involving Barog.\n\nThe second legend and my favourite one is of a werewolf. It is said that the tunnel was not abandoned because Barog could not align it but because of the mysterious deaths of the local workers. Several of the workers and even the British engineers were attacked and killed by an animal late at night. People sleeping in their tents were dragged out and were found the next day half eaten which led people to believe that there was a wild animal at loss.\n\nBarog along with a hunting party set out one night to hunt down the animal but what they found that night was beyond anyone’s belief. Barog was the only survivor from the hunting party and described the attacker as half human and half wolf, standing over 7 ft straight on his legs. The story soon caught fire among the educated English class and turned Barog into a laughing stock as nobody believed it.\n\nBarog was relieved from his duties after being labelled as mentally unstable for inventing such stories. Unable to bear the humiliation, he committed suicide but even after him, the English could not get local workers back to work in the same tunnel. They were all too scared of the incident, of the werewolf, and refused to work in the same tunnel stating that it was within the werewolf’s territory. After a lot of persuasions, the British finally gave up and started to dig a new tunnel.\n\nAs per the third story, this tunnel is haunted by a witch clad in a white saree. She is believed to have red glowing eyes that can hypnotize people and have them walk into the tunnel following the witch. Anyone who entered the tunnel under the spell of the black Witch was never seen again.\n\nAs per the fourth legend, people claim to have seen a beautiful woman clad in a black saree holding a child to her bosom. It is believed that this woman is not even aware of the fact that she s dead. If anyone ever ran into her, she just looks at the other person as if in some kind of disbelief, with a look in her eyes that almost seems to be a cry for help.\n\nShe looks at the child that she holds several times before starting to scream in pain and run into the walls of the tunnels to vanish. If we are to believe this story, this woman was a local who was killed by a motorist near the tunnel while she was still pregnant with her first baby.\n\nAnd the fifth legend is of a sinister ghost of a signalman, holding a green light in his hands. He seems to lure people into the tunnel by waving the green lantern in his hand and anyone who ever followed the light was never seen again. No one knows for sure who this murderous signalman was.\n\nThe most interesting part of all these stories is that the tunnel changes every time they are told. Some people say that the haunting site is Tunnel 33, the one right before Barog, while others will say it is Tunnel 103 which happens to be the last tunnel on the route, just before Shimla.\n\nSome people claim it to be Tunnel 23 which would fall several kilometres before Barog. Some would tell these stories as hauntings related to abandoned tunnels of railway which would be a total of five considering that the original route had 107 tunnels initially. In 1930, four of the tunnels were discarded and then again in 2006, Tunnel 46 was dismantled as well.\n\nSo if we are to believe that the hauntings happen in an abandoned tunnel, then it would become tunnel 46 because the other 4 abandoned tunnels have long collapsed with no one using them in almost a century. The sign board reads of a tunnel that Barog was building and which happens to be around a kilometre away from the current 33rd tunnel but this would again point to the haunting site being an entirely different one.\n\nIf you want to go ghost hunting yourself, your best bet is to start walking from Kalka towards Shimla on foot, following the tracks, crossing all the 104 tunnels on the way including abandoned tunnel 46 and that would also give you a chance to find the other 4 long discarded tunnels. Even in the myth, there is no certainty which tunnel is actually haunted so you will have to search all of them.\n\nIf you plan to do that, please keep a close watch for the train because if you happen to be inside one of the narrow tunnels while a train crosses it, chances are that you would also become part of the legend with your ghost haunting that particular tunnel. And if you do happen to meet Barog in any of the tunnels, say “Howdy” for me.\n\nThe most interesting thing that I found about this railroad is that it is a very scenic and enjoyable journey. Barog tunnel on the other hand is not significant because it is haunted but because it is the longest tunnel on this railway and is the straightest tunnel in the World."
