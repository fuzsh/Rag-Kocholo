        "text": "I came to know that the road was built by the British Rulers, in order to create the trade links with Tibet and to initiate the monitoring access to far off regions under the government control.\n\nThe British Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856), ordered the commissioning of the construction work of Hindustan Tibet Road in June 1850.\n\nHere it is pertinent to mention that the timing of the construction of the road coincided with the historic moment of sending the “Young Husband Mission” to Tibet.\n\n“Sir Charles Napier”, the then Commander-in-chief of British Army in India, designed the map of the road. The entire resources and immense machinery at the disposal of the East India Company were put into the service for the execution of the project. Hence the work on the Great Hindustan Tibet Road began, which continued for the rest of the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nReasons for the Construction of the Road\n\nThere were various reasons for constructing the road to Tibet. At that time the system of forced labour without salary called “begari” was prevalent in the hill states of Himachal Pradesh. These unpaid labourers were pressed into all types of service like transport of timber, goods and even the Govt. files to Shimla.\n\nThe Governor-General Lord Dalhousie was greatly disturbed by this system and he wanted to improve the conditions of the road these men trudged for errands. Therefore for his own trip to Kalpa in Kinnaur district, and to create trade ties with Tibet. he ordered the commissioning of the Hindustan-Tibet road.\n\nEnds of the Road\n\nThe Southwest end of the road is at Ambala in Haryana, while the Northeast end is at Khab in Himachal Pradesh. Beginning from Kalka, the first lap went up to Sanjauli at Shimla and was used for the vehicular traffic by 1860. Thereafter a 560 feet long traffic tunnel was constructed beyond Sanjauli in Shimla.\n\nThe stretch of 228 miles of the route from Shimla to the Shipki La pass on the Indo- Tibet border goes up to Shipki village in Tibet. It is the same “Shipki La” pass through which the author of “Seven years in Tibet” came to India.\n\nThe Significance of the Road\n\nThis mule track built and maintained by the British was brought into focus by Lord Dalhousie, but the area had long been on the ancient “Silk Route” to China.\n\nThe items like musk, borax, wool, livestock, dry fruits, precious and semi-precious stones were traded across the route to Tibet, Kashmir, Ladakh, and Yarkand, ever Since 1300 BC.\n\nFor inter-border trade the local traders used other passes also, like Lukma-La or Gongma-La pass; Yamrang-la pass; Gumarang-la pass: Shimdang la pass; Raniso-la pass; Keobarang pass etc. The traders of Himachal belonging to the Baspa valley and the adjoining areas used Yamrang-la pass and the Chor-Gad valley area to reach Tibet.\n\n“Seven Years in Tibet”"
