        "text": "winds flowed from Oceans flow towards landmass in summer.  This air flow from sea to land bring heavy rainfall to the Indian subcontinent. Winter Monsoon  In winter the sun’s apparent path is vertically over the Tropic of Capricorn.  The north western part of India grows colder than Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal and the flow of the monsoon is reversed.  The basic idea behind Classical theory is similar to land and sea breeze formation except that in the case of monsoons the day and night are replaced by summer and winter. Figure 6.4 Classical Theory: Sir Edmund Halley’s Theory Drawbacks: The monsoons do not develop equally everywhere on earth and the thermal concept of Halley fails to explain the intricacies of the monsoons such as the sudden burst of monsoons, delay in on set of monsoons sometimes. 6.5 DYNAMIC THEORY: BY FLOHN It was propounded by Flohn, a German Meteorologist, in 1951. The theory was further enriched by the research works of Krishna Rao (1952). 100 CU IDOL SELF LEARNING MATERIAL (SLM)\n\n Flohn, monsoon is the result of seasonal migration of planetary winds and pressure belts.  The trade winds from both the hemispheres converge near equator and form  Inter Tropical Convergence (ITC) zone. The northern and southern limits of ITC are known as NITC and SITC.  A narrow belt of doldrums lies in between NITC and SITC and is characterized by ‘equatorial westerly’s.  During summer solstice, trade winds of southern hemisphere (south-east trade winds) extend and shift northward. The south-east trades in association with equatorial westerly’s produce south-west or summer monsoon around summer solstice when sun is overhead at tropic of Cancer.  during winter solstice trade winds of northern hemisphere (northeast trade winds) extend and shift southward from their normal position. Similarly, around winter solstice when sun is overhead at tropic of Capricorn, north-east trades in association with equatorial westerly’s produce north- west or winter monsoon.  Thus, shifting position of pressure and wind belts due to dynamic motion of the earth is responsible for the origin of monsoon and reversal of wind patterns in the tropics. Figure 6.5 Dynamic Theory 101 CU IDOL SELF LEARNING MATERIAL (SLM)\n\nFigure 6.6 Explanation of Theory Criticisms/ Limitations:  Theory does not take into account the role of upper air circulation which remains significant in maintaining the rhythm of monsoon for a fairly long period and over extensive areas in tropics.  Theory also seems to have ignored the oceanic circulation and temperature gradient in oceanic waters. The position of air masses (warm/cold) and their gradual shift from tropics is one of the potent factors that affect the origin of monsoon. Theory does not seem to include these vital elements. 6.6 MAJOR TYPES OF CLIMATE FOUND IN INDIA ARE AS FOLLOWS: The climate of India has distinct regional variations discernible by the pattern of winds, temperature, and rainfall; further, also in the form of rhythm of seasons and the degree of wetness or dryness. 1. The Cold Weather Season(December-February) 2. The Hot Weather Season(March-May) 3. The Rainy Season(June-September 4. The Season of Retreating South-west Monsoon (October-November). Cold Weather Season: 102 CU IDOL SELF LEARNING MATERIAL (SLM)\n\nJanuary and February are the coldest months of this season. The temperature is between 10°C to 15°C in Northern India and about 25°C in Southern India. Pressure: north of the Himalayas develops a high pressure center. This high pressure center gives rise to the flow of air at the low level from the north towards the Indian subcontinent (i.e. south of the mountain range). Winds: All of Western and Central Asia remains under the influence of westerly winds (known as Jet Stream) along the altitude of 9-13 km from west to east. These winds blow across the Asian continent at the latitudes, north of the Himalayas, roughly parallel to the Tibetan highlands. Tibetan highlands act as a barrier in the path of these jet streams, as a result of this; the jet streams get bifurcated into two branches. One branch is located to the south of the Himalayas, while the second branch is positioned to the north of Tibetan Plateau. Rainfall: The western cyclonic disturbances, which enter the Indian subcontinent from the west and the northwest during the winter months, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and are brought into India by the westerly jet stream and give rainfall. Hot Weather Season: The North Indian region experiences a well-defined hot weather season during the month of April and May. Temperature starts rising by the middle of March and by mid- May, Mercury touches 41° to 42°C. Temperature even exceeds 45°C in areas of central and north-west India. A. April, May, and June are the months of summer in north India. B. Pressure: middle of July, the low pressure belt nearer the surface (ITCZ) moves northwards. C. Wind: the wind circulation over the subcontinent undergoes a complete reversal at both, the lower as well as at the upper levels. In the heart of the ITCZ in the northwest, the dry and hot winds known as Loo, blow in the afternoon. D. Rainfall: Towards the end of the summer, there are pre-monsoon showers, which are a common phenomenon in Kerala and coastal areas of Karnataka. This phenomenon is locally known as mango showers, as it helps in the early ripening of mangoes. The Rainy Season: The inflow of south-westerly monsoon in India brings the season of rain in India. The Indian sub-continent receives the bulk of its rainfall during the south-west monsoon period. This moist air current causing rainfall in India is popularly known as the southwest monsoon. 103 CU IDOL SELF LEARNING MATERIAL (SLM)\n\nSimultaneously, an easterly jet stream flows over the southern part of the Peninsula in June. The southwest monsoon, which is a continuation of the southeast trades, get deflected towards the Indian subcontinent after crossing the Equator. The easterly jet stream is held responsible for the burst of the monsoon in India. The southwest monsoon sets first over the Kerala coast by 1st1st of June and then moves swiftly to reach Mumbai and Kolkata between 10th10th and 13th13thJune. Further, by mid-July, southwest monsoon engulfs the entire sub-continent. Southwest monsoon gets divided into two branches − the Arabian Sea, causing rain in western coast of India and the Bay of Bengal branch, causing rain in eastern coast to India. Winter monsoons do not cause rainfall, as they move from land to the sea. Hence, primarily, they have little humidity; and secondly, due to anticyclonic circulation on land, the possibility of rainfall from them reduces. However, in northwestern India, some weak temperate cyclones coming from the Mediterranean Sea (with little moisture) cause rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and western Uttar Pradesh. The Season of Retreating Monsoon: The south-west monsoon begins to retreat from northern India by the second week of September. weather during the season is characterized by high day temperatures, but nights are pleasant with the mean minimum temperature going down to 20°C or even lower. On the other hand, during October and November, northeast monsoon while crossing over the Bay of Bengal, picks up moisture and causes torrential rainfall over the Tamil Nadu coast, southern Andhra Pradesh, southeast Karnataka, and southeast Kerala. 6.7 SUMMARY  The climate of India may be broadly described as tropical monsoon type. The term “monsoon” is derived from Arabic word ‘mausim’ which means seasonal reversal in the wind direction. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) designates four official seasons: 1. winter (From December to early April); 2. Summer or Pre-monsoon season (April to July in north-western India); 3. Monsoon or Rainy season (June-September); 4. Post-monsoon season (October-December).  But traditionally, Indian note six seasons, each about two month long. These are spring (Sanskrit- Vasanta), late autumn (Hemanta) and winter (Shishira). These are\n\nbased on the astronomical division of the 12 months into six parts. The ancient Hindu calendar also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.  The climate of India is described as a monsoon type. This type of climate is found in south and southeast Asia. However, there are variations in climatic conditions in the country itself. The coastal regions of India show the least amount of difference between the temperatures of night and day. In the interior regions, the difference in temperatures of day and night is huge.  Climatic controls are the factors that control the variations in temperature in the climate of India. There are six major climatic controls. They are:  Latitude: As the earth is round, sunlight does not reach everywhere equally. The temperature decreases as we move from the equator to the poles.  Altitude: As we move from the surface of the earth to the higher altitudes, the temperature decreases.  Pressure and wind system: The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of that place. Thus, it influences the temperature accordingly.  Distance from the sea: Coastal regions are cooler as compared to interior regions. As the distance from the sea increases, its influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions.  Ocean currents: Cold ocean currents flowing over a region will decrease the temperature of that area whereas warm currents will increase the temperature.  Relief features: Relief features are the barriers that block currents from entering the country. High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds. 6.8 KEYWORDS  The Tropic of Cancer: which is also referred to as the Northern Tropic, is the most northerly circle of latitude on Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead.  Economy of India: The economy of India is characterized as a developing market economy. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).  Climate Change: Climate change includes both the global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases, and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.  Katabatic Wind: A katabatic wind is a drainage wind, a wind that carries high- density air from a higher elevation down a slope under the force of gravity.  Tectonic Plate: Plate tectonics is a scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of Earth's lithosphere, 6.9 LEARNING ACTIVITY\n\n1.

Tourism geography covers a wide range of interests including the environmental impact of tourism, the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism. Tourism geography is that branch of human geography that deals with the study of travel and its impact on places. Geography is fundamental to the study of tourism, because tourism is geographical in nature. Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people. Physical geography provides the essential background, against which tourism places are created and environmental impacts and concerns are major issues, that must be considered in managing the development of tourism places. The approaches to study will differ according to the varying concerns. Much tourism management literature remains quantitative in methodology and considers tourism as\n\nconsisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations .Recent developments in human geography have resulted in approaches such as those from cultural geography, which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the sense of place at a destination. The Tourist by Dean MacCannell and The Tourist Gaze by John Urry are classics in this field. 7.2 NATURE AND STATE OF INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN INDIA Today tourism is the largest service industry in India with a contribution of 6.23% to national GDP and providing 8.78% of the total employment in the year 2011. On an average more than 5 million foreign tourist arrivals and 562 million domestic tourists visits are witnessed by India annually. India is ranked 68th among the world’s 139 most attractive destinations and scores very high on natural resources (ranked 8th) and cultural resources (24th); with 30 world heritage sites and strong creative industries in the country. India’s air transport network is ranked 39th, the ground transport infrastructure however remains underdeveloped (ranked43rd). India is ranked first with regard to tourism air attendance. The promotional campaigns and marketing strategies to attract tourists remain average (ranked53rd). The World Economic Forum study states that India also benefits from excellent price competitiveness, ranked 6th overall, with low ticket-taxes and airport charges along with low prices in the economy as a whole. These rankings are based on the Travel & Tourism Competitive Index (TTCI) 2011, which measures the different regulatory and business related issues. Moreover, India has been ranked the “best country brand for value for money” in the Country Brand Index (CBI) survey conducted by Future Brand, a leading global brand consultancy in the year 2011. India also claimed the second place in CBI‟ s „best country brand for history‟ , as well as appears among the top 5 in the best country brand for authenticity of art and culture and the fourth best new country for business. India made it to the list of „rising stars‟ or the countries that are likely to become major tourist destinations in the next five years, led by the United Arab Emirates, China and Vietnam. 7.3 INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN VARIOUS STATES OF INDIA Rajasthan\n\nFigure 7.1 Rajasthan Rajasthan is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India, for both domestic and international tourists. Rajasthan attracts tourists for its historical forts, palaces, art and culture with its slogan 'Padharo mahare desh'. Every third foreign tourist visiting India travels to Rajasthan as it is part of the Golden Triangle for tourists visiting India. The palaces of Jaipur, lakes of Udaipur, and desert forts of Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer are among the most preferred destinations of many tourists, Indian and foreign. Tourism accounts for eight percent of the state's domestic product. Many old and neglected palaces and forts have been converted into heritage hotels. It is the most beautiful place in India with heritage of old buildings build up years ago by Maharaja's of different castes. Famous places in Rajasthan Rajasthan is known for its historical hill forts & palaces; it is claimed as the best place for tourism-related to palaces. a. Umaid Bhawan Palace: It is the largest Royal Palace in Rajasthan. It is also one of the largest private residences in the world. b. Lake Palace: It is now a luxury hotel located in Pichola Lake, Udaipur. c. Hawa Mahal: It is known as \\\"Palace of Wind\\\" or \\\"Palace of Breeze\\\" because there are more than 950 Windows in the Palace.\n\nd. Rambaugh Palace: Formerly a Royal Palace now converted into a Heritage Hotel. e. Devi Garh Palace: Formerly a palace now converted into a Heritage Hotel, in 2006, The New York Times named it as one if leading luxurious hotel in Indian subcontinent. Goa Figure 7.2 Goa The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist\n\nactivity inland. Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011. This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy. Influenced by over 450 years of Portuguese rule and Latin culture, Goa presents a somewhat different representation of the country to foreign visitors.[4] Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. As of 2013, Goa was the destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons, with limited means who wanted to party. The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic. On 24 November 2017, Delta Corp Limited claimed to have set up the first casino game training course Centre in India at Goa. Calangute: Go Beaching Like Never Before One of the most popular beaches in Goa and also the largest beach in North Goa, Calangute beach is among the most recommended tourist places in Goa and popular with both domestic and international tourists. It is also the busiest and commercialized beaches in Goa and during peak seasons, this beach is swamped with people from all over the world. It offers a long coastline with an amazing view of the sea and the beach front is dotted shacks, restaurants, clubs and shopping outlets. Once can also enjoy a plethora of water sports at Calangute beach. Fort Aguada A well-preserved 17 century Portuguese fort, Fort Aguada is located on the Sinquerim Beach in North Goa. Built as the chief defense of Portuguese against the Dutch and Marathas, it was the most prized and crucial fort of the Portuguese. The fort is ringed by thick battlements and a deep dry moat. 2 things worth visiting inside the fort are the 13 metre high lighthouse built in 1864 and a vaulted cistern capable of storing ten million litres of fresh water. From here fresh water was supplied to the ships that stopped there. Some buildings of the fort are still in good shape having been converted into a jail and interestingly, it happens to be the largest jail in Goa. Fort Aguada is one of the top sightseeing places in Goa. Deltin Royale Casino The Deltin Royale Casino boat is the largest casino boat in Panjim, Goa. It offers 24 hours of nonstop fun in an area spread over 40,000sq.ft of luxury live gaming on three levels with 850 gaming positions. Live entertainment is on the restaurant floor and during peak hours. You need to buy an entry and play package to gain access to the casino. You can also choose to buy a stay and play package which lets you stay at the Deltin hotel and access to the casino as\n\nwell. For those travelling during national holidays, the casino is closed on all national holidays. Chapora Fort Popular as the place where the Bollywood flick “Dil Chahta Hai” was picturized, the Chapora fort stands at the mouth of the Chapora river as an old guard. Today this laterite fort is almost in ruins but does offer some sensational views of the coastline from the top of the fort. That itself is reason enough for any photo enthusiasts. Basilica of Bom Jesus Churches in Goa are an important legacy of it being an erstwhile Portuguese colony. Built across centuries, these architectural wonders were more than just a place of worship; they hold a place of historical or cultural significance as well. One of the popular churches in Goa is the Basilica of Bom Jesus. The mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier is preserved here in this Basilica and hence revered by many. It also is an UNESCO World Heritage site. Tamil Naidu Figure 7.3 Tamil nadu Tamil Nadu is a state in the south-eastern part of the Indian Peninsula. Tamil Nadu is previously a part of the United Madras Province, which was later partitioned based on languages. Tamil Nadu has more than 4,000 years of continuous cultural history.

Kerala Figure 7.6 Kerala Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy.\n\nUntil the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global super brand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall. In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals. Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Varkala, Kollam and Kappad; backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar, Parambikulam and Eravikulam National Park. The \\\"backwaters\\\" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007. Since then it has been held every year during the December– January period. The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment, and enhance the cultural integrity of local people. Major attractions Beaches Flanked on the western coast by the Arabian Sea, Kerala has a long coastline of 580 km (360 mi); all of which is virtually dotted with sandy beaches. Kovalam beach near Thiruvananthapuram was among the first beaches in Kerala to attract tourists. Rediscovered by back-packers and tan-seekers in the 1960s and followed by hordes of hippies in the 1970s, Kovalam is today the most visited beach in the state. Other popularly visited beaches in the state include those at Kappad, Alappuzha, Kozhikode Beach, Marari Beach (Mararikulam, Alappuzha), Nattika (Thrissur), Vadanappilly beach (Thrissur), Cherai Beach, Beypore beach, Marari beach, Fort Kochi, and Varkala. The Muzhappilangad Beach at Kannur is the only drive-in beach in India. Marari beach was rated as one of the world's top five hammock beach by National Geographic survey and has been cited in the international press. Payambalam beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Kerala situated in Kannur. Other beaches in Kannur include Baby beach, Meenkunnu Beach,\n\nAzhikode Beach, Madaiparra Beach, Chootath Beach, Mermaid Beach. Backwaters The backwaters in Kerala are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast). Houseboat or Kettuvallam rides in the backwaters are a major tourist attraction. Backwater tourism is centered mostly around of Kerala like Alleppey, Kumarakoram, Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam and Bekal. Boat races held during festival seasons are also a major tourist attraction in the backwater regions. The backwater network includes large lakes such as the Ashtamudi Lake, the largest among them, linked by 1500 km of canals, both man-made and natural and fed by several rivers, and extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. Backwaters in Kerala for honeymoon and family holiday are quite popular. You may sort some of the best Kerala backwaters tour packages after reading about Kerala backwaters reviews available on various websites. Hill stations Munnar Hillscape Sithar Kundu View Point at Nelliyampathy, Palakkad Dist. Kerala, South India Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation. The Western Ghats rise on average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Some of the popular hill stations in the region are Munnar, Vagamon, Paithalmala, Wayanad, Nelliyampathi, Elapeedika, Peermade, Thekkady and Ponmudi. Kurumbalakotta Hill in Wayand is becoming a great tourist attraction now. Wildlife Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaque. They are among the world's rarest and most threatened primates. Most of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as among the world's most significant. Most of Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts. Kerala also hosts two of the world's Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands: Lake Sasthamkotta and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands are noted as being wetlands of international importance. There are also numerous protected conservation areas, including 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve. In turn, the forests play host to such major fauna as Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), Nilgiris\n\ntahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura).More remote preserves, including Silent Valley National Park in the Kundali Hills, harbour endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Indian sloth bear (Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus), and gaur (the so-called \\\"Indian bison\\\"—Bos gaurus). More common species include Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gray langur, flying squirrel, swamp lynx (Felis chaus kutas), boar (Sus scrofa), a variety of catarrhine Old World monkey species, gray wolf (Canis lupus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Many reptiles, such as king cobra, viper, python, various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala—again, disproportionately in the east. Kerala's avifauna include endemics like the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), Oriental bay owl, large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl, Indian cormorant, jungle and hill myna, Oriental darter, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed and black drongoes, bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker, jungle fowl, Alexandrine parakeet, and assorted ducks and migratory birds. Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu (stinging catfish—Heteropneustes fossilis) and brackishwater species such as Choottachi (orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus, valued as an aquarium specimen) also are native to Kerala's lakes and waterways.

Due to its belief in the philosophy of „Vasudeva Kutumbkam‟ its visitor friendly traditions, varied life styles, vast cultural heritage and colorful fairs and festivals, it holds multiple attractions for the tourist.\n\n The other attractions include beautiful sun drenched bathing beaches, forests and wild life, majestic rivers, glorious architecture, fascinating fauna and flora and beautiful landscapes for ecotourism, snowclad mountain peaks etc for adventure tourism, technological parks and science museum for science tourism, centers of pilgrimage for spiritual tourism, heritage trains and hotels for heritage tourism, yoga, ayurveda and natural health resorts and hill stations also attract tourists. Indian handicrafts particularly jewellery, carpets, leather goods, ivory and brass work are the main shopping items of foreign tourists.  Despite the economic slowdown, medical tourism in India is the fastest growing segment of tourism industry. Factors such as low cost scale and range of treatments provided in the country add to its attractiveness as a medical tourism destination. The major tourist attractions in India can be explained by dividing India into four zones. The major tourist attractions for foreign tourists in North India are New Delhi, Agra, Shimla and Dehradun. New Delhi is the capital city of 63 India and has a rich cultural past. Red Fort, India Gate, Qutub Minar, Jama Masjid are the important places for tourism in Delhi.  Agra is the city of Taj Mahal and one of the greatest spot for tourist attractions in India. Shimla is a splendid hill station in the Himalayas. Dehradun, the capital of Uttaranchal is famous for its fantastic scenery. In East India the major tourist attractions are Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Patna, Jamshedpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Bhopal. Kolkata –a heritage city and the cultural capital of India. Many places to visit in Kolkata are Victoria memorial, Fort William, Nanda theatre, Race Course, National Library, Eden gardens, Botanical gardens, Allipur Zoo. Guwahati is an important base for tourism in the region. Shillong is the capital of Meghalaya and famous for its breath taking lush green landscapes. Patna is one of the oldest cities in India and famous for its historical relics.  Jamshedpur is an important industrial township, home of Tata industries. Allahabad is the city of Prayag and the world-famous fair-Kumbh mela. Varanasi is the most auspicious city of the Hindus, famous for its temples and ghats. Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh and an important center of Tourism. In West India the major tourist attractions are Mumbai, Panjim and Udaipur. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India and the city that never sleeps. Panjim the capital city of Goa is famous for its Golden beaches and pristine waters. Udaipur is famous for its floating palaces in the middle of Lake Pichola. In South India the most important tourist sites are Kerala, Chennai, Bengaluru, Cochin, Trivandrum and Ooty. Kerala, known as „God’s own country‟ is very famous among tourists for its lush greenery, coconut canopies and exotic beaches.  Chennai is the automobile capital of India. Bangalore the silicon valley of India is famous for its software companies and has a pleasing weather round the year.\n\nTrivandrum is the city of the famous Kovalam beach. Cochin is a coastal city famous for its historical relevance. Ooty is a fabulous hill station in the Nilgiris famous for its verdure valleys 7.5 KEYWORDS  Attraction − It is a physical or cultural feature of a place that can satisfy tourists’ leisure based need.  Cultural Heritage − It is an expression of the manner of living developed by a community and passed on from one generation to the next.

Travel and tourism, therefore, are typically considered leisure activities and a form of recreation that takes place away from the home place. The fact that tourism involves travel from one place to another, and occurs in places that are often shaped intentionally by the tourism industry, also make it very geographical. Most people have an inherent sense of what they consider to be a leisure activity. We generally know that it is not work and not something that you must do. In fact, it is easier to define what leisure is not than what it is. In part, this is because leisure is very subjective – what one person considers a leisure activity, another person may not consider leisure at all. A hike in the woods might be considered leisure by some, and work by someone else. Furthermore, the same person can hold these divergent views from one day to the next, depending on the social context and an individual ’s attitude. Despite the subjective\n\ncomplexities of leisure, we can generally say that leisure occurs when an individual is undertaking an activity that he or she wants to do and enjoys doing. Leisure, therefore, can be defined as time spent free of obligation and necessity, when one is in control of one ’s own destiny. During pure leisure, there are no overt outside factors or forces that determine what we do and how we spend our time. While we have each been socialized to consider some forms of leisure activities more acceptable than others, we feel that during our leisure time we are free from society ’s expectations and demands of us. This definition of leisure raises some intriguing questions about free will and social expectations. However, it is also limited in that it is not easily quantifiable because it does not specifically address different types of leisure (for counting purposes), nor does it describe to what extent one is free from social obligation (such as when a business trip becomes a tourist holiday). Because defining leisure as the opposite of work and obligation is so vague, we will move on to a second definition of leisure that focuses on activities 8.2 GEOGRAPHY AND LEISURE Almost every aspect of life is interwoven with leisure (including both recreation and tourism), either as a leisure activity or as its opposite. Because of this, the study of leisure is undertaken from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, the most prominent being sociology and economics. Geographers have also made major contributions to leisure studies, especially in the area of tourism, because of their interests in the nature and development of places, how people use and behave in places, and the varied relationships that exist between places. The study of geography is distinct in that it encompasses both the physical sciences (physical geography) and social sciences (human or cultural geography). Max Weber saw the Protestant world as being caught in an 'iron cage' in which the accepted values were asceticism, restraint, productivity, harder work for higher profits, etc. In this cage the Capitalist lost the ability to feel free from the necessity to work, and consequently lost the ability to be 'at leisure', in the classical sense. In fact, the meaning of the word leisure was changed. The early period of industrialization in the United States exemplifies this change, when society's achievements were firmly based on the ethic of salvation through work. The White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) moved to a position of greater power and affluence by way of this Protestant ideal, and in doing so lost the art of the Greeks and others-schole. An American, Thorstein Veblen, showed how an industrial elite emerged in his society at the end of the nineteenth century. They earned their leisure not through the accumulation of land, as in the Middle Ages, nor through war and colonization, as in Greece and Rome, but through the acceptable Protestant means of asceticism, restraint and hard work. Because of this, their leisure time was surrounded by a new and very different set of ideals and values. Finding themselves caught in the Weberian 'iron cage' in which to be productive was to be respectable and respected, they were faced with the dilemma of spending their time and money earned in an equally acceptable way. They had to reconcile leisure, which is by their definition\n\nunproductive, with the need to be seen to be productive. Veblen's 'Leisure Class' achieved a certain degree of resolution by using leisure time to display their worth, wealth, power and status in society. They indulged in patterns of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure; a way of life immortalized and criticized by Orson Welles in his film Citizen Kane. This elite used inactivity to advertise the extent of their forefathers' activity and productivity. Their extravagant and extrovert tastes and patterns of behavior were not a means of escape from the cage but simply a way of being at leisure and at the same time indicating that they were staying firmly inside it. The relevance of this elite to contemporary society is that their canons of taste have been largely adopted by a new leisured majority: the twentieth-century middle class. Despite a generally lower level of commitment to work, an increased preoccupation with consumption, there is no real evidence available to prove that the present leisured class find abundance any easier to live with than Veblen's elite did seventy years ago. The hedonistic values of the Greeks were based on an entirely different code of ethics from those which underlie the growing search for leisure and pleasure in the late twentieth century. Although assumptions have been made about contemporary fashion and taste which see leisure as a 'superior good' replacing Victorian distaste for decadence and their disapproval of all that was unproductive, the old values still have power to keep large sections of the population inside Weber's 'iron cage of capitalism' when they could afford to work less and enjoy more free time. There is at present a tendency towards more evening overtime working. Wilensky suggests that manual workers in the Middle Ages worked approximately the same hours as they do now, and the better paid worked less than they do now. Since the length of the working week has been shortened for labourers in manufacturing industry, mining, etc., we must assume that the Industrial Revolution reversed the balance of hours spent at work and at leisure. It has been suggested that the Capitalist 'religion of work' is being replaced by a new 'religion of leisure'. The situation is much more complex, and certainly it cannot be assumed that such a change would depend on the number of hours in an average working week. Leisure will never be adequately described or understood if it is defined only as a quantitative concept, that is, the length of time spent not working. Unfortunately it has become just that for the recreational planner, who allocates sufficient land, labour and capital for a population whose needs are calculated in terms of number of hours free from work, income levels, and car-ownership patterns. These factors are fundamental to any analysis of provision for leisure, but they do not always include an understanding of the most important, the qualitative aspects of contemporary leisure activities. Recreation should not be separated from a consideration of the educational and welfare needs of any urban society. Sport is primarily a social and not an athletic activity. The Arts are not an esoteric amusement for the intellectual elite but an integral part of the entire educational experience. The degree to which they are widely accessible is therefore of vital importance. 'It does not make sense to educate a whole generation to enjoy reading, acting, listening to music, painting, playing instruments, sport, etc., while they are at school, and then neglect to provide adequate opportunities and\n\nactivities for them later 8.3 TOURISM, MOBILITY AND MIGRATION Another way of conceptualizing tourism is as a form of voluntary temporary mobility by which people travel to another location – often for leisure or visiting friends and relations (VFR). This way of thinking about tourism helps differentiate it from forced mobility, as in the case of political or environmental refugees, for example, people having to move because of a major flood, or permanent migration. The concept of temporary mobility therefore includes a wide range of tourism-related phenomenon such as leisure travel, health tourism, volunteer tourism, educational travel, travel to second homes, working holidays and business travel. Although much migration and tourism is domestic, Many of the points apply to multiple scales although the crossing of international borders has special attributes and is important for both phenomena. Globalization entails the rapidly increasing mobility of people across national borders, and is associated with large-scale movements of all kinds: temporary and permanent. Mobility takes two forms: long-term migration and short-term tourism (Castles and Miller, 1998; Bell and Ward, 2000; Williams and Hall, 2000). Temporary mobility is simply defined as “the complement of permanent migration: that is, as any form of territorial movement which does not represent a permanent, or lasting, change of usual residence” (Bell and Ward, 2000, p. 88). Tourism is one form of temporary population movement. Temporary movements as tourism and permanent movements as migration form part of “the same continuum of population mobility in time and space” (Bell and Ward, 2000, p. 88). Migration entails the movement of people between two places for a specific period of time. However, it is difficult to determine a precise description for migration. The problem is in defining the distance a person needs to move and the time a person needs to stay away from the original destination. In terms of time: “there will be some permanence to a move described as a migration” (Boyle et al. 1998, p.35). However, according to Williams and Hall (2000b), this criterion is problematic, as no theoretically grounded definition of “permanence” exists. Therefore, the migration literature includes such terms as temporary migrants, seasonal workers, and travellers for specific forms of non-permanent migration. Spatially, migration is defined as “movement across the boundary of an aerial unit” (Boyle et al., 1998, p.34). This criterion is also problematic because, areas vary significantly in size. Accordingly, fairly long-distance movement of people will not be included as a form of migration because people do not cross boundaries, whereas shorter movements will be considered migration when they involve a border crossing. Furthermore, the definition of the areal unit is often crucial, as population movement and distribution between units usually have policy consequences (Boyle et al., 1998). One could move on to specify different types\n\nof migration, although that will not be done here. New forms of mobility can be found at many scales from the local and national to the global. They also include all age ranges but particularly those near the polar extremes of the life course - young, single adults and the active elderly (in contrast, families with young children and the frail elderly tend to be some of the least mobile socio-demographic groups). The heroes of this new mobility are figures such as the young New Zealanders or Australians taking their Big OE (Overseas Experience) in Europe, or the partly retired Canadian living a peripatetic life style between Toronto and Florida, or the German and Swedish long-term travelers visiting organic farms around the world. All straddle not only international boundaries but also the worlds of work and leisure, and so of tourism and migration. There is probably no finer example of this blurring of the spheres of consumption and production than Chris Stewart, the British author, farmer and ex rock-musician, who migrated from Britain to the Alpujarra’s mountains in southern Spain. In his best sailing book, Driving Over Lemons, he describes their purchase of a near derelict farm house, and the love, pleasure and sheer hard labour that went into its renovation. His income is supplemented by stints working as a sheep shearer in Sweden, a form of circulation that parallels occasional visits to and from friends and relatives in the UK. There is, in a sense, nothing new in these examples. There have long been migrants whose love of place has over-ridden the logic of labour market material incentives, such as the British middle classes who eked out often meagre livings in Italy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (see King and Patterson, 1998). Similarly, the thousands of Europeans and North Americans who crossed the Atlantic in the second half of the twentieth century, to wash dishes or make beds in hotels and holiday camps were driven less by employment and income prospects than by the tourist goals of adventure, exploration and discovery (Cohen, 1972). None of these forms of mobility are new, but they have increased in volume and geographical scope in recent decades, for reasons that are discussed later in this paper. However, there are new forms of mobility which were unimaginable a generation earlier. The young Asian working in New York to pay for a graduate course may simultaneously be a student, a labour migrant and a tourist. Similarly, the young Pole visiting Germany on a tourist visa, but paying for his or her trip by taking casual work and petty trading (Wallace et air., 1996) also defines new forms of mobility. If this is labour migration, then it stands in marked contrast to the mass migrations of the 1960s from Southern to Northern Europe, driven mainly by the gulf in earnings and living standards across Europe, and involving long years of hardship in cramped accommodation and tough working conditions over many years (King, 1993). These new forms of mobility both constitute and are the results of globalization (Held, 2000) which, as is now widely acknowledged, serve to enhance rather than diminish place differences. The places locked together by these new forms of mobility are not, of course, the outcome of a random spatial lottery but are those with particular place features whether these be climatic (the lure of the Mediterranean), cultural (the excitement of Paris or London), economic (the booming economies of the West\n\nCoast of the USA), or activity based (the seasonal attraction of ski resorts in North America, Europe and Australasia). They are also places which have been interconnected by earlier migration, trade or investment flows, such as the China Towns of the Pacific Rim, or the European colonial powers and what had once been the outposts of empire. In all these examples, place differences shape both the origins and the flows of mobility. Moreover, places may actively promote themselves in the global marketplace on the bases of these new forms of mobility - Florida and the Queensland coast as Centre’s of easeful retirement migration, San Francisco and Sydney as vibrant, young multi-cultural cities where young in- migrants can combine party time with making a quick dollar. In short, mobility can be branded, marketed and commodified. The consequences of these new forms of mobility extend beyond the individuals concerned. There are obvious direct consequences experienced by the real estate developer who sells a house to the second homer, the surfboard training school who hires the itinerant Australian surfer for a season, and the long lost cousin in Scotland who hosts a seemingly endless flow of distant relatives in search of their ancestral roots. But the implications of the new forms of mobility, directly or indirectly, touch most people in the communities or origin or destination: on the one hand, the consequences include gains and losses in labour supply, innovation and contact networks whilst, on the other hand, they include changes in house prices, services, and in the cultural images of places. 8.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF TOURISM Tourism has been the direct subject of geographical analysis since the 1920s and has developed into a significant area of applied human geography as well as other social scientific fields. In that time methodologies and philosophies have changed, as has the subject matter. Building on initial research on tourism in American and German economic geography in the 1920s and 1930s, research was primarily undertaken in the post-war period on the economic impact of tourism in both a regional destination setting and on travel routes. Research on issues of seasonality and travel motivations was already being undertaken by 1947. The geography of recreation and tourism was of sufficient profile in the discipline to warrant a chapter in an overview text on the state of geography in the United States in the 1950s. In Britain significant research was undertaken pre- and post- Second World War on the development of British seaside resorts which was also influential in the European context. However, little further direct research was undertaken on tourism and recreation in the United Kingdom until the 1960s. In Canada over the same period substantive geographical research on tourism was primarily focused work on cottaging which laid the foundation for later research on the geography of second home development at an international level, particularly in Scandinavia which has a long-standing tradition of second home ownership and access. In the 1960s research started to accelerate with a major growth in publications on tourism and recreation in the 1970s. During the 1960s several influential reviews were undertaken of the geography of tourism and recreation in Anglo-American geography, while a substantive\n\ncontribution to the development of the area also came from regional sciences, economic geography and migration studies. French geography also has a strong tradition of research on tourism and recreation that was, arguably, much further advanced in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of both theoretical development and extent of publication than the Anglo-American tradition. One reason for this advanced interest possibly lay in the long recognition of tourism as a factor in the economic development of French alpine regions and its impact on the cultural and physical landscape. In addition, the growth of tourism in the Mediterranean coast provided a basis for research on coastal resort development while the significance of second homes for tourism and leisure also has a strong research tradition. During the 1970s and early 1980s, a number of influential texts and monographs appeared in the geography literature providing significant impetus to research. The 1970s and 1980s also witnessed the development of several journals solely devoted to the study of tourism. However, it was from the late 1980s onwards that the study of the geography of tourism began to enter a rapid phase of development in which it is still engaged. Several reasons can be given for this growth: first, recognition of the economic importance of tourism by government and industry; second, as a result of recognition increasing funding for university courses in tourism and, to a lesser extent, research monies for tourism research; three, greater recognition by government, industry and the public that tourism development may have substantial positive and negative impacts which require effective management and planning; four, increased use of tourism as a mechanism for regional development; five, increased recognition in the social sciences. 8.5 SUMMARY  World regional geography studies various world regions as they compare with the rest of the world. Factors for comparison include both the physical and the cultural landscape. The main questions are, who lives there? What are their lives like? What do they do for a living? Physical factors of significance can include location, climate type, and terrain. Human factors include cultural traditions, ethnicity, language, religion, economics, and politics.  World regional geography focuses on regions of various sizes across the earth’s landscape and aspires to understand the unique character of regions in terms of their natural and cultural attributes. Spatial studies can play an important role in regional geography. The scientific approach can focus on the distribution of cultural and natural phenomena within regions as delimited by various natural and cultural factors.  The focus is on the spatial relationships within any field of study, such as regional economics, resource management, regional planning, and landscape ecology.  Again, we take a regional approach with a focus on themes that illustrate the\n\nglobalization process, which in turn helps us better understand our global community. The regions studied in world regional geography can be combined into larger portions called realms. Realms are large areas of the planet, usually with multiple regions, that share the same general geographic location. 8.6 KEYWORDS  Terrain − It is a stretch of land, especially with regard to its physical features.  Tourism Carrying Capacity − The maximum number of people that may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, socio-cultural environment, and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' satisfaction.  Travel − The act of moving outside one's home community for business or pleasure but not for commuting or traveling to or from usual places.  United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) − It is the United Nations (UN) agency responsible for the promotion of responsible, sustainable, and universally accessible tourism.  WTO − World Tourism Organization. 8.7 LEARNING ACTIVITY 1.

The total contribution of travel and tourism represents 9.7% of GDP and supports 2.9 million jobs (10.9% of employment) in the country. Tourism contributes significantly to the balance of payments. France was visited by 89 million foreign tourists in 2018, making it the most popular tourist destination in the world, however considering the number of nights spent in the country, it is in sixth place, after United States, United Kingdom, China, Spain and Italy. France ranks fifth in tourist spending behind the United Kingdom, United States, China and Spain. France has 37 sites inscribed in the UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities or sites of high cultural interest (Paris being the foremost, but also Loire Valley, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lyon, and others), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquility (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage (such as Collonges-la-Rouge, Locronan, or Montsoreau) are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France\n\n(literally \\\"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\\\"). The \\\"Remarkable Gardens\\\" label is a list of the over two hundred gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. 9.2 FRANCE Figure 9.1 France France borders Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland, Monaco, and Italy to the east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The country's 18 integral regions (five of which are situated overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometers (248,573 sq mi) and a total population of 67.07 million (as of May 2020).[10] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice. France, including its\n\noverseas territories, has the most time zones of any country, with a total of 12. During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a collection of Celtic tribes. The area was annexed by Rome in 51 BC, developing a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks arrived in 476 and formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. For much of the High Middle Ages, France was a highly decentralized feudal kingdom in which the authority of the king was barely felt. King Philip Augustus achieved remarkable success in the strengthening of royal power and the expansion of his realm, doubling its size and defeating his rivals. By the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe. In the mid-14th century, French monarchs were embroiled in a series of dynastic conflicts with their English counterparts, which lasted over 100 years. Emerging victorious from said conflicts, disputes with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire soon followed during the Renaissance but were ultimately less successful. However, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world. The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots), which severely weakened the country. But France once again emerged as Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War. An inadequate financial model and inequitable taxation system as well as endless and costly wars to maintain its predominant position, the Seven Years' War and American War of Independence among them, left the heavily indebted kingdom in a precarious situation by the end of the 18th century. The French Revolution in 1789 saw the fall of the absolute monarchy that characterized the Ancient Régime and from its ashes, rose one of modern history's earliest republics, which drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The declaration expresses the nation's ideals to this day. Following the revolution, France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. After the collapse of the empire and a relative decline, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating in the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 in the midst of the Franco-Prussian War. France was one of the prominent participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allied powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and nearly all other French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with\n\nFrance. France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018. France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the tenth-largest by PPP. In terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development. It remains a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, and a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie. In France tourism is a major industry. France is the world's leading tourist destination. Not only is it situated at the heart of western Europe, bordering on all the larger countries in the region - Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and - across the straits of Dover - the UK; it also has Europe's second busiest airport - Paris Charles de Gaulle airport - and dozens more airports with international connections. As a country, France offers a fabulous historic heritage and probably the most diversified natural environment of any country in Europe. Its tourist attractions illustrate the history of the human race, from the prehistoric sites of Cro Magnon to the steel and glass of the Futuroscope; they include fine vestiges of all European civilizations, from the prehistoric megaliths of Carnac and the Roman remains of Provence, through medieval castles and cathedrals, to the splendors of Versailles, the nineteenth century Eiffel Tower, or the resolute modernity of the TGV. In addition, France has the necessary tourism infrastructure to cope with its status as leading tourist destination - more hotels and campsites than any other country of Europe, probably more gites or holiday cottages, the best and most modern rail network in Europe, and a fine system of motorways linking all main towns and cities. 9.3 MAJOR ATTRACTION IN FRANCE Paris The Eiffel Tower seen from the Place du Trocadéro Paris, the capital city of France, is the third most visited city in the world. It has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, but also the Musée d'Orsay which, like the nearby Musée de l'Orangerie, is mostly devoted to impressionism, and Centre Georges Pompidou, dedicated to Contemporary art. Paris hosts some of the world's most recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, which\n\nis the most-visited paid monument in the world, the Arc de Triomphe, the cathedral of Notre- Dame, or the Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre. The Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, located in Parc de la Villette, is the biggest science museum in Europe. Near Paris are located the Palace of Versailles, the former palace of the Kings of France, now a museum, and the medieval village of Provins. Both attractions are protected as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. French Riviera With more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: Côte d'Azur), in southeastern France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Parisian region. According to the Côte d'Azur Economic Development Agency, it benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometers (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses and 3,000 restaurants. Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet, with 90% of all superyachts visiting the region's coast at least once in their lifetime. Main cities on the French Riviera include Nice, Antibes and Cannes; Cap Ferrat is also a popular destination. Cannes hosts the annual Cannes Film Festival. Tourists also often visit the Port-Cros National Park, east of Toulon, and Monaco, near the Italian border. Provence A large part of Provence, with Marseille as its leading city, was designed as the 2013 European Capital of Culture. Numerous famous natural sites can be found in the region, as the Gorges du Verdon, the Camargue, the Calanques National Park and the typical landscape of Luberon. Provence hosts dozens of renowned historical sites like the Pont du Gard, the Arles' Roman Monuments or the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Several smaller cities also attract a lot of tourists, like Aix-en-Provence, La Ciotat or Cassis, on the Mediterranean Sea coastline. Loire Valley Another major destination is the Châteaux (castles) of the Loire Valley. The French Revolution saw a number of the great French châteaux destroyed and many ransacked, their treasures stolen. The overnight impoverishment of many of the deposed nobility, usually after one of its members lost his or her head to the guillotine, saw many châteaux demolished. During World War I and World War II, some chateaux were commandeered as military headquarters. Some of these continued to be used this way after the end of the Second World War. This World Heritage Site is noteworthy for the quality of its architectural heritage, in its historic towns such as Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Orléans, and Saumur, but in particular for its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, de Chenonceau, and de Montsoreau, which illustrate to an exceptional degree the ideals of the French Renaissance. French Alps The French Alps are the portions of the Alps mountain range that stand within France,\n\nlocated in the Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur regions. While some of the ranges of the French Alps are entirely in France, others, such as the Mont Blanc massif, are shared with Switzerland and Italy. More than 20 skiing resorts make it a popular destination among Europeans in the winter. Corsica Corsica is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It is a popular attraction for tourists with both cultural aspects (with its main cities Ajaccio and Bastia and smaller towns like Porto-Vecchio and Sartène) and geographical features (Parc naturel regional de Corse). The Calanques de Piana and Scandola Nature Reserve are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The island is 183 kilometers (114 miles) long at longest, 83 kilometers (52 miles) wide at widest, has 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of coastline, more than 200 beaches, and is very mountainous, with Monte Cinto as the highest peak at 2,706 metres (8,878 feet) and around 120 other summits of more than 2,000 metres (6,600 feet). Mountains comprise two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. Forests make up 20% of the island. 9.4 SOUTH AFRICA\n\nFigure 9.2 South Africa South Africa is a tourist destination and the industry accounts for a substantial amount of the country's revenue. The official marketing agency for the country South African Tourism is responsible for marketing South Africa to the world. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the tourism industry directly contributed ZAR 102 billion to South African GDP in 2012, and supports 10.3% of jobs in the country. The official national marketing agency of the South African government, with the goal of promoting tourism in South Africa both locally and globally is known as South African Tourism. South Africa offers both domestic and international tourists a wide variety of options, among others the picturesque natural landscape and game reserves, diverse cultural heritage and highly regarded wines. Some of the most popular destinations include several national parks, such as the expansive Kruger National Park in the north of the country, the coastlines and beaches of the KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces, and the major cities like Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. According to Statistics South Africa's latest Tourism and Migration Survey, almost 3,5 million travelers passed through the country's ports of entry in August 2017.The top five overseas countries with the largest number of tourists visiting South Africa were the USA, UK, Germany, the Netherlands and France. Most of the tourists arriving in South Africa from elsewhere in Africa came from SADC countries. Zimbabwe tops the list at 31%, followed by Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Botswana. In addition, Nigeria was the country of origin for nearly 30% of tourists arriving in South Africa. Biodiversity and ecotourism South Africa is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries and is home to a large variety of animal life. Among the large mammals found in the northern bushveld include lions, leopards, cheetahs, white rhinoceroses, blue wildebeest, kudus, impalas, hyenas, hippopotamuses and giraffes. A significant extent of the bushveld exists in the north-east, including the Kruger National Park, one of the largest game reserves in Africa, and the Sabi Sand Game Reserve. The Kruger National Park, established in 1926, is one of the most visited national parks in the country, with a total of 1 659 793 visitors in the 2014/15 period. The country is also particularly rich in plant diversity, with a wide variety of biomes found across the country. These include the grasslands in the Highveld, the succulent Karoo in central South Africa, and the endemic fynbos biome, constituting the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape floristic region of the Western Cape. This rare vegetation is protected as part of the Table Mountain National Park (which also includes the iconic flat-topped Table Mountain), which was the most-visited national park in South Africa in 2014/15, with a total of 2 677 767 visitors. Ecotourism It is difficult to know if there is regulation of the term 'ecotourism' as well as what a foundation/association/company needs to do to fall into the category of 'eco-travel'. However,\n\nthere is a non-profit association that represents the private sector of the \\\"incoming tourism industry in South Africa\\\" (which is a large group) called the South African Tourism Services Association (SATSA), they are \\\"dedicated to providing and maintaining the highest possible standards in the tourism industry within South Africa.\\\" (SATSA, 2007) SATSA is focused on the accountability, integrity, and quality control of the tourism industry in South Africa as well as with the companies and associations they are connected to. In addition to SATSA, the website responsibletravel.com partnered with The Metro, World Travel Market and Travel Trade Gazette Magazine have established the World Responsible Tourism Awards. The goal of the award is to \\\"recognize individuals, companies and organizations in the travel industry that are making a significant commitment to the culture and economies of local communities and are providing a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation.\\\" Cultural attractions In addition to its numerous natural attractions, South Africa also boasts numerous attractions of cultural significance. These include the fossil-bearing caves forming part of the Cradle of Humankind in Gauteng, the ruins of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in northern Limpopo, the wine routes of the Western Cape, and various historical sites in the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg (such as Robben Island, the Castle of Good Hope and Soweto township). UNESCO World Heritage Sites Eight South African sites are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, including the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park in KwaZulu-Natal. Cultural Life Blending Western technology with indigenous technology, Western traditions with African and Asian traditions, South Africa is a study in contrasts. It also provides lessons in how cultures can sometimes blend, sometimes collide; for example, within a short distance of one another can be found the villas of South Africa’s white elite and the tar-paper shacks of black day labourers, office buildings with the most sophisticated electronic wiring and one-room houses that lack electricity. A great gulf still exists between the white minority and the black majority in matters of education and economic opportunity. Yet, South Africa is making steady progress in erasing some of these historic disparities and their consequences. Daily life is better for most of its people, and culture and the arts, which sometimes were forced into exile, are flourishing in the free climate of the post-apartheid era. The arts A century and a half of white domination in most of the country (more than three centuries in the Western Cape) and the great extent of its ties to the global market economy have profoundly transformed black culture in South Africa. The strongest links to traditional societies have been through the many languages embodying the country’s cultural diversity, whose nuances of idiom and sensibility carry over into the arts. Traditional art forms such as dancing and textile weaving are used as vehicles of ethnic identity and are carefully preserved, while modern art forms from painting to literature have flourished in the years since the end\n\nof apartheid. Still, much of this has taken place through private initiatives because major institutional support for culture has been largely abandoned, especially for cultural projects perceived as elitist or European in orientation; the closing of the National Symphony Orchestra in 2000 is one such example. Music Many popular South African arts represent a fusion of cultural influences, such as township jazz and pop music, religious choral music, and so-called “traditional” dances performed competitively by mine workers in decidedly untraditional settings. Others are innovations created in response to new circumstances, such as the lifela song-poems composed by Sotho migrant workers to express and comment upon the life of miners. Because miners were frequently so far away from home, traditional rituals had to be performed during the weekends or on holidays. Mining companies often sponsored dances as an outlet for the men, and tourists came to view the exotic African musical forms. South African music is a fusion of various musical styles such as traditional indigenous music, jazz, Christian religious music, and forms of popular music from the United States. These combinations are evident in the music of such performers as the African Jazz Pioneers, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, and others. During the apartheid period, black and white musicians were segregated, although they still collaborated on occasion; a notable example is Johnny Clegg, a white South African who learned traditional Zulu music and formed the mixed-race bands Juluka and Savuka, both of which had international followings. Township music, a lively form of music that flourished in the townships during the apartheid era, has also been popular within the country and abroad. Art Rock and cave art attributable to the San, some of which is thought to be about 26,000 years old, has been found across much of Southern Africa. The greatest number of paintings, which primarily depict human figures and such animals as elands, elephants, cattle, and horses, have been found in the Drakensberg mountains (part of uKhahlamba/Drakensberg Park, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000). Terra-cotta figures dated to AD 500 are known as Lydenburg heads, named after the town in which they were discovered. Excavations at Bambandyanalo and Mapungubwe in the Limpopo River valley have found gold animal statues as well as a wealth of pottery and clay animal figurines. More recently, Zulu wooden statues, produced in the 19th century before the Anglo-Zulu War (1879), are further examples of South Africa’s artistic history. Major attractions – South Africa South Africa is diverse and beautiful country, about the size of France and Spain combined or roughly twice the size of Texas. Its varied cultures, intriguing wildlife, stunning scenery, and remarkable beaches make it a haven for travelers from around the world. Visitors quickly discover that the rich history and colorful inhabitants ideally complement the top tourist attractions in South Africa, which creates an unforgettable experience.\n\nSun City Resort Known regionally as Africa’s Kingdom of Pleasure, Sun City Resort is a luxury casino and resort, situated about two hours’ drive from Johannesburg. The complex contains four hotels, two championship golf courses, two casinos, an atmospheric South African cultural village and more than 7000 crocodiles within a sanctuary. The adjacent Pilanesberg Game Reserve is the most popular public Game Reserve in South Africa. Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve As the only park under a formal conservation effort in KwaZulu Natal where you can see the Big Five – lions, elephants, leopards, buffalo and rhinoceros – the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve offers visitors wildlife viewing opportunities second to none. Wildlife enthusiasts may enjoy the vast expanses of native plants and native animals during guided walks, self- guided drives, or opt for a thrilling viewing experience by boat along the Hluhluwe dam. Blyde River Canyon Blyde River Canyon is the second largest canyon in Africa, after the Fish River Canyon, although it is much greener due to its lush subtropical foliage. Walking treks through the rich diversity of flora and fauna filled canyon offer views of magnificent escarpments, waterfalls and ancient geological phenomenon. Visitors have the opportunity to encounter all five of South Africa’s primates here, as well as hippos and crocodiles near the wetlands of Swadini Dam.
