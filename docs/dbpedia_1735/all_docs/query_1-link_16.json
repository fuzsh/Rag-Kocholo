Click Here!\n\nCheck Out Some Properties In Chandigarh\n\nIntroduction To NH-5\n\nNational Highway 5, often referred to as NH 5, is a critical national highway in India, seamlessly connecting the states of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and Himachal Pradesh. This extensive highway spans over 600 kilometres from east to west, serving as a crucial link for transportation and connectivity. Here's a comprehensive overview of NH 5, including its entry-exit points, route map, connected states, significance, and junctions.\n\nNH 5 connects the vast northern plains of India with the rugged and mountainous terrain of the Himalayas. It stretches from Firozpur in Punjab to Shipki La in Himachal Pradesh, traversing three significant states and one Union Territory. Notably, NH 5 offers travellers a captivating journey through diverse geographical landscapes, all while providing seamless connectivity. As we delve further, we will explore the NH 5 route map, its significance, and the real estate impact.\n\nEvolution Of NH-5\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\nThe historical evolution of National Highway 5 (NH 5) traces back to its origins as part of the erstwhile NH 22. NH 22 spanned from Ambala in Haryana to Khab on the Indo-Tibetan border, serving as a crucial lifeline. In 1989, a significant transformation occurred when NH 5 was officially designated as a national highway, highlighting its growing importance in the Indian road network.\n\nA more recent development took place in 2010 when NH 5 underwent renumbering as part of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). This renumbering redefined the highway as NH 5, signifying its pivotal role as a major national highway connecting diverse regions and contributing to the country's transportation infrastructure. This journey reflects the continuous efforts to improve and expand India's roadways for better connectivity and accessibility.\n\nNH-5 Route Map: Connecting Key Cities And Regions\n\nNational Highway 5 (NH 5) covers a substantial distance of 660.2 kilometres and falls under the jurisdiction of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). As a critical national highway, NH 5 seamlessly connects the western and eastern regions of India, spanning from Punjab to Himachal Pradesh, with Haryana and Chandigarh in between. If you intend to access NH 5, you must enter from Firozpur, and exiting NH 5 is done at Shipki La in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nLet's explore the NH 5 route in more detail. Starting from Firozpur, the highway passes through several significant locations, including Moga, Jagraon, Kharar, and Ludhiana in Punjab, proceeding towards Chandigarh, with Mohali in close proximity. It then crosses into Haryana, encompassing Panchkula, Surajpur, Pinjore, and bypassing Kalka. Finally, NH 5 enters Himachal Pradesh in Solan and covers a route that includes Shimla, Theog, Narkanda, Kumarsain, Rampur Bushahr, and Chini before reaching its terminus at Shipki La on the India-China border in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nSignificance Of NH-5\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\nNational Highway 5 (NH 5) plays a pivotal role as a lifeline for the residents of Himachal Pradesh's hilly regions, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential commodities such as food, fuel, and medicines. It serves as a critical artery that connects these remote areas with the rest of the country, offering a lifeline for the well-being of the local population.\n\nBeyond its vital role in sustaining life in these regions, NH 5 also grants access to some of the most breathtaking and scenic areas within the Indian Himalayas. Travellers and residents alike can immerse themselves in the natural beauty and tranquillity that this highway unveils.\n\nNH 5's journey in serving the nation began in 1989 when it was officially designated as a national highway. Prior to this, it was an integral part of the former NH 22, a highway that stretched from Ambala to Khab on the Indo-Tibetan border. In 2010, NH 5 underwent renumbering as part of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP), solidifying its importance as a vital transportation route in India's road network.\n\nMajor States And Their Cities Covered By NH-5\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\nNational Highway 5 (NH 5) traverses through several states and a Union Territory, connecting diverse regions.
