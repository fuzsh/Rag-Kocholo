Toy trains of India:\n\n3. Contents : Introduction History of Mountain Railways in India Details: Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Kalka – Shimla Railway Nilgiri Mountain Railway SWOT Analysis Fast Facts Endnote\n\n4. Introduction : The Mountain Railways of India refers to the following five railway lines built in the mountains of India during the British Raj: Northern India (Himalayas) : Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (1881) Kalka – Shimla Railway (1898) Kangra Railway Valley (1924) Southern India (Western Ghats) : Nilgiri Mountain Railway Matheran Hill Railway All the five railway lines are still operated by the Indian Railways and connect to important hill resorts from foot hills, winding through the rugged and scenic mountainous terrain of India. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and the Kalka-Shimla Railway have been collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site entitled “Mountain Railways of India” .\n\n5. History of Mountain Railways in India : Reason for building - the British Raj wanted to establish control over the mountainous ranges in India. The hill stations chosen for this purpose were: Shimla - the then capital of British India Darjeeling - known for its tea gardens and scenic view of the Himalayas Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh Ootacamund in the Nilgiri mountains of Tamilnadu Matheran in the Western Ghats near Mumbai Development of the Hill Passenger Railway: tramway between Siliguri and Darjeeling - work started off in 1878 - completed in 1881. Nilgiri Mountain Railway in South India - initially proposed in 1854 - work started in 1894 – completed in 1908 Kalka Shimla Railway link - commenced in 1898 to open up the remote hill regions to the rest of the country - inaugurated by the British Viceroy Lord Curzon in 1903 Matheran–Narela toy train - commissioned in 1907 Kangra line - built in 1929\n\n6. Details : Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Kalka – Shimla Railway Nilgiri Mountain Railway\n\n8. Overview The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway , nicknamed the &quot;Toy Train&quot;, is a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow-gauge railway from New Jalpaiguri (6 km from Siliguri) to Darjeeling in West Bengal, run by the Indian Railways. It was built between 1878 and 1881 and is about 86 kilometers long. The elevation level is from about 100 m (328 ft) at Siliguri to about 2,200 meters (7,218 ft) at Darjeeling. It is still powered by steam locomotives. Modern diesel engines are used for Darjeeling’s mail train. Since 1999 the train has been a World Heritage List as listed by UNESCO. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway : Overview Route Services Information Timetable Tariff Reservations\n\n10. Route Map\n\n11. Route New Jalpaiguri - the railway was extended to the south in 1964 to meet the new Broad gauge to Assam. Where the two met, New Jalpaiguri was created. Siliguri Town - original southern terminus of the line. Sukna - this station marks the change in the landscape from the flat plains to the wooded lower slopes of the mountains. The gradient of the railway changes dramatically. Loop no. 1 and 2 were removed after flood threats. Rang tong Loop no. 3 is at Chunbatti. This is now the lowest loop. Reverses no. 2 & 3 are between Chunbatti and Tindharia. Tindharia - this is a major station on the line as below the station is the workshops. There is also an office for the engineers and a large locomotive shed, all on a separate site. Immediately above the station are three sidings; these were used to inspect the carriage while the locomotive was changed, before the train continued towards Darjeeling. Agony Point is the name given to loop No.4. It comes from the shape of the loop which comes to an apex which is the tightest curve on the line. Gayabari. Reverse No.6 is the last reverse on the climb. Mahanadi Darjeeling Himalayan Railway : Overview Route Services Information Timetable Tariff Reservations\n\n12. contd… Kurseong - there is a shed here and a few sidings adjacent to the main line, but the station proper is a dead end. Up trains must reverse out of the station (across a busy road junction) before they can continue on their climb. It is said that the station was built this way so that the train could enter a secure yard and stay there while the passengers left the train for refreshments. Above Kurseong station, the railway runs through the bazaar. Trains skirt the front of shops and market stalls on this busy stretch of road. Tung Dilaram Sonada Rangbul Jor Bungalow Ghum - Summit of the line and highest station in India. Now includes a museum on the first floor of the station building with larger exhibits in the old goods yard.

Overview The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) connects the town of Mettupalayam with the hill station of Udagamandalam (Ootacamund or Ooty), in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. It is the only rack railway in India and uses the Abt (alternate biting) rack and pinion system. In this system, between the two conventional rails, there are two rack bars, out of step with each other, on which the pinions of the locos and coaches 'climb' in a similar manner as a person climbing a ladder using his feet alternately. Established in the early 19th century by the British as the summer headquarters of the Chennai government, Ooty is now a soothing place for visitors to escape the summer heat. The historic railway line was completed in 1899, 45 years after the first plans were drawn up. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was inscribed as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2005.

Leaving Mettupalayam, the line is adhesion worked and actually drops for a short distance before crossing the Bhavani River, after which it starts to climb gently. Kallar - 8 km, 1,260 ft (384 m) - Closed as a passenger station, this is where the rack rail begins. As the train leaves the station, the gradient is 1 in 12 (8.33%).

The main cylinders of the locomotive use high-pressure steam and drive the wheels of the loco while the smaller cylinders using low-pressure steam drive the rack system of the Nilgiri Railway system.
