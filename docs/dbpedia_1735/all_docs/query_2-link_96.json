        "text": "India Location\n\nThe southern part of the country lies within the tropics and the northern part lies in the sub-tropical zone or the warm temperate zone.\n\nOur southern boundary extends upto 6°45′ N latitude in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India, they are roughly about 30 degrees, whereas the actual distance measured from north to south extremity is 3,214 km, and that from east to west is only 2,933 km.\n\nThis location is responsible for large variations in land forms, climate, soil types and natural vegetation in the country.\n\nThe presence of lofty mountains in the north;\n\nLarge rivers such as Ganga, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari and Kaveri;\n\nGreen forested hills in northeast and south India; and the vast sandy expanse of Marusthali.\n\nBounded by the Himalayas in the north, Hindukush and Sulaiman ranges in the northwest, Purvachal hills in the north-east and\n\nBy the large expanse of the Indian ocean in the south, it forms a great geographic entity known as the Indian subcontinent.\n\nPeninsular part of India extends towards the Indian Ocean. This has provided the country with a coastline of 6,100 km in the mainland and 7,517 km in the entire geographical coast of the mainland\n\nThe sea upto 12 nautical miles (about 21.9 km) from the coast.\n\nThere is a general understanding among the countries of the world to select the standard meridian in multiples of 7°30′ of longitude\n\nPHYSIOGRAPHY\n\nSTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY\n\nBased on the variations in its geological structure and formations, India can be divided into three geological divisions. These geological regions broadly follow the physical features\n\nThe Peninsular Block\n\nThe Himalayas and other Peninsular Mountains\n\nIndo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain\n\nTHE PENINSULAR BLOCK\n\nThe northern boundary of the Peninsular Block may be taken as an irregular line running from Kachchh along the western flank of the Aravali Range near Delhi and then roughly parallel to the Yamuna and the Ganga as far as the Rajmahal Hills and the Ganga delta. Apart from these, the Karbi Anglong and the Meghalaya Plateau in the northeast and Rajasthan in the west are also extensions of this block.\n\nThe north-eastern parts are separated by the Malda fault in West Bengal from the Chotanagpur plateau. In Rajasthan, the desert and other desert–like features overlay this block\n\nThe Indo-Australian Plate\n\nThe rift valleys of the Narmada, the Tapi and the Mahanadi and the Satpura block mountains are some examples of it.\n\nThe Peninsula mostly consists of relict and residual mountains like the Aravali hills, the Nallamala hills, the Javadi hills, the Veliconda hills, the Palkonda range and the Mahendragiri hills, etc.\n\nMost of the east flowing rivers form deltas before entering into the Bay of Bengal. The deltas formed by the Mahanadi, the Krishna, the Kaveri and the Godavari are important examples\n\nTHE HIMALAYAS AND OTHER PENINSULAR MOUNTAINS\n\nThese mountains are tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage.\n\nVarious landforms like gorges, V-shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls, etc. are indicative of this stage.\n\nINDO-GANGA-BRAHMAPUTRA PLAIN\n\nThe third geological division of India comprises the plains formed by the river Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. Originally, it was a geo-synclinal depression which attained its maximum development\n\nDuring the third phase of the Himalayan mountain formation approximately about 64 million years ago.\n\nSince then, it has been gradually filled by the sediments brought by the Himalayan and Peninsular rivers. Average depth of alluvial deposits in these plains ranges from 1,000-2,000 m.\n\nPHYSIOGRAPHY\n\n‘Physiography’ of an area is the outcome of structure, process and the stage of development.\n\nBased on these macro variations, India can be divided into the following physiographic divisions:\n\nThe Northern and North-eastern Mountains\n\nThe Northern Plain\n\nThe Peninsular Plateau\n\nThe Indian Desert\n\nThe Coastal Plains\n\nThe Islands.\n\nThe approximate length of the Great Himalayan range, also known as the central axial range, is 2,500 km from east to west, and their width varies between 160-400 km from north to south.\n\nOn the basis of relief, alignment of ranges and other geomorphological features, the Himalayas can be divided into the following sub-divisions:\n\nKashmir or Northwestern Himalayas\n\nHimachal and Uttaranchal Himalayas\n\nDarjiling and Sikkim Himalayas\n\nArunachal Himalayas\n\nEastern Hills and Mountains.\n\nKashmir or North-western Himalayas\n\nIt comprises a series of ranges such as the Karakoram, Ladakh, Zaskar and Pir Panjal. The north-eastern part of the Kashmir Himalayas is a cold desert, which lies between the Greater Himalayas and the Karakoram ranges\n\nBetween the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal range, lie the world famous valley of Kashmir and the famous Dal Lake.\n\nsome famous places of pilgrimage such as Vaishno Devi, Amarnath Cave, Charar -e-Sharif, etc. are also located here and large number of pilgrims\n\nSrinagar, capital city of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is located on the banks of Jhelum River. Dal Lake in Srinagar presents an interesting physical feature.\n\nIn Kashmir Valley, the meanders in Jhelum river are caused by the local base level provided by the erstwhile larger lake of which the present Dal Lake is a small part\n\nThe Himachal and Uttaranchal Himalayas\n\nThis part lies approximately between the Ravi in the west and the Kali (a tributary of Ghaghara) in the east. It is drained by two major river systems of India, i.e. the Indus and the Ganga. Tributaries of the Indus include the river Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj, and the tributaries of Ganga flowing through this region include the Yamuna and the Ghaghara.\n\nAll the three ranges of Himalayas are prominent in this section also. These are the Great Himalayan range, the Lesser Himalayas (which is locally known as Dhaoladhar in Himachal Pradesh and Nagtibha in Uttaranchal) and the Shiwalik range from the North to the South.\n\nsome of the important hill stations such as Dharamshala, Mussoorie, Shimla, Kaosani and the cantonment towns and health resorts such as Shimla, Mussoorie, Kasauli, Almora, Lansdowne and Ranikhet, etc. were developed in this region.\n\nSome important duns located in this region are the Chandigarh-Kalka dun, Nalagarh dun, Dehra Dun, Harike dun and the Kota dun, etc. Dehra Dun is the largest of all the duns with an approximate length of 35-45 km and a width of 22-25 km.\n\nThe famous ‘Valley of flowers’ is also situated in this region. The places of pilgrimage such as the Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib are also situated in this part. The region is also known to have five famous Prayags.\n\nThe Shiwalik\n\nThe word shiwalik has its origin in the geological formation found in and around a place called Sivawala near Dehra Dun which was once a headquarter of the Imperial Survey and which subsequently established its permanent headquarters at Dehra Dun\n\nThe Darjiling and Sikkim Himalayas\n\nThey are flanked by Nepal Himalayas in the west and Bhutan Himalayas in the east. It is relatively small but is a most significant part of the Himalayas. Known for its fast-flowing rivers such as Tista, it is a region of high mountain peaks like Kanchenjunga (Kanchengiri), and deep valleys.\n\nIntroduced tea plantations in this region\n\nIn place of the Shiwaliks here, the ‘duar formations’ are important, which have also been used for the development of tea gardens.\n\nSikkim and Darjiling Himalayas are also known for their scenic beauty and rich flora and fauna, particularly various types of orchids.\n\nThe Arunachal Himalayas\n\nSome of the important mountain peaks of the region are Kangtu and Namcha Barwa.\n\nSome of the important rivers are the Kameng, the\n\nSubansiri, the Dihang, the Dibang and the Lohit.\n\nThe highest hydro-electric power potential in the country.\n\nAn important aspect of the Arunachal Himalayas is the numerous ethnic tribal communities inhabiting in these areas. Some of the prominent ones from west to east are the Monpa, Daffla, Abor, Mishmi, Nishi and the Nagas.\n\nMost of these communities practise Jhumming.\n\nThe Eastern Hills and Mountains\n\nThey are known by different local names. In the north, they are known as Patkai Bum, Naga Hills, and the Manipur hills and in the south as Mizo or Lushai hills.\n\nThese are low hills, inhabited by numerous tribal groups practising Jhum cultivation.\n\nThe Barak is an important river in Manipur and Mizoram\n\nThe physiography of Manipur is unique by the presence of a large lake known as ‘Loktak’ lake at the centre, surrounded by mountains from all sides. Mizoram which is also known as the ‘Molassis basin’ which is made up of soft unconsolidated deposits.\n\nMost of the rivers in Nagaland form the tributary of the Brahmaputra. While two rivers of Mizoram and Manipur are the tributaries of the Barak river\n\nThe Northern Plains\n\nThe northern plains are formed by the alluvial deposits brought by the rivers – the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra\n\nThese can be divided into three major zones: the Bhabar, the Tarai and the alluvial plains. The alluvial plains can be further divided into the Khadar and the Bhangar.\n\nBhabar is a narrow belt ranging between 8-10 km parallel to the Shiwalik foothills at the break-up of the slope. As a result of this, the streams and rivers coming from the mountains deposit heavy materials of rocks and boulders\n\nSouth of the Bhabar is the Tarai belt, with an approximate width of 10-20 km where most of the streams and rivers re-emerge without having any properly demarcated channel, thereby, creating marshy and swampy conditions known as the Tarai. This has a luxurious growth of natural vegetation and houses a varied wild life\n\nThe south of Tarai is a belt consisting of old and new alluvial deposits known as the Bhangar and Khadar respectively. These plains have characteristic features of mature stage of fluvial erosional and depositional landforms such as sand bars, meanders, oxbow lakes and braided channels.\n\nThe mouths of these mighty rivers also form some of the largest deltas of the world, for example, the famous Sunderbans delta.\n\nThe Peninsular Plateau\n\nRising from the height of 150 m above the river plains up to an elevation of 600-900 m is the irregular triangle known as the peninsular plateau.\n\nDelhi ridge in the northwest, (extension of Aravalis), the Rajmahal hills in the east, Gir range in the west and the Cardamom hills in the south constitute the outer extent of the peninsular plateau.\n\nThe Peninsular India is made up of a series of patland plateaus such as the Hazaribagh plateau, the Palamu plateau, the Ranchi plateau, the Malwa plateau, the Coimbatore plateau and the Karnataka plateau, etc. This is one of the oldest and the most stable landmass of India.\n\nThe western and north-western part of the plateau has an emphatic presence of black soil.\n\nThe north-western part of the plateau has a complex relief of ravines and gorges. The ravines of Chambal, Bhind and Morena are some of the well-known examples\n\nOn the basis of the prominent relief features, the peninsular plateau can be divided into three broad groups:\n\nThe Deccan Plateau\n\nThe Central Highlands\n\nThe North-eastern Plateau\n\nThe Deccan Plateau\n\nWestern Ghats are locally known by different names such as Sahyadris in Maharashtra, Nilgiri hills in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Anaimalai hills and Cardamom hills in Kerala.\n\nThis is bordered by the Western Ghats in the west, Eastern Ghats in the east and the Satpura, Maikal range and Mahadeo hills in the north.\n\n‘Anaimudi’ (2,695 m), the highest peak of Peninsular plateau is located on the Anaimalai hills of the Western Ghats followed by Dodabetta (2,637 m) on the Nilgiri hills.\n\nSome of the important ranges include the Javadi hills, the Palconda range, the Nallamala hills, the Mahendragiri hills, etc.\n\nThe Eastern and the Western Ghats meet each other at the Nilgiri hills.\n\nThe Central Highlands\n\nIt is a classic example of the relict mountains which are highly denuded and form discontinuous ranges.\n\nThis region has undergone metamorphic processes in its geological history, which can be corroborated by the presence of metamorphic rocks such as marble, slate, gneiss, etc\n\nThe general elevation of the Central Highlands ranges between 700-1,000 m above the mean sea level and it slopes towards the north and northeastern directions. Most of the tributaries of the river Yamuna have their origin in the Vindhyan and Kaimur ranges.\n\nBanas is the only significant tributary of the river Chambal that originates from the Aravalli in the west. An eastern extension of the Central Highland is formed by the Rajmahal hills, to the south of which lies a large reserve of mineral resources in the Chotanagpur plateau\n\nThe Northeastern Plateau\n\nToday, the Meghalaya and Karbi Anglong plateau stand detached from the main Peninsular Block. The Meghalaya plateau is further sub-divided into three:\n\nThe Garo Hills;\n\nThe Khasi Hills;\n\nThe Jaintia Hills, named after the tribal groups inhabiting this region.\n\nAn extension of this is also seen in the Karbi Anglong hills of Assam. Similar to the Chotanagpur plateau, the Meghalaya plateau is also rich in mineral resources like coal, iron ore, sillimanite, limestone and uranium.\n\nThis area receives maximum rainfall from the south west monsoon. As a result, the Meghalaya plateau has a highly eroded surface. Cherrapunji displays a bare rocky surface devoid of any permanent vegetation cover.\n\nThe Indian Desert\n\nThis region receives low rainfall below 150 mm per year; hence, it has arid climate with low vegetation cover. It is because of these characteristic features that this is also known as Marusthali.\n\nTo the northwest of the Aravali hills lies the Great Indian Desert. It is a land of undulating topography dotted with longitudinal dunes and barchans.\n\nOn the basis of the orientation, the desert can be divided into two parts: the northern part is sloping towards Sindh and the southern towards the Rann of Kachchh. Most of the rivers in this region are ephemeral. The Luni River flowing in the southern part of the desert is of some significance. Low precipitation and high evaporation makes it a water deficit region.\n\nThe Coastal Plains\n\nIt can be broadly divided into two:\n\nthe western coastal plains;\n\nThe eastern coastal plains.\n\nIt is believed that the city of Dwaraka which was once a part of the Indian mainland situated along the west coast is submerged under water. Because of this submergence it is a narrow belt and provides natural conditions for the development of ports and harbours.\n\nKandla, Mazagaon, JLN port Navha Sheva, Marmagao, Mangalore, Cochin, etc. are some of the important natural ports located along the west coast.\n\nThe Kachchh and Kathiawar coast in Gujarat, Konkan coast in Maharashtra, Goan coast and Malabar Coast in Karnataka and Kerala respectively.\n\nEvery year the famous Nehru Trophy Vallamkali (boat race) is held in Punnamada Kayalin Kerala\n\nThere are well developed deltas here, formed by the rivers flowing eastward in to the Bay of Bengal. These include the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri. Because of its emergent nature, it has less number of ports and harbours.\n\nThe Islands\n\nThe Bay of Bengal island groups consist of about 572 islands/islets.\n\nThese are situated roughly between 6°N-14°N and 92°E -94°E.\n\nThe two principal groups of islets include the Ritchie’s archipelago and the Labrynth Island.\n\nThe entire group of island is divided into two broad categories – the Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south. They are separated by a water body which is called the Ten degree channel.\n\nSome important mountain peaks in Andaman and Nicobar Islands are\n\nSaddle peak (North Andaman – 738 m),\n\nMount Diavolo (Middle Andaman – 515 m),\n\nMount Koyob (South Andaman – 460 m) and\n\nMount Thuiller (Great Nicobar – 642 m).\n\nBarren Island, the only active volcano in India is also situated in the Nicobar Islands\n\nThe islands of the Arabian Sea include Lakshadweep and Minicoy.\n\nThese are scattered between 8°N-12°N and 71°E -74°E longitude\n\nThere are approximately 36 islands of which 11 are inhabited.\n\nMinicoy is the largest island with an area of 453 sq. km.\n\nThe entire group of islands is broadly divided by the Eleventh degree channel, north of which is the Amini Island and to the south of the Canannore Island.\n\nClimate\n\nThe word monsoon is derived from the Arabic word ‘mausim’ which literally means season.\n\n‘Monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year.\n\nClimate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years).\n\nWeather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation.\n\nIn the Thar Desert the day temperature may rise to 50°C, and drop down to near 15°C the same night.\n\nHimalayas protect the subcontinent from extremely cold winds from central Asia. This enables northern India to have uniformly higher temperatures when compared to other areas on the same latitudes.\n\nSimilarly, the peninsular plateau, under the influence of the sea from three sides, has moderate temperatures.\n\nCLIMATIC CONTROLS\n\nThere are six major controls of the climate of any place. They are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features.\n\nDue to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude\n\nAs one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers\n\nThe hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place.\n\nAs the distance from the sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality (i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters).\n\nOcean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING INDIA’S CLIMATE\n\nLatitude\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east.\n\nAlmost half of the country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics. Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates\n\nAltitude\n\nIndia has mountains to the north, which have an average height of about 6,000 metres.\n\nThe Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is because of these mountains that this subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to central Asia.\n\nPressure and Winds\n\nPressure and surface winds;\n\nUpper air circulation; and\n\nWestern cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones\n\nThese jet streams are located approximately over 27°-30° north latitude, therefore, they are known as subtropical westerly jet streams\n\nAn easterly jet stream, called the tropical easterly jet stream blows over peninsular India, approximately over 14°N during the summer months\n\nJet stream\n\nThese are a narrow belt of high altitude (above 12,000 m) westerly winds in the troposphere. Their speed varies from about 110 km/h in summer to about 184 km/h in winter. A number of separate jet streams have been identified. The most constant are the mid-latitude and the sub-tropical jet stream.\n\nWestern Cyclonic Disturbances\n\nThe western cyclonic disturbances are weather phenomena of the winter months brought in by the westerly flow from the Mediterranean region. They usually influence the weather of the north and north-western regions of India. Tropical cyclones occur during the monsoon as well as in October -November, and are part of the easterly flow\n\nCoriolis force\n\nAn apparent force caused by the earth’s rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.\n\nTHE INDIAN MONSOON\n\nThe differential heating and cooling of land and water creates low pressure on the landmass of India while the seas around experience comparatively high pressure.\n\nThe shift of the position of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)in summer, over the Ganga plain (this is the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator – also known as the monsoon trough during the monsoon season).\n\nThe presence of the high-pressure area, east of Madagascar, approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.\n\nThe Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer, which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of high pressure over the plateau at about 9 km above sea level.\n\nThe movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian peninsula during summer\n\nInter Tropical Convergence Zone\n\nThe Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ,) is a broad trough of low pressure in equatorial latitudes. This is where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. This convergence zone lies more or less parallel to the equator but moves north or south with the apparent movement of the sun.\n\nEl Nino\n\nThis is a name given to the periodic development of a warm ocean current along the coast of Peru as a temporary replacement of the cold Peruvian current. ‘El Nino’ is a Spanish word meaning ‘the child’, and refers to the baby Christ, as this current starts flowing during Christmas. The presence of the El Nino leads to an increase in sea-surface temperatures and weakening of the trade winds in the region\n\nTHE ONSET OF THE MONSOON AND WITHDRAWAL\n\nThe duration of the monsoon is between 100-120 days from early June to mid-September.\n\nThe monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula generally by the first week of June. Subsequently, it divides into two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch. The Arabian Sea branch reaches Mumbai about ten days later on approximately the 10 th of June. This is a fairly rapid advance. The Bay of Bengal branch also advances rapidly and arrives in Assam in the first week of June.\n\nThe Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal branches of the monsoon merge over the north western part of the Ganga plains.\n\nThe withdrawal of the monsoon begins in north western states of India by early September.\n\nBy early December, the monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country\n\nTHE SEASONS\n\nFour main seasons can be identified in India – the cold weather season, the hot weather season, the advancing monsoon and the retreating monsoon with some regional variations.\n\nThe Cold Weather Season (winter)\n\nThe cold weather season begins from mid-November in northern India and stays till February. December and January are the coldest months in the northern part of India.\n\nA characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the northern plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwest. These low-pressure systems, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and move into India, along with the westerly flow.\n\nThe Hot Weather Season (summer)\n\nDue to the apparent northward movement of the sun, the global heat belt shifts northward. As such, from March to May, it is hot weather season in India\n\nA striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day over the north and north western India.\n\nTowards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to as ‘mango showers’.\n\nAdvancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)\n\nThese winds are strong and blow at an average velocity of 30 km per hour.\n\nThe inflow of the south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in the weather.\n\nEarly in the season, the windward side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan Plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in spite of lying in the rain shadow area. The maximum rainfall of this season is received in the north-eastern part of the country. Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world\n\nRetreating Monsoon (The Transition Season)\n\nDuring October-November, The south-west monsoon winds weaken and start withdrawing gradually. By the beginning of October, the monsoon withdraws from the Northern Plains\n\nOwing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive during the day. This is commonly known as ‘October heat’\n\nThe low-pressure conditions, over north western India, get transferred to the Bay of Bengal by early November. This shift is associated with the occurrence of cyclonic depressions, which originate over the Andaman Sea.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF RAINFALL\n\nThe western coast and north eastern India receive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually\n\nRainfall is equally low in the interior of the Deccan plateau, and east of the Sahyadris.\n\nA third area of low precipitation is around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest of the country receives moderate rainfall. Snowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region\n\nMawsynram, the wettest place on the earth is also reputed for its stalagmite and stalactite caves\n\nIndia Size and Location\n\nLOCATION\n\nThe main land extends between latitudes 8°4’N and 37°6’N and longitudes 68°7’E and 97°25’E.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer (23° 30’N) divides the country into almost two equal parts.\n\nThe southernmost point of the Indian Union– ‘Indira Point’ got submerged under the sea water in 2004 during the Tsunami.\n\nSIZE\n\nThe land mass of India has an area of 28 million square km. India’s total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical area of the world.\n\nTime along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30’E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country\n\nIndia has a land boundary of about 15,200 km and the total length of the coast line of the mainland including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep is 7,516.6 km.\n\nINDIA AND THE WORLD\n\nSince the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, India’s distance from Europe has been reduced by 7,000 km.\n\nBefore 1947, there were two types of states in India – the provinces and the Princely states. Provinces were ruled directly by British officials who were appointed by the Viceroy. Princely states were ruled by local, hereditary rulers, who acknowledged sovereignty in return for local autonomy.\n\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA\n\nThe northern mountains are the major sources of water and forest wealth. The northern plains are the granaries of the country. They provide the base for early civilisations.\n\nThe plateau is a storehouse of minerals, which has played a crucial role in the industrialisation of the country.\n\nThe coastal region and island groups provide sites for fishing and port activities. Thus, the diverse physical features of the land have immense future possibilities of development.\n\nThe Theory of Plate Tectonics: According to this theory, the crust (upper part) of the earth has been formed out of seven major and some minor plates.\n\nBroadly, these plate movements are classified into three types\n\nWhile some plates come towards each other and form convergent boundary.\n\nSome plates move away from each other and form divergent boundary.\n\nAt times, they may also move horizontally past each other and form transform boundary.\n\nThe oldest landmass, (the Peninsula part), was a part of the Gondwana land. The Gondwana land included India, Australia, South Africa and South America as one single land mass.\n\nDue to collision with Eurasian Plate, the sedimentary rocks which were accumulated in the geosyncline known as the Tethys were folded to form the mountain system of western Asia and Himalaya.\n\nGondwanaland: It is the southern part of the ancient super continent Pangea with Angara Land in the northern part.\n\nThe northern plains are formed of alluvial deposits.\n\nThe peninsular plateau is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks with gently rising hills and wide valleys\n\nMAJOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC DIVISIONS\n\nThe Himalayan Mountains\n\nThe Northern Plains\n\nThe Peninsular Plateau\n\nThe Indian Desert\n\nThe Coastal Plains\n\nThe Islands\n\nThe Himalayan Mountains\n\nThese mountain ranges run in a west-east direction from the Indus to the Brahmaputra.\n\nThe Himalaya consists of three parallel ranges in its longitudinal extent\n\nThe northern most range is known as the Great or Inner Himalayas or the ‘Himadri’.\n\nThe range lying to the south of the Himadri forms the most rugged mountain system and is known as Himachal or lesser Himalaya.\n\nWhile the Pir Panjal range forms the longest and the most important range, the Dhaula Dhar and the Mahabharat ranges are also prominent ones\n\nThis range consists of the famous valley of Kashmir, the Kangra and Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe outer most range of the Himalayas is called the Shiwaliks.\n\nThe longitudinal valley lying between lesser Himalaya and the Shiwaliks are known as Duns. Dehra Dun, Kotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of the well-known Duns.\n\nThe Brahmaputra marks the eastern most boundaries of the Himalayas. They are known as the Purvanchal or the Eastern hills and mountains.\n\nThe Purvanchal comprises the Patkai hills, the Naga Hills, Manipur hills and the Mizo hills.\n\nThe Northern Plain\n\nThe northern plain has been formed by the interplay of the three major river systems, namely– the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries. This plain is formed of alluvial soil.\n\nMajuli, in the Brahmaputra River is the largest inhabited riverine island in the world\n\nThe Northern Plain is broadly divided into three sections.\n\nThe Western part of the Northern Plain is referred to as the Punjab Plains. Formed by the Indus and its tributaries, the larger part of this plain lies in Pakistan.\n\nThe Indus and its tributaries–the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj originate in the Himalaya. This section of the plain is dominated by the doabs.\n\nThe Ganga plain extends between Ghaggar and Teesta rivers. It is spread over the states of North India, Haryana, Delhi, U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and West Bengal to its East, particularly in Assam lays the Brahmaputra plain.\n\nAccording to the variations in relief features, the Northern plains can be divided into four regions.\n\nBhabar, all the streams disappear in this bhabar belt.\n\nSouth of this belt, the streams and rivers re-emerge and create a wet, swampy and marshy region known as\n\nThe largest part of the northern plain is formed of older alluvium. They lie above the flood plains of the rivers and present a terrace like feature. This part is known as\n\nThe soil in this region contains calcareous deposits locally known as kankar. The newer, younger deposits of the flood plains are called\n\nThe Peninsular Plateau\n\nThe Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks.\n\nThis plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the Central Highlands and the Deccan Plateau.\n\nThe part of the peninsular plateau lying to the north of the Narmada River covering a major area of the Malwa plateau is known as the Central Highlands.\n\nThe Vindhyas range is bounded by the Central Highlands on the south and\n\nThe Aravalli on the northwest\n\nThe flow of the rivers draining this region, namely the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and Ken is from southwest to northeast, thus indicating the slope.\n\nThe eastward extensions of this plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand. The Chotanagpur plateau marks the further eastward extension, drained by the Damodar River.\n\nThe Deccan Plateau is a triangular landmass that lies to the south of the river Narmada. The Satpura range flanks its broad base in the north while the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the Maikal range from its eastern extensions.\n\nAn extension of the Plateau is also visible in the northeast– locally known as the Meghalaya and Karbi-Anglong Plateau.\n\nThree Prominent hill ranges from the west to east are the Garo, the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills.\n\nThe highest peaks include the Anai Mudi (2,695metres) and\n\nThe Doda Betta (2,637 metres)\n\nMahendragiri (1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the Eastern Ghats.\n\nShevroy Hills and the Javadi Hills are located to the southeast of the Eastern Ghats.\n\nOne of the distinct features of the peninsular plateau is the black soil area known as Deccan Trap. This is of volcanic origin hence the rocks are igneous.\n\nThe Indian Desert\n\nThe Indian desert lies towards the western margins of the Aravali Hills.\n\nIt has arid climate with low vegetation cover.\n\nLuni is the only large river in this region.\n\nThe Coastal Plains\n\nThe western coast, sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain.\n\nIt consists of three sections.\n\nThe northern part of the coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai – Goa),\n\nThe central stretch is called the Kannad Plain\n\nWhile the southern stretch is referred to as the Malabar Coast\n\nThe plain along the Bay of Bengal are wide and level.\n\nIn the northern part, it is referred to as the Northern Circar,\n\nWhile the southern part is known as the Coromandal Coast.\n\nLarge rivers such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri have farmed extensive delta on this coast.\n\nThe Chilika Lake is the largest salt water lake in India. It lies in the state of Orissa, to the south of the Mahanadi delta along the eastern coast.\n\nThe Islands\n\nThe Lakshadweep Islands group lying close to the Malabar coast of Kerala.\n\nEarlier they were known as Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive. In 1973 these were named as Lakshadweep.\n\nKavaratti Island is the administrative headquarters of Lakshadweep.\n\nThe Patli Island, which is uninhabited, has a bird sanctuary.\n\nThe Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south.\n\nIt is believed that these islands are an elevated portion of submarine mountains.\n\nIndia’s only active volcano is found on Barren Island in Andaman and Nicobar group of Islands.\n\nGeography as a Discipline\n\nIn very simple words, it can be said that geography is the description of the earth. The term geography was first coined by Eratosthenese, a Greek scholar (276-194 BC.). The word has been derived from two roots from Greek language geo (earth) and graphos (description)\n\nThe earth has always been seen as the abode of human beings and thus, scholars defined geography as, “the description of the earth as the abode of human beings”.\n\nGeography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth’s surface. Richard Hartshorne\n\nGeography studies the differences of phenomena usually related in different parts of the earth’s surface. Hettner\n\nGEOGRAPHY AS AN INTEGRATING DISCIPLINE\n\nGeography is a discipline of synthesis. It attempts spatial synthesis, and history attempts temporal synthesis. Its approach is holistic in nature. It recognises the fact that the world is a system of interdependencies\n\nThe changes in landforms, climate, vegetation, economic activities occupations and cultural developments have followed a definite historical course.\n\nIt is possible to convert time in terms of space and space in terms of time\n\nIt is for this reason; time is an integral part of geographical studies as the fourth dimension\n\nPhysical Geography and Natural Sciences\n\nThe traditional physical geography is linked with geology, meteorology, hydrology and pedology, and thus, geomorphology, climatology, oceanography and soil geography respectively have very close link with the natural sciences as these derive their data from these sciences.\n\nBio-Geography is closely related to botany, zoology as well as ecology as human beings are located in different locational niche\n\nThe shape of the earth is Geoid but the basic tool of a geographer is a map which is two dimensional representation of the earth.\n\nThe cartographic and quantitative techniques require sufficient proficiency in mathematics, statistics and econometrics. Maps are prepared through artistic imagination. Making sketches, mental maps and cartographic work require proficiency in arts.\n\nBRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY\n\nThe major approaches to study geography have been\n\nSystematic and\n\nRegional\n\nThe systematic geography approach is the same as that of general geography. This approach was introduced by Alexander Von Humboldt, a German geographer (1769-1859)\n\nWhile regional geography approach was developed by another German geographer and a contemporary of Humboldt, Karl Ritter (1779-1859).\n\nIn systematic approach, a phenomenon is studied world over as a whole, and then the identification of typologies or spatial patterns is done\n\nThe typologies such as equatorial rain forests or softwood conical forests or monsoon forests, etc. will be identified, discussed and delimited.\n\nIn the regional approach, the world is divided into regions at different hierarchical levels and then all the geographical phenomena in a particular region are studied. These regions may be natural, political or designated region. The phenomena in a region are studied in a holistic manner searching for unity in diversity.\n\nBRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY (BASED ON SYSTEMATIC APPROACH)\n\nPhysical Geography\n\nGeomorphology is devoted to the study of landforms, their evolution and related processes.\n\nClimatology encompasses the study of structure of atmosphere and elements of weather and climates and climatic types and regions\n\nHydrology studies the realm of water over the surface of the earth including oceans, lakes, rivers and other water bodies and its effect on different life forms including human life and their activities.\n\nSoil Geography is devoted to study the processes of soil formation, soil types, their fertility status, distribution and use.\n\nHuman Geography\n\nSocial/Cultural Geography encompasses the study of society and its spatial dynamics as well as the cultural elements contributed by the society.\n\nPopulation and Settlement Geography (Rural and Urban). It studies population growth, distribution, density, sex ratio, migration and occupational structure etc. Settlement geography studies the characteristics of rural and urban settlements.\n\nEconomic Geography studies economic activities of the people including agriculture, industry, tourism, trade, and transport, infrastructure and services, etc.\n\nHistorical Geography studies the historical processes through which the space gets organised. Every region has undergone some historical experiences before attaining the present day status. The geographical features also experience temporal changes and these form the concerns of historical geography\n\nPolitical Geography looks at the space from the angle of political events and studies boundaries, space relations between neighbouring political units, delimitation of constituencies, election scenario and develops theoretical framework to understand the political behavior of the population.\n\nBiogeography\n\nThe interface between physical geography and human geography has lead to the development of Biogeography which includes:\n\nPlant Geography which studies the spatial pattern of natural vegetation in their habitats\n\nZoo Geography which studies the spatial patterns and geographic characteristics of animals and their habitats\n\nEcology /Ecosystem deals with the scientific study of the habitats characteristic of species\n\nEnvironmental Geography concerns world over leading to the realisation of environmental problems such as land gradation, pollution and concerns for conservation has resulted in the introduction of this new branch in geography\n\nBRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY BASED ON REGIONAL APPROACH\n\nRegional Studies/Area Studies Comprising Macro, Meso and Micro Regional Studies\n\nRegional Planning Comprising Country/Rural and Town/ Urban Planning\n\nRegional Development\n\nRegional Analysis There are two aspects which are common to every discipline, these are:\n\nPhilosophy\n\nGeographical Thought\n\nLand and Human Interaction/ Human Ecology\n\nMethods and Techniques\n\nCartography including Computer Cartography\n\nQuantitative Techniques/Statistical Techniques\n\nField Survey Methods\n\nGeo-informatics comprising techniques such as Remote Sensing, GIS, GPS, etc.\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ITS IMPORTANCE\n\nPhysical geography includes the study of\n\nLithosphere (landforms, drainage, relief and physiography),\n\nAtmosphere (its composition, structure, elements and controls of weather and climate; temperature, pressure, winds, precipitation, climatic types, etc.),\n\nHydrosphere (oceans, seas, lakes and associated features with water realm) and\n\nBiosphere ( life forms including human being and macro-organism and their sustaining mechanism, viz. food chain, ecological parameters and ecological balance).\n\nSoils are formed through the process of pedogenesis and depend upon the parent rocks, climate, biological activity and time.\n\nThe plains are utilised for agriculture. Plateaus provide forests and minerals. Mountains provide pastures, forests, tourist spots and are sources of rivers providing water to lowlands.\n\nClimate influences our house types, clothing and food habits. The climate has a profound effect on vegetation, cropping pattern, livestock farming and some industries, etc.\n\nTemperature and precipitation ensure the density of forests and quality of grassland.\n\nIn India, monsoonal rainfall sets the agriculture rhythm in motion. Precipitation recharges the ground water aquifers which later provide water for agriculture and domestic use.\n\nOceans are rich in mineral resources. India has developed the technology for collecting manganese nodules from oceanic bed."
