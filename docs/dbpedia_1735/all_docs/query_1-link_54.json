        "text": "Barog derives its name from the British engineer, Col Barog, who was entrusted with the task of building one of the tunnels on Kalka Shimla Railway in early 1900. Unfortunately, he could not complete the task and was penalised by the British because of which he committed suicide in front of the unfinished tunnel. The tunnel was finally completed by engineer H.S. Harrington and this is the longest tunnel out of the 103 tunnels on Kalka Shimla Railway line which has now been declared as UNESCO heritage. Situated deep in the valley, Barog railway station is the most picturesque of all the stations on this entire route. It has also been featured in Anthony Bourdain’s show on CNN in 2014 and recently in Ranveer Brar’s show, Station Master’s Tiffin on Living Foods.\n\nBarog Railway Station is 4 km away from Meraki Holiday Home and can be reached by car in just 10 minutes with a further 10 minute trek down the valley\n\nDagshai is a historical town on the opposite hill of Barog. Situated at a height of 5690 ft Dagshai was established as a cantonment by the British due to its strategic location. Time stands still in this town that has remained untouched by the onslaught of reckless tourism. Visiting the cemeteries and churches here one is transported back into colonial times. It also has India’s second cellular jail built by the British in 1849.\n\nDaghshai is 10 km away from Meraki Holiday Home and takes nearly 20 minutes to climb up the steep hill by car.\n\nBarog also offers some interesting nature trails in the village side and one feels overwhelmed with the untouched beauty of this small town.\n\nMajor nearby tourist places that can be covered in a day long trip individually from Meraki Holiday Home\n\nKasauli 18 km 45 minutes\n\nShimla 53 km 1 hr, 50 minutes\n\nKufri 68 km 2 hr, 30 minutes\n\nChail 52 km 1 hr, 50 minutes\n\nClimate in Barog\n\nSummers are pleasant at temperatures ranging between 23°C and 10°C and winters are slightly harsh ranging between 15°C and 5°C. Summers in Barog typically last from April till July. October to February is the Winter season in Barog. During the month of January, Barog becomes a visual delight with the snowfall arriving in. Barog witnesses heavy rainfall during the months of July, August and September. This monsoon season is the best time to visit the scenic hill station.\n\nHow to reach Barog\n\nBarog is situated at about 20 km from Kasauli, about 55 km from Shimla, 60 km from Chandigarh and 305 km from Delhi.

Nearest airport is Chandigarh International airport and it takes about two hours to reach Barog from the airport."
