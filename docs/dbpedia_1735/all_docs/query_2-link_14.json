Puducherry, Lakshadweep, Delhi, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli Daman and Diu and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nThe inception of Andhra Pradesh dates back to November 1956. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, receiving Presidential assent on March 1, 2014, led to the bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana operate under a bicameral legislature.\n\nGeography: Eastern Andhra encompasses the eastern part of the Deccan plateau and a substantial portion of the Eastern Ghats. The northern part is designated as the Telangana region, while the southern part is known as the Rayalaseema region. Lambasingi in Andhra Pradesh also referred to as the Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh, experiences snowfall.\n\nRivers: Major rivers such as Krishna, Godavari, and Pennar shape deltas in the coastal area of Andhra Pradesh. The state boasts a 972 km coastline, ranking second only to Gujarat.\n\nClimate: Andhra Pradesh experiences a generally hot and humid climate, with significant rainfall during the onset of the South-West monsoon. Approximately one-third of the total rainfall is attributed to the North-East monsoon.\n\nAgriculture: Around 68% of the state’s population is engaged in agriculture, with rice being the predominant food crop. Other crops include jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and millets.\n\nForests: Forests cover about 18.28% (29,784 sq km²) of the state’s geographical area.
