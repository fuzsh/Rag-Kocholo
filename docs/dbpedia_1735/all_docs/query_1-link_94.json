        "text": "Kalkaji Mandir, built-in 1764 AD in Nehru Place, is notable for worshipping Shakti Devi/Maa Kalka or Kali, an incarnation of Maa Durga. Kalkaji Mandir is also known as “Jayanti Peetha” or “Manokamana Sidha Peetha.”\n\nThe names are derived from the visitors’ prevalent belief in the fulfillment of their desires. Kalkaji Mandir is devoted to Goddess Parvati’s Kalka avatar, Who defeated the demon Raktabij.\n\nFurthermore, the temple is said to have existed since the Satya Yuga. It is thought that those who have faith in the goddess will receive whatever they desire in life, and locals from all walks of life, as well as visitors, flock to the temple. The temple is constructed of white marble and exudes piety and tranquility.\n\nThe temple is a miniature duplicate of the famed Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra, with two entrances for the convenience of its worshipers. One leads to Kalkaji’s main road, while the other leads to the metro station. There are small temples of Kal Bhairon and other gods inside the area as well. The temple complex has been refurbished over the years, and it is now made of brick, plaster, and marble. The Kali statue is housed in a central chamber surrounded by a verandah with 36 arches.\n\nBasic Information About Kalkaji Mandir Delhi –\n\nHistory of Kalkaji Temple Delhi\n\nThe temple has been around for over 3000 years. It was constructed in 1764. It is claimed that after being plagued by demons, all the deities went to Brahma Ji, but Brahma Ji recommended all the deities go to Mother Parvati. Then, pleased with the prayers and ceremonies performed by the gods and Brahma ji, he appeared at the temple site and blessed them before settling there.\n\nDuring the reign of Yudhishthira, Lord Krishna and the Pandavas are reported to have worshipped Kali in this temple. The temple is thought to have been built under Kali’s directions by Thok Brahmins and Thok Jogis. It is also known as the Jayanti Peeth or the Manokamna Siddha Peeth.\n\n“Manokamna” means “desire,” “Siddha” means “fulfillment,” and “Peetha” means “pilgrimage.” As a result, it is regarded as a holy temple where one might obtain Maa Kalika Devi’s blessings for the fulfillment of one’s aspirations.\n\nFestival at Kalkaji Temple Delhi\n\nEvery Hindu festival is commemorated in the Kalkaji Temple. During festive festivals and auspicious days, vast crowds of worshippers form serpentine lines to gain a glimpse of the goddess. However, each Navratri has its distinct area. In the temple, Navratris are celebrated with great zeal. During the Navratri celebrations, pilgrims and devotees flock to the shrine to pray.\n\nVasant Navratri– Because this is an autumn celebration, it is known as Vasant Navratri. It normally occurs in April, but this is subject to change according to the Hindu calendar. It is also known as Ram Navratri or Chaitra Navratri because it falls in the same month as Ram Navmi.\n\nMaha Navratri– All Indian states celebrate Maha Navratri with the same zeal. According to the Hindu calendar, it usually falls in October. During this event, a large audience gathers at the temple. Furthermore, during the event, worshippers make large offerings, including gold contributions.\n\nWhat are the timings of Kalkaji Mandir Delhi?"
