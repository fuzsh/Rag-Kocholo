A journey of about 2hrs. Upon arrival visit The Judge’s Court, Village Market and Lala Rerumal’s Haveli. After visits heck-in at the hotel. Overnight in the hotel.\n\nThe scenic Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh is no stranger to heritage and history. In fact, it even lends its name to a mid-18th century school of miniature painting. It is also home to Pragpur, a quaint little village that drew attention when the state government, in 1997, certified it as a Heritage Village, making it the first such village in India.\n\nThis is why, for an obscure part of Himachal Pradesh, Pragpur has houses in extremely varied architectural styles — Kangra, Rajput, British, Portuguese and even Italian. The grandest of these structures is The Judge’s Court, the 300-year-old ancestral home of Vijai and Rani Lal, which has been converted into a posh resort. Vijai Lal is the grandson of Justice Sir Jai Lal, the second Indian to become a Judge of the Punjab High Court.\n\nA cobbled lane outside the mansion gates winds through Pragpur village to the ornamental water tank called Taal.

The Chaujjar mansion, ancient temples, courtyards of the Sood clan; and attiyalas or public platforms are other places of interest in Pragpur.\n\nDay 8: Drive to Shimla\n\nAfter breakfast leave for Shimla by surface. A journey of about 6hrs. Rest of the day is to rewind at the hotel. Arrive and check-in at the hotel. Overnight in the hotel.\n\nStrung out along a 12km ridge, with steep forested hillsides falling away in all directions, the Himachal capital is a good appetite-whetter for the awe-inspiring mountain tracts of the state's interior. Shimla is one of India's most popular hill resorts, buzzing with a happy flow of Indian vacationers and full of relics of its previous life as the summer capital of British India. Traffic is banned from the central part of town, so walking is pleasant – even when huffing and puffing uphill. The long, winding main street, the Mall, runs east and west just below the spine of the hill. South of it, the maze-like alleys of the bustling bazaar cascade steeply down to traffic-infested Cart Rd.\n\nDay 9 : A day in Shimla\n\nBreakfast at the hotel. Proceed for a walking tour of Shimla town, we start from The Mall, Gaiety Theatre, Scandal Point, Gorton Castle and Oberoi Cecil. Proceed for Viceregal Lodge by car. Return to the hotel and relax. Overnight in the hotel.\n\nTraffic-free for a good part of its winding 7km length, the Mall is the heartbeat of Shimla life, strung with hotels, shops, eateries, colonial-era buildings in assorted states of repair, and people everywhere. It runs up from Chotta Shimla, southeast of the centre, to Scandal Point, the junction that is the official centre of town, then continues west to the Viceregal Lodge.\n\nThe top landmarks you'll pass in an east–west walk along the Mall include the handsome half-timbered Clarkes Hotel, dating from the 1890s; the Gaiety Theatre, opened in 1877 and still going strong; and the Town Hall, almost beside Scandal Point, dating from 1910 and oddly reminiscent of the mansion in Hammer Horror films.\n\nWest of Scandal Point, just above the Mall, a pretty 1883 quasi-Tudor folly houses the post office. A further 200m west, again just above the Mall, is the wonderfully whimsical Bantony, a turreted red-brick mansion from 1880 that was once home to the Maharajah of Sirmaur. Together with its quaint red-brick cottage next door, Bantony is now sadly the epitome of Shimla picturesque decay.\n\nAnother 500m west, the turreted Railway Board Building, built in 1897 with fire-resistant cast iron and steel, now houses government and police offices. Just past here is the austere grey-stone Gorton Castle from 1904, formerly the colonial government secretariat and now the Himachal Pradesh Accountant-General's Office (visitors can walk round the outside but can't go inside). A further 1km brings you to Shimla's most famous luxury hotel, the Oberoi Cecil, founded in 1902 and radically refurbished in the 1990s but with its western end still preserving classic century-old half-timbering. From the Oberoi, it's 1.4km on westward to the most splendiferous and important of all Shimla's Raj-era edifices, the Viceregal Lodge.\n\nViceregal Lodge was official summer residence of the British viceroys was completed in 1888 and the entire Indian subcontinent was ruled from here for just over half of every year (usually early April to late October) from then till WWII. Henry Irwin's grand, grey sandstone creation resembles a cross between Harry Potter's Hogwarts and a Scottish baronial castle. Half-hour building tours visit three rooms with interesting photo exhibits (one was the billiards room) and the three-storey entrance hall lined in Burmese teak.\n\nDay 10 : Drive to Kalka, train to Delhi\n\nBreakfast at the hotel. Today we are going to enjoy the toy train ride for an hour and then we leave for Kalka by car. Arrive in Kalka board the express train for Delhi 1745 hrs and arriving at 2155 hrs. Arrive and transfer to the hotel. Overnight in the hotel.\n\nOf the various attractions in Shimla, the most sought after and mesmerizing is the Kalka Shimla toy train. There are few experiences in India that can come close to the beautiful toy train ride on the Kalka-Shimla route. It takes you through lush green mountains with scenic, misty views. Started in 1903, the toy train route has now been listed as a UNESCO site.\n\nDay 11 : Delhi departure\n\nFull day excursion to Old and New Delhi, exploring the medieval and pre-modern faces of the historic capital of India personified by the Jama Masjid and Chandni Chowk (closed on Sundays). Take a food walk in the Chandni Chowk market. In Afternoon visit Humayun’s Tomb and Qutub Minar. After visits transfer to the International Airport for flight back home.\n\nJama Masjid is a mosque in Old Delhi, constructed in 1650–56 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān, a noted patron of Islamic architecture whose most famous work is the Taj Mahal, in Agra.\n\nThis vibrant market came to existence when the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, shifted his capital from Agra to Shahjahanabad, now Old Delhi, in the mid 17th century. While Chandni Chowk or the moonlit square no longer bears the magnificence of the bygone era, its importance in the annals of Delhi will never be lost.\n\nThe food walk in Old Delhi is a great experience to and the best way to see and taste Old Delhi. The dishes one can savor in Old Delhi Food Walk are large, thick and juicy jalebis, glistening with ghee; Aloo chaat crisp fried potato cutlets dunked in a melange of chutneys and smattered with onions and spices ; varieties of stuffed paranthas potato, onion, cottage cheese, cauliflower, radish, dry fruits and many more….\n\nHumanyun’s Tomb was built in 1565 A.D. nine years after the death of Humayun, by his senior widow Bega Begam. Inside the walled enclosure the most notable features are the garden squares (chaharbagh) with pathways water channels, centrally located well proportional mausoleum topped by double dome."
