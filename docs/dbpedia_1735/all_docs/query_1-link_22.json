        "text": "A city in Himachal Pradesh, India\n\nThis article is about the town in India. For other uses, see Solan (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Himachal Pradesh, India\n\nSolan is a city in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and the district headquarters of Solan district.[1] It is located 45.5 kilometres (28 mi) south of the state capital, Shimla. Solan has an average elevation of 1,550 metres (5,090 ft).[2] The city is situated between Chandigarh (joint capital of Punjab and Haryana) and Shimla (state capital) on the Kalka-Shimla National Highway-5. The narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla railway passes through Solan. Located on the Punjab-Himachal Border, Solan is nestled in the Shivalik hills of the Himalayas.\n\nSolan was originally the capital of the princely state, Baghat.[3] A defining feature of Solan, is its ancient temples[4] and monasteries.[5] The Shoolini Mata Temple and Jatoli Shiv Temple are popular attractions for tourists. One of the most famous monasteries in this region is the Yundung Monastery. The hill-town is named after the Hindu goddess Shoolini Devi ~ who is a manifestation of Goddess Durga in Her warrior aspect. Shoolini, when translated literally, means 'the goddess wielding the spear'. Every year in June, a fair venerating the Goddess is held, featuring a 3-day melā at the central Thodo ground.\n\nSolan is known for the production of quality mushrooms,[6] as a result of the vast mushroom farming in the area, as well as the Directorate of Mushroom Research (DMR) situated at Chambaghat. Due to this fact, Solan is also known as the \"Mushroom City of India\". Solan is also called the \"City of Red Gold\", due to the bulk production of tomatoes in the area.[2]\n\nThe city has one of the oldest breweries in the country, and also has a 300-year-old fort located at the top of a hill.\n\nThe history of Solan goes back to the era of Pandavas. According to local folklore, Pandavas lived here during their exile.[7] In 1815, British won the Baghat state (now Solan) from the Gurkhas. Gurkha fort, or Arki Fort, is still standing tall on a mountain near to the city of Solan, and it is one of the historic tourist attractions of Solan.[8] The town has been a capital of the princely Baghat State. The word Baghat is derived from Bau, or Bahu, meaning \"many\", and Ghat, meaning \"pass\". Initially, the state headquarters of the Baghat State was located at Bhoch in the Bhuchali pargana. The headquarters of the state was shifted to Solan, after the construction of cantonment in the city; the railway was set up in 1902.[9] The evolution of Solan city can be understood in the following order or sequence:\n\nEstablishment of a cantonment area at Solan by Brits.\n\nEstablishing a brewery in Solan in 1855, due to availability of excellent quality mineral water.\n\nShifting of the headquarters of Baghat State from Bhoch to Solan.\n\nStart of Kalka-Shimla rail line in 1902.\n\nStart of transportation activity on Kalka-Solan-Shimla road.\n\nThe urban local body, i.e. Municipal Council Solan, came into existence in 1950.\n\nSolan became an independent district on 1 September 1972, and the town of Solan became the district headquarters.[9]\n\nSolan's history is intertwined with that of the erstwhile princely state of Baghat. The Solan cantonment is still the best, and the most well planned part of the area, hence buildings are made in a planned manner.
