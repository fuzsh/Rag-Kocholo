        "text": "Beautiful Beaches\n\nIf you’re looking for a beach retreat, whether it’s for a week or just a day, then India doesn’t disappoint. The sandy beaches of Goa always spring to mind, with Arambol, Vagator, and Palolem being the most popular. If you’re looking for something a little quieter, try Gokarna just a few hours away, where you can see pilgrims taking a dip at Gokarna Beach, find inner peace at the Om symbol-shaped Om beach, and great waves for surfing at Main Beach.\n\nThe lovely Kashid Beach in Maharashtra is around three hours from Mumbai has fantastic waves for surfing and you’ll have the place pretty much to yourself on a weekday.\n\nIf you’re visiting Kerala, Mararikulam (or Marari) Beach is a lovely quiet stretch of sand lined by coconut trees without any commercial activities and is a favourite Keralan beach amongst locals.\n\nTo really get away from it all, head to the beautiful Andaman Islands, an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal with palm-lined, white-sand beaches, coral reefs, mangroves and tropical rainforests."
