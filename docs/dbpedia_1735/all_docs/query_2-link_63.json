        "text": "Doug Loynes The fall and rise of Matera, one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited settlements, is a great Italian renaissance story. But although the past lives on via its frescoed, rock-cut churches and cave dwellings, this city is looking to the future. MATERA P.44 Neil Davey Herefordshire feels like the UK’s best-kept secret. The scenery is beautiful, the history often fascinating and the culinary scene local, seasonal and wonderfully collaborative — exactly the kind of thing to which we should all aspire. HEREFORDSHIRE P.50 Monisha Rajesh As Indian Railways marks its 170th anniversary, I decided to return to India, 10 years after my first book, Around India in 80 Trains, was published. I was keen to rediscover the charm, energy and magic of travelling along the country’s classic routes.…\n\nWe woke up before dawn to drive down to the west bank of the Nile in Luxor. It was calm at this hour, setting up on the shores of this magnificent river. Another ride followed, during which we tried to catch glimpses of sugarcane fields, date palms and hot air balloons rising into the sky through our minivan’s tiny windows. Finally, we reached this sprawling launchpad, where dozens of massive hot air balloons were starting to take shape. Minutes after I took this shot, we were gliding over Luxor and the stunning Valley of the Kings, where New Kingdom pharaohs lay resting in their tombs. YULIA DENISYUK • PHOTOGRAPHER yulia-denisyuk.com @insearchofperfect…\n\nTel Aviv stretches along Israel’s beautiful Mediterranean coastline, from Jaffa in the south to the cliff-lined beaches of the north. It’s a diverse city, lively and full of culinary pleasures stemming from the wave of migrants that began arriving in the 1920s — Jewish immigrants from European countries including Germany, Romania, Hungary and more, as well as arrivals from places such as Morocco, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. As a young boy, I used to love exploring restaurants and cafes specialising in traditional food you couldn’t find anywhere else. It’s fascinating walking through the small streets of Kerem Ha Teimani, for instance — the Yemenite quarter — with its intoxicating scents and tiny, simple restaurants serving authentic Jewish-Yemenite food. I’d find comfort in hearty dishes cooked overnight on kerosene flames, such…\n\nTravel flight-free No-fly travel in Europe is easier than ever. A raft of new train routes and services includes the May 2023 launch of a link between London and Berlin, with just one change required at Brussels, where the Eurostar makes way for the new European Sleeper. eurostar.com europeansleeper.eu Flight-free holiday specialist Byway has partnered with group tour operator Intrepid Travel.

Byway’s multidestination journeys by train, bus or boat include the Scottish Highlands via sleeper train and the Hogwarts Express (three days from £555 per person), which follows the route (London to Fort William, Scotland) made famous by…\n\nTHE TRAVELOGUE & THE TOUR Alice Morrison has been nominated for the 2023 Edward Stanford Travel Book of the Year for Walking with Nomads (Simon & Schuster, £9.99). You can follow her on a similar if truncated version of that seven-and-a-half month epic journey where she crossed Morocco and the Sahara on foot, on a tour organised by Intrepid Travel. Take in some of Alice’s favourite walks and camping spots in the High Atlas on a week’s trip that offers three days of hiking, a sunset camel ride across the Agafay desert and the chance to meet the women of Tizi Oussem, the mountain village Alice calls home. Summer 2023 (exact dates tbc), £800 per person. intrepidtravel.com THE BIRD BOOK & THE CAMPAIGN Faced with a British bird population in…\n\nFifty-one stations after leaving jampacked Osaka — the landscape growing ever quieter, the platforms ever emptier — you step out of your train at Gokurakubashi, ‘The Bridge of Heaven’. You get into a clanky cable car and, minutes later, you face a silent country road, with little on it but signs warning of bears. A slow country bus takes you into a settlement consisting of 117 temples, their grey roofs like the prows of ships about to sail off into the mist. You’ve entered the single most powerful spot I’ve discovered in 35 years living in Japan. Koyasan, or Mount Koya as we might call it, is the centre of the esoteric Buddhist order known as Shingon, a practice so mystical that none of its details, it’s said, were written…\n\nWELLNESS London’s best spas inspired by overseas wellness traditions Try out Turkish hammams, Russian banyas and Greco-Roman baths EXPERT TIPS Where to travel in March Five reasons to get away this month, from India’s Holi Festival to Ireland’s TradFest CRUISE Bear necessities in Svalbard The Arctic creatures of northern Norway are best reached by polar voyage IN PICTURES Going vegan in Tel Aviv The White City takes plant-based dining to another level, building on Israel’s culinary reputation WINTER SPORTS What’s new in Verbier From a Scandi-chic hotel makeover to a member’s club, here’s the latest from the Swiss resort REVIEW Our 12 most-read features of 2022 Readers sought out lesser-known destinations and environmentally friendly ways to travel SEARCH FOR NATGEOTRAVELUK FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TWITTER…\n\nIt’s a bright September morning in Herefordshire and breakfast is being served at The Riverside at Aymestrey, a charming 17th-century pub with rooms. My toast and house-made pumpkin seed granola were pre-ordered the previous evening — part of the pub’s efforts to reduce waste — but there’s something on the table I wasn’t expecting. “That’s golden marrow marmalade,” explains general manager George Parkes. “We had a lot of golden marrows, so we had to find something to do with them.” In 2022, The Riverside at Aymestrey won the Best Sustainable Pub prize at the Great British Pub Awards, and it’s easy to see why. Everything on the table is ultra-local and highly seasonal, mostly originating from The Riverside’s two-acre smallholding on the hill above the pub. This enviable low-food-mile philosophy…\n\nOur train has barely begun to brake into the station when I hear the familiar sound of sandalled feet slapping on the ground followed by the excited cries of vendors passing baskets. Those who got off are now ambling towards the exit while the rest of us gather at the train’s doorways for a tussle with the passengers attempting to board. It’s 13 years since I first encountered the quirks of Indian railways and it feels like coming home. I’ve arrived in Jodhpur from Jaipur to embark upon a desert train adventure to Jaisalmer in the west of Rajasthan, not far from the Pakistan border, but I’ve got some time to kill before my connection, so set off to explore the blue-walled city. On my last visit to Jodhpur, I…\n\nYESVANTPUR-KARWAR EXPRESS Bangalore to Mangalore This train traces a glorious stretch of railway through the heart of Karnataka state, connecting the city of Bangalore with the port hub of Mangalore. Known as the Green Route, it’s an explosion of forests, rope-like creepers, clusters of wonky palms and skinny waterfalls with rainbows forming in their spray. Over 10 hours, the train slips into around 60 tunnels and thumps across more than 100 bridges over coffee plantations, thrashing rivers and valleys thick with growth. Top tip: Book seats in the Vistadome carriage, which enables passengers to experience 360-degree views from rotating seats. CHENNAI EGMORE-RAMESWARAM E XPRESS Chennai to Rameswaram Departing Chennai at 7:15pm, this train travels down the southeast edge of India to Pamban Island, home of the Ramanathaswamy Temple, one of…\n\nSo many services cover the same route, how do I pick one? Shatabdi express trains are fully air-conditioned, high-speed services that do roundtrips between major cities, returning to their origin station on the same day. They have chair cars only, with no sleeper berths. Rajdhani express trains are long-distance services that connect New Delhi to major cities. They make fewer stops and include meals in the ticket price. Be mindful that tickets go on sale 120 days in advance, so popular services get snapped up. For a list of services, visit trainspread.com/india What should I pack for an overnight journey? Passengers travelling in air-conditioned first class (1AC), two tier (2AC) or three tier (3AC) receive a paper bag containing a pillow, sheet, blanket and flannel. However, it’s still worth bringing…\n\nSeattle is known as a city that very much dances to its own beat musically. Not only has it birthed one of the world’s greatest guitar players in Jimi Hendrix while also encouraging the underground sounds of Nirvana, Soundgarden and Alice In Chains to bubble up into the mainstream. Post-grunge, in an exciting new musical landscape, an increasingly diverse selection of performers are stepping up to the mic. And with its music festivals back in full force, it’s an ideal time to plan a trip to Washington state’s largest and most harmonious metropolis. 1 MAKE SWEET MUSIC AT THE MUSEUM OF POP CULTURE Seattle is no stranger to boundary-pushing architecture, but the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP), a shimmering Frank Gehrydesigned landmark, is almost worth visiting solely to admire its…\n\nA decade ago, Lima was unburdened with expectation. It’s long been one of South America’s larger cities — with a population of over 11 million, it’s currently only just lagging behind the likes of Bogotá and Rio de Janeiro. But for years it had neither the international reputation nor connections to make it worth much of a detour for anyone beyond dusty backpackers making their way up or down the mighty Pan-American Highway, and travellers transferring on to Machu Pichu or the Peruvian Amazon. But over the past 10 years, the Peruvian capital has steadily been establishing itself as South America’s premier culinary destination. Visitors today will find a city almost overburdened with fine dining, extraordinary produce and plenty of surprises besides. The founding of Central, the pioneering flagship restaurant…\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced that Snowdon and Snowdonia would officially be called by their Welsh names — Yr Wyddfa and Eryri — following a petition to showcase the importance of the Welsh language YR WYDDFA IS PART OF THE THREE PEAKS CHALLENGE, WHICH SEES HIKERS CLIMB THE HIGHEST PEAKS IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND WALES WITHIN 24 HOURS Birdwatching is a popular activity when hiking the peak.

Genoa and Portofino are among its most renowned coastal destinations, but slip just a few miles inland to find a quieter side to the region, where rural villages reveal Liguria’s true soul. Less than an hour’s drive east of Genoa, on a narrow road wriggling through the Apennines, Uscio is a vision of historic houses in fresco painter’s pastels, spread across forested hillsides. This Ligurian town receives just a trickle of tourists every year, so you’ll largely find yourself alone enjoying sights such as Pieve di Sant’Ambrogio, a Romanesque church in faded redbrick, with its origins in the sixth and…\n\nTell us about this image. It was August, and I was working on a cover story assignment. This image was taken on St Angelo Bridge, looking west over the Tiber to the Vatican and Janiculum Hill. I’d crossed this pedestrian bridge — one of the capital’s oldest and most beautiful — various times, and I guessed the sun would nicely backlight St Peter’s dome just before sunset. I wanted to add a touch of serendipity; I hoped to find a relaxed mood, with locals and visitors enjoying the vista under the late afternoon’s glowing light. How did you achieve the shot? The image was shot on a Fujifilm X-Pro2, the camera I normally use. I like how discreet it feels and unobtrusive it appears — Ifind it useful in street…\n\nISSUE 110, MARCH 2023 Big countries offer epic train journeys. From Australia to Canada, South Africa to the US, traversing a nation by rail can offer insight into a destination rarely achieved by any other means of transport. But with one of the largest rail networks in the world, India is perhaps where this unique perspective really comes into its own. With 40,000 miles of track, 25 million passengers a day and more than 13,000 trains, this vast country is best explored from the seat of a carriage. The first Indian passenger train departed Bombay on 16 April 1853. Our cover story this issue, nearly 170 years later, shines a light on what’s gone on to become one of the world’s most celebrated networks, taking in mountains, cities, jungles, rivers,…\n\nThere’s much to celebrate on Flying Scotsman’s 100th birthday. Built in 1923, the world-famous steam train has broken all kinds of records in its history, becoming the first locomotive to officially hit 100mph and circumnavigate the globe. In 1989, it also ran the longest nonstop service by a steam locomotive, clocking 422 miles while touring Australia — arecord that still stands today. Following an overhaul, it’s now ready to embark on a celebratory programme of events up and down the country. Festivities kick off with a pair of exhibitions at its current home, York’s National Railway Museum. From 10 February, Flying Scotsman: 100 Years, 100 Voices will explore the train’s significance with stories from its makers, staff and passengers, while the original watercolour sketches from the new children’s book Flying…\n\n1 NOTRE-DAME DE LA TREILLE CATHEDRAL Start at this national monument to get your bearings. The cathedral itself is magnificent, but it’s not the focus here: around the perimeter of the square, a row of Flemish houses hints at Lille’s past. Although Flanders only controlled Northern France for about a century, its cultural influence is still strong in this border region — the love of beer being a classic case in point. cathedralelille.fr 2 LA CAPSULE Considered one of the best beer bars in France, this trendy space is ideal as an introduction to beers from Lille and the surrounding region. Just around the corner from the cathedral, it offers 28 beers on tap and more than 100 by the bottle. The most popular is the Belgian blonde, but for…\n\nSet on the country’s west coast, at the gateway of its namesake archipelago, Sweden’s second city is equal parts down to earth and chic, with towering shipping cranes and whitewashed fishing boats sitting alongside design shops and lustworthy restaurants. The city is also extremely planet conscious, topping the Global Destination Sustainability Index for the past six years, and dynamic, too, with cool new areas emerging next to cobbled, historic pockets. Get to grips with its history at the Museum of Gothenburg, set inside the 18th-century former headquarters of the Swedish East India Company. There’s also the Museum of World Culture, near the popular Liseberg amusement park. Free to enter, it’s a trot through global maritime, social and political landscapes, and it celebrates Sweden’s burgeoning multiculturalism. goteborgsstadsmuseum.se varldskulturmuseet.se Over in the…\n\n1 PÁRAMO SOCORRO WOMEN’S SHIRT, £65 Designed for tropical weather, this shirt is made of fabric that distributes sweat to aid in cooling and drying. It’s UV-proof with an SPF exceeding 50, while its close weave and secured cuffs and collar protect against biting insects. Smart details include a hidden inside compartment and a chest pocket for OS maps. paramo-clothing.com 2 ARIAT SKYLINE SUMMIT WATERPROOF BOOT, £170 These best-selling leather boots feature a shock-absorbing midsole for uneven paths, plus an ergonomic and gel-cushioned heel that will make for surer footing. Light but sturdy, they have a good degree of ankle protection, a moisture-wicking footbed and mesh inner-lining ensuring excellent breathability. ariat.com 3 LEKI CRESSIDA FX CARBON TREKKING POLES, £189.99 Poles will increase your stability and endurance, test the ground before…\n\nWhere did your appetite for adventure come from? I think it’s a mix of being outside a lot when I was younger and wanting to travel. I’ve always loved the water and the sea. I’m just fascinated by it. I’d swum competitively in a pool and then, when I was 14, I took up open water swimming. What was the best part of your record-breaking swim? Seeing so much of the UK from the sea. I’d never been to Cornwall — and I’ve still not actually been on land in Cornwall! But to be able to see bits of the UK from a perspective that very few other people have experienced was a highlight. Oh, and having dolphins swim alongside me. You spent up to 12 hours a day in…\n\nSwaggeringly self-assured, New York City is an indomitable force. This mega metropolis, immortalised on the silver screen countless times, has bags of assets and knows how to flaunt them: steel skyscrapers squeezed together like blades of grass, sandy beaches, bold Broadway plays, good grub, grand galleries, and paths crisscrossing Central Park’s vast meadows, hills and gardens. Stretching along the Hudson and East Rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, New York is split into five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. It’s North America’s largest city by a long shot, and remains a nonstop raucous ride with late nights, bright neon lights and cool cosmopolitan clout. According to NYC & Company, visitor numbers to the US’s most popular city have nearly tripled since 1991. The pandemic affected this trajectory,…\n\nBest for jailbirds £ £ WILMINA You can’t overlook the passion that’s been poured into Wilmina. This 44-room boutique beauty fills a former Charlottenburg prison and courthouse, cramming it with character. Barred windows and bare-brick walls may seem austere, but it’s a look softened by leafy gardens, white-on-white colour tones and pendant lamp installations. The cell block houses most of the rooms, where original doors (with guards’ peepholes sealed over) are balanced by designer Danish furniture and framed, pressed wildflowers, making them feel restful, cosy and bright. A games room, generous breakfast and all-day complimentary drinks (with afternoon cake) add the kind of comforts that make this a place from which you won’t want to break out. ROOMS: From €140 (£122), B&B. wilmina.com Best for style junkies £ £ £…\n\nGetting to know Delhi India’s capital city, built and rebuilt upon the rubble of Sufi shrines and Mughal tombs, is home to bazaars, swathes of jungle and parks with bougainvillea-draped tombs. From Haveli Dharampura — aboutique hotel in a restored 19th-century mansion in the heart of Old Delhi — it’s a 10-minute walk towards the sound of hissing karahis in the food haven of Matia Mahal Bazar, where mutton burra kebabs and silk-soft roti are served at Karim’s. Lodhi Gardens is a popular spot for dawn joggers and evening amblers, while Sunder Nursery feels like a national park due to the 40 varieties of butterfly that flit between flaming gulmohar trees, ponds and flowerbeds. For a nightmarket experience, head to Dilli Haat, an openair bazaar where crafts and snacks from…\n\nHIMALAYAN QUEEN FROM KALKA TO SHIMLA With a couple of jerks, the toy train rolls out of Kalka station to hoots and claps and begins its ascent to Shimla. Opened in 1903, the line was built to enable British colonisers to set up a summer residence in the cooler climes of the Himalayan foothills and, despite frequent closures, it’s survived as one of the most charming train rides, with 102 tunnels and more than 800 bridges on the five-hour climb. Winding its way through forests of maple and sharp-smelling pine, the train teeters along cliff edges where the odd sandal can often be spotted — lost by those hitching a ride. There are stops for tea and thick triangles of hot bread pakora, consumed while milling around making friends and…\n\nThe first bear, or rather its ghostly heat signature, appears almost as soon as we start looking through the thermal binoculars. It’s before dawn, and we’ve pulled up to the crash barrier on a high and lonely road above the Xunceras river valley. Without the expensive piece of kit, nature guide José García Gonzalez tells me, we’d never be able to see these creatures in the dark. But there one is, visible through the high-tech lenses: a brown bear showing white against the black of the steep mountain slope opposite us. As the sun comes up, we no longer need electronic wizardry to make out the scene before us: a primeval forest of oak and chestnut, broken by grass and scree, rising towards peaks cloaked by low cloud. From somewhere…\n\nBeaten by the passage of nomadic Bedouin tribes over millennia, Jordan’s walking paths are now being discovered by a new generation of travellers. In 2015, its network of hiking routes was ambitiously redesigned into the 420- mile Jordan Trail, which winds through the entire length of the country from its bucolic north to the drier, starker south. Arguably its most scenic leg, the hike between the small settlement of Dana and the rock-hewn city of Petra covers varied terrain, cutting across Jordan’s full spectrum of landscapes. Among them is the otherworldly Araba Desert, a scorching expanse of wadis (dry river valleys) engraved with petroglyphs. Along the itinerary, nights are often spent camping under the stars. It’s this proximity with nature that’s made the four-day route a favourite among adventurous hikers,…\n\nSet in the most westerly part of Florida’s Panhandle, a stone’s throw from the Alabama border, Pensacola is a modern city with an old soul. It may be the sugar-white beaches that first draw you in, but beyond these coastal fringes lie distinct urban neighbourhoods, eclectic arts spaces and heritage sites that bring a 460-year history to life. And thanks to Pensacola’s location on the Gulf of Mexico, restaurants serve up seafood-heavy menus showcasing everything from local grouper to shrimp. Pensacola’s sandy shores are where families can paddle in clear Gulf waters and anglers fish from the pier. At Pensacola Beach, the 8.5-mile Footprints in the Sand Eco-Trail features displays on sea turtles, local birdlife and dolphins, while the family-friendly boardwalk is lined with a colourful variety of restaurants and…\n\nPresented as a way to resolve the tension around flying and environmental responsibility about a decade ago, carbon offsetting was an easy, if often misunderstood, conscience salve. Having since fallen out of the spotlight, its recent resurgence in popularity comes despite greenwashing criticism. With aviation emitting around a billion tons of CO2 per year, more than most countries, can this voluntary consumer measure really make a difference? How does it work? The principle of carbon offsetting is simple: compensate for the amount of carbon you’ve put into the atmosphere by flying. In the aviation industry, carbon offsetting happens through compliance at a business level, and individual voluntary action, where consumers can ‘neutralise’ their emissions by investing in carbon reduction projects with a surcharge that can start at as little as…\n\n1 TAKEIN THE VIEW FROM THE CITY’S MOST FAMED LANDMARK Rising 1,815ft above the city’s downtown core, the CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. From the building’s glass-floored observation deck and SkyPod platform, visitors can take in hair-raising views of the city, and beyond to Niagara Falls and New York State. 2 FERRYOVER TO CENTRE ISLAND ON LAKE ONTARIO This crescent-shaped island in Lake Ontario is a nature lover’s paradise, with formal gardens, walking trails, a huge beach and protected areas full of migrating birds. Firsttime visitors should check out the 200-yearold Gibraltar Point lighthouse (the oldest in Canada), while families can hit the attractions at the Centreville Amusement Park. 3 DAYTRIP TO NIAGARA FALLS Less than an hour and a half’s drive from downtown…\n\nI met Felipe, a South American gaucho horseman, and his wife Laura on a tour of Argentinean Patagonia. The couple live in extreme isolation near Lake Traful, on a private reserve bordering Nahuel Huapi, the oldest national park in the country, and Lanín National Park, with its snow-covered stratovolcano. Their family estancia (cattle ranch) has been converted into sleeping quarters where I spent the night after a day on the saddle. At dinner, Felipe and Laura cooked roast lamb and kept my glass topped up with Malbec. I had a great evening reflecting on my day, spent wondering around emerald lakes, knife-edge mountain passes and grassy pampa plains. DAVID DE VLEESCHAUWER • PHOTOGRAPHER @remoteexperiences…\n\nCelebratory exhibitions First up, the MO Museum is paying tribute to Ričardas Gavelis’ Vilnius Poker, widely seen as one of the most important works of Lithuanian literature. Published towards the end of the Soviet era in 1989, it’s become a symbol of creative freedom, and a namesake exhibition opens in April. Meanwhile, May will see the inauguration of Vilnius 200 Years Ago at the Lithuanian National Museum’s New Arsenal. It will depict a model of the city as it was in the 19th century, with visual projections and augmented reality portraying how it’s changed over time. The space will pitch camp at the foot of the 157ft Mount Gediminas; before leaving, head up the hill for some of the best views over the UNESCO-listed Old Town. mo.lt/en lnm.lt/en Turning the…\n\nM.Ou.Co Discreetly tucked away on a quiet road in the trendy Bonfim neighbourhood, a brisk 20-minute walk east of the centre of Porto, M.Ou.Co is one of the city’s newest hotels, having opened its doors in 2021. Bonfim is perhaps the obvious place to convert a former warehouse into a casually cool boutique hotel; it was recently dubbed one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world by Time Out, with the creative crowds drawn to the area’s elegant townhouses and charming, oldschool spots to eat and drink. M.Ou.Co ticks all the necessary design boxes for the resurgent neighbourhood. Concrete, dark wood, glass and natural light feature highly and, alongside vintage, mid-century furniture, there’s a distinctly analogue feel to the place. The music area has more than 600 vinyl records to…\n\nWhy go Sandwiched between Manchester and Liverpool to the south, and the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales to the north, the Forest of Bowland is as every bit as enchanting as its famous neighbours. An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, it’s more diverse than its name suggests, with the woodlands of the Lune Valley ascending to the wild moorlands of the Bowland Fells. Discover Bowland’s new Eco Escapes itineraries connect these landscapes with local pubs and B&Bs by public transport, making it easier than ever to explore the region in a sustainable way. discoverbowland.uk What to do JRR Tolkien wrote much of The Lord of the Rings during visits to Stonyhurst College, and the six-mile Tolkien Trail is a gentle walking route to familiarise yourself with the landscape. To go…\n\nTHE DESTINATION One of the most rewarding and atmospheric ways to explore France is by boat, and there’s no shortage of waterways to explore: the River Lot, meandering beneath soaring bluffs in the leafy southwest; the Camargue, home to flamingos and wild horses; and the rivers and canals of Brittany, with Celtic traditions and distinctive local cuisine at every turn. But the Canal du Midi is perhaps the most iconic of all — the UNESCO-listed channel flows for 150 miles between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and makes for an unforgettable journey by water, passing ancient citadels, sun-dappled towpaths and rolling vineyards. THE PRIZE Courtesy of Le Boat — the number-one provider of self-drive boating holidays for over 50 years — the winner and up to five guests will enjoy…\n\nIreland’s rugged west coast takes centre stage in The Banshees of Inisherin, a tragicomedy set in 1923 during the final months of the Irish Civil War. Created by director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), the film examines the crumbling relationship between humble dairy farmer Pádraic (Colin Farrell) and his best friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson). They live quiet lives on the fictional island of Inisherin, where the only hint of the world beyond are the distant explosions from the war on the mainland. Filming centred on two weather-worn islands, whose extraordinarily tall cliffs and isolated bays have attracted tourists to Ireland’s west coast for generations. Achill Island Located on the western fringes of County Mayo, the island’s desolate landscape offers drama at every turn. At sea level,…\n\nIt’s a remarkable rags-to-riches story. Carved into a remote ravine in the Basilicata countryside, in the instep of Italy’s boot, Matera was once dubbed ‘the shame of Italy’ for its caves that housed the city’s poor and exploited rural workers; by the 1970s, it’d become a ghost town, the first time the settlement had been uninhabited in 10,000 years. Yet a decade later, its evocative beauty lay the foundations for an extraordinary revival, thanks to a group of enterprising local creatives (many descended from the original inhabitants) who spotted its potential. These days, the city’s churches jostle for space with boutique hotels, galleries and restaurants that have themselves been repurposed from former cave dwellings. Matera now has UNESCO status, was Europe’s 2019 Capital of Culture and has even drawn the…\n\nFrom the moment India’s first passenger train steamed along the 21-mile track from Bori Bunder to Thane in 1853, the country’s railways have fired the interest of writers, artists, photographers and filmmakers, providing the backdrop to many a movie from The Darjeeling Express to Slumdog Millionaire. Spanning more than 40,000 miles, its tracks run from the southernmost tip of the country in Tamil Nadu to Gujarat in the west, Jammu and Kashmir in the north and Assam in the east, rippling around villages, encircling mountains and curling along coastlines, taking passengers deep into the pockets, cracks and crevices no airline could ever reach. Nicknamed ‘the lifeline of a nation’, the railways are the arteries that keep India’s heart beating, employing 1.3 million people and carrying more than 25 million passengers…\n\nWith the same level of joy I felt on my wedding day, I’m eyeing the saucer of chicken curry coming out of the kitchen and rolling up my sleeves in anticipation. It’s chicken masala fry, to be precise, a leg portion pooling in rich gravy flecked with coriander with strips of raw onion, lemon quarters and green chillies on the side. I’ve been coming to Olympia Coffee House in Mumbai’s Colaba neighbourhood for more than 10 years, although the beloved spot has been around since 1918. In truth, jet-lagged and in search of breakfast, I came for its kheema pav curry, but it had sold out by 10am. But my dish is an excellent consolation. Wiping up the remnants with buttery roti, my fingers turmeric-tinged and stinging, I pay a…\n\nMaharajas’ Express Featuring mirrored mosaic ceilings, raw-silk upholstery and goldrimmed dinner plates piled with saffron-scented biryani, the Maharajas’ Express is the most opulent service, with four categories of cabin and suite — and a premium price tag to match. Its Indian Panorama itinerary includes a six-night round trip departing Delhi for Jaipur, a game drive through Ranthambore National Park, and the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri. There’s a dawn visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra, followed by a day spent exploring the quiet town of Orccha and the erotic temples of Khajuraho before a final day in Varanasi to glide along the Ganges by boat. the-maharajas.com Top tip: Pack a warm fleece and scarf for the early-morning game drive. Deccan Odyssey A red carpet rolls out like a…\n\nSwivelling their hips to the furious beat of pahu drums, dancers whirl like dust devils across a sandy stage erected on the beach. An audience watches, mesmerised, as the music grows louder and movements become faster, until the scene becomes a blur of floaty, floral fabrics, swishing, grassy fronds and cascading, velveteen petals. Slowing the tempo, a new troupe emerges to the gentle strumming of a ukulele, sweeping their arms upwards in a motion mimicking the peaks and troughs of Pacific Ocean waves. Wearing garlands of jasmine draped around their necks and delicate frangipani flowers tucked behind their ears, these women on the atoll of Rangiroa are the very picture of Polynesian paradise, an image that’s attracted countless curious explorers and travellers to these distant shores. Launched in September 2022,…\n\nThe door is large and wooden. Oak, most likely. It forms a beautiful entrance to a beautiful building. I wonder if the decorative gold embellishments that cover it are original or new. I also wonder whether I’ll ever get the thing to actually open. It’s mid-morning in Bankya, a district to the west of Sofia. Straddling the border between the Bulgarian capital and the forested hills of Lyulin Mountain, the area has long been synonymous with health and wellbeing. Its star attraction is Central Mineral Bath Bankya, a storied and stately baroque bathhouse that’s been the focus of a major redevelopment project over the past few years. It’s this building that I’m here to visit and, kindly, I’ve been given the honour of unlocking it. Unfortunately, the door won’t budge.…\n\nTHE EXPERTS Where would you recommend for a hiking holiday in southern Europe this spring? As the second largest of the Greek Islands, peaceful Evia rewards with superb archaeological finds, lovely vineyards and glittering beaches where you might not see another soul. There’s a real charm to following the old mule tracks, known as ‘kalderimia’, along the coast and through mountains, gorges and historic villages. My favourite walking spots include Dimosari Gorge for its waterfalls, rocky ravines and lush green slopes, and the Dragon Houses for the 20-plus megalithic structures mysteriously buried deep in the mountains. Equally standout is Karystos, where you can climb the 4,586fthigh Mount Ochi — arocky stunner towering over the Aegean Sea. As for accommodation, HF Holidays’ comfortable partner hotels offer Greek food, live music and…\n\nThe stone circles of Avebury are bathed in golden light early on a crisp autumn morning. The Neolithic monuments, which are rooted in and around a sleepy Wiltshire village, 17 miles north of Stonehenge, were once a major stop on a now largely lost network of roads established by drovers and traders. Several thousand years later, a small band of travellers with rather different intentions are gathered beside the stones. We wear tastefully muted shades of Lycra and merino wool as we make the final checks on our bikes before a modern adventure with historic foundations. I’m here to ride a wave that’s swept the cycling industry in the past few years. It’s called ‘gravel cycling’. And, like cargo trousers and bucket hats, it has the strange quality of being…\n\nGet in touch inbox@natgeotraveller.co.uk Have a query about subscriptions?
