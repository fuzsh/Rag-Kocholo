The station is located adjacent to the main road and we request the transport department to start buses from Taradevi for the convenience of the commuters,\" MK Seth, President of Shimla Hotel and Tourism Stakeholders Association told PTI.\n\nHe pointed out that the railway authorities should have acted proactively and made permanent arrangements as its nearly a year since the bridge had collapse. \"We wonder what will happen during the upcoming monsoon season,\" he said, criticising authorities.\n\nAlso read: Himachal tourism takes a big step to attract more travellers: Check details here\n\nMoreover, Seth highlighted that there was no communication from railway authorities regarding the timeline for resuming train services to Shimla.\n\nLast year, heavy rains in July and August caused widespread disruption in train services, with significant damage to the rail tracks at multiple locations. A landslide in August resulted in the collapse of a 50-meter bridge near Summer Hill.\n\nHowever, services resumed in October after repairs were completed on the affected stretches. The 96 km UNESCO world heritage Shimla-Kalka Railway track, renowned for its challenging hilly terrain and 102 tunnels (following the collapse of one tunnel four decades ago), continues to face operational challenges due to natural hazards like heavy rains and landslides.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shimla Meteorological department said on June 22 that heat wave conditions have abated in the state following light to moderate rains and thunderstorms at several places in the past 24 hours. The department has predicted relief from heat for three to four days.
