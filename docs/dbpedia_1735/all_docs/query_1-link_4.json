        "meta_description": "The Kalka-Shimla Railway Track is an UNESCO declared world heritage site. Built in the late 1890s, this historic attraction dates back to the British era. This narrow gauge railway was constructed by the Delhi-Ambala-Kalka Railway Company in order to make travel and transport to this area more convenient. Operational since 1906, this track was a connection between Shimla and Kalka and it was laid along a mountainous route thus offering beautiful views of the mountains and the valleys. It is also considered an engineering marvel as it has been built at an altitude of 2169 meters (7116 feet) and it passes through 103 tunnels across 806 bridges during the entire journey. A tourist service is operational on this track.",
