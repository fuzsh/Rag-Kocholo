        "text": "Last Updated: May 24, 2019 Nidhi Singh\n\nObviously, I don’t need to brag about the importance of Dhabas (Roadside Eating Joints) stationed on almost all highways in India. Whether it is about feeding our gurgling stomachs or reflecting the authentic taste of any region or the hospitality with which the food is served, these roadside eateries certainly know the way to win one’s heart. It is amazing to see how some of these Dhabas, which were once merely stopovers for travellers, have become destinations unto themselves. It can be safely said that Dhabas are serious business. Ok, enough of talking! Let me also get back to my business and present to you a list of Dhabas that you must stop by if you are travelling on Indian highways:\n\nRecommended Tours\n\n7 Nights / 8 Days Mumbai-Jaipur-Agra Culinary Tour\n\n8 Nights / 9 Days Delhi - Jaipur-Agra Culinary Tour\n\n6 Nights / 7 Days Kochi-Thekkady-Kumarakom Culinary Tour\n\n17 Nights / 18 Days India - Land of Maharajas Tour\n\nMr Sanjay Dhaba, Srinagar-Leh Highway\n\nStop by this lone Dhaba situated 50kms from Leh on the Srinagar-Leh Highway. With nothing more than a roughly maintained concrete shack, this place is still a paradise for travellers. You will see many foreign travellers basking and having black tea here. However, as an Indian you will love to savour the freshly prepared aaloo parantha and gobhi ki sabzi along with a refreshing cup of tea.\n\nGiani Da Dhaba, Kalka-Shimla Road, NH 22\n\nMore of a restaurant and less of a Dhaba… call it by any name; Giani is certainly a great food haunt in Dharampur, situated on Shimla-Kalka Road NH 22. A well maintain eatery with nice ambiance and great food, Giani is nothing short of treat on the way to awe-inspiring Shimla!\n\nSukhdev Dhaba, G.T Road, Murthal NH 1\n\nYou just cannot ignore this classy place situated on GT Road, Murthal NH 1. Once a small shack catering to the appetite of truck drivers who ply on these roads, Sukhdev Dhaba or the Amrik Sukhdev Dhaba is now a serious affair. A tall, well-maintained AC building is what stands instead of the thatched-hay shack, serving sumptuous Indian as well as Chinese cuisine to the starving travellers who make sure to stop nowhere else but here. Amritsari Kulcha and aloo paratha with tongue slurping white butter is the delight of Sukhdev… The taste and the feel are just unforgettable!\n\nKarnal Haveli, G.T Road, Karnal, NH 1\n\nNo, I am not disoriented on my topic of this blog but when it comes to highway and food, you ought to include Karnal Haveli in the list.

Situated on the GT Road, Karnal NH 1, this place serves authentic Punjabi cuisine. The rustic influence on the exterior and interior décor of the restaurant adds to the fame of the place and an amusement park for kids is yet another asset here.\n\nGrand Lassi Shop, Zirakpur-Patiala Road, NH 21\n\nYou are going to love this place!
