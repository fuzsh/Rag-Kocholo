Item No. 0376583

Softdisc is a disposable, single use menstrual disc that can be worn safely for up to 12 hours. Softdisc has a soft, flexible rim made out of a medical-grade polymer that is made to fit inside the vaginal fornix, covering the cervix, and preventing menstrual fluid from entering the vaginal canal. The soft center catch collects rather than absorbs your menstrual fluid and holds the equivalent of 5 tampons. Because menstrual discs do not plug the vaginal canal (like a menstrual cup or tampon), you will not experience dryness or irritation while wearing.
