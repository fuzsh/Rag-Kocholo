One was played in life. The other was lived in play. Naturally these worlds collided, and so did the Two Johns, It happened one afternoon in April 2000 in the bowels of downtown Dallas. The occasion was a $100,000 prize tournament of the computer game Quake III Arena. Hosted by the Cyberathlete Professional League, an organization that hoped to become the NFL at the medium, the gathering was BYOC– bring your own computer. Hundreds of machines were networked together in the basement of the Hyatt hotel for seventy-two hours of nonstop action. On a large video screen that displayed the games being played, rockets soared across digital arenas. Cigar-chomping space marines, busty dominatrix warriors, maniacal bloodstained clowns, hunted each other with rocket launchers and plasma guns. The object was simple: The player with the most kills wins. The gamers at the event were as hard-core as they came. More than one thousand had road-tripped from as far as Florida and even Finland with their monitors, keyboards, and mice. They competed until they passed out at their computers or crawled under their tables to sleep on pizza box pillows. A proud couple carried a newborn baby in homemade Quake pajamas. Two jocks paraded with their hair freshly shaved into the shape of Quake’s clawlike logo; their girlfriends made their way around the convention hall brandishing razors for anyone else who wanted the ultimate in devotional trims. Such passion was hardly uncommon in Dallas, the capital of ultra-violent games like Quake and Doom. Paintball-like contests played from a first-person point of view, the games have pioneered a genre known as first-person 3\n\nshooters. They are among the bestselling franchises in this $10.8 billion industry and a sizable reason why Americans spend more money on video games than on movie tickets. They have driven the evolution of computing, pushing the edge of 3-D graphics and forging a standard for online play and community. They have created enough sociopolitical heat to get banned in some countries and, in the United States, blamed for inciting a killing spree by two fans at Columbine High School in 1999. As a result, they have spawned their own unique outlaw community, a high-stakes, high-tech mecca for skilled and driven young gamers. In this world, no gamers were more skilled and driven than the co-creators of Doom and Quake, John Carmack and John Romero, or, as they were known, the Two Johns. For a new generation, Carmack and Romero personified an American dream: they were self-made individuals who had transformed their personal passions into a big business, a new art form, and a cultural phenomenon. Their story made them the unlikeliest of antiheroes, esteemed by both Fortune 500 executives and computer hackers alike, and heralded as the Lennon and McCartney of video games (though they probably preferred being compared to Metallica). The Two Johns had escaped the broken homes of their youth to make some of the most influential games in history, until the very games they made tore them apart. Now in minutes, years after they had split, they were coming back together before their fans. Carmack and Romero had each agreed to speak to their minions about their latest projects: Carmack’s Quake III Arena, which he’d programmed at the company they cofounded, id Software, and Romero’s Daikatana, the longawaited epic he had been developing at his new and competing start-up, Ion Storm. The games embodied the polar differences that had once made the Two Johns such a dynamic duo and now made them seemingly inseparable rivals. Their relationship was a study of human alchemy. The twenty-nine-year-old Carmack was a monkish and philanthropic programmer who built high-powered rockets in his spare time (and made Bill Gates’s short list of geniuses); his game and life aspired to the elegant discipline of computer code. The thirty-two-year-old Romero was a brash designer whose bad-boy image made him the industry’s rock star; he would risk everything, including his reputation, to realize his wildest visions. As Carmack put it shortly after their breakup: “Romero wants an empire, I just want to create good programs.” When the hour of the Two Johns’ arrival at the hotel Finally approached, the gamers turned their attention from the skirmish on screen to the real-life one between the ex-partners. Out in the parking lot, Carmack and Romero pulled up one shortly after the other in the Ferraris they had bought together at the height of their collaboration. Carmack walked quickly past the crowd; he had short, sandy blond hair, square glasses, and a T-shirt of a walking 4\n\nhairball with two big eyes and legs. Romero sauntered in with his girlfriend, the sharpshooting gamer and Playboy model Stevie Case; he wore tight black jeans and matching shirt, and his infamous dark mane hung down near his waist. As they passed each other in the hall, the Two Johns nodded obligatorily, then continued to their posts. It was time for this game to begin.\n\n5\n\nONE\n\nThe Rock Star\n\nE\n\nleven-year-old John Romero jumped onto his dirt bike, heading for trouble again. A scrawny kid with thick glasses, he pedaled past the modest homes of Rocklin, California, to the Roundtable Pizza Parlor. He knew he wasn’t supposed to be going there this summer afternoon in 1979, but he couldn’t help himself. That was where the games were. Specifically, what was there was Asteroids, or, as Romero put it, “the coolest game planet Earth has ever seen!” There was nothing like the feeling he got tapping the control buttons as the rocks hurled toward his triangular ship and the Jaws-style theme music blipped in suspense, dum dum dum dum dum dum; Romero mimicked these video game sounds the way other kids did celebrities. Fun like this was worth risking everything: the crush of the meteors, the theft of the paper route money, the wrath of his stepfather. Because no matter what Romero suffered, he could always escape back into the games. At the moment, what he expected to suffer was a legendary whipping. His stepfather, John Schuneman–a former drill sergeant–had commanded Romero to steer clear of arcades. Arcades bred games. Games bred delinquents. Delinquency bred failure in school and in life. As his stepfather was fond of reminding him, his mother had enough problems trying to provide for Romero and his, younger brother, Ralph, since her first husband left the family five years earlier. His stepfather was under stress of his own with a top-secret government job retrieving black boxes of classified information from downed U.S. spy planes across the world. “Hey, little man,” he had said just a few days before, “consider yourself warned.” 6\n\nRomero did heed the warning–sort of. He usually played games at Timothy’s, a little pizza joint in town; this time he and his friends headed into a less traveled spot, the Roundtable. He still had his initials, AJR for his full name, Alfonso John Romero, next to the high score here, just like he did on all the Asteroids machines in town. He didn’t have only the number-one score, he owned the entire top ten. “Watch this,” Romero told his friends, as he slipped in the quarter and started to play. The action didn’t last long. As he was about to complete a round, he felt a heavy palm grip his shoulder. “What the fuck, dude?” he said, assuming one of his friends was trying to spoil his game. Then his face smashed into the machine. Romero’s stepfather dragged him past his friends to his pickup truck, throwing the dirt bike in the back. Romero had done a poor job of hiding his bike, and his stepfather had seen it while driving home from work. “You really screwed up this time, little man,” his stepfather said. He led Romero into the house, where Romero’s mother and his visiting grandmother stood in the kitchen. “Johnny was at the arcade again,” his stepfather said. “You know what that’s like? That’s like telling your mother ‘Fuck you.’” He beat Romero until the boy had a fat lip and a black eye. Romero was grounded for two weeks. The next day he snuck back to the arcade. Romero was born resilient, his mother Ginny said, a four-and-one-halfpound baby delivered on October 28, 1967, six weeks premature. His parents, married only a few months before, had been living long in hard times. Ginny, good-humored and easygoing, met Alfonso Antonio Romero when they were teenagers in Tucson, Arizona. Alfonso, a first-generation Mexican American, was a maintenance man at an air force base, spending his days fixing air conditioners and heating systems. After Alfonso and Ginny got married, they headed in a 1948 Chrysler with three hundred dollars to Colorado, hoping their interracial relationship would thrive in more tolerant surroundings. Though the situation improved there, the couple returned to Tucson after Romero was born so his dad could take a job in the copper mines. The work was hard, the effect sour. Alfonso would frequently come home drunk it he came home at all. There was soon a second child, Ralph. John Romero savored the good times: the barbecues, the horsing around. Once his dad stumbled in at 10:00 P.M. and woke him. “Come on,” he slurred, “we’re going camping.” They drove into the hills of saguaro cacti to sleep under the stars. One afternoon his father left to pick up groceries. Romero wouldn’t see him again for two years. Within that time his mother remarried. John Schuneman, fourteen years her senior, tried to befriend him. One afternoon he found the six-yearold boy sketching a Lamborghini sports car at the kitchen table. The drawing 7\n\nwas so good that his stepfather assumed it had been traced. As a test, he put a Hot Wheels toy car on the table and watched as Romero drew. This sketch too was perfect. Schuneman asked Johnny what he wanted to be when he grew up. The boy said, “A rich bachelor.” For a while, this relationship flourished. Recognizing Romero’s love of arcade games, his stepfather would drive him to local competitions–all of which Romero won. Romero was so good at Pac-Man that he could maneuver the round yellow character through a maze of fruit and dots with his eyes shut. But soon his stepfather noticed that Romero’s hobby was taking a more obsessive turn. It started one summer day in 1979, when Romero’s brother, Ralph, and a friend came rushing through the front door. They had just biked up to Sierra College, they told him, and made a discovery. “There are games up there!” they said. “Games that you don’t have to pay for!” Games that some sympathetic students let them play. Games on these strange big computers. Romero grabbed his bike and raced with them to the college’s computer lab. There was no problem for them to hang out at the lab. This was not uncommon at the time. The computer underground did not discriminate by age; a geek was a geek was a geek. And since the students often held the keys to the labs, there weren’t professors to tell the kids to scram. Romero had never seen anything like what he found inside. Cold air gushed from the airconditioning vents as students milled around computer terminals. Everyone was playing a game that consisted only of words on the terminal screen: “You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building towards a gully. In the distance there is a gleaming white tower.” This was Colossal Cave Adventure, the hottest thing going. Romero knew why: it was like a computer-game version of Dungeons and Dragons. D&D, as it was commonly known, was a pen-and-paper role-playing game that cast players in a Lord of the Rings–like adventure of imagination. Many adults lazily dismissed it as geekish escapism. But to understand a boy like Romero, an avid D&D player, was to understand the game. Created in 1972 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, two friends in their early twenties, Dungeons and Dragons was an underground phenomenon, particularly on college campuses, thanks to word of mouth and controversy. It achieved urban legend status when a student named James Dallas Egbert III disappeared in the steam tunnels underneath Michigan State University while reportedly reenacting the game; a Tom Hanks movie called Mazes and Monsters was loosely based on the event. D&D would grow into an international cottage industry, accounting for $25 million in annual sales from novels, games, T-shirts, and rule books. The appeal was primal. “In Dungeons and Dragons,” Gygax said, “the average person gets a call to glory and becomes a hero and undergoes change. 8\n\nIn the real world, children, especially, have no power; they must answer to everyone, they don’t direct their own lives, but in this game, they become super powerful and affect everything.” In D&D, there was no winning in the traditional sense. It was more akin to interactive fiction. The participants consisted of at least two or three players and a Dungeon Master, the person who would invent and direct the adventures. All they needed was the D&D rule book, some special polyhedral dice, and a pencil and paper. To begin, players chose and developed characters they would become in the game, from dwarves to elves, gnomes to humans. Gathered around a table, they would listen as the Dungeon Master cracked open the D&D rule book–which contained descriptions of monsters, magic, and characters–and fabricated a scene: down by a river, perhaps, a castle shrouded in mist, the distant growl of a beast. Which way shall you go? If the players chose to pursue the screams, the Dungeon Master would select just what ogre or chimera they would face. His roll of the die determined how they fared; no matter how wild the imaginings, a random burst of data ruled one’s fate. It was not surprising that computer programmers liked the game or that one of the first games they created, Colossal Cave Adventure, was inspired by D&D. The object of Colossal Cave was to fight battles while trying to retrieve treasures within a magical cave. By typing in a direction, say “north” or “south,” or a command, “hit” or “attack,” Romero could explore what felt like a novel in which he was the protagonist. As he chose his actions, he’d go deeper into the woods until the walls of the lab seemed to become trees, the air-conditioning flow a river. It was another world. Imbued with his imagination, it was real. Even more impressively, it was an alternate reality that he could create. Since the seventies, the electronic gaming industry had been dominated by arcade machines like Asteroids, and home consoles like the Atari 2600. Writing software for these platforms required expensive development systems and corporate backing. But computer games were different. They were accessible. They came with their own tools, their own portals–a way inside. And the people who had the keys were not authoritarian monsters, they were dudes. Romero was young, but he was a dude in the making, he figured. The Wizard of this Oz could be him. Every Saturday at 7:30 A.M., Romero would bike to the college, where the students–charmed by his gumption–showed him how to program on refrigerator-size Hewlett-Packard mainframe computers. Developed in the fifties, these were the early giants of the computer industry, monolithic machines that were programmed by inserting series of hole-punched cards that fed the code. IBM, which produced both the computers and the punch card ma9\n\nchines, dominated the market, with sales reaching over $7 billion in the 1960s. By the seventies, mainframes and their smaller cousins, the minicomputers, had infiltrated corporations, government offices, and universities. But they were not yet in homes. For this reason, budding computer enthusiasts like Romero trolled university computer labs, where they could have hands-on access to the machines. Late at night, after the professors went home, students gathered to explore, play, and hack. The computer felt like a revolutionary tool: a means of self-empowerment and fantasy fulfillment. Programmers skipped classes, dates, baths. And as soon as they had the knowledge, they made games. The first one came in 1968 from the most unlikely of places: a U.S. government nuclear research lab. The head of the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s instrumentation division, Willy Higinbotham, was planning a public relations tour of the facility for some concerned local farmers, and needed something to win them over. So, with the help of his colleagues, he programmed a rudimentary tennis simulation using a computer and a small, round oscilloscope screen. The game, which he called “Tennis tor 2,” consisted merely of a white dot ball hopping back and forth over a small white line. It thrilled the crowds. Then it was dismantled and put away. Three years later, in 1961, Steve “Slug” Russell and a group of other students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created Spacewar on the first minicomputer, the PDP-1. In this game, two players shot up each other’s rocket ships while drifting around a black hole. Ten years later, a programmer and amateur cave explorer in Boston, Will Crowther, created textbased spelunking simulation. When a hacker at Stanford named Don Woods saw the game, he contacted Crowther to see if it was okay for him to modify the game to include more fantasy elements. The result was Colossal Cave Adventure. This gave rise to the text-adventure craze, as students and hackers in computer labs across the country began playing and modifying games of their own–often based on Dungeons and Dragons or Star Trek. Romero was growing up in the eighties as a fourth-generation game hacker: the first having been the students who worked on the minicomputers in the fifties and sixties at MIT; the second, the ones who picked up the ball in Silicon Valley and at Stanford University in the seventies; the third being the dawning game companies of the early eighties. To belong, Romero just had to learn the language of the priests, the game developers: a programming language called HP-BASIC. He was a swift and persistent student, cornering anyone who could answer his increasingly complex questions. His parents were less than impressed by his new passion. At issue were Romero’s grades, which had plummeted from A’s and B’s to C’s and D’s. He was bright but too easily distracted, they thought, too consumed by games and computers. Despite this being the golden age of video games–with ar10\n\ncade games bringing in $6 billion a year and even home systems earning $1 billion–his stepfather did not believe game development to be a proper vocation. “You’ll never make any money making games,” he often said. “You need to make something people really need, like business applications.” As the fights with his stepfather escalated, so did Romero’s imagination. He began exorcising the backwash of emotional and physical violence through his illustrations. For years he had been raised on comics–the B-movie horror at E.C. Comics, the scatological satire of MAD, the heroic adventures of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. By age eleven, he churned out his own. In one, a dog named Chewy was invited to play ball with his owner. With a strong throw, the owner hurled the ball into Chewy’s eye, causing the dog’s head to split open and spill out green brains. “The End,” Romero scrawled at the bottom, adding the epitaph “Poor Ol’ Chewy.” At school, Romero turned in a homemade comic book called Weird for an art class assignment. In one section he described and illustrated “10 Different Ways to Torture Someone,” including “Poke a needle all over the victim’s body and in a few days … watch him turn into a giant scab” and “Burn the victim’s feet while victim is strapped in a chair.” Another, titled “How to Drive the Babysitter Mad!,” illustrated suggestions including “Get out a wry sharp dagger and pretend that you stabbed yourself” and “Stick electric cord into your ears and pretend that you are a radio.” The teacher returned the assignment with a note that read, “This was awfully gross. I don’t think it needs to be that way.” Romero got a B+ for his artistic efforts. But he saved his hardest work for his code. Within weeks of his first trip to Sierra College, he had programmed his first computer game: a text adventure. Because the mainframes couldn’t save data, the programming had to be punched on waxy paper cards; each card represented a line of code–a typical game would take thousands. After every day at the school, Romero would wrap the stack of cards in bungee cord around the back of his bike and pedal home. When he’d return to the lab the next time, he’d have to feed the cards into the computer again to get the game to run. One day on the way home from the college, Romero’s bike hit a bump in the road. Two hundred cards went flying into the air and scattered across the wet ground. Romero decided it was time to move on. He soon found his next love: the Apple II computer. Apple had become the darling of the indie hacker set ever since the machine was introduced at a 1976 meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club, a ragtag group of California techies. As the first accessible home computers, Apples were ideally suited tor making and playing games. This was thanks in no small part to the roots of the company’s cofounders, Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak–or, as they became known, the Two Steves. Jobs, a college dropout with a passion for Buddhism and philosophy, took his first job at a start-up video game company called Atari in the mid11\n\nseventies. Atari was legendary because its founder, Nolan Bushnell, had produced the 1972 arcade hit, Pong, a tennislike game that challenged players to maneuver white strip paddles on either side of the screen while hitting a dot back and forth. Jobs would share the confidence and brashness of his boss, who had hacked Spacewar to create his first arcade game, Computer Space. But Jobs had larger plans to realize with his childhood friend Wozniak, a.k.a. Woz, a math whiz who could spend hours playing a video game. Woz was equal parts programming genius and mischievous prankster, known around the San Francisco Bay Area for running his own dial-a-joke phone number. In computers, Woz found the perfect place to combine his humor and his math skills, creating a game that flashed the message “Oh Shit” on the screen when the player lost a round. Jobs recruited Woz to design Breakout, a new game tor Atari. This alchemy of Jobs’s entrepreneurial vision and Woz’s programming ingenuity gave birth to their company, Apple. Created in 1976, the first Apple computer was essentially a prototype for the Homebrew crowd, priced devilishly at $666.66. But the Apple II, made the following year, was mass market, with a keyboard, BASIC compatibility, and, best of all, color graphics. There was no hard drive, but it came with two game paddles. It was made for games. Romero had first seen the stylish beige Apple II computers up at Sierra College. While a mainframes graphics were capable of, at best, spitting out white blocks and lines, the Apple II’s monitor burst with color and highresolution dots. Romero had spent the rest ol the day running around the lab trying to find out all he could about this magical new box. Whenever he was at the school, Romero played the increasingly diverse lineup of Apple II games. Many were rip-offs of arcade hits like Asteroids and Space Invaders. Others showed signs of true innovation. For instance, Ultima. Richard Garriott, a.k.a. Lord British, the son of an astronaut in Texas, spoke in Middle English and created the massively successful graphical role-playing series of Ultima games. As in Dungeons and Dragons, players chose to be wizards or elves, fighting dragons and building characters. The graphics were crude, with landscapes represented by blocky colored squares; a green block, ostensibly, a tree; a brown one, a mountain. Players never saw their smudgy stick figure characters attacking monsters, they would just walk up to a dragon blip and wait for a text explanation ol the results. But gamers overlooked the crudeness for what the games implied: a novelistic and participatory experience, a world. Ultima also showed off the latent entrepreneurship of this new breed of hackers. Garriott came to fame in the early eighties through his own initiative. Like many other Apple II programmers, he would hand-distribute his games on floppy disks sealed in clear plastic Ziploc bags to local computer stores. Ken and Roberta Williams, a young married couple in Northern California, also pioneered the Ziploc distribution method, turning their homemade graphi12\n\ncal role-playing games into a $10 million-a-year company, Sierra On-Line–a haven of hippie digerati with hot tub parties to boot. Silas Warner, a six-foot, nine-inch, 320-pound legend, cofounded his own company, Muse Software, and put out another of Romero’s favorite games, the darkly suspenseful Castle Wolfenstein, in which players ran their stick figure characters through a series of plain mazes while battling Nazis and, ultimately, Hitler himself. Romero spent so much time on the games that his stepfather decided it was best for the family to have a computer at home, where they could better keep an eye on him. The day the Apple II arrived, he found his wife standing at the door. “Promise you won’t get angry,” she pleaded. An empty Apple II box sat in the living room. “Johnny put it all together already,” she said cautiously. A few ill-sounding beeps could be heard. Enraged, Schuneman stomped down the hall and flung open the door, expecting to encounter a savage pile of plastic and wires. Instead he found Romero at the functioning machine, typing. His stepfather stood for a minute quietly, then went in and let the boy show him some games. For Christmas that year, 1982, Romero had two requests: a book called Apple Graphics Arcade Tutorial and another called Assembly Lines, which explained assembly language, a faster and more cryptic code. These books became his lifeblood when his stepfather took the family on a job reassignment to the Royal Air Force base in Alconbury, a small town in central England. There Romero wrote games that could exploit his refined assembly language skills. He drew his own packages and created his own artwork. Selling his games at school, Romero became known for his skills. Romero’s step father knew something was up when an officer working on a classified Russian dogfight simulation asked him if his stepson was interested in a part-time job. The next day an officer led the boy into an icy room filled with large computers. A black drape blocked Romero’s view of the classified maps, documents, and machines. He was told they needed help translating a program from a mainframe to a minicomputer. On the monitor he saw a crudely drawn flight simulation. “No problem,” he said. “I know everything about games.” Romero was ready for the big time. The computer was now a cultural icon. Time magazine even put a computer on its cover in place of its usual Man of the Year as 1982’s “Machine of the Year.” Games for the computer were becoming all the more enticing as video games–made for systems or “consoles” that hooked up to television sets–collapsed with a resounding crash. A surplus of games and hardware had led to $536 million in losses for Atari alone in 1983. Meanwhile, home computers were gaining speed. Commodore’s VIC-20 and 64 computers helped it surpass Apple with $1 billion in sales. And these computers needed games. For a kid working with an Apple II, there were two ways to get published in the nascent industry. The big publishers, like Sierra and Electronic Arts, 13\n\nRomero found, were fairly inaccessible. More within his reach were the enthusiast magazines, which, to save costs, printed games as code on their pages. To play, the reader would have to type the program laboriously into a computer. While in England, Romero spent every spare moment in front of the Apple, working on games to send away for publication. The resulting slip in his grades angered his stepfather, reviving old battles and inspiring, for Romero, new comics he called “Melvin.” The action was always the same: Melvin, a boy, would do something his father, a bald guy with sunglasses, like his step dad, had told him not to do–then suffer the creatively grisly consequences. In one strip, Melvin agrees to do the dishes but instead disappears to play computer games. After discovering this, his dad waits until Melvin is sleeping, runs into his room screaming, “You little fucker,” then punches his face into a bloody, eye-popping pulp. Romero wasn’t the only one who found a release in the violent comics. Kids at school would sneak him ideas for how Melvin should meet his doom. Romero drew them all, exaggerating every opportunity for scatological gore. He was much admired. The attention changed him. He was listening to heavy metal–Judas Priest, Metallica, Motley Crue. He dated a half dozen girls. The one he liked best soon became his girlfriend, a popular, intelligent, and outgoing daughter of a respected officer. She had him buy button-down shirts, wear nice jeans and contacts. After years of being beaten down by his father and his stepfather, Romero was finally getting recognition. At sixteen, Romero was just as eager to have success with his games. After eight months of rejections, the good news came on March 5, 1984, from an Apple magazine called InCider. An editor, weary from a recent trip to Mardi Gras, wrote that the magazine had decided to publish the code for Romero’s Scout Search, a low-resolution maze game in which the player– represented by a single dot–had to gather all his scouts–more dots–before being attacked by a grizzly bear–another dot. It didn’t look great, but it was fun to play. Romero would be paid $100. And the magazine might be interested in publishing some of the other games Romero had sent in. “I’ll get around to them as soon as my hangover clears up,” the editor wrote. Romero put all his energy into making more games, for which he did all the programming and art. He could program one game in a half hour. He arrived at a naming convention: every game title was a two-word alliteration, like Alien Attack or Cavern Crusader. He grew increasingly brash. “When I win this month’s [programming] contest,” he wrote to one magazine, “(I will win; my program’s awesome!), instead of a $600 prize, could I just take the $600? The same goes for the annual prize of $1000 (which I’ll get also).” He signed this letter, like all of them, “John Romero, Ace Programmer.” And he won the cash. 14\n\nThe success inspired him to get back in touch with his biological dad, who was living in Utah. In a letter he wrote on makeshift letterhead for his company, Capitol Ideas Software, he was eager to show how far he’d come, telling about all the contests and publications. “I’ve been learning computers for 4½ years now,” Romero wrote. “My programming has just undergone another revolution.” This time he signed his letter “John Romero, Ace Programmer, Contest Winner, Future Rich Person.” He was already on his way, he could feel it. But to make it big, Future Rich Person big, he had to leave England and get back to America. Romero got his wish in 1986, when he returned with his family to California. He signed up for classes at Sierra College, which he started just before finishing his senior year of high school. His publishing rolled; almost everything he churned out found its way into a computer magazine. His games made magazine covers. And, during a shift at Burger King, he fell in love. Kelly Mitchell came into the restaurant one day and caught Romero’s eye from behind the cash register. The two began dating. Kelly was the daughter of an upper-middle-class Mormon family. Best ol all, she lived in a cool house high on a hill in town. Though Romero had dated other girls, no one was as fun and compatible as Kelly–even if she didn’t care about games. For nineteen-year-old Romero, it seemed like the chance to start the family he’d never really had. He proposed, and the two were married in 1987. He decided it was time to go for his dream job. He had published ten games. He was about to graduate from high school. He was taking on a family. He needed a gig. The opportunity came on September 16, 1987, with a gathering for Apple computer enthusiasts, called the Applefest. Romero had read about it in a computer magazine and knew that everyone would be there: the big game publishers, Origin and Sierra, as well as the magazines that were keeping him gainfully published, Uptime, Nibble, and InCider. He arrived at the convention center in San Francisco as hackers and gamers lugged monitors, printouts, and disks inside. A table overflowed with Nibble magazines that featured one of Romero’s games on the cover. In the booth for Uptime, a computer magazine published on floppy disk, another of his games played on the monitors. Oh yeah, Romero thought. I’m gonna do well here. At the Uptime booth, Romero met Jay Wilbur, the editor who had been buying up his work. Jay, a strapping twenty-seven-year-old former bartender at T.G.I Friday’s, looked like a kid pumped up with air and peppered with facial hair. Jay had a soft spot for Romero: an irreverent but reliable programmer who understood the magic formula of a great game–easy to learn, difficult to master. Jay offered him a job. With typical bravado, Romero told him he’d have think about it.\n\n15\n\nBuzzed on his Uptime meeting, Romero headed right for the Origin booth, where a banner read, “Ultima V: Coming October 31!” Oh my God, Romero thought, the next Ultima! He sat down in front of a machine and popped in his disk. “What do you think you’re doing?” a woman in marketing from Origin asked him. “You’re taking our game out of our machine! You’re not supposed to do that!” Romero tapped a few keys. “Look at this!” he said. On the screen appeared a maze chase. He had written it using a complicated program that doubled the resolution of the graphics, making it look, essentially, twice as colorful and pristine. So-called double-res graphics were considered the high art of programming, and here was this skinny kid showing off some game that looked even better than the Ultima version on screen. The woman had only one question: “Are you looking for a job?” Two months later, in November 1987, Romero was driving across the country, heading for his first day of work at Origin’s office in New Hampshire. Eager but broke, he wrote hot checks to pay for toll booth fees. He was driving with Kelly, his pregnant wife–their first baby was due in February. Kelly was less than thrilled about heading off into the snow, but Romero had convinced her in his charming and enthusiastic way. His life as an Ace Programmer and Rich Person was on its way, he promised. The promise fell through. Despite his immediate success at Origin, Romero took the gamble of joining his boss, who was leaving to start a new company. It was a bad bet. The start-up couldn’t drum up the requisite business. Before long Romero–now twenty-one years old with a wife, a baby boy, Michael, and another child on the way–was out of a job. The strain was beginning to wear on Kelly. Romero’s hyperbole seemed to have no payoff, and she had returned to California to have her second baby near her parents. Romero had to call and tell her that there was nothing: no job, no apartment. He was sleeping on a friend’s couch. But Romero wasn’t going to lie down and die. He had a dream to pursue, a family he loved. He could be the dad he’d never had himself, the kind of dad who would not just support his kids’ games but play them. Romero phoned Jay Wilbur to see about a job at Uptime. Jay told him he was leaving Uptime to join his competitor Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana. Maybe, Jay suggested, Romero could get a job there too. Romero didn’t hesitate. Sure, he’d go to Shreveport. The weather was there. The games were there. And so, he hoped, were the most hard-core of gamers.\n\n16\n\nTWO\n\nThe Rocket Scientist\n\nJ\n\nohn Carmack was a late talker. His parents were concerned until one day in 1971, when, the fifteen-month-old boy waddled into the living room holding a sponge and uttered not just a single word but a complete sentence: “Here’s your loofah, Daddy.” It was as if he didn’t want to mince words until he had something sensible to say. “Inga,” the boy’s father, Stan, told his wife, “perhaps we might have something a bit extraordinary on our hands.” The Carmacks were already a self-taught family. John Carmack’s paternal grandfather and namesake was an electrician with a second-grade education, taught to read and write by his wife, a homemaker who had reached only the eighth grade. They raised their boy Stan in the poorest part of eastern Kentucky; Stan studied hard enough to earn a scholarship to a university, where he excelled at engineering, math, and eventually broadcast journalism and became the family’s first college graduate. His wife was the daughter of a chemist and a physiotherapist. She inherited the interest in science, pursuing both nuclear medicine and a doctorate in microbiology. Inga and Stan, attractive college sweethearts, would passtheir love of learning on to their first son. Born on August 20, 1970, John D. Carmack II–or Jondi as he was nicknamed–grew amid the fruits of his parents’ hard work. After his father became the nightly news anchor for one of the big three television stations in Kansas City, Missouri, the family moved to an upper-class suburb, where his younger brother, Peter, was born. There, Carmack went for the best educa17\n\ntion in town at a Catholic elementary school called Notre Dame. Skinny, short, with unruly blond hair and large glasses he had worn since before he was one year old, Carmack quickly distinguished himself. In second grade, only seven years old, he scored nearly perfect on every standardized test, placing himself at a ninth-grade comprehension level. He developed a unique speech impediment, adding a short, robotic humming sound to the end of his sentences, like a computer processing data: “12 times 12 equals 144 … mmm.” At home, he grew into a voracious reader like his parents, favoring fantasy novels such as Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He read comic books by the dozen, watched science fiction movies, and, most enjoyably, played Dungeons and Dragons. Carmack, more interested in creating D&D than playing, immediately gravitated to the role of Dungeon Master. He proved himself to be a unique and formidable inventor. While most Dungeon Masters relied on the rule book’s explicitly charted styles of game play, Carmack abandoned the structure to devise elaborate campaigns of his own. After school, he would disappear into his room with a stack of graph paper and chart out his game world. He was in the third grade. Despite his industriousness, there were some things Carmack couldn’t escape. When assigned to write about his top five problems in life, he listed his parents’ high expectations–twice. He found himself at particular odds with his mother, the disciplinarian of the family. In another assignment, he wrote about how one day, when he refused to do extracredit homework, his mother padlocked his comic book collection in a closet; unable to pick the lock, he removed the hinges and took off the door. Carmack began lashing out more at school–he hated the structure and dogma. Religion, he thought, was irrational. He began challenging his classmates’ beliefs after mass on Wednesdays. On at least one occasion, the other kid left the interrogation in tears. Carmack found a more productive way to exercise his analytical skills when a teacher wheeled in an Apple II. He had never worked on a computer before but took to the device as if it were an extension of his own body. It spoke the language of mathematics; it responded to his commands; and, he realized after seeing some games on the monitor, it contained worlds. Until this point Carmack had been entranced by arcade games. He wasn’t the best player around, but he loved the fast action and quick payback of Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Battlezone. Battlezone was unique in its point of view: it was first-person. Instead of looking down on the action from the side or from overhead, Carmack was in the action, looking out from inside a tank. Though the graphics were crude, made up of green geometric lines, they had the illusion of being three-dimensional. The game was so compelling that the U.S. government took notice, requesting a customized version for military training. It didn’t take long for Carmack to want to customize games of his own. With a computer, it was possible. 18\n\nWhen Carmack was in the fifth grade, his mother drove him to a local Radio Shack, where he took a course on the TRS-80 computer. He returned to school with the programming book in hand and set about teaching himself everything he needed to know. He read the passage about computers in the encyclopedia a dozen times. With his grades on the rise, he wrote a letter to his teacher explaining that “the logical thing to do would be to send me to the sixth grade,” where he could learn more. The next year Carmack was transferred to the “gifted and talented” program of the Shawnee Mission East public school, among the first in the area to have a computer lab. During and after school, Carmack found other gifted kids who shared his enthusiasm for the Apple II. They taught themselves BASIC programming. They played games. Soon enough they hacked the games. Once Carmack figured out where his character in Ultima resided in the code, he reprogrammed it to give himself extra capabilities. He relished this ability to create things out of thin air. As a programmer, he didn’t have to rely on anyone else. If his code followed the logical progression of the rules established, it would work. Everything made sense. Everything, he thought, except for his parents. When Carmack was twelve, they suddenly got divorced. Tensions between Stan and Inga over how to rear their children had become too great. The aftermath for Carmack was traumatic, Inga felt. Just as he was finding himself in school, he was pulled out and separated from his brother. They alternated years between parents, switching schools in turn. Carmack hated being separated from his father. Worse, when he was living with his mother, he had to fend for himself alone. Despite his growing interest in computers, Inga didn’t see the point of all his games. In her mind, if a boy was interested in computers, he didn’t sit around playing Ultima; instead he worked hard in school, got good grades, then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–just the recipe for a job at IBM. She loved him and only wanted what she thought was best. But Carmack didn’t want any of it. All he wanted was his own computer with which to pursue his worlds. He became increasingly obstinate. Inga took him to psychologists to see why her once compliant boy was becoming so uncontrollable and dark. Carmack found reprieve when his mother decided to move to Seattle soon alter to pursue a new relationship. His father took the teenage boys to live with him, his new wife, and her two kids. Though Stan was still making a decent living as a news anchor, the sudden doubling of family size was too great to maintain his former lifestyle. So he ventured into the nearby bluecollar neighborhood ol Raytown, where he found an old farmhouse on two acres of land within city limits. Overnight, it seemed, Carmack was in a strange house, with a strange family and going to a strange school, a junior high with no gifted program or computer’s. He’d never felt so alone. Then one day he realized he wasn’t. 19\n\nThe book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution was a revelation. Carmack had heard about hackers: In 1982 a Disney movie called Tron told the story of a video game designer, played by Jeff Bridges, who hacked himself into a video game world; in a 1983 movie called WarGames, Matthew Broderick played a young gamer who hacked into a government computer system, and nearly triggered Armageddon. But this book’s story was different–it was real. Written by Steven Levy in 1984, it explored the uncharted history and culture of the “Whiz Kids Who Changed Our World.” The book traced the rise ol renegade computer enthusiasts over twenty-five rollicking years, from the mainframe experimentalists at MIT in the fifties and sixties to the Homebrew epoch of Silicon Valley in the seventies and up through the computer game start-ups of the eighties. These were not people who fit neatly into the stereotypes of outlaws or geeks. They came from and evolved into all walks of life: Bill Gates, a Harvard dropout who would write the first BASIC programming code for the pioneering Altair personal computer and form the most powerful software company in the world; game makers like Slug Russell, Ken and Roberta Williams, Richard “Ultima” Garriott; the Two Steves–Jobs and Wozniak–who turned their passion for gaming into the Apple II. They were all hackers. “Though some in the field used the term hacker as a form of a derision,” Lew wrote in the preface, “implying that hackers were either nerdy social outcasts or ‘unprofessional’ programmers who wrote dirty, ‘nonstandard’ computer code, I found them quite different. Beneath their often unimposing exteriors, they were adventurers, visionaries, risk-takers, artists … and the ones who most clearly saw why the computer was a truly revolutionary tool.” This Hacker Ethic read like a manifesto. When Carmack finished the book one night in bed, he had one thought: I’m supposed to be in there! He was a Whiz Kid. But he was in a nowhere house, in a nowhere school, with no good computers, no hacker culture at all. He soon found others who sympathized with his anger. The kids from Raytown he liked were different from the ones he had left behind in Kansas City–edgier and more rebellious. Carmack fell into a group who shared his enthusiasm for games and computers. Together they discovered an underworld: an uncharted world on the emerging online communities of bulletin board systems, or BBSs. While an international network of computers known as the Internet had been around since the seventies, it was still largely the domain of government defense scientists and university researchers. By contrast, BBSs were computer clubhouses for the people–people just like Carmack. Bulletin board systems came about in 1978, when two hackers named Ward Christensen and Randy Seuss wrote the first software to transmit data between microcomputers over telephone lines. The result was that people could “call” up each other’s computers and swap information. In the eighties the systems quickly spawned what were essentially the first online 20\n\ncommunities, places where people with the will and skills could trade software and “talk” by posting text messages in forums. Anyone with a powerful enough computer system and a setup of phone lines and modems could start a BBS. They spread across the world, starting in dorm rooms, apartment buildings, computer labs. Systems such as the Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, a.k.a. the WELL, in San Francisco and Software Creations in Massachusetts became hotbeds for hackers, Deadheads, and gamers. Carmack didn’t go on BBSs only for games. Here, he could research the most thrilling and illicit strains of hacker culture. He learned about phone phreaking: a means of hijacking free long-distance telephone service. He learned about MUDs: multiuser dungeons, text-based role-playing games that allowed players to act out D&D-type characters in a kind of real-time masquerade adventure. And he learned about bombs. For Carmack, bombs were less about cheap thrills than about chemical engineering–a neat way to play scientist and, for good measure, make things go boom. Before long he and his friends were mixing the recipes they found online. They cut off match heads and mixed them with ammonium nitrate, made smoke bombs from potassium nitrate and sugar. Using ingredients from their high school science class, they brewed thermite, a malleable and powerful explosive. After school, they’d blow up concrete blocks under a bridge. One day they decided to use explosives for a more practical purpose: getting themselves computers. Late one night Carmack and his friends snuck up to a nearby school where they knew there were Apple II machines. Carmack had read about how a thermite paste could be used to melt through glass, but he needed some kind of adhesive material, like Vaseline. He mixed the concoction and applied it to the window, dissolving the glass so they could pop out holes to crawl through. A fat friend, however, had more than a little trouble squeezing inside; he reached through the hole instead and opened the window to let himself in. Doing so, he triggered the silent alarm. The cops came in no time. The fourteen-year-old Carmack was sent for psychiatric evaluation to help determine his sentence. He came into the room with a sizable chip on his shoulder. The interview didn’t go well. Carmack was later told the contents of his evaluation: “Boy behaves like a walking brain with legs … no empathy for other human beings.” At one point the man twiddled his pencil and asked Carmack, “If you hadn’t been caught, do you think you would have done something like this again?” “If I hadn’t been caught,” Carmack replied honestly, “yes, I probably would have done that again.” Later he ran into the psychiatrist, who told him, “You know, it’s not very smart to tell someone you’re going to go do a crime again.”\n\n21\n\n“I said, ‘if I hadn’t been caught,’ goddamn it!” Carmack replied. He was sentenced to one year in a small juvenile detention home in town. Most of the kids were in for drugs. Carmack was in for an Apple II. If life felt structured and unyielding when Carmack lived with his mother, it was nothing compared with the life he found in the juvenile home. Everything took place during its allotted time: meals, showers, recreation, sleep. For every chore completed, he would receive a point toward good behavior. Each morning he was herded into a van with the other kids and carted off to his old school for classes. The van would pick him up at the end of the day and return him to the home. Carmack emerged hardened, cynical, and burning to hack. His parents agreed to get him an Apple II (though they didn’t know he used the money to buy a hot one from a kid he had met in the juvenile home). He found he most liked programming the graphics, inventing something in a binary code that came to life on screen. It gave him a kind of feedback and immediate gratification that other kinds of programming lacked. Carmack read up on 3-D graphics and cobbled together a wireframe version of the MTV logo, which he managed to spin around on his screen. The real way to explore the world of graphics, he knew, was to make a game. Carmack didn’t believe in waiting for the muse. He decided it was more efficient to use other people’s ideas. Shadowforge, his first game, resembled Ultima in many ways but featured a couple of inventive programming tricks, such as characters who attacked in arbitrary directions as opposed to the ordinary cardinal ones. It also became his first sale: earning a thousand dollars from a company called Nite Owl Productions, a mom’n’pop publisher that made most of its income from manufacturing camera batteries. Carmack used the money to buy himself an Apple II GS, the next step up in the Apple’s line. He strengthened his body to keep up with his mind. He began lifting weights, practicing judo, and wrestling. One day after school, a bully tried to pick on Carmack’s neighbor, only to become a victim of Carmack’s judo skills. Other times Carmack fought back with his intellect. After being partnered with him for an earth science project, a bully demanded that Carmack do all the work himself. Carmack agreed. They ended up getting an F “How could you get an F?” the bully said. “You’re the smartest guy around.” Carmack had purposely failed the project, sacrificing his own grade rather than let the oaf prevail. Carmack’s increasingly cocksure attitude was not going over well at home. After he became more combative with his stepmother–whose vegetarianism and mystical beliefs incensed the young pragmatic–his father rented an apartment where Carmack and his younger brother, Peter, could live while they finished high school. The first day there, Carmack plugged in his Apple II, 22\n\ntacked a magazine ad for a new hard drive to his wall, and got to work. There were games to make. One night in 1987, Carmack saw the ultimate game. It occurred in the opening episode of a new television series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, when the captain visited the ship’s Holodeck, a futuristic device that could simulate immersive environments for relaxation and entertainment. In this case, the door opened to reveal a tropical paradise. Carmack was intrigued. This was the virtual world. It was just a matter of finding the technology to make it happen. In the meantime, Carmack had his own games to pursue. Having graduated high school, he was ready to cash in the trust fund that his father, years before, had told him would be available when he turned eighteen. But when he went to retrieve the money, he found that his mother had transferred it to her account in Seattle. She had no intention of letting her son use the fund for some ridiculous endeavor like trying to go into business making computer games. Her philosophy had not wavered: if you want to go into computers, then you need to go to college, preferably MIT, get a degree, and get a job with a good company like IBM. Carmack fired off a vitriolic letter: “Why can’t you realise [sic] that it isn’t your job to direct me anymore?” But there was no swaying his mother, who argued that her son had yet to balance his checkbook, let alone manage his finances. If Carmack wanted the money, he would have to sign up for college, pay for the courses himself, and then, if he earned grades that she deemed worthy, he would be reimbursed. In the fall of 1988, the eighteen-year-old Carmack reluctantly enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he signed up for an entire schedule of computer classes. It was a miserable time. He couldn’t relate to the students, didn’t care about keg parties and frat houses. Worse were the classes, based on memorizing information from textbooks. There was no challenge, no creativity. The tests weren’t just dull, they were insulting. “Why can’t you just give us a project and let us perform it?” Carmack scrawled on the back of one ol his exams. ”I can perform anything you want me to!” After enduring two semesters, he dropped out. Much to his mother’s chagrin, Carmack took a part-time job at a pizza parlor and immersed himself in his second game, Wraith. It was an exhausting process that required him constantly to insert and eject floppy disks in order to save the data because his Apple II GS didn’t come with a hard drive. He labored over a story included in the game’s “about” file: WRAITH “THE DEVIL’S DEMISE” For a long while all was peaceful on The island of Arathia. Your duties as protector of the temple of Metiria at Tarot were simple and 23\n\nuneventful. Recently things have changed. An unknown influence has caused the once devout followers of the true god Metiria to waver in their faith. Corruption has spread through the Island, with whispers of an undead being of great might granting power to those who would serve. The lords of the realms fell to him one by one, and monsters now roam the land. The temple at Tarot is the last outpost of true faith, and you may be Arathia’s last hope for redemption. Last night, as you prayed for strength and guidance, Metiria came to you in a vision, bestowing upon you the quest to destroy the Wraith. She spoke solemnly, alerting you to the dangers which lay ahead. The only way to reach the hell that the Wraith rules from is by way of an interplanar gate somewhere in Castle Strafire, stronghold of his most powerful earthly minions. Although the castle is only a short distance away from Tarot, on an island to the northeast, a terrible reef prevents it from being reached by conventional means. You only know that monsters have come from the castle and turned up on the mainland. Remember, although many have been seduced by the power of the Wraith, greed still rules their hearts, and some may even aid your quest if paid enough gold. As the vision fades, Metiria smiles and says, “Fear not, brave one, my blessing is upon you.” You have began preparing yourself for your quest, but even the townspeople seem unwilling to help you. They insist on gold for equipment and spells. Gold you do not have. Gold that the servants of the Wraith do have… Carmack sent the game to Nite Owl, the publisher of Shadowforge, which snapped it up. Though the graphics were not breakthrough–they had the chunky stick figures of most games–the game was huge in scope compared with most titles, offerings hours more of play. He earned twice as much this time, two thousand dollars, despite the fact that the game, like Shadowforge, was not a big seller, Carmack used the cash to finance his other hobby: modifying his car, a brown MGB. Though he was barely getting by, Carmack relished the freelance lifestyle. He was in control of his time, slept as late as he wanted, and, even better, answered to no one. If he could simply program the computer, fix up his car, and play D&D for the rest of his life, he would be happy. All he needed to do was churn out more games. It didn’t take long for him to find another buyer listed in the back of a computer magazine: a small company in Shreveport, Louisiana, called Softdisk. After buying his first submission–a Tennis game with impressive physics of the rise and fall of balls over a net– they immediately wanted more. Taking a cue from the Ultima series, Carmack, 24\n\nalready a shrewd businessman, suggested selling not just one game but a trilogy: why not triple his earnings? Softdisk accepted the offer, contracting him to do a trilogy of role-playing games called Dark Designs. Carmack learned another way to cash in: converting his Apple II games for a new breed of computer called the IBM PC. He knew next to nothing about this system but was not one to turn down a programming challenge. So he drove to a store and rented a PC. Within a month he sent Softdisk not only an Apple II version of Dark Designs but a version converted, or “ported,” for a PC as well. Working long into the night, Carmack got his process so down pat he could create one game and port three versions; one for the Apple, one for the Apple II GS, and one tor the PC. Softdisk would buy each and every one. With every new game, the company begged Carmack to come down for an interview. Who was this kid who’d taught himself an entirely new programming language in half the time it would take a normal person? Carmack declined at first–why screw up his life by going to work for a company? But eventually their persistence won him over. He had just put some nice new parts in his MGB and could use an excuse for a long drive. Alter all those years on his own, he hardly expected to meet someone who had something to teach him.\n\n25\n\nTHREE\n\nDangerous Dave In Copyright Infringement\n\nS\n\nhreveport was renowned in the art of simulation long before the gamers arrived. In 1864, Confederate soldiers at Fort Turnbull duped invaders by positioning charred tree trunks on mounted wagons, as if they were cannons. Spotting the apparent artillery, Union soldiers fled in fear. When a Confederate general came to inspect the site, he told the forts commander that his defenses were “nothing but a bunch of humbug.” The site became known as Fort Humbug. One hundred and twenty-seven years later, there were new simulated weapons in town–inside the computer games of Softdisk. The company was helmed by Al Vekovius, a former math professor at Louisiana State University at Shreveport. Though only in his forties, Al had a receding hairline with strands sticking up as if he had just taken his hands off one of those static electricity spheres found at state fairs. He dressed in muted ties and sweaters but possessed the eccentric streak shared by the students and faculty he would visit in the university computer lab during his job there in seventies. At the time the Hacker Ethic was reverberating from MIT to Silicon Valley. As head of the academic computing section at the school, Al, by vocation and passion, was plugged in from the start. He wasn’t tall or fat, but the kids affectionately called him Big Al. Energized by this emerging Zeitgeist, in 1981 Al and another LSUS mathematician, Jim Mangham, hatched a business scheme: a computer software subscription club. For a small fee, a subscriber would receive a new disk every month filled with a variety of utility and entertainment programs, from 26\n\ncheckbook balancing software to solitaire. The plan filled what to Al and his partner seemed like an obvious niche: the computer hobbyist. At the time the big software publishers largely neglected individual consumers, focusing instead on reaching businesses through retail. Though hobbyists congregated on BBSs, the computer bulletin board services online, early modems were still too slow to provide a viable distribution means. A monthly disk seemed like a perfect way to distribute wares to the underground. It also seemed like a great way to give exposure to young coders, who did not have another means through which to distribute their programs; it was like an independent record label, putting unsigned bands on compilation albums. In 1981 Softdisk’s first disk went out for users of the Apple II. Business went well, and the company soon expanded with programs for both Apple and Commodore computers. In 1986 the company launched a subscription disk for the IBM personal computer and its burgeoning clones, machines that could run the same operating systems. Personal computers at long last were plummeting into affordability. As a result a world of new computer users– sometimes called “newbies”–opened up. By 1987 Softdisk had 100,000 subscribers who were paying $9,95 per month to get the disks. Al was voted Shreveport’s businessman of the year. The good times brought challenges. Al was soon running a $12 million company with 120 employees and feeling overwhelmed. Competition followed, including a company in New Hampshire called Uptime. In the winter of 1989, Al phoned Jay Wilbur, an Uptime editor he had met at a gaming convention, and asked him if he wanted to come down and help. Jay, who was growing tired of the cold and feeling underappreciated by the Uptime owner, agreed to run Softdisk’s Apple II department. He also mentioned that he knew two game programmers, John Romero and Lane Roathe–a former Uptime programmer–who were looking for work too. Al was thrilled. Though he had occasionally been including games on his disks, he sensed an opportunity to expand into the emerging PC entertainment marketplace. He could see other successful companies like Sierra OnLine, Broderbund, and Origin doing well in games. There was no reason that Softdisk couldn’t have a larger piece of that pie as well. He told Jay to bring the gamers down too. For Romero, the stakes couldn’t have been higher. He had just been through a series of disappointments, from the unrelenting winters of New Hampshire to his faulty gamble to leave his dream job at Origin for his boss’s ill-fated start-up. His wife and kids were clear across the country, waiting to see how his fortune would turn. Despite his early successes, a family life was once\n\n27\n\nagain slipping to the wayside. He hoped a new life down south would turn things around. The road trip from New Hampshire to Shreveport that summer of 1989 was just the prescription. Along the way, he bonded with his fellow gamers, Lane and Jay. Lane, with whom Romero had lived for a month, was very much a kindred spirit. Five years older than Romero, Lane came from a similar background. He’d grown up in Colorado, not far from where Romero was born, raised on heavy metal, underground comics, and computer games. Easygoing, with long hair wrapped in a bandanna, Lane got along perfectly with Romero. Though he didn’t share Romero’s insurmountable energy or ambition, he too loved the nuances, tricks, and thrills of Apple II programming. And, like Romero, all he wanted to do was make games. While in New Hampshire, the two even decided to merge their one-man-band companies– Romero’s Capitol Ideas and Lanes Blue Mountain Micro–under one roof as Ideas From the Deep. Jay was an Apple II guy as well, but of a different nature. By his own admission, he wasn’t much of a programmer. But he had two important qualities that Romero respected: a genuine understanding of Apple II code and an intense passion for games. Seven years older than Romero, the thirty-yearold Jay grew up in Rhode Island as the son of an insurance adjuster and a gift card saleswoman. In high school Jay was tall but not skilled in sports. Instead he had a way with machines, whether racking up high scores in Asteroids or dismantling his motorcycle. He used the money he received from insurance after a motorcycle accident in his early twenties to buy his first Apple II. It didn’t take long for Jay to realize that his predisposition was not for the solitary lifestyle of code. He was much more suited tor the world of schmoozing and good times, a world he excelled in as a bartender at a neighborhood T.G.I. Friday’s restaurant. He became beloved in his bar and was even selected to teach Tom Cruise how to mix drinks in preparation for the bartender film Cocktail. Jay’s people skills led to him into restaurant management. Later at Uptime he was able to combine his skills: as a manager and as a game enthusiast. Now, at Softdisk, he was ready to soar even higher. By the time they hit Shreveport Lane, Romero, and Jay felt like old friends. They had made an adventure of the trip down, stopping for a few days at Disney World. As they pulled up in Shreveport, however, they had no sense of their future or, for that matter, if they had even arrived. Baked into the northwest corner of Louisiana just a tobacco spit from Texas, Shreveport was in rough shape in 1989. A busted oil boom had left the area deflated and depressed. The air was thick with humidity, made thicker by the overgrown patches of swamps. Downtown crawled with homeless people escaping the heat in the shadows of rundown brick buildings–including the offices of Softdisk. 28\n\nSoftdisk occupied two buildings in the downtown area. The administration office was built under a blacktop parking lot; the passing street sloped down a hill near the door. It was like working in an ant farm. As the gamers arrived, Al burst through the door with sparkling eyes, gushing about how quickly the company was growing and how eagerly he wanted their help. Romero and Lane showed him an Asteroids knockoff they’d made called Zappa Roids. Al was impressed, not only by their obvious programming abilities but by their youthful zeal. Romero made his ambition clear from the start–he had no interest in working on utility programs; he wanted only to make big commercial games. That was fine with Al, who explained how excited he was to get into the gaming world. Romero and Lane would be the first two employees in a new Special Projects division devoted solely to making games. On the way out, Al patted Romero on the back and said, “By the way, let me know if you boys need an apartment to rent. I’ve got some places in town; I’m a landlord too.” Romero, Lane, and Jay left Softdisk’s business office for the building where the programmers and “talent” worked. For a software company, it sure didn’t seem like fun. Squeezed between floors of insurance brokers, each programmer worked in a separate quiet office under bright fluorescent lights. There was no music, no revelry, no game playing. Life at Softdisk had become something of a pressure cooker, with several programs to get out the door every month. Romero introduced himself to a group of programmers. They asked whether Big Al had offered him a place to rent. When Romero said yes, they snickered. “Don’t do it,” one of the guys said. He told Romero how when he got hired he took Al up on the offer, only to find the apartment in a desperate state of squalor–a wooden shack in a bad part of town. When the guy lay on the couch, he saw a long worm poke its head up out of a patch of dirt on the floor. But nothing could get Romero down. He was back on track. The sun was shining. He had a job making games. His wife, Kelly, and toddlers, Michael and Steven, would be happy in the new environment. Now they could have a fresh start. He called and told Kelly to pack her bags; they were moving to Shreveport. Romero and Lane spent their first weeks living out their dream, working on games in the Special Projects division. Romero had another agenda too: to pull himself away from the Apple II and convert to the PC. Early on he told Al that he thought the Apple II was on the way out, especially because of the rise of clones of the IBM PC. By refusing to incorporate the new IBM software standard, Apple was rapidly diminishing as the personal computer of choice. What Romero didn’t tell Al was that he felt like he was missing the 29\n\nboat. His unbridled devotion to the Apple II, he thought had put him about a year behind the curve. If he was going to be a Future Rich Person and Ace Programmer, he was going to have to master the PC before it was too late. “You can’t keep programming into the future on the same machines,” Romero told Al. “I want you to know that I do not know the PC but I’ll learn it really fast.” “That’s fine by me,” Al said. “Do whatever you want.” What Romero wanted to do was learn a hot new programming language called C. But he was told he couldn’t pursue it because the other programmers in the department didn’t know it. Romero felt limited by the others’ lack of skills. Instead, while polishing his game Zappa Raids, he hit the books, consuming everything he could about the PC programming languages Pascal and 8086 assembly. He soon knew enough to port one of his old Apple II games called Pyramids of Egypt to the PC. Within the first month, he had published something on Softdisk’s main PC software product, the Big Blue Disk. The problem was that his work on the Big Blue Disk started going too well. The PC department, overtaxed and unenergetic, started to rely more and more heavily on Romero’s skills. By the end of his first month, he was spending more time rewriting other people’s PC programs than working on his own games. Before he knew it, the Special Projects division was kaput. Al needed Romero instead to work on utility programs on the PC disk. Though Lane had the option to join Romero at Softdisk, he stuck with the Apple II division. It was the first sign, Romero thought, that his friend didn’t share his vision of the future, the sense of opportunity that awaited in PC, not Apple, games. Since Romero still wanted to learn the PC, he agreed to join that team for the time being. But, he told Al, he wanted to make games when the time was right. That time began to feel like it was never going to come. Romero grew unhappy. He spent nearly a year working on PC utilities programs. He did manage to refine his skills on the PC by porting more of his old Apple II games over to this platform. But PCs were still largely thought of as having only business applications, After all, they displayed just a handful of colors and squeaked out sounds through tiny, tinny speakers. Romero was nowhere near making games full-time. To make matters worse, Romero’s home life was bearing down. In order to save money, he moved his wife and kids into a house with Lane and Jay in nearby Haughton, Louisiana. It was tense, with the kids running around and Romero’s wife growing frustrated by his long hours and her lack of a social life. He would try to assure her, but she would just sit on the couch and mope. She was starting to lose hope that anything would become more important to him than his games. 30\n\nThe bad vibes didn’t let up at work either. Romero’s initial impression of the beaten-down Softdisk crew only turned worse. Al was feeling the pains of running an increasingly big business and, to keep thing’s in order, began to crack down. Romero and Lane were reprimanded for turning off the fluorescent lights in their office, a move they pulled because they hated the glare on their machines. Romero was also chastised for playing his music too loud. Grudgingly, he wore headphones. The employees were getting on his nerves too. No one seemed to be motivated. A narcoleptic technical support worker kept falling asleep on the job–even while being asked a question. Romero got in the habit of cranking up the heavy metal music in his office just to wake the guy up. Then there was Mountain Man, the guy running the Apple II department. He had been a buttoned-down engineer at Hewlett-Packard when one day he had something of a breakdown and went off to live in the mountains for a year. He came back in a cut-off denim jacket with a long, scraggly beard and took over the Apple II department at Softdisk. But his Zen-like philosophy of life didn’t do much for the growth of the department, Romero thought. Romero confronted Al. “You told me that I would make big commercial games, and all I’m doing is helping them out in the PC department. If things don’t change, I’m going to leave and go work for Lucas Arts,” he said, referring to the new gaming company launched by George Lucas, creator of Star Wars. Big Al didn’t like what he was hearing. Romero had proven to be one of his most valuable employees. He admired the kid’s ability to focus. Whenever Al came by to check up, Romero was sitting there with his big square glasses pressed up against the computer monitor, working for hours on end. He told Romero he didn’t want him to go. Romero said he had spent the last year studying all the PC games and felt they were glaringly under par. Because the PC was still not as robust as the Apple II, the games were lackluster–static little screens with crappy graphics, nothing approaching the sophistication of the games being done for the Apple II. Now was the time to strike. Al agreed and suggested they start a subscription disk dedicated to games, a monthly. “Monthly?” Romero said, “No way, one month is nowhere near enough time.” “Well, our subscribers are already used to a monthly disk,” Al said. “Maybe we could do it every other month, but that would be pushing it.” “I think we can do that. That’s still not a great amount of time, but we could probably do something decent, but I’m going to need a team: an artist, a couple programmers, and a manager, because I don’t want to sit there interfacing with management all day; I want to program.” Al told Romero he couldn’t have an artist; he’d have to farm out the work to someone in the existing art department. But he could have a manager and another programmer; he just had to find them. 31\n\nRomero ran back to the Apple II department to tell Lane and Jay the good news: “Dudes, we’re fucking making games!” Lane would now be editor of Gamer’s Edge, Softdisk’s new bimonthly games disk for the PC. All that remained was to get another programmer, someone who knew the PC and, just as important, could fit in with Lane and Romero. Jay said there was someone he knew who was definitely hard-core. This kid was turning in great games. And he even knew how to port from the Apple II to the PC. Romero was impressed by the apparent similarities to himself. But there was a problem, Jay said. The Whiz Kid had already turned down a job after three times because he liked working freelance. Romero pleaded with Jay to try him again. Jay wasn’t optimistic but said okay. He picked up the phone and gave John Carmack one last pitch. When Carmack pulled up to Softdisk in his brown MGB, he had no intention of taking the job. But, then again, times were getting rough. Though he enjoyed the idea of the freelance lifestyle, he was having trouble making rent and would frequently find himself pestering editors like Jay to express him his checks so he could buy groceries. A little stability wouldn’t be bad, but he wasn’t eager to compromise his hard work and ideals to get there. It would take something significant to sway him. When Al met Carmack, he was thrown off. This was the Whiz Kid he’d heard so much about? A nineteen-year-old in ripped jeans and a tattered Tshirt who, despite his muscles, seemed not to have reached puberty yet? But Carmack did pack plenty of attitude. When Al spelled out the plan for Gamers Edge, Carmack brushed off the tight deadline as no problem at all. He was brutally honest in his criticism of the current crop of games, including those being put out by Softdisk. Al showed Carmack to the other building, where Romero and Lane were eagerly waiting. On the way, Carmack was impressed to see a stack of Dr Dobb’s Journals, the magazine for hackers, which grew out of the Homebrew Computer Club. But the strongest impression came when he met Lane and Romero, a meeting that bordered on the kinetic. Within moments the three programmers were discussing the spectrum of game programming, from the challenges of double resolution 16-bit graphics for the Apple II to the nuances of 8086 assembly language. They talked nonstop, not just about computers but about their other common interests: Dungeons and Dragons, Asteroids, The Lord of the Rings. Carmack told them about how he never had the computers he wanted when he was growing up. Romero said, “Man, I would have bought you those machines.” Carmack was unprepared to meet anyone who could keep up with him intellectually, particularly in programming. Not only could these two guys talk the talk but they actually knew more than Carmack himself. They weren’t just good, they were better than he was, he thought. Romero was inspiring, 32\n\nnot only in his knowledge of programming but in his all-around skills: his artistry, his design. Carmack was cocky, but if someone could teach him, he wasn’t going to let his ego get in the way. On the contrary, he was going to listen and stick around. He was going to take the Softdisk job.\n\nBefore the Gamer’s Edge crew could get started, they needed one vital machine: a fridge. Making computer games required an accessible mound of junk food, soda, and pizza. And to eat this stuff, they’d need someplace convenient to stash it. Romero, Carmack, and Lane agreed to kick in $180 of their own money to buy a used refrigerator for their new office, a small room in the back of Softdisk. But as they carried the appliance through the door, they felt the icy stares ol the jealous employees around them. All week they had been coming into the office with accessories: a microwave, a boom box, a Nintendo. Fucking Romero even came in with a video game! It was, Romero told them, research. The other employees weren’t buying it. Worst of all was when they saw some workmen wheeling in a fleet of sparkling new 386 PCs–the fastest computers around–for the gamers. Everyone else in the company was stuck working on machines that were about one-fourth the power. When the Gamer’s Edge guys had everything set up, they plugged in the microwave and popped in some pizza. But the moment they hit cook, all the lights in the office fizzled out. This was grounds for a revolt, the other employees decided. They went to speak with Big Al. Al was quick to quiet the storm. The Gamer’s Edge crew, he explained patiently, wasn’t just out to have a good time, they were out to save the company. Yes, he said, save the company. The boom of the recent years, he told them, was coming to a close. The company had sunk tremendous resources into the ill-fated Apple II line. Al had recently been forced to lay off twenty-five people in one day. “Look,” he told the employees who were bemoaning the Gamers Edge project, “don’t complain. If these guys make a home run, we’ll all benefit from it. It’ll work. Don’t worry.” Truth was, Big Al was worried himself. He walked down to the Gamer’s Edge office and opened the door, It was pitchblack, except for the glow of the computer monitors. He went to flip the light switch, but nothing happened. “Oh,” Romero said, “we took out the lights. They sucked.” “Fluorescent,” Lane explained, squinting, “hard on the eyes.” Al looked up. The light sockets were gutted of their tubes. The team had clearly made itself at home. He saw the microwave, the fridge, the junk food. Metallica played from a boom box. A dart-strewn poster of the hair metal band Warrant hung on the wall. Carmack, Lane, and Romero each sat at his own fancy machine. “Look,” Al said, “we can’t take two months to get out 33\n\nthis first disk. We have to get it out in four weeks. And you have to have two games on it so we can entice people to subscribe.” “One month!” they cried. Two months, the original deadline, was tight enough. There was no way they could come up with two games from scratch. They would have to port a couple of their existing Apple II games to PC–a specialty that both Carmack and Romero could handle. And they had just the titles: Dangerous Dave, an Apple II game of Romero’s, and The Catacomb, a title of Carmack’s. Romero had made his first Dangerous Dave back in 1988 for Uptime. It was a fairly straightforward adventure game, featuring a tiny little splotch of a guy with a purple bodysuit and green cap. The object was to run and jump through mazes and collect treasure without getting killed first. Donkey Kong, the arcade game from Nintendo, had a similar paradigm, one Romero admired. Catacomb was Carmack’s latest spin on the role-playing worlds he’d first explored with Shadowforge and Wraith. This one would show an even stronger influence from Gauntlet, the popular arcade game in which characters could run through mazes, shooting monsters along the way, casting spells. It was like Dungeons and Dragons with action. This was also a key point of communion for the Two Johns: their admiration for fast-action arcade games, their desire to emulate them, and, most important, their unbridled confidence in their abilities. They turned up the stereo. There was work to be done. Romero gleefully referred to the ensuing experience as “crunch mode” or “the death schedule”–a masochistically pleasurable stretch of programming work involving sleep deprivation, caffeine gorging, and loud music. For pure sportsmanship, Carmack and Romero had a little contest to see who could port a game the fastest It didn’t take long for the Ace Programmer to see just how fast the Whiz Kid was, as Carmack fairly easily pulled ahead. It was all in good fun. And Romero was full of admiration for his new friend and colleague. They coded late into the nights. There was a bitter reason tor Romero’s increased freedom. He was getting a divorce. Being a twenty-two-year-old Future Rich Person was challenging enough, without the demands of husbandry and parenthood. His wife didn’t share his love for games and, in Romero’s mind, was becoming even more depressed. She wanted family dinners, church, Saturday barbecues–things that Romero was feeling increasingly ill-equipped to provide. For a while he had tried to make both worlds work, even leaving the office early while the others stayed behind. But it was never enough. The truth was, Romero didn’t know if he had enough to give. Though part of him wanted to have the family he never had as a child, he sometimes felt that he wasn’t programmed to be that kind of husband and dad. It would be best for everyone, they agreed, if they split up. But Kelly didn’t just want this; she wanted to split to California to be closer to her family. Romero felt crushed. At the same time, he knew that he couldn’t handle having the boys live with 34\n\nhim. Instead, he convinced himself he could make long-distance fatherhood work. Even with several states between them, they would be closer than he ever was with his dad. Rather than dwell on his family life, Romero immersed himself in Gamer’s Edge. Working on the ports had helped Carmack and Romero realize how they could best work together given their strengths and weaknesses. Carmack was most interested in programming the guts of the game–what was called the engine. This integral code told the computer how to display graphics on the screen. Romero enjoyed making the software tools–essentially the palette they would use to create characters and environments or “maps” of the game–as well as the game design–how the game play would unfold, what action would take place, what would make it fun. It was like yin and yang. While Carmack was exceptionally talented in programming, Romero was multitalented in art, sound, and design. And while Carmack had played video games as a kid, no one had played as many as Romero. The ultimate coder and the ultimate gamer–together they were a perfect fit. But Lane wasn’t fitting in at all. He was still serving as editor of the Gamer’s Edge project but becoming more distant. Unlike Romero, Lane was not enthused about the PC. Romero could tell that his old friend was not up to the task. And, as quickly as he had once decided to befriend Lane, Romero shut him out. In Romero’s eyes. Lane wasn’t up to the rigors of the death schedule. And Romero didn’t want anything standing in the way of the teams profitability. With Carmack, he had everything he needed. One time when Lane left the room, Romero spun around and told Carmack, “Let’s get him out of here.” At the same time, there was someone Carmack and especially Romero wanted in: Tom Hall. Tom was a twenty-five-year-old programmer who had been working in the Apple II department since before Romero arrived. He was also, in Romero’s mind, fucking hysterical. Tall and witty, Tom existed in an accelerated state of absurdity, as though nothing could keep up with the creative output pouring from his mind. His office was covered in yellow Post-it note reminders and doodles. Every day he had a ridiculous new message on his computer screen, such as “The Adventures of Squishy and the Amazing Blopmeister.” When Romero would pass him, Torn would frequently raise an eyebrow and emit an alien like chirping sound, then continue on his way. And: he was a gamer. Born and raised in Wisconsin, Tom didn’t have to work nearly as hard as Romero or Carmack to get into games. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a journalist whom Tom described as “the Erma Bombeck of Milwaukee,” 35\n\nprovided their youngest son with all the ammunition he needed to pursue his early obsession; an Atari 2600 home gaming system and, shortly thereafter, an Apple II. Tom was charmingly odd. He would parade around the house in a Green Bay Packers helmet and red Converse sneakers. At school, his security blanket came in the form of a brown paper grocery sack filled with all his drawings and eight-millimeter films. He carried it everywhere, keeping it beside his desk during class. Eventually he weaned himself down to a satchel and then, in high school, a small bag. A Star Wars nut, he saw the film thirty-three times. He was just as passionate about quirky sports. He was the state Frisbee golf champion. He also loved origami and domino construction, building elaborate mazes around his parents’ house. While other kids worshiped pop stars and athletes, Tom’s hero was Bob Speca: the world domino toppling pro. When Tom got his Apple II, it became an infinite world into which he could explode. Like Carmack and Romero, Tom taught himself to make games as quickly as he could. By the time he entered the University of Wisconsin to study computer science, he had made almost a hundred games, most of them imitations ol arcade hits like Donkey Kong. Unlike Carmack and Romero, Tom enjoyed being a student. He immersed himself in cross-disciplinary studies, ranging from languages to physics and anthropology. The computer game, he believed, was a unique medium into which he could incorporate those disciplines. He could invent a language for aliens in a game. He could program realistic physics. He could write stories, invent characters. He began volunteering around campus, eventually making games for learning-disabled kids. Tom relished their enjoyment of his work, the looks on their faces when they escaped into the worlds he created. He wasn’t just making games for himself, he was making them for this audience. Though games were barely acknowledged as a legitimate form of expression, let alone a legitimate art form, Tom was convinced that they were almost sublime forms of communication, just as films or novels. After graduating college, Tom found his dreams dashed. When his resumes to game companies went unanswered, he did what most college graduates did with their dreams–gave up and applied for “real jobs.” Every time he put on his suit and went for an interview, the person on the other side of the desk would ask him the same exact question: “Is this really what you want to do?” Finally Tom listened to the answer he gave in his head and said no. Shortly thereafter, he got a job at Softdisk. Torn took an instant liking to Romero, who came on more than a year after he had started. Romero loved one of the games Tom had recently made called Legend of the Star Axe. It was clearly descended from Tom’s favorite book, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy–a kind of Monty Python meets Star Wars romp by the British cult author Douglas Adams. The game fea36\n\ntured an intergalactic ‘57 Chevy and a host of quirky characters like the Blehs– green creatures with two big eye sockets who went around trying to scare people by saying, “Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!” As much as Romero and Carmack connected as programmers, Romero and Tom connected as comedians. They were always riffing off each other, transforming Tom’s alien chirps into an elaborate language of blips and bleeps. They shared a love of dark comedy. Tom might say something like “go press your man-beef in a sheep’s musky hollows” and Romero would respond by telling Tom to “go slice open a goat and tie the warm, wet intestines around you for a cock ring.” They were never at a loss for sick jokes. While Carmack and Romero were working on Catacomb and Dangerous Dave, Tom would frequently drop by to help. With Lane slipping, Romero decided to recruit Tom officially as the new managing editor of Gamer’s Edge. Tom was as eager to work on games full-time as the other guys. Plus, he too realized that the days of the Apple II were numbered. Games for PCs were the future, his future. But Al Vekovius wasn’t having any of it. Tom was already managing editor of the Apple II disk, and that was where he would stay. Though disappointed, Romero and Carmack knew they could survive for the time being without Tom; what they couldn’t survive without was an artist. Up until then the game programmer was responsible for doing his own artwork. But as Romero and Carmack envisioned making more ambitious games,, they wanted to have someone who was as skilled in and focused on art as they were on programming and design. Though Romero was a more than competent artist–he had done the art for all his old Apple II games–he was ready to leave those responsibilities to someone else, specifically a twentyone-year-old intern named Adrian Carmack. Coincidentally, Adrian shared John Carmacks last name though they were not related. With dark hair down to his waist, Adrian stood out in the straitlaced art department from the moment he arrived. That department, Romero lamented, was as sluggish as the rest of the company. They weren’t gamers, they didn’t even think about games. All they did was churn out little blocks of graphics for check-balancing programs and clocked out at the end of the day. Adrian had a spark–plus, an awesome collection of heavy metal T-shirts. But Adrian, unbeknownst to Romero, wasn’t much of a gamer–not anymore, at least, though games had lured him to art. Growing up in Shreveport, Adrian went through the arcade phase, spending his afternoons playing Asteroids and Pac-Man with his friends. He so liked the artwork on the cabinets that he began copying the illustrations, along with Molly Hatchet album covers, in his notebooks during class. As an adolescent, Adrian found\n\n37\n\nhimself sinking more deeply into his art, leaving even video games in the past. There were other things weighing on his mind. When Adrian was thirteen, his father–who sold sausages for a local food company–died suddenly of a heart attack. Adrian, already quiet and sensitive, fell deeper into withdrawal. While his mother, a loan officer, and two younger sisters tried to cope, Adrian spent more time illustrating. Not surprisingly for a teenage boy with a pet scorpion, the ideas and subject matter that most compelled him were dark. In college the inspiration turned grimly real. To earn money tor school, Adrian worked as an aide in the medical communications department of a local hospital. His job was to photocopy pictures taken of patients in the emergency room, the most graphic images of fatality and disease. He saw bedsores so terrible the skin was tailing from the bone. He saw gunshot wounds, severed limbs. One time a farmer came in with a wooden fence post driven through his groin. The pictures took on an almost fetishistic quality, as Adrian traded them with his friends. His artwork became not only darker but more skillful. His college art mentor, Lemoins Batan, recognized Adrian’s talents, his ability to draw with precise and seemingly effortless detail. When Lemoins asked Adrian what he wanted to do, his student told him that he’d like to work in fine art. In the meantime, he was looking for experience. His teacher had heard through the grapevine of somewhere he might start: Softdisk. When Adrian found out that the company was looking tor people to do art for computer software, he was less than intrigued. He was partial to pencil and paper, not keyboard and printer. But the Softdisk internship paid better than the hospital, so he agreed, laboring at the innocuous work until one day he returned to find his boss arguing loudly with two young programmers. One of the other artists came over to Adrian and said, “You know what’s going on?” “No,” Adrian replied quietly, “I have no idea.” “They’re talking about you.” “Oh shit, man, I’m toast.” Adrian assumed something was wrong, that he was being fired. The two young programmers came up to him when they were through and introduced themselves as Carmack and Romero, his partners at Gamer’s Edge. For the next Gamer’s Edge disk, they were going to make only one game. Al agreed to that plan, letting Romero and Carmack pursue their vision of making one big commercial game from scratch every two months–still a considerable feat. But with their roles in place–Carmack doing the engine; Romero, the software tools and game design; Adrian, the art; Lane, the management and miscellaneous coding–it seemed within their reach. 38\n\nThe idea for the next game came from Carmack, who was experimenting with a breakthrough bit of programming that created an illusion of movement beyond the confines of the screen. It was called scrolling. Again, arcade games were the model. At first, the action of arcade games all took place within one static screen; in Pong, players controlled paddles that could move only from the bottom to the top of the screen as they hit a ball back and forth; in Pac-Man, the character would chomp dots as he cruised, within a confined maze; in Space Invaders, players controlled a ship at the bottom ol the screen that would shoot at descending alien ships. There was never a sense of broad movement, as though the players or enemies were actually progressing outside the box. All this changed in 1980, when Williams Electronics released Defender, the first arcade game to popularize the idea of scrolling beyond the scope of the screen. In this sci-fi shoot-’em-up, players controlled a spaceship that moved horizontally above a planet surface, shooting down aliens and rescuing people along the way. A tiny map on the screen would show the player the entire scope of the world, which, if stretched out, would be the equivalent ol about three and a hall screens. Compared with the other games in the arcade, Defender felt big, as if the player was living and breathing in a more expansive virtual space. It became a phenomenal hit–filling almost as many arcades as Space Invaders and beating out Pac-Man as the industry’s Game of the Year. Countless scrolling games would follow. By 1989 scrolling was the “it” technology, fueling in part the success of the best-selling home video game in history at the time: Super Mario Brothers 3 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. But at this moment, in September 1990, no one had yet figured out how to scroll games for the PC; instead, they would use lame trickery to make the player feel like the action was larger than the screen. A player might get to the light edge of the screen and then, in one clunky movement, see the panel from the right shift over into place. The reason, in part, was the PCs’ slow speed, which paled compared with those of arcade machines, the Apple II or home consoles like the Nintendo. Carmack was determined to find a way to create a smooth scrolling effect, like the one in Defender or Super Mario. The next Gamer’s Edge game would be a step in that direction. When the crew discussed ideas for the game, Carmack demonstrated a technology he was working on that could scroll the action down the screen. Unlike the more sophisticated scrolling games, this one was set up like a treadmill–the graphics would descend the screen on a steady, set path. There was no sense that the player was willfully moving up through the action. It was more like standing on a stage and having a rolling landscape painting move behind the actor. Romero, the erudite gamer who had played nearly every available title for the PC, had never seen anything like it; here was a chance at being the first. They called the game Slordax; it would be a straightforward shoot-the39\n\nspaceships descendant of arcade hits like Space Invaders and Galaga. They had four weeks. From the start of the work on Slordax, the team gelled. Carmack would bang away at his code for the graphics engine while Romero developed the programming tools to create the actual characters and sections of the game. As Carmack engineered breakthrough code, Romero designed gripping game play. Tom Hall even managed to sneak into the Gamer’s Edge office to create the creatures and backgrounds. Adrian, meanwhile, would sketch out the spaceships and asteroids on his screen. It was clear right away to Romero that the quiet intern was talented. Though still new to computers, Adrian quickly assimilated with a palette on screen. Computer art at the time was almost like pointillism because game graphics were so limited. Most had only four colors, in what was known as Computer Graphics Adapter, or CGA; recently, games had evolved to allow "
