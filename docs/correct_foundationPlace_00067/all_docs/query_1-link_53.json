We have moved from managing deformities and fractures with straight rods and single point fixation to complex three-dimensional reconstruction using multi-segmental pedicular instrumentation. We have moved from maximally invasive surgical exposures to minimally invasive techniques that allow patients to rapidly regain their normal activities and work status while minimizing their downtime. We are now beginning to embrace the idea of maintaining motion with arthroplasty rather automatically proceeding with arthrodesis. As these transitions have occurred, the technical expertise required for the procedures has become more demanding. Due to the imperfect nature of the human biologic system, not all of these procedures will be successful, so options for salvage techniques must be devised. Alexander Vaccaro and Todd Albert are to be congratulated for the publication of this second edition of the book that provides the answers to many of the “how to, when to, and how do I get out of this” questions related to spine surgery. This revised edition has eighty-one chapters written by internationally recognized giants in the spine surgery arena. These contributors have compiled their experiences into a very concise, organized presentation of each topic, allowing rapid overview but also providing strict attention to detail. The format is consistent throughout the textbook, with each chapter providing an initial description of the technique or problem, key principles and expectations, indications, contraindications, and special considerations. Next, specific instructions, positioning, and anesthesia requirements are discussed. This is followed by tips, pearls and lessons learned, difficulties encountered, key procedural steps and pitfalls that may occur. The last section of each chapter includes what many texts fail to provide: recommendations regarding bailout, rescue, and salvage procedures. When all of these sections are combined as a complete chapter, one has at their fingertips the most concise, contemporary, authoritative “How To” manual of spinal surgery. Spine Surgery: Tricks of the Trade, Second Edition, is a must for all orthopaedic and neurosurgical residents and fellows managing spine patients in their training. It is useful for the practicing spinal surgeon who has been in the community for a number of years and needs an up-to-date reference for his or her library. Robert A. McGuire, Jr., MD Professor and Chairman Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation University of Mississippi Medical Center Jackson, Mississippi\n\nxi\n\nPreface Beginning in 1964 with Lyman Smith’s work of injecting chymopapain into the intervertebral disk for the purpose of hydrolyzing a herniated nucleus pulposus, spine physicians have been developing techniques to minimize the morbidity of spine surgery procedures. This is a noble effort, as minimizing soft tissue or bone surgical invasion theoretically reduces operative time with less potential blood loss while avoiding unnecessary soft tissue trauma. If successful, patients may experience less need for postoperative pain medication, shorter hospital stays, and an expedited return to normal activities. To keep current with these changing times, the authors of Spine Surgery: Tricks of the Trade have decided to write this second edition to incorporate contemporary surgical procedures while preserving topics that emphasize the basic tenets of spinal surgical care. For a second time, we have sought out the most qualified masters of the field for this undertaking. This book has brought together over 80 internationally renowned physicians to provide the most up-to-date guidance on commonly and not so commonly performed spinal procedures. This second edition has been fully revised and updated. There are 81 chapters divided into eighteen sections. Each chapter follows a standard format: (1) a concise description of the procedure and key principles; (2) the expectations of what the surgeon is able to achieve with the procedure; (3) the indications and contraindications for the surgical technique; (4) special considerations and instructions when performing the described surgical procedure; (5) tips, pearls, and lessons learned in order to help minimize any complications or difficulties encountered; (6) key procedural steps; (7) pitfalls associated with the described technique; and (8) available bailout, rescue, and salvage procedures, should they become necessary. This format has been created for ease of use by interested medical students, residents, spine fellows, pain management specialists, and spine surgeons from orthopedic and neurosurgical backgrounds. Each chapter is concise and rich in content, to provide readers interested in spinal care the most important aspects of a specific procedure. Peter M.

Przybylski Description To achieve adequate decompression of the posterior cranial fossa without injury to the neurovascular structures at the craniocervical junction.\n\nKey Principles Bony removal should include sufficient occipital bone and upper cervical lamina to incorporate both the rostral-caudal as well as the lateral extent of pathology while protecting the transverse sinus and vertebral arteries. Dural expansion may be an additional component of decompression of the upper cervical spinal cord and lower medulla.\n\nExpectations Although spinal instability after foramen magnum decompression is not common, excessive lateral decompression in conjunction with disruption of posterior craniocervical ligaments may result in hypermobility of the craniocervical junction. One must be prepared to encounter a vestigial venous sinus within the dural leaves at the foramen magnum.\n\nIndications Chiari malformation, achondroplasia, syringobulbia, basilar invagination, complex C1, C2 fractures.\n\nContraindications Adequate treatment of associated hydrocephalus should be achieved prior to foramen magnum decompression. Similarly, supratentorial masses should be excluded before opening the dura in the infratentorial posterior fossa.\n\nSpecial Considerations Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and craniocervical junction preoperatively is imperative to define the extent of compression. The extent of caudal cerebellar displacement (for Chiari malformation), hydrocephalus, or other supratentorial mass lesions can be detected on MRI. Additionally, the venous sinuses and vertebral artery are visualized on MRI. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be beneficial in gauging the thickness of the keel and bony anatomy when considering instrumentation of the craniocervical junction.\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia The patient is positioned prone with a Mayfield pin head holder. Maintaining the head in a flexed posture facilitates decompression, but may not be appropriate during stabilization procedures. Neurophysiologic monitoring may be used to monitor spinal cord and brainstem function, and arterial monitoring is beneficial in detecting blood pressure lability and bradycardia from brainstem compression.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned Flexion of the neck so that the mandible is two fingerbreadths away from the sternum facilitates separation of the inferior occipital margin of the foramen magnum and the posterior atlas, thereby improving ease of craniocervical ligament dissection from the dura. Extensive flexion of the neck may exacerbate postoperative swallowing or respiratory problems. Although the tentorium cerebelli and the transverse sinus are typically in the same axial plane as the upper third of the ear lobe, patients with hindbrain malformations may have a small posterior fossa and therefore a low-lying transverse sinus. A gross way to identify the transverse sinus is to connect a curved line from the mastoid process to the external occipital protuberance (EOP, or inion). Bony removal should be initiated inferior to these points to avoid sinus injury. Venous sinus bleeding can be controlled by pinching the inner and outer dural leaves together or sometimes by using vascular clips. Subperiosteal dissection along the atlas should be limited to 1.5 cm from the midline of the posterior tubercle of the atlas in adults and 1 cm in children. Dissection beyond this must be performed with extreme\n\n1\n\n2\n\nI Posterior Cervical Decompression caution to avoid injury to the vertebral artery. A large venous plexus is typically encountered at the lateral margin of decompression at the craniocervical junction, signifying proximity to the vertebral arteries.\n\nDifficulties Encountered The midline bony keel is thicker than the paramedian occipital bone. Burr holes on either side of the midline keel at the rostral extent of the craniectomy can facilitate separation of the dura from the inner skull table. Rapid bleeding from the occipital or marginal sinus during dural opening may occur, but can be avoided by surgical clip placement on both sides of the dural opening in advance of the incision. Bleeding from emissary veins during subperiosteal dissection of the occiput may also occur, but can be controlled with bone wax.\n\nKey Procedural Steps Shave and preparation of the skin should extend from above the EOP to the lower cervical spine. A midline incision with subperiosteal dissection provides exposure from the EOP to the predetermined caudal cervical lamina chosen for removal (Fig. 1.1). A Y-shaped incision of the fascia provides for a fascial flap attached to the superior nuchal line, aiding closure. Exposure is maintained with cerebellar retractors. Margins of the foramen magnum are defined with a curette. Preservation of muscular and ligamentous attachments of C2 are recommended if the axis is not removed in the decompression. Typically, a 3 × 3 cm section of occipital bone with the posterior rim of the foramen magnum is removed. A high-speed drill is used to create a craniectomy on either side of the midline bony keel. The dura is dissected from the inner skull table as needed as the bone is gradually lifted away (Fig. 1.2). Additionally, it will be beneficial to thin the midline keel and the foramen magnum with the drill until a thin remnant of bone remains. This thinned bone easily cracks as a curette is then used to lift the isolated occipital bone starting at the foramen magnum away from the posterior fossa. Extreme care should be exercised when placing instruments between the bone and the dura in a compressed foramen magnum. Similarly, narrow troughs can be drilled at the lateral borders of each lamina to be removed until a thin remnant of bone remains. The detached lamina can be lifted away from the spinal canal with a rongeur while a curette is used to separate the underlying dura from the inner laminar surface. Rongeurs can be used to enlarge the lateral extent of decompression if needed. The dura may contain a thickened band at the craniocervical junction that can be released with a curette. Dural expansion can be performed with a midline incision over the cervical region extending bilaterally and diagonally over the posterior fossa dura up to the transverse sinus, forming a Y-shaped opening. Cerebrospinal fluid egress can be prevented by maintaining the integrity of the arachnoid layer. Bleeding from within the dural leaves may be encountered, but can be controlled either with surgical clips or by using bipolar cautery across the inner and outer dural leaves. A dural patch or fascia lata graft can\n\nFig. 1.1 Posterior exposure from the inion to the rostral margin of the C2 spinous process, showing an outline of the occipital and atlas bone removed. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c001_f001\n\nFig. 1.2 Posterior exposure of the dura after bony removal, showing an outline of the Y-shaped dural incision. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c001_f002\n\n1 Foramen Magnum Decompression\n\nPITFALLS • Inadequate decompression, typically laterally or caudally, can result in failure of the surgery to ameliorate neurologic symptoms of craniocervical junction compression. Failure to incise a constricting dural band at the craniocervical junction may also result in inadequate decompression. Rapid substantial bleeding can be encountered if dural venous sinuses are not identified and controlled.\n\nbe sewn to the dural margins with 4–0 suture. Recently, greater success has been noted in dural repair with 6-0 Gore-Tex suture. Additional procedures in treatment of Chiari malformations including resecting the cerebellar tonsils, opening the foramen of Magendie, placing a stent, and plugging the obex remain controversial.\n\nBailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures Copious bleeding from a low-pressure dural venous sinus can be controlled with compression of the inner and outer dural leaves against each other. Laceration of the transverse sinus can be managed by packing the site with a hemostatic agent and tamponade, being careful not to occlude the sinus completely with the packing material. Bleeding from injury to the vertebral artery can be managed with tamponade. If repair cannot be performed, subsequent angiography should be done to determine whether additional future treatment is necessary. Persistent compression at the foramen magnum might necessitate either a lateral transcondylar approach or even an anterior transoral decompression.\n\n3\n\n2 Cervical Laminectomy and Foraminotomy Brian Kwon and David H. Kim Description The removal of compressive bone and soft tissue structures surrounding the cervical spinal cord (laminectomy) or its nerve roots (foraminotomy).\n\nKey Principles Laminectomy is used for expansion of the cervical canal in individuals with symptomatic cervical stenosis. This is typically found in individuals with spondylotic degeneration overlying developmentally narrow canals. Multilevel decompression can be easily accomplished through a simple posterior surgical approach. Foraminotomy can be performed as an independent procedure or in conjunction with laminectomy to address unilateral or bilateral single-level or multilevel foraminal stenosis caused by spondylotic osteophyte formation or soft disk herniations.\n\nExpectations Laminectomy performed for cervical myelopathy typically involves multilevel decompression. Recently laminectomy performed as a stand-alone procedure has fallen out of favor due to the incidence of postoperative kyphosis and recurrent symptoms. In current practice, laminectomy is more commonly performed with concomitant instrumented fusion. Clinical results in patients who are ambulatory preoperatively are generally favorable with most patients experiencing at least partial neurologic recovery. Foraminotomy yields good to excellent relief of arm pain in the majority of patients. Best results have been observed in single-level disease associated with lateral soft disk herniation.\n\nIndications Laminectomy • Multilevel cervical stenosis in a patient with neutral or lordotic sagittal alignment • Cervical spondylotic myelopathy • Previous anterior cervical spine decompression with recurrent myelopathy • Diffuse ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) • Patient anatomy interfering with anterior surgery (e.g., previous anterior neck dissection, obesity, short neck, barrel chest)\n\nForaminotomy • Cervical radiculopathy caused by radiologically identified foraminal stenosis associated with lateral osteophytes or soft disk herniation • Single-level or multilevel disease • Failure of nonsurgical management • Previous anterior cervical decompression with inadequate relief of radiculopathy due to insufficient foraminal decompression\n\nContraindications Laminectomy Kyphotic sagittal alignment.\n\nForaminotomy Medial pathology, i.e., disk herniation or compressive osteophyte, where surgical access may be associated with increased risk of neurological injury.\n\nSpecial Considerations Laminectomy requires lordotic or neutral alignment, measured from the superior end plate of C3 to the inferior end plate of C7 on upright cervical spine films. The number of levels included should be determined by the anatomic distribution of compressive pathology noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) after myelography. Facet resection in excess of 50% during foraminotomy can lead to segmental instability. Preoperative lateral flexion/extension films are recommended to assess for the presence of instability.\n\n4\n\n2 Cervical Laminectomy and Foraminotomy\n\nFig. 2.1 Patient position on operating bed. Bed position should be in 30-degree reverse Trendelenburg, with the foot of the bed flexed 30 degrees to prevent migration of the patient toward the foot of the bed. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c002_f001\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia For both procedures, patients can be positioned prone or seated. The seated position can facilitate surgery by decreasing blood loss, but may risk air embolism. Familiarity with this position is crucial for both surgical and anesthesia staff. The prone position on chest rolls is more widely utilized. The patient’s head can be secured with Mayfield tongs. While the patient is in the prone position, the eyes and nose should be protected and periodically checked. If possible, the head and neck should be placed in the “military position” without flexion or extension and slight posterior translation of the head. The use of neurophysiologic spinal cord monitoring is recommended in the setting of myelopathy. Baseline evoked potential signals should be obtained prior to patient positioning and then rechecked shortly after the patient has been placed in the final operative position. Arms are tucked at the sides. Gentle caudal traction can be placed on the shoulders with tape to help with radiographic visualization of the lower cervical levels, especially in individuals with broad or thick shoulders. Bed position should be in 30-degree reverse Trendelenburg, with the foot of the bed flexed 30 degrees to prevent migration of the patient toward the foot of the bed (Fig. 2.1). Hypotension should be avoided in myelopathic patients.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned In patients with myeloradiculopathy and significant radicular symptoms, the presence of significant foraminal stenosis should be sought on preoperative imaging studies and appropriate concomitant foraminotomies planned. In preoperative positioning, excessive flexion or extension should be avoided in myelopathic patients. For foraminotomies, slight kyphosis opens the interspaces and foramina, but care must be taken during dissection as the dural sac is more susceptible to injury. The surgical exposure for laminectomy proceeds caudal to rostral; this facilitates subperiosteal detachment of paraspinal muscles, which attach in the same direction and reduce bleeding. A clamp is placed on an exposed spinous process and a lateral radiograph is obtained to confirm levels. Dissection should proceed to the lateral margin of the facet joints. This extent of exposure establishes landmarks needed for safe placement of lateral mass screws and ensures that more than half of the facet joint is not removed during any associated foraminotomy. Dissection beyond the lateral margin risks significant bleeding from the soft tissue in this area. Care must be taken not to injure the facet capsules at any level where fusion is not planned.\n\nDifficulties Encountered The epidural venous plexus surrounding the cervical cord can be severely compressed in myelopathic patients. Brisk bleeding can occur from the epidural plexus as well as the venous plexus surrounding the cervical nerve root within the neuroforamen following decompression. Careful bipolar coagulation or use of Surgicel can provide adequate hemostasis. Blind compression or coagulation can lead to serious nerve root or spinal cord injury and should be avoided.\n\nKey Procedural Steps With the neck in neutral position, the ligamentum nuchae is relatively lax and tends to meander from the midline. Maintaining dorsal traction using hooks or retractors can facilitate midline dissection and reduce bleeding. Avoid detaching the muscular insertions from the cephalad border of the C2 spinous process. The cephalad and caudad border of each lamina should be carefully freed of soft tissue. Preparation of screw holes for implant placement should be performed prior to the actual laminectomy to minimize the\n\n5\n\n6\n\nI Posterior Cervical Decompression risk of spinal cord injury. Laminectomy margins should be created 2 mm medial to the junction of the lamina and lateral mass using a 2-mm high-speed burr. This reduces bleeding from epidural vessels localized directly anterior to the junction of the laminae and lateral masses. In the setting of severe stenosis, sublaminar placement of instruments risks injury to the spinal cord and should be avoided. The angle of approach with the burr should be 30 to 45 degrees in the horizontal plane to avoid burring into the lateral mass (Fig. 2.2A,B). A gentle sweeping motion with the burr should be performed to gradually and evenly deepen the laminectomy trough. Once all laminae have been divided they can be removed en bloc by detaching the interspinous ligament and ligamentum flavum with a Kerrison rongeur or knife (Fig. 2.2C). Gentle dorsal traction is maintained on the detached laminae using towel clips on the individual spinous processes. To reduce the risk of postoperative C5 and C6 root palsy, a concomitant C5 and C6 foraminotomy is routinely performed. Once laminectomy has been completed, prior to rod placement, additional restoration of anatomic lordosis can be accomplished by loosening the Mayfield attachment and gently extending the patient’s neck.\n\nA\n\nC\n\nB\n\nFig. 2.2 Laminectomy. (A) Note the multiple levels that can be decompressed as well as the location of the osteotomy. (B) The burr must be directed approximately 30 to 45 degrees in the sagittal plane to avoid burring into the facet joint. Doing this may risk losing one’s orientation and burring too deeply, endangering the dural sac or spinal cord.

An operating microscope or loupe magnification is recommended. Once the level has been confirmed and the facet joint visualized, a 2-mm high-speed burr is used to remove a portion of the laminae and the medial half of the inferior articular process of the cephalad vertebra (Fig. 2.3) initially. The ligamentum is then removed using a fine curette. This leaves a “triangle” of bone representing the superior articular process of the caudal vertebra with any associated\n\n7\n\n8\n\nI Posterior Cervical Decompression\n\nA\n\nB Fig. 2.4 (A) A Kerrison rongeur removing the thinned superior articular process.

Typically a minimum of three or four levels is required to allow adequate cord translation. When performing laminectomy for cervical stenosis, to minimize the risk of iatrogenic cord injury, instruments with taller profiles than the footplate of a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur should not be placed underneath the lamina near the central canal. Postsurgical C5 radiculopathy occurs in 10 to 15% of patients and typically appears between the second and fifth postoperative day. Most spontaneously resolve over 6 to 12 months. • Foraminal decompression risks nerve root injury, especially if high-profile Kerrison rongeurs are placed into the foramen. Air embolus is a rare complication associated with posterior cervical surgery with the patient in the seated position. Occurrence can be monitored using end tidal CO2 sensors. If a significant air embolism is suspected, the patient should undergo immediate electrocauterization of any readily accessible bleeding veins, and the wound should be quickly covered. If a central venous catheter was placed preoperatively, the line can be advanced into the right atrium to attempt evacuation of the air. If this fails, the patient can be placed in the left lateral decubitus position to trap the air in the right atrium.\n\nosteophytes. A diamond-coated burr (with constant saline irrigation) is then used to thin or remove entirely the medial half of the superior articular process. A fine curette or a 1-mm Kerrison can be used to complete the foraminotomy by removing remaining bone and soft tissue overlying the neuroforamen (Fig. 2.4). With severe stenosis resulting from spondylosis, unroofing the neuroforamen with a fine curette is preferable to minimize the risk of iatrogenic nerve root injury. If removal of a soft disk herniation is necessary, a fine nerve hook is used to gently retract the nerve root in the cephalad direction to expose the disk. Care must be taken to retract both rami of the nerve root when present, as the smaller, more anterior and caudally located motor branch can be mistaken for a fragment of disk material (Fig. 2.5).\n\nFig. 2.5 Relationship between cervical nerve roots and articular processes. Note also the proximity between the superior articular process and nerve root. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c002_f005\n\n2 Cervical Laminectomy and Foraminotomy Bailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures If compression remains at C2 after C3 is removed, the ventral portion of C2 can be removed with a burr and Kerrison rongeur while protecting the cervical cord—the dome osteotomy. Progressive postoperative kyphosis can be associated with neck pain and recurrent myelopathy. Typically, this complication occurs when laminectomy is performed without concomitant fusion. Sagittal alignment can be restored by performing multilevel anterior cervical diskectomy and interbody structural graft reconstruction followed by posterior cervical instrumented fusion. Adjacent segment degeneration is a theoretical concern following fusion. To minimize the risk of recurrent symptomatology from adjacent segment disease, fusion should be extended to include adjacent levels when preoperative subluxation or instability is identified. Occasionally, progressive cervicothoracic kyphosis occurs below a previous laminectomy and fusion. This risk may be increased in the setting of preoperative cervicothoracic kyphosis or when the posterior midline tethering ligaments are disrupted. Extension of the fusion to the upper thoracic spine with appropriate instrumentation typically allows restoration of sagittal alignment.\n\n9\n\n3 Laminoplasty Kazuhiro Chiba Description To achieve adequate decompression of the spinal cord and the nerve roots by shifting the laminae posteriorly, yet preserving cervical stability by retaining the posterior bone–ligamentous complex.\n\nKey Principles In addition to the local decompression effect by the posterior shift of the laminae, the total or indirect decompression effect by the posterior migration of the spinal cord away from anterior pathologic structures, such as disk herniation, osteophyte, and ossified ligament, can be expected in this procedure, unless the patient’s cervical alignment is kyphotic. Preserved laminae provide protection to the spinal cord and serve as an attachment to the stripped muscles and preserved ligaments, including the supraspinous, interspinous, and yellow ligaments.\n\nExpectations Relief of myelopathy caused by multilevel compression due to cervical degenerative diseases and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Long-term outcomes of expansive laminoplasty are satisfactory, for example, neurologic improvement assessed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system is approximately 50 to 60%. Adjacent segment disease and nonunion, which are noted after anterior fusions, can be avoided. No postoperative external support is necessary.\n\nIndications Patients with multilevel spinal cord compression due to cervical spondylosis, or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Patients who have developmental spinal stenosis are also good candidates for laminoplasty even if they have single-level disease, such as a disk herniation.\n\nContraindications Preoperatively established severe kyphosis (C2–C7 kyphotic angle over 10 degrees); severely unstable cervical spine, for example, athetoid cerebral palsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and destructive spondyloarthropathy.\n\nSpecial Considerations Careful evaluation of the lateral radiographs to assess for developmental spinal canal stenosis (anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal 25 mm, which could be due to associated temporomandibular joint disease. This is a relative contraindication; these lesions can be approached through a transmandibular approach.\n\nSpecial Considerations • There is a potential for instability after this procedure due to resection of the anterior osseous and ligamentous structures. Although some people do not routinely perform a posterior internal fixation, we recommend posterior arthrodesis as an adjunct to this procedure. • The vertebral arteries are 24 mm from the midline at the arch of C1, 11 mm from the midline at the foramen magnum and at the C2-C3 junction. However, this anatomy could be distorted by pathology or congenital abnormalities. • Patients with irregular dentition may require a gum guard to be fashioned prior to surgery to fit the retractor and the dentition. Edentulous patients may require special adjustments in the retractor to avoid slippage during the procedure.\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia\n\nFig. 19.2 Representation of a preoperative sagittal T2-weighted MRI showing compression of the cervicomedullary junction by the rheumatoid pannus. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c019_f002\n\n• Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography helps plan the procedure by identifying the degree of compression, the anatomy and dominance of the vertebral arteries, and the relationship of the internal carotid arteries to the anterior arch of C1. • Topical hydrocortisone ointment (1%) to the oral cavity before and after surgery reduces significantly the amount of perioral swelling. • Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials should be considered to monitor neural function. • Intraoperative guidance could be achieved by fluoroscopy, intermittent intraoperative x-ray imaging, or image-guidance by intraoperative navigation. • A nasogastric tube helps to prevent postoperative wound contamination. • The endotracheal tube should be left in place for 24 to 48 hours after surgery, or until the surgeon is sure that the airway is not compromised. • Postoperative palatal dehiscence should be immediately closed, whereas late (>1 week) postoperative pharyngeal dehiscence is better left to granulate because of friable edges with diversion of particulate food via the nasogastric tube or gastrostomy. However, direct repair may be attempted in early postoperative pharyngeal dehiscence.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned • If the interdental distance is ≥25 mm with mouth opening, the transoral approach is feasible. • Perioperative antibiotics, usually cephalosporins, are used to decrease the rate of infection. Infection rate is also diminished by protecting the mucosal edges during the surgery to allow the apposition of cleanly incised healthy edges at the end of the procedure, obliterating the dead space by two-layer closure of the posterior pharyngeal wall, and avoidance of particulate food until the wound has healed. • Release of the tongue retractor blade from time to time during the procedure helps to prevent postoperative swelling. The surgeon always needs to avoid catching the tongue between the teeth and the retractor. • Magnification is achieved by surgical loupes, operative microscope, or endoscopy. • The anterior tubercle of atlas with the attached longus colli and anterior longitudinal ligament is an important landmark to the midline. • The lateral exposure should not exceed 2 cm from the midline to avoid injury to the vertebral arteries, hypoglossal nerves, or eustachian tubes. • A freely pulsating dura or soft tissue is a good sign of adequate decompression.\n\nKey Procedural Steps Fiberoptic laryngoscopy with nasotracheal or orotracheal intubation is less hazardous than tracheostomy. However, elective tracheostomy is sometimes indicated, especially with preoperative brainstem dysfunction or persistent postoperative swelling. Lateral position has been used by some surgeons to access both the mouth for decompression and the back for fusion. However, it presents the surgeon with unfamiliar anatomic relationships, both from the front and from the back. The transoral approach is therefore typically performed with the patient in a supine position with the head slightly extended. Head extension moves the dens caudally in the operative field. The head is held either fixed in a Mayfield headrest or without fixation. The mouth and oropharynx are prepared with 1% Betadine or cetrimide. The upper esophagus is packed with a collagen sponge or gauze to minimize the ingestion of blood. A right-handed surgeon stands at the patient’s left side of the head, and anesthesia is placed at the foot of the table. The nurse stands in front of the surgeon to the left of the patient, and the assistant on the right side of the patient (Fig. 19.3). An image intensifier can be brought in and positioned for a lateral view. The operating microscope is placed at the head of the patient. Special retractors are used for better\n\n19 Tr a n s o r a l O d o n t o i d Re s e c t i o n a n d A n t e r i o r O d o n t o i d O s t e o t o my\n\nFig. 19.3 Operative setup, showing the positions of different members of the operative team. The operative microscope is brought in from behind the surgeon (at the head of the patient). 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c019_f003 visualization: Dingman, McIvor, Spetzler-Sonntag, or Crockard self-retaining retractor. The soft palate is retracted and sometimes needs to be divided for better exposure (Fig. 19.4A). If visualization below C2 is necessary, it may be necessary to split the mandible. The posterior pharyngeal wall is infiltrated with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. The posterior pharyngeal mucosa is incised in the midline using the anterior tubercle of atlas as a landmark. The muscles are then elevated from the anterior surface of the clivus, the anterior arch of C1, and the anterior surface of C2. Some surgeons recommend exposing laterally until the medial aspect of the C1-C2 joint is seen. About 14 mm of the anterior arch is removed to expose the dens and pannus (Fig. 19.4B). This is achieved by a high-speed drill\n\nA\n\nB Fig. 19.4 (A,B) Intraoperative views after splitting the uvula (U) and soft palate (SP), and after incision of the posterior pharyngeal wall (P), and resection of the anterior arch of C1, revealing the odontoid process (O) of C2. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c019\n\n67\n\n68\n\nIII Anterior Cervical Decompression\n\nFig. 19.5 Representation of an intraoperative fluoroscopic view of the final part of drilling of the dens. 1 = C1; 2 = C2; 3 = C3. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c019_f005\n\nPITFALLS • Failure to recognize or treat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak could be complicated by meningitis. • The internal carotid artery may have a variable relationship with the anterior arch of C1.\n\nFig. 19.6 Postoperative lateral view after anterior decompression and posterior craniocervical instrumentation. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c019_f006\n\nor Kerrison rongeurs. The odontoid is then resected craniocaudally to avoid spinal cord compression during resection of an amputated odontoid. The major part of the dens is removed using a 3-mm cutting burr, and then the posterior cortical bone is removed using a diamond drill (Fig. 19.5). It is usually hard to differentiate the ligaments from the inflammatory pannus. The osseous pannus and ligaments are dissected from the dural surface to achieve decompression. Bipolar coagulation, nerve hook, 2-mm angled curettes, 1- or 2-mm Kerrison rongeurs, and dissectors are used to aid in the decompression. Resection is continued laterally until the lateral curvature of the dural sac is identified, or the dura is pulsating without osseous compression. Posterior stabilization should then be performed (Fig. 19.6) or the patient is kept in a halo-vest.\n\nBailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures • Inadequate exposure cranially: split the soft palate • Inadequate exposure caudally: split the mandible • Vertebral artery bleeding can be controlled by packing. Bone wax can be used. Venous bleeding can be controlled by Gelfoam, Surgicel, Avitene, or fibrin glue. • Dural tears: we recommend using both fascial autograft (fascia lata), and artificial dural substitutes, with fibrin glue. The dural grafts tend to slide caudally, and they should be stabilized with small clips in the corners. Postoperatively, the patient should be sitting in bed. Lumbar drainage may not be necessary unless postoperative CSF leak is noted.\n\n20 Anterior Open Reduction Technique for Unilateral and Bilateral Facet Dislocations G. Alexander Jones and Edward C. Benzel Description Unilateral or bilateral cervical facet dislocations may be reduced during a ventral fusion and fixation procedure. This technique is arguably safer than closed reduction with traction or manipulation under anesthesia, and, if successful, may eliminate the need for a staged ventral and dorsal procedure.\n\nExpectations Several techniques are described here. They may be safely used to restore anatomic alignment prior to fixation and fusion.\n\nIndications Open reduction is an option as a primary means of reducing cervical facet dislocations. It may also be used in the event that cervical traction is unsuccessful in restoring alignment.\n\nContraindications Care should be taken to perform a complete diskectomy and to take down the posterior longitudinal ligament prior to reduction. If this is not done, the reduction maneuver could cause a fragment of disk or bone to impact the spinal cord during the reduction process, with potentially devastating consequences. It is emphasized that in the case of a severely comminuted facet fracture, an open ventral reduction is less likely to be successful.\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia Uncommonly, the dislocation may prove difficult, if not impossible, to reduce, thus requiring an additional dorsal approach. Radiographic confirmation of the reduction should be obtained prior to placement of a bone graft and plate. This may be accomplished with intraoperative plain radiographs or fluoroscopy. Patients who are not already intubated upon arrival in the operating room should be submitted to an awake fiberoptic intubation to minimize the risk of further neurologic injury. Distraction of the interspace can be accomplished in a controlled manner during the operative procedure. This obviates the need for traction.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned Several techniques may be used for reduction. Caspar distraction pins may be inserted into the vertebral bodies, with the shafts positioned at a divergent angle of 10 to 20 degrees (Fig. 20.1). Bringing the pins into a parallel orientation and placing them in the distracter, followed by controlled distraction, often results in disengagement of the facets (Fig. 20.2). The rostral level is then translated dorsally, occasionally with the application of moderate pressure, to restore alignment. In place of the distracter, the wrenches/pin drivers used for pin application may be left on the pins. This facilitates additional freedom of movement in the coronal plane. Placing a solid object, such as a small bone\n\nFig. 20.1 Placing distraction pins at a 10- to 20-degree angle with respect to each other in the sagittal plane permits the creation of a kyphosis to disengage the facets. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020_f001\n\nFig. 20.2 Slight distraction can also be used to cause the facets to disengage. Dorsal force application to the rostral vertebra assists in reduction of the dislocation. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020_f002\n\n69\n\n70\n\nIII Anterior Cervical Decompression\n\nFig. 20.3 Placing the pins at a 15-degree angle with respect to each other in the coronal plane allows reduction of a rotational deformity when distraction is applied. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020_f003 tamp, between the vertebral bodies ventrally provides a solid fulcrum on which the bending moment may be applied. If osteopenia is a concern, longer pins may be placed with bicortical purchase. In the case of a unilateral dislocation, the distraction pins should be applied with a divergent angle in the coronal plane to allow the rotational deformity to be reduced after distraction (Fig. 20.3). Alternatively, a small curette may be inserted in the interspace and braced against the rostral end plate of the caudal vertebral body. The handle is rotated rostrally while the tip remains stationary. As the motion is begun, the predominance of the resultant force is that of distraction, but as the curette gains a greater angle relative to the end plate, it forces the rostral vertebral body dorsally (Fig. 20.4). Another option involves the use of a vertebral body spreader. Distraction across the disk space is applied first, and then the spreader is rotated in a rostral direction to restore alignment (Fig. 20.5).\n\nKey Procedural Steps A standard anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) approach is used. The importance of a complete, aggressive diskectomy prior to reduction cannot be overemphasized. The posterior longitudinal ligament\n\nA\n\nB Fig. 20.4 (A) A curette (or similar device) can be used to create distraction, followed by (B) dorsal translation of the rostral vertebra, to reduce the deformity. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020\n\n2 0 A n t e r i o r O p e n Re d u c t i o n Te c h n i q u e\n\nA\n\nC\n\nB Fig. 20.5 (A) A disk interspace spreader can be used to reduce deformities by placing the spreader in the disk interspace at an angle. (B) Distraction is then applied to disengage the facet joints, followed by rotation (C) to reduce the deformity. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020_f005\n\nPITFALLS • The dislocation may prove to be difficult to reduce. Therefore, it is best to be armed with several techniques that may be utilized at the time of surgery. • Overdistraction during the reduction process may result in further neurologic injury. Because a flexion-distraction injury with facet dislocation is a threecolumn injury (and therefore inherently unstable), a ventral plate should always be used.\n\nshould be resected across its entire width to facilitate manipulation of the vertebral bodies. Once these steps are complete, the dislocation may be reduced, foraminotomies performed if needed, a bone graft placed, and a plate applied.\n\nBailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures If there is a sagittal plane deformity (kyphosis) at the injured level, the caudal portion of the rostral body may be resected with a high-speed drill to allow access to the disk space (Fig. 20.6).\n\nA Fig. 20.6 (A,B) A dislocation may necessitate the removal of a portion of the ventrocaudal aspect of the rostral vertebral body (shaded area) to visualize the disk interspace, and allow the translation required for reduction of the dislocation. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c020\n\nB\n\n71\n\nIV\n\nANTERIOR CERVICAL ARTHRODESIS AND INSTRUMENTATION\n\n21 Odontoid Screw Placement Darrel S. Brodke Description Reduction and fixation of a type II or high type III odontoid fracture with a precisely placed lag/compression screw.\n\nKey Principles Anatomic alignment at the fracture site by initial positioning or intraoperative reduction is vital to the success of this procedure. The lag screw must be able to glide through the vertebral body and firmly purchase the odontoid fragment to gain firm compression at the fracture edges.\n\nExpectations Screw fixation of the odontoid fracture should significantly improve fracture-healing rates over those treated in halo-vest immobilization, and avoid the limitations of a primary C1-C2 fusion, with associated loss of motion.\n\nIndications Patients with acute or subacute (less than 6 months old) type II or high type III odontoid fractures, particularly those at higher risk of pseudarthrosis, are ideal for this technique.\n\nContraindications • Fractures older than 6 months • Reverse (anterior) oblique fracture line, angling from posterior rostral to anterior caudal (Fig. 21.1) • Significant osteoporosis or fracture comminution • Inability to gain anatomic reduction • Inability to gain appropriate screw placement, due to body habitus (barrel chest) or associated disease process (ankylosing spondylitis)\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nFig. 21.1 A reverse (anterior) oblique fracture, not amenable to odontoid screw fixation. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c021_f001\n\nPatients older than 50 years of age, with fractures displaced greater than 4 to 5 mm, have the highest rate of nonunion with halo fixation. They should be considered for immediate odontoid screw fixation. Likewise, younger patients with high-risk lifestyles and elderly patients who may poorly tolerate 3 months in a halo vest may be considered for immediate fixation. Those patients who do undergo 3 months in a halo and have persistent motion at the fracture site may still heal with screw fixation. Although there is often some loss of motion following odontoid fracture treatment by any means, the motion remains better than with C1-C2 fusion, which is associated with a 50% loss of rotation of the neck.\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia The patient should be positioned supine on the operating table with the head in traction. This can be accomplished with the Mayfield three-pin head-holder, Gardner-Wells tongs, and a pad under the head and between the shoulder blades, or with halter traction. The arms may be gently taped down to the sides with mild traction, though the shoulders rarely block visualization. If the endotracheal tube can be positioned off to the side in the mouth, this will allow improved visualization of the odontoid in the anteroposterior (AP) plane.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned • Get as close to anatomic reduction as possible prior to the prep and drape. This can be accomplished by adjusting the height of the head on towels or foam, or by placing towels under the shoulder blades. Both rotation of the neck and forward translation of the head, as compared with the chest, may be required to reduce the fracture and allow access for screw placement. • Use biplane fluoroscopy to obtain quick AP and lateral views of the odontoid throughout the procedure (Fig. 21.2). A bight block, wad of gauze, or a wine cork with cutouts for the teeth may be used to hold open the mouth, improving AP visualization.\n\n73\n\n74\n\nIV Anterior Cervical Arthrodesis and Instrumentation\n\nFig. 21.2 Intraoperative positioning with biplane fluoroscopy. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c021_f002\n\n• Ensure access to the screw trajectory above the chest, and confirm on the lateral fluoroscopy view prior to prep and drape (Fig. 21.3). • Approach through a C5-C6 level skin incision (on the right for a right-handed surgeon). • Enter the C2 body at the C2-C3 disk, under the anterior edge of the body. This may require removing a small amount of the C3 body anteriorly, as well as some of the C2-C3 disk annulus, to get the correct trajectory. • Further reduction may be achieved by using a radiolucent retractor that also enables the assistant to place anterior to posterior pressure on either the C2 vertebral body or the odontoid fragment.\n\nDifficulties Encountered Patient body habitus or position may inhibit access to the proper trajectory for screw placement. If the chest is barrel shaped, the drill will not be able to get low enough. If the neck has a fixed flexed position, the proper screw placement is also blocked. Fracture pattern may inhibit screw fixation. If the fracture has a reverse oblique orientation, angling from posterior rostral to anterior caudal (Fig. 21.1), attempts at fracture compression will cause loss of reduction. Inability to obtain fracture site compression will lead to a higher rate of failure. Additional difficulties may be encountered if there is poor fluoroscopic visualization. Taking the time to ensure good AP and lateral fluoroscopic views before beginning the procedure is a key element to success.\n\nKey Procedural Steps Following intubation and placement of cranial traction, the C-arms are positioned for perfect AP and lateral views of the odontoid. The head and neck are then positioned for anatomic alignment of the fracture. This may require both rotation and translation of the head. The screw trajectory is then checked on the lateral view with a Kirschner wire (K-wire) laid alongside the neck, to ensure that the sternum is cleared and the screw can be placed appropriately. The neck is prepped for a right-sided anterior approach at the C5-C6 level. A standard anterior approach to the cervical spine is performed, between the midline structures and the carotid sheath. Once down between the longus colli muscles, blunt dissection is continued up to the C2 vertebral body, and a radiolucent retractor is used to allow an AP fluoroscopic view. The C3 vertebral body is notched and the anterior annulus of the C2-C3 disk is removed in midline. A guidewire or drill is advanced through the undersurface of the anterior-inferior corner of the C2 body. Under AP fluoroscopic control, the drill is advanced up through the C2 body, aiming for the midpoint of the odontoid tip. The lateral view is used to confirm a trajectory aimed up through the midportion of the odontoid to the tip. The drill is advanced to the fracture site. If the fracture is well reduced, the drill is advanced across, into the proximal fragment, then slowly and carefully through the tip of the odontoid, feeling the change in bone density as the cortex is met and then penetrated. If reduction is required, this is performed before advancing the drill. A decision is now made to place either a partially threaded or a fully threaded screw. The partially threaded screw is a natural lag screw, allowing compression at the fracture site. A fully threaded screw requires overdrilling of the body fragment to become a lag screw and allow compression. If a partially threaded screw is to be used, the length is measured off of a depth gauge or the drill. The odontoid fragment is tapped and\n\n21 Odontoid Screw Placement\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD Fig. 21.3 (A–D) Odontoid screw placement requires neck extension and occasionally some forward translation, so that the screw trajectory is anterior to the chest wall. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c021\n\nPITFALLS • Malreduction of the odontoid fracture prevents fracture site compression and adequate stability. Re-displacement or pseudarthrosis are likely to occur. • Significant osteoporosis, comminution at the fracture site, or failure to gain purchase on the cortical bone at the tip of the odontoid fragment also prevents compression and diminishes stability. • Incorrect starting position can lead to poor screw position and fixation or re-displacement of the fracture. • A guidewire may be used to gain and hold initial position and over-drill. If there is a slight bend in the guidewire, as the drill is advanced it will bind the wire and advance it out through the tip of the odontoid.\n\nthe screw is placed, gaining purchase on the cortical tip. If a fully threaded screw is to be used, the C2 body is overdrilled with a drill the same size as the outer diameter of the screw and advanced up to the fracture sight. The odontoid fragment is then tapped and the screw advanced up through the tip of the odontoid, obtaining purchase on the cortex. As the screw is then advanced, the head of the screw contacts the base of C2, the tip achieves purchase on the proximal fragment, pulling it distally, and the fracture edges are compressed.\n\nBailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures During initial setup and fracture reduction, increasing or decreasing the amount of traction may help. Just before drilling the odontoid fragment, further reduction can be obtained with help from the anesthesiologist with anterior to posterior pressure through the mouth on the anterior ring of C1, or posterior to anterior pressure from underneath. If the fracture is high in the odontoid, the threads of a partially threaded screw may cross the fracture preventing compression. Either cutting the tip of the screw to shorten, or use of a fully threaded screw with overdrilling to the fracture site prevents this problem. If problems occur before or during the procedure, it may be necessary to abandon attempts at fixation of the fracture and switch to a primary C1-C2 posterior fusion.\n\n75\n\n22 Anterior C1, C2 Arthrodesis: Lateral Approach of Barbour and Whitesides Eli M. Baron, Alexander R. Vaccaro, and Peter M. Fleischut Description The lateral retropharyngeal approach to the upper cervical spine was developed by Kelly and Whitesides as an alternative approach to the anterior cervical spine, avoiding the complexities of anterior extrapharyngeal approaches, which require an approach medial to the carotid sheath or dislocation of the mandible. This approach is actually done posterior to the carotid sheath, avoiding branches of the carotid artery and the facial nerve. Additionally, the approach allows access from C1 to T1 and avoids the potentially higher morbidity of a transoral/transpalatal approach.\n\nExpectations To perform a stand-alone C1-C2 anterior arthrodesis via a bilateral lateral approach.\n\nIndications Instability at C1-C2 requiring anterior fixation or when an anterior approach is required for a diagnosis. The approach is advantageous over a transoral approach where fixation is necessary for instability and a posterior approach is contraindicated (presence of posterior infection or incompetent posterior elements). It also may be useful as a salvage technique following failed posterior arthrodesis.\n\nContraindications • Vertebral artery injury • Local infection • Inexperience with regional anatomy\n\nSpecial Instructions, Position, and Anesthesia The patient is placed in the supine position. Fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation is preferred in cases of significant instability. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring, including somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial motor evoked potentials, if available, is used during positioning and throughout the procedure. Dental occlusion should be maintained to keep the angle of the mandible from limiting the area of dissection. Biplanar fluoroscopy or frameless stereotaxy may be useful during guidewire insertion, drilling, and screw placement to ensure proper instrumentation placement while limiting the risk of neurovascular injury. For positioning, if not contraindicated, the neck should be rotated to the opposite side and extended as much as possible. The ear lobe can be sewn anteriorly to the cheek to facilitate exposure of the field. Postoperative prophylactic tracheostomy should be considered in cases where there is significant retropharyngeal dissection. Performance of the tracheostomy after the procedure is usually more convenient.\n\nTips, Pearls, and Lessons Learned Preoperative imaging and planning are essential prior to performing the procedure. This includes computed tomography (CT) imaging for studying bony anatomy and estimating screw length. CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are useful noninvasive modalities for assessing the position and patency of the vertebral arteries.\n\nDifficulties Encountered • Avoid the parotid gland, which may be seen superficially at the cranial end of the incision. Dissection into the gland may result in facial nerve injury or parotid fistula. Also, deep at the cephalad end of the incision lies the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Care should be taken to avoid retraction against this muscle to minimize risk of injury to the facial nerve, which lies between the digastric muscle and the base of the skull. • Excessive medial retraction on the nasopharynx may result in mucosal laceration and subsequent contamination of the field. • Excessive retraction may contribute to postoperative dysphagia and possible cranial nerve injury, including the hypoglossal and superior laryngeal nerve. • Excessive retraction on the spinal accessory nerve should be avoided to minimize risk of sternocleidomastoid or trapezius weakness.\n\nKey Procedural Steps A hockey-stick incision is made from the tip of the mastoid process and taken distally along the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Fig. 22.1). The greater auricular nerve is identified as it crosses the\n\n76\n\n2 2 A n te r i o r C 1, C 2 A r t h r o d e s i s\n\nFig. 22.1 Hockey-stick incision (dotted line) used for the lateral approach to the upper cervical spine. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c022_f001 sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissected proximally and distally to increase its laxity, facilitating retraction. If needed, it may be divided with a resultant small sensory deficit around the ear. The external jugular vein is also ligated and divided. The platysma is then divided in line with the prior incision, followed by division of the deep cervical fascia investing the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is detached from the mastoid process. This is done by dividing it transversely as it inserts onto the mastoid process, and then everting it. The spinal accessory nerve is then identified, approximately 3 cm from the tip of the mastoid process. The nerve should then be protected. The internal jugular vein is then identified in the carotid sheath and dissected from the spinal accessory nerve for greater mobilization. The sternomastoid branch of the occipital artery is located next, distal to the spinal accessory nerve and is ligated. Both the spinal accessory nerves and the internal jugular veins are dissected proximally to the digastric muscle. The dissection then continues posterior and lateral to the carotid sheath and medial to the spinal accessory nerve and sternocleidomastoid muscles (Fig. 22.2).\n\nA\n\nB Fig. 22.2 (A) Lateral approach to the upper cervical spine.

The retropharyngeal space is then accessed with blunt dissection, which is further used to clear the prevertebral fascia. The C1 arch is easily located by palpation based on the prominence of its transversely oriented anterior arch. C2 has a prominent vertical ridge at its base. A subperiosteal dissection of C1 and C2 is then performed where the longus colli and longus capitis muscles are stripped laterally. The longus colli muscle may be detached from its origin on the anterior surface of C1-C2 to maximize exposure. The intertransverse membrane at C1-C2 should be preserved. The approach and dissection is then repeated on the contralateral side. Subsequently the facets are exposed through blunt dissection. A small cutting burr and cervical curettes are used to denude the C1-C2 articulation, and the joint space is packed with autogenous iliac crest bone graft. Afterward, screw fixation is performed. A 2-mm guidewire is placed at the anterior base of the C1 transverse process, aiming 25 degrees from superolateral to inferomedially in the coronal plane and 10 degrees posteriorly in the sagittal plane. At the starting point, the guidewire should be in line with the ipsilateral mastoid process. Biplanar fluoroscopy should confirm wire placement. Drilling is then performed with a cannulated drill, first using a 2.7-mm cannulated drill bit over the guidewire followed by a 3.5-mm cannulated drill bit that is taken through only the C1 lateral mass for a lag technique. The procedure is then repeated on the contralateral side. A 3.5-mm tap is used, followed by a 3.5 × 26 mm cannulated screw, in the average adult. Preoperative CT measurements, however, are essential in estimating appropriate screw length (Fig. 22.3). Meticulous hemostasis is obtained, followed by reapproximation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the periosteum overlying the mastoid process. A drain should then be placed followed by closure of the platysma and skin. At this point prophylactic tracheostomy should strongly be considered. Postoperatively the patient should be maintained in a Philadelphia collar.\n\nBailout, Rescue, Salvage Procedures The definitive salvage procedure for a failed C1-C2 anterior arthrodesis is a posterior occipitocervical arthrodesis. Should a vertebral artery injury occur, packing with Gelfoam or Surgicel should be done for tamponade, and intraoperative neurovascular consultation should be obtained. The contralateral procedure should be aborted.\n\n23 Anterior Cervical Plating: Static and Dynamic Wade K. Jensen and Paul A. Anderson Description Anterior cervical plating provides stabilization of the cervical spine after arthrodesis. Theoretical advantages of plate fixation include improved initial stability, decreased complications from bone graft dislocation, end-plate fracture, and late kyphotic collapse. Whether anterior cervical plates result in higher fusion success is controversial, although recent reports confirm the efficacy of one- and two-level fusions. Modern plates have the capacity of screw capture, thereby preventing loosening, and require only unilateral screw purchase. Plate systems can be static or dynamic. Static plates have a rigid connection between screw and plate and do not allow motion during healing. Dynamic plates allow change in plate position to accommodate changes in the interbody graft that occurs following implantation.\n\nKey Principles During healing of interbody cervical fusions graft, resorption of 1 to 2 mm per interspace occurs. Theoretically, plates may unload the graft or shield it from stress, and may lead to nonunion or plate failure. This is seen more commonly in longer fusion. Cervical spine plates are classified as follows: (1) unrestricted backout, and (2) constrained (static) and semiconstrained plates that include two subclasses of (a) rotational and (b) translational. Unrestricted backout plates are of historical note. These were nonlocked, required bicortical screw purchase, and were associated with screw backout. They are therefore not currently recommended. The constrained or static plates are locked screw interface that allow unicortical fixation without screw backout (Fig. 23.1). Dynamic or semiconstrained plates have been developed that allow axial settling to accommodate a potential biologic or mechanical shortening of the anterior strut graft (Fig. 23.2). Rotational plates allow rotation or toggle at the plate–screw interface. The translational plates offer locked bone–screw interfaces with the ability to translate along the long axis to accommodate shortening (Fig. 23.3). Several mechanisms are available including plates that have oval holes allowing translation through the holes, whereas others have screws fixed to the plate and translation occurs by plate shortening. Anterior cervical plates are load-sharing devices that require a graft or other interbody device. Cadaveric biomechanical load transmissions through the graft were found to be higher with a dynamic (68–80%) versus static plate (53–57%). This was accentuated when the graft was undersized (dynamic 50–57% versus static 17%). Therefore, one may hypothesize that a dynamic plate will lead to high union rates when the graft is appropriately loaded. The lack of load sharing over time in static plates may lead to hardware fatigue or loosening. Still unknown, however, is the critical amount of load sharing to allow bony union. What is\n\nFig. 23.1 Placement of a statically locked plate. 10.1055/978-1-60406-159-8c023_f001\n\n79\n\n80\n\nIV Anterior Cervical Arthrodesis and Instrumentation\n\nFig. 23."
