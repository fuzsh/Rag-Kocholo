Those original Softdisk game titles are now being open-sourced under the GPL.\n\nThe original Softdisk games created by the id Software founders are now owned by Flat Rock Software. Flat Rock Software has decided to go ahead and open-source these old classics. Among the games with their sources out there are TheCatacomb, Catacomb3D, Catacomb, and Hovertank3D.\n\nThese classic id game titles are now GPL'ed and available freely via FlatRockSoft's GitHub and was confirmed by John Carmack. As with other id Software source releases, the engine is open-sourced under the GPLv2 but the game data still requires having a licensed copy of the content.\n\nThe original Catacomb was written in Borland Turbo Pascal 5.5 while at least Hovertank3D and the newer Catacombs are written in C++.\n\nHere's a video for those unfamiliar with Hovertank 3D followed by the 1990 hit Catacomb:\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 20,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.
