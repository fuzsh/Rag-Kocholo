        "text": "Many who drove down I-20 yesterday past Industrial Drive witnessed a crazy sight. A semi-truck plowed straight through Greg Tilley's Mobile Home's dealership and straight into a home. From the sight of the house, this one looks like one that was on track to be delivered any day now.\n\nAll I can think about is the phone call someone got telling them the home they thought was being delivered to them had a slight hiccup.\n\nI spoke to a friend of mine who sells mobile homes and modular homes and he claims that many homes are taking as long as a year to be built and delivered. The thought of hearing that the home you were so excited about being railed by a semi-truck just stresses me out.\n\nWhat caused the semi-truck to derail?\n\nThere was a police report and I tried to dig up some information but unfortunately, we don't have much information to go off of right now. What I did notice is there weren't any tire marks indicating that the driver of the semi-truck hit the brakes. Did they fall asleep? Did they not realize that they had slid off the road into a field? The worst part about all of this are the mobile homes that were damaged since they are in such short supply due to issues that started during the pandemic lockdown.\n\nThe Top 5 Speed Traps in Louisiana\n\nTop Stories in Shreveport for 2021 So Far\n\nLOOK: Here are the 50 best beach towns in America\n\nEvery beach town has its share of pluses and minuses, which got us thinking about what makes a beach town the best one to live in. To find out, Stacker consulted data from WalletHub, released June 17, 2020, that compares U.S. beach towns. Ratings are based on six categories: affordability, weather, safety, economy, education and health, and quality of life. The cities ranged in population from 10,000 to 150,000, but they had to have at least one local beach listed on TripAdvisor. Read the full methodology here. From those rankings, we selected the top 50. Readers who live in California and Florida will be unsurprised to learn that many of towns featured here are in one of those two states.\n\nKeep reading to see if your favorite beach town made the cut.\n\nLOOK: The most expensive weather and climate disasters in recent decades\n\nStacker ranked the most expensive climate disasters by the billions since 1980 by the total cost of all damages, adjusted for inflation, based on 2021 data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The list starts with Hurricane Sally, which caused $7.3 billion in damages in 2020, and ends with a devastating 2005 hurricane that caused $170 billion in damage and killed at least 1,833 people.
