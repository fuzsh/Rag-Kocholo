Vendor Information\n\nSubject: 1. General Information\n\nMany FAQs, including this one, are available by anonymous ftp from\n\nrtfm.mit.edu in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers. Each posted\n\nsection of the FAQ is archived under the name that appears in the\n\n\"Archive-name\" header at the top of the article.\n\nThis FAQ is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions, I would be\n\ndelighted to hear them.\n\nThis FAQ is maintained in TeXinfo format. A Perl script constructs the\n\npostable FAQ from the TeXinfo sources. TeX DVI, PostScript, and Info\n\nversions of this FAQ are available from ftp.shsu.edu in\n\n/tex-archive/help/comp-fonts-FAQ. A \"Gopher\" server is also maintained\n\nat shsu.edu which can provide interactive access to the FAQ.\n\nThe posted version of the FAQ is organized in a quasi-digest format so\n\nthat it is easy to find the questions you are interested in. All\n\nquestions that appear in the table of contents can be found by searching\n\nfor the word \"Subject:\" followed by the question number.\n\nThe \"TeXinfo\" distribution from the Free Software Foundation contains a\n\nprogram called \"Info\" that can be used to read the Info version of the\n\nFAQ in a hypertext manner. The \"TeXinfo\" distribution can be obtained\n\nfrom prep.ai.mit.edu in the /pub/gnu directory. At the time of this\n\nwriting, texinfo-2.16.tar.gz is the most recent version. Info files\n\ncan also be read in hypertext form by GNU Emacs.\n\nFuture versions of the FAQ will make more use of the hypertext\n\ncapabilities provided by the Info format. At present, the FAQ is\n\norganized as a simple tree. A plain ASCII, postable version of the FAQ\n\nwill always be maintained.\n\nAll trademarks used in this document are the trademarks of their\n\nrespective owners.\n\nStandard disclaimers apply.\n\nSubject: 1.1. Font Houses\n\nThis section will be expanded on in the future. It contains notes about\n\nvarious commercial font houses.\n\nCompugraphic\n\n============\n\nSee \"Miles, Agfa Division\"\n\nMiles, Agfa Division\n\n====================\n\nCompugraphic which was for a while the Compugraphic division of Agfa,\n\nis now calling itself \"Miles, Agfa Division\" (yes, the Miles drug\n\ncompany), since CG's off-shore parent Agfa has been absorbed by Miles.\n\nSo typographically speaking, Compugraphic, CG, Agfa, A-G ag, and Miles\n\nall refer to the same company and font library. Their proprietary fonts\n\nare still CG Xyz, but the name is Miles Agfa.\n\nSubject: 1.2. What's the difference between all these font formats?\n\nThis question is not trivial to answer. It's analogous to asking what\n\nthe difference is between various graphics image file formats. The\n\nshort, somewhat pragmatic answer, is simply that they are different\n\nways of representing the same \"information\" and some of them will work\n\nwith your software/printer and others won't.\n\nAt one level, there are two major sorts of fonts: bitmapped and outline\n\n(scalable). Bitmapped fonts are falling out of fashion as various\n\noutline technologies grow in popularity and support.\n\nBitmapped fonts represent each character as a rectangular grid of\n\npixels. The bitmap for each character indicates precisely what pixels\n\nshould be on and off. Printing a bitmapped character is simply a\n\nmatter of blasting the right bits out to the printer. There are a\n\nnumber of disadvantages to this approach. The bitmap represents a\n\nparticular instance of the character at a particular size and\n\nresolution. It is very difficult to change the size, shape, or\n\nresolution of a bitmapped character without significant loss of quality\n\nin the image. On the other hand, it's easy to do things like shading\n\nand filling with bitmapped characters.\n\nOutline fonts represent each character mathematically as a series of\n\nlines, curves, and 'hints'. When a character from an outline font is\n\nto be printed, it must be 'rasterized' into a bitmap \"on the fly\".\n\nPostScript printers, for example, do this in the print engine. If the\n\n\"engine\" in the output device cannot do the rasterizing, some front end\n\nhas to do it first. Many of the disadvantages that are inherent in the\n\nbitmapped format are not present in outline fonts at all. Because an\n\noutline font is represented mathematically, it can be drawn at any\n\nreasonable size. At small sizes, the font renderer is guided by the\n\n'hints' in the font; at very small sizes, particularly on\n\nlow-resolution output devices such as screens, automatically scaled\n\nfonts become unreadable, and hand-tuned bitmaps are a better choice (if\n\nthey are available). Additionally, because it is rasterized \"on\n\ndemand,\" the font can be adjusted for different resolutions and 'aspect\n\nratios'.\n\nWerenfried Spit adds the following remark:\n\nWell designed fonts are not scalable. I.e. a well designed 5pt font is\n\nnot simply its 10pt counterpart 50% scaled down. (One can verify this\n\nby blowing up some small print in a copier and compare it with large\n\nprint; or see the example for computer modern in D.E. Knuth's TeXbook.)\n\nAlthough this fact has no direct implications for any of the two\n\nmethods of font representation it has an indirect one: users and word\n\nprocessor designers tend to blow up their 10pt fonts to 20pt or scale\n\nthem down to 5pt given this possibility. Subtle details, but well...\n\nLaserJet .SFP and .SFL files, TeX PK, PXL, and GF files, Macintosh\n\nScreen Fonts, and GEM .GFX files are all examples of bitmapped font\n\nformats.\n\nPostScript Type 1, Type 3, and Type 5 fonts, Nimbus Q fonts, TrueType\n\nfonts, Sun F3, MetaFont .mf files, and LaserJet .SFS files are all\n\nexamples of outline font formats.\n\nNeither of these lists is even close to being exhaustive.\n\nTo complicate the issue further, identical formats on different\n\nplatforms are not necessarily the same. For example Type 1 fonts on\n\nthe Macintosh are not directly usable under MS-DOS or Unix, and\n\nvice-versa.\n\nIt has been pointed out that the following description shows signs of\n\nits age (for example, the eexec encryption has been thoroughly hacked).\n\nI don't dispute the observation and I encourage anyone with the\n\nknowledge and time to submit a more up to date description.\n\nIt has further been suggested that this commentary is biased toward\n\nKingsley/ATF. The omission of details about Bitstream (and possibly\n\nBauer) may be considered serious since their software lies inside many\n\n3rd-party PostScript interpreters.\n\nThe moderators of this FAQ would gladly accept other descriptions/\n\nexplanations/viewpoints on the issues discussed in this (and every\n\nother) section.\n\n[Ed Note: Liam R. E. Quin supplied many changes to the following\n\nsection in an attempt to bring it up to date. Hopefully it is a better\n\nreflection of the state of the world today (12/07/92) than it was in\n\nearlier FAQs]\n\nHenry Schneiker <reachable electronically?> wrote the following\n\ndescription of the differences between several scalable font\n\ntechnologies:\n\n((( semi-quote )))\n\nThere has been a lot of confusion about font technologies in recent\n\ntimes, especially when it comes to Type 1 versus Type 3 fonts, \"hints,\"\n\nPostScript compatibility, encryption, character regularizing, kerning,\n\nand the like.\n\n* Encryption (eexec)\n\nAll fonts produced with Adobe's font technology are protected\n\nthrough data encryption. The decryption is provided by the `eexec'\n\n(encrypted execute) PostScript operator and, until recently, was\n\nonly present in Adobe's licensed PostScript.\n\nAdobe has published the details of the Type 1 font format in the\n\n`Black Book', Adobe Type 1 Font Format (version 1.1), Adobe\n\nSystems Inc., 1990. The encryption was mainly used because of\n\nfont copyright problems; unencrypted fonts can also be used, but\n\nthese tend to use an efficient binary encoding, also in documented\n\nthe Type 1 book, and so are still not readable PostScript.\n\n* Type 1, Type 3, and Type 5 font formats\n\nThere are generally three font formats used in Adobe PostScript\n\nprinters: Type 1, Type 3, and Type 5. Type 1 fonts are Adobe's\n\ndownloadable format. Type 3 fonts are third-party downloadable\n\nformat. Type 5 fonts are the ROM-based fonts that are part of your\n\nprinter.\n\nThere is no functional difference between a Type 1, Type 3, or\n\nType 5 font. A Type 3 font can do anything a Type 1 or Type 5 font\n\ncan do. The only real difference between them is where the\n\n`BuildChar' routine comes from. For Type 1 and Type 5 fonts it's\n\nbuilt into the printer. For Type 3 fonts it's built into the font.\n\nIn other words, anything a Type 1 font can do a Type 3 font can\n\nalso do.\n\n[Ed note: the reverse is not true. Type3 fonts can do things that\n\nType1 fonts cannot. But they aren't hinted...]\n\nWhen PostScript is asked to generate a character, PostScript looks\n\nin the font's dictionary for FontType. If FontType is 1 or 5\n\nPostScript executes an internal routine that knows how to\n\ninterpret the font data stored in CharStrings. If FontType is 3\n\nPostScript executes the routine BuildChar from the font's\n\ndictionary to interpret the font data (often stored in\n\nCharStrings).\n\nHowever, each BuildChar routine is written to read data formatted\n\nin a method convenient to the vendor. Adobe, Altsys, Bitstream, and\n\nKingsley/ATF all format their font data differently and, hence,\n\nhave different BuildChar routines.\n\n[Ed note: relative hard disk efficiency of Kingsley vs. Adobe fonts\n\ndeleted on 12/07/92]\n\nType 5 fonts are special in that they often include hand-tuned\n\nbitmaps for the commonly used sizes, such as 10- and 12-point.\n\nOther sizes are generated from the outlines in normal fashion.\n\nDon't confuse Type 1, Type 3, and Type 5 fonts with Bitstream's\n\nType A, Type B, Type C, and Type F. They are not the same and\n\nserve only to confuse the issue.\n\n* Resolution `hints'\n\nWhen a character is described in outline format the outline has\n\nunlimited resolution. If you make it ten times as big, it is just\n\nas accurate as if it were ten times as small.\n\nHowever, to be of use, we must transfer the character outline to a\n\nsheet of paper through a device called a raster image processor\n\n(RIP). The RIP builds the image of the character out of lots of\n\nlittle squares called picture elements (pixels).\n\nThe problem is, a pixel has physical size and can be printed only\n\nas either black or white. Look at a sheet of graph paper. Rows and\n\ncolumns of little squares (think: pixels). Draw a large `O' in the\n\nmiddle of the graph paper. Darken in all the squares touched by the\n\nO. Do the darkened squares form a letter that looks like the O you\n\ndrew? This is the problem with low resolution (300 dpi). Which\n\npixels do you turn on and which do you leave off to most accurately\n\nreproduce the character?\n\nAll methods of hinting strive to fit (map) the outline of a\n\ncharacter onto the pixel grid and produce the most\n\npleasing/recognizable character no matter how coarse the grid is.\n\n[Ed note: deleted some paragraphs that are no longer true. Times\n\nchange...]\n\n* Optical Scaling\n\nOptical Scaling modifies the relative shape of a character to\n\ncompensate for the visual effects of changing a character's size.\n\nAs a character gets smaller, the relative thickness of strokes,\n\nthe size of serifs, the width of the character, the\n\ninter-character spacing, and inter-line spacing should increase.\n\nConversely, as a character gets larger, the relative thickness,\n\nwidths, and spacing should decrease.\n\nContrast this with linear scaling, in which all parts of a\n\ncharacter get larger or smaller at the same rate, making large\n\ncharacters look wide and heavy (strokes are too thick, serifs are\n\ntoo big) while small characters look thin and weak.\n\n* Kerning\n\nAs applied to PostScript fonts, kerning refers to kern pairs. A\n\nkern pair specifies two characters (e.g., A and V) and the\n\ndistance to move the second character relative to the first. The\n\ntypical use of a kern pair is to remove excessive space between a\n\npair of characters. However, it may also be used to add space.\n\n* PostScript clones\n\nThere are currently several printer manufacturers on the market\n\nwith PostScript clones. To be viable, a PostScript clone must\n\ncomply with the `red book' (PS Language Reference Manual).\n\nIn order to avoid paying royalties to Adobe, and because Adobe's\n\nType 1 font format was originally proprietary, many PostScript\n\ninterpreters use some other font format. Sun uses F3, and some\n\nother vendors use Bitstream's Speedo format, for example. The\n\nonly real problem this causes is that the widths of characters\n\n(the `font metrics') may vary from Adobe's, so that programs that\n\nassume the Adobe character widths will produce poor quality\n\noutput. Bitstream fonts used to be particularly bad in the early\n\ndays, but they and most or all of the other vendors have solved\n\nthose problems.\n\n* Apple TrueType [Ed note: formerly \"Royal (`sfnt')\"] format and\n\nSystem 7\n\nApple's new System 7.0 supports a new format of outline font that\n\nwill allow high-quality characters of any size to be displayed on\n\nthe screen. TrueType stores font outlines as B-spline curves\n\nalong with programmed resolution hints. B-spline curves are faster\n\nto compute and easier to manipulate than the Bezier curves used in\n\nPostScript.\n\nAdobe is not going to support Apple's new format by converting the\n\nAdobe/Linotype library to B-spline format. There are two reasons\n\nfor this: First, there is no support for font encryption (yes, the\n\nhooks are there, but nothing is implemented). Second, Adobe does\n\nnot want to dilute PostScript and its font library. However, the\n\nMacintosh is too big a market to simply turn away from. Therefore,\n\nAdobe will provide its Font Manager to display its own fonts on\n\nthe Mac screen. Apple ships Adobe's ATM for this purpose.\n\n((( unquote )))\n\nSubject: 1.3. What about \"Multiple Master\" fonts?\n\nMultiple Master Fonts are an extension to the Adobe font format.\n\nproviding the ability to interpolate smoothly between several \"design\n\naxes\" from a single font. Design axes can include weight, size, and\n\neven some whacko notions like serif to sans serif. Adobes' first\n\nMultiple Master Font was Myriad - a two-axis font with WEIGHT (light to\n\nblack) on one axis, and WIDTH (condensed to expanded) along the other\n\naxis. In the case of Myriad, there are four \"polar\" designs at the\n\n\"corners\" of the design space. The four designs are light condensed,\n\nblack condensed, light expanded, and black expanded.\n\nGiven polar designs, you can set up a \"weight vector\" which\n\ninterpolates to any point within the design space to produce a unique\n\nfont for a specific purpose. So you can get a \"more or less condensed,\n\nsomewhat black face\".\n\nMultiple Master Fonts can be used on any PostScript printer. Multiple\n\nMaster Fonts need a new PostScript operator known as makeblendedfont.\n\nThe current crop of Multiple Master Fonts supply an emulation of this\n\noperator so the printer doesn't need this operator.\n\nA short tutorial on Multiple Master Fonts and makeblendedfont appears\n\nin PostScript by Example, by Henry McGilton and Mary Campione,\n\npublished by Addison-Wesley.\n\nDanny Thomas contributes that there are a few PostScript interpreter\n\n(version)s which have bugs that appear with the emulation of the\n\nmakeblendedfont operator used to support Multiple Master fonts. There\n\nweren't many exhibiting this problem, though it may have happened even\n\nwith one Adobe interpreter.\n\nSubject: 1.4. Is there a methodology to describe and classify typefaces?\n\nThere is a standard, Panose, but it is mostly ignored by typographers\n\n(not because it's bad, just because they don't need it). The Panose\n\nsystem is documented, among other places, in the Microsoft Windows 3.1\n\nProgrammer's Reference from Microsoft Press.\n\nThe ISO also has a scheme, but it is not Panose.\n\nAt least one book by a respected authority, Alexander Lawson, Printing\n\nTypes: An Introduction, describes another, less rigorous system [ed: of\n\nhis own], which is exposited in \"An Introduction\" and used without\n\nexposition in his later \"Anatomy of a Typeface\".\n\nThere is another book, Rookledges International Typefinder, which has a\n\nvery complete system that uses tell-tales of individual glyphs as well\n\nas overall style to index most known faces right in the book.\n\nJ. Ben Leiberman has another book on type face description.\n\nTerry O'Donnell adds the following comments:\n\nThe current ISO system was initiated (I believe) by Archie Provan of\n\nRIT--a successor to Mr. Lawson. Whereas in typographic practice or\n\nteaching--only a high level classification is necessary - times have\n\nchanged and the current ISO system aims to accomplish something beyond\n\nthe high level. A major goal is to aid software to help users make\n\nselections. For example, a naive user might ask for all fonts on a font\n\nserver which have a Roman old style appearance. Another goal would be\n\nto help users with multi-lingual text: a user creating a document in\n\nEnglish using e.g. Baskerville wants to know what Arabic or Japanese\n\nlanguage font on his system/file server would harmonize well with the\n\nBaskerville. It is not all in place yet--but the more detailed ISO\n\nclasses--and the current addition of non-latin typefaces--are an\n\nattempt to address this issue.\n\nA second goal is to help with the font substitution problem. Neither\n\nISO or Panose address the metrics issues in font substitution--but both\n\nmight aid software in picking the nearest style of available available\n\nfonts.\n\nSubject: 1.5. What is the \"f\" shaped \"s\" called?\n\nBoth the \"f\" with half a crosbar (roman) and the integral sign (italic)\n\nare called long-S.\n\nSubject: 1.6. What about \"Colonial\" Typefaces?\n\nWhy does colonial printing have that \"Colonial\" feel?\n\n=====================================================\n\nColonial type was either very roughly treated by moist salt air on the\n\ncrossing and in colonial port cities, or was copied locally by tacky\n\ntechniques (such as driving used foundry type into soft lead to make\n\nvery soft deformable matrices), and the paper was very rough, which\n\nabrades both the serifs and the hairlines. So except for the best work\n\ndone with new, european types, the serifs were much smaller, even\n\nbroken off, than the original founder/punchcutter intended.

And what about free or cheap faces like this?\n\nI don't know if any exist with all of 1-5. As I believe you get what\n\nyou pay for, especially in fonts, I haven't looked at free and\n\ncheap-copy fonts.\n\nMicrosoft's expansion set for their Win3.1 optional fonts has Garamond\n\nExpert & Expert Extensions, which has a good complement of ligatures\n\nand I think I remember it having the long ess too. I forget about\n\nOSFigs; it should tho'.

How can I convert my ... font to ... format?\n\nConversion from one bitmapped format to another is not generally too\n\ndifficult. Conversion from one scalable format to another is very\n\ndifficult. Several commercial software packages claim to perform these\n\ntasks, but none has been favorably reviewed by the comp.fonts\n\ncommunity. ATech's AllType program, in particular, has had poor\n\nreviews [ed: as of 7/92].\n\nIn an effort to settle a long-running and oft-asked question, I'll be\n\nblunt: as of today [6/93], THERE ARE NO NON-COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS WHICH\n\nWILL CONVERT FROM ONE SCALABLE FORMAT TO ANOTHER. Not from TrueType to\n\nPostScript Type 1, Type 3, Type 5, or any other scalable PostScript\n\nformat. Not from PostScript Type 1 to TrueType. Not to or from\n\nIntellifont. Not to or from Sun F3 format.\n\nThere are some commercial programs: AllType, Metamorphosis, Font\n\nMonger, and even MoreFonts (to/from some proprietary format, I\n\nbelieve). And there are probably other commercial programs as well.\n\nHowever, as several people have noted, conversion from one scalable\n\nformat to another is a bad idea.

Terry\n\nCarroll. provides the following analysis of current [ed: as of 6/92]\n\nlegislation and regulation regarding fonts and copyrights in the United\n\nStates. Terry is \"Editor in Chief\" of Volume 10 of the Santa Clara\n\nComputer and High Technology Law Journal. Members of the comp.fonts\n\ncommunity are encouraged to submit other materials that add clarity to\n\nthe issue.\n\nIt has been pointed out that this section deals primarily font copyright\n\nissues relevant to the United States and that this situation is not\n\nuniversal. For example, in many parts of Europe typeface designs are\n\nprotectable.\n\n\"First, the short answer in the USA: Typefaces are not copyrightable;\n\nbitmapped fonts are not copyrightable, but scalable fonts are\n\ncopyrightable. Authorities for these conclusions follow.\n\nBefore we get started, let's get some terminology down:\n\nA typeface is a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters,\n\nwhose forms are related by repeating design elements consistently\n\napplied in a notational system and are intended to be embodied in\n\narticles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing\n\ntext or other cognizable combinations of characters.\n\nA font is the computer file or program that is used to represent or\n\ncreate the typeface.\n\nNow, on to the legal authorities:\n\nVolume 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations specifies this about the\n\ncopyrightability of typefaces:\n\n\"The following are examples of works not subject to copyright and\n\napplications for registration of such works cannot be entertained: . . .\n\ntypeface as typeface\" 37 CFR 202.1(e).\n\nThe regulation is in accordance with the House of Representatives report\n\nthat accompanied the new copyright law, when it was passed in 1976:\n\n\"The Committee has considered, but chosen to defer, the possibility of\n\nprotecting the design of typefaces. A 'typeface' can be defined as a\n\nset of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are\n\nrelated by repeating design elements consistently applied in a\n\nnotational system and are intended to be embodied in articles whose\n\nintrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other\n\ncognizable combinations of characters. The Committee does not regard\n\nthe design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable\n\n'pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work' within the meaning of this bill\n\nand the application of the dividing line in section 101.\" H.

If anyone knows of a reason why I shouldn't include\n\nit, please let me know. norm 2/93]\n\nPreamble\n\n========\n\nThe main question of typeface protection is: Is there anything there\n\nworth protecting? To that the answer must certainly be: Yes.\n\nTypeface designs are a form of artistic and intellectual property. To\n\nunderstand this better, it is helpful to look at who designs type, and\n\nwhat the task requires.\n\nWho Makes Type Designs?\n\n=======================\n\nLike other artistic forms, type is created by skilled artisans. They\n\nmay be called type designers, lettering artists, punch-cutters,\n\ncalligraphers, or related terms, depending on the milieu in which the\n\ndesigner works and the technology used for making the designs or for\n\nproducing the type.\n\nType designer and lettering artist are self-explanatory terms. Punch-\n\ncutter refers to the traditional craft of cutting the master image of a\n\ntypographic letter at the actual size on a blank of steel that is then\n\nused to make the matrix from which metal type is cast. Punch-cutting\n\nis an obsolete though not quite extinct craft. Seeking a link to the\n\ntradition, modern makers of digital type sometimes use the\n\nanachronistic term digital punch- cutter. Calligrapher means literally\n\none who makes beautiful marks. The particular marks are usually\n\nhand-written letters, though calligraphers may design type, and type\n\ndesigners may do calligraphy.\n\nIt usually takes about seven years of study and practice to become a\n\ncompetent type designer. This seems to be true whether one has a Phd.\n\nin computer science, an art-school diploma, or no academic degree. The\n\nskill is acquired through study of the visual forms and practice in\n\nmaking them. As with geometry, there is no royal road.\n\nThe designing of a typeface can require several months to several years.\n\nA family of typefaces of four different styles, say roman, italic, bold\n\nroman, and bold italic, is a major investment of time and effort. Most\n\ntype designers work as individuals. A few work in partnership (Times\n\nRoman(R), Helvetica(R), and Lucida(R) were all, in different ways, the\n\nresult of design collaboration.) In Japan, the large character sets\n\nrequired for a typeface containing Kanji, Katakana, and Hirakana induce\n\ndesigners to work in teams of several people.\n\nAlthough comparisons with other media can only be approximate, a\n\ntypeface family is an accomplishment on the order of a novel, a feature\n\nfilm screenplay, a computer language design and implementation, a major\n\nmusical composition, a monumental sculpture, or other artistic or\n\ntechnical endeavors that consume a year or more of intensive creative\n\neffort. These other creative activities can be protected by copyright\n\nor other forms of intellectual property protection. It is reasonable\n\nto protect typefaces in the same way.\n\nThe Problem of Plagiarism\n\n=========================\n\nA lack of protection for typeface designs leads to plagiarism, piracy,\n\nand related deplorable activities. They are deplorable because they\n\nharm a broad range of people beyond the original designers of the type.\n\nFirst, most type plagiarisms are badly done. The plagiarists do not\n\nunderstand the nature of the designs they are imitating, are unwiling\n\nto spend the necessary time and effort to do good work, and\n\nconsequently botch the job. They then try to fob off their junk on\n\nunsuspecting users (authors, editors, and readers). Without copyright,\n\nthe original designer cannot require the reproducer of a type to do a\n\ngood job of reproduction. Hence, type quality is degraded by\n\nunauthorized copying.\n\nSecondly, without protection, designs may be freely imitated; the\n\nplagiarist robs the original designer of financial compensation for the\n\nwork. This discourages creative designers from entering and working in\n\nthe field. As the needs of typography change (on-line documents and\n\nlaser printing are examples of technical and conceptual changes) new\n\nkinds of typefaces are required. Creative design in response to such\n\nneeds cannot flourish without some kind of encouragement for the\n\ncreators. In a capitalist society, the common method is property\n\nrights and profit. In a socialist (or, in the past, royalist) society,\n\nthe state itself might employ type artists. France, as a monarchy and\n\nas a republic has had occasional state sponsorship of typeface design\n\nover the past 400 years. The Soviet Union has sponsored the design of\n\nnew typefaces, not only in the Cyrillic alphabet, but also in the other\n\nexotic scripts used by various national groups in the Soviet Union.\n\nThose who would justify plagiarism often claim that the type artists do\n\nnot usually receive a fair share of royalties anyway, since they have\n\nusually sold their designs to some large, exploitive corporation. It\n\nis true that type designers, like many artists, are often exploited by\n\ntheir publishers, but plagiarism exacerbates the problem. Plagiarism\n\ndeprives the designer of decent revenues because it diverts profits to\n\nthose who merely copied the designs. Plagiarism gives the manufacturer\n\nyet another excuse to reduce the basic royalty or other fee paid for\n\ntypeface designs; the theme song is that the market determines the\n\nvalue of the design and cheap rip-offs debase the market value of a\n\nface. For those interested in the economic effects of piracy, it is\n\nclear that plagiarism of type designs ultimately hurts individual\n\nartists far more than it hurts impersonal corporations.\n\nKinds of Protection for Type\n\n============================\n\nThere are five main forms of protection for typefaces:\n\n* Trademark\n\n* Copyright\n\n* Patent\n\n* Trade Secret\n\n* Ethics\n\nTrademark\n\n---------\n\nA trademark protects the name of a typeface. In the U.S., most\n\ntrademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe R in a circle (R) after a trademark or tradename indicates U.S.\n\nregistration. The similarly placed TM indicates that a trademark is\n\nclaimed, even if not yet officially registered. However, a trademark\n\nmay be achieved through use and practice, even without registration.\n\nOwners of trademarks maintain ownership by use of the trademark and by\n\nlitigation to prevent infringement or unauthorized use of the trademark\n\nby others.\n\nAs a few examples of registered typeface trademarks, there are Times\n\nRoman (U.S. registration 417,439, October 30, 1945 to Eltra\n\nCorporation, now part of Allied); Helvetica (U.S. Registration\n\n825,989, March 21, 1967, also to Eltra-Allied), and Lucida (U.S. reg.\n\n1,314,574 to Bigelow & Holmes). Most countries offer trademark\n\nregistration and protection, and it is common for a typeface name to be\n\nregistered in many countries. In some cases the registrant may be\n\ndifferent than the originator. For example, The Times New Roman (Times\n\nRoman) was originally produced by the English Monotype Corporation. In\n\nEngland and Europe, most typographers consider the design to belong to\n\nMonotype but the trademark was registered by Linotype (Eltra-Allied) in\n\nthe U.S., as noted above.\n\nTrademark protection does not protect the design, only the name.\n\nTherefore, a plagiarism of a design is usually christened with a\n\npseudonym that in some way resembles or suggests the original\n\ntrademark, without actually infringing on it. Resemblance without\n\ninfringement can be a fine distinction.\n\nSome pseudonyms for Times Roman are: English Times, London, Press\n\nRoman, Tms Rmn. Some for Helvetica are Helios, Geneva, Megaron,\n\nTriumvirate. So far, there seem to be none for Lucida. There are\n\ngeneric typeface classifications used by typographers and type\n\nhistorians to discuss styles, trends, and categories of design.\n\nOccasionally these apparently innocuous classification systems are\n\nemployed by plagiarists to devise generic pseudonyms, such as Swiss 721\n\nfor Helvetica, and Dutch 801 for Times Roman. It is not certain whether\n\nthis usage of a generic classification is more for clarification or for\n\nobfuscation. In general, the proper tradename is a better indicator of\n\nidentity, quality, and provenience in typefaces than a generic name.\n\nSome people believe that the same is true for other commodities such as\n\nwine, where taste is important.\n\nA trademark usually consists of both a proprietary and a generic part.\n\nFor example, in the name Lucida Bold Italic, Lucida is the proprietary\n\ntrademark part and Bold Italic is the generic part. The generic word\n\ntype is usually understood to be a part of the name, e.g. Lucida Bold\n\nItalic type. Sometimes a firm will append its name or a trademarked\n\nabbreviation of it to the typeface name, to achieve a greater degree of\n\nproprietary content, e.g. B&H Lucida Bold Italic.\n\nA related matter is the use of the name of a type's designer. A firm\n\nthat ethically licenses a typeface will often cite the name of the\n\ndesigner - e.g. Stanley Morison (with Victor Lardent) for Times Roman,\n\nMax Miedinger (with Edouard Hoffmann) for Helvetica, Charles Bigelow\n\nand Kris Holmes for Lucida. Although a person's name is not usually a\n\nregistered trademark, there are common law restrictions on its use.\n\nThe marketing of plagiarized type designs generally omits the names of\n\nthe designers.\n\nAlthough Trademark is an incomplete kind of protection, it is used\n\neffectively (within its limitations) to prevent the theft of type names.\n\nCertain traditional typeface names, usually the surnames of illustrious\n\ndesigners like Garamond, Caslon, Baskerville, Bodoni, and others have\n\nbecome generic names in the public domain. Trademark protection of\n\nsuch names requires the addition of some proprietary word(s), as with\n\nthese hypothetical creations, Acme New Garamond, or Typoluxe\n\nMeta-Baskerville.\n\nCopyright\n\n---------\n\nCopyright of typefaces can be divided into two parts: copyright of the\n\ndesign itself; and copyright of the font in which the design is\n\nimplemented. In the U.S., typeface designs are currently not covered\n\nby copyright. This is a result of reluctance by the copyright office\n\nto deal with a complex field; by lobbying against copyright by certain\n\nmanufacturers whose profits were based on typeface plagiarism; and by a\n\nreluctance of congress to deal with the complex issue in the recent\n\nrevision of the copyright law.\n\nThe reluctance of Americans to press for typeface copyright may have\n\nbeen influenced by a feeling that typeface plagiarism was good for U.S.\n\nhigh-tech businesses who were inventing new technologies for printing,\n\nand plagiarizing types of foreign origin (Europe and England). If the\n\nsituation becomes reversed, and foreign competition (from Japan,\n\nTaiwan, and Korea) threatens to overcome American technological\n\nsuperiority in the laser printer industry, then American firms may do\n\nan about-face and seek the protection of typeface copyright to help\n\nprotect the domestic printer industry. Such a trend may already be\n\nseen in the licensing of typeface trademarks by Adobe, Hewlett Packard,\n\nIBM, Imagen, and Xerox in the U.S. laser printer industry.\n\nIn Germany, where typeface design has always been a significant part of\n\nthe cultural heritage, and where typefounding has remained an important\n\nbusiness, there are more than one kind of copyright-like protections for\n\ntypefaces. Certain long-standing industrial design protection laws\n\nhave been used to protect typeface designs in litigation over royalties\n\nand plagiarisms. Further, there is a recent law, the so-called\n\nSchriftzeichengesetz enacted in 1981, that specifically protects\n\ntypeface designs. New designs are registered, as is done with\n\ncopyright in most countries. This law only protects new, original\n\ndesigns. It is available to non-German designers and firms.\n\nTherefore, some type firms and designers routinely copyright new\n\ndesigns in West Germany. This gives a degree of protection for products\n\nmarketed in Germany. Since multinational corporations may find it\n\ncheaper to license a design for world-wide use rather than deal with a\n\nspecial case in one country, the German law does encourage licensing on\n\na broader scale than would initially seem to be the case.\n\nFrance, like Germany, has ratified an international treaty for\n\nprotection of typefaces. This 1973 Vienna treaty will become\n\ninternational law when four nations ratify it. So far, only France and\n\nWest Germany have done so, and thus a design must be protected\n\nseparately in each country. Even when the treaty becomes law, it will\n\ntake effect only in those countries that have ratified it. The treaty\n\nwas principally the work of the late Charles Peignot, a French\n\ntypefounder, and John Dreyfus, an English typographer and typographic\n\nscholar. Presently, typefaces may be registered for protection in\n\nFrance under a 19th century industrial design protection law.\n\nIn the U.S., there continues to be some movement for typeface design\n\nprotection. A proposed bill that would protect the designs of useful\n\narticles, like type, has been in committee for several years. It seems\n\nto be going nowhere.\n\nDigital (as opposed to analog) fonts may be protected by copyright of\n\ndigital data and of computer programs. It has been established that\n\ncomputer software is copyrightable. Therefore, software that embodies\n\na typeface, e.g. a digital font, is presumably also protected. There\n\nis some objection to this kind of copyright, on the grounds that the\n\nultimate output of the program or the result of the data (i.e. a\n\ntypeface design) is not copyrightable. However, the current belief\n\nexpressed by the National Commission on New Technological Use of\n\nCopyrighted Works is that software is copyrightable even if its\n\nfunction is to produce ultimately a non-copyrightable work. Hence,\n\ntypefaces produced by Metafont or PostScript(R), two computer languages\n\nwhich represent fonts as programs, are presumably copyrightable.\n\nTypefaces represented as bit-map data, run-length codes, spline\n\noutlines, and other digital data formats, may also be copyrightable.\n\nSome firms do copyright digital fonts as digital data.\n\nNote that the designs themselves are still not protected in the U.S. A\n\nplagiarist could print out large sized letters (say, one per page) on\n\nan Apple LaserWriter, using a copyrighted PostScript digital font, and\n\nthen redigitize those letters by using a scanner or a font digitizing\n\nprogram and thus produce a new digital font without having copied the\n\nprogram or digital data, and thus without infringing the copyright on\n\nthe font. The quality of the imitation font would probably be awful,\n\nbut it wouldn't violate copyright. Of course, the plagiarist would\n\nneed to rename the font to evade trademark infringement. (As I write\n\nthese words, I have the guilty feeling that I have just provided a\n\nrecipe for type rip-off, but others have obviously thought of just such\n\na scheme - John Dvorak has even proposed something like it in one of his\n\ncolumns.)\n\nDesign Patent\n\n-------------\n\nThe designs of typefaces may be patented in the U.S. under existing\n\ndesign patent law. Many designs are patented, but type designers\n\ngenerally don't like the patent process because it is slow, expensive,\n\nand uncertain. Nevertheless, some type do get patented, and it is a\n\nform of potential protection. Note that this is Design Patent - the\n\ntypeface doesn't have to be a gizmo that does something, it merely has\n\nto be unlike any previous typeface. The drawback here is that most\n\nattorneys and judges are not aware that there are more than two or\n\nthree typefaces: say, handwriting, printing, and maybe blackletter.\n\nTherefore, litigating against infringement is an educational as well as\n\na legal process. It is easy to see that typeface theft is more subtle\n\nthan knocking over a liquor store; it may not be illegal and the\n\nreturns may be greater.\n\nProtections like design patent are available in many other countries,\n\nbut there is not an international standard (to my knowledge) so the\n\nsituation must be examined on a country by country basis.\n\nInvention Patent\n\n----------------\n\nMethods of rendering typefaces can be patented as mechanical or\n\nelectronic inventions. For example, the old hot-metal Linotype\n\nmachinery was protected by various patents, as was the IBM Selectric\n\ntypewriter and type ball. IBM neglected to trademark the typeface\n\nnames like Courier and Prestige, so once the patents had elapsed, the\n\nnames gradually fell into the public domain without IBM doing anything\n\nabout it (at the time, and for a dozen years or so, IBM was distracted\n\nby a major U.S. anti-trust suit). Most students of the type protection\n\nfield believe that those names are probably unprotectable by now,\n\nthough IBM could still presumably make a try for it if sufficiently\n\nmotivated.\n\nThere is currently a noteworthy development regarding a patent for\n\noutline representation of digital type as arcs and vectors, with special\n\nhardware for decoding into rasters. This patent (U.S. 4,029,947, June\n\n14, 1977; reissue 30,679, July 14, 1981) is usually called the Evans &\n\nCaswell patent, after its inventors. It was originally assigned to\n\nRockwell, and in 1982, Rockwell sued Allied Linotype for infringement.\n\nAllied settled out of court, having paid an amount rumored to be in the\n\nmillions. Rockwell sold the patent, along with other typographic\n\ntechnology, to Information Internation, Inc. (III) which then sued\n\nCompugraphic for infringement. According to the Seybold Report, a\n\nrespected typographic industry journal, Compugraphic recently settled\n\nout of court for $5 million. Although many experts believe the patent\n\nto be invalid because of several prior inventions similar in concept,\n\nit nevertheless seems to be a money-maker in corporate litigation. The\n\nSeybold Report has speculated on which firms III would litigate against\n\nnext. Among the candidates suggested by the Seybolds was Apple for its\n\nLaserWriter, which uses outline fonts. Since the entire laser printer\n\nindustry and the typesetting industry is moving toward outline font\n\nrepresentation, Apple is certainly not alone. The Seybolds further\n\nspeculate on whether the difference between character-by-character CRT\n\ntypesetting and raster-scan laser typesetting and printing would be\n\nlegally significant in such as case. Ultimately, some firm will hold\n\nout for a court judgement, and the matter will be decided.\n\nTrade Secret\n\n------------\n\nGiven that typeface designs have relatively little copyright protection\n\nin the U.S., they are often handled as trade secrets. The secret must\n\napply to the digital data or programs only, because the images\n\nthemselves are ultimately revealed to the public as printed forms. It\n\nis much more difficult to reconstruct the formula of Coca-Cola from its\n\ntaste than it is to reconstruct the design of Helvetica from its look\n\non the page. The exact bitmap or spline outline of a digital font is\n\nusually not reconstructable from the printed image, although CRT screen\n\nfonts at usual resolutions (60-120 dots per inch) may be reconstructed\n\nby patient counting and mapping of bits off a screen display. Typeface\n\nlicenses often contain stipulations that the digital data will be\n\nencrypted and confidential. Just as a firm will protect the secret of a\n\nsoft drink recipe, so a type firm will protect the exact nature of its\n\ndigital data.\n\nEthics\n\n------\n\nSome typographers are motivated by higher principles than greed, profit,\n\nexpediency, and personal interest. Idealists enthused with concepts of\n\nethical behavior and a vision of typography as a noble art may find it\n\ndistasteful to use plagiarized types. Some graphic designers insist on\n\nusing typefaces with bona-fide trademarks, both to ensure that the type\n\nwill be of high quality, and to encourage creativity and ethics in the\n\nprofession. A consequence of plagiarism that is sometimes overlooked\n\nis a general erosion of ethics in an industry. If it is okay to steal\n\ntypeface designs, then it may be okay to purloin other kinds of data,\n\nto falsify one's resume, to misrepresent a product, and so forth. Most\n\nprofessional design organizations attempt to promote ethical standards\n\nof professional behavior, and personal standards may extend to\n\navoidance of plagiarisms.\n\nATypI\n\n-----\n\nThe Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) is an international\n\norganization of type designers, type manufacturers, and letterform\n\neducators. Its purpose is to promote ethical behavior in the industry,\n\nadvancement of typographic education, communication among designers,\n\nand other lofty aims. Members of ATypI agree to abide by a moral code\n\nthat restricts plagiarism and other forms of depraved behavior\n\n(pertaining to typography). These are noble goals, but some members\n\n(especially corporate members) of ATypI, confronted with the pressures\n\nand opportunities of commercial reality, nevertheless plagiarize\n\ntypefaces of fellow members, the moral code notwithstanding. Since\n\nATypI is a voluntary organization, there is very little that can be\n\ndone about most such plagiarism. Some years back, a world-famous type\n\ndesigner resigned from the ATypI Board of Directors in protest over the\n\norganization's flaccid attitude toward the plagiarists among its ranks.\n\nHe has since agreed to sit on the board again, but criticism of the\n\norganization's inability to prevent type rip-offs by its own members,\n\nnot to mention by non-members, continues to be heard. Moderates in\n\nATypI believe that a few morals are better than none. It is not clear\n\nwhether their philosophical stance derives from Plato, Hobbes, or\n\nRousseau.\n\nGiven the general attitude of the public toward copyrighted video and\n\nsoftware, it is doubtful that ethical considerations will hinder most\n\nend- users' attitude to plagiarized type fonts. A desire to have the\n\nfashionable label or trademark may be a greater motivation toward the\n\nuse of bona-fide fonts than an ethical consideration.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n---------------\n\nThe State of the Art in Typeface Design Protection, Edward Gottschall,\n\nVisible Language, Vol. XIX, No. 1, 1985.

File Formats\n\nMany different kinds of files are available on the net. These files\n\ncontain many different kinds of data for many different architectures.\n\nFrequently, the extension (trailing end) of a filename gives a good\n\nclue as to the format of its contents and the architecture that it was\n\ncreated on.\n\nIn order to save space, most files on the net are compressed in one way\n\nor another. Many compression/decompression programs exist on multiple\n\narchitectures.\n\nMultiple files and directories are often combined into a single\n\n`archive' file. Many archive formats perform compression automatically.\n\nFile Format Extensions\n\n======================\n\n* .tar\n\nUnix `tape archive' format. Tar files can contain multiple files\n\nand directories. Unlike most archiving programs, tar files are\n\nheld together in a wrapper but are not automatically compressed by\n\ntar.\n\n* .Z\n\nUnix `compress' format. Compression doesn't form a wrapper around\n\nmultiple files, it simply compresses a single file. As a result,\n\nyou will frequently see files with the extension .tar.Z. This\n\nimplies that the files are compressed tar archives.\n\n* .z .gz\n\nGNU zip format. GNU zip doesn't form a wrapper around multiple\n\nfiles, it simply compresses a single file. As a result, you will\n\nfrequently see files with the extension .tar.z or .tar.gz. This\n\nimplies that the files are compressed tar archives. Do not confuse\n\nGNU Zip and PKZip or GNU Zip and Unix compress, those are three\n\ndifferent programs!\n\n* .hqx\n\nMacintosh `BinHex' format. In order to reliably transfer Mac files\n\nfrom one architecture to another, they are BinHex encoded. This\n\nis actually an ascii file containing mostly hexadecimal digits.\n\nIt is neither a compression program nor an archive wrapper.\n\n* .sit\n\nMacintosh `Stuffit' archive.\n\n* .cpt\n\nMacintosh `Compactor' archive.\n\nLike the .tar.Z format that is common among Unix archives,\n\nMacintosh archives frequently have the extensions .sit.hqx or\n\n.cpt.hqx indicating a BinHex'ed archive.\n\n* .arc\n\nPC `arc' archive. This is an older standard (in PC terms, at\n\nleast) and has gone out of fashion.\n\n* .zip\n\nPC `zip' archive. This is the most common PC archive format today.\n\n* .arj\n\nPC `arj' archive.\n\n* .zoo\n\nPC `zoo' archive\n\n* .lzh\n\nPC `lha/lharc' archive.\n\nFont Formats\n\n============\n\nJust as the are many, many archive formats, there are many different\n\nfont formats. The characteristics of some of these formats are\n\ndiscussed below. Once again, the file extension may help you to\n\ndetermine the font type. (On the Mac, the resource TYPE field is\n\n(probably) a better indicator).\n\n* PostScript Type 1 Fonts:\n\nPostscript Type 1 fonts (Also called ATM (Adobe Type Manager)\n\nfonts, Type 1, and outline fonts) contains information, in outline\n\nform, that allows a postscript printer, or ATM to generate fonts\n\nof any size. Most also contain hinting information which allows\n\nfonts to be rendered more readable at lower resolutions and small\n\ntype sizes.\n\n* PostScript Type 3 Fonts:\n\nPostscript type 3 fonts are an old outline font format that is not\n\ncompatible with ATM. Most developers have stopped using this\n\nformat except in a few special cases, where special type 3\n\ncharacteristics (pattern fills inside outlines, for example) have\n\nbeen used.\n\n* TrueType Fonts:\n\nTruetype fonts are a new font format developed by Microsoft with\n\nApple. The rendering engine for this font is built into system 7\n\nand an init, the Truetype init, is available for system 6 (freeware\n\nfrom Apple). It is also built into MS Windows v3.1. Like\n\nPostScript Type 1 and Type 3 fonts, it is also an outline font\n\nformat that allows both the screen, and printers, to scale fonts to\n\ndisplay them in any size.\n\n* Bitmap Fonts:\n\nBitmap fonts contain bitmaps of fonts in them. This a picture of\n\nthe font at a specific size that has been optimized to look good\n\nat that size. It cannot be scaled bigger without making it look\n\nhorrendously ugly. On the Macintosh, bitmap fonts also contain\n\nthe kerning information for a font and must be installed with both\n\ntype 1 and type 3 fonts. Their presence also speeds the display\n\nof commonly used font sizes.\n\nFont Format Extensions\n\n======================\n\n* .afm\n\nAdobe Type 1 metric information in `ascii' format (human parsable)\n\n* .bco\n\nBitstream compressed outline\n\n* .bdf\n\nAdobe's Bitmap Distribution Format. This format can be converted\n\nto the platform specific binary files required by the local X\n\nWindows server. This is a bitmap font format distributed in ASCII.\n\n* .bez\n\nBezier outline information\n\n* .chr\n\nBorland stroked font file\n\n* .ff, .f3b, .fb\n\nSun formats. More info when I know more...\n\n* .fot\n\nMS-Windows TrueType format fonts\n\n* .gf\n\nGeneric font (the output of TeX's MetaFont program (possibly\n\nothers?))\n\n* .fli\n\nFont libraries produced by emTeX fontlib program. Used by emTeX\n\ndrivers and newer versions of dvips.\n\n* .mf\n\nTeX MetaFont font file (text file of MetaFont commands)\n\n* .pfa\n\nAdobe Type 1 Postscript font in ASCII format (PC/Unix) I believe\n\nthat this format is suitable for directly downloading to your\n\nPostScript printer (someone correct me if I'm wrong ;-)\n\n* .pfb\n\nAdobe Type 1 PostScript font in \"binary`' format (PC/Unix) Note:\n\nthis format is not suitable for downloading directly to your\n\nPostScript printer. There are utilities for conversion between\n\nPFB and PFA (see the utilities section of the FAQ).\n\n* .pfm\n\nPrinter font metric information in Windows format\n\n* .pk\n\nTeX packed bitmap font file (also seen as .###pk where ### is a\n\nnumber)\n\n* .pl\n\nTeX `property list' file (a human readable version of .tfm)\n\n* .ps\n\nFrequently, any PostScript file. With respect to fonts, probably\n\na Type3 font. This designation is much less `standard' than the\n\nothers.

Ligatures\n\nA ligature occurs where two or more letterforms are written or printed\n\nas a unit. Generally, ligatures replace characters that occur next to\n\neach other when they share common components. Ligatures are a subset\n\nof a more general class of figures called \"contextual forms.\"\n\nContextual forms describe the case where the particular shape of a\n\nletter depends on its context (surrounding letters, whether or not it's\n\nat the end of a line, etc.).\n\nOne of the most common ligatures is \"fi\". Since the dot above a\n\nlowercase 'I' interferes with the loop on the lowercase 'F', when 'f'\n\nand 'i' are printed next to each other, they are combined into a single\n\nfigure with the dot absorbed into the 'f'.\n\nAn example of a more general contextual form is the greek lowercase\n\nsigma. When typesetting greek, the selection of which 'sigma' to use\n\nis determined by whether or not the letter occurs at the end of the\n\nword (i.e., the final position in the word).\n\n* Amanda Walker provides the following discussion of ligatures:\n\nLigatures were originally used by medieval scribes to conserve\n\nspace and increase writing speed. A 14th century manuscript, for\n\nexample, will include hundreds of ligatures (this is also where\n\n\"accents\" came from). Early typefaces used ligatures in order to\n\nemulate the appearance of hand-lettered manuscripts. As\n\ntypesetting became more automated, most of these ligatures fell\n\nout of common use. It is only recently that computer based\n\ntypesetting has encouraged people to start using them again\n\n(although 'fine art' printers have used them all along).\n\nGenerally, ligatures work best in typefaces which are derived from\n\ncalligraphic letterforms. Also useful are contextual forms, such\n\nas swash capitals, terminal characters, and so on.\n\nA good example of a computer typeface with a rich set of ligatures\n\nis Adobe Caslon (including Adobe Caslon Expert). It includes:\n\nUpper case, lower case, small caps, lining numerals, oldstyle\n\nnumerals, vulgar fractions, superior and inferior numerals, swash\n\nitalic caps, ornaments, long s, and the following ligatures:\n\nff fi fl ffi ffl Rp ct st Sh Si Sl SS St (where S=long s)\n\n[Ed: Another common example is the Computer Modern Roman typeface\n\nthat is provided with TeX. this family of fonts include the ff,\n\nfi, fl, ffi, and ffl ligatures which TeX automatically uses when\n\nit finds these letters juxtaposed in the text.]\n\nWhile there are a large number number of possible ligatures,\n\ngenerally only the most common ones are actually provided. In\n\npart, this is because the presence of too many alternate forms\n\nstarts reducing legibility. A case in point is Luxeuil Miniscule,\n\na highly-ligatured medieval document hand which is completely\n\nillegible to the untrained eye (and none too legible to the\n\ntrained eye, either :)).\n\n* Don Hosek offers the following insight into ligatures:\n\nLigatures were used in lead type, originally in imitation of\n\ncalligraphic actions (particularly in Greek which retained an\n\nexcessive number of ligatures in printed material as late as the\n\n19th century), but as typefaces developed, ligatures were retained\n\nto improve the appearance of certain letter combinations. In some\n\ncases, it was used to allow certain letter combinations to be more\n\nclosely spaced (e.g., \"To\" or \"Vo\") and were referred to as\n\n\"logotypes\". In other cases, the designs of two letters were merged\n\nto keep the overall spacing of words uniform. Ligatures are\n\nprovided in most contemporary fonts for exactly this reason.\n\n* Liam Quim makes the following observations:\n\nThe term ligature should only be used to describe joined letters in\n\nprinting, not letters that overlap in manuscripts.\n\nMany (not all) accents came from the practice of using a tilde or\n\nother mark to represent an omitted letter, so that for example the\n\nLatin word `Dominus' would be written dns, with a tilde or bar over\n\nthe n. This is an abbreviation, not a ligature.\n\nMost ligatures vanished during the 15th and 16th Centuries. It was\n\nsimply too much work to use them, and it increased the price of\n\nbook production too much.\n\n[Ed: there is no \"complete\" set of ligatures.]\n\nSubject: 1.15. Built-in Fonts\n\n* PostScript printers (and Adobe Type Manager) with 13 fonts have:\n\n???\n\n* Postscript printers with 17 fonts have:\n\nCourier, Courier-Bold, Courier-BoldOblique, Courier-Oblique,\n\nHelvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-BoldOblique, Helvetica-Narrow,\n\nHelvetica-Narrow-Bold, Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique,\n\nHelvetica-Narrow-Oblique, Helvetica-Oblique, Symbol, Times-Bold,\n\nTimes-BoldItalic, Times-Italic, Times-Roman\n\n* Postscript printers with 35 fonts have:\n\nAll of the above, plus the following:\n\nZapfChancery-MediumItalic, ZapfDingbats, AvantGarde-Book,\n\nAvantGarde-BookOblique, AvantGarde-Demi, AvantGarde-DemiOblique,\n\nBookman-Demi, Bookman-DemiItalic, Bookman-Light,\n\nBookman-LightItalic, NewCenturySchlbk-Bold,\n\nNewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic, NewCenturySchlbk-Italic,\n\nNewCenturySchlbk-Roman, Palatino-Bold, Palatino-BoldItalic,\n\nPalatino-Italic, Palatino-Roman\n\n* HP LaserJet printers (II, IIP)\n\nCourier 10, Courier 12, LinePrinter 16.66, ...\n\n* HP LaserJet printers (III, IIIP)\n\nAll of the above, plus the following:\n\nScalable Times Roman and Scalable Univers using Compugraphic's\n\nIntellifont hinted font format.\n\n* SPARCPrinters\n\nThe basic 35 fonts plus four scaled faces of each of Bembo, Gill\n\nSans, Rockwell, Lucida, Lucida Bright, Sans and Typewriter, giving\n\na total of 57 fonts, all in the F3 format.\n\nSubject: 1.16. Glossary\n\n[ I ripped this right out of the manual I wrote for Sfware. If you have\n\ncomments, improvements, suggestions, please tell me... ]\n\nanti-aliasing\n\n[ed: this is an 'off-the-cuff' definition, feel free to clarify it\n\nfor me ;-) ]\n\nOn low-resolution bitmap devices (where ragged, ugly characters\n\nare the norm) which support more than two colors, it is possible\n\nto provide the appearance of higher resolution with anti-aliasing.\n\nAnti-aliasing uses shaded pixels around the edges of the bitmap\n\nto give the appearance of partial-pixels which improves the\n\napparent resolution.\n\nbaseline\n\nThe baseline is an imaginary line upon which each character rests.\n\nCharacters that appear next to each other are (usually) lined up so\n\nthat their baselines are on the same level. Some characters extend\n\nbelow the baseline (\"g\" and \"j\", for example) but most rest on it.\n\nbitmap\n\nA bitmap is an array of dots. If you imagine a sheet of graph paper\n\nwith some squares colored in, a bitmap is a compact way of\n\nrepresenting to the computer which squares are colored and which\n\nare not.\n\nIn a bitmapped font, every character is represented as a pattern of\n\ndots in a bitmap. The dots are so small (300 or more dots-per-inch,\n\nusually) that they are indistinguishable on the printed page.\n\ncharacter\n\n(1) The smallest component of written language that has semantic\n\nvalue. Character refers to the abstract idea, rather than a\n\nspecific shape (see also glyph), though in code tables some form\n\nof visual representation is essential for the reader's\n\nunderstanding. (2) The basic unit of encoding for the Unicode\n\ncharacter encoding, 16 bits of information. (3) Synonym for \"code\n\nelement\". (4) The English name for the ideographic written\n\nelements of Chinese origin.\n\ndownload\n\nDownloading is the process of transferring information from one\n\ndevice to another. This transferral is called downloading when the\n\ntransfer flows from a device of (relatively) more power to one of\n\n(relatively) less power. Sending new fonts to your printer so that\n\nit \"learns\" how to print characters in that font is called\n\ndownloading.\n\nfont\n\nA particular collection of characters of a typeface with unique\n\nparameters in the 'Variation vector', a particular instance of\n\nvalues for orientation, size, posture, weight, etc., values. The\n\nword font or fount is derived from the word foundry, where,\n\noriginally, type was cast. It has come to mean the vehicle which\n\nholds the typeface character collection. A font can be metal,\n\nphotographic film, or electronic media (cartridge, tape, disk).\n\nglyph\n\n(1) The actual shape (bit pattern, outline) of a character image.\n\nFor example, an italic 'a' and a roman 'a' are two different glyphs\n\nrepresenting the same underlying character. In this strict sense,\n\nany two images which differ in shape constitute different glyphs.\n\nIn this usage, \"glyph\" is a synonym for \"character image\", or\n\nsimply \"image\". (2) A kind of idealized surface form derived from\n\nsome combination of underlying characters in some specific\n\ncontext, rather than an actual character image. In this broad\n\nusage, two images would constitute the same glyph whenever they\n\nhave essentially the same topology (as in oblique 'a' and roman\n\n'a'), but different glyphs when one is written with a hooked top\n\nand the other without (the way one prints an 'a' by hand). In\n\nthis usage, \"glyph\" is a synonym for \"glyph type,\" where glyph is\n\ndefined as in sense 1.\n\nhints\n\nWhen a character is described in outline format the outline has\n\nunlimited resolution. If you make it ten times as big, it is just\n\nas accurate as if it were ten times as small.\n\nHowever, to be of use, we must transfer the character outline to a\n\nsheet of paper through a device called a raster image processor\n\n(RIP). The RIP builds the image of the character out of lots of\n\nlittle squares called picture elements (pixels).\n\nThe problem is, a pixel has physical size and can be printed only\n\nas either black or white. Look at a sheet of graph paper. Rows and\n\ncolumns of little squares (think: pixels). Draw a large `O' in the\n\nmiddle of the graph paper. Darken in all the squares touched by the\n\nO. Do the darkened squares form a letter that looks like the O you\n\ndrew? This is the problem with low resolution (300 dpi). Which\n\npixels do you turn on and which do you leave off to most accurately\n\nreproduce the character?\n\nAll methods of hinting strive to fit (map) the outline of a\n\ncharacter onto the pixel grid and produce the most\n\npleasing/recognizable character no matter how coarse the grid is.\n\nkerning\n\n(noun): That portion of a letter which extends beyond its width,\n\nthat is, the letter shapes that overhang - the projection of a\n\ncharacter beyond its sidebearings.\n\n(verb): To adjust the intercharacter spacing in character groups\n\n(words) to improve their appearance. Some letter combinations\n\n(\"AV\" and \"To\", for example) appear farther apart than others\n\nbecause of the shapes of the individual letters.\n\nMany sophisticated word processors move these letter combinations\n\ncloser together automatically.\n\noutline font/format\n\nSee 'scalable font'\n\npoint\n\nThe (more or less) original point system (Didot) did have exactly\n\n72 points to the inch. The catch is that it was the French\n\nimperial inch, somewhat longer than the English inch, and it went\n\naway in the French revolution. What most people now think of as\n\npoints were established by the United States Typefounders\n\nAssociation in 1886. This measure was a matter of convenience for\n\nthe members of the Association, who didn't want to retool any more\n\nthan they had to, so it had no relationship to the inch. By that\n\ndate, people realized that the inch was an archaic measure anyway;\n\nthe point was set to be 1/12 of a pica, and an 83-pica distance\n\nwas made equal to 35 centimeters. (Talk about arbitrary!)\n\nThus the measure of 72.27/in. is just an approximation. Of course,\n\nwhen PostScript was being written, it was necessary to fit into an\n\ninch-measured world. For the sake of simplicity PostScript defined\n\na point as exactly 1/72\". With the prevalance of DTP, the\n\nsimplified point has replaced the older American point in many\n\nuses. Personally, I don't see that it matters one way or the\n\nother; all that counts is that there's a commonly-understood unit\n\nof measurement that allows you to get the size you think you want.\n\nThat is, after all, the point ;)\n\nscalable font\n\nA scalable font, unlike a bitmapped font, is defined mathematically\n\nand can be rendered at any requested size (within reason).\n\nsoftfont\n\nA softfont is a bitmapped or scalable description of a typeface or\n\nfont. They can be downloaded to your printer and used just like\n\nany other printer font. Unlike built-in and cartridge fonts,\n\nsoftfonts use memory inside your printer. Downloading a lot of\n\nsoftfonts may reduce the printers ability to construct complex\n\npages.\n\nsymbol set\n\nThe symbol set of a font describes the relative positions of\n\nindividual characters within the font. Since there can only be 256\n\ncharacters in most fonts, and there are well over 256 different\n\ncharacters used in professional document preparation, there needs\n\nto be some way to map characters into positions within the font.\n\nThe symbol set serves this purpose. It identifies the \"map\" used\n\nto position characters within the font.\n\ntypeface\n\nThe features by which a character's design is recognized, hence\n\nthe word face. Within the Latin language group of graphic shapes\n\nare the following forms: Uncial, Blackletter, Serif, Sans Serif,\n\nScripts, and Decorative. Each form characterizes one or more\n\ndesigns. Example: Serif form contains four designs called Old\n\nStyle, Transitional, Modern, and Slab Serif designs. The typeface\n\ncalled Bodoni is a Modern design, while Times Roman is a\n\nTransitional design.\n\nThis is Info file comp.fonts.faq.info, produced by Makeinfo-1.55 from\n\nthe input file FAQ.texinfo.\n\nSubject: 1.17.

Well, I suppose\n\nit could be argued that printing technology influences design - e.g.\n\nsome types look fine in metal but lousy in digital imagesetting - and\n\ntherefore a book that is out-of-date in technology can't really be\n\n\"definitive\" in matters of design either.
