Rumelt\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36658033\n\nI think it's awesome Carmack and Abrash are working together again. I read \"Masters of Doom\" back in the day, and it totally rocked my mind and took me back to a time when I was too young to realize just how impactful Carmack was on the industry that I enjoyed as a kid.\n\nI just wouldn't have predicted that their comeback to the limelight would be working for Facebook. In my eyes, they were \"bigger\" than that (obviously not monetarily). They \"meant\" more to me. This is all subjective stuff I realize, and yes I've heard a zillion times \"how good it is for VR\", but it kind of indirectly gives a message that the best thing a genius who is already capable of changing the world can do is work for Facebook instead of do their own thing.\n\nCall me a softy, but something just warms my heart when I see smart people stand out on their own, unswayed by the massive \"power monoliths\" surrounding them, and STILL kick ass. That's what Facebook did! And that was awesome! I just hope that spirit of entrepreneurship doesn't fade, and that geniuses know their power lies within themselves — not in deep pockets of any company.\n\nCongrats to all involved though — I can only imagine what kind of crazy office days are ahead. The sequel to \"Masters of Doom\" is yet to be written.\n\nSome great books have already been mentioned but those which were the most personally influential which haven't yet been mentioned:\n\n- Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n- Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance\n\n- Bad Blood by John Carreyrou\n\n- Kochland by Christopher Leonard\n\n- Masters of Doom by David Kushner\n\nI read a lot of \"business consultant\" books and began to be annoyed with them since many of them can be summed up by the title and the first couple of chapters.\n\nI like the books above because they presented factual events that allow you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nI especially like Schwarzenegger's book and Bad Blood because of their depth. It was interesting to hear about Schwarzenegger's crazy business ideas like how he became a millionaire before becoming an actor and how he bought a 747.\n\nI found the audiobook \"Master's of Doom\" (book is 2003 but audiobook is newer) to be really entertaining as it was read by actor Wil Wheaton who did a great job.\n\nYep, Carmack would be great; on the other hand, you can learn pretty much everything you need to know about how he started id Software with his friends by reading the great book \"Masters of Doom\" (I strongly recommend it).\n\nGeorge Broussard and the Duke Nukem team would be great, too (the brilliant guy who wrote the then-ubercool 3D game engine was still a kid at the time!)\n\nBy the way: web startups are great but they aren't the only ones. \"Founders at work\" is a great, great resource but it would have been even greater if it focused a little less on web stuff.\n\nA very brilliant guy is Matt Dillon. Not the actor... well, he certainly is brilliant too ;) The software developer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon_(computer_scientist)\n\nHe started a few startups but he is mostly known as a BSD kernel developer wizard. He started the very innovative DragonflyBSD project (a fork of FreeBSD with impressive goals).\n\nChuck Moore (inventor of Forth and computer visionary) started/was part of a few startups, too. Lately, he has been with IntellaSys creating an impressive, radically-different microprocessor (\"SEAforth\").\n\nThe story of Bill Joy (BSD, TCP/IP hacker and co-founder of Sun Microsystems) would be cool, too.\n\nThe Lisp Machine guys would be great as well (though there already is some info available of the net).\n\nAnd why not founders in fields not related at all with computers? The founders of Bose, Hobie Cat, etc.\n\nEDIT: yes, there is a lot of superlatives :)\n\nThis may be because I have always admired John Carmack, and because I love video games - although I am drawn to all kind of different book genres, but \"Masters of Doom\" had a profound effect on me.\n\nI read it every few months, and I have gifted it to family and friends, and most of them loved it as well.\n\nIt’s not the writing, nor the story per se that stand out, it’s not just about how it beautiful highlights and highs and the lows of the Johns’s symbiotic relationship and their accomplishments, it’s not even about how their skills, strengths and weaknesses play into their success and failures (which I am sure is typical of most co-founders stories).\n\nIt’s about empowering the reader to believe that everything’s possible, and how smart, hard-working people can build technologies that affect the lives of many.\n\nThis book works wonders for when I am going through burn-outs, or I am not motivated enough to pursue a problem or a project.\n\nWhen I am done reading the book, I am excited and eager to get back into the game. I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n- How to Start a Startup (YC)\n\n- How to Build a Startup (Steve Blank on Udacity)\n\n- CS183/Zero to One (Peter Thiel)\n\n- CS184: Startup Engineering (Balaji S. Srinivasan)\n\nBest:\n\nPando Monthly: interviews by Sarah Lacy with founders and VCs. Many go for two or three hours. She goes beyond the PR story and touches on details, doubts, decisions.\n\nThis Week in Startups: interviews by Jason Calacanis. You'll learn things that are not in the PR story. Check out the Uber interview with Travis Kalanick for some gore inceptions details..\n\n- Founders at Work (book by Jessica Livingston)\n\n- any book you find by someone who's done it before. VCs, founders, etc. Relevant books can be Jordan Mechner's book about Prince of Persia, Eric Schmidt about Google, Masters of Doom. These contain gems about crucial moments and how people went about doing things, building product, distribution, relations. Peeking behind the curtain.\n\nI found the book \"The definitive book of body language: How to read others's thoughts by their gestures\" by Allan and Barbara Pease to be a great read.\n\nThe greatest show on Earth - Richard Dawkins was an excellent read.\n\nSurely you're joking Mr Feynman by Richard p.Feynman was terrific read by a very small bit can considerred offensive or at the least dated in its outlook but if you can get past that its great!\n\nI recently finished a book on ID called \"Masters of doom\" by David Kushner which I rather enjoyed as well.\n\nI also love reading about crackers from the (mostly) 80's and I can recommend.\n\nCuckoo Egg by Cliff Stoll\n\nMasters of deception\n\nWe are anonymous - Inside the hacker world of lulzsec, anonymous and the global cyber insurgency by Parmy Olson\n\nI loved \"Underground Hacking Madness and the obsession on the electronic frontier\" once I got past the first 2 or 3 chapters (also it was researched by Julian Assange before wikileak and has a chapter about his hacking) An Ebook copy can be found on the authors website http://www.underground-book.net/download.php3\n\nGhost in the wire Kevin Mitnick\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nSunburst and Luminary: an Apollo Memoir\n\nhttps://www.sunburstandluminary.com/SLhome.html\n\nThe Brain Makers\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brain-Makers-HP-Newquist/dp/067230412...\n\nStrategic Computing: DARPA and the Quest for Machine Intelligence\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Computing-Machine-Intellige...\n\nThe Soul of a New Machine\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine/dp/B01FCTJCR0\n\nHackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Heroes-Computer-Revolution-An...\n\nWhere Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Where-Wizards-Stay-Up-Late/dp/B00AQU7...\n\nArt of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn\n\nhttp://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEn...\n\nNot a dedicated history book, but Hamming talks a lot about personal experiences and observations\n\nUNIX: A History and a Memoir\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/UNIX-History-Memoir-Brian-Kernighan-e...\n\nMasters of Doom\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Cult... linking to audiobook because it is read by Wil Wheaton :)\n\nGhost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wires-Adventures-Worlds-Wanted/...\n\nIt might be just me, but I really enjoy reading biographies of people important to the science, for example here is one for John Tukey https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbm.2003...\n\nI'm going to take a very different stance here from others.\n\nFirst, you should ask yourself - what kind of engineer do you want to be. Why are you building?\n\nThen, read about the people who became the best and their early days. What did they do when they were in your position? Did they study a set of topics or did they pursue their passions? Taking and highly-weighing advice from people not at the top of the field could be very detrimental to your development as an engineer.\n\nFrom reading books like: Coders at work, Masters of Doom, Making of Karateka, you will realize that the best engineers were driven by their ideas and projects very early on. They ended up learning to make things happen. But don't take my word for it, find these people, study their stories and pick the path you would enjoy the most.\n\nThis approach will not just make you a strong career engineer, but could turn you into one of the greats - the people that get to push the field forward.\n\n- The Prince (get's a bad press, thought provoking)\n\n- Apex [Nexus 3] (prose is meh, inevitable life goes this way)\n\n- Factfulness (Awesome, most important book I read this year)\n\n- Prisoners of Geography (why nations act the way they do)\n\n- Crux [Nexus 2] (prose is meh, inevitable life goes this way)\n\n- Debt: the first 5000 years (slog to get through but interesting)\n\n- Nexus [Nexus 1] (prose is meh, inevitable life goes this way)\n\n- Digitocracy (super short story, super powerful message)\n\n- Artemis (Not as good as the martian)\n\n- Before Mars (Starts out great, fizzles out)\n\n- Down and Out in Magic Kingdom (How reputation based social currency might pan out)\n\n- Blood Sweat and Pixels (How games are really made)\n\n- Masters of Doom (Awesome story of how the game was made and what it led to)\n\n- Foundation [Foundation 1] (Prescient with where the world is, what might happen in reality)\n\n- Quiet: the Power of Introverts in a World that can't... (Ok, not great, read it on blinkist)\n\n- Ender's Game (Under rated, most fun I had reading this year, I know...)\n\n- Neuromancer (classic, must read)\n\n- Pre-suation (interesting and worth reading if starting a consumer facing business)\n\n- The Three-Body Problem (Found it tedious, honestly. Interesting though)\n\n- Radical Candour (A lot of common sense advice we take for granted and could do better with)\n\n- Seveneves (Longggggg, but really worth it. Shame about the ending)\n\n- The Virgin Banker (Really good read, how a bank came into being)\n\n- Why information grows (Great read, could of been half the length, would recommend)\n\n- Babylon Revisited (Meh)\n\n- Money: the Unauthorised Biography (Simplistic history of money before and after coin. Good)\n\n- Hellbent (Enjoyed it, good for a holiday read)\n\n- Snow Crash (Classic, Awesome, read it)\n\n- The little prince (must read)\n\n- To Pixar and Beyond (A different viewpoint on Jobs)\n\nNice! You probably know of this link \"Get started making music\"[0] and I found it pretty cool.\n\nWhat do you think of \"The Sims Game Design Documents\"[1]? Could you recommend other similar resources?\n\nI guess what really strikes a chord with me is the arc, not only \"in\" the game, but of the journey to make the game. One book I enjoyed on an emotional level was \"The Making of Prince of Persia\"[2] by Jordan Mechner. I also enjoyed \"Masters of Doom\"[3] by David Kushner, but more on the merit of good research, which I really respect. I don't want a montage, I want the story with the suffering and tribulations.\n\nDo you know of similar content?\n\n[0]: https://learningmusic.ableton.com/\n\n[1]: https://donhopkins.com/home/TheSimsDesignDocuments/\n\n[2]: https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985-19...\n\n[3]: https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Cult...\n\nGreat timing for this question, I just completed the audiobook and was also looking for something similar.\n\nMasters of Doom is probably the best book I have ever consumed. It was extremely motivating, the description of everything made me wish I could go back in time and be there so badly.\n\nThink of having a goal you are so passionate about reaching, that you don't care about food, baths or anything else, you just want to work on this 20 hours a day. Must have been amazing.\n\nMyself, I definitely will have a look at the Wolfenstein 3D and Doom \"Game Engine Black Book\" by Fabien Sanglard.\n\nIn the short term you can get used to it. I used to get vr sickness instantly when moving with a joystick but eventually you get used to it. I now have zero vr sickness even when doing crazy physics defying spinning or something.\n\nAs for the long term - my hope is that it gets better as the headsets get better. It seems to so far.\n\nOne sort of interesting thing along these lines - I remember in the book \"Masters of Doom\" they're describing the early days of FPS development and how people would frequently get very nautious and grab the trash can by their desk to vomit.\n\nYou never hear about that anymore. What is that? Better screens? Playing games when you're a kid? Whatever is at work there, seems like it might apply to vr too.\n\n\"The Road Ahead\" by Bill Gates is an interesting look into what Bill envisioned for the Internet. It came with a CD-ROM full of videos of how devices would be used in schools and workplaces (I thonk law enforcement too if I remember correctly). The videos are much better than the book.\n\n\"The Second Coming of Steve Jobs\" was eye opening for me regarding the life of Jobs, his family life, and his business involvements.\n\n\"Masters of Doom\" by David Kushner chronicles the history of id Software and its creators. It's an entertaining book for sure, especially the part where id has Gwar show up at Microsoft.\n\n\"Close to the Machine\" by Ellen Ullman is the memoir of a software developer in the 80s. I need to read this one again, but it was enjoyable. I think about one part in particular from time to time where the author recounts being offered a job to work on an aging mainframe. The man pitching the job is probably the last person around who's dedicated to maintaining it. She would have made a lot of money doing it, but the work itself looked to be soul draining, so she skipped it fpr pther opportunities\n\n\"The Fugitive Game\" by Jonathan Littman documents the story of Kevin Mitnick, the so-called most wanted hacker alive. Certainly has some surprises and is a fun read.\n\nPretty much anything by Norbert Wiener regarding cybernetics is interesting from a historical perspective. I've read several but the one that comes to mind immediately is \"God and Golem, Inc\". While unfinished, it goes into cybernetics, which was a practice or idea that technology could interface with biological life in a complementary way and those ways should be pursued. I think he was ultimately successful since we take a lot of those ideas for granted today.\n\n\"The Computer and The Brain\" by John von Neumann is a great and short read. It mostly talks about how binary signals can be fired by synapses in the brain.\n\nFor memo, I just created a file so the list could be augmented at: https://github.com/jhadjar/Notes/blob/master/creation_proces...\n\n-----\n\nNot sure it's exactly what you're looking for, but I really liked:\n\n- The Making of Prince of Persia - Jordan Mechner\n\n- Masters of Doom - David Kushner.\n\n- Founders at Work - Jessica Livingston (aggregate of stories)\n\nPretty cool in different ways:\n\n- The first shows how the author documented a good chunk of the process (like solving the problem of the Prince's alter ego).\n\n- The second by the journalistic work the author went through and access he had.\n\n- The third by the context it gives on many things (for example, you get a glimpse on Palantir's current work by looking into Paypal's history and the work Max Levchin, CTO at the time, and his team did on fraud detection, or Hotmail's growth tactics).\n\nGames should be about story the same way a painting should be about story. Gameplay mechanics are the paints, and should be applied with intent for best results.\n\nSure, some abstract painting is great. Tetris is as well. But that's not the norm.\n\nAs for Carmack, we all know he's the tech guy and great at it. What's important is how the tools he creates are used. I've not played Rage yet, but I hear it's mediocre. I'm not brokenhearted over that.\n\nWhat does hit me though, is QuakeLive.com's irrelevance in id's/Bethesda's planning. I'd love to see them first add a second game with worthwhile teamplay to compete with Team Fortress 2 (which is something id/B should've been ahead of.)\n\nSecondly they need to provide a strong modding API and let players rent servers to host their mods on, and even let players run ads or charge for access if they want. Become the platform.\n\nFinally, since I now realize I'm just writing a long id wishlist, I want the original team back for one more romp... I want them to be leads for Bethesda in relaunching Quake. Only this time, do it as an open world FPSRPG a la Fallout/Morrowind. Base it off of the old pen and paper rpg sessions that they all used to play that Carmack DMed, and Romero destroyed when he took the Diakatana from a demon. (All wonderfully discussed in the Masters of Doom book.)\n\n... God this post got a little crazy.\n\nSecond most doesn't mean anything when you're talking about three arrangements, realistically.\n\nI would like it to be true that solo founders have just as much chance of success. I have been unable to find a cofounder for years, and I am not biased against solo companies. People are unpredictable, and even wildly successful companies have some disheartening back stories. I've learned that from books like Idea Man (Microsoft) and Masters of Doom (id Software) where founding members got screwed by morally challenged cofounders. In the case of id, Tom Hall received nothing from id in the end, and forfeited all of his equity when he was fired. Because they decided he wasn't needed anymore, despite him being there from the beginning through the tough times.\n\nBut it stands to reason that you are better off if you can find someone who is honest and is going to work hard with you, simply because two heads are better than one. When used together at least. Emphasis on honest, I would rank trust and ethics over experience and intelligence.\n\nIf you can't find that person, and you are determined, then may as well go ahead and go it alone. You only live once. Just realize the odds are stacked even higher against you. You are only lying to yourself if you refuse to accept that truth.\n\nAnd you can be a cofounder of a successful company, but still fail miserably and have it all taken away by a bad cofounder.\n\nThis article reminded me of a trend I noticed when reading the book \"Masters of Doom,\" which discussed (among other things) the graphical improvements that made games like Wolfenstein and Doom so impressive. Very often, the book's prose would start sentences something along the lines of \"though the graphics were crude, etc etc etc.\"\n\nThese sorts of lines, constantly repeated, irked me, not because they weren't technically true or anything, but because it's such a \"looking-backward\" point of view. At the time, that's not how people saw it. It was all about pushing forward the state of the art, and we miss something when we look back on it in that way.\n\nI guess in a similar way I've had the same feeling about \"modern\" pixel art, where it often seems to miss the point. By treating it as just an art style, it turns it from an exercise in conveying a vision despite limitations, into an effort to simplify and downsample because those are the most easily-recognized surface-level hallmarks of that period.\n\nFor me, the magic of that era comes from seeing techniques like color cycling ( http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/?sound=0 ), where the desire to get a certain effect led to interesting workarounds, rather than being satisfied with limitations because it's \"retro.\"\n\nDavid Kushner's excellent book \"Masters of Doom\" certainly paints a picture of Carmack being mainly interested in solving problems above everything else. Made me think of this passage from the beginning of chapter 4 (before becoming rich, when they were just starting up id Software):\n\n> Carmack was of the moment. His ruling force was focus. Time existed for him not in some promising future or sentimental past but in the present condition, the intricate web ol problems and solutions, imagination and code. He kept nothing from the past–no pictures, no records, no games, no computer disks. He didn’t even save copies of his first games, Wraith and Shadowforge. There was no yearbook to remind of his time at school, no magazine copies of his early publications. He kept nothing but what he needed at the time. His bedroom consisted of a lamp, a pillow, a blanket, and a stack of books. There was no mattress. All he brought with him from home was a cat named Mitzi (a gift from his stepfamily) with a mean streak and a reckless bladder.\n\nEleven years later, in Time in 2001, commenting on the infamous split with John Romero:\n\n> John Carmack doesn't disagree with Romero's description of their clashing priorities. \"I'm doing what I want to do now, and it happens to be making us millions of dollars,\" he told TIME last week, in one of his first public comments on the split with his former partner. Carmack doesn't want to grow id into a big company. \"There's only so many Ferraris I want to own,\" he says. But he takes issue with Romero's version of their breakup. \"John's a good designer, and he's got artistic talent. But the fact is that after he got rich and famous, the push to work just wasn't there anymore.\" Romero didn't quit last fall, says Carmack. \"He was handed his resignation.\" [0]\n\n[0] http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,137916,...\n\nWow, I'm just now seeing this news. Initially, I had that sinking feeling set in... I mean, like you, I have been impacted by his story, his games (not just the Wolfenstein/Doom/Quake franchises... I'm talking Commander Keen, boys and girls), his code, reading Masters of Doom, etc.\n\nI can see my copy of Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book Special Edition sitting here, which was such a treat to read when it came out, because it has so many great chapters on the development of Quake and little stories about John's discoveries and thought processes throughout the development of the game.\n\nBut, then I thought... wait... this is a new beginning. I wrote about this previously, but, look for gaming to start heading in the direction of VR with technology like Oculus Rift. Also, with someone of the caliber of John Carmack involved (now totally focused on it because of the resignation announcement) with not only his passion and skill, but his ability to work with graphics hardware manufacturers and driver developers to effect change and garner the necessary support and backing, expect to see vibrant, compelling developments in this field.\n\nIn case you missed it, check this video out of John discussing some of his VR work. It is from E3 2012:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYa8kirsUfg\n\nThat momentary sinking feeling has faded away now... great things are ahead!\n\nThe War of Art - Steven Pressfield (unsure how I felt about this one, but it's short so worth a read)\n\nDeep Work - Cal Newport (recommended)\n\nStumbling on Happiness - Daniel Gilbert (recommended)\n\nSucceed: How We Can Reach Our Goals - Heidi Grant-Halvorson (lots of great stuff in here, highly recommended)\n\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X - Alex Haley (I really like biographies and Malcolm X was a pretty interesting person. recommended)\n\nMaking It in Real Estate: Starting Out as a Developer - John McNellis (meh)\n\nReady Player One - Ernest Cline (I'm not big on sci-fi, so this book surprised me with how good it was. recommended)\n\nMan's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl (I'm not sure how much I got out of it, but worth it just for learning about Frankl's unique experiences and perspectives. recommended)\n\nElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future (meh)\n\nMasters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture - David Kushner (One of those books that makes you want to lock yourself in a room and program for hours. Carmack's dedication and intellect is especially awe-inspiring. recommended)\n\nMasters of Doom is a fantastic book, really enjoyed reading that.\n\nFrom that I then also read the Making of the Prince of Persia[1]. This is Jordan Mechner's journal from his time during the making of this game. Not just about the game but about some of his life in general too. Not as riveting as the Masters of Doom, but still a very interesting little read.\n\n[1] http://www.amazon.com/The-Making-Prince-Persia-Journals/dp/1...\n\nEdit. Oh yes, just remembered. For a real trip down memory lane you might want to check out Speccy Nation[2] too. It took me about an hour to flick through but it was so much fun, afterwards I had to call up my best friend from the time (another ZX Spectrum addict) and tell him to buy a copy!\n\n[2] http://www.amazon.co.uk/Speccy-Nation-ebook/dp/B0096BFBSA\n\nNever read Masters of Doom but this excerpt about id Software in John Craddock's new book Rocket Jump was a fascinating long read:\n\nhttp://www.shacknews.com/article/101156/rocket-jump-quake-an...\n\nI grew up in this era so I'm certainly enamored by the nostalgia trip but I have a lot of respect for the team at id, it's fascinating to read about all of the mundane aspects of ray tracing and compressing color palettes enough such that a game like Doom or Quake could actually work. id probably did more than any other company at the time to make programming seem like an alternative subculture instead of a science and to make games these dark and moody experiences that were a blast to play (especially with friends via LAN).\n\nYou could also argue that good health is a privilege. It is. But it isn't special. The late 70s were a time when computers were flooding the marketplace, and that could only happen if they were affordable for regular people.\n\nI graduated in 1979 with a whole class of people who were quite capable of doing what Gates and Jobs did, and that's just from one university. But we didn't, and Gates/Jobs did. How do you explain that?\n\nMy father was career military. That isn't a recipe for wealth, and is an avenue available to millions of people.\n\nYou might be interested in the book \"Masters of Doom\" about John Carmack and John Romero. They had none of the privileges you assert, and yet vaulted to the top of the gaming industry.\n\nMeditations - Marcus Aurelius -- A fine classic I enjoyed.\n\nMight count, might not, since it finished in March but was going on before. I loved Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - Eliezer Yudkowsky - http://hpmor.com/\n\nLoved Masters of Doom - David Kushner\n\nI liked Worm - Wildbow - https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/ -- but it falls short of overall greatness and I don't think it's worth its 22-average-books length if I were to go back in time and decide on rereading...\n\nLearn to Play Go: A Master's Guide to the Ultimate Game (Volume I) - Janice Kim -- I've been learning Go and thought this book was particularly excellent for beginners.\n\nThere are at least 4 other books I'm close to finishing and I might get one done before the end of the month... Volume 2 of the above Go series, Mythical Man-Month, A handbook of traditional living, or The Waking Dream.\n\nI also think it's a great book, but partly because it is technical.\n\nCharles is great at explaining how computers actually work with circuit diagrams from the ground up in a way that's articulate, clear, and engaging. I think I learned more from this book than I did in my CS architecture class.\n\nThe historical context he puts it in helps with clarity since it's easier to understand when you know how each successive step built on the previous one.\n\nIn addition to the Dream Machine, I'd also mention Steven Levy's Hackers as an obvious one to read.\n\nSome others I've read:\n\n- What the dormouse said (this one was just okay, but interesting to see some of the cultural context at the time).\n\n- Crypto (about the history of cryptography). I really liked this one, but people I've recommended it to found it dry.\n\n- In the Plex (history of Google)\n\n- Masters of Doom (John Carmack, John Romero and Id Software)\n\nRelated Fiction:\n\n- Microserfs\n\n- The Soul of a New Machine\n\n- The Phoenix Project (fiction paired with the Dev Ops Handbook)\n\nGet an advanced degree only if you want to do it, or it clearly benefits you - say, migration to some country. You are not limited anymore by paper in your carrier progression within IT industry after your first job - your achievements will open the doors.\n\nLet me also address psychological aspects. You are much more than a university certificate, you are not defined by it. You can self-educate yourself on a lot of technical and non-technical topics, you can have interesting hobbies, create, challenge yourself physically. There are potentially so much more to do to help you succeed in relationships.\n\nDo not build barriers that cause anxiety, do not dream how much better your would be if you had a fancy degree - you live once, accept yourself, and invest in yourself in what you really want.\n\nI totally understand you btw, I have a non-CS degree from a no-name university in a small post-Soviet country. You can imagine that I felt a bit insecure about it as well. 5 years on, I stopped worrying about it, when realised that my employers and people around me in general judged me by my current contributions and character.\n\nIn IT, we basically only need to dedicate focus and time to improve ourselves. No barriers like expensive equipment or official accreditation. Also, maybe, read Masters of Doom, a book about John Carmack for inspiration.\n\nAfter recently reading \"Masters of Doom\" (not sure how I went so long without reading it) this reminds me a lot of similar stories about the id guys and particularly Romero. So many creative, ambitious people get involved in the production of games and other digital art but so often they run into the limitations of time, budget, and project management. To get the money, you need to hype the hell out of a project (Daikatana?) but even if you get the investment, it's rarely enough to actually get the right people together and actually build something within the amount of time the market demands.\n\nI'd imagine the same thing goes for films as well. Start with an incredibly ambitious concept only to find that you need to hype the hell out of it in order to get the necessary investment. But then with outside investment comes the requirement that the finished product be released within a certain timeframe and meet certain expectations in terms of profits generated. It's no wonder that for all of the talented and dedicated artists out there (in games or film), the majority of what gets released is either disappointing, unoriginal, or at best, pretty damn good...but rarely mindblowing or something that elevates the entire state of the art.\n\n> Interesting; my strategy has been almost the polar opposite of his ('learn widely', not 'deeply'), and it served me well so far.\n\nThis whole kind of advice is not very useful in practise. Copying a recipe for success from a person that is wildly different in personality than you will not lead to the same outcomes.\n\nIf you've read Masters of Doom, it is evident that Carmack is not neuro-typical. Few people have the ability to concentrate like him. There is no point trying to become like him, this will only make you miserable. Don't fall for post-hoc rationalisation: he naturally gravitated towards it and became successful. 200 years ago he might have been a scholarly monk, or a watchmaker tinkering.\n\nYou have to choose your own path. Doesn't mean you cannot learn from the mistakes of others, but this will probably be about how and less about what.\n\nThe Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. Those are the two to start with.\n\nIf you like those, check out some of her nonfiction books: The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism, Philosophy: Who Needs It, and Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology (these are but a few - Rand wrote a long series of nonfiction books).\n\nAyn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist by Tara Smith (a philosophy professor at UT-Austin) is excellent because it unpacks Ayn Rand's ethical system in an academic style. Finally, Leonard Peikoff's Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand gives a comprehensive view of Rand's entire philosophy.\n\nLight reading (not by Objectivist authors, and not in any particular order):\n\nMasters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture by David Kushner\n\nThe Soul of A New Machine by Tracy Kidder\n\nThe Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA by James Watson\n\nWhat Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character by Richard Feynman\n\nSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character by Richard Feynman\n\nMasters Of Doom - The value of an unbalanced life and focused hard work. Also, how to start a startup. A really fun read, to boot.\n\nFooled By Randomness - a) Survivorship bias. b) If you look at revealed preferences, people choose regular small gains with a rare huge loss over regular small losses and a rare huge gain even though that choice is -ev. c) Much more!\n\nHackers and Painters - One of the most insightful, subversive, and surprising texts out there.\n\nC Interfaces and Implementations - Great examples of good API design and how to build clean modular code.\n\nThe Paleo Manifesto - Explains how the origin of religion was probably as a set of models for coping with the transition from hunting/gathering to civilized agriculture. The part of the book where he points out that the story of the fall of man in the Bible is probably the story of this transition is super interesting.\n\nThe Game - Made me realize that the narrative told by boomer and gen-x parents about how to attract a woman is probably doing young men (and women) more harm than good. I would not try to treat this as a how-to manual, though. A fun yarn.\n\nStarting Strength - After years of fumbling around in the gym this cut through a lot of bad ideas about fitness, exercise, strength, and health. It lead to the first real (and lasting) progress I've ever made physically.\n\nUnderstanding Comics - Understanding art and visual communication.\n\nSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! - Up there with Hackers & Painters in its rate of insight & surprise per page.\n\nFail Safe Investing - Thought provoking ideas about why we invest and how best to go about doing that. (The ideas stand up, IMO, but some of the concrete advice on how to implement those ideas is very dated.)\n\nGood Calories, Bad Calories - It turns out that even scientists can be dishonest and corrupted by politics.\n\nNow and then I wonder why Doom was such a perfect game, mostly I think it is nostalgia besides revolutionary technique at that time. I've also read the book \"Masters of Doom\" and would recommend anyone who wants to get inspired on creating something from almost nothing by some sort of following your heart and using your (smart) brains. It makes me happy to read the book.\n\nThe main ingredients which imho make Doom classic:\n\n- creepy/spacey/metal Adlib music, thanks to Bobby Prince (Adlib was good for that)\n\n- simple, but effective spooky samples playing at random locations\n\n- for the time good textures (need some good graphics artists) to give it a dark feeling\n\n- kiss play experience (see how it probably would be done nowadays: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4yIxUOWrtw )\n\n- VGA-graphics, I keep saying this to people: VGA is pixely, but somehow I don't see that when playing Doom, I compare it with cartoon drawings, you don't focus on the details, but how it looks globally and use a bit of fantasy to bring it to life - nowadays graphics are so detailed that I somehow get distracted by too much detail, it's becoming too realistic almost and doesn't look like a 'game' anymore\n\n- deathmatch or coop via modem, calling your friend to play a match via the telephone line, warning your parents that they are not allowed to pick up the phone, playing not too long because you had to pay per minute (in The Netherlands at least)\n\n- everything packed in a few diskettes (3 or 4?) was at that time almost magic that you could have such a 3d world fitting on it\n\nThere are many more reasons why for me Doom will always have a good reputation for me, mostly because of a combination of properties which came together at that time.\n\nComputer history is one of my favorite topics, so I've read a lot over the years. Here's my list:\n\n>> Classic computer history:\n\n- \"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution\", Steven Levy\n\n- \"The Innovators\", Walter Isaacson\n\n- \"Valley of Genius: The Uncensored History of Silicon Valley\", Adam Fisher [innovative format, tons of interesting tidbits after you get used to the style. Read only after the other two above]\n\n- \"The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story\", Michael Lewis\n\n- \"The Second Coming of Steve Jobs\", Alan Deutschman\n\n- \"Revolution in The Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made\", Andy Hertzfeld\n\n- \"Masters of Doom\", David Kushner\n\n- \"Idea Man\", Paul Allen\n\n- \"Where Wizards Stay Up Late\", Katie Hafner\n\n>> Entertaining stories, but less historical value:\n\n- \"Ghost in the Wires\", Kevin Mitnick\n\n- \"Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley\", Antonio Garcia Martinez\n\n- \"Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal\", Nick Bilton\n\n>> On my to-read queue:\n\n- \"How the Internet Happened\", Brian McCullough [just started; very promising]\n\n- \"Troublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age\", Leslie Berlin\n\n- \"Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of WWII\", Liza Mundy\n\n- \"Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer\", Paul Freiberger / Michael Swaine\n\n>> Others worth mentioning (but just read a few chapters):\n\n- \"The Supermen: The Story of Seymour Cray\", Charles Murray [about Cray Computers]\n\n- \"Racing the Beam\" [about Atari]\n\n- \"Commodore: A Company on the Edge\" [about Commodore]\n\n>> Bonus:\n\n- \"Art of Atari\", Tim Lapetino [great as a coffee table book, particularly if you grew up in the 80's :) ]\n\n\"Masters of Doom\" by David Kushner\n\nIt'd been on my list for quite awhile but I just got around to it a few months ago. It was fascinating to read about all the games I'd played growing up. For those who haven't read it - it covers pretty much the birth of the gaming industry as we know it today not just Doom. It goes all the way back to when Romero was writing games and sending them in to magazines to be included on disks. Carmack has always been an icon for me so it was interesting to read about him on a more personal level.\n\nIn addition to the interest factor - it was also quite inspiring to me. It certainly increased my drive to get stuff done. If the early history of PC gaming interests you at all; or you just want to read a page turner of a book about people not that dissimilar from you I'd highly recommend it.\n\nI agree low-attention multitasking is what works.\n\nStanding on the bus, running, kneading dough, ok.\n\nListening to a book and trying to code, no chance.\n\nI disagree on what kind work best, for me \"divulgation-level\" non-fiction is the one. Think Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nActual fiction can be complex because it requires attention on who is talking, where they are, whether you're in a time skip or flashbacks etc. Divulgation doesn't.\n\nFor example, I've recently listened to The World Until Yesterday[0] and Masters of Doom[1].\n\nThey are both reasonably light, they tend to hit the same concepts over and over, there are few \"characters\", and generally missing 30 seconds of narration has close to zero impact.\n\nBut also, I'm fairly sure reading skills is what counts the most. I'm not even sure it's a matter of \"being best\" as it is a matter of a reader just sounding better for a specific person.\n\n[0] http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-World-until-Yesterday-...\n\n[1] http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Masters-of-Doom-Audio...\n\nNice to see this here, thanks for sharing it cmsimike.\n\nThis was a labor of love/appreciation for me a couple of years ago over a Christmas break. I went through a retro gamedev period during that break, read a few books like Masters of Doom, and found myself trying to read through the various (relatively poor quality) electronic copies of the Black Book that were floating around. Yak shaving being what it is, I spent most of my Christmas break scraping and cleaning up a few different copies to put this together so I could (more comfortably) read it on my Kindle.\n\nFWIW, these conversions were done with an eye for preserving an interesting piece of gaming/graphics programming history, and aren't really intended to be relevant today.\n\nI also converted the Zen of Assembly Language also by Abrash[1], but it's considerably less relevant than the Black Book in general.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-zen-of-asm\n\n100% Agree. Just add another point:\n\nRich people with supportive networks of course can pursuit their goals easier.\n\nOccasionally people from not very good families can do this as well because they're so screwed by the environment and tried to get rid of everything in (the book 'Masters of DOOM' is an example assuming it doesn't try to be too dramatic).\n\nIt's much harder to do the same as middle classes with a lot of life obligations, distractions, and most importantly they are by default need to follow linear career developments - it's much harder to be adventurous to had drastic improvement compared to previous categories.\n\nMasters of Doom is an awesome read. If you are into gaming, graphics or the history of id Software... order it today.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the book that I particularly enjoyed:\n\n\"On a cold winter day, Carmack laced up his shoes, slipped on his jacket, and headed out into the Madison snow. The town was blanketed in the stuff, cars caked in frost, trees dangling ice. Carmack endured the chill because he had no car; he'd sold the MGB long before. It was easy enough for him to shut out the weather, just like he could, when necessary, shut Tom and Romero's antics out of his mind. He was on a mission.\n\nCarmack stepped into the local bank and requested a cashier's check for $11,000. The money was for a NeXT computer, the latest machine from Steve Jobs, cocreator of Apple. The NeXT, a stealth black cube, surpassed the promise of Jobs's earlier machines by incorporating NeXTSTEP, a powerful system tailor-made for custom software development. The market for PCs and games was exploding, and this was the perfect tool to create more dynamic titles for the increasingly viable gaming platform. It was the ultimate Christmas present for the ultimate in young graphics programmers, Carmack.\"\n\nOf course, the book wouldn't be complete without Ferrari details and discussion:\n\n\"At a showroom, they admired a gleaming new Testarossa that listed at $90,000. Carmack was treating cars like he treated his games; he had already grown somewhat tired of his current engine. What he really wanted was one of these. [...] Carmack paid cash for a red one to match his 328.\n\n[...]\n\nBut Carmack's Ferrari didn't stay in the lot for long. Within days he drove it over to Norwood Autocraft and started on the modifications - he wanted to get the car, which ran at four hundred horsepower, at least twice as strong. Bob Norwood, who had become Carmack's automotive mentor, had a master plan: to install a twin turbo system that would not just double but triple the car's horsepower. For added energy, they put in a computer-controlled device that would inject a burst of nitrous oxide.\"\n\nI see loads of great suggestions in this thread, let me just add three of my LEAST favourite nonfiction books:\n\nThinking, Fast and Slow: Really should have been subtitled The Ludic Fallacy Run Amok. Filled with grand generalisations based on dubious conclusions from small under-powered behavioural experiments. Read if you want further evidence that Behavioural Economics, that bastard child of psychology is an edifice built on bullshit.\n\nMasters of DOOM: A homage from a fanboy meant for other fanboys. It definitely has its bits of brilliance but it is still a chore to finish.\n\nThe Inner Game of Tennis: At 161 pages it might seem short but is in fact 160 pages too long. I bought it after someone on HN said its advice wasn't really about tennis but about life. I wonder what that person was smoking at the time.\n\nIt's interesting to hear more about the video game industry insides.\n\nI wonder if id's success helped start this atmosphere. (Read masters of doom)\n\nThey were portrayed as rockstars, friends, who busted ass and made a popular game which made them all rich.\n\nI fell for that idea when i was young, luckily i never got into the industry. I later read some blog post of an EA developer's wife or something, going on and on how much he had to work and wasn't compensated for it, etc.\n\nTop of my head, here are some books on specific histories I enjoyed. All old, but there are timeless nuggets in them.\n\nSoul of a new machine, previously mentioned. Where I first learned about mushroom management.\n\nJust for Fun: the story of an accidental revolutionary [0] was fun bio on Torvalds from 2001\n\nThe Mythical Man Month [1] offers some insight into the management and thinking that went into OS/360\n\nMasters of Doom [2]: offers an enjoyable history of the shareware years and the rise of id software\n\nThe multicians site [3]: is a collaborative history of Multics, one the most influential operating systems.\n\nThe Mother of All Demos [4]: even better than Steve Jobs keynotes\n\nSteve Jobs iPhone introduction [5]: I’m not a huge fan of Mr Jobs, but this is one of the best presentations ever. It’s not history, per se, but very interesting through our eyes.\n\n0: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160171.Just_for_Fun\n\n1: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_M...\n\n2: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom\n\n3: https://multicians.org/\n\n4: https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY\n\n5: https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ\n\nhttp://doom.wikia.com/wiki/NEXTSTEP\n\nFrom my memory of reading Masters of Doom, they developed for where they expected the consumer PC hardware market to be at the time of release. If you wanted that hardware at the time they were developing, $10k Next workstations were your best bet.\n\nWhen Doom came out, I (and most other folks) needed a new PC.\n\nPorts to multiple platforms were pretty common in those days with games and that's something the team had a lot of experience with from their years at Softdisk. Having looked at the game code, it's not really terribly difficult.\n\nThe first step to wisdom is calling things by their proper name. This is not elitism, simply stating facts. He wouldn't be called \"Surgeon\" if he were to advise a manufacturing company on how their tools should look nicer.\n\nWhat you're witnessing in this thread isn't elitism as much as it is people who've ruined their eyes wanting to set the record clear.\n\nFurthermore, that \"Jobs\" movie will probably appeal to most people because it's probably not accurate. It's probably a movie that will portray Steve Jobs as that genius who knew the future before everyone else, who've seen how Apple would be 20 years before everyone else. Anyone with more than 2 neurons knows it's a bunch of crap. You can't know how the end result will be designing a really small thing, let alone an empire.\n\nIn addition, it's \"Cinema\", not History nor Journalism. Want to read a good book? Read \"Masters of Doom\". That's how you get multiple opinions from people involved in the story, not some kind of lame movie based on the only authorized biography of a person, as brilliant as that person may be.\n\nAnd lastly, come on, attacking Woz? If someone manages to get the respect of Engineers, you can be sure it's not because of his wits or Reality Distortion Field. Last time I checked, this is Hacker News. If there is any place elitism is the de facto constitution, it's in the Hackerdom.\n\nMy advice is to follow gaming history and reuse engine code as much as possible. Use SDL2 as it is barebone and yet privides you sophisticated tools.\n\nHere is a list of 12 games that I picked because I'm biased towards RPG but you can definitely choose your own wishlist.\n\nPart one: Warm up and basic input, audio and video.\n\nPong, Snake, Tetris, Breakout, Galaxian, Frogger.\n\nPart Two: Scrolling screen, levels and overall game architecture:\n\nSuper Mario, Gradius, Twinbee\n\nPart Three: RPGs which are more or less \"complete\" games and need some tooling:\n\nUltima III, Wizardry I Japanese version, Dungeon Master\n\nPart Four: Just keep practicing. You already graduated and can do whatever you want!\n\nAlso don't forgrt to read Masters of Doom which will give you tons of inspiration. You can actually walk Carmack's route as well. His first commercial game is an Ultima spin off called Wraith.\n\nMasters of Doom may well be the only book I've finished this year. I'm currently reading a few novels and The Snowball (Buffet's bio) but it is a slow process because of the overwhelming amount of time I spend reading news, technical resources, comics, and short stories.\n\nI cannot recommend Masters of Doom highly enough to anyone on this website. It's about the rise of Id games and the technological and cultural breakthroughs they made in the industry. Kushner expertly weaves a tale about video games, programming and entrepreneurship in a way that few can. His attention to detail is masterful -- not simply an overabundance of detail, but detail in all the places it belongs. I really felt like I was there with the two great Johns, just as invested in the future of Id as they were.\n\nIf this is all it takes to demoralize you, don't go into gaming. I put it off for years myself because of the EA spouse scandal in 2004. When I graduated, I went into web development instead. Years later, I had a convenient opportunity to work at a gaming company and only stayed in the industry for 3 years.\n\nWhen people say only work in gaming if you can't imagine doing anything else, they mean it. The work is hard, the hours are long, the people are \"colorful\" and most gaming companies are completely disorganized, even by startup standards. Read \"masters of doom\" and realize what is depicted in that book is practically industry standard, including the egos, yelling, screaming and off-color humor. Some see those things are a bonus. Some don't.\n\nThe upsides are the technical problems and the coolness factor. To a certain extent, gaming has ruined me for web development. After coding a solution to efficiently visualize an EXPLODING PLANET, it's hard to get excited about creating yet another social network.\n\nYeah, Carmack has a history of unethical behavior. From the book \"Masters of Doom\":\n\n> Late one night Carmack and his friends snuck up to a nearby school where they knew there were Apple II machines. Carmack had read about how a thermite paste could be used to melt through glass, but he needed some kind of adhesive material, like Vaseline. He mixed the concoction and applied it to the window, dissolving the glass so they could pop out holes to crawl through. A fat friend, however, had more than a little trouble squeezing inside; he reached through the hole instead and opened the window to let himself in. Doing so, he triggered the silent alarm. The cops came in no time.\n\n> The fourteen-year-old Carmack was sent for psychiatric evaluation to help determine his sentence. He came into the room with a sizable chip on his shoulder. The interview didn’t go well. Carmack was later told the contents of his evaluation: “Boy behaves like a walking brain with legs ... no empathy for other human beings.” At one point the man twiddled his pencil and asked Carmack, “If you hadn’t been caught, do you think you would have done something like this again?”\n\n> “If I hadn’t been caught,” Carmack replied honestly, “yes, I probably would have done that again.”\n\n> Later he ran into the psychiatrist, who told him, “You know, it’s not very smart to tell someone you’re going to go do a crime again.”\n\n> “I said, ‘if I hadn’t been caught,’ goddamn it!” Carmack replied. He was sentenced to one year in a small juvenile detention home in town. Most of the kids were in for drugs. Carmack was in for an Apple II.\n\nWolfenstein 3D played a large part of driving my interest in computers and learning how they really work under the hood when I was young. Plus the release of MapEdit really made you feel powerful and a young kid getting involved in computers.\n\nDoom is the point where I became interested in programming and it got me looking to how you actually made these games. id Software eventually open sourcing Wolf3D really helped spur that on. On top of that, Carmacks talk and his always interesting .plan file (a blog before blogs) made him seem very accessible and really opened up the world of game programming. I still enjoy going back and reading parts of the Wolf 3D or Doom code to see how they handled certain problems/limitations.\n\nI'd agree with the other poster that 'Masters of Doom' is a great read and worth it to grab if you haven't read it already.\n\nMaybe it's an age thing? How old were you when it came out?\n\nThat game changed my life. It was the most immersive, scariest thing ever. It was 4 players (not 2), and we had endless LANs and modem games. We made maps, there were whole map-making communities, whole BBSes only talking about Doom and Doom 2 and Heretic and other games based on it.. It was the biggest thing ever, even bigger than Quake in many ways because there was a lot fewer similar games at the time. I played through the single player so many times that I can revisit most maps in my mind 15+ years later...\n\nEven the book Masters of Doom is mostly about how that game was created, rather than Quake or other id games that came before or after because Doom truly was the game changer.\n\nAh, wasn't expecting a 500+ page pdf. All the words in the title trigger to think about presentations...\n\nActually I like the idea of full stories about the history of specific software. (Obviously haven't read this one just now, so can't say whether it's any good).\n\nDoes anyone know of other books (physical prints would be preferable to me) in this genre? Masters of Doom comes to mind, but it's a bit too much about the personal story maybe.\n\nEdit: I see it's also available in print on Amazon\n\nI have this weird habit where if I sit and read too much about the same topic, I have trouble retaining all of the information I just read. So, I find I can retain everything better if I read small amounts from multiple books. I sit with a stack of a few books and read chapter out of each. Weird, I know. Here's my current stack:\n\n* The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition (Bjarne Stroustrup)\n\n* Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14 (Scott Meyers)\n\n* Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with WebGL (7th Edition) (Edward Angel & Dave Schreiner)\n\n* Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture (David Kushner)\n\n* Neuromancer (William Gibson)\n\nI most recently finished:\n\n* Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them (Cynthia Shapiro)\n\n* C++ for dinosaurs (Nick Economidis)\n\nI am highly anticipating the final(?) book of the Ender's Game Series by Orson Scott Card titled Shadows Alive.\n\nI just learned about and probably will buy:\n\n* The Denial of Death (Ernest Becker)\n\nYou should read Masters of Doom.\n\n>The gamers weren’t just Softdisk guys anymore, they were, as they called\n\nthemselves, the IFD guys, co-owners of Ideas from the Deep. Softdisk, as a result, took on an even greater pallor. But it was a day job, a job they all needed since there was no real money coming in yet and no guarantee that it would come in at all. They decided, then, to continue working on titles for\n\nGamers Edge during the day while they churned out Commander Keen from the lake house at night.\n\n>They became all the more efficient at \"borrowing\" the Softdisk computers. Every night after work they’d back their cars up to the office and load the machines. The next morning they’d come in early enough to bring the com-\n\nputers back. They even got a little cocky about it. Though the machines were top of the line, they wanted some minor adjustments made...\"\n\nA very clever way to go out.\n\nIt instantly reminded me of the story of when Carmack and Romero decided to go on their own after they were working together at Softdisk. At the time, there were no side-scroller games for PC for performance reasons. Carmack (20 years old at the time) had an idea, I believe it was about shifting the pointer of the display (or something to that effect), that allowed smooth side-scrolling enough to emulate the effects of the NES. He stayed up all night, and left a floppy at Romero's desk for the next day. When Romero got in the next day, and played the disk, Romero pretty much said \"That's it, we're outta here\" and from that initial engine was born Commander Keen, and the beginning of the legend of John Carmack.\n\nIt's been a few years since I read the book \"Masters of Doom\", so some of the details are hazy, but I thoroughly recommend it.\n\nCarmack's genius is just out of this world.\n\nEdit: Factual Correction.\n\nSteven Levy's Hackers of course, but also his Crypto which is in some ways even better.\n\nMichael A. Hiltzik's Dealers of Lightning about the heyday of computing research at Xerox PARC isn't universally praised (IIRC it's more or less Bob Metcalfe's version of the story) but it is very readable.\n\nBob Johnstone's We Were Burning, about the golden age of Japanese consumer electronics (wich also covers many events and actors in the US and UK).\n\nDavid Kushner's Masters of Doom, about the heyday of Id Software.\n\nThe First Computers—History and Architectures is a more academic book, a selection of history papers, but it's still very readable. The Computer Pioneers: Pioneer Computers videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qundvme1Tik&list=PL14396C953... , presented by Gordon Moore himself, cover much of the same ground (it says little about the wartime Bletchley Park computers).\n\nIf I'm going to allow myself some videos then I should also mention Steve Blank \"Secret History of Silicon Valley\" talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo and David Alan Grier's \"When Computers Were Human\" talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwqltwvPnkw ."
