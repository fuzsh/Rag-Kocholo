        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn recent years, retrospectives of classic games have been well received at GDC, but there have been very few stories about classic game tools. This series of articles will attempt to fill that gap, by interviewing key people who were instrumental in the history of game development tools.\n\nThe first article in this series was an interview with John Romero about TEd, the Tile Editor he created at Id Software, that went on to ship over 30 games.\n\nFor the second article, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to speak to Tim Sweeney about the first version of the Unreal Editor, or UnrealEd. We spoke at the Unreal booth during the GamesCom 2017 conference in Cologne, Germany.\n\nFallacies and BSPs: \"I'll write an editor\"\n\nDL: Thank you for taking the time to talk to me, Tim! Let's start with the early days of the Unreal Editor. I read that James Schmaltz – creator of Epic Pinball – showed you a game that he was working on, and when you saw it, you offered to build an editor for it. Is that correct?"
