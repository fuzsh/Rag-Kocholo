First, it hax an 1 1-voice stereo music synthesizer that is fully compatible with die widely used AdLib sound fonnai. Older software that only supports die AdLib board will automatically turn on the AdLib mode — no adjustment by die user is necessary. A separate channel is exclusively for reproducing digitized speech. A microphone jack on the back of the card allows you to dighize your own input voices. With a 4-wait iieieo amplirter built in, you can run speakers or headphones directly from the card — no additional amplification is necessaiy. A Maodard joystick poet also douldes as a MIDI interface, allowing you to connect a syndwsizer or any other MIDI instrument. Combine diti widi an excellent library of software, and it is easy to see why the Sound Blaster has become so popular. Blaster worth the Ipvesiment? Yes, ves. a thW!iaiid.tim;i veilV.

Circle Reader Service Number 125 EDITORIAL LICENSE Clifton Karnes Tfie international organization MISERY has recently adopted improved metric equivalents for common computer measurements. Last month, I talked about some of the changes taking place here at COMPUTE. The biggest change, of course, Is that OM- NI has moved to Greensboro. We at COMPUTE were look- ing forward to working closer with OMNI, and we're already seeing the first fruits of our new relationship. As you probably know, OM- NI is a top science magazine. The staff are experts at report- ing scientific information, and they're crusaders for a scien- tific approach to measure- ment. In just one month, they've convinced us to adopt the metric system as our stan- dard. So, beginning with the May 1992 issue, COMPUTE will be 100-percent metric. What does this mean for you? Well, in some areas there will be no change, be- cause we're using metric measures already. For exam- ple, famiitar quantities such as ms (millisecond, or one- thousandth of a second), K (kilobyte, or 1024 bytes), MB (megabyte, or 1024K), and MHz (megahertz, or 1 million hertz) are metric already, so they'll stay the same. C3 5 Si, J \" ■.■» ■ ;---\\' ' ■ .■-!.../. -■ \\ ' - ;■/ . !- . 1 %: 7^ .;v^.- . The first change you'll no- tice with the meitric shift is the way we express the sizes of floppy disks. What used to be called 3!/?- and 5'/4-inch disks will now be 8.89-cm and 13.335-cm, respectively. Soon the old 8.89-cm disk will be as familiar as the old- fashioned inch one. Just as the metric system's centimeter is an improvement over the inch, the world-wide committee on metric stan- dards, Metric International for Systems, Engir>eering, Rela- tions, and Yields, or MISERY for short, has recently adopt- ed improved metric equiva- lents for common computer measurements. The first measure to fall un- der MISERY'S a;< was the pop- ular pixel, the smallest ad- dressable dot on a computer screen. MISERY isn't the first to propose a pixelary alterna- tive. Recently, Microsoft start- ed using TWIP, a device-inde- pendent measure, for screen size (nobody knows what 7W/P stands for), MISERY sug- gests JVJ\\1, which does stand for something: Tall and Wide but Independent of TWIPs. One TWIT is worth .76459 pixels, so an 800 x 600 display is, using that met- ric equivalent, 611.672 x 458,754, Much more accu- rate, and clearly better. in the same spirit that gave us the TWIT, MISERY has proposed a new metric measure for money, replac- ing our U.S. dollar with an in- ternational currency called Monetary Organization for Original Legal Access, or MOOLA, for short. One dollar is worth 3.141592654, or pi, MOOLAs. So a software prod- uct with a price of $39.95 will cost 125.5066265 MOOLAs, With large computer sys- tems, the MOOLA measure- ment gets really exciting. For example, a new 486 with all the trimmings sells for $2,999.95. That's an impres- sive 9,424.620881 MOOLAs. Now that's a number worthy of such a machine! The good metric stuff doesn't end there. Software version numbers are being im- proved by the adoption of MIS- ERY'S Bipartisan Universal Gra- dient, or BUG, for short. A BUG is a simple measure. To get it, you multiply a con- stant^.00321— by the cur- rent version number. For exam- ple, DOS 5.0 is now DOS .01605 BUGS. With this ingen- ious system, most products will never get their BUGs to version 1.0. Last, but certainly not least, we've proposed our own metric standard for num- bering magazine issues. MIS- ERY has responded favorably to this and plans to adopt it in its next MISERY version .00963 BUGs. Here's how it works. The numbering system mul- tiplies the year by .0001 and then multiplies that product by the number of the month. So the April 1992 issue you hold in your hands is in reali- ty issue .7968 ((.0001 x 1992) X 4). Going along with the new numbering system, there will be 10.3904 issues in 1992, but 10.3916 issues in 1993. We haven't given a name to this system yet. Any ideas? That's it. Beginning in May, you'll see the drab software ref- erences in the magazine re- placed with something like this: MISERY-DOS, version .98342 BUGs, 611.672 x 458.754 TWITs supported, available on 8.89- and 13.335- cm disks, for 125.5066265 MOOLAs. It's true that you'll need a computer to calculate and re- calculate all these metric equiv- alents, but if you love comput- ers the way we think you do, you'll find the work a joy.

Stan- dard ASCII is a 7-bit code, wtiich means there are 128 possible values. The first 128 symbols in ttie PC's char- acter set are standard ASCII. The next 1 28 characters are specific to the PC and are often referred to as the extended character set. bandwidth.

The DOS command line is the familiar A> prompt. When you type commands at the prompt, the command interpreter, COM- MAND.COM, executes them or tells you their syntax is incorrect. compiler. A compiler translates an en- tire file of source code into pure ma- chine language. When you run a com- piled program, the entire program loads into memory and executes. CD-ROM.

CPU is also used to refer to a PC's system box (the part of the machine that hous- es the CPU, memory, and disk drives). DOS. Disk Operating System. Although it does much more than just manage disks, that's DOS's pnmary job. There are several varieties oi DOS for PCs. in- cluding MS-DOS (Microsoft), PC-DOS (IBf\\/1), and DR DOS (Digital Research). interpreter. An interpreter translates one line of source code at a time and executes it. BASIC is the most popular interpreted language, though modern BASICS can be compiled. K. Kilobyte. A kilobyte is 1024 bytes. Early PCs came with 4K or less. The standard for 80B8-based PCs is now 64GK, for 80286s it's 1MB, and for 80386s it's 2MB or more. As with mon- ey, you can never have enough RAM, MB. Megabyte. A megabyte is equal to 1,048,576 bytes, or 1,024K. Memory on large systems and storage for most hard disks are measured in megabytes. MHz. Megahertz. A megahertz is 1,000,000 cycles per second. Mega- hertz is used as the measure of a mi- croprocessor's speed. The first IBM PC ran at 4.77 MHz. The new 80386 and 80486 chips run at 33 MHz or faster. multitasking. In modern parlance, mul- titasking means running two or more programs at the same time. On the PC, the Intel 286, 386, and 486 processors can multitask in protected mode. Win- dows 3.0, OS/2, GeoWorl<s Ensemble. DESOview, and Unix are examples of PC multitasking operating systems and operating system extensions. RAM. Random Access Memory. Al- though this kind of memory can be ac- cessed randomly, a better name would be read-write memory because you can both read from and write to any RAM memory location. RAM disk. A RAM disk is an area of memory that functions just like a disk drive, except that it's lightning fast. To install a RAM disk on your PC, you put a command like DEVICE=RAMDRIVE in your CONFIG.SYS file. ROM. Read Only Memory. Computer memory that can be read from but can't be changed or written to. In the PC, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output Sys- tem) is ROM. S COMPUTE APRIL 1992 TSR. Terminate and Stay Resicient. This is the name for a large class of ap- plications that remain in your PC's mem- ory and are called with hot keys. TSRs take advantage of hvo important DOS at- tributes. You can run a program but leave it in memory, and you can redirect system routines to your own code. The most popular early TSR was probably Sidel<icl<. Recent superstar TSRs include PC Tools Deluxe Desktop. MEMORY address space. This is the amount of RAM a CPU can \"see.\" An 8088 can ad- dress as much as 1MB. an 80286 as much as 16MB, and an 80386 as much as 4096MB of memory. conventional memory. Conventional memory is simply the first 640K of mem- ory. The 384K of memory between the 640K barrier and 1MB (ceiled UMB, or upper memory) is reserved for DOS, but a portion of this memory can be ac- cessed as expanded memory with the appropriate hardware. EMS. Expanded Memory Specification. This is a specification developed by Lo- tus. Intel, and Microsoft (LIM) to break the 640K barrier by accessing up to 32MB of expanded memory. EMS maps a 64K page divided into four 16K windows in DOS's upper memory area (the 384K above 640K). Until the release of LIM version 4.0, multitasking was not available through the EMS standard. expanded memory. Introduced in 1985 by the consortium of Lotus, Intel and Microsoft, expanded memory is a way to expand a PC or AT beyond 1 MB of memory. The memory manager (a chip set that supervises expanded memory access) is given a handle by a program to tell it where some informa- tion lies in the memory above 1MB, When the request is made, the memo- ry manager maps that portion of mem- ory to four 16K regions in high memo- ry for easy program access. The sys- tem works a little like a RAM disk with a maximum capacity of 8MB (with LIM, EMS 3.2) or 32MB (with LIM EMS 4.0). extended memory. Technically, extend- ed memory is any memory beyond the base 1MB of memory accessible by the 80286 and the 80386 operating in real mode. An AT can access memory above 1MB directly through the use of a RAM disk. DOS provides the means of creating a RAM disk with device driv- ers such as VDISK.SYS and RAMDRIVE.SYS. Other uses for extend- ed memory include disk caching and ex- panded memory emulation. Windows 3.0 directly accesses this memory. HMA. High Memory Area. High mem- ory i.s the first 64K of extended memo- ry. By a quirk in the design of 80286 and 80386 processors, this memory is directly accessible in real mode. LIM. Lotus-tntel-Microsoft. LIM is the ac- ronym that stands for the developers of EMS (Expanded Memory Specifica- tion), which can allow any PC or AT op- erating in real mode to access up to 32MB of memory. protected mode. Protected mode is a special multitasking feature of 80286, 80386, and higher CPUs. In this mode, your PC can run Windows 3.0, and it \"sees\" as much as 16MB of mem- ory at a time, all of which is accessible. Protected mode also allows the 80286 and 80386 machines to access the hard disk as if it were RAM DOS runs in real mode, not protected mode. real mode. Real mode is the default for the 8088 and 8086 CPUs. The 80286 and 80386 CPUs are able lo run as a fast 8088 chip (real mode) or as a multi- tasking 16-bit chip (protected mode). As an 8088-emulating chip, the 80286 and 80386 have the same memory lim- itations (1MB) as the 8088. UMB. Upper Memory Block. The upper memory area is located between 640K and 1MB. IBM used to call this area re- served memory. Expanded memory managers and programs such as 0£/W/Wand 386MAX use this area, di^ viding it into blocks into which you can load TSRs and device drivers high. XMS. extended Memory Specification. XMS provides a way of managing ex- tended memory in much the same way as EMS 4.0 provides a way to manage expanded memory, It also allows ac- cess to the HMA. To use XMS, you need to install a device driver called HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file. DISKS cache. A cache is a special program that uses part of your PC's RAM to store the information your disk uses most often. With a cache, when the sys- tem requests data from a disk, there's a good chance the data (or part of it) will be in the cache. Since RAM ac- cess is much, much faster than disk ac- cess, a cache can make disk-intensive applications fly. cluster. The File Allocation Table maps groups of sectors called clus- ters. A cluster is the minimum amount of storage space a file can use. For this reason, each file on a disk takes up at least one cluster.

File Allocation Table, The FAT is an area on a DOS disk that comes di- rectly after the boot record. It contains information on all the sectors on the disk, and it maps the location of every file on the disk. file attributes. Each file on a disk is marked as Read Only, Hidden, Sys- tem, Archive, or a combination of these. These file attributes are located with the other file information in the di- rectory With DOS's ATTRIB command, you can alter a file's attributes. floppy. Floppy disks are thin, round, flex- ible disks housed inside a 5Vi-inch flat plastic housing. The sturdier 3V2-inch disks are also referred to as floppies. ms. Millisecond, fvlilliseconds are com- monly used to measure the speed of hard disk drives. Common speeds are 65 ms for a 20MB drive, 28 ms for a 40MB, and 14 ms for a 110MB. The smaller the number, the faster the drive. partition. Hard disks are divided log- ically into one or more areas called par- titions. Prior to DOS 4.0, if you had a hard disk larger than 32MB, you had to partition your drive with the DOS FDISK command. After partitioning, your drive will act as if it were two or more drives. The partition table is locat- ed on track 0 directly in front of the disk's boot sector. root directory. After a disk's File Alloca- tion Table comes the root directory The root directory is like the table of con- tents. It stores the filenames, time and date stamp of latest update, starting clus- ter number, file size, and file attributes. sector. Disks are divided in concentric circles called tracks, and each track is further divided into wedges called sec- tors. Sectors can be identified by the side of the disk they're located on, their track number, and the sector num- ber within the track. Although sectors can be any size, on PCs they're almost always 512K. subdirectory. Before the introduction of DOS 2.0, all the files on the disk had to reside in the root directory The ability to create subdirectories solved this problem and made it possible to organ- ize a disk. The root directory is like a drawer containing folders. The folders are subdirectories, which contain oth- er folders or individual files. 10 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 track. Tracks form concentric circles be- ginning with track 0 at the outer edge of the disk. The denser the medium (that is. the more information it can hold), the closer the tracks are togeth- er. A 5V4-inch floppy disk has a den- sity of 48 tracks per inch, or tpi; 3V2- inch floppies weigh in at 135 tpi. volume label. When you format a disk, you have the option of giving it a name— a volume label. To give a flop- py disk a volume label, use the N op- tion when you format. wildcards. Wildcards are special char- acters that stand for other characters, DOS uses the question mark C) and as- terisk (■) as wildcards. The asterisk stands for any number of characters of any kind, and the question mark stands for one character of any kind. Wildcard patterns can be useful when you want to execute a DOS command on several files at once. To copy all the files on a disk or in a current directory to a hard drive or another disk, enter COPY '.\" drive: at the DOS prompt. VIDEO CGA. Color Graphics Adapter. IBM in- troduced the CGA card as a way to bring color graphics to the PC. For its 320 X 200 pixel graphics screen, it add- ed pink and powder blue to the al- ready perfected black-and-white. CGA also provides a 640 x 200 pixel high- resolution graphics screen in black- and-white and text in 16 colors against a background that can be displayed in 8 colors. EGA. Enhanced Graphics Adapter. A marked improvement over the CGA adapter, EGA can display 16 colors on a graphics screen of 320 x 200, 640 x 200, or 640 x 350 pixels, Although orig- inally released in a conliguration that on- ly provided 16 colors on a 320 x 200 pix- el screen, this limitation was overcome in response to consumer demands. 8514/A. The 8514/A graphics card, in- troduced in 1987 with the PS/2 l:ne of computers, provides an interlaced screen with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels. At this resolution, it provides 256 colors. Currently, it is only cne of many ultra VGA designs trying to estab- lish themselves as standards. Since the 8514/A hardware is expensive and very few programs make use of it, most users have been content wiih the various flavors of Super VGA. EPS. Encapsulated PostScript, This ob- ject-oriented graphics format contains all the code necessary to print a graph- ics file on a PostScript printing device. GIF. Graphic Interchange Format. This graphic standard was developed by CompuServe to provide a standard graphics format for online services. It is a compressed bitmapped format. Hercules Graphics Adapter. The Hercu- les Graphics Adapter, also known as the HGA, is a modification of the MDA standard that allowed the card to dis- play very clean monochrome graphics at a resolution of 720 x 348 pixels as well as the crisp, clear character set of the MDA. This adapter dates from 1982. Interestingly, the Hercules Graph- ic Adapter was developed by Van Suwannukul so that he could write his doctoral thesis with the Thai alphabet. IFF. Interchangeable File Format. IFF is a bitmapped format that's the standard graphics format on the Amiga and is al- so used on the PC by DeluxePaint. interlaced. An interlaced screen is drawn twice. First it's drawn in one po- sition, and then it's shifted about half a pixel and redrawn. Using this tech- nique, it's possible to multiply the res- olution of a monitor. In comiputers, the interlaced screen appears to jump slightly, as if it has the jitters. This makes it unacceptable for word proc- essing and other detail work. MCGA, Multi-Color Graphics Array. The MCGA was introduced to provide a col- orful graphics display for the low-end PS/ 2 machines. It's capable of producing graphics of 320 x 200 pixels in 256 col- ors from a palette of 262,144 colors. MDA. Monochrome Display Adapter. In- troduced with the PC in 1981, this dis- play adapter could only display text, though the text it displayed was very clear. The reasoning behind this deci- sion was that the PC was aimed at busi- ness users and business persons were not interested in displaying graph- ics. It failed to revolutionize computer graphics and was quickly supplanted by the Hercules Graphics Adapter as the monochrome adapter of choice. If it had been capable of displaying graphics, it would have displayed 720 X 350 pixels. PCX. This is a standard bitmapped graphics format for the PC, developed by Z-Soft. Most PC paint programs sup- port PCX, as do almost all bitmapped graphics applications. According to Z- Soft, PCX doesn't stand for anything, though Picture Exchange seems an ob- vious origin. pixel.

Resolution refers to the num- ber of pixels available to reproduce an image on the screen. The higher the res- olution, the more pixels there are avail- able. Curves produced in a low resolu- tion like 320 X 200 have a stairstep appearance. They are obviously formed of short straight lines. A curve on a high-resolution screen will appear much smoother. Resolution is also used to describe printer dot density. Most laser printers can reproduce 300 dpi (dots per inch), making very smooth curves with only a few jaggies. A 300-dpi laser printer provides 90.000 dots per square inch. A 400-dpi laser printer can provide 160,000 dots per square inch, providing still higher reso- lution and smoother cur\\/es, Super VGA. Super Video Graphics Ar- ray. This was an enhancement of the standard VGA that allowed an 800 x 600 pixel screen displaying 16 colors from a palette of 256. But barely was the standard set before manufacturers began to depart from it. Now virtually any board with capabilities beyond VGA might be called Super VGA. TIFF. Tagged Interchangeable File For- mat. This bitmapped graphics stan- dard is rapidly becoming the graphics equivalent of ASCII. Nearly all high- end graphics programs can export and import TIFF files. VGA. Video Graphics Array. This ad- vanced graphics adapter was intro- duced by IBM with its PS/2 iine of per- sonal computers. It's compatible with CGA, EGA, and MCGA.

DPI is also used to describe the sensftivity of a mouse to movement. See also ppi. DTP. DeskTop Publishing. Desktop pub- lishing is a term coined by Paul Brain- erd at Aldus to describe the ability of an individual to create a typeset page at his or her desk, thus marrying the jobs of editor, typesetter, layout artist, and printer. With so many responsibili- ties, the desktop publisher must have multiple skills because amateur efforts in any of these areas stand out even to the untrained eye. font. Technically, a font is an individual typeface in a particular style and of a par- ticular size. An example of a font is Times-Roman 12-point bold oblique. In computer and desktop publishing par- lance, Times-Roman is often called a font. Owing to the magic of scalable out- line fonts, an individual character can be changed almost infinitely m size from about 4 points to something in the hun- dreds of points, allowing variations of tenths or hundredths of points in be- tween. Italic (or oblique) type, boldface, underscore, and several other variations are called typestyles. Purists are disdain- ful of these corruptions of the ancient lan- guage of typesetters. ink-jet. Ink-jet printers spray an image on paper in tiny droplets of water-solu- ble ink. Though they are billed as pro- ducing printouts indistinguishable from those of laser printers, the tenden- cy for the ink-jet nozzles to become clogged often results in telltale horizon- tal white lines through the image. Anoth- er drawback of ink-jet printers is the fact that the ink is susceptible to dam- age from moisture. laser. Laser is an acronym standing for Light Amplification through Stimulated Emissions of Radiation. It's a very dense, concentrated light beam capa- ble of crossing great distances with lit- tle degradation of power. Lasers are at the heart of much of the most exciting computer technology, and they may soon drive computers themselves.

Lasers have even been put to use in optical mice, laser printers, and hand scanners for import- ing graphic images. Laser printers use the laser beam to charge a light-sensi- tive coating on a drum in a manner sim- ilar to that of a photocopier. The drum is then exposed to charged toner par- ticles that cling to the drum. Paper with an even greater electrical charge is moved past the drum, and the parti- cles leap from the drum to the paper, which is then heated to a temperature high enough to melt and bond the ton- er particles to the paper. PostScript. PostScript is an interpreted computer language from Adobe Sys- tems specially designed to make up pages, and thus it's known as a page- description language. When a page is created with PostScript, it's sent to the printer, not as a series of byte values to describe individual points on the page (which is how most graphics informa- tion is sent to printers), but as defini- tions of lines to be drawn, fonts to be used, and text to be printed in the spec- ified fonts, These instructions are then interpreted by the pnnter and, through the liardware of a laser printer or type- setter, turned into a printed page. 14 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 ppi. Points Per Inch. Dissatisfied with the standard means of expressing a mouse's sensitivity to movement in terms of dots per inch (dpi), Microsoft invented points per inch.

Technically, a typeface de- scribes the appearance of a set of char- acters regardless of their size. Times- Roman 12-point and Times-Roman 14- point are different fonts in the same typeface. In computer and desktop piib- lishing parlance, typeface and fonfare often used to refer to the same thing. The two most popular typefaces are Times Roman and Helvetica. typestyle. Typestyle is a new expres- sion created by desktop publishers to further describe the appearance of a font. Italic, boldface, shadow, outline, underline, super- and subscript, grayed, strikeout, and plain are the stan- dard typestyles. COMMUNICATIONS AND PERIPH^ALS AUX. Auxiliary. AUX is another way in DOS to refer to communications port 1 orCOf\\/l1. baud. Baud is a measure of the speed at which bits of information are sent or received over communications lines such as those used with a modem. Al- though the two don't mean the same thing, baud and bits per second (bps) are used interchangeably. BBS. Bulletin Board System. A BBS of- fers a convenient way to communicate with fellow computer enthusiasts and ac- quire copies of programs, picture files, and so on via a modem. The pro- grams available on BBSs are usually shareware, which means you can try a program before you buy it. COM. Connmuntcatjons. This is a DOS device name used in connection with serial ports and is usually reserved for communications with a modem. There are, however, serial printers, for exam- ple, that must be connected to the com- puter through a serial port. To connect a serial printer to the computer, the MODE command is used to tell the sys- tem where to find the printer.

Most mice can be programmed for use with nonmouse applications. NUL. Null. This is a DOS device used to hide output that usually appears on the screen. It can also be used with the CTTY command to hide all stan- dard screen output during the execu- tion of a batch file. parallel port. Parallel ports allow your computer to connect to devices such as printers that use parallel interfacing. Usually, parallel ports send information from the computer to an attached de- vice but don't receive information. A sys- tem with one paraltel port recognizes the port as LPT1. Information is proc- essed over eight wires, and each sig- nal arrives at the printer at the same time (that is, in parallel). PRN. Printer. This is another DOS de- vice name used to refer to the printer connection. PRN can usually be used interchangeably with LPT. RS-232. In 1969, the EIA (Electronic In- dustries Association) established a stan- dard of communications between com- puters known as RS-232. Under this standard, an interface can have up to 25 wires connecting two devices. Most of the pins or wires have been as- signed a function by the EIA standard. RS-232 is a serial standard, which means data bits are sent one after an- other. Devices that are connected with an RS-232 cable include external modems, mice, and serial printers. serial port. A serial port lets you con- nect devices that communicate via a serial interface. Printers using an RS- 232 cable are one example. Other se- rial devices include modems, mice, and optical character readers. Unlike parallel ports, serial ports normally send and receive information. One sig- nal at a time is sent through the serial port, and the information is reassem- bled on the receiving end.

Ciicle Reader SsrvlcB Number 103 TEST LAB It seems like only yesterday that computer mavens were oohing and aahing over the wonders of the IBM PC and computerizing their bookkeeping as easy as 1-2-3. Now we have more power, speed, and applica- tions on the desktop than we could've imagined, and the origi- nal IBM PC crawls compared to today's speed demons. (Remem- ber waiting for the old 4.77-MH2 IBM PCs to boot?) Now the question isn't really whether you can afford a power desktop computer; its how much power you need and how you want it configured. This month's Test Lab looks at 11 desktop computers — some of them 386SX systems running at 20 MHz, the rest 486DX ma- chines humming along at 33 MHz. Why these two groups? Be- cause 20-MHz 386SXS and 33- MHz 486DXS are, respectively, the new entry-level and state-of- the-art systems. While everyone would prefer to buy the bigger, faster, more pow- erful systems, your pocketbook and needs will dictate the choice of a desktop. This month's Test Lab gives you reviews, bench- marks, and other relevant informa- tion to help you understand the technology and make an in- formed decision, ALR POWERFLEX 20SX It's a fact of life: Advances in new computer technology go hand in hand with obsolescence of the old. How do you combat comput- er obsolescence? ALR has taken a unique approach by creating a modular PC, and the ALR Power- Flex 20SX is a good example of this modular approach. With a footprint of only 14% inches wide by 16y2 inches deep by 6V^ inches high, the PowerFiex 20SX offers lots of expansion room in this baby-AT case, A single SVa-inch high-den- 18 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 ADVANCED LOBIC RESEARCH 3401 Jeronimo Irvine, CA S2718 (714) 581-6770 Lisi Price: From $1,195* Warranty: one year, aarts and labor sity floppy drive is mounted verti- cally at the right side of the ma- chine next to two vacant half- height bays which can be used for additional drives. An 82MB thin-line IDE hard / drive is also mounted verti- cally, next to the power sup- ply at the rear of the chassis; it's hidden from view when the sys- tem cover Is in place. The system includes five 16- bil expansion slots and one 8-bit slot, but since the VGA video card occupies one of the 16-bit slots, only four are available. Three megabytes of RAM was the configuration the review unit came supplied with, and this is ex- pandable to a maximum of SMB. The memory arrangement on the ALR PowerFiex is unique; The base memory of the motherboard is 1MB, which is composed of eight 256K x 4 DRAM chips. The additional 2MB of RAM comes in the form of 1MB SIMMs installed in two of the four SIMM sockets. By adding two more 1MB SIMfvls in the vacant sockets, you can reach the maximum configuration of SMB. The intermixing of DRAMs and SIMMs is certainly an unconven- tional method of configuring RAM. but there is an explanation for it. The PowerFiex motherboard is, in reality, a 286 motherboard, which accounts for the DRAM mem- ory configuration. When the CPU is upgraded to a 386 in the com- puter's modular architecture, the SIMM sockets provide a conven- ient, economical, and space-sav- ing means of adding additional RAM to the base 1MB. ■ Upgrading this 2B6-based sys- tem involves using a slot called the 386/1486 Feature Connector. The various configurations possi- :-rnvA\\\\v ble through CPU module up- grades are the SX PowerFiex (386SX/16MHZ), the PowerFiex 20SX {the model reviewed here), the PowerFiex 20CSX (the 20SX with an additional 32K static cache RAM), and the PowerFiex 486ASX (a 486ASX/20MHz mod- ule with BK static cache RAM). The documentation is good, al- though it attempts to cover all of the various configurations availa- ble for the PowerFiex in one main document, An Auxiliary System Configuration Guide covers your particular configuration. MS-DOS 5,0 comes preloaded on the hard drive, and the system disks and manuals are also pack- ed with the system, as well as a utilities disk providing video driv- ers and other useful system files. A Super VGA FlexView 2X moni- tor, which came as part of the en- semble, provided comfortable viewing with good color satura- tion and image resolution. While this modular approach may make good sense from an economic and manufacturing point of view, the PowerFiex 20SX's performance was consid- erably less than spectacular, TOM BENFORD Circle Reader Service Number 301 \"Prices for this computer system and the others vary according to the con- figuration/options chosen.

Like many computers on the market today, the COMPAQ has an all-in-one motherboard; the disk controller and other cards that would otherwise take up slots and add to the demands on the power supply are built into the motherboard of this COMPAQ. Consequently, COMPAQ can pack more computer compo- nents into a small area, and you can save on desk space. This model has one serial port, one par- allel port, and one VGA video port. If you find that your CAD pro- grams or large spreadsheets be- gin running a little slow, this com- puter supports an 80387 math coprocessor, which should help speed things up a little bit. The 386S/20N comes with 2MB of RAM and can take up to 8MB using SIMMs (Single In-line Mem- ory Modules); just about any nov- ice should be able to expand the memory. The case is very small — prob- ably the smallest case I've ever seen for a desktop mode!. With on- ly two expansion slots and one of them used by the modem shipped with this computer, you're left with only one open slot. These 16-bit slots should be able to handle just about any COMPAQ 20555 F.M. 149 Houston, TX 77070 (713) 370-0670 List Price: $2,348 configyred as reviewed Warranty: one year card, taut the system is clearly in- tended for someone with limited expansion needs. The 386s/ 20N comes with two drive bays, one housing a high- . 'i density 3y2-inch drive and the other housing a 60MB IDE drive. There are no ex- tra drive bays. Although small, the power supply appears to of- fer all that this machine needs. The video control adapter is ca- pable of providing 256 colors in 640 X 480 mode, which is pretty much standard these days. COM- PAQ includes a TSR program, ADAPT, that allows you to change a variety of video attributes from contrast to cursor size, all with the touch of a couple of keys. The COMPAQ Video Graphics Color (VGC) monitor that came with this review system offers graphics resolution of up to 640 X 480 pixels and is capable of dis- playing up to 256 colors. It also offers a VGA-compatible text res- olution of 720 X 400 pixels. On the front you'll find conveniently located controls, one for contrast and the other for brightness. While this review system came with a VGA monitor, I recommend a Super VGA monitor to take full advantage of the video control- ler's capabilities. The basic 2400-baud modem that comes with this computer seems to be compatible with most communications software. I checked the computer with Pro- comm and Aladdin, for example, and the modem worked fine. The keyboard feels heavy-duty; the keypress is somewhere be- tween a soft touch and a click. With a complement of 101 keys, this standard keyboard should meet the needs of most users. If your computer needs are modest and you feel more com- fortable buying from a well- known manufacturer with a repu- tation for quality, this COMPAQ could be an excellent choice. And if you're interested in a work- station for your company net- work, the 386S/20N is, again, an excellent candidate.

The graphics test limes the load of a complex color graphic incorporat- ing thousands of gradient dithered METHODOLOGY color \"washes\" within outlined forms. Since the gradients must be calculated on the fly, this test is par- ticularly indicative of the system's float- ing-point calculation capabilities. The Windows tests time how long it takes to load a Windows application and a Windows-based paint applica- tion graphic from within Windows. To guarantee accuracy and fair- ness to all systems tested, we ran each test three times, totally shutting down and rebooting each system in between each test pass to ensure that any on-board caching would not affect the results. We averaged the results of the three test passes and used the averaged figures for our reports. -TOM BENFORD. PRESIDENT COMPUTER PRODUCT TESTING SERVICES APRIL 1992 COMPUTE 19 TEST LAB CUMULUS GLC 486DX/33 I'm partial to products manufac- tured right here in the good old U.S.A. — provided they measure up to their foreign-manufactured counterparts in quality and price. I'm delighted to report that the Cumulus GLC 486DX/33 not only measured up to but even sur- passed my somewhat jaded expectations! Upon unpacking the box con- taining the CPU, I found a small American flag and a certificate which bore the signatures of the Cumulus personnel responsible for assembling, testing, perform- ing quality assurance checks, and packing the system. The signed certificate proclaimed that the GLC was \"proudly de- signed, built, and tested in the U.S.A.\" So we were off to a good start, and the deeper I dug into the box, the better it got. The GLC's low-profile CPU cab- inet (less than 4V2 inches tall) looks small but offers a surprising amount of expansion space thanks to excellent integration of the system board and essential I/O components. Four 16^bit ex- pansion slots (two full-length and two %-length) accommodate your peripheral boards. How CUMULUS COMPUTER 23500 Mercantile Rd. Cleveland, OH 44122 (216)464-221?

A vertical backplane connector accepts ex- pansion boards on both the left and the right sides of the back- plane—two rows of slots — a most efficient and well-engi- neered arrangement that maximiz- es all available space within the cabinet. MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.0 are both supplied with the sys- tem, along with a Logitech two- button serial mouse. To handle input and output chores, the GLC comes equipped with a single par- allel port and dual serial ports in addition to a 512K VGA video card. An excellent 101-key key- board with a light but firm touch comes as standard equipment with the Cumulus GLC 486DX/ 33. The keyboard features audi- ble key click; 12 function keys; and illuminated Num, Caps, and 20 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 Scroll lock indicators. Both 5%-inch 1.2MB and BYa- inch 1.44IViB floppy drives are buitt into the unit, with an 84fv1B IDE hard drive handling the mass- storage requirements. No addition- al bays are available to accept ad- ditional drives, although a secon- dary 3y2-inch hard drive could conceivably be mounted within the cabinet. The performance of the GLC is truly excellent, as evidenced by a Norton computing index rating of 72. The Intel 80486DX CPU is responsible for this blazing speed, and the chip's integrated math coprocessor handles even the most demanding number- crunching or CAD applications without a whimper. With 4MB of RAM, the GLC is armed and ready to do battle with the best of them. An optional VGA monitor with .28-mm dot pitch was supplied with the system, and it was a pleas- ure to use. Colors were rich and vibrant, the screen's resolution was tight, and there was no color bleed— eye fatigue is not a proo- lem with the Cumulus monitor. I found everything about the Cumulus GLC to be excellent; the qualify and care show through in every detail. The manuals sup- plied with the computer exempli- fy this in their organization and thoroughness. If you're thinking of moving up to a 486 machine, the Cumulus GLC is definitely worth your sehous consideration.

The 486D/33 uses a baby-AT case, measuring 6 inches tall by 16 inches deep by 16 inches wide. The excellent design and layout of the machine still provide plenty of room for expansion in this small-footprint case, however. Dell uses the 3yj-inch drive as A and the S'A-lnch drive as B, which is not the usual drive arrange- ment. A quick (14-ms average seek time) 82MB IDE hard drive Is mounted internally in the Dell ad- jacent to the power supply The review unit came equipped with DOS 5.0 already installed on the hard drive; the Mi- crosoft manual and a rich assort- ment of excellent documentation also came packed with the sys- tem unit. Rather than packing the floppy disks containing DOS 5.0 with the system, however, Dell in- cluded a utility called Dell Disk- ette Librarian on the hard drive. It facilitates making the three 3/?- inch 720K backup disks for the DOS system and ui ty files.

A Dell 14-inch UitraScan Super VGA monitor came with the PC, and its crisp, well-defined images and colors make it one of the nicest VGA monitors supplied for review here. Dell offers probably the best and most complete documenta- tion I've encountered with any PC system.

Better still, it offers you plenty of room to grow. The review unit from Gateway came with a Micronics mother- board and a Phoenix BIOS. I've never run into any compatibility problems with Micronics mother- boards, and the five available 16- bit expansion slots (out of seven) should be more than adequate for the expansion needs of most users. Although floating-point math calcuiation capabilities are built right into the 486 processor, there's a slot available for a Weitek math coprocessor if your number-crunching needs are tru- ly enormous and you decide to get one later. Most users will never need that option. Looking for lots of memory? You can expand the computer's standard 8MB of RAM up to 32MB on the system board — even more with a 32-bit memory expansion slot. The huge case on the Gate- way 486 reminds me of the old full-size cases of yesteryear. Three of its bays are exposed, al- lowing for two floppy drives and one other drive requiring front ac- cess. This Gateway sports a 24 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 GATEWAY 2000 610 Gateway Dr. H.

Though a little noisy, this drive is plenty fast. The keyboard has function keys both across the top and down the left-hand side of the key- board, and it offers other program- mable functions. Gateway's Crystal Scan 1024NI noninterlaced Super VGA monitor provides quick screen re- freshes with very little or no flick- er, and this monitor compares fa- vorably with other Super VGA monitors I've looked at. The video card that comes with the Gateway 486 is a Speed- Star with a Tseng Labs video con- troller. The one meg of RAM on the video card allows you to throw 256 colors at one time up on the screen with no problems in Super VGA mode. One thing many people seem to overlook when they buy com- puters is serviceability With this computer, if any one component goes, you can easily replace the part yourself, or your local serv- ice center can replace the part for you. The Gateway 486 comes with Microsoft Windows 3,0 and MS- DOS 5.0 — enough to get you up and running. While that's not as much software as other packag- es offer, by the time you pur- chase a 486-based machine, chances are you're experienced with computers and either have just the applications you need or know precisely what you'd like to buy. This computer would make an excellent choice as a networl^ file server. Another good use would be as a stand-alone in a CAD en- vironment. With the power of the 486 Micronics board and the stor- age capacity of the 200MB hard drive, drawings should come up in no time. With all it has to offer, this computer should please any power-hungry user looking for a high-performance system. PEER PLAUT Circle Reader Service Number 305 IhuNDER Board.

This KRIS system gives you EI- SA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture) rather than ISA{lndus- try Standard Architecture). The full 32-bit EISA bus can accommo- date standard 8-bit and 16-bit pe- ripheral cards as well as dedicat- ed 32-bit EISA cards. EISA is the hardware platform of tomorrow that is fast becoming a favorite to- day, since it offers much faster bus- processing speeds and expan- sion significantly beyond what is possible with ISA motherboards. The motherboard occupies about two-thirds of the large tow- er case, largely because of the dozens of discrete components (mostly chips) used for various computing functions. In this re- spect, the KRIS board differs sig- nificantly from many VLSI (Very KRIS TECHNOLOGIES 260 E. Grand Ave. S.

Instead, a system- board manual is supplied, along with another dedicated manual for the VGA video board and sep- arate data sheets for other com- ponent assemblies (disk drives, I/O cards, and so forth). fvlS-DOS 5.0 came already in- stalled on the 150MB full-height drive in the KRIS tower case. I I I I II I 1 I ','.'i',\\'.'i'.'.'.'.'''.'\\\\AVA\\^\\ was quite surprised to see a full- height drive on a machine like this, since I fully expected to see a half-height (or even a thin-line) IDE drive. Unfortunately, this drive slowed down the overall per- formance of the system consider- ably; while its average seek time was 15.42 milliseconds, its data transfer rate was only 490.4 kilo- bytes per second, The Norton computing index for the KRIS pegged it at a very respectable 70.5, but the slow speed of the The RAM cache is an extremely use- ful feature in today's 386- and 486- based PCs that, unfortunately, is fre- quently misunderstood- A cache is a section of memory separate from the main system mem- ory It works by intercepting repeti- tive tasks and data and holding them for immediate access when needed. As your computer process- es information, going to the cache is much faster than going to the disk. So in addition to reducing the amount of hard drive access re- quired to fetch this data, the cache greatly increases a system's overall information-processing speed. Many vendors offer external cach- es on their higher-end 386 models, and cache sizes typically range from 32K up to 256K. Separate memory chips (usually DRAMs) are required for populating the cache sockets, and the cost per kilobyte of RAtVI with these can be rather expensive compared to the cost of SIMtvls (Sin- gle In-Line Memory modules). RAM CACHES EXPLAINED The 486 systems have a giant head start over 386 systems, since there's a built-in 8K RAM cache inte- grated right into the i486 CPU itself and almost every 486 system pro- vides sockets for additional external caching as well. While the 8K cache doesn't sound tremendous, in reali- ty the i486's built-in 8K cache has the same power and capacity as a 32K external cache. The reason is that Intel's i486 chip uses four-way set-associative architecture. Here's how the chip architecture works. Typical 32K external caches are usually two-way set-associative, which means that they do compara- tive data associations (comparing the data stored In RAM with that cur- rently being requested by the user or program at that instant) using bid- irectional processes, as opposed to the i486's quad-process method. In practical terms this means that the i486 can find and use RAM-cached data faster and more efficiently— on a consistent basis— than external caches, which are often hit-or-mlss. The cache size you need de- pends on such factors as how much money you can spend on the system and additional DRAM chips to ex- pand the cache, what types of ap- plications you normally use, and how much of your computing Involves ac- cessing the same information over and over. Generally 32K is a practi- cal size for most users, since the vast majority (about 90 percent) of the data in use at any given time will remain In the cache until summoned by the user or program. Performance increases over a 32K cache with larger caches (64K, 128K, or 256K) are generally imperceptible except when you're usng the most de- manding applications. Even then, you'll have to carefully consider wheth- er the slight performance gains of- fered by larger caches will offset the extra expense involved in purchasing additional RAM chips. —TOM BENFORD.

With a machine this fast, you sometimes need to slow down to run certain appiicatJons. An illumi- nated LED panel on the front of the KRIS system shows whether you're running at the normal 33 fvlHz or the slower 25 MHz. A 1MB VGA video card in the review machine was connected to a 14-inch Super VGA monitor. I found the display bright and easy to view for extended peri- ods; the colors were rich and vi- brant, and the screen's resolution was quite good. A single parallel port and dual serial ports are provided for the I/O functions, and again the KRIS Tower surprised me. I ex- pected to find 9-pin serial ports (the usual configuration used on 286 and higher machines), but in- stead I found the older 25-pin D connectors for the serial ports. This necessitated using a 25-pin to 9-pin adapter to connect my trusty Microsoft mouse for use dur- ing the review. The KRIS SYSTEM 48E-3 has a lot going for it, especially its Ex- tended Industry Standard Archi- tecture. It would certainly provide a good starting point for anyone looking for a machine that won't be obsolete for many years to come and that offers plenty of room for future expansion, TOM BENFORD Circle Reader Service Number 31)6 28 COMPUTE APRIL 1992 LUCKY 486/33 The Lucky 486-33 has a rather iarge AT-style case (21 inches wide X 16% inches deep x 6'/2 inches high) with plenty of room for drives and other peripherals. The review unit was outfitted with both 3'/2-inch and 5'/i-inch high-density floppy drives as well as a 122MB IDE hard drive. An additional half-height drive bay is accessible from the front of the machine, and another half- height drive bay is available in- side the system for mounting an additional hard drive. The five- bay configuration is the accept- ed standard format for full-size AT- style cases like this one. There are eight 16-bit expan- sion slots built into the mother- board, but only six of these slots are vacant, since the I/O board and video board occupy two of them. Four of the six available can handle full-length cards, while the other two can accommo- date only half-length cards. A 1MB Super VGA card pro- vides plenty of video power for the ViewSonic 6 Super VGA col- or monitor supplied with the sys- tem, and color rendition is excel- lent. Video resolution on the .28- mm dot pitch display is crisp with no ghosting or image lag. You can expand RAM to a max- imum of 16MB using 1MB SIMMs or up to 64MB using 4MB SIMMs in the motherboard's 16SIMMsock- ets. A socket is also provided for a Weitek floating-poin"
