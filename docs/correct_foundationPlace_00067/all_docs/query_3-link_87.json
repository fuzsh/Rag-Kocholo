Engel, J. A. Anderson, S. C. Glotzer, M. Isobe, and E. P. Bernard, was chosen as the milestone article for 2013 by the journal's editorial board. This 2013 paper confirmed research published in 2011, in Physical Review Letters, with Etienne Bernard, on what really goes on in two-dimensional melting.

Current interests are in hard spheres, mainly the melting transition in two-dimensional disks and in two-dimensional melting, bosons (in collaboration with the experimental groups at ENS), and the theory of convergence and of coupling in Markov chains. Recent work in my research group has led to the redefinition of the dominant Markov-chain Monte Carlo paradigm, namely the Metropolis algorithm. This has already allowed us to propose powerful algorithms for particle systems, continuous spin models and long-range systems, and to obtain important physical results. Research on the beyond-Metropolis paradigm, together with applications in classical and quantum physics and its interfaces will likely be a focus of my research activity in the next few years.\n\nFast, approximation-free molecular simulation of the SPC/Fw water model using non-reversible Markov chains\n\nMany fields of computational science concern the sampling of configurations x from a distribution pi(x) which can often be written as pi(x) = exp[-beta E(x)] (that is, as a Boltzmann distribution). The configuration x then refers to the positions of thousands or millions of atoms with complicated, often long-ranged, interactions. Over the years, I have been interested in sampling methods which do not evaluate the energy E (or the difference of energies, or the gradient of E) in order to sample pi(x) = exp[-beta E(x)]. This is possible because of our use of the factorized Metropolis filter within the framework of the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In July 2024, finally, the manuscript [\"Fast, approximation-free molecular simulation ... \"] on which I had worked together with Philipp Höllmer and A. C. Maggs was published in the Journal \"Scientific Reports\". It actually proves that one can simulate large water systems (in our case, the SPC/Fw water model) without any approximation. We generate millions of samples, but absolutely do not know what is the energy of our configurations.\n\nThe remarkable efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in three paradoxes. First, the Markov process is non-reversible (that is, effectively out-of-equilibrium), yet its steady state coincides with the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. Second, the Boltzmann distribution exp(−βU) is sampled without any approximation and with great efficiency although the total potential U and its derivatives, the forces, are never evaluated. This sidesteps all the problems with limited-precision calculations of energies and forces. The third paradox is the bundling of O(N) independent decisions to interrupt the straight-line trajectory of the piecewise-deterministic Markov process into an expression that can be evaluated in constant time. The paper is openly accessible, and even all the computer code has been rendered open-source.\n\nFast, approximation-free molecular simulation of the SPC/Fw water model using non-reversible Markov chains\n\nLifted TASEP: a Bethe ansatz integrable paradigm for non-reversible Markov chains\n\nIn recent years, my colleagues and I have worked on a multitude of computational algorithms which improve on the classical methods. Specifically, we have worked on Monte Carlo algorithms based on non-reversible Markov chains. Such algorithms have had successes in applications but are generally difficult to analyze, resulting in a scarcity of exact results. In a recent manuscript Lifted TASEP: a Bethe ansatz integrable paradigm for non-reversible Markov chains with my colleague Fabian Essler (Oxford), we introduce the “lifted” TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process) as a paradigm for non-reversible Markov chains. Our model can be viewed as a second-generation lifting of the reversible Metropolis algorithm on a one-dimensional lattice and is exactly solvable by an unusual kind of coordinate Bethe ansatz. We establish the integrability of the model and present strong evidence that the lifting leads to relax- ation on shorter timescales than in the KPZ (Kardar–Parisi–Zhang) universality class.\n\nEvent-Chain Monte Carlo: Foundations, Applications, and Prospects\n\nIn the last decade, I've been very interested in non-reversible Markov chains, and in the event-chain Monte Carlo. What started (for us) as an ad-hoc Monte Carlo algorithm for hard spheres has morphed into a general method, with the conceptual underpinnings coming out clearer with time. In June 2021, my review Event-Chain Monte Carlo: Foundations, Applications, and Prospects was published in Frontiers in Physics. Access is open.\n\nFast sequential Markov chains\n\nAs many people know, the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method in the form of the Metropolis algorithm for reversible Markov chains, was discovered in 1953, by Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth (sic), Teller, and Teller (sic) in a landmark paper. But the authors not only discovered reversible Markov chains, they also implemented the first non-reversible Markov chain! The difference may be a bit difficult to understand here, on a website, but for a reversible Markov chain a move and its inverse must always be likely. This is realized if, in a system of N particles, at each time step, one picks a random particle and moves it through a random displacement (see my book for an explanation). But Metropolis et al. didn't implement it this way: At time 1, they moved particle 1, then at time 2, they moved particle 2, and so on until, at time N+1, the first particle is moved again. This is manifestly non-reversible, but still samples the Boltzmann distribution. In later research, over the decades, it was found that whether one uses the sequential algorithm or chooses particles randomly doesn't make a great deal of a difference. No big deal!\n\nIn June 2020, Liang Qin (Laboratoire de Physique, ENS), Philippe Hoellmer (University of Bonn) and I looked into a variant of the sequential Markov chain algorithm, but instead of going sequentially through particle indices, we go sequentially through the directions. In practice, all particles first move (for a long time) along the x-axis, then with an inclination of 1 degree, then 2 degrees, etc (see the above figure). We studied this not for hard disks (as Metropolis et al in 1953), but a simple model of an elastic dipole. What we found was really surprising: By sequentially going through the directions, one induces very persistent counter-clockwise rotation but then, after a while, another very persistent clockwise rotation follows. We were able to prove rigorously that if we replace the 1 degree change by an angle Delta Phi, then in the limit of small Delta Phi, the rolled-out angle diverges! However, we could also prove that the net rotation of the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations adds up to exactly zero. Finally, we showed numerically that the sequential Markov-chain algorithm is much faster than what we did before. The story is told in this paper.\n\nMultithreaded event-chain Monte Carlo with local times\n\nIn the last few years, our delocalized group has worked on a new paradigm of Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods that break detailed balance yet sample the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The algorithms go by the name of 'event-chain Monte Carlo', and as the name indicates, they are event-driven (this means: they hop from event to event, rather than from femto-second timestamp to femto-second timestamp). One of the problem of event-driven algorithms is that they were never successfully parallelized. Looking at today's computer architectures, which are massively parallel (either on GPUs or on shared-memory CPUs), this long provided a bleak outlook for the practical applications of ECMC.\n\nHowever, in a paper that recently appeared in Computer Physics Communications, Botao Li (from ENS), Synge Todo (from University of Tokyo), A. C. Maggs (from ESCPI Paris) and myself were able to present a multithreaded event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for hard spheres. Threads synchronize at infrequent breakpoints and otherwise scan for local horizon violations. On x86 and ARM processors, a C++ (OpenMP) implementation that uses compare-and-swap primitives for data access achieves considerable speed-up with respect to single-threaded code. The paper appeared in a computer physics journal, and there is a lot of computer-nerdy content in it (everything is open-source and all our C++ and Python programs are open-source and available on github) . However, there is also a lot of math in the paper, including real lemmas and their proofs, which at the beginning were not at all clear to us. We present a total of six algorithm (the final one goes really fast), and one of them (Algorithm 5) is rigorously proven to be without bugs, as we can map it onto an absorbing Markov chain with 3670 states, that we can analyze exactly (the picture gives a visual impression of the proof).\n\nPS: This is the first paper of Botao Li, first-year (now second-year) graduate student at ENS, and we are all very happy.\n\nJeLLyFysh-Version1.0 -- a Python application for all-atom event-chain Monte Carlo\n\nFor the last few years, the development of irreversible-Markov-chain methods for physics applications has been at a focus of our group's interest. Although we have constantly thought about algorithms (in particular about the event-chain algorithm), no general code was available. This changed during the week of 29 July 2019 where, on Monday, we posted a 50-page manuscript, that has since been accepted by Computer Physics Communications, and on Thursday (1 August 2019), when we pushed to first Version of the associated open-source Python application to GitHub (see https://github.com/jellyfysh, some 15,000 lines of Python3 code). Both works are authored by Philipp Höllmer, Liang Qin, Michael F. Faulkner, A. C. Maggs, and me, and we are all quite proud to have finished. The code is 100% open access (it suffices to go onto the GitHub website and to fork it by clicking on a button). By the way, the program's name is JeLLyFysh (because we think that it will be very helpful to treat systems mostly with water, and some other stuff).\n\nAll-atom Coulomb simulations with irreversible Markov chains\n\nIn a nutshell, classical molecular-dynamics simulations consist in computing the forces on particles, at discretized time steps, and in moving these particles in accordance with Newton's law of motion, the famous F=ma. Likewise (in a nutshell), classical Monte Carlo calculations consist in proposing a move, then in computing the change of the total system energy, and then accepting or rejecting the move with a probability given by the Metropolis filter. How to compute the forces (for molecular dynamics) or the energies (for Monte Carlo) is a science in its own right, whenever the interactions are long-ranged, as for the Coulomb potential. Much used elaborate methods go by the names of PP (for particle-particle) or PPPM (for particle-particle / particle-mesh), or else particle-mesh Ewald etc. They have in common that much ingenuity is applied to compute a quantity (force / energy) that, as we claimed a few years ago, is not needed to drive the system forward! For a recent article in Journal of Chemical Physics, I teamed up with Michael Faulkner, Liang Qin, and Anthony C. Maggs, to show how this can be done in practice. In what, internally, we call our 'Proof-of-Concept paper', we explicitly show how to set up a highly efficient algorithm to simulate a model of liquid water. We indeed confirm that it is possible to sample the Boltzmann distribution (which involves the Boltzmann weight, and therefore the system energy), without computing the energy. As often, the difference lies in the subtle difference between the concepts of 'sampling' (that is, obtaining examples of a certain distribution) and of 'computing' (for example computing the energy). Technically, we succeed in drawing independent samples with a complexity 'N' log 'N' (just like the best PPPM algorithms but, we think, much faster). Now, of course, after the first excitement of our 'confirmation paper', we are all excited by the forthcoming 'benchmark paper', where we will compare not only complexities, but actual running times.\n\nThermodynamic phases in two-dimensional active matter\n\nActive matter (for example the collective dynamics of flocks of birds, of schools of fish, etc) is a very active field of research in statistical physics. However, active matter cannot really be described by equilibrium statistical theory where the state of what is called the system is fully characterized by two numbers (for example the volume and the pressure), and where the statistical weight of each configuration can be attributed an energy E, and a statistical Boltzmann weight exp(-beta E) which depends on the energy alone. Many active materials are two-dimensional (ranging from sheep on a meadow to bacterial colonies to artificial Janus particles on a glass place. As we are so much interested in regular two-dimensional particle systems (that are described by equilibrium statistical physics), we posed the question of whether there was some kind of continuous passage between the two types of models. Teaming up with Juliane U. Klamser and Sebastian C. Kapfer, we studied this question in detail. Our conclusions were published, in November 2018, in Nature Communications.\n\nIrreversible local Markov chains with rapid convergence towards equilibrium\n\nMonte Carlo algorithms, generally satisfy the detailed balance condition, which prescribes that in the limit of infinite times, the probability flow from a configuration a to a configuration b equals the flow from b to a. This may seem terrible abstract, but it simply means that if, in a room full of air molecules, each molecule moves to the left and to the right with the same probability (and sometimes does not move at all, because there is already another particle where it wants to go), the density of air will be more or less uniform. In a recent paper with Sebastian Kapfer, in Physical Review Letters, we systematically studied irreversible local Markov chain, that is, Monte Carlo algorithms which only satisfy the global balance condition, but not the detailed balance (in the example of the air-filled room, this corresponds to algorithms where the molecules are much more likely to move in one direction than the other, but where the asymptotic density is still uniform). We considered the case of hard-sphere gases in one spatial dimension with periodic boundary conditions and, to our greatest surprise, came up with Markov chains such as the 'forward Metropolis algorithm' or the 'lifted forward Metropolis algorithm', or even the 'lifted forward Metropolis algorithm with restart' that mix much faster than the usual methods, although they reach exactly the same steady state in the limit of infinite times. We even made contact with the vast research literature on the TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), a discrete variant of our Markov chains. We are all the more excited that the algorithms studied are but special versions of the event-chain algorithm, that we used a lot during the last years.\n\nContinue with Past Research Notices\n\nUpcoming events\n\nNew York, NY (USA), D.
