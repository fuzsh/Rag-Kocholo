        "text": "Edwards statistical mechanics for jammed granular matter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaule, Adrian; Morone, Flaviano; Herrmann, Hans J.; Makse, HernÃ¡n A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed matterâone of the very few generalizations of Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanics to out-of-equilibrium matterâhas garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists. Its importance stems from the fact that jammed states of matter are ubiquitous in nature appearing in a broad range of granular and soft materials such as colloids, emulsions, glasses, and biomatter. Indeed, despite being one of the simplest states of matterâprimarily governed by the steric interactions between the constitutive particlesâa theoretical understanding based on first principles has proved exceedingly challenging. Here a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble is reviewed. The construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems, is discussed. The importance of approximation schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions underlying Edwards approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from spherical to nonspherical shapes such as dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse, and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is discussed providing\n\nThe glass and jamming transitions in dense granular matter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoulais, Corentin; Candelier, RaphaÃ«l; Dauchot, Olivier\n\n2013-06-01\n\nEveryday life tells us that matter acquires rigidity either when it cools down, like lava flows which turn into solid rocks, or when it is compacted, like tablets simply formed by powder compression. As suggested by these examples, solidification is not the sole privilege of crystals but also happens for disordered media such as glass formers, granular media, foams, emulsions and colloidal suspensions. Fifteen years ago the \"Jamming paradigm\" emerged to encompass in a unique framework the glass transition and the emergence of yield stress, two challenging issues in modern condensed matter physics. One must realize how bold this proposal was, given that the glass transition is a finite temperature transition governing the dynamical properties of supercooled liquids, while Jamming is essentially a zero temperature, zero external stress and purely geometric transition which occurs when a given packing of particles reaches the maximum compression state above which particles start to overlap. More recently, the observation of remarkable scaling properties on the approach to jamming led to the conjecture that this zero temperature \"critical point\" could determine the properties of dense particle systems within a region of the parameter space to be determined, which in principle could include thermal and stressed systems. Fifteen years of intense theoretical and experimental work later, what have we learned about Jamming and glassy dynamics? In this paper, we discuss these issues in the light of the experiments we have been conducting with vibrated grains.\n\nDynamic shear jamming in granular suspensions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeters, Ivo; Majumdar, Sayantan; Jaeger, Heinrich\n\n2014-11-01\n\nJamming by shear allows a frictional granular packing to transition from an unjammed state into a jammed state while keeping the system volume and average packing fraction constant. Shear jamming of dry granular media can occur quasi-statically, but boundaries are crucial to confine the material. We perform experiments in aqueous starch suspension where we apply shear using a rheometer with a large volume (400 ml) cylindrical Couette cell. In our suspensions the packing fraction is sufficiently low that quasi-static deformation does not induce a shear jammed state. Applying a shock-like deformation however, will turn the suspension into a jammed solid. A fully jammed state is reached within tens of microseconds, and can be sustained for at least several seconds. High speed imaging of the initial process reveals a jamming front propagating radially outward through the suspension, while the suspension near the outer boundary remains quiescent. This indicates that granular suspensions can be shear jammed without the need of confining solid boundaries. Instead, confinement is most likely provided by the dynamics in the front region.\n\nConfocal Microscopy of Jammed Matter: From Elasticity to Granular Thermodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJorjadze, Ivane\n\nPackings of particles are ubiquitous in nature and are of interest not only to the scientific community but also to the food, pharmaceutical, and oil industries. In this thesis we use confocal microscopy to investigate packing geometry and stress transmission in 3D jammed particulate systems. By introducing weak depletion attraction we probe the accessible phase-space and demonstrate that a microscopic approach to jammed matter gives validity to statistical mechanics framework, which is intriguing because our particles are not thermally activated. We show that the fluctuations of the local packing parameters can be successfully captured by the recently proposed 'granocentric' model, which generates packing statistics according to simple stochastic processes. This model enables us to calculate packing entropy and granular temperature, the so-called 'compactivity', therefore, providing a basis for a statistical mechanics of granular matter. At a jamming transition point at which there are formed just enough number of contacts to guarantee the mechanical stability, theoretical arguments suggest a singularity which gives rise to the surprising scaling behavior of the elastic moduli and the microstructure, as observed in numerical simulations. Since the contact network in 3D is typically hidden from view, experimental test of the scaling law between the coordination number and the applied pressure is lacking in the literature. Our data show corrections to the linear scaling of the pressure with density which takes into account the creation of contacts. Numerical studies of vibrational spectra, in turn, reveal sudden features such as excess of low frequency modes, dependence of mode localization and structure on the pressure. Chapter four describes the first calculation of vibrational density of states from the experimental 3D data and is in qualitative agreement with the analogous computer simulations. We study the configurational role of the pressure and demonstrate\n\nJamming by compressing a system of granular crosses\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Hu; Wang, Dong; BarÃ©s, Jonathan; Behringer, Robert\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA disordered stress-free granular packing can be jammed, transformed into a mechanically rigid structure, by increasing the density of particles or by applying shear deformation. The jamming behavior of systems made of 2D circular discs has been investigated in detail, but very little is known about jamming for non-spherical particles, and particularly, non-convex particles. Here, we perform an experimental study on jamming by compression of a system of quasi-2D granular crosses made of photo-elastic crosses. We measure the pressure evolution during cyclic compression and decompression. The Jamming packing fraction of these quasi-2D granular crosses is ÏJ â 0.475, which is much smaller than the value ÏJ â 0.84 for-2D granular disks. The packing fraction shifts systematically to higher values under compressive cycling, corresponding to systematic shifts in the stress-strain response curves. Associated with these shifts are rotations of the crosses, with minimal changes in their centers of mass.\n\nThe thermodynamics of dense granular flow and jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Shih Yu\n\nThe scope of the thesis is to propose, based on experimental evidence and theoretical validation, a quantifiable connection between systems that exhibit the jamming phenomenon. When jammed, some materials that flow are able to resist deformation so that they appear solid-like on the laboratory scale. But unlike ordinary fusion, which has a critically defined criterion in pressure and temperature, jamming occurs under a wide range of conditions. These condition have been rigorously investigated but at the moment, no self-consistent framework can apply to grains, foam and colloids that may have suddenly ceased to flow. To quantify the jamming behavior, a constitutive model of dense granular flows is deduced from shear-flow experiments. The empirical equations are then generalized, via a thermodynamic approach, into an equation-of-state for jamming. Notably, the unifying theory also predicts the experimental data on the behavior of molecular glassy liquids. This analogy paves a crucial road map for a unifying theoretical framework in condensed matter, for example, ranging from sand to fire retardants to toothpaste.\n\nJamming for a system of granular crosses\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShang, Zegan; Zheng, Hu; Wang, Dong; Bares, Jonathan; Behringer, Robert\n\nA disordered stress-free granular packing can be turned into a rigid structure, which is called jammed state, by increasing the density of particles per unit volume or by applying shear deformation. The jamming behavior of systems made of of 2D circular discs have been investigated in detail, but very little is known about the special geometry particles, particularly non-convex particles like crosses. Here, we perform an experimental study on the jamming of a system of quasi-2D granular crosses. In the present experiments, we measure the pressure, and coordinate number evolution of a 2D packing of photo-elastic cross discs. This talk will present results from a simple shear experiment for stresses and for the order parameter associated with the cross orientation and its correlation.

However, a new approach, based on layer-wise deployment of predetermined patterns of the fiber reinforcement has led self-confining and free-standing jammed structures to become viable. We have developed a novel model to simulate fiber-reinforced granular materials, which takes into account irregular particles and wire elasticity and apply it to study the stability of unconfined jammed granular columns.\n\nFragility and hysteretic creep in frictional granular jamming.\n\nPubMed\n\nBandi, M M; Rivera, M K; Krzakala, F; Ecke, R E\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe granular jamming transition is experimentally investigated in a two-dimensional system of frictional, bidispersed disks subject to quasistatic, uniaxial compression without vibrational disturbances (zero granular temperature). Three primary results are presented in this experimental study. First, using disks with different static friction coefficients (Î¼), we experimentally verify numerical results that predict jamming onset at progressively lower packing fractions with increasing friction. Second, we show that the first compression cycle measurably differs from subsequent cycles. The first cycle is fragile-a metastable configuration with simultaneous jammed and unjammed clusters-over a small packing fraction interval (Ï(1)<Ï<Ï(2)) and exhibits simultaneous exponential rise in pressure and exponential decrease in disk displacements over the same packing fraction interval. This fragile behavior is explained through a percolation mechanism of stressed contacts where cluster growth exhibits spatial correlation with disk displacements and contributes to recent results emphasizing fragility in frictional jamming. Control experiments show that the fragile state results from the experimental incompatibility between the requirements for zero friction and zero granular temperature. Measurements with several disk materials of varying elastic moduli E and friction coefficients Î¼ show that friction directly controls the start of the fragile state but indirectly controls the exponential pressure rise. Finally, under repetitive loading (compression) and unloading (decompression), we find the system exhibits pressure hysteresis, and the critical packing fraction Ï(c) increases slowly with repetition number. This friction-induced hysteretic creep is interpreted as the granular pack's evolution from a metastable to an eventual structurally stable configuration. It is shown to depend on the quasistatic step size ÎÏ, which provides the only perturbative mechanism in the\n\nTuning strain of granular matter by basal assisted Couette shear\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Yiqiu; BarÃ©s, Jonathan; Zheng, Hu; Behringer, Robert\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe present a novel Couette shear apparatus capable of generating programmable azimuthal strain inside 2D granular matter under Couette shear. The apparatus consists of 21 independently movable concentric rings and two boundary wheels with frictional racks. This makes it possible to quasistatically shear the granular matter not only from the boundaries but also from the bottom. We show that, by specifying the collective motion of wheels and rings, the apparatus successfully generates the desired strain profile inside the sample granular system, which is composed of about 2000 photoelastic disks. The motion and stress of each particle is captured by an imaging system utilizing reflective photoelasticimetry. This apparatus provides a novel method to investigate shear jamming properties of granular matter with different interior strain profiles and unlimited strain amplitudes.\n\nDiscrete-element simulation of sea-ice mechanics: Contact mechanics and granular jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDamsgaard, A.; Adcroft, A.; Sergienko, O. V.; Stern, A. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLagrangian models of sea-ice dynamics offer several advantages to Eulerian continuum methods. Spatial discretization on the ice-floe scale is natural for Lagrangian models, which additionally offer the convenience of being able to handle arbitrary sea-ice concentrations. This is likely to improve model performance in ice-marginal zones with strong advection. Furthermore, phase transitions in granular rheology around the jamming limit, such as observed when sea ice moves through geometric confinements, includes sharp thresholds in effective viscosity which are typically ignored in Eulerian models. Granular jamming is a stochastic process dependent on having the right grains in the right place at the right time, and the jamming likelihood over time can be described by a probabilistic model. Difficult to parameterize in continuum formulations, jamming occurs naturally in dense granular systems simulated in a Lagrangian framework, and is a very relevant process controlling sea-ice transport through narrow straits. We construct a flexible discrete-element framework for simulating Lagrangian sea-ice dynamics at the ice-floe scale, forced by ocean and atmosphere velocity fields. Using this framework, we demonstrate that frictionless contact models based on compressive stiffness alone are unlikely to jam, and describe two different approaches based on friction and tensile strength which both result in increased bulk shear strength of the granular assemblage. The frictionless but cohesive contact model, with certain tensile strength values, can display jamming behavior which on the large scale is very similar to a more complex and realistic model with contact friction and ice-floe rotation.\n\nUnifying Suspension and Granular flows near Jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeGiuli, Eric; Wyart, Matthieu\n\n2017-06-01\n\nRheological properties of dense flows of hard particles are singular as one approaches the jamming threshold where flow ceases, both for granular flows dominated by inertia, and for over-damped suspensions. Concomitantly, the lengthscale characterizing velocity correlations appears to diverge at jamming. Here we review a theoretical framework that gives a scaling description of stationary flows of frictionless particles. Our analysis applies both to suspensions and inertial flows of hard particles. We report numerical results in support of the theory, and show the phase diagram that results when friction is added, delineating the regime of validity of the frictionless theory.\n\nStatistical mechanics framework for static granular matter.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenkes, Silke; Chakraborty, Bulbul\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThe physical properties of granular materials have been extensively studied in recent years. So far, however, there exists no theoretical framework which can explain the observations in a unified manner beyond the phenomenological jamming diagram. This work focuses on the case of static granular matter, where we have constructed a statistical ensemble which mirrors equilibrium statistical mechanics. This ensemble, which is based on the conservation properties of the stress tensor, is distinct from the original Edwards ensemble and applies to packings of deformable grains. We combine it with a field theoretical analysis of the packings, where the field is the Airy stress function derived from the force and torque balance conditions. In this framework, Point J characterized by a diverging stiffness of the pressure fluctuations. Separately, we present a phenomenological mean-field theory of the jamming transition, which incorporates the mean contact number as a variable. We link both approaches in the context of the marginal rigidity picture proposed by Wyart and others.\n\nUniform shock waves in disordered granular matter.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ³mez, Leopoldo R; Turner, Ari M; Vitelli, Vincenzo\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe confining pressure P is perhaps the most important parameter controlling the properties of granular matter. Strongly compressed granular media are, in many respects, simple solids in which elastic perturbations travel as ordinary phonons. However, the speed of sound in granular aggregates continuously decreases as the confining pressure decreases, completely vanishing at the jamming-unjamming transition. This anomalous behavior suggests that the transport of energy at low pressures should not be dominated by phonons. In this work we use simulations and theory to show how the response of granular systems becomes increasingly nonlinear as pressure decreases. In the low-pressure regime the elastic energy is found to be mainly transported through nonlinear waves and shocks. We numerically characterize the propagation speed, shape, and stability of these shocks and model the dependence of the shock speed on pressure and impact intensity by a simple analytical approach.\n\nEquation of state of wet granular matter.\n\nPubMed\n\nFingerle, A; Herminghaus, S\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAn expression for the near-contact pair correlation function of D -dimensional weakly polydisperse hard spheres is presented, which arises from elementary free-volume arguments. Its derivative at contact agrees very well with our simulations for D=2 . For jammed states, the expression predicts that the number of exact contacts is equal to 2D, in agreement with established simulations. When the particles are wetted, they interact by the formation and rupture of liquid capillary bridges. Since formation and rupture events of capillary bonds are well separated in configuration space, the interaction is hysteretic with a characteristic energy loss Ecb. The pair correlation is strongly affected by this capillary interaction depending on the liquid-bond status of neighboring particles. A theory is derived for the nonequilibrium probability currents of the capillary interaction which determines the pair correlation function near contact. This finally yields an analytic expression for the equation of state, P=P(N/V,T), of wet granular matter for D=2, valid in the complete density range from gas to jamming.

We observe the development of transient clusters of jammed particles within the flow. Typical size of such clusters is found to scale with the inertial number with a power law that is similar to the scaling of shear-rate profile relaxation lengths observed previously. Based on the simple argument that transient clusters of size l exist in the dense flow regime, the formulation of steady state condition for non-homogeneous shear flow results in a general non-local relation, which is similar in form to the non-local relation conjectured for soft glassy flows. These findings suggest the formation of jammed clusters to be the key micro-mechanism underpinning non-local behaviour in dense granular flows.

P. F.; Kolb, E.; Combe, G.; Paiva, H. A.; Martins, G. H. B.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nExperiments of penetration of a cylindrical intruder inside a bidimensional dense and disordered granular media were reported recently showing the jamming / unjamming transition. In the present work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations with the same geometry in order to assess both kinematic and static features of jamming / unjamming transition. We study the statistics of the particles velocities at the neighborhood of the intruder to evince that both experiments and simulations present the same qualitative behavior. We observe that the probability density functions (PDF) of velocities deviate from Gaussian depending on the packing fraction of the granular assembly. In order to quantify these deviations we consider a q-Gaussian (Tsallis) function to fit the PDF's. The q-value can be an indication of the presence of long range correlations along the system. We compare the fitted PDF's obtained with those obtained using the stretched exponential, and sketch some conclusions concerning the nature of the correlations along a granular confined flow.\n\nNonlocal rheological properties of granular flows near a jamming limit.\n\nPubMed\n\nAranson, Igor S; Tsimring, Lev S; Malloggi, Florent; ClÃ©ment, Eric\n\n2008-09-01\n\nWe study the rheology of sheared granular flows close to a jamming transition. We use the approach of partially fluidized theory (PFT) with a full set of equations extending the thin layer approximation derived previously for the description of the granular avalanches phenomenology. This theory provides a picture compatible with a local rheology at large shear rates [G. D. R. Midi, Eur. Phys. J. E 14, 341 (2004)] and it works in the vicinity of the jamming transition, where a description in terms of a simple local rheology comes short. We investigate two situations displaying important deviations from local rheology. The first one is based on a set of numerical simulations of sheared soft two-dimensional circular grains. The next case describes previous experimental results obtained on avalanches of sandy material flowing down an incline. Both cases display, close to jamming, significant deviations from the now standard Pouliquen's flow rule [O. Pouliquen, Phys. Fluids 11, 542 (1999); 11, 1956 (1999)]. This discrepancy is the hallmark of a strongly nonlocal rheology and in both cases, we relate the empirical results and the outcomes of PFT. The numerical simulations show a characteristic constitutive structure for the fluid part of the stress involving the confining pressure and the material stiffness that appear in the form of an additional dimensionless parameter. This constitutive relation is then used to describe the case of sandy flows. We show a quantitative agreement as far as the effective flow rules are concerned. A fundamental feature is identified in PFT as the existence of a jammed layer developing in the vicinity of the flow arrest that corroborates the experimental findings. Finally, we study the case of solitary erosive granular avalanches and relate the outcome with the PFT analysis.\n\nExperimental investigation of granular dynamics close to the jamming transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCaballero, G.; Kolb, E.; Lindner, A.; Lanuza, J.; ClÃ©ment, E.\n\n2005-06-01\n\nWe present different experiments on dense granular assemblies with the aim of clarifying the notion of 'jamming transition' for these assemblies of non-Brownian particles. The experimental set-ups differ in the way in which external perturbations are applied in order to unjam the systems. The first experiment monitors the response to a locally applied deformation of a model packing at rest. The two other experiments study local and collective dynamics in a granular assembly weakly excited by vibration.\n\nStability of Granular Packings Jammed under Gravity: Avalanches and Unjamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMerrigan, Carl; Birwa, Sumit; Tewari, Shubha; Chakraborty, Bulbul\n\nGranular avalanches indicate the sudden destabilization of a jammed state due to a perturbation. We propose that the perturbation needed depends on the entire force network of the jammed configuration. Some networks are stable, while others are fragile, leading to the unpredictability of avalanches. To test this claim, we simulated an ensemble of jammed states in a hopper using LAMMPS. These simulations were motivated by experiments with vibrated hoppers where the unjamming times followed power-law distributions. We compare the force networks for these simulated states with respect to their overall stability. The states are classified by how long they remain stable when subject to continuous vibrations. We characterize the force networks through both their real space geometry and representations in the associated force-tile space, extending this tool to jammed states with body forces.

However, the stress-strain relation in shear jamming transition is not very well understood. Part of the difficulty is that the strain inside the granular system is very complicated and hard to control. In this work, by using a novel Couette shear apparatus capable of generating arbitrary shear profiles, we study the stress-strain relation during shear jamming transition for granular system under different kinds of controlled interior strain. The novel Couette shear apparatus consists of 21 independently movable rings and two circular boundaries. The apparatus can shear the granular sample not only from the boundaries but also from the bottom. The granular sample is made of about 2000 bi-disperse photo elastic disks, making it possible to extract force information.

Soft tissue stiffness is simulated by changing the stiffness property of the actuator during palpation. For the first time, granular jamming and pneumatic air actuation are combined to realize stiffness modulation. The stiffness feedback actuator is validated by stiffness measurements in indentation tests and through stiffness discrimination based on a user study. According to the indentation test results, the introduction of a pneumatic chamber to granular jamming can amplify the stiffness variation range and reduce hysteresis of the actuator. The advantage of multi-fingered palpation using the proposed actuators is proven by the comparison of the results of the stiffness discrimination performance using two-fingered (sensitivity: 82.2%, specificity: 88.9%, positive predicative value: 80.0%, accuracy: 85.4%, time: 4.84 s) and single-fingered (sensitivity: 76.4%, specificity: 85.7%, positive predicative value: 75.3%, accuracy: 81.8%, time: 7.48 s) stiffness feedback.\n\nJamming of three-dimensional prolate granular materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nDesmond, K; Franklin, Scott V\n\n2006-03-01\n\nWe have found that the ability of long thin rods to jam into a solidlike state in response to a local perturbation depends upon both the particle aspect ratio and the container size. The dynamic phase diagram in this parameter space reveals a broad transition region separating granular stick-slip and solidlike behavior. In this transition region the pile displays both solid and stick-slip behavior. We measure the force on a small object pulled through the pile, and find the fluctuation spectra to have power law tails with an exponent characteristic of the region. The exponent varies from beta=-2 in the stick-slip region to beta=-1 in the solid region. These values reflect the different origins--granular rearrangements vs dry friction--of the fluctuations. Finally, the packing fraction shows only a slight dependence on container size, but depends on aspect ratio in a manner predicted by mean-field theory and implies an aspect-ratio-independent contact number of =5.25 +/- 0.03.\n\nStochastic transitions and jamming in granular pipe flow\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrand, Samuel; Ball, Robin C.; Nicodemi, Mario\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe study a model granular suspension driven down a channel by an embedding fluid via computer simulations.

For packing fractions below a threshold Ïm, granular flow is disordered and exhibits an Ostwald-de Waele-type power-law shear-stress constitutive relation. Above Ïm, two asymptotic states exist; disordered flow can persist indefinitely, yet, in a fraction of samples, the system self-organizes in an ordered form of flow where grains move in parallel ordered layers. In the latter regime, the Ostwald-de Waele relationship breaks down and a nearly solid plug appears in the center, with linear shear regions at the boundaries. Above a higher threshold Ïg, an abrupt jamming transition is observed if ordering is avoided.\n\nUniversal robotic gripper based on the jamming of granular material\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrown, Eric; Rodenberg, Nicholas; Amend, John; Mozeika, Annan; Steltz, Erik; Zakin, Mitchell R.; Lipson, Hod; Jaeger, Heinrich M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nGripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current designs are based on the multifingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less than 0.5% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms, friction, suction, and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force. Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the jammed state. This advance opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.\n\nFlow and Jamming of Granular Materials in a Two-dimensional Hopper\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTang, Junyao\n\nFlow in a hopper is both a fertile testing ground for understanding fundamental granular flow rheology and industrially highly relevant. Despite increasing research efforts in this area, a comprehensive physical theory is still lacking for both jamming and flow of granular materials in a hopper. In this work, I have designed a two dimensional (2D) hopper experiment using photoelastic particles (particles' shape: disk or ellipse), with the goal to build a bridge between macroscopic phenomenon of hopper flow and microscopic particle-scale dynamics. Through synchronized data of particle tracking and stress distributions in particles, I have shown differences between my data of the time-averaged velocity/stress profile of 2D hopper flow with previous theoretical predictions. I have also demonstrated the importance of a mechanical stable arch near the opening on controlling hopper flow rheology and suggested a heuristic phase diagram for the hopper flow/jamming transition. Another part of this thesis work is focused on studying the impact of particle shape of particles on hopper flow. By comparing particle-tracking and photoelastic data for ellipses and disks at the appropriate length scale, I have demonstrated an important role for the rotational freedom of elliptical particles in controlling flow rheology through particle tracking and stress analysis.

C.; Cassotto, R.; Amundson, J. M.; Kuo, C. C.; Dennin, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn tidewater glacial fjords, the open water in front of the glacier terminus is often filled with a collection of calved iceberg fragments and sea ice. For glaciers with large calving rates, this \"mÃ©lange\" of ice can be jam-packed, so that the flow is mostly determined by granular interactions, in addition to underlying fjord currents. As the glacier pushes the ice mÃ©lange through the fjord, the mÃ©lange will become jammed and may potentially influence calving rates if the back-stress applied to the glacier terminus is large enough. However, the stress applied by a granular ice mÃ©lange will depend on its rheology, i.e. iceberg-iceberg contact forces, geometry, friction, etc. Here we report 2D, discrete particle simulations to model the granular mechanics of ice mÃ©lange. A polydisperse collection of particles is packed into a long channel and pushed downfjord at a constant speed, the latter derived from terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI). Each individual particle experiences viscoelastic contact forces and tangential frictional forces upon collision with another particle or channel walls. We find the two most important factors that govern the total force applied to the glacier are the geometry of the channel, and the shape of the particles. In addition, our simulated velocity fields reveal shearing margins near the fjord walls with more uniform flow in the middle of the mÃ©lange, consistent with TRI observations. Finally, we find that the magnitude of the back-stress applied to the glacier terminus can influence calving, however, the maximum back-stress is limited by the buckling of icebergs into the fjord waters, so that the stress in the quasi-2D mÃ©lange is partially determined by the thickness of the mÃ©lange layer.\n\nReconfiguration of a flexible fiber immersed in a 2D dense granular flow close to the jamming transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKolb, Evelyne; Algarra, Nicolas; Vandembroucq, Damien; Lazarus, Arnaud\n\n2015-11-01\n\nWe propose a new fluid/structure interaction in the unusual case of a dense granular medium flowing against an elastic fibre acting as a flexible intruder. We experimentally studied the deflection of a mylar flexible beam clamped at one side, the other free side facing a 2D granular flow in a horizontal cell moving at a constant velocity. We investigated the reconfiguration of the fibre as a function of the fibre's rigidity and of the granular packing fraction close but below the jamming in 2D. Imposing the fibre geometry like its length or thickness sets the critical buckling force the fibre is able to resist if it was not supported by lateral grains, while increasing the granular packing fraction might laterally consolidate the fibre and prevent it from buckling. But on the other side, the approach to jamming transition by increasing the granular packing fraction will be characterized by a dramatically increasing size of the cluster of connected grains forming a solid block acting against the fibre, which might promote the fibre's deflection. Thus, we investigated the granular flow fields, the fibre's deflexion as well as the forces experienced by the fibre and compared them with theoretical predictions from elastica for different loadings along the fibre.

By varying the initial packing density of grains and the length of a confined elastica, we identify the critical length necessary to induce jamming, and demonstrate how folds couple with the granular medium to localize along grain boundaries. Above the jamming threshold, the characteristic length of elastica deformation is shown to diverge in a manner that is coupled with the motion and rearrangement of the grains, suggesting the ordering of the granular array governs the deformation of the slender structure. However, overconfinement of the elastica will vertically dislodge grains, a form of stress relaxation in the granular medium that illustrates the intricate coupling in elastogranular interactions.\n\nElastogranular Mechanics: Buckling, Jamming, and Structure Formation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchunter, David J; Brandenbourger, Martin; Perriseau, Sophia; Holmes, Douglas P\n\n2018-02-16\n\nConfinement of a slender body into a granular array induces stress localization in the geometrically nonlinear structure, and jamming, reordering, and vertical dislodging of the surrounding granular medium.

But granular media are different. Right when they jam, these fragile and disordered solids exhibit a vanishing rigidity and sound speed, so that even tiny mechanical perturbations form supersonic shocks. Here, we perform simulations in which two-dimensional jammed granular packings are dynamically compressed and demonstrate that the elementary excitations are strongly nonlinear shocks, rather than ordinary phonons. We capture the full dependence of the shock speed on pressure and impact intensity by a surprisingly simple analytical model.\n\nA thermodynamic equation of jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Kevin; Pirouz Kavehpour, H.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nMaterials ranging from sand to fire-retardant to toothpaste are considered fragile, able to exhibit both solid and fluid-like properties across the jamming transition. Guided by granular flow experiments, our equation of jammed states is path-dependent, definable at different athermal equilibrium states. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on a structural temperature incorporate physical ageing to address the non-exponential, non-Arrhenious relaxation of granular flows. In short, jamming is simply viewed as a thermodynamic transition that occurs to preserve a positive configurational entropy above absolute zero. Without any free parameters, the proposed equation-of-state governs the mechanism of shear-banding and the associated features of shear-softening and thickness-invariance.\n\nJammed elastic shells - a 3D experimental soft frictionless granular system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJose, Jissy; Blab, Gerhard A.; van Blaaderen, Alfons; Imhof, Arnout\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe present a new experimental system of monodisperse, soft, frictionless, fluorescent labelled elastic shells for the characterization of structure, universal scaling laws and force networks in 3D jammed matter. The interesting fact about these elastic shells is that they can reversibly deform and therefore serve as sensors of local stress in jammed matter. Similar to other soft particles, like emulsion droplets and bubbles in foam, the shells can be packed to volume fractions close to unity, which allows us to characterize the contact force distribution and universal scaling laws as a function of volume fraction, and to compare them with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. However, our shells, unlike other soft particles, deform rather differently at large stresses. They deform without conserving their inner volume, by forming dimples at contact regions. At each contact one of the shells buckled with a dimple and the other remained spherical, closely resembling overlapping spheres. We conducted 3D quantitative analysis using confocal microscopy and image analysis routines specially developed for these particles. In addition, we analysed the randomness of the process of dimpling, which was found to be volume fraction dependent.\n\nFriction on a granular-continuum interface: Effects of granular media\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEcke, Robert; Geller, Drew\n\nWe consider the frictional interactions of two soft plates with interposed granular material subject to normal and shear forces. The plates are soft photo-elastic material, have length 50 cm, and are separated by a gap of variable width from 0 to 20 granular particle diameters. The granular materials are two-dimensional rods that are bi-dispersed in size to prevent crystallization. Different rod materials with frictional coefficients between 0 . 04 < Î¼ < 0 . 5 are used to explore the effects of inter-granular friction on the effective friction of a granular medium. The gap is varied to test the dependence of the friction coefficient on the thickness of the granular layer. Because the soft plates absorb most of the displacement associated with the compressional normal force, the granular packing fractions are close to a jamming threshold, probably a shear jamming criterion. The overall shear and normal forces are measured using force sensors and the local strain tensor over a central portion of the gap is obtained using relative displacements of fiducial markers on the soft elastic material. These measurements provide a good characterization of the global and local forces giving rise to an effective friction coefficient.

Indeed, the flow properties of nonaffine systems, such as foams, emulsions and granular materials close to jamming, that produce a fluctuating displacement field when failing, are still controversial. Here we show, via a thorough numerical investigation of jammed materials, that nonaffinity induces a critical scaling of the flow properties dictated by the distance to the jamming point. We rationalize this critical behavior by introducing a new universal jamming exponent and hyperscaling relationships, and we use these results to describe the volume fraction dependence of the friction coefficient.\n\nA thermodynamic unification of jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Kevin; Brodsky, E. E.; Kavehpour, H. P.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nFragile materials ranging from sand to fire retardant to toothpaste are able to exhibit both solid and fluid-like properties across the jamming transition. Unlike ordinary fusion, systems of grains, foams and colloids jam and cease to flow under conditions that still remain unknown. Here, we quantify jamming using a thermodynamic approach by accounting for the structural ageing and the shear-induced compressibility of dry sand. Specifically, the jamming threshold is defined using a non-thermal temperature that measures the `fluffiness' of a granular mixture. The thermodynamic model, cast in terms of pressure, temperature and free volume, also successfully predicts the entropic data of five molecular glasses. Notably, the predicted configurational entropy averts the Kauzmann paradox-an unresolved crisis where the configurational entropy becomes negative-entirely. Without any free parameters, the proposed equation-of-state also governs the mechanism of shear banding and the associated features of shear softening and thickness invariance.\n\nA Jamming Phase Diagram for Pressing Polymers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeng, Chao; Zhang, Zexin; Wang, Xiaoliang; Xue, Gi; Nanjing University Team; Soochow University Collaboration\n\n2011-03-01\n\nMolecular glasses begin to flow when they are heated. Other glassy systems, such as dense foams, emulsions, colloidal suspensions and granular materials, begin to flow when subjected to sufficiently large stresses. The equivalence of these two routes to flow is a basic tenet of jamming, a conceptual means of unifying glassy behavior in a swath of disordered, dynamical arrested systems. However, a full understanding of jamming transition for polymers remains elusive. By controlling the packing densities of polymer glasses, we found that polymer glasses could once flow under cold-pressing at temperatures well below its calorimetric glass transition temperature (Tg). The thermomechanical analysis (TMA) results confirmed that Tg changed with density as well as the applied stress, which is exactly what to be expected within the jamming picture. We propose a jamming phase diagram for polymers based on our laboratory experiments.\n\nEffect of Friction on Shear Jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Dong; Ren, Jie; Dijksman, Joshua; Bares, Jonathan; Behringer, Robert\n\n2015-03-01\n\nShear jamming of granular materials was first found for systems of frictional disks, with a static friction coefficient Î¼ ~ 0 . 6 (Bi et al. Nature (2011)). Jamming by shear is obtained by starting from a zero-stress state with a packing fraction Ï between ÏJ (isotropic jamming) and a lowest ÏS for shear jamming. This phenomenon is associated with strong anisotropy in stress and the contact network in the form of force chains, which are stabilized and/or enhanced by the presence of friction. Whether shear jamming occurs for frictionless particles is under debate. The issue we address experimentally is how reducing friction affects shear jamming. We put the Teflon-wrapped photoelastic disks, lowering the friction substantially from previous experiments, in a well-studied 2D shear apparatus (Ren et al. PRL (2013)), which provides a uniform simple shear. Shear jamming is still observed; however, the difference ÏJ -ÏS is smaller with lower friction. We also observe larger anisotropies in fragile states compared to experiments with higher friction particles at the same density. In ongoing work we are studying systems using photoelastic disks with fine gears on the edge to generate very large effective friction.

Julian; Ramola, Kabir; Chakraborty, Bulbul; Frenkel, Daan\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn the late 1980s, Sam Edwards proposed a possible statistical-mechanical framework to describe the properties of disordered granular materials. A key assumption underlying the theory was that all jammed packings are equally likely. In the intervening years it has never been possible to test this bold hypothesis directly. Here we present simulations that provide direct evidence that at the unjamming point, all packings of soft repulsive particles are equally likely, even though generically, jammed packings are not. Typically, jammed granular systems are observed precisely at the unjamming point since grains are not very compressible. Our results therefore support Edwardsâ original conjecture. We also present evidence that at unjamming the configurational entropy of the system is maximal.\n\nSelf-organized magnetic particles to tune the mechanical behavior of a granular system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCox, Meredith; Wang, Dong; BarÃ©s, Jonathan; Behringer, Robert P.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nAbove a certain density a granular material jams. This property can be controlled by either tuning a global property, such as the packing fraction or by applying shear strain, or at the micro-scale by tuning grain shape, inter-particle friction or externally controlled organization. Here, we introduce a novel way to change a local granular property by adding a weak anisotropic magnetic interaction between particles. We measure the evolution of the pressure, P, and coordination number, Z, for a packing of 2D photo-elastic disks, subject to uniaxial compression. A fraction R m of the particles have embedded cuboidal magnets. The strength of the magnetic interactions between particles is too weak to have a strong direct effect on P or Z when the system is jammed. However, the magnetic interactions play an important role in the evolution of latent force networks when systems containing a large enough fraction of the particles with magnets are driven through unjammed to jammed states. In this case, a statistically stable network of magnetic chains self-organizes before jamming and overlaps with force chains once jamming occurs, strengthening the granular medium. This property opens a novel way to control mechanical properties of granular materials.\n\nEffect of friction on shear jamming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Dong; Ren, Jie; Dijksman, Joshua; Behringer, Robert\n\n2014-03-01\n\nShear Jamming of granular materials was first found for systems of frictional disks, with a static friction coefficients Î¼s ~= 0 . 6 . Jamming by shear is obtained by starting from a zero-stress state with a packing fraction ÏS <= Ï <=ÏJ between ÏJ (isotropic jamming) and a lowest ÏS for shear jamming. This phenomenon is associated with strong anisotropy in stress and the contact network in the form of ``force chains,'' which are stabilized and/or enhanced by the presence of friction. We address experimentally how reducing friction affects shear jamming by using either teflon disks of teflon wrapped photoelastic particles. The teflon disks were placed in a wall driven 2D shear apparatus, in which we can probe shear stresses mechanically. Teflon-wrapped disks were placed in a bottom driven 2D shear apparatus (Ren et al., PRL 2013). Both apparatuses provide uniform simple shear. In all low- Î¼ experiments, the shear jamming occurred, as observed through stress increases on the packing. However, the low- Î¼ differences observed for ÏJ -ÏS were smaller than for higher friction particles. Ongoing work is studying systems using hydrogel disks, which have a lower friction coefficient than teflon.

We simulate gravity driven flow and jamming of 2D disks in a vertical hopper and compare with identical companion experiments presented in this session. We measure and compare the flow rate and probability for jamming as a function of particle properties and geometry. We evaluate the ability of standard Hertz-Mindlin contact mode to quantitatively predict the experimental flow.\n\nJamming Behavior of Domain Walls in an Antiferromagnetic Film\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSinha, Sunil\n\n2014-03-01\n\nOver the last few years, attempts have been made to unify many aspects of the freezing behavior of glasses, granular materials, gels, supercooled liquids, etc. into a general conceptual framework of what is called jamming behavior. This occurs when particles reach packing densities high enough that their motions become highly restricted. A general phase diagram has been proposed onto which various materials systems, e.g glasses or granular materials, can be mapped. We will discuss some recent applications of resonant and non-resonant soft X-ray Grazing Incidence Scattering to mesoscopic science, for example the study of magnetic domain wall fluctuations in thin films. For these studies, we use resonant magnetic x-ray scattering with a coherent photon beam and the technique of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. find that at the ordering temperature the domains of an antiferromagnetic system, namely Dysprosium metal, behave very much also like a jammed system and their associated fluctuations exhibit behavior which exhibit some of the universal characteristics of jammed systems, such as non-exponential relaxation and Vogel-Fulcher type freezing.

The particle segregation mechanism was theoretically analyzed using gap filling, momentum and kinetic energy. The effect of vibrator geometry on granular segregation was determined using the Lacey mixing index. This study shows that dynamic changes in particle gaps under periodic horizontal pendulum vibrations create a premise for particle segregation. The momentum of heavy particles is higher than that of light particles, which causes heavy particles to sink and light particles to float. With the same horizontal vibration parameters, segregation efficiency and stability, which are affected by the vibrator with a cylindrical convex geometry, are superior to that of the original vibrator and the vibrator with a cross-bar structure. Moreover, vibrator geometry influences the segregation speed of granular matter. Simulation results of granular segregation by using the DEM are consistent with the final experimental results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the simulation results and the reliability of the analysis.\n\nTime-resolved dynamics of granular matter by random laser emission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFolli, Viola; Ghofraniha, Neda; Puglisi, Andrea; Leuzzi, Luca; Conti, Claudio\n\n2013-07-01\n\nBecause of the huge commercial importance of granular systems, the second-most used material in industry after water, intersecting the industry in multiple trades, like pharmacy and agriculture, fundamental research on grain-like materials has received an increasing amount of attention in the last decades. In photonics, the applications of granular materials have been only marginally investigated. We report the first phase-diagram of a granular as obtained by laser emission. The dynamics of vertically-oscillated granular in a liquid solution in a three-dimensional container is investigated by employing its random laser emission. The granular motion is function of the frequency and amplitude of the mechanical solicitation, we show how the laser emission allows to distinguish two phases in the granular and analyze its spectral distribution. This constitutes a fundamental step in the field of granulars and gives a clear evidence of the possible control on light-matter interaction achievable in grain-like system.\n\nCavity method for force transmission in jammed disordered packings of hard particles.\n\nPubMed\n\nBo, Lin; Mari, Romain; Song, Chaoming; Makse, HernÃ¡n A\n\n2014-10-07\n\nThe force distribution of jammed disordered packings has always been considered a central object in the physics of granular materials. However, many of its features are poorly understood. In particular, analytic relations to other key macroscopic properties of jammed matter, such as the contact network and its coordination number, are still lacking. Here we develop a mean-field theory for this problem, based on the consideration of the contact network as a random graph where the force transmission becomes a constraint satisfaction problem. We can thus use the cavity method developed in the past few decades within the statistical physics of spin glasses and hard computer science problems. This method allows us to compute the force distribution P(f) for random packings of hard particles of any shape, with or without friction. We find a new signature of jamming in the small force behavior P(f) â¼ f(Î¸), whose exponent has attracted recent active interest: we find a finite value for P(f = 0), along with Î¸ = 0. Furthermore, we relate the force distribution to a lower bound of the average coordination number z[combining macron](Î¼) of jammed packings of frictional spheres with coefficient Î¼. This bridges the gap between the two known isostatic limits z[combining macron]c (Î¼ = 0) = 2D (in dimension D) and z[combining macron]c(Î¼ â â) = D + 1 by extending the naive Maxwell's counting argument to frictional spheres. The theoretical framework describes different types of systems, such as non-spherical objects in arbitrary dimensions, providing a common mean-field scenario to investigate force transmission, contact networks and coordination numbers of jammed disordered packings.\n\nJammed Humans in High-Density Crowd Disasters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBottinelli, Arianna; Sumpter, David; Silverberg, Jesse\n\nWhen people gather in large groups like those found at Black Friday sales events, pilgrimages, heavy metal concerts, and parades, crowd density often becomes exceptionally high. As a consequence, these events can produce tragic outcomes such as stampedes and ''crowd crushes''. While human collective motion has been studied with active particle simulations, the underlying mechanisms for emergent behavior are less well understood. Here, we use techniques developed to study jammed granular materials to analyze an active matter model inspired by large groups of people gathering at a point of common interest. In the model, a single behavioral rule combined with body-contact interactions are sufficient for the emergence of a self-confined steady state, where particles fluctuate around a stable position. Applying mode analysis to this system, we find evidence for Goldstone modes, soft spots, and stochastic resonance, which may be the preferential mechanisms for dangerous emergent collective motions in crowds.\n\nShape effects on time-scale divergence at athermal jamming transition of frictionless non-spherical particles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Ye; Jin, Weiwei; Liu, Lufeng; Li, Shuixiang\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe critical behaviors of a granular system at the jamming transition have been extensively studied from both mechanical and thermodynamic perspectives. In this work, we numerically investigate the jamming behaviors of a variety of frictionless non-spherical particles, including spherocylinder, ellipsoid, spherotetrahedron and spherocube. In particular, for a given particle shape, a series of random configurations at different fixed densities are generated and relaxed to minimize interparticle overlaps using the relaxation algorithm. We find that as the jamming point (i.e., point J) is approached, the number of iteration steps (defined as the \"time-scale\" for our systems) required to completely relax the interparticle overlaps exhibits a clear power-law divergence. The dependence of the detailed mathematical form of the power-law divergence on particle shapes is systematically investigated and elucidated, which suggests that the shape effects can be generally categorized as elongation and roundness. Importantly, we show the jamming transition density can be accurately determined from the analysis of time-scale divergence for different non-spherical shapes, and the obtained values agree very well with corresponding ones reported in literature. Moreover, we study the plastic behaviors of over-jammed packings of different particles under a compression-expansion procedure and find that the jamming of ellipsoid is much more robust than other non-spherical particles. This work offers an alternative approximate procedure besides conventional packing algorithms for studying athermal jamming transition in granular system of frictionless non-spherical particles.\n\nCoupled tomography and distinct-element-method approach to exploring the granular media microstructure in a jamming hourglass\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTsukahara, M.; Mitrovic, S.; Gajdosik, V.; Margaritondo, G.; Pournin, L.; Ramaioli, M.; Sage, D.; Hwu, Y.; Unser, M.; Liebling, Th. M.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nWe describe an approach for exploring microscopic properties of granular media that couples x-ray microtomography and distinct-element-method (DEM) simulations through image analysis. We illustrate it via the study of the intriguing phenomenon of instant arching in an hourglass (in our case a cylinder filled with a polydisperse mixture of glass beads that has a small circular shutter in the bottom). X-ray tomography provides three-dimensional snapshots of the microscopic conditions of the system both prior to opening the shutter, and thereafter, once jamming is completed. The process time in between is bridged using DEM simulation, which settles to positions in remarkably good agreement with the x-ray images. Specifically designed image analysis procedures accurately extract the geometrical information, i.e., the positions and sizes of the beads, from the raw x-ray tomographs, and compress the data representation from initially 5 gigabytes to a few tens of kilobytes per tomograph. The scope of the approach is explored through a sensitivity analysis to input data perturbations in both bead sizes and positions. We establish that accuracy of sizeâmuch more than positionâestimates is critical, thus explaining the difficulty in considering a mixture of beads of different sizes. We further point to limits in the replication ability of granular flows away from equilibrium; i.e., the difficulty of numerically reproducing chaotic motion.\n\nOrigins of Shear Jamming for Frictional Grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Dong; Zheng, Hu; Ren, Jie; Dijksman, Joshua; Bares, Jonathan; Behringer, Robert\n\n2016-11-01\n\nGranular systems have been shown to be able to behave like solids, under shear, even when their densities are below the critical packing fraction for frictionless isotropic jamming. To understand such a phenomena, called shear jamming, the question we address here is: how does shear bring a system from a unjammed state to a jammed state, where the coordination number, Z, is no less than 3, the isotropic jamming point for frictional grains? Since Z can be used to distinguish jammed states from unjammed ones, it is vital to understand how shear increases Z. We here propose a set of three particles in contact, denoted as a trimer, as the basic unit to characterize the deformation of the system. Trimers, stabilized by inter-grain friction, fail under a certain amount of shear and bend to make extra contacts to regain stability. By defining a projection operator of the opening angle of the trimer to the compression direction in the shear, O, we see a systematically linear decrease of this quantity with respect to shear strain, demonstrating the bending of trimers as expected. In addition, the average change of O from one shear step to the next shows a good collapse when plotted against Z, indicating a universal behavior in the process of shear jamming.

Granular rods with asymmetric mass distribution confined to move in a circular channel on a vibrated substrate and interact with each other through inelastic collision serve as our model vehicle. Motion of a single vehicle is observed to be composed of 2 parts, a linear velocity in the direction of lighter end of particle and a non-Gaussian random velocity. We find that the collective mean speed of the SPPs is constant over a wide range of line densities before decreasing rapidly as the maximum packing is approached indicating the spontaneous formation of Phantom jams. This decrease in speed is observed to be far greater than any small differences in the mean drift speed of individual SPPs , and occurs as the collision frequency between SPPs increase exponentially with line density. However the random velocity component of SPPs remain super-diffusive over entire range of line densities. While the collective motion at low densities is characterized by caravan following behind the slowest particle leading to clustering, at higher densities we see formation of jamming waves travelling in direction opposite to that of motion of particles.\n\nShearing Low-frictional 3D Granular Materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, David; Zheng, Hu; Behringer, Robert\n\nShear jamming occurs in frictional particles over a range of packing fractions, from random loose to random dense. Simulations show shear jamming for frictionless spheres, but over a vanishing range as the system size grows. We use packings of submerged and diffractive index-matched hydrogel particles to determine the shear-induced microscopic response of 3D, low-frictional granular systems near jamming, bridging the gap between frictionless and low friction packings. We visualize the particles by a laser scanning technique, and we track particle motion along with their interparticle contact forces from its 3D-reconstructions.

The dominant features of Mtilde (Ï) provide signatures of the dissipation of acoustic modes, elasticity, and aging effects in the granular medium. We perform humidity controlled experiments and interpret the data in terms of a continuum model and a âtrapâ model of thermally activated capillary bridges at the contact points. The results suggest that attenuation of acoustic waves in granular materials can be influenced significantly by the kinetics of capillary condensation between the asperities at the contacts.\n\nUnderstanding earthquake from the granular physics point of view â Causes of earthquake, earthquake precursors and predictions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Kunquan; Hou, Meiying; Jiang, Zehui; Wang, Qiang; Sun, Gang; Liu, Jixing\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe treat the earth crust and mantle as large scale discrete matters based on the principles of granular physics and existing experimental observations. Main outcomes are: A granular model of the structure and movement of the earth crust and mantle is established. The formation mechanism of the tectonic forces, which causes the earthquake, and a model of propagation for precursory information are proposed. Properties of the seismic precursory information and its relevance with the earthquake occurrence are illustrated, and principle of ways to detect the effective seismic precursor is elaborated. The mechanism of deep-focus earthquake is also explained by the jamming-unjamming transition of the granular flow. Some earthquake phenomena which were previously difficult to understand are explained, and the predictability of the earthquake is discussed. Due to the discrete nature of the earth crust and mantle, the continuum theory no longer applies during the quasi-static seismological process. In this paper, based on the principles of granular physics, we study the causes of earthquakes, earthquake precursors and predictions, and a new understanding, different from the traditional seismological viewpoint, is obtained.\n\nDense granular flow around a rigid or flexible intruder\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKolb, Evelyne; Adda-Bedia, Mokhtar\n\n2012-02-01\n\nWe experimentally studied the flow of a dense granular material around an obstacle (rigid cylinder or flexible plate) placed in a 2 dimensional confined cell at a packing fraction near the 2D jamming threshold. In the case of the rigid obstacle, the displacement field of grains as well as the drag force experienced by the obstacle were simultaneously recorded and a parametric study was done by changing the cell size, the intruder diameter or the packing fraction. The drag force experienced by the intruder and the formation of a wake behind the obstacle were very sensitive to the approach to jamming. The same experimental set-up was adapted to a flexible intruder and coupling between the granular flow and fibre deflexion were imaged. The deformation of the fibre could be compared with theoretical predictions from elastica.\n\nAnatomy of a Jam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTang, Junyao; Sagdighpour, Sepehr; Behringer, Robert\n\n2008-11-01\n\nFlow in a hopper is both a fertile testing ground for understanding models for granular flow and industrially highly relevant. However, the formation of arches in the hopper opening, which halts the hopper flow unpredictably, is still poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a two-dimension hopper experiments, using photoelastic particles, and characterize these experiments in terms of a statistical model that considers the probability of jamming. The distribution of the hopper flow times exhibits an exponential decay, which shows the existence of a characteristic ``mean flow time.'' We then conduct further experiments to examine the connection between the mean flow time, the hopper geometry, the local density, and geometric structures and forces at the particle scale.\n\nAspects of jamming in two-dimensional athermal frictionless systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nReichhardt, C; Reichhardt, C J Olson\n\n2014-05-07\n\nIn this work we provide an overview of jamming transitions in two dimensional systems focusing on the limit of frictionless particle interactions in the absence of thermal fluctuations. We first discuss jamming in systems with short range repulsive interactions, where the onset of jamming occurs at a critical packing density and where certain quantities show a divergence indicative of critical behavior. We describe how aspects of the dynamics change as the jamming density is approached and how these dynamics can be explored using externally driven probes. Different particle shapes can produce jamming densities much lower than those observed for disk-shaped particles, and we show how jamming exhibits fragility for some shapes while for other shapes this is absent. Next we describe the effects of long range interactions and jamming behavior in systems such as charged colloids, vortices in type-II superconductors, and dislocations. We consider the effect of adding obstacles to frictionless jamming systems and discuss connections between this type of jamming and systems that exhibit depinning transitions. Finally, we discuss open questions such as whether the jamming transition in all these different systems can be described by the same or a small subset of universal behaviors, as well as future directions for studies of jamming transitions in two dimensional systems, such as jamming in self-driven or active matter systems.\n\nJamming II: Edwardsâ statistical mechanics of random packings of hard spheres\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Ping; Song, Chaoming; Jin, Yuliang; Makse, HernÃ¡n A.\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThe problem of finding the most efficient way to pack spheres has an illustrious history, dating back to the crystalline arrays conjectured by Kepler and the random geometries explored by Bernal in the 1960s. This problem finds applications spanning from the mathematicianâs pencil, the processing of granular materials, the jamming and glass transitions, all the way to fruit packing in every grocery. There are presently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres gives a density of â¼55% (named random loose packing, RLP) while filling all the loose voids results in a maximum density of â¼63%-64% (named random close packing, RCP). While those values seem robustly true, to this date there is no well-accepted physical explanation or theoretical prediction for them. Here we develop a common framework for understanding the random packings of monodisperse hard spheres whose limits can be interpreted as the experimentally observed RLP and RCP. The reason for these limits arises from a statistical picture of jammed states in which the RCP can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of jammed matter with zero compactivity, while the RLP arises in the infinite compactivity limit. We combine an extended statistical mechanics approach âa la Edwardsâ (where the role traditionally played by the energy and temperature in thermal systems is substituted by the volume and compactivity) with a constraint on mechanical stability imposed by the isostatic condition. We show how such approaches can bring results that can be compared to experiments and allow for an exploitation of the statistical mechanics framework. The key result is the use of a relation between the local Voronoi volumes of the constituent grains (denoted the volume function) and the number of neighbors in contact that permits us to simply combine the two approaches to develop a theory of volume fluctuations in jammed matter. Ultimately, our results lead to a phase diagram that\n\nAnalysis of the Angle of Maximal Stability and Flow Regime Transitions in Different Proportions of Bi-phasic Granular Matter Mixtures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaquiling, Joel Tiu; Visaga, Shane Marie\n\nThis study investigates the dependence of the critical angle Î¸c of stability on different mass ratios Î³ of layered bi-phasic granular matter mixtures and on the critical angle of its mono-disperse individual components. It also aims to investigate and explain regime transitions of granular matter flowing down a tilted rough inclined plane. Critical angles and flow regimes for a bi-phasic mixture of sago spheres and bi-phasic pepper mixture of fine powder and rough spheres were observed and measured using video analysis. The critical angles Î¸c MD of mono-disperse granular matter and Î¸c BP of biphasic granular matter mixtures were observed and compared. All types of flow regimes and a supramaximal critical angle of stability exist at mass ratio Î³ = 0.5 for all biphasic granular matter mixtures. The Î¸c BP of sago spheres was higher than the Î¸c MD of sago spheres. Moreover, the Î¸c BP of the pepper mixture was in between the Î¸c MD of fine pepper and Î¸c MD of rough pepper spheres. Comparison of different granular material shows that Î¸c MD is not simply a function of particle diameter but of particle roughness as well. Results point to a superposition mechanism of the critical angles of biphasic sphere mixtures.\n\nSubmicron and Nanoparticulate Matter Removal by HEPA-Rated Media Filters and Packed Beds of Granular Materials\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPerry, J. L.; Agui, J. H.; Vijayakimar, R\n\n2016-01-01\n\nContaminants generated aboard crewed spacecraft by diverse sources consist of both gaseous chemical contaminants and particulate matter. Both HEPA media filters and packed beds of granular material, such as activated carbon, which are both commonly employed for cabin atmosphere purification purposes have efficacy for removing nanoparticulate contaminants from the cabin atmosphere. The phenomena associated with particulate matter removal by HEPA media filters and packed beds of granular material are reviewed relative to their efficacy for removing fine (less than 2.5 micrometers) and ultrafine (less than 0.01 micrometers) sized particulate matter. Considerations are discussed for using these methods in an appropriate configuration to provide the most effective performance for a broad range of particle sizes including nanoparticulates.\n\nThe Packing and Jamming of Real Polymer Chains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXue, Gi; Teng, Chao\n\n2010-03-01\n\nJamming make a hope to unifying theme for granular materials, glasses and threshold behavior in materials. Here we experimentally prepared a real polymer (polystyrene, PS) with various packing density which was described by inter-segment distances (r) detected by NMR. We cold-pressed PS powder at 20 ^oC (with shearing) and then released the pressure. We found that a transparent pellet with high modulus was formed. PS is usually manufactured by a hot-melting process at 180 ^oC. The rigidity and transparency of our cold-pressed pellet and its accuracy of the form are testimony that the PS powder once flowed under cold compression to take the shape of its container. This shear-induced melting is exactly what is expected within the jamming picture. By measuring r and the applied pressure Ï under which the polymer chain starts to flow, we drew a schematic jamming phase diagram. The Ï-r curve for a real polymer is convex at r < 0.5 nm, while it becomes concave as r is larger than 1 nm. It is the van der Waals attraction that acts as a confining pressure on segments, and makes the Ï-r curve convex on the very short scales.\n\nUnjamming a granular hopper by vibration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJanda, A.; Maza, D.; GarcimartÃ­n, A.; Kolb, E.; Lanuza, J.; ClÃ©ment, E.\n\n2009-07-01\n\nWe present an experimental study of the outflow of a hopper continuously vibrated by a piezoelectric device. Outpouring of grains can be achieved for apertures much below the usual jamming limit observed for non-vibrated hoppers. Granular flow persists down to the physical limit of one grain diameter, a limit reached for a finite vibration amplitude. For the smaller orifices, we observe an intermittent regime characterized by alternated periods of flow and blockage. Vibrations do not significantly modify the flow rates both in the continuous and the intermittent regime. The analysis of the statistical features of the flowing regime shows that the flow time significantly increases with the vibration amplitude. However, at low vibration amplitude and small orifice sizes, the jamming time distribution displays an anomalous statistics.\n\nGranular statistical mechanics - Building on the legacy of Sir Sam Edwards\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlumenfeld, Raphael\n\nWhen Sir Sam Edwards laid down the foundations for the statistical mechanics of jammed granular materials he opened a new field in soft condensed matter and many followed. In this presentation we review briefly the Edwards formalism and some of its less discussed consequences. We point out that the formalism is useful for other classes of systems - cellular and porous materials. A certain shortcoming of the original formalism is then discussed and a modification to overcome it is proposed. Finally, a derivation of an equation of state with the new formalism is presented; the equation of state is analogous to the PVT relation for thermal gases, relating the volume, the boundary stress and measures of the structural and stress fluctuations.

The foam on our cappuccinos appears solid, but gentle stirring irreversibly changes its shape. Skin, a biological fiber network, is firm when you pinch it, but soft under light touch. Sand mimics a solid when we walk on the beach but a liquid when we pour it out of our shoes. Crucially, a marginal point separates the rigid or jammed state from the mechanical vacuum (freely flowing) state - at their marginal points, soft materials are neither solid nor liquid. Here I will show how the marginal point gives birth to a third sector of soft matter physics: intrinsically nonlinear mechanics. I will illustrate this with shock waves in weakly compressed granular media, the nonlinear rheology of foams, and the nonlinear mechanics of weakly connected elastic networks.\n\nJamming transitions in cancer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOswald, Linda; Grosser, Steffen; Smith, David M.; KÃ¤s, Josef A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe traditional picture of tissues, where they are treated as liquids defined by properties such as surface tension or viscosity has been redefined during the last few decades by the more fundamental question: under which conditions do tissues display liquid-like or solid-like behaviour? As a result, basic concepts arising from the treatment of tissues as solid matter, such as cellular jamming and glassy tissues, have shifted into the current focus of biophysical research. Here, we review recent works examining the phase states of tissue with an emphasis on jamming transitions in cancer. When metastasis occurs, cells gain the ability to leave the primary tumour and infiltrate other parts of the body. Recent studies have shown that a linkage between an unjamming transition and tumour progression indeed exists, which could be of importance when designing surgery and treatment approaches for cancer patients.\n\nMicroscopic Origins of Shear Jamming for 2D Frictional Grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Dong; Ren, Jie; Dijksman, Joshua A.; Zheng, Hu; Behringer, Robert P.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nShear jamming (SJ) occurs for frictional granular materials with packing fractions Ï in ÏS<Ï <ÏJ0, when the material is subject to shear strain Î³ starting from a force-free state. Here, ÏJÎ¼ is the isotropic jamming point for particles with a friction coefficient Î¼ . SJ states have mechanically stable anisotropic force networks, e.g., force chains. Here, we investigate the origins of SJ by considering small-scale structuresâtrimers and branchesâwhose response to shear leads to SJ. Trimers are any three grains where the two outer grains contact a center one. Branches occur where three or more quasilinear force chain segments intersect. Certain trimers respond to shear by compressing and bending; bending is a nonlinear symmetry-breaking process that can push particles in the dilation direction faster than the affine dilation. We identify these structures in physical experiments on systems of two-dimensional frictional discs, and verify their role in SJ. Trimer bending and branch creation both increase Z above Zisoâ3 needed for jamming 2D frictional grains, and grow the strong force network, leading to SJ.\n\nStructure of jammed configurations and their relation to unjamming times\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBirwa, Sumit Kumar; Merrigan, Carl; Chakraborty, Bulbul; Tewari, Shubha\n\nThe distribution of the times for the cessation of flow of grains falling under gravity in a vertical hopper is known to be exponential. Recent experiments have shown, however, that the time lapse between avalanches follows a power-law distribution when the hopper is unjammed using periodic vertical vibrations. The reasons for this distribution of the unjamming times, which indicates the time needed for an applied continuous perturbation to induce another avalanche, are not well understood. We report on a numerical simulation of granular hopper flow using LAMMPS in which we seek to understand the origin and scope of this behavior. We find that cessation of flow is related to the formation of a stable arch that spans the system. However, the actual structure of the jammed configuration varies and is closely related to the unjamming time. We find that the symmetry of the arches is an important parameter in determining the strength of the jammed configurations. Using different force thresholds, we have characterized the contact networks around the arches which provides stability to the packed structure and analyzed the strength of various jammed configurations.

The project currently involves two aspects. The first of these is an experiment that is a prototype for a planned ISS (International Space Station) flight. The second is discrete element simulations (DES) that can give insight into the behavior one might expect in a reduced-g environment. The experimental arrangement consists of an annular channel that contains the granular material. One surface, say the upper surface, rotates so as to shear the material contained in the annulus. The lower surface controls the mean density/mean stress on the sample through an actuator or other control system. A novel feature under development is the ability to 'thermalize' the layer, i.e. create a larger amount of random motion in the material, by using the actuating system to provide vibrations as well control the mean volume of the annulus. The stress states of the system are determined by transducers on the non-rotating wall. These measure both shear and normal components of the stress on different size scales. Here, the idea is to characterize the system as the density varies through values spanning dense almost solid to relatively mobile granular states. This transition regime encompasses the regime usually thought of as the glass transition, and/or the jamming transition. Motivation for this experiment springs from ideas of a granular glass transition, a related jamming transition, and from recent experiments. In particular, we note recent experiments carried out by our group to characterize this type of transition and also to demonstrate/ characterize fluctuations in slowly sheared systems. These experiments give key insights into what one might expect in near-zero g. In particular, they show that the compressibility of granular systems diverges at a transition or critical point. It is this divergence, coupled to gravity, that makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to\n\nCouette shear of an ideal 2D photo-elastic granular system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Meimei; Zheng, Hu; BarÃ©S, Jonathan; Wang, Dong; Behringe, Robert\n\nIn this study, Couette shear experiments are conducted using 2D photoelastic granular particles, which allows us to apply infinite shear strain to the granular system. We obtain force information st the granular scale using the calibrated photo-elastic grain force response. The whole granular system is density matched in salt solution, which guarantees an ideal 2D system without basal friction between the particles and the table. The viscosity is negligible at the very small shear strain rate (0.017 rpm). This talk will address two main points: i) how does the system reach a jammed state; ii) how does system reach a long term stable state and what are the properties of that state.

A variety of physiologic agonists induce a cascade of signaling events termed as inside-out signaling that culminate in exposure of high-affinity binding sites on integrin Î±IIbÎ²3. Once platelet activation has occurred, integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 stabilizes thrombus formation by providing agonist-independent âoutside-inâ signals mediated in part by contractile signaling. Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), a member of the cortical thymocyte marker of the Xenopus (CTX) family, was initially identified as a receptor for a platelet stimulatory mAb. Here we show that JAM-A in resting platelets functions as an endogenous inhibitor of platelet function. Genetic ablation of Jam-A in mice enhances thrombotic function of platelets in vivo. The absence of Jam-A results in increase in platelet aggregation ex vivo. This gain of function is not because of enhanced inside-out signaling because granular secretion, Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) generation, as well as fibrinogen receptor activation, are normal in the absence of Jam-A. Interestingly, integrin outside-in signaling such as platelet spreading and clot retraction is augmented in Jam-Aâdeficient platelets. We conclude that JAM-A normally limits platelet accumulation by inhibiting integrin outside-in signaling thus preventing premature platelet activation.
