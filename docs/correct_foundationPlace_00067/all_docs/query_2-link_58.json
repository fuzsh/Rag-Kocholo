None of this should be considered final product, just development info. We want to take the step, since the game is about being hunted, of making the character a Native American. The character will be a successful business person or politician, striking against the stereotypes. While a few aspects of Native American culture will be brought into it, it will be as part of fleshing out the character.\n\nSTORY\n\nYou are a successful Native American, fighting for part of what were your ancestral lands. When the ruling goes against you, you pack up your Hummer and head out to the wilderness to contemplate your future and hope for guidance. Suddenly, there is a blinding flash of light, your skin crawls with electricity and you black out. You wake to find yourself in a hostile alien environment. Strange creatures pour out of every crevice of the odd alien architecture, firing weapons of incredible might. You must find out how to defeat them: master the alien weapons, explore the foreboding battlefields to uncover their secrets, and discover what part you will take in this violent new world.\n\nDEVELOPMENT CONTACT:\n\nTom Hall\n\nCreative Director/Producer/Designer/etc.\n\nApogee / 3D Realms\n\nApogee Software\n\nAttn: Tom Hall\n\n3960 Broadway, Suite 235\n\nGarland, TX 75043\n\n(214) 271-1648\n\nPreyweb - a group of HTML documents with Prey specifications and ideas, written throughout 1997 and 1998 by Paul Schuytema and the Prey development team.

One of the founders of id Software, with credits such as Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Rise of the Triad. What was the influence behind choosing this type of work? Was it by chance, or something you planned to do?\n\nTom Hall: I've always loved games, from Sea Wolf in the arcades to that incredible Christmas when we got the Atari 2600, but on June 9th, 1980, our family got an Apple II+. From that moment on, it was all over. I saw the computer as an amazing medium for creativity and exploration. The excitement I felt that summer-just typing in commands and having the computer do the cool things you told it to-changed my life's direction. I always wanted to do this, but realistically, I felt I'd be in educational software or something. I got a job doing monthly software at Softdisk, in Shreveport, Louisiana. Then I met two of our contributors, John Romero and John Carmack. They later started work on a Gamer's Edge disk, and I snuck in after work to do levels and design. A few months later Adrian Carmack (no relation) started doing art for the disk, and well, I think you know the rest.\n\nTitania: Now you're working on Prey for 3D Realms. Tell me more about the game, story and all.\n\nTom Hall: You are abducted from Earth, and wake up with a biotech suit on. Not only on you, but parts of it are woven into you, tubes and wires enter muscles, joints, and so on. You'll never be the same again. Alien races are studying six different disciplines of fighting, and you are grist for their mill, meant to be killed as they practice and perfect their study of their chosen discipline. Your job is to survive, which means you must learn how the world works, how to use the alien weapons, and what tactics will work against the strong attackers you're pitted against.\n\nIt's a first person action game. The engine has six degrees of freedom (which means you can look in any direction and move in any direction). That's as good as you can get, freedom-wise. The lighting is both pre-computed _and_ dynamic: lights around the level cast soft-edged shadows, but also searchlights can scan around the room. One of the characters is going to have a flashlight on its gun, so if you're in a dark room, you'll see the beam searching around for you.\n\nIt's going to be straight action, but the theme of the game provides a much richer texture than other games in this genre. Everything will fit together well, all thematic to each of the disciplines. For instance, there is a Temple of Might, and the inhabitants will be solely concerned with using force to wage war against you. The environment will be suitable to creatures of Might: heavy, oppressive architecture and all very sturdy to withstand the amazing battles that take place within it.\n\nTitania: Judging from the look and feel of Prey, it seems you're looking to create a contender for id's Quake. Was that the motivation behind Prey, or did something else influence its design?\n\nTom Hall: Well, if Quake didn't exist, we'd still be making this game. We set out to make a scary, intense sci-fi game with unparalleled action and user-customizability. The Prey engine or the Quake engine are the logical next step in making 3D games: computed lighting with polygon- based characters. We already did light sourcing in a limited fashion on the walls of Rise of the Triad, but here it is done in full splendor. :)\n\nTitania: From what we're told, there's less than a dozen people who are physically working on Prey. Still, they encompass a wealth of talent. Was the assemblage of \"elite\" designers and programmers intentional, so as to make Prey a more advanced game?\n\nTom Hall: We're pretty much the people that worked on Rise of the Triad. That was our warm-up game. As far as having the elite, well, we try not to hire bozos at Apogee. ;^) William Scarboro is finally getting to do what he was hired for. He studied both computer science and high-end math, so he's the perfect person for making a 3D engine. It's weird, when you go through geometry and calculus and think, \"When will I ever use this stuff?\" Well, you have to use it all the time writing 3D games!\n\nTitania: The engine used to create the game doesn't seem to be very similar to the Build engine, but technology is always evolving. What is this new engine called, and is it a relative of 3D Realms' Build technology?\n\nTom Hall: Well, we usually call it the Prey engine, but at times it's been called Tears (as in what our competitors will be shedding when they see how cool it is) and a bunch of other inside joke names. It has nothing to do with Build, except they are both 3D engines. The Prey engine is much more advanced. Without getting abysmally technical, the world is a bunch of polygons. A tree of these polygons is made by seeing what polygons are in front of a given polygon, and what ones are behind it. This allows you to know what things are visible from a given place. (It is so much more complex that this, but...) Then all those polygons are lit up by light sources placed in the level. I won't even go into how that is done. Let's just say it looks really cool.\n\nTitania: Could you describe what this new Prey Engine is trying to accomplish?\n\nWilliam Scarboro: The whole idea behind the design of a graphics engine is to provide the most realistic environment possible for a first-person action-oriented game. We plan to achieve a frame rate in the game around the mid to high twenties on a P90. It also has to look incredible. Static environment lighting will provide close to photo quality, while real-time dynamic lighting will put an end to the dull, placid look of most games of this genre. Finally, there are no restrictions whatsoever on architecture, since the engine is true 3-D. Prey will take full advantage of this with impressive and very alien levels for the player to explore.\n\nTitania: Some of the things depicted in current screen shots are ray traced lighting, unique architecture, shadows & detailed textures. Apparently this is an effort to make more realistic environments for tomorrow's games. What barrier's had to be overcome before this technology was developed? And what sort of visual and artistic advancements are you attempting to make?\n\nTom Hall: Well, first off, computers needed to have the number- crunching muscle to do all the calculations necessary. Now we have Pentiums. The formulas are all there waiting in books for anyone to read. The big problem is finding shortcuts and optimizations so that you still get perfect-looking places but you can also draw them fast enough to have a \"fun\" frame rate.\n\nThe lighting is just beautiful. As one of the level designers has said, \"even if there were no monsters, I'd buy this just to walk around are see the environment.\" We're striving for a completely real-looking places, while setting a bold, alien style. You could call it Alien Industrial Gothic.\n\nEverything in the place will look like it was made with thought behind it--not just a bunch of rooms! For a place to look real, it needs to look like someone a while ago actually made it, with some intent, alien thought it may be. You may not recognize everything, but it all makes some sort of intuitive sense.\n\nTitania: Passing through the graphical content, what efforts are being made to compose a sound track and aural effects for Prey?\n\nTom Hall: The \"music\" will be more of a threatening alien atmosphere, sort of an ambient malevolence. That and the sound effects are being composed by our resident musician, Lee Jackson. We've got a few sound effects in now, and man, Prey is going to sound awesome.\n\nTitania: A cornerstone of first person entertainment is serial gaming. Doom seemed to revolutionize the way we think about modem and network play. It seems that Prey will push the envelope even further in this regard. What features are being included so as to make Prey a terrific multiplayer experience?\n\nMark Dochterman: Prey will be a great multi-player game. The multi- player architecture has been built in from the start, which will mean multiplay will have our full attention, not just be a tacked-on afterthought. The type of gameplay we're designing for single play incorporates all the elements of an awesome deathmatch while still also being a cool one- player game. The enemies in Prey will behave as much as possible like a human player. They share the same weapons, and use the same ammo as you do. They will have intelligent tactics, and suffer the same needs as human foes. The multi- player game will not be a totally different game, but really the same game in which there are just more humans playing. Upwards of 30 players will be able to engage in a single Prey-match if the Prey server is being run on a separate machine. You'll be able to use the server machine as a client but at a loss of players (probably less than 10). Prey is also being designed for the Internet. Prey servers will be popping up all over the Internet. Hopping from server to server will be as easy as running around on the World Wide Web is now.\n\nTom Hall: Multiplayer network games have been around since the old UNIX Mazewar game, which was a little text maze you wandered around in, shooting other network players. That was over ten years ago. DOOM brought it to the mass market. With Prey, we are setting the game up from day one as multiplayer-oriented. When you exit a Prey level, you won't go to \"level + 1\", you'll go to what is basically a World Wide Web address. It may happen to be on your computer, but it could be on some far-away server. You could exit the level and find yourself in the virtual lobby of a company in Brazil or something. Users will have our level editor, as well as a built-in assembler, so they can make programs in any language that actually run IN Prey. Prey is going to be an awesome game, but it's also going to be an amazing development environment. You could even write a word-processor in it, if you really want to. Jim DosÈ is writing the code interpreter, and he's making it ridiculously powerful. He wants to be able to compile the compiler from within itself (kind of pointless, but it is somehow satisfying in a masochistic programmer way...). Jim also wrote the editor, and as you can see from the first levels, it works pretty well.\n\nTitania: Beyond human players, what can you tell me about the game's AI? And what sort of opponents can we expect to face?\n\nTom Hall: We are taking steps to have the opponents think much more like human opponents. You both use the same weapons system. You both need health. Apart from a strong understanding of how to use things in the level, they'll also occasionally do things so intelligently, you'll swear you were playing against a human. We'll see how that goes.\n\nThe opponents will use many different tactics against the player, and it will be up to the player to figure them out, and figure a good defense and offense against them. Sometimes it will be brainless shooting. Other times, you'll need a lot of smarts to get out alive.\n\nJim Dose: Prey's AI engine is designed to be expandable on an extreme scale. We have a script based system that uses fully C-compliant script code. This allows us to program our actors in the same language we program the game in, plus it allows us (and those who buy the game) to create add on packs that completely change the way the game works. In a way, Prey is not only the game we're making, but it is also the game development system that we use.\n\nSince we want the game to be this flexible, the player actually controls a camera which in turn sends its controls to an actor in the game. This allows the player to choose which character in the game they want to control. If they get tired of playing the 'hero' of the game, they can choose to play as a monster. You can also choose to have robot players cooperatively play along side the user, or they can play against you for deathmatch without a network.\n\nTitania: What sort of weapons and tactics can be used to survive in this alien world?\n\nTom Hall: The tactics are borne of the six disciplines, which form a thing called the \"Warrior Wheel\". To fight against a certain discipline, you must practice its opposite.\n\nWeapon-wise, we will have a set of incredibly awesome-looking weapons, and also weapons that are more like tools.\n\nTitania: Any other features of interest?\n\nTom Hall: We are really dedicated to making each part of Prey of the highest quality. The engine is great, the sound will be awesome, and the gameplay, most important of all, has to be superior. There are a few advancements we don't want to talk about yet, partly because we want to be the first to have them, and partly because they are in development and we're not sure which path we'll take with them!\n\nTitania: Prey seems to be on a smooth road so far. There's news that you're already working on the network play capabilities. Is there a demo in the near future? Give me a rough estimate as to when Prey should hit the shelves, or perhaps a status on current completion.\n\nTom Hall: We're mentally oriented towards Christmas, but realistically, we'll probably wrap in Q1 next year. We won't put it out until it is the game we want it to be.\n\nTitania: Do you think Prey will be \"the next big thing\"?\n\nTom Hall: Well, I can't really predict the future, but it has a number of innovations that will make it a remarkable game, and it is open-ended, so it can be enjoyed with enhancement packs and user-created stuff for a long time. The \"next big thing\" is usually something that the media embraces and gets behind, and that's how people get to know about it. One of the few next big things that didn't really develop this way was Wolfenstein. That really grew from grass roots and word of mouth.\n\nPrey is going to rock. Lots of people are really going to like it. That's about all I can predict. It'll be somewhere between a rather successful game and a virtual movement that will take over the world. Somewhere in there. ;^)\n\nFebruary 5, 1998 Adrenaline Vault interview with Paul Schuytema:\n\nThe Light at the End of the Tunnel:\n\nAn Interview with Prey Producer Paul Schuytema\n\nWritten by:\n\nDavid Laprad\n\nIn the summer of 1995, 3D Realms' online representative Joe Siegler offhandedly mentioned in a short FidoNet post that the company had just completed the programming of a Quake-style engine, and that they were commencing development of a game that would have \"all the bells and whistles\" of id Software's upcoming title, and more. Poor Fido must have choked on what followed. Within hours, the BBS message network was overflowing with questions from zealous gamers wanting to know every minuscule detail. They wanted to know how many weapons there would be, what kind of monsters were in the game, and what the levels were like; essentially, they asked Siegler to list every detail of what players would see, hear, and do in the game from beginning to end. In a fit of hilarious absurdity, some even declared, \"Your game sucks! Quake rules!\" Siegler's innocent message appeared a full year before Quake was released, and by the time aging players actually sink what teeth they have left into 3D Realms' elusive masterpiece, over three remarkable years prior to the release of the actual game.\n\nAt the time, no one had heard of portals, 3D graphics acceleration was barely a gleam in John Carmack's code, and current Prey producer Paul Schuytema was buried in the cornfields of Illinois (as far from Texas as one can be), teaching writing, multimedia authoring, and 3D animation at Monmouth College. Several months following the FidoNet incident, 3D Realms made the announcement official and released a small set of test screenshots. To no one's surprise, they looked, smelled, and tasted just like the Quake screenshots that had been flooding the Internet for months, and followers of the game were underwhelmed. Still, Tom Hall, formerly of id Software, was named producer, and everyone assumed Prey had entered its critical phase of development.\n\nNot quite. Something was happening between the lines of engine-developer William Scarboro's code. The powers that be at 3D Realms, specifically founding owners Scott Miller and George Broussard, were growing dissatisfied with the technology and the direction of the design. That is, the inconsiderable amount of design that was actually taking place -- the game was in a state of immutable stagnation, going nowhere. Something was wrong, and it took a disaster to set things right. A few month's following Quake's release in the summer of 1996, a significant portion of Prey's development team, including Richard \"Levelord\" Gray, programmers Mark Dochtermann and Jim Dose, and artists Robert Atkins and Mike Hadwin, decided to start fresh with their own company; they wiped their hard drives clean, made an infamous midnight exit, and never looked back. Hall parted under more amicable conditions, agreeing with Broussard and Miller that he was not creatively appropriate for the project, and joined John Romero to form the almighty Ion Storm.\n\nNot long after the stampede to what were assumed greener pastures, Broussard and Miller declared Prey would be a 1998 release. That announcement, made in late 1996, was considered by many within the 3D gaming industry be a subtle admission of failure. However, scathing e-mails and newsgroup messages declaring Prey's demise went in one modem and out the other as 3D Realms rolled up its sleeves and reinvented the game. From the very first line of code to the farthest reaches of its narrative, Prey ceased to be just another Quake clone, and became the buzzword for the next generation of technology. It also marked the emergence of a new conceptual paradigm for 3D games that includes complex, ethnically accurate characters and an epic science fiction-based chronicle. Suddenly, everyone was talking about portals, and 3D Realms boldly announced that their title would not just benefit from a 3D graphics accelerator, it would require one.\n\nLike life-saving surgery, the departures removed that which was detrimental to the energy and spirit of the game, and the company infused the afflicted title with new blood, bone, and creative strength. Scarboro, who was left alone on the project after the departures, never lost faith, and delved into research and development for the game's new, cutting edge engine. In the fall of 1996, Schuytema, impressed with the technology, the game's concept, and the design freedom he was offered by Miller and Broussard, was successfully wooed from the MechWarrior 3 project. Together, Scarboro and Schuytema recruited Polish-born programmer Tom Pytel and 2D artist Scott McCabe. With E3 looming ominously in the near future, the valiant foursome cemented the core design, got the engine running under hardware, and nailed down the major low-level systems. (Even the grandest of schemes must be built upon a firm foundation, and Pytle's initial tasks were programming the rather unglamorous archiving routines, system management routines, memory managers, and video system. Nothing to write home about, but vital nonetheless.) The next additions were 3D artist Allen Dilling and environmentalist Matt Wood.\n\nThis prepared the team to blow the doors off the Electronic Entertainment Expo, where the industry would learn that Prey was very much alive and well. Two versions of the game were shown, an impressive rolling demo on the main floor, and an earth-shattering, real-time version in an invitation-only back room. Many who emerged from the back room were incapable of speaking, and could do nothing more than shake their heads in astonishment and walk off in search of something, anything that would return them to reality. The reaction was universally positive, and gave the team their first, tangible validation concerning the new approach. It was a shining moment, and solidified their intent to create a classic.\n\nImmediately after E3, programmer Loyal Bassett and environmentalist John Anderson joined up, and just recently, the final team was nailed down with the additions of 3D artist David March and environmentalist Martinus, who will be joining the rest of the group very soon. No one who has been following the development of the game needs reminding that 1998 is upon us, and it seemed the perfect time to discuss with Schuytema the current state of Prey. While he passed on divulging any specifics concerning content (hey, it never hurts to ask), he openly and enthusiastically discusses several key concepts regarding the game's development, and provides intriguing insight into what players can expect from this highly anticipated title.\n\nWork in Progress\n\nAVault: Thank you for taking time to speak with us regarding this monumental project. As Prey enters its critical period of development, what is the emotional and creative condition of the team?\n\nSchuytema: The team is fired up! We ended 1997 with an important milestone, and a whole lot of brainstorming over the last few weeks has helped us craft a great vision of the task ahead and the game as a whole. We have a ton to do, but can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAVault: The blueprint of Prey is unfolded before you. What portions are complete, where have you only just begun to draw in the lines, and are there any empty spaces awaiting inspiration?\n\nSchuytema: Nice metaphorical question! There are really no places on the blueprint devoid of lines. We have addressed the vast majority of technical issues, and if something is not implemented yet, we have certainly tested several approaches that will be in the coming months. Prey is actually represented by two blueprints. We have the game, Prey, and we have the technology, PreyTech. Both blueprints have been drafted side-by-side. On one hand, the process of crafting a game and crafting a game technology are very different, but we have found that inspiration often crosses over. A cool addition to PreyTech may lead to a design innovation, and vise versa.\n\nAVault: Is PreyTech still a work in progress? If so, how difficult are the dynamics of integrating engine updates with already completed design work? Is material discarded as new features are implemented, or does the overall design take shape in tandem with the maturing technology?\n\nSchuytema: As with any game based on new technology, the engine will remain a work in progress until we burn the gold master. Even then, we will probably have some ideas that we will have to sit on until Prey 2. That stated, a vast majority of the game's engine is complete, as is a large portion of the design. Both the design and the technology dovetail very nicely, and most of the cool \"design wish-list\" ideas that we have come up with will actually make their way into the game because of the flexibility of PreyTech.\n\nAVault: Provide a brief, easily digestible definition of Portal Technology.\n\nSchuytema: Prey is much more than our Portal Technology alone. We have wide-sweeping innovations in all areas of development that will help us deliver one hell of a game experience. Still, here is the ten-second overview of what Portal Technology means: Portal Technology is a fundamentally different way to build a true-3D engine. Instead of pre-processing our geometry into BSP trees and potentially visible sets, we deal with our geometry in real-time. We noticed a major limitation in the previous approaches. Since major amounts of geometry were pre-processed, it was immutable in the game. Dealing with geometry in real-time means it can all be dynamic during the play experience. The easiest way to visualize Portal Technology is to think about rooms connected by doors and windows. The rooms contain the geometry, and the doors and windows are the portals. If you look out a door into another room, then you deal with that geometry. If you turn away from the door, then you no longer have to think about that geometry.\n\nAVault: Do you have any concerns that, because of its extended development, Prey will lack genuine impact?\n\nSchuytema: I would be an idiot if I did not keep a paranoid eye on the ever-creeping, bleed-edge of technology. In terms of Prey, we are not really into extended development at all. We started this project in Nov. 1996, and did not really move from research and development into the initial phases of development until Feb. 1997. To be blunt, we have technological edge to spare. That is not a cocky or boisterous statement, but rather an acknowledgment that PreyTech has been crafted over the last year with scalability and longevity in mind. There are things our engine can do that will not make it into Prey, not because of time constraints or anything like that, but because the engine has capabilities beyond current hardware.\n\nThe Anatomy of Secrets\n\nAVault: Do you find it hard to contain your enthusiasm when something cool comes to fruition? Do you ever want to blather all over the Internet how earth-shattering Prey will be, and why? We know you are keeping secrets from us...\n\nSchuytema: Hell, yes, I am keeping secrets from you! In fact, I am opening a notebook right now and reading some of those secrets aloud, but you cannot hear me. Oh, here is an interesting one. \"Instead of having weapons...\" OOPS! I almost let that one slip! I have to admit that it kills me to keep quiet on all the coolness of this game. I love to talk, and nothing gets me more jazzed than Prey, but I have to bite my tongue. I do this for two reasons: the first, and most obvious, is that in this competitive environment ideas will get ripped off. It has happened already. In fact, we even put something in our earliest screenshots of Prey as a test. It was a cool idea that was not going to make it into the game because we already had a cooler idea, but we wanted to see if it would appear anywhere else, and it did. The second, and most important reason, is that I am sick of the over-hyping of games. I enjoy reading about games in development, but honestly do not want to know the plot, weapons, and creatures I will face. I want that to be a surprise, and I want Prey to be a surprising and wondrous experience for our players.\n\nAVault: Why are you using the term \"environmentalist\" instead of level designer? Will the mappers be complimenting the revolutionary technology with some radical new directions on 3D game design?\n\nSchuytema: We use \"environmentalist\" as our term of choice because of the way PreyTech deals with environments. The term \"level\" is not really a technologically-limiting term anymore, it is just an artificial construct. The entire game could be one immense, persistent environment if we wanted it to be. While that would work for a role-playing game, it is still probably not the best design choice for an action game.\n\nAVault: You have mentioned that Prey will contain an intense, epic science fiction storyline. Who is primarily responsible for writing the story, and what influences are being drawn upon? How far into the future can you see this story extending?\n\nSchuytema: The story universe is being designed to live well into the future. We think we have enough interesting things going on that the universe can support games and fiction well beyond even Prey 2. The story and universe is one of my primarily responsibilities. As for influences, that is hard to pin down. We do not want this universe to appear derivative. Of course, we want a universe that has the far-reaching, story-telling potential of the Star Wars universe. The story of the game itself is drawn from the German tradition of bildungsroman, or \"novel of adventure.\" Personally, I have always been a fan of the character interactions of Orson Scott Card, and I am striving to create characters and situations that achieve this same level of resonance and power.\n\nAVault: A considerable amount of attention is being given to developing an ethnically accurate character in Talon Brave. Does this represent a hard right turn for 3D Realms, following the fuss over the Asian-based character Lo Wang in Shadow Warrior?\n\nSchuytema: I am not going to label this as any kind of shift in company dogma. For Prey, we gain a lot more out of ethnic accuracy rather than ethnic caricature. The heritage of the Apache tribes is ripe with opportunity for this story, and on a more surface level, since this story is meant to be serious and engrossing, our player will identify with Talon Brave more fully if he is seen as a real human being and not some stereotypical amalgam of traits.\n\nMay 13, 1998 Gameslice interview with Scott Miller:\n\nName: Scott Miller\n\nCompany: 3D Realms\n\nTitle: Owner/Partner\n\nScott Miller started programming games in 1975, the year this interviewer was born. Wow. Having made over 100 games to 1990, and co-authored he then quit his day job to start running Apogee Software full-time.\n\nFrom then onwards, things have only got better, with the Duke Nukem phenomenon and the cultivation of the much-respected 3D Realms development brand. And with Prey and Max Payne forthcoming, it seems the future looks bright.\n\nSo, GameSlice's Game Design has managed to procure a most interesting interview with the owner/partner of Apogee/3D Realms, dealing with Prey, Remedy, and that nice man Duke Nukem himself.. process this.\n\nGD: How much of a say do you think the more senior management of a company (such as yourself) should have in the design of a product?\n\nSM: In our company, the two owners, George Broussard and myself, are intimately involved with game development. George is the project leader on Duke Nukem Forever, and I handle games by our by our external teams, such as Balls of Steel by Wildfire Studios (in Australia), and Max Payne by Remedy Entertainment (in Finland).\n\nGeorge and I have a long history of creating/coding our own games, back when one person did it all (multi-person teams really didn't become a given until the late 80's), plus we were involved in the game industry in other ways, such as arcade managers and professional writers. We even tried to start a gaming league for the top players in the early 80's, which would organize tournaments like the PGL, but then the arcade industry had it's first crash in 1983 and that killed our effort.\n\nBasically, George and I *are* developers--game designers, more specifically--who happen to own a business. We've both been playing and designing games since 1978.\n\nGD: Should companies employ separate games designers, or does the role integrate nicely into existing job titles?\n\nSM: We don't employ dedicated game designers, but that's not to say that they're not necessary at all game companies. Our approach is to settle on a game concept, and every developer on the project gets to have their influence on the design of the game. We have project leaders, such as George on the Duke games and Paul Schuytema on Prey, who help filter the appropriate ideas and shape them into a usable form--not every idea from every developer can be used, after all. (We invented a phrase several years ago, \"shit filter,\" which refers to a person's ability to recognize good ideas from bad ideas. People with bad shit filters let bad ideas get into their games.)\n\nSo, at 3D Realms, a project leader is the closest thing to a dedicated game designer, but really the roles are quite different.\n\nGD: Why so many add-on level packs for Duke Nukem?\n\nSM: Simple: They keep selling.\n\nOur marketing manager at our Duke Nukem publisher, GT Interactive Software, recently remarked that anything they slap \"Duke Nukem\" on sells. If you combine all the different Duke versions, Duke add-ons and the number of Duke games that we sell direct, Duke would be the top selling game since its release nearly two years ago. As an game property, Duke is probably one of the top five in all of gaming, right up there with Mario, Lara Croft, and Flight Simulator.\n\nGD: Does having a major Apogee/3DRealms external developer like Remedy such a darn long way away (Finland!) make things tricky? How have you tried to get round this problem?\n\nSM: It's not too tricky, thanks to the Internet and email. Plus, they've come to visit several times and we meet at every E3. The Internet has compressed the world into a much smaller space. We get milestone CD burns from Remedy every month, and have a round of discussions based on the current state of the game. Mark my words: Remedy will soon be recognized as one of the world's leading independent PC developers.\n\nGD: Do most publishers know anything about games? (heh, is this a leading question?)\n\nSM: A better question is this one: Do the key decision makers at most publishers know a good game from a bad one? My answer is \"no.\" For example, you recently interviewed a CEO who, when you asked if he had time to play his own company's games, said: \"Not really. I do a few hours of each game, but that's it.\"\n\nIs there any wonder why this CEO's company releases such hit and miss games?\n\nThe problem with most large publishers is that the CEO's and V.P.s are not from a developer background, they're most likely business, marketing and financial people, and don't have a long track record of game development and playing games.\n\nWe had one of these V.P.s visit us right before Duke Nukem 3D was released, looking at our games to see if we had anything worth porting to consoles. This guy passed on Duke, not seeing it's potential, and thinking it was just another DOOM clone. He simply didn't understand all the new innovations Duke brought to the genre. He no longer works for this company.\n\nGD: Do you think there'll be 'copycat' new companies trying to emulate G.o.D (the new 'publisher' conglomerate that 3DRealms/Apogee have pledged support for)? Or do you think the rest of the industry will have trouble breaking away from their current business model?\n\nSM: I think established publishers will not attempt to copy g.o.d.'s business model, simply because a key element of this model is a board of directors mostly comprised of developers. The board's job will be to maintain a priority on developer concerns, such as royalty rates, developer ownership of intellectual property rights, and pushing the developer's name ahead of g.o.d.'s name.\n\nGD: It's noticeable that not that many companies have tried emulating Apogee's innovative business model.\n\nSM: The reason few developers have copied Apogee's shareware marketing and direct sales methods is because most publishers do not allow developers to do what we do, because it cuts the publisher out of a good portion of the game's revenue. G.o.d., though, will help developers with selling their games via shareware, by having its own order taking and fulfillment division.\n\nGD: If you could steal one coder for your company, who would it be?\n\nSM: I have the utmost respect for John Carmack as a coder. He amazed me back in 1990 when Apogee first brought id into the shareware industry. Over the years that we worked together I spent a lot of time talking to John picking his brain and trying to figure out how he came upon his innovative solutions to problems other coders couldn't solve--trying to understand his genius. He was always three steps ahead of anyone else in the industry. His strength is not in his programming skills--it's in the fact that he's very accurate at predicting which future technologies are most important and appropriate to pursue. John probably has better binoculars than anyone else in this industry.\n\nGD: When you managed an arcade location early in the eighties, which games were the most popular?\n\nSM: Even people born after the early 80's know which games we played back then, such as Asteroids, Missile Command, Defender, Joust, Xevious, Battlezone, Tempest, Galaxian, Centipede, Zaxxon, Gravitar, Space Invaders, Scramble, Robotron, etc. The key back then is that gameplay mattered, simply because the graphics sucked and couldn't carry a game. Nowadays, graphics must play too important a role, which is a distraction from the depth and polish of the gameplay for game developers.\n\nGD: And did you sneak round after work with the keys getting plenty of free credits? :)\n\nSM: I didn't wait until after work, I played constantly *during* work hours! :) And, yes, even after work I played, allowing all my friends to play for free, too.\n\nGD: Do you think you started promoting \"Prey\" too early?\n\nSM: Not at all. Prey is actually two projects. The first one was cancelled after a year of struggling with which direction to take it. The second and current Prey incarnation has very little to do with that first project called Prey, because it has entirely different objectives, and a new staff running the show. When Prey is released, it will have been a two year project, which for a game as ambitious as this, is not too long. Plus, unlike some games long in development, like Stonekeep and Descent to Undermountain, Prey when released will be a cutting-edge game in both gameplay and technology.\n\nGD: Capcom or Namco - which rules more?\n\nSM: Namco in the 80's, Capcom in the 90's.\n\nGD: How's the sports car quotient at your company going compared to those show-offs at ID? 0:)\n\nSM: I think overall our developers are a bit more pragmatic than those at id, and don't necessarily want expensive show-off cars. We've had our Ferrari-owning exceptions, though. ;)\n\nGD: \"Balls Of Steel\" - what makes it stand out?\n\nSM: Five tables, compared to one table in most PC pinball games, such as the Pro Pinball series. Also, we didn't set out to make a 100% pinball \"simulator.\" Instead, Balls of Steel adds many cool, animated features that are not possible with the real game--we take advantage of the fact that this is a computer game, and do very cool things like breathing dragons, burning buildings, ball-eating monsters, exploding enemies, morphing table features, and even a table that can be totally submerged underwater with floating landmines.\n\nGD: There seems to have been relatively few releases on Apogee recently - is this down to lack of good material submitted to you, or because you want to concentrate on a small number of projects?\n\nSM: Apogee is basically retired as a game label. We've decided to focus on our 3D Realms division for now, because we think 3D games are where all the action is at.\n\nGD: Why do people identify with Duke Nukem?\n\nSM: He represents the kick-butt nature buried in all of us. He's a fantasy that we all wish we could sometimes be like.\n\nGD: And finally.. give us your \"State Of The Gaming Nation\" speech. What's been good, and what will continue to suck?\n\nSM: If you've got money to burn, things are good because advancing hardware technology will mean incredible new games (at least, great looking games) are around the corner. If you don't have the money to keep up, you might not be able to play coming new games. Progress is a double-edged sword.\n\nFinally, I think more and more developers and publishers are realizing that they cannot rush out a game without months of polishing the gameplay, and this will result in better games for us all.\n\nGD: Thanks!\n\nJune 24, 2006 Eurogamer interview with Tim Gerritsen:\n\nIf you haven't seen Prey in action yet, you really ought to take a look. For those who aren't familiar, it's a new first-person shooter with a sci-fi feel and an interesting take on boring old gravity - and it's heading to PC and Xbox 360 later this year.\n\nThe storyline revolves around Native American garage mechanic Tommy, who finds himself trapped aboard an alien spaceship with a personality all of its own. It's your job to rescue Tommy's girlfriend and find a way off the ship, together with the help of a ghostly hawk by the name of Talon. Luckily, you're armed with all sorts of mysterious Spirit Powers to help you in this task - not to mention an arsenal of really quite exciting guns.\n\nWe sat down with Tim Gerritsen of Human Head to ask him all manner of questions including what makes Prey different from your average FPS, why there are only two multiplayer modes, and whether a console controller can ever really beat the old mouse-and-keyboard combo... Read on to find out more.\n\nEurogamer: What sets Prey apart from other first-person shooters?\n\nTim Gerritsen: There are several things. There's the reluctant hero who isn't a space marine or a soldier, but rather just a man put in a position where he has no choice but to survive. There's the story told from a first-person point of view, where the hero is active and talking [about] the story that unfolds around him.\n\nThere's the use of Death Walk to get you back into the game after you've died, but without requiring you to replay an entire section of the game.There's the unique level design that throws out the usual laws of physics and places you within a living organism.\n\nThere's the use of Talon, your spirit totem to assist you as you navigate through the world. There's the setting, high above Earth, where you are constantly reminded of the menace that faces your loved ones. I could go on and on...\n\nEurogamer: The game seems to have a bit of an Aliens feel to it - were the Alien films an influence on you? What other films have inspired you?\n\nTim Gerritsen: Specifically, HR Giger was a big influence on us. His ability to create a look that is at once biological and mechanical had a huge influence on us visually. We were inspired to create a unique look of our own that captured his spirit without specifically trying to ape his style.\n\nStar Wars and its unique blending of spiritual and science fiction elements was also a big influence on us, as was Fire in the Sky, an abduction movie that finely captures the ever-present sense of fear in a totally alien environment.\n\nEurogamer: Where did the idea for the 'living ship' come from?\n\nTim Gerritsen: That came early on. We felt that by making the ship you are abducted to a living entity, it gave us more opportunities to evolve the story beyond the usual science fiction drama. Getting the right look for that ship took much longer and was far harder.\n\nEurogamer: Can you explain a bit about the Spirit powers? How do they work, and at what points are they likely to prove useful?\n\nTim Gerritsen: The spirit powers that Tommy learns during the game are Spirit Walk, which is the ability to leave his body and travel as a spirit. He leaves his body behind (leaving it defenseless and subject to attack) giving his spirit [the power] to travel semi-invisibly to by pass enemies (or sneak attack them), and to interact with key objects in the real world.\n\nThe next spirit power is Death Walk, which is what happens if your physical body is killed. Your spirit travels to a plane of existence between our world and the next and is forced to fight to return to the real world, where it can rejoin your physical body.\n\nThe final major spirit power is your spirit totem, Talon. He is a hawk that acts as your translator but also your companion, who defends you during battle by seeking to distract your enemies.\n\nEurogamer: What exactly is 'portal technology'? What are the portals for?\n\nTim Gerritsen: Portals are used in various ways. The most obvious one is as a door between two points that enemies can travel through to attack you. Other portals are more subtle - they are used to change the physical setup of the world and make it something very different from what you see in our world.\n\nOthers may be invisible to the player entirely, but I don't want to give too much away regarding that.\n\nEurogamer: What's your favourite weapon in the game, and how does it work?\n\nTim Gerritsen: My favourite weapon is the hider weapon, a sort of acid shotgun that shoots out the yellow glowing gastric juices of one of the enemies you fight. A lot of people like that gun, though I think the playtesters like the flexibility of the leech gun - a gun that sucks the power out of energy nodes on board the starship, creating different shooting effects depending on the type of power drawn upon.\n\nNearly all of the weapons have some sort of organic component to them as well, which creates both a visual interest and 'ick' factor when seeing them in use.\n\nEurogamer: Why are there only deathmatch and team deathmatch modes? Why not capture the flag, or something more original?\n\nTim Gerritsen: Prey is predominantly a single player game, and we didn't want to divide our focus by trying to add on a ton of half-baked modes to multiplay.\n\nInstead we decided to focus on making Deathmatch and doing it right. We reasoned that if we did a good deathmatch mode and got it right, and released the editor and SDK, we'd be in a far better position to create or support new modes down the road.\n\nIf we delivered a bad multiplayer experience, and few people cared about it, we figured there would be no point - since future development would never happen. This is the strategy we saw Valve use with Half-Life and we feel it worked very well in their case, thus proving our theory.\n\nI think too many developers of limited size and resources like us try to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, thus creating a multiplayer that is quickly forgotten. We didn't want to do that.\n\nEurogamer: How does the anti-gravity element of the gameplay affect the way multiplayer matches play out?\n\nTim Gerritsen: It's not really anti-gravity so much as different gravity, and it's the key to why our multiplayer is fun. By throwing out the typical rules of gravity, we created multiplayer situations where you really have to be thinking and reacting at all times.\n\nWe were very concerned early on that players would become overwhelmed by this feature, but in test it has proved to be easily adjusted to by most players and a hell of a lot of fun. Any game where you can be standing on one surface, while every other surface in the room has it's own localised gravity is a different experience to say the least.\n\nEurogamer: What are the main differences between the Xbox 360 version and the PC version?\n\nTim Gerritsen: Both versions use the same source content though some of the visuals on the 360 use the medium PC quality settings for performance reasons. The 360 version has fully integrated Live support while the PC version uses the traditional user server based play.\n\nOf course there's the controls as well. The PC version was designed for keyboard and mouse while the 360 uses the controller, though we tried to make sure the controls on each were adjusted so as to be comfortable and feel natural to the player. Outside of these differences, however, the experiences are very similar.\n\nEurogamer: A lot of hardcore FPS fans would say you can never have a truly great FPS on a console, because nothing can beat the mouse and keyboard combo. How would you respond to this?\n\nTim Gerritsen: I believe Halo laid this to rest with a strong FPS experience on a console. For the super fast twitch style player who rules with a keyboard and mouse, however, I don't think anything will ever make them accept the controller/console experience.\n\nFor the mainstream gamer, the controller-based FPS is a lot of fun. Bad controls are bad controls, however, regardless of platform. For the 360 we worked with Venom to make sure the basic controls felt smooth and we followed the Halo setup as the guide. We also made the controls customisable with several different presets and easy adjustibility of the controller sensitivity to make the experience unique to each person who plays the game.\n\nEurogamer: Last time we saw the game we noticed there were two difficulty levels - 'Normal' and 'Wicked'. Are you familiar with the meaning of 'Wicked' when used within South-East London?\n\nTim Gerritsen: No, I'm personally not familiar, so pardon my ignorance on that. That's an unlockable version of the game that has actually been changed to Cherokee mode. The original use comes from another 3D Realms game - Max Payne - that had a similar unlockable mode.\n\nBasically, the game has its own dynamic difficulty adjustment system that adjusts upwards or downwards on a limited scale based on how the player is doing. Once you finish the game, you unlock Cherokee mode, which is far harder - there are no health pick ups, less ammo, and everything is set to a harder level so you can really challenge yourself after you've played through the game.\n\nEurogamer: The PC demo has just been released? What can players expect from it?\n\nTim Gerritsen: It's a fairly large demo. Not necessarily in terms of size, since it clocks in at about what most demos do these days, but in terms of how much content. We've shipped with two multiplayer maps and the first five levels of the game. You get to see a fair bit of the game in action to get a feel for it.\n\nIf you buy the full game, though, the demo save games work with the final version of the game (at least on PC) so that you don't have to replay sections if you don't like.\n\nJuly 11, 2006 Creative interview with Ed Lima:\n\nInterviewee: Ed Lima, Former Audio Director at Human Head, Audio Lead on Prey\n\nDeveloper: Human Head\n\nPublisher: 2K\n\nGame Title: Prey™\n\nQ1: What was your role on Prey and what other games have you worked on in the past?\n\nI was Audio Lead on \"Prey\", which means I was responsible for everything you hear in the game, including sound effects, music and voiceover. I also directed the voiceover actors, and contributed some additional writing to the game. My previous titles include \"DOOM 3\", \"007 Nightfire\", and Empire Earth.\n\nQ2: Prey has had an interesting development cycle, was there any old content you inherited from the old \"Prey\" that was being developed by 3D Realms? Or any direction from back then for sound design?\n\nAs with most other elements of \"Prey\", 3D Realms very generously gave Human Head free reign to do what was required. Since the monsters, weapons and settings were all newly created for the game, all of the audio content was similarly built from the ground up. We did use some original Grandfather voiceover in our first E3 2005 trailer for \"Prey\", but beyond that, every audio asset is brand new.\n\nQ3: What were the challenges in developing a game like Prey, which has such diverse and out of this world environments?\n\nScience fiction settings are always fun and challenging to work in for sound designers, since we basically have carte blanche to produce whatever crazy effects we can think of. \"Prey\" features a unique combination of science fiction, organic, and natural exterior environments, plus interesting and original enemies and biotech weapons, all of which provide a unique playground for sound.\n\nQ4: Are there any particular effects or levels that you like the most?\n\nI'm quite proud of the voice acting in \"Prey\". We were very lucky to cast such a wonderfully talented group of actors, all of which really got into \"Prey's\" unique premise. I think the taunting alien voice in Tommy's head and accompanying sound effects are a high point in that regard. I'm happy with how the alternate sniper fire on the Hunter rifle turned out, too.\n\nQ5: What role does 3D audio play in Prey?\n\n\"Prey's\" unique 360-degree settings and visceral gunplay happen all around Tommy all the time. 3D audio is essential to helping the player get his or her bearing in the crazy topsy-turvy world of the Sphere. OpenAL goes a long way towards accomplishing this through its tightly pinpointed 3D panning system. Sounds are much more clearly pointsourced in OpenAL than in the game's default sound system. This provides an additional benefit to multiPrey gamers, since they'll have a better bead on where their enemies are.\n\nQ6: How was OpenAL and EAX® ADVANCED HD™ used in Prey and how does it add to the experience?\n\nOpenAL and EAX ADVANCED HD had been implemented into Prey about a year and a half ago. This allowed us to really fine-tune and craft the 3D audio experience to suit OpenAL's and EAX's strengths. OpenAL gave us the hardware acceleration we wanted for full 3D sound effects and the EAX allowed us to add in nice Multiple Reverb effects to spice up all the sound environments in the game.\n\nQ7: Have you tried the game on a Sound Blaster® X-Fi™ and if so, how does it sound?\n\nMost of the sound design was created with the X-Fi™, and the entire game was mixed on an X-Fi Fatal1ty card and Gigaworks speaker system. If players want to live the true \"Prey\" sound experience as it was intended, the Sound Blaster X-Fi is a requirement.\n\nIRC logs\n\nGeorge Broussard on #Duke3D - January 13, 1997:\n\n*** GeorgB3DR ([email protected]) has joined #duke3d\n\n*** D_Nukem sets mode: +o GeorgB3DR\n\n<D_Nukem> Woha, Hi George!\n\n*** _TheMAD_ (~peacock@async2_port6.pppmex7.mpsnet.com.mx) has joined #duke3d\n\n<GeorgB3DR> hey guys\n\n<GeorgB3DR> wassup?\n\n<Vadir> hi george\n\n<_TheMAD_> hey!\n\n<Vadir> ive never met u before\n\n<Joris> Hello George\n\n*** RingFingr ([email protected]) has joined #duke3d\n\n<GeorgB3DR> Hi Vadir...\n\n*** Mykle ([email protected]) has joined #duke3d\n\n*** sammy2 ([email protected]) has joined #duke3d\n\n<RingFingr> Wow...it's George...\n\n<D_Nukem> George: Soo...can I get anything out of you about Pinball Wizards?\n\n<Vadir> George i hear u r a fellow keyboarder\n\n<RingFingr> An idea why Shadow Warrior has taken 3 years to develop?\n\n<Joris> George: I hate to sound corny but I have a couple of CON questions\n\n<Reptile> Cool dudes, George is here\n\n*** LagWagon ([email protected]) has joined #duke3d\n\n<Vadir> do u use the default keys\n\n<Vadir> mousers keep kicking my butt\n\n<GeorgB3DR> DN: Not a big deal.
