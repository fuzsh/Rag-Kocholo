My pace counting was okay, but I had drifted down below the control, and could see no sign of the hill because of the green, so, as usually happens when I have a choice, I took the wrong option and went down the slope until I noticed the big cliff north east of the control. Back on a bearing took me into the control without problem. #8 to #9: My route from 7 to 8 took me down below the hill with the big rock face, and I then had to struggle back up 5 contours to the control. At that point I convinced my- self that that was all the climbing that the planner had wanted us to do, and set off downhill from the control on a 180 degree error. Fortunately the wide open meadow told me something was wrong and I turned round before I had dropped more than about 3 contours, but that was three too many, and it was a struggle to get my weary legs to take me to the top of the hill again.
