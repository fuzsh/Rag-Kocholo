Surprisingly,\n\nwe have received responses from platforms that GEnieLamp doesn't directly\n\nsupport (like the Amiga and NeXT computers). Even more surprising is the\n\nfact that we have received _zero_ entries from the IBM and Macintosh crowd\n\nwhile the Apple II/A2Pro response has been tremendous.\n\nThe contest is simple: Tell us why you think your computer is HOT.\n\nWhy and how do you use your computer in everyday life? What are its\n\nstrengths. What are its weaknesses? What keeps you from switching\n\nplatforms?\n\nThere are only a couple of weeks left to get in on the contest, so if\n\nyou're planning on entering do it now. Just send your entry of 400 words\n\nor less to GEmail address GENIELAMP or upload it to Library #8 in the\n\nGEnieLamp RoundTable on page 515. And don't forget, there is over $200.00\n\nworth of GEnie online credit time which will be given away!\n\nAmigians Ask, Where Is GEnieLamp AMI? I have received several GEmail\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" asking me why we GEnieLamp doesn't\n\nsupport the Commodore/Amiga line of computers. The reason is simple: You\n\nalready have a great newsletter, Viewport. Viewport is edited by Jim Meyer\n\nand published by Livewire editor, Peggy Herrington. And like GEnieLamp,\n\nViewport is distributed via the main menu and is included in your\n\nGEnie*Basic package. Check it your copy of Viewport out in the *STARSHIP*\n\nRoundTable on page 555.\n\nGEnieLamp Elsewhere Update Our \"elsewhere\" issue is undergoing a complete\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" make-over.

I also\n\nsigned a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nIt was/is nice. I played with it quite a bit. I can not / will not\n\ndiscuss the program itself.\n\nThe only BBS I ever saw it on was the Seven Hills area (closed to\n\nnon-Partners) here on GEnie, but then, except for my brief monthly forays\n\nonto AOL, this is my only BBS.\n\nIf some Seven Hills Partner let it out by giving it away to a pirate\n\nBBS, then shooting is too good for that person. Hot coals, v-e-r-y\n\ns-l-o-w-l-y, maybe.\n\nI really liked the \"commercial version\". As the PD librarian of a\n\nusers' group, I had played with SoundSmith, but never kept it because of\n\nthe way it never liked my system configuration (i.e., it wouldn't run off\n\nmy hard drive and I hate booting from a floppy). So I used AOL's\n\npre-System 6.0 version of SynthLAB and later FTA's freeware NoiseTracker\n\n(I just listen to other people's compositions).\n\nWhen I was in Germany I wrote to FTA and to Huibert Aalbers. I even\n\npaid for Photonix II prior to it's release (still don't have it...).\n\nOlivier and Huibert are talented guys, but they were writing for a platform\n\nthat was never even supported in Europe to a tiny fraction of it's US\n\nsupport - slim as that was!\n\nSr. Aalbers might be tempted if _every_ person who _uses_ SoundSmith:\n\n(a) paid their shareware fee; and (b) deluged Seven Hills with prepaid\n\norders for the \"commercial version\" - AND cheerfully and uncomplainingly\n\naccepting the \"final beta\" without a manual until any bugs are worked out.\n\n[BTW, I have suggested in the past that Apple II users could commission\n\nprogramers to write programs for them. In other words, Bill Heineman\n\ngets, say $5,000 for a program, we raise $5,000 and pay him for his work.\n\nIf any one of these \"alliance\" operations ever got off the ground, that\n\nwould be one vehicle to raise programmers' commissions with. Perhaps GEnie\n\ncould even be convinced to allow electronic fund raising?]\n\nSeven Hill's is committed to the GS. People who pirate their\n\nprograms in these day of faint support should be ashamed - by doing so\n\nthey are actively helping to kill a fantastic platform (the GSd a very good\n\ncompany (Seven Hills, not Apple!). I hope they enjoy their putrid PC's\n\nwhen that's all that's left. Try my suggestions of getting people to pay\n\nthe shareware fee and trying to preorder the finished program. Money\n\ntalks, all else walks.

It's a fairly standard 65c816, except for two things:\n\no It runs at 14MHz\n\no It was reengineered almost from scratch by Sanyo to run at 14MHz\n\nThis is no joke; I called WDC and asked them (talk to 'Deb'). They\n\nhave them, they cost $95 just like the old 'high speed' (not) chips they\n\nhad. And, they have what's probably an unlimited supply of them.\n\nYou can pump your Zips up to 12.4MHz (their gate array is now the\n\nbottleneck, although there are about 100 Zips out there with faster gate\n\narrays). Transwarps can probably go the full 14MHz, though I don't know for\n\na fact. There is no power supply boosting necessary; these chips run\n\nstraight off the regular 5V (they were reengineered, remember?). Just plug\n\n'em in, put in a new crystal, hope you particular accelerator card doesn't\n\nhave some odd fault, and GO! Ultra fast IIgs's.\n\nWDC will require you to look at some outdated (and because of the new\n\nchip, obsolete) information on modifying TWGS's and Zips before they'll let\n\nyou order the chip; but that's free, and well worth a IIgs at 12 or 14\n\nMHz.-(81%)\n\nAgain, *THIS IS NOT A JOKE*.

FantasyWorks again\n\nremains the ONLY Fantasy Football software for the Apple II line.\n\nFantasy Football is a seasonal event that coincides directly with the\n\nNational Football League's 17-week season. A commissioner runs a league\n\nwhere members become team owners by drafting a team of NFL players and\n\ndecide who to play each week. Each NFL player scores points based upon\n\ntheir performance in actual NFL games.\n\nFantasyWorks gives you everything you need to run a top-notch Fantasy\n\nFootball League on your Apple (or Mac LC or LC II with Apple II emulation\n\ncard) using Classic AppleWorks, Publish It and your favorite\n\ntelecommunications software. Our thick 300-page manual covers everything\n\nfrom publishing your own league newsletter to setting up a league hotline.\n\nThe included telecommunications scripts automatically capture NFL stats\n\nfrom Computer Sports World (CSW) and Fantasy Point Scoring is accomplished\n\nautomatically using the included UltraMacro TaskFiles within AppleWorks.\n\nBasic, Distance, Performance and our \"Elite\" method are included. If\n\nnecessary, custom scoring TaskFiles are available separately.\n\nFantasyWorks Version 3.0 runs with AppleWorks 3.0 and includes more\n\nthan 60 templates to help manage a proficient Fantasy Football League and\n\nrequires at least two 5.25\" drives or a single 3.5\" drive. A TaskMaster\n\nversion of all TaskFiles are available free for those AppleWorks owners who\n\ndon't have TimeOut UltraMacros. Version 3.0 will have many enhancements\n\nsuch as automatic weekly scoring sheets and automatic ranking of NFL\n\nplayers. Numerous customer requests were also added. Registered owners\n\ncan upgrade to Version 3.0 for $14.95. A version compatible with\n\nAppleWorks 2.0 is still available for an additional $14.95. A discount\n\ncoupon to join CSW is also included.\n\nFantasy Football is becoming more popular each year and now has 5\n\npaperbacks and 3 magazines dedicated to it. There's lots of stuff here so\n\nif you want to start your own league, now's the time to do it. The NFL\n\nseason is almost here.\n\nFantasyWorks normally sells for $74.95 but is available to GEnie\n\nmembers through December 1st for $59.95 plus $6 s/h (Canadian members,\n\nplease add $1 s/h). Please identify yourself as a GEnie member when you\n\norder.

The reason you see so much \"euro-disco-industrial-pop-dance\" music\n\navailable for our favorite computer is because that's the kind of music\n\nthat is being CREATED on computers, predominantly, in the first place. As\n\nsuch, it's ideal for the translation to something that we can play on our\n\nown machines.\n\nOne example I'd like to make is a song in the library called ACID.BXY.\n\nI would consider this song not just an approximation of a \"real world\"\n\nsong in the style of acid house dance music, but actually an example of\n\nthat music ITSELF. Obviously, the music style of acid house dance music is\n\npredominantly created on computers, with a lot of samples. Anyway, there\n\nare still quite a number of artists who use computers to make their music\n\nand who DON'T end up making \"euro-disco-industrial-pop-dance\" music.\n\nFor example, there is a CD called Bachbusters, recorded by Don Dorsey\n\nin 1985, which is a selection of Bach pieces done entirely with\n\nsynthesizers (using an Apple II Plus as a synchronizer/sequencer). These\n\nsynthesizers were dedicated musical instruments, though (a Fairlight was\n\nused, for example), which become increasingly difficult to duplicate with a\n\nIIGS when you're trying to make it sound like a \"real instrument.\" Now,\n\nsynthLAB can be pointed out as an example, but almost all of the people who\n\nactually MAKE music on the IIGS who I've seen comment do not take synthLAB\n\nvery seriously, due to quite a number of shortcomings (difficulty in\n\ncreating instruments is one -- even the original author did a bunch of\n\ntricks to create his instruments and used MPW IIGS to assemble them, from\n\nwhat I've heard).\n\nIt's surely possible to do forms of music other than\n\n\"euro-disco-industrial-pop- dance\" with NoiseTracker and SoundSmith, but I\n\ndon't think you should be too upset if you don't see very much of it, since\n\nthe \"euro\"etc. music is where their strengths lie. -= Lunatic (:\n\nHmm, neat trick, talking about acid house and Bach within the same\n\nmessage.... (CAT3, TOP4, MSG:78/M645;1)\n\nMac Icons on the IIGS |)ave, here's another way to do it that may\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" be a bit easier: Use the program called Resource\n\nSpy (I know it's in A2Pro, and it may be in A2, as well) to open the\n\noriginal Mac Desktop file and copy the Calvin and Hobbes icons out of it.\n\nResource Spy will save them directly as IIGS Finder icons. Now all you\n\nhave to do is edit their attributes in an icon editor, and maybe colourise\n\nthem if you want. Set the file type attribute of each one to $FFF1, if\n\nyour hard drive is SCSI. If it's not SCSI, set it to $FFF3, or maybe even\n\n$FFFD (this is what an older Sider partition would use). Set the file\n\nnames of each icon to the names of your partitions. Finally, put the new\n\nicon file in the Icons folder on your BOOT disk, to make sure that they\n\nwill show up.\n\nWhatever you do, don't put the icon for a partition in the Icons\n\nfolder of that partition itself (except for the boot partition) or the icon\n\nwon't show up. The reason for this is that, except for the boot partition,\n\nFinder shows the icon for the partition first, and THEN reads all of the\n\nicons on that partition. On the other hand, at the urging of myself and\n\nprobably several other people, Finder 6.0 reads all the icons on the boot\n\nvolume FIRST, and then shows that volume on the desktop. Having all of\n\nyour volume/partition icons on your boot volume makes sure that they're\n\nalways in memory before Finder starts looking at other devices.\n\nBTW, once you've got 'em working, why not upload them so we can all\n\ntake a look? -= Lunatic (:\n\n(CAT9, TOP2, MSG:142, M645;1)\n\nHyper Card Update Info I know why the upgrades for HCGS aren't available\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" thru Apple dealers (I had a big hand is\n\nestablishing that policy, so I should know... <grin>).\n\nWe wanted a single point of contact for customers upgrading and we\n\nwanted to keep the cost as low as possible. If the upgrade went through\n\nthe \"dealer\" channel, it would have _HAD_ to be packaged like a regular\n\nproduct (fancy box, etc) and that would have driven the cost up quickly.\n\nInstead, we chose to go through APDA. As reality unfolded, APDA worked out\n\na deal with Resource Central to allow RC to take over distribution of\n\nAPDA's A2 packages - including the soon-tob-be-released (at the time this\n\nhappened, HCGS v.1.1 hadn't quite been released yet) HCGS v.1.1 upgrade\n\npackage.\n\nBy putting the product through APDA, we could do away with the\n\ntraditional packaging requirements and get the cost down considerably.\n\nAs for why RC wasn't sent a list of registered owners - _THEY WERE_!\n\nBut that doesn't solve the problem you mentioned (avoiding having to send\n\nin your Installer & Tour disc [not \"discs\", \"disc\", only one disc and it's\n\nnamed \"Installer and Tour\"]). See, the vast majority of HCGS customers\n\nnever bothered to send in their registration cards, so we had no way of\n\ntelling RC who those users were. We didn't want to leave those users out,\n\nso RC established a policy that solved the problem at minimal hassle to the\n\ncustomer (a single floppy can be easily mailed in a normal envelope - I've\n\ndone it often when sending out updates to ShareWare subscribers).\n\nIf I left something unanswered, let me know...\n\nTim S.

I'm not familiar with them on the\n\nApple. Remember, Astronomer is a 16-Bit program. As for the speed...I\n\nknow it seems slow but there's a reason for it. All calculations are done\n\nin double precision and I don't use many of the approximation equations\n\nused by other programs. Where ever possible, I use the most accurate\n\ncalculation algorithums available (see Astronomical Algorithums by J.\n\nMeeus). The emphasis has always been on accuracy vs speed.\n\nHaving said that, I have found that some folks have had problems with\n\nincompatible DA's Inits etc that cause the program to slow WAY DOWN. Try\n\nbooting from System 6 holding the shift key down till the thermometer\n\nappears then run Astronomer and see if it improves. You must also remember\n\nthat for some routines the farther your date is from present, the longer\n\ncalcs may take. For a quick test, find the Sun Rise/Set time for your\n\narea on a date in 1991 (any date). If the calc takes less than 60- sec\n\nyou're probably OK.

And Nibbler, when you\n\n>say the Laser ram expansion behaves like the RamFactor from AE, what is\n\n>RamFactor and is it something that could be used with the Laser?\n\nI haven't attended here in awhile but just noticed all of the\n\ndiscussion on using the Laser 128EX's RAM disk.\n\nFor the Laser, Copy II+ is also a great utility for loading the RAM\n\ndisk, as well as ProSel 8. Like Prosel, you can copy all of the files in an\n\nentire directory by designating it, or you can copy the files one-by-one.\n\nCopying individual files has the advantage of allowing you to increase\n\ndesktop space by being selective about which subroutines you wish to use.\n\nFor example, you can leave out spread sheet, database, printer routines,\n\ndictionary or various TimeOut apps, if you want to increase desktop space.\n\nUse only your word processor and dictionary, your database, whatever. Both\n\nProSel and Copy II+ version 9 can be configured to launch apps from RAM.\n\nSince the RamFactor was mentioned, I thought I'd also add that if this\n\ncard is used with the Laser in the expansion box, I believe that you can\n\nincrease the Laser's RAM beyond 1 MB. The Laser's built- in RAM card is 1\n\nmeg only, while Ramfactor can go beyond 1 meg.\n\nI should also comment about \"Autocopy 2.\" If you want to get really\n\nfancy, Applied Engineering supplies a little utility with their RAM cards\n\ncalled \"Autocopy 2.\" It is an uncompiled basic program that you can go into\n\nand edit to suit your needs. Basically, Autocopy 2 copies everything in the\n\ndirectories you designate onto your RAM disk...automatically at bootup.\n\nThe advantage to Autocopy 2 over ProSel and Copy II+ is that it\n\noccupies very little memory if you're trying to cram a lot of apps on a\n\nsingle microfloppy. With Autocopy 2 installed on your microfloppy, you can\n\nsimply boot a disk. (It takes awhile for 500K + of applications to load to\n\nRAM, so go get a cup of coffee.) When you come back, press \"return,\" et\n\nvoila! No muss, no fuss; everything is the re in RAM.\n\nYou only have to know a little bit of basic, i.e. \"load,\" \"list,\"\n\n\"save,\" etc., and ProDOS file structure. The docs that come with Autocopy 2\n\ntell you the rest to let you customize it for yourself. I believe that\n\nthere are also some basic programs in the Genie library that will do the\n\nsame thing.\n\nI've always wondered why Apple didn't encourage programmers to use\n\nthese kinds of copy routines in their programs by manufacturing and selling\n\ntheir machines off-the-shelf with more RAM than the basic 64k or 128k. A\n\nstock Apple IIe or IIc with 512K or 1 MB would have been a nice product 6\n\nor 8 years ago. It sure would have been interesting to see what kinds of\n\nprograms developers would have come up with for an Apple with that kind of\n\nmemory. It would have kept Apple IIs more competitive (sigh!).\n\nNot being a programmer or engineer, I've never seen much difference\n\nbetween \"extended\" RAM, \"expanded\" RAM or RAM disk. Heck, if you can call a\n\nprogram's subroutine from memory instantly, what's the diff??\n\nGood Luck, J-Bird (J.CURTIS8, CAT2, TOP2, MSG:59/M645;1)\n\nSoftSwitch on 6.0 The SoftSwitch.Init file does have a problem with\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" System 6.0.

Thursday July 23,1992.\n\nThis morning at 9:05 Kansas time, Resource Central Founding father,\n\nUncle-Dos, otherwise known as Tom Weishaar, opened the Conference with a\n\nbrief talk on the 15 years of the Apple Ii computer. Tom followed his\n\ntalk with a surprise video of a telephone conversation with Steve Wozniak,\n\ntaking Steve on a 30-year trip down memory lane, including discussions of\n\n15 years of Pre-Apple II History. Steve praised many early contributors of\n\nthe Apple II line. Mike Markula, Del Yocam, Mike Scott, Chris Espinosa,\n\nRandy Wiggington, and Rod Holt were all praised by Steve. The 150\n\nConference Attendees were suitably impressed by the video, and really\n\nenjoyed it (despite the large numbers of hangovers in evidence from the\n\nimpromptu arrival parties which took place in the dorm rooms of Avila\n\nCollege last night).\n\nThe NOMDA Conference Center has provided excellent facilities for the\n\nConference, including an outstanding menu for lunches this year. Many\n\nparticipants enthusiastically commented on the menu.\n\nFollowing the break from Tom's opening and video, Tim Swihart -\n\nManager of the Apple II Continuing Engineering Team - gave a talk on the\n\nstatus of the Apple II. Included was a review of the past year since the\n\nannouncements made at last year's KansasFest. Three of the four product\n\nannouncements were actually brought to fruition, including Apple IIgs\n\nSystem Software v6.0, the Apple Superdrive Controller Card, and Hypercard\n\nIIgs.\n\nTim brought a few figures from Apple USA showing that there are nearly\n\n1 million Apple IIgs' in circulation. Of these, nearly 2/3s are Rom 01s,\n\nand about 3/4s are in Education environments. Very few have been accounted\n\nas \"Retired\". Tim gave these figures to explain Apple's current direction\n\nwith regard to the Apple II. The company has decided to reduce the level\n\nof staffing allocated to Apple II development and support. There are\n\ncurrently approximately a half dozen people with _some_ support staff\n\nassigned to the \"Apple II Continuing Engineering Team\", managed by Tim.\n\nApple has decided to place its efforts to maintaining and supporting the\n\nestablished User Base, as listed above.\n\nWith this in mind, APDA products have been turned over to Resource\n\nCentral for distribution. What this means, is that the Apple II products\n\nfrom APDA will receive more attention from the distributor, and because\n\nResource Central is already set up for it, there will continue to be\n\nWorldWide availability. Some products have been dropped from the line,\n\nsuch as APW-C. The Byteworks' ORCA/C is better maintained and supported,\n\nmore bug-free, and it is felt that in the best interests of the developers\n\nand users, it was better to discontinue the products.\n\nDevelopers were informed that other decisions have been made which\n\naffect them in a hopefully more positive light, such as the granting of\n\npermission to the Byteworks to publish the Official System 6.0 Reference\n\nmanual.\n\nIt was stressed that proper development under 6.0 _required_ this\n\nreference. It is less time consuming and expensive to do this, than for\n\nApple to continue publishing documents such as this, itself. Additionally,\n\nextensive effort has been put into updating the Techinical Notes. Steve\n\nGunn was praised by Matt Deatherage of Apple's Developer Technical Support\n\nfor taking on the thankless job of converting the Tech Notes into ASCII\n\nText files for uploading to the major Online Services.\n\nThe Apple II activity level at Apple, as previously reported, has been\n\nreduced, but it is certainly a non-zero level. The products fall under a\n\n\"Continuing Engineering\" group, which handles all post-release product\n\nissues. This includes handling bug reports, manufacturing difficulties,\n\ndistribution difficulties, etc. The Apple II C.E. group, as time allows,\n\nplan _some_ new work.\n\nThis has been identified to include System Software enhancements, but\n\nnothing at all in the way of a Major (i.e. System 7.0) update. What is\n\nplanned, are some new features, improved compatibility with 3rd party\n\nproducts, some enhancements for both the 8-bit and 16-bit platforms.\n\nTim proceeded to provide a few \"Sneak Peeks\" at the future, including\n\nthe one previously announced, but not-yet-released product - the Ethernet\n\nCard (announced at last year's KFest, but not mentioned since). The\n\noriginal design was discarded and the project was re-started. This, of\n\ncourse, wreaked havoc with the original schedule. As of this morning, the\n\nproject was nearing Beta Testing, and plans are to begin Seeding this week\n\n(during late Alpha phase). Apple hopes to begin shipping a finished product\n\nby the end of this year.\n\nThe card uses Friendlynet connectors. There is an expected\n\nsignificant speedup on crowded, multiple-machine systems. There is not\n\nexpected to be that significant a speedup noticed on smaller, isolated\n\nworkstations. The Ethernet card will require an Enhanced Apple IIe, or an\n\nApple IIgs. On the IIgs, System Software v6.0.1 !!!! will be required.\n\nApple IIgs System v6.0.1 is planned for release with the Ethernet\n\nCard. Support for the Ethernet Card is the Number 1 Priority. It will\n\ncontain new drivers, updates to some Control Panels, and it is expected\n\nthat there will be a few Low-Level changes, including bug fixes for\n\ncompatibility problems. The focus of the release will be user-oriented,\n\nnot developer-oriented (i.e. no new Toolsets).\n\nApple is currently investigating an MS-DOS FST. It is currently a\n\nread-only FST, but it is hoped that upon completion, it will be a\n\nread/write FST. It hasn't been fully tested yet, and may very well be\n\ndeferred beyond v6.0.1 rather than hold up release for supporting the\n\nEthernet Card.\n\nKeyboard Navigation is being added to the Finder. What this means is\n\nyou will be able to highlight a file in a window in the Finder by pressing\n\na letter on your keyboard, as you are currently able to do inside\n\napplications when opening a file. A more in-depth peek at System Software\n\nupdates will be forthcoming during the Apple Team's System 6.0 session on\n\nFriday morning.\n\nFollowing Tim's presentation was a lengthy Question and Answer period.\n\nOne question was about which drives do the MS-DOS FST work with? The\n\nanswer, provided by Apple's Greg Branche, was \"Any way you get it into the\n\ncomputer, the FST will recognize it\". However, it should be noted that a\n\nDisk II, or Apple 5.25 drive _cannot_ physically read an MS-DOS formatted\n\ndisk. The Apple drives are only capable of reading the GCR encoding for\n\nthe Low Level Format. MS-DOS disks are formatted with MFM encoding. Any\n\nMS-DOS formatted 3.5 disk can be read in a 3.5 High Density drive hooked up\n\nto an Apple SuperDrive Controller Card. If you have an MS-DOS formatted\n\nSyquest Cartridge and a Syquest mechanism in your SCSI bus, the MS-DOS FST\n\nwill be able to read it. An MS-DOS 5.25 disk can be read from a 5.25 drive\n\nhooked up to an Applied Engineering PCTransporter card, if the driver for\n\nit is installed.\n\nAnother question was whether the Superdrive Card supports 5.25 drives.\n\nThe answer was categorically NO. Any Apple brand 3.5 drive, such as the\n\nUnidisk, 3.5 drive, or High Density 3.5 drive are supported. It was\n\nreported by a Conference Attendee that Applied Engineering's High Density\n\ndrive works with the Superdrive Card.\n\nA participant asked for more information about the Ethernet Card. Tim\n\nexplained that, because it does not support TCP/IP, a networking protocol,\n\nthe engineers wanted to call the card the EtherTALK card. It was decided\n\nthat, to avoid Customer Confusion, it would remain the Ethernet Card.\n\nApple hopes to support TCP/IP in the future, perhaps with a ROM revision.\n\nThere was much discussion, some of it with kind of vague direction,\n\nlooking for clues about the future of the Apple II. Tim was not able to\n\nsatisfactorily answer all of the concerns. Decisions concerning these\n\nquestions are made at levels above Tim's area of responsibility. To be\n\nfair, Tim did the best he could. Unfortunately, many people appeared\n\ndisappointed by his answers.\n\nKansasFest is off and Running!

Why? Well, I'm being quite\n\nhonest when I say that there hasn't been a lot in the way of \"newsworthy\"\n\nitems.\n\nThe first two days of the event were devoted to Apple IIgs\n\n\"colleges,\" which were devoted to various aspects of Apple II programming.\n\nUnfortunately there's not a whole lot to say about them. People learned\n\nabout programming with things like C and HyperStudio. Those who attended\n\nthe colleges that we asked about them said that they enjoyed them and\n\nlearned about how to program these environments, but otherwise not much can\n\nbe said except that people had fun, learned things, and enjoyed meeting\n\nother Apple II users from across the country.\n\nIt's been a great deal of fun renewing old acquaintances and meeting\n\nnew faces. One of the neatest things about KansasFest is meeting people\n\nfrom across the country, especially meeting people I've seen many times\n\nhere on GEnie for the first time.\n\nBut the first two days were odd, because, well, the programming\n\ncolleges were exactly that - colleges. People learned about how to do\n\nthings with C, or with HyperStudio, or whatever. Not a whole lot to say\n\nabout those. <wink>\n\nYesterday KansasFest \"proper\" started with the hourly sessions and new\n\nannouncements, and I think Donnie Grimes covered that real well. There\n\nare a few other things to talk about besides some of the things he\n\nmentioned.\n\nProbably the session that has the most people interested would be the\n\none on Bill Heineman's Avater project. Avatar, for those who haven't\n\nheard, is supposed to be a \"next generation\" Apple IIgs computer.\n\nBoiled down to its essence, what was revealed about the Avatar was:\n\nA) It will use a 10 Mhz 65816 chip,\n\nB) It will use an Ensoniq chip for sound, perhaps the one Apple currently\n\nuses or perhaps a more advanced one,\n\nC) Instead of using Apple type equipment, such as ADB devices, it will\n\nrely extensively on off-the-shelf MS-DOS compatible equipment,\n\nD) It will use a complicated bus-arbitration scheme to share processing\n\nwith other computers.\n\nThose last are probably the most interesting two. Avatar will use a\n\ngreat deal of IBM-style equipment, including four IBM \"AT\" style slots, IBM\n\nstyle keyboards, and IBM-style interfaces for such things as hard drives,\n\ndisk drives, and CD-ROM drives.\n\nAvater is also designed to share processing with other, plug-and-play\n\nprocessing units. So, for example, you'll be able to plug in a card that\n\nuses an 80386 processor, and with software supplied by the manufacturer\n\nyou'll be allowed to run MS-DOS software on it. But not just MS-DOS cards,\n\nit will be theoretically possible to design plug-in cards to run Macintosh\n\n(if the ROMs could ever be made to work), Amiga, Atari ST, Nintendo, Lynx,\n\nor other systems.\n\nAvatar will require its own custom operating system, which Mr.\n\nHeineman is anticipating having to \"clean room\" design (meaning, have\n\nsomeone write the software from the ground up, using programmers who've\n\nnever even seen Apple's code but who have seen the publically available\n\nspecifications to the system software).\n\nBill said he is almost certain he'll get sued if he goes through with\n\nAvatar, in which case he says he hopes to either get Apple to license the\n\ntoolbox to him, or to be able to weather the lawsuit if not.\n\nHe also says that he hopes to have working prototypes available for\n\nprogrammers by the next KansasFest, and if all goes well he hopes to have\n\nit available for sale to consumers by spring of 1994.\n\nWhen asked where he was getting funding, Heineman was rather evasive,\n\nsaying that he couldn't actually give full information on that.\n\nAfter the presentation, it appeared that a great number of people were\n\nskeptical. Programmers and engineers who saw the project stated that they\n\nthought the idea was all very interesting, but reactions ranged from, at\n\nits most negative, \"I wonder who his drug dealer is,\" to, at its most\n\npositive, \"it's an interesting fantasy, but I won't believe any of it until\n\nI see a working prototype.\"\n\nHeineman seems to think he can make his machine Apple IIgs compatible\n\nby using a whole lot of custom chips to duplicate or work around Apple's\n\npatents and copyrights without infringing on them, while at the same time\n\noffering a machine with a whole new purpose - a sort of \"chameleon\n\ncomputer\" that supports parallel processing that boasts the ability to have\n\ncompatibility with many other systems, while starting with a base unit that\n\nalready runs an established base of software - i.e. Apple II and Apple IIgs\n\nsoftware. He said that he sees his main competition as being the Macintosh\n\nLC II, and that the education market appears to be his biggest potential\n\nmarket.\n\nWhatever the truth of Avatar, it appears that a lot of experts are\n\nhighly skeptical if not outright scoffing, and at best this machine can't\n\npossibly be available to consumers in less than two years or so.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nIn the meatime, KansasFest has been an exciting even for Apple II\n\nusers, serving as a meeting ground for Apple II users from all over the\n\nworld, and a place where at least a few significant new announcements have\n\nbeen made.\n\nMore in the next few days as things progress.\n\nBy the way, be sure to check out A2Pro's bulletin board, especially\n\nCategory 1, Topic 17, for some interesting programmer-related stuff on this\n\nyear's KansasFest! ;-) -Dean Esmay\n\n(A2.DEAN, Category 44, Topic 4, Message 6, M645;1)\n\n>>>>> The Down Under crew are very talented programmers.

He wasn't really negative, just uncertain.\n\nThis is no time to be throwing wet blankets on any new possibilities\n\nin the Apple II world.

It's too early to tell if a new product will result from these\n\nexperiments, but a few people in the room felt that a basic unit could be\n\nmade to sell at under $200 list.\n\nI watched in amazement as Roger hauled the tools of his trade out of\n\nhis shipping cartons while setting up the demo: a crazed rat's nest of\n\ncables and one gadget after another, including a breadboard video gadget,\n\nvideo camera, an 8mm VCR/color TV in a package roughly the size and shape\n\nof a 5 lb. sack of flour (didn't catch the maker), a Canon video still\n\ncamera that stores 50 images on a 2 inch magnetic disk, and lesser items.\n\nHe had composite and RGB monitors on the GS and a Video Overlay Card\n\ninside. Sitting amid this jumble, Roger enthusiastically demo'd the\n\nconcepts he's working on to a crowd spilling out into the corridor. After\n\na couple of hours, about 11:30, I got tired and went off to bed. Roger\n\nwas still going strong.\n\nHe can generate video letters on 8 mm tapes with a HyperStudio demo\n\non the main screen and himself in the inset screen, or vice versa, and\n\nmentioned many variations on this theme.\n\nHe has ideas for enhancements to HyperStudio that will enable\n\npreschoolers to use it with a mouse or even a touch screen, a purely\n\naudiovisual approach for non-readers.\n\nRoger's enthusiasm is catching, and representative of the overall\n\nmood at KansasFest this year. Few negative comments to be heard. We know\n\nwhat to expect from Apple now, and we're focusing on the new and nifty.\n\nDespite the lack of spectacular announcements thus far, there are plenty of\n\nnew things happening to keep Apple II enthusiasts pleasantly and\n\nproductively occupied. -Bill Dooley\n\n(A2.BILL, CAT44, TOP9, MSG:3/M645;1)\n\n>>>>> I thought some of you might enjoy a clip from some of our late\n\n\"\"\"\"\" night follies.

Most of us spend a lifetime trying to hone and develop these native\n\nborn talents to maximize both our own potential and our contribution to the\n\ngreater social good.\n\nBut rarely can anybody these days maximize his or her talents working\n\ncloistered and alone. In this world of increasing specialization and\n\ncomplexity, rare indeed is the individual who achieves great success\n\nworking independently on his or her own.\n\nLong ignored and overlooked, the wonders of collaborative creativity\n\nare just beginning to be understood and appreciated. In an important and\n\nrevealing new book, Shared Minds: The New Technologies of Collaboration,\n\nsyndicated columnist Michael Schrage examines both the nature of the\n\ncollaborative process and methods of \"fanning the collaborative flame.\"\n\nWith frequent reference to legendary creative collaborative teams of the\n\npast (Orville and Wilbur Wright, Watson and Crick, Jobs and Wozniak, Lennon\n\nand McArtney), Schrage articulates truths that well deserve to be lifted to\n\nthe forefront of our consciousness.\n\nHow This Book Came to be Written Initially Shared Minds was to be a book\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" about the social dynamics of business\n\nmeetings, and how new technologies can help streamline these dynamics. But\n\nthe author soon realized that the most interesting group work doesn't occur\n\nin large business meetings, but in small, energetic teams. So instead of\n\nwriting a book about business meetings, he decided to closely examine the\n\nnature of creative \"small group\" collaborations. After interviewing many\n\nfamous scientific and artistic \"collaborative teams,\" Schrage spent a year\n\nas a visiting scholar at MIT's Media Lab synthesizing the ideas in this\n\nbook.\n\nThe Personal Attributes of\n\nSuccessful Collaborative Teams One of the probing questions\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" examined in this book is: \"What\n\npersonal attributes contribute to successful collaborative joint ventures?\"\n\nHow is it that the family team of Orville and Wilbur Wright worked so well\n\ntogether, when other sibling pairs find it a struggle to order pizza\n\ntogether? And what role did Orville and Wilbur's parents play in fostering\n\ntheir creativity and perseverance. (Apparently Orville and Wilbur's mother\n\nplayed a decisive role in showing her sons the methodology of creative\n\ninvention.)\n\nAlong the same lines of thought, what personal qualities allowed\n\nWatson and Crick to work together to formulate their landmark\n\nthree-dimensional model of DNA? True, they had differing and complementary\n\nscientific backgrounds. But more than that, they both had a hunger to\n\nunderstand the physical structure of DNA. That intellectual hunger united\n\nthem in a focused scientific quest.\n\nSpeaking on the subject of collaboration, Crick, in his memoirs, sheds\n\nlight on the nature of his successful teaming with Watson: \"Our...advantage\n\nwas that we had evolved an unstated but fruitful methods of\n\ncollaboration....If either of us suggested a new idea, the other, while\n\ntaking it seriously, would attempt to demolish it in a candid but\n\nnonhostile manner.\" Good collaborative teams, therefore, have a tacit\n\nunderstanding that individual ego must necessarily be subsumed to the\n\nlarger team goal.\n\nExamples of How a \"Sharing\n\n\"\"\"\" Ideology\" Can Develop Another subject examined in the book is the\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" similar \"sharing ideology\" used by great\n\nartists and great scientists. There comes a time when human beings rise\n\nabove the possessive attitude of \"that's an idea I thought of first\" to the\n\ngrander attitude of \"that's an idea I had a part in creating.\"\n\nOne moving anecdote about collaborative artists occurred when Picasso\n\nand his close associates stopped signing their paintings for a brief period\n\nin their lives. These artists worked so closely together in producing new\n\nart that they genuinely believed that signing any of their paintings would\n\nbe a misrepresentation of \"authorship.\" In this case, keeping track of who\n\nproduced which paintings became subservient to the group goal of producing\n\nexcellent group paintings.\n\nThoughts About \"Idea Development\" At another point in the book Schrage\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" examines the concept of \"idea\n\ndevelopment.\" How is it that ideas get developed from nascent whims to\n\nfull-fledged notions? Quoting a modern expert on the subject, John Cleese\n\n(the gifted comic writer of Monty Python fame): \"The really good idea is\n\nalways traceable back quite a long way, often to a not very good idea which\n\nsparked off another idea that was only slightly better, which somebody else\n\nmisunderstood in such a way that they then said something which was really\n\nrather interesting.... [That's] actually why I have always worked with a\n\nwriting partner, because I'm convinced that I get to better ideas than I'd\n\never do on my own.\"\n\nOne perceptive observation in Shared Minds is that some of the best\n\ncollaborative work occurs in informal, playful settings. The proverbial\n\ndoodle, hastily sketched on a cafeteria napkin, serves as a forceful\n\nreminder of how creativity can best be unleashed in informal settings.\n\nLikewise, brainstorming sessions in a formal conference room seldom yield\n\nmemorable creative results.\n\nAll in all, Shared Minds is an important, thought-provoking book. If\n\nyou've ever spent time thinking about the wonders of collaborative\n\ncreativity, you ought to find a rich vein of ideas to mine in this book.\n\nThe very act of reading the book ought to stimulate those areas of the\n\nbrain responsible for the \"open-minded\" reception of new and interesting\n\nideas.\n\nWant To Know More? If you're interested in reading further about the\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" subjects of creativity and collaboration, you might\n\nbe interest in some of the recommended readings at the end of Shared Minds.\n\nHere is a list of some of the juicier sounding titles.]\n\nBijker, Wiebe E., Hughes, Thomas P., and Trevor Pinch, eds.\n\nThe Social Construction of Technological Systems: New\n\nDirections in the Sociology of and History of Technology.\n\nCambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987.\n\nBoettinger, Henry.

This is\n\nnot a review in the strictest since of the word because I am not a\n\nprogrammer nor a musician and also SoniqTracker and MODzap are not\n\ncompleted programs. This article is written from the stand point of a\n\nmusic lover and an Apple IIGS fanatic.\n\nFirst a bit of back ground concerning the Apple IIGS and music\n\nprograms. Music Construction Set was one of the first, followed by Music\n\nStudio. Music Construction Set was mostly just a music player were as\n\nMusic Studio was more a word processor for music. Both programs had there\n\nlimitations and regardless how hard they tried they still didn't sound\n\nlike violins or horns. Mostly they sounded like organs trying to sound\n\nlike violins or trumpets. They did fairly well with pianos and guitars but\n\nwhen it came to holding long notes or adding color to the music, forget it.\n\nThe music sounded like computer generated music. We were happy with these\n\nprograms at the time because they sounded great when compared to previous\n\nApple II music programs. Diversi-Tune sounded a bit better but again was\n\nmostly just a play back program, although I loved the bouncing ball.\n\nThe next great music composition program was SoundSmith. The first to\n\nincorporate a spreadsheet like front-end for the IIGS, SoundSmith made\n\nwriting original and cover music relatively simple with a minimum of\n\ncomplexity. As its newer versions progressed, new features were added\n\nmaking it possible to breathe greater life into the music. And while the\n\nprofessional software community often ignore d the effort, SoundSmith\n\nquickly became the new standard in IIGS music. Recently, the SoundSmith\n\nfairy tale came to a bitter end when a beta tester for a commercial version\n\nbroke the non-disclosure agreement and caused the author to abandon work\n\non the application.\n\nThen came NoiseTracker GS from the french base group the Free Tool\n\nAssociation or FTA. With its rich, full basses and quality, high\n\nfidelity, and full dynamic range of instruments this was indeed the next\n\ngeneration in music software for the Apple IIGS. This was the first music\n\nprogram to break the 64K size barrier for instruments and could provide\n\nfull rich sounds never before heard on any Apple computer.\n\nNoiseTracker GS is SoundSmith compatible so all the available\n\nSoundSmith songs and instruments could be used. NoiseTracker GS also\n\nincludes an editor which can be used by musicians to create a full range\n\nof musical sounds only limited by their imaginations. Just about any sound\n\ncan be made into an instrument including human voices.\n\nEven a novice like myself can re-orchestrate compositions with the\n\nInstrument Add, Replace and Delete features of the program. I was able to\n\nsetup the stereo effects that I wanted by setting instruments to the right\n\nor left channels or both. I was also able to set the tracks to a desired\n\nright or left channel. If the bass drum is too loud, just lower the volume\n\non that one instrument. Does the song seem to be playing to slowly for\n\nyou, change the tempo.\n\nThe main difference between NoiseTracker GS and all previous music\n\nprograms was its ability to sustain long notes and the ability to import\n\nAmiga Mods. Music can be saved in two different formats, a songs file with\n\na separate instrument wave file or as modules which include the instruments\n\nin one file.\n\nSpeaking of modules, Amiga MODs. It is somewhat limited in this\n\ncapability in that NoiseTracker does not support all the special effects\n\nrequired by Amiga MODs. However, you can load in an Amiga MOD file and\n\nsave it as a NoiseTracker module. If you then load the NoiseTracker module\n\nyou can use the NoiseTracker program to change tempo, change instruments,\n\netc., as with any other NoiseTracker son g.\n\nThe music editor screen is well organized and easy to use. To play a\n\nSoundSmith or NoiseTracker song you simply \"Open Musicfiles\" from the Music\n\npull down menu, then select the \"Scrolly Player\" which shows you a 15\n\nchannel VU meter. Like all FTA software there are \"Easter Eggs\" hidden\n\ninside the program. Click on the Scrolly Player and notes will come flying\n\naround the screen. Click on the song title location and the program\n\nchanges colors, gray, blue, green or black.\n\nThere appears to be a running gun battle between SoniqTracker and\n\nMODzap as to who can write the best Amiga MOD player for the Apple IIGS.\n\nBoth programs have jukebox features and you can load in a list of your\n\nfavorite Amiga MOD songs and listen for hours on end.\n\nI like the \"Dancing Lights\" in SoniqTracker and the more conventional\n\nlook of the player. The Player controls are more in line with those of a\n\nstandard CD player with Volume control and Mono or Full Stereo or even 25%,\n\n50%, or 75% Stereo. In Jukebox mode the N key takes you to the next song.\n\nThe Track Meter is also a nice feature. The Volume control is especially\n\nnice for those of us without external volume controls on our speakers.\n\nSoniqTracker is indeed an impressive program and plays Amiga MOD song with\n\ncrisp, clear sounds and superior channel separation. The documentation is\n\nadequate but a bit preachy.\n\nMODzap is more technically oriented and supports more features in\n\nsetting up the player. For example there is a \"Force 31 Inst\" and \"Force\n\n15 Inst\" in the \"File\" pull down menu. I have never had an occasion to use\n\nthese selections but they are there. Another feature is the ability to\n\nloop the music so if you like a particular song you can have it played over\n\nand over in a continues loop. Under the Option menu are options such as\n\nIgnore Tuning and Ignore Arpeggiatos, also Turbo, Normal, Enhanced and\n\nPremium. The documentation is not very clear as to what Tuning or\n\nArpeggiotos means or when to use these options. Turbo, Normal, Enhance and\n\nPremium has to do with the quality of the play back. However again the\n\ndocumentation is not to clear as to what the differences are between them\n\nor when to use them.\n\nMODzap version 0.8 added a keyboard so that you can select an\n\ninstrument from the currently load Amiga MOD and play it on the keyboard.\n\nThe sound quality is superior on some selected Amiga MODs but t his mostly\n\nhas to do with special effects such as bends up and down.\n\nOverall the music outlook for the Apple IIGS is tremendous.\n\nSoniqTracker and MODzap are still in there development stages but already\n\nshow a great future for music on the Apple IIGS. The developers of these\n\ntwo wonderful programs are to be congratulated and encouraged. Although\n\nboth of these programs are currently freeware, your monetary\n\nconsiderations would help to keep things going. The dream music program\n\nwould be a combination of all three of the music programs. Compatible with\n\nSound Smith, NoiseTracker GS and play Amiga MODs with all the required\n\nspecial effects. Editing capabilities currently available in SoundSmith\n\nand NoiseTracker GS should be compatible with all formats. Hopefully this\n\nis what the developers of soniqTracker and MODzap are working towards. We\n\ncan only hope.\n\n[EOA]\n\n[COW]//////////////////////////////\n\nCowTOONS! /\n\n/////////////////////////////////\n\nMoooooo Fun!\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nBy Patrick Hart\n\n[P.HART4]\n\n______\n\n| |\n\n| (__) |\n\n| (OO) |\n\n| \\/ |\n\n| |\n\n======\n\n\"Cow Caught at Bootup\"\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n| ______ |\n\n| | | |\n\n| | (__) | Welcome to MacCOWintosh |\n\n| | (OO) | |\n\n| | \\/ | |\n\n| | | |\n\n| ====== |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n|_____________About This MacCOWintosh_____________|\n\n| |\n\n| System COWware 1.0.7* |\n\n| MacCOWintosh IIcow (c) Cow Computer, Inc. |\n\n| |\n\n| Total Memory: 307,200K Largest Unused Block: 1K |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n| System Usage: 307,199K |||||||||||||||||||||| | |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n| ______ |\n\n| | | The application 'unknown' has |\n\n| | (__) | unexpectedly quit, because an error of |\n\n| | (OO) | type C occurred. ______ |\n\n| | \\/ | | | |\n\n| | | | OK | |\n\n| ====== |______| |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n| ______ |\n\n| | | Force The Cow to quit? |\n\n| | (__) | System failure will occur. |\n\n| | (OO) | ___________ ________ |\n\n| | \\/ | | | | | |\n\n| | | | Force Out | | Cancel |J|\n\n| ====== |___________| |________| |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n| ______ |\n\n| | | The application has unexpectedly quit. |\n\n| | (__) | The Cow suggests user error. |\n\n| | (OO) | _________ |\n\n| | \\/ | | | |\n\n| | | | Restart | |\n\n| ====== |_________| |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n| ______ |\n\n| | | |\n\n| | (__) | There is not enough memory to open |\n\n| | (OO) | TapplicationU (100,000K needed, 1K |\n\n| | \\/ | available). |\n\n| | | |\n\n| ====== To make more memory available, try |\n\n| adding more RAM. ______ |\n\n| | | |\n\n| | OK | |\n\n| |______| |\n\n|_________________________________________________|\n\n[*][*][*]\n\n(__) CowTOONS?

Have you ever wished that you could\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" run your own mini telecommunications\n\nservice? Wouldn't it be interesting to control passwords, monitor\n\ndiscussions, and maintain a file download library? Well Apple II users are\n\nlucky to have quite a large selection of BBS options available to them.\n\nAnd some of these BBS's are even freeware or shareware.\n\nA search under the keyword \"BBS\" in the Apple II Roundtable library\n\nturns up several dozen files relating to running your own BBS. Some of\n\nthese files are actual BBS programs.\n\nSome of the BBS options for the Apple II include the public domain\n\n\"Prime BBS,\" the shareware \"AppleNET BBS,\" and the shareware \"Office BBS\"\n\nsystem. Most of these BBS's use ModemWorks, a special set of modem\n\nampersand routines develop by the Morgan Davis Group.\n\nTo help you learn what GEnie has to offer in terms of Apple II BBS's,\n\na new AppleWorks file titled \"BBS.Files.bxy\" has been prepared. This file\n\nlists all the BBS files available for downloading from the A2 Roundtable\n\nlibrary, along with file descriptions of some of the more interesting\n\nsounding files.\n\nWHY A BBS? \"Why would someone want to set up and maintain his or her own\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" BBS?\" you might ask. Many user groups find that a BBS\n\nfacilitates user group communications. But the BBS you set up need not be\n\ncomputer related. You could set up a BBS for your local school or PTA; you\n\ncould set up a BBS for a boy scout or girl scout troop; you could set up a\n\ncrime prevention BBS; you could set up a BBS to offer editing or desktop\n\npublishing services; you could set up a BBS just to learn about what it\n\ntakes to run a BBS.\n\nLearning about bulletin boards need not even require a modem. Dean\n\nEsmay, chief Apple II Roundtable system operator (sysop) recommends KidMail\n\nBBS, a bulletin board simulator. (File number 8723: KidMail.bxy). This\n\nprogram simulates an actual BBS allowing multiple 'users' to 'sign on,' get\n\na password, and leave electronic mail for other users.\n\nWith the price of second hand Apple IIe's dropping down to the $200 to\n\n$300 range, the cost of setting up a BBS has likewise fallen dramatically.\n\nYou don't even need a hard drive with some Apple II BBS systems. (Although\n\nalmost all of them recommend at least two 5.25 inch, or one 3.5 inch disk\n\ndrive.)\n\nThe following information about the popular public domain Prime\n\nbulletin board system (BBS) was collected from Category 10, Topic 6, in the\n\nApple II Roundtable message area.\n\nPrime BBS A while ago one of you asked us to step back and explain what\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" the Prime BBS was and what it had going for it. I was so\n\nbusy uploading files and getting some beginner downloaders going that I\n\nneglected to respond to that posted message. Hopefully, I can rectify that\n\nhere in a question and answer format. By doing a few of these, I hope I\n\ncan answer the most frequently asked questions. Here we go....\n\nQ: What is Prime? Is it new? Why haven't I heard of it before?\n\nA: The Prime BBS system has been around the Apple II world for 7-8 years\n\nnow. It began as Alfa III and was supported right here on GEnie by Bob\n\nGarth and Vince Cooper. The program was advertised in classifieds of\n\nmajor magazines but most of its customers (including me) got in\n\ncontact with the authors by way of the Demo/Ad called Alfa/EZ. The\n\nmost recent support for the program was in the Smoke Signal Software\n\narea on America Online.\n\nPrime is a great BBS and now that its in the Public Domain, is the\n\npotential new sysop's _best_ option possible. I've seen a lot of\n\nshareware and p.d. BBS's over the years and nothing compares to Prime.\n\nThis software is PERFECT for smaller BBS systems of the 10-200 user\n\nvariety...great for user group boards, local Apple II support groups\n\netc. It can handle much larger user numbers, but I find it perfectly\n\nsuited for smaller groups.\n\nQ: What do I need to run it?\n\nA: You need any 64K Apple ][. I've run it or helped run it on ][+'s,\n\n//e's, Franklin Ace's, and IIGS's. You need two or more disk drives.\n\nA hard drive is not necessary...but recommended. I've run this software\n\non everything from 4 Disk II's up to 200+ megs of hard drive all chained\n\ntogether off a RamFast and a TransWarp GS. In addition, you need a\n\nNovation AppleCat, Hayes Micromodem, Datalink 2400, or a Super Serial\n\nCard with an auto-answer 300, 1200, or 2400 external modem. Others may\n\nwork, but may take some playing around... A Prodos compatible clock is\n\nnice but not mandatory.\n\nQ: What are the limitations of Prime and why did it go public domain?\n\nA: The most recent owner of Prime (Danny Haynes) found that he and the\n\nothers responsible for maintaining Prime simply did not have time to\n\nupdate the system. They concluded that Prime would have the best\n\nchance of growing in the hands of a new generation of Prime\n\nSysops....so, they decided to offer it to potential Prime sysops for\n\nFREE! Prime is currently a full featured BBS. We'll talk about all\n\nthose features a bit later, but we might as well get the limitations\n\nout in the open first because these are the things that we hope new\n\nPrime sysops will help to rectify.\n\n1. Prime requires a Super Serial Card (SSC) (even in a GS). Bob Garth\n\nfound that the Apple modem port didn't do things quite the same way\n\nas the SSC and never supported the port. Paul Parkhurst has this\n\nproblem 'almost' fixed but we all need to call him and encourage\n\nhim to finish that goodie.\n\n2. Prime's transer (Xfer) system is GREAT. However, support for newer\n\nprotocols is lacking. It does handle normal Xmodem, Xmodem CRC,\n\nProdos Xmodem, Standard Xmodem, (with Binary II for Apple users).\n\nYmodem and Zmodem would be nice if someone has the ability to take\n\nit on. Andy Nicholas posted once that he had written a Zmodem\n\ndriver for Prime but we've not tracked that down yet.\n\n3. While Prime sysops across the country once had a networking scheme\n\nset up, this never became an official part of Prime. Prime's strong\n\npoint are its elegance and simplicity. I'm sure future sysops will\n\nbe writing schemes to network but they don't currently exist.\n\n4. I've never heard of Prime's compatibility with newer 9600 baud\n\nmodems. New drivers or empirical set-ups may need to be developed\n\nfor these.\n\nThat's about it! Not really too limited is it? Frankly, I've never\n\nfound any of these detrimental to my BBS.\n\nQ: What features does Prime offer?\n\nA: Prime is a full-featured BBS. I'll summarize only a few here....\n\n1. Hot key menus of either the autoformatting internal type\n\nor fancy ones made from external text files of your design.\n\n2. Multiple Boards, Email, full line editors for all posts\n\nand mail. New message scans. Autosignature capability.\n\nPrivate posts can be set. Autodelete old messages at sysop\n\ncontrollable levels to minimize sysop interaction required.\n\nMany more options.\n\n3. Feedback commands, sysop page and chat mode.\n\n4. User can set configuration from normal to expert turning\n\nmenus on and off.\n\n5. User search and listing built in.\n\n6. G(iant) file reader to allow readers to read any text\n\nfiles the sysop chooses to put online.\n\n7. Complete transfer system capable of tracking up to 215,622\n\nfiles and 10 line description of each in up to 99 libraries\n\nof 99 files each in each of 22 prefixes! New file scans can\n\nbe set up in multiple combinations for your users convenience.\n\n8. BASIC programs and Games can easily be modified to run with\n\nthe Prime BBS system. Many examples have been uploaded here\n\nto GEnie. The modifications are pretty easy and lots of fun.\n\nThese include user Voting Booths, BBS databases, Adventure\n\ngames, etc.\n\nQ: What does the Sysop have to work with?\n\nA: A lot! There is a completely menu driven maintenance system. The\n\nsysop simply keys up a Control-C from the keyboard and can then menu\n\nhis/her way to anything in Prime that needs attention. Among these are:\n\n1. Board and Menu editors.\n\n2. Prefixes (you can put any part of Prime on any prefix\n\non your system).\n\n3. User time restrictions can be set by time limits (if you\n\nhave clock) or number of bytes transmitted if you don't.\n\n4. You can create and toggle on or off Pre and Post new user\n\nmessages and Pre and Post login in messages.\n\n5. You can create Theme messages at the beginning of each board\n\nto keep things going in a reasonable thread.\n\n6. Email and transfer have their own complete set of utilities...\n\nall accessible with the Control-C when you've entered their\n\narea.\n\n7. Remote sysoping available on ALL features so you can take\n\ncare of the system from a remote location or have a co-sysop\n\ncare for the system while you're on vacation.\n\nQ: What about SECURITY? Can I closely control what users see what on\n\nmy BBS?\n\nA: Yes, more than you will ever need. There are 9 user class codes for\n\ngross set ups. In addition, each user has a 19 byte index string that\n\ndetermines what he can do on your BBS. Each of these bytes can be set\n\nfrom A to Z. You can then tie EVERY MENU KEY to one of these bytes and\n\nlevels and therefore control who can execute (or even SEE) these\n\ncommands. In addition, the sysop can give users ability to post\n\nprivate messages, make entire boards restricted, record phone numbers\n\nthat the system will not accept for a user, allow or disallow login of\n\nnew users, offer a side door entry with proper password.... and allow\n\nor disallow the use of alias's for users. All these things are handled\n\nwith ease by way of the comprehensive menu and user data editors.\n\nQ: Who is this Goose fellow?\n\nA: Nobody special.. I've been using and enjoying Prime (and its\n\npredecessors) for nearly 8 years. Its been so much fun that I've\n\nlearned just enough about it to be dangerous. I hate to see such a\n\nstrong BBS die just because nobody knows about it. I'll help anyone\n\nwho tries to use it. No guarantees, but hopefully this is a GREAT way\n\nto start small inexpensive pockets of Apple II users. My old trusty\n\nII+ sits in the corner with a castoff 30 megabyte Seagate hanging there\n\nserving as our user group communication port. How about it? Can you\n\nuse your old hardware to create your own private user group? Go for\n\nit! <Grin>....

Their demos, including ACS Demo, Modulae, California Demo,\n\nXmas Demo, Animaga, and Delta Demo pushed the IIGS to the limit with their\n\nastounding 3 dimensional animations and rock n roll soundtracks. The\n\nfreeware FTA games of Easy Dead, Flobynoid, Star Wizard, and Mini Prix have\n\nprovided countless GS owners with innumerable hours of super hi res fun.\n\nTheir shareware disk copy program, Photonix, must be the only copy program\n\nin existence that contains animation and music and efficiently copies\n\nentire 3.5\" disks in just one pass, using only a single 3.5\" disk drive.\n\nNoiseTracker, released in December of 1991, must surely be the most talked\n\nabout IIGS music program of 1992.\n\nAnd then, as 1991 drew to a close, the FTA disbanded. According to FTA\n\nfounder and president, Olivier Goguel, \"We stopped programming for the IIGS\n\nfor a lot of reasons, but we don't deny it and are still very proud of what\n\nwe've done, or tried to do on it\".\n\nThe FTA may be gone, but they will surely never be forgotten. They\n\nhave left a legacy for the rest of us who remain with the IIGS. They showed\n\nus what was possible, and they inspired and stimulated us by demonstrating\n\njust how much fun it can be to own a IIGS. In our hearts and minds, the FTA\n\nwill live forever.\n\nIn late Spring, 1992, a package arrived in SiliKohn Valley with a\n\npostmark of Dijon, France. The package contained a number of disks, and\n\nthey were described by Olivier Goguel as \"the latest gifts from the former\n\nFTA group to the IIGS community\". Just as the FTA's software resulted in so\n\nmuch joy and fun and respect for the IIGS, we would like to use those gifts\n\nas a way"
