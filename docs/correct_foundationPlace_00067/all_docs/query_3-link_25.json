        "text": "Hello Disc is celebrating a year since the very first customers began receiving their discs. Thanks to Robyn McLean and the entire Hello Period™ team thousands of menstruators now have a more accessible and easier to use disc option. The concept was a first and while it looks simple now, making this come to life was a HUGE feat of manufacturing/molding. Not to mention the risk that it might not work as hoped. Seeing the success of Hello Disc today and the amazing reviews it receives daily is an actual dream come true. I knew it was a risk to move from \"advocate/educator/retailer\" to \"named co-designer.\" I just felt so strongly that this concept in my head was NEEDED in the world that I partnered with one of my favorite indie brands. Hello Period continues to be an amazing partner despite the many challenges faced in this space. Our values align perfectly, something more important to me than anything when this journey began. With success and good design inevitably comes imitators. I struggle with this. Is it flattering? Yes. Is it a bit upsetting? Also yes. Can it be confusing? Again, yes. When is something a direct copy versus \"inspired by\" versus \"inevitable design trend?\" Hello Disc holds a very special place in my heart but I am also always rooting for the consumer to find their Period Nirvana™️ (is this the time to mention the trademark finally came through after years of working on it?!) Our design set the trend for a new era of reusable period care that recognized the amazing comfort of existing menstrual discs while also providing a solution to the most frustrating part. And in the background 1-2 brands were addressing those issues in other ways even before our design went public. After that, dozens started working on other concepts and several are now available that did a great job designing for the problem without copying existing designs. I am rooting for them, too. Hello Disc was the first but it won't be the last. That is a win for menstruators. And when I wear my retail hat I will be looking for brands who truly understand the difference between putting their own expertise on an emerging trend and copying another brand exactly :) So many of the best designs, Hello Disc included, built on the foundation of existing products. Without SoftDisc of the 1990's there would never have been a Hello Disc. Or, we could go way back and say without the diaphragm there would have been no SoftDisc. Modern menstrual cups today all share foundational design principles with very first modern menstrual cup from the 1930's, right down to the stem and suction holes. The reusable product market is big and it's growing. Innovation and competition are healthy parts of any industry. #design #innovation #brand #femtech #menstrualhealth"
