        "meta_description": "(Abridged) An issue of considerable interest in the theory of jet formation by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, is how plasma is being continuously supplied to the magnetosphere to maintain it in a force-free state. Injection of electron-positron pairs via annihilation of MeV photons, emitted from a hot accretion flow, has been shown to be a viable possibility, but requires a high enough accretion rate. At lower accretion rates, and in the absence of any other form of plasma supply, the magnetosphere becomes charge starved, forming intermittent spark gaps that can induce intense pair cascades via interactions with soft disk radiation, enabling outflow formation. It is often speculated that enough plasma can penetrate the inner magnetosphere from the accretion flow through some rearrangement of magnetic field lines (e.g., interchange instability). However, the question arises whether such episodes of plasma intrusion can prevent the formation of spark gaps. To address this question we conducted a suite of numerical experiments, by means of radiative, 2D axisymmetric general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations, in which plasma is injected into specified regions at a prescribed rate. We find that when pair production is switched off, nearly complete screening is achieved when the plasma is injected within the outer light cylinder at a high enough rate. Injection beyond the outer light cylinder results in either, the formation of large vacuum gaps, or coherent, large-amplitude oscillations of the magnetosphere, depending on the injection rate. Within the allowed dynamic range of our simulations, we see no evidence for the system to approach a steady state as the injection rate is increased. Switching on pair production results in nearly complete screening of the entire magnetosphere in all cases, with some fraction of the maximum Blandford-Znajek power emitted as TeV gamma-rays.",
