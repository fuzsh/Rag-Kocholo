The sky is\n\nfalling! How often have we heard\n\nthese words from various Chicken\n\nLittles of all faiths and creeds? Not\n\noften enough, apparently, because\n\neven the Church of the Subgenius has\n\nnamed a date when all bets are off,\n\nand that time is drawing near: July\n\n5, 1998, 7:00 am. At that time,\n\naccording to Subgenius doctrine, the\n\nXists (beings from the Planet X) will\n\narrive and usher in a new dawn, an\n\nera ruled by the Epopts and Divine\n\nDrone-Men of J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs' unique\n\n\"religion\". Supposedly I'm one of\n\nthem.\n\nI became a Subgenius around ten\n\nyears ago by sending $25 to a postal\n\naddress in Dallas TX. I received in\n\nthe mail a very nice poster\n\nproclaiming that, as a FORE-MAN of\n\nthe church, I possess an Official,\n\nDivine All-Inclusive EXCUSE for\n\nanything I might do. Since then I\n\nhave strengthened my status in the\n\nchurch by buying cassette tapes,\n\npamphlets and the two definitive\n\n\"bibles\" of the organization, THE\n\nBOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS and REVELATION\n\nX, THE BOB APOCRYPHON (both published\n\nby Fireside Books and still in\n\nprint). As with most religions, the\n\nmore you donate, the holier you are.\n\nThe first time I saw the \"Grand\n\nExalted Mojo\" of the Subgenii, J.R.\n\n\"Bob\" Dobbs, was in the comics pages\n\nof the National Lampoon magazine.\n\nOld-timers may remember when this\n\npublication was funny, back in the\n\n70s, and featured a comic strip\n\ncalled \"The Applegates\", if I\n\nremember correctly. The strip was\n\nabout a typical All-American family\n\nof grinning cretins, headed by a\n\npipe-smoking, smiling patriarch, the\n\nguy on the right in the title picture\n\nfor this issue of LOADSTAR. I didn't\n\nunderstand what it was all about but\n\nthat father guy sure did mentally\n\ntorture the rest of his family!\n\nAs the 70s reeled into the 80s, I\n\nbegan seeing the creepy visage of\n\n\"Bob\" showing up in strange places,\n\nas graffiti on highway overpasses, on\n\nthe backs of envelopes from shady\n\norganizations. Perhaps you've seen\n\n\"Bob\" too, and wondered who the hell\n\nhe was?\n\nIt wasn't until I moved to\n\nShreveport back in 1987 that I found\n\nout that \"Bob\" is the figurehead of a\n\nreligion known as the Church of the\n\nSubgenius, and that its Mecca is\n\nDallas TX. Dallas! What kind of\n\nreligion would pick a hellish place\n\nlike Dallas as its Valhalla? Maybe my\n\nkind of religion?\n\nI wasn't really convinced about\n\nthe Subgenius until I passed some of\n\nits propaganda to Jeff Jones. He read\n\na few pages and stated that of all\n\nthe religions of the world, he\n\nadmired and respected them all --\n\nexcept the Subgenius. When I heard\n\nthat, I knew I had found my faith.\n\nThere's no way I can synopsize\n\nall of the contradictory teachings of\n\nthe Subgenius, except by quoting one\n\nof their more apt mottoes: \"We pull\n\nthe wool over our OWN eyes.\" I like\n\nthat. No one has ever been more\n\ndestructive to me than myself. If\n\nanyone is going to bilk me out of\n\nfortune and reason, I want it to be\n\nme.\n\nBut what really convinced me that\n\nthe teachings of \"Bob\" Dobbs were\n\nrelevant to my life was a 365.25 to 1\n\nshot -- X-Day, July 5, 1998, 7:00 am.\n\nOf all 365.25 days \"Bob\" could have\n\npicked, he chose my 51st birthday...\n\nalmost to the minute. Why July 5?\n\nAccording to REVELATION X, it has\n\nsomething to do with Independence\n\nDay. The Subgenius call July 4 a\n\nholiday for \"pinks\" (their pet name\n\nfor anyone who hasn't sent $25 to the\n\nchurch), and that all true Subgenii\n\nwait until the next day to have their\n\nfun. I know I do.\n\nI don't expect anyone to believe\n\na word that Ivan Stang and the other\n\nhigh-ranking Subgenii spew all over\n\ntheir literature. It's ridiculous and\n\nflies in the face of all we consider\n\nholy. But they did pick my\n\nbirthday... If anything weird does\n\nhappen on that date -- we've all been\n\ngiven plenty of warning -- I'll be as\n\nsurprised as anyone. My guess is that\n\nlife will go on, and 99.99999% of the\n\nearth's population will never know\n\nthat yet another apocalyptic\n\nprediction has crapped out. The\n\n.00001% who does (the Subgenius) is\n\nplanning a big \"devolution\"\n\n(Subgenius word for \"party\") in\n\nSherman NY on X-day. Here's a clip\n\nfrom an announcement they sent me:\n\n\"This is THE LAST SUBGENIUS EVENT --\n\nEVER! Can you feel it, children? That\n\nlow rumble coming from the ground,\n\nlike a billion-ton train rolling like\n\nthunder, gaining momentum, gaining\n\nspeed, getting closer and closer\n\nuntil BANG! the air splits, the Earth\n\nscreams, the seas boil and it's\n\nARMAGEDDON! Yes, kindred, X-Day's so\n\nclose you can almost hear the\n\nscreams, you can almost taste the\n\nsweet nectar of VENGEANCE!\"\n\nWow! Makes you almost wanna\n\nbelieve, doesn't it?\n\nThe good news is that LOADSTAR\n\n#169 is the last issue that will be\n\nworked on prior to X-Day, and after\n\nthat you probably won't be hearing\n\nany more Subgenius crapola from me.\n\nUnless the Xists really do show\n\nup...\n\n````````````````````````````````````\n\nThere's a couple of Commodore-\n\nsupporting companies that you ought\n\nto know about.\n\nTHE VINTAGE COMPUTER, 520\n\nSilverbrook Drive, El Cajon CA 92019,\n\n619-445-8432, vinta...@fda.net,\n\nwww.vintagecomputer.com\n\nCPU - The Commodore 128/64 Power\n\nUser newsletter, P.O. Box 1817,\n\nShelton WA 98584, com...@delphi.com\n\nTHE VINTAGE COMPUTER sells\n\nhardware and software and has a\n\n16-page catalog full of good, new and\n\nused software, and used hardware. The\n\nprices are very reasonable,\n\nespecially for the hardware. Remember\n\nthe prices I asked for the computers\n\nand drives I had a few month's back?\n\nTheir prices are better. 1541s are\n\n$25, C-64s are $35, 1571s are $40.\n\nThey even have a few 1581s for $90\n\nbut they won't last long. If you\n\ndon't get their catalog, you should.\n\nCPU, published by Tom Gosser, is\n\na newsletter that disappeared for\n\na while, but it's back. In Issue #4,\n\n1998, Tom tells the story how his\n\nmobile home office was broken into a\n\nyear ago and all the non-Commodore\n\nitems stolen. Unfortunately, the\n\nculprits decided to torch the place\n\nafterwards. Tom lost his 128s and\n\nsubscriber mailing list. But he was\n\nfinally able to salvage a disk with\n\nsubscriber addresses and now he's\n\nplanning to continue publishing\n\nquarterly. It's $15.00 a year for U.S\n\naddresses, $21 for Canada and Mexico,\n\nand $27 for overseas. Issue #4 had 14\n\npages of articles, reviews and a\n\ncouple of small type-ins, and 12\n\npages of advertisements.\n\n````````````````````````````````````\n\nLOADSTAR 128 subscribers who get\n\nit on a 1541 disk were probably\n\ndisappointed to find that many of the\n\ncopies we sent out had disk errors on\n\nthem. We sure were. Softdisk's Rimage\n\nMass Copier (a $100,000 machine in\n\nits day) finally bit the dust in an\n\nespecially cruel way, telling us the\n\ncopies were fine, when they weren't.\n\nLuckily we found out about it before\n\nwe sent out LS #167. Too bad we\n\ndidn't find out before we had copied\n\nabout 1400 disk sides with the bad\n\ncopier!\n\nSo now we copy Sides One and\n\nThree of the 1541 version on ALF mass\n\ncopiers (which are sometimes flaky,\n\nbut so far have been kind to us), and\n\nSides Two and Four on 1541-driven\n\nsystems in a room across the hall from\n\nthe magnificent 168-story LOADSTAR\n\nTower. I have four 128s, each with\n\ntwo 1541 drives, set up. I load\n\nFast Hack 'Em's 52-second-copier into\n\neach computer and we're able to copy\n\nabout four sides a minute.\n\nWe're still researching new ways\n\nto speed the process up, but for now\n\nwe can live with it. We can't use the\n\nALFs to copy the back sides of the\n\ndisks because the ALFs require that\n\nthere be an index hole on the side\n\nbeing copied. Our disk crisis of a\n\ncouple month's ago was a lack of\n\ndisks with [two] index holes.\n\nApparently the last company to make\n\nthese has dropped them from their\n\nline. So we now use disks with one\n\nindex hole, and have to use something\n\nother than the ALFs to copy the back\n\nsides.\n\nBut there's another problem:\n\nnotches. The disks we've been\n\nscrounging not only don't have an\n\nindex hole for the back; they don't\n\nhave a notch, either. Judi and I\n\ntried notching a few hundred disks\n\none afternoon, and although we now\n\nhave thumb muscles that are the envy\n\nof every pumped up dude at the\n\nLOADSTAR Tower Spa, it wasn't any\n\nfun. In fact, it was quite painful.\n\nSo I figured out how to wire a\n\n1541 so it ignores the write-protect\n\nsensor. Did I use the electronic\n\ntechniques I learned back in 1968 as\n\na technician for the Nike-Hercules\n\nMissile system? No. I called Doug\n\nCotton at CMD and he said he thought\n\nthat an 1800 ohm resistor across the\n\nsensor's leads would do it.\n\nI was only able to find 1500 ohm\n\nresistors at Radio Shack but I\n\nfigured they'd work -- and they did!\n\nYou may never have any reason for\n\ndefeating the write-protect system in\n\nyour 1541s, but if you do, it's easy.\n\nTake off the cover and metal heat\n\nshield. Then find a big white\n\nconnector on the left side of the\n\ndrive (as you're facing the front)\n\nthat has several sets of wires going\n\ninto the top of it. You don't have to\n\ndisconnect the connector; just leave\n\nit as it is.\n\nIf you number the holes in the\n\ntop of the connector from front to\n\nback, find the two wires that go into\n\nholes 3 and 4. In most drives these\n\nwere orange and green, but I found at\n\nleast one drive where they were\n\norange and purple. All you have to do\n\nis bend the leads of the resistor and\n\nclip them off about a quarter inch\n\nfrom the resistor, like this:\n\n````````\n\n`resistor`\n\n} ```````` }\n\n```` ````\n\n} }\n\nThen simply poke the two ends of the\n\nleads into the connector holes where\n\nthe orange and green (or purple)\n\nwires go, making sure that the leads\n\ntouch the small metal \"sleeve\" around\n\neach wire. No soldering! The holes\n\nare just the right size to hold the\n\nresistor in place. Bend the resistor\n\nflat so that it doesn't touch the\n\nmetal shield when you put the drive\n\nback together.\n\nIt works. You can write to the\n\ndisk even if there's no notch. That\n\ntrick saved Judi and me a lot of time\n\nand pain.\n\nThanks, Doug!\n\n````````````````````````````````````\n\nMany years ago when I was the\n\nbrash young editor of a thriving disk\n\nmagazine, I opined that the best way\n\nto become an \"expert\" was to pick a\n\nfield so narrow that you only had to\n\nkick two or three butts in order to\n\nbecome #1. Of course I never expected\n\nanyone to pay any attention to my\n\nadvice.\n\nBut Maurice Jones called my bluff\n\nand decided to become the world's\n\ngreatest solitaire game programmer\n\nfor 8-bit computers. He concentrated\n\nhis energies on developing a\n\nsolitaire game \"shell\" that would\n\nmake succeeding games easier to\n\nproduce. Sure enough, within a couple\n\nof years he was putting out a game a\n\nmonth. As his shell got more\n\npowerful, and his familiarity with\n\nevery single line in it grew, he was\n\nable to do two or more games a month.\n\nNow he can do a game every couple of\n\ndays and has had months where he\n\nproduced six or more.\n\nI'd say that makes Maurice an\n\nexpert, by anyone's definition. Not\n\nonly has he just about exhausted the\n\nbook that lists the rules for most\n\nknown solitaire games, he's been\n\ncoming up with highly original ROTATO\n\n(rhymes with \"potato\") games lately.\n\nROTATO games, a concept that Maurice\n\nand I claim to have invented, are\n\ncard solitaire games for computer,\n\nwith rules that make the game\n\npractically impossible to play with\n\nreal cards. They involve card\n\nmovements that are easy to do on\n\ncomputer, but way too much trouble to\n\ndo with cards.\n\nBy the time you read this,\n\nMaurice will have had his 72nd\n\nbirthday, had his 57th card game\n\npublished and will have written his\n\n90th or so program. To commemorate\n\nthis auspicious occasion, we have\n\ncome up with another compilation of\n\neight of Maurice's previously\n\nunpublished programs, called\n\nMAURICE'S EIGHT-MORE. It's a $12\n\nproduct, just like his last\n\ncompilation, MAURICE'S EIGHT-PACK,\n\nand contains these solitaires:\n\nSEVEN UP\n\nBLOCK TEN\n\nDEUCES\n\nALHAMBRA\n\nGARGANTUA\n\nCONGRESS\n\nROUGE ET NOIR\n\nWILL O' THE WISP\n\nIn an average day you will meet\n\npeople who call themselves \"experts\",\n\nand charge you accordingly for their\n\nexpertise, but here's a chance to\n\nenjoy the works of a true expert, and\n\nat the same time purchase for a\n\npaltry $12 a part of what will\n\neventually be considered the greatest\n\ncollection of solitaire card games\n\never written for computer, THE WORKS\n\nOF MAURICE JONES.\n\nTo order, call 1-800-594-3370 and\n\naks for MAURICE'S EIGHT-MORE, item\n\nnumber #0061D5 (1541 version) or\n\n#0061D3 (1581 version).\n\nFILE:\"t.soapbox 168\"\n\nT H I S I S A T R U E S T O R Y\n\nThe Names Were Changed\n\nTo Protect The Doofus\n\nby Jeff \"Jacko\" Jones\n\nI first met Chang through the\n\nmail. He was a promising young\n\nprogrammer from a foreign country.\n\nThe code he sent my small software\n\ncompany was good and tight. We liked\n\nhim. We began a long and intimate\n\ntele-relationship through Ma Bell.\n\nChang was a bright young go-getter,\n\nthe kind of bright young spirit that\n\nmade me want to check my throat for a\n\npulse. Sure, as a veteran programmer,\n\nI was intimidated by his bright ideas\n\nand youthful energy. I felt he was\n\nsmarter than I was, that his code was\n\nmore well planned and implemented.\n\nHis problem-solving skills were\n\nclearly ahead of mine. In short,\n\nChang was a better programmer -- plus\n\nthe dames liked him. By the time he\n\nwas my age, he would be twice the\n\nprogrammer I was.\n\nThen one day I got the call,\n\n\"Jacko, I got the FD-2000 you sent\n\nme. I don't like it. I'm going to\n\nreturn it.\"\n\nThis was incredible to me because\n\nI knew he needed the FD unit. \"But,\n\nChang, you told me that your 1571 was\n\nfailing. What are you going to use?\"\n\n\"Well, my 1571 is only a little\n\nflakey. I mean I only have to turn it\n\noff and on for years to make sure a\n\nsave works and I have a hard time\n\nformatting disks. It's not that\n\nbad.\"\n\n\"Chang! I can't believe I'm\n\nhearing this! What's wrong with the\n\nFD-2000?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Well the activity light is too\n\ndim.\"\n\n\"Huh?!?\"\n\n\"The [activity light] -- it's too\n\n[dim].\"\n\n\"What? You can't see it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can see it. It's just\n\ndimmer than that big wide green 1571\n\nLED.\"\n\nI snorted, \"Then turn off the\n\nlights while you save!\"\n\n\"Nice try, Jacko, but the light's\n\njust too dim.\"\n\n\"It can't be just that! Is it\n\nslower than you thought?\"\n\n\"No. In fact, it's noticeably\n\nfaster than the 1571, even with that\n\nJiffyDOS chip you sent me.\"\n\n\"So what is it really? You've had\n\nit for a week now.\"\n\n\"I just don't trust it.\"\n\n\"Have you ever lost data with\n\nit?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you lost data on your\n\n1571?\"\n\n\"Yes, many, many times.\"\n\n\"Yet you'd rather use an old 1571\n\nhalf-dead that you have to beg to\n\nassemble your code than a brand new\n\nFD-2000?\"\n\n\"Call me an old stick in the mud,\n\nbut I can't get used to the drive.\n\nIt's too quiet. I've already got it\n\nboxed up.\"\n\n\"I can't believe this, Chang.\n\nYou're saying the drive is too quiet\n\nnow? These don't sound like\n\nlegitimate complaints.\"\n\n\"They aren't. I just don't know\n\nthe drive. What if I get a directory\n\nerror? I don't even know how to fix\n\nthem on an FD-2000.\"\n\n\"Hah! You'll probably never see a\n\ndirectory error [again]! I used to\n\nsee directory errors all the time,\n\nbut not anymore. Not since I've been\n\nusing CMD drives. I haven't seen a\n\ndirectory error literally in [years]!\n\nNot only that: no 'drive not ready\n\nerrors'. Not unless the disk isn't\n\ninserted or the the disk isn't\n\nformatted.\"\n\n\"I just don't trust it!\"\n\n\"Take it from me. I've been using\n\none for about five years now. They\n\nare better made than CBM drives.\n\nBetter shielded, too. My FD-2000 runs\n\nfine sitting on top of my hard drive.\n\nMy 1581 had to be a foot away from it\n\nto work.\"\n\n\"And what would happen of you had\n\nan error on your hard drive? You'd\n\nlose everything. How do you get a\n\ndirectory back on a monster like\n\nthat?\"\n\n\"Chang, calm down. It's simple.\n\nCMD directories are identical to CBM\n\ndirectories. They just start on a\n\ndifferent track. Plus I've already\n\nlost data on my hard drive and --\"\n\n\"I thought you said these drives\n\nwere ultra-reliable!\"\n\n\"Ahem! Let me finish. I've\n\nalready lost data on my hard drive\n\nwhen I was working on two programs\n\nthat altered directories. Namely\n\nDirectomeister and Hannibal Sector.\n\nThe fault was totally my own. But\n\ngetting the data back was no\n\ndifferent than getting data back on a\n\n1571. I just got it back faster.\"\n\n\"I don't know! I know this sounds\n\nstupid. It makes no sense, but I'm\n\njust [scared] of this drive. I've\n\nprogrammed one way for years and now\n\n--\"\n\n\"Chang, do me a favor. Just plug\n\nthe drive back up and use it for\n\nanother week. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"Do it because if you don't\n\nyou're going to make a huge\n\nmistake.\"\n\nI lost track of Chang for about a\n\nmonth and then on a lark, I called\n\nhim. I was surprised to hear that his\n\nvoice had changed. Somehow it was\n\ndeeper, richer. Somehow he seemed\n\nmore sure of himself. In the\n\nbackground, I could hear a\n\nsemiconscious woman moaning his name.\n\nObviously I had called at a bad\n\ntime.\n\n\"Yo.\" It was Chang's customary\n\nsalutation.\n\n\"It's me, Jacko. I hope I haven't\n\ncalled at a bad time.\"\n\n\"Jacko! Glad you called! That FD-\n\n2000 is the best thing since sliced\n\nbread! Love it! Love it! I got a\n\nsecond one and mounted it on the hood\n\nof my car. What a babe magnet it\n\nis!\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"Glad I listened to you. I was\n\nbeing a real doofus.\"\n\n\"I'm always glad to be reminded\n\nwhen I'm right, Chang. Please, don't\n\nstop!\" I chuckled.\n\nThen I heard my own words\n\nrepeated by Chang's new dame: \"Chang,\n\nplease don't stop. Get off the\n\nphone.\"\n\n\"Jacko...\"\n\n\"I know, Chang. You have to go.\"\n\n\"I'll be checking into those hard\n\ndrives and RAMLinks next month. With\n\nnames like those, they can only\n\nimprove my love life.\"\n\nClick.\n\nThe young bastard! If I were ten\n\nyears younger, I knew what I'd do\n\nwith a good hard drive. But that's\n\nanother story. I was glad for him\n\nthough. He waded through his fear of\n\nthe new and unknown into a new vista\n\nof speed and reliability. Not only\n\nthat, he got the girl. As I strained\n\nmy way up the stairs to my office and\n\nopened my checkbook, I wondered if I\n\nshould should have warned him about\n\nalimony.\n\nFILE:\"t.forum 168\"\n\nL O A D S T A R F O R U M\n\nCompiled by Fender Tucker\n\nDear LOADSTAR,\n\nWhere are the Op Ed cartoons? I\n\nlike them and look forward to seeing\n\nmore! Very funny! P.S. Is Jeff Jones\n\nan official spokesperson for the\n\nClinton Admin? Did Jeff give\n\nabsolution to Clinton like Billy\n\nGraham did?\n\ner...@ptw.com\n\n[FT:] I haven't received any op ed\n\ncartoons lately, but check out the\n\nTOON CONTEST which starts with this\n\nissue. It's as funny as you can make\n\nit. I must admit that I may have\n\nalienated one of our best op ed\n\ncartoonists. He'd call me up whenever\n\nwe published any of his cartoons and\n\nbecause I couldn't remember what he\n\nexpected as payment or what we had\n\ntalked about the last time he called,\n\nhe'd get mad. I don't think he ever\n\nunderstood that I immediately forget\n\neverything I say on the phone once I\n\nhang up. It's the only way to stay\n\nsane in this type of job.\n\nAs for Jeff Jones, Bill Clinton and\n\nBilly Graham...I'm sorry, there's no\n\ndiplomatic way to end that sentence.\n\nHello Fender!\n\nI hope you are okay! I found\n\nLOADSTAR on the Internet and read\n\nabout CHARTSTAR: \"The most\n\nfull-featured chart-making program\n\never published.\"\n\nTo read this is like candy for my\n\neyes. The first thing I will do\n\ntomorrow is show it to my friends at\n\nwork. We have all recently been\n\nconnected to the internet at work. I\n\nbought a digital camera last\n\nChristmas, and it is great fun and a\n\nvery practical way of using the\n\ninternet, communicating with friends\n\nall over. I can't remember ever having\n\nsuch a fun \"boy's-toy\". I am\n\nterrorizing all my friends and\n\npatients with it.\n\nPeter Marions\n\nmar...@swed.com\n\n[FT:] Good to hear from you, Peter.\n\nI'm flattered you found us on the\n\nnet.\n\nPeter Marions was one of the best\n\n128 programmers around in the early\n\ndays of LOADSTAR 128 and I think his\n\nCHART 128 and PAINT 128 were two of\n\nthe best 128 programs ever. CHARTSTAR\n\n(on LS #62) is the 64 version of\n\nCHART 128. He never did anything\n\nhalfway and I imagine he is still as\n\nsuccessful as he was back then.\n\nExcept for maybe having a bunch of\n\nterrorized patients...\n\nDear Administrator,\n\nEvery time I have many problems\n\nwhen I want to do my home work or\n\nanything serious to write because I\n\nhaven't an ordinator. This trouble\n\nbothering me so much, I am Swirling.\n\nI think about a lap-top. Please\n\nhelp me to resolve this problem.\n\nTrusting I shall hear from you\n\nwithout delay, I am, Sir, yours\n\ntruly.\n\nAmise Ulysse\n\n154 Route des Dalles\n\nPort-au-Prince, Haiti\n\nLa Belle Etoile\n\n[FT:] Well, obviously you do need an\n\nordinator, but I don't think a lap-top\n\nis the answer. Any advice from the\n\nLOADSTARites out there?\n\nDear Fender,\n\nI received your disk with your\n\nversion of my Compleat LOADSTAR Music\n\nList. I realize that you had to do a\n\nlot of shaving to get my listings\n\ndown to a size suitable for LOADSTAR,\n\nbut it's too bad the descriptions of\n\nthe songs had to go -- especially\n\nthose that told which songs were\n\nbackground music and which were parts\n\nof jukeboxes.\n\nI have been updating my list with\n\nevery issue and will continue to do\n\nso. If your readers would want my\n\nmuch larger files (which describe the\n\nsongs and players more fully), have\n\nthem write me and I will send them my\n\ndetailed list on disk.\n\nToo bad you still couldn't\n\nidentify the songs on LS #27 and #28.\n\nI believe it was Jim Weiler who\n\ntranscribed them. I sure would like\n\nto know what program was used to\n\nenter those pieces.\n\nKenneth Barsky\n\n100-28 Benchley Place\n\nNew York NY 10475\n\n[FT:] Kenneth's lists are on this\n\nissue on Side Four. He's right about\n\nhis lists being much more detailed\n\nthan what we published. I felt that I\n\ncouldn't devote more than 300 blocks\n\nto the lists so I pared them down.\n\nIt's nice of Kenneth to offer the\n\nlists to anyone. Be nice to him if\n\nask for his lists.\n\nJim W. said that the songmaker they\n\nused in those days was written by Joe\n\nGarrett and Alan Gardner, and was the\n\nprecursor to SongSmith. There are\n\nprobably programming wizards who\n\ncould reverse-engineer the song codes\n\nand re-write the songmaker but\n\nthere's little chance of anyone\n\nwanting to. Sorry.\n\nHiya Fender!\n\nI am looking forward to seeing\n\nthe presenter for the FLAGS & ANTHEMS\n\ncollection. I have an HD disk all\n\nready for the compleat series.\n\nAlso, a while back you published\n\nSTAR LOADER. You said in the docs\n\nthat it could be written to use\n\nRAMLink partitions, though you hadn't\n\ngotten around to finishing the code.\n\nHow about it, Fender? Such a program\n\nwould make the RAMLink easier to use.\n\nWhenever I find C= users I give them\n\ndisks with STAR LOADER as a menu,\n\nalong with whatever old Fastload\n\ncartridge I may have on hand. I would\n\nlike to see STAR LOADER finished and\n\nin my RAMLink.\n\nBill Wells\n\nPetersburg VA\n\n[FT:] Ask and ye shall believe. On\n\nSide Four of this issue is THE\n\nCOMPLEAT FLAGS & ANTHEMS presenter.\n\nYou won't need an HD disk, though;\n\njust a regular 1581-format disk is\n\nplenty big enough for the files, once\n\nthey've been converted to \"c.\" files\n\nby \"b.countrifier\" (also on this\n\nissue).\n\nJeff's got his new, improved STAR\n\nLOADER just about ready to go and it\n\nwill appear on LS #169 as SUPER BOOT.\n\nI think it will do everything you\n\never wanted a program to do on your\n\nRAMLink.\n\nDear LOADSTAR,\n\nWhat is the complete ADSR\n\nenvelope used for the trumpet in\n\nTrumpeter's Lullaby in ANDERSON\n\nJUKEBOX II on LS #167?\n\nJack Barnes\n\nDallas TX\n\n[FT:] As Grand Exalted Mojo of\n\nLOADSTAR I'm supposed to know\n\neverything about everything we\n\npublish, especially the ADSR\n\nenvelopes for all the songs. So I\n\nbooted up SID EDITOR and loaded\n\n\"trumplullaby.mus\" from LS #167. Then\n\nI played the song and noticed that\n\nVoice 1 was doing most of the\n\n\"trumpet\" soloing. So while the song\n\nwas playing I pressed F1 a couple of\n\ntimes to go to a screen where all of\n\nthe parameters for all three voices\n\nare displayed -- in real time. Nifty!\n\nIt looks like the ADSR envelope for\n\nVoice 1 is:\n\nAttack = 5\n\nDecay = 0\n\nSustain = 15\n\nRelease = 0\n\nHowever, it changes as the song goes\n\non, so you would probably glean more\n\nabout how Dave Marquis does his thing\n\nby booting up SID EDITOR yourself and\n\nstudying the parameters. As far as I\n\nknow, SID EDITOR (with manual) is\n\navailable from Parsec, P.O. Box 111,\n\nSalem MA 01970-0111. Tell John Brown\n\nthat LOADSTAR sent ya'.\n\nDear LOADSTAR,\n\nI want to answer the question you\n\nhad in LS #167 ULTRAGEMS about why\n\nthis syntax doesn't work:\n\nload\"file\",peek(186)"
