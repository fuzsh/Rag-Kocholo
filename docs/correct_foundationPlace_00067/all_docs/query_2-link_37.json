        "text": "Boy genius Ken Silverman, eighteen years old, working on the Build engine in 1994.\n\nKen Silverman was a programming prodigy, starting his journey on a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A in 1983 at the tender age of eight. By the time he finished high school he had created Ken’s Labyrinth, a Wolfenstein 3D clone with a lighthearted funhouse theme he managed to publish through a young company called Epic Megagames.\n\nApogee Software took notice and offered Silverman, barely eighteen at this point, a contract to develop a new 3D engine for them. He had already done some work on an improved version of the Ken’s Labyrinth engine with angled walls and lighting effects, while John Carmack was doing the same for his Doom engine down in Texas. This is not to say the two were rivals; on the contrary, they talked on the phone from time to time and inspired each other’s work. For example, Silverman took the idea of sector-based levels from Carmack and found it let him get around the limitations of the grid-based paradigm he had been working with.\n\nOver the next eighteen months or so, with Ken mostly working remotely from his parent’s home in Rhode Island with occasional trips down to the newly formed 3D Realms’ offices in Texas, the BUILD engine developed into a very capable and feature-rich 3D engine. It supported sloped floors, fake room-over-room, decals sprites on walls and floors, moving sectors for effects like vehicles and swinging doors, and many other interesting features.\n\nOverall, the tech never felt quite as fundamentally solid as Doom or Quake, and its 2.5D nature made it an evolutionary dead-end by the time Duke Nukem 3D was released in 1996. But in the hands of 3D Realms’s designers BUILD enabled the quirky, colorful, richly interactive game worlds of Duke3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood — three superb shooters that brought a sense of fun to a genre that was then practically dominated by the sparsely designed, monolithic Quake.\n\nSilverman continued to do great programming work post-BUILD, as evidenced by his awesome vintage-styled homepage — a treasure trove of old-school 3D programming wizardry. Yet he never grew into a game technology luminary like Carmack or Tim Sweeney. Here is Carmack in an interview from 1997, asked who he would hire if he could pick anyone from the 3D tech field:\n\n“If I had to pick who I think is just the most talented, it would probably be Ken Silverman, the guy that did the BUILD engine. […] He writes all the code for everything, and he’s just extremely talented. I think it was one of 3D Realms’ worst decisions not to coddle him, or whatever it took, to keep him on board. I think if he was still working directly for 3D Realms, they would have a Quake-type game shipped by now, just because he’s extraordinarily good.”\n\nIt’s hard to talk about the history of 3D game engines without mentioning John Carmack, and deservedly so. But let’s not forget that teenage boy sitting at his 13\" CRT monitor somewhere in Rhode Island over twenty years ago.\n\nA playthrough of the Half-Life 0.52 alpha, a prerelease build of the game from September 1997 that was leaked to the public in 2013.\n\nIt’s remarkable how much of the gameplay and environmental sophistication that would make the game such a landmark title are already present here, even as the engine still carries a lot of flavor from the Quake technology it was based on.\n\nA lot of the content here would end up in the release version, but some of it was discarded completely. In terms of level design I particularly like the underground sections with Marine combat around the 20 minute mark. And how strangely retro to see the sub-machinegun implemented as a projectile weapon.\n\nValve’s development process for the original Half-Life deserves a lengthy post of its own. In the meantime, an ISO of the alpha CD-ROM is available on ModDB.\n\nThe id Tech 3 engine was developed between 1997 and 1999, before the age of programmable vertex and pixel shaders – yet it allows surface and geometry effects that range from pretty neat to downright impressive for the time. The secret behind these is the engine’s own version of shaders, based on standard OpenGL features available in GPU’s as early as 1996.\n\nid Tech 3’s shader system is based on the basic common feature set of GPU’s at the time, relying on clever combinations of multitexturing, blending stages, cubemaps, animated UV transformations and vertex animation on the CPU to produce a wide range of effects. These are captures from Quake 3 Arena, but later games like Heavy Metal: FAKK 2, Elite Force and American McGee’s Alice made great use of the tech as well.\n\nSurface parameters are defined in a simple text format, effectively providing a declarative scripting language for OpenGL’s fixed function rendering pipeline. id even published a pretty comprehensive manual for shader authors, one of the rare times it made internal technical documentation public to the mod community.\n\nThe shader system was made possible only by a clear choice on id’s part to require dedicated 3D hardware that had barely just become mainstream at the time. It made Quake 3 one the most visually interesting and vibrant first-person shooters of all time, and helped establish id Tech 3 as the go-to technology for many great-looking games well into the 2000’s."
