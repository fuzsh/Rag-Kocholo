Our plans to visit Turkey in June 2000 were nearing com-

pletion when Dr. N. Brent Kennedy, Vice Chancellor of the

University of Virginia's College at Wise [UVA/Wise], in-

formed us that our trip was being delayed until mid-July.

Dr. Kennedy had received a telephone call from the New

York representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern

Cyprus [TRNC], inviting our group to attend the annual

celebration of the Peace and Freedom Operation in North-

ern Cyprus. The event honors Turkey for its military in-

tervention on July 20, 1974, that halted an attempted

genocide of the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriots.

In addition to Dr. Kennedy, five members of the faculty

of the UVA/Wise were in the travel party. Others in the

group were: Ms. Connie Clark, President of the Melungeon

Heritage Association; Mr. and Mrs. Wayne Winkler, he be-

ing Director of National Public Radio Station WETS-FM at

East Tennessee State University; and my wife Betty Brant-

ley Goyne and myself.

Our group assembled at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Friday,

July 14, 2000. We departed Chicago about 5 PM, and had

an overnight flight to Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. A

tour guide provided by the TRNC met us on arrival. She

had been retained to show us parts of Istanbul, take us

to lunch, and to otherwise keep us occupied for about

eight hours until boarding our flight to Cyprus.

We flew from Istanbul to Ercan Airport at Lefkosa [Nico-

sia], Cyprus, arriving a little after midnight on Sunday

morning. An attractive young lady greeted us, and escort-

ed us to the airport VIP Lounge. During our walk across

the tarmac, it became apparent that our escort was some-

one of importance in the government. One in our group

said to our escort: "I bet I can guess who you work for.

You work for the Prime Minister." Devrim Altiok respond-

ed: "Close, but not quite." We learned later that Devrim

was Third Secretary in the Foreign Ministry.

From Ercan airport, we were driven to the beautiful Olive

Tree Resort Hotel near Girne [Krynia], arriving at about

3 AM. When we finally settled into our beds, we had been

"out of bed" for about 40 hours.

Most of Sunday was spent recovering from jet lag. We re-

laxed around the hotel swimming pool, and talked with

some of the other delegates. That evening Devrim Altiok

escorted us to dinner at the Park Hotel near Gazimagusa

[Famagusta]. After a delightful dinner on the hotel pa-

tio, we attended a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet of

Belarus in the Roman Amphitheater in the ancient city of

Salamis. It was a brilliant performance, with beautiful

costumes, in a magnificent setting.

Monday morning we visited with His Excellency, Mr. Musta-

fa Akinci, Minister of State, and Deputy Prime Minister.

Previously, Mr. Akinci had been mayor of the Turkish part

of Lefkosa [Nicosia] for 14 years. Following our meeting,

Mr. Akinci hosted us for lunch in the 8th floor dining

room of a mid-city hotel. The panoramic view gave us a

good view of the entire city, including Ledra Palace, UN

Headquarters for Cyprus. That evening we had dinner at a

seaside restaurant near the ruins of Soli. From that lo-

cation we could see the Taurus Mountains of Turkey.

Tuesday morning we visited with His Excellency, Mr. Tah-

sin Ertugruloglu, Minister of Foreign Affairs and De-

fence. The Minister is a graduate of the University of

Arizona, and is very fond of the United States. Next, we

visited with His Excellency, President Rauf Dinktas.

President Dinktas had just returned from Geneva, where he

had been engaged in proximity talks with his Greek Cypri-

ot counterpart. We had very informative meetings with all

three of these senior members of the TRNC government.

After our meeting with President Dinktas, we had lunch at

the Dome Hotel in Girne [Kyrenia]. As we were having des-

ert, an assistant manager came to our table and extended

an invitation for us to have coffee with the General Man-

ager. We were escorted to Mr. Mete Hatay's office, where

he greeted us with a big smile. Mr. Hatay said: "Dr. Ken-

nedy, I have been wanting to meet you. I know about the

Melungeons. I have read your book." He then showed us his

copy of Dr. Kennedy's book published in the Turkish lan-

guage.

Mr. Hatay said that he had a story to tell us. He said in

the mountains east of Girne was a village named Melun Dag,

meaning Damned or Cursed Mountain. He informed us that a

man on his hotel staff was from that village. Mr. Hatay

then told the assistant manager to bring the man to his

office. Presently, a man dressed in chef's clothing en-

tered the office. Mr. Hatay asked the man to tell us of

the history of his village. The man proceeded to relate

the story in the Turkish language, with Mr. Hatay trans-

lating. He said long ago his ancestors were living on

the north coast of Cyprus, when sea-raiders attacked

them. The people fled into the mountains. They named the

mountain where they took refuge Melun Dag. Eventually the

people settled at the base of the mountain, and built a

new village. They named the village Melun Dag. Since that

day, the people of Melun Dag have referred to their an-

cestors as Melun Cans, meaning Damned or Cursed Souls.

[The Turkish word 'can' is pronounced 'jan.'] All three

words: melun, dag and can, are listed in current English-

Turkish Dictionaries, and have the meanings I have stated.

Wednesday morning we got an early start for Melun Dag.

The people of the village had been informed of our visit,

and received us warmly. They placed chairs on the shaded

porch of the village mosque, where they seated us. They

served us cold drinks and sweets. Dr. Kennedy explained

the purpose of our visit, and asked for volunteers to

give hair samples for a DNA project. The two oldest men

in the village came forward, as did other adults. After a

few giggles, and saying "you first," some of the children

got in line. The hair samples, with roots intact, were

placed in numbered plastic bags and returned to the USA

with us. The results of this test will become part of an

ongoing DNA study.

As is apparent from the foregoing, Cyprus, or the Turkic

world in general, is certainly a candidate for being the

source of the term Melungeon.

For several years we have researched the story of Piri

Reis, his maps, and his book "Kitab-l Bahriye." This led

us to the story of the "Book of Shah Iskender." The fol-

lowing poem from "Kitab-l Bahriye" is translated from the

Turkish language:

"Those sailors read, write and know about

The whole sea science

But they never share this knowledge

With anybody other than themselves.

Let me tell you why:

Once upon a time, Shah Iskender

Had traveled all over the seas,

What ever he had heard or seen

He had them written.

Therefore, all the world is

In that book of his.

The book is in Egypt

Kept in secret

Since Iskender.

They escaped with that book,

Traveled with its knowledge,

Translated it,

Let me tell you who translated it:

He was called Portolmiye."

This poem, written in the late 1400s or early 1500s,

tells of a world traveler who, in antiquity, wrote a book

and drew maps. That person was Shah Iskender, which is

the Turkish name for Alexander the Great. Alexander's

book of the world was recovered from the ruins of the Li-

brary of Alexandria, Egypt, and preserved in Egypt for

many years. At some point, Piri Reis obtained a copy of

the "Book of Iskender," and included parts of it in his

book "Kitab-l Bahriye." "Kitab-l Bahriye refers to elev-

en geographic features on the west coast of Africa having

Turkish names. The Piri Reis map, presented to the Turk-

ish Sultan in 1513, shows islands in the south Atlantic,

and parts of Antarctica, that had not been discovered in

1513. There is other evidence of a Mediterranean people

visiting the 'New World' long before Columbus' first voy-

age. Certainly, much research remains to be done to de-

termine the origin of the term Melungeon. Insallah, we

will continue with our research.

The information on Piri Reis and Shah Iskender comes to

us from the Ottoman Archives, the Turkish Naval Archives,

and the Turkic World Research Foundation. It was trans-

lated from the Turkish language by Aslihan Arul who lives

in Istanbul.

CALEB EMERY GOWEN AND FAMILY WERE "FREQUENT FLYERS"

THRU PORT OF NEW YORK A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

Caleb Emery Gowen was a descendant of William Alexander

Gowen who was deported by Oliver Cromwell and who ar-

rived in New England in 1651. He inherited his wander-

lust.

Caleb Emery Gowen, with his son, Albert Younglove Gowen,

would have been the winners of any "frequent flyer" pres-

entations awarded to passengers moving through Ellis Is-

land and the Port of New York a century ago. They and

their families were recorded 22 times among the 101 Gowen

individuals who made a transit between 1892 and 1924, ac-

cording to the records of American Family Immigration

History Center.

Caleb Emery Gowen was a namesake of Caleb Emery who was

born in York County, Maine October 17, 1710. He was a

son of Daniel Emery and Margaret Gowen Emery, daughter of

William Alexander Gowen, who were married March 17, 1695

at Kittery, Maine.

Caleb Emery Gowen was enrolled in Harvard University from

1874 to 1878, receiving his A. B. Degree in 1878. In 1910

he was a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, living on Magnolia

Drive. He was engaged in "manufacturing and transporta-

tion" according to the alumni directory. From 1893 to

1910 he was recorded 11 times in the records of Ellis Is-

land. His wife and children frequently accompanied him.

They made crossings, mostly to English ports in 1893,

1894, 1896, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1909, 1910, 1914, 1920 and

1922.

Children born to Caleb Emery Gowen include:

Albert Younglove Gowen born about 1884

Margaret H. Gowen born about 1887

Harriett Gowen born about 1892

Albert Younglove Gowen, son of Caleb Emery Gowen, was

born about 1884. He was listed in the Harvard Alumni

Directory as a student at Harvard University from 1903

through 1905. In 1910 and in 1917 he was listed in "man-

ufacturing" with home address as 11120 Magnolia Drive,

Cleveland.

Albert Younglove Gowen was recorded four times from 1906

to 1923 in the records of Ellis Island , and then he

bought his own yacht.

In 1917 he was registered as the owner of a wooden motor

yacht, "Sweetheart," according to Lloyds of London. It

was built as Hull No. 796 in 1913 at Lawley Shipbuilders

of Quincy, Massachusetts. At the same time, an 18-foot

yacht tender, Hull No. 1252, named "Adelia" was built to

be carried on the "Sweetheart."

Albert Younglove Gowen was recorded as a member of the

Cleveland Yacht Club, and the vessel showed Chicago as

its home port. He changed the name of the yacht to "Spee-

jacks." In 1922, he sailed the vessel around the world

and became the first to circumnavigate the globe in a mo-

tor-driven yacht, according to "Guiness Book of Records."

Jeanne Couchet Gowen extracted information from the log

of the Speejacks on a voyage from New York to Australia.

Dale Collins used the data to write "Sea Tracks of the

Speejacks" which was published in 1923.

Brian Cartwright of Toronto, Ontario, Canada contacted

Gowen Research Foundation October 10, 1999 to report that

he had purchased the "Adelia" in 1985. He wrote:

"I took "Adelia" back to Boston [the Lawley boatyard

was in Quincy, south of Boston] last summer for the

Lawley Boatowners Rendezvous & Boston Antique Boat

Show. This was her first return visit since it was

built, over 85 years ago. Not only did I then find

out from Albert Hickey, LBOA Executive Director and

Burt Hasselbalch, curator, Hart Nautical Collection,

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when "Adelia"

was built, but for whom and for what yacht.

Ideally, and perhaps, idealistically, I am very cur-

ious to know if the motoryacht for which it was

built, has survived two world wars and over nine

decades of use, to this present day. My fingers are

crossed. I look forward to any background informa-

tion and any insights you may be able to provide on

Albert Younglove Gowen. I would be interested to

know how he came about such good fortune to have

such fine yacht/boat commissioned."

Children born to Albert Younglove Gowen include:

Albert Younglove "Jaxie" Gowen, Jr. born about 1939

Albert Youngblood "Jacksie" Gowen, Jr, son of Albert

Younglove Gowen, was born about 1944 in Cleveland.

In 1993, he was living in Geneva, Switzerland where he

was the executive vice-president of Coutts & Company, an

investment banking arm of the National Wesminster Bank

Group of London. His office was located at 13 Quai de

l'Ile, 1211 Geneva [11].

In 1999 Albert Younglove "Jaxie" Gowen, Jr, was vice

chairman of Sarasin Geneva, part of Bank Sarasin, a

Swiss private bank. He was interviewed by a reporter of

the "International Herald-Tribune" of Paris, France who

was writing a news story which was published October 18,

1999.

After more than four years of work, millions of volunteer

hours and almost $25 million, the American Family Immi-

gration History Center opened its doors to the American

people. This center, housed in the Ellis Island Immigra-

tion Museum along with a companion Website provides easy

access to ships' passenger manifest records of more than

22 million immigrants who entered through the Port of New

York and Ellis Island from 1892 to 1924. While these rec-

ords have been available on microfilm for years through

the National Archives, this is the first time they are

available via an electronic database.

The millions of records available both through kiosks at

Ellis Island and via the Internet will provide the fol-

lowing types of information about the immigrants:

Immigrant's given name

Immigrant's surname

Gender

Age at arrival

Ethnicity/Nationality

Marital status

Last residence (town & country)

Date of arrival

Ship of travel

Port of origin

Current microfilm records at the National Archives cover

immigration through the Port of New York from 1820 to

1957. While the American Family Immigration History Cen-

ter's database currently includes only the records from

1892-1924, the peak years, they plan to continue adding

records until all Ellis Island records are available

electronically. Records of immigrants through other U.S.

ports will be added to database subsequently.

One hundred one members of the Gowen family made an en-

trance into the United States through the Port of New

York and Ellis Island in the 32 years between 1892 and

1924. They were among the 22 million immigrants, pass-

engers and crew members who made a transit through the

port facility, according to the website of the American

Family Immigration Center.

The Website is accessed at:

http://www.ellisislandrecords.org

The free electonic database has been overwhelmed by fam-

ily researchers since its announcement. The site quickly

became one of the 50 busiest in the United States with

1.9 hits during the month of April. Included in the rec-

ords were:

THEORIES STILL ABOUND FOR ORIGINAL MELUNGEON ETHNICITY:

AND THEORIES THEY ALL ARE

By Evelyn McKinley Orr

Editorial Boardmember

8310 Emmet Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68134

402/571-3422[email protected]

I was chair for Gowen Research Foundation's Melungeon Re-

research Team from organization in December 1989 until

1997. I dedicated many hours to the Foundation's goals

of finding the "lost key" or truth for what I still con-

sider to be one of America's most interesting historical

mysteries.

The Foundation pledged then to print all views [of the

origin of the Melungeons], and still is doing so now. We

tried to clarify to members that not all Gowen related

families were tied to the Melungeons. In time I would

learn that there may be several partial truths from vari-

ous theories regarding the ethnicity of the original Me-

lungeons of Newmans Ridge, as well as 'some' their simi-

lar counterparts in the early Southeast. Until the mid

19th century, the first ones studied were the Appalachian

Melungeons, the Redbones of South Carolina, the Moors of

Delaware, and the Croatan [Lumbee Indians of NC].

Some of the original team members are still members of

GRF and we still have these same goals. Most serious re-

searchers who have controlled their human instincts to-

ward racial idealogy on this issue continue to believe

that the jury is still out.

Much has been discovered by many professionals since the

pioneer laymen of the 1990s took on the project. It rem-

ains incomplete as more theories surface, including Tim

Hashaws recent series. Yet, theories they all are. It

is such an emotional and complicated issue that it is

not unusual for different views on their ethnicity to be

disputed, with each giving many sources they consider ac-

curate and solid.

Hopefully the article regarding the DNA process by Dr. N.

Brent Kennedy in the April issue of the Newsletter may

resolve some of the questions. In the last few years

more of the so called experts have given us some convinc-

ing play on words to declare as fact who the Melungeons

were, and when minds are made up, even proper DNA results

may not change some minds.

A short critique of the Tim Hashaw Series: It is an ex-

tremely well written, fascinating story. One can under-

stand why Tim won journalism awards. I had hoped he

would cite original documents that show the early Angolan

Malange as Appalachian Melungeons, since his story was

written as historical fact.

The story of the first 20 Negroes to Virginia that Tim

ties to the Melungeon term was recently published in "The

William & Mary Quarterly" July 1998, by John Thorton,

and in "The New Light" April, 1997 by Engel Sluiter.

From my research so far, I would agree that Tim is right

to guess that the real Melungeons originally called them-

selves a name sounding similar to Melungeon. It may nev-

er have come from the French word "Melange" [meaning mix-

ed] as often suggested. There are several researchers

who have discovered this name being used in areas of the

world, other than guessing it came from the corruption of

Angolan "Malange." {See "Origin of Name Melungeon,"

Newsletter, September 2000 and Carroll Goyne's Melun Dag

Cyprus" story, May 2001.

Tim brought out an excellent point that has probably also

been a myth too long. All Negroes who come to the colo-

nies were not necessarily slaves. Freed endentured ser-

vants, black or white, were free to do as they wished and

inter marry as they pleased before the the anti-dark skin

laws began.

Tim seems to have taken the data from the Gowen Research

Manuscript, regarding the first Gowen Melungeons in Amer-

ica as solid fact to publish support for the ethnicity of

thousands of descendants. He leaves no room for "maybes"

or mistakes in genealogy. If possible errors are in the

manuscript as several members claim, the Foundation will

try to correct them. Honest mistakes or varying inter-

pretations have been made in research by most all of us.

The original Melungeon story has relied on guesswork of

scholars and lay writers since the 1880's. Are we to do

no better?

LDS CHURCH RELEASES 1880 CENSUS ON CD-ROMS

The complete 1880 census of the United States is being

released by the LDS Church in Salt Lake City. Approxi-

mately 50,000,000 names of U.S. citizens enumerated in

1880 have been transcribed into a set of 56 CD-ROM discs.

The entire set sells for $49.

Accompanying the CD-ROM set is a national index which

alphabetizes every name into a single index. A search

engine allows the user to search by names, states, towns

and other parameters. Although the collection is not a

reproduction of the entire 1880 census, it will point a

researcher to the exact location of his family 120 years

ago. The collection provides the following information

about each person listed:

* Last name

* First name, often including middle name or initials

* Age

* Sex

* Race

* Marital status

* Occupation

* Relationship to the head of household

* State or country of birth

* Father's state or country of birth

* Mother's state or country of birth

* National Archives microfilm number and page

* Family History Library microfilm number

From Melungeon Heritage Assn:

MELUNGEON HISTORY: A GATHERING AT VARDY ON JUNE 23, 2001

The annual Melungeon event this year is scheduled for

June 23 at Newman's Ridge, Vardy and Sneedville, Hancock

County, Tennessee [almost at the intersection of North

Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia].

This is where the two Melungeon patriarchs, Vardyman

"Vardy" Collins and Shepard "Buck" Gibson began leaving

records of their colorful lives. They and others used

the more limited definition of Melungeons; as Indians

with a Portuguese connection.

JOHN PETER GOINS WAS ATTRACTED TO WAVING SEA OF GRASS

RESULTING IN HIS MOVE TO WEST TEXAS FROM TENNESSEE

Teenage Johnny Goins listened spellbound to the pitchman

de­scribing the "waving sea of grass, stirrup-high and 300

miles wide" on the High Plains of West Texas to neighbor

J. C. Aus­mus on a September day in 1908.

Land agent B. W. Ellison, while extolling the fertility

of the vir­gin land, unfolded a map of 90,000 acres of

land owned by the C-B Livestock Company "as flat as a

pool table, on top of a sawed-off mountain." Located in

newly-organized Crosby County, Texas, it could be bought

at the give-away price of $3 an acre.

When Ellison declared, "You'd have to ride a mile to

find a rock as big as your fist," both Ausmus and Johnny

Goins were con­vinced. Both families had struggled with

the rocky, mountain­side land in Campbell County, Tennes-

see, trying to scratch a living out of the hard-scrabble.

Johnny Goins raced home to tell his parents about his de-

cision to head west. John Peter Goins had been born

there March 21, 1889 to Preston Goins and Annie Smith

Goins. His father was less than enthusiastic. "I don't

guess you will," he firmly told his son. But the deter-

mined Johnny Goins won out. He left his parents' home

on November 4, 1908, "the day William Howard Taft was

elected president of the United States."

Although he failed to realize fully the impact this de-

cision would have on the remainder of his life, John Pe-

ter Goins be­came a pioneer in a developing country. His

life was changed forever, according to an article in the

March 12, 1961 edition of "The Crosbyton Review" of

Crosbyton, Texas.

The Tennessee farm boy informed his parents, "I'll return

home in one year." He didn't! In fact, it was 16 years

before he re­turned to Tennessee for a visit.

Goins and the Ausmuses bought railroad tickets to Texas.

They changed cars in Kentucky and stayed overnight in

Kansas City where they turned south. The group "landed

in Seymour, Texas on November 4" and stayed at the B. W.

Ellison place three days. On the 11th, they hired John

Bradford to move them to Crosby­ton with his wagon and

team. Ausmus paid Bradford $25 to de­liver his family

and possessions, and Goins paid $10.

Leav­ing Seymour, they "didn't see one soul until we got

to Ben­jamin." They asked Bradford, "How could all these

counties get orga­nized when nobody lived there?" Brad-

ford explained that all they had to do was to "throw a

dance," and cowboys would ride 'clear across three coun-

ties" to get there. Texas law required 75 residents to

organize a county, and the dance would continue until

they had 75 signatures on the petition. "Occasionally

a cowboy signed for his horse, as well."

Camping overnight at Benjamin, Texas, the Tennesseeans

met east-bound Henry Leatherwood. "Mr. Leatherwood was

the first Crosby County man I met" the slightly-built

Goins remembers. He also got acquainted rapidly with

the rawness of West Texas, observing Leatherwood handl-

ing wild mules. Stock back home in Tennessee was

"raised right in the pen and was always tame."

Isolation and primitiveness were all around. Goins re-

called that Mrs. Ausmus cried all night long when they

were camped at Benjamin, expressing a desire to "go back

home to Tennessee." The Ausmus family "didn't stay long;

they compromised and went to Illinois."

Despite the adversities of this austere, pioneer land,

Johnny Goins stayed! The 19-year-old lad had "$15 in

cash when I got to Crosbyton. I bought a little food,

and we stayed that night in a half dugout on B. W. El-

lison's place west of town. Along about midnight, Har-

ley Coffey, Ewing Lawson and Luther Collier reached the

dugout to overnight."

Early the next morning, "Harley Coffey made breakfast.

He cooked the first biscuits I ate in Crosby County.

Ausmus killed an antelope, and we had fresh meat."

Goins met ranch foreman Jay Walling, "one of the finest

men I ever knew" and became a cowboy. "When Mr. Walling

hired me, he sent me to Crawfish Ranch to feed cattle.

That ranch was in Fairview Community where Goins six

years later purchased land, which became his home for

the next 63 years.

While working for Walling on the ranch Goins helped "lay

off the route from Crosbyton to Petersburg." A sled

pulled by four mules was utilized to blaze a trail and

to outline the road. "We went across many farms; most

land owners were agreeable. There was a lot of give-and

-take in opening up a new land. It was hard, but there

were also some fond memories."

Johnny Goins remembers driving a chuck wagon with the

crew which was building the road. Goins jumped from the

chuck wagon to open a gate. He was unprepared to see

the half-broke horses running off with the chuck wagon.

The mounted cow­boys soon had the runaway team under con-

trol.

Goins became friends with Frank White, newspaper editor

and helped him distribute the first issue of the "Cros-

byton Review" in January 1909. In fact, he had spent

part of Christmas Day in White's office watching him

handset type for that initial publi­cation. A copy of

the first issue of the paper was sent "to my father in

Tennessee." Six decades later, Johnny Goins owned the

longest-running subscription the newspaper ever had.

The former Tennessee farmboy worked as a freighter in

1909. He hauled freight on a wagon, going to Plainview on

a route. The job had its good points. "You could get

good meals for 25 cents at a boarding house in Plainview.

It also had its bad fea­tures. "I had a full load of

Irish potatoes when it came up a freeze, and they all

spoiled. I burned out on that job because of the weather.

One night, me and my team nearly froze. We had some hard

winters. I took 90 hides to Plainview one time, hides of

cattle which had froze or starved."

With the arrival of barbed wire, Crosby County began to

change from ranchland to farmland. By 1910, it was evi-

dent that the fertile land was ideal for rowcrop produc-

tion.

John Peter Goins was married about 1910, wife's name, No-

ra L. "John Goen" was the father of an infant born in

Crosby County November 30, 1911, according to Texas Bu-

reau of Statistics File 19418. A son was born to them

in 1915.

After seven years in Crosby County, Goins, now a full-

fledged Texan, became a landowner. He made a deal with

the C-B Livestock Company for 160 acres of land in the

Fairview com­munity. Actually it was an agriculture

lease for five years. The agreement called for $1 per

acre lease the first year, $1.25 the second year, $1.50

the third year, $1.75 the fourth year, and $2.00 the

fifth and final year.

At the end of the lease, the land contract was marked,

"Paid in Full." Goins moved to Fairview community in

1912 and "broke out the sod with a walking plow." He

farmed there until 1959.

"Exceptionally dry years" prevailed across West Texas in

1917 and 1918. And World War I was declared in 1917.

These were troubled years. The war ended November 11,

1918. The situa­tion was improving. "The drought broke,

and we had a good crop in 1919." He planted and harvest-

ed "wheat, oats, and high-gear" [heigera, a form of

maize].

Goins "bought my first car" October 11, 1921. He retain-

ed his original registration papers issued by the late B.

W. Mitchell, then sheriff and tax collector, 40 years

later. He has "my first poll tax receipt from 1910." He

also kept his first auto license plates and his registra-

tion cards from two World Wars.

The spry pioneer points out that he vividly recalls

events from his childhood in Tennessee -- recalling the

Bible verse from his final Sunday school lesson there--

and "things when I first came out here are fresh in my

mind, but I don't remember other things" more recent.

Addressing the changing times, Goins says "people start-

ed gath­ering at Fairview before sundown to get a seat for

plays" pre­sented at school. Community life was strong in

those days. He served 12 years on the Fairview school

board "before it was consolidated with Ralls in 1948."

Admitting that he "strongly opposed" the consolidation

move, Goins is emphatic that "when we lost our school,

we lost our community life."

Goins comes down hard on "farmers who talk about hard

times. Lord o' mercy, in the early days, many people

lost their land and did well to just live. We didn't

have disaster payments, or Social Security or anything."

Continuing on the changing times, Goins remembers "I

helped break out lots of sod land. I had three horses

to a plow and walked behind. "The first cotton I raised,

I hauled to Floydada in 1921 and sold for six cents a

pound."

John Peter Goins was remarried to Miss Ruth Pratt Febru-

ary 15, 1942, according to Crosby County Marriage Book 3,

page 451. This pioneer man who will celebrate his 92nd

birthday on March 21 "if the Lord let's me live," says.

"when farmers lived on a quarter or a half section, they

had milk cows, chickens, and meat hogs. They had their

living at home. They took milk and eggs to town on Sat-

urday and sold them. This kept the little man on the

farm."

Goins and his third wife, the former Alice Holmes "who I

met by accident November 14, 1964 and married June 18,

1966" will be allowed to maintain their residence on the

Fairview farm for the remainder of their lives. "I hated

to sell the land after living here 73 years because I

knew we'd never own another home," the pioneer admits.

GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE 2000 CENSUS

WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT IN THE NEXT CENTURY

The federal census of 2000 suggests that genealogy may be

a little more complicated when family researchers a hun-

dred years from now begin to discover their 20th century

roots. It is because more and more couples are living

together "without the benefit of clergy."

Five and a half million unmarried couples were living to-

gether in 2000. That's almost double the three million

singles living together in 1990, according to the U.S.

Census Bureau.

Over 25% of the U.S. population now live alone. In 1960,

only eight percent of the population lived alone. Today

the typical family of father, mother and 1.6 children

compose only 25% of the total; In 1960, they composed 40%

of all households in America.

There seems to be no consistant pattern of determining

surnames for children of unmarried parents and unwed mo-

thers. Perhaps genetic genealogy will have to be used

in 22nd century research.

The 11 children of Shadrack Going named in his 1805 Pat-

rick Co., VA, will: Obadiah, Keziah, John, David [David

Smith], James, Claborne, Laban/Leeborne, Shadrack Jr.,

Caleb, Fanny (w/o Edward Bowlin), and Hannah (w/o Thomas

Beasley). There were at least two others: Jerusha, not

named in her father's will but named in an 1807 deed in

which she and Keziah jointly released claim to their fa-

ther's estate; and Nathan, who was murdered September 21

1793 by Robert Hall (who struck him in the head with a

weeding hoe).

Of the 12 surviving children, 8 were in Grainger Co., TN,

at the time of their father's death. Keziah, Jerusha,

Obadiah, and Hannah were still in Patrick County. Obadi-

ah was the major beneficiary of Shadrack's will; in mid-

1806, six of his brothers in TN signed over power-of-at-

torney to a Patrick County lawyer to break the will.

They finally made an out-of-court settlement in late

1807, at which time the land was sold and Obadiah, too,

moved to TN. Kesiah [Keziah] was in Patrick as late as

1813; not sure what became of her. Jerusha was there too,

listed with Kesiah on the special 1813 free persons of

color tax list.

She was counted in neighboring Stokes Co., NC, in 1820,

and registered as a free woman of color in Patrick in

1821, at which time she, her daughter, and her grandson

moved to Ohio.

This left Hannah (Going) Beasley the last of Shadrack's

children in Virginia. Thomas Beasley's 1835 will lists

his six children. They were: Polly (bc1790, never mar-

ried, but had a family in Patrick County); Shadrack

(bc1790, m1821 in Surry County to Martha Harris); Harden

(b. 1790s); Hannah (m1831 in Patrick County to Seaton

Chandler); Catherine (m1821 in Surry County to Benjamin

Harris) and Thomas Jr. (inherited bulk of his father's

estate but washed out financially in Patrick in 1845-46).

All of these folks moved freely around between Patrick,

Surry, and Stokes. Catherine and Shadrack left the area,

I think, Catherine about 1848 and Shadrack in the 1860s.

Thomas Beasley, Sr.'s widow, Hannah (Going) Beasley, died

in early 1845 (estate sale in Patrick County).

Some of the other Beasleys you will see in Stokes & Pat-

rick Counties are the families of Benjamin Beasley (c1762

-1841), who was Thomas's brother, and his wife Rachel

Prather; and the family of Robert Beasley & Caty Beasley.

Robert may have been another brother--not sure.

Hope this helps,

The Tim Hashaw report was certainly an informative and

well researched report for all our quests of our Melun-

geon origins. These types of documented materials stimu-

late many of us to continue the ever elusive search for

selected minorities in our great melting pot called the

United States of America.

Unfortunately,we must take his papers as yet another

speculative study that is yet to be resolved. We cannot

start with a hypothetical premise that the core of what

we call Melungeons came from Angola, Africa and then

trace their migrations throughout the Eastern Seaboard.

The last Gowen newsletter with Mr. Hashaw's conclusions

included Brent Kennedy's management of new studies of

DNA at the University of Virginia. This type of research

is probably our best hope to eventually solve the Melun-

geon mystery. This group is collecting selected Melun-

geon DNA materials for present and future studies. Cur-

rently even this study has its shortcomings as our genet-

icists are just now mapping the entire DNA makeup of the

human species. Most researchers feel we will understand

our genetic map in the near future. Eventually there is

hope that through genetics we can actually trace the ex-

act paths of the first man from Africa, as well as iden-

tify migratory routes of and origins of many different

peoples over our entire planet.

There is still some hope that archeologists will make

some unique find to help identify the source of the Me-

lungeons, but with limited labor and resources, as well

as little interest in this minority this does not seem

too feasible at this time. Surveillance equipment will

improve for looking under the ground and sea, but cur-

rently only a limited amount of people are interested in

this mystery. Perhaps future finds of artifacts of an-

cient peoples in selected sites of the coastal waters or

lands of America will add confirmation to new knowledge

and understanding of genetic findings.

We must applaud cousin Tom Hashaw for his fine work and

added stimulation for our thoughts. At this time,we must

not take his fine investigative efforts and theories as

gospel as we store away his materials in our libraries

for future reference. We do not yet know whether we are

Portuguese, Turkish, Angolan, or one of the many others

theorized in history. We must all continue to follow

the quest!

Your Revolutionary ancestors will come to life in South-

ern Vermont during the 9th Annual Ethan Allen Days on

June 16, & 17, 2001. Whether your ancestors served in

the Revolution or supported it from home, you will be

able to see how they lived and fought for independence

as the roar of revolutionary cannons and the crack of

musket fire echo along the old Ethan Allen Highway

(Historic Route 7A) and through the historic Battenkill

River Valley in Sunderland, Vermont, where Allen mustered

his band of Green Mountain Boys. The weekend will fea-

ture battle reenactments, music, food, crafters, arti-

sans, and fun for the entire family as Ethan Allen Days

returns for its ninth year.

I am still perusing cousin's Gowen/Gowan emails; and hav-

ing absolutely no luck finding the elusive William Gowen

/Gowan/Goban/Gobin of Island Creek District, Granville NC

His daughter Susannah, born 04/23/1769, was married to

John Greenway c1793, but no marriage record exists. John

& Susannah had 5 children in Granville County, moved to

Rutherford County, NC c1805, then had 3 more children.

Does anyone have information on them?
