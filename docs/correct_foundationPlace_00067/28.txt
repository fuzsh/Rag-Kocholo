Loadstar #168 has just hit the streets. If I don't get complaints about

bandwidth, I'd like to post all the text from each issue, primarily so that

non-subscribers can see what they are missing.

In case you've ever wondered what's on an issue of LOADSTAR, here is all the

text from issue #168. Remember this 213K is ONLY the text. We pack all this

text and automatically unpack and present it. There's three times as much

binary data on each the disk.

DISKOVERY: WHY JULY 5, 1998?

by Fender Tucker

The sky is falling! The sky is

falling! How often have we heard

these words from various Chicken

Littles of all faiths and creeds? Not

often enough, apparently, because

even the Church of the Subgenius has

named a date when all bets are off,

and that time is drawing near: July

5, 1998, 7:00 am. At that time,

according to Subgenius doctrine, the

Xists (beings from the Planet X) will

arrive and usher in a new dawn, an

era ruled by the Epopts and Divine

Drone-Men of J.R. "Bob" Dobbs' unique

"religion". Supposedly I'm one of

them.

I became a Subgenius around ten

years ago by sending $25 to a postal

address in Dallas TX. I received in

the mail a very nice poster

proclaiming that, as a FORE-MAN of

the church, I possess an Official,

Divine All-Inclusive EXCUSE for

anything I might do. Since then I

have strengthened my status in the

church by buying cassette tapes,

pamphlets and the two definitive

"bibles" of the organization, THE

BOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS and REVELATION

X, THE BOB APOCRYPHON (both published

by Fireside Books and still in

print). As with most religions, the

more you donate, the holier you are.

The first time I saw the "Grand

Exalted Mojo" of the Subgenii, J.R.

"Bob" Dobbs, was in the comics pages

of the National Lampoon magazine.

Old-timers may remember when this

publication was funny, back in the

70s, and featured a comic strip

called "The Applegates", if I

remember correctly. The strip was

about a typical All-American family

of grinning cretins, headed by a

pipe-smoking, smiling patriarch, the

guy on the right in the title picture

for this issue of LOADSTAR. I didn't

understand what it was all about but

that father guy sure did mentally

torture the rest of his family!

As the 70s reeled into the 80s, I

began seeing the creepy visage of

"Bob" showing up in strange places,

as graffiti on highway overpasses, on

the backs of envelopes from shady

organizations. Perhaps you've seen

"Bob" too, and wondered who the hell

he was?

It wasn't until I moved to

Shreveport back in 1987 that I found

out that "Bob" is the figurehead of a

religion known as the Church of the

Subgenius, and that its Mecca is

Dallas TX. Dallas! What kind of

religion would pick a hellish place

like Dallas as its Valhalla? Maybe my

kind of religion?

I wasn't really convinced about

the Subgenius until I passed some of

its propaganda to Jeff Jones. He read

a few pages and stated that of all

the religions of the world, he

admired and respected them all --

except the Subgenius. When I heard

that, I knew I had found my faith.

There's no way I can synopsize

all of the contradictory teachings of

the Subgenius, except by quoting one

of their more apt mottoes: "We pull

the wool over our OWN eyes." I like

that. No one has ever been more

destructive to me than myself. If

anyone is going to bilk me out of

fortune and reason, I want it to be

me.

But what really convinced me that

the teachings of "Bob" Dobbs were

relevant to my life was a 365.25 to 1

shot -- X-Day, July 5, 1998, 7:00 am.

Of all 365.25 days "Bob" could have

picked, he chose my 51st birthday...

almost to the minute. Why July 5?

According to REVELATION X, it has

something to do with Independence

Day. The Subgenius call July 4 a

holiday for "pinks" (their pet name

for anyone who hasn't sent $25 to the

church), and that all true Subgenii

wait until the next day to have their

fun. I know I do.

I don't expect anyone to believe

a word that Ivan Stang and the other

high-ranking Subgenii spew all over

their literature. It's ridiculous and

flies in the face of all we consider

holy. But they did pick my

birthday... If anything weird does

happen on that date -- we've all been

given plenty of warning -- I'll be as

surprised as anyone. My guess is that

life will go on, and 99.99999% of the

earth's population will never know

that yet another apocalyptic

prediction has crapped out. The

.00001% who does (the Subgenius) is

planning a big "devolution"

(Subgenius word for "party") in

Sherman NY on X-day. Here's a clip

from an announcement they sent me:

"This is THE LAST SUBGENIUS EVENT --

EVER! Can you feel it, children? That

low rumble coming from the ground,

like a billion-ton train rolling like

thunder, gaining momentum, gaining

speed, getting closer and closer

until BANG! the air splits, the Earth

screams, the seas boil and it's

ARMAGEDDON! Yes, kindred, X-Day's so

close you can almost hear the

screams, you can almost taste the

sweet nectar of VENGEANCE!"

Wow! Makes you almost wanna

believe, doesn't it?

The good news is that LOADSTAR

#169 is the last issue that will be

worked on prior to X-Day, and after

that you probably won't be hearing

any more Subgenius crapola from me.

Unless the Xists really do show

up...

There's a couple of Commodore-

supporting companies that you ought

to know about.

THE VINTAGE COMPUTER, 520

Silverbrook Drive, El Cajon CA 92019,

619-445-8432, vinta...@fda.net,

www.vintagecomputer.com

CPU - The Commodore 128/64 Power

User newsletter, P.O. Box 1817,

Shelton WA 98584, com...@delphi.com

THE VINTAGE COMPUTER sells

hardware and software and has a

16-page catalog full of good, new and

used software, and used hardware. The

prices are very reasonable,

especially for the hardware. Remember

the prices I asked for the computers

and drives I had a few month's back?

Their prices are better. 1541s are

$25, C-64s are $35, 1571s are $40.

They even have a few 1581s for $90

but they won't last long. If you

don't get their catalog, you should.

CPU, published by Tom Gosser, is

a newsletter that disappeared for

a while, but it's back. In Issue #4,

1998, Tom tells the story how his

mobile home office was broken into a

year ago and all the non-Commodore

items stolen. Unfortunately, the

culprits decided to torch the place

afterwards. Tom lost his 128s and

subscriber mailing list. But he was

finally able to salvage a disk with

subscriber addresses and now he's

planning to continue publishing

quarterly. It's $15.00 a year for U.S

addresses, $21 for Canada and Mexico,

and $27 for overseas. Issue #4 had 14

pages of articles, reviews and a

couple of small type-ins, and 12

pages of advertisements.

````````````````````````````````````

LOADSTAR 128 subscribers who get

it on a 1541 disk were probably

disappointed to find that many of the

copies we sent out had disk errors on

them. We sure were. Softdisk's Rimage

Mass Copier (a $100,000 machine in

its day) finally bit the dust in an

especially cruel way, telling us the

copies were fine, when they weren't.

Luckily we found out about it before

we sent out LS #167. Too bad we

didn't find out before we had copied

about 1400 disk sides with the bad

copier!

So now we copy Sides One and

Three of the 1541 version on ALF mass

copiers (which are sometimes flaky,

but so far have been kind to us), and

Sides Two and Four on 1541-driven

systems in a room across the hall from

the magnificent 168-story LOADSTAR

Tower. I have four 128s, each with

two 1541 drives, set up. I load

Fast Hack 'Em's 52-second-copier into

each computer and we're able to copy

about four sides a minute.

We're still researching new ways

to speed the process up, but for now

we can live with it. We can't use the

ALFs to copy the back sides of the

disks because the ALFs require that

there be an index hole on the side

being copied. Our disk crisis of a

couple month's ago was a lack of

disks with [two] index holes.

Apparently the last company to make

these has dropped them from their

line. So we now use disks with one

index hole, and have to use something

other than the ALFs to copy the back

sides.

But there's another problem:

notches. The disks we've been

scrounging not only don't have an

index hole for the back; they don't

have a notch, either. Judi and I

tried notching a few hundred disks

one afternoon, and although we now

have thumb muscles that are the envy

of every pumped up dude at the

LOADSTAR Tower Spa, it wasn't any

fun. In fact, it was quite painful.

So I figured out how to wire a

1541 so it ignores the write-protect

sensor. Did I use the electronic

techniques I learned back in 1968 as

a technician for the Nike-Hercules

Missile system? No. I called Doug

Cotton at CMD and he said he thought

that an 1800 ohm resistor across the

sensor's leads would do it.

I was only able to find 1500 ohm

resistors at Radio Shack but I

figured they'd work -- and they did!

You may never have any reason for

defeating the write-protect system in

your 1541s, but if you do, it's easy.

Take off the cover and metal heat

shield. Then find a big white

connector on the left side of the

drive (as you're facing the front)

that has several sets of wires going

into the top of it. You don't have to

disconnect the connector; just leave

it as it is.

If you number the holes in the

top of the connector from front to

back, find the two wires that go into

holes 3 and 4. In most drives these

were orange and green, but I found at

least one drive where they were

orange and purple. All you have to do

is bend the leads of the resistor and

clip them off about a quarter inch

from the resistor, like this:

````````

`resistor`

} ```````` }

```` ````

} }

Then simply poke the two ends of the

leads into the connector holes where

the orange and green (or purple)

wires go, making sure that the leads

touch the small metal "sleeve" around

each wire. No soldering! The holes

are just the right size to hold the

resistor in place. Bend the resistor

flat so that it doesn't touch the

metal shield when you put the drive

back together.

It works. You can write to the

disk even if there's no notch. That

trick saved Judi and me a lot of time

and pain.

Thanks, Doug!

````````````````````````````````````

Many years ago when I was the

brash young editor of a thriving disk

magazine, I opined that the best way

to become an "expert" was to pick a

field so narrow that you only had to

kick two or three butts in order to

become #1. Of course I never expected

anyone to pay any attention to my

advice.

But Maurice Jones called my bluff

and decided to become the world's

greatest solitaire game programmer

for 8-bit computers. He concentrated

his energies on developing a

solitaire game "shell" that would

make succeeding games easier to

produce. Sure enough, within a couple

of years he was putting out a game a

month. As his shell got more

powerful, and his familiarity with

every single line in it grew, he was

able to do two or more games a month.

Now he can do a game every couple of

days and has had months where he

produced six or more.

I'd say that makes Maurice an

expert, by anyone's definition. Not

only has he just about exhausted the

book that lists the rules for most

known solitaire games, he's been

coming up with highly original ROTATO

(rhymes with "potato") games lately.

ROTATO games, a concept that Maurice

and I claim to have invented, are

card solitaire games for computer,

with rules that make the game

practically impossible to play with

real cards. They involve card

movements that are easy to do on

computer, but way too much trouble to

do with cards.

By the time you read this,

Maurice will have had his 72nd

birthday, had his 57th card game

published and will have written his

90th or so program. To commemorate

this auspicious occasion, we have

come up with another compilation of

eight of Maurice's previously

unpublished programs, called

MAURICE'S EIGHT-MORE. It's a $12

product, just like his last

compilation, MAURICE'S EIGHT-PACK,

and contains these solitaires:

SEVEN UP

BLOCK TEN

DEUCES

ALHAMBRA

GARGANTUA

CONGRESS

ROUGE ET NOIR

WILL O' THE WISP

In an average day you will meet

people who call themselves "experts",

and charge you accordingly for their

expertise, but here's a chance to

enjoy the works of a true expert, and

at the same time purchase for a

paltry $12 a part of what will

eventually be considered the greatest

collection of solitaire card games

ever written for computer, THE WORKS

OF MAURICE JONES.

To order, call 1-800-594-3370 and

aks for MAURICE'S EIGHT-MORE, item

number #0061D5 (1541 version) or

#0061D3 (1581 version).

The Names Were Changed

To Protect The Doofus

by Jeff "Jacko" Jones

I first met Chang through the

mail. He was a promising young

programmer from a foreign country.

The code he sent my small software

company was good and tight. We liked

him. We began a long and intimate

tele-relationship through Ma Bell.

Chang was a bright young go-getter,

the kind of bright young spirit that

made me want to check my throat for a

pulse. Sure, as a veteran programmer,

I was intimidated by his bright ideas

and youthful energy. I felt he was

smarter than I was, that his code was

more well planned and implemented.

His problem-solving skills were

clearly ahead of mine. In short,

Chang was a better programmer -- plus

the dames liked him. By the time he

was my age, he would be twice the

programmer I was.

Then one day I got the call,

"Jacko, I got the FD-2000 you sent

me. I don't like it. I'm going to

return it."

This was incredible to me because

I knew he needed the FD unit. "But,

Chang, you told me that your 1571 was

failing. What are you going to use?"

"Well, my 1571 is only a little

flakey. I mean I only have to turn it

off and on for years to make sure a

save works and I have a hard time

formatting disks. It's not that

bad."

"Chang! I can't believe I'm

hearing this! What's wrong with the

FD-2000?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"Well the activity light is too

dim."

"Huh?!?"

"The [activity light] -- it's too

[dim]."

"What? You can't see it?"

"Oh, I can see it. It's just

dimmer than that big wide green 1571

LED."

I snorted, "Then turn off the

lights while you save!"

"Nice try, Jacko, but the light's

just too dim."

"It can't be just that! Is it

slower than you thought?"

"No. In fact, it's noticeably

faster than the 1571, even with that

JiffyDOS chip you sent me."

"So what is it really? You've had

it for a week now."

"I just don't trust it."

"Have you ever lost data with

it?"

"No."

"Have you lost data on your

1571?"

"Yes, many, many times."

"Yet you'd rather use an old 1571

half-dead that you have to beg to

assemble your code than a brand new

FD-2000?"

"Call me an old stick in the mud,

but I can't get used to the drive.

It's too quiet. I've already got it

boxed up."

"I can't believe this, Chang.

You're saying the drive is too quiet

now? These don't sound like

legitimate complaints."

"They aren't. I just don't know

the drive. What if I get a directory

error? I don't even know how to fix

them on an FD-2000."

"Hah! You'll probably never see a

directory error [again]! I used to

see directory errors all the time,

but not anymore. Not since I've been

using CMD drives. I haven't seen a

directory error literally in [years]!

Not only that: no 'drive not ready

errors'. Not unless the disk isn't

inserted or the the disk isn't

formatted."

"I just don't trust it!"

"Take it from me. I've been using

one for about five years now. They

are better made than CBM drives.

Better shielded, too. My FD-2000 runs

fine sitting on top of my hard drive.

My 1581 had to be a foot away from it

to work."

"And what would happen of you had

an error on your hard drive? You'd

lose everything. How do you get a

directory back on a monster like

that?"

"Chang, calm down. It's simple.

CMD directories are identical to CBM

directories. They just start on a

different track. Plus I've already

lost data on my hard drive and --"

"I thought you said these drives

were ultra-reliable!"

"Ahem! Let me finish. I've

already lost data on my hard drive

when I was working on two programs

that altered directories. Namely

Directomeister and Hannibal Sector.

The fault was totally my own. But

getting the data back was no

different than getting data back on a

1571. I just got it back faster."

"I don't know! I know this sounds

stupid. It makes no sense, but I'm

just [scared] of this drive. I've

programmed one way for years and now

--"

"Chang, do me a favor. Just plug

the drive back up and use it for

another week. Can you do that?"

"I guess."

"Do it because if you don't

you're going to make a huge

mistake."

I lost track of Chang for about a

month and then on a lark, I called

him. I was surprised to hear that his

voice had changed. Somehow it was

deeper, richer. Somehow he seemed

more sure of himself. In the

background, I could hear a

semiconscious woman moaning his name.

Obviously I had called at a bad

time.

"Yo." It was Chang's customary

salutation.

"It's me, Jacko. I hope I haven't

called at a bad time."

"Jacko! Glad you called! That FD-

2000 is the best thing since sliced

bread! Love it! Love it! I got a

second one and mounted it on the hood

of my car. What a babe magnet it

is!"

"Glad to hear it."

"Glad I listened to you. I was

being a real doofus."

"I'm always glad to be reminded

when I'm right, Chang. Please, don't

stop!" I chuckled.

Then I heard my own words

repeated by Chang's new dame: "Chang,

please don't stop. Get off the

phone."

"Jacko..."

"I know, Chang. You have to go."

"I'll be checking into those hard

drives and RAMLinks next month. With

names like those, they can only

improve my love life."

Click.

The young bastard! If I were ten

years younger, I knew what I'd do

with a good hard drive. But that's

another story. I was glad for him

though. He waded through his fear of

the new and unknown into a new vista

of speed and reliability. Not only

that, he got the girl. As I strained

my way up the stairs to my office and

opened my checkbook, I wondered if I

should should have warned him about

alimony.

Dear LOADSTAR,

Where are the Op Ed cartoons? I

like them and look forward to seeing

more! Very funny! P.S. Is Jeff Jones

an official spokesperson for the

Clinton Admin? Did Jeff give

absolution to Clinton like Billy

Graham did?

er...@ptw.com

[FT:] I haven't received any op ed

cartoons lately, but check out the

TOON CONTEST which starts with this

issue. It's as funny as you can make

it. I must admit that I may have

alienated one of our best op ed

cartoonists. He'd call me up whenever

we published any of his cartoons and

because I couldn't remember what he

expected as payment or what we had

talked about the last time he called,

he'd get mad. I don't think he ever

understood that I immediately forget

everything I say on the phone once I

hang up. It's the only way to stay

sane in this type of job.

As for Jeff Jones, Bill Clinton and

Billy Graham...I'm sorry, there's no

diplomatic way to end that sentence.

Hello Fender!

I hope you are okay! I found

LOADSTAR on the Internet and read

about CHARTSTAR: "The most

full-featured chart-making program

ever published."

To read this is like candy for my

eyes. The first thing I will do

tomorrow is show it to my friends at

work. We have all recently been

connected to the internet at work. I

bought a digital camera last

Christmas, and it is great fun and a

very practical way of using the

internet, communicating with friends

all over. I can't remember ever having

such a fun "boy's-toy". I am

terrorizing all my friends and

patients with it.

Peter Marions

mar...@swed.com

[FT:] Good to hear from you, Peter.

I'm flattered you found us on the

net.

Peter Marions was one of the best

128 programmers around in the early

days of LOADSTAR 128 and I think his

CHART 128 and PAINT 128 were two of

the best 128 programs ever. CHARTSTAR

(on LS #62) is the 64 version of

CHART 128. He never did anything

halfway and I imagine he is still as

successful as he was back then.

Except for maybe having a bunch of

terrorized patients...

Dear Administrator,

Every time I have many problems

when I want to do my home work or

anything serious to write because I

haven't an ordinator. This trouble

bothering me so much, I am Swirling.

I think about a lap-top. Please

help me to resolve this problem.

Trusting I shall hear from you

without delay, I am, Sir, yours

truly.

Amise Ulysse

154 Route des Dalles

Port-au-Prince, Haiti

La Belle Etoile

[FT:] Well, obviously you do need an

ordinator, but I don't think a lap-top

is the answer. Any advice from the

LOADSTARites out there?

Dear Fender,

I received your disk with your

version of my Compleat LOADSTAR Music

List. I realize that you had to do a

lot of shaving to get my listings

down to a size suitable for LOADSTAR,

but it's too bad the descriptions of

the songs had to go -- especially

those that told which songs were

background music and which were parts

of jukeboxes.

I have been updating my list with

every issue and will continue to do

so. If your readers would want my

much larger files (which describe the

songs and players more fully), have

them write me and I will send them my

detailed list on disk.

Too bad you still couldn't

identify the songs on LS #27 and #28.

I believe it was Jim Weiler who

transcribed them. I sure would like

to know what program was used to

enter those pieces.

Kenneth Barsky

100-28 Benchley Place

New York NY 10475

[FT:] Kenneth's lists are on this

issue on Side Four. He's right about

his lists being much more detailed

than what we published. I felt that I

couldn't devote more than 300 blocks

to the lists so I pared them down.

It's nice of Kenneth to offer the

lists to anyone. Be nice to him if

ask for his lists.

Jim W. said that the songmaker they

used in those days was written by Joe

Garrett and Alan Gardner, and was the

precursor to SongSmith. There are

probably programming wizards who

could reverse-engineer the song codes

and re-write the songmaker but

there's little chance of anyone

wanting to. Sorry.

Hiya Fender!

I am looking forward to seeing

the presenter for the FLAGS & ANTHEMS

collection. I have an HD disk all

ready for the compleat series.

Also, a while back you published

STAR LOADER. You said in the docs

that it could be written to use

RAMLink partitions, though you hadn't

gotten around to finishing the code.

How about it, Fender? Such a program

would make the RAMLink easier to use.

Whenever I find C= users I give them

disks with STAR LOADER as a menu,

along with whatever old Fastload

cartridge I may have on hand. I would

like to see STAR LOADER finished and

in my RAMLink.

[FT:] Ask and ye shall believe. On

Side Four of this issue is THE

COMPLEAT FLAGS & ANTHEMS presenter.

You won't need an HD disk, though;

just a regular 1581-format disk is

plenty big enough for the files, once

they've been converted to "c." files

by "b.countrifier" (also on this

issue).

Jeff's got his new, improved STAR

LOADER just about ready to go and it

will appear on LS #169 as SUPER BOOT.

I think it will do everything you

ever wanted a program to do on your

RAMLink.

Dear LOADSTAR,

What is the complete ADSR

envelope used for the trumpet in

Trumpeter's Lullaby in ANDERSON

JUKEBOX II on LS #167?

[FT:] As Grand Exalted Mojo of

LOADSTAR I'm supposed to know

everything about everything we

publish, especially the ADSR

envelopes for all the songs. So I

booted up SID EDITOR and loaded

"trumplullaby.mus" from LS #167. Then

I played the song and noticed that

Voice 1 was doing most of the

"trumpet" soloing. So while the song

was playing I pressed F1 a couple of

times to go to a screen where all of

the parameters for all three voices

are displayed -- in real time. Nifty!

It looks like the ADSR envelope for

Voice 1 is:

Attack = 5

Decay = 0

Sustain = 15

Release = 0

However, it changes as the song goes

on, so you would probably glean more

about how Dave Marquis does his thing

by booting up SID EDITOR yourself and

studying the parameters. As far as I

know, SID EDITOR (with manual) is

available from Parsec, P.O. Box 111,

Salem MA 01970-0111. Tell John Brown

that LOADSTAR sent ya'.

Dear LOADSTAR,

I want to answer the question you

had in LS #167 ULTRAGEMS about why

this syntax doesn't work:

load"file",peek(186)
