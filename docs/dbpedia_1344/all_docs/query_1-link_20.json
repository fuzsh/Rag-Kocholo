        "text": "Why Major Companies Hire Incompetent Document Controllers Major companies often end up hiring less competent Document Controllers instead of professional and qualified ones for several reasons: Cost Considerations: To save on salaries, companies might opt for less experienced candidates. However, this can result in higher long-term costs due to errors and inefficiencies. Insufficient Screening Processes: Inadequate recruitment processes may fail to properly assess candidates' qualifications, leading to the hiring of underqualified individuals. Misaligned Job Descriptions: Vague or inaccurate job descriptions can attract unsuitable candidates, resulting in poor hiring decisions. Internal Hiring Bias: Companies might prioritize internal candidates or referrals over more qualified external applicants, often due to loyalty or familiarity. Networking and Connections: Hiring based on personal connections rather than qualifications can result in less competent Document Controllers being selected. Solutions To improve the recruitment of Document Controllers, companies should: Invest in Quality Recruitment: Use comprehensive screening methods and practical assessments to thoroughly evaluate candidates' competencies. Enhance Job Descriptions: Create clear and accurate job descriptions to attract suitable candidates. Implement Fair Hiring Practices: Ensure objective and transparent processes that evaluate all candidates based on skills and qualifications. By addressing these issues, companies can hire more qualified Document Controllers, leading to better organizational efficiency and reduced operational risks.\n\n4\n\n1 Comment\n\nA Good Project Team👬 I believe a good project team is a blend of representatives from the supplier, contractor and end user. The success rate of any project hinges on seamless synchronization between all parties, from the project award to delivery and handover to the actual end user. Unfortunately, in many projects, the end user remains hidden until project delivery or even until handover, often due to various reasons. Advantages of Involving End Users from the Beginning: 📈 • Clear Requirements: Early involvement helps in capturing accurate requirements, reducing the risk of misunderstandings. • Better Alignment: Ensures that the project outcomes align with the actual needs of the end users. • Increased Buy-In: Involvement fosters a sense of ownership and commitment from the end users. • Early Problem Identification: Potential issues or conflicts can be identified and addressed sooner, reducing costly changes later. Disadvantages of Involving End Users Early: 📉 • Complex Decision-Making: More stakeholders can lead to longer decision-making processes, potentially delaying progress. • Scope Creep: Frequent input from end users might lead to changes in requirements, causing scope creep and project overruns. • Resource Constraints: Involving end users requires their time and resources, which might be limited during early project stages. • Potential for Conflicting Interests: Balancing the perspectives of all stakeholders, including end users, can be challenging and may lead to conflicts. While involving end users early in the project can present challenges, excluding them often leads to more complications during execution and delivery. Do you agree that the end user should be involved from the outset, or does it add unnecessary complexity? #ProjectManagement #Teamwork #StakeholderManagement #EndUserExperience #ProjectSuccess #BusinessStrategy #Leadership #ProjectExecution #Collaboration #ScopeCreep\n\n31\n\n9 Comments\n\n(33) 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑒 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑝 𝑣𝑠. 𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 happen when project team add extra features weren't part of original scope as “freebies” to client. Possible causes include: •Going above & beyond, thinks it will satisfy client. •Showing off, demonstrate their abilities. •Distracting from defects as attempt to hide deficiencies. Often, gold plating is well-intentioned & may initially seem like a good idea. client may appreciate extra work, but they could also be upset that changes were made without their approval. 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐩 is small changes made in project during implementation, cause minor deviations from original scope. As more small changes gradually added,can accumulate snowball into a bigger impact on project. ●Scope Creep Causes •Changes in external conditions that might necessitate altering project. •Client requirements change half way through project execution. •Client don't communicate their vision properly. •Lack of coordination between client & project team. •Having multiple contact points in team &/or in client side can result changes made without a consensus from all stakeholders. •Change in leadership at client side lead to change in their vision. •Lack of good understanding of original project scope, lead to misinterpretation. •Organization may have unhealthy competition within itself, lead to different teams trying to take project in different directions. •Teams may add extra features that clients didn't ask for. •Management promise more than what they can deliver. ●Scope Creep Lead To: •Project delays •Expansion of features •Inadequate budget •Dilution of goals •Greater workload for project team •Ineffective outcomes •Increased number of deliverables •Final deliverables that are different from original plan •Project failure •Low team morale ●Scope Creep Importance It is impossible to completely avoid or eliminate scope creep from your project. Projects are mostly dynamic in nature, & changes during execution are inevitable. While scope creep can create problems, forcibly eliminating it by not accepting any change can also harm the project. So, there’s always a thin line between being flexible enough to accept changes in project & allow changes to accumulate & cause project failure. Managing scope creep can offer some benefits: •Keeping project relevant, despite changing market conditions •Keeping your team sharp & adaptable •Ensure customer satisfaction •Improve profitability ●Tips to manage scope creep •Proactive change anticipation •Involve all stakeholders to achieve consensus •Document project requirements & clearly define scope. •Finalize expectations out of project •Discuss with team & clarify everything •Improve task management practices •Put effective change & risk management processes •Use right project management tools •Be flexible to a certain extent •Give clients choice to add more deliverables at additional cost #Project_Management_Series #Sawy_Says\n\n65\n\n10 Comments\n\nHi I am developing a risk matrix to analyze the key factors affecting the completion of a project schedule. This matrix will focus on critical elements, excluding project creep as it should be continuously monitored and managed through regular reviews and communication. One of the primary factors identified is the availability of materials. Without the necessary materials, we cannot maintain equipment, which would impede the completion of scheduled tasks. Another crucial factor is the availability of specialist resources. A lack of specialized personnel can cause significant delays to the project timeline. Normal resources should also be agreed and in place. Access to equipment is also vital. Delays in releasing equipment or issues with achieving suitable isolations to perform tasks can hinder project progress. Usually the reason for this can be, failure to realise that normal isolations cannot be achieved. Extreme weather conditions represent another significant risk, potentially impacting the entire project schedule. Finally, task overlap on the worksite can lead to various stages of the project being moved or delayed. Proper coordination and scheduling are essential to mitigate this risk. I would be interested in other factors that would primarily affect the completion of a schedule once it had been agreed and budgeted. I would also expect that communication lines for dealing with project change were all agreed and in place.\n\n2\n\n2 Comments\n\nFact or Feeling ? I was reminded recently that feelings are not facts. However, abstract facts can support “feelings”. In the project world , it’s better if we deal in the world of objectivity , data points, measurable KPIs, and other relevant pieces of information broken down for context. The starting point matters. If I start with a “feeling”, I am predestined to live in the world of confirmation bias. If I let the data points inform my projections, I’m dealing in a world of science that properly informs my decision making and value judgements. There is a huge difference between the two and we must be careful to constantly evaluate ourselves for the trap of falling into the rut of “feelings” led confirmation bias. #feelings #facts #data #KPIs #measurement #earnedvalue #accuracy\n\n12\n\n3 Comments\n\nSometimes I want to complain about everything. Look at me today: I’m working independently as a Project Planning and Control Manager without a supporting Planner. That, to me, is an incredible feat. Everything I developed for the COO—JD, KRA, KPI Target—(https://lnkd.in/dsbgFim7), and it is evident in the opportunity coming up. I’m combining two different companies' JDs to be better at my current role. It’s the same strategy of combining Kim Heldman and Rita Mulcahy PMP Prep, and everything I have achieved in the past is a combination of two major knowledge bases to mastery. I just flip the switch with the use of AI prompting skills to provide that for the COO, who is my superior, whom I have huge respect for, and whom I hope to be like sometime in the future, this time for an Oil and Gas EPC Company. I don’t know what God plans for me, but I’m open to His perfect will. I wake up with so much gratitude for the almighty, my friends, family, colleagues, and people who support me. If it were left to some people, they would wish I were in a worse situation, but I’m not. #Gratitude #Success #AI #ProjectManagement #CareerGrowth #Blessed #SupportSystem #OilAndGas #EPC #GeorgeNwogu Art\n\n2\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dCHExYBH Below are the prerequisites and information which I mentioned to prepare and plan yourself to decide if anyone is interested to work in the Middle East. 1) Need to know the current overview regarding the Saudi Arabia work environment. 2) Saudi Arabia is an open county that welcomes especially new technology in order to boost their Vision 2030 3) Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 to diversify from focusing on oil and gas only to become the biggest project such as Neom. 4) Some certain positions which needs to be fill up by the locals. 5) Apply jobs via manpower agents such as Thinkplus and ASM Proventures etc.. 6) Need to have at least 7-15 years’ work experience. 7) Specialized in certain job is an advantage 8) No tax 9) If come along with family need to pay 4.8 k per person for dependent fees. 10) Depends on how you can showcase your value ie showcase past project, experience, skills, software used, achievement 11) Tailor with job description and the department scope of work 12) Understand the cultures 13) Prepare documentations to be attested\n\n3\n\nHow to grow your Contracting business. with Risk Management.
