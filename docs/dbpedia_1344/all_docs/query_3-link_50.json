The agreement provides for Polenergia’s right to acquire the remaining 40% of the shares of Naxxar Wind Farm Four SRL during the period between 1 July and 31 December 2024.\n\n“This transaction represents one of the most complex projects on the renewable energy market in recent years, both in terms of size and impact on the dynamics of this sector. At Mușat & Asociații we have found a team with outstanding expertise in energy and related M&A transactions, made up of lawyers who have demonstrated their ability to manage strategic, long-term projects. I would like to thank Mușat & Asociații for the partnership in this project and for the fact that they have so effectively combined the advice regarding the regulatory aspects with the achievement of our business objectives”, said Gerhard Kaiser, CEO of Naxxar Renewable Energy.\n\n“Congratulations to the Naxxar team and their new strategic partner – Polenergia, on entering this new phase of development! We thank the entire Naxxar team and especially Mr. Gerhard Kaiser for their trust and successful collaboration both in this transaction and in the other projects the company is developing in the renewable energy sector.
