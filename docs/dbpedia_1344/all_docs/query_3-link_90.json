It seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supplying clean renewable energy to the Romanian National Power Grid (RNPG), thus replacing an equivalent amount of electricity otherwise generated largely by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to the RNPG. Electricity production is expected to reach about 87323 MWh/yr. The project consists in the installation of 20 x 2.1 MW wind turbines in two clusters Babadag 1 and Babadag 2 for electricity production, based on favorable wind conditions available in the area. The project site is located near Babadag city, Constanta County. By replacing fossil fuel based power generation in the RNPG, approximately 71427 tCO2eq will be reduced annually. As per the Kyoto Protocol provisions, the crediting period of the project is January 1st, 2011 – December 31st, 2012."
