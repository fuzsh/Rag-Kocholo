It consists of three V90 turbines being built and installed\n\nby Vestas, the Danish manufacturer of wind turbines.\n\nEach wind turbine is 150 metres\n\nhigh and has a power of 2 megawatts.\n\nOnce fully operative, the plant\n\nwill produce 21,000mw of power a year – enough for the energy\n\nrequirements of 5,000 families. It will allow the curbing of 14,500\n\ntonnes of CO2 emissions a year.\n\nThe deal is a 15 years full pay-out\n\nlease. It has been arranged by UniCredit Leasing’s competence\n\ncentre in renewable energy, run by Martin Mayr, and UniCredit\n\nLeasing Romania’s corporate customers’ team, managed by Gabriel\n\nMihai."
