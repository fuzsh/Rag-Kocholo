        "text": "Background Wind energy farms have become a popular solution to produce green energy worldwide. Their development within protected areas has increased dramatically in the past decade, and the effects on the rare, endemic and threatened plant species (i.e., protected plant species), essential for habitat conservation and management, are little known. Only a few studies directly quantify the impacts of wind energy farms on them. Our study analyzes the impact of wind energy farms on rare, endemic, and threatened plant species in steppic habitats and their recovery potential over a ten-year period on a wind energy farm within the Dealurile Agighiolului Natura 2000 site (Dobrogea Region, SE Romania). Methods We surveyed the rare, endemic, and threatened plant species within a radius of approximately 50 m around each of the 17 wind towers during the wind farm operational phase. We selected 34 plots to allow the investigation of two types of areas: (1) a disturbed area overlapping the techn...\n\nThe Romanian legislation nominates for variosus conservative statuses the following terrestrial or freshwater tetrapode species which should be included in the analyses of teh studies on the potential negative impact of wind-turbines and related infrastructures or activities: 11 species of amphibians, 16 species of reptiles, 273 species of birds and 38 species of mammals that have “strictly protected species” status (according to Act No. 13 / 1993, which enforces the Bern Convention on conservation of wildlife); 7 species of amphibians, 5 species of reptiles, 94 species of birds and 31 species of mammals that have “protected species” status (according to the same Act No. 13 / 1993); 6 species of amphibians, 5 species of reptiles, 54 species of mammals of which protection needs designaton of Special Areas of Conservation (Governmental Urgency Ordinance No. 57 / 2007); 11 species of amphibians, 18 species of reptiles, 48 species of mammals having “Species of Community Interest that need strict protection” status (Governmental Urgency Ordinance No. 57 / 2007); 6 species of amphibians, 5 species of reptiles, 67 species of birds and 6 species of mammals that have “Species of National Interest that need strict protection” status (Governmental Urgency Ordinance No. 57 / 2007). At least 122 species of birds are nominated among the species of which protection needs designaton of Special Protection Areas (Governmental Urgency Ordinance No. 57 / 2007), 112 migratory waterbird species are protected by Act No. 89 / 2000, 20 migratory birds are considered as being treathened on European level (Act no. 13 / 1998) and 267 species have “unfavourable status on European level” (Act no. 13 / 1998). All 30 bat species are protected by Act No. 90 / 2000, and 25 species are also nominated in Act No. 13 / 1993 (that enforces the Bonn Convention on migratory species).\n\nIn Dobrogea, a core area for wind energy exploitation in Romania, existing knowledge regarding the intensity and pattern of bird migration is limited. In the absence of enumerated data, wind farms may be constructed in areas where large aggregations of migrants pass. In this study we recorded the intensity of the autumn migration of soaring birds in three locations within the Măcin Mountains, where wind farms are planned to be built. The locations chosen were at Văcăreni, Greci and Cerna villages. Furthermore we categorized all migrating individuals as threatened or non-threatened by the planned wind farms, based on their migration routes and height at local scale. At Văcăreni 4.716 individuals were counted, 3.394 raptors and 1.322 non-raptors, at Greci 2.387 individuals, 2.064 raptors and 323 non-raptors, and finally at Cerna, 5.268 individuals, 4.529 raptors and 739 non-raptors. At all three sites a significant proportion of birds, both raptors and non-raptors, were found to be th...\n\nThe landscape and biodiversity of the Sighişoara-Târnava Mare potential Site of community interest (pSci), in southern Transylvania, comprise a remarkable fragment of an older europe, where species-rich plant and animal communities thrive alongside traditional farming and land use. The wildlower meadows are probably the best that survive in lowland europe. The area contains arange of eU Habitats directive annex i habitats and annex ii species, and is a clear demonstration of the biodiversity importance of semi-natural landscapes. This landscape has not been created by landscape architects or nature conservationists but by farmers, by centuries of traditional management. only continued traditionbased management can preserve this unique area. in 2005 Funda ia adePT began an integrated project of biodiversity conservation, agri-environment and rural development, to provide economic incentives for local farming communities. This project is supported by government sector (including the uk government's darwin initiative), nGo sector and corporate sector (orange romania). The project area is about 85,000 ha, with a population of about 25,000 people, 90% of whom are smallscale farmers. This paper is one of the many scientiic communications obtained derived from this unusual project, in which public and private sector support is coming together to meet conservation and rural development objectives."
