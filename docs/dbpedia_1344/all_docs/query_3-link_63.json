It asked for the Competition Councilâ€™s approval in early December.\n\nPremier Energy PLC directly and indirectly owns stakes in various companies in Romania and the Republic of Moldova.\n\nIn Romania, Premier Energy PLC owns the companies Premier Energy (Romania), Ligatne Gas, BERG Sistem Gaz and Premier Energy Trading. The company operates a 2,500-kilometer network of gas pipelines locally, with a growth rate of about 200 kilometres per year in recent years.\n\nSince it was set up nine years ago, the company has carried out specific asset management activities specific to producers of electricity from renewable sources.\n\nSince 2016, after obtaining the electricity supply license, Alive Capital has participated in the centralized electricity markets. Since 2019 it has been licensed by market regulator ANRE as a natural gas supplier. Since the beginning of 2021, it has a commercial exploitation license to produce electricity from photovoltaic sources.\n\n(Photo: Pixabay)\n\nandrei@romania-insider.com"
