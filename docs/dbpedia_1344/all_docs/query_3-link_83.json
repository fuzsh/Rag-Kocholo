As a result of these transactions, we have a good and up-to-date understanding, from a legal and commercial perspective, of how complex projects are structured, financed and implemented.\n\nOur projects practice has won an enviable reputation in recent years for its work in financing and for advising on corporate and regulatory matters.\n\nWe have been involved in all stages of project development, from tendering through to refinancing and disposal. In the process we have gained a thorough understanding of the unique challenges commercial organisations face and of the innovative solutions developed to address them."
