        "text": "Siemens Gamesa is leading the way for a sustainable future with the RecyclableBlade, the first product to offer a comprehensive recyclable solution that is ready for commercial use both offshore and onshore.\n\nThe wind industry is still relatively young and is aware of the responsibility it holds of finding a sustainable way to deal with wind turbine components at the end of their life cycle. Increasing the recyclability of the wind components is high on our agenda, and we are committed to producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.\n\nThis decade will be judged on our ability to take the steps needed to keep global temperature rises this century to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius, as well as deliver a fairer and more equal world. That is why as part of our Sustainability Vision 2040, we are focused not just on the targets we set, but instead on the actions that are needed to deliver on them.\n\nServices\n\nSpares and repairs for wind turbines\n\nSiemens Gamesa has the global scale and operational experience to support you wherever you need us, and a comprehensive portfolio of spares (new and refurbished), repairs, reconditioning services as well as advance main component exchange processes â€“ all built on the highest safety and quality standards. A repairs expert you can rely on to deliver a solution long before it might become necessary. Get the most out of your turbines, all the time."
