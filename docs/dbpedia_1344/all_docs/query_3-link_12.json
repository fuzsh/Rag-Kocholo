        "text": "Lukerg Renew, a joint venture between ERG Renew and Lukoil-Ecoenergo, has commissioned the 82MW Topolog-Dorobantu wind farm project in Tulcea, Romania.\n\nHaving connected to the national grid in November 2013, the project featuring 41 Vestas V90 2 MW wind turbines is currently undergoing turbine testing activities.\n\nFollowing the completion of the last turbine in December 2013, another 2MW will be added to the project, which is claimed to be one of the largest wind farms in Romania.\n\nIn April 2013, Vestas was awarded an order for the supply, installation and commissioning of the V90-2.0 MW wind turbines for the project in Tulcea County, along with a VestasOnline Business Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) solution.\n\n\"The project will generate more than 200GWh per year.\"\n\nVestas claims that its VestasOnline Business tool is suitable for larger wind farms that require advanced reporting, higher redundancy or advanced control and monitoring functionality. It allows the developers to communicate with third party service providers to support their power forecasting and trading.\n\nOnce operational, the project will generate more than 200GWh per year, which is enough electricity to power cover the residential electricity consumption of more than 60,000 Romanian households, and curb around 110,000t of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe project completion has significantly enhanced the companyâ€™s presence with a total installed capacity of 150MW in the Romanian wind market and will also contribute to the country meeting its targets as stipulated in its national renewable energy action plan."
