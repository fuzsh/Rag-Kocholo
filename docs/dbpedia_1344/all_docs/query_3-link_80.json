        "text": "Happy to share with you a new #milestone for Parapet: together with our partner from Blue Line Energy, we completed the construction of a 1.1 MW #photovoltaic power plant, installed inside the BeÅŸtepe wind park, Tulcea County. It is the first #hybrid project to produce #energy from #renewable sources in the country, according to data from the national electricity transmission company in Romania. ðŸ‘‰ The total installed capacity of the hybrid plant currently amounts to 7.25 MW, with an investment of approximately EUR 10 million. ðŸ‘‰ The photovoltaic power plant project involved the implementation of Parapet mechanical infrastructure solutions by placing 2,652 photovoltaic panels in the vicinity of the 3 wind turbines installed in the BeÅŸtepe Park, functional since 2014. ðŸ‘‰ The installed system ensures a total annual power generation of 24 GW, contributing to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 20.400 tons/year. Andrada Prodan Moldovan, CEO Parapet: â€œThe project of the hybrid solar and wind park in BeÅŸtepe, Tulcea County, is a pioneering one that meets Romania's ambitious targets of decarbonization and of ensuring sustainable sources of electricity production. Thanks to hybridization, the installed capacity leads to less variation in energy production, better use of transmission and distribution systems, thus maintaining grid stability. We welcome the partnership with Blue Line Energy, and we count on expanding such projects for a sustainable energy transition\". Many thanks to Alexandru Ciglenean and to the Parapet #team involved in the project! #photovoltaic #constructionindustry #energytransition #hybridpowerplant"
