        "text": "36 V90-2.0 MW turbines for the Topolog Dorobantu wind power plant\n\nVestas has received a firm and unconditional order for 72 MW (with an option for another 12 MW) for Romania. The 36-turbine order constitutes the first part of a project consisting of a total of 42 V90-2.0 MW wind turbines to be installed in Tulcea County in Romania. Delivery of the first 36 turbines is planned for the second half of 2013.\n\nThe order has been placed by LUKERG Renew, a joint venture between ERG Renew and LUKOIL. ERG Renew is Italy’s largest wind energy producer, with an installed capacity of 1,232 MW throughout Europe. LUKOIL is a major international vertically-integrated oil and gas company, accounting for 2.2 per cent of global output of crude oil.\n\nThe Topolog project is one of the largest projects in Romania and represents a step forward in the development of Vestas’ relationship with one of the key players in wind energy in Europe.\n\nThe contract includes supply, installation and commissioning of the turbines, along with a VestasOnline® Business SCADA solution.\n\n“We are pleased to receive the Topolog order from LUKERG Renew. This wind energy project marks another important milestone in further developing the promising Romanian wind market, and we are happy to support our customer’s business case with our 30 years of wind energy experience and state-of-the-art wind energy solutions,” says Thomas Richterich, President of Vestas Central Europe.\n\n“The Topolog order will contribute to Romania meeting its ambitious targets as detailed in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan. Furthermore, with this order Vestas reinforces its position in the Romanian market as a leading player with the strongest local presence and the largest operational fleet. This is Vestas’ first project with LUKERG Renew in Romania and it shows their confidence in Vestas’ capabilities to handle large projects in an important emerging market for renewable energy,” says Catalina Dragomir, Managing Director of Vestas CEU Romania.\n\n“This project confirms that Romania has become a leading wind energy market in the region. Vestas looks forward to Romanian authorities promptly clarifying the future policy framework. Such a framework should allow managing short-term electricity price concerns while preserving the feasibility of investments, such as this project,” says Juan Araluce, Chief Sales Officer of Vestas Wind Systems A/S.\n\nThe complete Topolog wind power plant will produce more than 200 GWh per year, which corresponds to an annual saving of almost 110,000 tons of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it will provide enough electricity to cover the residential electricity consumption of more than 60,000 Romanian households."
