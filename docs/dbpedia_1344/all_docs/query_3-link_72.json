        "text": "Polenergia has entered into a conditional agreement to purchase a 60% stake in Naxxar Renewable Energy Management Holding, a company actively involved in the development of one of the largest wind farms in this region of Europe.\n\nNaxxar‚Äôs onshore project boasts a total capacity of up to 685.6 megawatts and meets the necessary technical requirements for grid connectivity, according to Polenergia.\n\nRomania, as the second-largest economy in Central and Eastern Europe and one of the fastest-growing economies on the European continent, holds a prominent position. Furthermore, Polenergia noted that the Romanian energy market ranks as the third largest in the Central and Eastern European region.\n\nDominika Kulczyk, Chairwoman of the supervisory board of Polenergia, said ‚ÄúThis is a completely new stage in the development of Polenergia and another great step in the implementation of our very dynamic growth strategy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOn the one hand, we are constantly and very quickly expanding our product and service portfolio.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOn the other hand, today not only do we produce energy, but also we have started delivering it to the end customer. Now it‚Äôs time for the third direction ‚Äì going beyond Poland.‚Äù\n\nThe outcome of an agreement struck between Polenergia and Naxxar Renewable Energy Management Holding entails the potential acquisition of 60% of Naxxar Wind Farm Four Srl (referred to as NWF 4).\n\nNWF 4 holds stakes in seven specialized entities that are collaboratively engaged in the development of a project known as N4, which has specific technical requirements for connecting to the power grid.\n\nN4 envisions the construction of wind farms with a combined capacity of up to 685.6 MW, situated in the Tulcea County within the Dobrogea region along the Black Sea. This region is renowned for its strong winds, boasting average wind speeds that surpass 8 meters per second.\n\nWho are InfraBe?\n\nWe are a leading global infrastructure and renewables search & recruitment business.
