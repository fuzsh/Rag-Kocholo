        "text": "UniCredit Leasing is to finance an €8 million\n\nwind power plant in Romania as part of its expansion strategy in\n\nrenewable energy business across Eastern Europe.\n\nThe project involves the financing a wind farm\n\nin the Tulcea county in eastern Romania for Energy Rose, a wind\n\nenergy group active across Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. It\n\nconsists of three V90 turbines being built and installed by Vestas,\n\nthe Danish manufacturer of wind turbines.\n\nEach wind turbine is 150 meters high and has a\n\npower of 2 MW. Once fully operative, the plant will produce 21,000\n\nMW of power a year – enough for the energy requirements of 5,000\n\nfamilies. It will allow the curbing of 14,500 tonnes of CO2\n\nemissions a year.\n\nThe deal is a 15 years full pay-out lease. It\n\nhas been arranged by UniCredit Leasing’s competence centre in\n\nrenewable energy, run by Martin Mayr, and UniCredit Leasing\n\nRomania’s corporate customers’ team, managed by Gabriel Mihai.\n\nMayr said: “Last year, we financed wind\n\nprojects amounting to €150 million, especially in Austria, Romania,\n\nBulgaria and Turkey. We expect that in these countries in 2011\n\nthere will be a strong development of wind projects, owing to the\n\nfavourable natural conditions and to the energy policy adopted by\n\nlocal governments.”\n\nOther recent deals in wind energy have\n\nincluded a wind park in Kavarna, Bulgaria, for €14 million and the\n\nlargest ever built wind park in Turkey. The total investment in the\n\nproject was 84 million, of which UniCredit’s Turkish subsidiary\n\nYapy Kredi Leasing financed €64 million."
