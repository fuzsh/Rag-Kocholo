        "text": "Hydropeaking is due to the intermittent operation of peak hydropower plants and leads to various and complex problems downstream. A solution to solve part of them is to provide the development scheme with a retention basin downstream the hydropower plant (HPP). The water used intermittently during the day / week to produce electricity at peak load, which leads to sudden variation of flows into the riverbed will be regulated in this reservoir. Irrespective of the program that the HPP has during the day, the retention basin gathers the water and evacuates it downstream as much as possible constantly during the day or, at least, attenuates the sudden variation, increase or decrease, of levels downstream. Thus, the maximum flows evacuated by the HPP can be dramatically reduced as well as the flow fluctuations and the river levels accordingly. If the flow downstream the retention basin is almost constant during the day and it is released through a small hydropower plant, the positive eff...\n\nArchaeological beaver (Castor fiber) remains from Romanian sites dating from the Mesolithic to the Middle Ages are described in terms of their frequencies (based on the number of identified specimens), morphology and size. A summary of previous archaeozoological studies in the geographical and historical regionalization of the Romanian territory (i.e. Banat, Dobrudja, Moldavia, Muntenia, Oltenia and Transylvania) shows that temporal and regional variation characterizes the assemblages. The data also reveal that beaver hunting contributed little to local economies, although some spatial and temporal variations are apparent and are here compared with the evidence from the historical record. In addition, univariate, bivariate and geometric morphometric analyses are employed to examine different anatomical elements. Studies of the lower third molar (M3) reveal that there is a statistically significant intraspecific variability between the Neolithic and Iron Age populations, situated also in different regions, Muntenia and Moldavia, respectively."
