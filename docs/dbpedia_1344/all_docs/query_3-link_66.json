        "text": "A park where you can’t really go to see anything spectacular other than a huge wind farm and some arid area, but a place where you can set free some of your memories and thoughts and realize how tiny you are for the world.\n\nAnd the Wind Farm from Dobrogea represents one of those times when you take a break from everything you do and from the rush of reaching the next touristic attraction just to stop in the middle of nowhere and appreciate more of what you have. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but now.\n\nI have no idea how often people meet this kind of wind farms in their countries or if I am the single weirdo here staring at the huge airscrews, but the right place where you can find this kind of things, in my country, is close to the Black Sea. And living on a few hundreds of km away from this part of the country, I have to admit that I am not used to meet such wind turbines during my journeys.\n\nDobrogea Wind Farm is one of those places where you won’t find any other tourists or too many cars crossing by because it’s just you, a long road which you never know where it will bring you, and the silence and wind created by the airscrews which turns out to be the deep breath of air you’ve crawled for in a hot day of summer located on an arid area with no trees or shadows where you can hide from the burning sunbeams.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that we can turn into some greedy bastards which are allowed to destroy or sell the historical monuments and areas of great importance for the money’s sake or to flood entire villages and see people’s houses get lost under the water and make human sacrifice, just how many locations were formed during the communism. Because that’s not right. Not what happened then and not even what happens now.\n\nBut if we don’t know how to contribute on making the world a better place, then, at least, let’s appreciate it as it currently is and not make a team with those who are ruining it a little more with every single minute which passes away.\n\nAs I previously mentioned the huge airscrews can be met anywhere on the way to the Black Sea. The closer you get to it, the more you’ll meet them.\n\nBut the place where they are more often is in the village known as Fântânele from Constanta County which is also famous as having the largest onshore wind farm from Romania and Europe with a capacity of 600 MW for 240 wind turbines, from which only 139 are located in Fântânele, while the rest of 101 wind turbines can be found in Cogealac which is a tiny village situated just 6 km away.\n\nThe huge wind turbines are located on 100 m height and measure a diameter of 99 m covering a total surface of 1,100 hectares which brought them the title of the largest wind farm from Europe, surpassing the 539 MW Whitelee Wind Farm from Scotland, United Kingdom and producing 10% of the total green energy in Romania that helps to supply 540,000 homes daily.\n\nThe Wind Farm from Dobrogea is located in the villages Fântânele and Cogealac from Constanta County, and they are situated in the north side of the county on just 17 km away west from the shore of the Black Sea.\n\nConstanta is also the county of Romania which occupies the first place in terms of renewable energy projects owning 80% of the nationwide production of wind.\n\nAll rights reserved."
