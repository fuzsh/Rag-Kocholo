        "text": "Investigating the Authenticity and Attributions of works of art believed to be by;\n\nAlfred Joseph Casson O.S.A P.R.C.A\n\nA J Casson\n\n(1898 - 1992)\n\nCanadian Painter and Printmaker\n\nA J Casson played an exceptionally important role in the development of Canadian art as a landscape painter and became the youngest member of the Group of Seven in 1926 at the age of 28 at the invitation of Franklin Carmichael. The famous group were Canadian artists who believed that art could be developed through direct exposure to nature, en plein air and Casson is best known for his depictions of landscapes, forests and the farms of southern Ontario. He was also a fine printmaker and created extremely good serigraphs which have become very collectible themselves and as you would expect, are being forged by modern duplication as their values increase.\n\nCasson's works are clearly in demand, very collectible, thus valuable and quite rare. So it's important to reflect on the fact that long lost paintings or those recently discovered, that were actually painted by Casson are going to be few and far between. Though it's not impossible for them to appear.\n\nMore common however are works that are attributed to an artists hand, those anonymously contributed from within his circle, or those created by an artists followers. Artists who themselves are simply working in their style and with this brings a risk. You must ask, is the attribution and description reliable and sound?\n\nIt is always important to be able to distinguish between those works actually executed by an artist such as A J Casson, compared to those either 'claiming' to be by him, or rather that we are told are by him, as there are differing kinds of attribution;\n\nThe well constructed, thoroughly academically researched and scholarly attribution. The poorly informed, which are mainly guesses and the deliberate attempts of deception or forgery.\n\nThis unfortunately is fairly common and includes the adding of signatures, monograms or inscriptions to otherwise anonymous works of art effected in a generally similar manner to a particular artist and clearly devised to impress a potential, gullible purchaser. This is the most common form of art fraud we see.\n\nBut as his values are high, there are the excellent attempts at mimicking an artists hand by directly forging new variants of their works. These are usually executed over the top of an old pot boiler or amateur painting, bought at auction cheaply and from the artists era and cleaned off with solvents.\n\n* * *\n\nAs an international specialist fine art consultancy, with bases in Canada, but also the UK and Europe. We have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients around the world for over 45 years. In so doing, investigating both single works of art and complete collections for clients and conducting in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and inquiries, as well as full academic and forensic investigations and multilingual archival research into the origins of all old master works of art from different geographical regions and periods. We also scrutinize and research the provenance and ownership lineage for verification purposes.\n\nWe are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues of authenticity and attribution, including the works of Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson, his circle and other members of the Group of seven, or those of his followers, or any works of art that you need to learn about.\n\nSome example works of art associated with this name appear below as illustrations.\n\nNote: No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of legitimacy here. Moreover these are an across the board representational view of the differing types of works that are and may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally.\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nL'Ã©valuation de prÃ©-authentification. La evaluaciÃ³n previa a la autenticaciÃ³n\n\nWe strongly advise clients before embarking on a full investigation of legitimacy or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is wise to have an impartial preliminary assessment conducted first. One made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nThis is a professional advisory service that we provide, based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may have had formerly conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail, or:\n\nCONTACT\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND TERMINOLOGY\n\n*It is very important to clearly understand the auction terms that are commonly used in any published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear a signature' or monogram. In this case as if they were defining the creations of the Canadian artist; Alfred Joseph Casson O.S.A P.R.C.A (1898 - 1992) also sometimes defined as A J Casson.\n\nWhere the name, Alfred Joseph Casson (1898 - 1992) is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, Alfred Joseph Casson (1898 - 1992) including his dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt. It is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by the appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on the artist.\n\nWhen Alfred Joseph Casson (1898 - 1992) is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or AttribuÃ© Ã , or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it 'possibly' may be by him.\n\nBut if the term Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson (1885 â 1970) - circle of, entourage, or “Circle of Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson ” is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil or student.\n\nWhen the name is given thus; Painted in the “Style of Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson ” or “Follower of Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist’s way, their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nIf the phrase in the “Manner Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson is used or is defined….” then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nWhen the term “After….Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson \"; is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nSigned - Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson ; “Dated….” or “Inscribed Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson ” Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nWhen the term 'Bears signature', is used or the name, Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson is specified followed by the words; \"With signature ….”, or “With date ….” or “With inscription….” or “Bears signature of Alfred Joseph Casson or A J Casson /date/or inscription” Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, forged or has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
