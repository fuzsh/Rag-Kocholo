        "text": "Description\n\nReviews\n\nDescription\n\nIn Everyday Life in Ancient Rome, Lionel Casson offers a lively introduction to the society of the times. Instead of following the standard procedure of social history, he presents a series of vignettes focusing on the \"ways of life\" of various members of that society, from the slave to the emperor. The book opens with a description of the historical context and includes examination of topics such as the family, religion, urban and rural life, and leisure activities. This revised edition of Casson's engaging work, originally published in 1975 as Daily Life in Ancient Rome, includes two new chapters as well as full documentation of the sources.\n\nAn evocative study of the average Roman: when he got up, when he ate, how he earned a living and why a career in the army was greatly sought after, in spite of the dangers. -- Time Traveler's Guide to the Roman Empire, Channel4.com\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLionel Casson is professor emeritus of classics at New York University and has written many books about life in the ancient world, including Travel in the Ancient World,, and Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World, both available from Johns Hopkins.\n\nReviews\n\nA series of concise sketches of key phases of life in the Roman world during its greatest period, the era of peace and prosperity in the first and second centuries A.D. Of Ages Past Magazine I was reading one of Casson's books [ Everyday Life in Ancient Rome] while waiting for [my daughter]... She was late, which would ordinarily have thrown me into a fever of apprehension, but on this occasion I was so wrapped up in the book, I didn't notice. In fact, when she did come back, quite late, I was annoyed because she had interrupted me before I had finished the book. I told Casson this, and he was infinitely pleased. -- Isaac Asimov I. Asimov: A Memoir\n\nBook Information\n\nISBN 9780801859922\n\nAuthor Lionel Casson\n\nFormat Paperback\n\nPage Count 184\n\nImprint Johns Hopkins University Press\n\nPublisher Johns Hopkins University Press\n\nWeight(grams) 227g\n\nDimensions(mm) 216mm * 140mm * 11mm\n\nReviews\n\nNo reviews yet Write a Review"
