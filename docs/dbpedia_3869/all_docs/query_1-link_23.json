Marine archaeology has provided a ceaseless flow of invaluable firsthand information about ships and their cargoes, even about their crews; new pictorial evidence of ranking importance has come to light; and authoritative new studies of various aspects of maritime history have been published. As a result, this book represents an overall exhaustive revision. Some sections are entirely new, many have been radically revised, and there is hardly a page that has not been altered in some way. The illustrations have been increased to include important discoveries of the past three decades (I am grateful to George Bass, Michael Katzev, and John Coates, who kindly supplied photographs). And the maps have been refashioned, by Paul J. Pugliese, to provide more detail. The original edition supplied documentation for citations in the text and a selected bibliography for each chapter. To enhance the usefulness of the book for scholars, these have been replaced by a section (Notes) that furnishes comprehensive documentation keyed to the text by page numbers.\n\nPREFACE\n\nT H E STORY of what the ancients accomplished on the sea has never been put between the covers of one book. A few episodes have been dealt with so often, in handbooks and histories, that they are as familiar as Caesar's assassination. But once off these well-trodden paths, searchers for information are forced to make their way through a miscellany of scholarly publications, more often than not articles in obscure journals, in a variety of languages; and they will find that there are some topics that have never been treated at all. The present book is an attempt to fill this lack. I have tried to sketch, in a continuous narrative, the impressive record of the ancient mariner: how he perfected his trading vessels until from little more than rowboats they grew into huge freighters whose size was not to be matched until the eighteenth century of our era; how he perfected his fighting ships until from little more than oared transports they grew into mighty and complex rowing machines capable of carrying over a hundred marines, even of mounting artillery; how his maritime commerce progressed from timid coastal voyaging to an integrated network that stretched from Spain to Malay; how much that is popularly believed of him to his detriment—that he manned his galleys with slaves, that he could not sail against the wind, and so on—is utterly wrong. Probably this story could not have been properly told until now. Up to a half-century or so ago we had only the writings of ancient authors to supply information. Today we can draw on the findings of hundreds of archaeological investigations; these have laid bare maritime civilizations hitherto unknown, yielded an infinite variety of objects of trade, and even turned up priceless written documents, from the official records of the Athens Naval Base written on imperishable stone to a tattered fragment of a maritime contract between some obscure businessmen on fragile papyrus. Moreover, in the last decade, the new science of underwater archaeology has enabled us to explore the actual remains of ancient wrecks. There are still gaps in our knowledge, but far fewer than there were fifty years ago. The Ancient Mariners is addressed first and foremost to the general reader. Yet, since there is no other book in any language that covers the field, I have tried to straddle the fence and make it useful for scholars as well. . . .\n\nxviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nMany people helped me in many ways with this book; I have space to acknowledge only my most important debts. A fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, by providing a precious opportunity to travel abroad for over a year, enabled me to investigate the sites of scores of ancient Mediterranean harbors, to search obscure corners of museums and come upon evidence that I would otherwise never have known of, and to use the unique facilities of half a dozen European libraries. I took particular pains to secure apt and clear illustrations; a number of institutions and individuals were of great assistance and their help is acknowledged at appropriate points in the list of plates. I must mention in particular Ernest Nash of the Fototeca Unione in Rome; I owe much to his eager and fruitful cooperation and to the splendid resources of the archive he heads. A number of the chapters have benefited from the remarks of my good friends, Professor Saul Weinberg and Professor Naphtali Lewis. Chapter 3 owes much to the generous cooperation of Fernand Benoit, director of the Museum of Archaeology at Marseilles. But far and away my greatest debt is the one I owe my father. He passed a careful and critical eye over the language and phrasing of every sentence in the manuscript; as a result, there is hardly a page in the book that has not profited from his comments and suggestions.\n\nThe Ancient Mariners\n\nChapter 1\n\nDOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS\n\nIN THE VERY beginning men went down, not to the sea but to quiet waters, and not in ships but in anything that would float: logs that could be straddled, rafts of wood or of bundles of reeds, perhaps even inflated skins. But these were floats, not boats. The first true boat—something that would carry people upon water and at the same time keep them dry— was very likely the dugout, although experiments with bound reeds or with skins stretched over light frames must have taken place quite early too. And, when the desire or need arose for something bigger than what could be hollowed out of the largest logs available, the boat made of planks came into being. This was one of prehistoric man's most outstanding achievements; the credit for it probably goes to the Egyptians of the fourth millennium B.C. As long as they stayed in shallow waters, men could propel their boats with punting poles. Farther out they used their hands—and this led them to devise the paddle, a wooden hand, as it were, and soon afterward the oar. They made impressive trips with these limited means of propulsion: as early as the eleventh millennium B.C. they were crossing from the mainland of Greece to the island of Melos to bring back the distinctive obsidian which is found only there; no doubt they hopped from island to island, but even so the voyage involved at least fifteen miles over the open sea. Then they hit upon something that revolutionized travel over the water: they learned how to use the wind. For the first time they harnessed a force other than their own muscles, their servants', or their wives'. It was a discovery whose effects reached down the ages: from this moment on, the easiest and cheapest way of transporting bulky loads over distances of any appreciable length was by water. This is the point at which the story of the ancient mariners really starts; the scene is again Egypt, or perhaps Mesopotamia. In southern Egypt archaeologists have found a multitude of pictures of boats that, shortly before 3100 B.C., were drawn helter-skelter on rock outcrops or were included as part of the decoration on pottery. Among them are some that show, stepped amidships or forward of amidships, a mast with a broad squaresail hung upon it (PI. 1).\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nNo representations of sails discovered elsewhere come near to being as old as these. In Mesopotamia, a land where civilization began as early as in Egypt or even earlier, excavators digging in levels dating from about 3400 B.C. found a little clay model representing, to judge from its shape, what was probably a boat made of skins (PL 2). In the center of the floor, somewhat forward of amidships, is a sturdy round socket, and the hull at gunwale level is pierced by three holes. It is tempting to explain the socket as intended for a mast and the holes for a stay and shrouds, but, against this must be weighed the fact that sails are not otherwise attested in Mesopotamia until very much later. Perhaps the socket held a ceremonial pole and the holes were for cords by which the model was suspended. Who first realized the potentialities of the sailing ship and dared to use it to strike out far beyond their own shores? For the age that predates history there is nothing to go on beyond what the archaeologists dig up, but this in most cases is ambiguous: save when islands are involved, you cannot be sure whether a prehistoric object of one country that turns up in another got there by land or sea. Yet, in the light of what follows (Chapter 2), it seems most likely that the first true sea voyages were made by Egyptians who worked northward along the coasts of Palestine and Syria or southward down the Red Sea, and by Mesopotamians and Indians who sailed between the Persian Gulf and the northwestern coast of India. Egypt and Mesopotamia, then, had a head start over the rest of the world in the art of sailing as in so much else. But, as time passed, all along the coasts of the Mediterranean men started to go down to the sea. In the prehistoric age and long thereafter, these shores did not have the bare aspect they show today but in many places were mantled by forests that provided logs for the earliest dugouts and timber for the keels, ribs, and planks of their more complicated progeny. How far did these primitive Mediterranean mariners sail? Did they by and large stick to their own shores or did they venture on long voyages? That their ships were probably quite frail need not have stopped them; Polynesian sailors covered impressive distances in boats that were very likely no more seaworthy. For long some archaeologists were convinced that certain beads and goldwork found in Britain came from Egypt and that a picture of a dagger carved in the rock of Stonehenge represented a type used in Greece about the middle of the second millennium B.C.; all this, they concluded, pointed to a trade route that led from the Mediterranean into far northern waters. Still others argued that doughty mariners of the age ventured to the northwestern coasts of Spain or even to Cornwall to bring back tin,\n\nDOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS\n\nthat essential ingredient for the making of bronze, from the rich deposits there. But subsequent studies showed that all such claims are without solid foundation. So far as we know, the prehistoric sailors of the Mediterranean stayed by and large within the limits of their great inland sea.\n\nChapter 2\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n\"BRINGING OF FORTY SHIPS filled with cedar logs.\" So wrote an ancient scribe in listing the accomplishments of Pharaoh Snefru, ruler of Egypt about 2600 B.C. This handful of words brings us across the threshold into the period of history proper. The dim tracks of potsherds and other like objects are still important—giving them up is a luxury that the student of the history of shipping cannot afford at any stage in the ancient period—but now there exists, for the first time, the strong light of written words to serve as a guide. As in the case of so many phases of civilization, the record begins in Egypt. Very little wood grows in the valley of the Nile. Cedar most certainly does not, and to get it Snefru had to look overseas. So he sent to Phoenicia where there was a famous stand on the mountain slopes of Lebanon. Snefru was blazing no trail, for Egypt had been in touch with this area even before his time. Archaeologists have found in the tombs of pharaohs and nobles of earlier dynasties jars and flasks and pitchers that were made in Palestine and Syria, and they have dug up in the latter countries objects that unquestionably came out of Egyptian workshops. Were these carried overland or by boat? Before the time of Snefru there is no way of telling. But the words of his scribe remove all doubt: some three thousand years before the birth of Christ a fleet of forty vessels slipped their moorings, sailed out of a Phoenician harbor, and shaped a course for Egypt to bring there a shipment of Lebanese cedar. It is the world's first articulate record of large-scale overseas commerce. On the coast, not far north of where Beirut stands today, was the port of Byblos whose beginnings go back beyond recorded memory. It was here that, among other things, the timber of Lebanon in Snefru's day and for centuries thereafter was brought to be loaded for shipment, and copper from the rich deposits in Cyprus was ferried in for transshipment. So constant was the trade between this city and Egypt that from earliest times seagoing merchantmen were called \"Byblosships\" whether they actually plied between there and Egypt or not, just as in the nineteenth century \"China clippers\" and \"East Indiamen\" were used on runs other than those they were named for. Hundreds of years later, when Egypt's power had diminished and it could no longer maintain its overseas contacts, it felt the loss of this commerce keenly. \"No one really sails north to Byblos,\" wailed one sage\n\nTHE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\n\nDem;\n\nME&ITEK&A'NEAN -SEA\n\nEGYPT Memphis!\n\nSINAI\n\nNEGEB\n\nSYRIA\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nsome four or five centuries after Snefru's time. \"What shall we do for cedar for our mummies, those trees with whose produce our priests were buried and with whose oil nobles were embalmed?\" It wasn't only the Egyptian shipwrights and carpenters who needed Lebanese timber; the undertakers depended on it too. There was another important region which figured early in overseas trade. East of the Mediterranean, and separated from it by mountains, lay Mesopotamia, the land watered by the two mighty rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Here the ancient and highly developed civilizations of the Sumerians and Babylonians arose. Cut off as they were, their Mediterranean contacts had to be made through middlemen, probably the merchants of the coast, including, no doubt, those of Byblos. But, to the south, the twin rivers that formed their chief artery of communication emptied into the Persian Gulf, and beyond that lay the open expanse of the Indian Ocean. As early as the middle of the fourth millennium B.C., Babylonian merchants were either sailing these waters themselves or dealing directly with traders who were. By the second half of the third millennium, the rulers of southern Mesopotamia, as we learn from written records found in the archaeological sites there, were importing for their statues the handsome black stone known as diorite from a place called Magan, either Oman on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, or Makran on the Iranian side, or perhaps both. Since Magan had a reputation for shipbuilding, most likely its people provided the freighters and did the carrying. From the same area came timber and, most important of all, copper. By the end of the second millennium B.C., trade in the Persian Gulf was thoroughly organized on a businesslike basis. On the island known today as Bahrein, a full-fledged port of exchange had been created. Merchants from Mesopotamia sailed there, carrying cargoes of textiles, wool, leather objects, and olive oil, and returned with their holds laden first and foremost with copper ingots but also with finished objects of copper, precious stones, ivory, and rare woods. Bahrein itself is bare; everything shipped out of it had first to be brought there. The copper poses no problem: written records reveal that it came from Magan, and there are copper deposits in both Oman and Makran, especially the latter. But the source of the ivory opens up interesting speculations. In the ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia of the third millennium B.C., excavators have unearthed certain large conchs with a snowwhite shell. These are examples of the Indian chank, which is found only in the coastal waters of India and Ceylon. They have discovered, too, beads of carnelian and of lapis lazuli; the first surely came from India and the second from Badakshan in Afghanistan by way of India.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n9\n\nThe written records tell of a land named Meluhha, which supplied not only carnelian and lapis but also timber, gold, and ivory; Meluhha must be India, for all these materials can be found there. The implication is clear: even in this early period ships loaded with trade goods shuttled over the open waters of the ocean between the Persian Gulf and the northwest coast of India. The people on this coast who took part in the trade must have been the dwellers of the Indus Valley whose impressive ruins archaeologists have uncovered at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. A great many details are known about the businessmen of Mesopotamia, for they wrote their correspondence and kept their accounts on clay tablets that are just about indestructible; excavations have yielded a multitude of them. All Mesopotamian import-export transactions were in the hands of individuals, not the state. The chief problem of the merchants, as their records show, was the same that faces their modern counterparts: where and how to get the capital to finance a voyage. Generally, a group of partners went into a venture together. They borrowed from a moneylender the cash to buy a cargo and guaranteed to repay the loan at afixedrate of interest. Except for the usual hazards of credit, the moneylender was completely protected: if the vessel went down, the partners shared the loss among themselves. But if it arrived safely, they divided all the profits; the financier received only his original advance plus interest. Occasionally a less conservative moneylender took aflyerand had himself included as one of the partners, thereby sharing in the profits—or the losses. The clay tablets have even produced what is probably the earliest letter extant from a dissatisfied customer, one that dates sometime between 2000 and 1750 B.C. Ea-nasir, a merchant of Ur in southern Mesopotamia, had delivered a consignment of copper from Dilmun, as Bahrein was then called. The consignee was outraged at the quality of the shipment. \"Who am I that you treat me in this manner and offend me?\" he writes. \"That this could happen between gentlemen as we both are! Who is there among the traders of Dilmun who has ever acted against me this way?\" For some reason this amazingly far-flung and highly developed trade died out shortly after 1750 B.C. and did not come to life again until almost a thousand years later. We must go back to Egypt to continue the record of what was happening on the sea lanes. Egypt required imports for which it had to turn to countries other than Phoenicia. It needed myrrh for unguents and embalming mummies and frankincense as well as myrrh to burn on its altars. These products come from trees that grow in only two places in the world: in southern Arabia and in parts of Ethiopia and Somalia. Egypt derived\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nits supplies from a place that the pharaohs' scribes call Punt; this probably was the belt of land that runs from the upper Nile eastward across northern Ethiopia to the Red Sea plus a strip that continued farther eastward across the northern coast of Somalia. For centuries transport was overland, taken care of by countless small traders who passed the merchandise along from hand to hand with, presumably, an increase in price at each exchange. The earliest pharaohs set themselves the job of cutting out these middlemen. In so doing they created one of the first great state-operated maritime enterprises. The task was not easy. The only alternative to the overland route was by water down the Red Sea. But Egypt's centers were all strung along the banks of her life-giving river, separated from the Red Sea at the closest point by an eight-day march across desert. On a barren coast bare of shade and roasted by an ovenlike sun the pharaohs had to set up shipyards, build a fleet, lay out harbors with all necessary facilities, and, when this was accomplished, maintain and protect what they had created. The easiest route from the Nile to the Red Sea was along a gorge in the desert called the Wadi Hammamat. On the rocks lining it at one point, Henu, minister of Pharaoh Mentuhotep III, some two thousand years before the birth of Christ inscribed an account of his services to the state. In a few bald sentences he reveals graphically the difficulties that faced the founders of such a trading venture. \"My lord sent me,\" he writes, \"to dispatch a ship to Punt to bring him back fresh myrrh. . . . I left [the Nile] with an army of 3000 men. Every day I issued to each a leathern bottle, two jars of water, 20 loaves of bread. . . . I dug twelve wells. . . . Then I reached the Red Sea, made the ship and dispatched it.\" Henu was clearly a capable man. There was nothing haphazard about his methods: notice how each step was carefully plotted, especially the key one of how to supply three thousand men with water during an eight-day trek. In his scrupulous attention to detail he even records the exact dimensions of the wells he dug. The Egypt-Punt trade was no sinecure, involving as it did carriage by river, land, and sea, and the consequent transshipping of the loads from riverboat to porter to ship and vice versa. Moreover, the sea voyage included sailing down the Red Sea and back. That body of water was tricky to navigate, had few points where a ship in danger could take shelter, and was the spawning ground of a virulent breed of pirate. (Pirates were a problem there right up to the middle of this century.) It is no surprise that it furnishes the scene for the earliest report of shipwreck that has been preserved. The story is told in the first person. The narrator is a sort of Egyptian Sinbad, for his tale is at the same time the earliest sailor's yarn that\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n11\n\nwe have; many centuries must pass before we meet a sober eyewitness's account of shipwreck. \"I had set out for the mines of the king,\" the anonymous storyteller relates, \"in a ship 180 feet long and 60 wide; we had a crew of 120, the pick of Egypt.\" The mines must be those in the Sinai Peninsula, so the departure was made from some Red Sea port. The ship's size is imposing; it was no little coaster but a full-fledged cargo vessel. \"A storm broke while we were still at sea,\" he continues; \"we flew before the wind. The ship went down; of all in it only I survived. I was cast upon an island and spent three days alone; I stayed in the shade. Then I set forth to find what I could put in my mouth. I found figs and vines, all kinds of fine leeks, fruit and cucumbers. There were fish and fowl; everything was there. I satisfied myself and there was still some left over. When I had made a fire-drill I kindled a fire and made a burnt-offering for the gods.\" So far, nothing we couldn't also find in the pages of Robinson Crusoe. But things suddenly change. \"Then I heard the sound of thunder and thought it was a wave; trees broke and the earth quaked. I uncovered my face and found that a serpent had drawn near. It was 45 feet long and its beard was two feet long. Its body was covered with gold and its eyebrows were real lapis lazuli.\" The serpent's looks, it turns out, were deceiving; it was a most considerate and accommodating creature. It took the sailor up in its mouth tenderly, carried him to its lair, listened sympathetically to his story and then relieved his worries with the news that, after four comfortable months on the island, one of the pharaoh's ships would come along, pick him up, and carry him home. In gratitude the sailor burst out with a promise to bring it thank offerings of all sorts of incense. \"Thereupon it laughed at me. And it said, 'I am the prince of Punt and myrrh—that is my very own!'\" As if to confirm these words, when the rescue ship as prophesied did come along, the serpent sent the sailor off with a full cargo of incense of every conceivable type. Two months later he was safely home. Near the famous valley across the river from Thebes where so many of the pharaohs dug their tombs, stands the huge temple of Deir-elBahari, a monument erected shortly after 1500 B.C. by Hatshepsut, the first great queen of history. On its walls she carved a record, with detailed illustrations, of an achievement she was particularly proud of, a large-scale trading voyage to Punt. Many years before Hatshepsut's reign, Egypt had fallen upon difficulties. Civil war had split the country, and the fragments were ruled by upstart princelings or by invaders. None was in a position to maintain a project as sizable as a Red Sea fleet. The shipping of incense, as centuries before, was once again carried on overland through middle-\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nFIG. 1. Hatshepsut's fleet at Punt.\n\nmen. But around 1570 B.C. a new dynasty arose which reunited the country, established afirmrule, and inaugurated an age that was to be Egypt's most celebrated. The fifth member of the line was Hatshepsut. Among her important acts was the restoration of direct maritime connections with Punt. On one of the walls of the queen's tomb-temple, exquisitely carved in the low relief the Egyptians used so effectively, is a unique series of vignettes (Fig. 1). We see a fleet entering the harbor at Punt: three sleek, clean-lined vessels are still under way, their great sails bellying with wind, while two others have doused their canvas and are ready to tie up. Next is the disembarkation: an Egyptian royal messenger heads afileof men and offers a heap of familiar objects of barter—necklaces, hatchets, daggers—to the king of Punt who advances to meet him, followed by an enormously fat wife, two sons, and a daughter. Then ensues a scene of frenetic activity as a long line of Puntites brings the products of the country to the tent of the royal messenger, while another file carries jars and trees up gangplanks onto the vessels. Then comes the departure, the ships leaving the harbor under full sail, their decks piled high with cargo. Each scene has a caption to describe it down to the minutest details of action (\"Hard to port!\" calls the pilot of one of the ships as they maneuver; \"Watch your step!\" is carved over the stevedores in the loading scene), and from them an almost complete list of the cargo can be compiled. It is imposing: various\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n13\n\nwoods including ebony, myrrh-resin, live myrrh trees (clearly shown in the reliefs with their roots bagged in a ball as carefully as any gardener would want), various other types of incense, ivory, gold, eye cosmetic, skins, 3,300 head of cattle, natives and their children. And some souvenirs: native spears, apes, monkeys, dogs, even \"a southern panther alive, captured for her majesty.\" The inclusion of myrrh trees is suggestive. Were they merely to decorate the royal gardens or did Hatshepsut have the shrewd notion of cultivating them in Egypt to reduce her country's dependence on a foreign source of supply? The vessels shown on Hatshepsut's reliefs represent the high-water mark of the Egyptian shipwright. Yet, though they are fine-looking craft, their design had serious weaknesses and for good reasons was not to play an important role in the history of naval architecture. In ancient Egypt, stretched like a ribbon along the banks of a river that offered a clear course of over four hundred miles, it was natural that the designing and sailing of boats would begin early and develop rapidly. The Nile offered the best and easiest form of transport. It was even blessed with a prevailing wind that blew from the north: one could sail upstream and drift downstream—or row without strain, if in a hurry. The tombs of Egypt have yielded pictures and even models of a bewildering variety of river craft, from tiny rowboats through swift yachts and dispatch boats to enormous barges that were built to carry huge obelisks, weighing hundreds of tons, from the granite quarries far upstream. Life on the ancient Nile must have been every bit as varied and picturesque as on Mark Twain's Mississippi. And as designers of river craft the Egyptians were unsurpassed. This was their weakness: when they turned to seagoing ships they simply constructed oversize Nile boats. The procedure for building a wooden ship that has been traditional in the Western world, the procedure we know best, is to start with a skeleton of keel and ribs and fasten to this a skin of planking. The Egyptians, building for use on a river where there were no storms, no violent winds, battering waves, or ripping currents, constructed their vessels, even the largest ones, without keel and with few, very light ribs. The planks were pinned to each other rather than to an inner skeleton. The only stiffening provided beyond a handful of ribs consisted of beams run from gunwale to gunwale on which the deck was laid. This was adequate for a river. A good deal more was needed for a ship that was to sail the open Mediterranean. About 2450 B.C. Pharaoh Sahure built a fleet of transports to ferry his troops to the Levant coast. He ordered his artists to carve a picture of the scene on the walls of his pyramid and thereby left us the earliest\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nclear representation extant of seagoing ships (PL 3). So carefully did the artists execute their assignment that almost every detail of construction appears; we can see precisely what the Egyptian naval architect did to adapt for use on a sea a boat basically built for a river. Around one end of the vessel he looped an enormous hawser, carried it along the centerline above the deck, and looped it about the other end. By placing a stout pole through the strands of the hawser where it passed over the deck, and twisting, one could tighten the whole harness like a tourniquet. This was his substitute for internal stiffening; twisted until it had the proper tension, the hawser kept the ends from sagging when the vessel rode heavy waves. The architect further added an elaborate netting that ran horizontally about the upper part of the hull. Is this, too, an aid for holding the ship together, a girdle as it were, or is it mere chafing gear to protect the sides from rubbing? The architect could not use the ordinary single mast, for there was no keel in which to sink its end securely (the heel of a mast exerts tremendous leverage against its socket); so he designed a two-legged affair that distributed the pressure, and he stayed it carefully with lines fore and aft. On it a tall, slender squaresail was mounted, in a fashion peculiar to Egypt: two spars spread it, a yard along the head and a boom along the foot. But the ship was not solely a sailing vessel; when there was no wind or when it was foul, sail was taken in, the mast was lowered, and rowers sent it on its way. The Egyptian artists, in their scrupulous attention to detail, have added a homely touch that enables us to figure out what kind of stroke the rowers used. Oarsmen are always pictured with a special type of loincloth, one made of a netted material with a square patch of solid leather on the seat. This obviously was chafing gear: the rower must have handled his oar somewhat the way they did in the Middle Ages and later, rising to his feet to begin the stroke and dropping back on the seat with the pull; without a sturdy patch on his rear, he would have rubbed through his loincloth in short order. A thousand years later naval architects were designing the ships shown on Hatshepsut's reliefs (Fig. 1). With lines that have the graceful curves of a racing yacht, they are cleaner and faster than Sahure's. The sail is much larger and no longer tall, but enormously broad instead; it is still spread by two spars, a yard along the head and boom along the foot. It is so wide that yard and boom are made each of two tapering spars with their ends fished together; this not only gave greater strength but was easier to construct, since a pair of saplings fastened together at their thick ends did the trick. The broad sail permitted the use of a much shorter mast, one that consequently exerted much less leverage, and the architect has accordingly given up the old\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n15\n\ntwo-legged arrangement for a single pole. But except for these—improvements rather than radical changes in design—almost everything else is as before. The keelless vessel with its handful of light ribs must still be braced by a heavy hawser looped about its ends and twisted to the proper tension. These boats were beautiful; unquestionably they were fast; but they sadly lacked sturdiness. We shall not see them outside Egypt. The peak of Egyptian expansion was reached in the reign of Hatshepsut's successor, Thutmose III, perhaps the greatest of the pharaohs. It was he who extended Egypt's arm over Palestine and Syria and Phoenicia and even beyond to countries inland, and carried out his conquest and organization of the areas so thoroughly that his successors were able to coast for centuries on what he had accomplished. For the next three hundred years, until about 1200 B.C., Egypt's trade flourished as never before. Vessels from the Levant dumped on its quays everything from ponderous timber to the finest and most delicate objects of Asiatic craftsmanship. The pharaohs and their courts rode in chariots that were made in Syria, raised cattle that came from Asia Minor, ate delicacies that were grown on the island of Cyprus, and were served by swarms of Asiatic and Semitic slaves. Their wives dressed in gorgeous stuffs from Syria and scented themselves with the perfumes of South Arabia. Punt provided its stores of incense, ivory, and rare woods. Copper was brought from Cyprus and silver from Asia Minor. In return, Egypt sent out gold that was mined in Nubia, writing paper made from the fibers of the papyrus reed or cordage twisted from them, linen textiles, and the fine products of its workshops—beads, faience, scarabs, figurines. A king of Cyprus, who had supplied the pharaoh with copper and timber, writes to ask for horses, chariots, a bed of rare wood all goldplated, women's dresses, jars of oil of fine quality. In another letter he requests an Egyptian specialty that may not have been as unusual as it sounds—a sorcerer; this one had to be an expert with eagles. The tempo of trade was such that merchants from overseas established residences in Egypt. In the great city of Memphis a foreign quarter sprang up complete, as such places always are, with temples to the strangers' gods. A picture can at times tell more than a bookful of words, and by great good fortune there is one to illustrate the commerce of this period. The business executive of today orders a photograph of his plant in action and hangs it in his office; the ancient Egyptian functionary commissioned a picture of himself in official action and had it painted on the wall of a chamber in his tomb. Kenamun was an official under Pharaoh Amenhotep III in charge of, among other things, commerce\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER TWO •r-\n\n- - - - • - V.-.VAV\n\nFIG. 2. Arrival of a fleet of Levantine vessels in an Egyptian port.\n\nwith the Levant. So he had painted in his tomb a picture, complete to the last homely detail, of a typical moment in an Egyptian harbor fourteen centuries before the birth of Christ (Fig. 2). A fleet of ships has just arrived. You can tell where they come from by the dress and looks of the skippers and the mates, who wear gaily embroidered ankle-length robes and have full beards and prominent hooked profiles. They are unquestionably Semites; the vessels consequently must be from Syria or Phoenicia, perhaps even from Byblos itself. Are the ships, too, foreign or are they Egyptian? With their gracefully curved bow and stern and prominent overhangs fore and aft, they seem very like Hatshepsut's vessels. Yet they lack the telltale looped hawser. Perhaps it is the artist's fault: as an Egyptian he may have grafted a native look on to vessels that were really Levantine. He's a bit lubberly at best; no vessels could ride so high out of the water as his do. A number of them are already made fast, their sails furled, the boarding ladders lowered from the prows to the shore. Harbors were rough-and-ready affairs in those days; since there were no wharves, ships were simply run up on the beach. Other vessels are shown making ready to land. Sailors have sprung aloft to take in canvas, and on one the skipper stands in the bow carefully sounding with a long pole as the ship inches in toward the beach. On shore everything is bustling the way one expects when a fleet comes in. An Egyptian customs official, standing before an officer and file of men from one of the ships, is entering information about them on a tablet. One Egyptian tradesman is busy trying to sell his wares; he points with emphasis to his scale to assure prospective customers that it is accurate. Another is actually transacting a piece of business with one of the ships' officers. The latter is trying to sell a large jar, probably of wine or oil, for no good grade of either was ever produced in Egypt; behind\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n17\n\nhim a file of hands from the vessel unloads more jars. A tradeswoman appears to be feeling the heat; instead of hawking her wares, she sits under slippers and other articles of clothing she has for sale and lazily fans the flies away. In the right-hand side of the uppermost panel a ship's officer seems to be asking a favor from an Egyptian official concerning two women and a child who precede him. Note the diaphanous triple-tiered dress that the women wear; we shall have occasion to refer to it shortly. In the panels below we see the procession before Kenamun himself: men from the ships stolidly file before him with wares of all sorts, while their officers grovel before the great man. Active as Egypt's trade was, it had strict limits. Her lightly built ships raced south to Punt and north to the Levant but very likely not much farther. Many of the products the Egyptians imported and exported were carried in foreign bottoms, like those in Kenamun's picture. The distinction of being the first great traders of the Mediterranean goes to another people, a race of born sea sailors rather than rivermen. Some decades before Kenamun sat in his office supervising shipments from the Levant, a noble named Rekhmire, vizier of Egypt and second in importance only to the pharaoh, ordered an opulent tomb to be prepared for himself. On its walls he commanded the artists to paint pictures showing all the world paying tribute to his master, the mighty Thutmose III. As in Kenamun's picture, there appear Semites from Phoenicia and Syria. There are men from the south, blacks from the Sudan, and people from Punt. Alongside these by now familiar faces suddenly appear others who are completely new. They wear unusually decorated kilts and queer sandals, and do their hair in a strange fashion. The bowls and other vessels they carry have unfamiliar shapes. \"The People of the Isles in the midst of the Sea,\" the caption calls them. It has been one of archaeology's prime achievements to identify these figures. \"Minos is the first to whom tradition ascribes the possession of a navy. He made himself master of a great part of what is now termed the Hellenic Sea; he conquered the isles of the Aegean and was the first colonizer of most of them.\" So wrote Thucydides, one of the most sober and scientific historians who ever existed, in the fifth century B.C., some thousand years after the times of Thutmose and Rekhmire. As late as the nineteenth century, the statement seemed hard to believe: Minos, as far as anyone knew, was a figment of mythology, not a character in history. All that was reported of him seemed pure fancy: that he ruled the island of Crete, that he had built there a trackless maze called the \"labyrinth\" and kept in it the Minotaur, \"Minos' bull,\" a mythical creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull; that\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nhe had the grisly habit of feeding it live mortals and for this purpose yearly levied seven young men and seven young women from Athens; and that Theseus, the legendary hero of the city, volunteered to be sent out, and with the help of Minos' own daughter, who had fallen in love with him at first sight, slew the monster and escaped safely. In 1900 a British archaeologist named Arthur Evans started digging at Knossos, several miles in from Herakleion on the north shore of Crete. His results were spectacular. Within a few months he had begun to uncover the remains of a mighty civilization whose existence had hardly been suspected. He laid bare the foundations of an enormous palace, one that had so complex an arrangement of rooms and corridors that it resembled a veritable labyrinth. Everywhere he found the bull's head used as a sacred symbol. He found, too, a symbol in the form of a double-ax, and he remembered that Plutarch had once written that there was a non-Greek word labrys which meant \"ax.\" In the ruins were a multitude of specimens of pottery decorated gaily in a unique style. On the walls were murals done in a charming naturalistic manner. He even uncovered clay tablets with two distinct forms of writing. Here, then, was a people with a fully developed civilization, their own art, architecture, and literature. What they called themselves Evans had no idea, for their writing was indecipherable. But the clues that connected them with the heretofore mythical Minos and his labyrinth and Minotaur were manifest. So he dubbed them the \"Minoans\" and so they have been called ever since. As excavation proceeded at Knossos and other sites on Crete and more began to be known of these people, two features in particular came to the fore: first, that their pottery, so easily identified by its unique decoration, was to be found in many lands lying overseas, while foreign objects in abundance were scattered through the ruins of their cities; second, that their cities were completely unwalled. The conclusion was inescapable. Thucydides knew what he was talking about: the people of Crete, in an age remote even when he was writing, had been daring and active traders and the possessors of a great navy; Minoan towns needed no stone walls, for wooden ones, their ships, protected the island. As far back as the days of Snefru and Sahure there was trade contact between Minoans and Egyptians. In the ruins on Crete, archaeologists discovered stone bowls that seem like types made in Egypt as early as 2700 B.C. Some seven hundred years later, when Pharaoh Amenemhet II was selecting treasures to be placed in his tomb, he included a group of silver bowls of a kind made in Crete. Did Minoan ships bring these objects directly to Egypt or did they carry them to the nearer coasts of Phoenicia or Syria, and did they then make their way\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n19\n\nto Egypt as part of the trade it carried on at all times with the Levant? There is no certain answer. Some of them may have, but not necessarily all. The sailors of Crete traveled to far more distant places; the direct voyage to Egypt could have held no terrors for them. Minoan traders have left a trail of their pottery in Palestine and Syria and Asia Minor in the east. They reached north as far as Macedonia. Southward they knew other parts of Africa besides Egypt. One of the signs found among their carvings is a representation of a plant, highly prized in ancient days as a medicine and spice, that grew only in one particular spot on the coast of Libya, while a tiny seal found in their ruins has a picture that includes an ostrich feather. In the west they pushed as far as Sardinia and Sicily. Legend has it that Minos himself died on Sicily, and one of the Sicilian towns of later historic times was named Minoa. The picture of what the objects of Minoan trade were is lopsided because the evidence is limited almost entirely to the sorts of things the archaeologist can dig up. Yet enough has been found to show that there was great demand in the outside world for the products of Minoan workshops. Among the highly civilized nobles of Egypt and Phoenicia and the semibarbaric chieftains of Greece alike, there were those who preferred to eat off dishes decorated in the Minoan fashion, carry Minoan-style weapons in battle, and wear Minoan jewelry and garments of Minoan textiles in court. Minoan women wore a tight bodice and bell-shaped skirt made up in a number of tiers; in an Egyptian tomb painting, a Semitic princess appears wearing precisely such a skirt, and it reappears on Semitic women in the harbor scene of Kenamun's tomb (Fig. 2). In return, the Minoans imported a good many things: gold, beads, faience, figurines, and probably papyrus paper from Egypt; copper from Cyprus; ivory from Syria. Amber, following prehistoric routes across Europe from the Baltic, made its way to their workshops. The heyday of the Minoans' trade was from about 1800 to 1500 B.C., when they had connections with Greece, Rhodes, Cyprus, Asia Minor, and the Levant. It was in this period that their commercial and political leaders built the magnificent dwelling places, furnished in opulent and beautiful style, which the archaeologists' spades have uncovered. Thanks to recent discoveries, we now know what the ships of the Minoan navy, that instrument vital to the protection of the island and its trade, looked like. Some seventy-five miles north of Crete is Thera, a small island distinguished by a large and vigorous volcano. Here a prosperous and sizable town stood until, around 1600 B.C., the volcano exploded in a mighty eruption that caused the whole center of the\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nisland to disappear under the sea, blew ash as far as Crete, and buried the town under a deep blanket of ash. In the early 1970s it was excavated, and in a room in a large, impressive house there was found a painted frieze, part of which depicts a procession of galleys and other craft (PL 4). The galleys are graceful, slender vessels, with handsomely decorated hulls and prows that jut forward in a gentle, elegant curve. The rig consists of a broad squaresail with yard along the head and boom along the foot; it looks much like the sails in the paintings in Kenamun's tomb (Fig. 2). The sails are furled since the ships are being driven by manpower, a line of twenty-odd paddlers. The use of paddlers on ships of this size at this time is indeed strange, particularly since other craft in the frieze are shown being rowed. Vessels propelled by multiple paddlers appear in Egyptian pictures, but these all date from almost a thousand years earlier. Very likely the Thera frieze portrays an age-old religious event featuring a parade of ships that, to suit the occasion, were propelled in age-old fashion. In another portion of the frieze (PI. 5), unfortunately very fragmentary, we see these galleys in action, and here, as we would expect, they are being rowed. They have low parapets at bow and stern; on one a marine with a long lance stands stolidly behind the bow parapet. The vessels forge ahead through waters spangled with drowning men and abandoned weapons. The nation that maintained the navy made up of these ships was the first great sea power of the Mediterranean, the first to explore in a fruitful way much of its expanse and to lay out trade lines that were destined to last for millennia. They were even the first—at least so far as we know—to depict the sea monsters that their sailors, like seamen everywhere, must have yarned about (PI. 6). Must they not, therefore, be the \"People of the Isles\" on the wall of Rekhmire's tomb? The figures there wear their hair in the same manner as the men that appear in Cretan murals, and they carry vases shaped and decorated like those found in Minoan sites. Can we not conclude without further ado that these \"People of the Isles\" are from Crete? The problem is not quite that easily solved. No more than a day's sail from Minos' palace in Crete lies the southern portion of the peninsula of Greece. Early in their history Minoan traders had made their way here. The effect of their arrival was startling. The local inhabitants gobbled up Minoan civilization as avidly as Japan in the nineteenth century did that of the Occident. Their whole lives were transformed. They decorated the walls of their houses, their pots, and their dishware in the Minoan manner. They fashioned the same sort of seals and jewelry, wore the same sort of armor, dressed in the Minoan style. The women did their hair a la minoenne\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE BEGINS\n\n21\n\nand looked to Crete for their fashions the way we do to Paris and Rome. Much of what was native disappeared under an overlay of culture from Crete. The phenomenon was so striking that some scholars, viewing it, theorized that Crete had physically conquered the mainland of Greece and ruled it as a vassal. But they had the facts somewhat twisted. A brilliant stroke of scholarship identified beyond doubt the people inhabiting Greece at this period and straightened out the historical incidents of this remote age. On the island of Crete, tabkts inscribed in two types of writing had been found. One of the two types reappeared on the mainland. In 1953 a British architect named Michael Ventris, who had as a hobby played about with these inscrutable documents using pure cryptographic methods, capped twenty years of work by breaking the script. They were written, he determined, in an early form of Greek. In a flash the picture became clear: the Minoans had carried their civilization to the mainland Greeks and, not long after 1500 B.C., the latter had repaid them with conquest. That was why in the palace ruins on Crete, along with the tablets—still undeciphered—written in the native Minoan language, excavators found writings of the new masters in Greek. With this act these early Greeks established themselves as the heirs of the Minoans' maritime empire, and for some three centuries they carried it on, from roughly 1500 to 1200 B.C. Their cities in the homeland grew rich, especially Mycenae where, according to Homer, King Agamemnon once ruled; this was the first of their centers to be excavated, and as a result scholars refer to the Greeks of this time as Mycenaeans and the period as the Mycenaean Age. The rulers of Mycenae and the other leading cities during this age included some who were so wealthy and powerful and such redoubtable warriors that after they passed away they—and their queens—lived on in men's memories and, centuries later, were immortalized in Homer's great epics. \"The People of the Isles\" of Rekhmire's tomb and of other Egyptian paintings may have been Minoans from Crete, but it is just as likely—the murals all date in the fifteenth century B.C.—that they were Mycenaeans. The remains of Mycenaean jars and flasks have been found in abundance in the ruins of the palace at Tell el-Amarna, a city built from scratch about 1370 B.C. by Pharaoh Akhenaten as his capital; if Mycenaean traders did not themselves get this far, then middlemen who dealt with them certainly did. A trail of pottery fragments dug up by archaeologists mark the routes followed by Mycenaean traders. Their ships worked eastward to the west coast of Asia Minor or southward to Crete, from where they cut east by way of Rhodes and Cyprus to the cities along the Le-\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nvant. Here many unloaded and, letting Levantines transship whatever was consigned to Egypt, picked up return cargoes that included whatever the transshippers had brought back from there. All papyrus paper, for example, was manufactured in Egypt, but so much of it came to Greece by way of the Levant that the standard Greek word for the product was byblos, reflecting the name of the harbor at which most traders from Greece must have taken on their cargoes of it. When traveling westward, the Mycenaeans probably sailed to Crete to pick up consignments of products from there, then up the western shore of Greece and across the Adriatic to Sicily and southern Italy. The most crowded ports of all, though, must have been those along the Levantine coast. Here ships from all quarters of the eastern Mediterranean put in: the Levantine merchant marine shared the quays with vessels from Egypt, Cyprus, Crete, and Greece. The harborside of Sidon or Byblos must have presented a scene every bit as polyglot and bizarre as any of the modern international entrepots. Along the docks, vessels loaded and unloaded products that originated in various countries and ran the gamut from everyday commodities to precious luxuries. The proof is furnished not only by random statements in certain contemporary documents or random finds in archaeological excavations but by the excavation of wrecks of ships of the time, one of which may well have been carrying a cargo belonging to a king. The discovery and scrupulously careful investigation of this find in particular has shed new light on the maritime history of the age, not only enriching enormously our knowledge of its commerce but adding a vital detail to our knowledge of the development of naval technology. Before going into the matter, however, we must tell what made such a discovery and such an investigation possible.\n\nChapter 3\n\nEXCAVATING UNDER WATER\n\nSHORTLY BEFORE EASTER in the year 1900, a group of Greek sponge divers, returning from their season off Tunisia, ran into a storm and took refuge in a sheltered cove on Antikythera, a little island off the southern coast of Greece. Just to pass the time, some of the crew slipped over the side. When, a few minutes later, one reappeared lugging the bronze arm of a Greek statue, marine archaeology was born. Its babyhood was spectacular. The divers had had the astounding good fortune to stumble upon the wreck of a vessel that had been carrying works of art to Italy in the early decades of the first century B.C. when it went down. The Greek government undertook to salvage the cargo. The only personnel available were sponge fishermen who, though they found excavating statues on the seafloor a far cry from cutting away sponges, through herculean efforts managed to carry it off successfully. What they rescued was priceless: some fine bronzes, two of which are among the prize pieces in Athens' National Museum, magnificent glass bowls, even a bronze astronomical instrument, an orrery, with delicate and sophisticated gearing. A few years later came another rare piece of luck, again involving sponge divers. A group that had been working off Mahdia on the coast of Tunisia circulated the story that they had seen a row of cannon on the seafloor. It came to the local director of antiquities, Alfred Merlin, and piqued his interest. He sent some divers down and quickly found out that the so-called cannon were a row of columns, part of the cargo of a ship that had sunk probably in the early part of the first century B.C. Merlin decided to carry out a full-fledged underwater excavation. He rounded up a squad of sponge fishermen, got the French navy to lend a hand by supplying a salvage vessel, and in 1907 began the first of a series of grueling campaigns. It was a fight against time and wind and weather—the navy kept recalling its ship, rough seas often prevented any diving, storms occasionally destroyed his markers, and the wreck had to be painfully discovered all over again—and, despite seven years of work, the job was never fully completed. But what he found well paid for his efforts. The vessel, in addition to the columns and other architectural elements, turned out to have been carrying works of art, and his divers rescued enough sculptures to fill half a dozen rooms of the Bardo Museum in Tunis.\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nThe two discoveries naturally raised the highest hopes for the future. World War I interrupted things for a while, but prospects again brightened when fishermen, working in the strait between the Greek mainland and the northern end of the island of Euboea, brought up a superb bronze statue of Poseidon, now one of the treasures of the Athens museum. The wreck itself, however, was never discovered. It was not until decades later that anything like the thorough investigation Merlin had carried out at Mahdia was again attempted. The fishermen of Albenga, a town on the Italian Riviera, had known since 1925 of the presence of a wreck with a cargo of amphoras—as the big clay jars used by the ancients for shipping are called—off their shores. In 1950 a well-known Italian salvage expert was persuaded to try his hand at it. He put one of his superbly equipped salvage ships at the disposal of archaeology and, by lowering huge mechanical jaws over the wreck, in twelve days his men managed to grub up seven hundred jars and some scraps of the hull and its fittings. These few days were all the vessel could be spared for, and the rest of the cargo, very likely over ten thousand more jars, had to be left on the bottom. Excavation such as took place at Albenga and Mahdia had little future. The one had depended on the philanthropy of a salvage company, the other on sponge fishermen and a helping hand from the French navy. Even more important, at no time was the slightest effort made to follow proper archaeological procedures, to attempt to gain some overall view of what lay on the sea floor, identify even approximately the location of whatever objects were visible, record even approximately the location of whatever objects were removed. Marine archaeology had to find a totally new approach if it was to get anywhere. The tool that led to such an approach was supplied by a French naval officer, Commandant Jacques-Ives Cousteau. An apparatus that did away with the need for the traditional heavy diving equipment, which involved pumps and crews, expensive diving suits and helmets, had been known in one form or another since as early as the 1860s. In 1943 the Commandant perfected a simplified version, now known as the Cousteau-Gagnon apparatus, which transformed diving from a strictly professional activity into one open to amateurs. Cousteau's creation consisted of one to three cylindrical tanks of compressed air connected with a mouthpiece and mounted in a harness that the diver strapped on the back. A big goggle fitting over the eyes and nose, and a pair of rubber fins that slipped over the feet, items for sale in any sporting-goods shop, completed the outfit. No longer were divers tied by an airhose, like an umbilical cord, to a pump on a ship's deck and limited in their range of activity; they could walk into the surf or dive\n\nEXCAVATING UNDER WATER\n\n25\n\nfrom a rocky coast and spend half an hour or more under water, depending upon the number of tanks they carried and the depth they dove to. Today the apparatus has been so improved and refined, is so easy and safe to use, that SCUBA diving—that is, diving with the new Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus—has become almost as popular a sport as skiing. It was the French who first went in for it in a big way. Hundreds of devoted afficionados would spend hours prowling about the seafloor off the southern coast, particularly the Riviera. Very quickly startling reports began to come in of the discovery of not one or two, but numbers of ancient wrecks. Soon they, as well as others infected by their enthusiasm, moved farther afield; and wrecks began to turn up along the Italian Riviera, in the straits between Sardinia and Corsica, off Greece and the Aegean Islands. However, unlike the first discoveries, none of these, it turned out, were carrying works of art. Like the one off Albenga, they had been loaded for the most part with amphoras. The first extended investigation of a wreck using the new apparatus began in February 1952. A few miles outside the harbor of Marseilles lies a cluster of tiny islands which are little more than barren outcroppings of rock. Off one of these, the Grand Congloue, a diver had spotted in 1949 a batch of amphoras on the seafloor. The word subsequently reached Cousteau, and the idea came to him of excavating the site. It lay right alongside one slope of the Grand Congloue, so diving installations could be set up on the island itself. With Cousteau providing the technical know-how and Fernand Benoit, director of antiquities for the region, looking out for the archaeological end, the work got under way. Progress was painfully slow. The divers were limited to twenty minutes on the bottom, including the time it took for them to get up and down; only two dives a day were permitted, and there were usually not more than two or three men on hand at any time. Often the weather stopped all work. Not only muck and marine growth covered the wreck but huge boulders had crashed down into it from the slope above, and the divers had to remove all this before they could get at the vessel itself. Moreover, since they were beginners, they had to invent the techniques of excavating under water as they went along. The ship—or, rather, ships; later investigation revealed there were two— proved to be freighters filled, like the Albenga wreck, with amphoras. The excavation of the remains off the Grand Congloue exemplified marine archaeology in its infancy, when the archaeologist-divers worked—at least at first—with little more than their hands. Today they command a battery of sophisticated tools—powerful vacuum cleaners to suck away the sand that overlies a wreck, various lifts to\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nbring objects to the surface, powerful lights to illumine the working area, even miniature submarines to extend their range of research and the length of time they can stay below. In its infancy marine archaeology was all too often little better than treasure hunting. Today its practitioners are as careful and exact in their methods as their counterparts on land. This was a development pioneered by American underwater excavators, notably George Bass, who was a trained archaeologist first and a diver second. Bass and his colleagues and students devised the procedures that are now standard in properly conducted digs: they start by erecting a grid over the whole of a site to provide reference points for the locating of every part of the wreck and every item in it (PL 7); they map and photograph the site before excavation and constantly during it; they pinpoint the location of every part or object and tag it; they photograph objects both before and after they are removed. As a result, they are able to determine the location of the various elements in a cargo, whether forward or amidships or aft. They can determine too whether an object came from the cabin area, and hence was not part of the cargo but belonged to the ship's equipment or to a passenger or crewman. They can often deduce from the disposition of the cargo and the remains of the hull how the ship struck when it went down. By now hundreds of ancient wrecks have been located on the seafloor and examined to a greater or lesser extent. The majority are Greek or Roman ships dating from later times; we will deal with them in due course. But in 1960 a team headed by Bass began the excavation of a wreck that turned out to be far older than any found hitherto, dating to about 1200 B.C. It was a small freighter, perhaps thirty feet long, that was carrying a cargo of copper and bronze when it came to grief off Cape Gelidonya on the southwest coast of Asia Minor. A number of objects found in it make it almost certain that the ship either touched at or operated from the ports of the Levant; indeed, the owner of the cargo may very well have come from there. Then in 1982 off Ulu Burun, just a bit west of Gelidonya, Bass hit the archaeological jackpot, the wreck of a ship even earlier in date, about 1350 B.C., and one that was a veritable treasure trove. The ship off Gelidonya was a tramp freighter shuttling along the coast with a cargo of metals. The Ulu Burun ship, to judge from the nature of the cargo, very likely was carrying a royal consignment. The major component was a batch of sixty-pound ingots of copper, some two hundred of them, carefully stowed in rows deep in the hull (PL 8). There were also dozens of ingots of tin; the smiths who would ultimately receive the shipment would mix the two to manufacture bronze. The second largest component was terebinth resin, perhaps a ton of it,\n\nEXCAVATING UNDER WATER\n\n27\n\npacked in amphoras; such resin was used in making perfume. Then there was a collection of scrap metal intended for re-use—not mere copper or tin but fragments of gold and silver jewelry. There was a beautiful cup, in mint condition, made of solid gold. There were pieces of raw ivory, some hippopotamus teeth, ingots of raw glass, logs of African ebony, a consignment of Cypriot ceramics, eighteen pieces in all, carefully packed in a huge clay jar. The cargo reveals graphically how international was the trade of this period: the copper and ceramics came from Cyprus, the resin and glass from the Near East, the ebony and hippopotamus teeth from Egypt. Individual objects that were found underline the same point: Near Eastern cylinder seals, Egyptian scarabs, a Mycenaean seal, and pieces of Mycenaean pottery. The ship had loaded on the resin at some port on the Levantine coast. It may have also taken on here the Egyptian goods—or it may have made a stop at Egypt itself for these. It loaded the copper and ceramics at some port on Cyprus, and most likely was on its way farther westward from there, to the west coast of Asia Minor or the Aegean islands or even Crete, when it went down. At least one Mycenaean was aboard, the owner of the seal, but this does not mean that the ship was Mycenaean; he may have been a passenger, not the owner. The vessel could just as well have been the property of a businessman or a consortium of businessmen from some port along the Levant. A vivid picture of the trade of these times is not the only contribution of this extraordinary wreck. It makes yet another, equally notable, to the history of naval technology. For, burrowing through the layers of cargo, the excavators came upon the planking of the bottom of the hull; the overlying cargo had saved it from destruction. And this revealed a fact of paramount importance: the ship had been built in the distinctive fashion that, as we know from wrecks of a much later date, was the hallmark of the ancient shipwright. We had for years theorized that the technique was very old; the Ulu Burun wreck furnishes proof positive. There are, basically, two ways to construct a wooden boat. The one we are familiar with, because it has been standard practice in the Western world for centuries, is to set up a skeleton of keel and ribs—or frames, to give them their technical name—and then fasten to this a skin of planks. The other method, favored in Africa, Asia, and certain parts of northern Europe, is just the reverse: first a shell is erected by pinning each plank to its neighbors, and then a certain amount of framing is inserted to stiffen the shell. In northern Europe planks are\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nFIG. 3. Joining strakes by means of mortises and tenons.\n\nset to overlap each other and pinned together by driving rivets through where the thickness is double. Elsewhere planks are set edge to edge and are held together by pegs or staples or nails or are even sewn together with twine made from coconut husks or split bamboo or whatever fiber happens to be available. The ancient shipwright, it turns out, used the second method—but with a refined technique unmatched in the subsequent history of shipbuilding, Indeed, it was more cabinet work than carpentry. For he locked the planks of his shell together not with pegs or staples or the like, but with mortise-and-tenon joints placed as close to each other as in a piece of furniture, often even closer (PL 9, Fig. 3). In addition, he transfixed each joint with dowels to ensure that it would never come apart. Then, into this tightly knit structure, he inserted framing wellnigh as complete as in hulls made with a pre-erected skeleton. And he used this demanding and time-consuming procedure for craft of all sizes, from seagoing freighters to mere skiffs. Until Bass's discovery, we had no sure clue to the age of this method of building a ship, to how far back it went. A passage in the Odyssey (p. 41) indicates that it was in use when Homer was writing, and his floruit is usually placed in the eighth century B.C. The Ulu Burun\n\nEXCAVATING UNDER WATER\n\n29\n\nwreck reveals that it goes back certainly to the fourteenth century B.C. and very likely much before that. What did the Ulu Burun ship look like? Our only clue to the appearance of seagoing merchantmen of this age are the Levantine vessels pictured on the walls of Kenamun's tomb—whose cargo, as it happens, includes the very same kind of amphora found in the wreck. These were deep-bellied freighters with curved ends terminating in short straight stems and sternposts (Fig. 2). Flush decks not only covered over their ample holds but, girt with high railings, permitted them to add a liberal deck load. The ships were driven by broad squaresails, which in shape and rig greatly resemble the Egyptian type and may have been modeled on it. As on Hatshepsut's vessels, the sail is bent to two spars, a boom along the foot and yard along the head, and there is a web of lines running from the upper part of the mast to the boom; these supported it so firmly that deck hands were able to walk along it. From written records of the age we know that Levantine merchantmen could run to great size, to no less than 450 tons in carrying capacity. From underwater finds we know that they could carry anchors weighing up to half a ton. We have far less to go on for the merchantmen used by the Minoans, merely tiny pictures engraved on seals (PL 10). They show hulls that seem to be rounded and roomy, and the number of lines that the artists drew running from gunwales to mast would indicate that they used sails large enough to require considerable staying. As on Egyptian and Levantine vessels, there is a spar along the foot as well as the head. For the freighters of the Mycenaeans we have no evidence whatsoever. Quite possibly they borrowed the types they used, as so much else, from the Minoans. The lords of Mycenae, like their Minoan predecessors, were wealthy and powerful men. They were able to build for themselves grand palaces to live in and sumptuous tombs to be laid away in. In these, excavators have found evidence that reveals how fabulously rich were the trappings of their daily life. They fought in beautifully wrought armor, drove in handsome chariots, and dressed themselves and their wives in style. They ate off magnificent dinnerware and drank from superbly decorated golden goblets. The age was a great one, great enough to linger in men's memories long after it had come to an end, for it was of the last part of it that Homer sang. But Homer is a poet of warriors, not traders, and his heroes, the soldiers of the sea, deserve their own chapter.\n\nChapter 4\n\nWAR ON THE SEA\n\nFROM THOSE EARLIEST DAYS when Egyptian merchantmen first sailed down the Red Sea and traders from Crete and Byblos made their maiden voyages in the eastern Mediterranean, the freighter had to share the seas with the man-of-war. When the warship made its debut in history, it was not the strippeddown platform for mounting attacks against an enemy ship that it is today. It was far more prosaic. The first vessels used in warfare were merely an adjunct of the army, transports to ferry troops. There was no distinction between ships of the naval arm and freighters at the outset: the commander who conceived the idea of water-borne transportation almost certainly carried it out by expropriating available merchantmen. The idea was thought of at least as early as ca. 2450 B.C. Egyptian records reveal that at that time Pharaoh Sahure used a fleet of transports to ferry an army to the Levantine coast (PI. 3 and cf. Chapter 2). Some two centuries later, Uni, Pharaoh Pepi's able commander, rushed troops by boat to quell a rebellion, probably along the Palestinian coast. But the master of the technique of transporting soldiers overseas was Hatshepsut's successor, Thutmose III (Chapter 2), Egypt's outstanding figure in so many of the arts of war. The great general fought eighteen campaigns in Syria and, from at least the sixth on, moved his troops there by water. His first step was to secure undisputed control of the harbors along the Phoenician coast. He then placed them in charge of vassal local princelings who had strict orders to keep these all-important facilities in top-notch order and fully provisioned. Each year he made a personal tour of inspection to make sure his instructions were carried out. The details of this enormous project are all lost. From a scanty allusive line such as \"Every port town of His Majesty was supplied with every good thing . . . with ships of cedar loaded with columns and beams as well as large timbers,\" we must imagine the ring of hammers and axes, the grunting of oxen, the shouts of carpenter and rigger, and the other varied sounds of a shipyard as quays, warehouses, repair shops, and the hundred and one other requirements of a naval base were set up. Thutmose carried it all out so rapidly and successfully that his military victories may have\n\nWAR ON THE SEA\n\n31\n\ncome about more from the quickness and ease with which he got his soldiers to the theater of combat than to their prowess. But the troop transport was not the only type of man-of-war to sail the seas in earliest times. There were also the ships of the sea rover, slim clean-lined vessels, always driven by oars as well as sail, and built first and foremost for speed and maneuverability. Actually they were useful for missions of peace as well as war: they not only could attack an unarmed merchantman or partake in a lightning raid on an undefended coastal town, but they could deliver urgent dispatches in the shortest time possible. The sea rover's ship may be just as old as its slower brethren, but it made its debut on the stage of recorded history relatively late, not until the beginning of the fourteenth century B.C. From 1379 to 1362 B.C. Akhenaten ruled Egypt, a young man who devoted himself to revolutionizing the religious life of Egypt as intently as his great ancestor had to building up naval bases and extending military conquests. To break clean with the past, shortly after ascending the throne the youthful zealot abandoned the old government center at Thebes with its traditional associations and built himself a completely new capital on a vast plain farther down the Nile. When, after his death, Egypt reverted to its old ways, his once fine city fell into ruins and was forgotten. And so it happened that in 1887, some three thousand years later, a peasant woman, digging in the area for dust to fertilize her garden, came upon what turned out to be part of the official archives of Akhenaten's foreign office, almost four hundred clay tablets containing letters that passed between him or his predecessor and various rulers of the Near East. The Tell el-Amarna letters, as they have come to be known from the modern name of the place where Akhenaten built his new capital, are well-nigh unique in ancient history. Here for once we have before us not some carefully edited records left by a king with an anxious eye cocked on posterity or some second- or thirdhand report by a historian writing years or centuries later, but original documents, the raw material of history, comparable, say, to the records on file in our State Department. A large proportion consists of letters written by the rulers in those very Levantine coastal cities that Thutmose III had molded into dependable naval bases. Times are very different now. A religious reformer and not a general sits on the throne of Egypt, and his correspondence is a graphic record of how these cities, once ruled so firmly by the pharaohs, are being picked off by enemies. In this drama Egypt is but the tragic victim; the villain of the piece is the sea rover. As letter succeeds letter, he enters the scene and gradually takes over the lead.\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nHere in these early records, sea rovers, formed into fleets, play some of the roles that navies were destined to play from this time on: grouping to enforce a blockade, preying upon maritime commerce, disrupting seaborne communications. The chief victim was none other than Byblos, that city whose contacts with Egypt in this age were already over a millennium and a half old. Rib-Addi, a local princeling, ruled it and Simyra, its neighbor to the north. \"Send me soldiers and provisions!\" was the refrain of his earliest letters to the pharaoh, repeated as the years went by with mounting urgency. But then there came a time when the dispatching of mere men and food was insufficient: the enemy had massed a fleet, put it into action, and sea power was exercising its inexorable influence on Rib-Addi. He had foreseen the danger. The ships were being sent out from the key Levantine ports of Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon. \"Put one of your men in each of these cities,\" he urged Akhenaten, \"and prevent them from using their ships against me!\" His plea had as little effect as his earlier ones for military reinforcements, and the inevitable results swiftly became apparent. \"[The enemy] has placed ships . . . so that grain cannot be brought into Simyra. We can't enter Simyra,\" another letter reports. And Rib-Addi sums the situation up with a vivid simile, \"As a bird that lies in a net, so is Simyra. The sons of Abdi-Ashirta by land and the people of Arvad by sea are against it day and night.\" The blockade was complete and Simyra fell. The enemy's forces on the water kept increasing. He grew bolder and no longer limited himself to blockade alone but went in for aggressive action. \"Two of my ships have been taken,\" Rib-Addi wrote in desperation on one occasion and, on another, \"[The enemy] has seized one of my ships and has actually sailed forth on the sea to capture my other ships.\" The contact by water between Byblos and Egypt was being severed. But Rib-Addi wasn't the only one to suffer. Sea raiders were loose all over the high seas. \"Ships from the Milim-people,\" he reports in a worried tone to the pharaoh, \"penetrated into the Amurri [northern Syria] and killed Abdi-Ashirta [the local ruler].\" We don't know who the Milim-people were specifically, but it is clear from Rib-Addi's lines that they were a dangerously successful group of hit-and-run sea raiders. But Akhenaten soon did not need reports of such activity; he felt the effects of it himself. Raiders from Lycia in southern Asia Minor, a region destined to achieve a great reputation in the grim history of piracy (Chapter 15), were bold enough to swoop down on the very shores of Egypt. The pharaoh wrote to the king of Cyprus accusing him of collusion, and the latter rushed back an aggrieved retort to the\n\nWAR ON THE SEA\n\n33\n\neffect that, far from aiding Lycians, he and his island had been suffering their incursions yearly. The warship, in a word, had come of age. Powerful naval units, massed in north Syria, could blockade nearby ports until they fell, disrupt Byblos' communications with Egypt, and prey upon the commerce between the two. Groups of raiders could sack cities on the Levantine coast, attack the shores of Cyprus, and even harry Egypt. The influence of sea power was making itself felt on history. Things had not been thus a century before when Thutmose calmly shuttled his troops between Egypt and Phoenicia, and when Rekhmire, his vizier, filled his ledgers with lists of items brought overseas from Cyprus, Asia Minor, Crete, and Greece. Something existed then which was able to maintain peace on the seas and which now, at the opening of the fourteenth century B.C., was gone. It was not the Egyptian navy; their oversize riverboats were never intended for hard work on the high seas. It could only have been the fleet of Minos and his successors. Crete's far-flung trade and especially its unwalled cities presuppose the existence of a great fleet. \"Minos is the first to whom tradition ascribes the possession of a navy,\" wrote Thucydides, as we noted before, and he had good reason for saying so. It was a navy that ruled the seas for centuries. What happened to it? The archaeological record reveals that the Mycenaeans occupied Crete sometime around 1450 B.C. and made themselves the complete heirs of Minoan civilization: they took over its homeland, its trading posts, its commerce. Was the move into the island preceded by an all-out naval battle in which the Mycenaean fleet wiped out the Minoan? Had the Minoans, after ruling the waters uncontestedly for so long, grown careless in the upkeep of their ships and thereby opened themselves to easy invasion by the aggressively expanding Mycenaeans? Whatever the precise cause or causes, the Minoan fleet at this point vanishes from history. \"The northern countries which were in their islands were quivering in their limbs. They penetrated the channels of the river-mouths.\" So wrote the scribe of Ramses III in recounting a great victory of his king in 1190 B.C. Almost three centuries had passed since the Mycenaean navy had supplanted the Minoan, and over a century and a half since raiders began to disrupt commerce along the Levant. The age of flourishing overseas traffic was coming to an end, and the age of the sea raiders was beginning. The Mediterranean was infested with bands of rovers, not only Lycians and other peoples from the coasts of Asia Minor but also people from \"the northern countries which were\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nin their islands.\" They joined the Libyans in a savage attack on Egypt from the west in 1221 B.C. and again in 1194 and were somehow repelled both times. Four years later some reformed to attack again, by land and sea, from Syria and Palestine. In a great naval engagement, one which stands as the first in history to be described and pictured, Ramses III destroyed their fleet. \"No land could stand before their arms,\" Ramses has his scribe write. \"A camp [was set up by them] in one place in Amor [perhaps in northern Syria]. They desolated its people. . . . They were coming forward toward Egypt, while the flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Peleset, Tjeker, Denyen and Weshesh.\" Of these names and others, disguised in the orthography of the Egyptian scribes, one can be identified with certainty: the Peleset are none other than the Philistines. Further Egyptian accounts record still others which suggest tantalizing identifications. Are the Tursha Tyrrhenians or Etruscans, in this age still an Asia Minor people not yet having migrated to their historical abode in central Italy? Are the Akaiwasha Achaeans, Homer's name for the Greeks? What faced Ramses was no mere hit-and-run raid such as Egypt had been putting up with since the days of Akhenaten. These attackers from \"the northern countries which were in their islands\" had consolidated their forces in northern Syria, had sacked the seaports of the Phoenician coast, and were sweeping down like a flood upon Egypt. It was a veritable migration. And, as the main body moved forward by land, the fleet kept pace along the coast. Ramses' victory was total. To celebrate it he erected a great temple near Thebes, and it was on its walls that his scribes wrote the story of his conquest and his artists portrayed, in carefully carved reliefs, its highlights. The encounter on land took place first, and the sculptures depict the pharaoh's troops smiting the invaders hip and thigh and breaking through the ranks of soldiers to get to the heavy two-wheeled oxcarts which carried the wives, children, and supplies. Once the land was secured Ramses turned to the enemy fleet. Somehow or other he managed to catch it unawares. As he puts it: \"Those who entered the river-mouths were like birds ensnared in the net.\" The picture illustrating this part of the action is unique (Fig. 4). It is the first and only complete representation of a historical sea battle that has come to us from the ancient world. The Egyptian galleys sweep down on the ships manned by the invaders, easily distinguished by their feathered headdresses. Egyptian archers from ships and shore spray them with a withering fire, crippling them severely before they can get close enough to strike a blow with their swords and thrusting spears; the very lookout in one of the crow's nests has been picked off and hangs\n\nWAR ON THE SEA\n\n35\n\n^ ^ laill 1 P W Wmk FIG. 4.

The pharaoh's men then move in with shield and spear to deliver the coup de grace: in the fight one of the northerners' ships has capsized; some of the crew are bound captives in an Egyptian vessel, while others swim to shore only to be pinioned by the waiting Egyptian soldiers. But not all the northerners were destroyed in this battle. Battered remnants made their way northward. The Tjeker planted themselves about Mount Carmel, and the Peleset settled to the south along the coast of Palestine. There they remained, not strong enough to try another attack on Egypt but soon sufficiently recovered to resume their old game of sea raiding and to play a leading role in certain pages of the Old Testament. Just about this time, in a different quarter of the Mediterranean, another great attack by sea raiders took place. It was, in all probability, much smaller in scope than that which Ramses had thrown back, involving fewer men and ships. Yet its story is one of the best known there is, for it was told not by a scribe or even a historian but by an immortal poet.\n\n36\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nOn a hill in northwest Asia Minor overlooking the Dardanelles, early in the third millennium B.C. the city we know as Troy had been founded.
