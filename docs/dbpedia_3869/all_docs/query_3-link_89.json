        "text": "Has anyone ever heard of the salvage divers -- or urinatores -- of Ancient Rome? Apparently they wore large 'kettles' on their heads full of air, and would dive down up to 30 meters to collect things from shipwrecks.\n\nI'd never heard tell of them until this morning, when I found them mentioned in a listverse article, here. So I went on a quest to find them somewhere else on the internet... and really couldn't find anything. I found a stub of an article on what looked like the Spanish Wikipedia, and then a bit on them in \"Working IX to V\" by Vicki Leon. However, from what I've heard, IX to V isn't a very accurate book.\n\nSo I'm at a loss here, and wondering if I'm just extremely gullible. Even though it seems rather far-fetched that something like this even existed, it *was* in Rome. I'm a high school student, and most of my free-time to study history has been spent on the American Civil War, or in 1200-1400 Europe. Apart from a few books I read years ago (like The Bronze Bow), and a couple of movies (Ben Hur, Gladiator), I don't know much of anything about Ancient Rome! So any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom different geographical areas you can find different kind of approaches to deal with the issue of getting air while diving. Aristotle does in fact, in Problems book 32, describe such a device which the article mentions. What exactly is meant by it is however difficult to say. But some have interpreted it to be a huge cauldron from which divers could return too to get some air, ie. a divingbell.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell\"]Wiki on diving bells[/ame]\n\nIt's most certainly not impossible."
