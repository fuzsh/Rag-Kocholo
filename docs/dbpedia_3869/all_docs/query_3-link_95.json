        "text": "I was reading one of Casson's books while waiting for [my daughter]... She was late, which would ordinarily have thrown me into a fever of apprehension, but on this occasion I was so wrapped up in the book, I didn't notice. In fact, when she did come back, quite late, I was annoyed because she had interrupted me before I had finished the book. I told Casson this, and he was infinitely pleased. -- Isaac Asimov I. Asimov: A Memoir Provides a suitable introduction to Egyptian society for readers newly interested in ancient Egypt or for use in a survey course. -- Vanessa Davies Journal of Near Eastern Studies 2006\n\nLionel Casson is a professor emeritus of classics at New York University and has written many books about life in the ancient world, including Travel in the Ancient World, Everyday Life in Ancient Rome, and Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World, all available from Johns Hopkins."
