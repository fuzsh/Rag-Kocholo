        "text": "September 18, 2022\n\nWell written and organized, helpful for the project I’m working on. Casson draws on sources by ancient Egyptians and their contemporaries to create a vivid picture of daily life in Egypt: clothes, food, labor strikes, romance, trade, and more.\n\nI did have a couple of quibbles with his approach, though. First, he has a tendency to stay with declarative statements even when scholars disagree on interpretation of certain sources. Second, I realize this book was originally written in 1975, but it was revised and expanded in 2001, so it’s a little embarrassing that Casson can report that both priestesses and priests served in temples for the same lengths of time but he can’t imagine what the priestesses do (since sex wasn’t part of Egyptian rites). The lack of rigor in studying the lives of people of all genders is a sad holdover from an earlier era and a gap in an otherwise interesting book.\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nThis book was very detailed while being a quick read. It was heavily laced with stories from Herodotus though, which is why I did not give 5 stars. Herodotus, while being known as \"the father of history,\" is widely known an an person who liked to embellish his stories.\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\nBrilliant, short little guide to professions, diet, religion and social order in ancient Egypt. Skins over the Ptolemy dynasty but main focus is the New Kingdom. Not an in-depth guide, but well written and enjoyable.\n\nFebruary 18, 2008\n\nIt's amazing how much we know of this ancient civilization's \"daily life.\" We know next to nothing about daily life in so many other ancient civilizations, but in this book we get a window on what life was life (mostly for the rich and famous, I'll grant you) for an ancient people.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 23, 2012\n\nThis is a quick, easy read that gives a general overview of Egyptian life. However, in the words of my Archaeology professor, \"It is...simplified,\" meaning that a lot of the information is not necessarily the most accurate.\n\nJuly 3, 2012\n\nI really enjoyed this book. It was a good summary history of Egypt and it seems like a very good introduction to Ancient Egypt. Casson covers The Early, Middle and Late Kingdom in enough detail to give you a picture of Egyptian History, but not too much to overwhelm."
