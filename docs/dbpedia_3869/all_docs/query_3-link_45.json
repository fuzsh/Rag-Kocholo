        "text": "Author/Contributor(s): Casson, Lionel Publisher: Johns Hopkins University Press Date: 02/01/1999 Binding: Paperback Condition: NEW\n\nIn Everyday Life in Ancient Rome, Lionel Casson offers a lively introduction to the society of the times. Instead of following the standard procedure of social history, he presents a series of vignettes focusing on the ways of life of various members of that society, from the slave to the emperor. The book opens with a description of the historical context and includes examination of topics such as the family, religion, urban and rural life, and leisure activities. This revised edition of Casson's engaging work, originally published in 1975 as Daily Life in Ancient Rome, includes two new chapters as well as full documentation of the sources."
