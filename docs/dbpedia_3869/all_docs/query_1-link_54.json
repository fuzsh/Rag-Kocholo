        "text": "I teach US History.\n\nMy conference period is 2nd period.\n\nI have tutorials after school on Mondays and before school on Wednesdays.\n\nI am so grateful that I am able to fulfill my dream of teaching. I have wanted to teach since I was a little girl, and so I went to college to become a teacher. Even though my focus has been ancient history, I am fascinated about the people who shaped the history of the United States. I love reading what people have written and seeing what they have produced, and I hope to share that love with my students."
