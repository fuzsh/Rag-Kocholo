Ann Ellis Hanson American Studies in Papyrology 33 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995).\n\nWith undergraduate training at City College (A.B. magna cum laude, 1930) in Classics and French, Lewis entered the Master’s program at Columbia University. He remembered the teaching as generally mechanical and uninteresting. Its high point was a papyrology course in the History Department with William Linn Westermann in the spring of 1932, in which the other students were Meyer Reinhold and Moses Finkelstein (later Finley), both to have distinguished careers. The course focused on the Zenon papyri in the Columbia collection, and Lewis took naturally to the text editing, Westermann’s weaker side. Prospects for continuing to the doctorate at Columbia after his M.A. that year were nonexistent, for Lewis had no money (and was offered no fellowship), and in any case the department was so uninspiring that he looked elsewhere. There was nowhere in the U.S. at that point where he could get the papyrological training he needed , and a providential fellowship from the American Field Service sent him to France.\n\nIn France, Lewis was taught by Paul Collart, whom he remembered as paternal and solicitous, for papyrology and by Gustave Glotz for history. His dissertation on the papyrus industry was publicly defended (with a grade of “très honorable”) before these two luminaries and André Piganiol; in its published versions (first in French, later in English as Papyrus in Classical Antiquity, 1974) it has become a classic monograph. His fluent French, on display on that occasion, was to serve him well throughout his career, including three terms as president of the Association Internationale de Papyrologues (1974-83).\n\nAfter the defense, Lewis held a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome for two years, and he was also a member of IFAO in the winter of 1934-35, with Pierre Jouguet and Octave Guéraud for mentors and Jean Scherer, his contemporary at the Sorbonne, as company. They all worked together on the Fouad papyri. That spring, Lewis traveled in the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean, including Palestine and Lebanon. Memories of a bus trip to Baalbek in a spring snowstorm, in the middle of which a train of camels appeared, were still fresh more than six decades later. He then went on to Istanbul, Athens, and Italy, culminating at the Florence papyrological congress of 1935.\n\nThe great depression was not an easy time to enter academic life, and Lewis pieced together part-time and visiting posts for two years until he found an instructorship from 1938 at New York University, where Lionel Casson, who was to be his lifelong friend, had been hired not long before. The department head, Casper Kraemer, persuaded Westermann to let Lewis edit the Karanis fourth-century papyri in the Columbia collection.\n\nDuring the second World War, Lewis worked in the War Department as a translator for the Corps of Engineers and as director of war research at Columbia. He continued at Columbia after his war service, teaching classics until he found his permanent position at Brooklyn College, where he taught from 1947 until his retirement in 1976 as Distinguished Professor, taking an active role also in the City University’s Graduate School in midtown Manhattan. In retirement he and his wife, Helen Block Lewis, a distinguished psychologist and psychoanalyst with a doctorate from Columbia, lived in Connecticut, with Lewis doing some teaching at Yale, summering as they had since 1945 in their house in Croydon, New Hampshire. Later still, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where their two children (Judith Lewis Herman and John B. Lewis) lived, became their winter home. After Helen’s death in January 1987, Toli suffered a heart attack and came back to normal activity only slowly, but he was eventually remarried very happily to Ruth Markel and, despite significant arthritic difficulties, traveled quite a bit, with Jerusalem and Santa Barbara favored haunts. Like his contemporary T. C. Skeat, he continued to write to the end and remained unceasingly interested in the work of others. Ruth’s death in November 2004 was a great blow.\n\nLewis’s voluminous work ranged widely, as can be seen from the bibliographies in BASP 15 (1978) 2-8 (prepared by Ralph Keen) and in Lewis’s On Government and Law in Roman Egypt (American Studies in Papyrology 33, Atlanta 1995) xi-xiii. Its core, apart from the editing of papyrus texts, is well described by the title of the latter book, in which many of his articles are collected, but one could say above all that Lewis was a student of administration, particularly of the ways in which the Romans used compulsory public service instead of professional bureaucracy. This work took final form in The Compulsory Public Services of Roman Egypt (second edition, Papyrologica Florentina 28, 1997), an indispensable work for anyone concerned with the liturgical system. His shrewd understanding of human nature, particularly in its administrative manifestations, enabled him to see the real functioning of the people and institutions behind the bland prose of official documents.\n\nAnother side of Lewis’s work is represented by his two books aimed at a wider audience, Life in Egypt under Roman Rule and Greeks in Ptolemaic Egypt, as well as sourcebooks: the sweeping and voluminous Roman Civilization (2 vols., 1951 and 1955, with his old Columbia classmate Meyer Reinhold) plus smaller volumes of translated texts on the fifth century B.C., the Roman principate, and the interpretation of dreams. Despite the seemingly parallel character of the two books on Egypt, the Roman book is much more thematic in nature, the Ptolemaic one more episodic and microhistorical, as a series of case studies. With their clear and graceful style, plus the teacher’s gift of fastening on interesting details, both have reached the intended broad audiences and brought the papyrologist’s work to a general public and to undergraduates (both have been translated into French).\n\nGiven his long study of administration, it is not surprising that Lewis was also a capable administrator and leader, serving as associate dean of Broooklyn College for seven years and then as executive officer of the classics program at the City University’s Graduate School and University Center. He was the ASP’s second president (1965-69) and in that role a strong supporter of the program of summer seminars held between 1966 and 1970. He was, indeed, deeply devoted to nurturing younger generations of scholars, whom he treated as colleagues, and unstintingly generous of his time in reading work and offering advice."
