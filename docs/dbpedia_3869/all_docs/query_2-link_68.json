        "text": "Theme\n\nJill Kitson: Welcome to Lingua Franca, I'm Jill Kitson.\n\nThis week: The Library of Alexandria and what came before. The American classicist, Lionel Casson, in the first of two programs on Libraries in the Ancient World.\n\nThe Library of Alexandria, founded by Ptolemy I at the end of the 4th century BC is the most famous library of the ancient world. Its collection of papyrus scrolls, said to have numbered nearly half a million, drew intellectuals from all over the Greek speaking world. It survived Julius Caesar's torching of the nearby dockyards in 50 BC to last beyond the era of the Ptolemys well into the 3rd century of the Christian era, when it was destroyed in a local uprising.\n\nIn many respects, the Library of Alexandria was like any of our great modern public libraries: it sought to be comprehensive, to hold authoritative texts on all subjects; works were catalogued and stored in alphabetical order by subject. The Library was open to all scholars. In other ways, it was like a research school and a scholarly publishing house: its scholars compared and analysed texts, translated them, wrote commentaries, and undertook lexicography and the study of grammar.\n\nLionel Casson is Emeritus Professor of Classics at New York University and the author of many books on ancient maritime travel. In his slim history of Libraries in the Ancient World, he devotes a chapter to the Library of Alexandria, the third chapter. What preceded it? Well, the beginnings are to be found in archaeological remains in Mesopotamia, the Ancient Near East. So when I talked with Lionel Casson at his home in New York I asked him to describe those earliest collections of records.\n\nLionel Casson: The earliest collections of records are the dim ancestor of the Library of Alexandria and other such libraries, because they represented what kings put together. What they did was keep palace archives mostly and gradually the palace archives which registered the palace business, came to include works having to do with religion, because much of the king's activities had to do with carrying on proper ceremonies etc., and one had to follow the religious rites. So religious matter was put down in some of these tablets, and from religious matter, the tablets branched off into mythological matter, and so on. And that aspect of these archives of Near Eastern kings, the religious matter, the semi-scientific matter, for example they had to reckon the days of the ceremonies to be carried out on, and not only the days but the times of day, the times of year etc., and that involved astronomical observation, and so you're beginning to have the core of what will be put into a public library centuries in the future.\n\nJill Kitson: Well of course the big thing that made them differ is the fact that the form of writing was cuneiform, where words were made up of wedges and lines scratched into clay of course, and it was a bit like Chinese ideograms.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes, they were like Chinese ideograms, but read like Chinese ideograms are, syllabically in many cases.\n\nJill Kitson: Didn't it mean that those who could read had to do, as with Chinese, an enormous task of memorisation taking years, which meant that only a small class or professional class of people could read and write?\n\nLionel Casson: Yes, the reading and writing was limited to the scribal class, the professional scribes, and also those of the upper class who thought that being able to read and write was a useful practice. But there was a slim level of them. The readers and the writers were the scribes, and the scribes were the king's assistants.\n\nJill Kitson: Well this is this great name, the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, and we're talking here the 7th century BC and he claimed to be the first king in his line to be literate, and as you say, he's the first undisputed founder of a library for his own use. And what an exciting find for the archaeologists who discovered it in the 19th century. What did they find?\n\nLionel Casson: They found enormous numbers of tablets, many of them of course dealing with palace business, which primarily interested people interested in the economic history of the area, but of secondary interest for those who were looking for higher literature. They found copies that Ashurbanipal had made of an old mythological story, or to them it was a religious story, of the hero Gilgamesh, and some of the episodes in the account of the hero Gilgamesh are very like the episodes, include an episode very much like the Flood of the Bible. This started great excitement when it first became known.\n\nJill Kitson: Now of course we have to include Egypt in these early collections of archives that were for palace and priestly use, but in the case of Egypt we just don't have the records.\n\nLionel Casson: We don't have the records because they didn't write on clay. Egypt is the land where the papyrus reed grows, the bulrushes that formed the cradle in which the baby Moses was floated in the water, and papyrus grows abundantly in Egypt, and from papyrus you can make an excellent form of paper, excellent form of paper. So the Egyptians did, and they wrote on it, but papyrus will vanish the way our papers vanish, and so we have none of the archives of Egypt.\n\nJill Kitson: So our next libraries in fact aren't until well into the period of Greek history, even though Greek civilisation began at Mycenae, and the Mycenaean Age is the great era Homer was later to write, or rather sing of, in the Iliad and the Odyssey, and when he speaks of the great halls of Odysseus and Menelaus, there's no mention of libraries or of books or reading, is there?\n\nLionel Casson: There isn't, but they had archives, palace archives, and we have found some of those archives at the site of Troy for example, or one of the sites in Crete. But unfortunately we found only the business side of the archive. We don't know whether the archives included mythological stories as Ashurbanipal's archive did for example. Perhaps it did, but we are not lucky enough to have come upon any of the tablets that came from it. So, up to date, no tablets which contain any of the stories, any of the material that we find in Homer have been discovered. Plenty of tablets have been discovered telling you how many numbers of sheep were in the flocks owned by the King of Troy, that sort of material only.\n\nJill Kitson: Now there's a sort of Dark Ages, and then comes the great flowering of Greek civilisation in the arts and sciences, and of course fundamental to them, libraries. But even more fundamental was the adoption of the alphabet. So when and how did that come about?\n\nLionel Casson: Some time after the 10th century BC. The Phoenicians had fashioned from Egyptian hieroglyphs we figure, or some argue, from cuneiform, but no matter, the Phoenicians had fashioned from one or the other, an alphabetical system. In other words, they had selected about 24 different signs which stood for different sounds. The Greeks took that Phoenician alphabet and used it for their own language, Greek, using about 24 signs. That took place some time in the 9th century BC, and that was a great step in literacy because it meant that all you had to do was memorise 24 signs, instead of memorising thousands of cuneiform figures.\n\nJill Kitson: And there does seem to have been, from the way you write about it, an amazingly quick take-up of the advantages of the alphabet, in making people literate; it wasn't confined to a small class, it wasn't kept as an elite skill. Almost immediately, it seems, in the space of probably a century, there are records of schools opening. Am I actually running away with myself here, or is this right?\n\nLionel Casson: You're getting a century a little too early. The schools can be dated at least to the early 500s, whereas the alphabet was probably available to the Greeks in the 700s BC. There was a 200-year span before we find schools. There's another great problem that's involved. For example in the life of the Homeric poems, they were not necessarily written down, they were sung after all, and they were handed down, we believe, from bard to bard, through a system of memorisation. It sounds incredible, but the bards were able to memorise thousands and thousands of lines of Greek and hold it solidly in their memory and be able to deliver the song evening after evening until they're through the whole account of a given part of the Iliad or the Odyssey. Certainly by 600 BC the poems were written down and written literacy comes into play, and schools arise.\n\nJill Kitson: Now of course not only were the great epics of Homer being written down, as you say the great savants of the period, people like the philosopher Heroclitus and others were both reciting their works and committing them to writing, and then we had that sort of turning point where you speak of Herodotus, who you say actually wrote his great History for readers, even though he then did recitations from it.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes, that's true. In other words, by the time of Herodotus, by the 5th century BC, we have books available, and of course without books the concept of a library doesn't exist. Books are available. The next step is to get those books and put them together in collections, and there were people who did that, people who built up private libraries. And in the 4th century BC Aristotle, the great philosopher, built up a huge library, a varied library of works, the biggest of its time.\n\nJill Kitson: Well of course we've left out the fact that not only had the Greeks adopted the alphabet which made all this possible, but they too had adopted the use of papyrus. But they wrote on scrolls, didn't they?\n\nLionel Casson: Well if you were sending somebody a letter, you just wrote on a little square of papyrus paper, but if you were writing a book, you took the squares of papyrus paper - it's made from the plant in pieces that roughly are oblong, almost the size of typewriter paper today - and you created a scroll by glueing the oblong pieces one alongside each other until you got a given length, several feet, or even more than several feet, depending on the use of the scrolls being put to. And for their books they wrote on scrolls. But there's another thing, that was the difficulty of reading those scrolls, you had to be a trained reader to be able to handle them, because there was no punctuation at the beginning, none at all, and even at the very end, minimal punctuation, and there was no word division, the letters just ran one alongside each other. 'To be or not to be' would be written without any spaces between 'tobeornottobe', it would be just written as if it was all one word, and that was true throughout ancient times.\n\nJill Kitson: Well just as a footnote to that, I interviewed a couple of years ago Paul Saenger, who argues in his book 'Space Between Words' which is the story of how the sentences came to be broken up, that in fact everything had to be read aloud, that there wasn't any such thing as silent reading in the classical world.\n\nLionel Casson: There was some, but it seems to have been relatively rare.\n\nJill Kitson: Lionel Casson, the author of 'Libraries in the Ancient World' published by Yale University Press.\n\nNext week, we talk about the Library of Alexandria and its legacy.\n\nAnd that's all for this edition of Lingua Franca.\n\nTheme"
