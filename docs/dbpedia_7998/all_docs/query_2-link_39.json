        "text": "Joel Thomas Zimmerman, aka Deadmau5, is an icon of electronic music, and his epic song, STROBE, is considered an absolute masterpiece of the genre.\n\nWhen we decided to do an acoustic cover of the song, we had to make some important decisions.\n\nThe style is inherently repetitive, so the arrangement had to somehow keep the drive without tiring out the players. This meant trading out some of the repeating licks between instruments and shortening certain sections."
