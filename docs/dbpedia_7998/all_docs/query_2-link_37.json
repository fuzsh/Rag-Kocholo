So it's best I just chill out a bit and just get it done, and get it done right until I'm 100% satisfied with it.\n\n\"Then our regularly scheduled program shall continue. I'm basically pretty miserable right now and need to pull back and figure out whatever it is I do.\"\n\nHis next scheduled gig is in Riccione, Italy, on 24 August before he plays Creamfields festival in Cheshire on 26 August.\n\nCurrently one of the biggest names in electronic dance music, Deadmau5 first had success with tracks like I Remember and Ghosts 'n' Stuff."
