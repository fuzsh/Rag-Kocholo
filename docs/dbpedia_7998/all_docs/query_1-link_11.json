        "text": "It seems like Deadmau5 couldn‚Äôt get enough of touring because he just announced his Lots of Shows in a Row Tour part 2! In support oh his recent album ‚ÄúW:/2016ALBUM/,‚Äù deadmau5 toured in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and did four nights + an after party in Los Angeles.\n\nThis time deadmau5 is touring Canada, his home country. The cities stops include, Alma, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto ‚Äî deadmau5‚Äôs hometown ‚ÄîVancouver, Windsor and Winnipeg. While these tour dates all include Canada, one US state gets a little extra show and that‚Äôs Colorado. We‚Äôre hoping and wishing he returns to Red Rocks which he hasn‚Äôt played to since 2013!\n\nDates and venues are still to be announced so stay tuned for more info!"
