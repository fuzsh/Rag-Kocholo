        "text": "I’m cool with the Mau5 these days–like I said above I used to be a popular electronic music hater–but the one thing that still irks me is this “we are all just pushing buttons” quote. I’ll preface this by saying I get that his fans don’t care that he isn’t DJing. They go to hear his music with a big light show. That’s fine. And frankly you couldn’t do a show like he puts on with a DJ who is more or less ad libbing a mix. And I don’t know what he is doing with Ableton when he is performing but going through a set list on Ableton (he might well be doing something things in real time or ad libbing bits and bobs) is 100% different than mixing tunes live and adapting to an audience.\n\nI mean the dude is famous for good reason, because people like what he does. But as a raver himself he should know there are some very relevant differences between how electronic musicians perform. Yea, all our performance devices have buttons and we push them but that is a vast oversimplification imo.\n\nEdit: to clarify I’m not saying one is better than the other just different performers are doing very different things on stage.\n\nHe did do some kind of live stream from his studio in the last week. Dunno if it was like a live jam or what. But I haven’t seen him on a flier in ages. Maybe Vegas residency?\n\nDeep thoughts with jack handey ahead\n\nSpotify listeners don’t really reflect popularity well, but I like to use them to see what ballpark they’re in. Skrillex has over 13M and Deadmau5 has almost 3M, so it looks like if anything, Deadmau5 is the forgotten one… or the one who forgot to pay for his bot plays last month.\n\nBoth artists have a ‘new content’ alert at the top of their page, so it looks like they’re both actively releasing stuff in order to stay relevant, or at least attempting to.\n\nDeadmau5 has shitloads of albums, whereas Skrillhead only has 2. I pressed play on the newest Skrillex and it’s completely unrecognizable from his early style. Being a dumb 21-year-old at the time of his heyday and even having some nostalgia for that sound, this stuff just sounds like absolute mush with vocalists repeating phrases in a chanting manner (not really ‘rapping’ so much). The next song just came on and it sounds like a really bad autotuned female vocalist, maybe like someone who won The Voice or X Factor and has absolutely no personality. Now the vocals are getting annoyingly looped again. This is bad. I hope you enjoyed my play-by-play listening experience there.\n\nNow it’s time to press play on the newest Deadmau5 LP. It sounds well-produced, like the stuff 13-year-olds use in the background of their tutorial videos. Although it’s better than anything I could pull off, it sounds like that background music that’s meant to be turned way down so that you can barely hear it. Play this in your store and I’ll probably spend an extra $5 because my brain is just barely being kept awake by it. Song #2 follows suit, it just sounds like music that belongs at the end of the movie. I’m waiting for a deep voice to say something like \"With great power comes great responsibility, spiderman:.\n\nSound-design is great here, and the songwriting feels formulaic and calculated for both artists. Guest vocalists never miss a note, nothing is ever out of sync, and it’s all perfectly autotuned and quantized if they do. It’s just so incredibly clean. This is the music robots would choose over our ‘human’ music with flaws, dirt, and nasty stuff. This is the exact opposite.\n\nI think the reason why I liked this kind of stuff when I was 21 was because I was drunk all the time. It just doesn’t do it for me because it lacks the distortion, anger and manly feelings that I resonate with. It sounds so happy or sedated and that’s like the exact opposite of what I am, so it’s just not a fit.\n\nWell, that’s that. Now I have to listen to a bunch of angry or fast white people music to cleanse my palette.\n\nI think the complaint a lot of old ravers didn’t like about Deadmau5 and Skrillex is that they were some of the first to bring the music out of the underground. A lot of what I don’t like about dance culture now are the mega festivals. Edit: I’ve been to them. Just not my thing. Also, its all stupid expensive. Sorry I can’t support a fest that charges over $5 for a regular bottled water and basically doesn’t have free water on site. At Ultra Miami (I wasn’t there) I swear a friend told me waters were almost $10.\n\nThere is still very much a dance underground where people are playing good house and techno if that is what one is looking for. Like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania around city centers have tons going on every weekend everything from “twue” techno and house, to commercial 4x4 to bass music.\n\n@Ramxes what is a super repetitive mainstream electronic song? I’m somewhat out of touch with all that."
