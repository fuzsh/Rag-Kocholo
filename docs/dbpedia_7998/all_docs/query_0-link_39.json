        "text": "Deadmau5 cancels Toronto show, reschedules as TESTPILOT\n\nFrom his two-part tour, marrying his fianc√©, and revealing the latest multi-million dollar version of his legendary stage cube structure, Joel Zimmerman has had a busy year. Better recognized by his stage name, deadmau5, the Canadian producer has just embarked on the second leg of his Lots of Shows in a Row (Part 2) tour, playing his first show in Windsor, closest to the Detroit border.\n\nWith unexpected obstacles in the way before his hometown show on the horizon, Zimmerman was forced to cancel his Toronto show, the second of the tour.\n\nDue to unforeseen production limitations at the venue, we have been forced to cancel the Deadmau5 show in Toronto on October 8th. As this is a home town show for Deadmau5, it is of paramount importance that all necessary production details are fully vetted in order to deliver the full effect of the Cube show. However, it has been determined by our production team that we will be limited from being able to put on the show properly. Deadmau5 fully intends to return to Toronto in the near future to present this show as it was meant to be seen.\n\nMet with disappointment by fans from across the province, Zimmerman was quick to figure out a solution and plans to return for a show under his techno alias, TESTPILOT. Accompanied by mau5trap artist Attlas for this one-of-a-kind occasion, Torontonians are in for a treat with the rarity of techmau5, and the promise of deadmau5 returning for a full-fledged affair in the near future.\n\nTickets for the event are available online.\n\nRead more:\n\nDeadmau5 partners with Blackcraft Cult clothing for new merch line\n\nInternet surfer stumbles upon deadmau5 touring equipment on resale website\n\nDeadmau5 reveals he is working on a new album"
