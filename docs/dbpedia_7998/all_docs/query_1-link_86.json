        "meta_description": "After bursting onto the scene in 2018, New York City-native, Westend, got his first taste of what it is like to be an up-and-coming artist on the US tech-house circuit and couldn’t get enough. The next few years he skillfully carved his upward trajectory with successful releases on tastemaker labels such as Solotoko, Techne, Club Sweat and Insomniac Records. In addition to strong releases, Westend received consistent support from global power houses such as Diplo, MK, Gorgon City, Claude Von Stroke, Joel Corry and more. Westend found a silver lining in the 2020 shutdown by working with over 500 aspiring tech house producers online via 1-on-1 mentorship and an open door policy into all things production. He now runs a production discord titled ‘Kick & Bass’ with a community of producers all eager to improve with his direction. Post-pandemic, Westend continued his rise, starting in 2021 with a fresh take of Musique’s disco anthem ‘Keep on Jumpin’ with fellow NYC producer CID, released on Lee Foss’s established Repopulate Mars. The tune peaked at #2 on Beatport’s overall charts for over 4 weeks and is approaching 9 million Spotify streams. Steamrolling into 2022 with his sights set on achieving the #1 spot on Beatport, Westend once again collaborated with CID on ‘Let Me Take You’ which turned out to be the crowning moment on Beatport amassing over 10 million streams in the meantime. Westend has also collaborated with HUGEL, Millean and Noizu with releases on Insomniac Records, Solotoko and Armada Subjekt. With a plethora of high energy, dance floor ready tracks, Westend has performed for sold out crowds from San New York all the way to San Diego.\n\nTo learn more visit: https://www.itsthewestend.com/\n\nThis episode was brought to you by VitaPlur.

From a young age, Jones’ always displayed an unmistakable inclination towards music. An only child of two musically gifted parents, Jones grew up in an environment in which he was constantly exposed to a diverse selection of music, and quickly learned to play the piano and drums very early on in his adolescent years. Infatuated by the hip hop culture of the late 90s and early 2000s, Jones traded in the drumsticks for a copy of FL Studio, hoping to test his hand at emulating the beats that were so instrumental during his teenage years. Citing unmistakable influence derived from the rich underground dance music scene native to Colorado, Jones soon graduated from hip-hop and redirected his artistic focus on producing bass music - a critical turning point in his ascent that ended up proving to be pivotal in the project’s life cycle.\n\nAfter the project’s inception in 2015, it didn’t take long before Jones’ began to see the fruits of his labor. In late 2016, Jones’ received the co-sign of dubstep legends TRUTH, releasing the ‘Bloccd EP’ on their Deep Dark & Dangerous imprint. The title track from that release, Bloccd, instantly made waves across the dance music genre and became a festival circuit anthem moving into the Summer of 2017. Among the acclaim gained from the Bloccd release was recognition from Circus Records label heads Doctor P and Flux Pavillion, resulting in Jones becoming the first North American producer to ever release on the London based label. While continuing to release his regular share of dancefloor bangers across labels such as Wakaan, DMVU quietly directed his attention to a new creative endeavor - writing his first solo studio album. These efforts culminated in Two Pairs of Eyes, Gazing Only at Each Other, released on Dome of Doom in April 2020. This body of work served as a testament to Jones true artistic range as a producer, showcasing an introspective, delicate side of him that was seldom reflected in previous releases. Continuing to push the boundaries of his creativity, Jones released Praise Be Delusion or, The Ripple in 2021, an important continuation of the cinematic sound Jones established in the previous year. The album received recognition at the highest level of music achievement, being nominated to the first round ballot for Dance Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards.\n\nMoving into the future, Jones continually strives to perpetually embody the core pillar of the DMVU project: risk taking. While Jones has repeatedly displayed his natural ability to produce at both ends of the dance spectrum, his next goal is working towards bridging the gap between the two. As Jones continues to work tirelessly towards the completion of his next album, he remains excited about why he started producing music in the first place: sharing the music that he loves with the world.\n\nThis episode was brought to you by VitaPlur & Lunchbox Packs.\n\nLunchbox Packs is the original anti-theft hydration pack, purpose built for live events, festivals, and life adventures.

From playing a range of instruments to writing music, production instinctively came next in his individual progression, leading to the emergence of the HEYZ project. Promptly garnering interest in his palatable dance floor techno from top labels such as deadmau5's mau5trap following his introduction to the electronic scene in 2018, HEYZ eventually began leaning into a more bass-heavy approach.\n\nComfortably finding his footing in unfamiliar territory, HEYZ' avant-garde take on bass music immediately cemented its rightful place, quickly attracting attention from all quarters of the community. Narrowly bordering the line between a contemporary and nostalgia-inducing sound, HEYZ has since released on a number of critically acclaimed labels, including Circus Records, Bite This, Lowly, and Deadbeats, only further confirming his natural ability to appeal to a wide scope of audiences.\n\nHand in hand with his skyward trajectory, HEYZ has also built an increasingly substantial fanbase through alternative channels such as TikTok, where he predominantly broadcasts his likable comedic personality. Firm in his whimsical ideology, he translates this seamlessly to the musical realm through his growing discography and live settings. With performances at large scale festivals across the nation among the likes of Electric Zoo, Imagine Music Festival, Red Rocks Amphitheater, and many more, HEYZ remains steadfast in his endeavors, proving his longevity in the dance arena.\n\nTo listen, visit: https://bit.ly/3Oj83Gx\n\nThis episode was brought to you by VitaPlur & Lunchbox Packs.

This fiery passion was first sparked in 2012, when her sister took her to a Skrillexperformance. Ever since, Roja immersed herself into the bass music scene as a fan, but sheeventually grew a desire to contribute more to the community. She then dove headfirst into DAWs and dubstep production, finding her creative calling with the Green Matter project.The Latina artist shines unforgettably bright among the Denver, CO bass music scene.\n\nGreen Matter stands as a bright neon bastion about the rest, attracting bass music fans of all genres.Her sound cross-pollinates the nostalgia of earlier dubstep and the constant innovation ofmodern bass production. Such talent impressed Circus Records, prompting them to release herremix of Conrank’s “Simulation Breach.” Indeed, at just 21 years old, Green Matter found herplace within the densely saturated Denver scene and developed a sound to flatten the Rockies.Although she mingles with a fanbase of “Earthlings,” her live performances are interstellar.\n\nWith the return of shows, she shattered speakers and expectations with her performance at Mission Ballroom alongside Bear Grillz.

That’s not due to any fault of his productions, but rather, purely due to his versatility. Once a mainstay on the legendary Anjunabeats and a rising star of new age trance shepherded by Above & Beyond and co, Jason quickly outgrew the boundaries of four to the floor grooves, expanding into the less finite space of broken beats and pop vocals of melodic bass.\n\nA blossoming working relationship with melodic bass propagator Seven Lions led to genre defining tracks like Higher Love and Ocean, backed up by beautiful, elongated and gently weaving trance discography featuring the likes of Cairo, Atlas, and his 2019 Anjunabeats EP Rooms.\n\nThe ability to weave the emotion and hypnosis of trance into the more commercial grit of melodic bass has made Jason’s recent catalog uniquely his own. His unique multi-genre tinged approach to production shines on genre-defining tracks like Shelter, his Blanke collab One More Day, his solo single Wild Ones, and his Gryffin collab After You, among others.\n\nHis sub brand - Atlas - is a moniker that defines who Jason is as an artist: worldly and all inclusive. Shying away from needing to stick to certain sounds or expectations, and instead choosing to meld genres and fan bases, Atlas aims to capture the range of Jason Ross by emblazing the concept on everything from merch to his digital fan groups to his 2022 full length artist album “Atlas”, released in August 2022 on Seven Lions’ Ophelia Records. Jason’s subsequent Atlas Album tour spanned over 30 cities across North America, kicking off in his homebase of LA at the Hollywood Palladium, his biggest headline show to date.\n\nTo learn more visit: https://linktr.ee/Jasonrossofficial\n\nThis episode was brought to you by VitaPlur.
