        "text": "On Wednesday, Dec. 21, Mayor Carolyn Goodman officially proclaimed Jan. 2, 2012 “deadmau5 Day” in the city of Las Vegas. The date marks the launch of an exclusive partnership between Wynn Las Vegas and the electro/house DJ from Canada. Deadmau5 will debut his residency on New Year’s Eve at XS Nightclub and will continue to play at both Encore Beach Club and XS through 2012.\n\nJesse Waits, co-owner and managing partner of XS and Tryst nightclubs, agreed that this recognition of Deadmau5 had to do with the masses journeying to the city of sin not only for gambling, but also for electronic music. In a statement he explained, “the following for deadmau5 is phenomenal, and I applaud Mayor Goodman for recognizing both his remarkable persona alongside his ability to drive visitor traffic from fans traveling across the globe to experience his live sets.”\n\nDeadmau5 has been recently nominated for three Grammy Awards. His LP 4×4=12 — which peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 and sold 243,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan – was nominated in the best Dance/Electronica Album category and “Raise Your Weapon” is recognized for Best Dance Recording. His remix of Foo Fighters‘ “Rope” brings in his third nomination in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category.\n\nWith EDM’s biggest names establishing residencies and massive festivals setting up camp, Las Vegas has been on the fast track to becoming the American Mecca of electronic music. The city has been quick to accept and recognize the economic potential of the growing genre. For instance on June 16, 2011, former mayor Oscar Goodman handed Pasquale Rotella – founder and CEO of Insomniac promotions- a proclamation declaring the week of June 20th “Electric Daisy Carnival Week” in honor of the festival relocating to Vegas.\n\n“Las Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world and deadmau5 represents the cream of the crop in electronic dance music, the hottest genre of music that has made an significant positive financial impact to the city this past year,” said Sean Christie, co-owner and managing partner of Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub, in a statement. “Mayor Goodman’s proclamation of ‘deadmau5 Day’ is an important symbolic acknowledgement of this wildly popular entertainment form that has come to define the best in Las Vegas nightlife.”"
