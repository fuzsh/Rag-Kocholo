        "text": "Channo - Underwater Heart\n\n​\n\nChanno is the work of Australian producer and vocalist Luchii, and Underwater Heart is a new single that captures a strange and disorientated feeling. With its weird, wonky bass and strung out guitars, Underwater Heart is a little otherworldly, the feeling of swimming alone in your own bubble, just hoping someone pops it. I love how it bobs along, the melodies slipping in and out of my mind.\n\nThe music here is deliberately mysterious, with Channo deliberately wanting to take a different approach at a time where everything feels fixated on content and exposure. Here he aims for mystique, conjuring an experimental and yet accessible sound.\n\nSo Underwater Heart is deliberately left open to interpretation. Even in making it Luchii found himself identifying things hidden inside that weren’t even initially intended to be there, interpreting it in different ways. The song started as a piece about pushing people out of your life - hiding your emotion beneath the surface and yet at the same time longing for connection... Waiting for something to happen.\n\nUnderwater Heart\n\nPlay Video\n\nBeth - Don't You Worry Child (Charming Horses Remix) (Official Video HD)\n\n​\n\nThere was a time\n\nI used to look into my father's eyes\n\nIn a happy home I was a queen, I had a gold throne\n\nThose days are gone Now the memories are on the wall\n\nI hear the sounds From the places where I was born\n\nUpon the hill across the blue lake That's where I had my first heartbreak\n\nI still remember how it all changed My father said\n\n\"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child\n\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\n\nDon't you worry, don't you worry now\"\n\nThere was a time I met a boy of a different kind\n\nWe ruled the world I thought I'd never lose him out of sight\n\nWe were so young,\n\nI still think of him now and then\n\nI still hear the songs reminding me of a friend\n\nUpon the hill across the blue lake That's where I had my first heartbreak\n\nI still remember how it all changed My father said\n\n\"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you worry, don't you worry now.\"\n\nSource: Musixmatch\n\nSongwriters: Steve Angello / Sebastian Ingrosso / Axel Hedfors / Martin Lindstrom / Michel Zitron / John Martin / John Martin Lindstrom\n\nDon’t You Worry Child lyrics © Sony/atv Music Publishing (uk) Limited, Universal Music Publishing Ab, Universal, Air Chrysalis Scandinavia Ab, Bmg Chrysalis Scandinavia Ab, Lateral Mgmt London Stockholm Ab, Publisher(s) Unknown, Kobalt Music Copyrights Sarl\n\nMythospheric BirthRight\n\nJai Wolf - Telepathy (Official Audio)\n\nSajeeb Saha, known professionally as Jai Wolf, is a New York based electronic music producer. He is best known for his singles, \"Indian Summer\", \"Like It's Over\", and \"Starlight\". He is currently signed to Mom + Pop Music. Saha was born on November 1, 1991 in Bangladesh. The following year, he moved with his family to the United States, and studied at Herricks High School on Long Island. In 2011, Saha started producing electronic music under the moniker No Pets Allowed. Within a few years, his mashups and bootleg remixes began to generate attention, quickly rising within the internet music community. On August 10, 2018, \"Lost\" featuring Chelsea Jade was released on Mom + Pop.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, Jai Wolf announced his debut album, The Cure to Loneliness, being released on April 5, 2019. Two singles from the album were released the same day, \"Lose My Mind\" featuring Mr Gabriel and \"Telepathy\".\n\nTelepathy is the ability to transmit words, emotions, or images to someone else’s mind. While there’s no evidence that telepathy exists, you can still give it a try. Relax your body and mind, visualize the receiver is right in front of you, and focus your thoughts on sending them a simple word or image. Take turns sending and receiving messages with a close friend or relative, and track your progress with a journal. With practice, you might be surprised to find you and your friend have a strong mental connection!\n\n1\n\nTune out your physical senses. Try playing white noise through headphones and wearing blackout goggles. Shifting attention away from your physical perceptions might allow you to focus more deeply on sending the telepathic message.[1]\n\nYou and the receiver should both try tuning out your senses. Sensory deprivation might help you each concentrate on the message.\n\n2\n\nStretch your muscles or try doing yoga. Trying to send a telepathic message requires a lot of mental focus, so try to become physically and mentally relaxed. Regular stretching and practicing yoga can help you learn how to put yourself in a focused, relaxed state.[2]\n\nWhen you prepare to send a telepathic message, try stretching your legs, arms, and back. Breathe in as you move into a pose, then exhale slowly as you stretch for 15 or 20 seconds. As you stretch, visualize all your tension leaving your body.\n\n3 - Meditate to calm your mind. Wear loose-fitting clothes and sit upright in a comfortable position. Inhale and exhale slowly, and do your best to clear your mind of unwanted thoughts. Imagine scattered, random thoughts leaving your mind as you exhale.[3]\n\nDo your best to focus your mind on a single thought. Try meditating for at least 20 minutes a day. With practice, it should get easier to focus your mind.\n\nOnce you’re in a calm, focused state, you’re ready to try sending a telepathic message. Keep in mind that both the sender and receiver of the telepathic message should relax and clear their minds.\n\nSending a Telepathic Message\n\n​\n\n1\n\nVisualize the person receiving your message. Close your eyes, and picture the receiver as clearly as possible. Try to imagine that they are sitting or standing right in front of you. See details with your mind’s eye, such as the person's eye color, weight, height, length of hair, and the way they sit or stand.[4]\n\nIf you are far away from the receiver, it might be helpful to look at a picture of them before you begin visualizing them.\n\nAs you build your mental image and send it to the receiver, they should relax and focus on being open to the message. Ask them to clear their mind and imagine you in front of them with as much detail as possible.\n\n2\n\nImagine how it feels to communicate with the person. Call to mind the feelings you experience when you interact with the person face-to-face. Feel these emotions as if the person was actually in your presence. Focus on these feelings, and believe that you are creating a connection with the other person.\n\n​\n\n3\n\nFocus on a simple image or word. When you’re just starting out, stick with something simple, such as a nearby object. Visualize it with as much detail as possible, and focus your mind solely on it. Concentrate on what it looks like, what it’s like to touch it, and how it makes you feel.[6]\n\nFor instance, imagine an apple. See a particular apple as clearly as possible in your mind’s eye. Imagine its taste and the feeling of biting into it. Focus your thoughts solely on the apple.\n\n4\n\nTransmit your message. After forming a clear mental image, imagine the object traveling from your mind into the receiver’s. Visualize yourself face-to-face with the receiver, and say to them, “Apple,” or whichever thought you’re transmitting. In your mind’s eye, see the look of realization on their face as they understand what you’re telling them.[7]\n\nKeep in mind there’s a difference between being focused and straining. Concentrate on the mental image, but stay relaxed.\n\nOnce you’ve sent the thought, release it from your mind, and don’t think about it anymore. Imagine that you’ve given it away to the receiver and are no longer holding onto it.\n\n5\n\nAsk the receiver to write down what comes to their mind. Once you’ve sent the message, the receiver should remain relaxed and open until they sense that a thought has entered their mind. They should then write down whatever has come to their mind.[8]\n\nBefore checking in with the receiver, you should also write down the thought you were trying to send. This can help you stay objective when you compare your results.\n\n6\n\nCompare results with one another. When you’re both ready, you and the receiver should show each other what you’ve written. Don’t get discouraged if you’re not successful, especially at first. Take some time to clear your mind, and then try again with a different image.[9]\n\nDon’t get down on yourself if you’re not able to send a clear telepathic message. Just try to have fun while you try!\n\n1\n\nTake turns trying to send and receive messages. Switch up your roles as you practice, and see if you have more success with one or the other. Maybe you’ll find that you’re better at receiving messages, and your friend is better at sending them.[10]\n\nKeep in mind it’s helpful to practice with someone you trust, like a close friend or relative.\n\n2\n\nTry playing a card game. Take five unique cards, such as playing cards or cards with symbols on them. With your partner in a separate location, pick a card at random. Relax and calm your mind, then focus your thoughts solely sending the card’s image to your friend.[11]\n\nHave your partner calm their mind and try to sense your message. When they feel an image has come to mind, have them write down the card you sent, then check your results.\n\n3\n\nDraw an image, then send it to your partner. Try drawing a shape or simple combination of shapes, like a circle inside a triangle. Focus your thoughts on the shape, and visualize the image traveling from your mind to your partner’s. When they sense that they’ve received the message, have them draw whatever shape has entered their mind.[12]\n\nAlternatively, someone else could draw an image and show it to the sender, who would then try to transmit it to the receiver.\n\n4\n\nKeep a telepathy journal to track your progress. Each time you try to communicate telepathically, write down the details of your attempt. Note who the sender and receiver were, what the transmitted image was, and whether or not you were successful. A journal might help you find ways of refining your abilities.[13]\n\nEven if an attempt was unsuccessful, note any promising details. For instance, if the message was “apple” and your friend wrote down “red” or “fruit,” that’s a great sign!\n\nEmil Rottmayer - MEGA\n\nUnfound - Reach\n\nOnly One\n\nPlay Video\n\nNature TV - Only One -\n\n​\n\n​When my weekend's winding down and she says come on over That's when you decide to call Chase my shadow to your house and by the time I get there She is ready by the door You are the only one You are the sun Hate to sink way below you That is my place You can see the terror as it spreads on my face Just sit tight and mind your manners boy For the waiting's easy The right thing if you ?? Seems so gold? now Nevermind you can say we get worn down To find some feelings in the dark You are the only one You are the sun Hate to sink way below you That is my place You can see the terror as it spreads on my face In the morning when I wake up to see you I'm amazed that it's real And it has such a way that I've come to portray an emotional man when I'm with you But it's all been my plan just to win you But she's not to be had or for winning And she's in such demand that I can't help but run around and round to do the things you want me to Do you want me to? Like I want you to? I really do\n\nNature TV. No, not directly something to do with Chris Packham - but in fact a great new band who have just dropped a really rather spiffing new track.\n\nSigned to Very Good label of note Heist Or Hit, the band are delivering new cut 'Only One' today, the second offering from forthcoming EP 'Emotion Sickness', which is set to arrive on 29th November.\n\nFresh off the back of a support run with fellow Dork faves and do-woppers extraordinaire Trudy and the Romance, they've got a hometown Brighton launch party on the books at the start of December too. It's all going off.\n\nWe tracked the band down to get a deeper insight into what's happening.\n\nHi Nature TV, who are you all, and how's it going?\n\nSolo: I'm Solo. Lead guitarist and producer for NTV.\n\nJosh: Josh here, I play bass. It's going good. Just returned from a hedgehog sanctuary... those little guys are great.\n\nGuy: I'm Guy, I'm the songwriter, guitar and vocals for the band. I'm on my lunch break at the shop, so this is a welcome relief.\n\nZal: Hey Dork, I'm Zal, I'm the drummer in the band.\n\nHow long have you guys been together then? You met at college?\n\nGuy: Well, in one form or another we've been together a while, we met at uni like 7/8 years ago. Then we boosted ourselves with Solo about a year and a half ago, and it's been a real treat.\n\nSolo: I've known Guy for two years from our day job. I wasn't at uni with these guys, but I wish I was!\n\nJosh: We've been playing together as Nature TV a little under two years. Guy and I met at uni eight years ago, where we played in a band with a drum machine. Then we met Zal around six months after and alas, our drum prayers were answered. Solo and Guy met in an outdoors/camping shop in which they both worked and then Solo came on board as producer, as well as lead guitarist.\n\nHave you always wanted to be a musician? Is it living up to the hype?\n\nSolo: Yes! I started playing guitar and have locked myself away, producing on my laptop since I was 18!\n\nJosh: Since about the age of 10. I used to really be into wrestling and wanted to be a professional wrestler... music took over where the dreams of the squared circle ended!\n\nZal: Yes, and I would say it does live up to the hype, but not because it's anything like what you think it's going to be when you first get into it. It's unique and has its moments of magic and its challenges, but I wouldn't want to do anything else.\n\nGuy: Well when I was 14 or 15 I wanted to be a teacher, but then I did no work at school so that plan fell apart quickly, but my history teacher told me to go try out for \"music school\" so I went for that. It was there I met the guys, and since then it's been full steam music, and even though sometimes it's a grind, it's a charming grind where you get to do a bunch of cool stuff with your mates!\n\nAre you all from Brighton, or have you moved in from elsewhere?\n\nSolo: I'm from Cornwall originally, which was amazing as it had so much natural beauty. I then moved to London before settling in Brighton, which seems to have a great mix of both places.\n\nGuy: We are from all over the south, really. I'm from West London; Josh is from Hemel, Zal from Diss, I think, and Solo stems from Cornwall. Something like that, I never speak to them.\n\nBrighton must be a great place to be an up-and-coming band?\n\nSolo: I'm loving every second!\n\nGuy: It certainly is, there is a bunch of music down here and who doesn't love the beach? It's now turned cold, windy and awful though so it's less going to shows and more staying inside at all costs.\n\nJosh: It's the best, it's the reason I moved down. But it's not just great for music; there's a whole range of creative industry hubs and amazing people. Living by the sea is also a massive plus, I'm not leaving until they make me...\n\nGive us the tl;dr of your time together so far - what have you been up to?\n\nGuy: Pretty much it's been recording the songs we had down, writing news ones and trying to play as many shows as we can. We've got more stuff about to come out and even more in the pipeline for next year. We just started working with our new manager, sweet Bernie, and she's been hooking us up, so that's great.\n\nZal: We've recently signed to Heist or Hit which has been amazing!\n\nJosh: We've been recording and gigging since we've been together and are super excited to get our latest batch of songs out with Heist. We have also been blessed with meeting Bernie (the angel of our dreams) who looks after us and also keeps us in line!\n\nSolo: We've just come off of a support tour with Trudy and the Romance which was dope, we had such a good time playing out on the road with those guys.\n\nWhat do you guys do for fun?\n\nSolo: More music! But also some reading, watching films and drinking cocktails :p\n\nGuy: Umm well I suppose I try and play sports I guess, I've been playing tennis and ping pong a bunch, but it's cold now, so that's out. I go climbing, I'm not sure I'm tough enough for it, but it is pretty fun. I try not to play video games, but sometimes you just have to. Then the usual, drinking and listening to music, I suppose. Not always together, and not always alone?\n\nJosh: Like most Brightonians, we're fond of a beach picnic and beer in the summer. Guy and Solo are super into their climbing, and we occasionally have a band tournament of tennis. In the winter, we sink our teeth into some DnD (it's really cool, honestly...). One Sunday a month I go and sing sea shanties in a pub with friends to blow the cobwebs away. It's pretty rousing stuff!\n\nZal: I lift weights for fun; it's like meditation and provides an element of discipline in an otherwise chaotic routine.\n\nTell us about your new EP, what's it about and when can we hear it?\n\nJosh: We're all really proud of the EP, we put a lot into it and can't wait to put it out on the 29th November. It's a mixture of relationship woes, both romantic and otherwise, encountered by Guy. It's called Emotion Sickness, so that gives you some idea where we're heading with it.\n\nGuy: The EP is called 'Emotion Sickness' which the more I think about it, the worse it gets. But we couldn't think of anything, and that one made us laugh. It's all about, well, the misadventures of my love life basically, but trying to approach them in different ways I hope. It's out on the 29th November, so we hope you like it!\n\nWho do you think is the most exciting band or musician around right now?\n\nSolo: Weyes Blood. The production on her newest album is impeccable. Also, I love electronic music and am super excited by Iglooghost and Dorian Electra.\n\nJosh: For me, I'm really into Stella Donnelly or Penelope Isles.\n\nGuy: I've been listening to Kate Bollinger this last week, it's dreamy, and her voice puts me at ease, so I'm into that.\n\nDo you have big plans for 2020?\n\nSolo: More music!\n\nGuy: In theory, yeah. Just record and play a bunch more new music.\n\nJosh: Lots more gigs, more touring and releases in the pipeline, hopefully taking in some new cities and countries on the way. Personally speaking, I hope 2020 sees a resurgence of my baking game... I'm told I make some seriously good brownies and think I'm ready to tackle a massive gateau or something.\n\nNature TV's new EP 'Emotion Sickness' is out 29th November.\n\nTOPS is a Canadian indie rock band from Montreal, Quebec, which currently consists of Jane Penny, David Carriere, Riley Fleck, and Marta Cikojevic.

It was released on July 13, 2018, as the first track on Deadmau5's EP and compilation album Mau5ville: Level 1. Robert Swire-Thompson (born 5 November 1982) is an Australian musician, singer, songwriter, record producer and DJ, best known as the founder and vocalist of the Australian drum and bass and electronic rock band Pendulum, as well as DJ and co-founder of electro house duo Knife Party formed of Swire and Gareth McGrillen.\n\nJoel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981), known professionally as Deadmau5 (stylized as deadmau5; pronounced \"dead mouse\"), is a Canadian electronic music producer, DJ, and musician, Zimmerman mainly produces progressive house music and sometimes other forms of electronic music. His works have been included in compilation albums such as Tiesto's 'In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza' and presented on Armin Van Buuren's 'A State of Trance radio shows. Zimmerman has received six Grammy Award nominations for his work. He has worked with other DJs and producers, such as Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire and Wolfgang Gartner. He has also collaborated with Steve Duda under the group name BSOD (Better Sounding On Drugs), and was part of the group named WTF? with Duda, Tommy Lee, and DJ Aero. In 2007, he founded his own record label, Mau5trap. Deadmau5 is currently one of the highest paid electronic music producers in the world, and is a masked music artist similar to Marshmello and Daft Punk. Zimmerman was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. He adopted the name Deadmau5, which referred to a dead mouse he found in his computer. Zimmerman is a playable avatar in DJ Hero 2, a video game released in October 2010. The game featured several tracks by the artist, including a mix of \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\" with Lady Gaga's \"Just Dance\". He is also featured as a secret unlockable character in the 2014 video game Goat Simulator. In the mobile app Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff by TinyCo, Deadmau5 was available for purchase as a playable character during the \"PeterPalooza\". On July 30, 2010, at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C, Zimmerman collapsed on stage, suffering from exhaustion and vomiting. This resulted in the cancellation of the rest of the show, as well as nine shows following the event. In September 2012, Zimmerman began dating American tattoo artist and TV personality Kat Von D. After breaking up in November 2012, they rekindled their relationship shortly afterwards. On December 15, 2012, Zimmerman proposed to Von D via Twitter, and they announced that they would marry in August 2013 with an aquatic-themed wedding. They both have several matching tattoos, including the numbers \"289m3d22h\" on both of their arms, a sentimental reference to the day when they met, as well as two black stars underneath their eyes. Zimmerman moved to Los Angeles to live with Von D. In June 2013, Von D announced that they had ended their engagement. On August 12, 2017, Zimmerman married his fiancée Kelly Fedoni. On October 11, 2018, Zimmerman announced a leave of absence, due to mental health and personal reasons. In 2014, Zimmerman purchased a $5 million home in the Campbellville area of Milton, Ontario. Zimmerman's father claims that when his son was in his early teens, he was chatting with a friend on his computer, which then abruptly shut off. According to Zimmerman's father, he said that it had a smell of burnt wire and had a strange odour. Zimmerman started to dismantle his computer and happened to find a dead mouse. Zimmerman then became known as the \"dead mouse guy\" among friends. He tried to change his name to \"Deadmouse\" in an online chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to \"Deadmau5\". \"Maus\" is the German word for \"mouse\" and is pronounced the same as in English; the ending 5 instead of an 's' is a form of leet. In a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone, Zimmerman acknowledged possible similarities between his Mau5head logo and that of Mickey Mouse, joking that \"someone at the Disney patent office fell asleep on that one.\" In March 2014, it was reported that The Walt Disney Company had filed a request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office o investigate Zimmerman's application to register the Mau5head emblem as a trademark, noting its resemblance to the figure of Mickey Mouse. Disney officially filed its opposition in September 2014, arguing that the mark is likely to cause confusion because it is \"nearly identical in appearance, connotation, and overall commercial impression\" to Disney's trademarked iconography of Mickey Mouse. In response to the opposition, Zimmerman attacked Disney on Twitter, arguing that the company thinks of people as being \"stupid\" because \"[they] might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse.\" Zimmerman also believed that he had been targeted by Disney due to their attempts to \"cash in\" on the EDM market, specifically alluding to Dconstructed--a recently released compilation album containing remixes of music from Disney properties by major electronic musicians such as Armin Van Buuren, Avicii and Kaskade. On September 4, 2014, Zimmerman revealed on Twitter that Disney had used \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\" in a Mickey Mouse \"re-micks\" video on their website and YouTube channel without his or his labels' permission, and posted pictures showing a takedown notice that had been sent to Disney by his lawyers. The letter also contained a trademark infringement accusation, arguing that the use of Deadmau5's name in material regarding the video falsely implied his endorsement of it. Disney argued that it had properly licensed the song and that there was \"no merit to his statement.\" In an October 2014 USPTO filing, Zimmerman argued that Disney has attempted to co-exist with him in goodwill. Zimmerman presented evidence that Disney had been in contact with him regarding potential collaborative projects, including an offer to participate in a \"re-imagining\" of Fantasia as a live concert tour for the film's 75th anniversary. In June 2015, Zimmerman's attorney stated that he and Disney had \"amicably resolved their dispute.\"\n\nRob Swire portrait by Swiralia on DevianArt\n\nRob Swire3 portrait by cherrymidnight on DevianArt\n\nMartin Solveig, Roy Woods - Juliet & Romeo -\n\n​\n\n[Verse]\n\nWorld's moving so slow\n\nGot my hand out the window\n\nLose track of time and memory\n\nLosing my mind in the palm trees\n\nGot me believing you're so shy\n\nYou catch me looking an you hide your eyes\n\nLeaving behind the reality\n\nBecome the cool of formalities\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou know we should be dancing\n\nTell me that you wanna go, dancing\n\nYou and me in stereo, dancing\n\nIntoxicated, this is how we wanna be\n\nYou and I, we gotta keep dancing\n\nOh yeah, sweating in the afterglow, dancing\n\nJuliet and Romeo, dancing\n\nIntoxicated, this is how we wanna be\n\nGirl, stop hiding\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n\nHiding\n\nOh-oh\n\nGirl, stop hiding\n\n[Verse]\n\nWorld's moving so slow\n\nGot my hand out the window\n\nLose track of time and memory\n\nLosing my mind in the palm trees\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou know we should be dancing\n\nTell me that you wanna go, dancing\n\nYou and me in stereo, dancing\n\nIntoxicated, this is how we wanna be\n\nYou and I, we gotta keep dancing\n\nOh yeah, sweating in the afterglow, dancing\n\nJuliet and Romeo, dancing\n\nIntoxicated, this is how we wanna be\n\nGirl, stop hiding\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n\nBaby, you know we should be dancing\n\nDancing\n\nDancing\n\nIntoxicated, this is how we wanna be\n\nGirl, stop hiding\n\nMartin Laurent Picandet born 22 September 1976), better known by his stage name Martin Solveig, is a French DJ, singer, songwriter and record producer.

At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single \"Levels\". His debut studio album, 'True' (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international dance charts; the lead single, \"Wake Me Up\" topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States. Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems, having suffered stress and poor mental health for several years. On 20 April 2018, Bergling died by suicide in Muscat, Oman. He was buried on 8 June in his hometown of Stockholm. His posthumous third album titled 'Tim' was released in 2019. Bergling's influences included Daft Punk, Swedish House Mafia, and Eric Prydz. He described his introduction to electronic music as \"listening to a lot of Daft Punk, way before I knew what house music was\".

The track remains one of Beatport’s best ever sellers and Purple Disco Machine ranks #18 in the online retailer’s all-time Top 100 Artists chart.\n\nSince then, the German native has continued to recreate his previous chart domination with a series of original tracks including; his collaborations with Boris Dlugosch on Defected, ‘L.O.V.E.’ and ‘Set It Out’, his collaborations with Aeroplane on Spinnin’ Deep, ‘Sambal’ and ‘Counting On Me’ featuring Aloe Blacc, plus his incredible double Pete Tong Essential New Tunes, ‘Yo’ on Kittball and the unforgettable ‘Magic’ on Exploited.\n\nAs well as boasting an impressive back-catalogue of solo and collaborative productions, Purple Disco Machine has also offered up remixes for numerous A-list musicians, including: Jamiroquai, Two Door Cinema Club, New Order, Claptone, Tom Odell, Faithless, Shapeshifters, Hercules & Love Affair, Sigma Feat. Paloma Faith, Blonde and most recently, Gorillaz – reworking ‘Andromeda’ off their latest LP, ‘Humanz’.\n\nHowever, it’s important to mention that Purple Disco Machine’s impressive disco house grooves might not have even existed if it wasn’t for his father introducing him, at an early age, to the classic funk sounds of the 70s and 80s. This early exposure had real influence on Tino and by the time he was a teenager, he didn’t just want to listen to great music but also play it, produce it and be connected to the scene.\n\nTino says “This was a really important time for me as I managed to land a job at a local record store and gain a DJ residency at my local club in Dresden. Neither job paid me any money but I could have as many records as I wanted from the record shop, so I had more than enough new music to play out on the weekend.”\n\nWith a rapidly expanding record collection and a DJ residency on-going, Tino craved to make his own music thus spending many years in the studio honing his sound and releasing tracks via a number of different projects/pseudonyms before giving birth to Purple Disco Machine.\n\nOutside the studio, Tino is a very in-demand touring DJ and his schedule has never been busier. Bringing his unparalleled sounds and unique mix of disco, nu disco, funk, house and deep house straight to the dancefloor at some of the world’s finest clubs, festivals and events in countries, including; UK, USA, Australia, Russia, Germany, Holland, Spain, France plus many more. Purple Disco Machine is also a longstanding resident at the hugely successful ‘Glitterbox’ events in Ibiza which continues this year, plus the talented German has recently made his debut at the White Isle’s iconic venue, Pacha.\n\nIndeed, 2017 is shaping up to be Purple Disco Machine’s most prolific year to date, with the announcement of his debut album, ‘Soulmatic’, forthcoming via Australia’s tastemaker label, Sweat It Out. Aiming to cover all aspects of ‘disco’ influenced dance music; the album will combine traditional disco house club tracks with funk, soul, boogie and indie disco jams. Collaborations include the likes of Faithless, Hip Hop legend Kool Keith, Bag Raiders, Duane Harden and Karen Harding as well as a number of very exciting newcomers. The album’s pre-campaign club-focused taster single ‘Body Funk’, released in early May, has set the tone and the bar high by becoming BBC Radio 1’s most played dance record of the month and scoring double #1 chart success on Beatport and Traxsource.\n\nThrow in a number high-profile remixes such as the aforementioned rework of the Gorillaz as well live dates in countries from Ibiza to America, and it’s clear to see why this year is one of the German funk machine’s most exciting chapters in his already illustrious career.\n\nPurple Disco Machine - Body Funk (Official Music Video)\n\nMedina - You and I (deadmau5 Remix) HQ\n\n​\n\n​Nothing left for me to say\n\nThere's no more wicked games to play\n\nIt's time for me to walk away\n\nI am allright\n\nI feel like I'm on a high\n\nA new beginning that is my life\n\nI'm turning to the rythm of the night\n\nI am allright\n\nThe music is making me growing\n\nThe only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing\n\nThere's no one here to break me or bring me down\n\nAnd no one here to hurt me or fool around\n\nI have no more time for you to hurt my feelings\n\nDone enough to prove I'm all that I believe in\n\nWe are at the end no more stupid lies\n\nI'm better off without you here by my side\n\nSo no there is no longer you and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nThere is no longer you and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nDon't care what other people say\n\nI know you fool around all day\n\nNow it doesn't hurt me anyway\n\nI am allright\n\nAnd when the day turns into night\n\nI'm in a club forgetting you and I\n\nAnd when I'm think of how you treated me\n\nYou proved me right\n\nThe music is making me growing\n\nThe only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing\n\nThere's no one here to break me or bring me down\n\nAnd no one here to hurt me or fool around\n\nI have no more time for you to hurt my feelings\n\nDone enough to prove I'm all that I believe in\n\nWe are at the end no more stupid lies\n\nI'm better off without you here by my side\n\nSo no there is no longer you and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nThere is no longer you and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nSo now there is no longer you and I - you and I\n\n(You and I)\n\nYou and I - you and I(I said you and I)\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nThere is no longer you and I - you and I(I said you and I)\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I - you and I\n\nYou and I\n\nMedina Danielle Oona Valbak (born Andrea Fuentealba Valbak, on 30 November 1982), known by the mononym Medina is a Danish-Chilean singer and songwriter.

She credits the late-1990s/early-2000s pop scene and 1980s Italo disco as her primary basis for her sound. Pop inspirations include Kesha, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, and The Spice Girls, as well as Boy George, Debbie Harry, Queen, Freddie Mercury, Judy Garland, Baby E, Lil Aaron, and Liz Y2K. In an interview, Petras stated that \"To me, pop music is an escape from my problems. I can put on my headphones and listen to it for three and a half minutes to forget about everything that's bothering me. It's always been that way for me. I feel like pop definitely saved my life in so many ways.\" On her songwriting, Petras told Noisey that \"there's something about making a song that everybody can sing and remember, and when you listen to it the first time you already know the words by the second chorus, like you've always known the song. I'm obsessed with that idea.\" She commented on themes, stating \"I write about boys, heartbreak, sex, having fun and the things that I go through.\"\n\nRoosevelt - Yr Love (Midnight Version)\n\n​\n\n\"Yr Love\"\n\nBring back your love to me\n\nHold me like you did\n\nWas never enough for you\n\nTake me back again\n\nBring back your love to me\n\nHold me like you did\n\nWas never enough for you\n\nFeels like we'll never be the same again\n\nBring back your love to me\n\nHold me like you did\n\nWas never enough for you\n\nTake me back again\n\nBring back your love to me\n\nHold me like you did\n\nWas never enough for you\n\nFeels like we'll never be the same again\n\nAll I ever know is the look in your eyes\n\nHold me like you did\n\nI never was the one to leave you aside\n\nTake me back again\n\nAll I ever know is the look in your eyes\n\nHold me like you did\n\nI never was the one to leave you aside\n\nTake me back again\n\nRöyksopp - Never Ever ft.
