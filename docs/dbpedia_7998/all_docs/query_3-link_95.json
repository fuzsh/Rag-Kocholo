        "text": "Joel Zimmerman, more popularly known as the outspoken and pioneering artist Deadmau5, has launched Beathau5, an electronic dance music label specializing in providing music exclusively for license to film, television, advertising and digital media. Beathau5 is a collaboration between Zimmerman’s Mau5trap label and Extreme Music in a deal brokered by UTA.\n\nAs the production library arm of Sony Music Publishing, Extreme Music places itself partway between a commercial record company and a traditional music library. Extreme provides exclusive productions from leading musicians, such as Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, ready to license for screens. Beathau5 is part of UTA’s partnership with Extreme to produce, market and distribute artist-driven production music libraries.\n\nBeathau5 kicks off this spring with five albums of previously unreleased music from five different Mau5trap artists.\n\n“Some will be from established artists and others will be from our new signings,” says Zimmerman, who is personally curating and compiling the albums. “Extreme is an excellent partner to get our selections in the hands of the right people. Creatives in the film and TV space will have access to some really unique beds of electronic music for their projects.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSays Extreme Music’s president and CEO Russell Emanuel of Beathau5, “We’ve done various projects with electronic artists, but we’ve never created a label which has volume. There are a million copycats and electronic music artists are losing out. Teaming up with renowned Deadmau5 and Mau5trap is a massive get. Our clients expect the very best and we cannot wait for them to get their ears on this.”\n\nZimmerman is no stranger to music for screens. Most recently he scored Netflix’s “Polar” and he has had his songs licensed to countless films and television series. Additionally, Mau5trap artist Maison Ware has scored Hulu’s “Spree.”\n\nDean Wilson, founder and CEO of Seven20 Entertainment and partner in Mau5trap, says, “Extreme Music is a forward-thinking company which fits in line with the direction we are going. Extreme’s easy to navigate system and direct access to the right industry music supervisors is a place where we are excited to have our Seven20 and mau5trap artists house our incredible stable of electronic producers.”\n\nThe Beathau5 albums will also be available for consumer use. Unrelated to the music being geared toward screens, each album release will have its own NFT created in collaboration with an established visual artist as a collectible item.\n\nIn the last year Zimmerman has become an NFT leader with multiple successful drops, including pieces with visual artists such as OG SLICK and a joint release with fellow Canadian electronic artist, Rezz.\n\nBeathau5 is the latest diversifying venture for the multiple-Grammy nominated and Juno-winning Zimmerman. He launched Hau5trap, a record label geared toward house music, in early 2020. Last month, Zimmerman started PIXELYNX, a technology company at the intersection of digital collectibles, gaming and virtual worlds, alongside another pioneering Canadian electronic artist, Richie Hawtin, aka Plastikman, and their management teams. On Halloween weekend Zimmerman brings back his Day of the Deadmau5 three-day event in Miami."
