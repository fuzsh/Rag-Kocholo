        "text": "Canada Day is quickly approaching but this year’s celebrations will be much different than previous years. Due to COVID-19, large public gatherings and home parties are being avoided to prevent further spreading of the virus. Luckily, virtual celebrations are in place to remember Canada’s unification back in 1867. The city of Niagara Falls is holding a large virtual event featuring several local musicians. Deadmau5 is one of the special guests, expected to give a massive show for Canada’s big day.\n\nDeadmau5 not only lives in the Canadian city of Niagara Falls but was born there as well. We’re sure he will have something special planned as it’s not every day one gets to perform for their hometown and country! Additional artists set to perform include Honeymoon Suite and LMT Connection. Interestingly, both these groups are also from Niagara Falls as well. Besides music, the city has stated games, prizes, and virtual fireworks will be part of the free virtual event.\n\nAll in all, it’s great to see cities adapt and create the virtual events to celebrate special holidays. While large gathering are not allowed, people still want to celebrate these yearly traditions. This virtual Canada Day celebration will take place on July 1st at 9AM/6PM EST. Wherever you may be, tune in on the official Niagara Falls YouTube channel here."
