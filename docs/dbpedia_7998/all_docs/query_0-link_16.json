The video didn’t come with many details so you’ll just have to sit back and hit play and see for yourself.\n\n*after update* – I found an older post about this place for sale before deadmau5 took over ownership which you can see here http://www.torontolife.com/daily/informer/gimme-shelter/2011/12/23/condomonium-160-frederick-street-unit-302/."
