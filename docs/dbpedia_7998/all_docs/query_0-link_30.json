This upcoming event, however, will hit especially close to home.\n\nThe newly announced show also features bands Honeymoon Suite and LMT Connection. Plus, other artists and buskers, magic and fireworks, and much more. Community leaders and citizens will come together to celebrate the country from coast to coast — virtually, of course.\n\nIt all goes down July 1st at 9AM and 6PM EST via the city of Niagara Falls’ official YouTube Channel and on select local Canadian stations.\n\nMore info here. See the promo below."
