        "text": "To a wide flock of electronic music fans, Joel Zimmerman is known simply as Deadmau5.\n\nWhile there is some speculation as to the exact origin of his mousy moniker, most have decided it emerged from computer shorthand for “Dead Mouse,” allegedly the chat room username he adopted after discovering an expired rodent in his keyboard years ago — these claims remain unconfirmed.\n\nRegardless of the origin story, most of Deamau5’s followers probably associate the slender, tatted-up, 43-year-old music producer with his anomalous onstage appearance. He is often caught bobbing to his beats in a glowing, oversized helmet shaped like a smiling, cartoon mouse helmet.\n\nIt’s difficult to know exactly what goes through the mind of the six-time Grammy Award-nominated producer who hails from Canada and has survived over a quarter century in one of the most trying creative industries known to man: music.\n\nEven more astonishing is how the prodigy has stirred up enough energy to develop his ‘Retro5pective’ shows that transport fans through time with selections of the greatest hits from his illustrious career, on top of new, unperformed material.\n\n“It’s just kind of like an extra long show of me trying to cram in as much as I can from day one to now,” Zimmerman told the New York Post in an exclusive interview, just a couple of days after playing the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nThe prolific electronic music icon is looking forward to putting on potentially even longer sets at the Brooklyn Mirage in New York City on Thursday, May 2 and Friday, May 3.\n\n“For the Hollywood Bowl, it’s probably the most unionized, crazy venue in all of America so we’re very constricted to time,” he presumed. “I feel like the Mirage is a little more loosey-goosey on how long I go over because it operates like a late-night spot.”\n\nMau5 heads can expect to hear all the hard-hitting electro house earworms like “Ghost N Stuff,” “Strobe,” and “I Remember,” but they shouldn’t be surprised if the artist also “stretches a bit” with some other less-anticipated works.\n\nThe expansive open-air sanctuary in Williamsburg certainly allows its performers plenty of creative freedom. But, if there is one thing Zimmerman is most excited about ahead of these Mirage shows, it’s probably welcoming a host of his closest friends onstage to perform collaborative material.\n\nZimmerman will be joined by Steve Duda, the other half of his BSUD project, as well as soaring vocalists HAYLA (Hailey Williams), Kiesza (Kiesa Rae Ellestad), and his long-time friend LIGHTS (Valerie Anne Poxleitner-Bokan).\n\n“It’s just me hanging out with my friends that I have worked with over the last 25 years,” he supposed. “Getting them all in one show is a pretty cool thing.”\n\nThe producer has a lot on his plate, but he doesn’t seem close to retiring his turntable. He clarified that “Retro5pective” is not a ‘goodbye,’ it’s just a look-back: “I can’t imagine people are thinking this is my last set of shows.”\n\nFor a closer look at where you can see Deadmau5 live this year, we have everything you need to know and more below.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDeadmau5 show schedule 2024\n\nA complete calendar including all North American show dates, venues, and links to buy tickets can be found below.\n\nDeadmau5 festival appearances\n\nThe party starter is also slated to spin at a pair of fests this spring.\n\nTo make sure you’re up to speed, here’s everything you need to know about the multi-day extravaganzas he’s dropping into over the next few weeks.\n\nDeadmau5 gaming ambitions\n\nWhen asked if he felt any burnout after a quarter century in the industry, he responded with a firm ‘No,’ followed by a chuckle and a hint that he may be a touch exhausted.\n\n“I didn’t get much sleep last night, but I am just trucking along doing my thing. Things have been slow the last year because I have been building another studio, and I got into game design, and technology design for show protocol systems,” he explained.\n\nMost longtime fans know that the producer lives a double life of sorts. Gaming is Zimmerman’s other lifelong obsession and he is quick to point out that it has inevitably overlapped a bit with his music.\n\n“I don’t know too many games that don’t have some kind of musical element or something like that,” Zimmerman shared, adding that he also listens to music while programming.\n\nIt wouldn’t be unreasonable to surmise that Zimmerman’s ability to understand and utilize technology has allowed him to evolve creatively as an artist and producer traversing years of musical trends and genres.\n\n“I think I am really tech-savvy, and when it comes to new toys and engines and protocols that come out, and then ways I can lend them to my will, to get them to do the things that need to get done for like show design or visuals or music,” he shared.\n\nDeadmau5 career reflections\n\nDespite headlining music festivals for decades, the ever-deepening reach of his mau5 brand, his undeniable commercial popularity, and his rare ability to consistently surprise fans, Zimmerman is still somewhat befuddled by his own success.\n\n“I mean I only expected my career to last three or four years, like 99.9% of everyone who gets into music,” he admitted.\n\nTruthfully, he’s not too sure what sets him apart from the other 99.9%.\n\n“I have no f—ing idea. Dumb luck. You know, circumstances, fate. I don’t know the universe dice thing. I don’t know…”\n\nWhatever it may be, he’s said that he is grateful to be in a somewhat static position for as long as he has been, and he wants the Retro5pective shows to be an ode to the last 25 years.\n\n“It’s a celebration with the fans who have been along for all, or most, or maybe a little bit of the ride, putting it together in a pot and making a fun little show out of it.”\n\nAt this point in the game, Zimmerman seems quite secure in his position. He shrugs when asked if he ever still gets pre-show jitters or has any specific process ahead of performing.\n\n“No, not really… It’s just like sitting in a dressing room eating a Nature Valley bar and staring at my feet until I am summoned, I guess. There’s no ritual.”\n\nPerhaps, that smooth confidence just comes with time.\n\n“I mean 25 years is a long time to learn how to do something,” he shrugs.\n\nHuge EDM artists on tour in 2024\n\nMany of the biggest names in house, dance, trance, electronica, and more will turn tables at venues all over North America in the near future.\n\nHere are just five of our favorites you won’t want to miss live.\n\n• Odesza\n\n• John Summit\n\n• Kygo\n\n• Tiësto\n\n• Dom Dolla"
