        "text": "Watch Deadmau5 go for coffee in his Ferrari below: (Warning: Video contains language that some may find offensive.)\n\nTORONTO — Canadian music maker Joel Zimmerman — better known around the world as Deadmau5 — took his fans around the world for a ride on Tuesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old native of Niagara Falls, Ont., who lives in Toronto, posted a video on YouTube showing him behind the wheel of his white Ferrari.\n\nEntitled “COFFEE RUN!,” the 15-minute video shows the star driving out of his condo’s parking garage and around the city while blaring heavy metal music on the stereo.\n\nDeadmau5 notices at least four police officers during his urban road trip.\n\nEarly in the video, a Toronto Police cruiser stops to let Deadmau5 make a left-hand turn. Later, Deadmau5 lowers his window when he sees an officer approaching him.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“Did you guys see that? I thought he was going to give me s***. I thought he was going to be like, ‘You know what? F*** you, Zimmerman.’ Sometimes they get like that but he was cool.”\n\nTrending Now\n\nConvicted rapist Steven van de Velde cries in post-Olympics interviews\n\nMpox is on the rise. What Canadians need to know as the virus spreads\n\nDeadmau5 pulls into a Tim Horton’s drive-thru, orders an extra large double-double and waits in the line of less-luxurious vehicles.\n\nLater, Deadmau5 was spotted in Toronto’s tony Yorkville shopping district.\n\nCoffee is, apparently, the strongest drink the Grammy winner is consuming these days.\n\nOn Monday, he tweeted: “I’m almost a year sober. I don’t even miss drinking really. It got boring.”"
