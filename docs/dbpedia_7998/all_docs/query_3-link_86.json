        "text": "Parking at the Bowl is extremely limited and may sell out in advance!\n\nPark & Ride and Bowl Shuttle are the easiest ways to get to the Bowl.\n\nAll parking lots are stack parked and there is no early exit. Lots open three hours before the start of each event. If inventory is still available, cashiers accept cash or credit card.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: As a courtesy to our neighbors, do not park in the neighborhoods surrounding the Hollywood Bowl. Doing so could result in a costly parking ticket.\n\nPREMIER PARKING\n\nDonor Valet Parking\n\nDonor Valet Parking at the Hollywood Bowl is one of the most exclusive and sought-after benefits available to valued donors of the LA Phil and Hollywood Bowl.\n\nLearn More\n\nPlease note that valet parking for lease events is not available in advance and is at the discretion of the visiting artist. When available it can only be purchased by cash for $90 at the entrance to the parking lot. For further information about lease events, visit billsilvaentertainment.com/hollywood-bowl"
