        "text": "The producer with the mau5 mask has been on the electronic music frontier for nearly two decades, but The Virus That Shall Not Be Named has made him reassess his work-life balance.\n\nDeadmau5, real name Joel Zimmerman, has seemingly been as busy as ever during lockdown. Over the past year or so he's pumped out collabs with The Neptunes, Kiesza, and most recently, with Lights on ‘When The Summer Dies’. But #pandemiclife has also given him new perspective on his previously hard-touring lifestyle.\n\n“Now I’m getting a taste of just being at home and being able to sit down with my thoughts on the future, I’m foreseeing a bit of a withdrawal from… business as usual shall we call it,” he told triple j Good Nights.\n\n“I turned 40 this year and that gave me some thoughts,\" he continued.\n\n'That didn’t take long getting from 30 to 40!'\n\n“I’m also starting to pull back the reins a bit… All this time to administer things has also given me the opportunity to culminate new artists and work with the next batch coming up. I’ve been having a lot of fun doing that because am I going to be bouncing around in a mouse head when I’m 50? Not likely.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean he’d be calling it quits – ‘I’ll never retire,” he insisted - just that the future of Deadmau5 meant slowing down his live presence.\n\n“I’ll never stop doing what I do but there will be a point where I’m just going to do the shows I want, in terms of number of shows per year, and that makes room for a lot of new, which is great. And I get to slow down and enjoy my life a little more than the touring stuff, because it’s always been this big misbalance between being Deadmau5 and being Joel.”\n\nOne field Deadmau5 has been moving further into is the intersection of music and gaming technology. “I’ve always been involved in those types of endeavours, but the pandemic has forced so many people online into emerging technology and of course videogaming,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always had the same level of interest in being part of the – that gross word everyone’s saying – metaverse of online interactive experiences …where people can jump into a system of sorts and connect virtually or as avatars or in a game engine. That’s always been a vision in my head. It’s just…\n\n“Who paid attention that when there was a festival every week? But boy did they go running and screaming into that world when there was no places to perform.”\n\nEarlier this year, the producer co-launched digital collectibles platform Pixelynx, and was among the first to perform inside Fortnite (alongside Steve Aoki and Dillon Francis) following Travis Scott's blockbuster 2020 debut reaching over 12 million players.\n\nHe's since partnered with Core, a free-to-play online game with an integrated system for crafting videogame environments. Together, they hosted a competition for content creators to make in-game worlds for the music video to Lights collab 'When The Summer Dies'.\n\n“We’ve picked our fave ones then fly a video camera through it,\" he explained. \"Have Lights and Deadmau5 avatars exploring this world with cutscenes. Then they go from world to world – it’s a gaming pub crawl accompanied by the soundtrack of ‘When The Summer Dies’!”\n\nAsked about grouping his recent collaborative bangers next to each other on an album, Deadmau5 remarked: “One day, maybe [but] what’s the point of that? I’ll just do new stuff. I am tucking away some gems for a body of work that may or may not ever come out.”"
