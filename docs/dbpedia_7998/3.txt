TORONTO — Canadian music star deadmau5 is doing a rare hometown gig Wednesday to mark the launch of Microsoft’s Surface 2 — and tickets can be had for free.

“Surfacing in Toronto, Canada tomorrow,” deadmau5 tweeted Tuesday.

The show will take place at Kool Haus, with doors opening at 7 p.m. Tickets will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis at the venue.

Fans can also get free tickets by tweeting @MicrosoftCanada with the hashtag #surfacehaslanded and the reason they love the Surface.

Street teams will also be giving away tickets throughout the city.

Born in Niagara Falls, Ont., deadmau5 — whose real name is Joel Zimmerman — currently lives in Toronto. His most recent release, Album Title Goes Here, was nominated for a Grammy.
