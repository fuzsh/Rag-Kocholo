World famous Canadian producer and DJ Deadmau5 has a crazy nice penthouse in his hometown of Toronto. This city is known for its lush condos just like its western rival of Vancouver. The video didn’t come with many details so you’ll just have to sit back and hit play and see for yourself.

*after update* – I found an older post about this place for sale before deadmau5 took over ownership which you can see here http://www.torontolife.com/daily/informer/gimme-shelter/2011/12/23/condomonium-160-frederick-street-unit-302/.
