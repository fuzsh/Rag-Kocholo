It seems like Deadmau5 couldn’t get enough of touring because he just announced his Lots of Shows in a Row Tour part 2! In support oh his recent album “W:/2016ALBUM/,” deadmau5 toured in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and did four nights + an after party in Los Angeles.

This time deadmau5 is touring Canada, his home country. The cities stops include, Alma, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto — deadmau5’s hometown —Vancouver, Windsor and Winnipeg. While these tour dates all include Canada, one US state gets a little extra show and that’s Colorado. We’re hoping and wishing he returns to Red Rocks which he hasn’t played to since 2013!

Dates and venues are still to be announced so stay tuned for more info!
