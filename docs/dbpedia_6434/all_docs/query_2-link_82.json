        "text": "Katie Price and Danielle Lloyd have buried the hatchet after falling out last year, according to reports.\n\nThe pair were said to have locked horns after the former Miss Liverpool, 39, accused The Pricey, 44, of being 'insecure' in Channel 5's Shameless: The Rise And Fall of Katie Price.\n\nFuming Katie hit back over the show, saying: \"The people involved who were supposed to be my friends aren't my friends and don't know anything about me.\"\n\nHowever, it looks like the women are pals again.\n\nA source said: \"Katie and Danielle have made amends after having a chat to clear the air. Danielle was the only contributor on the show who stuck up for Kate and said nice things about her, and Katie realises that now.\n\n\"Danielle explained that the show was sold to her as being about feminism and Katie changing the face of the noughties, but then the programme ended up being something quite different,\" reports The Sun.\n\nWhen asked what she thought about the OnlyFans star in the documentary, Danielle said: \"Katie seems like a strong woman, but actually she's insecure and gone through so much.\n\n\"You can only stay with someone for so long for the sake of children.\"\n\nHowever, Katie took a swipe at \"disloyal friends\" after the programme aired, saying: \"Hey everyone, apparently there is a documentary on me tonight, I think it's just started, called Shameless: The rise and fall of me.\n\n\"I just wanted you to know that I've had nothing to do with it.\"The people involved who were supposed to be my friends aren't my friends and don't know anything about me.\"\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Katie was clearly taking a dig at Danielle in that video.\"\n\nDanielle was said to have cooled her friendship with Katie last year following the mum-of-five's drink driving crash.\n\nA source told the Mirror: “Katie has had a solid group of girls around her for the best part of a decade but now many of her long-term friends are finally cutting ties.\n\n“They all still love and care for her but feel that they can’t be mates with her at this point.\n\n“For Danielle, the turning point was Katie’s drink driving crash last September. As a mum she just found it hard. She ended up unfollowing her on Instagram.\n\n“It’s that on top of other things which has meant that the pair have just drifted apart.”\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Katie's reps for comment. Danielle's rep declined to comment."
