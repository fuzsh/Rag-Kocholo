        "text": "A bittersweet tale of sibling rivalry about a couple of polar-opposites endeavoring to bury the hatchet for the sake of their rapidly-expiring dad.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 24, 2014\n\nAlthough the subject is potent, the film, directed with a seemingly effortless commercial acumen, doesn't burrow deeply.\n\nFull Review | May 22, 2014\n\nWhile [Grand Dpart's] protagonist spends most of his time onscreen wringing his hands, the filmmakers barely seem to have lifted a finger.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.0/5 | May 22, 2014\n\nThe accouterments are incessantly elegant but do not disguise the hollowness at the heart of this labored family study.\n\nFull Review | May 21, 2014\n\nThe director, Nicolas Mercier, has failed to grasp how repellent his own protagonist seems to us.\n\nFull Review | May 20, 2014"
