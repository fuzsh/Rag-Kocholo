        "text": "Angelina Jolie‘s off-again,on-again relationship with her father, actor Jon Voight, is on again.\n\n“Jon and I have gotten to know each other — through grandchildren now — [and] we’re finding a new relationship,” the 42-year-old actress, who is promoting her fourth directorial effort, First They Killed My Father, tells Scott Feinberg on THR‘s Awards Chatter podcast (which can be downloaded via THR.com/TheRace). “We’ve had some difficulties, [but] through art we’ve been able to talk. It’s the common language.”\n\nTheir difficulties reached a nadir in 2002, shortly after Voight and Jolie starred together as father and daughter in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, when Voight gave an interview to Access Hollywood and claimed that Jolie had “serious mental problems.” Jolie responded by legally dropping “Voight” from her name, though she had never used it professionally (“I wanted to have my own identity — I didn’t want to walk into a room as ‘Jon’s daughter,'” she explains).\n\nFor now, though, Jolie and her famously conservative dad seem to have figured out the secret of keeping filial peace. “We don’t really talk politics well,” she says. “We talk art very well.”"
