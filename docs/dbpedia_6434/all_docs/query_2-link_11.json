Bury the Hatchet features three Mardi Gras Indian Chiefs in a dynamic and intimate portrait of the unique, endangered and often hidden New Orleans experience they represent.\n\nWINNER! Grand Prize Award & Intangible Culture Award at the Royal Anthropological Institute's Festival of Ethnographic Film, and Best Louisiana Feature at the New Orleans Film Festival\n\nAbout the film\n\nBury the Hatchet is a portrait of three Mardi Gras Indian “Big Chiefs” of New Orleans, descendants of runaway slaves taken in by the Native Americans of the Louisiana bayous. Once plagued by intertribal violence, today these African American tribes take to the backstreets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras, dressed in elaborate Native American influenced costumes that they sew over the course of\n\nthe year. When tribes meet instead of attacking each other with hatchets and knives, they battle over which Chief has the prettiest suit.\n\nThe film follows the Mardi Gras Indians over the course of five years, both pre and post Hurricane Katrina, and is an exploration of their art and philosophies, as well as their struggles within their communities: harassment by the police, violence amongst themselves, gentrification of their neighborhoods, disinterested youth, old age and natural disaster.\n\nFilmmaker Aaron Walker gained intimate entry into this often hidden New Orleans experience and discovered not only a fascinating and beautiful culture but endearing characters and a truly dramatic narrative. The film is the story of the unique and endangered culture of New Orleans they represent as bearers of tradition, artists, musicians, and warriors who have laid down their weapons, but not their determination to survive as a people. With a celebratory soundtrack of New Orleans music and additional scoring by pianist George Winston, the film is an intimate entry into this often hidden New Orleans experience.\n\nDistributed by 7th Arts Releasing."
