        "text": "Kim and Kourtney put their \"feuding sisters\" storyline to rest in this week's episode of The Kardashians, with Kourtney admitting that they \"both said things that [they're] not proud of\" and Kim assuring the concerned public that they're \"not fighting like that forever.\"\n\nRelated: Relive Kim and Kourtney's Explosive Phone Call\n\nIf the edit is to be believed, Kourtney was the first to extend an olive branch. She texted her sister a picture of their father, Robert Kardashian, while Kim was in—where else?—Milan. \"I feel like this is a step in the right direction of moving past [our fight] and moving past all of the drama,\" Kim said, adding that she wished Kourtney was there with her for the launch of her Dolce & Gabbana collection. (How many times is this collection gonna launch? Kim herself had to explain that the previous runway show was merely an \"announcement.\")\n\n>>> Sign up for Parade's Daily newsletter and get the scoop on the latest TV news and celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox <<<\n\nKourtney mostly brushed off their explosive argument, saying, \"Anyone who has sisters or siblings knows that dynamic.\"\n\n\"You could get into a crazy fight and then, you know, you could send each other a funny text and everything's all good,\" she explained.\n\nTrue. But that's essentially the conclusion the two came to last time they fought over Kim's decision to collaborate with D&G, in Season 3, and their hard feelings only resurfaced after they watched a cut of the show. Who's to say they're not going to scroll past their infamous phone call on TikTok and get mad all over again?\n\nRelated: Pregnant Kourtney Kardashian Leaves Little to the Imagination in Sheer Dress\n\nKourtney did, after all, call Kim a \"narcissist\" who \"cannot stand someone else being the center of attention\" and Kim did, after all, tell Kourtney that nobody, not even her friends, thinks she's happy. Sounds like they have some deep-seated issues to work through, and what better place for them to do that than on television, where all of us can watch?"
