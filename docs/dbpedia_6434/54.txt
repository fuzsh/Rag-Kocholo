Bury the Hatchet is the portrait of three Mardi Gras Indian “Big Chiefs” of New Orleans, descendants of runaway Slaves whose ancestors were given harbor by the Native Americans of the Louisiana bayous. Today there are a number of African-American tribes that run in the city’s backstreets during Mardi Gras, attired in elaborate costumes which they sew over the course of the year. The film follows the Mardi Gras Indians over five years, pre and post Hurricane Katrina, and is an exploration of their struggles against the police, violence amongst themselves, gentrification of their neighborhoods, disinterested youth and natural disaster.
