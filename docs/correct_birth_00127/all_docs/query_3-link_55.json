        "text": "Seles at the 2001 US Open\n\nMonica Seleš (born Dec 2, 1973) (Hungarian spelling: Szeles M�nika), an ethnic Hungarian born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Montenegro), is a noted female tennis player and the winner of many competitions including nine Grand Slam titles.\n\nSeles was initially coached by her father Karolj Seles. In 1986, she left Yugoslavia for the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy at Florida. She practised there for two years before joining the professional tour.\n\nShe won the Australian Open in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996; the French Open in 1990, 1991, and 1992; and the US Open in 1991 and 1992).\n\nOn April 30, 1993, she was stabbed on court by G�nter Parche, a 38-year-old German who was a deranged fan of her principal rival at that time, Steffi Graf. Seles, who was ranked No. 1 in the world at the time of the attack, did not play competitively again for more than two years. During her layoff, she became a United States citizen. Although she won the Australian Open within months of her return, and has remained a consistent Top 10 performer, she struggled psychologically with the death of her father in 1998 and physically with a series of nagging injuries.\n\nThe 5' 9\" Seles plays left-handed, and uses two hands on both her forehand and backhand. Even more unusually, she does not change her grip when switching sides; she actually hits her forehand cross-handed.\n\nOne of the trademarks of Seles' play was her grunt when she hit the ball. The grunt was part of a controversy when an opponent Katerina Maleeva officially complained and asked Seles not to grunt during the game.\n\nAlso see List of female tennis players"
