        "text": "The Early Years\n\nMonica was born on December 2, 1973 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia to parents Karolj and Esther Seles. Monica is the youngest of two children. Her brother Zoltán, was 8 years old when Monica was born. Tennis first caught the eye of Monica when she was six years old because Zoltán became interested in the sport, and was bringing home cool looking trophies. Tennis was not a popular sport in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia at that time. So Karolj had to drive to Italy nearly 10 hours away just to pick up racquet’s for his children. Novi Sad only had 4 clay tennis courts to play on, which made it really tough for Monica & Zoltán to get a court to practice on. So Monica, Zoltán, & their father practiced a lot in the parking lot or up against the wall of their apartment complex. It all started in that parking lot in Novi Sad.\n\nAt the time, Karolj worked as an artist/cartoonist to make money to support his family and Esther also worked to support the household. To make tennis fun for Monica, he used to draw Tom & Jerry cartoons on the tennis balls. He made tennis fun for her! While Monica was still learning; Zoltán after only a short time playing, became a top junior player in Europe. This was the beginning of Monica’s tennis career, this little girl who just loved to hit the ball. Little did they know at that time that Monica would go on to become one of tennis’ all time greats.\n\nBy the time she was 8, she had become the number 1 junior player in Yugoslavia. In the following two years, she had become the best junior player in the world.\n\nNick Bolletteri first saw 11 year old Monica at the Sport Goofy tournament at Disney world in Florida. Nick and the Seles family met shortly afterwards and he invited her to come train with him for 2 weeks at his academy in Florida (for her to see what his academy was like). Unfortunately it cost a lot of money to attend and the Seles’ were not ready for that. But one year later, Nick and Monica met up again and he offered Monica a scholarship to come train with him in Florida. At this time, Monica was the #1 junior player in the world and had already won the Junior World Championships a couple of times. This time, he offered for her to come train at his academy for free – he just wanted her to train there no matter what, she was too good to pass.\n\nAt the age of 12, Monica and her brother left Novi Sad for Florida. While in Florida and out of her father’s supervision & coaching, Monica began to lose part of her game because she was feeling homesick and missing her parents. So a few months later, Karolj took a leave of absence from work and came to visit Monica at the Academy to see how things were going, and was not happy to discover that her confidence in herself and game had fallen off. He then decided that he would stay and work with Monica. By 1987 with her dad there supporting and coaching her (as well as Nick Bollettieri at times), she had gotten her ground strokes and her confidence back on track.\n\nMonica played her first Professional tournament as an Amateur in March of 1988 at the Virginia Slims of Florida, at the age of 14. She won her first match 7-6, 6-3! At the match, Steffi Graf, Gabriela Sabatini, and Chris Evert (who was to play Monica next if she were to win), all came to watch and see just who was this girl! Monica lost to Evert in the next round, but it definitely got the tennis world whispering. After that tournament, she only played 2 more tournaments as an Amateur that year, reaching the Semi-finals at the Virginia Slims of New Orleans and ending with a 5-3 win/loss record for the year.\n\n1989\n\nOn February 13, 1989, at 15 years old, Monica turned professional and entered the WTA rankings at #88 in the world. In only her 2nd tournament as a pro, she won her first WTA Singles Title in Houston, TX, by winning her rematch over Chris Evert in the final, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. This was the start of Monica’s professional career and she never looked back!\n\nIn her first Grand Slam attempt, the 1989 French Open, Monica fought her way through to the semifinals (defeating world No. 5 Zina Garrison and No. 7 Manuela Maleeva), to play the then #1 player in the world, Steffi Graf. Although Steffi won in a tough 3 set match, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, Monica’s first Grand Slam attempt was an awesome display of what was to come in the following year. Her ranking improved to No.14 after her semifinal feat, and then she also reached the 4th round at Wimbledon and the US Open. In September, she broke into the Top 10 for the first time, less than a year after debuting in the rankings. At the end of the season, she qualified for the Season Ending Championships, but lost in the quarterfinal to world No.2 Navratilova 7-5 in the third set. With an amazing 33-8 win/loss record for her first year as a professional, she ended the year as the #6 ranked player in the world.\n\n1990\n\nIn 1990, Monica went on a 36 match winning streak to win the following tournaments back to back:\n\nLipton Player’s Championships\n\nU.S. Women’s Hard Court Championships\n\nEckerd Open\n\nItalian Open\n\nLufthansa Cup\n\nFrench Open\n\nAt the Lufthansa Cup (the German Open), it was the first time since the merge of East and West Germany that both sides were getting to come together and enjoy this sporting event together. Also attended by the president of Germany at the time. All came to watch their beloved Steffi Graf play the final, and hopefully win. Unfortunately for Graf, standing on the other side of the net was Monica who was riding her own winning streak into the final. Just 2 weeks before she had thrashed Navratilova at the Italian Open Final 6-1, 6-1. In the press conference, Martina stated that she felt like she had “been run over by a semi-truck”. Winning her 5th tournament in a row, Monica defeated Steffi Graf in Germany, 6-4, 6-3. And then went on to win her first Grand Slam at the French Open over Steffi 7-6, 6-4, becoming the youngest Champion to ever win Roland Garros at 16 years, 6 months (a record that still has never been surpassed)!\n\nHer winning streak was stopped by Zina Garrison at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals which went to 9-7 in the 3rd set. Then Monica went on to play the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles and won the title against Martina Navratilova 6-4, 3-6, 7-6. She then defeated her again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets 6-3, 7-6. Monica ended the year at the Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden and won over Gabriela Sabatini 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 (in the first five-set women’s match since 1902 US Championships, and becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships). Monica had won 9 out of the 15 tournaments she entered in 1990 with a 54-6 win/loss record for the year, and had improved her ranking to #2 in the world. An amazing year!\n\n1991\n\nIn 1991, Monica won the following tournaments:\n\nAustralian Open\n\nLipton International (Monica becomes #1)\n\nVirginia Slims of Houston\n\nFrench Open (Defended her title)\n\nVirginia Slims of Los Angeles\n\nU.S. Open\n\nNichirei International\n\nMilano Indoor\n\nVirginia Slims of Philadelphia\n\nVirginia Slim Championships in New York (Defended her title)\n\nOn March 11th, Monica became the youngest #1 player in the world (at the time) at 17 years 3 months, overtaking Steffi Graf and becoming only the 5th player in history to reach the #1 spot since the rankings were started in 1975. Playing at the Australia Open for the first time, she got to the Final and defeated Jana Novotna to win her second Grand Slam Title 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, in a outstanding 3 set match. Winning her second French Open in a row, she easily dispatched Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the Final 6-3, 6-4. She then skipped Wimbledon and was under a fire of controversy surrounding her disappearance. The reason given to Wimbledon authorities was that she had a “minor medical emergency”. Media speculation in tabloids suggested outrageous explanations regarding her last minute withdrawal of Wimbledon – “she was pregnant, abducted by aliens, and that she was hiding out at the Donald Trump estate, etc”. It was later explained that she had shin splints from accidentally hitting her shin with her racquet after a serve. Shortly after she appeared on the David Letterman show. David Letterman asked her questions regarding all the media speculation surrounding the Wimbledon withdrawal and she explained what really had happened; That she had an injury and couldn’t play, but had a good laugh at all the crazy stories in the tabloids.\n\nBut then she showed up to play an exhibition after Wimbledon and was photographed holding up a t-shirt that had the names of the Grand Slam events with Wimbledon scratched off, and the name of the exhibition tournament in its place. Monica later said that she didn’t know what the shirt said and that a man from the Event gave it to her to hold up as she was taking media photographs and didn’t realize the implication. However, it was not good publicity and a lot of the UK was not happy either.\n\nAt the U.S. Open, the 17-year one-month age gap between Monica (17 years, 9 months) and Navratilova (34 years, 10 months), was widest in a Grand Slam final in Open Era. Monica went on to defeat Martina Navratilova in the Final 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, for her first U.S. Open title! She won 3 more Titles after the Open before arriving at the Year End Championships in Madison Square Garden in New York. She fought all the way to the Final and defeated Martina Navratilova again, in a best of 5 set match. Monica won 6-4, 3-6, 7-5, 6-0. It was an amazing end to another great season! Won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the Final of every tournament that she entered)! She won the 3 Grand Slams that she had entered in 1991, the Australian Open, the French Open, and the U.S. Open. She now had won 4 Grand Slam titles and was the season ending #1 player in the world with a 74-6 win/loss record for the year!\n\n1992\n\nAt the Australian Open she had no problem defeating world No.4 Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario in the semifinal 6-2, 6-2, and then easily defeating world No.7 Mary Jo Fernandez in the Final 6-2, 6-3 for her second Australian Open in a row! Then she went on to win the Essen Classic, Evert Cup, Houston, Barcelona, Monica was pretty much dominating the tour. At the French Open she easily defeated world No.5 Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals, then defeated world No.3 Gabriela Sabatini in a tough 3 set match 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in the semifinals. In the Final, she played Steffi Graf in a classic 3 set match that went on to be one of the all time great matches, with Monica prevailing 6-2, 3-6, 10-8. Monica was now only the 2nd woman to have won the French Open 3 times in a row (since Hilde Sperling did it in 1935-37)!\n\nMonica’s celebration didn’t last long since she was to play Wimbledon just a few weeks after the French. Unfortunately for Monica, the British were not too happy with her because of last years disappearance. Through out the tournament she was being harassed by journalist and media about the disappearance the year before, and for the grunting during play. The media even stated that they had what they called a “Grunt-o-meter” set up courtside, to record the velocity of her grunts during her matches. They also organized a contest where you could call in and record your own grunt like Monica, and the winning person got some kind of prize. She also had a bomb threat – it was ridiculous. During the quarterfinals, world No.14 Nathalie Tauziat complained to the chair umpire that Monica was being too loud. Which prompted world No.4 Martina Navratilova during their semifinal showdown to complain as well. This time, the chair umpire gave Monica a warning. Later in the match Navratilova complained again prompting the chair umpire to bend over during a change over and tell Monica to keep it down – which she replied “I’m trying the best that I can”. Monica eventually won the match 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.\n\nBut in the rain soaked final that had to be delayed during play at one point because of the rain, she made a big mistake and tried to be quiet during the match. The grunting controversy finally took its toll on her. She tried to play the final without grunting since everyone acted like it was a big deal and she was getting so much backlash for it – but unfortunately it backfired, she was too bothered about trying to be quiet that her game lacked the sting that it usually does, as well as the grass was extremely slick from the rain. She lost easily to Steffi Graf 6-2, 6-1.\n\nBy the time the U.S. Open began, she was back in full grunt again and winning as usual. Destroying her opponents each round with those amazing ground strokes and just losing a few games here and there. Without losing a set in getting to the Final, she defeated Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-3 to win her 2nd U.S. Open in a row (her 7th Grand Slam title)! Then she went on to win the Nichirei International, Bank of the West Classic, and the Year End Championships (for the 3rd time in a row) over Martina Navratilova 7-5, 6-3, 6-1.\n\nShe ended the year again as the #1 player in the world. Won 10 out of the 15 tournaments she entered (again reaching the Final of every tournament that she entered except for one, where she reached the quarterfinal). Duplicating her previous years success, she defended her titles all the way by winning again at the Australian Open, the French Open, and at the U.S. Open. With a 70-5 win/loss record for the year, she was also the youngest player to have won 30 titles before her 19th birthday.\n\n1993\n\nMonica started 1993 off strong winning the Australian Open for the 3rd time in a row (her 8th Grand Slam), defeating Steffi Graf 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 & then winning the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova; But then she lost to Navratilova at the Paris Indoors Final in a third set Tie-breaker halting her 34-match win streak. A viral infection forced her out of Indian Wells, Miami, Hilton Head and Barcelona, but returned to play at the Citizen Cup in Hamburg, Germany in April. But on April 30th, with Monica leading 6-4, 4-3 in her quarterfinal match vs Magdalena Maleeva (while the players were sitting down during a change-over), She was stabbed in the back by a crazy Steffi Graf fan who felt that Monica had to be stopped so that Graf could regain the #1 position, which had been held by Monica for the past 2 years. He got up from his seat acting as if he was gonna just walk by, but instead pulled out a knife from a bag he was holding and leaned over the railing and stabbed her in the back just below her left shoulder blade. The wound healed quickly but the psychological effects took its toll on her and she went into seclusion for 2 1/2 years. Not too long after the stabbing, the WTA held a meeting with the Top 10 players and they voted to not freeze Monica’s ranking while she recovers, and so therfore her ranking fell to #8 by the year end. The only player that voted to freeze Monica’s ranking was Gabriela Sabatini. When Monica turned 20 years old on December 2nd, she had amassed 8 Grand Slams; Giving her the record for the most Grand Slams won by a teenager since the Open Era of tennis began in 1968 (a record that has never been surpassed since). The only other player to have won more Grand Slams as a teenager than Monica, was Maureen Connolly who won 9 (but she accomplished this feat before the introduction of the Open Era).\n\n1995\n\nAfter a fairly long absence from tennis and after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Monica returned to the game in 1995. The tennis world was just so excited to have her back. Everyone was, except maybe her tennis opponents. Surprisingly she was granted by WTA a co-ranking of #1 with Graf (for her first 6 tournaments), and won her first tournament back as a wildcard entry, at the Canadian Open defeating Amanda Coetzer in the Final (set tournament record for least number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14) which is a record that still has not been surpassed). At the U.S. Open, playing in her first Grand Slam in 2 1/2 years (but having to wear a knee brace because she was suffering from tendonitis after the Canadian Open), she defeated world No.10 Anke Huber, No.5 Jana Novotna, No.3 Conchita Martinez (all in straight sets to reach the Final), before falling to Graf in the Final 7-6(6),0-6,6-3 after holding set point in the first set. Monica was just so excited to be back playing tennis again, and so was the tennis world. Tennis thrived again because Monica was back! The game needed her. Although she had to withdraw from the Oakland tournament and Season-Ending Championships due to the tendonitis in her left knee; Ending the season with a 11-1 win/loss record for the year and Co-ranked #1 in the world.\n\n1996\n\nIn 1996, Monica started off great winning the Sydney Tournament defeating world No.12 Lindsay Davenport in the Final 4-6, 7-6, 6-3 after being down match point. Then she won her 9th Grand Slam at the Australian Open for the 4th time (having never lost a match in Australia), defeating world No.9 Anke Huber 6-4, 6-1. She also won Eastbourne defeating Mary Joe Fernandez in the Final 6-0, 6-2 (her 1st grass court title), and then won the Canadian Open for the 2nd time in a row defeating world No.2 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the Final 6-1, 7-6. At the U.S. Open she didn’t even lose a set in getting to the Final (even dispatching world No.3 Conchita Martinez in the semifinal 6-4, 6-3), but lost to Steffi Graf in the Final 7-5, 6-4. She then traveled to Tokyo and won the Tokyo Nichirei International over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-1, 6-4. She got to participate at the Olympics representing the USA and defeated Gabriela Sabatini in the 3rd round before falling to Jana Novotna in the quarterfinal 8-6 in the third set. She also teamed up to play Fed Cup through out the year which helped the USA team win the title over Spain, winning the final match over Sanchez-Vicario. But retired during the Year End Championships 1st round against Kimiko Date due to left shoulder pain. Then in December during a warm up before an exhibition with Martina Hingis while practicing serves, broke her right ring-finger when she tried to catch a ball in mid flight after Hingis served; Ending the season with a 47-8 win/loss record and ranked #2 in the world.\n\n1997\n\nDue to the broken right ring-finger sustained during warmup before exhibition in December 1996, was unable to defend her Australian Open crown at the beginning of the year and it kept her out of the game until March; Resulting in her ranking falling to No.6. Returned at Miami tournament reaching the final there for first time since winning in 1991, but lost to world No.1 Martina Hingis; and then made it to the final of Hilton Head, but lost again to world No.1 Martina Hingis 7-6 in the third. During her 4th round win over Mary Pierce at the French Open, we (Ronny and James) became fans of Monica and started watching tennis and following her results. She reached the semifinal and extended Martina Hingis to 3 sets, but lost 6-7, 7-5, 6-4; Elevating her back to No.2 in the world.\n\nMonica then won back-to-back titles to win the Acura Classic over world No.7 Lindsay Davenport 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, and the Canadian Open (for the 3rd time in a row) over world No.8 Anke Huber 6-2, 6-4. A 14-match win streak was halted in the U.S. Open quarterfinal, where she held match point on Irina Spirlea before falling 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. She then traveled to Tokyo and won the Tokyo Princess Cup over world No.10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-1, 3-6, 7-6. Qualifying for the Season-Ending Championships, Arantxa got her rematch though in the 1st round and defeated Monica in a tough 3 set battle 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Ending the season with a 45-13 win/loss record and ranked #5 in the world.\n\n1998\n\nIn 1998, we (Ronny & James) started MonicaSelesSite.com. She missed the first three months of season to be with family, due to her father’s battle with cancer. And just a few weeks before the French Open was to start, Monica’s father passed away from the 5 year battle with cancer. He left this earth a wonderful and compelling person who would have done anything to bring happiness to his family and to all that knew him. Monica not only lost her father and coach, but also her best friend. God bless him.\n\nMonica entered the 1998 French Open just weeks after her father’s death with little and lots of hope. She, with her father’s wedding ring bouncing around her neck, made it all the way to the Final. Every match she was getting condolences from opponents, friends, and fans who knew what she was going through (Which probably also made it harder for her to concentrate on tennis), but still played fairy-tale like tennis throughout the tournament. She defeated world No.3 Jana Novotna in the quarterfinals 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, and then demolished world No.1 Martina Hingis (for the 1st time) in the semifinals 6-3, 6-2, but lost in the final to world No.5 Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario 7-6, 0-6, 6-2.\n\nShe went on to win the Canadian Open (for the 4th time in a row) defeating world No.1 Martina Hingis in the semifinal 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and then world No.4 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the Final 6-3, 6-2. And also won both the Singles & Doubles at the Tokyo Princess Cup. The end of 1998 brought Monica to the Year End Championships, where Monica faced Steffi Graf for the 1st time since the 1996 U.S. Open Final. They played each other in the 2nd round after Monica defeated Kournikova in the 1st round 6-4, 6-3. Monica came out blasting the ball all over the place and took the 1st set 6-1. Graf came back to win the 2nd set with a tough 6-4. Both players were hitting winners and playing great tennis through out the whole match, with Graf prevailing 6-4 in the 3rd (for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 win for Graf); Ending the season with a 46-13 win/loss record and ranked #6 in the world. In career earnings, she passed the $10 Million mark (only the 4th to do so).\n\n1999\n\nMonica started 1999 off with a trip to the Australian Open for the 1st time in 3 years. She had never been defeated in Australia ever. Blasting her way through the draw, she met back up with Steffi Graf once again in a very much anticipated quarterfinal match. Monica and Steffi played some outstanding tennis once again, but this time Monica was victorious in straight sets. After coming back from behind in the 1st set to win 7-5, Monica just blasted Steffi in the 2nd set 6-1 (for a 7-5, 6-1 win for Seles). Monica had placed herself in the semifinals of the Australian Open once again, and was still undefeated with a 33-0 Australian win streak! Waiting in the semifinals though was Martina Hingis who was also riding her own Australian success story. Unfortunately though, Monica lost to Hingis on that hot and sunny day 6-2, 6-4, breaking her winning streak and putting Hingis in the final (where she went on to win her last Grand Slam).\n\nAfter the Australian Open, Monica struggled a little in 1999. Although winning some big matches throughout the year, Monica’s only title came at the Bausch & Lomb Championships in Amelia Island over Roxandra Dragomir 6-2, 6-3 in the Final (only losing 14 games through out the whole tournament). She was also a part of the winning Fed Cup team this year, playing for her country the United States in the 1st round vs Croatia. She defeated Croatian player Talaja 6-3, 6-1, and Majoli 6-0, 6-3 to defeat Croatia and to help the United States progress in the draw.\n\nAt the 1999 French Open, Monica fought all the way to the semifinals with impressive ground strokes and her famous never quit attitude. Monica’s opponent on the other side of the net was once again, Steffi Graf. This time after Monica won the 1st set 7-6, Graf came back to win 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. She then had to withdraw from three summer events with tendonitis in her left forearm and returned at the Canadian Open and got to the final again, but lost to world No.1 Martina Hingis (halting Monica’s winning streak in Toronto where she had won the title 1995-1998). Unfortunately, at a tournament in Tokyo at the end of September, she started to feel pain in her right foot. She reached the final though but lost to world No.2 Lindsay Davenport 7-5, 7-6. Now suffering from a stress fracture in her right foot, forced her out of Linz, Philadelphia and the Season-Ending Championships; Ending the season with a 38-13 win/loss record and ranked #6 in the world.\n\n2000\n\nIn 2000, Monica was a new player reaching at least the quarterfinal or better in all 16 events played! The start of the year was postponed though due to the stress fracture in her right foot, but returned after a 5 month layoff to win her 1st title of the year at the IGA Super Thrift Oklahoma Tournament (her 45th Title), defeating Amanda Coetzer 6-1, 6-2 in the semifinal, and then Nathalie Dechy 6-1, 7-6 in the Final (Ronny & James attended, 1st time to see Monica). Then won the Bausch & Lomb Championships again defeating world No.8 Conchita Martinez 6-3, 6-2 in the Final, and won the Italian Open for the 1st time in 10 years when she defeated Amelie Mauresmo 6-2, 7-6; Moving her back to No.3 in the world! To top it all off in 2000, she won the Olympic Bronze medal in Sydney Australia over Jelena Dokic 6-1, 6-4!\n\nMonica was again apart of the winning Fed Cup team in 2000 and helped the United States defeat Spain in the Fed Cup Final. Monica also changed sponsors from Nike to Yonex in mid 2000 and it seemed to change her attitude and her play. Possibly playing in her last Year End Championships, since the Year End Championships was to be moved to Germany (where Monica has stated she won’t play). Monica fought her way to the final where she lost a tough 3 set thrilling match to world No.1 Martina Hingis 6-7, 6-4, 6-4. Dressed from head to toe in Yonex now, she picked up former pro Player Mike Sell as a coach and was now ready for the 2001 season. She ended the year with a 58-13 win/loss record and ranked #4 in the world.\n\n2001\n\nMonica reached six finals in 2001, winning four titles. She began by reaching the quarterfinals of Sydney in the singles draw; And pairing up with Martina Hingis in doubles, they defeated the Williams sisters 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 in their first match, and then defeated Davenport/Morariu 7-5, 6-3 in the quarterfinals. At the Australian Open, she lost to Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals after leading 7-5, 4-2 (Jennifer went on to win her 1st Grand Slam by winning the Australian Open that year). In doubles, Seles and Hingis paired up again and defeated reigning champions Raymond/Stubbs in the 1st round before falling to the William sisters in the semifinals; Who were out to avenge their Sydney loss, from a week before to Seles/Hingis.\n\nAfter Australia, she went on to defended her Oklahoma City title defeating Jennifer Capriati in the Final 6-3, 5-7, 6-2. She then started to feel pain in her right foot again after Indian Wells tournament (now diagnosed as a stress reaction), and took 2 months off to let her foot heal. She returned at the end of May to play Madrid but the foot had not totally healed and she lost her first round match in 3 sets. She took another 2 months off which caused her to withdraw from six tournaments (including Roland Garros and Wimbledon which caused her ranking to fall), and returned to the tour at Stanford where she reached the semifinal but lost to world No.4 Lindsay Davenport. But it was at the San Diego tournament where she put together some of her best results since 1998, destroying Jennifer Capriati 6-3, 6-3 and then world No.1 Martina Hingis 6-3, 6-4 (both in straight sets), before falling to world No.3 Venus Williams in the final.\n\nAt the Los Angeles tournament, Monica saved 6 match points against Serena Williams in the quarterfinals to win 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(2). And in the semifinal she defeated Martina Hingis again, but lost to Lindsay Davenport in the final. Despite her earliest loss in 11 years at the U.S. Open (4th round to Bedanova), she went on to captured consecutive titles in Bahia, Japan Open (becoming eighth woman in Open Era to win 50 career titles) and Shanghai. These Titles coming at the end of the year to wrap up a great season! She then chose not to play the Season-Ending Championships in Munich, Germany for obvious reasons. She ended the year with a 40-10 win/loss record and ranked #10 in the world.\n\n2002\n\nStill riding high from her back to back titles at the end of 2001 and on a winning streak of 13 match wins in a row, she came out blasting her ground strokes in all corners at the Australian Open. She ended Venus Williams’ 24 match win-streak with a fantastic 3 set quarterfinal win 6-7(4-7), 6-2, 6-3 (which extended her win streak to 18 in a row). However in the semifinal, she lost a tough 3 set match to Martina Hingis 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. She then traveled to Tokyo and played the Pan Pacific tournament and reached the final, before falling to Hingis again in 3 sets. Her 52nd Title came in Doha, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn in the Final 7-6, 6-3! In Miami, she came from 5-7, 4-2 down to defeat Conchita Martinez in the 2nd round, and then defeated world No.5 Kim Clijsters 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, before falling to then world No.1 Jennifer Capriati in a massive 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(4) battle in the semifinal (after holding 2 match points).\n\nRepresenting the USA in the 2002 Fed Cup vs. Austria (Ronny & James attended, 2nd time to see Monica), and with all the controversy of Jennifer Capriati getting kicked off the team the night before causing them to be down 0-1 already, all hopes were on Monica. She unfortunately lost against Barbara Schwartz and gave the Austria team a chance to defeat Meghann Shaughnessy and win the meeting with the USA team, which they did. She did come back the next day and won a singles match and a doubles match but it was too late to save the team vs Austria. She withdrew from the Italian Open with a stomach virus but came back to win Madrid over Chanda Rubin 6-4, 6-2 (Her 53rd Title of her career), moving her back up to world No. 4. Monica then teamed back up to play Fed Cup again, to keep USA in the world group after the loss to Austria. She won two singles matches in USA’s win over Israel to secure a spot in the 2003 World Group. I think Monica really needed to play and win these 2 singles matches for her own self, after the loss to Austria a couple of months ago. I assume these 2 matches vs Israel were very important to Monica, and she won them with no problem putting the USA back in the world group.\n\nAt the US Open, recovering from a 6-1, 4-3 deficit to avenge the April Fed Cup loss to Barbara Schwartz, she won 1-6, 7-6, 6-2, which had the New York crowd jumping out of their seats! She then defeated Martina Hingis 6-4, 6-2 in the 4th round in a crushing display of power over the Swiss player, before losing to Venus Williams in the quarterfinal. She then withdrew from Zurich with that right foot injury and returned to the tour at the Season-Ending Championships which was moved back to the United States (Los Angeles). It was her 12th time to qualify and ninth appearance; She saved 7 match points to come back and defeat Lindsay Davenport in the 1st round 3-6, 7-6, 6-3. She eventually lost in the quarterfinal to world No.2 Venus Williams 7-5, 6-4 after leading 4-1 in the first set.\n\nRetirement talk circulated around at the Championships, that this might possibly be Monica’s last year end Championships. Monica then stated in a press conference at the end of 2002 that she is not ready to retire. She said that she feels like she is still playing well and could possibly win a couple more Grand Slams, and is still in the top 10 in the world. She said that she was very much looking forward to the new 2003 season, and had just picked up a new coach. She will play in Hong Kong and then to the Australian Open, then to Tokyo and where ever life takes me. She ended the year with a 47-14 win/loss record and ranked #7 in the world.\n\n2003\n\nMonica traveled to China to play the 2003 Hong Kong Ladies Challenge, and won. She defeated new upstart Maria Sharapova in the semifinal 6-3, 6-0, and then defeated Chanda Rubin in the Final 5-7, 6-1, 6-2. After Hong Kong she went to the Australian Open and won her 1st match easily 6-0, 6-1, but twisted her left ankle during her second round match. Even though she was hurt, she played on with her ankle taped but lost in a tough three set match against Klara Zakopalova 6-7(6), 7-5, 6-3.\n\nTwo weeks later she got to the final of Toray Pan Pacific, but lost in three sets to Davenport. Then she got to the final of the Dubai Duty Free Open, but lost another tough three set match. Monica held match points against world No.4 Justine Henin-Hardenne in the second set, but couldn’t convert and eventually lost 7-5 in the third set.\n\nShe then withdrew from Indian Wells, Miami and Charleston due to the foot injury but returned 2 months later at Amelia Island, but lost in the quarterfinal to Henin-Hardenne. The foot injury starts to flair up again, but Monica manages to win her 1st round match in three sets at the Italian Open. Monica states in a press conference that she is having pain in her foot again. She ends up having to retire in her second round match due to the injury. With the lingering foot injury still giving her problems on and off, Monica goes ahead and enters the French Open, but loses in the 1st round. Unable to scramble around enough, she goes down in straight sets. After that match, Monica decided to take the time off the tour to heal this stress reaction in her foot.\n\nMonica was gone from tennis from May 2003 until…\n\n2004\n\nShe signed on to play the exhibition with Martina Navratilova in Virginia called “Raise a Racquet”, for charity on March 22, 2004. A way to test the foot after almost a year from playing competitively. She would play a doubles and singles match, and the night before they would sign and auction off tennis memorabilia for charity.\n\nWe heard about the news of Monica signing on to play, so we decided to go for it and go see Monica for the 3rd time! Tickets got ordered, booked our flights, started counting down the days until the exhibition! We attended the event with a friend that we met through our Monica Seles Forum. She invited us to stay with her while we were in town, which was very nice of her to do that for us (thank you Jenz!).\n\nWe all had bought tickets to the silent auction on Sunday evening, as well as tickets to the exhibition matches the following night. All four of us (Ronny & I, Jenz, and her husband) arrived in great anticipation to see Monica and maybe talk to her.\n\nAs we were walking down the stairs to the floor, Monica and her mom, and Martina Navratilova, were standing at the bottom of the stairs! There were people all around them getting a chance to reach out their hand and say whatever they wanted to say, to these two tennis legends. So we scooted through the crowd and when we got an opportunity, Ronny reached out his hand as did she, and we all got to meet her and have our pictures taken with her! She was very kind and interested in what we had to say. Ronny and I got to tell her about our website dedicated to her, and that we had seen her play in Oklahoma, in 2000.\n\nWe also told her that we were three of the people that sent the “Well wishes” and “Birthday wishes” at the end of last year (we did receive an email from her assistant in January passing on a message from Monica, that said that Monica got them and that she has been reading them while recovering from her foot injury!). She was very excited to hear that we sent those messages to her, surprised and excited – she thanked us for doing that. She even asked us to write down our website address, so that she could check out our site! Later in the evening, she approached us again and invited us to hit some tennis balls with her the next morning!!!!\n\nIt was a dream come true for us to meet Monica, get to really talk to her, and then hit tennis balls with her! WOW! We never expected that we would get to do this. We had great expectations going into this trip. You always have dreams that you would love to meet Monica and have her invite you to go play tennis with her…..but you never really think that it could become reality. And that’s exactly what happened on that magical two days. It is something that we will never, ever forget.\n\nUnfortunately Monica lost the singles match (but won the doubles match), and as the months passed by after the exhibition Monica did not come back to the tour – but her assistant sent us another email from Monica thanking us for coming to Virginia to support her, and to let us know that Monica did get the 2004 Tribute Video we sent and that she liked it! The stress fracture in her foot had not healed all the way. But she did sign up to play 2 more exhibitions with Martina Navratilova early next year to test the foot again.\n\n2005\n\nTraveling down to New Zealand for the 2 tennis exhibitions early in the year with Martina Navratilova, Monica looked so trim and fit. It was obvious to fans and media that Monica had really slimmed up even more than when we all saw her at the “Raise a racquet” exhibition. Laughing at Martina’s antics on the court and having a great time at both exhibitions, Monica fought hard but still lost both events. The foot was still not ready, neither was she. It was too soon. So she filled her time off the court with charity work, sponsor obligations, tv appearance’s, fashion shows, movie premiers with other celebrities – Monica was everywhere but on the tennis court. During the women’s Canadian Open tournament, Monica was given an award for her achievement in Canada for her 4 wins in a row (95-98). It was a wonderful gesture to commemorate a great champion. Fans and Media that were hoping she would make a comeback, were sad to see another year go by and Monica was not back on the tour.\n\n2006\n\n2006 was much the same as 2005, although there were no exhibitions. But Monica did not stay hidden though, she was everywhere again. Sponsor obligations and Charity work filled most of her year with articles coming out every month wondering if she will ever return to the tour again. And if it was possible, media speculation and tennis fans alike speculated that maybe she was too thin now. Monica was sporting a physique like back in her teen days – trimmer than ever. The articles usually stated that she was still practicing and hoping for a return but, unsure whether or not it would happen.\n\n2007\n\nAt the beginning of the year, a few articles came out saying that Monica and Martina Navratilova were set to play a series of exhibitions throughout the year for charity. Then in March, an article came out saying that they were set to play their first exhibition at the River Oaks Country Club in Houston, Texas on red clay. Since we (Ronny & James) live in Texas, we definitely wanted to buy tickets and attend! So we did.\n\nWe didn’t think we would have the dream meeting we had in 2004 (but still hoping we might get to talk with her again), but we also didn’t want to get our hopes up too much. So we brought 2 framed pictures that we had taken with her in Virginia and a doll that looked like a little Monica playing tennis. Luckily we did because we got to talk to her right before the match. We gave her the doll and talked about our last meeting. We told her that we had the 2 pictures that we had taken with her in 2004 but it was in the car, because we didn’t know if we would get to talk to her. She wanted to see them and asked if we could get them and she would see us after the match. It was another great moment for Ronny and I, and it was very nice of her to speak with us before the match cause she didn’t do that for anyone else. After she won the match over Navratilova 6-7, 6-2, 10-1, she started walking towards the court exit and we noticed that she had the doll attached to her Yonex bag! Ronny and I were so excited! She stopped and signed the photos of us together and we told her how excited we were to see the doll on her bag – she posed for another picture with the doll and wished us a safe trip back home. It was another amazing moment for us. Words can not express how excited we were.\n\nThen in June, another article came out saying the next stop on the series of exhibitions with Seles and Navratilova would be in New Orleans, Louisiana. Well the state of Louisiana is just right next to us, so we (Ronny & James) got tickets and drove to New Orleans. Now this time we really thought, “lets not get our hopes up, we are just going to go and enjoy watching her play”.\n\nMonica won again! This time in straight sets. Monica was amazing, slamming balls in the corners and hitting passing shot winners. Martina Navratilova fought hard with drop shots and her classic net rushing, but could not keep up with the power coming from the other side. Monica won 6-4, 6-2. We were in the first few rows and after Monica won the singles and the crowd was cheering her on – Ronny and I yelled out “we love you Monica”, she saw us and motioned that she would talk with us after the doubles match. They ended up playing with a few college players with Monica teaming up with one and Martina the other. They just played a fun couple of games and I think the match was given to Navratilova’s team because they did a next point wins kind of thing and Navratilova’s team won it. It wasn’t important, just for fun and to fill up the time left. Monica started signing autographs after it was over and when we got to talk to her we complimented her on her play that evening, and how well she was striking the ball. She said that once she won the first set she got her rhythm going more. We talked a little longer, got our pictures taken, wished her a safe trip to Romania and said our goodbyes. She spent a good amount of time talking with us and to Michael (that we met for the first time who was one of our forum members). She seemed to enjoy the reunion. We did too! She is such a nice person (its hard to describe in words), she makes you feel like you are the only person in the world when she is talking with you – she gives you her full attention and seems genuinely interested and asks questions. A wonderful person to talk with.\n\nIn November, she won “The Fan Favorite” award voted by the fans online over other tennis legends like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Venus and Serena Williams. The poll results were broadcasted on Open Access show on The Tennis Channel.\n\nIn December 2007, just a day after Monica’s 34th birthday, an article was released stating that Monica would like to try and return to competitive tennis next year.\n\n“I certainly would not ever be able to do a full schedule again, because of the foot,” she said, “but I’m thinking about the Slams and about some of the better tournaments that lead into them. I won’t decide for sure until the beginning of the year, and the Australian is certainly not possible. But Miami. Maybe.”\n\n2008\n\nUnfortunately, Monica never returned to the tour. She announced her retirement from the sport on February 14, 2008; Exactly 19 years and one day from when she first became a professional.\n\n“Tennis has been and will always be a huge part of my life. I have for some time considered a return to professional play, but I have now decided not to pursue that,” Seles said from Miami, Florida. “I will continue to play exhibitions, participate in charity events, promote the sport, but will no longer plan my schedule around the tour. I look forward to pursuing other opportunities with the same passion and energy that fueled my dedication to tennis and to devote more time to two of my passions — children and animals. I especially want to thank all my wonderful, loyal fans for all of their support for me over the years. They have inspired me throughout my career in the good times and comforted me in the bad times. I have always been so proud to have such a special group of precious fans to call my very own and felt they were the best an athlete could ever hope to have. I will miss them all as much as I will miss competing in the game of tennis.”\n\n2009\n\nOn July 11, 2009, Monica was inducted into The International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. Seles was enshrined in nearly a 90-minute ceremony along with master’s player Andres Gimeno, the oldest player ever to win the French at 34 years, 10 months and Dr. Robert Johnson was inducted posthumously.\n\nYet Seles didn’t win election to the Hall of Fame on a sympathy vote. Although she won just one more Grand Slam event after her comeback — the 1996 Australian Open — her credentials speak for themselves: Nine Grand Slam titles, 44 other tournament wins, twice ranked No. 1 at year’s end. It’s absolutely fine to feel compassion for her, as long as that never slides into pity. Seles recognizes the privileges that came with her talent and fame. She considers herself fortunate, not cursed.\n\n“It’s a great way to cap a fantastic career,” Seles said of the ceremony. “More importantly, I’m just lucky I got to do something I love to do, and I’m hoping in my second life, as I call it, I can find something that I’m as passionate about as I was about tennis. It’s really that simple for me.”\n\n“I would like to thank all my tennis fans who were there from Day One when I was No. 1, through my stabbing, and my comeback,” Seles, dressed in white slacks with a lavender blouse, told the crowd.\n\nSeles, playfully, gave one more grunt. “For old, good time sakes,” she said."
