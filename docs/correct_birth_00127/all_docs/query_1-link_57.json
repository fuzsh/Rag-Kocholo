        "text": "Tennis champ Monica Seles was the holder of nine grand slam singles titles and was the top-ranked player in the world for several years. She turned pro in 1988 at the age of just 14 and won her first grand slam championship, the French Open, just two years later. After a two-year absence from the tour in 1993 and 1994, after being stabbed on the court by a deranged \"fan,\" Seles rose above adversity and returned to capture her final grand slam crown in 1996, winning the Australian Open. She held an outstanding career win-loss singles record of 595-122 and was ranked the 13th greatest player of all time by Tennis Magazine. Her accomplishments also extended beyond the tennis court, as she served as Goodwill Ambassador for the Laures Sports Foundation and the Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Microalgae Spirulina Against Malnutrition (IIMSAM). In addition to her philanthropic activities, Seles decided to challenge herself somewhere other than the tennis court, by signing on as one of the celebrity dance contestants for the sixth season of ABC's hit series, \"Dancing with the Stars\" (2005- )."
