        "text": "AKA Monika Sele\n\nBorn: 2-Dec-1973\n\nBirthplace: Novi Sad, Yugoslavia\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nOccupation: Tennis\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Winner of 9 Majors\n\nMonica Seles was a tennis wunderkind of the 1990s, and at the time was the youngest singles player ever to rank number one in the world (she was 17). Some fans have argued that she was the best tennis player ever, male or female, and she was considered the first female \"power player\". At 5'10\" and playing with both powerful fists, backhand and forehand, another Seles' trademark was that she grunted when her racquet hit the ball with full force.\n\nAt 19, she was attacked by Günter Parche, a deranged fan of rival Steffi Graf. Parche stabbed her in the back with a boning knife during a changeover in a match against Bulgarian Maggie Maleena. Although it was captured on video, Parche was never sent to prison. Seles' physical recovery was tough, but the psychological effects were crippling. She was treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder by a sports psychologist. She remains one of the best players in the world, but has never regained the dominating form of her earlier game.\n\nIn 1998, Seles had further psychological problems when her father and first coach, Karolj, died of cancer. In 2003 a foot injury sidelined her until an exhibit match in February 2005 against Martina Navratilova.\n\nSeveral opposing players have complained about Seles' grunts, and during the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 1992, French player Nathalie Tauziat asked that Seles not be allowed to make noises. She remained silent, and won the match.\n\nFather: Karolj Seles (d. 1998)\n\nMother: Esther\n\nBrother: Zoltan (older)\n\nBoyfriend: Tom Golisano (billionaire, b. 1942, together 2011-)\n\nWinner, French Open (women's singles) 1990\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's singles) 1991\n\nWinner, French Open (women's singles) 1991\n\nWinner, US Open (women's singles) 1991\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's singles) 1992\n\nWinner, French Open (women's singles) 1992\n\nWinner, US Open (women's singles) 1992\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's singles) 1993\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's singles) 1996\n\nOlympic Bronze Medal 2002 (tennis)\n\nAssociated Press Athlete of the Year (female) 1991\n\nAssociated Press Athlete of the Year (female) 1992\n\nEndorsement of Nike\n\nNaturalized US Citizen 17-May-1994\n\nStabbed\n\nWedding: Paul McCartney and Heather Mills (2002)\n\nHungarian Ancestry\n\nRisk Factors: Depression\n\nTELEVISION\n\nDancing with the Stars Contestant (2008)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Monica Seles\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
