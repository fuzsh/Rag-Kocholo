        "text": "(born 1973). In 1991, 17-year-old Yugoslavian-born tennis star Monica Seles became the youngest female singles player ever to rank number one in the world up until that time. Accompanied by her signature grunts and growls, the left-handed champion hit with a powerful, two-handed forehand and backhand.\n\nMonica Seles was born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, on December 2, 1973. Coached by her father, she began playing tennis at an early age. Seles won the Yugoslav 12-and-under girls’ championship at age 9 and the European 12-and-under championship at age 10. In 1986 the family moved to the United States so that she could attend a tennis academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nSeles turned professional in 1989 and won her first Grand Slam title, at the French Open, just one year later. She was the youngest player to win a Grand Slam event since Lottie Dod won at Wimbledon in 1887. After displacing the long-reigning Steffi Graf as the top-ranked woman on March 11, 1991, Seles maintained her standing for most of the next two years, relinquishing the number-one spot to Graf for a few weeks in 1991.\n\nDuring a changeover at a match in Hamburg, Germany, on April 30, 1993, Seles was stabbed in the back by a spectator who later declared himself a fan of Graf’s. Seles withdrew from competition for two years after the attack in order to heal physically and emotionally."
