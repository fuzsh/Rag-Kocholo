        "text": "Seles, a former world number one, believes that a player at the top of their game should be able to think for themselves and not depend on the coach even when they are on the court.\n\nKvitova (above), like Seles during her playing days, has had to rebuild her career following a knife attack.\n\nGetting a Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self by Monica Seles\n\ne National Apprenticeship Service wants seles at work - or pictures of apprentices in the community - so it can compile a picture map of the country.\n\nSeles writes what she knows, providing a fascinating look at the behind-the-scenes business aspects that are a huge part of today's sports scenes.\n\nApart from Seles, Juliette Kayyem, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has also been called to the board as she brings with her 15 years of experience in national security and foreign policy.\n\nLe samedi, Monica Seles, triple vainqueur du simple dames sur la terre battue parisienne (1990, 1991 et 1992) et ancienne N.1 mondiale, sera aux cotes de Jean Gachassin, le president de la Federation francaise de tennis, pour remettre la Coupe Suzanne-Lenglen a celle qui succedera a la Chinoise Li Na.\n\nI started playing tennis because of Monica Seles and I try to promote the sport in the best possible way,\" the Gulf News quoted Ivanovic as saying.\n\nThe man, described by witnesses as stocky and balding, was wrestled to the ground by guards immediately after he leaned out from the stands and lunged at Seles as she sat on a court-side bench during a break between games.\n\nSeles, who was 19 at the time, had dominated the 1992 season by winning 10 tournaments, a decisive victory over Martina Navratilova that year signalling a change of guard in tennis.\n\nSeles was competing in a tournament in Germany, when a spectator raced up behind her during a rest break and plunged a knife into her back."
