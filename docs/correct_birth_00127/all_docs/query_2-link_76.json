        "text": "SOURCE: USTA\n\nGo to USTA Announcement\n\nGo to Tennis Section\n\nMonica Seles\n\nSarasota, Fla.\n\nCAREER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nWith her trademark grunts, giggles and double-fisted groundstrokes, Seles won eight Grand Slam singles titles between 1990 and 1993. Her first Grand Slam title came at the 1990 French Open, where she also won titles in 1991 and 1992. At the 1991 U.S. Open, at the age of 17 years, nine months and five days, she became the second-youngest U.S. Open champion behind Tracy Austin. Earlier that year, Seles overtook Austin as the youngest player to rank No. 1 at the age of 17 years, three months and nine days (17 days younger than Austin.) Seles also won the 1992 U.S. Open and reached the 1992 Wimbledon final. Seles was sidelined from tennis from April 30, 1993 until Aug. 15, 1995, as a result of being stabbed on-court during a tournament in Hamburg, Germany. Seles won her first tournament in her comeback to tennis--the 1995 Canadian Open--and followed with a stellar performance at the 1995 U.S. Open, where she reached the final, only to fall to Steffi Graf in three sets. In 1996, Seles won her ninth career Grand Slam title when she won the Australian Open for the fourth time.\n\nOLYMPIC EXPERIENCE\n\nSeles has never participated in the Olympic Games.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nBorn Dec. 2, 1973 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia. Became an American citizen on March 16, 1994. Father and coach, Karoji, is also a cartoonist.\n\nBack to top"
