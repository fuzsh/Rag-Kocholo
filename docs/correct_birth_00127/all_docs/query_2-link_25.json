Wealth:Professional Tennis PlayerLast Updated:March 8, 2023\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nMonica Seles is a former world No 1 professional tennis player who retired in 2008 after earning a small fortune from the sport.\n\nWhile she may no longer play, Seles continues to grow her wealth as a spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAs of January 2024, Monica Selesâ net worth is estimated to be $50 Million.\n\nMonica Seles Facts\n\nMonica Seles began playing tennis when she was five in 1978.\n\nIn 1985, Seles won the Junior Orange Bowl tournament when she was 11.\n\nSeles turned professional when she was 15 in 1989 and won the French Open a year later as the youngest player to ever claim the title.\n\nIn 1996, after winning her fourth Australian Open, Seles made a guest appearance on the sitcom The Nanny.\n\nSeles was named one of the 30 Legends of Womenâs Tennis: Past, Present, and Future, in 2011 by Time.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMonica Seles was born December 2, 1973, in Novi Sad, SFR Yugoslavia (now Serbia), to an ethnic Hungarian family.\n\nHer parents, Ester and Karolj, supported her interest in tennis from a young age, and her father even served as her first coach.\n\nIn 1985, when she was 11, Monica won the Junior Orange Bowl tournament in Miami, Florida, and caught the attention of tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who encouraged her to enroll at his tennis academy.\n\nSeles and her brother moved to the United States in 1986, and Monica trained for two years at Bollettieriâs, and under his tutelage, Monica won her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988.\n\nCareer\n\nMonica Seles officially started her professional tennis career in 1990, and she quickly ended up on a 36-match winning streak, claiming victory in six consecutive tournaments.\n\nSeles then won her first Grand Slam singles title at the French Open, facing off against then-No. 1 player Steffi Graf to become the youngest-ever French Open singles champion at the age of 16.\n\nIn 1991, Seles once again started dominating womenâs tennis tour events, winning the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open, titles she successfully defended the following season.\n\nUnfortunately, things would take a turn for the worse in 1993, when, after defeating Steffi Graf once more at the Australian Open, Seles was stabbed during the quarterfinal match at the Citizen Cup in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nDuring this match, a man named Gunter Parche stabbed Seles with a boning knife between her shoulder blades in an attempt to end her tennis career.\n\nParche was allegedly a huge fan of Graf, and due to Seles having beaten her, he was attempting to take her out of the game permanently.\n\nWhile her physical injuries healed in several weeks, it took Seles more than two years to start playing competitive tennis again.\n\nAfter becoming a US citizen in 1994, Seles returned to the court in 1995, and the WTA president proposed that she be reinstated as the joint number one player alongside Graf.\n\nSeles won her first comeback tournament at the Canadian Open, followed closely by the US Open, and her fourth Australian Open in 1996.\n\nHowever, after this point, she never won another Grand Slam but did defeat Venus Williams and Lindsey Davenport during her final tour before retiring in 2003.\n\nMonica Selesâ Career Earnings\n\nWith her talents,

2009, Seles published her memoir Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self, earning her additional income.\n\nAs of 2015, Seles has served as a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, promoting their binge eating disorder medication.\n\nMonica Seles has earned an impressive amount of money, and her net worth is only continuing to grow even decades after her retirement.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMonica Seles married businessman Tom Golisano after becoming engaged in 2014, and while Tom has a daughter Amy from a prior marriage, the couple has no children of their own.\n\nIn 2009, Seles released her memoir Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self, which talks about her battle with depression and binge eating disorder after her stabbing attack and her fatherâs cancer diagnosis.\n\nDue to her struggles, Seles has become a spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, a company that made the first drug approved by the FDA to help treat binge eating disorder.\n\nOn social
