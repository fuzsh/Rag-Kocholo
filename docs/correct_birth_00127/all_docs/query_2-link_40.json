        "text": "Date of birth: 2/12/1973\n\nNationality: American\n\nGrand Slams: French Open 1990, 1991, 1992; Australian Open 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996; US Open 1991, 1992\n\nBorn in Novi Sad, in the former Yugoslavia, Seles became an American citizen in March 1994, by which time she had already won eight of her nine Grand Slam titles.\n\nShe became a professional in 1989 and, in only her second tournament, beat Chris Evert to win a title in Houston.\n\nOnly Evert and Steffi Graf won more titles as a teenager and Seles put together a personal-best 36-game winning streak to get to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in 1990.\n\nBut this remains the only Grand Slam to elude her, her closest attempt being when she lost the final in 1992.\n\nIn March 1993, while the world number one, Seles was stabbed in the back by a crazed spectator during a tournament in Hamburg.\n\nShe returned to the game 27 months later, winning the Canadian Open, her first tournament back.\n\nDespite increasing injury problems, Seles remains near the top of the women's game, reaching three Grand Slam quarter-finals in 2000 and the last eight in Australia in 2001.\n\nHowever she has recently hinted that she may consider retirement in the near future."
