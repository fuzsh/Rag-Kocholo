        "text": "24 years ago today, the #1 woman in the world was sitting in her chair during a changeover when a man came onto the court and stabbed her from behind with a knife.\n\n24 years later, it’s still hard to process the severity of the above sentence.\n\nApril 30, 1993 is one of the most tragic days in tennis history. 38-year-old Gunter Parche, described as a deranged Steffi Graf fan who was upset over Seles’ recent domination of her top German rival, stabbed Seles and narrowly missed her spinal cord and organs. He was subdued by officials and fans before being able to stab her again. Amazingly, only a few stitches were needed to treat the wound – but the harm done to Seles’ life and career was immeasurable.\n\nPrior to the incident, Seles appeared to be headed toward GOAT-like numbers. Between January 1991 and February 1993, Seles reached the final in 33 of 34 tournaments she played, winning 22 of those titles. During this time, she went 55-1 in majors, winning 7 of 8 major titles. And all of this was accomplished before her 20th birthday. These numbers surpass anything we’ve seen from Serena, Federer, Nadal, or Djokovic at their peaks.\n\nFollowing the stabbing, Seles would be absent from the court for over 2 years. In her 2009 autobiography, Seles detailed dealing with severe depression and an eating disorder. Her father’s cancer diagnosis later that year only added to her despair. Perhaps most upsetting was the dismissal of the attempted murder charge against Parche. The judge ruled Parche had diminished mental capacity, and he would serve no jail time. When a second judge upheld this verdict, Seles collapsed in tears in front of reporters.\n\nSeles would never be the same player again, winning only 1 further major upon her return. The mental toughness and nerves of steel that had made her a dominating #1 in the world were gone. Her assailant’s mission was, horrifyingly, accomplished.\n\nSeles had dominated her main rival, Steffi Graf, in the years prior to the attack. After herself winning 7 of 8 majors between 1988 and 1989, Graf would only win 1 major in each of the next 3 years. Within weeks of the attack, Graf would return to the #1 ranking. She would win the next 4 majors, with 11 of her 22 major titles coming after the stabbing, the third most all-time. We can only speculate how those numbers would differ had the stabbing never happened.\n\nHas lessons been learnt?\n\n24 years later, are players safer now? There’s certainly more security now at the bigger tournaments, with much tighter rules as to what is allowed on the grounds, but there’s also been several stunning security breaches in recent years. At the French Open in 2015, a young fan ran onto the court after Roger Federer’s second round win and walked alongside Federer for several seconds before being removed by security. Luckily this fan was looking to do nothing more offensive than take a selfie, but how is he able to make contact with Federer without being tackled?\n\nTwo years earlier in 2013, a much scarier incident occurred at Roland Garros during the men’s final between Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer. A masked, same-sex marriage protester ran onto the court with a flare in-hand, coming within a few feet of Nadal. The flare was left ablaze on the court for some time before being extinguished. Four years prior to that, a man entered the court during the 2009 French Open final and tried to physically force a hat and flag onto Roger Federer. Fans have also made it onto the court and made contact with players at the Australian and U.S. Opens.\n\nLuckily these court crashers have not had the ill intentions of a Gunter Parche, but the next one might. The ease at which fans can get onto the court and to the players is frightening. In an effort to create a more intimate fan experience, many of the major tournaments have added new stadiums with more courtside seating (this year the Australian Open even added VIP seating on the court itself), but does this come at the expense of player safety? Let’s hope all tournaments take whatever measures necessary to prevent a recurrence of the awful incident from 24 years ago today.\n\nSimona Halep has provided an update on her knee injury as she faces a race against time to be fit for the US Open.\n\nThe former Roland Garros and Wimbledon champion’s comeback has not gone according to plan so far as she returned from a doping ban in Miami earlier this year.\n\nHowever playing time has been limited for the Romanian as her second tournament of the year ended in a first round retirement at a Challenger event in Paris.\n\nAs a result of her retirement Halep was forced to miss Roland Garros and Wimbledon as she looked to recover from a knee injury.\n\nThe injury is more serious than meets the eye though as Halep provided an update on her knee injury and revealed it’s an injury that has been occurring for the last few months, “I wanted to provide a little health update since I have been away from the court lately. It is not the best news, but I wanted to share all the same,” Halep revealed on Instagram.\n\n“For a few months now, I have been struggling with a knee injury. It’s an injury I have never had before and it has been a tough one to manage, with the pain persisting. It has been a very difficult period (almost two years) mentally and emotionally for me and struggling physically on top of that definitely doesn’t help.\n\n“I have decided to take the time needed to recover properly, rather than training and playing through pain. My instinct has always been to try to come back as soon as possible, but I am not a machine, I am a human being and I need time to recover from everything I have gone through.\n\n“I’ll keep you posted and, as always, want to thank you for your permanent support. I hope to be back on court very soon.”\n\nHalep now faces a race against time to be fit for the US Open which starts on the 26th of August.\n\nAlexander Zverev has spoken out on the miscommunication between the Olympics and the ATP tour with tennis’ top stars set to miss some big events on the tour.\n\nThe German is getting ready to defend his Olympic title that he won in Tokyo as Zverev heads to Paris.\n\nAfter narrowly missing out on Roland Garros glory, Zverev now has an opportunity at redemption as he aims for a second consecutive gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nHowever there is a dilemma for big players this year as the same week as the tennis event at the Olympics at the ATP 500 event in Washington.\n\nThis is an event that Zverev usually plays but will have to miss it due to playing in Paris.\n\nSpeaking out on the miscommunication, Zverev said it’s no secret that the ATP are not best friends on the Olympics but has committed to the historic event, “The ITF or the Olympics are not best friends with the ATP, that’s not a secret,” Zverev was quoted by Tennis Infinity as saying.\n\n“Everybody continues their own tour. Yes, the Olympics is one of the, if not the, most important events we have in sports. So, the best players in the world are always going to play the Olympics over anything else, over points and over prize money.\n\n“All the top players went to Wimbledon a few years back, despite having no points on the line. It’s about prestige, it’s not about points or money. It’s about winning these kinds of titles and having medals for your country.\n\n“That’s what it’s about. I would never choose to play a 500 event over the Olympics. There are no thoughts on that, and I think Washington is going to be quite an interesting 500 event, I would say.“\n\nThe ATP 500 event in Washington will be headlined by Grigor Dimitrov, Ben Shelton, Karen Khachanov and Frances Tiafoe as they are among those that have chosen ranking points over the Olympic experience.\n\nAs for Zverev he is continuing his Olympic preparations in Hamburg where he will face Pedro Martinez in the semi-finals.\n\nRafael Nadal has revealed his delight at reaching the semi-finals in Bastad after a four hour victory over Mariano Navone.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion prevailed in a marathon 6-7(2) 7-5 7-5 victory to reach his first semi-final since Wimbledon 2022.\n\nThe Spaniard converted ten of his 21 break point opportunities as he reached the semi-finals.\n\nAfter the match Nadal revealed his delight at reaching the last four and prevailed Navone for his resilient display, “I lost for some moments my concentration, but I was able to hold physically until the end,” Nadal told the ATP website.\n\n“That is so important for me. Let’s see how I am tomorrow, but today I am alive and in the semi-finals, so that’s very important. There were a lot of changing dynamics in every single set. For moments, he was in control. For moments, I was in control. But at the end, no one was in control! That’s true, and I had a good chance in the second with 3-0. Then I was very close to losing the match in the second set.\n\n“In the third [I was ahead] again with 5-2, but he’s a great fighter and he played a great match. I wish him all the very best for the rest of the season.”\n\nNadal will now play Duje Ajdukovic in the semi-finals as he aims to continue his eight match winning streak in Bastad with this being his first appearance at the tournament since winning the title in 2005.\n\nThe other semi-final will be Nuno Borges against Thiago Agustin Tirante with both players reaching their maiden ATP tour semi-final."
