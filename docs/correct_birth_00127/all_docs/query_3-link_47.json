        "text": "Monica Seles turned professional in 1989 and proceeded to beat Chris Evert in the final at Houston to secure her first title in the professional ranks. That same year she was runner-up at Dallas and Brighton and also defeated Zina Garrison and Manuela Maleeva on the way to the semifinal at Roland Garros, where she was beaten in three sets by Steffi Graf. It was only in December of that year that Monica turned 16 years of age and it was clear to see that she would be a major force in the women's game over the forthcoming years. She did not have to wait long for that all-important first Grand Slam title as in the 1990 French Open final she overcame the challenge of World No. 1 Steffi Graf 7-6, 6-4. With that victory she became the youngest winner of the French Open and the youngest winner of a Grand Slam title that century. It proved to be a memorable year for Seles as she also recorded victories in Italy, Berlin, Oakland, the LIPC, San Antonio, Los Angeles, Tampa and the VS Championships. The split with her longtime coach Nick Bollettieri who, she felt, was spending too much time coaching Andre Agassi did not appear to affect her greatly and thereafter she was coached only by her father. She won 36 matches in succession but Zina Garrison ended this run by beating her 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinal at Wimbledon. During the year she beat Martina Navratilova three times and Steffi Graf twice and ended 1990 ranked No. 2 in the world and being voted the WTA's Most Improved Player.\n\nThe year of 1991 proved to be a truly memorable one for Monica Seles as she won ten titles, three of which were Grand Slams. The first of these Grand Slam titles came at the Australian Open where she defeated Jana Novotna 5-7, 6-3, 6-1. At that time she was 17 years 2 months and this made her the youngest ever winner of the event, usurping Margaret Smith by four months who had set the previous record in 1960. Monica's next Grand Slam success came when she defended her French crown thanks to a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario but the opportunity of going for the Grand Slam was passed up when she withdrew from Wimbledon just 72 hours before the start of the tournament. Seles cited the reason for her withdrawal as a shin splint injury that she had been suffering from but she had recovered sufficiently to play in an exhibition match soon afterwards. Her punishment was a $6, 000 fine for dropping out of Wimbledon and a further $20, 000 for playing in the exhibition match. That incident was soon put firmly behind her, however, and she completed a hat-trick of Grand Slam titles for the year with victory at the U.S. Open. The final saw Seles overcome that legend of the women's game, Martina Navratilova, by a 7-6, 6-1 scoreline. Monica had risen to the position of World No.1 for the first ever time in March of that year and, after exchanging the position on and off with Steffi Graf during the summer, she finished the year firmly ensconced as Number 1. The fact that Seles reached the final of each of the 16 tournaments that she entered illustrated perfectly just what a remarkable year she had enjoyed.\n\nMonica Seles started 1993 in similar fashion to how she had started the previous two years - by winning the Australian Open. Monica eased through the first four rounds, losing just eight games, before seeing off Julie Halard-Decugis 6-2, 6-7, 6-0 in the quarter-finals. Gabriela Sabatini was then brushed aside 6-1, 6-2 in the semi's to set up a meeting with Seles' old adversaray Steffi Graf in the final. Despite losing the first set 6-4, Monica was not to be denied and rallied to take the final two sets 6-3, 6-2. Tragically that proved to be the only Grand Slam event that Seles would compete in during 1993 and, indeed, her only Slam event until the U.S. Open of 1995. The reason for this was a horrifying incident on 30th April in the Hamburg tournament which saw Monica stabbed in the back by a deranged German man during a change-over in her quarter-final match with Magdalena Maleeva.\n\nIt was a long road back from the injury and Monica missed a total of twenty-seven and a half months before making her long awaited return in the 1995 Canadian Open. It was a splendid return for Seles as not only did she win the tournament but also set a record for the least number of games played by the champion - just 74 - during victories over Kimberley Po, Nathalie Tauziat, Anke Huber, Gabriela Sabatini and Amanda Coetzer. In her first Grand Slam tournament since the stabbing incident Seles made it all the way to the final of the '95 U.S. Open courtesy of victories over Ruxandra Dragomir Ilie, Erika De Lone, Yone Kamio, Anke Huber, Jana Novotna and Conchita Martinez without so much as dropping a set. The final proved one bridge to far as Steffi Graf took the honours, but not without a fight from Monica who crushed the German 6-0 in the second set. (David Scranage)"
