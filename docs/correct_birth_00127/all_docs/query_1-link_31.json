        "text": "Byline: Rosemary Feitelberg\n\nNEW YORK — The little girl who paged through issues of German Vogue she couldn’t afford to buy at the neighborhood kiosk in Novi Sad, Hungary, made her fortune slicing tennis balls, not fabric.\n\nBut before her Grand Slam trophies and the Nike endorsement, Monica Seles had another passion — fashion. Now those worlds have merged.\n\nShe will be the first female athlete to have her own line of Nike apparel. But developing women’s tennis wear for Nike is a sideline, something the 26-year-old does when she’s not collecting tennis titles.\n\nWhen Seles returned to professional tennis in the summer of 1995, after being stabbed by a deranged spectator in Germany, she switched camps from Fila to Nike. (Prior to the move, Fila filed a lawsuit against Seles for not fulfilling her contract requirements. The case was settled out of court last year.)\n\nJimi Hendrix provided the inspiration for Seles’s first signature Nike shoe, called Air Haze, but her fashion sense is more focused.\n\nFor design meetings with Nike, Seles routinely serves up 40 clips from catalogs, fashion and entertainment magazines, and an occasional favorite piece of apparel. She routinely refers to biographies about Coco Chanel, as well as editions of Australian Vogue and German Vogue.\n\nSeles, who dons diamonds and tennis dresses to press events, more often chooses Holly Golightly looks than a James Bond babe’s. When Nike designers suggested knocking off a sexy dress worn by one of the vixens in a Bond movie, Seles countered with a clip from “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” — one of her favorite flicks.\n\n“The Bond dress was a little too open, if you know what I mean,” she laughed. “I really like the neckline of the black dress Audrey Hepburn wore in ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s.’ I have a copy of the tape, so I showed Nike.” Nike plans to offer necklines in this style in spring 1998.\n\nSeles has Hepburn’s strength and beauty in that she is demure about it, said Rebecca Kauffman, apparel designer for Nike.\n\n“Monica is calm and sweet. There is a side to her that is so real,” Kauffman said.\n\nSeles is also a big fan of “The Power of Style,” released by Crown Publishers in November 1994, a book describing symbols of style, like Jacqueline Kennedy and Babe Paley. Seles said she likes the cool looks of Grace Kelly and Forties-era model Slim Keith, on whom Lauren Bacall was said to have modeled her character in “To Have and Have Not.”\n\n“Some ladies really knew how to dress,” said Seles, who admires Kelly’s elegance, but readily admits, “Her face was a huge bonus.”\n\nThese days, Sharon Stone, Nicole Kidman and Winona Ryder are some of the style-makers Seles looks to.\n\nBallet is also a source of inspiration. Seles abandoned ballet at the age of eight to devote more time to tennis — a sport her older brother had already mastered. Her arabesque might not be up to form, but Seles said she still favors ballerinas’ clean, functional looks.\n\nThat simplicity is evident in her own style. Off the court, the 5-foot-11-inch Seles, who wears a size 10, prefers elegant Calvin Klein, John Galliano and Prada fashions. Calvin Klein black cotton cigarette pants are an all-time favorite, she said.\n\n“Galliano is pretty tough for me to wear to the places I go,” she said.\n\nSeles, who also says she has a practical side, added, “When I buy something, I ask myself, ‘Will I be able to wear this in five or 10 years.”‘\n\nShopping is one of the greatest advantages of traveling to the world-class cities on the pro tennis circuit, said Seles, who routinely extends stays in Manhattan and Los Angeles to check out Barneys New York, Bagutta or Maxfield’s.\n\nAfter the French Open, Seles usually frequents unknown, quaint boutiques and ballet shops in the narrower streets of Paris.\n\nBut Seles insists she’s no spendthrift.\n\n“I know how hard I have to work, so I’m pretty good about what I spend. “If I do well in a tournament and like something, I’ll buy it. I give myself a little bonus,” she said.\n\nNike is counting on Seles to send in the shoppers during upcoming Grand Slam tournaments. In fact, Nike considers her such a trendsetter that the company is trying a new retail strategy with her. Coinciding with the Australian Open, which starts next Wednesday in Melbourne, Nike will introduce at retail the warm-up and tennis dress that Seles wears during the competition. In the past, tennis wear worn by Nike athletes was not readily available for amateurs.\n\nSeles said she is happy to offer Nike tips on fashion and function.\n\n“In a fashion show, models walk down the runway, and they don’t have to sweat. In a tennis match, you want to look good in the beginning and at the end — after two hours on the court,” she said. “Comfort is so key. When I’m out there playing, the number one thing is wearing something functional. It doesn’t only look good out there.”"
