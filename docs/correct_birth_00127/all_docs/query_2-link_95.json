Hailing from the former Yugoslavia, she became known for her powerful double-handed groundstrokes and fearless attitude on the court. Seles dominated women's tennis during her peak years and left an indelible mark on the sport, captivating fans worldwide with her electrifying style of play.\n\nBorn in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (now Serbia) in 1973, Monica Seles displayed her exceptional talent from an early age. She started playing tennis at the tender age of five, under the guidance of her father, Karolj Seles. Impressed by her prodigious abilities, he dedicated himself to honing her skills and shaping her into a great champion. Seles quickly rose through the ranks and turned professional at just 14 years old in 1988.\n\nSeles wasted no time making her mark on the tennis circuit, capturing the spotlight with her aggressive playing style. Her signature technique included employing a powerful and precise double-handed forehand and backhand, a rarity in womenâ€™s tennis at the time. This unorthodox style, combined with her fierce determination, made Seles an unstoppable force on the court.\n\nIn 1989, at the age of 16, Seles became the youngest-ever French Open champion. She defeated then-world No. 1 Steffi Graf in a thrilling final, showcasing her immense potential and resilience. This victory catapulted Seles into the limelight and set the stage for her illustrious career.\n\nSeles continued her domination of womenâ€™s tennis in the early 1990s. From 1990 to 1992, she achieved an astonishing feat by winning a total of eight Grand Slam titles, including back-to-back victories at the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open in 1991 and 1992. Her ruthless on-court demeanor and unwavering focus made her virtually unbeatable during this period.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck the tennis world in 1993 when Seles was viciously attacked by a deranged spectator during a match in Hamburg, Germany. The incident left her with a knife wound and psychological trauma that forced her to take a two-year hiatus from the sport. Seles' absence was keenly felt by fans and players alike, as she was at the peak of her career and had the potential to reach even greater heights.\n\nSeles returned to the sport in 1995, displaying remarkable resilience and determination. Although she faced physical and emotional challenges, she never lost her competitive spirit. In 1996, Seles proved that she could still compete at the highest level by winning the Australian Open, her ninth Grand Slam title. This remarkable comeback endeared her to fans around the world, who admired her courage and tenacity.\n\nWhile Seles continued to compete at a high level, capturing numerous titles over the next few years, she never quite regained the dominance she had displayed in her youth. Nevertheless, she remained a formidable opponent and an icon of the sport.\n\nBeyond her tennis accomplishments, Monica Seles left an enduring legacy in the way the game is played. Her double-handed groundstrokes revolutionized women's tennis, inspiring a new generation of players to embrace this technique. Seles' style became a blueprint for other aggressive, power-hitting players who followed in her footsteps and reshaped the sport.\n\nToday, Monica Seles is remembered as one of the most talented and impactful players in the history of women's tennis. Her contributions to the game, both on and off the court, have left an indelible mark. Throughout her career, Seles won nine Grand Slam singles titles and reached the pinnacle of the sport, holding the No. 1 ranking for 178 weeks. Her talent, fearlessness, and resilience continue to inspire future generations of tennis players, proving that greatness can endure even in the face of adversity."
