She now resides in Sarasota, Florida. She is 1.79m (5'10 1/2) and approx. 65kg (145 lbs). She plays left-handed(two-handed both sides). She has won 41 singles titles including 9 Grand Slams. Monica was born on December 2, 1973 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia and currently resides in Sarasota, Florida. Monica resumed her career after more than 2 years on the sideline recovering from physical and emotional scars resulting from her April, 1993, stabbing at a tennis tournament in Hamburg, Germany. Although she is only 24, Monica Seles has already won 9 Grand Slam singles titles including 2 consecutive U.S. Open titles, 3 consecutive French crowns and 4 Australian Open titles. In 1991 and 1992, Monica was the Number One ranked player in the world, the youngest player in tennis history to be the top-ranked player. Monica returned to tennis in 1995, winning the Canadian Open, before she lost to Steffi Graf in the finals of the U.S. Open. Losing after a courageous battle which saw her take the second set 6-0.\n\nIn 1996 Monica blizted the field at the Sydney International and the Australian open to retain her unbeaten record down under. Although there was the absence of Graf, Monica still played excellant tennis and didn't loose a set throughout the whole open. Throughout `96 Seles won at Eastbourne on Grass, Montreal on Hard and at Tokyo which was also on Hard. Seles was runner up at the US Open where she lost to Graf and slipped to the ranking of number 2.\n\n1997 could be described as the year that wasn't. For the first time since her rookie year, Seles did not reach at least one Grand Slam final. With the dominance of Hingis and the absence of Graf, Seles fell to Hingis on four occasions. Three of them at finals of tournaments and one at the semi-final of the French Open. In `97 Monica won three titles but all in the absence of Hingis and Graf. She won at Los Angeles, Toronto and Tokyo.\n\n1998 saw Monica start on the wrong foot, missing the Sydney International and Australian Open because of personal reasons, Monica's first tournament was the Lipton Championships at Key Biscayne where she was ambushed in the third round by teen sensation Anna Kournikova. At the post match conference, Monica stated that she had lost the timing and confidence that she once had and the result of no playing in two and a half months.\n\nPersonal probles have loomed large as well. Even before she turned to the Tour, part of Moncia's mind was alwaus with her cancer-stricken father Karolji. There is no overstating how tough this has been on her, for she looks to Karolji as a father, coach and mentor. They share the same sunny personality as well. \"It's been tough . but my dad told me that I should keep doing what I love to do. And I love to play tennis.\"\n\nMonica's outside interests include modeling, acting, skating, swimming, horseback riding, basketball, aerobics and of late the guitar. Monica would like to attend college someday.\n\nMonica has to offer us talent, style, grace, aggression and beauty. She also has the biggest heart on the tour always signing the extra autography for that zealous fan and giving us that warm and encouraging smile win or lose.\n\nÂ©"
