        "text": "Monica Seles, one of the most entertaining tennis player and former World No. 1 of her time.\n\nShe turned the tennis world with her tremendous talent and went on to achieve almost all the success she had to face until she she encountered another serious challenge during her glittering career.\n\nTogether with Fan Arch, we take a deep dive into the incredible journey of this legend of the sport and look at sweet and sour moments of her career as a tennis pro.\n\nBio / Early Life, Tennis Beginnings\n\nMonica Seles was born on December 2, 1973 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia to Hungarian parents.\n\nHer father, Karolj Seles taught her tennis at the age of 5. Seles quickly developed into an outstanding player with a meteoric rise through the ranks, breaking records along the way, such as being the youngest player to achieve the world No. 1 ranking (17 years old).\n\nA Decade in Tennis Unmatched in the History of the Sport\n\nThe impact Seles left on the tennis world is immense. Winning an incredible nine Grand Slam singles titles, leading to her success on and off the court.\n\nSeles was the 1990 French Open Champion at age 16, the youngest ever to win the tournament, a victory she would repeat there in 1991 and 1992.\n\nShe followed this up with triumphs at the US Open in 1991 and 1992 which added to her status as tennis royalty. She also won multiple Tour Finals, and took bronze at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nA Tragic Setback, a Resilient Comeback\n\nA deranged fan of her main rival stabbed Seles on court during a match in Germany in 1993 and she bravely returned to the sport, despite spending the next couple of years picking up her life must faster than her tennis.\n\nThe accident was so traumatic that he reportedly took an almost two-year sabbatical form professional tennis.\n\nAlthough she demonstrated her toughness as she came back to fencing in 1995, her return was fraught with inconsistency and she was never able to reproduce her best performances time and again.\n\nLegacy and Enduring Impact\n\nThough she faced obstacles, Seles' impact will never be forgotten. She was hailed as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, receiving accolades such as \"the greatest woman in the history of the sport\".\n\nHer similarly forceful style with all-out effort and huge groundstrokes was indelibly branded on the sport.\n\nThroughout her career, Seles experienced some milestones that no other player ever achieved, such as the amazing series of making the finals of the six Grand Slam tournaments participated in, and her fighting spirit in individuality, demonstrated in her marathon matches and in her unbeatable winning spirit.\n\nLife Beyond the Tennis: The Good & the Bad\n\nThe album features a title song written by Seles, following her retirement from professional tennis in 2008, teaching at tennis clinics and talking about her eating disorder.\n\nHer first foray into fiction was the \"The Academy\" series, begun in 2014, set in a tennis boarding school; one book in the series remains unpublished.\n\nIn addition to her remarkable talent, Monica Seles' professional tennis career is a story of one of the greatest comebacks in tennis history and also one of the all-time examples of overcoming the odds and leaving a lasting impact on her sport.\n\nHer dominance, combined with the adversities she faced, makes her an undeniably mythical figure in the sport of tennis.\n\nNever Underestimate the Heart of a Champion\n\nthrough all the highs and lows, even after eight years away from the game, Monica Seles remains an inspiration to young athletes and a true icon in the storied history of tennis, her influence upon the sport-and those who still look to her as a shining role model-forever cast in stone."
