        "text": "Monica Seles Biography\n\nNamed as one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present, and Future\" by Time magazine, Monica Seles is a retired former world number 1 tennis player from Yugoslavia. She began playing at a young age where she quickly exhibited her talent when she was just 16 years old and won the French Open. That victory was the first of Monica's nine grand slam titles and it made her the youngest ever French Open champion. While she is known for her immense success on the court, she is also known for being the victim of a stabbing when a fan came onto the court and stabbed her in the back. She recovered from her injuries and continued on to even more success.
