His voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with over half a billion records in circulation.[1]\n\nCrosby won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way, and was nominated for his reprise of the role in The Bells of St. Mary's opposite Ingrid Bergman the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character.[2]\n\nIn 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (a star for motion pictures, radio, and audio recording).[3]\n\nHarry \"Bing\" Lillis Crosby, Jr. was born May 3, 1903 in Tacoma, Washington.[4] He was the son of bookkeeper Harry Lowe Crosby, and his wife Catherine Helen \"Kate\" (née Harrigan). He was the fourth of seven children including brothers Larry, Everett, Ted, and Bob; and two sisters, Catherine and Mary Rose.[5][6]\n\nThe Crosby's moved to Spokane, Washington, when Bing was about three years old, which is where Bing was raised and later attended Gonzaga University for three years.[7]\n\nCrosby's mother was a second generation Irish-American, and his father was of English descent. Some of his ancestors had emigrated to America in the 17th century, including Mayflower passenger William Brewster.[8]\n\nOn September 29, 1930, Crosby married singer/actress Wilma Winifred Wyatt popularly known as Dixie Lee in Hollywood, California.[9] Together they would have four sons, Gary, Dennis, Phillip, and Lindsay, before Wilma's death due to ovarian cancer on November 1, 1952.[10]\n\nCrosby was a celebrity friend of golf who founded his own PGA Tour event (AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am). He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1978.[11]\n\nCrosby passed away from a heart attack on October 14, 1977 at a golf course in Madrid, Spain after completing a tour of England. His last words were reportedly, \"That was a great game of golf, fellers.\".[12]\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"On the Record: How did Bing Crosby get his nickname?\". Bristol Herald Courier.
