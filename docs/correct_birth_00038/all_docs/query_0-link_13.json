In 1910 Valentine began calling Harry “Bingo.” This caught on with his friends and family, and eventually the name was shortened to “Bing.”\n\nBing graduated from Gonzaga High School in 1920 and in the fall began attending Gonzaga University with the intention of becoming a lawyer. Because Bing and his family lived so close to Gonzaga, Bing and his brothers were day students.\n\nWhile at Gonzaga, Bing began playing drums and in 1921 joined a six piece combo group called The Musicaladers. They played at dances and private parties, and other places around town, and eventually Bing left school to focus on music.\n\nA life-long supporter of Gonzaga University, Bing received an honorary degree from Gonzaga in 1937 and contributed to its library campaign in 1957. Gonzaga honored him with its highest award, the DeSmet Medal, in 1968.\n\nHe died October 14, 1977 from a heart attack while playing golf near Madrid, Spain.\n\nKey facts:\n\nHe made more studio recordings than any other singer.\n\nHe recorded the most popular record ever, “White Christmas”, the only single to make American pop charts twenty times.\n\nBetween 1927 and 1962 he scored 368 charted records under his own name, compared to Elvis (149), Beatles (68).\n\nHe scored the most number one hits ever, 38 compared to the Beatles (24), Elvis (18)\n\nAppearing in 104 films, he was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor three times and won for Going My Way in 1944.\n\nHe financed and popularized the development of tape, revolutionizing the recording industry.\n\n(Giddins, Pocketful of Dreams, 2001)\n\nThe Crosby family sold their home in 1936 for $3,500 to C.P. and Margaret Higgins. Later on, Mrs. Higgins rented out rooms to Gonzaga students. After her death, the family sold the house to the Gonzaga Alumni Association in 1980. When the Alumni Association moved across the street to the former Bishop White Seminary in 2009, ownership was transferred to the University, which uses the second floor bedrooms for offices.\n\nMore information, and the remainder of the vast Crosby collection, is available through the University Archives and Special Collections Department (UASC) at Foley Library.\n\nBing Crosby Collection at Foley Library."
