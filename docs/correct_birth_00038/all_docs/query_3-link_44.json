        "text": "One of America's most endearing entertainters, Bing Crosby was one of the first people to attain massive crossover success as a popular figure, having equally successful careers in music and film. Born in Tacoma, Washington in 1903, Crosby became the first vocalist to achieve star billing with a big band after joining the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in 1926. More success came as the featured star of The Rhythm Boys after leaving Whiteman.\n\nThe 1930s continued to see not only a continued string of musical successes, but also Crosby's break into film. Starring in several short comedies during this time, often pairing up with comedian Bob Hope. His career as an actor reached its peak in 1944, when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Going My Way.\"\n\nCrosby would branch out in several different directions in the 1950s. He became a regular sight on television, as well as becoming actively involved in the world of sports, owning several thoroughbred race horses as well as being partial owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team. He passed away in 1977."
