        "text": "Full Name: Harry Lillis Crosby, Jr.\n\nProfession: Singer and Actor\n\nBiography: Bing Crosby was arguably the biggest star of the first half of the 20th Century. He is the best-selling recording artist ever with sales of over half a billion records in circulation. His single \"White Christmas (1941) is still the best-selling single of all time.\n\nCrosby as a singer was famous for his trademark bass-baritone voice and his more conversational, intimate style. He was helped by the development of the microphone at this time and ushered in the age of the crooner.\n\nIn addition to \"White Christmas\" three other of his songs have also been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, \"Swinging on a Star\", Pennies from Heaven\" and \"Don't Fence Me In\".\n\nCrosby became a major Hollywood star winning an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture \"Going My Way\". He also appeared in seven successful \"The Road to\" films with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour.\n\nBorn: May 3, 1903\n\nBirthplace: Tacoma, Washington, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rabbit\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
