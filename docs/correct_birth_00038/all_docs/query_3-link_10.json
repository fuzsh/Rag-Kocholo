        "text": "Bing Crosby\n\nHarry Lillis Crosby, better known as Bing Crosby (May 3, 1903 â October 14, 1977) was one of the most popular and influential American singers and actors of the 20th century whose career flourished from 1926 until his death in 1977.\n\nIn terms of his influence on popular music and popular culture he is rivaled only by Elvis Presley and The Beatles.\n\nKnown for his large range, rich baritone and vibrant, clear enunciation, Crosby is considered one of the finest vocalists ever, and is credited as being the inspiration for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Dean Martin and more recently Michael BublÃ©. In 1992, Artie Shaw offered his opinion of Crosby's place in American culture in these terms: \"The thing you have to understand about Bing Crosby is that he was the first hip white person born in the United States\".\n\nIn 1962 Crosby was the first person to receive the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nEarly life\n\nHarry Lillis Crosby was born in Tacoma, Washington on May 3, 1903 in a house that his father built (1112 North J Street, Tacoma, Washington). His family later moved to Spokane, Washington in 1906 to find work. He was the fourth of seven children - five boys Larry (1895-1975), Everett (born 1896), Ted (born 1900) and Bob (1913-1993) and two girls Catherine (born 1905) and Mary Rose (born 1907) - born to English-American Harry Lowe Crosby (1871-1950), a bookkeeper and Irish-American Catherine Harrigan (1873-1964), (affectionately known as Kate), the daughter of a builder from County Mayo in Ireland. His paternal ancestors Thomas Prence and Patience Brewster were born in England and immigrated to the U.S. in the 17th century; Brewster's family came over on the Mayflower.\n\nIt should be noted that Bing Crosby had no birth certificate and that his birth date was shrouded in mystery until his childhood Roman Catholic church in Tacoma, Washington, released the baptismal records that revealed his date of birth.\n\nThe nickname \"Bing\" was bestowed upon on him by a childhood friend, Valentine Hobart, who shared Bing's interest in a newspaper comic strip called \"The Bingville Bugle\". Valentine Hobart began calling Harry Crosby \"Bingo from Bingville.\" Eventually the nickname was shortened to \"Bing\" and was adopted by Bing's other friends and even his teachers.\n\nBing Crosby's parents loved music and they both loved to sing. Bing was even sent away to singing lessons, but dropped out because he did not like the demands of the training. Bing's favorite singer and idol was Al Jolson. However, Bing's style is quite different from Jolson's loud, high volume approach to singing.\n\nBing enrolled in the Jesuit-run Gonzaga College in Spokane, Washington in the fall of 1920 with the intent to become a lawyer. While in Gonzaga he sent away for a set of mail order drums. After much practice he soon became good enough and was invited to join a local band which was made up of mostly local high school kids called the \"Musicaladers\", managed by one Al Rinker. He made so much money doing this he decided to drop out of school during his final year, to pursue a career in show business.\n\nIn 1926, Crosby caught the eye of Paul Whiteman (a.k.a The King of Jazz) while singing on the vaudeville in Los Angeles. Hired to join one of the most popular bands in America, the fledgling vocalist would receive a musical education from the greatest musicians of the era. Unlike the typical vaudeville \"shouters,\" he learned to work the microphone (and the crowd) drawing the audience in with his smooth, gentle crooning.\n\nBing soon became the star attraction of the band and sang Whiteman's biggest hit of 1928, \"Ol' Man River.\" However, his repeated youthful peccadilloes forced Whiteman to fire him 1930. Crosby had no desire to step out on his own, but was now forced into a solo career.\n\nIn early 1931, Bing landed his first hit under his own name with \"I Surrender, Dear.\" He contined to chart throughout the year with \"Out Of Nowhere,\" \"Just One More Chance,\" \"Wrap your Troubles In Dreams\" and \"I Found A Million Dollar Baby.\" Crosby became so popular that Mack Sennett (of Keystone Kops fame) signed him up for six two reelers, each based on one of his songs. (Today this is Redistributed under the title of \"Road to Hollywood.\")\n\nThat same year (1931), Bing made his solo debut, co-starring with The Carl Fenton Orchestra on a popular CBS radio show and by 1936, replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as the host of NBC's Kraft Music Hall, a weekly radio program where he would remain for the next ten years.\n\nCrosby's entertainment trifecta led to major motion picture contract with Paramount Pictures beginning with The Big Broadcast Of 1932. This led to his appearances in 79 Movies, most of which he headlined. Perhaps most fondly remembered as an actor for the series of seven jaunty musical comedy \"Road pictures\" with Bob Hope (Road to Morocco, Road to Bali, etc.), he also won 5 Academy Awards in various categories and was nominated for another three.\n\nDuring the War, Crosby gave great emphasis to live appearances before American troops fighting in the European Theater. He also learned how to pronounce German from written scripts, and would read them in propaganda broadcasts intended for the German forces. The nickname \"der Bingel\" for him was understood to have become current among German listeners, and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of WWII, Crosby topped the list as the person who did the most for G.I. morale (beating out Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and one Leslie Townes \"Bob Hope\"\n\nCrosby's biggest musical hit was his recording of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\", which he introduced through a 1941 Christmas-season radio broadcast and the movie Holiday Inn. Bing's recording hit the charts on Oct. 3, 1942, and rose to #1 on Oct. 31, where it stayed for an amazing 11 weeks. In the following years Bing's recording hit the top-30 pop charts another 16 times, even topping the charts again in 1945 and January of '47. The song remains Bing's best-selling recording, and the best-selling Christmas single of all-time with estimates between 30 to 45 million albums sold. In 1998 after a long absence, his 1947 version hit the charts in Britain, and as of 2005 remains the North American holiday-season standard.\n\nCrosby also had regular radio shows from the 1930s through the 1950s. During the 1940s he recorded many songs with the Andrews Sisters. He starred in a network television sitcom in 1964 and 1965, and made numerous short films and television appearances.\n\nCrosby's desire to pre-record his radio shows, combined with a dissatisfaction with the available aluminum recording disks, was a significant factor in the development of magnetic tape recording and the radio industry's adoption of it. Crosby became an investor in Ampex, and Bing Crosby Enterprises became a distributor of the Ampex 200 tape recorder used to record the radio programs. History repeated when Crosby was asked to do a television show and demanded that it be pre-recorded, spurring the development and adoption of videotape.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nAs arguably the most popular musical act of the 20th century, Bing Crosby played a central role in American cultural and musical history. Even today his statistics are dazzling; 1,700 recordings, 383 of those in the top 30, and of those, 41 hit No. 1. For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943-1954) he was among the top 10 in box office draw, and for five of those years (1944-49) he was the largest in the world. He sang four [[Academy Award]-winning songs (For \"Sweet Leilani\" [1937], \"White Christmas\" [1942], \"Swinging on a Star\" [1944], \"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\" [1951] and won an acting Oscar for \"Going My way\" [1943], a movie in which he also won two Golden Globe Awards. He also collected 23 gold and platinum records which is quite amazing considering gold and platinum records did not come into existence until 1958, after which Crosby was considered retired. In 1962 Crosby became the first recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a list that now contains a plethora of musical legends. He has been inducted into the respective halls of fame for both radio and popular music. His music sales are estimated at between 500 000 000 (Five Hundred Million) to 900 000 000 (Nine Hundred Million).\n\nCrosby was married twice. He was married to actress/nightclub singer Dixie Lee from 1930 until her death from ovarian cancer in 1952. They had four sons (Gary, Dennis, Phillip and Lindsay). Dixie was an alcoholic, and the 1947 film Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman is indirectly based on her life. After Dixie's death, Bing married the much-younger actress Kathryn Grant in 1957 and they had three children together, including Harry, Mary, (best known as being the woman who shot J.R. Ewing on Dallas) and Nathaniel.\n\nAfter Bing's death from a heart attack at age 74 while golfing in Madrid, Spain, his eldest son from his first marriage, Gary Crosby, wrote a highly critical memoir (Going My Own Way) depicting him as an autocratic and abusive father. However, Phillip Crosby has frequently spoken against Gary's claims about their father. In an interview conducted in 1999 by the Globe, Phillip is quoted as saying, \"My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was, He was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging dad's name through the mud. He wrote it (Going My Own Way) out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity and that was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. And he loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.\" Phillip passed away in 2004.\n\nTwo of Bing's children, Lindsay and Dennis, committed suicide. Denise Crosby, Dennis' daughter, is also an actress and best known for her role as Tasha Yar on Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nNathaniel Crosby, his youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the U.S. Amateur at age 19 in 1981, becoming the youngest-ever winner of that event (a record later broken by Tiger Woods).\n\nAt his death, he was worth over $150 million USD due to his shrewed investments in oil, real estate, and other commodities, making him one of Hollywood's then wealthiest residents along with Fred MacMurray and best friend Bob Hope. He left a clause in his will stating that his sons from his first marriage could not collect their inheritance money until they were in their 80s. Bing felt that they had already been amply taken care of by a trust fund set up by their mother, Dixie Lee. All four sons continued to collect monies from that fund until their deaths. However, none lived long enough to collect any of their inheritance from their father.\n\nNOTE: Due to instructions from his family, the year of birth engraved on Bing Crosby's tombstone is 1904, rather than the correct date, 1903.\n\nBio from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby"
