        "text": "Bing Crosby was one of the finest American singers of the early 20th century known for his baritone voice. His ‘archetypal crooning’ was appropriate at that time when sound-recording techniques were getting advanced and sound motion pictures started coming into existence. He earned recognition after launching his own program at the CBS radio station in New York City, soon after which he began getting offers from Hollywood. At this point in his career, he was also emerging as a singer and later millions of copies of his records were sold. He rose to prominence with ‘White Christmas’, which later became one of the most successful singles of all time. During his time, he was credited with nearly 300 hit singles that topped the music charts. His career took a different turn, when he teamed with his friend Bob Hope, an American comedian and starred in seven successful ‘Road’ film series, with him. He soon began to prove his mettle as an actor and became the recipient of various prestigious awards. In his later years, his work reduced considerably and he began appearing in several television programs, and hosted his own show. He was often admired for his persona and his occasional ‘crooning’."
