        "text": "Bing Crosby Biography\n\nBing Crosby was an American singer and actor who was born Harry Lillis Crosby Jr. He was the world’s first multimedia star and one of the most popular and influential musical performers of the twentieth century. From 1926 to 1977, he was the industry leader in record sales, radio ratings, and movie grosses. He directed more than 70 feature films and recorded over 1,600 songs. Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon were all impacted by his early career, which coincided with recording breakthroughs that allowed him to create an intimate singing style. His song “White Christmas” is one of his most famous songs till today.\n\nCrosby was born in Tacoma, Washington, on May 3, 1903. The purchase of a novel instrument — the phonograph — coincided with his move to Spokane with his family. Crosby enjoyed listening to music on the phonograph, particularly Al Jolson’s work. Crosby got his renowned moniker “Bing” when he was seven years old, and it derives from the comic strip “The Bingville Bugle,” which he enjoyed.\n\nCrosby received his schooling at a Catholic school, reflecting his mother’s strong religion. Gonzaga High School, which was run by Jesuits, was his alma mater. Crosby gave up his plans to become a lawyer while at Gonzaga University to pursue his goals of being a musician. As a singer and drummer, he was a member of a band named the Musicaladers.\n\nDuring World War II, he was described as “the guy who had done the most for the morale of foreign personnel” by Yank magazine. In 1948, he was voted the “most admired man alive” in the United States, ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. According to Music Digest in 1948, his recordings accounted for more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours of recorded radio music.\n\nCrosby won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Going My Way (1944), and was nominated for the sequel, The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), starring Ingrid Bergman, making him the first of only six performers to be nominated twice for the same role. Crosby won the first Grammy Global Achievement Award in 1963.\n\nIn the categories of motion movies, radio, and audio recording, he is one of 33 people who have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. From 1940 through 1962, he was noted for his collaborations with his friend Bob Hope, starring in the Road to… films.\n\nCrosby had a significant impact on the post-World War II recording business. After viewing a demonstration of a German broadcast-quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to the US by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in the California electronics business Ampex to manufacture replicas. After that, he persuaded ABC to let him tape his shows. He was the first performer to use magnetic tape to mix his commercial records and pre-record his radio broadcasts.\n\nHe created his radio programs using the same directorial tools and skills used in motion picture production (editing, retaking, rehearsing, and time shifting), a process that became industry standard.] In addition to his early work with audio tape recording, he helped finance the creation of videotape, purchased television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, which won two World Series during his ownership (1960 and 1971).\n\nCrosby’s was one of the most successful and well-known musical acts of the twentieth century. Throughout his career, Billboard magazine used a variety of approaches. His chart performance, however, remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including around 41 number one hits. Between 1931 and 1954, Crosby had distinct charting singles every year; the annual re-release of “White Christmas” prolonged that streak to 1957.\n\nIn 1939 alone, he had 24 different hit singles. Crosby was America’s most successful recording artist in the 1930s and again in the 1940s, according to Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn. Crosby was named “First Citizen of the Record Industry” in 1960 after selling 200 million records. According to various reports, he sold 300 million (data from 1992) or perhaps 1 billion recordings (data from 2014) globally. According to Guinness World Records, the single “White Christmas” sold over 50 million copies.\n\nAccording to the book Million Selling Records, he received 23 gold and platinum records. Crosby’s record sales were minimal at the time, thus the Recording Industry Association of America did not begin its gold record certification scheme until 1958. Record companies used to award gold records before 1958. With the Andrews Sisters, Crosby had 23 Billboard singles from 47 recorded songs, and their Decca record sales were second only to Crosby’s throughout the 1940s.\n\nCrosby received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1962. He has been honored into the radio and popular music halls of fame. He was elected into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007, as well as the Western Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nBing Crosby Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Many Songs Bing Crosby Recorded?\n\nBing Crosby recorded more than 3,000 songs in his career.
