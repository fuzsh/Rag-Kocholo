        "meta_description": "At\r\none time in the 1940s, the man born Harry Lillis “Bing” Crosby, Jr. in Tacoma,\r\nWashington on this date in 1903 was the top-selling recording star…the\r\nnumber-one box office attraction…and the most popular performer on radio\r\n(headliner of The Kraft Music Hall).  Author Gerald\r\nNachman observed in his book on Radio’s Golden Age, Raised on Radio:\r\n“Pop singing can be divided roughly into ‘AC’ and ‘BC.’  Before Crosby,\r\nsingers sang at you; after Crosby and radio, they sang to you.”  The\r\nYuletide standard White Christmas remains the\r\nbest-selling single of all time (a tune Crosby introduced in the movie\r\nclassic Holiday Inn), and after dedicating years to moviemaking,\r\nBing received a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as a happy-go-lucky priest\r\nin the Academy Award winner for Best Picture that year, Going My Way (1944).Acres\r\nof old growth forests have been cut down to produce paper for the number of\r\nbooks written about “The Old Groaner”—so it seems only fitting that I\r\nconcentrate mostly on Bing’s accomplishments in the aural medium, what with\r\nthis being Radio Spirits and all.  It begins, of course, with Crosby’s\r\nchildhood interest in music—purportedly it was a summer job as a prop boy at\r\nSpokane’s “Auditorium” that stoked his yearning for a musical career; he once\r\nwatched a performance of Al Jolson and later described the experience as\r\n“electric.”  Young Harry attended and graduated from Gonzaga Prep in 1920\r\nand moved on to enrollment at Gonzaga University, where he attended the halls\r\nof ivy for three years.  Crosby never graduated from Gonzaga (however, his\r\nbrother Bob did), but he remains that school’s most famous alumnus; he received\r\nan honorary doctorate in 1937, and the house in which Bing was born now sits on\r\nthe school campus (where, fittingly enough, it once housed the Alumni\r\nAssociation).Bing\r\nquit college to form a band with three other individuals from his high school,\r\nand they called themselves The Musicaladers (with Crosby on “skins”).  The\r\nmusical aggregation broke up after two years, and Crosby and ex-Musicalader Al\r\nRinker—working at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane—formed a band known as The\r\nThree Harmony Aces, which later became The Clemmer Trio (also known as The\r\nClemmer Entertainers, depending on who was in the group at the time). \r\nBing and Al (the brother of singer Mildred Bailey) then decided to try their\r\nluck in California, and (through Mildred’s contacts) became members of The\r\nSyncopation Revue.  Their experience with that group landed them work with\r\nthe Will Morrissey Hall Revue, and then they got the break of a lifetime when\r\nthey were hired by bandleader Paul Whiteman to perform in-between his\r\nnumbers.  Crosby and Rinker, with the hiring of a third musician, Harry\r\nBarris, became The Rhythm Boys—and the trio worked for Whiteman until 1929,\r\nwhen they then joined Gus Arnheim’s orchestra.  Gradually, Bing broke away\r\nfrom the Boys (though Barris would later write some of Der Bingle’s biggest\r\nhits, like I Surrender Dear and Wrap Your Troubles in\r\nDreams) to go solo, spurred on by a recording contract with Columbia\r\nRecords and an offer to make comedy shorts for filmdom’s Mack Sennett.September\r\n2, 1931 marked the debut of Bing Crosby on radio, on a weekly quarter-hour for\r\nCremo cigars over CBS.  His work in the Sennett-produced shorts (Sing,\r\nBing, Sing, Blue of the Night) soon convinced Paramount to move\r\nhim into feature films (though Crosby had previously appeared in such movies\r\nas King of Jazz [1930] and Reaching for the Moon [1931])\r\nand throughout the 1930s the popular crooner acted in such vehicles as College\r\nHumor (1933), We’re Not Dressing (1934), She\r\nLoves Me Not (1934), Mississippi (1935), and Rhythm\r\non the Range (1936).  His CBS radio show expanded to a half-hour\r\nin the fall of 1933 (sponsored by Woodbury Soap), and in December of 1935 the\r\nsinger took over for Al Jolson on NBC’s Kraft Music Hall. Music\r\nHall would be the home of Crosby’s crooning and comedy for nearly\r\na decade; audiences loved Bing’s laid-back approach to music/radio and how the\r\nprogram, in the words of writer Carroll Carroll, “treated baseball as if it\r\nwere opera and opera as if it were baseball.”On\r\nthe Kraft Music Hall, Crosby featured performers who became\r\nbig names like Bob Burns (who would later get his own solo series in 1941),\r\nMary Martin (an already established Broadway performer who took a leave of\r\nabsence in 1942 to be on the show), Victor Borge, Connee Boswell, Jerry Lester,\r\nGeorge Murphy, and Peggy Lee.  John Scott Trotter got established on Music\r\nHall as Bing’s conductor, and two members from Trotter’s band\r\n(Jerry Colonna and Spike Jones) also hit it big.  When Ken Carpenter was\r\nbrought aboard, he became Crosby’s longtime announcer.  While working to\r\npromote Kraft products, Crosby enjoyed incredible success on the pop music\r\ncharts and in the movies, with hits like Rhythm on the River (1940), Birth\r\nof the Blues (1941), and Dixie (1943).  It was\r\naround this time that Bing Crosby started his fruitful association with\r\ncomedian Bob Hope in the entertaining “Road” series that began with Road\r\nto Singapore (1940) and continued with six successful\r\nfollow-ups.  Crosby and Hope engaged in a mock “feud” similar to Jack\r\nBenny and Fred Allen’s, and when one performer appeared on the other’s\r\nprogram—comedic chaos wasn’t far behind.It\r\nwas his role as “Father Chuck O’Malley” in the comedy-drama Going My\r\nWay (1944) that garnered Bing Crosby his solo Oscar trophy and the\r\napproval of his peers.  Bing reprised the O’Malley role in a follow-up\r\nfilm, The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), which netted him a\r\nsecond Academy Award nomination and the actor-singer received his third and\r\nfinal Oscar nod for portraying an alcoholic has-been actor in 1954’s The\r\nCountry Girl.  While his film career was going great guns, things were\r\nnot particularly rosy in the ol’ Music Hall; strained\r\nrelations between Bing, the sponsor, and NBC led the crooner to jump ship to\r\nfledgling ABC and a series entitled Philco Radio Time. \r\nThe big beef between Bing and the boys (dig that Crosby-like alliteration!) was\r\nthat Crosby had wanted to take advantage of the strides made in recording to\r\nstart transcribing his programs in lieu of live broadcasts, allowing him to\r\ntake advantage of when he was in great voice and stockpiling shows so that he\r\ncould devote time to his passions of golf and horse racing.  (The fact\r\nthat Bing had invested heavily in Ampex, the firm that developed magnetic\r\nrecording tape, might have had something to do with Crosby’s decision, too.)Philco Radio Time provided ABC Radio with a much-needed hit (and Crosby’s\r\nvictory in the transcription war later inspired radio performers like Hope and\r\nJack Benny to follow suit), but in 1949 Bing was back on CBS (those darn talent\r\nraids!) with The Bing Crosby Show—where he stayed until 1954\r\nbroadcasting for Chesterfield and General Electric.  (Bing’s last radio\r\neffort was a five-day-a-week quarter hour heard over CBS from November of 1954\r\nto December of 1956.)  The singer’s movies remained popular: Here Comes\r\nthe Groom (1951), Just For You (1952), White\r\nChristmas (1954—a remake of Holiday Inn), High Society (1956),\r\nand Say One for Me (1959) are just a few of the more familiar\r\ntitles.  Like his “feuding” partner Bob Hope, Crosby nixed the idea of\r\ndoing a weekly TV series in lieu of highly-rated boob tube specials and guest\r\nappearances on the programs of those people who did decide to\r\ntackle the small screen grind.By\r\nthe 1960s, despite appearances in films like Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964)\r\nand Stagecoach (1966), Bing Crosby realized that his time in\r\nmotion pictures was just about up—he remarked when he and Bob Hope were\r\ncompleting their final “Road” trip, The Road to Hong Kong (1962):\r\n“Filming is kind of difficult for someone at my time of life.  I’m too old\r\nto get the girl and not old enough to be her granddad.”  Instead, the\r\npopular crooner decided to try his hand with a TV sitcom in the fall of 1964\r\nentitled The Bing Crosby Show, in which\r\nhe played a retired singer who had taken up teaching electrical engineering at\r\na community college.  The show only lasted a season; Crosby had better\r\nluck behind the camera with his own Bing Crosby Productions which produced such\r\nTV hits as Ben Casey and Hogan’s Heroes.Bing\r\nCrosby’s last feature film appearance was a brief bit in the 1974 all-star MGM\r\nextravaganza That’s Entertainment!  He continued\r\nto do TV specials at that time, with a December 1977 outing, Bing Crosby’s\r\nMerrie Olde Christmas, acting as his small screen swan song (this is\r\nthe one where he duets with David Bowie on Peace On Earth/The Little\r\nDrummer Boy).  1977 marked the year of his death at the age of 74; he\r\nwas playing a round of golf on a course in Madrid and after the game collapsed\r\nfrom a massive heart attack twenty yards from the clubhouse.  It would be\r\nno small exaggeration to note that we lost one of the major entertainers in\r\nshow business on that day.Radio\r\nSpirits features our birthday boy’s Philco Radio Time series\r\nas one of several broadcasts in our potpourri collection Comedy Goes West (a January 7,\r\n1948 show with guests Walter O’Keefe and Brace Beemer [a.k.a. The Lone\r\nRanger!]), and you can also listen to Der Bingle on Jack Benny &amp; Friends (a\r\nclassic February 15, 1953 show highlighting “The Life of Bing Crosby”). \r\nFor the pop music side of The Old Groaner, check out the CD sets George Gershwin Collection (They\r\nAll Laughed and Mine [with Judy Garland]), You Make Me Feel So Young (How\r\nDeep is the Ocean, Moonlight Becomes You, Too Marvelous\r\nfor Words, You’re Getting to Be a Habit with Me), Great American Songbook: The Crooners (Just\r\nOne More Chance, Out of Nowhere, Day by Day [with\r\nMel Torme]), With a Song in My Heart: Hooray for Hollywood (Blue\r\nSkies, Swinging on a Star, The Road to\r\nMorocco [with Bob Hope]), and Swing Something Simple (When\r\nYou and I Were Young, Maggie, Deep in the\r\nHeart of Texas, and two duets with his son Gary—Play a Simple Melody and Down by\r\nthe Riverside).  The singer we often associate with the holidays sings\r\nhis classic White Christmas on the CD collections The Very Best of Christmas, Christmas Crooners, and Wonderful Christmas: 75 Essential Christmas Classics…and\r\nperforms other Yuletide favorites on 15 Christmas Favorites, We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\r\nand Do You Hear What I Hear? (my\r\nfavorite Crosby Christmas carol).  In addition, Bing can be spotted in our\r\nDVD collections Bob Hope:\r\nEntertainingthe Troops, Stars in Their Shorts, and Best of Andy Williams.  As the\r\nice cream on the birthday cake, we invite you to drink deeply of Bing Crosby—a massive 3-CD set with\r\nCrosby solos and hit duets featuring the likes of Louis Armstrong, the Andrews\r\nSisters and so many more!",
