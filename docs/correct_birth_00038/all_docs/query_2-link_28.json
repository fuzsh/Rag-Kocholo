        "text": "The city of Spokane is one of the largest cities in Washington state, second only to Seattle. But in 1906, Spokane was a rapidly growing small town and home to a little boy named Harry Lillis Crosby, better known as Bing. The Crosbys were a musical family and lived in Spokane for many years. As a young man in 1925, Bing took his love for the stage to the Clemmer Theater in Spokane, where he worked providing musical entertainment during intermission. Times have changed, and Spokane has grown, but you can still see a show at the historic theater in Washington where Bing Crosby once worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeel the rich history and enjoy the theater the way it was intended in the old days of silent film at the Bing Crosby Theater.
