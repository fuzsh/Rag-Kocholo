        "text": "(1903–77). The most successful entertainer in the early years of radio and talking motion pictures was the U.S. singer, actor, and songwriter Bing Crosby. His casual stage manner and mellow, relaxed singing style influenced two generations of pop singers.\n\nBorn Harry Lillis Crosby in Tacoma, Wash., on May 3, 1903, Crosby began to sing and to play the drums while studying law in Spokane. After a period spent singing with the Paul Whiteman orchestra in 1927, he appeared in the early sound film King of Jazz (1931). He became a star in 1932 after getting his own radio program on the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City. He began appearing in more films, and by the late 1930s his records were selling millions of copies. His songwriting activities included part-authorship of “A Ghost of a Chance” and “Where the Blue of the Night,” his radio theme song. His recording of “White Christmas” became one of the most popular songs of the century, exceeded in record sales only by his rendition of “Silent Night.” In the 1940s he was the star of a popular radio variety show.\n\nCrosby won an Academy award for best actor for his portrayal of Father O’Malley in the film Going My Way (1944). His career took a new turn to comedy in the series of seven “Road” films in which he appeared with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour, beginning with Road to Singapore (1940). His other films include The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), White Christmas (1954), and The Country Girl (1954). His autobiography, Call Me Lucky, appeared in 1953.\n\nCrosby ran a successful television production company in the 1960s. An astute businessman, he amassed one of the largest fortunes in Hollywood from his earnings as an entertainer and from shrewd investments. By the mid-1970s, 400 million copies of his records had been sold. He died on Oct. 14, 1977, while traveling near Madrid, Spain."
