        "text": "When he was 14, Crosby began working at the Spokane Auditorium, where he had the opportunity to see some of the day's biggest performers. Among them, Al Jolson left the largest impression, captivating Crosby with his ad-libbing and spoofs of Hawaiian songs. He later described Jolson's performances as \"electric.\" Crosby went on to attend Gonzaga University for three years, but didn't graduate (though he was later awarded an honorary doctorate).\n\nNaming them the Rhythm Boys, Whiteman gave their careers a major boost with their first recording and booking them shows in Chicago and New York. Additionally, Crosby was soon in high demand as a solo artist on record and radio. In 1928, he had his first number one hit with \"Ol' Man River.\" Despite the success, Crosby soon became dissatisfied with Whiteman, and he and the Rhythm Boys left and joined the Gus Arnheim Orchestra. Soon Crosby's solos began stealing the shows, and he was offered a solo radio broadcast in New York. Crosby made his solo radio debut in September 1931 and was then hired for a weekly 15-minute broadcast that yielded some of the year's best-selling songs.\n\nSoon, Crosby was the leading singer in America, with 10 of the top 50 songs of 1931. In 1932, he starred in his first full-length movie, The Big Broadcast. Following the success of that film, Crosby received a contract with Paramount, filming three movies a year. While he cut down on his live performances, Crosby produced a number of successful records at a time when record sales were low because of the Depression.\n\nOver the next few years Crosby helped usher in the era of the crooner. On Christmas Day, 1941, he debuted his most popular song, \"White Christmas.\" It was featured in Holiday Inn the following year and was re-released for the holidays several times in the coming years.\n\nDuring World War II, Crosby performed for American troops fighting in Europe. At the end of the war, US troops considered Crosby the person who'd done the most for their morale, ahead of President Franklin Roosevelt, General Dwight Eisenhower, and Bob Hope.\n\nCrosby's health began to suffer in the 1970s, though he continued to perform. He suffered a heart attack at a Spanish golf course on October 14, 1977.\n\nCalled \"the greatest entertainer of the 20th century,\" Crosby made more non-rock recordings and placed more songs in the \"Top Ten\" than any other individual singer. His career as an entertainer spanned more than 50 years, during which time he recorded over 1,600 songs and sold more than 500 million records."
