        "text": "Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby Jr. was an American singer and actor. The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1931 to 1954. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin. The biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\", which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. The song remains the bestselling single of all time.\n\nDisney Films[]\n\nCrosby narrated and provided the voices for Ichabod Crane and Brom Bones in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" segment of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949). Although that is his only role in a Disney film, he has served as the inspiration for other Disney characters, such as the crooner in A Symposium on Popular Songs (1962). He was considered for the role of Calvin Bower in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band. He was also considered to voice Baloo in The Jungle Book, Thomas O'Malley in The Aristocats, and Little John in Robin Hood, but was replaced by Phil Harris.\n\nDeath[]\n\nOn October 13, 1977, Crosby flew alone to Spain to play golf and hunt partridge. On October 14, at the La Moraleja Golf Course near Madrid, Crosby played 18 holes of golf. At about 6:30 pm, Crosby collapsed about 20 yards from the clubhouse entrance and died instantly from a massive heart attack. At the clubhouse and later in the ambulance, house physician Dr. Laiseca tried to revive him, but was unsuccessful. At Reina Victoria Hospital, he was administered the last rites of the Catholic Church and was pronounced dead. On October 18, following a private funeral Mass at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Westwood, Crosby was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. A plaque was placed at the golf course in his memory."
