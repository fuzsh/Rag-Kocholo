        "text": "Bing Crosby arrived at Tacoma's Union Station in August of 1942 to help out with WWII bond sales in the town of his birth. Harry Lillis Crosby was born in Tacoma in May of 1903 when his family lived at 1112 North J Street. While in town with a USO troupe to entertain the soldiers at Fort Lewis, he graciously agreed to headline a show on August 6th at 12 noon at the Liberty Center in an effort to promote bond sales. The Tacoma local of the Boilermakers union were noted as buying $50,000 worth of war bonds.\n\nSee more featured images and posts"
