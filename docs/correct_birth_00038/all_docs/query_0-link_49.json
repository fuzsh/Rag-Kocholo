        "text": "He was one of pop culture’s biggest stars of the 1940s, An actor and singer Harry Lillis “Bing” Crosby Jr. He grew up in Tacoma Washington and was born on May 3, 1903 where he originated the nickname “Bing”. One of his neighbor’s enjoyed a comic called The Bingville Bulge which he was then called “Bingo from Bingville” and then later just cut down to “Bing” which stuck. He had 40 #1 hits in the music billboards and was box office star of his time. He originally was going to University studying Law until one day he went to Los Angeles to pursue a career in singing.\n\nWhen I first heard him sing his voice resonated with me since it was so rich and pure I couldn’t help but keep listening. That was the same impersonation he had on most people , his voice in captivating them with all it’s resonance. He started touring with the vaudeville circuit in 1925 which then he met Paul Whiteman and also on the way Harry Barris. These two formed a group at the time called “The Rhythm Boys” and were able to perform with a great artist Duke Ellington. In 1931 he had signed a contract with CBS and Brunswick Records as a solo act on the radio which made him a overnight sensation.\n\nHe then moved into Television and Film which landed him the most well known song by him. In the film “Holiday Inn” he performed the song “White Christmas” which was his biggest hit song of his career. It was released in 1942 but stayed at the top of the charts every time it was re-released for the holiday season. Even though that was his biggest hit he went on to make more films and singing like Father Chuck O’Malley. He was one of the first to have a more intimate connection and jazzy sound to his music unlike other vaudeville artists who were loud and deep.\n\nHis sound so classic and soothing he had a natural voice that enchanted everyone who heard him. This style of intimacy and laid back singing even influenced other male singers like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin In 1977 after a terrible accident he came back to perform his last time on stage and even with the power off he continued to sing. He truly was passionate about his music which showed and I commemorate that.\n\n-Michael Molina"
