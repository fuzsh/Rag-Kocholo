Crosby and Rinker have used Baileys connections in the music world and after their school time they became a member of Paul Whitemans Rhythm Boys. Crosby visited a Jesuit College and studied law. While he was with colleagues on a business trip, he sang in bars and stated, that he earned much more than in his job as a lawyer. He decided on his career as a lawyer to give up forever and relying solely on his singing career to collapse.\n\nSuccesses[Edit][]\n\nHis biggest hit was his version of Irving Berlins song \"White Christmas\", one of the biggest sales successes of all time and after Candle in the Wind Elton John 's number 2 in the eternal bestseller list.

As his second wife, the actressKathryn Grant, significantly younger than Crosby, he also had children later in life. His children from both marriages therefore belonged to different generations. After the death of Bing Crosby, wrote his oldest son from the first marriage a controversial biography in which he describes his father as autocratic.
