        "text": "Bing Crosby, the iconic singer and movie star of the 20th century, left a lasting legacy not just through his timeless music and films, but also through his family. In this article, we explore the lives, careers, and enduring impact of his children.\n\nBing Crosby had four children with his first wife, Dixie Lee: Gary, twins Phillip and Dennis, and Lindsay. All four followed in their father’s footsteps into the entertainment industry, especially as singers and actors. After Dixie Lee’s death, Bing remarried and had three more children with his second wife, Kathryn Grant: Harry, Mary, and Nathaniel. These younger Crosby siblings also ventured into public life, with Harry becoming an actor and investment banker, Mary achieving success as an actress, and Nathaniel focusing on a career outside of Hollywood.\n\nAll About Bing Crosby Children\n\nHere we’ll explore the family history and relationships that Bing Crosby had with each of his seven children –\n\n1. Gary Crosby\n\nGary Crosby, born on June 27, 1933, was the first child of the legendary American singer and actor Bing Crosby and his first wife, Dixie Lee. Standing around 6 feet tall, Gary followed in his father’s footsteps, venturing into the world of entertainment with a focus on acting and singing. During his career, Gary appeared in numerous television shows and films throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Some of his notable acting roles were in TV series like “Adam-12” and “Emergency!”, and he also had a part in the classic war film “Merrill’s Marauders” (1962). As a singer, Gary released several albums and singles, achieving modest success and often performing popular standards, including some songs made famous by his father.\n\nDespite his professional accomplishments, Gary’s personal life was marked by a tumultuous relationship with Bing Crosby. The relationship was strained by Bing’s strict parenting style, which Gary detailed in his controversial 1983 memoir, “Going My Own Way.” In the book, Gary described a harsh upbringing that included physical and emotional abuse, a revelation that shocked many fans of his father.\n\nGary continued to work in entertainment into the 1980s but gradually stepped back from the spotlight. He faced personal struggles with alcoholism, which he openly discussed in his memoir and interviews, reflecting on how these issues affected his life and career.\n\n2. Phillip Crosby\n\nPhillip Crosby, born on July 13, 1934, was one of the twin sons of iconic entertainer Bing Crosby and his wife, Dixie Lee. Phillip and his twin brother, Dennis, grew up in a household deeply entrenched in the entertainment industry, which naturally led him to pursue a career in the same field. Standing at a height of approximately 5 feet 11 inches, Phillip forged a path as both a singer and an actor, often collaborating with his siblings in various productions.\n\nPhillip’s career included a blend of singing and acting, with appearances on television and in stage productions. He often performed alongside his brothers, Gary and Dennis, and the Crosby brothers were known collectively for their musical talents, often appearing together in shows that highlighted their familial harmony. Their performances included a variety of popular music and jazz standards, many of which were associated with their father.\n\nDespite his involvement in show business, Phillip maintained a lower profile compared to some of his siblings, especially Gary, who wrote a revealing memoir about their fathe\n\n3. Bing Crosby’s Children\n\nDennis Crosby, born on July 13, 1934, was one of the twin sons of the legendary entertainer Bing Crosby and his first wife, Dixie Lee. Alongside his brother Phillip, Dennis entered the entertainment industry, showcasing his talents in both singing and acting. The twins often performed together, capitalizing on their familial harmonies and public interest in the Crosby family.\n\nStanding at about 6 feet tall, Dennis had the commanding presence of his father but struggled to establish a distinct identity in the shadow of Bing Crosby’s immense fame. Throughout his career, Dennis appeared in a variety of television shows and performed in nightclubs and on stages around the country. However, unlike his father, Dennis did not achieve the same level of stardom and his career was marked by more modest successes.\n\n4. Lindsay Crosby\n\nLindsay Crosby, born on January 5, 1938, was the youngest of the four sons from Bing Crosby’s marriage to Dixie Lee. As the son of one of the most famous entertainers in the world, Lindsay inevitably entered the world of show business, embarking on a career in both singing and acting. He was known for his appearances in a variety of television shows and some movies, often showcasing his talents in guest spots and minor roles that highlighted his musical heritage.\n\nStanding approximately 6 feet 2 inches tall, Lindsay had a notable physical presence, resembling his father in stature. Despite his promising start, Lindsay found it challenging to carve out a significant niche for himself within the entertainment industry. The immense shadow cast by Bing Crosby’s legacy was a constant pressure, and Lindsay’s career never reached the heights that his father’s had, which was a source of personal discontent and professional frustration.\n\nLindsay’s personal life was also marked by its challenges. He struggled with financial issues, partly due to poor investments and partly due to the high expectations to maintain a lifestyle reminiscent of Hollywood’s golden era, which was increasingly difficult with the modest success he achieved.\n\n5. Harry Crosby\n\nHarry Crosby, born on August 8, 1958, is the eldest child of Bing Crosby from his second marriage to Kathryn Grant. Unlike his half-brothers from Bing’s first marriage, Harry opted for a dual career path that blends his interests in finance and entertainment, reflecting a modern interpretation of the Crosby legacy.\n\nHarry stands at around 6 feet tall, and he has balanced his professional life between being an investment banker and an actor. His education and career in finance provided him with a stable foundation, distinct from the more public-facing careers of his father and older half-brothers. He entered the world of finance after completing his education, specializing in investment banking, where he has been recognized for his expertise and steady approach. Despite his primary focus on banking, Harry did not completely steer away from the entertainment industry. He has appeared in a few film roles, including minor parts in movies during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n6. Mary Crosby\n\nMary Crosby, born on September 14, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, is the second child of legendary singer Bing Crosby and his second wife, Kathryn Grant. Growing up in a family steeped in Hollywood history, Mary naturally gravitated towards acting from a young age. Her breakthrough came with her role as Kristin Shepard in the iconic television series “Dallas,” where she played the character who famously shot J.R. Ewing, a plot twist that became one of the most talked-about moments in TV history.\n\nStanding at a height of 5 feet 5 inches, Mary has had a prolific career in both television and film. After her stint on “Dallas,” she continued to work extensively in the industry, appearing in numerous TV shows and made-for-TV movies throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Her roles often capitalized on her ability to portray complex characters, blending her poised appearance with a knack for dramatic flair.\n\n7. Larry Fortensky\n\nLarry Fortensky, born on January 17, 1952, is perhaps best known for his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor, one of Hollywood’s most celebrated actresses. The couple met in a rather unconventional place for a Hollywood romance: the Betty Ford Clinic, where both were seeking treatment for substance abuse in 1988. Their relationship culminated in a high-profile wedding on October 6, 1991, at Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, an event that attracted massive media attention.\n\nStanding about 6 feet tall, Fortensky was a construction worker by trade, a career far removed from the glitz and glamor of Taylor’s Hollywood lifestyle. This contrast in backgrounds and lifestyles marked much of their relationship, which was both a source of fascination and speculation for the public and press. Despite the initial warmth and mutual support in their relationship, the pressures of such public scrutiny and their different backgrounds eventually led to strains.\n\nThe marriage lasted for five years, ending in 1996. The divorce was reportedly amicable, with Taylor providing financial support to Fortensky afterward, reflecting the genuine affection that had initially brought them together. After their divorce, Fortensky returned to a more private life, largely retreating from the public eye and media attention that had marked his years with Taylor.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bing Crosby’s children have each navigated their own unique paths through life, carrying the weight and privilege of their famous surname. From Gary, Phillip, Dennis, and Lindsay, who each explored the realms of singing and acting, to Harry’s blend of finance and occasional film roles, Mary’s notable impact on television history with “Dallas,” and Nathaniel’s success in the world of golf, the Crosby legacy in entertainment and beyond is as varied as it is fascinating. These siblings have shown resilience and versatility, facing both personal challenges and public scrutiny.\n\nBing Crosby’s Children (All About his Relationships and Children) – FAQs\n\nWhat happened to all of Bing Crosby’s children?\n\nBing Crosby’s children faced significant personal struggles despite their entertainment careers.
