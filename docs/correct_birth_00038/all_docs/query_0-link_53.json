He was one of the first global cultural icons.\nHere are some intriguing facts about him:\n Crosby got his name from a comic strip. Born Harry Lillis Crosby, he was nicknamed “Bing” after a character in the comic strip “The Bingville Bugle.”\n He was an avid golfer and helped to popularize the sport. He played in the U.S. and British amateur championships and started the tournament known as the “Crosby Clambake,” which evolved into the renowned AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n Crosby turned down the role of Columbo, which would have significantly altered the landscape of 1970s television, because he preferred to spend his time golfing.\n His Christmas TV special in 1977 featured the famous duet “Peace on Earth” with David Bowie, which almost didn’t happen because Bowie did not want to sing “The Little Drummer Boy.”\n Besides his love for golf, Crosby was also passionate about horse racing and was a co-founder of the Del Mar Racetrack in San Diego.\n The “Canadian tuxedo,” denim-on-denim, became associated with Crosby after he was nearly denied hotel entry for wearing such an outfit. In response, Levi’s designed a custom denim tuxedo jacket for him.\n\n#BingCrosby #Crooner #happybirthday #EternalMelody #VoiceOfAnEra #HallOfFame #BroadcastLegend #JazzInfluence  #HolidayTunes #VintageVocals  #musicvideo #quotes #interestingfacts #inspiration #musiclife\".",
