Explore the world's largest telescopes (the \"big glass\") and the mysteries they are being used to explore (e.g. the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of the universe itself). See how gamma-ray bursts, explosive fireballs, which foreshadow the birth of black holes at edge of the known universe, are being used to probe the local universe. See how massive clusters of galaxies thousands of times larger than our own Milky Way can gravitationally magnify our view of the distant universe. With the mapmakers as your guides, examine cosmic maps and learn what they reveal about the earliest moments of the universe. We will visit the remotest reaches of our universe and all places in between - including the observatories where we conduct our research and their telescopes, the miracle machines, which can unlock fundamental mysteries of our universe.

This theory of our origins has passed several observational hurdles over the past decade. The definitive confirmation, though, will come when astronomers detect gravity waves generated during inflation. The race is on to find these primordial ripples in the fabric of space-time. Understanding this ultimate of all origins appears to be within our grasp.\n\nin Session \"Origins and Endings: From the Beginning to the End of the Universe\" (Moderator--Angela Olinto, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) --- Over the past decade, our view of both the possible origin and the ultimate fate of the universe have dramatically changed.

Only one percent of the Universe is made of the kind of everyday matter that can be seen with telescopes--the stars, the planets, us. Another 3.5 percent is made of hot gas that can only be seen with X-ray instruments. The rest is a complete mystery: 24 percent is dark matter whose gravity holds our galaxy together, and the remaining 71 percent is dark energy, whose repulsive gravity is causing the expansion of the Universe to speed up, not slow down as expected.\n\nThree prominent scientists--astronomer Rocky Kolb, particle physicist Joe Lykken, and cosmologist Michael Turner--discuss what we know about the nature of dark matter and dark energy. They discuss the roles of particle accelerators and telescopes in solving the mystery of the unseen 96 percent the Universe. They conclude by explaining what all, this means for our understanding of the elementary particles and the fate of the Universe.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Edward W. Kolb; Michael S. Turner\n\nCafe Scientifique: Angela Olinto, \"Chasing Cosmic Bullets\"\n\nThe most energetic particles in the universe are ultra-high energy cosmic rays. They are strange beasts: millions of times more powerful than anything produced by man-made accelerators, concentrated (e.g., one can pack the energy of a fastball into a subatomic particle), and very rare (they occur once/sq km/century). The nature and origin of these cosmic bullets has been a scientific mystery for a century. Recently, an international collaboration of 17 countries joined forces to solve this mystery by building the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is spread over 3,000 square kilometers in the Pampas of Argentina. Auger has captured enough of these rare particles to find the first clues to their origins, which seems to be from nearby galaxies that host super massive black holes. Auger scientists continue to study these most extreme particles to learn where they come from, what they are made of, and how they are accelerated to such enormous energies.\n\nBackground urls:\n\n- Auger Observatory\n\n- Detecting Cosmic Rays: The Auger Observatory and Frontier Science\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Angela V.

Students interested in astrophysics will join us for the KICP lunch talk shortly after 12:00 noon. After the talk, the prospective students will be available to meet KICP members in the LASR conference room.\n\nPlease join us in for a discussion of KICP activities and research opportunities at 1PM in the LASR lounge. After the discussions the students will have time to meet with people individually.\n\nSouth Pole Telescope in 'Around the World in 80 Telescopes' webcast\n\n\"Around the World in 80 Telescopes\" is a unique live 24-hour webcast, following night and day around the globe to some of the most advanced observatories both on and off the planet. You can watch it right here on the 100HA website, and on the 100HA channel on Ustream.tv.\n\nFind out what's happening at a research observatory in your country, or on the other side of the planet, and discover what astronomers are doing right now! Who is observing? What are they researching? What do they hope to discover?\n\nYou'll see a snapshot of life at many different observatories where astronomers will present exclusive images and talk about their work. Some will be observing distant galaxies, searching for extrasolar planets around other stars or studying our own Solar System. Some will be studying the Universe in visible light, others in radio waves or other wavelengths. Some may be working at solar observatories or with telescopes out in space. All of them will have a different story to tell.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: John E. Carlstrom\n\nScientific projects: South Pole Telescope (SPT)\n\nCafe Scientifique: Evalyn Gates, \"Looking for Dark Matter through the Bottom of a Wine Glass\"\n\nOnline Materials (PDF)\n\nWhat is the Universe made of?\n\nNew data insist that normal matter - everything you were ever taught in chemistry class - makes up only about 5% of the total amount of matter and energy in the Universe. Dark Matter, an exotic new form of matter that has never been directly detected, accounts for about 23%, while the remaining 72% is not matter of any kind, but some strange new substance, dubbed Dark Energy, that is fueling an accelerated expansion of space itself. The search for dark matter and dark energy is complicated by the fact that they cannot be seen directly with even our most powerful telescopes. Instead, cosmologists are using the warps and dimples in space-time described by Einstein in his theory of General Relativity as giant \"cosmic lenses\". Gravitational lensing - also known as Einstein's Telescope - allows us to probe the dark Universe in an entirely new way: to search for black holes and planets within our own Galaxy, map out the dark matter that dominates a galaxy or cluster of galaxies, and detect the imprint of dark energy on the web of dark matter that winds across the cosmos.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Evalyn I. Gates\n\n70th Compton Lectures: Eric Switzer, \"The physics of energy devices\"\n\nRight now, nuclei are splitting, carbon atoms are rejoining oxygen atoms, generators are turning, transformers are stepping voltages up and down, oil pumpjacks are nodding, refiners are processing, and cars are whirring on numerous highways. Our modern life depends on a bewildering number and variety of transformations of energy. These all act together transparently to provide our everyday conveniences and essentials, and are easy to take for granted. The energy transformations employ many key ideas of physics that have been developed in the last century and a half. Indeed, the emergence of almost every major area of physics went hand-in-hand with the invention of practical devices that define our modern life. The lectures will break several of these technologies down to their essential phenomena, and put those phenomena in the context of the development of physics as a field. Eric Switzer will review some of the essential physics of energy technologies in an approximately chronological order, from outcomes of electrodynamics and thermodynamics to applications of more modern nuclear and condensed matter physics.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Eric Switzer\n\nCafe Scientifique: Kip Thorne, \"The Warped Side of the Universe\"\n\nOnline Materials (PDF)\n\nOur Universe has a \"warped side\": objects and phenomena that are made not from matter, but rather from warped space and warped time. Examples include black holes, and the big-bang singularity from which the Universe was born. Thorne will discuss this mysterious warped side, the quest to simulate it using supercomputers, and the quest to observe it using gravitational waves and strange telescopes.\n\nKip Thorne's website\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Randall H.

Hubble, an astronomer whose seminal contributions to the field greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe, also played forward on the Maroons' Big Ten champion basketball teams of 1907-08 and 1908-09.\n\nHubble's Story\n\nIn May of 2009, the Hubble Space Telescope's last service mission successfully upgraded and repaired the telescope to include new cameras and instruments. During the 12 day mission in orbit, the Hubble Servicing Mission 4 (STS-125) performed 5 spacewalks to complete the upgrades so that the telescope could begin a new journey of discovery. Join us for a discussion with Astronaut John Grunsfeld who will describe the adventures of working in orbit on the Hubble Space Telescope and the exciting scientific results that the new instruments provide.\n\nRead more >>\n\nRelated Links:\n\nKICP Members: Edward W.
