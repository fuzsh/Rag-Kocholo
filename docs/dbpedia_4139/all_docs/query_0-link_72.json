Overshadowed by its role in the Second World War, New Orleans during World War I is key to understanding the emergence of the modern city, and Altobello excels at bringing this story to light. ”\n\n– Richard Campanella, geographer, author, and professor at Tulane University School of Architecture\n\n“Brian Altobello’s historical insight is razor sharp. A fresh look at fascinating times in New Orleans—Storyville, Prohibition, and World War I. The book also takes a hard look at the impact of Jim Crow laws. His vivid depictions of such key players in New Orleans history as Mayor Martin Behrman in the 1910s make for an exciting read. ”\n\n– Peggy Scott Laborde, Emmy Award–winning producer of over thirty historical documentaries for WYES-TV, New Orleans’s public television station, and coauthor of five books on the city’s history\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nPrograms 2021\n\nHoward Margot, President\n\nSally Sinor, Program Chair\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n6:45pm CST – Member Virtual Happy Hour\n\n7:00 pm CST – Lecture\n\nDirector Bunn will discuss his book documenting the often-overlooked role of Great Britain’s West Florida colony in the American Revolution.\n\nThis event is limited to Louisiana Historical Society members only.

We regret it, but it’s just the way things are: we live in hurricane central, we all know that, and yet we choose to stay here, come what may. I feel blessed to live among such hardy and resolute folk. Our hearts go out to all of you who have suffered from this latest storm, some far more grievously than others. We pray that our historical peregrinations, if only in the form of virtual Zoom lectures, will provide you with some respite from this difficult facet of Louisiana history that you, personally, are living through and creating each and every day.\n\nPeace.\n\nHope.\n\nSee you October 12th,\n\nHoward Margot, president, LHS\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Members of the Louisiana Historical Society –\n\nHere we go again. As I was preparing to write this letter some weeks ago, Louisiana’s war against the pandemic first plateaued, then all too quickly started going south. (No pun intended.) I’ve waited until the last minute, hoping we might somehow be able to hold an in-person meeting and lecture at our usual location in September. But the current Delta-variant surge, along with the latest legal mandates for indoor gatherings in Orleans Parish, has made such a meeting of our members so impractical as to be impossible – and, as the Board concurs, we in any case feel it would be irresponsible of us to hold one under these conditions.\n\nSo, for at least the next two months, we’ll be staying with the virtual lecture format, covering a range of historical topics which should not fail to pique your interest. Please be on the lookout presently for the email announcement of our September 14th lecture – virtual or not, you won’t want to miss it.\n\nI’d like to end this message on an optimistic note: we are proceeding with preparations to hold our annual banquet on January 8th, and will of course keep you all updated on its status as the date nears.\n\nThank you, and be well –\n\nHoward Margot, president, LHS\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease join\n\nThe Louisiana Historical Society\n\nfor our May lecture and member happy hour\n\nDr. Mark Burford\n\nR.P.

Members will receive an email message with a Zoom link for the event.\n\nAuthor Fatima Shaik will read and discuss excerpts from her highly-regarded new book Economy Hall: The Hidden History of a Free Black Brotherhood. According to The New York Times, “’Economy Hall’ is so inviting that the true depth of its scholarship is revealed only in its bibliography, which lists dozens of archival and other sources.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nPlease join the\n\nLouisiana Historical Society\n\nfor the\n\nMarch Virtual Happy Hour and Lecture\n\n“Sugar, Slavery, and the Ecology of Fever in Antebellum New Orleans”\n\nDr. Urmi Engineer Willoughby\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nPitzer College\n\nTuesday, March 9, 2021\n\n6:30 pm CST – Member Virtual Happy Hour\n\n7:00 pm CST – Lecture\n\nThis event is limited to Louisiana Historical Society members only. Members will receive an email message with a Zoom link for the event.\n\nDr. Urmi Engineer Willoughby will discuss how yellow fever and malarial fevers increased in the countryside as planters and slaves settled in Louisiana and built sugar plantations, and how the growth of an endemic fever zone around the expanding city of New Orleans shaped local ideas about race, immunity, and ecology.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Louisiana Historical Society would like to draw your attention to the following virtual event commemorating the Battle of New Orleans:\n\nPrograms 2020\n\nThe Louisiana Historical Society\n\npresents\n\nThe Annual\n\nLouisiana Purchase Transfer Ceremony\n\nPlease join us via Zoom on Thursday, Dec 17, 2020, 07:00 PM Central Time (US and Canada) for our annual reading, with historical embellishments by Dr. Carolyn Kolb.

We hope that, if you are able, you will continue to support the LHS through this trying period for our organization, our state, our nation, and the world. We hope that you will understand and forgive the lull in our spring programming activities, and embrace the online lectures which we’ve been working hard to prepare for the fall: in September, we’ll follow the career of Ms. E.L. Saxon (Lyle’s grandmother) as a suffragist and humanitarian; in October, the director of the Hermitage will give us his take on interpreting Andrew Jackson’s life and legacy in the 21st century; and in November, we’ll delve into the story of 19th-century Charity Hospital’s indigent patients via forensic analysis of their skeletons.\n\nInstructions on how to sign up for the September 8 online lecture will be sent out to you soon. In the meantime, please be assured that the LHS remains committed to its mission, to encourage and promote the study of Louisiana’s rich history from a wide variety of research perspectives.\n\nHoward Margot\n\nPresident, Louisiana Historical Society\n\nMay Meeting Cancellation\n\nDear LHS Members,\n\nIt will come as absolutely no surprise to you that we are obliged to cancel our next meeting, as the date for which it had been scheduled, May 12th, falls within the limits of the City of New Orleans’s current stay-at-home order.\n\nAt the moment, we are making plans for the next regular meeting and lecture at its usual time in September. Meanwhile, we will be monitoring the situation and will, of course, keep you informed as to any further changes in our schedule.\n\nThank you for your continued support of the LHS during these trying times, and until we meet again, stay well and keep the faith — Coraggio!\n\nHoward Margot\n\nPresident, Louisiana Historical Society\n\nApril Meeting Cancellation\n\nDear LHS members,\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, the same caution currently being displayed by a majority of local, state, and national entities public, private, and ecclesiastical, we are canceling our next meeting and lecture which, under normal circumstances, would have been held on April 14th.\n\nWe hope to be able to resume normal activities and hold our final meeting before summer on Tuesday, May 12th, and will, of course, keep you informed. Thank you all for your continued support of the LHS, and please do whatever it takes to stay well.\n\nHoward Margot, President, Louisiana Historical Society\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nBiannual Business Meeting and Lecture\n\nTuesday, March 10, 2020\n\n7:00 PM 6330 St Charles Ave.\n\nA short business meeting will be held and members will be asked to vote on the new slate of officers.\n\nGuests are welcome for the lecture and reception.
