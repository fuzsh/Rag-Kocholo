He was one of the earliest of the Mennonite preachers in Skippack, now Montgomery county, Pa. He and his brothers, Martin and Jacob, were trustees of the venerable Mennonite church and its property on the Skippack, the oldest Mennonite church in America but one. Matthias Van Bebber conveyed one hundred acres to the organization on June 18, 1717, and upon that ground a building was erected for worship about the year 1725. Henry Kolb's name appears first on the list of elders and ministers in this congregation. His grandfather on the maternal side was Peter Schumacher, a member of the Mennonite church, who afterwards connected himself with the Society of Friends (Quakers). He came to Pennsylvania October 12, 1685, in the \"Francis and Dorothy,\" with his son Peter, his daughters, Mary, Frances and Gertrude, and his cousin Sarah, and remained at Germantown until the time of his death in 1707, aged eighty-five years. The mother of Henry died in 1705, and was buried at Wolfsheim, in the Palatinate (Pfalz). At the time of her death she was in the fifty-third year of her age. His father (Dillman) died eight years later, aged sixty-four. He was buried at Manheim, in the Palatinate (Pfalz). Henry, Martin, Jacob, Johannes and Dielman were all brothers. Henry, Martin and Dillman, in America,, and another brother, Peter, in Germany, were Mennonite ministers. Martin and Jacob married sisters, the daughters of Isaac Van Sintern. Of Martin's children, three married Rittenhouses. Isaac Van Sintern died August 23, 1737, and is buried at the old Skippack Mennonite meeting-house. The Kolbs were early and conspicuous in the ministry of the Mennonite church. They were devout followers of the teachings of Menno Simons, who was born at the village called Witmarsum, in Friesland, in the year 1492, and died in the year 1559, on the 13th of January.\n\nPeter Kolb, also a brother, was a Mennonite preacher at Griesheim, in the Palatinate, attending to this appointment until God called him in 1728. He was a very active assistant of Mennonite emigration to Pennsylvania.\n\nCHILDREN OF No. 6. HENRY KOLB of Dillman\n\n3 3539 1 Peter Kolb, b. about 1718 ; d. 1748 ; m.
