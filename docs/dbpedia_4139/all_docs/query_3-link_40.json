        "text": "Description\n\nAn exceptional mural, “History of Printing,” was painted by Edward Schoenberger for the Canal Street Branch Library in New Orleans. The library building was a pre-existing structure from the early 1900s, in a quirky Caribbean style of uncertain origins. The mural occupies the entire back wall of the main room on the second floor and is approximately 30 feet long by 10 feet high.\n\nThe branch library has been closed, probably after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the building sold to private owners. The mural was covered and damaged after the building was repurposed, but has been restored to its full glory (by whom is not clear). The building is currently (2018) functioning as a yoga studio, so it is not a public space. Nevertheless, the person in charge the day we visited was very welcoming and clearly proud of the mural.\n\nThe mural is shown in four photographs, along with one full view from across the large room in which it hangs."
