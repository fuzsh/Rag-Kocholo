        "text": "Besides secretarial work she helps on the family farm and has designed the house her parents are currently building. By Delmer Kolb\n\nJOHN FREDERICK KOLB\n\nJohn Frederick Kolb was born August 23, 1834 in Hohn., Schleswig-Holstein, Germany to Christian and Wiebke Kolb. His grandfather was Johann Mathies who married Maria Von Mundt, member of the royal family. Because she married a commoner, she lost her title.\n\nJohn, John Jr. and Caroline Kolb\n\nEarly in life, John helped his father in the shoemaker business but decided he wanted to see the world. He went to work as a sailor at Kiel, a large seaport on the Baltic Sea. Three years he sailed the North and Baltic Seas, working on a cargo ship. Later, he went to New York, working on American vessels traveling to many ports of the world, during which time he endured many hardships.\n\nAfter nine years, he settled in the United States, docking at New Orleans. He joined his family in Kankakee County, Illinois where his parents had immigrated in 1862, there helping his father farm. Later, he worked in the grocery business in Chicago. After several years, he travelled to Omaha, drawing a number and receiving a surveyor's plat indicating his homestead west of the Platte River, north of Saline Ford, now Ashland. No bridges across Salt Creek so that stream had to be forded.\n\nAccording to his plat, his homestead had to be straight west of Headland where he found a red cobble stone that marked the southwest corner of his homestead. He was elated to find a small spring of running water on his claim, which induced him to dig a dugout in a sidehill. Upon finding his homestead southwest of Yutan, he dug and lived in a dugout in a hillside for seven years.\n\nEarly years were fruitful, newly-broken sod produced abundantly, wheat, corn, rye and barley. He marketed them at Fremont, a forty-mile round trip, crossing the Platte by ferry boat. He also raised, butchered and dressed hogs to be marketed at Fremont. After a few good years, tragedy struck as a prairie fire swept over his place, consuming everything in its path.\n\nFuel was a problem. Dried buffalo chips and small bundles of prairie hay were used. The only wood available was found on the islands of the Platte, the wood was difficult to move to shore. This shortage induced him to plant many trees, including two fruit orchards.\n\nIn 1875, he built his first house, all lumber and materials had to be hauled from Ashland. The late seventies brought dry years and swarms of locusts devouring everything green, stripping young trees.\n\nIn 1882, he married Caroline Paulsen, nee Witte, widow of Hans Paulsen, settling in his new home with her small son, Henry Paulsen. This union was blessed with four children -- Wilhelmina, who married John Sagert -- Christian, who married Bertha Mumm -- John, who married Clara Karloff and William, remaining a bachelor. Henry Paulsen married Anna Nissen.\n\nThe early years found them attending the Reformed Church in Clear Creek, now Yutan. However, being Lutheran, he and other pioneers founded Zion Lutheran Church, later renamed St. John's where they remained active members.\n\nAfter thirty-five years of struggle and strife, good years and lean on the homestead, they retired and purchased a home in Yutan where they lived but a short time when Mrs. Kolb passed away. John remained there until 1913 when he moved to Omaha where he passed away the same year at age seventy-nine. Burial site for the Kolb family is Hollst Lawn Cemetery near Yutan, Nebraska.\n\nFamily members still residing in Saunders County, one son, William O. Kolb, 91 years of age, Wahoo; grandchildren, Oren and Delmer Kolb of Ashland, Edgar Kolb of Wahoo, Margie Swanson of Ceresco, Karl Sagert of Malmo. (Submitted by Edna Boury -- Margie Swanson)\n\nOREN AND RUTH KOLB\n\nOren J. Kolb was born August 13, 1910, son of Chris F. and Bertha (Mumm) Kolb. He was the oldest son in a family of nine children. He was born four miles southwest of Yutan, Nebr., was baptized and confirmed at St. John's Lutheran Church. His parents moved to a farm north of Memphis and he attended eight years of grade school at District 47.\n\nOren and Ruth Kolb\n\nOren helped his father farm and worked as a hired hand, husking corn for 2½¢ a bushel, picking up sugar beets near Scottsbluff, doing various jobs, and really going through some depression days. He was the proud owner of a Model-T coupe and, later, a 1928 4-cylinder Chevrolet Convertible with disc wheels, which was a luxury at that time. Being from a large family, a good time was had by all.\n\nHe farmed near Greenwood in the early thirties and moved to Ashland in 1936 and managed the Standard Oil Station. Oren was in the military service in the Tank Division, November, 1942 to October, 1945, with overseas duty and took part in Battle of the Bulge. After the service duty, he managed the farmers Union Oil Station in Wahoo, and later operated Ashland Transfer Company.\n\nOren married Ruth Martin, January 4, 1941, daughter of Charles and Florence (O'Kane) Martin. Ruth attended Lincoln School of Commerce, and was a bookkeeper at Darst Motors, was associated with Citizens National Bank six years, and, later, was employed by Farmers and Merchants National Bank approximately twenty-three years.\n\nThey are the parents of two daughters: Marilyn (Mrs. Roger Wright) of Millard, who graduated from Lincoln School of Commerce and Charlene (Mrs. James Comstock) of West Chester, Pennsylvania, who was a graduate of Nebraska Wesleyan. Both girls were graduates of Ashland High School. They have five grandchildren.\n\nOren and Ruth moved to a farm two miles southeast of Ashland in 1952 where they built a new house, and where they still reside. Oren had a farm combine accident in October, 1966, losing his right arm at the elbow. Oren retired and held a farm sale September 20, 1980. Ruth retired as Assistant Cashier at Farmers and Merchants National Bank, March 31, 1981. They are members of the American Legion Auxiliary, Ashland Post 192, and members of the Congregational Church of Ashland.\n\nWILLIAM O. KOLB\n\nWilliam Otto Kolb was born August 16, 1891 on the homestead of his father John F. Kolb, located four miles southwest of Yutan, Nebraska, formerly Clear Creek, Nebraska. His parents were Johann Friedrich and Caroline (Witte) Kolb.\n\nWilliam O. Kolb\n\nBill was always interested in other parts of the world; consequently, he traveled extensively. He has been to the west coast six times and spent one entire year in California. He traveled to Europe three times, visiting fourteen countries: Denmark, Germany, Austria, Holland, France, Portugal, England, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Scotland and Spain.\n\nAfter high school, he went to Omaha to Boyles Business College, then entered a small school to learn to be an optometrist. After he graduated and received his permit to practice optometry, he went to Blomfield, Nebraska where he got his first job in a jewelry store as a salesman and optometrist. He worked there from 1910 to end of 1911, when he went back to Omaha to work in a very high class jewelry store. There was no optical department, so he did not renew his license as optometrist. The name of the store was Scot-Parr Company, named after the two owners. The Scot-Parr Company sold out to Loftis Brothers Company, a large retail jewelry company that had stores in nine cities.\n\nHe joined the Army Signal Corps in 1918 during World War I. He is a permanent member of Ceresco Legion Post 244, and one of three remaining WW I Veterans of that Post. He served as Legion Commander in 1952.\n\nAfter the service, he lived in Santa Domingo for five years, operating three small stores in three towns with help of the natives. He returned to Nebraska in 1928. He farmed in the Yutan and Memphis area. He was also in the garage business in Yutan with Bill and Herman Mumm.\n\nBill started working for Ernie's IGA Grocery Store in Ceresco, April, 1946, where he purchased a home. He continued to work in the office of the home furnishings business for Ernie Swanson for twenty-five years until he retired in 1971 at eighty years of age.\n\nHe moved from Ceresco to Westview Apartments in Wahoo in December, 1979. Bill never did marry. He is now ninety-one years of age, still a bachelor and still cooking for himself. He is indeed a good cook, having had much experience. His hobbies have truly been traveling and studying nature. Having been a member of the Audubon Society, he enjoys the different species of birds. He grew many hybrid flowers, enjoyed gardening, was fascinated by rare trees and planted many fruit trees.\n\nHis only sister, Minnie Sagert, two brothers, Chris and John and half-brother, Henry Paulsen, are deceased. He has twelve living nieces and nephews. Brother Chris's family still living in Saunders County are Edgar Kolb of Wahoo, Oren and Delmer Kolb of Ashland, Margie Swanson of Ceresco, and sister Minnie's son, Karl Sagert, of Malmo.\n\nBill was baptized, confirmed and remained a lifelong member of St. John's Lutheran Church of Yutan, Nebraska, the church his father helped to organize. (Submitted by Margie Swanson)\n\npage 291\n\nFRED H. KOLTERMAN\n\nFred H. Kolterman, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Carl F. Kolterman of Blair, Nebr., arrived in Wahoo on Jan. 13, 1933. He came to Wahoo because his uncle, John C. Kolterman of Red Oak, Iowa, owner of the Ben Franklin store in Wahoo, had asked him to be the manager. In 1934, Fred contracted to purchase the store from his uncle.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 1933, Fred was married to Charlotte Shaffer, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Shaffer of Hooper, Nebr. Charlotte had just graduated from the Nebraska Methodist Hospital Nursing School in Omaha two weeks before their marriage.\n\nA son, Frederick Donald, was born on Aug. 24, 1934. Two years later on Aug. 10, 1936, John S. Kolterman was born. In 1938, twin sons, Ronald and Donald, joined the family on July 19th. All four sons were members of the Boy Scouts, and Fred Jr. and Donald became Eagle Scouts. Fred and Ronald served in the United States Marine Corps, and John and Donald served in the National Guard. The four sons married, resulting in 12 grandchildren. Five are natural grandchildren and seven are adopted.\n\nFred and Charlotte became members of the Bethlehem Lutheran Church in 1933. Fred sang in the church choir for many years and Charlotte sang part of the time. Fred served three terms on the church board. He was a member of the Wahoo Chamber of Commerce and the president of the Lions club, joining both organizations in 1934. In later years, Fred served on the board of the Public Schools for a period of 12 years, during which time the West Ward school was built, the North Ward building was enlarged and an addition was made on the High School. Fred is a member of the Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rite and the Shriners. Charlotte served as Worthy Matron of OES in 1951 and was president of Chapter I, PEO from 1958-1960.\n\nThe number \"13\" has figured prominently in the family. Fred Sr. was born on Dec. 13, 1909 in Scribner, Nebr. It was on the 13th of December that Fred and Charlotte had their first \"date\" while attending the University of Nebraska. On Jan. 13, 1933, Fred was appointed manager of the Ben Franklin Store. And they decided to get married on Friday, Oct. 13, but Charlotte's father was superstitious and asked the couple to set another date for the wedding, so they chose Oct. 12, one day earlier. One other \"13th\" occurred on June 13, 1929 when Fred left New York City an a ship bound for Denmark with the Dana College A Cappella Choir for a three-month tour of Denmark, Norway and Germany. Since 1975, Fred has been a member of the Saunders County Community Men's Chorus.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1974, Fred Sr. retired from the Ben Franklin Store after 41 years and sold the business to his son, Fred, who now operates the store. Submitted by Fred H. Kolterman\n\nTHOMAS JOHN KONECKY\n\nFrank and Frances Caha Konecky arrived in this county in 1874 from Moravia, Czechoslovakia and stayed with friends in the Prague area. They purchased a 180-acre farm, 3 miles west of Wahoo in 1877, and proceeded to raise 2 daughters and 6 sons. Not much other family history or stories are known of this period except that Frank Konecky's widowed mother came with him to this county and lived with his family in a five-room house! The Koneckys have always been Catholics and farmers.\n\nTom Konecky Family\n\nVincent, the 7th child, took over the family farm when he married a neighbor girl, Helen Zimola, daughter of John and Frances (Brukner) Zimola, on April 2, 1929. They included a few dairy cows in their farming operation.\n\nWhen their only child, Thomas John, born Mar. 23, 1936, took over the farm upon the death of his father, he established a Grade A Registered Guernsey Herd.\n\nTom and I were married in 1959. My parents, Wenceslaus and Marie (Oborny) Jira were of Schuyler. We have 10 children: Thomas V., Theresa, Catherine, Karen, James, Judy, Barbara, Elizabeth (Lolly), Christine, and Carol.\n\nTom Jr. farms rented land and is going into dairying with his dad. Theresa (\"T\") is attending UNL Agricultural College, and hopes to get an ag-related job.\n\nCathy is attending the College of St. Mary in Omaha, majoring in accounting and minoring in computer programming.\n\nOurs is about as \"family\" a farm as you can find. We hire no outside help. My \"extra\" job is to take cure of the baby calves, morning and evening. The older children at home take turns helping with the milking. The girls are in charge of training the calves to lead. The thing our family enjoys the best is showing our cattle. Being in 4-H is great training.\n\nBecause we all work together, we also have time to play together. Although our long vacations are few and far between, we try to have as many mini-vacations as we can. By Marie Konecky\n\nROLAND AND ADELYNE\n\nKORANDA\n\nI, Roland Koranda, was born on September 13, 1928 on a farm five miles southwest of Prague. My grandfather, Thomas Koranda, was born December 6, 1860, in Suchdol, Bohemia and came to the United States in 1879. He purchased this farm in 1886.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Roland Koranda, Carol and Janet\n\nMy father, Joseph Koranda, was the son of Thomas Koranda and Barbara (Kubik) Koranda. On November 11, 1919, he married Agnes Koza, daughter of James Koza and Frances (Capoun) Koza of Bruno.\n\nI served two years in the armed forces from April, 1951 to April, 1953. On September 9, 1953, I married Adelyne Sloup, daughter of James Sloup and Adela (Prochaska) Sloup.\n\nWe are the parents of two children. Carol was born on July 30, 1959. She graduated from Wahoo Neumann high school in 1977 and from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in secondary education. At the present time, she is attending graduate school at UNL, working toward a Master's Degree.\n\nJanet was born on October 3, 1960. She graduated from Neumann high school in 1978, from Lincoln School of Commerce in 1979, and from Southeast Community College in 1980. She is presently employed as a medical assistant at the Lincoln Clinic.\n\nWe are members of SS. Cyril and Methodius parish at Plasi which has been in existence for 105 years and is the first Catholic parish of Saunders County. (Submitted by Roland Koranda)\n\nKRALIK-ZIMOLA\n\nMy maternal grandparents, Thomas and Marie Zimola, their children, Antonia, Katherine and John, with four other families from Moravia came to Wahoo in August, 1874. They settled on a farm three miles west of Wahoo where two daughters, Anna (my mother) and Mary were born. Another daughter died in infancy and is buried under the cottonwoods near the farm site. The five families were Catholic and started St. Wenceslaus Church soon after their arrival. These families underwent many hardships, droughts, grasshoppers and fear of Indians. The language was a barrier but the children did attend a country school and learned to read and write. My grandparents retired to Wahoo and lived to a ripe old age.\n\nMy father's parents, Joseph and Frances Kralik, immigrated from Trebic, Moravia in 1883 with three sons, Frank, Anton (my father) and Joseph. Two daughters, Frances and Mary, were born on the farm near Colon where they bought land. My grandmother's parents came to this country with them and settled near Wahoo. My father, his brothers, and sisters attended school in District 65. My grandfather forded the Platte River with grain for the market and flour mill. They sometimes needed many teams of horses to pull the heavy loads across the river and up the steep bluffs. The children walked nine miles to attend catechism classes once a month at St. Wenceslaus Catholic church in Wahoo where they were church members. They also retired to Wahoo.\n\nMy parents, Anton Kralik and Anna (Zimola), were married in 1903 at St. Wenceslaus Church in Wahoo. They lived on a farm three miles north of Colon. This was their home until their retirement.\n\nThree daughters were born to them: Lucy, Anna (myself) and Mary. We all attended school in District #65 and St. Wenceslaus School in Wahoo. Lucy graduated from St. Wenceslaus and Mary and I graduated from Wahoo High School.\n\nMy parents encountered many hardships but there were the good times, also. For entertainment there was music. My father learned to play the violin, accordion, and, later in life, the musical saw. My mother was a good listener. We spent a great deal of time singing, especially after we acquired a piano and Lucy learned to play. We were all required to take piano lessons. Mother's favorite pastime was reading. I remember her many a time churning butter with one hand and holding a newspaper or magazine in the other.\n\nFeather stripping was a necessary winter pastime, much disliked by all of us girls. It became a little less distasteful when my parents bought a radio and we heard our favorite programs while pulling the white fluff from goose feathers. Harvest was a favorite time of year for youngsters. As families helped each other with meals, there were other children to play with. By Anna Bartek\n\nANNA BARTEK\n\nAfter graduation from High School I took a Beauty Course and worked in Wahoo until my marriage. Bernard (Barney) Bartek, son of Luke and Victoria Bartek, and I were married in 1937. We made our home in Wahoo where my husband was in business. He started in the Standard Oil Station downtown, then bought Mobil Oil Station on Highway 30. Later, he bought a liquor store.\n\nOur daughter, Mary, was born in 1947. We did a lot of fishing and camping as a family. As a couple we danced a lot. My husband was quite a gardener and together we raised a lot of vegetables. We also had a fruit orchard and enjoyed our canned and fresh fruit all year. Barney belonged to the Knights of Columbus and I, to our church choir.\n\npage 292\n\nOur daughter married John Mahrt in 1967. They live on a farm south of Fremont and have three sons: Jared, Joel and Jeffrey. My husband passed away suddenly in 1974.\n\nBesides enjoying my grandsons, I am still a choir member, belong to several church organizations, the Czech singers, and enjoy concerts and the theater. The latter is something I learned to appreciate as a girl when my parents took in many live shows in Fremont when the North Players made their tours. My sister, Mary Sudik, and I have taken many trips to see her son, James Sudik, in plays from Colorado to New York to Chicago, Illinois. We've also taken numerous trips to other parts of the country. I make quilts, oil paint, and make rugs as a pastime.

By Jacqueline Bryant\n\nFRANK KREMLACEK SR.\n\nFrank Kremlacek was born in 1800 to George (Jiri) and Rosalie Zimola Kremlacek in Kouty, Moravia. Records received from the State Archives of Brno, Czechoslovakia indicate the Kremlacek, Zimola, Simonides and Pestal families must have lived in the Kouty, Moravia area for several generations; maybe as far back as 1600.\n\nFrank's father, Jiri Kremlacek, who was a free farmer from Kouty, was born in 1748 at Kouty, Moravia. Jiri's mother was born in 1717 and his father was born in 1713 at Kouty. Frank's mother was Rosalie Zimola who was born in 1754 at Kouty, Moravia. Rosalie's mother was born in 1713 at Radosov (near Kouty), and her father in 1711 at Kouty, Moravia. Both Frank's grandfathers and grandmothers lived to be over 70 years of age but all four died before Frank was born in 1800. Frank's dad died when he was only 2 years old. His mother, Rosalie Zimola Kremlacek, died when Frank was 16 years of age.\n\nFrank married Paulina Dohnal in 1824 and she died in September of 1849 at age 49 at Kouty. There were no children born to this marriage. In November, 1849, Frank married Marie Simonides. Marie Simonides Kremlacek's father, Frank Simonides, was born in 1794 at Kouty. Frank's mother was born in 1769 at Kouty and his father was born in 1762 at Kouty. Marie's mother, Frances Pestal Hejamlicek, was born in 1781 at Radosov (near Kouty.) Frances' mother was born in 1761 at Vrzanov and her father in 1749 at Radosov. Both towns are located within walking distance of Kouty. Marie Simonides Kremlacek's father, Frank Simonides, moved to Radosov and farmed until he died in 1832. Records from the State Archives of Brno mention he was a ½-lanik farmer from Radosov. Frank's nickname in Czechoslovakia was Sedl.\n\nFrank and Marie Kremlacek had 4 children which were all born on a farm at Kouty, Moravia before they came to the United States: a. Josef Kremlacek b. and d. 1855; b. Frank Kremlacek Jr. b. June, 1857; c. Josef Kremlacek b. August, 1859;\n\npage 293"
