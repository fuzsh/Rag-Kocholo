        "text": "Our Lady of the Flood by Alison Pelegrin\n\nReview by Diane Elayne Dees\n\nThe entire region around New Orleans embodies a certain sensibility, born of geography and weather and a unique heritage that is hard to define and even harder to translate. When I first moved to the city decades ago, I was both curious about and amused by the many “Our Lady” names of schools and churches. “Can you imagine what their fight song is?” an acquaintance once asked when we drove past Our Lady of Prompt Succor School.\n\nAfter you’ve lived here a long time, though, Our Lady of Prompt Succor, Our Lady of Good Counsel, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and Our Lady Star of the Sea (which we called “the tuna fish church”) all become part of the sometimes bizarre linguistic landscape of the city.\n\nI’ve also lived through many Louisiana hurricanes and floods, so I approached reading Alison Pelegrin’s Our Lady of the Flood with relish, and I was not disappointed. In this collection, Pelegrin skillfully cuts through the difficulty of cultural translation with a collection of poems that puts the region’s eccentricity in the colorful and sometimes absurd context that it deserves. Moreover, she does it—often with delicious humor—by using language that gives new life to the tasks and customs that are part of daily life in and around New Orleans.\n\nThe collection opens with the eponymous poem, “Our Lady of the Flood”:\n\nSome saints are untouchable behind glass,\n\nbut you ride in open boats\n\nwith mildew on the edges of your gown,\n\na calm commander of the Cajun Navy’s fleet.\n\nYour devotees worship outside\n\nin a circle of ruined pews,\n\nno incense but bug spray\n\nThis is a perfect introduction to the parade of “Our Lady” poems that are to come, as well as the other poems in Our Lady of the Flood, which include an ode to ambrosia (“confection snubbed by food snobs as a [. . .] meringue of shame”), a meditation on local bridges, and a commentary on the removal of New Orleans’ Lee Circle statue of General Robert E. Lee.\n\nHurricane Katrina, as one might expect, is an ongoing theme in Pelegrin’s collection. In “Anything We Want,” she expresses the longing of all Louisianans who were displaced by the 2005 storm:\n\nThey won’t quit asking, What do you want?\n\nI want to be somewhere besides Mississippi\n\nwith its highway that splits fields\n\nof cotton and soy and blackbirds.\n\nI want art supplies and to read a book\n\nin my old bed, to ride the streetcar by myself\n\n//\n\nI want my mom to say something\n\nin the Walmart, where we have gone to spend\n\na gift card from some church\n\non anything we want.\n\nAnd in “Quicksilver”:\n\n[…] quicksilver visions wrinkle\n\nand then they vanish. But\n\nthis water is absolute. It remains,\n\nthough the hurricane is over.\n\nI have studied from my exile\n\nin this hotel room, witnessed\n\nrooftop rescue, the folly\n\nof mammoth sandbags. This water\n\nis no silvered mirage. It clings like tar.\n\nIt swallows everything we are.\n\nThe “Our Lady” poems are a special treat. “Our Lady on the Half Shell” celebrates “Bathtub Madonna, Lily of so many gardens, Queen of Heaven in a scalloped shell [. . .]”:\n\nWhite-washed, with marble chips, or pansies, at your feet,\n\nyou have many faces in New Orleans—so many incarnations—\n\nalabaster, hand-painted Creole or coffee or midnight skin,\n\nyour ghost eyes peering out and you motionless\n\nAnd then there’s “Our Lady of ‘No Regerts’ ”:\n\nOur Lady of No Regerts, prevention of bad tattoos\n\nmust be your side hustle, a part-time ministry,\n\nbecause, queen of inky heaven, with respect,\n\na few too many permanent atrocities\n\nhave escaped your intervention\n\nMy personal favorite is “Our Lady of Whatever,” in which the poet fantasizes about being one of the many Ladies revered in New Orleans.\n\nSo many lakes. So many Ladies of the Lakes.\n\nMaybe I could be Lake Pontchartrain’s Lady\n\nof the Longest Bridge, Lady of Cicada Tea Parties,\n\nof Lighthearted Marvels, of Sand Mandalas,\n\nReduced to Cerulean Ash. Our Lady of Shrinky Dinks.\n\nA special gem in this collection is Pelegrin’s “Soliloquy against a Kudzu Backdrop”:\n\nAudience of none, superstition dictates\n\nthat I peek through the kudzu curtain\n\nlike a starlet before making an entrance\n\nand speaking yet again on the theme\n\nof ignorance observed in waking life.\n\nI would like to believe these are actors I see—\n\nrednecks so loud in their stupidity\n\nthat rather than being frightened by their antics\n\nI find myself waiting for the punchline\n\n//\n\nHow can we be\n\nso different when the same trees\n\nrustle in all of our dreams?\n\nIt isn’t easy to move readers beyond the clichéd images of jazz bands, wrought iron balconies and roaming alligators, to the sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious, and always evocative images that represent what life is really like in New Orleans and its outlying regions. But in Our Lady of the Flood, Alison Pelegrin provides a charmingly authentic portrait of a culture that is like no other in the nation.\n\nAlison Pelegrin’s latest collection, Our Lady of Bewilderment, is forthcoming from LSU Press in 2022. Other books include Waterlines (LSU 2016), as well as Hurricane Party (2011), and Big Muddy River of Stars (2007), both with the University of Akron Press. Pelegrin is the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Louisiana Division of the Arts, and the Louisiana Board of Regents. She is Writer-in-Residence at Southeastern Louisiana University.\n\nTitle: Our Lady of the Flood\n\nAuthor: Alison Pelegrin\n\nDiode Editions\n\nISBN: 978-1-939728-16-6\n\n28 pages, $12.00\n\nDiane Elayne Dees is the author of the chapbook, Coronary Truth (Kelsay Books) and two forthcoming chapbooks, I Can’t Recall Exactly When I Died, and The Last Time I Saw You.
