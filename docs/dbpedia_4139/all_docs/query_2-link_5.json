        "text": "VOLUME LXXII-NO. 100.\n\nCORBETT IS CHAMPION\n\nSullivan Defeated in Twenty-\n\nOne* Rounds.\n\nCLEVERNESS OF THE CIUMtBUL\n\nThe Bo&tonian Badly Punished From\n\nthe Outset\n\nSUILITA- _ FAMOUS RUSHES of so AVAIL\n\nC.rbctt Successfully Withstands Tunish.\n\nsent and Finally Fights Sullivan\n\nto the Floor.\n\nSpecial to The Morning Cal_\n\nNew Orleans. Sept 7.— The laurel has\n\nshifted. John L. Sullivan has had some\n\nnew sensations, so has James Corbett. One\n\nhas been knocked off the pedestal of pugil\n\nistic championship and the other has\n\nclimbed into bis place. The California\n\nheavyweight, Corbett, has knocked out the\n\nchampion, John L. Sullivan, and has won\n\nbesides some $45,000.\n\n. It now appears to the spectators, if tbe\n\ntruth is told, that Corbett won easily. The\n\nimpress tou left by the rapid spectacle is\n\nthat Sullivan was at no moment in the path\n\nof success, and the physical evidences of\n\nthis, as apparent at the finish, what were\n\nthey? Corbett, the winner, at tb,e moment\n\nof his victory, was keen, quick, alert in\n\nevery round, unmarked by bruise or blood.\n\nHis face was aglow with steady interest\n\n-and It wore a half-smile, and he was ready\n\nto attack his foe with ferocious force bad\n\nthat foe been able to rise. These were the\n\nconditions of victory.\n\nSullivan was reeking with blood, smashed,\n\nbruised, jellied nearly, if not quite entirely\n\nso. These were the evidences of defeat,\n\nand it was when these had been established\n\nthat the laurels shifted and a new man has\n\nbeen born into championship.\n\nWhy was Sullivan dethroned? He him\n\nself had contributed to the causes of his\n\nown downfall. Had his life had no excesses\n\nSullivan would have been able to fight the\n\nbattle more effectively to retain his prestige.\n\nBe is not relatively so good a man at 34 as\n\nhundreds of other men at that age. His\n\nface is furrowed, not alone by years, but\n\nby the methods of his own living.\n\nHis ponderous body, too, bore traces not\n\nalone of time, but of easy living. His con\n\ndition was not comparable with that of his\n\nvictorious foe. It could not be. There was\n\nthe accumulation of age and the wide free\n\ndom which could not be trained away with\n\nout Impairing the man.\n\nSullivan, too, ha« been overconfident.\n\nHe bad been contemptuous of the needful\n\nmeasures for his perfect condition. He was\n\nSullivan, and Sullivan could not loose in\n\nbattle.\n\nCorbett has taught him otherwise, and\n\nhow, starting with eight years less of life's\n\ninevitable wear, he had conserved his\n\npowers, perfected the methods of their use,\n\ncharging his heart meanwhile, confident\n\nthat be would become king of bis kind. His\n\nwas the capital of brawn and muscle upon\n\nwhich to build up the fortune of victory and\n\nreputation.\n\nIt may not be carelessly said that Corbett\n\nat 26 years of age is a better man than Sal\n\nlivan was at that age, but assuming they\n\nwere equally good men st equal ages, the\n\nanalysis of this victory comes back to the\n\nfact that while some men of 34 may whip\n\nsome men of X, the elder man being the\n\nvictor must not have added to his own\n\nmethods of depletion to those which the\n\nsilent years so surely employ.\n\nSullivan came forward to-night into the\n\nglare of twenty electric lights, his senses\n\nfed by the shouts of those who will flaunt\n\nhim now. The majority believed in him.\n\nWhy should not the champion believe in\n\nhimself? So, while they yelled with wor\n\nshiping plaudit, he sat down in his corner\n\nand with easy interest scanned the powerful\n\nfellow opposite.\n\nSomehow there Is homage in the eager at\n\ntention the trainers bestow upon their\n\nenamplon, snd to-night while Sullivan en\n\njoyed this hi« heavy form sagged down as he\n\nsat waiting the Dreliminuries. Those who\n\nscanned him closely saw welts of flesh on\n\nbis abdomen rolling far over the edge of his\n\nfirmly drawn belt. It should not have been\n\ntbe obesity of age, for the man to-nlgbt\n\nshould be in the ptime of his years. Was\n\nit distension surely following wise suppers\n\nand hot dinners of rich foods? Who shall\n\nBSV?\n\nWhile sitting thus under the eyes of hun\n\ndreds whose scrutiny was sharpened by\n\ntheir money on the result, Sullivan was in\n\nturn studying his foe. And what did he\n\nsee? In the opposite corner, out of which\n\nall the victors in the Olympic Club have\n\ngone to victory, there sat a splendid speci\n\nmen of human flesh and bone. Sullivan\n\n•aw a smiling and confident face. He\n\n•aw a neck • that had poise and\n\nstrength. He saw a chest deep enough\n\nto bold a bellows. He saw a pair of\n\nbrowned shoulders where piled muscles\n\ncrept and glided beneath the skin. Hebe\n\nheld outstretched upon the ropes while the\n\ntrainers did their service a pair of arms as\n\nlong as those of a windmill, bunched with\n\nlithe, driving muscles, with the blood and\n\nnerve of youth. _\n\nThe champion beheld a foe whose ab\n\ndominal curve was clean-cut, roundlike In\n\nits lines. There was no adipose tissue to\n\nclog his lungs or to burden the freedom of\n\nbis action. Like a racer was Corbett—\n\ntrim, solid, balanced physically at every\n\npoint, unless, indeed, his long legs seemed\n\na trifle light for bis muscular shoulders and\n\nbody. But those who doubted the power of\n\nbis lithe under limbs could not know how\n\nlike steel they had been tempered to bend\n\nwithout breaking under stress and tension.\n\nDoubters learned later what iron thews lay\n\nalong these slender columns that should\n\nuphold the man.\n\nBE I- ORE THE FIGHT.\n\nThe Olympic Club Crowded With Eager\n\nThrongs of Spectators.\n\nOlympic Club, New Orleans, Sept.\n\n7.— The excitement that has prevailed in\n\nthis city has bad no parallel since the Italian\n\nassassination eighteen months ago. There\n\nhas been no subject of conversation dis\n\ncussed in any quarter save the event of this\n\nevening, in which every portion of the civ\n\nilized world Is more or less deeply inter\n\nested. It has apparently affected the outside\n\nworld as deeply as It did the participants in\n\nthe battle. Both men were known to be in\n\nprime condition, and the greatest fight of\n\nthe series was looked forward to by all with\n\nkeen anticipation.\n\nThere was a universal move In the direc\n\ntion of the club even before evening began\n\nto fall. Business men, lawyers and journal\n\nists took their dinners downtown and had\n\nvehicles ordered early. They were willing\n\nto wait at the club, but they were unwilling\n\nto waste time going down.\n\nAt 6 o'clock carriages were already head\n\ning down Canal street, which was crowded\n\nwith people and vehicles. Down the Inter\n\nsecting streets were a line of carriages\n\nreaching to the scene of the battle. Down\n\nIn tbe neighborhood of the club for blocks\n\nand blocks carriages were strung along the\n\ncurbstones, and every street corner bad a\n\ncrowd. * J _. :.\n\nThe Sullivan people came to the club\n\nfirst. They took a carriage at the hotel be\n\nfore 7 o'clock and drove leisurely down with\n\ntbe string of backs. Sullivan looked strong\n\nand determined. He walked with a jaunty\n\nair and came in so easy with the line of\n\npeople entering at the time that only a few\n\nnoticed him.\n\nBoth contestants were in the building at\n\n8 o'clock, but they were kept in strict seclu\n\nsion. As the crowd recognized the well\n\nknown pugilists and sporting men they\n\nwere cheered. The poolrooms closed with\n\nbetting Ito 3 against Corbett. Atß:o7 there\n\nwere fully 9000 people in the arena. Sulli\n\nvan's weight was 212 pounds, Corbett's 189.\n\nBoth men were in fine fettle.\n\nIn the toss for corners Corbett won and\n\nchose the lucky one that Dixon and Mc-\n\nAuiiffe fought in. >.\n\nBig Jim Corbett followed In the wake of\n\nthe champion, coming li*. fifteen minutes\n\nlater. When bis party pulugd up in front of\n\nThe Morning Call.\n\nthe door the street was cleared and an ave\n\nnue was opened into the building. Corbett\n\ncame in first, with a light step, and his face\n\nwreathed in smiles.\n\nThe first sign of the contest for the cham\n\npionship of America came in the person of\n\nPolice Captain Barrett, who went into the\n\nring at five minutes to 9 o'clock. The scales\n\non which the cloves were weighed were laid\n\nbeside the center of the post.\n\nEx-Mayor Guillot. who acted as master of\n\nceremonies, entered the arena a few min\n\nutes later and made a speech, warning the\n\nspectators to he careful not to violate any\n\nrule of the club.\n\nSullivan entered the ring first, dressed In\n\nfreen trunks and black slices and socks,\n\nle looked in perfect condition. Corbett\n\nfollowed a moment later, looking pale and\n\nfinely drawn beside his bulky antagonist.\n\nHe wore an at of- confidence, however,\n\nand smiled and nodded to his acquaintances\n\naround the ring, though he was said by\n\nsome people to be a little nervous.\n\nPolice Captain Barrett stepped to the\n\ncenter of the ring and presented Professor\n\nJohn Duffy with a beautiful silver ice\n\nbowl and ladle.\n\nJohn Donaldson and Billy Pelaney were\n\nannounced as Corbett's seconds, with Bat\n\nMasterson as timekeeper. Charley John\n\nson anil Jack McAuiiffe were the seconds\n\nfor John L. Sullivan and Frank Moran was\n\ntimekeeper. The gloves were weighed and\n\nfound to be secording to law and they were\n\ngiven to the fighters. In tile parley which\n\nwas held in the center of the ring Corbett\n\nlooked entirely outclassed in point of build,\n\nthough his friends relied upon his clever\n\nness to win the battle. The pivot blow and\n\nback-heeling were barred by mutual con\n\nsent, and the men agreeing to fight fair,\n\nthey were sent to their corners to get ready\n\nfor thetray.\n\nTHE 810 BATTLE.\n\nSullivan Takes the Aggressive and Cor\n\nbett Become! Cautious.\n\nFirst round— The battle commenced at\n\n9:10o'cloo\"_ Both men stepped lightly to\n\nthe center of the ring. Sullivan imme\n\ndiately became the aggressor.

Sullivan tried to\n\ncorner Jim, but the latter slipped away.\n\nT he gong sounded and not a blow had been\n\nlanded by either.\n\nSecond round— Sullivan was still tbe ag\n\ngressor. He uppercut Jim and touched\n\nhim again with his left a little later. Jim\n\neyed his man closely, and when Sullivan\n\nwould rash the Californian would slip\n\naway.

Sullivan \"was very bloody\n\nand both men were fighting like demon*.\n\nCorbett had Sullivan on the ropes and was\n\npounding him unmercifully as the gong\n\nsounded.\n\nCORBETI'S STOCK RISING.\n\nThe Fast and Farloat Fighting Tells on\n\nSalll-an.\n\nSixth round— Both men landed light lefts\n\nsnd Sullivan's nose was bleeding again.'\n\nTbe champion was beginning to look tirod,\n\nfor he Hissed his right aimed for the jaw.\n\nCorbett took plenty of time and used the\n\nentire ring to maneuver in. He landed a\n\nlight stomach punch and hit the champion\n\nin the face. A little later there was a heavy\n\nexchange of lefts on the head.

He tipped the\n\nscale at 174 pounds, showing that he had\n\nonly lost five pounds during the fight. In\n\nanswers to questions, Corbett said: \"I knew\n\nwhat I could do. I bad been practicing for\n\nweeks to guard against bis particular style\n\nof fighting, and felt just as confident of\n\nwinning as I did that I was alive.\"\n\nBob Fitzsimmons knocked at the door and\n\nwanted to see Corbett. \"Don't let him in,\"\n\nsaid the new champion. \"I don't want to\n\nsee him.
