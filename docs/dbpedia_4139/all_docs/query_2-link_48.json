        "text": "The following are prefaces to most of the Oral History interviews in the collection of the Oberlin Heritage Center. Series I consists of two groups of interviews acquired by the Oberlin Heritage Center: 1) interviews conducted in 1979 for the Youth Services, Inc. Oral History Project and 2) interviews conducted from 1982 to 1988 for a project of the City of Oberlin Historic Preservation Commission. Series II consists of interviews conducted by the Oral History Committee of the Oberlin Heritage Center.\n\nThe Oberlin Heritage Center is the owner and repository of the tapes, digital recordings and transcripts of the oral history interviews, which are available to the public by appointment/inquiry. This oral history is a transcript of the spoken word, and the informal style engendered by that format has been retained. The Oberlin Heritage Center is not responsible for the factual accuracy of the memoir, nor for the views expressed therein.\n\nThe transcript may be read, quoted, and cited. However, use of material in this transcript must be cited as “Oral History Interview with [Name] by [Name], [Date of Interview]. Oberlin Oral History Project, held by the Oberlin Heritage Center, Oberlin, Ohio.” It may not be reproduced in whole or in part by any means, electronic or mechanical, without written permission of the Oberlin Heritage Center, P.O.

In March of 2020, she called an emergency meeting with key senior leaders of the college where they decided to shut down the campus due to the spreading concerns about COVID-19. Describing the decision as a defining moment in her career, Ambar discusses her responses to the pandemic and many of the decisions she has had to make for the college following the shutdown.\n\nAfter the shutdown in the spring of 2020, classes moved to completely virtual. In the fall of 2020, Ambar made the decision to bring students back to campus despite many critics. She mentions that this decision was made with what she believed to be Oberlin’s core mission in mind. Her strategy to prevent an outbreak included de-densifying, giving each student their own room, making all food grab-and-go, moving all classes to hybrid or distanced format, creating a community agreement, testing 25% of students weekly, and implementing a quarantine and testing strategy for when students arrived on campus. Ambar mentions how each decision she made had to prioritize the health and wellness of students, staff, and faculty.\n\nAmbar notes that Oberlin’s community of collective care also allowed them to prevent a huge outbreak. She mentions that the requirement to mask inside and outside helps to serve as a reminder that everyone is committed to creating a safe environment for all. Additionally, she says that despite many difficulties, the pandemic allowed the college to practice collaboration with the community, and it also led to greater and more efficient uses of technology. She discusses the benefits of the three-semester system as well, particularly for small business owners in the town, and mentions her feeling of presence, knowing that her actions will be judged by history.\n\nAmbar also discusses the challenges associated with balancing triplets and work simultaneously, but she notes her gratitude for her financial stability and other privileges that many other parents didn't have. She also credits her church and public health officials for helping her deal with difficult choices. She emphasizes her belief that Oberlin can come out of the pandemic stronger than they went in, emphasizing that she hopes people will take the lessons learned and remember the ways they found to connect with one another during these times. Oral History Series II, Oberlin Heritage Center.\n\nCynthia Andrews\n\nAn interview of Cindy Andrews conducted via Zoom by Laurel Price Jones on 12 June 12 2020 in a special COVID-19 interview series to record the impact of the coronavirus on the community, for the Oberlin Oral History Project.\n\nCindy Andrews is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Community Foundation of Lorain County, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2020. Cindy describes how the Foundation continued to fulfill its mission of “connecting people who care to causes that matter” when the COVID pandemic increased critical needs in the community. She also describes changes in how the board and staff worked to ensure a safe environment.\n\nJust days after Ohio Governor DeWine announced closures and safety protocols throughout the state, the Foundation’s board met virtually on Zoom and, through a very generous donor, were able to advance a $250,000 grant to Second Harvest, supporting 92 food pantries in Lorain County. With donations from other major funding organizations and individuals, they created an emergency response fund and formed an advisory committee which included a community member named by each of the major funders to allocate funds. Because 25% of Lorain County residents are not connected to the internet and students were struggling to connect to classes via Zoom, some of the grant money went to digital inclusion.\n\nCindy also describes changes to the Foundation’s internal workings, including masking and daily staff sign-ins to detect any COVID symptoms. The Foundation also divided their staff of 10 individuals into two teams, one working Monday through Wednesday and the other working Tuesday through Thursday. Employees with compromised immune systems or vulnerable people at home were able to work from home, and many meetings took place on Zoom.

Oral History Series I, Oberlin Heritage Center\n\nLeo Braido\n\nAn interview of Leo Braido conducted via Zoom by Laurel Price Jones on 10 June 2020, in a special COVID-19 interview series to record the impact of the coronavirus on the community, for the Oberlin Oral History Project.\n\nLeo Braido purchased the Oberlin IGA grocery store in September 2014 and managed it until January of 2022, when he sold the business. He is a lifelong grocer, having started as a bagger at a grocery store in southeast Ohio in 1983 and leaving in 2012 as general manager of a 15-store group. Seeking to own and manage his own store, he came to Oberlin IGA in 2014 “to make a living and to make a difference.” He is proud of his store and his employees and the way the store has continued to serve its customers well, notwithstanding the challenges of the COVID pandemic.\n\nThose challenges included keeping the store well stocked in the face of supply chain shortages and panic buying early in the pandemic. Leo’s 37 years of experience in the industry and the ability of a small store to make decisions and change course quickly have enabled the Oberlin IGA to outperform large chains in some ways. For example, anticipating a meat shortage early in the pandemic, Leo rented a refrigerated truck and brought four tons of meat a week before many large chains found themselves unable to provide meat to their customers.\n\nA major problem during the pandemic has been the shortage of staff. Some employees quit out of fear that they would get COVID and/or bring it home to their children or older, compromised adults in the home. Others may have found government assistance provided during the pandemic an incentive to stay home. Sales, on the other hand, have risen as many restaurants closed and more people prepare meals at home. At the time of the interview, the store was operating with only 60% to 70% of required staff, but Leo and the remaining staff made it work. He works 80-90 hours a week, including cutting all the meat because the meat cutter had quit.\n\nLeo believes the grocery industry in general is serving its customers well during this difficult period and that customers recognize the invaluable service that grocery stores provide. In fact, the appreciation of customers and their kind words and actions are the things that keep him going.

Oral History Series I, Oberlin Heritage Center\n\nChris Frank\n\nAn interview with Chris Frank, principal of Oberlin High School, conducted via Zoom by Gail Wood on 22 June 2020, in a special COVID-19 Interview Series to record the impact of the coronavirus on the community, for the Oberlin Oral History Project.\n\nChris Frank and his wife, Monica, moved to Oberlin in 2003 and raised two children in the community (both teenagers at the time of the interview). Frank worked in education throughout all those years, for the Oberlin City Schools, at Lorain County JVS, and EHOVE (Erie Huron Ottawa Vocational Education). He held numerous teaching jobs and more recently served in administrative positions with the Oberlin Schools at the elementary, junior high, and currently the high school level.\n\nThe COVID shutdown dramatically changed Chris’s daily focus from one of interacting with students to utilizing technology and helping students and staff adapt to new methods of teaching and learning. Not all teachers had the same expertise in using technology to reach out to students, not all academic subjects transferred well from in-person to remote learning, and not all students had equal access to the internet, computers, printers and the like. Nor did all students have equal support from family in their home learning environments. Chris gives many examples of how his high school staff, with support from the school district and the greater Oberlin community, worked hard together to minimize the disparities. Despite the difficulties of “pivoting” midyear to an entirely new way of educating students, Chris found many positives emerging from the experience. He cites the 2020 Oberlin High School graduation ceremonies as an example of Oberlin’s community spirit that was seen throughout the school district during this unprecedented time.

She discusses how it has also revealed the levels of society where people can choose not to care about the suffering of others, while for her, the pandemic in conjunction with the light shed on the murders has been a source of grief and anger.\n\nGadsby was impressed by the Oberlin community for supporting one another through the pandemic. She notes that she was pleased by the college’s response to the pandemic, even under difficult circumstances.

Oral History Series I, Oberlin Heritage Center\n\nJanet Haar\n\nAn interview with Janet Haar, Executive Director of the Oberlin Business Partnership, conducted via Zoom by Laurel Price Jones on 18 June 2020, in a special COVID-19 Interview Series to record the impact of the coronavirus on the community, for the Oberlin Oral History Project.\n\nJanet Haar became the Executive Director for the Oberlin Business Partnership in June 2012. At that time, the organization was called Main Street-Chamber, reflecting the nonprofit’s hybrid nature of being both a Main Street affiliate and a Chamber of Commerce. The name change occurred a few months later as part of the organization’s strategic plan, indicating the importance OBP placed on partnering with its members and volunteers to accomplish its goals. Presently, Oberlin Business Partnership focuses on the preservation and sustainability of downtown Oberlin.\n\nHaar talks about how OBP has adapted during the pandemic, specifically by moving from a promotion-and-marketing perspective focused on community events that draw people downtown to a retention-perspective focused on finding ways to help downtown businesses sustain themselves during this unprecedented era. Innovative projects at this time include “comeback kits” (containing hand sanitizers, gloves, masks, paper towels, disinfectant and signage) to help defray costs associated with businesses re-opening. Another example, designed to help local restaurants accommodate patrons who wish to dine outdoors, focused on working with the city to move picnic tables from local parks to downtown green spaces to be in close proximity to various restaurants.\n\nHaar also talks about the impact of the College’s schedule on the local economy. Covid-related changes to the academic calendar will bring fewer students back to campus each semester, but will spread out the student population all-year-round for the 2020-2021 school year. There are positive implications for the downtown community with this pandemic-related change. On the other hand, there are negative implications for OBP with the temporary closure of the Hotel at Oberlin (which currently is being used to quarantine students with COVID-19). Without the bed tax income that is typically generated by overnight stays of paying customers at the Hotel, there will be significantly less money for OBP to work with in the future.\n\nHaar speaks about other ways the pandemic has changed the logistics of her work (working from home, meeting with others via Zoom, etc.). The greatest challenge is finding ways to help the downtown community, and realizing that there really is very little you can do to bring people into local businesses under these challenging circumstances. Her biggest worry is that some businesses will not make it through the pandemic and that with the great stresses of the pandemic, OBP won’t be able to put together the expertise and ideas from their partners to help move the community forward.\n\nShe notes that Oberlin historically has been a community that solves problems by working together. She offers some examples of how that is being done now in the community and how there is a tangible feeling of pride among Oberlinians for the way everyone has pulled together. She cites that some people are making masks to help others and that the local Rotary club is involved in a project to support all the restaurants in Oberlin. She appreciates the Oberlin Heritage Center’s documentation of the impact and response to the pandemic so that future generations may understand and learn from it.

Oral History Series II, Oberlin Heritage Center\n\nAnnetta Oliver Horton\n\nAn interview with Annetta Oliver Horton, an African-American woman, conducted via telephone by Carol Lasser, in two parts on 16 April 2020 and 23 April 2020, for the “Harvesting School Stories” project, part of the Oberlin Oral History Project. Part One of the interview focuses primarily on Horton’s relationship with the Oberlin Schools, both as a student and as a teacher. Part Two focuses more on her parents and others who influenced Horton as a youth and as she grew into adulthood.\n\nAnnetta Westerfield Lindsey Oliver Horton was born 7 April 1951. Her earliest years were spent in foster care in Mansfield, Ohio. At age 5 she was adopted as the only child of Roosevelt and Eloise Lindsey, a middle-aged African-American couple in Oberlin, Ohio. Horton described the Lindseys as amazing parents and recalled many stories that painted a picture of the couple as loving, supportive, financially comfortable and well-connected in the community. Mrs. Lindsey was a college graduate and a born teacher who made learning great fun for her daughter. Mr. Lindsey was a successful real estate investor and businessman. Both of the Lindseys had grown up in Birmingham, Alabama, before eventually moving north and settling in Oberlin.\n\nAs early as first grade, Horton noticed subtle disparities between the ways that white and black children were treated in school. She also noticed how few African-American teachers there were in the schools. By the time Horton was in fourth grade, the racial discrimination became more apparent, from both students and teachers. Horton remained in the Oberlin School District through eighth grade.\n\nThe Lindseys moved to Wellington when Horton was entering 9th grade, and she became the only black girl in the high school. Her life outside-of-school remained centered in Oberlin, including church attendance and activities, sports, dances, and her network of friends. At Wellington High School, Horton experienced daily racist remarks and was miserable (although she kept her grades up). By her senior year, she told her parents, “If you don’t get me out of this school, I am quitting.”\n\nAt 16, she became pregnant with her first child, Annessa Oliver. Horton’s parents were understanding and positive, and they helped her raise her child so that Horton could finish high school. After giving birth to her second child, Arnett Oliver, a boy who was born deaf, Horton (at age 21) decided to go to college. With the support of her parents, Horton enrolled at Lorain County Community College and completed her bachelor’s degree at Baldwin Wallace College in 1976. Three months after graduation, Horton began teaching in the Oberlin public schools.\n\nHer first teaching assignment was at Pleasant School; she also taught for a time at Prospect School. Eventually, Horton moved to the middle school, where she taught science and health for many years, although she wrapped up her long career in the Oberlin schools teaching art. Even in the early years of her “retirement,” Horton continued to work as a substitute teacher and tutored many individual students. She was especially proud of the students she tutored – young people she referred to as those “the school gave up on” – and every one of the students she tutored graduated. She fully retired in 2018.\n\nAt the time of this interview, she was helping to raise her son’s twins, a girl Lindsey and a boy Jamar. Horton completed Part One of the interview with stories about how she believed today’s students and staff had changed from the time she attended the Oberlin schools.\n\nAs a middle school student, Horton even had the opportunity to meet Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. following his Oberlin College Commencement speech, and he took a moment to share with her some personal words of wisdom.\n\nPart Two of Horton’s interview took place by telephone a week later, and began with more stories about her adoptive parents. Roosevelt Lindsey did not have much formal education, yet he became a savvy businessman and investor. In Oberlin, he joined a group of black investors, led by Eva Mae Crosby, an African-American attorney in the community. Crosby also knew Eloise Lindsey, as both were part of a group called the Black Progressives.\n\nEloise was well-educated and had graduated from Tuskegee Institute. She was the daughter of a southern minister, Oscar Silas. Rather soon after Eloise and Roosevelt settled in Oberlin, Eloise’s parents moved up from Alabama to live with them.\n\nRoosevelt and Eloise Lindsey were very active in their faith, and Annetta grew up in the church. When she was adopted by them, the family attended an Apostolic Church on East Hamilton Street. Eventually, they transferred their membership to Mount Zion Baptist Church at Locust and Pleasant Streets. Reverend Fred Steen was the pastor there at the time and was part of the story about how little Annetta Westerfield came to be adopted by the Lindseys.\n\nHorton recalled African-Americans in Oberlin who had an impact on her life when she was a young woman, such as Trevesta Robinson who led some of the girls’ activities at church, and the actor (and Oberlin College graduate) Avery Brooks who organized activities for young people at the Masonic Temple. She also praised some of the African-American women in Oberlin today who were having an impact on the community, such as Connie Ponder, Linda Isabel and Phyllis Yarber Hogan.\n\nHorton grew up in a three-generation household, and she replicated this same living arrangement at the time of this interview, explaining that she shared a house with her son and was helping to raise his two children. She noted that all of her grandchildren are biracial, and implied that her children have helped her grow beyond the segregated community of her youth.
