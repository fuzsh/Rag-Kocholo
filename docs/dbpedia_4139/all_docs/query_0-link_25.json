        "text": "The records have been reconstructed from \"fragments\" dispersed in the City Archives. They consist primarily of incoming correspondence to the mayor, arranged alphabetically by name of corporate or individual correspondent. Correspondence marked with clear filing notes has been filed according to the subject designated in the note and arranged chronologically within the subject category. Among the subjects covered most substantially are the strike by workers constructing the Public Belt (Huey P. Long) Bridge, the activities of the federal Civil Works Administration, the administration of New Orleans Public Library (especially several employee conflicts , including controversy surrounding Head Librarian D.D. Moore), the Lakes -to-the-Gulf Waterway, and the National Rivers and Harbors Congress. Also of interest are a number of letters, filed by name of correspondent, supporting Walmsley's efforts to curb Huey Long's power over the city. Notable correspondents include Eddie Rickenbacker, Franklin D. Roosevelt, A.B. Freeman, and the mayors of several American cities.\n\nT. Semmes Walmsley (1889-1942) served as Acting Mayor of New Orleans from 1929-30 and Mayor from 1930-36, resigning two years into his second term. Born in New Orleans in 1889, he graduated from Tulane University, practiced law in the city, and entered politics under the \"Old Regular\" Democratic regime. From 1919 to 1924, he was Assistant Attorney General for Louisiana and from 1924 to 1926 served as City Attorney under the administration of Martin Behrman. He was elected Commissioner of Public Finance in 1926 and retained that post until he became acting mayor in 1929, succeeding Arthur J. O'Keefe, who resigned due to illness. Walmsley was elected mayor in 1930 and again in 1934.\n\nWalmsley's administration was marked by the Old Regulars' on-going power struggle with Huey P. Long, who as governor and (from 1932) as U.S. Senator, stripped the city of much of the power afforded it by the City Charter. In 1936, following Long's assassination in September 1935, Walmsley resigned from office, having been assured that legislation restoring home rule to New Orleans would be enacted."
