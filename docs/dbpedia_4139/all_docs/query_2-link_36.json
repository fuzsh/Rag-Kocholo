        "text": "John Abraham, MD\n\nCurrent position: Attending emergency medicine physician, independent contractor, Washington, DC\n\nA Word About Duke EM: After exploring many options for residency all along the east coast, I found myself drawn to Duke and the opportunities available through hospital and the university.\n\nAs a resident, I had many avenues to pursue my professional interests. Dr. Broder and the faculty [were] also very supportive of my interests in hospital administration and leadership. I served as member of the Resident Patient Safety & Quality Council for our hospital as well as Vice Chair of the International Committee for AAEM/RSA. I chose Duke because of the strong commitment to resident education and building future leaders in emergency medicine.\n\nIdan Cudykier, MD\n\nCurrent position: ER Attending, US Acute Care Solutions, Concord, NC\n\nMedical School: University of Miami\n\nA Word About Duke EM: The first year was a very steep learning curve. The acuity and complexity of the patients at Duke is very high and you see a lot and learn a lot. Our attendings are great and we are exposed to different practicing styles which teach not only pure medical knowledge but also a lot about the \"art of medicine\". The ED staff is great from nurses to respiratory therapists and it makes your work easier.\n\nSeth Holt, MD\n\nOhio State University College of Medicine\n\nSopagna Kheang, MD\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Florida Emergency Physician of TeamHealth, Orlando, FL\n\nMedical School: University of Florida\n\nA Word About Duke EM: Duke University stuck out to me during the interview trail as a program where I would fit best in and train well. The program director made quite an impression and continued to do so every day. The faculty here is very energetic and diverse. They facilitate your aspirations and support you in every endeavor you can possibly imagine. If there is an interest, you will always find support, be it research, global health, simulation, ultrasound, toxicology just to name a few. The support you receive from faculty, co-residents, RTs, pharmacists and nurses here foster a great learning environment and make residency that much more enjoyable.\n\nTyler LeVick, MD\n\nTexas Tech University Health Science Center, School of Medicine\n\nA Word About Duke EM: From the invitation to interview, to the interview process, and eventual second look, I was hooked [on Duke]. The faculty, staff, and co-residents provided a better learning environment than I could have hoped for. The patient complexity and pathology from day to day, whether in pediatrics or adult EM, medicine or trauma, was exceedingly challenging. The community medicine experience at Duke Regional Hospital provided me with bread and butter patient cases, and more confidence in managing them due to my experience at Duke.\n\nI love to teach medical students and am primarily interested in the cognitive aspects of emergency medicine practice, i.e. approach to differential diagnosis, patient management, and disposition.

During my time at Duke, I was blown away by the numerous ongoing research projects and the environment of collaboration and support between residents, faculty, and various departments.\n\nThe program size is an advantage in that we are like a family. Our fellow residents are very supportive of each other and faculty are always available for advice or guidance. Duke Emergency Medicine residency not only gave me a strong clinical background, but sparked my interest in EMS and global health. I found incredible mentors who continued to guide my career even during my years away. Ultimately, the phenomenal academic support, unique and challenging patient population, and supportive teaching and learning environment are what encouraged me to return to Duke as faculty.\n\nKevin Tomecsek, MD, Chief Resident\n\nCurrent Position: Clerkship Director at AdventHealth East Orlando EM Residency\n\nPrevious Positions:\n\nFaculty at Florida Hospital Emergency Medicine Residency, Orlando, FL\n\nLoma Linda University SOM Faculty\n\nUniversity of Central Florida COM Volunteer Faculty\n\nMedical School: University of Miami Miller School of Medicine\n\nHonors/Awards:\n\nFaculty of the Year Award AdventHealth East Orlando EM Residency 2020-2021\n\nFaculty of the year Award AdventHealth East Orlando EM Residency 2018-2019\n\nA Word About Duke EM: I chose Duke for residency as I felt the faculty were very supportive and were excellent educators.

I attended\n\nAlthough I was born and raised in the U.S., most of my extended family lives in Pakistan. My frequent trips there have led to my interests in international medicine and critical care. My other interests include baking, working out, spending time with friends and family, and the Patriots - I am a diehard Patriots fan!\n\nAfter working in a community setting for several years, I can attest that the Duke Emergency Department sees a large volume of high acuity patients. Residents receive a lot of training on managing the critically ill patient, who are often also very medically complex. The Duke Pediatric ER is also quite busy and my experience doing shifts there and the PICU prepared me well for managing sick neonates, infants and children as an attending.\n\nOverall, my experience at Duke prepared me well for my career. Upon graduating, I felt confident managing multiple medically complex and critically ill patients while also tending to more \"bread and butter\" emergency department patients.\n\nI would highly recommend this program to any candidate.\n\nBrandeis University for college where I majored in biology and economics.

His residency training was done at Duke University in Durham, NC, where he also served as chief resident. He then relocated back home to Florida to complete a fellowship in emergency ultrasound at the University of Florida. His interests include graduate and undergraduate medical education, ultrasound program administration, and provider-patient communication. He is active in national societies including the American Academy of Emergency Physicians, American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the American College of Emergency Physicians where he recently collaborated on a manuscript to revise the ACGME competencies in ultrasound for emergency medicine residents. In his leisure time he enjoys outdoor recreation, time with family, and Tim Burton movies. He currently resides in Fleming Island, FL, with his wife Katie, dog Chloe, and cat Miah.\n\nKory Dawson, MD\n\nClass of 2014\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nI was born in central Pennsylvania, and grew up in a very small town. My first job was a construction worker there, but my ambition of becoming a doctor lead me to attend Juniata College. To afford college I continued working construction to pay the bills. During one summer in college, I worked in Vanderbilt Medical Center on research with a neonatologist there, but aside from that my summers were spent mostly on pickup trucks and roofs.\n\nI was then uprooted from my quaint rural Pennsylvania life and began medical school in north Philadelphia at Temple University in one of the worst areas of the city. After the initial culture shock, I began to really enjoy working with the sick and wounded patient population we saw there everyday.\n\nStephanie Pendergrass, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2014\n\nCurrent position: EMS Fellow, Emergency Physician, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nThe first 10 years of my life were spent in Virginia Beach, Virginia, after which my middle and high school years were spent in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I traded the beach for the mountains in 2003 when I started college at Clemson University and majored in Biological Sciences. (Go Tigers!)\n\nThough my blood runs orange, I attended medical school at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine where I discovered my love for emergency medicine. I completed my 20th year of school in 2011 and am pumped to (finally) start working!\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy watching college sports, cooking, drinking wine, and spending time with my family, friends, and my dog, Waylon. I am at my happiest when I am on a lake or listening to any type of music, two things that I have found to be plentiful in the Durham area. I am thrilled to have been a part of the emergency medicine program at Duke University!\n\nLuke Poth, MD\n\nClass of 2014\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, San Francisco, California\n\nI was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, and as you will see have never ventured too far from home. You may be familiar with Akron because the University won the collegiate soccer championship in 2010 but is more likely you know Akron because it is the hometown of the now infamous Lebron James.\n\nI went to the University of Akron and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. I subsequently worked for three years at Lockheed Martin (in Akron) where I was afforded the opportunity to travel and work on many interesting projects. However, after much contemplation I decided to go to medical school at Northeast Ohio Medical University (near Akron).\n\nTanner Van Dell, MD\n\nClass of 2014\n\nCurrent position: Physician, Tristar Summit Hospital, Nashville, TN\n\nAccomplishments: Established a diabetes educational symposium for local patients on a quarterly basis involving family practitioners, endocrinologists, and emergency physicians.\n\nDKA and diabetes related admissions have decreased approximately 25% over 2 years.\n\nNicholas E. Lauerman, MD\n\nChief Resident, Duke EM Class of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician at Roper Hospital\n\nPrevious Position: Assistant Professor of Surgery, Duke Emergency Medicine\n\nMedical School: Rush Medical College\n\nI was born and raised in Chicago. I attended the University of Richmond where I studied chemistry, biology, and art history as well as running on the Division 1 cross country team and playing club ice hockey. While there I worked in an undergrad research lab studying organic synthesis of biologically active molecules. Through this experience I discovered my interest in medicine and that bench research was not my cup of tea.\n\nAfter graduating I moved back to Chicago where I attended medical school at Rush University. My interest in emergency medicine stemmed from my days as a Boy Scout, EMT training, and my short attention span.\n\nI choose to come to Duke for residency based on the program reputation, the outstanding faculty, and the residents. My interests within EM lay in resident and medical student education, simulation, and toxicology. Durham has provided my wife and I lots of opportunities -- from her returning to school to the ability to enjoy the outdoors, from the ocean to the mountains.\n\nBrian Burrows, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC\n\nMy time at Duke has been wonderful. Both the acuity of patients seen at Duke as well as the attendings giving appropriate autonomy allows us to take care of the sickest of the sick on a daily basis.\n\nAs a Duke ED resident you will become very comfortable with \"Duke sick\" patients. You will experience transplant patients of all kinds, every type of shock, as well as a multitude of trauma patients every shift. As an intern it was wonderful to have such great senior residents and attending physicians guiding me. I was allowed the opportunity to perform all the procedures, as well as given the time to learn about what was actually wrong with the patient. This combination has given me the confidence to handle everything that comes in the door.\n\nAside from Duke itself, North Carolina has been home for me and my wife now for about eight years. We have two sons, Jax (three years) and Alex (20 months), and raising them in North Carolina has been wonderful. For fun, I like to mountain bike, fish, camp, and just get outside whenever I can.\n\nJeffrey Hope, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Portsmouth Regional Hospital, New Hampshire\n\nI am working at Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire's Seacoast. We have about 25 beds, census of around 27000 and are single MD coverage with 2 PA's for 12 hours a day. It is a busy ED, especially in the summer months with a significant influx of visitors to the area. We have almost all specialties at this relatively large community hospital and are currently applying for Level 2 Trauma Center designation. I recently accepted a position as the hospital's Stroke Medical Director. I found this job through another Duke EM Residency Graduate. My first year of independent practice has been a constant learning experience. There are definitely times when I have been the one with the diaphoresis, but drawing form my Duke experience I have always had a plan of action.\n\nAliiah Jourdain, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician\n\nI was born in Inglewood, California, but lived most of my life in Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from the State University of West Georgia with a degree in Chemistry. I then attended Loma Linda University in California for medical school.\n\nIn between school, I’ve worked as a daycare aid, tutor, and door-to-door book sales person. I enjoy foreign language studies, travel, and various creative pursuits including music/video production and cooking. I would describe myself as an extroverted introvert, and I love meeting new people.\n\nNeel Kapadia, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position:Assistant Medical Director, Division of Emergency Medicine; Assistant Professor of Surgery, Duke University\n\nThe desire to leave California finally hit me. I was born and raised in southern California. I went to undergrad at UCLA, majoring in Physiological Science, and working with heart and lung transplantation throughout undergrad. I went to medical school at UC Irvine where I also got my MBA.\n\nOne of my claims to fame is being on Family Feud, but, unfortunately, my family didn’t fare too well. I really enjoy being able to travel internationally. I also love cooking, running, working out, people watching at local coffee shops, and anything that has to do with sports -- college, professional, basketball, football, and baseball.\n\nMegan Kemnitz, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Durham VA Medical Center\n\nMidwesterner at heart, I grew up in southeast Michigan. I did my undergraduate training in biomedical engineering at Cornell University then went to the University of Michigan for medical school.\n\nMy interests in emergency medicine focus on providing the best possible patient care in terms of safety, compassion and efficiency. I have a particular interest in pediatrics and ultrasound.\n\nI chose Duke because of the strong and enthusiastic faculty and residents who prioritize not only being excellent physicians, but also pursuing outside interests. The Triangle and Duke University also make Durham an excellent place to live for young people and families.\n\nGeorganna Rosel, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Attending Emergency Physician at University of Tennessee Medical Center, Knoxville, with Teamhealth.\n\nI was born in Madison, WI, but raised in East Tennessee. After high school, I joined the Marine Corps and set off for California. I had a great time in Irvine and then San Diego before returning to East Tennessee State University for college and medical school.\n\nSomewhere in that adventure, I found a man crazy enough to marry me. I stole him away from his native San Francisco and have since trained him to take care of everything in my life outside of medicine. (I am joking. He may just catch a plane back if he hears me say that I’ve trained him.) He is a reformed computer programmer turned EMT.\n\nWe have a beautiful precocious daughter who wants to be a “princess football-player doctor” when she grows up.\n\nMichael Ward, MD\n\nClass of 2013\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician\n\nI was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where despite contrary belief, I had plenty of running water and electricity. After dealing with sub-zero temperatures during the winter months of my youth, I decided to move to a familiar climate in Boston, Massachusetts, where I attended Boston College and earned degrees in finance and chemistry.\n\nUpon graduation from BC, I hung around Boston and began pursuing an MD/MBA from Tufts University Medical School. During my third year of medical school, I took some time off and worked for a health care investment bank in New York.\n\nAndrew Parker, MD\n\nClass of 2012\n\nCurrent position: EM Physician Petaluma Valley Hopital in Petaluma, CA\n\nPrevious position:\n\nEM Physician Community Hospital Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, CA\n\nPhysician, St. Charles Medical Center, Bend, OR\n\nMedical School: UNC Chapel Hill\n\nPeople respect the Duke pedigree all across the country. The training I received and the connections I made at Duke set me up for a lifetime of success.\n\nDuke enabled me to live and work and play where I choose, which is priceless. After residency I moved to California where I first took a job north of San Francisco and enjoyed all that wine country had to offer. Next my wife Maryellen and I moved south and landed a job at Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula (CHOMP), right down the street from the famous golf course Pebble Beach. We enjoyed the surf and fancy beach life but missed the mountains so we packed up for Bend, Oregon to settle down and start a family. Within a half hour of downtown Bend, we have over 300 miles of world class mountain biking trails, class III to V whitewater paddling, the second largest single mountain ski resort in the US and Smith Rock--the birthplace of sport climbing. This is outdoor paradise where people live to play, not work. My co-workers are some of my best friends. This winter 8 of us, all EM doctors, went back country skiing in the Wallawa Mountains. Epic. When I'm not playing I am the medical director for Jefferson County EMS/Fire in addition to my regular job in the ED. Come visit and my little 3yo daughter, Jordan, will give you the grand tour.\n\nSteven J.

For the past 3 years, I have served as an Emergency Airway Management Physician with the New Orleans Saints and National Football League. Additionally, in 2013, I worked with former Duke EM attendings Dr. Eric Ossmann and Dr. Matt Bitner at Super Bowl XLVII providing prehospital care.

While she loved North Carolina, she was thrilled to be headed back west for fellowship! She spends her free time taking advantage of Utah's awesome outdoors with hiking, skiing, camping, biking, and running. The rest of her free time is spent with her dog, family, friends, and at the Crossfit gym.

I've got what I consider the perfect job -- I was able to find a private group in the community practice setting -- it actually happens to be the first private group ever established in the country by the first grads from University of Cincinnati! Although private practice, I also get the opportunity to interact with residents and fellows from Cincinnati .... I feel it's the best of both worlds.\n\nThe best part of Duke, besides the people, is that once you graduate you've truly gotten the experience and exposure you need to handle anything. It's bittersweet to graduate though and similar to med school in that respect -- once you leave you realize how much fun it really was.\n\nThomas Bernard, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2011\n\nCurrent position: Board Of Directors Member, WakeMed, Raleigh, NC\n\nI am currently on the Board of Directors for WEPPA (Wake Emergency Physicians, PA) and am on the Board of NCCEP as the legislative liaison.\n\nSpencer Smith, MD\n\nClass of 2011\n\nCurrent position: Medical Director, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT\n\nDuring his Emergency Medicine residency at Duke, Dr. Smith was encouraged to pursue an area of focused professional development. His interests lead him to Disaster Medicine, a specialty that focuses on the medical aspects of disaster preparation, response, and mitigation. As a resident, he worked with various local and state EMS and disaster groups to gain skills in mass gathering medical control, hospital/ED incident command, and trained with the state Special Operations Response Team. Since moving to Utah, he has been a part of the Utah Disaster Medical Assistance Team (UT-1 DMAT) and Utah Task Force 1 (UT TF-1) Urban Search and Rescue Team and plans to pursue an active role with state disaster management as well as become involved with hospital disaser preparedness.\n\nAfter residency, Dr. Smith stayed on as an attending physician at Duke for several months before coming to the University of Utah.

I first came to North Carolina as a Duke undergrad. Since then, I have accumulated four more years at Wake Forest for Medical School and another year at East Carolina for PGY-1 in EM.\n\nY’all can say I am accustomed to sweet tea and bar b q.

When I was young, my family and I moved between Florida and New York several times, finally settling in Florida where I attended high school.\n\nThroughout high school, I raced motocross professionally and later attended Florida State University where I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I worked as an Aerospace engineer at Pratt & Whitney for seven years before deciding it was time for a change. I then attended the University Of Vermont College Of Medicine where I quickly developed an interest in Emergency Medicine.\n\nI consider myself a sports fanatic. I love all sports; however, mountain bike racing and racquetball are my sports.\n\nLauren Southerland, MD\n\nClass of 2011\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Ohio State University\n\nDr. Southerland completed Geriatric EM fellowship in Detroit and has established a Geriatric Emergency Department at Ohio State, scheduled to open in January 2015.

I couldn’t fight the beaches, the early spring weather, and the really nice people, and so have been here ever since.\n\nI have a fantastic husband who knows to feed me chocolate when I’m stressed, I’m a dedicated Cameron Crazy (I can even do the Rock Lobster dance during the second half TV timeout), and I love discussing esoteric aspects of emergency medicine.\n\nSpencer Smith, MD\n\nClass of 2011\n\nCurrent position: University of Utah, Clinical Instructor\n\nNot long after being born in Mesa, AZ, I was moved to a cooler clime and soon called the Rocky Mountains of Utah home. There, I was raised amongst the towering peaks that surrounded me and developed a love for adventure and the outdoors. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to enjoy some of the best backpacking, camping, and snowboarding in the country. I also spent time traveling and living in Amsterdam for several years as a missionary, the Middle East as a student, and South Africa as a researcher\n\nI met my wonderful wife, Kristy, at a hospital where we both worked as phlebotomists. Our oldest son, Ayden, joined the family shortly after we were married. I went to college at Brigham Young University where I majored in Neuroscience and Economics before uprooting my young family and moving to New York City. I attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons for medical school and our second son, Hudson, was born on the river that bears his name.\n\nDr. Smith is a practicing Emergency Medicine Physician who specializes in resuscitation of critical patients.

I graduated from Stanford University in 2000 and came to medical school at Duke in 2001. I graduated with an MD/MBA in 2007, including a one year research project at the NIH from 2003-2004.\n\nThe reason I chose to come to Duke for my emergency medicine residency was for the faculty. I graduated from the residency in 2010 and worked part time as a clinical associate in the Division of Emergency Medicine at Duke.\n\nI now work at a community hospital in Burlington, NC -- Alamance Regional Medical Center (ARMC). While dividing my time has some challenges, I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to be part of the Duke faculty team, and also to practice emergency medicine in a community hospital.\n\nProfessionally, I have \"grown up\" at Duke, so working at ARMC allows me to practice medicine in an arena that has clinical, administrative, and practical constraints and freedoms that are different from a major medical center like Duke. I really enjoy teaching, and my shifts at ARMC made me a better, more rounded teacher to my residents and students at Duke.\n\nChoosing a residency program is tough, but for me, Duke was a great choice because I got excellent training and clinical exposure, and was surrounded by smart and fun colleagues whom I liked so much that I wanted to stick around!\n\nAdam Chandler, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2010\n\nCurrent position: Attending Physician CHI St. Vincent's Little Rock, AR\n\nPrevious positions:\n\nAssistant Professor, Assistant Residency Director, Student Clerkship Director, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR\n\nAttending Physician Washington Regional Fatettville, AR\n\nMedical School: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences\n\nHonors/Awards: 2014 Robert A.

After attending medical school at LSU in New Orleans, I decided to head up the heart of ACC basketball country for residency.\n\nAfter interviewing with many programs, I had a gut feeling that Duke would be a good fit for me. Combining a great mix of outstanding clinical core/non-core faculty, an outstanding community ER experience, and diverse patient base, Duke had everything needed to prepare me for my future as an emergency medicine physician.\n\nAfter residency, I served as an emergency physician for Ochsner Clinic Foundation in New Orleans, Louisiana, and worked at multiple hospitals within our system. I now practice at East Jefferson General Hospital in New Orleans. I also serve as a sideline ER physician for the New Orleans Saints. When I'm not at the hospital or traveling, I enjoy all of the food, fun, and music that New Orleans has to offer.\n\nChad Cochran, MD\n\nClass of 2010\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Montana\n\nTJ Veldhouse, MD\n\nClass of 2010\n\nCurrent position: Emergency consultant at Waitemata District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nCurtis Carriker, MD\n\nClass of 2010\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Texas\n\nEmily Damuth, MD\n\nClass of 2011\n\nCurrent position: Assistant Professor of Medicine and Emergency Medicine, intensivist, Cooper University Health Care, Camden, NJ\n\nFellowship: Critical Care Medicine\n\nCongratulations on choosing Emergency Medicine -- you've made a great decision! I am a recent Duke graduate (2011).\n\nThe opportunity for board certification in Critical Care Medicine through EM training arose in the fall of 2010, and after graduation from Duke EM, I completed Critical Care Medicine fellowship at Cooper University Hospital. After finishing my Critical Care fellowship, I received a dual appointment at Cooper University Hospital: Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine. I now spend 50% time in ICU and the other half in the Emergency Department.\n\nI wouldn't trade my Duke EM training for anything. With the procedural competency and experience handling multiple critically ill patients at a time I gained at Duke, I feel amply prepared for any emergency in the unit or a decompensating patient on the floor.\n\nResidency at Duke taught me a fundamental approach to assessing ABCs to rapidly distinguish sick from not sick. I miss my colleagues at Duke immensely and still regularly keep in touch with the residents and attendings.

I am originally from Utah but was drawn away from the mountains to enjoy beautiful North Carolina. After my time at Duke, my obligation to Uncle Sam came due. I served active duty with the United States Navy. During that time, I was stationed at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, VA, where I served on the staff at one of the Navy's two Emergency Medicine Residencies. I also deployed with a Forward Surgical Team to Afghanistan in support of Operation New Dawn.\n\nBecause of my training in emergency medicine and specifically my training at Duke in medical education, I was able to comfortably practice in an austere environment as well as to focus on bringing training to the people of Afghanistan. While there, I designed and implemented a Basic Science and First Aid Course (similar to EMT) taught to the medics of the Afghan National Army in our area. I was able to treat pathology ranging from DKA to severe blast trauma to subarachnoid hemorrhage and sepsis in an undiagnosed patient with leukemia. I was also tasked to be the command training officer as well as the Mass Casualty director for a multinational military base of approximately 3000 troops.\n\nToday, I practice emergency medicine in Utah. My time at Duke was world class training at a world class hospital. We absolutely loved our time in Durham and the people we met and work with. I fully credit my attendings and staff at Duke for making me a confident, competent and skilled physician.\n\nKenton Anderson, MD\n\nClass of 2009\n\nCurrent position:\n\nStanford University School of Medicine (2016–Present)\n\nCo-Director, Emergency Ultrasound Fellowship\n\nDirector, Emergency Ultrasound Research\n\nAssociate Professor of Emergency Medicine\n\nPast positions: Assistant Professor, Emergency Medicine Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (2014–2016)\n\nAssistant Professor of Emergency Medicine\n\nSan Antonio Military Medical Center (2010–2014)\n\nDirector, Air Force Emergency Ultrasound\n\nAssistant Professor of Emergency and Military Medicine\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (2009–2010)\n\nFellow, Emergency Ultrasound\n\nClinical Instructor of Emergency Medicine\n\nCo-Director of Emergency Ultrasound, San Antonio Military Medical Center\n\nFellowship: Emergency Ultrasound, University of Pennsylvania\n\nMedical School: University of California, Irvine\n\nHonors/Awards:\n\n2nd Place: SAMHS and Universities Research Forum Poster Presentation (2019)\n\nHighly Cited Research - One of 5 Highest Cited Papers Published, Elsevier-American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016)\n\nResearch Award Nominee, American Academy of Emergency Ultrasound (2016)\n\nOutstanding Reviewer, American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016)\n\nPEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS:\n\n[In Press] Horton R, Niknam K, Lobo V, Jones D, Pade K, Anderson KL.

Subsequently I served in the Air Force as the Co-Director of Emergency Ultrasound for the Department of Defense's largest Emergency Medicine residency training program in San Antonio for four years. While I was in the military I also had the opportunity to deploy as the leader of a Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT), which is a flying ICU that carries the most critically wounded soldiers from the battlefield back to the United States. During my time as an Air Force officer, I also began performing CPR research using both TTE and TEE to guide resuscitative efforts in animal models, and I have continued that line of research since completing my military service. After leaving the military, I spent two years at the Baylor College of Medicine where I continued pursuing my research interests, and I am currently the Emergency Ultrasound Research Director and the Co-Director of the Emergency Ultrasound Fellowship at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\nThe broad patient population and world-class attendings at Duke provide an educational experience that prepares EM residency graduates to confidently care for anything that may come through the doors of their ED. Duke also has the resources and leadership to allow residents to develop expertise in a niche of interest during their training - the development of such niche interests during residency allows graduates to be competitive applicants for fellowships or other advanced formal academic training.\n\nJennifer Meyer, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2009\n\nCurrent position: Attending Physician at First Physician Corporation @ New Bedford, MA; EMS Director Tobey Hospital\n\nMedical School: University of Massachusetts\n\nPrevious Positions: Associate Professor at BUMC\n\nDuring my time at Duke I met attendings who continue to influence my career today.

I initially split time between a community affiliate hospital and the academic center, but quickly move to full time academics. I am now the clerkship director for the 4th year acting internship in emergency medicine, as well as the director for the off-service resident rotation. I have received a teaching award from the emergency medicine residents at Wake Forest, and I have lectured at the Medical Student Symposium at SAEM's Annual Meeting for the past two years.\n\nNatasha Powell, MD\n\nClass of 2009\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician\n\nJennifer Tighe DeSoto, MD\n\nClass of 2009\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Nebraska\n\nAmanda Barrett, MD\n\nClass of 2008\n\nAndi Chiumento Sharp, MD\n\nClass of 2008\n\nCurrent position: Assistant Professor at the Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville, Florida; Director of Emergency Palliative Medicine\n\nMedical School: St. George's University\n\nPrevious Positions:\n\nAttending Duke Raleigh Hospital (2008–2010)\n\nCommunity /Attending-Titan Emergency Group (2010–2012)\n\nClinical Instructor and Attending Physician @ Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, ACEP Palliative Section Member\n\nHonors/Awards:\n\n2016 Fellowship Hospice Palliative Medicine\n\nFantastic well rounded experience that prepared me for a fruitful career. Durham is a wonderful city to live and experience. Incredible attendings at a renowned institution\n\nI am an extremely proud and grateful to have completed my EM residency at Duke. It provided me a breadth of opportunity for a robust career in Emergency Medicine. The combination of complex medical and trauma patients encountered on a daily basis at Duke is a great strength of the program. The attendings and fellow residents completed my training experience and to this day we remain in contact. Its truly a \"family\" experience and I could not imagine having been elsewhere.\n\nSince graduating residency in 2008, I worked a few years at Duke Raleigh Hospital. However, being from Florida the right opportunity presented itself and I was able to move home and closer to family. I have been working at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville since 2012. I am well prepared for the complex patients we see here as result of my training at Duke. It is an honor to have worked at such revered institutions and the standard of care I learned at Duke has proved to benefit me in my current position. It is a great mix of community and academic medicine.\n\nWhile at Mayo, I became interested in Palliative Care. After careful deliberation, I decided to pursue a formal fellowship. I completed this in 2015 at the University of Florida. I have returned to Mayo with hopes to integrate palliative care principles and pathways in the Emergency Department.\n\nDuke was an outstanding place to learn emergency medicine and undoubtedly provided me the skills to succeed in my career.\n\nJustin Barrett, MD\n\nClass of 2008\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Lakewood, Colorado\n\nBrian Finnegan, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2008\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nFellowship: International Emergency Medicine, University of Maryland\n\nI currently work at Wellstar Kennestone Hospital in Marretta, GA.

Core faculty member for the Emergency Medicine residency program at the University of Utah. His research interests are focused on clinical outcomes in the Emergency Department and in the ICU\n\nI'm originally Canadian and was pleasantly surprised at the diverse and vibrant Duke community and surrounding city of Durham that supported me during my emergency medicine residency (2005-2008) and critical care fellowship (2009).\n\nI felt Duke was one of only a select few residency programs in the country able to provide robust exposure to both adult and pediatric emergency medicine while also getting a great deal of trauma (penetrating and blunt) all in a first-class academic setting. Institutional resources were plentiful, and training alongside world-renowned subspecialists enhanced my education greatly.\n\nOnly with the hard work and support of the Duke EM leadership and faculty was I able to get exactly what I needed out of my multidisciplinary critical care fellowship. Now at the University of Utah, I am a full-time intensivist in the Surgical ICU and continue to work clinically in the ED as one of the core faculty in the EM residency program here in Salt Lake City.\n\nTaylor Kallas, MD\n\nClass of 2008\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nDr. Kallas practices emergency medicine in his home region, the Salt Lake basin.\n\nDavid Davis, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2006\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Capital Region Medical Center, Tallahassee, Florida\n\nRichard Tempel, MD\n\nChief Resident, Class of 2006\n\nMedical School: University of Maryland\n\nCurrent position: Director, Blue Cedar Freestanding Emergency Department\n\nPast positions:\n\nNocturnal physician, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL\n\nFaculty, UCF School of Medicine\n\nMedical Director, Aphria Medical\n\nFellow, ACEP\n\nBoard of Directors, FMA Political Action Committee\n\nBoard of Directors, American Medical Marijuana Physicians Assoc (AMMPA)\n\nPreceptor, NOVA Family Medicine Osteopathic Residency Program\n\nPrior Medical Director, Orlando Resorts Medispa\n\nPrior Bedside US director for Harford Memorial Hospital, Florida Hospital Celebration\n\nAwards/Honors:\n\nPartner, Emergency Physicians of Central Florida\n\nPublications:\n\nDocumentary: Weediatrics: A Covert Medical Mission (Available on Apple and Google Play)\n\nI was once told that it doesn't matter where you go to medical school, it's where you do your residency that really matters.

I am involved in clinical teaching for our 3 year EM Residency program as well as medical students from the new University of Texas at Austin Medical School.\n\nThomas P LeBosquet III, MD FACEP\n\nClass of 2006\n\nCurrent position: Emergency physician, Portmouth, New Hampshire; Vice President of New Hampshire ACEP\n\nI frequently think about Duke. I have only positive reflections of the great training I received and the mentorship I had there.\n\nI currently work at a 200 bed hospital in my hometown of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. I have been in the same position since residency graduation in 2006. We have a busy little place with a wide variety of workload. Lots of geriatrics and lots of tourists in the summer. We have been excited as our hospital has been starting an official trauma program and is working towards credentialing as a Level II Trauma Center. To keep me rooted in Emergency Medicine, I am currently Vice President of New Hampshire ACEP, which has been a helpful way to get to know colleagues. What is really cool is that last summer, Jeff Hope, a 2014 Duke EM Residency grad, joined our group. This makes us one of the few EDs in the country (maybe the only outside of Duke?) with multiple Emergency Physicians trained at Duke.\n\nCharmaine Gregory, MD, FACEP\n\nCo-Chief Resident, Class of 2005\n\nMedical School: SUNY Buffalo School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Roles: Attending Physician, St. Joseph Mercy Hospital; Ann Arbor, Michigan (2005–2020)\n\nCurrent position: Attending Physician at Guam Regional Medical City; Guam\n\nHonors/Awards:\n\nGolden Apple Faculty Teaching Award\n\nFellow of the College of Emergency Physicians\n\nMichigan College of Emergency Physicians (MCEP) Emergency Physician of the Year (2019)\n\nI have fond memories of my three years of training in emergency medicine at Duke University Medical Center and Durham Regional Hospital. As part of the inaugural class, I am excited to see how the program has evolved over the years. It turns out that my very first job out of residency was a perfect fit, and I have the honor of working at a tertiary care community hospital with several residency training programs.\n\nTraining at Duke University Medical Center next to the best and brightest, while being guided in learning by phenomenal teachers, completely shaped the direction of my career in Emergency Medicine. The variety and depth of disease that comes through the doors of the Emergency Department coupled with cutting-edge research and applications for the field prepared me well for a fulfilling career of over 16 years in Emergency Medicine.\n\nAfter paying it forward for 14 years as faculty, it has been equally as rewarding to practice clinical emergency medicine outside of the resident teaching capacity. Now that I practice offshore, it is even more valuable to have had a strong foundation and for this I am grateful.\n\nThe elation and satisfaction that comes from practicing emergency medicine, teaching, and participating in administrative activities is only possible because of my tenure at Duke. Therefore, I am grateful for the faculty, staff and the institution for all that I have been afforded.\n\nDeric Jones, MD, FACEP\n\nCo-Chief Resident, Class of 2005\n\nCurrent position: Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine, DCH Regional Medical Center; Tuscaloosa, Alabama\n\nThe first day of my new job I was so thankful for my training. It was April 27, 2011 when Alabama suffered a series of tornadoes worse than anything the state had faced in decades. I had just moved to Tuscaloosa and my company was to assume the contract for the emergency department at DCH Regional Medical Center at midnight. I had been named the Medical Director and Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine in a department which sees about 70,000 patients per year and is the third largest ED in the state.\n\nViewing the ominous radar that foretold of the disaster, I had no idea where the safe shelter areas for the community were. I figured the hospital was one such place, so I drove there under an eerie sky with almost no other cars on the road. The day before I was to start working at DCH was the day that Mother Earth reminded all of us that she was in control while we could only scramble to survive.\n\nI joined a large group of hospital staff gathered around a television to watch a mile-wide tornado rip through the downtown area until it was two blocks from the hospital. Then the power went out.\n\nThe tornado had turned and missed the hospital by a couple of blocks. Emergency power came on for the essential functioning of the hospital and I found myself running off an adrenaline surge of emergency power as well.\n\nWe saw over 800 patients in 10 hours that day. Wearing jeans, a scrub top and my trusty Indiana Jones baseball cap, I had not yet learned the names of the staff, but I was singing praises to the names of my former residency director and attendings.\n\nAbout three hours into my disaster triage, I saw a man passing out water to medical staff. When he extended his arm, I saw the white band he received as a patient and was reminded that we were all feeling the need to help in whatever way we could. I am thankful that my training at Duke prepared me to treat those who had faced a true disaster.\n\nJeffery Metzger, MD\n\nClass of 2005\n\nCurrent position: Medical Director for the Dallas Police Department, Chief of Emergency Services for Parkland Health and Hospital System, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center\n\nFellowship: Government Emergency Medical and Security Services\n\nI am an extremely proud member of the inaugural class of the Duke University Medical Center Emergency Medicine Residency Program. I came to Duke in 2002 after graduating from UCLA School of Medicine. While at Duke I was exposed to many opportunities that have shaped my career into what it is now. In addition to giving me the skills and knowledge to be an outstanding emergency medicine physician, my experiences at Duke sparked an interest in both the field of tactical medicine and the business of medicine.\n\nSince graduating residency in 2005, I moved to Texas where I completed a two-year fellowship in EMS, disaster medicine, and tactical medicine. I am currently the medical director for the Dallas Police Department, where I also serve as a reserve police officer, and a member of the Dallas Police SWAT Team, providing operational medical support for a variety of operations, from barricaded persons and hostage situations to high risk warrant service and dignitary protection details.\n\nAdministratively, I am the Chief of Emergency Services for Parkland Health and Hospital System, overseeing the care of over 235,000 patient visits a year. My mentors at Duke were incredible role models and instilled a passion for the business and management of Emergency Medicine.\n\nDuke has been an outstanding place to learn emergency medicine, and has given me the skills needed to succeed in my career -- within the emergency department, within the board room, and on the streets.\n\nMichael Ghim, MD\n\nClass of 2005\n\nFollowing residency, I spent a fun year in Loma Linda, CA, for an EMS fellowship. I returned to NC and moved to Elon, NC, and spent 8 years at Moses Cone Hospital, now Cone Health. During my time there, I served as Medical Director for Guilford County EMS, Person County EMS and the Moses Cone Emergency Department. In 2012, I wanted more change and began my MBA studies at George Washington University. With two my of colleagues, we opened Triad Urgent Care in Greensboro, NC, in 2015. This year we opened Contour MedSpa. I parted ways with Cone Health shortly after we started our urgent care, and after spending a year at High Point Regional Hospital, I'm now working at various emergency departments as a locum tenens physician due to my multiple other responsibilities. What I'm most proud of however, is going on my first medical mission trip in August to serve the people of Haiti along with my wife and several volunteers from the Greensboro area.\n\nScott Rouse, MD\n\nClass of 2005\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, South Carolina\n\nDavid Smith, MD\n\nClass of 2005\n\nCurrent position: Emergency Physician, Florence, Oregon"
