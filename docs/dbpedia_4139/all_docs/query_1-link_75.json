He married Myrtie Lee BARBER 25 Nov 1901 in Logan Twp, Dearborn Co, IN3. She was born 16 Mar 1883 in Newcastle, Henry Co, IN4, and died 05 Sep 1944 in Logan Twp., Dearborn Co, IN5.\n\nMore About William Edward KOLB:\n\nBurial: Glen Haven Cem, Harrison, Hamilton Co, OH\n\nCause of Death: Coronary occlusion\n\nMedical Information: W.

It was the Kolb Homestead, but now (1955) is known as Bischoff's farm. (From S. R. 46, Chappelow Ridge Road runs north and the farm was the first one on the left at the top of the hill.) On this farm, Will and Myrtie's first set of twin girls, Ruth and Marie, were born. Then in 1903 or 1904 they moved down on the pike that is now U.S. 52 near where State Route 46 joins U.S. 52. It is between New Trenton, Indiana and Harrison, Ohio. It was called Braysville. In those days when U.S. 52 was a toll road they had a toll gate at Braysville. Will and Myrtie lived on the next farm west of this tollgate house. (Their daughter Hallie was born here.) Later on they discontinued the tollgate and a family by the name of Teichman lived in the old tollgate house. It was here that Ruth and Marie used to run off from home and do down to Tikie's, as we called them. Then we'd get hungry as kids do, we'd go to Tikie's and she would take us down in the cellar where she had cinnamon cake and milk and we'd sit on a long bench at the old table and eat. Once we took an old suitcase, a shoe, a doll and a dress and went to stay. We'd keep our folks busy as by then they had our sister, Hallie, who was just a baby. Our Uncle Frank Barber says that we used to play in the middle of the dirt road that was U.S. 52. People driving in their wagons and buggys to Harrison would have to drive around us playing in the middle of the road.\n\nWill and Myrtie lived on the pike from about 1904 until 1907. (For a short while they lived in a house on Grabil Creek [present Wesling Road] while the house they had been living in was rebuilt due to a fire.) Then they bought part of the Fred Widau farm from William and Ina Widau. Ina was Myrtie's sister. They moved into their home before the birth of their only son, Harry. They lived the rest of their lives on this farm of 76 acres which is in the northwest corner of LoganTownship in Dearborn County, Indiana.\n\nThere is a crossroad at the east and north side of the farm. One comes from South Gate, Indiana from the north and passes the farm and goes on east down the top of the hills to what at one time was called the Brunnel Hill and on over to what is now U.S. 52. The road that goes north and south of the farm starts from New Trenton, Indiana, comes up past the old Barber Homestead, up the Barber Hill and then south to what is called Logan Creek which now comes into State Route 46. This road divides the farm of Will and Myrtie's from Will and Ina Widau's farm. It also passed the old Kolb Homestead (George & Christina's) where Will and Myrtie first lived when they were married.\n\nThe house faced the north and was a frame building lined with stone between the outside and the plastered walls. It was a five room house consisting of kitchen, living room and a bedroom downstairs and two bedrooms upstairs. An attic ran across the south side of the house. The basement was under two rooms and built of flat rock; the floor also being of flat rock. There was a small back porch on the east end of the kitchen with a grape arbor along the sides of it to the east and south. Later on the porch was cemented and here is where the old rocking chairs stood for comfort of a restful time.\n\nThe barn was long shaped, about 125 by 75 ft and stood about 250 feet south of the house. Both the house and barn were painted white. The farm laid south of the buildings and had nice timber and pastures with plenty of spring water. On this clay ground they raised good crops, nice fruit trees and a big garden. They raised all their own food and also ran a dairy and sold milk to Cincinnati, Ohio milk firms, which was hauled by trucks. There was plenty of chicken, eggs and butter; the old smokehouse had good smoked ham, sausage, bacon and beef; the cellar was full of all kinds of vegetables, fruits, jams and jellies--any kind of food you wanted to eat.\n\nThere was a very good well a few feet from the house and when they moved there it had an old wooden cover and box frame around the well with a chain pump on it. Sometimes they would drop a bucket on a rope down to the water and draw it up that way. Later in years they put a cement top over the well and added a new pump and it is still there. There is a cistern across the driveway east of the house and a large cistern at the barn. Several nice maple trees stood around the house. There was always a breeze and plenty of fresh air. You could look for miles around the country and on the hills to the south you could see the lights of farm houses burning. To the west five or six miles was St. Leon, Indiana, and the gold cross on the Catholic Church would shine like a guiding light when the sun shone on it in the evening in the summertime.\n\nTwo large cedar trees stood in the large front yard along the road. Flowers of all kinds grew in the yard and along the house, and in the windows in the winter time. There were four Keifer pear trees, one at each corner of the yard, and a big Northern Spy apple tree about half way up the side of the yard along the garden fence. Between the two big cedar trees, Father put a long log in the top of them, then put an old hayfork rope on this log to make a big swing. You could swing way out over the road. This was a place where all the children of the neighborhood, families and friends enjoyed coming to and what they all called Uncle Bill's and Aunt Myrt's. There was a swing, croquet, baseball, horseshoe pitching and any kind of game to play in the summer. In the winter, it was fox and geese and sled riding.\n\nLots of times, gangs would take sleds, old bread pans, and boxes to slide down the hills into the pasture or in the big field in front of the house. When we'd have a big snow or sleet, you could go round and round in the bread pans, and what a thrill you'd have. We also went to bean hulling parties.\n\nThere was a time when we all went to New Trenton for a Christmas program. Several families went in the big farm wagons with lots of straw and pulled by a big team of horses. They took blankets and comforts to cover us small children up good. We enjoyed the program and when we started home, it began to snow. At the edge of New Trenton we came to the old covered bridge. When we got into it, the folks had everybody, about fifteen or more, to lay down and they covered everybody over with the comforts and blankets. Then they started home with the old coal lantern for light. It snowed so hard that our father could not see the heads of the horses and when we got home we had to have the snow scooped off us and dug out from under the comforts to find all of us. It was as warm as toast under the comforts for we were all bunched together. I will never forget it as I was about five or six years old (1908/09).\n\nMany family reunions were held at our home as there was plenty of ground to play in and to sit in the shade of the trees and visit. Plenty was on the big long table and several big ice cream freezers were always made. The old \"Home Comfort\" range was always hot and ready to start cooking, the big water tank on the range would sing. The old phonograph would be playing in the living room with singing of old songs and dancing in the house or out in the yard under the apple trees. The long table always had food of all kinds.\n\nAt Easter time it was the hunting and gathering of eggs. Sometimes we put the eggs into Mother's big apron and as we hunted she would walk behind and re-hide them. We spent many fine times doing it and there were plenty of tired legs and feet.\n\nAt Christmas time we didn't have a lot of gifts but there was always a cedar tree all trimmed with small packages under it for all. It was always a big surprise what the tree would look like on that morning. Some years we would have company and then some years we would go somewhere else. Father and Mother loved company and had many reunions, family gatherings, neighbors visiting and helping one another and always doing for others what they could.\n\nThe old house burned on Sunday, August 15, 1926. They never knew how the fire started as there was only the oil stove going. Father was sitting in the front room at the front door reading when about 15 neighbors came running and driving in cars to tell him that the house was on fire as the flames were then coming out of the upstairs windows and the attic was like a furnace. There was no electric in the house at the time and no fire was in the range. So they think it was started by a bird carrying a match into its nest. They saved most of the things in the downstairs and the food in the cellar, but their bedding and clothes were all gone.\n\nThey built the new home on the same site and was moved back into the new house by October 16, 1926. That would be in two months time. It was the work of good neighbors and friends that helped in building it so fast. They built a six room house that had three bedrooms upstairs and three rooms downstairs, the kitchen, living room and a bedroom. It was of frame with a shingle roof and painted white.\n\nThere was a shed across the driveway where the small tools, washtubs, hoes, and rakes were kept. Here also was the home of our collie or hound pups when we had a bunch of them. At the end of the shed was the old dinner bell.\n\nThere was always a big time with the puppies when they would get into the flower beds. All the puppies were named before it left the home. When someone came to get one, it was always a guess as to who would lose their pup. Lots of dresses, sheets and clothes were torn up because of the pups but that was just the life of the farm.\n\nOther events in the life of the farm were when the old cow chased us over the barbed wire fence; the time old Major, the horse, kicked up his heels along the road and threw Harry in the ditch full of spring rains; the time the hogs got into our fine garden and ate it up; the times the cows found our popcorn even if it was in the middle of the corn patch; the time Mother fell head first between the hay mow and a big load of hay and we had to move the wagon up in the barn to get her out; the time when Mother rolled off the mower she was riding and fell into a small gully and Father and Harry asked her if they should use the horses to pull her out of the gully; the time when Dad was helping take honey from the bee hives and the man that was helping got the whole swarm on him and we all had to run for the house; the time that Hallie hid and we looked the place over for her until someone found her asleep in the cellar; the times that Ruth and Marie would dress up and run off to Krietes and show off; the time in the summer when we were all in the spring wagon which was under the apple tree beside the house, ready to go to sleep and old Mike, the hound dog, was under it. The neighbor came over to see us and the old dog would not let him near us in the wagon until we went into the house; the time that Edna tried to eat all the gravel that Dad had put in front of the house.\n\nIt was on this farm that all the children, from their son, Harry, on to the baby were born, and these children were, Harry, Esther, Nellie, Edna and Grace. Will and Myrtie lived here until Myrtie's death, then Will sold the farm to Andrew J. and Vernal Banks on February 21, 1946. Then William Kolb had a sale and went to make his home with his daughter, Nellie, and Edwin Barth, near Harrison, Ohio (on Bond Road). He would go visit the rest of the children and he spent some time with his son, Harry, and wife, Tommy, in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He enjoyed that stay as he got to go to an Indian Dance and celebration and some western roundups. He also saw a lot of country while he was with Harry and Tommy. In the winter he stayed at Nellie Barth's home. It was while he was staying in Esther New's home helping care for her children while she was in the hospital with a new baby girl that William had a heart attack and passed away there in the New home on October 8, 1948.\n\nSo this is the story of their lives and home life of our Dear Father and Mother. All of their children were christened in the MethodistChurch at New Trenton, Indiana\n\nThis has been written by their daughter, Ruth, as near as she's been able to write it or try to get a record of some kind made to hand on down to the generations to come.\n\nHere are a few things us girls remember of home and what happened. As time goes on there will be things added to this.\n\nWe remember the pretty chimes of the bells of St. Joe Church at St. Leon, as they had come from the old country and had a beautiful sound to them. In the summer the sun would set on the south side of the steeple on April 16th and on April 17th it would set on the north side of the steeple. It never failed on those dates of the year.\n\nWe can still hear the mockingbird singing his night song sitting on top of the lightning rod on top of the tall silo. He would sing and fly straight up in the air about 50 or 60 feet and come straight down lighting on the rod and never missing a note in his song. You could hear him at it till eleven at night and he came year after year.\n\nHere are some of the funny things----\n\nThe time when Harry fell off the high chair into a tub of liver sausage and was sausage from head to toe. He was a small boy then. Also the time when he sit backwards into a full bucket of separated milk in the kitchen spilling milk everywhere. Our Uncle Chris Holden and family was there and he laughed so hard that he got sick and threw up his good chicken and noodles dinner. What a mess Harry put them all in.\n\nThe time Hallie went to wash Esther's and Nellie's hair and they ran away from her. When Dad came in she told him about not doing their hair and when he got done with the seat of their pants, they let Hallie wash their hair from then on and were good girls.\n\nThe time Grace was to kill the old red rooster, she hit him in the head about three times and had left him on the brush pile down at the end of the lane for dead. The next morning while Dad was milking here came the old red rooster crowing and strutting into the chicken yard. So Grace was always teased about the rooster and his three lives.\n\nThe time the rat ran over Mother's foot. They were all in bed when the rat got into the kitchen and Mother went to see where he got in and as she went into the kitchen, the rat ran over her foot. She ran to the bedroom and as she went into the bedroom, he ran over her feet again. She then jumped into the bed and the bed broke and fell on her and Dad. Her yelling woke everybody in the house so we were all up for a while.\n\nAnother time in the winter, our old swinging box where we kept the jellies and jam, was in the cellar. The wires gave away and it fell with a loud crash. It was about midnight and a school teacher by the name of Garfield Marker, who boarded with us, and all the family rushed to see what had happened. Mother was about sick over the loss of all that work and food lost.\n\nThe good times we had loading up the farm wagon with fresh hay, hitching up the team and going to Church on Sunday eve. It was full of young people and we would sing all the way there and back. The people at New Trenton could hear us coming for miles and would say \"here comes the Chappelow Ridge Gang\". They knew there was a lot of fun to be had when we got there as there was from fifteen to thirty of us.\n\nThere was a time when Mother was down sick and couldn't move from side to side, when Esther and Nellie were about six months old. Ruth, Marie and Hallie helped Dad care for her and our day's work was: bake six to eight big loaves of bread, churn, wash, iron, have three big meals each day, milk in the morning and evening, care for the babies, care for Mother and have Dad move her whenever he was near for she weighed nearly 200 lbs. She had rheumatism and could not move even her hands. We had eight to ten big lines full of clothes and washed on an old wooden washer that pushed back and forth and a washboard, too.\n\nRuth E. Kolb Reagan, March 27, 1956.\n\nUpdated 6/93:\n\nThe old crossroad that went over Brunnel Hill is now a dead end, no longer continuing over the hill.\n\nWill's granddaughter, Dora, was living with Nellie at the same time her Grandpa was there, remembers her Grandpa teaching her to drive his old car. Another grandchild, Charles, lived with him on the home place for a short time after Charles' mother died. Helen, another grandchild, recalls that when there were lots of kids at Grandma's, they ate their dinner sitting on the stairs leading upstairs. She also remembers Grandma cooking enough doughnuts to fill a washtub, and sending kids and washtub of doughnuts to the barn for a day of play. The grandkids loved to pump the old player piano until Grandma would \"suggest\" they all go outside to play. Grandpa always got up early, worked hard to have all the farm work done by 4 or 5 in the afternoon. They would eat an early supper and then have the evening to do other enjoyable things. Grandpa Kolb made good blackberry wine. He probably made other wines as his \"receipts\" are still in the family. He had some pear trees along the driveway that Jim Howard remembers well. He tells about going to Grandpa Kolb's and picking pears, lots of pears. They had the old \"sugar\" pears, so tasty and sweet to eat fresh. Apparently many of Will and Myrtie's relatives enjoyed visiting with them.\n\nHazel L.

She continued the line through Frank Barber. The following is the statement she wrote concerning the purpose of her effort: \"My purpose in producing the ensuing pages, relating to the Barbers are as follows. To keep up the Family History that Orrin E. Walker of 1525 Ellsworth Street, Gary, Indiana, who passed away leaving the Barber History he wrote up to the date of January 2, 1930. He was a nephew of Frank Barber, Sr. And now, Frank and Ella Barber's oldest granddaughter (a twin), Ruth Eloise Kolb Reagan of 126 N. Ironwood Drive, Mishawaka, Indiana, has begun the job where Orrin E. Walker left off, and so it is her hopes and wishes to keep on adding chapters to this Barber History, as long as she receives the dates and names of each family that's named in the history.\n\nShe will send copies to each of the (4) Barber children, Ina, Bertie, Frank and Myrtie. So if anybody has any information to add to this record, they can always write Ruth and it will be sent to each of the (4) families. However, I submit the following pages and trust that you will excuse the typing of these articles which I am free to admit is not of the best of writing, so please forgive me and I will try to do better. This record is up to this date, February 14, 1957, and she will continue to add to these dates and chapters in the history as the ones whose families send her the information they'd like to have added to that Family History and the pages are so that new pages can be added to this book. It is her hopes and wishes that she can keep this History up for a long time to come. There are several records that are not complete as of this date, as she did not have all of them in her possession; the dates, names, places and she was anxious to get two copies done so they could be sent to her two aunts. As they both are kept in their homes, close, this winter and she knew it would be enjoyable to them to go through the history when the snow is falling so softly as it is this February 14, 1957.\n\nSo God Bless and With Love and Best Wishes.\n\nRuth Eloise Kolb Reagan \"\n\nFebruary 1989, per Edna Richardson: Wendell developed lung cancer and had a lung removed in 1968.

There were in an old Ford car about 4 miles west of Brookville, Ind. and Stanley was learning to drive and Herbert had passed his driving permit and was meeting another car, when Herbert went to bring the rifle into the car as he was holding the gun on the outside of car and had it on safety. But by bringing the gun inside he bumped the gun and it went off. Herbert's leg was a blood clot from above the knee to the bottom of his foot. It would hemorrhage every time he would be moved and he died of a blood clot of the heart and he looked up and had a sweet smile on his face. And said to all those who was giving him loving care and was in there duty of going to open up the bullet wound and see what more they could do to help his recovery. So before he was put asleep, he said very sweet, low voice \"Pray for me\". It was in moving him that some of the blood clot of the leg moved and struck his heart.\"\n\nMore About Herbert Lowell SMITH:\n\nBurial: Aug 1941, Maple Grove Cem, Brookville, Franklin Co, IN\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3.Marie Carol2 KOLB (William Edward1) was born 14 Jun 1903 in Logan Twp, Dearborn Co, IN, and died 12 Jul 1941 in Cincinnati, Hamilton Co, OH. She married William Blackburn KRAUS 28 Nov 1923 in Dearborn Co, IN. He was born 11 Sep 1902 in New Trenton, Franklin Co, IN, and died 12 May 1960 in Whitewater Twp, Franklin Co, IN.\n\nMore About Marie Carol KOLB:\n\nBurial: 15 Jul 1941, Maple Grove Cem, Brookville, Franklin Co, IN\n\nMore About William Blackburn KRAUS:\n\nBurial: Maple Grove Cem, Brookville, Franklin Co, IN\n\nMarriage Notes for Marie KOLB and William KRAUS:\n\nBill was born in the brick house on the north edge of New Trenton, Indiana. Rufs later rented this house from Bill's father, George. At the present time (1992) this house is owned by Hawkins and they operate an antique shop on the premises. Bill was raised on his parents' farm west of New Trenton on Lenmary Road. He was the fourth child and the second son in a family of four boys and three girls. He helped his parents and brothers on the farm, raising cattle, shipping milk to market, raising crops, both to keep (hay, corn, wheat, etc.) and to sell at market, such as beans, melons, tomatoes, potatoes and tobacco as a cash crop. The work was long and tedious. Bill must have been quite handy as a carpenter since his sister, Margaret, says that he built the barns and outbuildings on his parent's farm.\n\nMarie was born in the home of Will's parents on Logan Creek. She was a twin to Ruth. Her parents moved to a house on U.S. 52 for a couple of years and then purchased a farm on Chappelow Ridge where Marie grew up. She and Bill were married at home in DearbornCounty.\n\nBill and Marie moved into a tenant house north of Bill's parents' farm on Lenmary Road. Here the first six children were born. The old tenant house was torn down in November 1932 and by the middle of January 1933 Bill had built a new one on the same site. While he was building the new house, the family lived with Marie's grandparents, Frank and Ella Barber on Barber Road in DearbornCounty.\n\nThe new house was two stories with kitchen and living room downstairs and bedrooms upstairs. It had unique stairs that could be used from either the kitchen or the living room to reach the second floor. This house was later occupied by Bill's brother, Kenneth, and his family. Later Kenneth Kraus, Jr. occupied the house until his death in 1989.\n\nIt was in this house that Bill & Marie's daughter, Bernice, contracted pneumonia and died in December 1934. Soon after, in 1935, the family moved to the Blackburn place (Wm. Blackburn's farm) on St. Peter's Road. It was west of the one-room schoolhouse near the intersection of Barber and St. Peter's Roads. This house was rented from Hans Singer. It sat right up against a bank so closely that the kitchen was half buried in the bank. The kitchen was a dark place. The kids used to climb onto the kitchen roof from the bank. They also explored the nearby creek and discovered bones protruding from the creek banks. They were told they were Indian bones. The barn was across the road and on one occasion proved almost fatal to George who had run across the road in front of a truck, which killed the dog following him.\n\nEarly in 1936, they moved onto a farm on Peppertown Road between New Trenton and Rockdale in WhitewaterTownship, Franklin County, Indiana. This farm was originally Bower's Nursery.\n\nBill's father owned the farm and it was part of his estate. Bill bought it from his mother, sisters and brothers. Originally the road to the house was from Grabill Road, off of US 52, between New Trenton and Braysville (US 46). This road is now called Wesling Road. This was the only way to the farm at that time. Soon after moving there, Bill, his son Bob, and a neighbor, laid rock from their houses north to the road between Rockdale and New Trenton. In later years the road to Grabill was no longer used, except for the lower end where it comes out on US 52. It was on this farm that the last two children were born.\n\nThe house was a tenant house, weathered frame consisting of a kitchen and living room on the first floor and two bedrooms on the second. The basement was rock walled, with a dirt floor. In later years, Bill cemented the basement, including a drain all around the wall because water would often seep into the basement. There was no plumbing, no electricity, no telephone and not much protection from the heat and cold. Just a kitchen range and a heatrola in the living room. Ventilator holes in the floor of the upstairs rooms let in heat from below. Near the south east corner of the house was a cistern with a chain pump on top that we had to crank around to pump up the water. Near the cistern stood a big elm tree and under it was the well. Sometimes the water would be there and sometimes the current would move off and the well would be dry. There was on old suction pump on top.\n\nOn the south side of the lane between the house and the barn stood a wheat bin & shed. Some distance east of the shed was a bank barn, i.e. the lower level was below ground for protection from the weather, and the upper level was used for storage of loose hay and perhaps some machinery in the back under a small loft. A large trap door was opened to toss hay to the cattle feeding area below. A small trap door beside it opened to the floor below. Boards nailed on a barn support post was used to as a ladder to traverse between the two floors.\n\nBill built a milk house close to the barn where milk was filtered through a strainer and then placed in milk cans for shipment to a processing plant. The milk cans came in 5 and 10 gallon sizes. Cream cans were smaller. The milk house had a concrete floor and felt cool.\n\nThere were lots of fruit trees and various odd shrubbery left from the old nursery days. Even in 1988 there were a few of the old pear and apple trees still standing in the pasture. At one time there were also quince and pear trees near the house. Marie planted a row of peach trees beside the garden, close to the house. She had canned peaches and saved the peach pits to plant to have her own trees.\n\nNext to the peach trees was a bed of asparagus. They would pour the salt water from the ice cream freezer onto the asparagus bed to keep out the weeds. Never did faze the asparagus! Bill raised \"truck\" on the farm, meaning lots and lots of farm produce that he and his brother, Ken, would take to market, mainly in Hamilton, Ohio. They raised almost everything and what did not sell, Marie would can for the family to eat during the winter. They also raised their own cattle, hogs and chickens. All had to be canned to be kept for future eating. No freezer in those days, just a big old ice box. Hams, sausage and bacon could be smoked, but beef had to be canned.\n\nAfter Marie died, Bill and the five youngest children continued to live here until Bill married the second time to Bernice (Chappell) Perrin. They were married on June 21, 1943. Their marriage was not the best and on several occasions petitions were filed for divorce but the differences were smoothed over temporarily. Bernice received a small insurance check for her two underage children so she would have spare cash to catch a bus to Goshen, Indiana where her son and daughter lived. On one occasion the kids hid her suitcases to keep her from leaving but received such a bawling out that they never repeated it. Bernice hated the farm. In June 1944, Bill was placed under the guardianship of Forrest Seeley because of his problem with alcohol. At the same time Bernice issued a restraining order against him. About the first of January 1945, Bernice left with her two sons for Goshen, where she stayed with her daughter. Soon thereafter, Bill followed her to Goshen, leaving his family on the farm. By April 1945, things had deteriorated to the point where the four youngest children were placed in foster homes. In July 1945, the farm stock was sold and the personal home goods such as linens and canned goods were divided among the children. The furniture stayed in the house. The farm was rented from that time until Bill's daughter, Helen purchased it in February 1949.\n\nBill, unfortunately, had a difficult time with alcohol and it caused tremendous heartache within the family. His father was prone to taking home brew (beer) to the fields for them all to drink. The early drinking habit lead to serious problems in later years. Alcohol caused a change in his usual demeanor, bringing out the worst and meanest of attitudes. He was placed under the guardianship of a neighbor and his children were eventually placed in foster homes. Helen had married Earle Smith and was living with Earle's parents, Andy and Edna Smith. George had stayed on the farm until it was rented then joined the navy. Charles first lived with his Aunt Grace & Uncle Nute Johnson in Bright until a new baby in their family created too much work for Aunt Grace. Charles then moved in with his Grandpa Kolb and stayed until he sold the farm in February 1946. Grandpa Kolb moved in with Nellie & Edwin Barth and Charles stayed with Edwin's brother, Butch Barth. Dora stayed with her Aunt Nellie and Uncle Edwin Barth until she married Don Wilson. Hazel went first to her Aunt Tommie and Uncle Harry Kolb's, then to her Aunt Hallie Kramer's, then to Mrs. Ludie Brown (the grandmother of classmate Louanna Seeley). Ervin \"Pete\" stayed with Forrest \"Pood\" and Jerry Seeley until Helen and Earle rented the Piatt house on Seeley Road. Pete stayed with them until about the fall of 1948 when he went to Goshen to live with his Dad.\n\nCharles joined the U.S. Navy in the fall of 1946. George had already joined the Navy. Earle came home from the Marines and he and Helen rented Piatt's house. Both Charles and George called Helen and Earle's place \"home\" and stayed there when they came home on leave. George stayed in the Navy two years and lived with Helen for a while after he was discharged.\n\nBy 1949, Helen had also taken in Hazel, and a couple of years later, Ervin came back to stay with her. She was a substitute mother and provided a home for all of her brothers and sisters. Her determination and will to have all of them together again as a family has kept the family close and forever grateful for a sister who cared enough to take them in.\n\nBill followed Bernice to Goshen, Indiana, abandoning family and farm. They moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where Bill worked in the maintenance department of the University of Michigan until Christmas 1945. Then they moved back to Goshen and rented an apartment. Bill worked in a laundry.\n\nBill's mother died in August 1945 and when her estate was settled in 1948, he purchased an agreement to run a furnace business and bought a house on Wilkerson Street in Goshen, IN. Early in 1952, Bill relinquished his share of the business and sold the house in Goshen. They bought a mobile home and moved it to Corning, Arkansas, where they remained until the Don and Ron finished their school year. Then they moved to Haynes City, Florida for the summer and six weeks into the fall, before returning to Corning, Arkansas where they finally stayed put.\n\nBill and Bernice lived in their mobile home in Corning. He liked the winters in Corning but in the spring he wanted to return to Indiana. He had lost his license to drive in Indiana, so every time he wanted to spend the summer with Helen and Earle, someone would have to drive to the state line in southwestern Indiana and pick him up, driving his pickup to Helen's. He liked to put in a garden every spring at Helen's and putter around on the farm. He helped them remodel the old farmhouse, expanding it from four rooms to seven rooms and a bath.\n\nIt was while he was staying with Helen and Earle, that he died in the night, apparently of a heart attack after climbing the stairs to go to bed. As far as we know he had nothing of importance and what he did have Bernice was entitled to, except for his International truck which was driven to Indiana that last trip. Helen and Pete bought the truck. Pete drove it for years before parking it for the last time in Helen's garage.\n\nSources: Helen, Charles, Dora, Hazel, Ervin Kraus, and Ronald Perrin (1995).\n\nChildren of Marie KOLB and William KRAUS are:\n\n+ 12 i.

S. 52 near Braysville, Indiana (HarrisonTownship, DearbornCounty). About two years later Hallie's parents moved to their farm on Chappelow Ridge (Logan Twp., Dearborn Co, Indiana).\n\nHallie and Henry lived on the old Theodore Kremer homestead (on Barber Road, Logan Twp., Dearborn Co, IN) all their lives. Hallie and the children still live there at the present time. Henry and Hallie ran a dairy farm and raised their children until Henry's death, September 9, 1940. Then Hallie and the children and their uncle, Carl Kremer, are still running the dairy and taking care of the farm.\n\nThe house that Hallie lives in is over 100 years old, or near that age. It is made of flat stone and is built on a very steep hillside. The WhitewaterRiver runs in front of the house and there is a road running along the edge of the river from New Trenton to what was called Longnecker Station, where Indiana State Route 46 joins U.S. 52.

He married Martha Jean STAUFFER 21 Jun 1946 in Indianapolis, Marion Co, IN. She was born 20 Jul 1924 in Union City, Randolph Co, IN.\n\nMarriage Notes for Robert KRAUSE and Martha STAUFFER:\n\nBob was born in the tenant house on George Kraus' farm on Lenmary Road, west of New Trenton. He attended the first six grades of school at SpringfieldGrade School and the last six years at Whitewater. He enlisted in the U. S. Marines. He was wounded on the island of Iwo Jima, losing the two middle fingers on his left hand. He was sent to the VA Hospital in Farragutt, Idaho.\n\nJean was raised in Union City, Indiana. Her grandparents were William Stauffer & Dora McKibben, and Zoma Woodson Fear & Maryellen Petty. She was married to James Paul Gill and had two children, Sherry and Marilyn. Bob and Paul were in the service together. After Paul's death, Bob married Jean. Bob planned to adopt Sherry and Marilyn but realized they would lose many benefits for educations, etc. as a result of their father's death if he did so.\n\nJean and Bob lived in Indianapolis, Indiana until 1949 when they moved to Ft. Worth, Texas. Bob worked on upholstering and wiring jobs until he started as a rep for Lone Star Gas Company. He also worked for Reliable Life Insurance Co. As part of his job he was installing air conditioning units for large equipment. Thinking he could do that himself, he started his own business, Consolidated Air Conditioning Co, manufacturing commercial units for installation in large equipment and fleets. He provided specialty services to customers unable to find sources for their particular needs. Bob provided jobs for several family members and often helped those in need. His faith in others and generous nature was his undoing when one took advantage of him and left his business bankrupt.\n\nBob and Jean lived at 3017 Burchill Road in Ft.Worth for many years, until the neighborhood deteriorated and they was face-to-face with a night-time burglar. They moved to 7636 Beckwood Drive, renting a lovely brick home.\n\nBob was a member of Hemphill Heights Masonic Lodge No. 1164 and Fort Worth Chapter 681, Order of Eastern Star. Jean is a member of Eastern Star and served as Worthy Matron. Both were members of the BurchillRoadBaptistChurch. After moving to Arlington, Texas, they became members of TateSpringsBaptistChurch.\n\nBob had a malignant tumor removed from his colon in 1982 and had recovered completely. Then in the spring of 1988, he had a heart attack and the doctors discovered that he had had two other attacks previously. He had been told about ten years before that he had diabetes which could be controlled by diet which he often disregarded. While recuperating from the heart attack, he got an infection in his large toe on his right foot. He put off doing anything about it until he had wrapped up some business affairs. But by then, gangrene had set in and his toe had to be removed. He was to come home from the hospital just before Labor Day but they found a blood clot in his leg and he had to stay until they dissolved it. Then the circulation in the rest of his toes on his right foot began to deteriorate and they wanted to amputate those.\n\nBob wanted to come home in the worst way and finally talked them into letting him go home for a few days before the operation. He was in the process of getting dressed to leave when he felt faint and laid back on the bed and passed out. Needless to say, he had to stay. Tests had shown he needed five by-passes. The doctors had been unaware of the seriousness of his heart problems. The next day, a little after noon, he had a fatal heart attack.\n\nMemorial services were held at 9:30 A.M. on Saturday, September 24, 1988 at Greenwood Chapel, Ft. Worth, Texas, by Rev. Charles Clary of TateSpringsBaptistChurch.\n\nJean had the unpleasant work of getting life back together. She moved out of the house and stayed with Steve until she found an apartment close to Robin and Leonard in Arlington. She suffered through some serious back pain before having surgery and spending months recuperating. Thankfully she is okay, watches Jeremy and manages to spend time with others. Jean has always seemed to be a rock in the raging river, calm, and doing what had to be done with a minimum of fuss. A wonderful woman to know.\n\nSometime about 1999, Robin and Leonard moved their membership from TateSpringsBaptistChurch and not long afterwards, Jean moved hers also.\n\nSource: Jean Krause, 1988 & Robin Griffin update, Feb 2002\n\nAbout 2004 Jean bought a house across the street from Robin and Leonard.

She married Earle Andrew SMITH 30 Jul 1943 in Brookville, Franklin Co, IN. He was born 04 Apr 1925 in Whitewater Twp, Franklin Co, IN, and died 10 Jan 2004, Mercy Franciscan Medical Center, Harrison, Hamilton Co, OH.\n\nMore About Earle Andrew SMITH:\n\nBurial: 12 Jan 2004, Maple Grove Cem, Brookville, Franklin Co, IN\n\nMarriage Notes for Helen KRAUS and Earle SMITH:\n\nHelen was born in the house on George Kraus' farm on Lenmary Road, west of New Trenton, Indiana. She graduated from WhitewaterHigh School, Franklin County, Indiana.\n\nEarle was born on the old Case farm, west of New Trenton, Indiana. His parents bought a farm on Rockdale-Trenton Road where they lived the rest of their lives. They had three children, Earle, the oldest, Paul and Gayle. They all graduated from WhitewaterHigh School. Earle's dad's parents were Benjamin Smith and Louise Faber. His mother's parents were Charles Seeley and Kate Linkel.\n\nHelen left home in 1942-43 and lived with Earle's parents while he was in the service. She worked at U. S. Shoe in Harrison, Ohio for a while. She also worked as a time-keeper for a company in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nEarle enlisted in the U. S. Marines and served in the Pacific, and fought on the islands of Tinian and Saipan. He was in communications. After he was discharged, they rented the Piatt house on Seeley Road, near WhitewaterSchool. In 1949, they bought and moved onto the farm owned by Helen's father, William Kraus. Earle and Helen have provided a home for almost all of Helen's brothers and sisters. First George, then Charles called their house \"home\". In 1949, Hazel came to live with them and in a year or so, Pete came. George had married and Charles was in the Navy by that time but it still made for a house full since Helen and Earle had three of their own in a two bedroom house! But they put up with all the inconveniences and managed to raise all five.\n\nEarle was employed by Rex Manufacturing Company in Connersville, Indiana, where they made Philco appliances. He worked in the stock room. Later the company was bought by Ford Motor Company and Earle continued to work for them until he retired after 45 years.\n\nEarle and Helen still work the farm of 120 acres. At first they raised chickens, pigs, and milked cows. Besides raising corn, oats and hay, they put out a tobacco crop every year. Helen always had a big garden and canned or froze enough for winter use. There was always plenty of work to be done. In later years, they no longer raised or kept any chickens and finally they quit raising hogs. The dairy cows went and were replaced by beef cattle. Even though the animals are not as much work, they still require daily attention and they still put in corn, oats and cut hay.\n\nThey have made many improvements to the old place. The farm originally had a four room frame house, a grain shed, a milk house, a brooder (for raising baby chicks), and a chicken house attached to the bigger barn. About 1958, with the help of Helen's dad, they added on to the old house. Originally, there was a concrete porch outside the north kitchen door and a footer poured from that to the end of the house outside the living room which was used as a flower bed. On the south side of the kitchen was another porch. They expanded over the north porch and flower bed, creating a bedroom and bath downstairs and doubling the size of the living room. Over the expanded living room they built another bedroom, giving them three bedrooms upstairs and one down. The south porch was enclosed and became a family room. The east side of the house had a sheltered outside basement entrance. They extended the south porch around the east side to include the basement entrance and enclosed the whole thing. This became a place to change from outdoor clothes, enter the basement and still had room for two freezers.\n\nThey eventually tore down the old grain shed. They built a long garage along the lane. The old milk house, barn and attached chicken house are still there. But they have added a loafing shed for the cattle and another long storage shed on the ridge below the barn. The old brooder house has become a place to store things. Behind the garage between the two hollows is a large pond. The former calf pasture between the house and the road was made into a lawn and the old locust trees were removed from the pasture between the pond and the road, adding all that to the yard. The huge old maple trees lining the lane eventually died out, as did the pear trees on the opposite side of the lane. It has taken many years of constant labor to change it all.\n\nA few years after all the kids were married, Helen went to work as a cook at Mt. Carmel Elementary School and eventually retired from there, but still subs on occasion for someone who is off work.\n\nHelen and Earle have always taken an interest in school affairs, attending ball games and most functions. They have a wide circle of friends and had a ball celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary in their own spacious yard with gobs of relatives and friends socializing under the tents.\n\nHelen and Earle belonged to the MethodistChurch in New Trenton for many years until the conference began to control much of the church's affairs and finally merged Rockdale and New Trenton. They changed churches and became members of the Church of Christ in Harrison.\n\nEarle had survived colon cancer and the removal of a hammer toe on his right foot. He had recuperated and was able to help Helen with the cattle, mending fences, and putting in crops. On Saturday, January 10th, 2004, Earle had driven the tractor to his neighbor's, Estill Ball, and was driving out Estill's lane.... except he didn't turn onto the road but drove right across the road into his own field across from Estill's. Estill noticed that the tractor had made a circle and was stopped by a tree, with Earle bent over the wheel. He ran over to the tractor and shut it off. He called the Life Squad and they rushed Earle to the FranciscanMedCenter in Harrison, where he died a short time later that afternoon of a brain aneurysm.\n\nObit, Harrison Press, 14 Jan 2004:\n\nFuneral service for EARL ANDREW SMITH, 78, West Harrison, Ind, is Wed, Jan 14, 2004, John C. Brater Funeral Home, Harrison. Visitation was Tuesday in the funeral home. Burial and graveside military service by Harrison American Legion funeral detail is in Maple GroveCemetery, Brookville, Ind.\n\nMr. Smith, a farmer and retired employee of Ford Motor Co, died Saturday, Jan. 10, 2004 in Mercy Franciscan MediCenter, Harrison.\n\nHe is survived by his spouse, Helen Kraus Smith; children, George (Pat) Smith, Donna (Ronald) Denham; and Delores (Charles) Mosier; 11 grandchildren; sister, Gayle Warders; and 7 gr-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his brother, Paul Smith; and parents, Andrew and Edna Seeley Smith.\n\nMemorial contributions may be directed to Harrison Church of Christ or cancer research through the funeral home.\n\nHelen seemed so out of touch, sometimes staring into space, or completely losing track of the conversation. Some of us attributed it to the sudden loss of Earle but apparently her memory loss had been going on for some time. That summer of 2004, she seemed to be even more confused and could not remember things. After Thanksgiving, she thought she had a mini-stroke that affected her eye. That led to innumerable tests and Dr. visits. In March 2005, she developed jaundice. She had pancreatic cancer that was removed in April. She also had moderate Alzheimer's. She deteriorated over the summer until a CT scan showed the cancer had spread. She went into MercyFranciscanWesternHillsHospital on Wed, Sept 14th. They moved her into the Hospice wing where she died at 7:30 a.m., Wednesday, Sept 21st.\n\nSad days.... and the \"home place\" will never be the same.......\n\nObit, Harrison Press, Sept 29, 2005:\n\nHELEN A.

He married Barbara Joy EDWARDS 22 Jun 1950 in Miamitown, Hamilton Co, OH. She was born 10 Feb 1932 in Cleves, Hamilton Co, OH.\n\nMarriage Notes for George KRAUSE and Barbara EDWARDS:\n\nGeorge, always called \"Yats\", was born in the tenant house on George Kraus' farm on Lenmary Road, west of New Trenton, Indiana. When he was eight, his parents moved to the farm on Bower-Peppertown Road in FranklinCounty. While yet in high school, Yats joined the U. S. Navy and served from May 1946 until 1948. After he was discharged, he was employed as a dozer operator by his Uncle Alfred Krause, in Brookville, Indiana. In the winter of 1949 and 1950 Yats worked for his father who had a furnace business in Goshen, Indiana. He then worked for a time for Walter Schunk Excavating in Miamitown, Ohio. Yats left that job and started his own excavating business. He eventually acquired equipment to drill holes for piers used in the construction of buildings and highways. He and Charles formed a partnership after Charles left the Navy.\n\nIn 1963 the families of both Yats and Charles Krause moved to Cortez, Colorado where they lived for a year. Yats and Charlie worked on a government job drilling the holes for power line towers. The power line started at Shiprock, NM and went to Page, AZ. From Page, AZ it went to Phoenix, AZ. Yats and Charlie traveled back and forth daily to the job site by a twin engine plane which George piloted. They moved back to Ohio in 1964. Yats and Charlie then went into business with Contractor Service. After George died on July 6, 1965, the business was sold to a company in Columbus, Ohio. Charlie and his family moved to Columbus, Ohio, so that he could continue to work for that company.\n\nBarbara grew up on her parents' place at the top of Miamitown Hill, just west of Miamitown on U. S. 52. Barbara's parents owned and operated tourist cabins and a nursery. Barbara attended MiamitownGrade School and graduated from HarrisonHigh School in 1950. In the early 1950's she worked in the Cheviot Dime Store and at the Cincinnati Post Office. Barb and Yats built their first home near her parents home on U. S. 52. They sold this house and rented a place on Hamilton-Cleves Pike in Miamitown. They bought a new house in 1955 just a few doors north of that. It was a split level brick home onto which they later added an office and extra garage. It served as home until 1965 when they moved into a large Bedford stone house on West Road.\n\nThey were in the process of buying the house on West Road and selling their old house when Yats died. They had not signed the final papers, so Barbara moved back into their home on Hamilton-Cleves Pike.\n\nBarbara had to raise three children by herself. She did remarry later but neither subsequent marriage was permanent. As the kids grew up, Barb went to work as a seasonal employee at IRS and eventually became a full time employee. The winters were especially depressing to her and driving in the miserable rain, snow and sleet only reinforced her desire to head for sunny Florida. She had spent a lot of time there over the years and was anxious to retire there. She eventually sold the house and moved into an apartment across the road where she lived until retiring in February 1994. After an exploratory trip to Florida she decided to move. Putting some things in storage, selling others and taking the rest, she moved into an apartment on Albee Rd near NokomisBeach in January 1995. In a year, however, she moved into a mobile home at Palm & Pines MH Park at 255 Tamiami Trail, Nokomis, Fl, where she now lives.\n\nBarbara was married the 2nd time to Clifford Sexton on May 10, 1968 and they were divorced February 9, 1970. Barbara married the 3rd time to Douglas Eugene Snow on October 14, 1977. That marriage also ended in divorce on April 30, 1986.\n\nSource: Barbara Krause, updated 10-27-2001\n\nBarbara graduated from Wm Henry Harrison High School, Harrison, Ohio in 1950.

He was seven when his parents moved to the farm on Bower-Peppertown Road in FranklinCounty. Charlie attended WhitewaterSchool until placed in a foster home about 1944. Some time during this period he stayed a short time with his Aunt Frances & Uncle Kenneth Kraus, but he cannot recall when that was. He stayed first with his Aunt Grace & Uncle Nute in Bright, Indiana until they had another baby (April 1945?) and the extra work was too much for Aunt Grace. Charlie moved in with his Grandpa Kolb until he sold the farm in February, 1946. Grandpa Kolb moved in with Nellie & Edwin Barth and Charlie stayed with Edwin's brother, Butch. Charlie had attended BrightSchool those years and in order to finish the year at Bright he moved in with Butch and walked to where he could catch the bus to Bright. After a short stay with Butch Barth, he left and spent the next year living with his Dad in Goshen, Indiana. He worked in the laundry where his Dad worked. He joined the U. S. Navy in September 1947 where he served nine years. He attained the rank of Chief Petty Officer. He was an aircraft mechanic on aircraft carriers. While in the Navy he finished his high school education.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy in September 1956, he became a partner with his brother, George, in the pier drilling business.
