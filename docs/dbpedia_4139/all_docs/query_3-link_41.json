Richard Shenkel, Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Supervisor of Archaeology at the University of New Orleans, from R. Collins Vallee, John Hammond, J. Ross Vincent, Dr. Sherwood Gagliano .and Mrs. Bethlyn McCloskey. Dr. Shenkel donated his time and resources to the City and prepared the Archaeological Sites Section of this report. The Planning Commission also wishes to thank all those agencies, organizations and individuals providing comments and advice in connection with this report. I/���i PREFACE This report was prepared to present to the City of New Orleans for its consideration, with'the initial means by which to control land uses and environmental quality within viable marsh estuary areas. Through implementation, this plan should allow the City of New Orleans to attain the following goals: 1) The maintenance of a high level of quality within estuary areas in particular and within the City of New Orleans in general; 2) the formulation of land use policiesand techniques appro- priate to marsh-estuary areas; 3) the formulation of a means by which energy resources may be exploited without adversely impacting environ- mental quality; 4) the provision of adequate open space and recreational areas for the benefit of the citizens of the New Orleans Metropolitan area, and the State of Louisiana; 5) to protect for perpetuity, the economic and ecologic re- sources represented by the natural environment; 6) the efficient utilization of existing governmental agencies, in a coordinated fashion, in the management of sensitive environmental areas; and, 7) the establishment of land use guidelines and priorities in estuary areas. In order to receive as much input as possible from govern- mental agencies, civic groups, and the general public, this plan is being circulated to the agencies and organizations listed below and is available to the general public upon request; and prior to official adoption of this plan, at least one public hearing will be held.

As indicated earlier, the New Orleans' area has always ! / Ga. .' been port oriented in terms of a major economy base. Presently, ,Miss. the port is second in the U.

Other economic generators in New Orleans are shipbuilding, : ck:son mining, and the oil industry. }3tnking,mlanufacturing, and con- struction are also vital contributors to the areawide economy. IMany of the aforementioned industries are either directly.. Fla or indirectly related to the fact that New Orleans is within the , H 0usonV coastal zone. The seafood industry, however, not only depends NEWOR B E N on being within the coastal zone but also depends upon the health .. of the coastal zone. ironically, the seafood industry (with its strong economic link to tourism) is probably the most difficult to document. Equally difficult to documern is the recreational value of coastal shores, lakes, islands and marshlands. In- ex creased yearly Loan registl-arions signify that the demand for these resources is growing. On the other hand, tourists seeking . mi water relared recreation have little or no opportunities other than the passive and strongly promoted river and bayou cruises. Therefore, the potential exists for increasing tourism through the expansion of water-related activities. LOCATION OF NEW ORLEANS The steady growth of the New Orleans area seems to indicate that there are additional benefits of living in the Coastal Zone. Of particular interest, though difficult to define, is the personal aesthetic value. The ability to experience a sub-tropical climate, participate in and view outdoor sports year-round, to enjoy out- door cultural activities, festivals, 'celebrations, coastal scenery and wildlife and values of the Coastal Zone which surely balance or perhaps outweigh the adversities associated with Coastal Zone li vlng. rt' I> 4 * 4 I I I I I I I I I I Geologic History New Orleans is located in the lower Mississippi River basin, an area containing a large number of marsh-estuary systems. The principal marsh-estuary system in which New Orleans lies is the Maurepas-Pontchartrain-Borgne System;:the second most ..> productive estuary s$ystem in Louisiana. ,> The geologic setting of the city is the Gulf Coast Region which physiographically, is a part of the continental coastal \"-' , � .r.. \" plain which extends generally from Massachusetts to Tampico, \" :-: > Mexico. The average width of the coastal plain is 250 miles, , , but the Mississippi embayment extends inland some 575 miles z j from the Delta to Cairo, Illinois (Coastal Environment, Inc., A(a i 1972). o I ; The coastal plain was formed over a period of at least 200 ' - million years and is the result of an interaction of several geo- logic processes including changes in sea levels, fluvial, lacus- ' trine and marine deposition, and location on the continental mar- '\\' ' ?- . grin. Extensive dowdwarping has occurred in the Gulf Coast Plain s Fl\" ,* o A ;: / . as a result of tectonic movements of the crustal plates and sedi- N i rment deposition. ; River borne sediments consisting of sand, silt, and clay V v have been deposited into the sea resulting in a gradual deltaic - buildup which has slowly encroached seaward from relatively f f B . high ground and extended out\\ard toward the margins of the MilKl 50 continental shelf. Coastal Louisiana and New Orleans are sit- B. gVI ' uated upon this wedge of sediment. Sediments have, in conjunc- tion with tectonic movements, forced a downwarping of the Meso- ' zoic Basement complex. This Gulf Coast geosyncline passes . * through the Louisiana Gulf Coast, directly under the New Orleans area. Associated with the geosyncline are zones of active faulting I \"- - ;. .-:- resulting from the pressure exerted by the weights of the sedi- OR iAIS ment deposits. c i' Both faulting and subsidence occurred contemporaneously with depositional processes. Deep seated beds of salt, related to an ancient Jurassic sea, and thick marine shale units have been deformed by differential loading pressures causing additional movements. These movements often initiate zones of weakness MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL PLAIN BELOW which persist as sediment continues to accumulate above them producing growth faults.

Faults along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and underlying the lake itself are related to the regional pattern of normal growth faulting. Surface displacement of relatively modern surface features, such as beach ridges and old meander scars of streams in the area north of Lake Pontchartrain attest to the fact that some of these faults have been active within late Quaternary items (probably within the last 5, 000 years). Maximum surface displacement is found along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain where eighteen feet of surface displacement can be documented.

These estuarines support a large variety of flora and fauna, represent potential water oriented recreational sites, are ideal for. he development of research facilities and contain significant atrchaeological sires. In addition to the critical areas, there is a semi-critical area, or area of secondary importance. The semi-critical area constitutes the Chef-.Rigolets Marsh Unit.
