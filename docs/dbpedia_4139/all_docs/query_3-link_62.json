Latrobe dismissed the idea until President Thomas Jefferson mentioned the subject to Latrobe when both men were attending the trial of Aaron Burr in Richmond in August 1807. Latrobe had previously received a contract to build a Custom House in New Orleans for the federal government, for which he had sent his friend Robert Alexander to oversee construction. Latrobe corresponded with Territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne about securing a corporate charter from the territorial legislature, which Latrobe estimated would \"furnish water to two thousand houses at twenty dollars each per year.\" Alexander's efforts to secure such a charter were unsuccessful due to opposition from French interests. In the meantime the City of New Orleans granted a water franchise to Louis Gleise in May 1810. Gleise is said by several historians as having built a system, but his 1810 franchise became invalid if his system was not completed within one year, and the city awarded an exclusive franchise to Benjamin Latrobe in May 1811.\n\nLatrobe sent his son Henry to New Orleans in late 1810 to secure a franchise from that city. Henry, who was fluent in French, was successful in securing a franchise in April, 1811, which anticipated a steam-powered pumping station sited on a vacant lot adjacent to Latrobe's Custom House, defined by Bienville, Custom House, and Levee streets and the high road. The federal government proved to own the property and Congress would not consider transferring it. Henry returned to New Orleans in February, 1812 and secured a lot bounded by Ursuline, St. Phillips, and Levee streets. He received bids for construction of the building on March 20, 1812 The building would house a steam engine to pump water from the Mississippi river into six elevated wooden casks, whose capacity is not known. He and his father spent several years and made some progress, but Henry died of yellow fever in 1817, after which Latrobe went to New Orleans, where he also died of yellow fever on September 3, 1820.\n\nNew Orleans Water Works design, 1812. Designer: Benjamin Latrobe. Construction Supervisor: Henry Latrobe. Credit: Detail from 'Plan of the City and Suburbs of New Orleans' by I. Tanesse, William Rollinson, Charles Del Vecchio and P. Maspero (1815) Top: Plan drawing for the new vegetable market, showing the final waterworks location.\n\nBottom: Detail from Map of New Orleans Waterworks, by Henry Latrobe (ca. 1811) from The Engineering Drawings of Benjamin Henry Latrobe (1980) Page 200.\n\nThe system was seized after Latrobe's death to pay the debts of Latrobe and his waterworks company. It was bought by the city on May 26, 1821 for $10,000, and they sent local engineer Francis B. Ogden and William W. Montgomery, a council member and local merchant, to Philadelphia to buy pipe and other materials to finish the works. The system began working sometime in 1823, but never proved satisfactory. The pumphouse was abandoned and demolished in 1838 after new water works came on line. The maps below show Latrobe's water works and the 1836 pumping plant and reservoir built by the Commercial Bank of New Orleans.\n\nPlan of the front part of the City of New Orleans in 1818 Section of Lower Garden District waterfront area around Annnunciation Square, from\n\nRobinsons Atlas of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThe Commercial Bank of New Orleans was incorporated by the legislature on April 1, 1833 and given a thirty-five year exclusive right to supply water to the city of New Orleans. The company hired Albert Stein to design and build the works, which began operation on April 28, 1836 by pumping water into a reservoir constructed on a built-up mound. The reservoir held nearly 10 million gallons. The city bought the works on January 19, 1868 for $2 million, of which $500,000 was credited to the city as a stockholder in the company. One wall of the reservoir collapsed on March 31, 1872, flooding the nearby area.\n\nThe city contracted with William Bell in 1841 to build a separate water works system near the original Latrobe plant to provide water for flushing streets. This system was taken out of service in 1852 and the building was converted into a market.\n\nThe city and state explored several opportunities to privatize the water system. The legislature passed a bill incorporating the Crescent City Water Company in February, 1871, giving the company the perpetual and exclusive right to distribute water in the city. The governor did not approve the bill, but the Secretary of State promulgated it anyway by publishing it in a local newspaper. This got him fired, and the governor prevailed in the ensuing dispute. The city passed an ordinance granting a franchise to the City Water Works Company, but nothing came of it. Finally in 1877, the legislature incorporated the New Orleans Water Works Company with a fifty-year exclusive right to supply water, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 9, 1878, the city transferred the water works and franchise to the New Orleans Waterworks Company.\n\nThe city and company fought bitterly over the quality and quantity of water delivered, and city voters approved building new water, sewer and drainage systems on June 6, 1899. The charter and franchise of the New Orleans Water Works Company were revoked effective February 3, 1902, although some stockholders attempted to form the New Orleans Water Supply Company to succeed the defunct entity. The city chose not to purchase the existing water company, and the new system began service in 1909, forcing the old company out of business.\n\nThe waterworks are currently owned by the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans.\n\nReferences\n\n1805 Mayor Mayor James Pitot became the second man to serve in that office. Pitot wrote the City Council on June 29, 1805, noting the need to secure more healthful water since the uncleanliness of the water now being drunk everywhere was daily becoming more unbearable. Pitots suggestion was that the city use flat boat timbers to build a new wharf which the water wagons might use exclusively. No other method of procuring water was mentioned. (Kolb, 2006:51)\n\n1806 Mayor John Watkins is said to have written territorial representative Julien Poydras asking him to contact Latrobe concerning the city's water works. (1970:296) Watkins was mayor from July 27, 1805 to March 8, 1807, while Poydras served as the territory's representative to Congress from March 4, 1809 to March 3, 1811, making this connection more than doubtful. Later historians have nevertheless repeated this tale. (Kolb, 1995:193 and Kolb, 2006:54-55)\n\n1805 or 1806 The idea of supplying the city of New Orleans [with water] was first suggested to me by a French gentleman [probably Poydras] whom I was exhibiting my works in Philadelphia. (1987:383) BHL to Robert Alexander, July 27, 1811. (1951:xvi and BHL 3:117)\n\n1806 Mayor Watkins of New Orleans initiated contact with Latrobe in 1806, and in a letter to Robert Alexander from Washington, July 27, 1811, Latrobe recalled that in 1805 or 1806 a French visitor to the Philadelphia water-works had suggested he construct something similar for New Orleans. (Kolb, 2006:61) The July 27, 1811 letter does not specify any date for this\n\n1809 Latrobe and Robert Alexander petition the territorial legislature for a waterworks franchise at New Orleans (the petition fails).

The steam water-works now erecting under the superintendence of Latrobe, the younger, will, when got into the operation of watering the streets, be of vast importance in cleansing and carrying off the filth of the gutters.\n\n1813 Petition of Benjamin Henry Latrobe to the Mayor and Aldermen of New Orleans, April 23, 1813, Letter written and signed by Henry S. Boneval Latrobe, acting in his father's name. Benjamin H. Latrobe requested a two-year extension, to May 1, 1815 on the completion date for the waterworks system in New Orleans that had been stipulated in his contract with the City in 1811. Unavoidable circumstances had delayed the work. First the United States Congress had opposed granting him title to the lot the City had set aside for the engine house. After work had begun at this site, Congress had awarded him ownership to a different parcel of land. Secondly, when he was about to ship machinery from Baltimore to New Orleans, the outbreak of war between the United States and England disrupted ocean transport. It became necessary for him to move his factory from Washington to Pittsburgh and there to begin anew constructing the steam engine, pumps, and other machinery necessary for the waterworks.\n\n1813 Amendment to ordinance issued by the City Council of New Orleans regarding the contract with Benjamin Henry Latrobe, April 29, 1813. The City Council passed an ordinance to amend Article 2 of its ordinance of 1811, which had granted Benjamin Henry Latrobe the exclusive privilege to furnish water to the city and the faubourgs by means of one or more water pumps. The Council, after having heard Latrobe's request for a two-year extension of the completion date and the explanation for the delays, voted to extend the contract for two years, beginning May 1, 1813.\n\n1814 Plan of the City and Environs of New Orleans, showing \"Latrobe's Water Works\" number 14.\n\n1815 Amendment to ordinance issued by the City Council of New Orleans regarding the contract with Benjamin Henry Latrobe, May 2, 1815. Henry S. Boneval Latrobe, acting for his father, appeared before the City Council and requested an extension of the contract the Council had granted his father by its ordinance of April 29, 1813 to install a waterworks system in the city. Latrobe had been unable to finish the project on account of the recent fighting, which had disrupted the city and forced him to suspend operations at a time when work was already well advanced. The Council accordingly agreed to extend the agreement until August, 1816, on condition that Latrobe put up a bond by which he would guarantee completion of the work in the allotted time.\n\n1815 Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans : from an actual survey made in 1815, by I.

The adoption of this plan would save the city annually a very considerable sum in fuel, &c. It is proper to observe, however, that it would be necessary to raise the water by a steam engine during the lowest stage of the river, as the current then runs very feeble.

While here I saw how the good people of New Orleans procured water. A dozen cars with hogsheads on them were standing with their wheels in the river and the horse on the land, while their drivers were filling them, with large buckets from among the filth falling from the steamboats, and trickling from the shore where the platforms furnished, day and night a most convenient privy - or public rather, for those who had no other and better place of resort for their necessities.\n\nThe water works erected by my father are in operation, and at the corners of the cross streets along the Rue de la Levee, I saw this morning the water bubbling up from the pipes into the large cast iron box around them, and running off in a rapid stream through the gutters, At every corner were crowds of negro women filling their buckets and water carts supplying themselves from a less defiled place than the margin of the river. After my fathers death these works, in an unfinished state, fell into the hands of the corporation, and the mode in which they are at present used, is much less efficient than they were capable of under a proper management.\n\n1835 The American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge, for the year 1836\n\nPages 323-324: New Orleans.

A charter was granted in the year 1833, to a Company invested with banking privileges, entitled \"Commercial Bank of New Orleans.\" The chief object in incorporating this Company was to supply the city of New Orleans with pure water, from the Mississippi river.\n\nImmediately after the passage of this act, a Board of Directors was organized, and a Watering Committee appointed, who determined to commence operations as soon as practicable.\n\nVarious plans were submitted to attain this object, but the Company resolved to engage the services of a person skilled in Hydraulics, before adopting any plan. In this State, the Board authorised the engagement of Mr. Albert Stein, whose successful, and repeated erections of works of this nature, in Cincinnati, Ohio; Richmond and Lynchburg, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee; guaranteed a similar result in this city.\n\nThe plan proposed and adopted, was the raising of an artificial mound; and on the mound, the construction of a reservoir, to be filled and replenished as the consumption required it; and for the distribution, cast iron pipes laid in the streets.\n\nThe mound is situated on the square comprised within Richard, Market, John the Baptist, and Religious streets. The earth of which it is thrown up was carted from the batture of the river, amounting to 70,000 cubic yards. The first load of earth was hauled June 2d, 1834. The mound is 21 feet above the level of the soil, and is surrounded with a brick wall 320 feet square, 9 feet high from the upper part of the bottom, and 6 feet thick at the base, reduced to 2 feet at the top; it is plastered with hydraulic cement. The first brick was laid on January 28th, 1835, and the whole wall completed the 26th of March, 1835.\n\nThe reservoir is constructed on the mound. It is 250 feet square, built of bricks, and divided into four compartments, measuring each 118 feet in the clear. The walls and bottoms forming the reservoir are built of bricks and plastered with hydraulic cement.\n\nA pavilion of an octagonal form has been erected on the intersection of the partition walls, supported by eight pillars. It is about 15 feet wide and 10 high.\n\nThe reservoir is supplied with water from the Mississippi river by plunge pumps, worked by a condensing engine acting expansively on Bolton & Watts' plan. These pumps were adopted as the most efficacious on account of the great quantity of matter held in suspension by the water. They are connected to a suction pipe 16 inches in diameter, and about 800 feet long: and to the main descending into the reservoir 16 inches in diameter and 600 feet long.\n\nThe cylinder is 25 inches in diameter and 6 foot stroke and is calculated to raise 3,000,000 gallons of water in 24 hours.\n\nThe engine and pump houses are built of bricks, and are situated on the lot forming the corner of Tchapitoulas and Richard streets.\n\nThe engine house is 34 feet high, and has a front of 29 feet on Tchapitoulas and 40 feet on Richard.\n\nBoth the lot on which the mound has been raised, and that on which stand the engine and pump houses, are situated in the fauburg Annunciation and within the parish of Orleans, the former being the third, and the latter the first square from the river.\n\nOn the same lot with the engine and pump houses, is a commodious two story dwelling house for the use of the person who runs the engine, brick work shop and blacksmith shop, and severa1 out-houses for the use and convenience of the establishment.\n\nThe water is distributed through cast iron pipes, capable of sustaining a pressure of water of 300 feet head. They vary from 18 to 6 inches in diameter for the mains, but the greater part of them consist of the larger sizes, which have ramifications of less dimensions. There are two mains from the reservoir, one of l8, the other of 12 inches bore, which are gradually reduced in size as the distance becomes greater from the source, or as circumstances may require.\n\nOn April 28. 1836, two years after the commencement of the works, water was pumped into the reservoir. It can be delivered to the upper part of the city at 21 feet, and in the lower sections of it at 21 feet above the level of the soil.\n\nThe provisions of the charter specified that the company were to expend annually $100,000 until the completion of the works, and the water to be delivered at a height of 15 feet; and that they were to commence operations twelve months after the election of the directors. By the delivery of the water two years after the commencement of the works, and at a height of not 21 feet, the provisions of the charter were anticipated in date and excelled in height.\n\nThe daily average consumption of water during the year 1837 was 250,000, tons and from the comparative great capacity of the reservoir sufficient time is allowed for the water to settle in one of the four compartments before it is drawn for the use of the city.\n\nStatement of Expenditures on the New Orleans Water Works, from the commencement of the Works, to January 1st, 1858.\n\nEngine and Pumps, and the lot on which they stand $55,184.95\n\nDistribution, 293,276.11\n\nReservoir and Mound, 154,505.11\n\nReal Estate and Other Property, 57,921.08\n\nPrivate Families, 6,864.04\n\nSalaries, 23,000.00\n\nIncidentals, 30,883.45\n\nInterest, 100,669.44\n\n$722,004.13\n\nThe plan on which Mr. Stein had based his estimates, comprised the engine and pups, the reservoir, and a line of eleven miles of pipes.

The payments for water, obtained from these works, was to be proportioned so that the company may get, in the first five years, a clear profit of 15 per cent. at the maximum, and in the following years only 10 per cent. After the expiration of thirty-five years the city may purchase the water works and its appurtenances at a price to be determined by appraisement, and five years after, or in any case within fifty years from the day of the passage of the act, the banking privileges expire.\n\nIn conformity with this charter, the company has constructed a large reservoir, into which the water is raised from the Mississippi by steam power, and then conducted through pipes, the aggregate length of which is already twenty-three miles, to the different parts of the city. A family of six persons pays annually twenty dollars as water rent, for every person over six two dollars additional; two children under fifteen years of age are counted for one person. The owner of a public house (hotel) pays fifty dollars per year, and three per cent. of the house rent. For a horse is paid three dollars, for a carriage three dollars, for a bath in a private lodging five dollars, for a bath in a public house fourteen dollars per year, etc. As yet not the fourth part of the city is provided with water, and nevertheless the expenditure of the company amounts already to 900,000 dollars. The revenue or water rent was, in 1837, only 8,000 dollars, and in 1838 17,000 dollars; in 1839 the company expects an income of 25,000 dollars. It is clear that the works would not have been undertaken without the profits being secured by banking privileges.\n\n1841 New Orleans General Guide and Land Intelligence, showing water works reservoir at P.1. on the square bounded by Richard, Market, John the Baptist, and Religious streets.

This water is wholesome and palatable.\n\nPage 146-148: THE WATER WORKS. In 1833, a company was incorporated under the title of the \"Commercial Bank of New Orleans,\" the principal object of which was to supply the city with pure water from the Mississippi river. To effect this object, an artificial mound was constructed on the square comprised within Richard, Market, John the Baptist and Religious streets, consisting of seventy thousand cubic yards of earth, taken from the batture (deposit) of the river. The work was completed during 1834-5.\n\nThe reservoir is constructed on the top of this mound. It is two hundred and fifty feet square, built of brick, and divided into four compartments, measuring each one hundred and eighteen feet in the clear. The walls and bottoms forming the reservoir, are built with brick, and plastered with hydraulic cement. A pavilion of an octagonal form has been erected on the intersection of the partition walls, supported by eight pillars. It is about fifteen feet wide and ten high, and affords quite a commanding and pleasant prospect. The reservoir is supplied with water from the Mississippi river, by plunge pumps, worked by a condensing engine, acting expansively on Bolton and Watt's plan. These pumps were adopted as the most efficacious, on account of the great quantity of matter held in suspension by the water. They are connected to a suction pipe sixteen inches in diameter, and about eight hundred feet long; and to the main, descending into the reservoir, sixteen inches in diameter and six hundred feet long. The cylinder is twenty-five inches in diameter and six feet stroke, and is calculated to raise three millions gallons of water in twenty-four hours. The engine and pump houses are built of brick, and are situated on the lot forming the corner of Tchapitoulas and Richard streets.\n\nThe water is distributed through cast iron pipes, capable of sustaining a pressure of water of three hundred feet head. They vary from eighteen to six inches in diameter for the mainsbut the greater part of them consist of the larger sizes, which have numerous ramifications of less dimensions. There are two mains from the reservoir; one of eighteen, the other of twelve inches bore, which are gradually reduced in size as the distance becomes greater from the source, or as circumstances may require. In 1836, water was first pumped into the reservoir. It can be delivered in the upper part of the city twenty-one feet, and in the lower sections, twenty-seven feet above the level of the soil.\n\nThe daily average consumption of water, during the year 1844, was one million gallons; and, from the comparative great capacity of the reservoir, sufficient time is allowed for the water to settle, in one of the four compartments, before it is drawn for the use of the city.\n\nMuch good might be achieved by a more enlarged operation of these works. The water is capable of being made fit for all domestic purposes, thus obviating the necessity for cisterns, the birthplace of millions of moschetoes, and, possibly the source of much sickness. For the purposes of bathing it is almost indispensable; and, for forming fountains, to cleanse the streets and to purify and cool the air, it may be rendered equally a convenience, a luxury, and an embellishment.\n\n1846 The Daily Picayune, April 14, 1846, Page 2.\n\n\"The First Municipality Council authorized the Mayor to pay a first installment of $5,450.43 to Mr. Wm. Bell, on his contract to build the waterworks on the levee, between the meat [Sq. 3_oldnumber] and vegetable [Sq. 11] markets. The work scheduled for completion June 1, were designed to supply the reservoir with 75,000 gallons of water per day, with a head of 25 feet.\"\n\n1846 \"The Water Works of New Orleans,\" New Orleans Weekly Delta, December 21, 1846, Page 2.\n\nThe New York Herald states that the President of the Water Works of the Commercial Bank of New Orleans has made a contract with the Allaire Association of this city for an engine and hydraulic machinery, to be capable of raising six millions of gallons of water every twenty-four hours. This work will be the largest of the kind in the United States. It is to supply New Orleans with water.\n\n1847 Eight days in New Orleans in February, 1847, by Albert James Pickett\n\nPage 26: A large portion of the city of Orleans is watered from the large reservoir in the upper part of the second municipality. An iron pipe eighteen inches in diameter, is placed in the river twelve feet below the surface, and through this, great columns of water are continually ascending by sixty horse power force-pumps, situated in brick buildings on Tchoupitoulas and Richard streets. The water is carried under ground for two hundred yards further, and forced up the reservoir alluded to, which has been made in the manner of an artificial mound, from the sediment of the river. The reservoir is built on the top of the mound, and is about three hundred feet square, walled with brick and cemented, with four apartments in it, each having about five feet live water in them. Every month or two, the water is drawn off from two of them, and the deposit formed six inches deep is scraped off, and the water let in again. A pavilion in the middle of the reservoir affords a pleasant seat, and affords you a commanding view of the immediate neighborhood. The pumps force up 2,280 gallons per minute. The cost of the works is about $1,490,000; expenses, $17,000; revenue, $75000. The water is distributed through cast iron pipes from sixteen to six inches in diameter, and is sold at the rate of three dollars per head. The daily consumption is near one million three hundred thousand gallons.\n\n1847 Documents relating to the dividend by the of the Commercial Bank\n\n1848 An act to compel the Commercial Bank of New Orleans to comply with the terms of its charter, March 16, 1848.\n\n1851 Daily Picayune, November 9, 1852.\n\nThe alderman wanted to alter the Waterworks [Sq. 10], between the Market Houses, to a market house, and to sell the engine and other fixtures.

Did the act become a law without the approval of the Governor? According to the Governor's repeated averment, the act was not presented to him until the \"the time prescribed by the Constitution of the State\" had already been encroached upon, and that it therefore could not become a law through lapse of time. The list of incorporators presents a strange medley, reminding us of the strange bedfellows which travel makes one acquainted with.

The first company was incorporated in 1833, as the Commercial Bank, at a time when it was the fashion to charter banks with a power to do something quite irrelevant to the operations of finance. By a provision of the charter the city had the right to purchase the works at any time after the lapse of thirty-five years. This right was exercised in 1869, and bonds issued for the amount of the appraisement. The city operated the system until 1877, when, being in default in the interest on the bonds as well as on the rest of her funded debt, it was deemed wise to put the concern in the hands of a business corporation. This change was effected under the Act of March 31, 1877, the bonds given in 1869 being mostly exchanged for stock in the new company. Under this Act, as interpreted by the Courts, the \"Water-works Company has a monopoly of the supply of water for sale, which is to last for fifty years from the date of the act of 1877. Some improvements have been made of late in the service by the introduction of a stand-pipe, with a head of sixty feet, and by some extension of the mains. The problem of filtering the water, however, remains unsolved. It is, as a rule, very muddy and unattractive for any purpose. The use of cistern water, stored in cypress tanks, above ground, is almost universal in New Orleans. Such water, exposed to light and air and renewed by frequent showers, is clear and white, makes a charming bath and when filtered through porous stone as it may easily be, is agreeable and wholesome for drinking.\n\n1890 \"New Orleans,\" from Manual of American Water Works, Volume 2.\n\n1891 New Orleans v New Orleans Water Works Co., 142 U.S. 79, December 14, 1891, United States Supreme Court\n\n1891 \"New Orleans,\" from Manual of American Water Works, Volume 3.\n\n1892 Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Louisiana: Embracing an Authentic and Comprehensive Account of the Chief Events in the History of the State, a Special Sketch of Every Parish and a Record of the Lives of Many of the Most Worthy and Illustrious Families and Individuals\n\nPages 193-194: Water Works\n\n1896 The National Water Purifying Company v.

In 1810, an attempt to establish water-works was made by one Louis Gleises. The new water-works were of a most primitive character. The pipes were hollowed out of cypress logs, and the supply of water was obtained from the river by slave labor, that is, a number of slaves pumped the water into a large reservoir, from which it was distributed through the hollow logs to such citizens as had subscribed. Necessarily, very few persons got their water supply in this way, a majority of them depending upon cisterns or wells.\n\nIn 1819, the New Orleans Water-Works Company was incorporated by the Legislature, with a capital of $120,000. The board met on December 19, with eleven directors, nine elected by the stockholders and two appointed by the mayor. Nothing, however, of any moment was done by this company.\n\nIn 1833, the Commercial Bank was established, with a capital of $3,000,000, its purpose being to establish water-works in New Orleans. The charter was to run for thirty-five years, at the end of which time the city was authorized to purchase the works. The company was to furnish the city with water free of expense and with all the water it needed for the extinguishment of fires and for other public purposes. The new company did not fulfill all its obligations, find in 1848 an act of the Legislature had to be passed compelling it to do so, requiring it to keep all hydrants open, free of charge, for the purpose of washing the streets and gutters imder a penalty of a forfeiture of its charter unless .the company accepted the terms proposed by the State.\n\nOn the expiration of the charter of the company in 1869, the city utilized its right to buy in the water-works, issuing, for that purpose, bonds to the amount of the appraised value of the works, $1,300,000. The city then operated the works until 1877, but so badly that it was on default in the interest on its water-works bonds, as well as on the rest of its funded debt. It was thought best to surrender control and let the water-works pass into the hands of a private company. This was effected under an act of the Legislature of March 3, 1877, the bonds issued in 1869 for the purchase of the works being given in exchange for stock in the new company. Under this act, the New Orleans Water-Works Company was given a monopoly of the supply of water from the Mississippi River for fifty years.\n\nThe Algiers Water-Works and Electric Company was organized in 1895, and the mains were completed the following year. This company supplies the entire fifth municipal district of New Orleans with water, as well as illuminates it.\n\nPage 593: The Commercial Bank of New Orleans, like the New Orleans Gas Light and Banking Company, was an improvement bank, organized for the purpose of providing New Orleans with water, and practically survives to-day in the New Orleans Water Works Company. It was incorporated April 1, 1833, with a capital of $3,000,000, and with five commissioners or directors, three of whom were to be appointed by the Governor and two by the City of New Orleans. The bank was required to furnish the city with free water for the extinguishment of fires, as well as for the public squares. On this score frequent complaints were made and the Legislature of Louisiana found it necessary in 1848 to pass a special act compelling the bank to carry out its obligations to the city in the matter of supplying it with such water as was needed.\n\n1901 Third Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La. from December 31, 1900 to June 30, 1901.\n\n1901 State v.

Mammoth centrifugal pumps were unknown in those days and the methods adopted to obtain a continual supply involved the construction of a large wooden tank (built of cypress, of course) on the river bank. Hand pumps were used and a force of negro slaves was constantly at work keeping the tank full. From this tank ran the water mains, which mains covered a large area of New Orleans. They were cypress logs joined together at the ends and bored with holes ranging in size from seven inches down to four inches in diameter.\n\nIt seems that this system was established by old French and Spanish families on a subscription basis.\n\n1915 Thirty-First Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1915.\n\n1915 Thirty-Second Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1915.\n\n1915 The New Orleans Book by Emma Cecilia Richey and Evelina Prescott Kean\n\n1916 Thirty-Third Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1916. | also here |\n\n1916 Thirty-Fourth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1916.\n\n1917 Thirty-Fifth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1917.\n\n1917 Thirty-Sixth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1917.| also here |\n\n1917 John H. B. Latrobe and his times, 1803-1891 by John Edward Semmes\n\nPages 32-33: Benjamin H. Latrobe had made a contract in 1811 with the city of New Orleans for a water supply. Under the terms of this contract he was to have the right to supply water for twenty years from May 1813, at which time it was presumed the work would be finished, but the war of 1812 interfered with and destroyed all chance of completing the work at that date. The machinery was built in Washington. It was loaded and shipped to New Orleans. The vessel on board of which it had been shipped was captured by the British, which resulted in a great loss to those engaged in the enterprise. It was about this time that the Capitol was partially burned by the British.\n\nMr. Latrobe removed to Pittsburg in 1812, for the purpose of constructing the machinery which was to be used in the New Orleans water works and which was to be shipped by water to that place.\n\nHis eldest son, Henry, who was superintending the works at New Orleans, died in 1817 of yellow fever. Mr. Latrobe's interests required him to visit New Orleans from time to lime. In 1817 or 1818 he moved to Baltimore with his family. His interests in New Orleans required him to move to New Orleans, so that in 1820 he took up his residence there with his family. The elder Latrobe died in September of yellow fever at New Orleans.\n\nPage 60: As mentioned already, my father had a contract for supplying the City of New Orleans with water, and had sent my half brother, Henry, there to look after the work. While we lived in Speaks' house, news came to my father of his death. It was a heavy blow to him. Henry was a brave, gallant fellow who had distinguished himself at the battle of New Orleans on the 23rd of December, was accomplished for his years, had become an able architect, and was universally esteemed. My father felt his loss, not only in the death of a son, but in the confusion caused by it in connection with the contract. 1 remember the death and the gloom and the mourning. But I had rarely seen my brother, and to me the loss was a slight affliction. Children get over such things easily.\n\nPage 83: It was in the fall of 1820 that my father died. After the death of my eldest brother there had been no one to take his place, and being detained no longer by his employment at Washington, while I was at West Point, had gone to New Orleans to attend to his interest there. He had survived a yellow fever season, during which he had had the disease, and, fancying himself fever proof, had taken my mother, brother and sister there, intending to remain until the water works were completed. The year 1820 was a year of great fatality, and among other and numerous victims was my father, who was carried off in the month of September of that year. As soon as possible my mother, with Ben and Julia, returned to Baltimore and took a house in Lexington Street, on the South side, not far from Pine. With my father died, however, forever all prospects of realizing a dollar from the New Orleans contract, and the family was once more reduced to very narrow straits indeed. Some small sum that had been realized in New Orleans, my father's library, and some woodland that my mother had in New jersey, were all she had to live upon.\n\n1918 Thirty-Seventh Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1918 | also here |\n\n1918 Thirty-Eighth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1918.\n\n1919 Thirty-Ninth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1919.\n\n1919 The New Orleans Book\n\nPages 45-46: The Water Supply\n\n1919 Fortieth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1919.\n\n1920 Forty-First Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1920. | also here |\n\n1920 Forty-Second Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1920.\n\n1921 Forty-Third Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1921.\n\n1921 Forty-Fourth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1921.\n\n1922 Forty-Fifth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1922.\n\n1922 Forty-Sixth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1922.\n\n1922 History of New Orleans, Volume 1 by John Smith Kendall\n\nVolume 1, Page 90: Still another and important improvement concerned the water supply. In May, 1810, the Council made a contract with Louis Gleizes to furnish \"a sufficient supply of the Mississippi water not only for the use of the inhabitants but also to water the streets and to extinguish fire in the case of conflagration.\" Gleizes laid a system of wooden conduits to various parts of the town. He was paid not by the municipality but by selling the water to the persons with whose houses the system was connected.\n\nPages 113-114: In March, 1819, the city entered into a contract with Benj. H. B. Latrobe, for the erection of water works to be run by steam. Latrobe erected a small building with appropriate equipment on the levee near the French Market, and for many years supplied the city with water for drinking purposes and for public uses. Up to this time drinking water drawn from the river had been hawked about the city by itinerant vendors, who sold four bucketfuls for a \"picayune\" (6¼ cents) or a hogshead for 50 cents. The public water supply was derived from shallow wells, which, however, did not supply potable water. Latrobe's enterprise, unpretentious as it would seem at the present time, was looked upon as a remarkable improvement upon these antiquated methods of supply.\n\nPage 334 note: Purchase of water works in 1869.\n\nPages 388-389: Sale of waterworks in September 1878 for $2 million.\n\nPage 426: New Orleans Water Works Company.\n\nVolume 2: Water supply\n\n1923 Forty-Seventh Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1923.\n\n1923 Forty-Eighth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1923.\n\n1924 Forty-Ninth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1924.\n\n1924 Fiftieth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1924.\n\n1925 Fifty-First Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1925.\n\n1925 Fifty-Second Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1925.\n\n1926 Fifty-Third Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., June 30th, 1926.\n\n1926 Fifty-Fourth Semi-Annual Report of the Sewerage and Water Board of the City of New Orleans, La., December 31st, 1926.\n\n1937 \"Water, 50¢ a Hogshead,\" New Orleans States, September 10, 1937, Page 2.\n\nSlaves used to pump water from the Mississippi river to the old New Orleans water works established by Louis Gleises in 1810. The water was distributed to subscribers through pipes hollowed out of cypress logs. Up to 1819 water from the river was sold for 50 cents a hogshead, for four buckets for 6¼ cents. It was filtered through stone or treated with alum for drinking purposes.\n\n1938 \"Highlights of the Water Supply System of New Orleans\" [with Discussion], by Alfred F. Theard and George G.

The pipes were hollowed out of cypress logs and the supply of water was obtained from the Mississippi River by slave labor. A number of slaves raised the water into a large reservoir from which it was distributed through the wooden pipe to such citizens as had subscribed for the service. How this water was distributed is not quite established. It was probably by gravity flow, for the banks of the River were high. Very few people took this service.\n\n1938 New Orleans City Guide, written and compiled by the Federal Writer's Project of the Works Project Administration for the City of New Orleans. | also here |\n\nPage 20: Many improvements were made in the town during the next few years.

Although Latrobe referred to him as a \"madman without character or ability to carry on the project,\" within three weeks he had obtained fifteen hundred subscriptions at ten dollars each. Nothing came of the Gleise project, and Latrobe resolved to follow Governor Claiborne's advise by sending his son Henry to New Orleans.\n\nPage 139: Sept'r 27th, 1819, on board the Emma.

Mayor Watkins wrote Julien Poydras, serving as territorial delegate to the United States House of Representatives, asking him to contact B. H. Latrobe on the matter. Latrobe, then a federal surveyor, had completed a water supply system for Philadelphia in 1799. He presented the outline of a charter to the city council in 1810 when he intended to submit to the state legislature. A charter organizing the New Orleans Water Company was granted in 1811. Negotiations between the city and water company continued through 1812.\n\nThe agreement between the two parties granted the water company the exclusive privilege of furnishing the city and suburbs with water for fifteen years. Everything possible of definition was spelled out in the contract. When Latrobe suggested that the city subscribe to shares in the company, the council agreed on the condition that the mayor of New Orleans serve as one of the company's directors so long as the city retained ownership of any stock. Latrobe agreed to this stipulation. Areas of possible altercation between the contracting parties were narrowed as much as possible and the city secured official representation on the company board.

In order to insure a pure water supply for the city, Watkins, through Julian Poydras, the territory's representative in the United States House of Representatives, got in touch with Benjamin Latrobe and began negotiations to have him design and build a water supply system for New Orleans similar to the one he had put in place in Philadelphia in 1799. At the same time Watkins drew up a charter for a proposed company to finance and operate the water works. None of these plans, however, came to realization during his administration. They had to wait for thirteen years, until the administration of Auguste McCarty.\n\n1996 Pipe Dreams: Commercial Bank of New Orleans V.

Designed and built between 1811 and 1820, the New Orleans Waterworks displayed the most advanced innovations of its day, both in hydraulic engineering technology and in aesthetic architectural design. Its cutting-edge steam-powered pumps lifted water from the Mississippi River, fed it into a neoclassical-style waterworks pumping station, and then conveyed the water supply through a downtown distribution network of bored-log pipes. In addition to pioneering industrial machinery capable of pumping river water continuously under pressure and against gravity, the New Orleans system featured a vanguard architectural design. The neoclassical temple to water technology displayed a bold aesthetic form designed by the nations leading engineer-architect and Architect of the U.S. Capitol, Benjamin Latrobe. Latrobes temple form worked symbolically to brand the port city of New Orleans as a modern, industrious, and prestigious gateway to the new American West, and it advanced a vision of technological and aesthetic innovation for the United States.\n\n\"1000 Decatur St,\" Vieus Carré Digital Survey.
