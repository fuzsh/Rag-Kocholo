        "text": "January 1, 1864\n\nEmerson Opdycke greets the coming year from East Tennessee, telling his wife:\n\n“I wish you a Happy New Year, from my heart but cannot say that mine has been such. . . But what will the Year 1864 have in store for us?”\n\nAt Brandy Station, Virginia, Vermonter Lemuel Abbott is more upbeat:\n\n“All are wishing me a ‘Happy New Year’! God grant that I may have one. I was awakened long before daylight by a band serenading the birth of the New Year.”\n\nElsewhere in Virginia, Judith Brockenbrough McGuire begins work in the Confederate Commissary Department, observing:\n\n“the duties of the office are not very onerous, but rather confining for one who left school thirty-four years ago. . . . The ladies, thirty-five in number, are of all ages, and representing various parts of Virginia, also Maryland and Louisiana. Many of them are refugees. It is melancholy to see how many wear mourning for brothers or other relatives, the victims of war.”\n\nResiding for now in the Confederate capital, the spirited South Carolinian, Mary Chesnut, starts the new year on a plaintive note:\n\n“God help my country. . . . I think we are more like the sailors who break into the spirits closet when they find out the ship must sink. There seems to be for the first time a resolute feeling to enjoy the brief hour and never look beyond the day.”\n\nJanuary 2, 1864\n\nGeorge Davis of North Carolina receives confirmation from the Confederate Senate as the new attorney general.\n\nMeeting with fellow officers from the Army of Tennessee at Dalton, Ga., Patrick Cleburne offers his “Memorial” calling for armed service for slaves and freedom to those who will have remained faithful to the cause of the Confederacy. The Irish-born general, who has served the Confederate States unfailingly himself, sees the matter as one of crucial importance in maintaining sufficient numbers of troops in the field and looks upon the issue as steadfastly patriotic in nature:\n\n“As between the loss of independence and the loss of slavery, we assume that every patriot will freely give up the latter—give up the Negro slave rather than be a slave himself.”\n\nFrom Richmond, war department clerk John B. Jones records the call for dramatic action from a neighboring community:\n\n“The Lynchburg Virginian has come out for a dictator, and names Gen. Lee.”\n\nOnly the day before Jones had found the price of a barrel of flour to stand at $150.\n\nJanuary 3, 1864\n\nOpposing forces clash in far-southwestern Virginia.\n\nJanuary 4, 1864\n\nLemuel Abbott records the weather at his billet:\n\n“It has snowed nearly all day, but not very hard. To-night there is about two inches on the ground and it is still snowing.”\n\nJanuary 5, 1864\n\nAbraham Lincoln addresses the matter of bounties for service as the U.S. Congress reassesses such incentive payments.\n\nConfederate bureau chief, Robert G.H. Kean assesses the latest rumor for aid from outside of the South:\n\n“It has been determined, as I am informed, to send a minister to the French in Mexico with a proposal of alliance between the Southern Confederacy and [Emperor] Maximilian. I doubt if that card will win.”\n\nIn Louisiana, William Henry King reacts to the news that William Hardee has replaced Braxton Bragg as an army commander:\n\n“Don’t know much about Hardee’s merits, but feel quite certain the Confederacy is not worsted in the exchange. Bragg would make a fare general for an aristocracy or a monarchy, but not for a people battling for independence.”\n\nDespite bitterly cold temperatures, Union guards at Johnson’s Island Prison exercise greater vigilance over their captives. John Dooley writes:\n\n“Snow 6 inches deep: since the recent escapes we are obliged at roll call, no matter how severe the weather, to stand outside our blocks and not only to answer to our names but be counted and wait until all the other prisoners are counted throughout the prison, when, at the sound of the drum, we are permitted to return; this act of discipline generally lasts from a half to three quarters of an hour.”\n\nJanuary 6, 1864\n\nSome light fighting takes place near Dalton, Ga.\n\nColonel Christopher “Kit” Carson is at the head of forces aimed at compelling the remaining Navajos operating independently onto a reservation. The action occurs in the vicinity of Canyon de Chelly in the far U.S. southwest.\n\nJanuary 7, 1864\n\nFrom Washington City, President Lincoln makes another of a number of pardons for troops in the field, explaining as motivation in this instance: “I did this, not on any merit in the case, but because I am trying to evade the butchering business lately.”\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of the Interior Caleb Smith dies in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nJanuary 8, 1864\n\nSouthern artillerist Henry Robinson Berkeley poses a difficult philosophical question after he witnesses the dispensing of military justice in Virginia:\n\n“Saw a man shot today for desertion. Poor fellow! His crime was only going home to see after his wife and children. It was his third or fourth offense. . . . He was buried where he was executed. Did he not die for his country?”\n\nAccused Confederate spy David O. Dodd, meets his fate on a gallows in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe colorful Southern horseman, John Hunt Morgan, attends a reception arranged for him in Richmond.\n\nJanuary 9, 1864\n\nPresident Davis is worried about a potential Union assault on Mobile, Ala.\n\nJanuary 10, 1864\n\nAlthough the Union blockade of Southern ports is proving ever-more effective, the U.S.S. Iron Age falls victim to shallow waters and Confederate fire off the South Carolina coast.\n\nConfederate ordnance chief Josiah Gorgas records recent developments in Richmond and elsewhere in Virginia: “The arrival of Gen. Jno. H. Morgan created quite a stir here on Friday. The city authorities and the Govt received him at the Ballard House, and gave him a handsome reception.\n\nGen. Early is operating in the lower valley of the Shenandoah, to get beef, of which the army is in great need. We shall get thro’ the winter without manifest suffering, tho’ shoes and blankets are still wanting.”\n\nJanuary 11, 1864\n\nUnion naval forces achieve a measure of retribution for the loss of a vessel on the previous day by causing the destruction of two blockade-runners in the same vicinity.\n\nWilliam T. Sherman is at Memphis, keeping one eye one the ice flowing by on the river and the other on Nathan Bedford Forrest. Concerning the latter and his own plans for the future, Cump confides to his wife Ellen:\n\n“It is exceedingly difficult to deal with these Mounted Devils and I am sure all we can do is to make the Country feel that the People must pay for these wandering Arabs. I will run down to Vicksburg, and back to Memphis and be ready to start on some expedition by the 20th. I may strike for Meridian and Selma.”\n\nJanuary 12, 1864\n\nDisturbances in Matamoros, Mexico, prompt efforts to remove the U.S. Consul from danger.\n\nJanuary 13, 1864\n\nPresident Davis wants his field commander in Georgia, Joseph E. Johnston, to understand the vital nature of his position and the desire of the commander-in-chief not to forfeit it by retreating from it:\n\n“I trust you will not deem it necessary to adopt such a measure.”\n\nIn Tennessee, Emerson Opdycke notes:\n\n“Three of Longstreet’s men deserted and came over to us; they reported that they had been living off the country and everything was ‘mighty scarce.’\n\nJanuary 14, 1864\n\nJefferson Davis continues to keep a close eye on Mobile, one of the few viable life-lines to the outside world left to the Confederacy. He is even considering the propriety of shifting troops from Johnston in Georgia for defense of the city.\n\nHoosier soldier William Miller is still recovering from a wound as his comrades reap the benefits of their recent campaigning:\n\n“General Washingtons Birth day was celebrated by the Cars running in to Chattanooga for the first time since we occupied it. Now we will get full rations. The Boys boarded the cars and helped them selves to ‘grub.’ They found Some Sanitary [Commission] Whisky and some of them got terible drunk and had a jolly time. . . . I dont approve of the proceedings but they have lived on Half and quarter rations since in September and I dont blame them much.”\n\nJanuary 15, 1864\n\nIn addition to her government employment, Judith McGuire records another change in her life:\n\n“My occupation at home just now is as new as that in the office—it is shoe-making.”\n\nJanuary 16, 1864\n\nTroops clash in the vicinity of Dandridge, as East Tennessee continues to experience the movement of forces through the region.\n\nMajor General Samuel R. Curtis assumes command of the Federal Department of Kansas.\n\nJanuary 17, 1864\n\nOrdnance Chief Gorgas looks to the government’s measures to bolster the armies as well as civilian morale:\n\n“Our armies are filling up and will I hope, be strong enough for their work by the 1st of May. A law abolishing all substitution has just been passed. While I don’t think this will materially Strengthen the army, it will give general satisfaction.”\n\nWhile in Hartford, Conn., during a transfer from one vessel to another, Union naval officer Roswell Lamson finds time for social pursuits as well as professional ones, including services conducted by one of the leading lights of New England:\n\n“This morning I went to church . . . and heard a most excellent and interesting sermon from the Rev. Mr. [Nathaniel J.] Burton who is called the most able preacher in Connecticut, and is thought by many to be equal if not superior to Henry Ward Beecher. I would rather hear Mr. Beecher—he speaks more from his everyday observation of the world and of men and touches springs that few men know to exist. Mr. Burton speaks more from books and from his own inward consciousness—he may be superior in intellect but with my [limited theological] training it is natural I should prefer Mr. Beecher.”\n\nJanuary 18, 1864\n\nOne of the many Confederates assembled in the area of Dalton, Ga., sends a letter for publication \"from the Army,\" that contains the state of the weather, the condition of the army and a sense of the morale of the troops. \"Camp life is not so horrible as one might suppose. . . . The winter is waering away, and soon our battle flags will have to be unfurled to the breezes od spring, and the lines of gray will have to be drawn up--a living wall, against which the tide of invasion, it is hoped, will beat in vain.\"\n\nHe adds with a literary flourish: \"The old year closed down upon us with defeat, disaster. May the present year bring us victory and success. The hour is dark and full of gloom, but such generally comes before the dawning of beautiful day.\"\n\nUnion forces continue to confront Confederate guerrillas along the Mississippi River.\n\nJohn C. Breckinridge demonstrates his sense of diplomacy and tact when a guest at a social event in the Confederate capital “pitched into [him] for his conduct of affairs at Missionary Ridge. ‘Well, sir, how came we to lose Chattanooga?’ General Breckinridge coolly responded, ‘It is a long story,’ turned away, and began talking to someone else.”\n\nJanuary 19, 1864\n\nJust northeast of Knoxville, Emerson Opdycke lets off steam as his command battles the elements and what he deems as less than competent leadership in his own ranks:\n\n“I am sick of being under Potomac Generals. . . . The campaigning is exceedingly rough cold rain, snow, no tents and short rations.”\n\nJanuary 20, 1864\n\nJefferson Davis’s fears seem to be confirmed of Mobile as an emerging focal point for Federal attentions with Union vessels maneuvering into position at the entrance to Mobile Bay.\n\nGeneral Sherman keeps fellow general John Logan abreast of developments in Mississippi:\n\n“The River has been little molested by the Guerillas who find it dont pay, and as the waters rise they know we will go up the Yazoo & Red Rivers and punish the Interior for their rascality. On this trip I have not seen or heard of a Guerilla and the Merchant Boats pass up and down with little fear. Abundance of wood has been gathered, and swarms of adventurers are crowding Vicksburg to hire Abandoned Plantations. The negro soldier idea is nearly exhausted and the popular idea is now to convert them into laborers for the benefit of the hungry Plantation Contractors. Well I am willing the Philanthropists should take the job off our hands and I tell them to go ahead, but I will not divert troops from Military duties to guard local interests.”\n\nJanuary 21, 1864\n\nGorgas notes both the threats and the benefits still being derived from blockade-running traffic:\n\n“Movements reported seem to indicate designs against Mobile. . . . A couple of good cargos have lately arrived there for us from Havanna.”\n\nJohn B. Jones records an unsettling development for the Confederate president:\n\n“Last night an attempt was made (by his servants, it is supposed) to burn the President’s mansion. It was discovered that fire had been kindled in the wood-pile in the basement. The smoke led to the discovery, else the family might have been consumed with the house. One or two of the servants have absconded.\"\n\nMary Chesnut references Patrick Cleburne’s proposal for arming slaves in terse fashion:\n\n“The Army of the West desire the negroes freed and put in the ranks. They wonder it has never been done before.”\n\nJanuary 22, 1864\n\nMajor General William Rosecrans will become the next Union commander of the Department of the Missouri, in place of the controversial Major General John M. Schofield, who will be headed for the Department of the Ohio.\n\nArkansas now has a pro-Union government, with a provisional governor. Isaac Murphy will lead the effort to establish this new administration.\n\nRecent events at the Davis home continue to garner attention. Diarist Chesnut observes:\n\n“Went to Mrs. Davis’s. It is sad enough. Fancy having to be always ready to have your servants set your house on fire—bribed to do it. Such constant robberies—such servants coming and going daily to the Yankees, carrying one’s silver, etc., does not conduce to make home happy.”\n\nJanuary 23, 1864\n\nAbraham Lincoln responds to a request for his opinion on the matter of returning plantations to productivity in the wake of war and emancipation developments:\n\n“You have enquired how the government would regard and treat cases wherever the owners of plantations, in Arkansas, for instance, might fully recognize the freedom of those formerly slaves, and by fair contracts of hire with them, re-commence the cultivation of their plantations. I answer I should regard such cases with great favor. . . .”\n\nJanuary 24, 1864\n\nSmall operations mark the day in areas as wide-spread as Mississippi, East Tennessee and Tidewater Virginia.\n\nJanuary 25, 1864\n\nLong the scene of contention, Corinth, Miss. has ceased to hold the same importance as occupying Union forces leave the town to move to other posts.\n\nJanuary 26, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln is once more active, addressing trade in areas once controlled by the Confederates and suspending execution sentences for a number of Union soldiers.\n\nJanuary 27, 1864\n\nDevelopments in Central Virginia continue to look promising for the Union cause there, as Lemuel Abbott records in his diary:\n\n“Two deserters came into our lines this morning; they report Lee’s army in a miserable condition—no rations or clothing, and the citizens nearly starving. They say that ‘Secession is playing out.’”\n\nPresident Davis requests that Braxton Bragg travel to Richmond for consultation.\n\nJanuary 28, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln requests that Henry Halleck encourage steps to be taken to secure the lines of communication and transportation westward from Missouri from any potential Confederate actions:\n\n“Some citizens of Missouri—vicinity of Kansas City—are apprehensive that there is special danger of renewed troubles in that neighbourhood and thence on the route toward New-Mexico. I am not impressed that the danger is very great or imminent, but I will thank you to give Genls Rosecrans and Curtis respectively such orders as may turn their attention thereto and prevent as far as possible the apprehended disturbances.”\n\nRoswell Lamson explains in a letter home that hard work remains to be completed before making his vessel, the Gettysburg, ready for service, attributing the level of effort required to “evidences of stupidity almost past belief.” But, he has also maintained sufficient time for other activities and remarks on one of his companions in particular:\n\n“Wednesday evening I was invited to Mr. Beechers to tea and to spend the evening which passed very pleasantly. There was a ‘Secesh’ lady there from South Carolina whose father owned a large share of the Margaret & Jessie before she was captured; her husband is a Yankee and it was very amusing to hear her remarks about Yankees in general, and Yankees in particular.”\n\nJanuary 29, 1864\n\nA new round of Federal bombardment of Fort Sumter begins, although the Confederates now have the ironclad Charleston to bolster the defense of the name-sake city.\n\nJanuary 30, 1864\n\nRosecrans assumes command in Missouri, while Major General Frederick Steele does the same in Arkansas.\n\nJanuary 31, 1864\n\nGorgas reflects on recent Congressional action that aims at placing men between 45 and 55 in the ranks:\n\n“In such a war as this—a war for national existence the whole mass of the nation must be engaged. It must be divided into those who go to the field and fight, & those who stay at home to support the fighting portion, supplying all the food, and material of war. . . . It is absurd to call on all to fight. Some must labor or all will starve. There is much crude legislation going on, but we shall work thro’ this revolution [even] with some blunders.”\n\nMary Chesnut continues to socialize, observe and record events in her diary:\n\n“General Hood informed today that he was ordered to the Army of Tennessee, that he was now a corps commander. Suddenly his eye blazed as he said this.\n\nSaid I to myself, ‘All that ambition still—in spite of those terrible wounds.’ Did he read my thoughts? He added, ‘This has been the happiest year of any, in spite of all my wounds.’\n\nAgain his eye blazed up.”\n\nIn the midst of an on-going struggle between the legislative and executive branches of the Confederate government, Robert Kean laments the apparent loss of one crucial official:\n\n“The clamor against the nitre and mining bureau as a refuge for skulkers and exempts has caused Colonel [Isaac] St. John to resign. . . . Colonel St. John has developed the production of nitre from almost nothing to nearly a full supply. But for the loss of territory where the richest nitrous earths are found, he would have been wholly independent of importation. The loss of Tennessee has caused him to develop his works further in the interior, and in a few months his beds laid down near all the interior cities will be ripe. To his great energy, talent for organization, and skilful invention in supplementing defective resources, the country owes as much as to any man in the service, whatever his rank or fame. Others have made good use of what the country afforded in resources. He has created when resources there were none.”\n\nTo a colleague in Alabama, General Sherman addresses questions concerning civilians in occupied areas:\n\n“In my former letters I have answered all your questions save one, and that relates to the treatment of inhabitants known or suspected to be hostile or ‘Secesh.’ This is in truth the most difficult business of our Army as it advances & occupies the Southern Country. It is almost impossible to lay down Rules and I invariably leave this whole subject to the local commander, but am willing to give them the benefit of my acquired Knowledge and experience. . . .\n\nWe of the North are beyond all question Right in our Cause. . . .\n\nWhen men take up Arms to resist a Rightful Authority we are compelled to use like force, because all reason and argument cease when arms are resorted to. When the provisions, forage, horses, mules, wagons, etc., are used by our enemy it is clearly our duty & Right to take them also; because otherwise they might be used against us. . . . But the question arises as to the dwellings used by women, children & non-combatants. So long as non-combatants remain in their houses & Keep to their accustomed peaceful business, their opinions and prejudices can in no wise influence the War & therefore should not be noticed. . . .\n\nTo those who submit to the Rightful Laws & authority of their State & National Government promise all gentleness and forbearance, but to the petulant and persistent secessionist, why death or banishment is a mercy, and the quicker he or she is disposed of the better.”\n\nMarch 1, 1864\n\nThe plan by Judson Kilpatrick and Ulric Dahlgren to enter Richmond, liberate Union prisoners being held there and impact the government and its officials experiences a dramatic turn as the former turns back with his larger raiding force, leaving the latter to fend for himself with some 500 men against aroused local defenders, including civilian personnel pressed into action.\n\nConfederate war clerk John Beauchamp Jones records the reaction of the Confederate capital to the Union raid:\n\n“As the morning progressed, the city was a little startled by the sound of artillery in a northern direction, and not very distant. Couriers and horsemen from the country announced the approach of the enemy within the outer fortifications; a column of 5000 cavalry. . . . To-morrow we shall know more; but no uneasiness is felt as to the result. In a few hours we can muster men enough to defend the city against 25,000.”\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln nominates Ulysses Grant for the rank of lieutenant general.\n\nHe also revisits the case of a soldier whose sanction for an offence has included a reduction in his pay:\n\n“I do not like this punishment of withholding pay—it falls so very hard upon poor families.”\n\nFrom Bermuda, U.S. Consul Charles Maxwell Allen informs Secretary of State William Seward:\n\n“Captain [John N.] Maffitt, late of the privateer Florida, intends to leave here tomorrow as Master of the steamer Flora.”\n\nMarch 2, 1864\n\nTrying to extricate his command, Colonel Dahlgren rides into an ambush. Confederate fire fells him from his saddle, where papers on his person suggest his intention to kill President Davis and any other Confederate leaders he may encounter on his mission.\n\nThe U.S. Senate confirms the Grant nomination.\n\nJ.B. Jones observes proudly of the role of the civilians in Richmond’s defense:\n\n“The Department Clerks were in action in the evening in five minutes after they were formed. Capt. Ellery, Chief Clerk of 2d Auditor, was killed, and several were wounded.”\n\nMarch 3, 1864\n\nThe U.S. Congress authorizes the Treasury to issue $200,000,000 in ten-year bonds.\n\nMarch 4, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln inquires of Major General Benjamin Butler concerning the latest intelligence on Ulric Dahlgren on behalf of that officer’s illustrious father:\n\n“Admiral Dahlgren is here, and of course is very anxious about his son. Please send me at once all you know, or can learn of his fate.\"\n\nThe U.S. Senate acts on the nomination of Andrew Johnson as military governor of Tennessee.\n\nMichael Hahn takes office as governor of Louisiana as efforts continue to place pro-Union administrations where possible in seceded Southern states.\n\nMarch 5, 1864\n\nJ.B. Jones continues to note the impact of the recent Union raid on the city:\n\n“Some extraordinary memoranda were captured from the raiders, showing a diabolical purpose, and creating a profound sensation here.\"\n\nFrom prison at Johnson’s Island, John Dooley observes:\n\n“Snowing very hard and very fine—it nearly always snows fine in this region. To day our room holds a meeting and, in conclave assembled, condemn in unmeasured terms the conduct of the Yankee whining Chaplain who attempted to force political and religious tracts on us yesterday.”\n\nMarch 6, 1864\n\nConfederate raids continue on land and water in Kentucky and South Carolina. In the latter instance, an effort to sink the U.S.S. Memphis proves unsuccessful.\n\nMarch 7, 1864\n\nJefferson Davis calls for General James Longstreet to exercise the initiative from his current position at Greeneville, Tennessee.\n\nAbraham Lincoln turns his attention to the question of emancipation in Maryland and the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nMarch 8, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln and General U.S. Grant meet personally for the first in an awkward moment in the White House.\n\nMarch 9, 1864\n\nBrigadier General Matthew W. Ransom’s forces confront Union troops at Suffolk, Va., that include African Americans, many of whom had come from the area before returning in arms to it.\n\nPresident Lincoln reflects privately with Ulysses Grant on the conditions under which that general has received his recent promotion and with the words that plans to make public on the following day at a formal ceremony:\n\n“The nation’s appreciation of what you have done, and it’s reliance upon you for what remains to do, in the existing great struggle, are now presented with this commission, constituting you Lieutenant General in the Army of the United States. With this high honor devolves upon you also, a corresponding responsibility. . . . I scarcely need to add that with what I here speak for the nation goes my hearty personal concurrence.”\n\nIn South Carolina, Emma Holmes provides a long diary entry that covers matters as diverse as social matters and currency policy to the recent Union cavalry raid on Richmond. She concludes:\n\n“Dear old Charleston still receives daily her allotted portion of battering, and ‘The Gillmore district’ is showing ghastly rents in many a once fair & goodly mansion.”\n\nMarch 10, 1864\n\nGeneral Grant accepts his promotion formally:\n\n“I accept this commission, with gratitude for the high honor confered [sic]. . . . I feel the full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me and know that if they are met it will be due those armies, and above all to the favor of that Providence which leads both Nations and men.\"\n\nIn his new capacity, General Grant also undertakes “the command of the armies of the United States.”\n\nWilliam T. Sherman writes his friend Grant to express satisfaction at the promotion:\n\n“You are now [George] Washington’s legitimate successor, and occupy a position of almost dangerous elevation . . . . I believe you are as brave, patriotic, and just, as the great prototype Washington; as unselfish, kind-hearted, and honest, as a man should be; but the chief characteristic in your nature is the simple faith in success you have always manifested. . . .\n\nNow as to the future. Do not stay in Washington. . . . Come out West; take to yourself the whole Mississippi Valley; let us make it dead-sure, and I will tell you the Atlantic slope and pacific shores will follow its destiny as sure as the limbs of a tree live and die with the main trunk!\n\nFor God’s sake and for your country’s sake, come out of Washington!”\n\nIn Louisiana, William Henry King notes the disaffection of the men in Confederate major general John G. Walker’s command “on account of the trade now being carried on between the Federals & our officers. Hoozah for them! That this is ‘a rich man’s war, & a poor man’s fight,’ needs no further proof.”\n\nU.S. Consul C.M. Allen continues to report on the state of affairs in his jurisdiction, noting in part:\n\n“Brig Carl Emile from Liverpool, barque Enterprise from Newport, and ships Storm King and Gambia from Cardiff, have arrived during the past week with cargoes for the Confederates. The Gambia went onto the rock near the entrance of this port (St. George’s). Vessel and cargo nearly a total loss.”\n\nMarch 11, 1864\n\nW.H. King is unimpressed with defensive efforts on the Red River:\n\n“A portion (110 feet) of the obstructions in R. River at Fort DeRussy has been forced from its place by high water. Great engineering! When this water is low, & gun boats can not pass, obstructions are put in the River under the supervision of ‘Competent Engineers,’ but as soon as there is plenty of water for the gun boats, it sweeps the obstructions out. Consummate folly!”\n\nMarch 12, 1864\n\nGeneral Nathaniel Banks is on the move in Louisiana.\n\nSherman tells his wife that he expects the critical juncture of the war to be coming:\n\n“All that has gone before is mere Skirmishing—The War now begins and with heavy well disciplined masses the issue must be settled in hard fought Battles. I think we can whip them in Alabama and it may be in Georgia, but the Devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired—No amount of poverty or adversity seems to shake their faith. . . .”\n\nMarch 13, 1864\n\nMary Chesnut notes the presence of numerous Confederate generals in worship in Richmond, including Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet and Braxton Bragg:\n\n“Somebody counted fourteen generals in church and suggested that less piety and more drilling of commands would suit the times better.”\n\nOf the recent Union raid she explains:\n\n“Now that Dahlgren has failed to carry out his orders, the Yankees disown them. They disavow it all. He was not sent here to murder us all, hang the president, and burn the town. There is the notebook, however, at the executive office, with the orders to hang and burn.”\n\nRobert G.H. Kean relates the war department news in his journal, but saves his severest assessment for Georgia governor Joseph E. Brown, former secretary of state Robert Toombs and Vice President Alexander Stephens, comparing them unfavorably to the notoriously anti-Davis administration critics, North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance and N.C. Justice Richard Pearson:\n\n“These people—Brown, Toombs, Stephens and their set—are the most pestilent demagogues in the land, more injurious than the North Carolina buffaloes because [they] are more able and influential.”\n\nPresident Lincoln sends a private message to Michael Hahn:\n\n“I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first-free-state Governor of Louisiana.”\n\nMarch 14, 1864\n\nFort DeRussy falls to Brigadier General Joseph A. Mower’s Union troops, with strong support from Union ironclads, as the Red River Campaign opens with a Federal success.\n\nMarch 15, 1864\n\nKeen notes the “intrigue” present at the highest levels of the Confederate government to replace Secretary of War John Seddon with administration-favorite Judah Benjamin, currently secretary of state. Benjamin had served as head of the war department in 1861-62.\n\nMarch 16, 1864\n\nAlexandria, Louisiana, surrenders to naval forces under the command of Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter.\n\nMarch 17, 1864\n\nWilliam Henry King underscores the elevation of concern in Shreveport as Union forces penetrate deeper into Louisiana:\n\n“This evening we get the intelligence to the effect that Alexandria has fallen into the hands of the Federals. The intelligence occasions a great stir. Thirty volunteers are called for to do temporary service on the gun boat, Missouri. Eleven of the post guard volunteer, but that lacks 19 of the required number. That 19 is not lacking long, for the guard house is called on, & the deficit is made at once. Some of the men were brought in & imprisoned to-day. That is the way it works.\"\n\nBack in Washington City, President Lincoln reflects once more on a familiar theme:\n\n“It needs not to be a secret, that I wish success to emancipation in Maryland. It would aid much to end the rebellion. Hence it is a matter of national consequence, in which every national man, may rightfully feel a deep interest.”\n\nMarch 18, 1864\n\nArkansas ratifies a state constitution that eliminates slavery from within its borders.\n\nMarch 19, 1864\n\nConsul Allen passes along word that has reached him of a scheme for Southerners posing as passengers to travel from Bermuda to New York City “for the purpose of shipping on board some of our steamers and capturing them if the opportunity offers or of working themselves into the favor of parties whereby they may be able to destroy government and other property.”\n\nMarch 20, 1864\n\nThe C.S.S. Alabama reaches Cape Town, South Africa, as it continues its operations against Union commerce.\n\nMarch 21, 1864\n\nJefferson Davis and a number of well-wishers greet returning prisoners. Of the interesting tableaux, J.B. Jones observes:\n\n“A large company of both sexes welcomed them in the Capitol Square, whither some baskets of food were sent by those who had some patriotism with their abundance. The President made them a comforting speech, alluding to their toils, bravery, and sufferings in captivity; and promised them, after a brief respite, that they should be in the field again.”\n\nAbraham Lincoln embodies the notion of “free labor” that has represented the bedrock of the Republican Party since its inception by explaining to an audience:\n\n“That some should be rich, shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprize.”\n\nMarch 22, 1864\n\nFrom Shreveport, La., King observes:\n\n“Gov. [Henry W.] Allen of this State has issued an order for the conscription of the free negroes of this place. When the Federals received negroes into their army the Southern press, & the Southern people in general, made a great ado about the matter. Now negroes are conscripted in the South, & I reckon that if the South urges any thing against the Federals on that score, it will be the ‘pot saying to the kettle, you are black.’”\n\nMarch 23, 1864\n\nIn the Confederate capital, prices soar and Ordnance Chief Josiah Gorgas terms these domestic conditions, “deplorable. Flour $300 the barrel. A shad costs $35. Turkey 5 to $9 per lb. Beef $5 to 6. Eggs, $7, and so on. How the poor live is incomprehensible. Even meal sells at $30. per bu.”\n\nEdmund Kirby Smith responds to the crisis in his region by issuing Special Order No. 71:\n\n“Shreveport and the adjoining country extending five miles beyond the fortifications, is declared an In-trenched Camp.”\n\nMarch 24, 1864\n\nOne of Nathan Bedford Forrest’s subordinates, Colonel William L. Duckworth, achieves a victory at Union City, in a raid in western Tennessee that results in the capture of Tennessee Unionist Isaac Hawkins and some 500 prisoners, with arms and supplies. The operation is already paying dividends in bolstering Forrest’s command and reputation, as well as in producing consternation among the Federals in the region and beyond.\n\nCump Sherman offers his brother, John, suggestions regarding General Grant:\n\n“Give Grant all the support you can. If he can escape the toils of the schemers he may do some good. He will fight, and the Army of the Potomac will have all the fighting they want. He will expect your friendship—We are close friends. His simplicity and modesty are natural & not affected.”\n\nIn his journal, W.H. King writes about the reactions locals have to captives that arrive in their midst:\n\n“Ten Federal prisoners brought in to-day. Five negroes brought in with them, but not taken from among the Federals. While guarding them, many crowded around, and declared the negroes ought to be killed. How inconsistent! It is but natural for them to desire to be free, & if they do nothing but runaway from their masters to obtain their freedom, certainly they do not merit death.”\n\nMarch 25, 1864\n\nForrest’s troopers reach Paducah, Kentucky, where stout resistance by land and water assets inflict a costly setback on the Confederates. Among the dead is Colonel A.P. Thompson, who perishes when he and his men impulsively try to storm Fort Anderson, a key earthwork on the outskirts of the town. That repulse and the heavy fire from two gunboats in the Ohio River, force the Southern horsemen to withdraw after having inflicted such damage as they can under the circumstances.\n\nMarch 26, 1864\n\nGeneral Grant is back in Virginia, after consulting with Sherman. He has decided to remain in the East, with the Army of the Potomac, which continues under the command of George Gordon Meade.\n\nMarch 27, 1864\n\nJosiah Gorgas ruminates on his service with the Confederate States of America and the young country’s prospects for the future on this Easter Sunday:\n\n“It is just three years ago to-day since I sent in my resignation in the U.S. Service. Another year of hard struggling will I hope serve to consolidate this Confederacy, & establish its right to enter the family of nations. Then it will I believe rapidly recover from the wounds it has received.”\n\nAt Johnson’s Island, Dooley remarks on religious matters and cannot help but take a swipe at his Protestant brethren:\n\n“Beautiful day. In the afternoon the Baptists, who are very numerous in the prison, immerse in the lake about 60 postulants—taking them into the lake up to breast high. . . . Looking at these drenched Baptists reminds me of the village-countryman who one day perceiving an old acquaintance of exceeding bad repute, undergoing a similar operation in the clutches of a Baptist minister, stopped his horse and sang out to the minister ‘I say mister, I don’t wish to interfere with any of your religious ceremonies but if you want to get all the sin out of that fellow, you’d better keep him under a thundering long time.”\n\nMarch 28, 1864\n\nJohn Dooley notes new developments for the Confederate prisoners:\n\n“[G]reat excitement around the sutler’s shed this morning. He has opened with a fresh supply. . . . [G]et a pound of butter @60cts.”\n\nMarch 29, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln responds to a sensitive George Meade over the appearance of criticisms concerning his performance at Gettysburg in the New York Herald and the general’s desire for official exoneration of his actions:\n\n“It is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not impressed, nor do I think the country is impressed, with the belief that your honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an Inquiry. The country knows that, at all events, you have done good service; and I believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you [to] be engaged in trying to do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a Court of Inquiry.”\n\nMarch 30, 1864\n\nHenri Garidel goes to his office in Richmond as usual, but shortages have limited any personal comforts:\n\n“We had no fire at our house because there was no coal.\"\n\nJ.B. Jones reports the latest developments:\n\n“Many ladies have been appointed clerks. There is a roomful of them just over the Secretary’s office, and he says they distract him with their noise of moving of chairs and running about, etc.\n\nThe papers publish an account of a battle of snow-balls in our army, which indicates the spirit of the troops, when, perhaps, they are upon the eve of passing through such awful scenes of carnage as will make the world tremble at the appalling spectacle.”\n\nMarch 31, 1864\n\nAfter a long stint on the South Carolina coast and some time in Ohio, Colonel Alvin Coe Voris notes that except for a corporal who had jumped from the train in an alcoholic stupor, the rest of the command arrived safely:\n\n“The men were kept so closely & quietly on the cars that the people of Pennsylvania thought we had a lot of rebel prisoners.”\n\nFrom Bermuda, Consul Allen provides the latest intelligence report:\n\n“The following steamers have left for Wilmington during the past few days, viz: Steamer A.D. Vance, Captain Wiley, a southern man left of the 26th. Steamer Minnie, Gilpin, an Englishman who has twice been captured left on the 27th.\n\nCaptain Beers [of the Greyhound] was formerly in our Navy. He is called the Admiral here and is considered the King of blockade runners. If he is captured he will claim to be an Englishman. . . .Captain [John N.] Maffit is still here waiting for a steamer. He is drunk the greater part of the time.”\n\nMay 1, 1864\n\nWilliam T. Sherman sends his daughter, Minnie, a letter as he contemplates the action that is shortly to come:\n\n“This is Sunday, May 1st. and a beautiful day it is. I have just come from a long ride over my Old Battle field of November 25th which is on a high Ridge about four or five miles from Chattanooga. The leaves are now coming out, and the young flowers have begun to bloom. I have gathered a few which I send you in token of my love, and to tell you I gathered them on the very spot where many a brave man died for you, and such as you.”\n\nTo his wife, Cump notes that he has sent bouquets to the girls, “and if any ill fate attend me in this, they will remember me by that. The weather is beautiful, and the Army is in fine condition. I did expect to have back more of the furloughed veterans, but it takes more time for them to assemble from their homes than we military minds calculate. . . .\n\nTomorrow I will be off & may not write for some time, but the telegraph will announce the result of our first Stops.”\n\nIn the border region of Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky, Edward Guerrant finds the climate less receptive to notions of blooming flowers and greening trees:\n\n“It feels more like Christmas Day than May Day! December than May!\n\nIt suggests to me that Western Virginia seasons run thus:\n\nWinter months—October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May.\n\nSpring months—June!\n\nSummer months—July & August!\n\nFall months—September!”\n\nConfederate war bureau chief Josiah Gorgas notes the sad state of affairs in the Confederate capital in the aftermath of the tragedy in Jefferson Davis’s family:\n\n“We attended this afternoon the funeral of one of the Presidents little boys (Joe), who was killed yesterday evening by a fall from the back piazza. . . . The President is very much attached to his children & very caressing toward them, and this is a heavy sorrow to him. Last winter I once saw him take this little fellow off to hear him say his prayers as he went to bed.”\n\nMay 2, 1864\n\nThe first session of the Second Congress of the Confederate States convenes. President Jefferson Davis offers an assessment on “the state of the country” in his opening address:\n\n“You are assembled under circumstances of deep interest to your country, and it is fortunate that, coming as you do newly elected by the people and familiar with the condition of the various localities, you will be the better able to devise measures adapted to the wants of the public service without imposing unnecessary burdens on the citizens.”\n\nMay 3, 1864\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln has reached a position on the Fort Pillow affair, which he communicates in a memorandum to his Cabinet:\n\n“It is now quite certain that a large number of our colored soldiers, with their white officers, were, by the rebel forces, massacred after they had surrendered, at the recent capture of Fort-Pillow. So much is known, though the evidence is not yet quite ready to be laid before me. Meanwhile I will thank you to prepare, and give me in writing your opinion as to what course the government should take in the case.”\n\nIn Virginia, Major Charles Mattocks of the 17th Maine records:\n\n“Everything indicates that we shall move at midnight. We are all ready, and men and officers carry eight days’ rations.”\n\nFrom Johnson’s Island, Confederate prisoner of war John Dooley observes:\n\n“My last letter home was destroyed by the Yankee official who deemed it contraband to say that I looked for peace very soon. The envelope was returned to me marked ‘contraband.’ I wonder if the ignoramus ever saw a dictionary. If so, I’m sure it was Webster’s.”\n\nFrom Bermuda, U.S. Consul Charles Maxwell Allen continues to keep Secretary of State William Seward informed of potential Confederate plots:\n\n“A large number of passengers, mostly Southerners, have recently gone from here to Halifax, and other places in the British Provinces. Many are still here without any ostensible business, their expenses being paid by Major Walker, the Confederate agent.”\n\nMay 4, 1864\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passes the Wade-Davis Bill.\n\nNed Guerrant records the essence of Davis’s address to the new Congress:\n\n“Paper contains a synopsis of Presidents Message to Congr. Short. Says no hope of foreign interference. Must fight it out ourselves.”\n\nDespite the other concerns that demand his attentions, Robert E. Lee issues General Orders, No. 38:\n\n“The great importance of protecting the agricultural interests of the country induces the commanding general to repeat the orders heretofore issued on the subject of preventing the injury or destruction of private property, and to require of all officers a vigorous enforcement of them during the coming campaign.”\n\nMay 5, 1864\n\nFighting begins in the Wilderness as George Meade offers Ulysses Grant his assurances concerning their vaunted opponent:\n\n“If he is disposed to fight this side of Mine Run at once, he shall be accommodated.”\n\nThe Army of the James reaches Bermuda Hundred and City Point with 40,000 men poised to strike toward the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad under Benjamin Butler.\n\nAfter receiving a request from President Lincoln for reviewing a decision on the removal of citizens, Sherman replies:\n\n“We have worked hard with the best talent of the country & it is demonstrated that the railroad cannot supply the army & the people too. one or the other must quit & the army don’t intend to unless Joe Johnston makes us. . . . I will not change my order and I beg of you to be satisfied that the clamor is partly a humbug & for effect, & to test it I advise you to tell the bearers of the appeal . . . to relieve their suffering friends on foot as they used to do before a railroad was built. Tell them they have no time to lose.”\n\nScrawling on paper “In bivouac on the slope of a Georgia Hill, 8 miles from Dalton,” Emerson Opdycke writes his wife Lucy to tell her that he has seen his commander, who shared a letter recently received from James Garfield:\n\n“G. says that ‘The Army of the Potomac seems perfect in all it’s appointments, but the habit of being beaten is a bad one’. Thinks greatest honors must rest upon the Western Armies; and that the fate of the Republic seems to depend upon the present campaigns.\n\nI enclose you a Georgia wild flower, it is pretty and fragrant. The weather is charming, roads perfect, and the troops resolved.”\n\nUnion and Confederate vessels, the latter including the ironclad Arkansas, clash in North Carolina waters. Little more can be accomplished by either side than an exchange of fire and the recapture of the steamer Bombshell from the Southerners.\n\nConstituting the most positive feeling, Mary Mallard asserts to Mary Jones from Atlanta:\n\n“We all fear the next terrible struggle, and I trust our people will not be so lifted up by our recent successes as to be led to vainglory and forgetfulness of our merciful Heavenly Father, the source of all blessings. . . . No one seems to apprehend any danger for this place, for falling back is not General Johnston’s policy.”\n\nMay 6, 1864\n\nUnion troops push Confederates from Tunnel Hill, Ga.\n\nThe fighting between Lee and Grant has cost the Federals 2,246 killed, 12,037 wounded and 3,383 missing or captured as opposed to total Confederate losses of 7,500, but the numbers represent significant attrition for the Army of Northern Virginia that it cannot easily recover, including the wounding of James Longstreet.\n\nGrant reacts to the harrowing engagement that has been the Wilderness by continuing to consider the ways that he can move forward against Lee, telling his aid, Horace Porter, as they pour over a map together:\n\n“I do not hope to gain any decided advantage from the fighting in this forest. . . . I can certainly drive Lee back into his works, but I shall not assault him there; he would have all the advantage in such a fight. If he falls back and entrenches, my notion is to move promptly toward the left. This will, in all probability, compel him to try and throw himself between us and Richmond, and in such a moment I hope to be able to attack him in a more open country, and outside of his breastworks.”\n\nThe normally pious Guerrant holds out hope for what Robert E. Lee can accomplish against Ulysses Grant:\n\n“Genl. Lee’s rough, war-worn hand is laid mightily upon the early blooming laurels of the victor at Donelson & the besieger of Vicksburg! and they wither and perish in his grasp.\n\nIf that page be so, the great idol & hero of the lionizing, foolish North, is ‘damned to everlasting fame,” & his blasted name is added to the . . . catalogue of McDowell, Scott, McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, & Meade!”\n\nNow a prisoner, Charles Mattocks, finds himself relieved of “a nice new poncho, but, before the wise [Southern] youth got his clutches upon this same article the former, and only genuine, proprietor, had easily managed unobserved to make a few damaging incisions with his pocket knife, the better to impress upon the youth the fact that stolen blankets will leak. I do not wish to be revengeful, but should he chance to lie down with this same blanket for protection in a rain storm, I would not wish to interfere with the course of nature, which perhaps might cause a few refreshing drops of water to pass through the holes I made.”\n\nBenjamin Butler sends troops toward the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, hoping to disrupt the line supporting the Confederate capital.\n\nMay 7, 1864\n\nButler’s men seize Port Walthall Junction.\n\nWar clerk John Beauchamp Jones notes the degree to which Richmond remains on edge awaiting developments:\n\n“But there is more anxiety manifested to-day. . . .\n\n5 P.M. The tocsin is sounding, for the militia, I suppose, all others being in the field. It is reported that the attack on Drewry’s Bluff, or rather on our forces posted there for its defense, has begun.\n\nThere is now some excitement and trepidation among the shopkeepers and extortioners, who are compelled by State law to shoulder the musket for the defense of the city, and there is some running to and fro preliminary to the rendezvous in front of the City Hall.”\n\nUnion brigadier general Samuel Sturgis expresses his profound regret in not having forced Nathan Bedford Forrest into an engagement, telling his superior in Memphis, Tenn.:\n\n“Although we could not catch the scoundrel we are at least rid of him, and that is something.”\n\nFrom Bermuda, Consul C.M. Allen reports on increased Confederate activity:\n\n“The steamer Index, before reported by me as supposed to have been lost at sea has arrived here on the third instant from Wilmington with 770 bales [of] cotton. She now has her outward cargo on board and will leave here today. She has some large guns on board. . . .Some twenty vessels laden with coal are now afloat here, and there is now landed at this port of Saint George’s some thirty to thirty five thousand tons of coal for the use of the Confederates and blockade runners. There is no doubt they expect to do a large business here the coming summer. Eight vessels with coal from Cardiff arrived during the past week, report says from fifty to sixty more are on the passage here now.”\n\nMay 8, 1864\n\nAfter the harsh struggle in the Wilderness finally subsides, the opposing forces converge on Spotsylvania Court House, Va.\n\nCharles Mattocks is on his way southward:\n\n“At 2 o’clock this afternoon we started by cars for Lynchburg, which is to be our stopping place for some time. They talk of sending us to Georgia subsequently. We prefer that to the ‘Hotel de Libby’ at Richmond.”\n\nAlong the route, the prisoners experienced an unexpected treat:\n\n“The young ladies at the Seminary at Charlottesville, seeing us coming on the cars, took us for Confederate soldiers, and began to rush down across the fields toward us, scaling fences with more celerity and vigor than feminine modesty would dictate or allow perhaps under ordinary circumstances. On they came, a perfect avalanche of petticoats and crinoline, waving handkerchiefs and screeching like mad, when suddenly they discovered that they were making all this ado about a few ‘Yankee prisoners,’ ugh!! Such screeches and such skaling of fences I never saw, and such skedaddling back. They surpassed the Rocky Mountain Sheep. It was now our turn to cheer and yell, which we did as much to their disgust as it was to our own delight.”\n\nA Confederate in Georgia confides in his diary: \"We are again on the 'war-path.'\"\n\nThe number of Union prisoners at Camp Sumter/Andersonville has reached 12,213.\n\nMay 9, 1864\n\nJames McPherson moves through Snake Creek Gap, but fails to sever the rail line that will cut off Johnston at Dalton.\n\nEmerson Opdycke is “In the midst of a sharp skirmish, On ‘Rocky Face Ridge’ 11:30 A.M.” when he pauses to send another message to his wife about his latest activities:\n\n“The Ridge is five hundred feet high, twice as difficult of ascent as Mission Ridge, and then only a narrow back bone of boulders to move upon, after reaching it.\"\n\nIn Virginia, Major General John Sedgwick dies when a Confederate sharpshooter’s bullet finds him after he had declared definitively to men he found crouching to avoid small arms fire, “They couldn’t hit an elephant at this distance.”\n\nOf the situation in Central Virginia, a member of the Stonewall Bridge observes simply, “Wonder what General Grant thinks of Mister Bob today? Here he is right in his way to Richmond.”\n\nP.G.T. Beauregard arrives at Petersburg to defend this region against Butler’s Bermuda Hundred Campaign.\n\nButler presses the Confederate lines behind Swift Creek in Virginia. A Confederate counterattack fails, but the Southerners enjoy greater success at nearby Fort Clifton.\n\nA sharp engagement occurs at Cloyd’s Mountain between 6,500 Union troops under Brigadier General George Crook and 2,400 Confederates under Brigadier General Albert G. Jenkins. The Southerners sustain 538 casualties, including Jenkins, who will lose an arm and his life. The Federals suffer the loss of 688 men.\n\nConfederate major general Stephen Dill Lee assumes command of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana.\n\nMay 10, 1864\n\nEmory Upton’s troops penetrate the Confederate defenses at the “Mule Shoe” salient at Spotsylvania. The brutal fighting ends as John B. Gordon seals the breach and Lee’s harried veterans throw up new lines to confront their foes and limit their gains.\n\nBrigadier General Robert Ransom attacks Union troops defending the rail line at Chester Station, Va.\n\nIn southwestern Virginia, Brigadier General William W. Averell threatens Wytheville and its vital lead production, but Brigadier General William E. “Grumble” Jones repulses the effort at Cove Mountain.\n\nMay 11, 1864\n\nUnion and Confederate cavalry clash at Yellow Tavern. In the swirling combat, Jeb Stuart suffers a critical wound to the lower extremities that will doubtless prove mortal.\n\nJosiah Gorgas notes the atmosphere in Richmond:\n\n“The day has been one of the greatest excitement. I slept but a few hours last night having been called up by messages, and kept awake by the ringing of alarm bells & the blowing of alarm whistles the most of the night. At 5 this morning I went to Mr. [James] Seddon’s office and found him laboring under the impression that the last hours of Richmond were at length numbered. The entire cavalry force of Meade’s army were reported to be rapidly approaching the devoted city from the direction of Ashland, with Stuart at their heels it is true, but having a good deal the start of him.”\n\nMay 12, 1864\n\nJ.B. Jones notes the lamentable weather—“Thunder, lightning, and rain all day”—as well as the news of the famed “Bold Cavalier’s” fate:\n\n“Major-Gen. J.E.B. Stuart was wounded last evening, through the kidney, and now lies in the city, in a dying condition! Our best generals thus fall around us.\"\n\n“Bloody Angle” enters the lexicon for Spotsylvania as Union and Confederate troops vie with each other for control of a relatively limited stretch of breastworks. Losses for the bluecoats will approach 6,800 and not much less for their grayclad counterparts. One Confederate sums the frustration he and his comrades face in U.S. Grant: “We have met a man this time, who either does not know when he is whipped, or who cares not if he loses his whole Army.”\n\nBenjamin Butler sends Major General William F. “Baldy” Smith toward Drewry’s Bluff. The move is meant, in part, to divert Confederate attention from a cavalry raid against the Richmond and Danville Railroad under Brigadier General August Kautz.\n\nJoseph Johnston has awakened to the threat that a turning movement poses to his strong works in the Dalton area, opting to withdraw from them.\n\nFrom Atlanta, Mary Mallard remains optimistic, if beginning to show a hint of concern:\n\n“We will be in a dreadful predicament should General Johnston be unsuccessful or be compelled to fall back, but no one seems to contemplate this. All have the utmost confidence in his skill.”\n\nMay 13, 1864\n\nAt 9:00 A.M. Oliver O. Howard’s men occupy Dalton.\n\nButler tries additional probing with Major General Quincy Gillmore’s command.\n\nIn Richmond, War clerk Jones observes of the unsettling conditions:\n\n“Most of the Members of Congress, when not in session, hang about the door and hall of the War Department, eager for news. But the wires are cut in all directions, and we must rely on couriers.\n\nGeneral Bragg is very distasteful to many officers of the army; and the croakers and politicians would almost be willing to see the government go to pieces, to get rid of the President and his cabinet. Some of the members of Congress are anxious to get away, and the Examiner twits them for their cowardice. They will stay, probably.”\n\nJudith McGuire recalls the last moments of General Stuart as recounted to her, drawing inspiration from it while recognizing the sense of loss the Confederacy is experiencing:\n\n“Thus passed away our great cavalry general, just one year after the immortal Jackson. This seems darkly mysterious to us, but God’s will be done. The funeral took place this evening, from St. James Church. My duty to the living prevented my attending it, for which I am very sorry; but I was in the hospital from three o’clock until eight, soothing the sufferers in the only way I could, by fanning them, bathing their wounds, and giving them a word of comfort.”\n\nNathaniel Banks pulls out of Alexandria, La., leaving behind much of the town as a smoldering ruin.\n\nMay 14, 1864\n\nUnion troops probe Confederate lines near Resaca, Ga.\n\nOne of the defenders notes the need for improving the works, which had consisted only of \"piles of rail and logs not capable of resisting shells.\" In fairly short order, \"we had pretty good works; and just in time for about that hour our skirmishers (co. a) were driven in, the men skirmishing beautifully. Soon after two lines of battle burst out of the woods in front of us, and started up, on the charge. We soon commenced 'saluting' them.\"\n\nMay 15, 1864\n\nFighting continues near, Resaca as the two sides grapple with each other, searching for an advantage. Union surgeon John Bennitt passes word of casualties among the officer ranks in the regiment to his wife: “13 of 19th Mich killed—& 68 wounded—10 Dangerously 8 Seriously—30 painfully not Seriously—18 Slightly. Col. [Henry] Gilbert Dangerously, Capt [Charles] Calmer killed, Capt. [Samuel] Hubbard slightly. . . . About 600 of 3rd Div wounded & killed.\" The combat here has produced 2,747 Union and approximately 2,800 Confederate casualties.\n\nIn the Shenandoah Valley, Confederate troops under John C. Breckinridge confront Union forces under Franz Sigel at New Market, Va. Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute join the fray. Sigel retreats with 93 killed, 482 wounded and 256 missing or captured to 42 killed, 522 wounded and 13 missing for their adversaries. The VMI element has lost 10 killed and 47 wounded among their number.\n\nJ.B. Jones offers an assessment of the state of race and war in the Confederate capital:\n\n“Most of the able-bodied negro men, both free and slave, have been taken away—in the field as teamsters, or digging on the fortifications. Yet those that remain may sometimes be seen at the street corners looking, some wistfully, some in dread, in the direction of the enemy. There is but little fear of an insurrection, though no doubt the enemy would be welcomed by many of the negroes, both free and slave.”\n\nMay 16, 1864\n\nAt 9:00 A.M., George Thomas’s men advance into Resaca and begin to repair the crossing of the Oostanaula River.\n\nFighting occurs around Drewry’s Bluff, Va., as Beauregard launches attacks to keep his opponents off-balance. William H.S. Burgwyn records his participation in dramatic tones:\n\n“About three hundred yards from our breastworks and fearing that the enemy fire and the bad ground might throw them into confusion, I seized the colors of the 51st North Carolina Regiment and called on the men to follow. Running in advance I came in about three hundred yards to the enemy’s first line of rifle pits or breastworks made of rails, logs, etc. Mounting them and waving the colors I jumped on the other side and pushed forward closely followed by the men. . . .”\n\nMay 17, 1864\n\nConfederate defenders appear ready to make a stand at Adairsville, Ga., but after a period of exchanging fire, Johnston determines that the position is not suitable for defense and falls back once more.\n\nIn Richmond, Judith McGuire reports:\n\n“For some days the cannon has been resounding in our ears, from the south side of the James River. Colonel [James] Garnett has come in to tell us that for the first two days there was only heavy skirmishing, but that on yesterday there was a terrific fight all along the lines. Yesterday a brigadier, his staff, and 840 men, were lodged in the Libby Prison.”\n\nMay 18, 1864\n\nSturgis laments over his lack of success in forcing a confrontation with Nathan Bedford Forrest to Sherman:\n\n“My little campaign is over, and I regret to say that Forrest is still at large. . . . I regret very much that I could not have the pleasure of bringing you his hair, but he is too great a plunderer to fight anything like an equal force, and we have to be satisfied with driving him from the State.”\n\nUndoubtedly, as Sherman advances in Georgia he will not be so easily satisfied, especially when Sturgis adds that Forrest will likely “turn on your communications. . . but I see no way to prevent it from this point with this force.\"\n\nBrigadier General Joseph Mower covers Banks’ retreat at Yellow Bayou, La.\n\nMay 19, 1864\n\nLee is aware that Grant is considering another flanking movement and sends Ewell’s corps to verify his suspicions. The Southern troops encounter Union forces, largely composed to men who had served as heavy artillerists around Washington City and now act as infantry. The fighting is heavy, as attested by 1,500 Union and 900 Confederate casualties.\n\nJoseph Johnston wants to strike at Sherman near Cassville, Ga., but missteps by John Bell Hood negate the opportunity.\n\nMary Mallard assesses the progress of the armies in Georgia:\n\n“Our army has been steadily falling back for a week past in order to gain good fighting ground and a position that cannot be flanked. The men are in the highest spirits, and express the utmost confidence in General Johnston. . . . Our army has had continued skirmishing—or rather it ought to be called a succession of small battles; and in every instance the Yankees have been handsomely repulsed with great slaughter. . . . Already about two thousand five hundred wounded have been brought down.\n\nThe relief committees from this place, Macon, Alabama, Florida, and elsewhere have all come up, and are very active in their attentions to the wounded. They seem to be provided with almost everything. . . . Poor fellows, they seem so glad to get it.”\n\nMay 20, 1864\n\nGeneral Orders, No. 44, circulate from Army of Northern Virginia Headquarters, lamenting the loss of Jeb Stuart:\n\n“Among the gallant soldiers who have fallen in this war General Stuart was second to none in valor, in zeal, and in unfaltering devotion to his country. His achievements form a conspicuous part of the history of this army, with which his name and services will be forever associated. . . . To his comrades in arms he has left the proud recollection of his deeds, and the inspiring influence of his example. R.E. Lee, General.”\n\nMary Mallard continues to put the best face on the otherwise disturbing developments in Georgia:\n\n“Of course it is an anxious time with us all, and a time for earnest prayer. If General Johnston is victorious, the Yankees must suffer terribly. All think he is able and will follow up any advantage he may gain.\"\n\nMay 21, 1864\n\nMajor General David Hunter replaces Franz Sigel as commander of the Department of West Virginia.\n\nAlvin Voris tells his wife:\n\n“My boys took Major Gen. [William S.] Walker yesterday, breaking his leg so as to require amputation. I have his sword as a trophy of the fight. I will send it to you as soon as opportunity offers.”\n\nIn Marietta, Ga., Mary Robarts is decidedly worried about the advancing Union tide:\n\n“The army is now on this side of the Etowah River. The families from above are fleeing before the enemy—the streets filled with all sorts of vehicles, people moving their property of all kinds . . . . And the stampede has commenced in Marietta: streets filled with movables, neighbors packing and going off.\n\nMy dear cousin, we were constantly assured the Yankees would never get here!\n\nBut, oh, those horrid Yankees! How can I see them enter this place and live?”\n\nMay 22, 1864\n\nSherman shifts away from the strong position Johnston has taken up at Allatoona Pass, rather than threaten it directly with assault.\n\nFrom Hanover Junction, Richard Ewell writes his wife, Lizinka:\n\n“You see we are coming nearer—not because Grant drives us but because while keeping up a show in front, he tries to dodge around us. He got the start yesterday, but by marching all night & this morning I am again in front & the rest of the army well up.”\n\nOff Brazos, Texas, U.S.S. Stingaree switched flags three times as the Confederates first captured, then lost her.\n\nMay 23, 1864\n\nAfter the protracted combat at Spotsylvania, Lee is in position at the North Anna River to strike at Grant if an opportunity presents itself.\n\nBraxton Bragg orders Major General Fitzhugh Lee to proceed to Wilson’s Wharf, where Butler has detailed a number of African American troops and “break up the nest.” By 4:00 PM, Lee is on his way with 2,500 men to accomplish the mission.\n\nU.S.S. Columbine falls to Confederates in Florida.\n\nMay 24, 1864\n\nIn the morning, General Lee testily confronts A.P. Hill on his apparent failure to prevent Union forces under Gouverneur Warren from crossing the North Anna: “General Hill, why did you let those people cross here? Why didn’t you throw your whole force on them and drive them back as Jackson would have done?”\n\nThen in the afternoon, Lee is stricken with gastrointestinal issues that confine him to his tent. He knows that his acute distress is particularly ill-timed, given the configuration of the opposing forces at the North Anna River. But, all he can do is groan, “We must strike them a blow. We must never let them pass us again. We must strike them a blow.”\n\nIn the confused fighting that characterized this phase of the Virginia campaign, a Union soldier watches as Confederates close on his position. “What is it Jack?” he asks of a comrade. “Legs or Richmond?” The men promptly choose to allow Richmond to wait for another time as they scramble for the rear.\n\nFitzhugh Lee’s force reaches Wilson’s Wharf at mid-day. Earthworks and the Union gunboat Dawn suggest the difficulty of the encounter for the grayclad horsemen. Lee attempts to effect a surrender, but Brigadier General Edward Wild declines: “Take the fort if you can.” Following the repulse of attacks and the arrival of Union reinforcements, the Confederates break off the assault and retire.\n\nColonel Voris assesses the Bermuda Hundred Campaign in which he has been a participant:\n\n“I am fearful that Gen. Butler is a failure, nor is this to be wondered at. He has had no military experience in the field. His operations in the early stages of the war were not of such a sort as to develop skill & ability for operations of the kind undertaken by his army. That he has acquired reputation as a General is true, but it has been rather on account of administrative ability connected with civil than military matters. To me it is singular that the War Department should entrust to such a Gen the supreme command of as important an enterprise as this against whom it could only have expected the best talent of the Confederacy must be arrayed, fortified by the practical experience of three years’ service in the field. It was easy to gain reputation in the earlier stages of the war. The blunders & want of experience of our commanders was overlooked by equally blundering and inexperienced tyros in the Confederacy. But it is not so now. . . .\n\nWe are virtually besieged on the little isthmus known as Bermuda Hundred.”\n\nMay 25, 1864\n\nMajor General Joseph Hooker confronts the Confederates at New Hope Church, Ga. in the mistaken belief that John Bell Hood’s men represent the Army of Tennessee’s flank. Racked by fire from Major General A.P. Stewart’s troops and Southern artillery, the attacks crumble as the losses mount. A thunderstorm underscores the nature of the combat that has left some 1,600 Union and 350 Confederate casualties.\n\nGrant pulls back from his exposed position at North Anna, and determines his next flanking movement.\n\nAlso in Virginia, Ordnance Chief Josiah Gorgas watches events unfold in Georgia with thinly veiled disdain:\n\n“Johnston verifies all our predictions of him. He is falling back just as fast as his legs carry him. . . . Where will he stop heaven only knows.”\n\nMay 26, 1864\n\nThe Territory of Montana is formed.\n\nDick Ewell takes a moment to remind his wife that he has not forgotten the first anniversary of their marriage before turning to other matters:\n\n“We are still in juxtaposition with the Yankees—mutually watching—they entrenched so strongly as to make it impossible to attack any part of their lines on this flank, while they are equally afraid to come against us. This will probably continue untill they take advantage of darkness to past across our flank when we will be forced to move back again to get in their front. We are getting too near Richmond for this to continue much more & one side or the other will have to change tactics & go at it ‘hammer & tongs.’ The idea of their reaching Richmond is too terrible to think of. . . .”\n\nAfter keeping his wife informed of his progress following a severe wounding on May 14, Emerson Opdycke lets her know that he is back in command of his troops, “’In line’, awaiting the Conflict, near Dallas”:\n\n“Our great army is moving into positions for a battle. Skirmishing is going on briskly and the balls whiz over our heads frequently. . . . My arm is doing admirably, but I have not much use of it yet.”\n\nMay 27, 1864\n\nUnion troops endure a vicious pounding in the thickets and ravines of Pickett’s Mill, Ga. Major General Patrick Cleburne’s men inflict the greatest damage, costing the Federals 1,600 men against 450 casualties of their own.\n\nMay 28, 1864\n\nThe third engagement in this phase of the Atlanta Campaign, Dallas, Ga. becomes the scene of a bloody Confederate repulse when Brigadier General William Bate hurls his men against the trenches of James McPherson’s bluecoats. Inflicting only about 380 casualties on the Federals, Bates’s men suffer over 1,000 in the setback.\n\nOpposing cavalry forces clash at Haw’s Shop, Va., producing 344 Union and 400 Confederate casualties.\n\nMay 29, 1864\n\nIn the wake of the combat at Dallas, Michigan doctor William Bennitt recounts the losses in his regiment, but concludes:\n\n“Our men are feeling what it is to be soldiers now—May God spare us this kind of experience long.”\n\nJosiah Gorgas summarizes the fate of the Federal’s Red River Campaign and the supply situation in the Confederacy:\n\n“From the Red River we hear that Banks has escaped with most of his army and fleet. The latter was Saved by building a dam across the river below the falls & then raising the water so that the vessels could float out over the rapids where they were caught by the low water. If our boats had been so caught, we should simply have blown them up.\n\nTrains laden with corn are constantly arriving. The fear of Starvation has therefore nearly subsided. Four vessels have arrived thro’ the blockade at Wilmington.”\n\nEmerson Opdycke relates a conversation between his men and opposing troops from Louisiana:\n\n“Our boys asked ‘When are you going to ‘light out’ of here?’ Rebs replied ‘Lighting out, is played out; we’ve got our place now,’ and they chatted together pleasantly for some time.”\n\nP.G. T. Beauregard is concerned that fraternization has reduced the effectiveness of his command and that a refocusing on matters of military order and discipline is necessary:\n\n“It having been reported to these headquarters that our pickets and skirmishers have allowed those of the enemy to advance to within a very short distance of our lines, and that the pickets of the two lines are becoming too familiar, it is hereby ordered that no communication whatever should be had between our pickets and those of the enemy. The latter must be fired upon whenever they are seen within range of our guns; due precaution, however, being taken to prevent a waste of ammunition. . . . This order is dictated by a stern military necessity, as the forbidden practice affords positive advantages to the enemy in procuring information and directing his force; but even if this necessity did not exist, the commanding general still deeply deplores the moral disgrace incurred by his troops in anything like voluntary or unnecessary association with the savage foes who are not only warring against us, but persecuting our women and children, and destroying private property. The hands of such a foe are unworthy the friendly or courteous touch of a Confederate soldier.”\n\nMay 30, 1864\n\nUnion pressure continues in the area of Totopotomoy Creek in Virginia. His fighting blood up once more, Lee recognizes that dramatic steps must be taken to turn back the Union thrust toward Richmond.\n\nRobert Garlick Hill Kean comments on relationships in the highest echelons of the Confederate government:\n\n“There is a stir in our cabinet. [Secretary of the Treasury Christopher] Memminger is said to have handed in his resignation. . . . Mr. Seddon is much disgusted with his position. In a conversation, a friend told me yesterday that he complained heavily that the President was the most difficult man to get along with he had ever seen. If the President cannot get on with a man as smooth and yielding as Mr. Seddon, nobody can please him.”\n\nMay 31, 1864\n\nSince the beginning of the month, the armies of Lee and Grant have engaged each other almost incessantly in the Overland Campaign. The combatants have now reached the vicinity of Cold Harbor, Va., east of Richmond.\n\nJune 1, 1864\n\nThe opposing armies confront each other in the vicinity of Old Cold Harbor. One of the men impacted on this day is Captain William H.S. Burgwyn of North Carolina:\n\n“We had not charged but about fifty yards (and I in front of the 51st Regiment and near the colors) when I received a tremendous blow which struck me I thought about the knee making me fall like an ox and suffering intense pain. . . . About 11:00 p.m. Dr. Tamill, Division Surgeon, and Dr. Morrisey, Brigade Surgeon, put me under the influence of chloroform and probed and dressed my wound which they told me had struck about one-half inch below the right knee planing the bone and passed out making a painful but not dangerous wound. . . . Was struck about 7:00 p.m. while charging and driving the enemy.”\n\nUnion cavalry under George Stoneman skirts the principal lines and seizes the critical Allatoona Pass, opening the more traditional line of approach for Sherman along the Western and Atlantic Railroad toward Kennesaw Mountain, Marietta and Atlanta.\n\nLouisiana exile Henri Garidel despairs of the fate of the Confederate capital as Grant closes on the city:\n\n“The enemy is nine miles from Richmond. . . . . The cannon fire was over, but Richmond is still on the alert and alive with movement. People are preparing themselves. I think we will soon be overrun by Yankees, and if the Yankees take Richmond, two-thirds of the population will take the oath. That’s my opinion.”\n\nJune 2, 1864\n\nThe forces continue to solidify their positions at Cold Harbor, while Sherman is on the move in Georgia. In the Valley of Virginia, William E. “Grumble” Jones is preparing to face David Hunter.\n\nPresident Lincoln grants Charles H. Jonas a three week parole from the prison camp at Johnson’s Island to visit his dying father in Illinois.\n\nJune 3, 1864\n\nCold Harbor enters the pages of bloody assaults in a war replete with them as Ulysses S. Grant unleashes an attack that he hopes will penetrate and destroy Robert E. Lee’s defenses. But the Southern troops are well entrenched, protected by obstructions and head-logs against just such a Union thrust. The effort opens at 4:30 A.M. and quickly devolves into a vicious storm of shot and shell that cuts men down in droves. Some 7,000 Federals will be lost before Grant determines that the attempt cannot succeed and calls off the attacks at noon.\n\nAt the same time that Grant tests the Confederate works at Cold Harbor, Abraham Lincoln forwards his unequivocal support for his general and the strategy he is employing to win the war:\n\n“My previous high estimate of Gen. Grant has been maintained and heightened by what has occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting; while the magnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than I expected. He and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great trial. . . .”\n\nFrom Richmond, Louisiana refugee Henri Garidel awaits developments:\n\n\"We went to mass to the sound of horrible cannonading. The battle has been going on since 4:30. It is really frightening to hear it.”\n\nFederal troops are in Acworth, Georgia, pushing closer toward Atlanta.\n\nConfederate raiders capture the Union vessel Water Witch, on the Georgia coast.\n\nJune 4, 1864\n\nIt is raining in Georgia, but Joseph Johnston must react to the latest of Sherman’s moves. He shifts his line to prepared defenses on Lost, Pine and Brush (Brushy) mountains in an effort to continue to block his adversary’s approach.\n\nJosiah Gorgas rides out to examine the battlefields and entrenchments outside Richmond, concluding that the Confederate soldiery has begun to display a different attitude when it comes to self-preservation:\n\n“They have acquired quite a respect for this sort of intrenchment, & work like beavers when they take up a new position. They began the war with a contempt for the Spade, but now thoroughly believe in it.”\n\nRiding with John Hunt Morgan into Kentucky, the weather presents the greatest challenges for the moment to Edward O. Guerrant and his comrades.\n\n“Day woke with tears in her eyes & soon commence crying good. Our journey lay 30 miles down the everlasting ‘Troublesome.’ It was a Troublesome Creek, a Troublesome Way, a Troublesome Journey, a Troublesome Troublesome! AWFUL travelling on our horses. Stopped a moment at Forks of Troublesome to see our column properly formed.\n\nAfter great difficulty & hard travelling—which broke down dozens of horses, we stopped for the night at Mrs. Holladay’s a war widow, or one who husband is ‘I don’t know where’—i.e. Yankee Army.”\n\nU.S. Consul Charles M. Allen reports to his government on Confederate blockade-running activities in Bermuda, noting particularly:\n\n\"Steamer Lynx arrived today from Wilmington with 600 bales of cotton, having been chased by a U.S. gunboat and having thrown overboard about 100 bales cotton.”\n\nJune 5, 1864\n\nHeavy fighting characterizes the attempt by Grumble Jones to stop David Hunter’s advance at Piedmont. With a smaller force, Jones can only hope to achieve his goal, but is killed in the engagement that ends with the rout of his command and the loss of some 1,600 men, the bulk of whom become captives. Hunter’s men suffer 780 casualties, but now have an open road to Staunton.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Ned Guerrant is finding the indications of the hard warfare of the border areas.\n\n“On Troublesome passed a burning house, where [Thomas] Chenoweth’s men had been after a bushwhacker.\n\nWe have been compelled to take most everything to eat, meat & meal that we have found on our line of march. Our rations are out & tonight some of our Battns. are without food & poor prospect of any tomorrow.”\n\nDaniel William Cobb is experiencing a different aspect of the war in Southampton County, Virginia:\n\n“The Crual war has reduced our Table to no Shugar & Coffee no flower. No flesh for brexfast & Supper only Meats for Dinner, & Curtailed other things also My wife falts & Grumbles at me heavy about the preshure of the war scarsety in madness[.]”\n\nCharles Mattocks sits in a prison camp in Macon, Georgia, admittedly a long way from his prewar home in Maine and from Richmond, where he was captured:\n\n“One month ago today I bid farewell to liberty. One month ago we were 800 miles away [from Georgia], battling with the enemy near the Rapidan. . . . In prison life ‘drags its weary length along.’ It is a rare place for character to discover itself. . . .\n\nFor the past week I have been more dead than alive, with an attack of ‘Prison Fever,’ very similar to the illness a recruit in the army has to go through.”\n\nIn Louisiana, William Henry King, reads news of recent developments in Georgia:\n\n“Another Extra is out to-day from which I learn that Gen’l Johnston has fallen back to Atlanta, Georgia, but is certain of an overwhelming victory. Yes, our reporters and news mongers are always ‘certain’ of some grand achievement whether it be achieved or not. I have great confidence in Gen’l Johnston, but I fear this is one ‘chicken counted before it hatched.’”\n\nJune 6, 1864\n\nJosiah Gorgas contemplates Grant’s options as he sees them:\n\n“Grant seems inclined to try a passage of the Chickahominy at Bottom’s bridge. What good that would do him is the question. It brings him further from instead of nearer to Richmond. He is now as near as he ever will be, I trust. Getting over to Butler & taking Petersburgh from below City Point might annoy us, but would hardly advance his object. I think he is at his wit’s end.”\n\nJune 7, 1864\n\nThe National Union Convention meets in Baltimore, Maryland, to select a slate and establish a platform for the coming fall presidential election.\n\nIn southeastern Virginia, farmer Cobb continues to focus on his production, while keeping an eye on the progress of the war near Richmond. “4 ploughs going. . . . My hoe hands finished han thining my Cotton & gorn to weading Corn. I finished shering sheap at 10.”\n\nJune 8, 1864\n\nLincoln’s name receives the nod for a second term in office as president. The military governor of Tennessee, Andrew Johnson, will assume the vice presidential slot for this ticket. Current occupant Hannibal Hamlin has support at the convention, but the vote moves in Johnson’s direction and he secures the nomination.\n\nMorgan captures Mount Sterling, Kentucky, but the action turns into something of a bank robbing spree as much as it has a martial firefight.\n\nThe losses of wartime become personal for Edward Guerrant as he receives word of the death of his brother to disease:\n\n“Marshall Guerrant dead! Dead!—The tears of a brother suffuse my eyes when I write that name, & try to realize that all that was noble, & generous & manly, once answering to it, has sunk beyond my gaze forever! O my brother, my brother! A grief deeper than the fountains of tears, and the power of language wrings my heart for thee!”\n\nThe news is difficult for Daniel Cobb as well:\n\n“I hurd from Lees Arm to day Lee has drove Grant 12 miles back to White House 1 killed & 3 woundes of Com a 13 Vir Calv J Drewey Killed Capt Wills shot threw the Loongs Asbury Cobb slight wound of the wrist Holland in leg it Cut off Cruell times.”\n\nJune 9, 1864\n\nLincoln responds to the notification of his renomination:\n\n“I will neither conceal my gratification, nor restrain the expression of my gratitude, that the Union people, through their convention, in their continued effort to save, and advance the nation, have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my present position.”\n\nPondering a plank in the platform regarding a Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery, the President adds:\n\n“When the people in revolt, with a hundred days of explicit notice, that they could, within those days, resume their allegiance, without the overthrow of their institution, and that they could not so resume it afterwards, elected to stand out, such amendment of the Constitution as now proposed, became a fitting, and necessary conclusion to the final success of the Union cause.”\n\nLincoln exhibits his usual sense of humor in a communication to a delegation from the National Union League:\n\n“I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded, in this connection, of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once that ‘it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams.’”\n\nFrom his headquarters at Acworth, Georgia, William T. Sherman tries to allay the concerns of the “young lady” who plans to marry his friend and trusted subordinate, James McPherson, that he is too consumed with the war to pay appropriate attention to her:\n\n“His rise in his profession has been rapid steady and well earned, not a link unbroken, not a thing omitted. Each step in his progress however has imposed on him fresh duties that as a man and a Soldier and still more as a Patriot he could not avoid.\n\nThere is no rest for us in this war till you and all can look about you and feel there is Peace & Safety in the Land. God purifies the atmosphere with tempests and Storms which fall alike upon the just and unjust, and in like manner he appeases the jarring Elements of political discord, by wars and famine.\n\nBe patient and I Know that when the happy day comes for him to Stand by your side as one Being identical in heart & human Existence you will regard him with a high respect & honor that will convert Simple love into Something sublime & beautiful[.]”\n\nSherman also takes the occasion to write his own wife, suggesting that everything is proceeding according to his larger vision:\n\n“Johnston may fight us at the Ridge of hills just this Side of Marietta, but I think I can dislodge him and this will leave the Great Battle on or near the Chattahoochee the passage of which he must dispute. . . . He thinks he checked us at Dallas. I went there to avoid the Alatoona Pass, and as soon as I had drawn his Army there I Slipped my Cavalry into Alatooma Pass & moved the main army in its front a perfect success. I never designed to attack his hastily prepared works at Dallas and New Hope Church, and as soon as he saw I was making for the Railroad around his Right flank he abandoned his works and we occupied them for a moment and moved by the best Roads to our present position. We have captured several of their mails and it is wonderful to See how the soldiers talk of driving me back to the Ohio, and their returning to their Loving families in Tennessee and Kentucky. I fear they Count without their host. . . .\n\nBut of course the Real Battle is not yet fought—when it does come I will take good care to have it a big & decisive one.”\n\nA quick thrust by Quincy Gillmore at Petersburg ends when former governor and Confederate brigadier general Henry Wise pulls together enough “old men and young boys” to hold the powerful Dimmock Line. The effort produces 52 casualties for the Federals and 75 for Wise’s defenders.\n\nJune 10, 1864\n\nThe Confederate Congress expands the age range for military service to seventeen and fifty.\n\nIn Mississippi, Nathan Bedford Forrest wins perhaps his finest victory as he confronts Samuel Sturgis and Ben Grierson at Brice’s Cross Roads. Fighting amongst the fields and blackjack thickets, the Confederate cavalryman presses the Union horsemen and then routs their infantry compatriots in the hard-fought contest. Of 8,000 men, Sturgis will count casualties of 223 killed, 394 wounded, and 1,623 captured or missing, as well as the loss much of his artillery and most of his wagons. Forrest will tally 96 killed and 396 wounded of his own, but he has driven a more numerous foe from the field in disorder, shattering the boasts that Sturgis made earlier of defeating him soundly.\n\nJaded by a type of warfare and changes in society that he struggles to comprehend fully, Ned Guerrant writes of John Hunt Morgan’s raid into his native Kentucky:\n\n“Robbed Lexington. Pillaged Lexington. Lexington defended by negro troops against white plunderers.\n\nThe ‘bumming’ process has greatly demoralized all the men, one corps by participation, another by association. (I do not altogether exculpate our 1st Brigade from this general charge of burglary, but we were so far eclipsed by professional thieves of the 2d. Brigade, that we surrendered all claims to comparison).\n\nI was so thoroughly disgusted & shamed by my association with such a command that I resolved to sever my connections with it at the earliest opportunity.”\n\nJune 11, 1864\n\nMorgan’s men fight their way into Cynthiana, Kentucky, capturing some 300 Union troops, while at Trevilian Station in Virginia, Philip Sheridan’s troopers engage their counterparts under Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee. In the meantime, David Hunter continues to ravage, turning his torches to the structures at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington.\n\nCSS Alabama reaches Cherbourg, France, hoping to refit for future operations against Northern shipping interests.\n\nJune 12, 1864\n\nIn a bold move designed to end the bloody stalemate in Virginia, the Army of the Potomac crosses the James River.\n\nFighting continues at Trevilian Station where Sheridan’s inability to break through Hampton’s lines convinces him to reconsider his effort to join David Hunter in the Valley. Sheridan’s losses in the effort have amounted to 102 killed, 470 wounded and 435 missing to total Confederate casualties set at 612.\n\nWilliam T. Sherman is “in an old house” located “In the Field, Big Shanty Geo.” He notes his disappointment that he could not force battle upon Johnston “in the Oostenaula Valley between Dalton & Resaca, but McPherson was a little overcautious, and we cannot move vast armies of this size with the rapidity of thought or of smaller bodies.” Still, he expects to fight Johnston soon. “We must have a terrific Battle, and he wants to choose & fortify his ground.”\n\nWar and the movement of his armies nevertheless have a profound effect on the local citizenry, although Sherman must still concern himself with threats to his attenuated and vulnerable supply line:\n\n“The Country is stripped of cattle, horses, hogs, and grain, but there are large fine fields of growing oats, wheat and corn, which our horses & mules devour as we advance. Thus far we have been well supplied, and I hope it will continue, though I expect to hear every day of Forrest breaking into Tennessee from some quarter. Jno. Morgan is in Kentucky but I attach little importance to him or his Raid, as we dont draw anything from Kentucky, and there are plenty of troops there to capture & destroy him. Forrest is a more dangerous man. I am in hopes that an expedition sent out from Memphis on Tupelo, about the 1st of June will give him full employment.. . . Johnston is now between me and Marietta. As soon as these Clouds and Storms clear away I will study his position and determine to assault his Line or turn it and force him back of the Chattahoochee. As long as I press him close and prevent his sending anything to Lee I fulfill my part of the Grand Plan. In the mean time Grant will give Lee all the fighting he wants until he is sick of the word.”\n\nJune 13, 1864\n\nTroops are on the move in Virginia and Georgia, North Carolina and Kansas. Jefferson Davis can only promise to send help where he can to seemingly everyone in the Confederate States, including in answer to calls from Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi, but words and intentions must be bent to realities as the Confederacy strains its resources to respond to the myriad threats it confronts.\n\nJune 14, 1864\n\nThe day is overcast in North Georgia as Joseph and Leonidas Polk leave their respective headquarters to convene on Pine Mountain, where they have been requested to survey the situation in order to determine if a repositioning of troops is required. The cluster of officers attracts the attention of General Sherman and Union artillery across the way. Although his compatriots manage to put themselves out of immediate danger, Bishop Polk is not so fortunate and a round smashes into him, killing him instantly. An emotional Johnston remarks, “I would rather anything than this.”\n\nIn the early afternoon, General Grant informs President Lincoln of his intentions after the bloody fighting in Virginia:\n\n“Our forces will commence crossing the James to-day. The enemy show no signs yet of having brought troops to the south side of Richmond. I will have Petersburg secured, if possible, before they get there in much force.”\n\nThe USS Kearsarge arrives off the coast of France to watch the Alabama.\n\nJune 15, 1864\n\nLate in the day, Union troops under Major General Dan Butterfield clash with Confederates under Patrick Cleburne at Gilgal Church. The Irish Confederate’s soldiers punish their blue-clad opponents, producing some 200 casualties at minimal cost to themselves. Among the assaulting Federals is Colonel Benjamin Harrison of the 70th Indiana.\n\nGrant’s hopes of rolling through the Petersburg defenses rest with Major General William F. “Baldy” Smith. His corps strikes the thinly held lines, pushing the Confederates back and capturing several batteries and approximately a mile of earthworks in the vaunted Dimmock Line. Nevertheless, against all odds, Beauregard holds on grimly, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements.\n\nPresident Lincoln hastens a response to General Grant on word of his latest dispositions:\n\n“Have just read your despatch of 1 P.M. yesterday. I begin to see it. You will succeed. God bless you all.”\n\nJune 16, 1864\n\nMajor General Winfield Scott Hancock reaches Petersburg with his command to relieve Smith and renew the offensive.\n\nSpeaking before the Great Central Sanitary Fair in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: “That Grant is this evening, with General Meade and General Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and the brave officers and soldiers with him, in a position from whence he will never be dislodged until Richmond is taken. . . .”\n\nJune 17, 1864\n\nAt Petersburg, Union pressure continues as Major General Ambrose Burnside adds his corps to the weight of the forces threatening to overrun the Southern lines.\n\nThe favorable circumstances that appear to prevail at Petersburg prompt Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to announce the capture of the city.\n\nAt Lynchburg, Virginia, a defensive force under John C. Breckinridge holds against threatening Union troops until 9,000 veterans from Robert E. Lee’s army under Lieutenant General Jubal Early can arrive to bolster their numbers. General Hunter opts to withdraw in the face of the works and his reinforced opposition.\n\nIn Georgia, Confederate brigadier general Daniel Reynolds maintains his diary entries despite the other duties that prevail:\n\n“Skirmishing along the lines during the day. At 10 p.m., left the works and moved back to the top of Big Kennesaw. I left the 9th Arkansas behind to bring up the rear. I placed my men in one rank and connected my left with Ector’s right between Big and Little Kennesaw. I made my headquarters on the south face of Big Kennesaw and about 50 yards from the summit.”\n\nJune 18, 1864\n\nThe Confederates have given ground, but still hold at Petersburg. Final Union assaults gain nothing further. Just as he had done a year earlier at Vicksburg, Ulysses Grant will have resort to other methods to achieve success in Virginia.\n\nDuring the night the Confederates drop back to Kennesaw Mountain.\n\nGeneral Reynolds notes:\n\n“Placed my men in line some 50 yards below the crest of mountain and commenced to fortify with rocks, etc. . . . Could get no tools to work with.”\n\nSherman complains to Grant regarding his own command:\n\n“My Chief source of trouble is with the Army of the Cumberland which is dreadfully slow. A fresh furrow in a ploughed field will stop the whole column, and all begin to intrench. I have again and again tried to impress on Thomas that we must assail & not defend. We are the offensive, & yet it seems the whole Army of the Cumberland is so habituated to be on the defensive that from its commander down to the lowest private I cannot get it out of their heads.”\n\nFrom South Carolina, Emma Holmes laments the loss of Bishop Polk:\n\n“He was a grand old hero and an immense loss to church & country.”\n\nJune 19, 1864\n\nKearsarge sinks Alabama off the coast of Cherbourg, France. A yacht lkying nearby to witness the events carries the Confederate cruiser’s skipper, Raphael Semmes, to safety.\n\nAbraham Lincoln reassures his wife in New York that their son Tad has returned to Washington “safely, and all well.”\n\nEmerson Opdycke writes his wife from “Under the Rebel guns at Kenesaw Mt. Ga.”\n\n“Our lines are now close up to Kenesaw Mountain, which is nearly as high as Lookout and runs South; we are pressing the enemy sharply, skirmishing constantly. This is rough soldering. . . . The sacrifices that are now being made for Justice, and Right, can never be fully written out; but God knows, and the Right must triumph in the end.”\n\nConfederate general Reynolds and his opponents remain active on the Kennesaw line:\n\n“Enemy shelled our line today. But one casualty in brigade. At 11 p.m., got some tools and the men worked busily the remainder of the night on their works. On yesterday and today could see nearly all the movements and dispositions of the enemy. We have a good telescope, several field glasses, and have an excellent view of all the country for miles around the mountain on every side, including both armies and Marietta.”\n\nNed Guerrant has finally returned with the remnant from Morgan’s ill-fated foray into Kentucky:\n\n“Started early, followed Martin’s Fork to it’s source & crossed the Cumbd. Mountain at Pennington’s Gap, the broadest, roughest gap I ever saw. We were three hours at least crossing this terrible mountain, and when we touched Virginia’s sacred & renowned soil beyond, we falt like singing a triumphal song of deliverance, as Moses & Miriam sung so sublimely on the banks of the Red Sea! Every heart thanked God, that he had brought us safely out of Kentucky, back to old Virginia, where at least we could lie down & sleep.”\n\nJune 20, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln has his eye on the Copperhead movement in the mid-west, informing Governor John Brough of Ohio and General Samuel P. Heintzelman:\n\n“Both of you have official responsibility as to the U.S. Military in Ohio, and generally—one, in organizing and furnishing, the other in directing, commanding, and forwarding. Consult together freely, watch Vallandigham and others closely, and, upon discovering any palpable injury, or imminent danger to the Military, proceeding from him, them, or any of them, arrest all implicated. Otherwise do not arrest without further order; meanwhile report the signs to me from time to time.”\n\nThe U.S. President is not the only individual to worry concerning fires in the rear. Confederate bureaucrat Robert G. H. Kean observes in his diary:\n\n“A curious secret society has made its appearance in North Carolina, traitorous in nature. . . . It has oaths, grips and signs. The essence of the thing is to betray your country in order to preserve yourself and your property. A similar thing has been discovered in Alabama.”\n\nCharles M. Allen reports from his station:\n\n“The following b"
