        "text": "Edward (Rocky) Kolb, Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, Fermilab\n\nUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\n\nArticles: The 4 Percent Universe (Search: Kolb)\n\nArXiv (23)\n\nBooks: The Early Universe, (Westview, 1990), (Taylor & Francis, 2018)\n\nCV\n\nHomepage(s): Chicago, Fermilab, Google Scholar, IMSA, inSPIREHEP, Kavli, Twitter, Wikipedia\n\nYouTube: Birth of the cosmic frontier URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzfpKLOyeEk\n\nQuote: “We really think that dark matter is a reality, and that dark energy is a reality.”\n\nfrom The 4 Percent Universe (page 179 of 270, reference 23 of 36) by Richard Panek, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston, 2011 (original website)\n\n_____\n\nMost recent email: 11 October 2022\n\nSecond email: 5 Dec 2020 @ 1:02 PM Update: 15 Sept. 2021\n\nDear Prof. Dr. Edward Kolb:\n\nIn the 7 September 2020 ArXiv article, Completely Dark Photons… you say, “…we calculate the number density of particles resulting from gravitational particle production (GPP) during inflation…” we may be better served to look at Planck Time — 5.391 16(13)×10-44 seconds — and other base units and to apply base-2 as the most simple expansion, what would expand? …preons (Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam in 1974)? …geons (Wheeler, 1955), …strings, automorphic forms, information (ZFC, axiomatic set theory, etc). How about return to Lemaitre’s primordial sphere? If such a sphere manifests, defined by the Planck base units, it would be a variable, but perhaps around 539+ tredecillion spheres per second.*\n\nToo idiosyncratic to pursue?\n\nThank you.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nBruce\n\n*Updated, 15 September 2021. More calculations coming: https://81018.com/tredecillion/\n\nFirst email: Sunday, 5 April 2020 at 11:12 AM\n\nDear Prof. Dr. Dean Edward (Rocky) Kolb:\n\nI first found your 1998 work through an “Inflation” search —\n\ninflation + CBR fluctuations + Hubble radius See result #4.\n\nhttps://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Kolb/Kolb3.html\n\nI wondered, “Who wrote this page and when?”\n\nBy clicking on “Contents” I found you and your 1998 Fermi-work overview:\n\nhttps://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Kolb/Kolb_contents.html\n\nThen, of course, I explored your more recent pages:\n\n• https://astro.uchicago.edu/~rocky/cv.pdf\n\n• https://astro.uchicago.edu/~rocky/\n\n• https://kicp.uchicago.edu/people/profile/edward_kolb.html\n\nWhat a progression from the University of New Orleans!\n\nCongratulations. Entirely remarkable and spirited career.\n\nWe lived in NOLA for eight years (Remember JT Curtis? High school football?)\n\nMost recently I have quickly paged through your presentation\n\non dark matter from 2010:\n\nhttp://kicp-courses.uchicago.edu/2010-dark/talks/kolb_lecture-3.pdf\n\nMy questions for you:\n\n1. Do you believe in an infinitely hot big bang?\n\n2. Did Lemaitre initially postulate a cold start of the universe?\n\n3. Do you think the Planck units are real?\n\n4. Might Planck time be the real beginning of the universe?\n\nThanks."
