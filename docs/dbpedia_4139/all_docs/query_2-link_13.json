Was Nephew of Police Officer Kolb, This City Albert, the fifteen year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Kolb, residing in the town of Meeme was accidently shot and killed yesterday afternoon by a revolver which he had picked up in the yard and was examining. It is a mystery as to how the revolver came to be on the premises as it did not belong to any of the family. It was a thirty-two caliber and only one shell was used. The bullet entered the lad's head and he died almost instantly. The accident happened shortly after three o'clock. It is the belief of his parents that the boy, not knowing that the revolver was loaded, pulled the trigger. Unfortunately the weapon was pointed his way. The lad was a newphew of Officer Charles Kolb of this city. The parents are nearly heart-broken and have the deepest sympathy of their neighbors and friends. The funeral arrangements have not been completed. Sheboygan Press, Wisconsin, Wednesday, May 8, 1912 p.1 ******** MEEME BOY DEAD; KILLED BY ACCIDENT Nephew of R.A. Kolb, of Co. Asylum, Victim of Tragedy MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN GUN LOADED Accidental discharge of a revolver, which he was examining caused the death of Alfred Kolb, the 15 year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Kolb, of the Town of Meeme and a nephew of R.A. Kolb, of the Manitowoc County Insane Asylum. The bullet entered the boy's head and he died twenty minutes later before a physician arrived. The revolver was a new one, 32 caliber, said to have been purchased by young Kolb the same day and the boy is thought to have been practicing in use of the weapon when the accident happened. There was but one discharged shell in the magazine, indicating that the fatality was probably due to lack of knowledge of the weapon. The size of the wound which caused death indicates that the weapon was close to the boy's head at the time the explosion occurred and from this it is believed that the cartridge failed to explode when Kolb tried to fire the gun and that he was examining it when the revolver was accidentally discharged, the bullet penetrating his head. News of the accident reached R. A. Kolb in this city Wednesday and Mr. Kolb will attend the funeral which will be held at Meeme Friday afternoon from the late home. The boy was a student at Meeme schools and was a bright, promising youth whose tragic death has prostrated his parents. The accident happened late Tuesday afternoon. No inquest will be held. Besides his parents, young Kolb is survived by four brothers and two sisters. The boy had completed his course in the district schools and was assisting his father on the farm at the time the accident ended his life. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Thursday, May 9, 1912 ******** Notes From Meeme: One of the saddest accidents ever happening in Meeme occurred last week when Alfred the fifteen year old son of Edmund Kolb accidentally shot himself while trying to use a newly purchased revolver. The shot entering his head, above the left eye, proved fatal. When found by his mother a few minutes after the shooting he was unconscious and remained so until his death which occurred one half hour later. Interment took place Friday in St. Jacobs Evangelic cemetery, Rev. Foesch performing the last burial rites. The bereaved parents and brothers have the sympathy of the entire community. Farewell! a little time And we who knew thee well, And loved thee here, One after one shall follow thee; As pilgrims through the gates of fear, Which opens on eternity. Manitowoc Pilot Thursday, May 16, 1912 pg. 8\n\nAMANDA KOLB (Note: I believe this goes here - Amanda is mentioned toward the end) Source: \"Portrait and Biographical Record - Published 1894 by Excelsior Publishing Co., Chicago\" Page 349 Louis C. Koellmer, who resides on section i, Herman Township, is a son of Fred and Elizabeth (Holland) Koellmer, and was born in Oberhof, Saxony, German, February 4, 1833. After receiving a common-school education, he served an apprenticeship of three years with his father, who was then a village blacksmith. He emigrated with his parents from the Fatherland when seventeen years of age, leaving Hamburg in 1850. He went by way of Hull and Liverpool to New York, and thence to Philadelphia on a three-mast American sailing-vessel. He was one of seven hundred passengers aboard this vessel on her long journey of forty days, during which time she encountered some rather rough weather. From New York City, Mr. Koellmer continued his journey by way of the Great Lakes to Sheboygan, where he remained about a month. The father went to Mosel Township, where he bought sixty acres of timber-land, only a few acres of which were then under the plow. This property, for which he paid $475, was later sold to one of his sons. The father was born October 18, 1808, and after seeing his family grown up about him, went to live with his son Frank, where he died at the advanced age of sixty-nine years. Until reaching his majority, Mr. Koellmer remained under the parental roof, and then went to Lake Superior, where he worked at his trade for about six years. He then returned for a visit to his parents, afterward going back to Lake Superior, where he made another stay of two years. In 1876 he bought one hundred and twenty acres of land, eighty acres of which lie in the town of Herman and forty acres in the town of Meeme, Manitowoc County. The former was partially under cultivation, but the latter tract was heavily timbered. For this farm of one hundred and twenty acres, Mr. Koellmer paid $2,800. He lived in several different residences, each being better built and more modern than its predecessor. A beautiful stone dwelling, 26x40 feet, now adorns the homestead, and since its erection a wing 18x20 feet has been added. Our subject has been twice married, his first wife being Miss Bertha Thamer, a native of Saxony. One child, Bertha, was born of this union. She is now living in Sheboygan, and is the wife of Albert Droscher. On the 27th of February, 1867, Mr. Koellmer wedded Miss Pauline Dornhoefer, daughter of Paul Dornhoefer. She was born March 27, 1834, in Baireuth, Oberfranken, Germany. She braved the voyage across the stormy deep all alone. She is the mother of four children: Odelia, wife of Fred Bender, a farmer of Herman Township; Amanda, wife of Edmund Kolb, a carpenter of Manitowoc County; Gustav and Selma, who are still at home. The family of our subject are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In politics, he has been a life-long Republican. He has served as Road Master for one term, and as an honest, hardworking farmer commands the confidence and esteem of his neighbors. Mrs. Koellmer mourns the loss of her father, who died August 12, 1877, and of her loving mother, who departed this life in 1872, both dying abroad.\n\nEDMUND E. KOLB Edmund Kolb, 78, Meeme farmer, died today at the farm home, following a lingering illness. He was born in Meeme in 1867 and in 1891 married Miss Amanda Koellmer.

His father was a charcoal burner, and in 1850 when Ernst was eleven years old, with his family they turned their faces toward the setting sun emigrating to America. They crossed the ocean in a sailing vessel and were on the water seven weeks before land was sighted. They landed at the port of New Orleans and then came to Wisconsin via the Mississippi river and the old Hennepin Canal. They settled in the township of Meeme, Manitowoc County, on a farm owned by Mr. Robert Fiedler. Here the decedent spent his boyhood days and part of his married life, and later purchased the farm now owned by his son Henry, and there he made his home until the final summons. In 1861 when the call came for volunteers to put down the rebellion, he enlisted in Company D, 27th regiment Wisconsin Volunteers, and served until the end of the war when he was honorably discharged. He took part in the siege of Vicksburg, Battle of Jenkins Ferry as well as the ill fated Red River Expedition and later in the siege and capture of Mobile. He received his discharge August 29, 1865.

In May, 1911, in company with a delegation from the State of Wisconsin, he took part in the dedication of a monument in memory of the Wisconsin Volunteers at Vicksburg, the capture of which he took part in during the war. From there he went on and visited all that part of the South over which the active service of the war took him, South to Mobile, Ala., and up the Red River in Arkansas. In the spring of 1912, he became ill and although he partly recovered, he never regained his strength. In June 1912 he decided to visit all his children and relatives once more.
