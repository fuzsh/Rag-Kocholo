        "text": "American football player, coach, and administrator (born 1978)\n\nFor other people with the same name, see Edward Reed (disambiguation).\n\nAmerican football player\n\nEdward Earl Reed Jr. (born September 11, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL), spending the majority of his career with the Baltimore Ravens. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, where he played on Miami's 2001 national championship team and was named a unanimous All-American. He was selected by the Ravens in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft and played 11 seasons with them before playing with the Houston Texans and New York Jets in 2013.\n\nDuring his playing career, Reed was selected to nine total Pro Bowls, he was the 2004 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award winner, won Super Bowl XLVII, and has an NFL record for the two longest interception returns (106 yards in 2004 and 107 yards in 2008).[1] He also holds the all-time NFL record for interception return yards, with 1,590, and postseason interceptions (9, tied with three other players). His 64 regular season interceptions ranked him 6th on the NFL's all-time leader list at the time of his retirement. Reed is considered to be one of the greatest safeties in NFL history, and was often referred to as a \"ball hawk\" during his prime.[2][3][4][5] Reed was known for studying film to memorize opposing teams' tendencies,[6][7] as well as his ability to lure quarterbacks into throwing interceptions.[8] Reed was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Reed worked as an assistant defensive backs coach for the Buffalo Bills. In 2020, he was hired by the University of Miami, his alma mater, to serve as their football team's chief of staff, an advisory role to head coach Manny Diaz.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nReed was born in St. Rose, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, on September 11, 1978.

Also a standout performer in the long jump and triple jump, he recorded personal bests in high school of over 24 feet (7.3 m) and over 46 feet (14 m), respectively.[10]\n\nWhile in college, Reed joined the Miami Hurricanes track and field team in 2000, where he competed as a jumper and javelin thrower. He placed 7th in the triple jump at the 2000 Big East Championships, setting a career-best jump of 14.58 meters (47 ft 10 in). In addition, he finished 3rd in the javelin throw, with a personal-best throw of 60.08 meters (197 ft 1 in).[12]\n\nCollege career\n\n[edit]\n\nReed received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he was a standout defensive back for coach Butch Davis and coach Larry Coker's Miami Hurricanes football teams from 1997 to 2001.[10] Reed was a member of the Hurricane's 2001 National Championship team.[13]\n\nAfter redshirting in the 1997 season, Reed led the team with two interceptions and four forced fumbles in the 1998 season. He had two more interceptions in the 1999 season.[10] Reed was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in the 2000 season, and a unanimous first-team All-American in the 2001 season.[14] In 2001, he led the nation with nine interceptions for 209 yards, which was a school record, and three touchdowns. He helped seal a memorable win over Boston College in 2001 when he grabbed the ball out of teammate Matt Walters's hands, who had just intercepted it, and raced 80 yards for a touchdown.[15] Reed was honored as the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in 2001, and was named National Defensive Player of the Year by Football News. He was a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award and was a semifinalists for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy.[10]\n\nReed set several records during his time at the University of Miami. He holds the record for career interceptions with 21, career interception return yards with 389, and interceptions returned for touchdowns with five.[16] He also blocked four punts during his four-year career.[10] In addition, he was a member of the track and field team during his years at Miami and was a Big East champion in the javelin.[17]\n\nReed and Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne were roommates during their time at the University of Miami.[18] He graduated in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in liberal arts.[13] Reed was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame as part of its Class of 2012 at a banquet held in Miami on March 29, 2012.[19]\n\nReed was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on January 7, 2018.[20]\n\nCollege statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nEd Reed Defense Season Team GP Cmb TfL PD Int FF 1997 Miami 0 Redshirted 1998 Miami 11 90 2.0 7 2 4 1999 Miami 12 74 4.0 4 2 0 2000 Miami 11 80 0.0 23 8 0 2001 Miami 11 44 1.0 18 9 0 Totals 45 288 7.0 52 21 4\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight 40-yard dash 5 ft 11 in\n\n(1.80 m) 201 lb\n\n(91 kg) 4.57 s All values from NFL Combine[21]\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens selected Reed in the first round (24th overall) of the 2002 NFL draft.

The suspension was later overturned, and Reed was fined $50,000 for the hit.[139] On December 26, 2012, it was announced that Reed was selected to the 2013 Pro Bowl.[140] He started in all 16 games in 2012 and recorded 58 combined tackles (45 solo), 16 pass deflections, four interceptions, and a touchdown.[141]\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens finished atop the AFC North with a 10–6 record and earned a playoff berth.[142] They reached Super Bowl XLVII after defeating the Indianapolis Colts 24–9 in the AFC Wild Card Round, the Denver Broncos 38–35 in the AFC Divisional Round, and also defeated the New England Patriots 28–13 in the AFC Championship.[143][144][145] On February 3, 2013, Reed started in Super Bowl XLVII and recorded five solo tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass by 49ers' quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the Ravens' 34–31 victory against the San Francisco 49ers.[146] He was ranked 18th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[147]\n\nDeparture\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 24, 2013, Reed stated that despite repeated reports he might retire, he intended to play the next year.[148]\n\nReed became a free agent after his contract expired at the end of the 2012 season.[149] While he had considered retiring after the 2012 season, Reed stated after the Super Bowl that he intended to continue playing football in 2013.[9][149]\n\nReed scored a total of 14 touchdowns in his career with the Baltimore Ravens.[150]\n\nHouston Texans\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 22, 2013, Reed signed a three-year contract worth $15 million with $5 million guaranteed with the Houston Texans.[151] Later in the 2013 offseason, Reed underwent arthroscopic surgery in his hip to repair a small labral tear.[152] Reed made his Houston Texans debut on September 22, 2013, against the Ravens in Baltimore.[153] As the season progressed, Reed saw his playing time reduced. He eventually lost his starting job to Shiloh Keo during Week 9 against the Indianapolis Colts.[154]\n\nOn November 10, 2013, Reed only played 12 snaps in a loss against the Arizona Cardinals. After the game, Reed told the media that the team was \"outplayed and outcoached\". A few days later, Reed was released by the Texans after displaying limited production with just 16 tackles, no interceptions, no forced fumbles, and no passes defended through seven games.[155]\n\nNew York Jets\n\n[edit]\n\nReed was signed by the New York Jets on November 14, 2013, after clearing waivers.[156] The move reunited Reed with head coach Rex Ryan, whom he played for when Ryan was the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens.[156] Reed played his first game as a Jet on November 17, 2013, against the Buffalo Bills.[157]\n\nIn Week 14, he recorded his first interception of the 2013 season against Oakland Raiders quarterback Matt McGloin.[158] In Weeks 16 and 17, against the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins respectively, Reed had an interception late in each game's fourth quarter, to preserve the Jets' win. The interceptions helped the Jets close the season with two straight wins to finish with an 8–8 record, which played a major part in Rex Ryan keeping his job as head coach.[159][160][161] With the Jets, Reed played in seven games, of which he started five, with 22 tackles, four passes defended, and three interceptions. Overall, in 2013, combined with both teams he played for, Reed played 14 games, of which he started 10, with 42 total tackles, four passes defended, and three interceptions.[162]\n\nRetirement\n\n[edit]\n\nReed announced his retirement on May 6, 2015, signing a one day contract on May 7 to retire as a Baltimore Raven.[163]\n\nReed was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 2, 2019, his first year of eligibility. He was the third homegrown Raven who achieved the sport's highest career recognition.[164] He was named to the NFL 100 All Time Team.[165]\n\nNFL career statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nLegend NFL Defensive Player of the Year Won the Super Bowl NFL record Led the league Bold Career high\n\nRegular season\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Games Tackles Interceptions Punt Returns Fumbles Other\n\nTD[a] GP GS Cmb Solo Ast Sck Sfty Int Yds Avg Lng TD PD Ret Yds Avg Lng TD FR FF TD 2002 BAL 16 16 85 71 14 1.0 0 5 167 33.4 59 0 7 — — — — — 0 0 0 1 2003 BAL 16 15 71 59 12 1.0 0 7 132 18.9 54T 1 9 5 33 6.6 19 0 0 1 0 2 2004 BAL 16 16 76 62 14 2.0 0 9 358 39.8 106T 1 8 — — — — — 2 3 1 0 2005 BAL 10 10 37 33 4 0.0 0 1 23 23.0 23 0 8 — — — — — 0 0 0 0 2006 BAL 16 16 59 51 8 0.0 1 5 70 14.0 37 1 4 — — — — — 1 1 0 0 2007 BAL 16 16 39 29 10 0.0 0 7 130 18.6 32 0 13 10 94 9.4 63T 1 1 0 0 0 2008 BAL 16 16 41 34 7 1.0 0 9 264 29.3 107T 2 16 1 8 8.0 8 0 2 1 1 0 2009 BAL 12 12 50 42 8 0.0 0 3 111 37.0 52T 1 5 7 29 4.1 9 0 3 3 0 0 2010 BAL 10 10 37 30 7 0.0 0 8 183 22.9 44 0 16 3 11 3.7 9 0 1 1 0 0 2011 BAL 16 16 52 44 8 1.0 0 3 25 8.3 16 0 8 3 29 9.7 16 0 0 1 0 0 2012 BAL 16 16 58 49 9 0.0 0 4 78 19.5 34T 1 15 1 1 1.0 1 0 3 0 0 0 2013 HOU 7 5 16 14 2 0.0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 — — — — — 0 0 0 0 NYJ 7 5 22 13 9 0.0 0 3 49 16.3 25 0 4 — — — — — 0 0 0 0 Career 174 169 643 531 112 6.0 1 64 1,590 24.8 107T 7 113 30 205 6.8 63 1 13 11 2 3\n\nPlayoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Games Tackles Interceptions Punt Returns Fumbles GP GS Cmb Solo Ast Sck Sfty Int Yds Avg Lng TD PD Ret Yds Avg Lng TD FR FF TD 2003 BAL 1 1 0 0 0 0.0 0 1 23 23.0 23 0 2 — — — — — 0 0 0 2006 BAL 1 1 1 1 0 0.0 0 2 0 0.0 0 0 3 — — — — — 0 0 0 2008 BAL 3 3 7 6 1 0.0 0 2 76 38.0 64 1 3 — — — — — 0 0 0 2009 BAL 2 2 9 7 2 0.0 0 2 38 19.0 38 0 2 — — — — — 0 0 0 2010 BAL 2 2 7 6 1 0.0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 — — — — — 1 0 0 2011 BAL 2 2 10 9 1 0.0 0 1 0 0.0 0 0 6 — — — — — 0 0 0 2012 BAL 4 4 15 14 1 0.0 0 1 6 6.0 6 0 3 1 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 Career 15 15 49 43 6 0.0 0 9 168 18.6 64 1 19 1 0 0.0 0 0 1 0 0\n\nRecords\n\n[edit]\n\nNFL records\n\n[edit]\n\nTied-most playoff career interceptions (9)[166]\n\nLongest interception return (107 yards) *Touchdown[167]\n\nMost interception return yards, career (1,590 yards)[168]\n\nTied-most career blocked punts returned for touchdowns (3)[169]\n\nOnly player in NFL history to score touchdowns via interception, fumble recovery, blocked punt & punt return.[170]\n\nMost multi-interception games, career (12)[171]\n\nRavens franchise records\n\n[edit]\n\nMost career interceptions (61)\n\nMost career interception return yards (1,541)\n\nMost career interception return touchdowns (7)\n\nMost passes defended (137)\n\nMost interception-return yards in a single game (150)[79]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nNFL\n\n[edit]\n\nSuper Bowl champion (XLVII)\n\nNFL Defensive Player of the Year (2004)\n\n5× First-team All-Pro (2004, 2006–2008, 2010)\n\n3× Second-team All-Pro (2003, 2009, 2011)\n\n9× Pro Bowl (2003, 2004, 2006–2012)\n\n3× NFL interceptions leader (2004, 2008, 2010)\n\nNFL 2000s All-Decade Team\n\nNFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team\n\nPFWA All-Rookie Team (2002)\n\nBaltimore Ravens Ring of Honor\n\nCollege\n\n[edit]\n\nBCS national champion (2001)\n\nCo-Big East Defensive Player of the Year (2001)\n\nUnanimous All-American (2001)\n\nConsensus All-American (2000)\n\nCoaching career\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 13, 2016, Reed was hired as an assistant defensive backs coach for the Buffalo Bills.[173] This reunited him with coach Rex Ryan for the third time, after stints together with the Ravens and Jets during Reed's playing career. After serving the 2016 season in Buffalo, Reed was not retained by new coach Sean McDermott after Ryan's dismissal.[174]\n\nOn December 27, 2022, Reed was hired as the new head coach of the Bethune–Cookman Wildcats football team.[175] Before he officially became the coach of the team, Bethune–Cookman declined to ratify the contract on January 21, 2023, which vacated the football team's head coaching position.[176] Prior to his dismissal, Reed recorded a live stream on which he vociferously criticized the condition of the school's athletic facilities.[177][178][179] In the wake of this decision, Reed continued his criticism of the university, saying \"I'm not withdrawing my name as they say. They don't want me here. They do not want me because I tell the truth.\"[180]\n\nAdministrative career\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 30, 2020, Reed was hired by the University of Miami as the football team's chief of staff, an advisory role to head coach Manny Diaz.[181] Following the departure of Diaz, Reed stayed in his role under new head coach Mario Cristobal.[182]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
