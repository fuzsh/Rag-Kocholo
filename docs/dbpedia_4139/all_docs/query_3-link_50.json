        "text": "BY GORDIE JONES, For The Patriot-News\n\nBETHLEHEM -- The challenge facing\n\nis as big as a pack of those wild boars he used to hunt in his native Texas. And about as tough as one of their tusks.\n\nAfter three years of waiting, he has become\n\n’ starting quarterback, a be-careful-what-you-wish-for proposition if ever there were one. For while he appears well-suited to Andy Reid’s version of the West Coast offense (and while it looks like Kolb has the necessary weapons around him), he inherits a team that is suddenly one of the youngest in the league, and one facing questions along the offensive line and on defense.\n\nThen there is the fan base, never known for its patience. Because Kolb is following Donovan McNabb —\n\nwhen the team’s braintrust, like so many of the fans, concluded it was time to move on from him — the newcomer will get a grace period. No telling how long it will last, though.\n\nThere is a short-term alternative on the roster in the notorious\n\n, who evokes cries of wonder from fans every time he effortlessly fires deep in a training-camp scrimmage at Lehigh University. But Vick’s feel for the underneath stuff — the West Coast’s bread and butter — remains about as sound as his off-field decision-making.\n\nThe job, and everything that goes with it, belongs to Kolb.\n\n“He wants this just as bad as everybody else,” said Duce Staley, once a standout running back for the Eagles and this year a coaching intern. “I’m excited to see him go out there and prove to the world he can do it.”\n\nKolb has just two starts on his resume, both of them 300-yard passing performances while filling in for an injured McNabb last year. There are nonetheless dozens of reasons to believe this might not work out for him.\n\nIt’s possible that this team, with an average age just over 24, will be done in by its youth. Or that the defense, which will feature at least four new starters, will struggle as much as it did down the stretch last year. Or that the banged-up O-line will be unable to find its rhythm.\n\nBut there is no reason to believe Kolb, who turns 26 this month, will be overwhelmed by the task — enormous as it might appear.\n\n“It’s never as big as you think it is,” he said after a recent practice.\n\nHe first learned that a decade ago, while a high school sophomore in Stephenville, Texas, a football-mad town about 75 miles southwest of Fort Worth.\n\nSome 18,000 souls call Stephenville home, but the Yellow Jackets routinely draw 10,000 to their games. That includes the Can Fans, enterprising folks who slice open empty propane tanks, drop a bunch of ball bearings inside, weld the containers shut and shake those puppies for all they’re worth.\n\n“It gets ridiculously loud,” Kolb said. “It’s an intimidation thing.”\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have been the subject of two television documentaries through the years — one by NFL Films, the other by A&E — and enjoyed their greatest success during Art Briles’s 12-year run as head coach (1988-99). He won four state championships, the last in his final season, when Kolb was a freshman bench warmer.\n\nThe next year, Briles took a job as an assistant at Texas Tech. And Stephenville, at that point coached by former assistant Mike Copeland, opened its season before a crowd of 25,000 in San Antonio’s Alamodome. Its opponent was Texas City, which the previous year had won a state title in a different classification.\n\nIt was against that backdrop that Kolb made his first start. And while it ended in defeat (if barely; the score was 39-33), he acquitted himself well, throwing for 232 yards.\n\nThe moral of the story, as Kolb sees it, is this: “It’s all relative. Whenever I was in high school, playing Texas City in the Alamodome was as big for a 14-year-old kid as playing Green Bay [the Birds’ opponent in their Sept. 12 opener] in Lincoln Financial [Field].”\n\nThree years later, he was a freshman starter at the University of Houston, having been reunited with Briles when the older man took the head coaching job there. (He now holds the same position at Baylor.) And in the opener against Rice, Kolb had butterflies bigger than Buicks.\n\nHe told himself to catch his breath. To slow down, get the ball out on time, make astute decisions.\n\n“And,” he said, “we beat the snot out of them.”\n\nThe final was 48-14, as Kolb threw for two touchdowns and ran for two others. And again there was a lesson to be learned where he was concerned, this one about keeping it simple.\n\n“This whole year,” he said, “I want to keep that mentality: Do the easy things.”\n\nHe has picked up other lessons along the way. His dad, who gave him some tough-love coaching in junior high, emphasized that all eyes are always on the quarterback, so the younger Kolb should act accordingly.\n\nAnd Copeland, a guy born with only half a left arm, provided his own inspiration. He once played college baseball on scholarship, and even now, at age 63, he shoots in the high 80s in golf. Did so right before training camp, in fact, when he and Kolb played a round near Stephenville, where Kolb maintains an offseason home with his wife, Whitney, and two young daughters.\n\n“You know what I love about him?” Kolb asked. “No excuse, no sympathy. ... He doesn’t skip a beat. For a guy to have that drive and never make excuses, it shows young kids, man, you can do whatever you want to do with what you’re dealt.”\n\nIt was Copeland who predicted, shortly after the Eagles made Kolb the 36th choice of the 2007 draft, that his protege’s career ultimately would eclipse that of another QB, Notre Dame’s Brady Quinn, who was selected by the Browns 14 picks earlier. Quinn washed out in Cleveland and is now with Denver.\n\n“I was right on that one, wasn’t I?” Copeland said over the phone recently, laughing. “I think I will be.”\n\nWhat no one might have predicted is that Kolb also has a chance to outperform that year’s No. 1 overall pick, JaMarcus Russell, a dismal failure in Oakland. And if Kolb does so, Copeland said, it will not only be because of his acumen and ability, but also his temperament.\n\n“He doesn’t get too high or too low,” he said. “He understands the nature of pro football: Today’s hero is tomorrow’s goat. ... You’ve got to have pretty thick skin. The thing that helped him was being in a high-profile high school program. That prepared him for guys patting him on the back one day and sticking the knife in the next day.”\n\nThe Eagles likewise saw all kinds of good things in Kolb, who threw for nearly 13,000 yards in four years at Houston. Just the other day, offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg was talking about the new QB’s skill set, as well as his toughness.\n\nPerhaps that stands to reason, given all that boar hunting he used to do. It was first brought to light in a Philadelphia Daily News story that ran two weeks after the ¤’07 draft, Kolb telling reporter Les Bowen that the hogs are a nuisance, a real threat to crops. So he would track them with the help of his hunting dogs, then kill the beasts with a 12-inch Bowie knife.\n\nNow Kolb is asked about that all the time. Happened the first day of camp, when Vai Sikahema, sports anchor for Philadelphia’s NBC-TV affiliate (and a former Eagles punt returner), cornered him and wondered whether his exploits as a boar hunter had been accurately portrayed.\n\n“It’s a little bit true,” Kolb told Sikahema. “Once I started using my hands a little bit more, I got away from it.”\n\nThe interview ended moments later, and two technicians began breaking down equipment.\n\n“Wild boar?” one said.\n\n“That’s what they do in Texas,” the other said.\n\nUp here, Kolb has made refinements on the fly. He has always said he learned a great deal from McNabb, especially about dealing with the media and fans, but his own accessibility to reporters in the early days of camp has been a marked departure from the way his predecessor used to roll. McNabb kept the members of the Fourth Estate at arm’s length, doing mass interviews and little else — a byproduct, no doubt, of all the heat he took during his 11 years in Philadelphia for his postseason failures and the flippant, what-me-worry demeanor he often chose to show the public.\n\nThe two men remain close, McNabb even going so far as to send Kolb a good-luck text message before camp. But Kolb acknowledged that it would have been “difficult” to return as a backup this year.\n\n“I want to be on the field, you know?” he said.\n\nHe has played only 12 games to date. Until last year, the most notable of those came in 2008 at Baltimore, when Reid made the surprising decision to bench McNabb at halftime. Kolb struggled in his place, throwing an interception that Ed Reed, the Ravens’ ball-hawking safety, returned an NFL-record 108 yards for a touchdown.\n\nCopeland, watching on TV at home, said he “nearly puked” when that happened. No matter, though.\n\n“He got the chance to redeem himself,” he said of Kolb, “and he did.”\n\nHis 300-yard games last season came against New Orleans (a loss) and Kansas City (a victory); it was the first time in NFL history a quarterback had ever thrown for that many yards in each of his first two starts.\n\nNow it’s a matter of doing it over the long haul. Now it’s a matter of whittling a seemingly enormous task down to size."
