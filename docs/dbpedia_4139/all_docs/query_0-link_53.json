        "text": "I put the first pages about Goldlauter on the Internet in 1995.\n\nBased on these pages up until today, about 20 U.S.-Americans, who had ancestors from Goldlauter and/or Heidersbach, have reported to me about themselves. In the meantime, however, I have personally come to know some of them solely via e-mail correspondence. Often it turned out from the first reports on the ancestors of these new U.S. citizens that they were also my ancestors, and that is also true of the overall picture. Incidentally some interesting details have emerged, for example the cemetery in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA, bears the name \"Schübel Cemetery,\" this name from Gustav Robert Schübel (emigrated 1862 from Heidersbach)\n\nThe top picture shows Friedrich Edward Weiss (born 24 June 1840 in Goldlauter) with his wife Ämilie Hulda Weiss (born 26 Sep.1839) and their 7 children in the photo, which was taken in 1886 in the Chicago area. Friedrich Eduard and Hulda came to Illinois with their respective parents about 1851. As a side note: Hulda is the sister of the Petersch' Emil, a well known original \"Wopper\".\n\nThis photo comes of Alf Loran Olsen, Seattle.\n\nI received the bottom photos from Sheryll Jeffers, whose ancestors also come from Goldlauter. Friedrich Lorenz Weiss (born 5 May 1818 in Goldlauter) and Johanna Laurette, known as \"Laura,\" Weiss (born 17 June 1822) emigrated between 1847 and 1852 and died 1882 in Maywood, Illinois, USA. Below on the right is son Heinrich Christian Weiss, known as \"Henry,\" with his wife Anna.\n\nThe last picture shows Lorenz Christian Hornschuch together with his Wilhelmine Lucinde \"Mina\" [Günther]. Christian arrived 26-Apr-1861 with age of 14 years along with his mother Rosanna and with his sisters Emilie and Rosamunde with the ship \"Ottilie\" in New York. They settled in Pennsylvania. There were brother Eduard (he left Heidersbach one year ago) and the oldest brother Christian Lorenz (left Heidersbach in 1852 yet) waiting to the rest of their family. In 1870 Lorenz Christian Hornschuch married Mina Günther. She also came from Heidersbach and arrived in 1861 with the same ship (together with her father Ernst, her mom and 4 further siblings). Christian and Mina procreated 10 children in America (Henry, Emil, Edward, Theodore, Rose, Lawrence, Adeline, Otto, Albert, and Lydia). All of them didn't die before age of 18!\n\nMost inhabitants of Goldlauter-Heidersbach left their homeland between 1850 and 1866 for America. The primary harbors in Germany for the ocean voyages were Bremen and Hamburg. The Bremen passenger list either was destroyed or made otherwise unattainable. This fact can become borne out if one reasons that in the USA port records were made of all arrivals. The primary port in the USA was New York, however some ships also landed in New Orleans, Baltimore, Boston or Philadelphia.\n\nWhy were there so many Woppers who emigrated to America?\n\nThe population grew rapidly in the 19th century at the time after the Napoleonic wars. Before 1830 the people came almost exclusively out of southwest Germany (Württemberg, Baden, Bavaria), because in these regions the population had increased the quickest. From 1840, more and more also came from northwest Germany, for example unemployed textile workers and farmers. From 1850, the departure wave also spread from the other zones of Germany. If one considers, that the population of Germany doubled (in spite of emigration!!!) between 1840 and 1910 from 32.8 millions to 64.9 million, one can understand that it became \"too tight.\" The large exodus between 1847 and 1855 was the result of crop failures, increase in food costs, famine, political instability and the rapid decline in the standard of living. Lt. William Filby, director of the Maryland Historical Society, says that between 1850 and 1893 more than 4 million Germans came to America.\n\nOn Ascension Day 1850 (9 May) 13 inhabitants of Goldlauter left their homeland for America. On 8 April 1852, 6 more followed. Later, all Americans who were born in Goldlauter or Heidersbach and died in America are listed. There are also some who left and then returned to Goldlauter. These repatriates are not itemized, as are children who died before attaining the age of 14. The date of the fact sheets is April 2001. Sources include \"Passenger and Immigration Lists, Germans to America, 1850-1874,\" as well as the many Americans who made the data of their ancestors available to me. Most special thanks in this regard to Mr. Al Williams of California! The following listing is certainly not complete, but I work hard at it ;-))\n\nEmigrants from Goldlauter/Heidersbach\n\nInformation received from descendants of these ole Woppers:\n\nBecher, Christian (born in Goldlauter, married Berta Auguste Weiss 21-May-1888 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nBecher, Friedrich Wilhelm (born 20-Sep-1843 in Goldlauter, died 26-Apr-1915 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nEbert, Johann Friedrich Christian (born 22-Nov-1807 in Goldlauter, died 15-Mar-1892 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nEbert, Ernst Heinrich (born 2-Mar-1831 in Goldlauter, died 9-Dec-1911 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nEbert, Laurette Rufine Louise (born 27-Nov-1839 in Goldlauter, died 10-Oct-1918 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nGering, Heinrich Ernst Emil (born 21-Jul-1845 in Heidersbach, died 8-Nov-1909 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA)\n\nGünther, Emil Eduard (born 24-Feb-1858 in Heidersbach, died in Pennsylvania, USA)\n\nGünther, Friedrich Ernst (born 31-Mar-1827 in Goldlauter, died 11-Feb-1889 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nGünther, Friedrich Ernst (born 18-May-1850 in Heidersbach, died 23-Jan-1924 in Pennsylvania, USA)\n\nGünther, Johann Heinrich (born 9-Mar-1822 in Goldlauter, died 9-May-1906 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nGünther, Wilhelm Eduard (born 15-Oct-1855 in Heidersbach, died 30-Mar-1914 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nGünther, Wilhelmine Lucinde \"Mina\" (born 24-Nov-1852 in Heidersbach, died 12-Nov-1917 in Salem, Oregon, USA)\n\nHeym, Aurelie Philippine (born 17-Dec-1817 in Goldlauter, died 1-Feb-1900 in Webster County, Iowa, USA)\n\nHeym, Mr. (born in Goldlauter, married Elisabetha Katherine Kirchner in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA)\n\nHornschuch, Anna Maria (born 27-Mar-1828 in Heidersbach, died bef 1900 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nHornschuch, Johann Eduard (born 19-Jul-1835 in Heidersbach, died 27.-Aug-1895 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nHornschuch, Christian Lorenz (born 12-Jan-1833 in Heidersbach, died 1-Jun-1907 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nHornschuch, Lorenz Christian (born 5-Sep-1847 in Heidersbach, died 1-Dec-1911 in Clackamas County, Oregon, USA)\n\nHornschuch, Pauline (geb.
