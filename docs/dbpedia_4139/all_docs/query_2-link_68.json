        "text": "DRI is pleased to announce that Lisa Baird is now chair of the Center for Law and Public Policy’s Amicus Committee. The position will carry with it an appointment to the Center Management Council. A partner of Reed Smith LLP in Miami, Florida, Lisa represents manufacturers of medical devices, prescription drugs, and OTC drugs in product liability and commercial litigation. She has more than twenty years’ experience defending corporate clients in appellate and trial courts throughout the country, and is admitted in both Florida and California. Her work has a particular emphasis on issues that regularly recur in medical device and pharmaceutical product liability litigation, including preemption, as well as other types of complex litigation, such as class issues, unfair competition, consumer fraud claims, third party payor claims, and punitive damages.\n\nLisa previously served as vice chair of the Center’s Amicus Committee and is a past chair of the DRI Appellate Advocacy Committee.\n\nDRI is also pleased that Melinda Kollross has accepted an appointment as vice chair of the Center’s Amicus Committee. Melinda is a shareholder of Clausen Miller PC and chair of its Appellate & Trial Monitoring Practice Group. From the firm’s Chicago office, she handles post-trial and appellate litigation for savvy clients nationwide. Licensed in Illinois and New York, she has litigated more than 200 appeals in state and federal reviewing courts and has participated in appeals before the United States Supreme Court. Her work spans all areas of firm practice, including commercial litigation, first-party property, liability insurance coverage, and liability defense.\n\nDRI and the Center wish to thank Matt Nelson (Warner Norcross + Judd LLP) for his years of service as chair of the Amicus Committee. Matt, who now serves on the DRI Board as Center Region Director, will continue to serve as a member of the Amicus Committee.\n\nPictured, L to R: Baird, Kollross, Nelson\n\nCenter Joins ALF Brief Urging Supreme Court to Limit Civil RICO’s Scope\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) authorizes the filing of civil suits for treble damages and attorney fees by “[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of” engaging in certain prohibited activities. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). RICO was enacted as a prosecutorial tool for fighting organized crime. The Second and Ninth Circuits have held, however, that a civil RICO treble-damages claim can be filed for lost wages or other employment-related economic injuries resulting from a personal injury—such as in a product liability case—even though it is well settled that personal injury claims themselves are excluded from civil RICO. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have seized upon these holdings, with which at least three other circuits disagree, to attempt to transform ordinary product liability suits into civil RICO actions. Civil RICO’s broad venue and jurisdictional provisions enable plaintiffs to “forum shop” to courts that allow such personal injury-related civil RICO claims, and thereby not only seek treble damages, but also circumvent various States’ tort reform measures.\n\nHorn v. Medical Marijuana, Inc. is a seemingly ordinary product liability suit involving a legal, non-psychoactive, CBD wellness product. The Second Circuit held, however, that the truck driver plaintiff, who lost his job after ingesting the product and then failing a routine drug test, can maintain a civil RICO claim for lost wages and other employment-related economic harm against the product’s producers. They have filed a certiorari petition requesting the Supreme Court to rule that civil RICO claims do not encompass economic harms resulting from personal injuries.\n\nThe Atlantic Legal Foundation, joined by the DRI Center for Law and Public Policy, has filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to grant review and hold that civil RICO does not extend to personal injury-related economic harms, and cannot be exploited by the plaintiffs’ bar to circumvent state tort reform laws, such as those which place caps on damages. The ALF/Center brief was authored by DRI Appellate Advocacy Committee chair and Center Amicus Committee member Sarah Spencer of Christensen & Jensen and ALF Executive Vice President & General Counsel Larry Ebner, who also serves on the Amicus Committee and as chair of the Center. Valuable pro bono assistance also was provided by Joe Hollingsworth, Bill Cople, and Elyse Shimada of Hollingsworth LLP.\n\nPictured, L to R: Spencer, Ebner\n\nAviation Law\n\nMatthew Berard, Committee Chair\n\nThe Aviation Law Committee is made up of professionals who work and are interested in the field of aviation law. Our committee includes attorneys defending the interests of airlines, airports, aircraft component manufacturers and suppliers and related industry groups on a national and international scale. Committee members counsel clients in complex commercial transactions regarding the purchase and sale of aircraft and others represent clients in regulatory and enforcement matters. Still others are involved in litigation arising from international and domestic aviation accidents and disputes regarding the performance of aerospace products. Many of our Committee members have technical experience as pilots, aircraft mechanics and even air traffic controllers!\n\nOur committee provides a forum for collaborating to address common defense strategies and learning from those who have effectively utilized certain arguments (many of which are rapidly developing or novel) in defense of aviation clients. DRI serves as a conduit to connect and re-connect practitioners defending clients in similar industries and as a sounding board for defense strategies.\n\nThe Aviation Committee’s well-regarded podcast, Wingtips, continues to produce new episodes where we interview some of the most interesting legal minds in the aviation field, and occasionally delve into a non-legal (but still fascinating) facet of the aviation industry.\n\nIf you are an aviation practitioner or even are simply interested in the practice of aviation law, contact DRI and join the Committee! Leadership positions are available, and even contributing an aviation-focused article for a DRI publication would be a tremendous way to help and get your name out to a wide audience.\n\nWe are an experienced and accomplished group of aviation defense attorneys, who navigate the small community of aviation practitioners on both sides of the aisle, and who take pride in their work on behalf of a key segment in the national and worldwide economy.\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nJoin the Aviation Law Committee.\n\nCheck out the Aviation Law Wingtips podcast library.\n\nReach out to the Committee Chair Matthew Berard, at matthew.berard@bowmanandbrooke.com or Vice Chair Stephanie Short at sshort@gaig.com.\n\nGovernmental Liability\n\nRyan Kunhart, Committee Chair\n\nThe Governmental Liability Committee is comprised of professionals who devote a substantial amount of their time working with governments and their employees. Our membership includes attorneys in private practice and in the public sector, as well as insurance industry representatives involved in underwriting and in adjusting public entity claims.\n\nThe focus of the committee is litigation under 42 U.S.C. §1983, which over the years has become a labyrinth of procedural and substantive rules. Complicating matters further is the fact that the constitutional rights at the root of all §1983 litigation are themselves fluid concepts that are continually being revisited by the circuit courts as well as the Supreme Court. Given the vagaries of §1983 claims and defenses, and the creativity of our adversaries in court, we aim to stay on the “cutting edge” of the evolving standards in this challenging area of the law.\n\nOne of the challenges our members face is an evolving political and social climate involving the representation of law enforcement officers. Our committee provides great resources to help members when unique issues arise, or a member wants a second opinion on a situation.\n\nThe Committee’s annual Civil Rights and Governmental Tort Liability seminars provide opportunities for professionals engaged in the defense of governmental entities to hear from leading litigators, professors, and other industry experts who share valuable insights and strategies in defending government. The success of this Committee and its annual seminar is based in large part on the quality and well-known reputations of many of its speakers who come from a variety of backgrounds, including the top professors and professionals in the field.\n\nWe are always looking for steering committee and seminar planning committee members. We are also working on a governmental attorney initiative to find ways to get public sector attorneys more engaged in our committee while recognizing the budget constraints some of these attorneys might face.\n\nWe will find a role for anyone looking to get involved so please reach out to learn more about the Governmental Liability Committee.\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nJoin the Governmental Liability Committee.\n\nRegister for the Civil Rights and Governmental Tort Liability Seminar and join us for our business meeting to learn more about how you can get involved.\n\nReach out to the Committee Chair Ryan Kunhart at rkunhart@ddlawgroup.com or Vice Chair Monté Williams at monte.williams@steptoe-johnson.com.\n\nTracy Kolb Obtains a Defense Verdict in Medical Malpractice Case\n\nFollowing a six-day trial, Tracy Kolb secured a defense verdict for a small rural hospital in North Dakota. The estate for the Plaintiff sought $2.5 million in damages, alleging our hospital client was negligent because it did not have a policy that told a radiologist how to communicate a CT finding incidental to a critical, life-threatening pulmonary embolism, for which the patient was transferred from the hospital’s emergency department to another hospital to receive the higher level of necessary life-saving care. Everything about the patient’s condition was sent to the receiving hospital.\n\nA few years later, after surviving the pulmonary embolism, the patient returned to the emergency department suffering a stroke. The workup revealed the patient had metastatic kidney cancer, the origin of which was depicted on the earlier CT, that had spread to the brain and lungs. The patient did not survive the cancer. It was unfortunate and unintended that the patient’s cancer was not recognized earlier, but it was not a consequence of the absence of a policy by the hospital. In less than an hour of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict finding the hospital was not at fault.\n\nTracy has been practicing law in North Dakota since 1995. She has practiced in the private and public sector handling litigation, administrative and legislative matters, and legal and regulatory compliance matters, particularly in the health care setting. Her private practice has been devoted primarily to litigation, mostly representing health care providers—hospitals, clinics, physicians, nurses, and long-term care facilities—and the defense of medical malpractice cases. Tracy has also represented providers in state regulatory licensing and disciplinary matters.\n\nBelle v. Sea World Parks & Entertainment LLC d/b/a Busch Gardens\n\nA Hillsborough County jury entered a defense verdict for Busch Gardens in Belle v. Sea World Parks & Entertainment LLC d/b/a Busch Gardens on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff alleged foot injuries resulting in two surgeries due to the Skyride door shutting twice onto her leg on July 14, 2018, at the Tampa theme park. In closing argument, Plaintiff’s counsel asked the jury to award just under $1.5 million in damages. The RumbergerKirk trial team of partners Rob Blank and Carie Hall convinced the jury there was no negligence on the part of Busch Gardens or its employee. Busch Gardens has moved for its attorneys’ fees and costs based on Plaintiff’s rejection of its proposal for settlement.\n\nKeep The Defense Wins Coming!\n\nPlease send 250–500-word summaries of your “wins,” including the case name, your firm name, your firm position, city of practice, and email address, in Word format, along with a recent color photo as an attachment (.jpg or .tiff), highest resolution file possible, to DefenseWins@dri.org.

Blessings in a Backpack is a national organization that provides food for school children on weekends, when they might otherwise go hungry. Blessings in a Backpack reports that 1 in 8 children in America experience food insecurity. This means they struggle with access to basic nutrition. During the school week, these children can be fed by federal programs that provide access to breakfasts and lunches for free or reduced cost. But on the weekends, they do not have this same access.\n\nBlessings in a Backpack provides breakfasts and lunches for the weekends in small bags that are placed discreetly in the children's backpacks on Fridays at school, so the children can take it home for the weekend to have access to nutritious meals until they return to school on Monday. For the 2022-2023 school year, Blessings in a Backpack distributed over 3.3 million bags of food to children at 1270 schools across the country!\n\nFor the next two years, DRI is honored to partner with Blessings in a Backpack and has pledged to host 20 bag-packing events at DRI events. This means that DRI is committed to providing at least 10,000 bags of weekend food to school children around the country, in the areas where DRI will be hosting our seminars.

We’ll open with a panel from the Center for Law & Public Policy’s Social Inflation Task Force to discuss how to combat critical plaintiff tactics and strategies. Then we will assess these concepts in the context of jury selection and watch as a real, impartial jury is seated for a mock case summation. The mock jury will hear argument from top defense attorneys on a disputed liability, high damages case. Attendees will watch as the jurors deliberate the verdict live and lead through a moderated discussion of their views on parties, facts, and overall claim value. Then, after the jury has deliberated, attendees will be allowed to engage with the jury in a group discussion to better understand the key arguments, facts, and positions that drove the jury to their verdict. On Friday we will have a round table discussion on these issues along with a fabulous session from David Mann, jury consultant and nationally-known story teller, to help us develop effective narratives that are persuasive to juries. We will end our seminar a discussion on the ethical issues encountered in joint representations. This seminar is truly unlike any other.
