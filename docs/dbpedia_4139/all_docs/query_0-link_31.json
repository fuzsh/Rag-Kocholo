He has four children and two nicknames.\n\nFrom the 1957 cruise book from USS Lexington (CV 16):\n\nExecutive Officer, Edward H. Seiler, Jr., Commander, USN\n\nCommander Seiler was born in New Orleans, still his home, on August 13 and graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1939. Beginning his naval career as a junior officer aboard the \"Old\" LEXINGTON (CV-2), he was designated a naval aviator in 1942 and from July 1944 to January 1945 was Commanding Officer of Patrol Bomber Squadron 207.\n\nAfter serving two years as Executive Officer of Air Transport Squadron 22, he attended the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Va., from which he graduated in June 1950.\n\nTours of duty with CNATRA Staff and Fleet Air Wings Atlantic Staff were followed by his assignment to NAS Norfolk as Operations Officer and subsequently as Executive Officer. Commander Seiler returned to the LEXINGTON in 1956 as Executive Officer. He was relieved by Commander Frank Malinasky on 2 September 1957.\n\nPhotographs\n\nFrom the Lucky Bag\n\nNavy Directories & Officer Registers\n\nThe \"Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps\" was published annually from 1815 through at least the 1970s; it provided rank, command or station, and occasionally billet until the beginning of World War II when command/station was no longer included. Scanned copies were reviewed and data entered from the mid-1840s through 1922, when more-frequent Navy Directories were available.\n\nThe Navy Directory was a publication that provided information on the command, billet, and rank of every active and retired naval officer. Single editions have been found online from January 1915 and March 1918, and then from three to six editions per year from 1923 through 1940; the final edition is from April 1941.\n\nThe entries in both series of documents are sometimes cryptic and confusing. They are often inconsistent, even within an edition, with the name of commands; this is especially true for aviation squadrons in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nAlumni listed at the same command may or may not have had significant interactions; they could have shared a stateroom or workspace, stood many hours of watch togetherâ€¦ or, especially at the larger commands, they might not have known each other at all. The information provides the opportunity to draw connections that are otherwise invisible, though, and gives a fuller view of the professional experiences of these alumni in Memorial Hall.\n\nWilliam Thorn '32 was also lost in this crash."
