        "text": "A report claims that Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead franchise has been scrapped at Netflix following the director’s lackluster Rebel Moon films.\n\nBack in January 2021, James Hibberd at Entertainment Weekly reported that alongside Army of the Dead, Netflix had also invested in a 4-hour animated television series set in the franchise.\n\nHibberd detailed that the series was expected to “dive into the plague’s origin story, which is another genre departure for the project as most zombie movies and TV shows tend to either keep the origin of the outbreak frustratingly vague (like The Walking Dead) or give devote only a single scene to the subject (like 28 Days Later).”\n\n“I’ve done a very deep dive with the why of the zombie plague and where it starts,” Snyder explained. “Sufficed to say, that it does come from Area 51 — that’s in the film’s opening scene – and then the whole cast is in the animated series, along with Christian Slater as the bad guy. We really do a super deep dive on where this like zombie plague came from.”\n\nREAD: ‘Rebel Moon’ Actress Sofia Boutella: “There Are Not Enough Roles For Women — Roles, Period, And Interesting Roles”\n\nBorys Kit at The Hollywood Reporter noted in July 2021 that the franchise had expanded to a sequel as well as the animated series and the Army of Thieves prequel.\n\nKit detailed, “On the docket is a sequel he is developing with the first movie’s co-writer, Shay Hatten, something he would tackle after Rebel Moon.”\n\nNow, TheWrap’s Drew Taylor reports that plans for an animated series as well as a sequel, Planet of the Dead have been cancelled.\n\nHe detailed, “The animated series was quietly canceled, along with plans for subsequent films.”\n\nWhile it appears the franchise has been scrapped, Snyder’s wife, Deborah, attempted to spin a positive noting that Six Flags theme parks will have Army of the Dead themes during Halloween. She said, “It’s going to be a really cool experience.”\n\nREAD: Zack Snyder Reacts To Negative ‘Rebel Moon’ Reviews: “I Don’t Really Have A Rebuttal To The Reviews”\n\nThis report comes in the wake of Rebel Moon – Part One: Director’s Cut failing to break into Netflix’s Top 10 movies the week it released.\n\nThe film arrived on Netflix on August 2nd and was unable to surpass 3.6 million views, which was how many views 10th ranked The Marksman for the week of July 29 to August 4.\n\nThe original release of Rebel Moon back in December 2023 topped Netflix’s English-language films for the week it debuted with 54.1 million hours viewed and 23.9 million views. In its second week, total hours viewed and views increased to 77 million hours viewed and 34 million views. That’s a 42.3% increase in total hours viewed and total views.\n\nHowever, by the time Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver debuted in April it only brought in 44.2 million hours views and 21.4 million views. In its second week, viewership fell to 38.8 million hours viewed and 18.8 million views.\n\nThat’s a decline of 12.2% in total hours watched and 12.1% in total views.\n\nWhat do you make of this report that Snyder’s Army of the Dead franchise has been scrapped at Netflix?"
