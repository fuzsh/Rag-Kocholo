The songs are used to advance the plot or develop the film’s characters, but some musical films include the songs in as production numbers. A subgenre of the musical film is the musical comedy, which includes a strong element of humor as well as the usual music, dancing and storyline.\n\nMusical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if there is a live audience watching. In a sense, the viewer becomes the deictic audience, as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it. Examples of musicals include Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, Burlesque, Mama Mia, I Want to Sing!, and Tangled.\n\nCharacter to watch: Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music.

Epics are more ambitious in scope than other film genres, and their ambitious nature helps to differentiate them from similar genres such as the period piece or adventure film. They typically entail high production values, a sweeping musical score (often by an acclaimed film composer), and an ensemble cast of bankable stars, placing them among the most expensive of films to produce.\n\nHistorical epics are epic films that take place in the historical past, often focusing on people who alter the course of history. A number of historical epics have been set in ancient times, particularly in Rome, Greece, or Egypt. Examples of epics and historical films include The Young Victoria, The Right Stuff, The Last Emperor, and Apocalypse Now.\n\nCharacter to watch: Liam Neeson in Schindler’s List.

Often, a crime and gangster film will glorify the police as well. Some crime and gangster films, like the Untouchables and Public Enemies are historic films as well because they portray stories about actual public figures. Crime films may fall under several different subgenres, including crime comedies, crime horrors, crime thrillers, detective films, and heist films.\n\nThe stylistic approach to a crime film varies from realistic portrayals of real-life criminal figures, to the far-fetched evil doings of imaginary arch-villains. Criminal acts are almost always glorified in these movies. Examples of crime and gangster films include Bonnie and Clyde, The Godfather, Casino, and Goodfellas.\n\nCharacter to watch: Charlize Theron in Monster. In this true story, Theron plays Aileen Wuornos, a Daytona Beach prostitute who became a serial killer.

As such, Westerns are devoted to telling stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the American Old West. They are considered one of the oldest, most enduring genres with very recognizable plots, elements, and characters. Classic Western scenes include six-guns, horses, dusty towns and trails, cowboys, and Indians.\n\nWesterns have been re-defined, re-invented and expanded, dismissed, re-discovered, and spoofed. Many subgenres have developed including Spaghetti, Revisionist, Acid, Contemporary, Horror, and Science fiction. Examples of Westerns include The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, True Grit, Tombstone, and The Unforgiven.\n\nCharacter to watch: Frances Fisher in Unforgiven.
