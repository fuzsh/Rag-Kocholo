        "text": "RDR2 is just a boring horse-simulator.\n\nI am so tired of playing this game. I have it in Rockstar’s Game Launcher and I played it and just didn’t enjoy it at all. It’s really just all about graphics and it wasn’t fun.\n\nSo the graphics in this game look pretty alright, great actually even compared to many other modern games. The amount of detail, the visual fidelity in itself is something that can keep you there in the game for hours. But then when we look at gameplay, well… It’s just not a good gameplay. It’s very sluggish, you constantly fall off a horse and there really isn’t much to do apart from robbing someone or brushing your horse. All you do the whole game is watch cutscenes and they are also very boring and I don’t like the character and don’t want to listen to them talk, yet the game constantly just shoves them in front of you. So in the story you just shoot stuff and then there are those dialogues everywhere, then you ride a horse and heists in the story fail and you go on to another heist, rinse and repeat. Then the main character just dies under sad music which is really not sad and just boring and honestly it is cheesy that he at some point dies. I really didn’t care cause I didn’t like the character to begin with.\n\nSo gameplay is like super slow and it’s all the same. You press a button, you see this slow animation and it just grows on you, the lack of content gets boring fast. Same random events where you save a guy from something, then you find him in a town and he gives you a free item thing. It happens over and over. Next thing is that when you kill some named NPC they don’t die forever, they come back and the game doesn’t remember that you killed them. I was shooting everyone in the game and same guys just kept spawning over and over and it’s just lame. A really lame approach to game development. So the story is not good, the gameplay is not good, everything is just bad. Then the game sends bounty hunters that never give up and they are infinite. Don’t devs at Rockstar know that spawning enemies infinitely is bad game design?\n\nAnother thing, that snowy area where it’s just all snow. It’s a cool area because of snow tessellation and there is atmosphere and stuff but it just was so tiny, such a beautiful area and too small. Really wanted that section of the map be much bigger. In the game it’s mostly just either forests or deserts and it gets old in contrast to snowy area.\n\nThe story is just super cheesy, it’s about some gang of homeless guys trying to rob banks and they just constantly fail and split eventually. It was just done to set up events for the first game. Then there really isn’t much in gameplay, it’s basically more of an interactive movie with gameplay elements. Just press buttons, ride a horse by holding W + Shift and shoot some enemies occasionally. Obviously no cars, no planes, nothing like that because places the game in and time it’s set in is just boring. Weapons are also old and not very good. Can’t dive underwater like in GTA 5 and overall the game just pales in comparison to Grand Theft Auto. There are just forests everywhere, some shacks and houses and really not much to explore. Even if you want to just run around the game pulls you into dialogues constantly and you don’t really want to hear them. Gameplay is just lacking in this game and so is everything. It’s really just overhyped and I didn’t enjoy it. Playing GTA 5 is more fun and gameplay there is miles better.\n\nThis game is not worth it."
