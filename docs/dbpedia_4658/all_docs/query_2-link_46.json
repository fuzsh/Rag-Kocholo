        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nNetflix's Korean drama \"Squid Game\" has been renewed for a second season.\n\nThe thriller follows a group of contestants competing in children's games with deadly twists.\n\nHere are 14 other movies and shows you can watch while you wait for new episodes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Battle Royale,\" based on the novel by Koushun Takami, influenced a new wave of survival thriller stories.\n\nSummary:\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Koushun Takami, \"Battle Royale\" is about 42 ninth graders who are sent to a deserted island and forced by a totalitarian government to fight each other until only one remains alive.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\n\"Squid Game\" writer and director of Hwang Dong-hyuk told Variety that he was inspired by the \"Battle Royale\" comics when coming up with the idea for the hit Netflix series. While \"Battle Royale\" isn't the first of the last-man-standing survival genre, it's certainly one of the most well-known examples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"3%\" also contains ingenious and somewhat dangerous challenges for the prize of living in a utopia.\n\nSummary:\n\n\"3%\" is a Brazilian science-fiction series set in a dystopian future where the world is split into two zones: the Inland, where the majority live in poor, filthy conditions; and the Offshore, where the 3% live in utopian harmony. To get to the Offshore, every year 20-year-olds must take part in and beat a series of challenges until 3% of the candidates are left standing. The series follows a group of young adults participating in the challenges, some of whom want to get to a better life on the Offshore, and others who want to destroy the current system to build a better, more equal one.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nIf you found it challenging to stomach some of the more graphic scenes in \"Squid Game,\" you'll get your fill of high-stakes competition with a lot less bloodletting in \"3%.\" Both shows take simple games and challenges and turn them into something where contestants must use their wits in order to survive, but the games in \"3%\" have a smaller kill count — many participants are simply eliminated rather than killed, though some do die.\n\nAll four seasons are available on Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" series is the biggest franchise to use the battle royale survival format.\n\nSummary:\n\nBased on Suzanne Collins' dystopian YA series, \"The Hunger Games\" movies follow Katniss Everdeen, a girl who is sent by her district to battle 23 other teens to the death. In the process, she becomes the symbol of a revolution.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" is yet another prominent riff on the last-man-standing survival story, though the series' political and social message is even more overt. With a PG-13 rating, \"The Hunger Games\" is a lot less graphic than \"Squid Game\" — but the stakes are still high enough to keep you on edge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix's \"Alice in Borderland\" is a violent survival thriller.\n\nSummary:\n\nBased on the manga of the same name, \"Alice in Borderland\" is a thriller in which a group of people are trapped in an alternate dimension where they must compete in dangerous games to stay alive.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nIf you enjoyed the violence and intensity of the games of \"Squid Game,\" you'll probably enjoy the same in \"Alice in Borderland.\" The show gets you rooting for the main characters as they fight to survive in this new world.\n\nThe first two seasons are available on Netflix and Netflix has announced a second season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany fans have pointed out the similarities between \"As the Gods Will\" and \"Squid Game.\"\n\nSummary:\n\n\"As the Gods Will\" is a Japanese supernatural horror film about students who are forced to compete in deadly games in order to survive. The movie follows Shun Takahata (Sota Fukushi), a high school student who fights alongside his friends to discover who is behind them.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nSome viewers have pointed out the similarity between \"Squid Game\" and \"As the Gods Will\" on social media, particularly the \"Red Light, Green Light\" death game. However, director Hwang Dong-hyuk told The Korea Herald that he has been working on the show since 2008, whereas \"As the Gods Will\" came out in 2014. Regardless, if you are intrigued by the death games, this Japanese horror movie has more in store for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Darwin's Game\" is a supernatural survival series about a game being brought into real life.\n\nSummary:\n\nBased on the manga of the same name, \"Darwin's Game\" is about a supernatural mobile game that forces players to fight each other in real life. The main character, Kaname Sudo (voiced by Yūsuke Kobayashi), is tricked into joining the game and decides to try and end the game once and for all after his friends die playing it.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nIf you're looking for another story of deadly games, but with a supernatural twist, \"Darwin's Game\" will scratch that itch.\n\nSeason one of \"Darwin's Game\" is available on Netflix and Hulu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Black Mirror\" is a British anthology series with a distinctly dystopian view of technology.\n\nSummary:\n\nThink of Charlie Brooker's sci-fi anthology \"Black Mirror\" as a riff on \"The Twilight Zone,\" where each episode tells a different (and often star-studded) story in which newfangled technology plays a crucial and devastating role.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nWhere \"Squid Game\" offers incisive commentary on capitalistic greed, \"Black Mirror\" skewers humans' faith in and over-reliance on technology. While the series' episodes range in style from psychological thriller to straight-up horror, almost all of them function as cautionary tales: the characters may not be in teal jumpsuits, but they may as well be.\n\nAll six seasons are available on Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed is the center of \"Rat Race\" as much as it is in \"Squid Game.\"\n\nSummary:\n\nFor his and his friends' amusement, eccentric tycoon Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) gives strangers each a key to a locker 563 miles away that holds $2 million. The first one there to grab the cash can keep it.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nLike in \"Squid Game,\" the rich are taking advantage of the working class in \"Rat Race.\" This time, though, it's a comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" has similar survival aspects to \"Squid Game.\"\n\nSummary:\n\nAn adaptation of the apocalyptic comic book series of the same name, \"The Walking Dead\" follows groups of survivors who try and stay alive in a zombie apocalypse. The series begins with police officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) who awakens from a coma and must lead a group of survivors to safety.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" may not be a game, but it's still about survival, as humans must stay alive in a world where they are no longer the biggest threat. If you loved \"Squid Game\" for its plot twists, character development, and gore, you'll find plenty to like in this zombie series.\n\nAll 11 seasons are available on Netflix and AMC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTNT's \"Snowpiercer\" adapts the French comic book for a second time after Bong Joon-ho's successful adaptation.\n\nSummary:\n\nLike Bong Joon-ho's 2013 movie of the same name, TNT's \"Snowpiercer\" takes place in an apocalyptic dystopian future in which Earth is a frozen wasteland. The remaining humans live divided by social class on the titular train, which travels around the world generating enough heat and electricity to keep them warm. But the social structure of the train isn't without its detractors, and soon, the lower classes are mounting a revolution.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\n\"Snowpiercer\" may not be a battle royale, but both the movie and the TV series are violent thrillers where people of different social classes are fighting for survival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Money Heist\" is another global hit series for Netflix.\n\nSummary:\n\n\"Money Heist\" is an intense Spanish drama about a group of criminals who try and pull a heist in the Royal Mint of Spain while surrounded by the police. There are hundreds of plot twists as the robbers' mastermind, The Professor, plays a game of cat and mouse with the authorities.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\n\"Money Heist\" may not be about a survival game, but it's just as intense and has just as many appealing characters. Like \"Squid Game,\" it's also a \"Money Heist\" is also a global phenomenon.\n\nAll five seasons are available on Netflix. There's also a Korean remake on Netflix called \"Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Zom100: Bucket List of the Dead\" uses the apocalypse to skewer corporate culture.\n\nSummary:\n\nThere are plenty of zombie stories out there, but not many that frame the apocalypse as an opportunity for freedom rather than the end of the world. That's exactly what happens in \"Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead,\" which is based on a manga series of the same name.\n\nOffice worker Akira Tendo is used to a monotonous life of being overworked. But when the zombie apocalypse hits, he's determined to finally live life to the fullest, and puts together a bucket list of things he wants to do before he dies.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\n\nWhile \"Zom 100\" is more of a dark comedy than a thriller, its apocalyptic elements will still appeal to anyone looking for another survival story. Like \"Squid Game,\" \"Zom 100\" also functions as a social critique — this time, of corporate culture and worker exploitation.\n\nThe live-action movie is available on Netflix; the first season of the anime is available on Crunchyroll.\n\nRead next\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nAdvertisement"
