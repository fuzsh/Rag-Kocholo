        "text": "Perhaps not surprisingly, by the time I was eleven years old (1979) I was a movie buff. I was not permitted to see theatrical releases and the owning of a VCR was still a few years down the road, so any movie I managed to see was on television (i.e., chopped up, panned-and-scanned, and usually spliced with commercials). Thankfully many movies are powerful enough to withstand this abuse, so my enthusiasm for films was not hindered by it.\n\n(A fawning sidenote here: I was so hungry for movies that I became a devoted fan of a movie-review program aired on our PBS affiliate out of Chicago. At the time it was called \"Sneak Previews.\" I loved that show, and it was a staple of my week. Here I could see clips from movies that were forbidden to me, and watch you and Mr. Siskel discuss those movies with the enthusiasm that I felt, and that no one else seemed to share with me. I remember once I abandoned my family's 4th of July fireworks picnic just so I could watch you review \"Blade Runner,\" a movie that I did not get to see until several years later. One of my fondest childhood memories.)\n\nAnyway, because the only movies I watched were those available on television in the era before cable, I saw a good number of classics, especially on the reliable PBS, which introduced me to Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Thanks to this exposure, and my becoming accustomed black-and-white films at an early age, I was a relatively sophisticated, though limited, film-viewer long before I reached high school, if one could forgive my complete ignorance of anything made in another country or after 1972. In this light, I support your contention that AFI's Top 100 Movies list might luckily hinder the business of the Dead Teenager movie. I have never much cared for the Dead Teenager flick, but I've always been a Hitchcock fan. And imagine my pleasure when the VCR became a household item, with over a decade of movies for me to catch up on."
