About this list: A list of every film that James from Dead Meat has ever covered in any format on his YouTube channel or Patreon account. If you don't know what Dead Meat is and you're a horror fan, you definitely should check out his channel. The channel creator, James Anthony Janisse, produces extremely high quality content. There are several series on the channel: • The Kill Count • The Dead Meat Podcast • What's Your Favorite Scary Movie? • The Cut Comparison • Production Tales from Hell • The Dead Meat Horror Awards • Horror Royal Rumble • Ranked • They Talk! • Movie reviews on Patreon • Movie watch-alongs on Patreon I've attempted to list all the films in chronological order of when they were covered, but that was tricky for a few reasons. If James has covered a film more than once, such as for Patreon, the podcast, and / or a kill count, then the kill count's placement takes precedence even if the review was done first. I just figured his flagship series should take priority. Also, starting in May 2021, James began occasionally remaking older kill counts entirely, releasing a new version of it. When he does this, I will move that kill count to the bottom – so essentially, the most recent kill count version of a film will always be the most recent entry. This list will continue to be updated weekly for as long as I am bodily able to do so! -------------------- Kill counts of media not included on Letterboxd, or media that is prone to be removed: • Sunday, March 11, 2018: The Look-See Season 1 Kill Count (Crypt TV collaboration). • Sunday, March 25, 2018: Sunny Family Cult Seasons 1 & 2 Kill Count (Crypt TV collaboration). • Friday, July 13, 2018: Never Hike Alone Kill Count. • Sunday, October 7, 2018: The Look-See Season 2 Kill Count (Crypt TV collaboration). • Sunday, October 13, 2018: Sunny Family Cult Season 3 Kill Count (Crypt TV collaboration). • Monday, April 1, 2019: Boy Meets World Season 5, Episode 17: \"And Then There Was Shawn\" Kill Count, uploaded as the \"Avengers: Infinity War Kill Count\" on April Fool's Day as a prank. • Sunday, June 16, 2019: Mordeo Season 1 Kill Count (Crypt TV collaboration). • Wednesday, September 11, 2019: \"Social Mediasochist\" Music Video Kill Count. • Sunday, July 5 & 12, 2020: Stranger Things Season 1 Kill Count; (Part 1) and (Part 2). • Tuesday, October 20, 2020: Never Hike in the Snow Kill Count. • Tuesday, October 27, 2020 and Friday, October 30, 2020: Stranger Things Season 2 Kill Count; (Part 1) and (Part 2). • Sunday, May 30, 2021: \"Social Mediasochist II\" Music Video Kill Count. • Friday, June 17, 2022: Stranger Things Season 3 Kill Count. • Sunday, October 9, 2022: Chucky Season One Kill Count. • Friday, September 15, 2023: Mortal Kombat (2011) Video Game Kill Count. • Friday, September 29, 2023: Ice Nine Kills The Silver Scream Music Videos Kill Count. • Friday, October 13, 2023: Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash Graphic Novel Kill Count (Hosted by Zoran). • Sunday, October 15, 2023: Mortal Kombat X (2015) Video Game Kill Count. • Friday, October 20, 2023: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (2010) Video Game Kill Count (Hosted by Chelsea). • Friday, October 27, 2023: Emesis Blue (2023) YouTube Feature Film Kill Count. • Friday, December 1, 2023: Never Hike Alone 2 Kill Count.",
