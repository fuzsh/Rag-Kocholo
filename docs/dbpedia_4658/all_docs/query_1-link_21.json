        "text": "Explore the most terrifying monsters in horror cinema.\n\nScared to Death: The Thrill of Horror Film features more than 50 props and costumes from film and television including A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, The Walking Dead, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh, The Thing, Us, Vampire Hunter D,, and The Addams Family.\n\nThemed gallery sections evoke the unsettling sensations associated with cinematic terror. A vampire’s lair drips with blood; zombies shamble through an abandoned containment center; and a thicket of suspended corpses frames a killer’s den. In addition, the exhibition offers extensive exhibit films, oral history interviews with the genre’s top directors, and interactive photo ops.\n\nDue to some graphic content, this exhibit is recommended for ages 13 and up.\n\nScared to Death: The Thrill of Horror Film is included with museum admission and is free for MoPOP Members."
