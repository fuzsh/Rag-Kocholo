        "text": "Heroic Bloodshed\n\nThis action sub-genre is defined by values like duty, brotherhood, honor, redemption, and the protection of the vulnerable. It was initially created in Hong Kong cinema but has since made its way around the world.\n\nEx. The Killer (1989), Hard Boiled (1992).\n\nMilitary Action\n\nWhile some movies may incorporate various military characters, settings, themes, and events, this particular sub-genre focuses on their exploits and suggests these events are entertaining rather than tragic. Some of the best Michael Bay movies come to mind.\n\nEx. Commando (1985), G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009).\n\nEspionage\n\nEspionage action movies are similar to military action movies in that they’re intended for excitement and entertainment rather than focusing on the political and psychological aspects of espionage. James Bond movies might be the most recognizable but there are plenty of others. Ex. Casino Royale (2006), Mission: Impossible III (2006).\n\nWuxia Action\n\nThis highly specific sub-genre focuses on martial arts as both a form of excitement, but also as a chivalrous act of protection and honor.\n\nEx. Hero (2002), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).\n\nDisaster\n\nDisaster movies are defined by a large amount of destruction, specifically from naturally occurring events, where characters try to survive. If an alien force is the force of destruction, the film will be categorized as science fiction rather than a straight disaster movie. Ex.The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Dante’s Peak (1997).\n\nAdventure\n\nMovies in the adventure genre are defined by a journey, often including some form of pursuit, and can take place in any setting. Some of Steven Spielberg's best movies capture the essence of what makes this genre so exciting.\n\nEx. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Lawrence of Arabia (1962).\n\nSuperhero\n\nThe superhero movie is defined by characters not only with supernatural abilities but using those abilities for altruistic purposes. If the film has superpowers that are used for questionable purposes, it would be more of a supernatural thriller versus a “superhero” movie. Marvel movies have been dominating of late but they only occupy a small percentage of the best superhero movies ever made.\n\nEx. Iron Man (2008), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014).\n\nTraditional\n\nTraditional animation is defined by hand-drawn and painted images that are assembled to animate a cartoon that tells a story.\n\nEx. Robin Hood (1973), The Flight of Dragons (1982).\n\nStop Motion\n\nStop motion animation is defined by taking real objects and adjusting them frame by frame to simulate motion and emotion. Stop motion refers to the style of photography, while stop motion such as claymation and sometimes puppet animation can fall into multiple sub-genres.\n\nEx. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and some of the best stop motion movies of all time.\n\nClaymation\n\nClaymation is a form of stop motion animation, except the subjects used are built specifically out of clay.\n\nEx. Chicken Run (2000), Early Man (2018) and many of the best Rankin Bass Christmas movies.\n\nCutout\n\nThis is where shapes are cut out and placed on top of one another to make figures and settings, all used to tell a story.\n\nEx. South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut (1999).\n\nComputer Generated Imagery\n\nCGI is the most common form of modern animation, where modeling programs and software are used to animate cartoons.\n\nEx. Shrek (2001), Rango (2011) and Pixar's incredible short films.\n\nPuppetry\n\nPuppetry animation is where puppets, including hand, stick, shadow, ventriloquist, and marionettes are used to tell a story.\n\nEx. Team America: World Police (2004).\n\nLive-Action\n\nLive-action animation is where animation, of any kind, is mixed with real-life subjects to create a single world.\n\nEx. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Space Jam (1996).\n\nAction-Comedy\n\nThe action-comedy sub-genre incorporates humorous actions within the action, using the exciting events in the story for laughs.\n\nEx. Hot Fuzz (2007), Charlie’s Angels (2000).\n\nDark Comedy (Black Comedy)\n\nDark comedy (or Black Comedy) is defined by using attitudes and events that would normally be objectionable to set up humorous situations.\n\nEx. Very Bad Things (1998), Fargo (1996) and more of the best dark comedy movies ever made.\n\nRomantic Comedy\n\nRomantic comedies (aka Rom-Coms) are defined by comedy derived from relationship frustrations that are intimate in nature. This includes any combination of gender or situation across the sexual spectrum with films that include some of the best romantic quotes ever written. Some of Woody Allen's best movies redefined the genre.\n\nEx. Sleepless in Seattle (1993), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003).\n\nBuddy Comedy\n\nA buddy comedy is defined by at least two individuals who we follow through a series of humorous events. Often their (platonic) relationship is the main source of comedy in the story.\n\nEx. Rush Hour (1998), Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle (2003).\n\nRoad Comedy\n\nRoad comedies are defined by humorous situations derived from a journey along a set path, and often feature a set of stops and characters along the way that forces the protagonist(s) further down the road.\n\nEx. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), Dumb and Dumber (1994).\n\nSlapstick Comedy\n\nSlapstick comedy is defined by humor derived from physical movement, harm, or frustration that requires little to no dialogue.\n\nEx. The Party (1968), Mouse Hunt (1997).\n\nParody\n\nI’ve decided to put parody, spoof, and satire next to one another because they’re often thought to be synonyms, but truthfully they are not. A parody mocks and specifically targets a single piece of art or connected body of work. A parody is more precise, and more limited.\n\nEx. MacGruber (2010), Spaceballs (1987).\n\nSpoof\n\nA spoof is broader than a parody because it mocks an entire genre or collection of similar, but separate works. Where parody targets a specific piece of art or entertainment, spoofs target the entire genre.\n\nEx. The Naked Gun (1988), Not Another Teen Movie (2001).\n\nSatire\n\nSatire movies are the broadest of the three in that it mocks overall ideas, vices, human nature, institutions, or any number of concepts that don’t necessarily have a specific connection to another piece of art.\n\nCaper\n\nThe caper sub-genre is defined by a group of criminals, often non-violent, who set out on a heist or job. A caper is often humorous and less serious in nature when compared to the other crime sub-genres. Ex. Ocean’s Eleven (2001), A Fish Called Wanda (1988).\n\nHeist\n\nThe heist sub-genre is defined by a criminal, or group of criminals, who set out to steal something valuable, and have a more serious tone when compared to a caper story. The subjects must navigate a set of obstacles and avoid law enforcement, and often the “getaway” is incorporated.\n\nEx. Heat (1995), The Score (2001).\n\nGangster\n\nA gangster story follows and explores the world of organized crime. A film may include organized crime, but if the majority of the story doesn't explore organized crime, it wouldn’t fall into this sub-genre.\n\nEx. Goodfellas (1990), Boyz in the Hood (1991) are just some of the best gangster movies (not to be confused with the best Mafia movies).\n\nCop (Police)\n\nThe cop sub-genre follows a street cop (not a detective) who deals with criminals, crime, and the overall lifestyle as an officer of the law. You might find that some lists will have cop movies and detective movies intertwined, but for our list, we’ll focus on the beat-cops.\n\nEx. End of Watch (2012), Beverly Hills Cop (1984).\n\nDetective\n\nA detective story follows an investigator or set of investigators, either private or as a representative of a government, and follows the clues and revelations of a particular case, or set of cases.\n\nMedical Drama\n\nThe medical sub-genre focuses on the inherent drama of health conditions, the inner workings of hospitals, the relationship between doctors and medical staff, and the medical industry. There are medical procedurals that follow the day-to-day life of health care professionals. Ex. House (2004), Bringing Out The Dead (1999).\n\nLegal Drama\n\nThe legal-drama sub-genre is defined by lawyers, judges, and legal complications that may be peripheral but not enveloped by the criminal justice system or matters relating to crime and punishment. While a legal drama may dip into criminal justice matters, the real focus is on characters at a law firm or judges chambers rather than a crime. Ex. The Practice (1997), The Firm (1993).\n\nPolitical Drama\n\nThe political-drama sub-genre focuses on the complications and inherent drama that takes place inside the world of politics. This can range anywhere from local government to national political climates. Ex. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), House of Cards (2013).\n\nAnthropological Drama\n\nThe anthropological sub-genre focuses on the drama derived from human behavior and society at large, and while the story may feature a central protagonist, the story might focus on a specific culture or a broad representation of society.\n\nEx. City of God (2002), some of Spike Lee's best movies.\n\nContemporary Fantasy\n\nA contemporary fantasy story introduces elements of fantasy into or around a world that closely resembles the time period when it was conceived. Urban fantasy can serve as contemporary fantasy but must take place in an urban setting whereas contemporary fantasy can be set anywhere that resembles the corresponding time period. Ex. Harry Potter series (2001-2011), The Chronicles of Narnia (2005).\n\nUrban Fantasy\n\nAn urban fantasy is a story introduces elements of fantasy and is set entirely in an urban environment. The urban environment can be real, fictional, modern, or inspired by history, but the story must take place and deal with concepts and themes related to an urban environment. Ex. Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV) (1997), Supernatural (TV) (2005).\n\nDark Fantasy\n\nA dark fantasy is a story where elements of fantasy are introduced into a hostile and frightening world. If a significant portion of the story takes place in a world that has a range of circumstances, mood, and tone it would most likely be categorized as a high fantasy or general fantasy. Ex. Pan’s Labyrinth (2006), Solomon Kane (2009).\n\nHigh Fantasy\n\nHigh fantasy can also be referred to as epic fantasy, and introduces elements of fantasy in a fictional setting, and will include romance, battles, and mythical creatures. High fantasy is the fantasy genre equivalent of a historical epic or a science fiction space opera.\n\nEx. The Lord of the Rings (2001), Game of Thrones (2011).\n\nHistorical Movie Genre List\n\nHistorical Genre\n\nThe historical genre can be split into two sections. One deals with accurate representations of historical accounts which can include biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs. The other section is made up of fictional movies that are placed inside an accurate depiction of a historical setting.\n\nThe accuracy of a historical story is measured against historical accounts, not fact, as there can never be a perfectly factual account of any event without first-hand experience.\n\nHistorical Event\n\nThe historical event genre focuses on a story that creates a dramatized depiction of an event that exists in popular accounts of history. This is different from a biography in that it focuses on an event.\n\nEx. Apollo 13 (1995), Lincoln (2012)\n\nBiography\n\nA biography (or biopic) is a story that details the life and is told by someone other than the subject.\n\nA biography will often span a large portion of the subject's life, but in some rare cases, it may focus on the time period where that person’s life had the greatest effect on history and society.\n\nEx. A Beautiful Mind (2001), Catch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nHistorical Epic\n\nA historical epic is the dramatized account of a large scale event that has an attached historical account. They often feature battles, romance, and journeys, and will commonly revise history or provide assumptions that fill in gaps in the account of the historical event. Ex. Ben-Hur (1959), Troy (2004)\n\nHistorical Fiction\n\nHistorical fiction takes place during a historical time period, and will often take a more liberal approach to representing history for the sake of drama and entertainment. Historical fiction may use real-life events and people to build context, but they’re meant to be accepted as a supposition rather than serve as an accurate historical account. Ex. Spartacus (1960), Titanic (1997)\n\nPeriod Piece\n\nThe difference between a period piece and historical fiction is slight, but the main difference is a general omission or a lack of necessity for real-life characters or events to provide context. Period pieces are merely defined by taking place in, and accurately depicting the time period as opposed to specific lives, events, or accounts.\n\nEx. The Age of Innocence (1993), Barry Lyndon (1975)\n\nAlternate History\n\nAlternate history is defined by the rewriting of historical events for the sake of speculative outcomes. These movies commonly focus on important, highly influential moments that often lead to alternate futures. Some of these movies may even include supernatural elements. Ex. The Man in the High Castle (2015), Inglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nHorror sub-genres\n\nHorror Genre\n\nThe horror genre is centered upon depicting terrifying or macabre events for the sake of entertainment. A thriller might tease the possibility of a terrible event, whereas a horror film will deliver all throughout the film. The best horror movies are designed to get the heart pumping and to show us a glimpse of the unknown.\n\nGhost\n\nA ghost movie uses the spirit or soul of a deceased creature to introduce elements of horror. These movies can take place in any time period and are only required to evoke terror through the use of ghosts.\n\nEx.The Frighteners (1996), The Others (2001)\n\nMonster\n\nA monster movie uses a deformed or supernatural creature or set of creatures, to introduce elements of horror. These movies can also take place in any time period or setting, and their only real requirement is that the antagonist is can be categorized as a monster. Ex. The Babadook (2014), Pumpkinhead (1988)\n\nWerewolf\n\nA werewolf movie introduces elements of horror through the use of a human or set of humans that transform into a wolf-like creatures. Sometimes these werewolves have the ability to shape-shift at will, but in other cases, their transformation is dictated by a full moon. The only requirement is the use of the werewolf as the antagonist.\n\nEx. An American Werewolf in London (1981), The Wolfman (1941) are just some of the best werewolf movies ever made.\n\nVampire\n\nA vampire movie introduces elements of horror through the use of undead, immortal creatures that drink blood. They can be set in any time and place and must only use vampires as the antagonist. Some vampire movies feature vampires as the protagonist, but this is often used to build sympathy rather than as a device for terror.\n\nEx. Near Dark (1987) is one of the best '80s vampire movies while Nosferatu (1922) is one of the best vampire movies of all time.\n\nOccult\n\nOccult movies are defined by an extension of pure reason and use paranormal themes to introduce elements of horror. Occult literally translates into “hidden from view” and involves the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends scientific observation. Ex. Hereditary (2018), Rosemary’s Baby (1968)\n\nSlasher\n\nA slasher story introduces elements of horror through an antagonist or set of antagonists who stalk and murder a group of people, most commonly through the use of a blade or a sharp weapon. The slasher movie is so engrained in our movie culture, even non-slasher movies use some of the same techniques and tropes. Ex. Halloween (1978), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\n\nSplatter\n\nA splatter story introduces elements of horror by focusing on the vulnerability of the human body, and an emphasis on gore. Splatter movies often involve torture and attempt to present gore as an art form. Ex. Day of the Dead (1985), Jigoku (1960)\n\nFound Footage\n\nFound footage can be used for any genre, but it is most commonly used in horror and features footage that appears to be an existing and informal recording of events with the purpose of simulating real-life horrific events.\n\nEx. The Blair Witch Project (1999), V/H/S (2012)\n\nZombie\n\nThe zombie movie has roots all the way back to the '30s but it didn't really kick into high gear until the late 1960s. The general plot of the best zombie movies involves a group of characters trying to survive in a world overrun by zombies. The specific cause for the event ranges from infectious disease to experimental drugs gone wrong. Ex. Night of the Living Dead (1968), 28 Days Later (2002)\n\nTypes of Romance Movies\n\nRomance Genre\n\nThe romance genre is defined by intimate relationships. Sometimes these movies can have a darker twist, but the idea is to lean on the natural conflict derived from the pursuit of intimacy and love.\n\nRomance Drama\n\nThe romance-drama sub-genre is defined by the conflict generated from a romantic relationship. What makes a romance-drama different from a romantic-thriller is both the source of the drama but also the intentions and motivations that drive each character’s perspective. Ex. Revolutionary Road (2008), Blue Valentine (2010)\n\nRomance Thriller\n\nThe romance-thriller sub-genre is defined by a suspenseful story that includes and is most likely based around a romantic relationship. Some romantic thrillers can divert into psychological thrillers where the relationship is used to manipulate, but most focus on the characters attempting to make it out of events so that they may be together. Ex. The Saint (1997), Unfaithful (2002)\n\nList of Sci-Fi Genres\n\nScience Fiction Genre\n\nScience fiction movies are defined by a mixture of speculation and science. While fantasy will explain through or make use of magic and mysticism, science fiction will use the changes and trajectory of technology and science. Science fiction will often incorporate space, biology, energy, time, and any other observable science. Most of James Cameron's best movies lean heavily on science fiction.\n\nPost-Apocalyptic\n\nPost-apocalyptic movies are based around the occurrence, effects, and struggle generated by an apocalyptic event. While a dystopian story may incorporate a large war or apocalyptic event in its narrative history, it will include a centralized government that was formed after the event. Apocalyptic movies will not have a centralized government but may feature smaller societies and tribes as part of the story. Ex. 12 Monkeys (1995), 28 Days Later (2002)\n\nUtopian\n\nThe utopian genre is defined by the creator’s view of an idyllic world since each person has a unique view of what they deem to be the absence of struggle and incident, but generally, themes included in the movies are peace, harmony, and a world without hunger or homelessness. In the past, utopian movies have been tied to satire because the nature of a story is often conflict, and a utopian society is viewed as an unrealistic concept.\n\nEx. Gattaca (1997), Tomorrowland (2015)\n\nDystopian\n\nA dystopian story is one that features a world or society that serves as a contradiction to an idyllic world. Often there is a centralized and oppressive government or religion that dictates the value of citizens on a dehumanizing level, and may or may not incorporate a destructive event that drove the creation of that centralized institution.\n\nEx. Children of Men (2006), Equilibrium (2002)\n\nCyberpunk\n\nThe cyberpunk sub-genre is defined by a mixture of a desperate society oversaturated with the crime that takes place in a high tech world that includes cybernetic organisms, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. Ex. Blade Runner (1982), Elysium (2013) are just two of the best cyberpunk movies.\n\nSteampunk\n\nThe steampunk sub-genre is inspired by technology created during the 19th century and the industrial revolution and may be set in a speculative future, alternate universe, or revision of the 1800s.\n\nEx. Howl’s Moving Castle (2004), Mortal Engines (2018)\n\nTech Noir\n\nTech noir is similar to dystopian but defined by technology as the main source behind humanity's struggle and partial downfall. There is no requirement for a centralized government, and the only true aspect that places a story in this category is that technology threatens our reality. Ex. The Terminator (1984)\n\nSpace Opera\n\nA space opera is defined by a mixture of space warfare, adventure, and romance. The genre got its name from similarities to “soap operas” and “horse operas” due to their collective connection to melodrama. The term “space opera” has no connection to the music of any kind.\n\nEx. Star Wars: A New Hope (1977), The Fifth Element (1997)\n\nContemporary\n\nA contemporary science fiction story is set in the actual time period of its conception and introduces some form of a theoretical technology or scientific concept to serve as the story’s main source of conflict. This is different from tech-noir both due to scale and a strict time period.\n\nEx. Ex Machina (2014), Arrival (2016)\n\nMilitary\n\nA military science fiction story is defined by a strict focus on the military conflict in a speculative or future setting. While other movies may include space warfare, a military science fiction story will be limited to themes and events directly tied to military service and battle.\n\nEx. Starship Troopers (1997), Aliens (1986)\n\nThriller Movie Categories\n\nThriller Genre\n\nA thriller story is mostly about the emotional purpose, which is to elicit strong emotions, mostly dealing with generating suspense and anxiety. No matter what the specific plot, the best thrillers get your heart racing.\n\nPsychological\n\nA psychological thriller focuses and emphasizes the unstable psychological state of the characters inside the story. Often there is a mysterious set of circumstances, and a paranoia, warranted or otherwise, that catalyzes extreme actions from the characters. Many of Darren Aronofsky's best movies explore the dark depths inside the broken psyche of his protagonists. Ex. Gone Girl (2014), Memento (2000)\n\nMystery\n\nA mystery story can often be connected to the crime genre, but may not involve or use law enforcement or the justice system as the main characters or backdrop for the story. A mystery story is defined by the plot, and both the character’s and the viewer’s relationship with the motivations and reality behind the events that occur.\n\nIf you've seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, you know how mystery plays a part. Ex. Prisoners (2013), The Gift (2015)\n\nTechno\n\nThe techno-thriller sub-genre is defined by a conflict that takes place for or through Various forms of technology. What makes a techno-thriller different from various action sub-genres is the level of detail paid toward the underlying technical aspects of the technology and its effects.\n\nFilm Noir\n\nSome consider the definition of film noir to more of a style than a genre, because there is no requirement to be connected to a crime. There is, however, a natural overlap between style and genre in the best Film Noir movies. The central theme behind the noir sub-genre is a psychic imbalance that leads to self-hatred, aggression, or sociopathy. Recently, Neo-Noir movies have modified these themes to the modern day.\n\nOutlaw Western\n\nAn outlaw western is where we follow a criminal or group of criminals as they attempt crimes and evade the law. Often, these movies will portray the outlaws in a somewhat favorable manner.\n\nRevenge Western\n\nThis genre is defined by a singular goal and will incorporate the elements of the western genre while the protagonist seeks revenge.\n\nRevisionist Western\n\nA revisionist western challenges and often aims to disprove the notions propped up by traditional westerns. Early westerns often had their own agenda, and revisionist westerns attempt to dissolve and cast aside a commonly one-sided genre.\n\nSpaghetti Western\n\nThe Spaghetti Western genre was named such because the films were initially made in Italy or produced by Italian filmmakers. Because these films are defined by their ‘heritage’ they can also fall into many of the other western genres as long as they are Italian built. Here are our picks for the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time."
