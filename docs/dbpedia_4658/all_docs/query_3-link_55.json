        "text": "The Quarry, the latest release from horror game studio Supermassive Games, opens with a truck driving along a winding forest road in the dead of night. Between overhead shots of the vehicle’s headlights cutting through its inky surroundings, the camera cuts to speed along the edge of the woods, fast and low to the ground, from the perspective of some presumably supernatural hunter.\n\nThis shot replicates the famous “shaky cam” effect employed in Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead films, mimicking the point of view of the movie’s demon as it scans the woodlands for victims to terrorize and possess. Later in The Quarry, a character’s hand will be severed above the wrist with a chainsaw that has “Groovy” written on one edge. Horrible secrets lie beneath creaky wooden trapdoors. Ted Raimi shows up as a character. Supermassive is pretty clearly a fan of Raimi’s work.\n\nIn a timely coincidence, Evil Dead: The Game—a release that, as its name implies, provides the latest Kandarian dagger stab at a playable version of the movies—was launched less than a month before The Quarry. These two games may proudly wear their love of late-1970s to mid-1990s horror (and Evil Dead specifically) on their bloodstained sleeves, but their paths toward making the genre playable represent different approaches in games’ long-running attempts to translate cinematic scares to another medium.\n\nThe Quarry doesn’t hide that it aims to turn the feeling of watching a late 20th century horror movie into an interactive experience. From its premise—a group of camp counselors desperately trying to survive the seemingly unstoppable threat hunting them in the woods—to its explosions of gore, VHS-inspired user interface, and winking, drive-in movie tone, it’s obvious that the game wants to capture the spirit of a schlock slasher. (It even boasts a “movie mode” that strips most of the player’s input away so they can concentrate on watching everything play out without needing to push too many buttons.)\n\nThis is accomplished mostly by injecting choose-your-own-adventure decision points into a CGI genre movie. Players spend a lot of The Quarry watching the hapless counselors navigate their increasingly bloody predicament. They also occasionally move the characters around rooms where they can pick up and discover clues, or, more frequently, push timed button prompts to avoid injury or tilt a stick left or right to choose between, say, running or hiding from a threat when the option appears. The route toward the game’s conclusion may differ greatly depending on how players make decisions (or how quickly they can respond to flashing onscreen icons), but the scenes that lead to The Quarry’s end have been constructed with intent.\n\nEvil Dead: The Game, on the other hand, ignores the careful choreographies of scripted plotting, opting instead for the structured chaos of a multiplayer experience that casts online players as either one of four “survivor” characters or the demon out to swallow their souls. Though players work toward a predetermined goal of collecting the necessary items to vanquish evil, or, alternately, killing every human before they can reach that objective, Evil Dead takes place within a set of loose design guidelines that allow the experience to spiral off into results far less directed than those found in The Quarry. A series of bungled combat encounters with homicidal Deadites, with the player controlling the demon possessing each survivor in turn as the gauge measuring their fear tops out, may turn into a kind of blood-soaked slapstick. A coordinated group that manages to overcome their opponents in the nick of time, emerging battered and just barely alive onto the victory screen, captures the feeling of watching the few surviving characters in a slasher movie stumble into the morning light to realize they’ve made it through their nightmare intact.\n\nBoth games, in their own way, ask players to suspend their disbelief enough to believe that they’re guiding the outcome of cinema-inspired horror scenes, whether that’s by pressing a single button in The Quarry or by engaging in direct, timing-based combat as one of Evil Dead’s survivors or demons. And both, in their own way, use varying understandings of game design to capture the experience of watching a horror movie.\n\nGames in decades prior tried to accomplish this goal in different ways. Survival horror releases of the kind made famous by Resident Evil and Silent Hill in the ’90s used a deliberately awkward control scheme (the so-called tank controls) and a scarcity of ammunition and healing items to model the fear of being outnumbered and overwhelmed by monsters. This, combined with the drugged sensation of maneuvering a character into position to run from or fight against an enemy, worked to replicate the nightmarish helplessness of a horror movie. Amnesia: The Dark Descent took another approach in modeling powerlessness, forcing the player to explore frightening locales and hide from danger without access to any weapons at all.\n\nIn short, designers have always been interested in finding ways to make the vicarious thrills of watching a horror movie more intimate—to make players feel as if they’re not just watching but actually taking part in the experience.\n\nBoth of the design ethos mentioned above maintain popularity, but they’re joined by The Quarry and the more passive genre it belongs to as well as games like Evil Dead, the latest in the “asymmetrical multiplayer” horror subgenre that also includes Dead by Daylight and the Friday the 13th adaptation. The through line that connects these horror releases is their use of role-playing as the means by which audiences lose themselves in different aspects of the horror movie experience.\n\nSomething interesting happens while playing The Quarry, for instance: The player doesn’t make decisions as if they're the character involved, but acts instead from the perspective of a director—or maybe more accurately, from the viewpoint of a plot-affecting superviewer whose screams at the TV not to go off alone to investigate a strange noise can actually change the course of events. An understanding of genre tropes informs these decisions. When a cast member has been attacked by a bizarre monster and develops a strange infection from a leg wound, another character’s suggestion to amputate the limb moments after spotting black fluid along the edges of the wound seems more reasonable than it ought to. The player knows something bad is inevitable because of the story they're witnessing, but because of their familiarity with horror movie logic, which dictates how a mysterious injury inflicted by a monster causes its sufferer to turn into a monster in turn, they might try to save the injured player by assessing the situation based on genre rationale. The Quarry encourages its audience to role-play a horror movie viewer instead of a horror movie character.\n\nIn Evil Dead: The Game, players inhabit onscreen roles more directly. As the demon they’re forced to think like a supernatural predator, doing everything possible to kill the other players. As the survivors they’re made to prioritize saving their life and their companions. The abstraction of genre is stripped away to favor the fight-or-flight behavior that slasher movies try to capture in the first place. One layer of signifier is removed, leaving something closer to the real emotions that a slasher wants its viewer—or in this case, player—to feel.\n\nThe Evil Dead movies, and horror movies in general, are made up of more than the aesthetics of suspense, fear, and violence. The Quarry and Evil Dead: The Game both understand this in their own way, modeling the vicarious pity and guilty delight that comes from watching events unfold in slasher films. Their approaches to design may take different forms, but they work toward a similar goal: taking movie monsters and those they terrify a few steps out of the screen so that their fates can be placed, to whatever degree, in our hands."
