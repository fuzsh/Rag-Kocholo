        "text": "Dreaming of a world of high-tech gadgets and out-of-this-world action? Yearning for horror that's rooted in science gone awry? Or maybe you're craving the slow-burn exhilaration of alien invasion? Whatever kind of science fiction you're seeking, Prime Video has the perfect pick for a movie night in.\n\nWe've scoured Prime Video's sci-fi section to uncover celebrated classics, art house dazzlers, quirky adventures, and modern marvels. All you need is a subscription to stream for free, and a DIY marathon of science fiction spectacle is at your fingertips.\n\nHere are the 25 best science-fiction movies now available on Prime Video.\n\n1. The Thing\n\n\"Man might be the warmest place to hide,\" according to the infamous tagline to John Carpenter’s 1982 classic sci-fi horror hybrid, but you’ll practically feel the frostbite nipping at your fingertips watching this chiller. An update on the 1951 film The Thing From Another World (itself based on the 1938 novella by John W. Campbell Jr.), The Thing is ground zero for the argument that a remake can top the original. The tale of an alien invasion taking over the bodies of a ragtag crew of researchers stationed in the frozen middle of nowhere Antarctica is truly timeless in terror.\n\nEvery single thing about Carpenter’s take, from the cast stuffed with ace character actors (Richard Masur! Keith David! Richard Dysart! Wilford freaking Brimley!!!) to Ennio Morricone’s score to the legendarily unsettling special-effects by master Rob Bottin (fresh off the werewolf transformations of The Howling) has become iconic. So who cares if four decades ago this remake summarily flopped at the box office? And that’s even before you get to fun little touches like that great big flouncy hat that Kurt Russell somehow makes work or The Fog’s radio-jockey Adrienne Barbeau voice-cameoing as the chess computer. — Jason Adams, Freelance Contributor\n\nHow to watch: The Thing is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n2. Jurassic Park\n\nCredit: Amblin / Universal / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nAs perfect as summer blockbusters come, Steven Spielberg’s dino-epic still plays as magnificently today as it did that summer of 1993. Perhaps even more perfect now, in the wake of how godawful every Jurassic World movie turned out to be. Now we can really appreciate the magic that Spielberg worked with Michael Crichton’s concept of Dino DNA being mined and exploited for a friggin’ theme park, of all things.\n\nThis thriller was ahead of its time in lampooning the ways that bored rich people trying to entertain themselves will be the ultimate destruction of humanity. “Maybe we can have a coupon day,” the lawyer giggles, not long before the T-Rex eats him on the toilet. But Spielberg keeps his satire out of the way of the dino-mite set pieces. So, even after a hundred viewings, I still find myself holding my breath for the entire length of that rampaging Rex sequence in the rain. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Jurassic Park is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n3. Robocop\n\nWhile bumming around in an unofficial capacity on the set of Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner, screenwriter-wannabe Edward Neumeier came up with the idea of a robotic police officer struggling with its own existential crisis in the face of a horrifically violent future world. From there, he set to work on what would eventually become Paul Verhoeven’s 1987 satirical action masterpiece.\n\nStarring Peter Weller as a cop gunned down — obliterated, really — in the line of duty who is then reanimated by a hi-tech defense corporation looking to build the perfect killing machine, it’s actually kind of terrifying how prescient this movie turned out to be. What seemed cartoonish in its over-the-top depiction of the overlap between law enforcement and capitalism is now only too real. Today it seems too much like the people making Fox News watch this movie for ideas, entirely missing its satire. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Robocop is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n4. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nCredit: David Lee / Focus Features / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the great films of the new millennium, Michel Gondry’s mind-wiping melancholy romance explores how some people are destined to be together even if — maybe especially if — they drive each other absolutely batty. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a sad sack trying to fill the void left in his life by the end of his love affair with the whirlwind of Kate Winslet’s Clementine, a bookstore employee who changes her mind more often than she changes her hair color (and she changes her hair color a lot). Or is the void trying to fill him?\n\nThe slippery timeline of Charlie Kaufman’s beyond-brilliant script sees the past infiltrating the present as both of them have their memories of the other wiped by a new scientific procedure that’s only kind of brain damage, the doctors say. But then they can’t help but find themselves inexplicably drawn back into each other’s orbit time and time and time again (“Meet me in Montauk…”) — and it is exhilarating on every watch. It forces us to reconstruct what we’ve witnessed in retrospect, and draws us right into the tangle of emotion with them. The bittersweetness of sad goodbyes overwhelm, even as the future on a frozen beach stutters in place. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n5. The Terminator\n\nCredit: Orion / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nThe 1980s were the era of AHNOLD. Yet Austrian bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger achieved his mightiest flex when he stepped into the titular role of a merciless killer cyborg from a frightful future. In 1984 Los Angeles, waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is on the run from this manly machine. He has been sent from 2029 to prevent the birth of her son, who is destined to lead the rebellion against tyrannical robots. Schwarzenegger awed audiences not only with his hulking form and suitably stiff performance, but also with the sheer star power that would launch a franchise and a decades-long action hero career.\n\nMeanwhile, director James Cameron made a sci-fi classic with laser cannons, careening chase scenes, sprays of bullets, and (once) cutting-edge graphics that put audiences in the POV of the Terminator’s cold, calculating stare.* — Kristy Puchko, Film Editor\n\nHow to watch: The Terminator is free to stream with an MGM+ subscription add-on or available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n6. District 9\n\nCredit: Moviestore / Shutterstock\n\nIn 2009, writer/director Neill Blomkamp broke through with his feature debut by bringing an extraterrestrial premise to Earth in his hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa. Rather than invasion-focused horror, Blomkamp empathized with the resident aliens, who are ghettoized and terrorized by humans/government agents.\n\nIn following the journey of one such agent, he pitches audiences not only into a sci-fi adventure of bombastic action and body transformation, but also a moving parable about the evils of prejudice. District 9 gathered critical praise worldwide and launched the international career of leading man Sharlto Copley. Then, this gritty sci-fi drama scored four Oscar nominations, including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: District 9is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n7. The Lazarus Effect\n\nSometimes there's nothing as satisfyingly spine-tingling as science-gone-wrong horror. Documentarian David Gelb might be best-known for capturing the glory of cuisine creation, thanks to the celebrated feature doc Jiro Dreams of Sushi and the gorgeous series Chef's Table. Here, he branched out, bringing his skill for grounded drama to the tale of medical researchers experimenting with resurrecting the dead. When they succeed, their wildest dreams become their worst nightmare as one of their crew becomes telekinetic…and terrifying.\n\nThis sci-fi stunner not only boasts sensational scares, but also a cast that includes Olivia Wilde, Mark Duplass, Evan Peters, and Donald Glover. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: The Lazarus Effect is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n8. The Vast of Night\n\nCredit: GED Cinema / Amazon / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nIt feels reductive to even call Andrew Patterson's indie masterpiece science fiction, but given that its 89-minute runtime at least alludes to aliens, it might be all we've got. Everett (Jake Horowitz), a radio jockey, and Fay (Sierra McCormick), a switchboard operator, have their night cut short by a strange audio phenomenon that interferes with the broadcast and confuses listeners. Their night derails as they follow clues about the sound's origin and reports of something odd in the sky.\n\nThe Vast of Night hypnotizes the viewer not with special effects or otherworldly elements, but with grounded, meditative, even slow direction and performance. Many scenes are long, uncut takes of one or more characters talking, and by the end it barely matters what they saw in the sky or choose to believe in. Fay and Everett's night is already one they'll never forget, and a film that stays with you long after you watch it.* — Proma Khosla, Senior Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: The Vast of Night is now streaming with ads on Amazon Freevee.\n\n9. Rabid\n\nThe brand of body horror that David Cronenberg has become synonymous with is really just the greatest fusion of science fiction and horror that cinema has to offer. Think the body of Jeff Goldblum at the end of The Fly, meshed together with the machine itself. These two forces are inextricable in Cronenberg’s hands. Mind and flesh, sex and metal: the human future. These obsessions were on display right from the start, and his 1977 picture, Rabid, is one of his most underrated and entertaining riffs upon them.\n\nAfter a motorcycle accident, a young woman (the porn star Marilyn Chambers) is taken in by an experimental clinic, where they graft genetically altered skin onto her wounds. When she wakes up she finds herself with sudden odd cravings — of the vampiric sort. Passing along this thirst via a little stinger buried in a fresh slit in her armpit, Cronenberg unleashes a sexually transmitted zombie plague that only his singularly strange brain could’ve mustered. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Rabid is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n10. Alien\n\nAll of the Alien films are on Prime, and you could spend a far worse day than one where you marathon the entire shebang. (Although I do recommend steering clear of the two vs. Predator entries). But if you’ve just got the time for one, I say go with Ridley Scott’s original 1979 classic, a haunted-house-in-space tale that’s got the greatest Final Girl of all time in Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, duh) facing down the scariest monster design ever put on screen, thanks to visionary German artist H.R Giger.\n\nThat cast of exquisite character actors gets gruesomely picked off one by one! Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, and let’s not forget Jones the Cat — not a single dud in the O.G. Nostramo bunch. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Alien is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n11. Prometheus\n\nCredit: Scott Free Prod / 20th Century Fox / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nIn 1979, Ridley Scott gave us Alien, the movie that dared to taunt, \"In space, no one can hear you scream.\" In subsequent sequels, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet took to the helm. But in 2012, Scott returned with a daring and divisive prequel.\n\nSet 30 years before Alien, a band of scientists are trekking across space in search of the origin of mankind. On a distant moon, they find some horrifying extraterrestrials that are new to them, but not to fans of this frightening sci-fi franchise. Though met with mixed reviews, Prometheus undeniably boasts jaw-dropping visuals, pulse-pounding action, and a star-studded cast that includes Noomi Rapace, Logan Marshall-Green, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, and Charlize Theron. — K.P.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nHow to watch: Prometheus is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n12. Signs\n\nWith The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan forged a reputation as a writer/director who knew how to make genre films freshly fun and joltingly shocking. So, when Signs hit in 2002, audiences turned out in giddy anticipation to be scared out of their wits. We were not disappointed. Sure, in retrospect we might eye-roll over the climactic revelation in this invasion-centered horror-thriller. But its creepy creatures still give chills as they torment a widowed former priest (Mel Gibson) and his family (Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) on a remote farm. Embedding us with a family living in fear, Shyamalan brings terror home, answering our twisted prayers. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Signs is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n13. About Time\n\nCredit: Translux / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nIt's bizarre living in a timeline not only where the book The Time Traveler’s Wife was adapted poorly twice, but also where Richard Curtis’ 2013 perfect time-travel romance exists!\n\nDomhnall Gleeson stars as a young man who on his 21st birthday discovers the ability to time-travel into his past. It's a skill he mostly uses to fix mistakes he’s made (kind of like an expanded calendar version of Groundhog Day). We watch him manipulate time to — what else — win the girl. And since the girl, in this case, is played by Rachel McAdams, sure, we get it. But what sneaks up on you about About Time is how it’s really a stealth father-son picture. Amid its sci-fi premise, the heartbreaking relationship between Gleeson and Bill Nighy as his dad is the real tear-jerker on hand. A 10-hankie revelation, be warned! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: About Time is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n14. The Blob\n\nMaybe not a remake on par with John Carpenter's re-envisioning of The Thing, but I’ve always had a soft spot for the deeply gnarly theatrics of Chuck Russell’s 1988 reboot of the pink-goo-monster from Hell.\n\nIt’s the same ol’ tale of yore: A meteorite crashes in Nowheresville, gets promptly poked at with a stick, and starts swallowing up a small town as it expands to terrifying world-dominating gelatinous proportions. But the grotesque practical effects from Tony Gardner are the stuff 1980s nightmares are made out of. Decades on, I still can’t un-see the image of Donovan Leitch being dissolved under a swirling wall of raspberry jelly. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Blob is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n15. Being John Malkovich\n\nCredit: Melissa Moseley / Universal / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\nThe actual “science” of Spike Jonze’s 1999 masterpiece, Being John Malkovich, might remain, you know, a little sketchy. Just a tad. On the 7 1/2 floor of an office building, behind some filing cabinets, there’s a little door that opens into a portal to real-life thespian John Malkovich’s consciousness. This incredible passage allows a pathetic puppeteer (John Cusack), his harried wife (Cameron Diaz), and the co-worker he’s hot for (Catherine Keener) all to walk a mile in Malkovich’s shoes. OK, sure, why not?\n\nBut beyond the meta-hilarity and visual magic that Jonze milks from all the nonsense, it’s screenwriter Charlie Kaufman’s script that asks all of the right questions about the nature of self, the existence of a soul. Things like: Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Malkovich Malkovich. Malkovich? — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Being John Malkovich is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n16. Transit\n\nGerman director Christian Petzold’s 2018 film updates the 1944 novel by Anna Seghers of the same name, which is about refugees trying to escape Nazi-occupied France to an alternate present where Europe exists under the thumb of a vague fascist rule.\n\nFranz Rogowski plays a German man on the run from the authorities. To escape to Mexico, he'll try to use the papers of a dead man whose body he's discovered. While waiting for his literal ship to come in, Rogowski becomes romantically entangled with the dead man’s wife. Making matters more complicated, he develops a friendship with the dead man’s son. All as the walls close in and paths of escape get severed one by one. A slow-burn of speculative timeline political allegory a la The Man in the High Castle, Transit feels like a thriller that Kafka never wrote, where we’re smothered by paperwork and done in by signing on the dotted line. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Transit is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n17. The Endless\n\nCo-directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead made a name for themselves over the past decade by mixing loopy hard-sci-fi concepts with low-budget character-based stories like Synchronic and Something in the Dirt. 2017’s The Endless is probably their most beloved project to date. (Well before they started dabbling in the MCU with Loki, anyway.)\n\nStarring, as several of their projects do, the directors themselves, The Endless sees Benson and Moorhead playing brothers who get drawn back into the weird UFO cult they escaped from 10 years earlier. Blame it on the mysterious videotape that appears on their doorstep. Before you know it, there are several moons in the sky, deadly dangerous time-loops are springing up around the campgrounds like rattlesnakes, and Benson and Moorhead have crafted the kind of movie that stoners will be dissecting for decades to come. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Endless is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n18. The City of Lost Children\n\nCredit: Moviestore / Shutterstock\n\nBefore he brought us the magic and romance of Amelie (or Alien Resurrection), French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet teamed with Marc Caro and Gilles Adrien to write and direct this tender tale of fantasy and science fiction, which was nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Palme d'Or in 2015.\n\nIn a murky world of minefields and mad science, children are being abducted by a band of cyborgs to appease a brilliant but vile creature who feeds on their dreams. However, the kidnappers bite off more than they can chew when they snatch the little brother of a circus strong man (Ron Perlman). Full of imagery odd and awe-inspiring, The City of Lost Children is an imaginative adventure that's sure to snatch at your dreams. If you love the work of Terry Gilliam, then you'll want to know he absolutely adores this movie. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: The City of Lost Children is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n19. Vivarium\n\nVivarium isn’t the sci-fi journey to pick if you’re seeking tidy explanations or slickly satisfying reveals. But if you’re open to a more ethereal sci-fi experience — one that will make you ask a lot of questions about the world you’ve been introduced to and then fail to answer most of them — this uniquely baffling outing from director Lorcan Finnegan is worth a go.\n\nJesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star as a couple looking to buy a house. Yonder, a suburban development touted as having \"All you’d need and all you’d want\" catches their eye, and they schedule a visit at one of its many identical properties. But after a strange house tour, the pair find they can’t exit the neighborhood, with the labyrinthine rows of matching units trapping them in some kind of loop.\n\nThings only get stranger from there, so cue this one up when you’re feeling a bit weird. It’s visually beautiful and narratively bonkers.* — Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: Vivarium is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n\n20. A.I.: Artificial Intelligence\n\nLegendary director Stanley Kubrick famously worked on adapting Brian Aldiss' 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" for decades before deciding that Steven Spielberg would be a better fit to direct the sentimental Pinocchio-esque tale of a robot boy who just wants to get home to his adopted parents who abandoned him. The two directing titans went back and forth for years on the project, with Kubrick insistent that they wait for computer technology to get good enough, but his death in 1999 decided the matter for good. And so in 2001 Spielberg made the film as a tribute to his longtime friend.\n\nThe final product bridges the gap between the two, the strangest amalgamation of their contrasting visions — Spielberg's sentiment bucking up against Kubrick's lack thereof. The movie's all the better and more fascinating for that friction. As the robot boy David's (Haley Joel Osment) hopeless quest carries him across entire centuries, the struggle between heart and mind becomes textual, with the film's behind-the-scenes dramas adding their own richness and epic sense of mystery to the tale. All that, plus Jude Law as a sex robot! Movie magic, baby. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: A.I.: Artificial Intelligence is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n21. From Beyond\n\nMy favorite of director Stuart Gordon's numerous H.P. Lovecraft adaptations (including the Re-Animator movies), this 1986 body-horror shocker stars Gordon regulars and horror icons Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton respectively as a mad doctor named Crawford Tillinghast and one Dr. McMichaels, the prison psychiatrist who treats him once he's gone, you know, mad.\n\nTurns out Tillinghast and his former partner Dr. Pretorius (Ted Sorel) — Bride of Frankenstein reference, holla – invented a machine they called \"The Resonator\" that allows its users to peer into other dimensions. Unfortunately for Pretorius, he peered a little too closely and got his head ripped off in the process, which is why Tillinghast has found himself in prison spilling his story to Dr. McMichaels.\n\nBut the Resonator is too addictive to give up on, so the entire gang — joined by Detective Bubba Brownlee (Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree) — head back to the lab and turn the Resonator back on. And before you can say \"forehead tentacle,\" everybody's oozing pink goo and perving on everybody else. It's the finest sort of demented joyride that Gordon always excelled at, twisting Lovecraft's ripe old prose into some truly bonkers '80s day-glo weirdness. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: From Beyond is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n22. Cube\n\nPicture it: You wake up and find yourself wearing a scratchy-looking jumpsuit inside of a perfectly square room with six small square hatches, one on each wall (including the floor and the ceiling), staring back at you. The walls are steel but lit from within, a monochromatic neon glow of green or red or blue. And you have no memory of how you got there. You pick a hatch, open it up and go through it… And it's another room, exactly like the previous one, just a different color. And on and on.\n\nThat's the simple concept behind Vincenzo Natali's 1997 cult classic Cube, where several strangers find themselves in just such a situation. Stumbling upon each other one by one, they must unravel the mystery of where they are and how to get out of it. And, oh right, some of the rooms are lethally booby-trapped with razor wire or poison gas, so they need to avoid those as well. A brain puzzle turned into genre spectacle, Cube is ruthlessly efficient and a heck of a lot of nasty fun – so much so it spawned a few sequels, and they're also streaming on Prime. Make it a marathon! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Cube is now streaming with ads on Amazon Freevee.\n\n23. The Mist\n\nCredit: Dimension Films / Kobal / Shutterstock\n\n\"There's something in the mist!\" That cry comes early on in Frank Darabont's now-classic adaptation of Stephen King's 1980 short story, and man alive, does that line turn out to be true. As it turns out, there are loads of things in the mist rolling across the lake one afternoon and into the atmosphere of a small town in Maine. Unfortunately, it's coming from the general direction of a secretive government laboratory. Also unfortunately for the town's residents who find themselves barricaded in the local grocery store, none of those things are too friendly either.\n\nAs imaginative and terrifying an assortment of Lovecraftian monsters as there are on the other side of the glass windows, the true focus here is on the people trapped inside, and on the ways that white-hot panic will turn people into the ugliest versions of themselves real fast. Strapped in with local artist David (Thomas Jane) as he tries to protect his son from gigantic poisonous mosquitoes on one side and the bloodsucking end-of-times harridan Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) on the other, The Mist delivers a bleak yet thrilling rumination on human nature. And oh, that ending… — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Mist is now streaming with ads on Amazon Freevee.\n\n24. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)\n\nIf you don't count the countless stories and films loosely inspired by Don Siegel's 1956 sci-fi classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers (which was itself adapted from Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers), there are three explicit remakes, including Abel Ferrara's 1993 film Body Snatchers and Oliver Hirschbiegel's The Invasion from 2007. The best of the bunch by leaps and pod-people bounds is Philip Kaufman's 1978 masterpiece, which plunks its snatchin' down in the hippy-dippy streets of San Francisco at the height (Haight?) of Boomer self-indulgence.\n\nStarring Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright, and Leonard friggin' Nimoy, Kaufman's take also has by far the most balls-to-the-wall cast too. The original film's gigantic alien pods are here, but hilariously they're now able to sprout flowers — all the better for the hippies to place them in their hair right before they take root in their brains, parasitically taking them over. An endlessly malleable metaphor for groupthink, this spin is ruthless in its evisceration of the 1970s psychiatric me-first culture. Show it to your favorite \"wellness\"-obsessed bestie and see how they cringe! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n25. Open Your Eyes\n\nIn 1997, four years before he made the instantly classic ghost story The Others, Spanish director Alejandro Amenábar gifted us with the shifting realities of Open Your Eyes, still his best film to date. It stars the handsome and suave Eduardo Noriega as César, a handsome and suave young fella who finds himself on the opposite side of the good-looks spectrum after he gets horribly disfigured in a car crash. Torn between an ex-girlfriend who wants him dead and a prospective new love interest named Sofia (Penelope Cruz) who's all sweetness and light, César starts hallucinating different realities where the women swap places, and his own face begins to change.\n\nAnd if this plot sounds familiar, then perhaps you saw the 2001 remake Vanilla Sky from director Cameron Crowe, starring Tom Cruise, with Cruz reprising her role as Sofia. The remake bungled it all in the ways only Hollywood can, so do yourself a favor and watch Amenábar's original, which has more heart and deep wells of surreal strangeness up one of its sleeves than Crowe managed with a budget twenty times its size. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Open Your Eyes is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\n*This blurb has appeared in a past Mashable list.\n\nUPDATE: May. 17, 2024, 6:32 p.m. EDT This list has been updated to reflect the current streaming options."
