        "text": "I have always been a fan of that most improbable of all subgenres, the horror comedy. It has been around for a very long time, dating back to the silent era with The Cat and the Canary and the early talkies with James Whale’s genre twisting films like The Old Dark House and Bride of Frankenstein. In the late 40’s, comedy team Abbott and Costello met most of the classic monsters before Roger Corman twisted the nose of the subgenre with A Bucket of Blood and The Little Shop of Horrors in the late 50’s and early 60’s. The classic monsters would get brand new comedic treatments in the 1970’s from Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein and in the form of George Hamilton as Dracula in Love at First Bite. In the 80’s Re-Animator, The Return of the Living Dead, and Night of the Creeps among others all successfully parodied horror conventions while also delivering legitimate gore and scares.\n\nAs a kid I practically wore out our Ghostbusters videotape and Gremlins was a regular staple in our house. As I got older, The Howling and Friday the 13th Part VI were most often in the rotation. But for me, there was one movie that exemplified the apex of the horror-comedy, Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn. For me it was like the arrival of the Chosen One, splitting the genre into two distinct eras with one fell swoop of an arm-mounted chainsaw. Now there is Before Evil Dead II and After Evil Dead II. It is the flashpoint where the conventions of horror-comedy were redefined and crystallized. It is a crude comparison to be sure, but Evil Dead II is the Citizen Kane of splatstick. As the Welles classic brought the techniques of a certain kind of filmmaking together in one monumental film, Sam Raimi’s sequel did the same for another kind of filmmaking and horror-comedy has never been quite the same since.\n\nIt is arguable whether the film invented splatstick, but it certainly perfected it.\n\nEvil Dead II is such a unique and singular vision that, though the style is often imitated, it has never been equaled. It is energetic to the point of frantic, comical to the brink of farce, gory to the verge of parody, and all the while, genuinely frightening to such a degree that at first audiences didn’t know whether to laugh or scream. That same kind of confusion met other classic horror comedies like An American Werewolf in London and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. The latter film is in several ways the perfect analog for Evil Dead II. In both cases the second installment serves as parody, partial remake by restating several memorable scenes, and partial sequel to the original film. In both films, the tone the second time around is wildly different from the original while clearly remaining the work of the same filmmaker. The originals in both series are scrappy, handmade, guerilla filmmaking ventures by gifted amateurs, while the second installments are made with more budget and experience by more battle-weary professional filmmakers.\n\nDespite its reputation, The Evil Dead is not completely devoid of humor, though I’m not sure all of it is intentional, and it is clearly the work of the same filmmaker of the later film. Evil Dead II, however, leans into the humor inherent to the story rather than trying to avoid it. Raimi then heightens it by infusing the film with his love for the Three Stooges and Looney Tunes cartoons and making full use of Bruce Campbell’s considerable talents as a physical actor with impeccable comic chops. Comparisons to the first film also illustrate how poised upon a razor’s edge horror and comedy are. Slight adjustments in one direction or the other make massive differences in tone and mood. A blending of the two is an even more precarious balance, verging on impossible to attain. Several deadly serious scenes from the original are restaged in the second for laughs and they serve their purpose effectively in both cases. It all comes down to nuances in performance, camera, and editing and leaning ever so slightly toward horror or humor.\n\nAccording to star and producer Bruce Campbell and several others, The Evil Dead and its follow-up Crimewave were absolutely miserable shoots in which no one really knew what they were doing. They were young and reckless enough not to mind too much at the time. It’s something if a miracle that the original Evil Dead has any coherence at all considering the conditions and their lack of basic production knowledge. It is a testament to Sam Raimi as a visionary filmmaker that it works as well as it does.\n\nConversely, Campbell said for the 25th anniversary documentary on the making of Evil Dead II that the film was a comparatively pleasant experience. Much of the rest of the cast and crew beg to differ, especially Sam Raimi’s younger brother Ted Raimi who sweat pounds a day off his body while encased in the undead Henrietta makeup and body suit (in one shot that appears in the film, Ted’s sweat can be seen pouring out of Henrietta’s ear). Cast members Sarah Berry (Annie), Dan Hicks (Jake), Kassie DePaiva (Bobby Joe), and Richard Domeier (Ed) all looked back on the film with humor and fondness, but also seem to be glad to be looking at the experience from a distance. There also appears to be a special bond created among cast and crew that only forms in the crucible or the thick of battle. Campbell’s more sunny view is largely based on comparisons to the misery of the Evil Dead shoot and the great challenge to come with Army of Darkness. Clearly, ultra-low budget filmmaking is hardly glamorous and when it’s a film as ambitious as Evil Dead II, it is particularly taxing on everybody. By all accounts, Sam Raimi is a demanding filmmaker, but one who gains a great deal of trust and loyalty from those he works with and whose vision ends up on the screen.\n\nA big part of that vision is the many visual, stop motion, and makeup effects that give the film so much of its manic flavor. The makeup effect alone, created by a small band of madmen led by the great Mark Shostrom, are miracles in themselves. For such a low budget feature, the film is filled with remarkable creations. The Evil Ash makeup, Possessed Ed, and the undead Henrietta costumes would be enough to make the film’s makeup effects monumental, but Evil Dead II goes far beyond with dozens more iconic elements to point to. Greg Nicotero called the film “the proving ground for KNB,” the now legendary makeup effects house responsible for some of the greatest effects work in modern film history. The stop-motion effects created by Tom Sullivan, Doug Beswick, and Rick Catizone and miniatures by Jim Beloheovek are equally impressive and should not be overlooked. In our current CGI-laden world, effects like these can seem dated, but here they still work beautifully to underscore the film’s tone and heightened, nightmare reality.\n\nAs great as these effects are, perhaps the film’s greatest special effect is Bruce Campbell as Ash. Somewhere between Schwarzenegger and Shemp, we find Ash Williams. He has the dry wit, tough exterior, and one-liners of the action greats of the 80’s mixed liberally with the slapstick sensibilities of the Three Stooges. The entire film is endlessly engaging but the most memorable scenes are the “one man show” sequences in which Campbell is essentially alone on screen. Fighting his decapitated chainsaw wielding girlfriend, going to war with his own severed hand, laughing maniacally as the cabin comes alive around him all while being sprayed with fire hoses of blood. Perhaps most inspired of all and with a comic athleticism reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Donald O’Connor, grabbing himself by the back of the head and flipping himself over after having hit himself repeatedly over the head with dinner plates.\n\nFor all its over-the-top, twisted slapstick, Evil Dead II still delivers the goods when it comes to effective scares. There are genuine stakes involved, ratcheted suspense, and some of the best jump scares of the 80’s. This is the genius of Sam Raimi, whose vision, along with the script co-written with Scott Spiegel, creates a balancing act so precarious that the slightest miscalibration would completely destroy the effect. Every moment of the film manages to sit on that edge while somehow never going headlong over the cliff, making it the ultimate example of horror-comedy at its finest.\n\nThe Evil Dead series is, in terms of quality, one of the most consistent in all of horror. Even more rare, a case could be made for any entry to be the best of the franchise. For me Evil Dead II is that highest point, but I certainly would not begrudge anyone preferring the original, Army of Darkness, or the remake over it. Strong cases can also be made for the Ash vs. Evil Dead television series and even the stage musical version. When it comes down to it, Evil Dead II is one of the great examples of what creative people can do when given the space to do what they do best. They innovate, solve problems in unique ways, and break all the rules, giving us something we’ve never seen before. Sometimes these films are successful right away, others build over time as was the case with the Evil Dead films. These cult classics endure while so many other films fade.\n\nEvil Dead II has only grown in esteem to become a crowning achievement of inspired insanity. After thirty-five years it remains, in a word, groovy.\n\n‘Alien: Romulus’ is right around the corner, so it’s the perfect time to check out ‘Lily C.A.T.,’ an anime body horror classic that’s a gory tribute to ‘Alien’ and ‘The Thing’.\n\n“Confine them? We’re on a ship. We’re practically confined ourselves.”\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien is an iconic horror/science fiction hybrid that’s had its ups and downs as a film franchise, but remains an essential genre film 45 years later. Alien is such a tried and true property with limitless potential that it’s kind of remarkable that there hasn’t been an Alien animated series or in-universe anime that’s in the vein of The Animatrix that translates this iconic sci-fi horror property into animated madness where it can really let loose and not be confined by live-action’s limitations. An unreleased Alien vs. Predator anime is the closest thing that audiences have gotten to this, which is actually fully mixed and completed as of 2016.\n\nDisney is currently just sitting on the finished product as of its acquisition of 20th Century Fox and it’s unclear if they’re ever going to do anything with it at this point. There are so many horror films that try to make waves by being “Alien, but on a ….,” or “It’s like The Thing, only it’s set in a …” These copycat horror films understandably have mixed results. For every Life, Event Horizon, Contamination, and Galaxy of Terror, there’s an Inseminoid, Xtro II: The Second Encounter, and Critters 4. Somehow, one of the smartest Alien rip-offs is an ‘80s anime that mashes the Ridley Scott film together with another revered science fiction creature feature classic.\n\nLily C.A.T. an anime OVA – original video animation that’s akin to a direct-to-video movie – from 1987 that’s basically Alien meets The Thing. A bunch of astronauts awake from cryo-sleep and learn that a shapeshifting monster is taking them out, one-by-one, with little means of recourse. Over time, the crew learns that The Syncam Corporation, the company who is behind their mission, has betrayed them and set them up for failure, just like Ripley and her team in Alien. Lily C.A.T. is a rewarding sci-fi/horror anime that’s heavily inspired by Alien, but proves to be so much more. Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus is set to revolutionize the flailing film franchise, along with Noah Hawley’s upcoming Alien: Earth FX series.\n\nThat being said, Lily C.A.T. is the Alien reimagining that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nLily C.A.T. is a unique property who was directed by Hisayuki Toriumi, who previously did extensive directing on Gatchaman, 1979’s Ultraman, and Battle of the Planets. Lily C.A.T.’s writer, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama, also cut his teeth writing for many mecha and giant robot series, such as Blue Comet SPT Layzner, Transformers: Super-God Masterforce, Patlabor, Future GPX Cyber Formula, and Turn A Gundam, not to mention all ten episodes of the Dirty Pair OVA. Toriumi and Hoshiyama’s mecha experience feels evident in Lily C.A.T., even if there are no giant robots present in the OVA. Their past experience is expressed through Lily C.A.T.’s grungy cyberpunk aesthetic and 23rd century setting. There are several shots and examples of technology on the central ship, Saldes, that feel like direct homages to Carpenter and Scott’s early film oeuvre. Additionally, the OVA’s monster designs come from Yoshitaka Amano, who may be no H.R. Giger, Stan Winston, or Rob Bottin, but he’s someone who’s established an impressive reputation and is best known for his artwork in Vampire Hunter D and the Final Fantasy games.\n\nLily C.A.T. has become more obscure in recent years, but it did have an English dub that was produced by Carl Macek and distributed by Streamline Pictures, who were a major player in the dubbing industry during the late ’80s and ’90s, handling Robotech, Macross, and some of the decade’s biggest dub releases like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Akira, and Fist of the North Star. Lily C.A.T. was a notorious VHS release during the ’90s and became a bigger cult classic through its prominent airing on the Sci-Fi Channel Saturday Anime block. It was finally released on DVD in 2014, where an official Japanese with English subtitles version was available for the first time. Unfortunately, the DVD is now out of print and it’s since become a rare, expensive collector’s item (the VHS alone sells for anywhere between $40 and $90 on eBay), which is a testament to the ’80s OVA’s reputation and staying power.\n\nLily C.A.T. quickly stands out through its inspired editing that keeps its central mystery alive, the tension taught, and the audience on the edge of their seats. There’s such a tight story that immediately gets moving and essentially has zero filler because of the OVA’s relatively short runtime. This tight, well-paced narrative is complemented by graphic kills and ridiculous transformation sequences. The first transformation scene is a gory, bloody spectacle that genuinely catches the audience by surprise. Biological viscera mingles with extraterrestrial acids so that the whole display feels truly otherworldly in nature. A cat’s ribs separate and explode as it’s turned into some surreal, monstrous hand puppet that’s immediately evocative of the dog’s transformation sequence in The Thing. Lily C.A.T. only gets more outrageous as it moves forward. Organs splatter and paint the ship’s interior like biological fireworks. The subsequent transformation sequences are even more disturbing and gruesome. There’s a truly gonzo moment when one of the crew members flamethrowers a cat until it’s willed into submission, only for the feline’s face to peel off and reveal its robotic insides. It’s such a gloriously anime visual that in many ways is even more extreme and over the top than anything that’s in the original Alien.\n\nThe threat of a biological virus that spreads through the Saldes ship intensifies its terror through evocative shots of tight, sterile corridors that are dense in steam, shadow, and danger. Lily C.A.T. is careful to not overextend itself and it understands the value in how less can be more. This makes it all the more unfortunate that this effective title has slipped through the cracks and remains relatively obscure and unknown, despite it absolutely nailing what it’s going for. It’s one of the most genuinely unnerving anime movies and OVAs to come out of the ‘80s, which was a decade that was absolutely rampant with ultra-violent body horror content, like Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku.\n\nLily C.A.T. is so much better for saying what it has to in a concise 67 minutes, instead of being drawn out into a longer movie with an unnecessary extra act. It’s easy to picture a modern adaptation of Lily C.A.T. that’s told as a limited series. A longer, serialized venture of this nature could potentially work, especially if it were to put an even greater focus on its characters, but a Lily C.A.T. series runs the risk of ruining the OVA’s magic and wrecking the tension that’s effectively created in this tight production. It’s for the best that Lily C.A.T. is what it is – and that it’s not even adapted from manga source material – rather than being one piece of a greater whole.\n\nIn fact, director Toriumi, had been vocal about his desire to create an anime version of the popular “bakeneko” subgenre of horror films that focus on yokai/demon cats – who often have shapeshifting abilities – and the terrors that surround them. A cat, Jonesy, is of course central to Alien and another way in which Alien and Lily C.A.T. are alike (and The Thing builds a major centerpiece out of its shapeshifting dog). It’s curious to note that Lily C.A.T.’s whole concept came out of a desire to riff on the bakeneko subgenre, rather than an attempt to reverse-engineer Alien elements.\n\nProductions like Lily C.A.T., Alien, and The Thing often live or die based on their cast of characters and how successfully they connect with viewers. Lily C.A.T. introduces a varied group of archetypal figures on the Saldes who almost feel like they’re ripped out of Street Fighter. They’re appropriate types of cannon fodder for a story of this nature. One of Lily C.A.T.’s greatest joys is how this cast quickly grows on the viewer and how easy it is to actively root for them by the film’s final act. Lily C.A.T. makes you genuinely care for these characters, even if they may initially come across as one-dimensional, and this helps the film really stick the landing with its ending. It’s all-too easy for Alien and Thing copycats to have disposable characters who are of little consequence when they finally bite the dust. Every death in Lily C.A.T. hits hard and the film’s ending is reminiscent of Ripley and Newt’s triumphant escape during Aliens’ finale.\n\nIn addition to the shapeshifting terror that threatens Saldes’ crew, Lily C.A.T. also explores the idea that two people on the ship may be imposters, specifically “time escapees.” These are individuals who commit crimes, sneak on a ship, use its cryosleep to get away for 40-60 years, only to return to Earth where they’re now able to operate freely because no one remembers what they did half-a-century ago. It’s actually a really creative concept and the type of idea that you’d find in the best works of Philip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov. This beautifully illustrates how criminals can take advantage of technological advancements for their own selfish gains.\n\nLily C.A.T. could simply coast on ghoulish visuals and grisly murders alone, but there’s some deeper material in play as Saldes’ crew ruminate on the inherent loneliness of their work. Their mission rips them from their lives and turns them into missing pieces of a puzzle that they no longer fit into anymore. It’s appreciated that Lily C.A.T. explores these heavier questions and the mental toll that all this puts on its characters, even before they’re exposed to this shapeshifting, murderous bacteria. Lily C.A.T. isn’t nearly as deep as Alien and is limited by its length, but it does attempt to get in its cast’s head in a slightly more invasive manner than Ridley Scott’s film.\n\nLily C.A.T. concludes with an epic finale that’s on par with Alien, yet it’s even more daring and graceful in some respects. The characters are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the greater good so that the Saldes doesn’t return to Earth with this deadly bacteria in tow and liable to contaminate the entire planet. There are some brutal moments where the crew contemplate their ends and taking the easy way out instead of confronting the horrors of this monster. Ultimately, they rise to the occasion and consider a more noble end. During the film’s final moments of success, a melancholy Jiro prompts a question to Nancy: “Do you think the beautiful butterfly finds it repulsive that it was once a caterpillar?” It’s a poetic query that encapsulates the philosophical tug of war that’s in play in Lily C.A.T. and it casts the heroes’ victory in a darker, uncomfortable light. It’s a powerful, thought-provoking conclusion that beats out many modern science fiction and horror stories – anime or otherwise.\n\nMore than 35 years later, Lily C.A.T. is still an extremely satisfying companion piece to Alien: Romulus that should be added to everyone’s Alien binge list before they check out the new film.\n\n‘Lily C.A.T.’ is currently available to stream for free on The Roku Channel."
