        "text": "HBO's Game of Thrones is lauded for the lush, world-building, visually stunning way production designers (and, you know, wig experts) brought George R.R. Martin's rich, complicated world to life. The story is, after all, a study in mind-blowing landscapes: frigid wastelands and forests beyond the Wall, the amply treed Kingsroad, turquoise waters across the Narrow Sea, and the sunny medieval King's Landing, to name a few.\n\nWhile many of GoT's recurring sets (like the Iron Throne) were filmed at Paint Hall studios in Belfast, the show was largely filmed on-location, primarily in Northern Ireland and Iceland for scenes in the North, and Croatia and Spain for the South. Cast members who had scenes beyond the Wall were known to film in freezing temperatures, often on lands buried in feet of snow.\n\nWith such an impressive roster of medieval cities and stunning islands on the shoot list, it should come as no surprise that GoT filming locations around Europe have attracted many, many tourists.\n\nAllow this handy travel guide to inspire a Game of Thrones trip of your own. (Disclaimer: spoilers ahead.)\n\nBallintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland\n\nScenes on the Iron Islands, home to House Greyjoy of Pyke, were filmed at Northern Ireland's Ballintoy Harbour, known as a raised beach because the water meets a chalky cliff face instead of flat sand. Visitors will recognize the rugged surroundings as Lordsport, the port town to which Theon returns after leaving Winterfell. Though it's a place Theon likely never wants to see again, you may want to visit for the panoramic coastal views and laid-back atmosphere of Ballintoy village. It's a great side trip for those who happen to be in the area for Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland's famed basalt columns less than 10 miles away.\n\nFort Manoel, Malta\n\nOne of the saddest scenes in all of Game of Thrones is when Ned Stark meets his end on King Joffrey's orders in a square in the fictional King's Landing. The real setting for this scene was Fort Manoel, a grand star-shaped limestone fort on the shore in Malta. Built in the 18th century, the fort remains on UNESCO's tentative World Heritage list. (GoT fans would probably argue that it should make the list based on its appearance on the show alone.)\n\nKirkjufell, Iceland\n\nScenes beyond the Wall were filmed at various locations around Iceland. One memorable scene that featured Daenerys and her dragons saving (almost) everyone from the Night King — in season seven, episode six — was filmed at Kirkjufell, one of the country's most famous peaks. The waterfall-adorned hill is lush and green in warm weather and blanketed by snow in the winter (hence how it became a filming location for north of the Wall). It's a two-hour drive from Reykjavik and easy to reach by car. It's so easy to reach, in fact, that it's believed to be the most photographed mountain in Iceland.\n\nOther noteworthy Icelandic filming locations for beyond the Wall include Myrdalsjokull glacier, the Hverfjall volcano, and the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland. Glaciers are much harder for tourists to reach, though.\n\nDoune Castle, Scotland\n\nThe pilot episode featuring the Stark family home of Winterfell was shot at Doune Castle in central Scotland. It's also been featured on Outlander and \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" Doune Castle is about an hour and 15 minutes from Edinburgh and 45 minutes from Glasgow. The medieval structure was built during the 14th century and is known for its exceedingly high gatehouse (about 100 feet tall). Note that the castle appeared only in the pilot episode; later episodes featuring Winterfell were filmed at Castle Ward in Northern Ireland.\n\nDubrovnik, Croatia\n\nThough most of King's Landing was shot in a studio, some exterior shots were taken in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The Trsteno Arboretum, for example, was used for the palace gardens. The Jesuit Staircase became the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, and St. Dominic Street is where most market scenes were filmed.\n\nMinčeta Tower, a 14th-century fortress where Dubrovnik visitors go for views of the city and sea, served as the House of the Undying, where Daenerys is led after her dragons are stolen during her stay in Qarth.\n\nDiocletian's Palace, Croatia\n\nAbout three hours up the coast from Dubrovnik is Diocletian's Palace in Split, Croatia's second-largest city. This was the setting for the former slave city of Meereen and where Daenerys locked up and trained her dragons. The palace was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian during the fourth century and is now UNESCO listed.\n\nTollymore Forest Park, Northern Ireland\n\nRemember when the Stark boys found a litter of dire wolf puppies in the forests of Winterfell? And in the opening scene, in which rangers of the Night’s Watch find bodies in the snow? Both were filmed in the truly folkloric Tollymore Forest Park in Northern Ireland. The 1,500-acre patch of woods at the foot of the Mourne mountains was the first named state forest in Northern Ireland. Now, it sees many a GoT fan thanks to a local travel company specializing in Game of Thrones tours. At the park, you can forest bathe, pretend you're a ranger of the Night's Watch yourself, go camping, hike, and ride horses. It's located in the southwest, near the town of Newcastle.\n\nGlens of Antrim, Northern Ireland\n\nThe Dothraki Sea — otherwise known as the Great Grass Sea — is actually in the Glens of Antrim in Northern Ireland. In real life, this would mean that the Dothraki would have technically lived next door to the Starks.\n\nIn the Glens of Antrim, you can visit the Cushendun Caves where Lady Melisandre gave birth to a \"shadow\" that later kills Renly Baratheon, and where the battle between Jaime Lannister and Euron Greyjoy took place. Explore waterfalls, picturesque valleys, and go searching for the Hound — this is the area where the beloved character was initially found and where he would eventually be left to die.\n\nThe Dark Hedges, Northern Ireland\n\nNorthern Ireland is home to some of the world's most astounding natural beauty, so it makes sense that the Dark Hedges, an avenue of beech trees dating back to the 18th century, were used to film the grandest road in the land: the Kingsroad. The intertwining trees create a romantic tunnel that looks straight out of a fairy tale. Traveling beneath them is a must-do for anyone visiting the far north of Northern Ireland, Game of Thrones fan or not.\n\nBasque Coast, Spain\n\nIn the show, Dragonstone Beach is home to several pivotal scenes. It happens to be where the Burning of the Seven took place, as well as the place where Dany goes home to roost in season seven. The interior of Dragonstone is filmed on a sound stage in Belfast; however, the beach, cave, and footbridge are all real and in the Basque Coast of Spain — specifically, Itzurun in Zumaia and Muriola Beach near Barrika, an hour's drive apart. Basque Country, in northern Spain, is known for its charming villages, coastal cliffs, incredible coves, and vineyards.\n\nGrjótagjá Lava Cave, Iceland\n\nIn perhaps the sexiest scene in Game of Thrones history, Jon Snow proves he doesn't, in fact, know nothing while spending an intimate evening with his Wildling love interest Ygritte. In the show, the pair spend the night north of the Wall, but in real life, the setting of the steamy scene was actually the inside of an Icelandic lava cave containing a thermal spring. Grjótagjá is in the north, near lake Mývatn.\n\nThough it's located right off the famous Ring Road, this cave is notoriously difficult to visit — mostly because the mouth of the cave can be tough to spot in fog or any less-than-ideal weather conditions. It can be accessed via a rocky and adventurous walking trail from Dimmuborgir. Note that bathing in the spring is not safe or permitted.\n\nLokrum, Adriatic Sea\n\nLokrum, which was used for filming scenes in Qarth, the \"Greatest City that Ever Was or Will Be,\" is remote enough to make you feel like you're really living in the story. It's an uninhabited island in the Adriatic Sea but close enough to Dubrovnik, Croatia, to visit via a 15-minute ferry ride. The Benedictine Monastery on the island stood in for Xaro Xhaon Daxos' mansion, which can be seen in the fifth episode of the second season. Also on the island, located at its highest point, is the Fort Royal Castle, which provides incredible views of Dubrovnik across the water.\n\nEssaouira, Morocco\n\nOut of all the characters, Daenerys certainly travels the furthest throughout the seven kingdoms, and in season three, she heads to the Slaver's Bay city of Astapor. There, Daenerys meets the army of the Unsullied, who become her loyal allies. Principal photography for these scenes was shot in the Moroccan port city of Essaouira. In real life, Essaouira is home to a resort, a beautiful sandy beach, and, of course, a medina (market). It is mostly off the Morocco tourist circuit, almost three hours from bustling Marrakesh, which makes it all the more appealing.\n\nAït-Ben-Haddou, Morocco\n\nFar from the coast of Morocco, where Astapor scenes were filmed, a historic ksar (fortified village) made of earthen clay became the setting of other Slaver's Bay scenes as well as Pentos, one of GoT's Free Cities. The real-life structure is perhaps even more storybook-like than the series could portray it — a network of walkways winds through red mudbrick walls dotted with shopfronts showcasing traditional handicrafts.\n\nThe site is now exclusively a tourist attraction, and excursions are offered from Marrakesh. The drive takes about three and a half hours, but it's worth it to see a centuries-old settlement and immerse yourself in GoT culture.\n\nSibenik, Croatia\n\nEveryone's favorite Faceless Man-in-training, Arya Stark, arrives in the Free City of Braavos in the fifth season. Braavos is the wealthiest and most powerful Free City, and scenes from it were filmed in Sibenik, a gorgeous and historical city on the Adriatic coast of Croatia. When you visit, make sure to stop by the Cathedral of St. James, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the filming location for the most powerful financial institution in the Free World: The Iron Bank.\n\nSeville, Spain\n\nWhile watching the series, you might have found yourself gawking at the Water Gardens of Dorne, the opulent palace of the fan-favorite House Martell. The royal residence features colorful mosaics, intricate plasterwork, and stunning gardens packed with lofty palms and hedge-lined walkways surrounding its focal point, the tranquil pool. This oasis exists in real life in Seville, Spain. The Royal Alcázar was built in the 14th century for Peter of Castile. It's now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and bustling tourist attraction in the Andalusian capital.\n\nSeville is also home to the town of Osuna and Plaza de Toros (\"the Osuna bullring\"), which stood in for Daznak's Pit, the largest fighting pit in the Slaver's Bay city of Meereen. This pit was seen in the ninth episode of season five, when Sir Jorah enters combat to fight for the Queen's honor. In real life, the building houses the Museo Taurino, a bullfighting museum.\n\nCórdoba, Spain\n\nEven without its link to Game of Thrones, Córdoba's Roman bridge, constructed during the first century B.C.E., is known to attract tourists from all over. Its 16 arches, based on 16 ancient Roman foundations, stretch majestically across the Guadalquivir River. The structure is a landmark in historic Córdoba and appeared in the fifth season of GoT as the Long Bridge in the Free City of Volantis."
