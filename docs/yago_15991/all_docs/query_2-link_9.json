Does this mean that when Jesus said \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,\" He meant that, far from being impossible, it was merely tricky?\n\nDara O'Reilly, London, UK\n\nThe interpretation that seems to make sense is this. The \"Eye of the Needle\" was indeed a narrow gateway into Jerusalem. Since camels were heavily loaded with goods and riders, they would need to be un-loaded in order to pass through. Therefore, the analogy is that a rich man would have to similarly unload his material possessions in order to enter heaven.\n\nRick, Brighton Uk\n\nI was told that the point about the narrowness of the gate meant the camel had to be unloaded to pass through it. Thus a rich man would need to free himself of his possesions in order to enter paradise.\n\nchris, bristol england\n\nThe eye of the needle used to be in Damascus and was a side gate alongside the main gate of the \"street called straight\" Being a side gate it was not intended for passage by animals especially camels carrying side loads. So it was nigh impossible for the act to happen.\n\nJack Hill, St Albans England\n\nWhen i was at school one of the masters, a devout Christian, was given to explain aspects of the bible to doubters like myself. His explanation of Jesus's parable implied that a rich man wanting to enter the Kingdom of Heaven had to unload a lot of baggage, like a camel going through the \"Eye of the Needle\" gate in Jerusalem\n\nJohn Spiers, Borehamwood England\n\nI've heard it said that this is likely a mis-editing of the Greek. It seems that the original was likely \"kamilos,\" meaning \"knot,\" which became mistaken for \"kamelos,\" meaning \"camel.\" I don't know of an \"eye of the needle\" gate in Jerusalem...\n\nSteve, Clearwater USA\n\nNo. The failure is in the translation. The original word that should have been translated was \"camella\" which means rope. (presumably Greek, but I am open to this being corrected.) \"It is easier for a rope to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven\" makes more sense as a comparison.\n\nWilliam Elsom, UK\n\nWe were taught that there was, indeed, such a gate in Jerusalem and that the point of the image was that camels had to be unloaded of everything they were carrying before they would fit through it. In other words, it is not the rich man as an individual, but the rich man with his \"baggage\", who can't enter the kingdom.\n\nBill Irving, Clacton UK\n\nIn one of the Russian othodox churches close to the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem there is an ancient city gate revered as \"the eye of the needle\".\n\nClapham Charlie, Clapham UK\n\nI agree with the previous writer that a merchant had to unload his camel ie rid himself of his wealth in order to pass through but I thought the gate in question was in Damascus.\n\nFrances, ex London Turkey\n\nI am currently studying the Aramaic language and indeed the word \"gamla\" (transliterated) does mean both \"camel\" and \"thick rope.\" Assuming the original manuscript with that teaching of Jesus was recorded in Aramaic and later translated to Greek, the translator may have been familiar with only the \"camel\" definition of the word. I have not been able to find any reliable information on a city gate called \"The Eye of the Needle.\" Nevertheless, these explanations do not rule out the possibility that it was intended to be heard the way it appears in most English Bibles today, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle...\" We'll need to rely on God for this one :-)\n\nXakk, FL USA\n\nI heard that it was a a small gate used for irrigation.\n\n\"Raptor\", Ephrata USA\n\nIn response to the translation of the word to be either camel or thick rope. It should be stated that rope was often made out of camel hair and could be the cause of confusion in this text. My resources do in fact acknowledge the existence of a needle gate. A gate not only in Jerusalem, but often constructed in city walls of that era. It was very small and easily defended to allow after-hours entrance into the city without leaving the city open to attack.\n\nDanny Beyer, Harrington, USA\n\nAmazing how God's word makes us stretch for understanding. There was no defined Needle Gate in Jerusalem. There was the possibility of Greek and Aramaic translation errors. Should the sewing needle be a carpet needle? Should the camel be a cable? \"Study to show yourself approved\". The rich who focus on and carry a love of materialistic things through life will be hard pressed to enter Heaven.\n\nKeith Lauer, Ashland, Virginia, USA\n\nAs with all subjects, we are given choice. I take this version from a sage over 100 years old. She told me that such a gate was in the wall of Jerusalem. Traders had to unload their goods, pay tax and then they were given access the markets. To a trader, this must have been like heaven.\n\nEric Westacott, London, UK\n\nBlessed are the cheesemakers?\n\nMike Conn, San Francisco, US\n\nThe reality is this. It is impossible for a camel to pass thru the eye of a sewing needdle. So if Jesus is refering to a sewing needle than there will be no rich people in heaven. I know in my heart that this is no true. If it is, why would the bible encourage us to sow so we could increase? That woul also make god a respector of persons, which we know from scripture he is not! The eye of a needle is not a sewing needle, and the small opening makes the most sence to me.\n\nJr. Helmick, Parsons USA\n\nIn the NLT bible Jesus says in Matthew 19:24 \"I'll say it again-it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of A needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\" Note that He says \"a\" needle, not \"the\" needle. It would appear to me that he is using a memorable metaphor about how difficult it is for a rich man to enter heaven, not referencing a specific gate in Jerusalem.\n\nDan Stovall, Prattville, AL, USA\n\nHere's a website with a lot of useful insight into this. http://www.angelfire.com/wy/Franklin4YAHWEH/camelthroughneedle.html What ever the exact translation, the principle remains the same. If you have SELF-MADE wealth, it demonstrates you do not have the SELFLESS attitude required for and developed through salvation. Even if a wealthy person 'discovers' and accepts the Word of God, if they retain the products of their self-made life they (he or she) will always feel able to go back to that if they don't like what God is doing - and there WILL be times when (s)he doesn't like what God is doing in his/her life! That is why they must be shed before progress can be made - a virtually impossible thing for a self-made man to do on his own! That is why the wealthy young man looked so downcast! \"But with God, all things are possible\" and through Him, wealth can be re-established, but with the right attitude, and for the Glory of God, not self.\n\nTim Constable, Coventry, UK\n\nJesus was indeed talking about an actual needle. The Greek word translated \"eye\" is a word that literally means \"hole\". The Greek word translated \"needle\" is the word for an actual sewing needle. It is not a matter of God being a respecter of persons, (i.e.: bring against rich people). Read the next few verses in the story and you will see the resolution, namely: NOTHING is impossible for God, (not even providing a way for rich people to enter Heaven). Further... there is no archaeological evidence for there ever having been a gate in Jerusalem called \"eye of the needle\". Sorry, it's just not there. My hobby is biblical archaeology, and I have many books on the subject. Also, I have been to Jerusalem, and around all the walls of the city. No such gate. Period. The idea was first proposed by a commentator in the Middle Ages, who (I presume) was so pre-occupied with the one verse's statement that it was impossible for a rich person to enter Heaven, that he failed to read the next few verses, (see previous paragraph). Unfortunately the fictitious gate has been perpetuated unknowingly ever since. Lastly, by looking at the few verses preceding the verse in question, you can begin to rightly see the context, and hence interpret the passage. Doing so points us toward the key issue: Entry into Heaven is via faith in Christ, through HIS grace & power and through OUR faith and trust in Christ. Trusting in our savings account, jobs, pensions, and nice material possessions only makes it all the more difficult to trust in God. (Related to this are the two verses which say that we cannot serve both God and Mammon (money/riches)).\n\nRussell Philologus, Connecticut, USA\n\nI feel Russ is right!\n\nLisa Arthur, Florida, US\n\nWith so many different opinions I'd like to see some evidence to prove it is real or not.\n\nJanice Torres, Kirbyville, TX, US\n\nActually, according to the Book of Nehemiah, there was NO GATE CALLED THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE. Jesus was literally saying that the rich will not go to Heaven. There is no such gate listed in the Bible, and there is no way possible that any merchant would unload his goods from a camel, as that would make them easy to steal, right before he got into the city. Don't hoard your wealth. Feed the starving. Help clothe the needy, and do what Jesus would (and did do) with money: spread the Gospel.\n\nGabriel Taijeron, All Over US\n\nAre we making this too complicated? Surely it simply means you what it says. A rich man cannot take it with him when he enters Heaven. We necessarily abandon all material things. Don't imagine that wealth in Earth will be any benefit in Heaven.\n\nDick, London UK\n\nJesus never actually used the phrase eye of a needle. What he said was, dia trypamatos raphidos, which is Greek for through the hole made by an awl. Try getting a camel through that!\n\nCharles, Los Angeles, US\n\nThe translation is irrelevant. We all know in our hearts we cannot love money above God.\n\nDavid Porter, Orangevale, US\n\nThere is no needle gate. There never was a needle gate. It was made up. The reason it was made up, is because once someone is rich, or is born rich, it is hard for them to let go of the wealth of this world, to come to Christ, which he commands us to do Mark 8:34-37. But since the church is hooked on wealth, how would they support their fix, without the rich. If they would admit the truth of what Jesus said, how many rich men would donate and build churches? The proof that Jesus meant and said eye of a needle, is in the response of the disciples, to what Jesus said. They were astonished, exceedingly amazed and said: well who then can be saved? Jesus said this is impossible IMPOSSIBLE with man, but all things are possible with God. I've heard numerous preachers preach about this so called gate, all are ear ticklers and assume themselves more literate, having an evolved understanding , wiser then the disciples who are to these modern Pharisees simple Galileans. That they couldn't put the needle and camel together to figure out what he was speaking of is pure arrogance by a reader. No they knew exactly what Jesus meant, and it astonished them. Much like the parable of the wheat. As a warning I declare to any who read this. Anyone who says that this passage about the rich young ruler is about a needle gate is the following: A false teacher, a blind guide, a wolf in sheep's clothing and a tare. They truly are ashamed of Jesus and his words. If they weren't they would stop trying to rewrite them into a doctrine for gain, for hire and for mammon. So to the original question, is our Lord TRICKY, or are His enemies tricky?\n\nKeith Arndt, Wisconsin, US\n\nTo understand this verse you must understand 2 Corinthians ch8 v9 which reads: \"do you know the GRACE of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that you through his poverty might be rich...in other words Jesus unloaded his wealth on the cross and took your poverty so that he could give you his standing in the kingdom which is righteous and blessed.(prov10:22)...In order for the camel to go through that gate termed the eye of the needle it had to unload the money bags which the merchants put on it....which was what jesus did in 2 Corinthians ch8 v9....He unloaded his wealth and took our poverty...\n\nGenesis Berrios, New York City, US\n\nI'll just stick with Matt6:33 and seek God's Kingdom First and its Righteousness and all else will follow, including the wealth and wisdom and grace to manage the wealth to God's Glory. Amen!\n\nAkpera, Tersoo, Abuja Nigeria\n\nThe words of Jesus are Spirit and they are life. If you translate them in literal meaning you would find yourself Nicodemusing.. therefore, the rich man here might not really mean the physically rich but all the people rich in their hearts in Jealousy, greed, hatred, lies and so on, and cannot free themselves for the Holy Spirit to lead them (Steven called the elders and pharisees, stiff-necked and always refusing the Holy Spirit)...\n\nEric Amobi, Takoradi Ghana\n\nNo-one will take any possessions with them to heaven. However it is not money that is evil but the love of it, putting it ahead of God. To say rich people will not enter heaven is somewhat of a stretch. Jesus had followers who were rich. Lydia was a seller of Purple therefore a wealthy business woman. Jesus was buried in his wealthy friend's tomb. These are just two that we know of. There have been as many wealthy people as poor throughout the centuries who have loved and followed the Lord. The important thing is the place in your heart that money holds and whether you hoard and are selfish with your wealth or if you are generous and use it to help others. God didn't say give it all to Him , He asked for 10% off the top and then anything more is your gift as you decide.\n\nRosalie Dann, Tauranga New Zealand\n\nIt seems that most people appear to be relying on what they have traditionally believed or what they have heard. The eye of the needle is in fact not only narrow, but only tall enough for a human to get through. Thus, a camel would not only have to unload the baggage, but come through the gate on it's knees. Thus, in order for a rich man to be saved, not only must he unload his possessions, but he must also kneel before God. This is consistent with Christ's response to the rich man in directing him to give away his possessions and follow Him. Both are necessary.\n\nMike, Chicago U.S.A.\n\nI think we should not allow this to become a battle that is not worth the potential casualties it can produce. Whatever the facts about the actual terms \"camel\" and \"eye of a needle\", we can clearly surmise that Jesus intends that we know that, if a rich man enters the \"Kingdom of God,\" it will be with extreme difficulty. It should also be pointed out that, because of God's mercy, He cleverly provides a message of hope by the carefully crafted way in which the worded the proclamation. In it, we can deduce that even though it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, because of his lust for worldly possessions and monetary wealth, it is possible that man can escape the inevitable consequence of greed by renouncing money (as it becomes his god) and accepting Christ in its place (which in actuality is the challenge). None the less, I am convinced that this passage of scripture does not insist that a rich man absolutely cannot enter the kingdom of God. After all, the gospel is the Good News - and Christ came into the world . . . not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. I believe He is beckoning and praying for the rich mans conversion!\n\nLeonard, Jacksonville, FL USA\n\nI'm a minister and did research on this because of opinions people and ministers alike give out. I discovered a commentator(scholar) working on a bible(can't remember which one but it was around 10th century). This commentator spoke about the meaning of this passage to friends who had travelled to Egypt. They recalled seeing a gate in Egypt called the eye of the needle and stated maybe Jerusalam had a gate like this as well. The commentator put it in the bible as a footnote(reference) and as time went on it took off.\n\nJames Monday, FT Worth TX, USA\n\nI am saddened that some of you have taken an arrogant approach saying your answer is right and the other guy is wrong, this is a tough passage. Logically the needle gate makes sense, did it exist, who knows because there is so much information for and against, is there any way to prove either side, I doubt it.\n\nTim Reimer, Steinbach Canada\n\nSince Jesus spoke these words, there should be no debate as to a gate named \"the eye of the needle\". Jesus himself says it existed, so we know that it did. This parable is not about wealth and rich people. It is about reverence and belief in God. In order for the camel to pass this gate, the camel would have to go down on its knees; it could not be laden with worldly goods. This does not mean that rich people can't go to heaven; it means that all men who humble themselves to God can.\n\nWilliam Tarn, San Angelo, Texas\n\nThere is no reliable source that discusses there being any gate called the eye of the needle. That was due to a single 9th century source. It says what it means regardless of how uncomfortable that may be for the rich. Use your wealth to care for the poor.\n\nE Individ, Chicago USA\n\nLet's not forget the real issue that Jesus was talking to in this story. The rich man asked Jesus what he must do to enter Heaven and was referred to God's commandments. His answer was \"All these things have I observed from my youth up.\" But, he was lacking the most essential foundation principle of the God's law - Love! Remember that Jesus said elsewhere that \"all the law and the prophets\" hang on our love for God and man. Only God can give us this love, therefore it is impossible for man to keep the law without God's love dwelling in him! \"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\" Rom.13:10. We must die to self (\"take up the cross\", Mark 10:21) and selfishness in order to live in Christ and His love. Christ's love will compel us to share what we have with those who have not, which is \"pure religion and undefiled\"! (James 1:27)\n\nRandy, Texas USA\n\nPersonally I think Jesus meant that if a rich man who carried himself like His primary subject came to Him, it would be completely impossible for him to enter the kingdom of heaven. And the apparatus he used was to provoke us to see the point, so if the needle gate exists, well and good, if it doesn't, no problems, still the primary meaning won't be lost.\n\nVincent Ouma, Mombasa, Kenya\n\nIn the Jewish culture it was not uncommon for people to speak using \"word pictures.\" If there were gates referred to in the city called \"the Eye of the Needle\" which people could access after dark for safety reasons, then the rich young man and eveyone listening would know what \"the Eye of the Needle\" was that Jesus was referring to. It makes more sense that Jesus was saying that in order to please YHWH one would have to choose obedience and life over worldly goods than that it is impossible to please HIM if one is wealthy. As mentioned by others previously, Jesus had many wealthy followers, and was also \"ministered to by women of substance.\" There seems to be as much evidence for there being \"eye of the needle gates\" as there is against the theory. The concept of a physical \"Eye of the Needle Gate\" seems more consistent with His message as a whole than the \"impossible\" reasoning.\n\nDelores Glass, Las Vegas NV. USA\n\nIt's fun to watch rich Christians dance around this passage while defending their wealth. The number of rumours they come up with about gates and mountain passages... A rich man cannot enter heaven, because his riches could have been used to save people from famine, illness or any other number of ailments. But it hasn't. A harsh, cruel example: \"As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.\" In May 2013, Bill Gates was said to be worth $72.7 billion. Nobody else would donate 95% of their net worth to charity, but Bill would still be packing more than $3 billion once he's done. That money could still do a whole lot of Christian good, but it won't. It will fund Bill's lifestyle. Now to you and me, that's fair enough. He's earned that money. It's his to do with a he pleases. But from a purely Christian point of view, Bill Gates isn't going to heaven with $3bil left in his pocket that hasn't done any good. I remember a parable, not sure if it's in the Bible. A rich man donated half his wealth to a charity, and a poor man donated everything he had. The poor man's belongings made much less of an impact than the rich man's, but the poor man was blessed.\n\nLiam Pentland, Durham UK\n\nJews created a religious system whereby people were required to pay the priests for sacrifices at the alter. Rich people were virtually guaranteed Heaven because they could buy their way in. Jesus knew the heart of the rich man and saw his pride in his obedience to the false law system created by Jews. I believe he was telling the rich man that his God was his wealth but he was also telling his disciples that no one can buy their way into heaven. I think he meant to illustrate the impossibility of that fact by using the impossibility of a literal camel passing through the eye of a literal needle. I don't think the passage has anything to do with having money. It's about Jesus proclaiming there is but one way to heaven and God provided it through His Son (With the Father, all things are possible). When his disciples asked how anyone could be then saved, they were asking from the basis of their understanding of the religious system they knew. Jesus was saying that if you follow the law and the system, you must then be perfect in it. Can't be done\n\nKen Sierk, Arkansas, US\n\nJesus was emphasizing on holding on to the things of the world. And it's not only the rich holding on to his or possessions. It could be relationship, work, time or any things shift your focus from eternal things or things of God. You will have to lay aside a lot of things to be able to enter the the kingdom of God. We have also need understand the kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God to understand thoroughly what Jesus meant when He made that statement.\n\nEvans Agyekum, Kumasi Ghana\n\nThere is a good BBC documentary that gives evidence that Jesus followed the silk road to the East and studied at a Buddhist Monastery, and that he returned there after his supposed resurrection to preach until his death in old age. All of his parables are derived from Buddhist teachings reinterpreted into the Jewish society he was trying to bring to awakening to grace. Here he states in a few words a Buddhist teaching. There is nothing wrong with wealth so long as you do good with it. As said above Jesus was supported by many wealthy supporters as was the following after he departed. Many were wealthy displaced Greeks who could not become Roman citizens. I tend to think the Aramaic mistranslation is correct and the footnote in the 10th century is correct. Just because some person today 'walked around' and found no small gate does not mean that 2,000 years ago there were not small exit gates referred to as such. The rich who tithed at the temple to buy there way to god were fooling themselves. All must in fact leave this earth with nothing. So better to do good with your wealth all you 1%ers while you are here. Enough with your second and third homes and fancy cars and diamonds and pearls.\n\njim, delmar NY usa\n\nMany scholars and bible teachers have given their personal opinion on this very verse of the scripture. But I think that explaining this scripture is not all about our qualification and the degrees we have either in theology or any bible related course. I think we have to rely on God for a personal revelation so that we don't contradict Jesus's words. Our disagreement and inability to come to an unanimous answer only shows that our modern Christianity is based on our personal understanding. We should not forget that a parable is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning Therefore, to be able to get this fact right, we must look at the context at which he (Jesus) made that very statement, why he made the statement, who was he referring to, and, above all, let's depend on him for a personal revelation on this so that we don't make ourselves a laughing stock before other religion for the bible cannot be contradicted.\n\nJohn Francis, Abuja, Nigeria\n\nIf we say there is nothing too hard for God and with Him all things are possible, to some Bible scholars my answer may sound far fetched but if we believe the above. We must know that God can either expand the eye of the needle or shrink the camel.\n\nElmo Thomas, Columbia South Carolina United States Of America\n\nI have never heard the \"needle gate\" as to be proven. I think Jesus meant what he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven. I think too often thoughts are added that shouldn't be.\n\nJamie Mullet, New Pairs, US\n\nAdd your answer"
