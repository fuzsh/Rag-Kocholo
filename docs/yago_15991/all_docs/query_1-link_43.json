I treasure the advice, knowledge, and relationships gained. My participation in the program led to the opportunity to write, ‘Delivering Christmas,’ for Hybrid, LLC—a truly special experience as they have produced many of my favorite movies, including one which inspired me to become a screenwriter. A year ago, this was only a dream and Creative Lab Hawaii helped make it real.\n\n-Amy Bircher\n\nAmy Alohilani Bircher was born in Hawaii and raised on Hu’e Hu’e Ranch on the Big Island. As a young girl, her passion for reading evolved into a love for writing. After graduating from Hawaii Preparatory Academy, she attended Sonoma State University in California, where she earned a degree in Communication Studies. A longtime fan of the romance genre, Amy centers her scripts around meaningful stories of love, family, and friendship. After her acceptance into the State of Hawaii’s Creative Lab Hawaii Writers Immersive program, her spec script, “Victorian Christmas,” was optioned by a company that produces content for major television networks. Through the CLH network, Amy received the opportunity for a work-for-hire screenplay, “Delivering Christmas,” which debuted as a TV “mini movie” on Lifetime on Sunday, Dec. 3, 2017. She has since landed another work-for-hire project, an adaptation of a book due to be in production in February 2018.\n\nAmy Bircher is a resident of the Island of Hawaii.\n\nTracy Davidson – “Tracy’s Map,” and “Tracy’s Map Treasure Hunt”\n\nFor 37 years Tracy practiced advertising and sales.

She was a real estate agent from the early 1990’s to 2017, and now holds an inactive license. In 2008 when the real-estate market crashed, she began thinking of ways to help local merchants keep their doors open by networking & driving business to each other. This is how she came up with the idea of “Tracy’s Map.” Helping merchants drive more people to their place of business.\n\nTracy’s very first publication was in June 2013 and since then has become one of the most widely distributed brochure and travel guide throughout the island and beyond. “Tracy’s Map,” a fun, simple, and easy to use, collectible souvenir keepsake that offers valuable information for newcomers and visitors, and how to get around the island. To create additional income and to bring more excitement and adventure to “Tracy’s Maps” Merchants, she came up with the idea to create a mobile game app called “Tracy’s Map Treasure Hunt.” To keep the people excited about returning back to the islands of Hawaii and its shops, and to purchase items and keepsakes for family, coworkers, and friends.\n\n“Tracy’s Map” the app is available on iTunes and Google Play stores.\n\nTracy Davidson is a resident of Kauai.\n\nBrian Kohne – “Kuleana”\n\nBrian Kohne was raised in Hawai’i where he began making movies at Baldwin High school on Maui.

I love that Creative Lab is bringing it home. Creative Lab Hawaii has changed the way I approach the business-side of music entirely, and has opened amazing new connections to mainland industry opportunities.\n\n-Kimie Miner\n\nKimie is a singer, songwriter and recording artist from the Big Island of Hawaii. In 2015, Kimié wrote and co-produced her full-length album, Kimié Miner. The album won “Contemporary Album of the Year” at the Nā Hōkū Hanohano Awards in 2016. After participating in the first Creative Lab Hawai’i Immersive Music Program she had the opportunity to work in Los Angeles with music supervisors and songwriters. During a co-write with Jesse Epstein and Isaac Moreno – IZIK she shared her hook idea of ‘bam bam boo’ and “Bamboo”, a hit song was born. Additionally, Kimie and Izik each separately sold a song to a major entertainment studio.\n\nOutside of just her own music, Kimié contines to be a hardworking businesswoman with her own company, Haku Collective. Haku is a full-service music, audio, and talent production group providing access to the creative output from Hawai‘i’s emerging and leading artists.\n\nIsaac Moreno – IZIK\n\nThe biggest thing in Hawaiʻi is that it’s really hard for us to network outside of the islands. The CLH Music Immersive really opened the doors and allowed me to network with all of these people in the industry.\n\n-Isaac Moreno\n\nIzik began his music career in 2012, performing in bars and restaurants, eventually graduating to bigger stages. He has quickly garnered a reputation in Hawaii as an artist to watch, performing with some of Hawaii’s top artists. His songwriting and voice draws on pop and R & B influences, but his style is uniquely his own. Izik’s first album of original music was released in May 2016.\n\nWithin just a few months of taking part in the immersive, IZIK had licensed two original songs with a major entertainment corporation, giving him the economic flexibility to focus on his art. He cut down his performances from seven nights to a couple of times a week. He, along with Kimie Miner, travelled to Los Angeles, New York, and Australia to perform as part of the Creative Lab Music Immersive’s goal of exposing other markets to Hawai‘i’s creative talents. He is now working on his second album.\n\nOlivia Cargile – LIIV\n\nThe Immersive program experience was life-changing. Each day presented me with the opportunities to expand creatively, foster and develop my music, as well as form bonds that will last a lifetime. There were many highlights of the week-long program, but one that stood with me, in particular, was meeting the people that would later create a song with me and help move my career as an artist to the next level.\n\n– Olivia Cargile – LIIV"
