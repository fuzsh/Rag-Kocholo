        "text": "Los Angeles - A record 58 countries from four continents are vying for nominations in next year's best foreign-language film Oscar category, including first time entrants Iraq and Fiji, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nOrganisers of cinema's top awards unveiled the entrants for the 2006 Academy Awards' foreign movie section some three months ahead of the announcement of the nominations for the 78th annual Oscars.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had invited 91 countries to present a film for consideration for the 2006 Oscar for best foreign film and the winner will be unveiled at a star-studded show in Hollywood on March 5.\n\nIraq entered Requiem of Snow, a Kurdish language film from director Jamil Rostami about Kurds praying for rain in a drought-parched area of the country.\n\nThe tiny Pacific island of Fiji submitted The Land Has Eyes, its first indigenous movie about indigenous Fijians from director Vilsoni Hereniko, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nFrance's hopeful in the race for the coveted golden statuette is Joyeux Noel (\"Merry Christmas\"), a World War I drama directed by Christian Carion, the Academy said.\n\nUnder now hotly-disputed rules, each country can now only submit one film for the best foreign-language Oscar category and that submission must be predominantly in the language of the entering country.\n\nThe rule brought woes to Italy's initial choice for its entrant in the best foreign-language film Oscar race, Saverio Costanzo's Private, a Palestinian drama that was rejected because the dialogue is in Arabic, Hebrew and English.\n\nInstead, Italy submitted Cristina Comencini's film La bestia nel cuore (The Beast in the Heart), which deals with the issues of childhood incest and lesbianism.\n\nIslamic Iran entered Reza Mir Karimi's So Close, So Far, the story of a self-absorbed neurosurgeon who sets off into the desert to locate and reconcile with his 18-year-old son, and a finale involving divine intervention.\n\nHong Kong submitted Perhaps Love, by director Peter Chan Ho-Sun, while China's entry is The Promise, by Chen Kaige.\n\nSouth Africa's entry is Tsotsi, directed by Gavin Hood, a crime drama about a teenage gangster who faces moral dilemmas after inadvertently kidnapping a baby during a carjacking."
