        "text": "There's a tiny island called Rotuma hundreds of miles from Fiji proper. It's about nine miles long by three miles wide, has a population of 2,500 people, and most of them have never seen a movie on a big screen.\n\nRotuma is the setting for The Land Has Eyes, Fiji's first-ever home grown feature film, and one of a handful ever made by Pacific Islanders. It screened last week at The Brisbane Film Festival.\n\nBut how do you negotiate permission to film a traditional Fijian legend on an island where each village owns a different version of the story? Who owns the story? And how do you cast the film, shoot it -- indeed feed and house the crew on such a remote and tiny place?\n\nJeannette Paulson Hereniko, the former director of the Hawaiian Film Festival, produced The Land Has Eyes. It was written and directed by Vilsoni Hereniko, a playwright and professor at the East West University in Hawaii. It's based on his own childhood in Rotuma.\n\nJeannette Hereniko speaks with Julie Rigg. While no Australian distributor has picked up the film yet, Jeannette has hopes."
