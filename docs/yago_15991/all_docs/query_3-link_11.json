Vilsoni Hereniko's The Land Has Eyes (2004) is set in Rotuma and stars indigenous Rotuman actress Sapeta Taito in her d√©but role, alongside New Zealand actress Rena Owen.[2][3]\n\n2004 was also the year in which the film Reel Paradise (United States) was produced. The film depicts the real-life story of American independent filmmaker John Pierson, who, in 2002, took his wife and two children to the island of Taveuni in Fiji to live for a year, and used a vacant cinema to show films free of charge.[4][5]\n\nBoot Camp (2007), starring Mila Kunis and Peter Stormare, is partly set in Fiji, but is not a Fiji-made film.\n\nAlthough Fiji has only ever produced one film, the Fiji Audio Visual Commission aims to attract foreign film-makers and incite them to use the country as a setting. The Commission stated in July 2008 that it hoped Fiji would become known as \"Bulawood\", the Hollywood of the South Seas.[6]\n\nFiji has a large ethnic Indian minority, and Bollywood films are popular both among Indo-Fijians and indigenous Fijians, with some being dubbed in Fijian.[7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCinema of the world\n\nWorld cinema\n\nList of Oceania films"
