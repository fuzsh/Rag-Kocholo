        "text": "After years of writing and directing for the stage, Hereniko made a documentary, THE HAN MANEAK SU (RITUAL CLOWN) IN A ROTUMAN WEDDING. He also studied drama at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in England for his Masters degree. In 1991 the University of the South Pacific awarded him a Ph.D. in Literature and Language. Shortly afterward he joined the faculty of the Center for Pacific Islands Studies at the University of Hawai'i. In 2012 he joined the Academy for Creative Media where he is a full professor teaching courses in film studies and film production.\n\n​\n\nWhile in Hawai'i, Hereniko continued to write plays; several have been produced internationally. He also published extensively, and in 1997 he was presented the prestigious Elliott Cades Award for his “significant body of work of exceptional quality”. Serving on the jury and the selection committee of the Hawai'i International Film Festival from 1990 to 1995 gave Hereniko an opportunity to see many outstanding films from Asia and the Pacific. These inspired him to transition into filmmaking. In 1997 he wrote and directed his first short film, JUST DANCING.\n\nSoon thereafter, Hereniko won the Hubert Bals Fund Award (International Film Festival, Rotterdam) to write what would become the first narrative feature by a Fijian citizen – THE LAND HAS EYES. This film won critical acclaim; it screened at over 30 international film festivals, including Sundance, Rotterdam, Montreal, Singapore, Shanghai, Moscow, Hawai'i, and Brisbane. It won the top award in the Cinema Paradise Film Festival (Filmmaker of the Year, 2004), Wairoa Maori Film festival (Best Overall Entry, 2005) and the Toronto Imaginative Film and Media Arts Festival (Best Dramatic Feature Film). THE LAND HAS EYES was also Fiji's first and only official entry to the Academy Awards (2005).\n\nHereniko returned to Fiji from 2010 to 2012 to serve as the Director of the Oceania Centre for Arts, Culture and Pacific Studies at the University of the South Pacific. During his tenure at USP, he initiated, developed and oversaw the production of a trilogy of musical dramatic productions that became films relating to double-hulled canoe voyaging in the Pacific: VAKA: THE BIRTH OF A SEER, DRUA: THE WAVE OF FIRE, and MOANA: THE RISING OF THE SEA.\n\n​\n\nToday, Hereniko is a Professor at the Academy for Creative Media at the University of Hawai'i.
