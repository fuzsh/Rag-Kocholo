        "meta_description": "Authenticity in cinema is elusive and difficult to explain or analyse, especially in narrative feature films that are, ultimately, works of fiction. And yet audiences expect dramatic fictional films to be authentic because they are supposed to be realistic representations of a people or culture. Working against authentic representation are many factors, including the business side of filmmaking that often leads to compromises in order to entertain or to make indigenous cultures accessible to a global market, unrealistic expectations that a single film with its time constraints can fully represent a culture or a people, and the difficulties and challenges of achieving complete authentic representation in a work of fiction. The pursuit of authenticity, however, is important for indigenous people or minority cultures because misrepresentations can displace and replace their actual experiences or realities.",

        "text": "2 I was one of three on this jury: the Head of the jury is a professor from the Beijing Academy, and (...)\n\n“One Thousand Ropes is a landmark film in indigenous cinema: fearlessly independent, immune to the seductiveness of popular or commercial cinema, and a step forward in Tusi Tamasese’s search for authenticity in representing the lives of Samoans today.”\n\n2This paper explores the notion of authenticity in four narrative feature films set in the Pacific or made by Pacific Islanders: One Thousand Ropes (2016), Disney’s animated feature film Moana (2016), the New Zealand critical and box office success Whale Rider (2002), and the urban romantic comedy Samoan Wedding (2006).\n\n8Does it really matter if Maui, or indigenous cultures, are not portrayed authentically? I believe it does, especially for those whose culture is portrayed. The representation in a film can easily become the de facto source of knowledge about the culture portrayed. For better or worse, film has become the most powerful means by which people today learn about other cultures. Inauthentic representation can therefore be mistaken by viewers as authentic, resulting in a displacement and replacement of a native people’s stories or knowledge. If a major studio owned by a colonizing power made the film, then the natives become doubly colonized: first when it was colonized in real life, and then again when it’s authentic stories are displaced and replaced. When the colonizer’s representation (aka counterfeit) displaces and replaces the original (aka genuine), the damage becomes even more insidious. Slowly over time, the inaccurate representation which is now circulating in social media and the popular imagination can set in, much like the way wet cement can set in and solidify.\n\n10In the film Whale Rider (2002), Paikea is a young Maori girl who aspires to be the leader of her people but is overlooked by her grandfather who believes only males can or should lead the tribe. In the film’s dvd, we hear a discussion between Niki Caro (director) and David Coulson (editor), talking about a scene between Paikea’s grandfather and Paikea’s father. In this scene that was shot but did not make it into the final version of the film, the director and the editor explain that to have the grandfather who is a chief digging up a septic tank as he converses with his son would confuse many viewers who are likely to think that a chief is not supposed to do manual labor of this type. Even though digging up a septic tank would be something a Maori chief would conceivably do in Maori culture, the director and the editor decided that this scene was too culturally specific and made the decision to delete it. The extra features on the dvd shows the deleted scene from the finished movie, drawing attention to the fact that for a mass audience, being culturally specific could be an impediment to connecting with mass audiences outside the culture.\n\n17In conclusion, authenticity in cinema still remains for me an elusive ideal that is difficult to attain because there are so many competing factors at play in the making of a film, least of which is the fact that filmmaking, ultimately, is a business. For those interested in pursuing or exploring this elusive ideal, a few ideas touched upon in this paper are worth reiterating. The first is that audiences expect authenticity in dramatic narrative features even though they are works of fiction. This is because most narrative features aspire to represent reality accurately, thus the more authentic the representation, the more likely that the viewer will be able to suspend their disbelief and be totally immersed in the story unfolding before them on screen. Second, until there is a significant number of films made about any one culture, the one or two existing films about that culture will continue to carry the burden of representation, with the general public looking to this one film (or two films) for accurate information and representation. Third, misrepresentations of a culture in film can displace and replace that culture’s actuality. Misrepresentations therefore can be dangerous. Fourth, the business side of filmmaking complicates efforts at authentic representation, especially when box-office success is a major concern. This concern with box office success often leads to cultural specificity (or authenticity) being compromised in order to accommodate the ignorance of global audiences about minority cultures, including those from the Pacific Islands. When this happens, the film may become a box office success, but it comes at the cost of diminished authentic representation."
