        "text": "Authenticity in cinema is elusive and difficult to explain or analyse, especially in narrative feature films that are, ultimately, works of fiction. And yet audiences expect dramatic fictional films to be authentic because they are supposed to be realistic representations of a people or culture. Working against authentic representation are many factors, including the business side of filmmaking that often leads to compromises in order to entertain or to make indigenous cultures accessible to a global market, unrealistic expectations that a single film with its time constraints can fully represent a culture or a people, and the difficulties and challenges of achieving complete authentic representation in a work of fiction. The pursuit of authenticity, however, is important for indigenous people or minority cultures because misrepresentations can displace and replace their actual experiences or realities."
