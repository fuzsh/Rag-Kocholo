        "text": "What are eye floaters?\n\nEye floaters are small specks or strands or clouds that move across your vision. They can drift across your field of vision and stand out more when you look at something bright.\n\nThey usually don’t affect your vision. Though, if they are large, they may appear to cast a shadow over your vision in some types of light.\n\nEye floaters become more common as we age. They don’t normally go away, but they don’t usually need treatment. Over time, your brain adapts, and you don’t notice them as much.\n\nWhat symptoms are related to eye floaters?\n\nEye floaters can appear as:\n\nblack or grey dots\n\nblobs\n\nsquiggly lines, strands or ‘worms’\n\ncobwebs\n\nrings\n\nThey may dart away when you look at them or may drift away from your field of vision.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nIf floaters in your eye are impacting your vision, you can see your doctor.\n\nRarely, eye floaters can be caused by a tear, haemorrhage or detached retina. These are all medical emergencies.\n\nYour doctor will also rule out other possible causes of eye floaters such as inflammation or infection.\n\nHow are eye floaters diagnosed?\n\nIf your eye floaters are bothering you, talk to your doctor. They will examine your eye to work out what is causing the eye floaters. They may refer you to an ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor) who can look more closely at the back of your eye.\n\nHow are eye floaters treated?\n\nIf your eye floaters are bothering you, there are two types of possible treatment:\n\nsurgery to remove the floater (vitrectomy)\n\nlaser treatment (vitreolysis)\n\nVitrectomy involves making a tiny cut in the eye. Through this cut, the eye floater and some or all of the vitreous can be removed. It is replaced with a solution. This procedure may not remove all of your eye floaters. This treatment does come with the risk of:\n\nbleeding\n\ncataracts\n\na torn retina\n\nVitreolysis uses laser light to treat your eye floaters. Quick pulses of laser light are applied to your eye through a contact lens. This converts the collagen into gas. This makes the floater smaller or completely removes it. Vitreolysis normally takes 20 to 60 minutes, and you can go home afterwards. Most people need 2 or 3 treatments to remove their eye floaters.\n\nCan eye floaters be prevented?\n\nEye floaters are common, especially with age. You cannot prevent floaters, but they do not usually cause a problem.\n\nDo eye floaters cause complications?\n\nEye floaters are usually harmless. If they are caused by a serious condition that is left untreated, you may experience vision loss.\n\nResources and support\n\nVisit the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists website for more information about floaters.\n\nCall healthdirect on 1800 022 222 to speak with a registered nurse, 24 hours, 7 days a week (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria)."
