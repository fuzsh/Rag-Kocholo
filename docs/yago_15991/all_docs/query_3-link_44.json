        "text": "Los Angeles, CA – Sundance Institute today announced the four Fellows and projects selected for the 2009 Sundance Institute Ford Foundation Film Fellowship: Sydney Freeland (Drunktown’s Finest), Adam Piron (The Last Thanksgiving), Rachel Naninaaq Edwardson (Nanum Kigutinga (The Nanuk’s Tooth)), and Brian Young (Walk in Beauty). Chosen from a pool of distinguished artists representing diverse Native communities and backgrounds, these fellows will participate in the Institute’s Native Filmmakers Lab to be held on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico May 18-22, and attend various events at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.\n\nUnder the guidance of Bird Runningwater, Associate Director, Sundance Institute Native American and Indigenous Program, the Native Filmmakers Lab provides an opportunity for Native filmmakers to workshop their early-stage work in an environment that encourages innovation, collaboration and risk-taking. Over the course of the Lab, the Fellows work with an accomplished group of Creative Advisors including Allison Anders, Sterlin Harjo, Kasi Lemmons, and Merata Mita. This year’s Lab will take place on the homelands of the Mescalero Apache Tribe located in southeastern New Mexico. The land covers 460,661 acres of Otero County and is home to more than 3,000 tribal members.\n\n“Storytelling for Native peoples is thousands of years old, while film is just over 100 years old,” said Runningwater. “At this Lab, we are excited to explore the intersection of both of these forms of storytelling and we anticipate that it will yield something new and exciting cinema. The land on which we will be working is stunning and sacred, and spiritual, ripe for and will inspire creativity. We’re especially thrilled to work with this year’s Fellows whose projects cover fresh cinematic terrain that we haven’t seen before.”\n\nSundance Institute supports emerging Native American filmmakers whose work is defining the next wave of Native cinema. In addition to the Native Filmmakers Lab, the Fellowship brings participating filmmakers to the Sundance Film Festival to discuss and pitch their early stage feature film projects with established writers, directors, independent producers, and financiers. In addition to one-on-one meetings with accomplished film professionals, Ford Fellows attend screenings and participate in Native Forum panels and events. After the Festival, Sundance Institute’s Ford Fellows receive ongoing support to bring their projects to fruition.\n\nThe projects and participants selected for the Sundance Institute Ford Foundation Film Fellowship and Native Filmmakers Lab from May 18-22 are:\n\nDrunktown’s Finest/Sydney Freeland (writer/director): Three Native American teenagers struggle through the hardships of life on an Indian Reservation.
