        "text": "On the steppes of Kazakhstan, Asa lives in a yurt with his sister Samal, her husband Ondas, and their three children. Ondas is a herdsman, tough and strong. It's dry, dusty, and windy; too many lambs are stillborn. Against this backdrop, Asa, a dreamer who's slight of build and recently finished with a stint in the Russian Navy, tries to establish a life on the steppes. He, his friend Boni, and Ondas call on Tulpan, the only single girl in the area. The men talk to her parents while she listens out of sight. Her answer and Asa's later trips to talk to her form an arc of hope against the harsh land. Is this the place of Asa's dreams? What about the other lambs?\n\n\"Buta\" is the story of a lonely 7-year old boy (named Buta), who lives in a mountain village with his grandmother. He is befriended by an old man, a liquid soap merchant who once loved (and lost) Buta's grandmother. The old man's friendship and wise advice helps Buta to overcome his difficulties in life. Buta's grandmother, in the meantime, is weaving a special carpet in memory of Buta's mother. The carpet features a special pattern (also called \"Buta\"), which represents love. The boy is inspired by his grandmother's work, and decides to make his own \"buta\" made of rocks and stones, high on the top of the mountain...\n\nFilmed in wartime and edited under candlelight, Mikhail Vartanov's rarely-seen masterwork tells of his friendship with the genius Sergei Parajanov who was arrested by KGB, at the height of his fame, for the outspoken criticism of the Soviet regime. Vartanov resurrects the riveting scenes from his banned 1969 film, The Color of Armenian Land, where Paradjanov concocts the chef-d'oeuvre Sayat Nova (The Color of Pomegranates) - widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time - then reveals a shocking secret request Parajanov sent him in an unpublished 1974 letter from the Ukrainian prisons. Vartanov's camera documents Parajanov's staggering last day at work in 1990 during the making of the unfinished Confession - the original camera negative of which survives in Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992) - as Parajanov comments on this cherished autobiographical film. The foremost achievement of The Last Spring, emphasized by the American and European critics, is Vartanov's exquisite wordless montage that \"evoked the very soul\" of Parajanov and earned the praise of many of cinema's greatest masters, such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n\"Papa\", one of the chiefs of a tribe in the highlands, is taxi driver of a \"Tinpis\", a collective bush-taxi. Saved from an accident by Naaki, a young man from the city, he offers him his daughter in thanks. Johanna and Naaki, however, refuse that their happiness be decided by her father, even though they have already fallen in love.\n\nFrom the Academy-Award nominated creators of the Broadway show STOMP and the award-winning film Wild Ocean, The Last Reef is an uplifting, inspirational large-format and 3D cinema experience capturing one of nature's more vibrant and diverse wonderlands. Exotic coral reefs, vibrant sea walls in the sub-arctic pulsating with anemones and crustaceans: these biodiversity hot spots are as vital to our lives as the rainforests. Shot on location in Palau, Vancouver Island, French Polynesia, Mexico, and The Bahamas using groundbreaking 3D cinematography, The Last Reef takes us on a global journey to explore the connection of our cities on land with the ocean's complex, parallel world of the coral reefs beneath the sea.\n\nLaninbwil's Gift is the story of Jacob, an old island man with a complicated secret. When Jacob was a teenager, a noniep, a Marshallese fairy known for helping troubled souls, transformed him from a simpleton into a normal young man. This favor, however, came with a cost: The noniep made Jacob promise that one day he must bestow this new-found intelligence upon another deserving person. After a lifetime of pondering this otherworldly commitment to the noniep, Jacob discovers Laninbwil, a homeless young man. Just when Jacob begins to get close to the troubled youth, Laninbwil unwittingly gets caught up in a war of mystical power between an evil Mejenkwar, a demon that possesses pregnant women, and her archenemy, the gifted, shamanic old woman, Lijimu."
