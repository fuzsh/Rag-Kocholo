A Fiji film has been submitted for an Oscar for the first time.

The film, The Land Has Eyes, was directed by Vilsoni Hereniko, and has been entered in the foreign-language film category for the awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The film is about a young Fijian girl whose father is unjustly convicted of stealing from a neighbour.

The motion picture premiered at last year's Sundance Film Festival in the United States.
