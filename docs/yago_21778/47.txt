Biography[]

During the escalating efforts of the Hundred Years' War, Marie's family began funding Charles and his military.[1] On 9 March 1429, the Maid of Lorraine Jeanne d'Arc dictated a letter to her step-cousin and affectionately named "Witness", Gabriel Laxart. In the letter Jeanne explained she was to meet Queen Yolande, the mother of the Dauphin's wife, to ascertain whether or not she was the fabled saviour of Orléans.[2]
