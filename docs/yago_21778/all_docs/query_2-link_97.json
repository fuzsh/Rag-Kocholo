        "text": "3 Perkins's article (see note 2) was the first serious attempt to determine the precise nature of Busnoys's ‘Hacqueville Connection’. Perkins added a fifth song, A une dame jay fait veu, to the original group because the colours blue and yellow mentioned in the text are those featured in the Hacqueville family arms. But the Hacqueville arms include not only blue and yellow, but silver and sable as well: ‘un escu d'argent au chevron de sable chargé de cinq aiglettes d'or et accompagné de trois testes de paon arrachées d'azur’. See Tours, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 1182, fol. 274v and de La Chesnaye-Desbois, F. A. A., Dictionnaire de la noblesse, 3rd edn, 19 vols. (Paris, 1863–1876; repr. Nendeln, 1969), iii, p. 192Google Scholar. Moreover, the extant sources for the poem do not agree on the colours. The text of A une dame in Dij, which contains all of the Hacqueville songs, translated reads ‘blue and white’ instead of ‘blue and yellow’, and in the poetry anthology F-Pn fr. 1719, fol. 113, the word ‘jaune’ is crossed out and replaced by ‘noir’. Blue and white are in fact the colours mentioned in the text of Ja que lui ne si actende, where the poet declares that the colours her lover will wear are those of her name, one ‘perse’ (blue-green) and the other ‘blanche’. Blue and white are also the colours of the flowers decorating A que ville est abhominable in Dij, fols. 18v–19 (see below, p. 150), significant not only because Dij alone transmits all of the Hacqueville songs, but especially because of its primacy as a source of Busnoys's music. If colour symbolism is the rationale for adding a piece to the group, it would seem reasonable to expect the songs to refer consistently to the same colours. Therefore, the song may belong to the group, but not quite for the reasons Perkins proposed. In this study I shall focus only on the four songs whose references to Jacqueline are explicit. My subsequent work on the Hacqueville songs has led me to conclusions differing considerably from those of Perkins, but I am indebted to the structural framework and stimulating point of departure his article provided.\n\n34 Membership in the Parlement of Paris carried considerable prestige. Considered as an extension or embodiment of the king's honour, the Parlement had to be respected as such at all costs. Severe penalties were imposed upon anyone – whether an ordinary citizen or a high-ranking official of the realm – who dared to utter a word against one of its members, even the lowliest huissier, living or deceased. (Aubert, F., Histoire du Parlement de Paris de l'origine à François ler (1250–1515), 2 vols. (Paris, 1884), i, p. 124)Google Scholar. Among the numerous examples of individuals punished for insulting a member of the Parlement were two gentlemen who were imprisoned in the Conciergerie when numerous insulting and injurious statements against a deceased counsellor were found in their dossiers. The target of their insults, according to the document, was ‘the late Maistre Jehan Bochart’, Jacqueline's husband. (Ibid., p. 124, n. 1, citing F-Pan Xla 1511, fol. 208). The document in question states that the guilty parties were imprisoned on 28 July 1508, thus leaving no doubt that the ‘late Maistre Jehan Bochart’ refers to the elder Jean and not to his son Jean, who died in 1532. For further references to Jean Bochart see Maugis, E., Histoire du Parlement de Paris de l'avènement des rois Valois à la mort d'Henri IV, 3 vols. (Paris, 1913–1916; repr. New York, 1967)Google Scholar, infra.\n\n41 The names and occupations of her eight children are as follows: (1) Antoine Bochart, seigneur de Farinvilliers, counsellor in the Parlement of Paris, then maître des requêtes de l'hôtel, married to Françoise Gayand (daughter of Louis Gayand, lieutenant general of Clermont in Beauvaisis, and of Jeanne de Feuquiere), with whom he had one daughter; (2) Jean Bochart (ii), seigneur de Noroy and Champigny, avocat in the Parlement of Paris under François i, married to Jeanne Simon, daughter of Philippe Simon, counsellor in the Parlement, and niece [recte sister] of Jean Simon, Bishop of Paris, who gave him the territory of Champigny in honour of his marriage; (3) Pierre Bochart, seigneur de Onzen-Bray, official of Beauvais; (4) Henry Bochart, abbot of Sully, near Fontevrault, where he is buried; (5) Nicolas Bochart, canon and chantre of the cathedral of Beauvais; (6) Magdeleine Bochart, wife of Nicolas le Coq, counsellor to the king and president of the Cour des Aides in Paris; (7) Louise Bochart, wife of Louis Rouillart, sieur de Gandin, counsellor in the court of Parlement; (8) Guillemette Bochart, wife of Antoine de Badouvillers, seigneur de La Varenne, near Montereau-saut-Yonne. (F-Pn DB 104 (Bochart), fols. 1–4v). For further bibliographical information on the Bochart children see Higgins, ‘Antoine Busnois’, pp. 181–9.\n\n44 Apparently the eldest son, Antoine Bochart is the most mysterious of the Bochart children. His title of Seigneur de Farinvilliers, evidently inherited from his father, removes virtually any doubt that he was one of Jacqueline's sons. Although contemporary documents indicate that he was a member of the Parisian Parlement, his name does not turn up in any of the published histories of the institution (F-Pn DB 104 (Bochart), fol. 2). His daughter Claude married François de La Porte, an avocat in the Parisian Parlement. For financial details concerning their marriage contract see, ‘Antoine Busnois’, p. 182, n. 352. Claude Bochart later gave birth to Suzanne de La Porte, mother of Armand-François du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu. See de La Chesnaye Desbois, , Dictionnaire de la noblesse, xvGoogle Scholar, col. 948, and Marvick, E. W., The Young Richelieu: A Psychoanalytic Approach to Leadership (Chicago and London, 1980), pp. 45–62Google Scholar. Antoine Bochart's Christian name seems to have had no antecedent within the Hacqueville or Bochart families as was customary. It would be frivolous at this point to imagine that this could signal some further connection with Antoine Busnoys, but the coincidence is intriguing.\n\n45 du Fresne de Beaucourt, G. L. E., Histoire de Charles VII, 6 vols. (Paris, 1881–1891), iv, p. 89, n. 3Google Scholar, lists one ‘Jacqueline de Hacqueville’, aged twenty-four years, together with a ‘Marguerite de Hacqueville’ among the damoiselles d'honneur of the dauphine. Unfortunately, he failed to cite his source or its date, indicating only that the list had been compiled ‘after contemporary documents’, of which he had amassed a formidable number for his still unsurpassed six-volume study of Charles vii. From subsequent references it is clear that Beaucourt had used Duclos's, C. P.Histoire de Louis xi, 3 vols. (The Hague, 1745–1746)Google Scholar, for much of the section relating to Marguerite d'Écosse. Duclos does mention a ‘Marguerite de Hacqueville’, but Jacqueline is here given the surname ‘de Bacqueville’ and is listed as twenty-five years of age. See Duclos, , Histoire de Louis xi, iii (The Hague, 1746), p. 37Google Scholar. If Duclos was Beaucourt's source it is difficult to explain the discrepancies of both orthography and age. Moreover, several of the women Beaucourt cites are not mentioned by Duclos.\n\nFor these reasons it seems probable that Beaucourt and Duclos used different original documents. Inasmuch as the minuscules ‘b’ and ‘h’ are commonly confused in fifteenth-century palaeography, Beaucourt probably read the name as Hacqueville, and Duclos as Bacqueville. Thibault, M., La jeunesse de Louis xi, 1423–1445 (Paris, 1907), p. 510, n. 4Google Scholar, observed the discrepancy between Beaucourt's orthography and that of Duclos and says that Beaucourt undoubtedly thought Marguerite de Hacqueville and Jacqueline were sisters. In Menu, H., ‘Charles VII et la dauphine Marguerite d'Ecosse à Châlons-sur-Marne (4 mai–18 août 1445)’, Annuaire administratif, statistique, historique et commercial de la Marne (1895), p. 555Google Scholar, they become ‘les deux soeurs Marguerite et Jacqueline de Hacqueville’. Sisters do seem to have been frequently placed at court together, judging from the pairs of women with identical family names who turn up among the attendants of princesses. For example, other ladies-in-waiting of the dauphine and the queen included Annette and Jeanne de Cuise, Marguerite, Jeannette and Antoinette de Villequier, Jeanne and Marguerite Bradefer; the ladies-in-waiting to the wife of Philippe, King of Navarre, in 1339 and 1340 included Jehanne and Margot de Helnet (F-Pn n.a.f. 9175, fols. 640 and 642v); ladies-in-waiting to Jehanne de Laval, second wife of René d'Anjou, in − included Marguerite and Lyonne Cossu (ibid., fol. 675).\n\nOn the basis of these examples, to which dozens more could be added, the likelihood seems strong that Jacqueline and Marguerite de Hacqueville were sisters, and that Duclos's reference to Jacqueline de Bacqueville is probably a misreading or a typographical error. In any case, since the Parisian noblewoman's parents were married in 1444, and since the dauphine's lady-in-waiting was about twenty-four years old in that year, she cannot possibly be the Parisian woman at an earlier stage in her life.\n\n46 King James i of Scotland (1394–1437), poet and author of The Kingis Quair (ed. Norton-Smith, J., Oxford, 1971)Google Scholar, evidently enjoyed a considerable posthumous reputation as a performer and composer of music, according to the testimony of John Fordun, John Major and Alessandro Tassoni, discussed at length by the anonymous author of a curious late eighteenth-century monograph (also containing an edition of The Kingis Quair) entitled Poetical Remains of James the First, King of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1783), pp. 5–7 and 195ffGoogle Scholar.\n\nMuch has been written about Louis's reluctance to marry Marguerite d'Écosse, who had been chosen for him by his father Charles VII as part of a politically strategic alliance with James i of Scotland. Scholars disagree as to the reasons for his evidently intense dislike of her, but there seems to be no basis whatever for the often repeated and profoundly misogynous testimony of the sixteenth-century English chronicler Richard Grafton that her poor hygiene and bad breath drove him away: ‘the lady Margaret, maryed to the Dolphin, was of such nasty complexion and evill savored breath, that he abhorred her company as a cleane creature doth a caryon’. See Beaucourt, , Histoire de Charles VII, iv, p. 90, n. 1Google Scholar.\n\n47 The most celebrated, if apocryphal, tale about her involves the poet Alain Chartier. As the story goes, the dauphine came upon Chartier sleeping on a bench, and bent over and kissed him on the mouth. When her stupefied companion exclaimed, ‘My Lady, I am astonished that you have kissed such an ugly man!’ she replied, ‘I have not kissed the man, but rather the precious mouth which has been the source of so many good and virtuous words.’ Champion, P., Histoire poétique du quinzième siècle, Bibliothèque du xve Siècle 27, 2 vols. (Paris, 1923), i, pp. 131–2Google Scholar, citing J. Bouchet, Annales d'Aquitaine. The story is summarily dismissed by all modern scholars as being totally without foundation, since Alain Chartier was dead by the time Marguerite came to France in 1436. And since she was only four years old when Chartier visited the Scottish court in 1428, it is further presumed that she would have been too young to appreciate his talents. It should be pointed out, however, that we know very little about the education of medieval children and therefore have no basis upon which to form assumptions of any kind about the literary capacity of a privileged noble child reared in the sophisticated literary, artistic, and musical climate that the court of James I evidently provided. Moreover, whether apocryphal or not, the story, which seems to have originated in the mid-sixteenth century, illustrates the extent to which folklore about the dauphine's literary interests must have survived in the popular memory at least a century beyond her own lifetime.

Duclos, , Histoire, iii, p. 47Google Scholar. Especially valuable for its nugget of medieval popular wisdom concerning female infertility, this commentary bears a striking similarity to the nineteenth-century ‘cult of female invalidism’, whereby ‘tightlacing, fasting, vinegar-drinking, and similar cosmetic or dietary excesses were all parts of a physical regimen that helped women either to feign morbid weakness or actually to “decline” into real illness’. See Gilbert, S. and Gubar, S., The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (New Haven, 1979), p. 25Google Scholar. For a compelling discussion of infirmity and sickness as ‘physical evidence of mental and physical purity’ as well as a provocative analysis of the ‘cultural apotheosis of the sublime consumptive’ in fun-de-siècle art see Dijkstra, B., Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siècle Culture (Oxford, 1988), pp. 25–36Google Scholar. The striking and even more bizarre medieval analogue for this behaviour is the subject of a brilliant and compelling study by Bynum, C. W., Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women (Berkeley, 1987)Google Scholar. Taking as her point of departure the centrality of food and food imagery to women's lives Bynum argues that the various food practices of medieval women ‘frequently enabled them to determine the shape of their lives – to reject unwanted marriages, to substitute religious activities for more menial duties within the family, to redirect the use of fathers’ or husbands' resources, to change or convert family members, to criticize powerful secular or religious authorities, and to claim for themselves teaching, counseling, and reforming roles for which the religious tradition provided, at best, ambivalent support' (p. 220). Bynum's conclusions would ambivalent support' (p. 220). Bynum's conclusions would seem to take on a certain relevance to Marguerite d'Écosse in the light of Louis's alleged animosity towards her.\n\n54 The morals of creative women in music, literature and art have historically tended to be viewed with suspicion. For examples of the notion that music-making, and especially music composition, was dangerous to a woman's chastity see Bowers, J., ‘The Emergence of Women Composers in Italy, 1566–1700’, Women Making Music, pp. 139–41Google Scholar. In later centuries, women composers like Corona Schröter feared that publication of their music would be perceived almost as an act of promiscuity. See Citron, M., ‘Women and the Lied, 1775–1850’, Women Making Music, p. 230Google Scholar. Many creative women were the targets of innuendo. The sixteenth-century poet Louise Labé, for example, was accused of granting sexual favours to the men of Lyons (Jones, A. R., ‘City Women and their Audiences: Louise Labé and Veronica Franco’, Rewriting the Renaissance: The Discourses of Sexual Difference in Early Modern Europe, ed. Ferguson, M. W., Quilligan, M. and Vickers, N. J. (Chicago, 1986), pp. 302–3)Google Scholar. The seventeenth-century English writer and playwright Aphra Behn was considered a ‘shady lady’ (Gilbert, and Gubar, , The Madwoman, p. 63)Google Scholar, and the composer and singer Barbara Strozzi (1619–1664?) is reputed to have been a Venetian courtesan (Rosand, E., ‘The Voice of Barbara Strozzi’, Women Making Music, p. 172)Google Scholar. Since many creative women clearly did have libertine attitudes towards sexuality, such suspicions were not always without foundation. Indeed, given the stigma of impropriety associated with any public acknowledgement by a woman of her creative activities, it is probably no coincidence that women who did publish their work were those who seem to have been least concerned about notions of respectability, or whose respectability was presumably beyond question (e.g. nuns). As Newcomb (‘Courtesans, Muses’, p. 102), Rosand (‘The Voice’, p. 172) and others have pointed out, a long tradition of serious music-making by courtesans existed in Venice. Curiously, though, the subject has never been pursued in a scholarly study. The degree of literary cultivation among certain Venetian courtesans must have been high, to judge from Pietro Aretino, who said of one: ‘She knows by heart all Petrarch and Boccaccio and many beautiful verses of Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and a thousand other authors.’ Quoted in Burckhardt, J., The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (New York, 1958), p. 394, n. 2Google Scholar. With regard to women writers in the nineteenth century, morality and respectability became so closely linked to economic success that they could no longer risk the kind of sexual innuendo surrounding a woman like Aphra Behn. See Gilbert, and Gubar, , The Madwoman, pp. 63–4Google Scholar.\n\n69 Since ‘her poems are of the same high quality as his’, and the style of her lyrics ‘indistinguishable’ from Machaut's, employing ‘identical rhyme, meter, imagery, and diction’, they cannot possibly have been written by her. ‘… the brilliant young poetess existed only in Guillaume de Machaut's imagination. A fictional character, she is not to be identified with Péronne d'Armentières or anyone else who actually lived in the fourteenth century.’ (Calin, p. 170, upholding the arguments of G. Hanf). Especially noteworthy is the assumption that Péronne's poems would necessarily have been inferior in quality to those of Machaut. The alleged indistinguishability of Toute Belle's lyrics from Machaut's notwithstanding, when the late Machaut scholar Sarah Jane Williams examined the poems she found striking divergences from Machaut's standard procedure at every turn: ‘Whereas ballades far outnumber rondeaux elsewhere in Machaut's literary and musical repertory, the proportion is reversed in the Voir Dit, where rondeaux outnumber ballades thirty to nineteen.’ As Williams points out, this may well be due to the fact that Toute Belle initiated the lyric exchange with a rondeau, and that the form was an easy one for her to grasp. Moreover, the first few rondeaux attributed to Toute Belle ‘are written in forms of the rondeau rarely if ever found in Machaut's work elsewhere’. The third rondeau sent by Toute Belle is unique among all Machaut's others in alternating long with short lines; two of the virelais have only a single stanza, instead of three; and her ballade Regrete la compaignie and the virelai Cent mille fois esbahie both have only two instead of three stanzas, an irregularity commented upon by Machaut in the text. See ‘The Lady, the Lyrics and the Letters’, Early Music, 5 (1977), pp. 462–8CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Another study, using a computer-aided linguistic analysis of the poems, demonstrated that there are in fact striking qualitative differences in the vocabularies of the poems attributed to Machaut and Péronne respectively. See Musso, N., ‘Comparaison statistique des lettres de Guillaume de Machaut et de Péronne d'Armentière dans le Voir-dit’, Guillaume de Machaut: Colloque, Table Ronde, Reims, – avril 1978 (Paris, 1982), pp. 175–93Google Scholar. Musso's evidence was challenged by literary critics on the grounds that the apparent linguistic differences might have been deliberately created by Machaut. This, however, seems to me the strongest evidence in favour of the existence of Péronne or a woman like her. Even if Machaut wrote the poems himself, attempting to emulate the written prose of a young woman, this presupposes (a) that he probably knew of women writers and (b) that he perceived qualitative ‘differences’ in their writing to the point of having concrete notions about how they would manifest themselves in a literary text. Whether or not gender difference can be discerned in literary texts is a controversial topic being heatedly debated in late twentieth-century literary critical circles. Machaut was indeed remarkably ahead of his time if he perceived such subtle distinctions some six centuries ago. My thanks to Professor Lawrence Earp for drawing my attention to Musso's article.\n\n75 Pour tous les maulx d'amours guerir, F-Pn n.a.f. 15771, fol. 34, ‘Recepte de la Raine’, ed. Inglis, , Le manuscrit, p. 137Google Scholar. The poem survives anonymously in F-Pn fr. 1719, fol. 75r; Roh, fol. 202v; Carpentras, Bibl. mun. MS 375, fols. 55r, 65r; F-Pn fr. 25458, fol. 441r; F-Pn fr. 1104, fol. 92v; London, British Library, MS Harley 6916, fol. 181v; and F-Pn n.a.f. 7559, fol. 68r. The attribution ‘Recepte de la Raine’ in all likelihood refers to Queen Marie d'Anjou. See Angremy, A., ‘Un nouveau recueil de poésies françaises: Le MS B. N. nouv. acq. fr. 15771’, Romania, 95 (1974), p. 4CrossRefGoogle Scholar. The dauphine's household was incorporated with that of Queen Marie d'Anjou, with whom she travelled constantly. Marie d'Anjou was the sister of Duke René d'Anjou, another of the noble literary amateurs of his day. Champion published the poem as a work of Charles d'Orléans because it appears in his autograph manuscript without an attribution. The existence of several other poetic ‘recipes’ ‘for curing the ills of love’ by other poets suggests that it was among those themes developed at the Orléans court such as ‘je meurs de soif auprès de la fontaine’. Inglis, B. (Le manuscrit, p. 206)Google Scholar has suggested the possibility that ‘la Raine’ could also refer to Jeanne de Laval, ‘reine de Sicile’, second wife of René d'Anjou. Inglis cited the existence of another ‘recepte’ similar to this one attributed to Jean de Lorraine (son of René, and stepson of Jeanne de Laval) in support of this hypothesis. In light of the evidence presented here concerning the close interaction among the women of the French court and the Orléans court, as well as the numerous pieces by French court poets surviving in the manuscript, it would seem more likely that a non-specific reference to ‘the queen’ would be to the Queen of France, Marie d'Anjou.\n\n77 To put this remark in perspective, a dozen poems a day would have exceeded the ‘100 verses’ Machaut claimed to be capable of writing when he was having a good day. Even accounting for the possibility of Tillay's exaggeration, this is still a considerable output. Marguerite d'Écosse might well have been a female analogue of Charles d'Orléans. Yet, surprisingly, of the dozens of scholars who have mentioned her activities as a poet none seems to have considered this possibility; all have contented themselves with presuming the mediocrity of her poetic gifts, even though her poetry seems not to have survived. See for example Kendall, P. M., Louis XI: The Universal Spider (New York, 1971), p. 63Google Scholar: ‘Like her father, James i of Scotland, Margaret was enamoured of poetry, though it is doubtful – none of her compositions has survived – that she possessed her father's genius’; and Cleugh, J., Chant royal: The Life of King Louis xi of France (New York, 1970), p. 60Google Scholar: ‘No examples of Margaret Stuart's verses survive … she fervently admired Alain Chartier and Charles of Orléans … it is improbable, however, that she attained the heights of lyrical imagination and delicacy of statement which they achieved.’ Such statements, of which there are many more examples, are emblematic of the ways in which the literary and musical creations of women, even when they have survived, have historically tended to be dismissed without a reading or hearing. The subject with regard to women writers has been treated in a witty, polemical and powerfully sobering work by Spender, D., The Writing or the Sex? Or, why you don't have to read women's writing to know it's no good (New York, 1989)Google Scholar. I raised similar questions with regard to musical creativity and women composers from the late eighteenth century to the twentieth in my paper ‘In her Brother's Shadow: The Musical Legacy of Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel’, Proceedings of ‘The Changing Patterns of Our Lives: Women's Education and Women's Studies’, A Sesquicentennial Symposium at Duke University, – March 1989 (Durham, NC, 1989), pp. 37–49Google Scholar.\n\n78 Both Coldwell, M. V. (‘Jougleresses and Trobairitz: Secular Musicians in Medieval France’, Women Making Music, pp. 55–6)Google Scholar and Brown, H. M. (‘Women Singers and Women's Songs in Fifteenth-Century Italy’, Women Making Musk, pp. 64–5)Google Scholar try to explain the absence of polyphonic compositions attributed to women from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. Coldwell attributes this to political considerations and Brown to the exclusion of women from cathedral schools. Curiously though, precisely the same obstacles existed for women composers from the mid-sixteenth century on, and they somehow managed to circumvent them. Brown is much closer to the mark, in my view, when he suggests that perhaps women were composing music but could not admit to doing so (p. 64). Given the vast number of pieces surviving anonymously in musical manuscripts from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, it would not be at all surprising if works by women were among them. The more fundamental question that needs to be raised is this: since there is abundant evidence that women in convents and monasteries, as well as aristocratic women, did compose monophonic music up to c. 1300 and polyphonic music from 1566 on, often against considerable odds, what would have stopped them from doing so during the intervening 250 years?\n\n95 Cerquiglini, pp. 233–43. Cerquiglini's resolution ‘Guillaume de Machaut, Perronne fille a amer’ is based on her disagreement with Paulin Paris's alteration of the rhyme ‘fame’, which appears in all the manuscripts, to ‘dame’ and a variant spelling of the word ‘nule’ and ‘nulle’. Another solution of the anagram, ‘Guillaume de Machaut amera fille Perronne’, was proposed by Suchier, H., ‘Das Anagramm in Machauts Voir dit’, Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie, 21 (1897), pp. 541–5CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Other ‘signature’ anagrams appearing in Machaut's works include the one at the end of Le confort d'ami: ‘Guillaume de Machaut, Charles roi de Navarre’ (vv. 3968–70); and at the end of La prise d'Alexandrie: ‘Guillaume de Machaut, Pierre roi de Chipre e de Iherusalem’ (vv. 224–5). See Cerquiglini, pp. 235–6. Cerquiglini's resolution is not without its own problems however, as P.-Y. Badel noted in his review of her book (Romania, 106 (1985), pp. 550–61)Google Scholar. While her argument that the Voir-dit anagram should correspond structurally to those in other of Machaut's works is basically sound, that anagram would be more truly parallel to Machaut's others if it were to say ‘Péronne, x de y' with x being a title and y being a territory, as Badel suggests. Although Badel does not mention this, Paris's resolution is actually closer to Machaut's others in that there is at least a y, and if one assumes the x to be understood: Guillaume de Machaut, Peronelle [dame] d'Armentière’. Moreover, as Badel noted, it is doubtful whether the phrase ‘fille a amer’ would have had any medieval significance.\n\n110 Perkins noted the symbolic location of Bel Acueil as the first piece in the chansonnier, interpreting it as a song of welcome or greeting for the young princess (Mellon Chansonnier, i, pp. 1, 19–20, 32Google Scholar). van Benthem, Jaap (‘Concerning Johannes Tinctoris and the Preparation of the Princess's Chansonnier’, Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis, 32 (1982), pp. 24–9)CrossRefGoogle Scholar took Perkins's conclusions several steps further in pointing out the correspondence of the first two initials, B and A, with those of her name and the coincidence that the manuscript consists of three sections, each of nineteen pieces and each ending with a reference to Beatrice. The reason for division by nineteen, according to Benthem, is that it represents the numerical equivalent of ‘T’, the first letter of ‘Tinctoris’, the compiler and arranger of the manuscript. He also showed that the number of notes in the tenors of several pieces corresponds to the cipher of her name. Worth mentioning, too, is the coincidence that Beatrice of Aragon's initials are those of Busnoys's name in retrograde, something Busnoys was unlikely to have missed.\n\n119 By a ‘feminist revision’ I mean a critical reinterpretation of a woman's role which has traditionally been viewed as negative or subordinate (such as that of Eve) that casts her in a more favourable light or superior position. Perhaps the best example is that which appears in de Pizan's, ChristineL'epistre au dieu d'amour (1399), vv. 245–53Google Scholar, where she claims that woman, and not man, was the superior creation because she was made from better-quality material – a human rib made by God (‘le plus noble des choses terriennes’) - and not from the slime of the earth (‘du lymon de la terre’), as Adam was. Significantly, the same twist to the creation story is echoed in de Romieu's, MarieBrief discours: que l'excellence de la femme surpasse celle de l'homme (1591), vv. 31–6Google Scholar: ‘la matière de chair est-elle pas plus belle … que n'est celle qui fut formée du limon?’ For editions of both poems see The Defiant Muse: French Feminist Poems from the Middle Ages to the Present: A Bilingual Anthology, ed. Stanton, D. C. (New York, 1986), pp. 14–28 and 46–63Google Scholar. Given the overwhelming tendency in medieval and renaissance culture to view Mary and Eve as bipolar opposites of supreme goodness and evil incarnate, the sympathetic portrayals of Eve by Christine de Pizan in w. 258–70 of the poem mentioned above are also striking. I plan to discuss these and other examples in a study currently in progress entitled ‘“From Adam's Rib”: Feminist Exegeses of Genesis i–iii’.\n\n124 Bogin, , The Women Troubadours, p. 68Google Scholar. The view that the women troubadours took over male themes and changed the gendered voice is surprisingly prevalent despite its patent invalidity. In an otherwise pioneering and insightful article, Howard Brown (‘Women Singers and Women's Songs’, p. 77) makes a similar claim about fifteenth-century songs in a woman's voice, which he acknowledges were probably written by women. Moreover, such arguments fail to note the ideas expressed by women that are never expressed by men, or that would be virtually inconceivable coming from men. A study by A. Tavera claims that extremely close readings of texts by the trobairitz, phrase by phrase, word by word, reveal more than a dozen ways in which these poems are completely distinct from those found in pieces by male troubadours. See ‘A la recherche des troubadours maudits’, Exclus et systèmes d'exclusion dans la littérature et la civilisation médiévales, Sénéfiance 5 (Aix-en-Provence, 1978), pp. 137–62Google Scholar. Although the author's perspective is marred by his attribution of these differences to a biologically determined ‘feminine’ nature, some of his remarks about the specific textual differences are perceptive and worthy of closer examination. The observations of Ferrante (see note 123) further corroborate the idea that there are discernible rhetorical differences in the language employed by the troubadours and trobairitz.\n\n127 Although not specifically designated ‘réponse’, the poem of Madame d'Orléans, ‘En la forest de Longue Actente’ immediately follows that of Charles d'Orléans on the same theme, and shares many of the same A-rhyme words. The exchange between Jammette de Nesson and Tanneguy du Chastel is explicit. In the margin of the folio where Nesson's poem appears is the inscription: ‘la response est de l'autre costé par faulte du relieur.’ The relationship between these two poems is even more striking: not only do they share both A and B rhymes, they reproduce every one of the same rhyme words in identical sequence, but in different grammatical context. Especially noteworthy are the incipits of the two poems. Nesson's reads: ‘C'est pour me receller les biens’ and Tanneguy's ‘Puis qu'en moy cuidez tant de biens’, both of which seem to echo the incipit of the anonymous poem ‘Pour les biens qu'en vous je parçoy’ (italics mine). A poem to which Jehanne Filleul's Hélas mon amy sur mon ame seems to be a response immediately precedes it in Le jardin de plaisance, 1, fol. 81v. It too contains an allusion to biens, in line 3. At least one of these exchanges was initiated by the woman, that of Jammette de Nesson. Similarly, in Machaut's Voir-dit it was Toute Belle who launched the exchange of poems by sending Guillaume a rondeau, and significantly, over half the Voir-dit's lyrics are pairs of pieces with related subjects, rhymes and verse forms (see Williams, ‘The Lady’, p. 465)."
