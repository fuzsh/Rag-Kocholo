        "text": "A translation into English by A. S. Kline. Published with illustrations.\n\nRenÃ© of AnjouÂ (1409â1480) wasÂ Duke of AnjouÂ andÂ Count of ProvenceÂ from 1434 to 1480, and also reigned asÂ King of NaplesÂ from 1435 to 1442. He spent his last years inÂ Aix-en-Provence, and was known there as theÂ Good King RenÃ©. He was a great-grandson ofÂ John II of France, and his sister Marie married Charles VII of France. He was also for several years Duke of BarÂ andÂ Duke of Lorraine. His younger daughter Margaret married Henry VI of England.\n\nTwice wed, Rene took a lesser part in military and political affairs after his second marriage, devoting himself to the arts and domestic pursuits. An amateur painter himself, he sponsored a number of works in theÂ Early NetherlandishÂ style, employingÂ BarthÃ©lemy dâEyckÂ as his court artist,Â developing, as patron, a school of fine arts in sculpture, painting, goldsmithâs work and tapestry. He also revived a lapsed order of chivalry, the Order of the Crescent.\n\nHe exchanged verses with his kinsman, the poetÂ Charles dâOrlÃ©ans, was influenced by the works of Alain Chartier, and amongst other creative efforts, was the author of two allegorical works: a devotional dialogue,Â Le Mortifiement de vaine plaisance (The Mortification of Vain Pleasure, 1455), and the love questÂ translated here, and the love quest translated here, Le Livre du Coeur dâAmour Ãpris (The Book of the Heart Seized by Love, 1457). This latter employs the conventions of Arthurian romance to create a detailed allegory of love with affinities to Guillaume de Lorrisâ original Romance of the Rose, developing and enriching the efforts of previous writers, and encapsulating the Medieval period to the benefit of the imminent Renaissance.Â Both of the aforesaid works by RenÃ© were finely illustrated by BarthÃ©lÃ©my dâEyck. RenÃ© also sponsored a fresh translation of Ovidâs Metamorphoses (1467). Two of the finest extant illuminated manuscripts of Le Livre du Coeur dâAmour Ãpris are Codex 2597 in the Austrian National Library (Vienna), and fr. 24399 in the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale (Paris).\n\nLe Livre du Coeur dâAmour Ãpris is dedicated to Jean II, Duc de Bourbon (1426-1488), Constable of France (1483), and the brother of RenÃ©âs daughter-in-law, Marie de Bourbon, who had married his son Jean (de Calabre). Jean II married Jeanne, a daughter of Charles VII of France, and RenÃ©âs niece. Jean IIâs father, Charles, had assisted in the release of RenÃ© from earlier captivity in Burgundy (1436), and the dedication is evidence of a firm friendship, between the âcousinsâ, RenÃ© and Charlesâ son, Jean II.\n\nThe translation rendered here mirrors the mix of verse and prose in which the work was written, the verse being in rhymed couplets, in varying metres.\n\nPublished by Poetry in Translation."
