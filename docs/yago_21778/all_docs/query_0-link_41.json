        "text": "Joan of Arc marries Charles VII becoming Queen after his death\n\nWhat if Marie of Anjou was barren and Charles VII took Joan of Arc (who doesn't take a vow of celibacy) as his mistress and married her after Marie died. Joan avoids capture and produces an heir. Charles VII dies while his heir is a minor and Joan rules as Queen regent\n\nPC: Philip the Good marries Isabella of Lorraine\n\nEDIT: after some delibiration I have decided to make this thread Plausibility Check instead of What If as it originally was. Probably the updated describtion fits much better to what I want this thread to be compared to the original one. Disclaimer 1: the idea of the PoD does not belong to me..."
