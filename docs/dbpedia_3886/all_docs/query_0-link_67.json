No genre was left untouched. The incomparable film director Stanley Kubrick will unfortunately not see the year 200¡. Nor will screen legends George C. Scott, Victor Mature, Dirk Bogarde, Oliver Reed, Faith Domergue, Rory Calhoun, Anthony Newley, Ruth Roman, Bob Peck and Sylvia Sidney. The Starship Enterprise is now short its first original regular crewman with the loss of Star Trek’s Dr. McCoy — DeForest Kelley. Fans of singing cowboys, still reeling from the passing of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers last year, saw the loss of Eddie Dean, Rex Allen and Tito Guizar. Western fans also saw the passing of television’s best known lawman, Clayton “the Lone Ranger” Moore, and leading Native American star Iron Eyes Cody. The screen’s first Superman, Kirk Alyn; the creator of the Phantom and Mandrake, Lee Falk; and the voice of Wilma Flintstone, Jean Vander Pyl, also died in ¡999. Major music figures Hank Snow, Yehudi Menuhin, Boxcar Willie, Hoyt Axton and Al Hirt, and familiar television faces Allen Funt, Ross Elliott, Shirley Hemphill, Mabel King, Madeline Kahn, Henry Jones, Ellen Corby, David Strickland, Dana Plato, and Peggy Cass are also listed in this volume. The world of sports lost Wilt Chamberlain and Joe DiMaggio, and sports entertainment saw the passing of professional\n\nwrestlers Rick Rude, Gorilla Monsoon, the Renegade and Owen Hart. The ranks are also reduced of Dead End Kids/Bowery Boys (Huntz Hall, William Benedict), Little Rascals (Harold Wertz) and Oz’s Munchkins (Murray Wood and Harry Monty). Also found in these pages are James Bond’s master gadgeteer Q, Desmond Llewelyn; the Godfather’s literary father, Mario Puzo; directors Charles Crichton and Edward Dmytryk, Italian horror filmmakers Joe D’Amato and Riccardo Freda, legendary striptease artist Lili St. Cyr, and magazine publisher and former First Son, John F. Kennedy, Jr. This book provides a single source that notes the deaths of all major, and many minor, figures in the fields of film, television, cartoons, theatre, music and popular literature. The obituaries within this volume contain pertinent details of deaths, including date, place and cause, of 578 celebrities. Biographical information and career highlights and achievements are also provided. I have also included a complete-as-possible filmography for film and television performers. Most obituaries are followed by citations to major newspapers and periodical stories reporting the death. A photograph has been included for many of the individuals. I have been writing obituaries of film personalities for over twenty years, beginning with a column in Forry Ackerman’s Famous Monsters\n\n¡\n\nIntroduction of Filmland in the late ¡970s. Many of the film obituaries in the work are taken from my monthly column in Classic Images (P.O. Box 809, Muscatine, IA 5276¡), a newspaper devoted to classic films and their performers. I also write a small column on science fiction film-related deaths for the Science Fiction Chronicle (P.O. Box 022730, Brooklyn, NY ¡¡202). Information on the passing of the individuals found in this volume has been gathered from a myriad of sources. Primary sources, as previously noted, are listed in the individual bibliographies, including The New York Times,\n\n2 The Los Angeles Times, The Times (of London), The Washington Post, Variety, Time, People, TV Guide and Newsweek. Other sources include Boyd Mager’s Western Clippings, The Memphis Commercial Appeal, The Hollywood Reporter, The (Manchester) Guardian, The Comics Buyer’s Guide, Locus, The Boston Globe, Pro Wrestling Torch, Psychotronic Video, The Comics Journal and Facts on File. Several sources on the internet have also been helpful, including You’re Outta Here! (http://www.cnjetworks. com/~roryb/outta.html) and the Internet Movie Database, Ltd. (http://us.imdb.com/).\n\nREFERENCE BIBLIOGRAPHY DeLong, Thomas A. Radio Stars. Je›erson, NC: McFarland, ¡996. Dimmitt, Richard Bertrand. An Actors Guide to the Talkies.
