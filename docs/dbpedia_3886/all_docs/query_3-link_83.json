        "text": "BY JOHN M. WHALEN\n\nâ€œWhen you go down in deep water, youâ€™re scared. You donâ€™t know how scared you can be. Soon, you forget. But the reef never forgets. It just waits.â€â€”Gilbert Roland as Mike Petrakis.\n\nâ€œBeneath the 12-Mile Reef,â€ released in a limited edition (3,000 copies) Blu-ray by Twilight Time, is either the second or third movie ever made in Cinemascope. â€œThe Robeâ€ was the first, and â€œHow to Marry a Millionaireâ€ was in production at the same time as â€œReefâ€ so thereâ€™s some dispute about the release chronology. Basically â€œBeneath the 12-Mile Reefâ€ is Romeo and Juliet set in the sponge-diving world around Tarpon Springs, Fla. with a young Robert Wagner and Terry Moore as the â€œsponge-crossedâ€ couple. Wagner plays Tony Petrakis, son of Mike (Gilbert Roland), one of the best Greek sponge divers in the business. Moore plays Gwyneth Rhys, daughter of Thomas Rhys (Richard Boone) the leader of the Conches, the Anglo â€œhook boatâ€ sponge fishermen. According to the script by A.I. Bezzerides, thereâ€™s no love lost between the two factions. Greeks stay out in the deep water, the Conches fish in the shallow waters of the Everglades.\n\nTimes are tough for the Greeks, however. The sponges are disappearing. And Mike owes money to a loan shark who threatens to take his boat. Mike and his family have two choices. They can go out to the 12-Mile Reef where Mike already lost one of his sons or they can try moving into the Evergladesâ€” Conch territory. They try the Everglades and do okay until Conch Arnold Dix (Peter Graves) shows up with some buddies, threatens to cut Mikeâ€™s air hose and grabs their sponge haul. When Mike gets back to Tarpon Springs he looks the Conches up at their favorite watering haul to settle the score. There Mike meets Rhys and Dix but violence is prevented when cops show up. Meanwhile, young Tony and Gwyneth catch love at first sight and run off together while the grownups are arguing. Wagner, complete with hair dyed black and permed to make him look Greek, plays Tony as the young stud trying to get out from under the shadow of his macho father, who calls him â€œLittle Tony.â€ Moore plays a goofy girl gaga over handsome Tony, even though Dix thinks heâ€™s her boyfriend.\n\nâ€œBeyond the 12-Mile Reefâ€ has plenty of plot complications, which only get worse when Mike decides his only recourse is to dive the 12-Mile Reef. On the way out to the reef, Roland, in one of his best performances as a tough but tender-hearted macho man, gives the speech quoted above, telling Tony he canâ€™t let him dive because itâ€™s too dangerous.\n\nI donâ€™t want to give too much more of the plot away. Itâ€™s a very simple story with very broad characters, and admittedly has a totally unbelievable ending. Iâ€™ve read a lot of nasty reviews of the film that dismiss it as shallow melodrama with some critics, even faulting screenwriter Bezzerides for inventing the sociological issues posed by the conflict between the Greeks and the Conches. But who cares about that?\n\nâ€œBeneath the 12-Mile Reefâ€ on Blu-ray is an exceptionally entertaining movie for several reasons. First is the on-location Cinemascope photography shot around Tarpon Springs and Key West by Edward Cronjager. Director Robert D. Webb uses Cronjagerâ€™s camera to capture a lot of the local color and some of the culture of the Greek divers. Iâ€™ve been to Tarpon Springs and it doesnâ€™t look much different today. The underwater scenes are spectacular. Second is a near-perfect music score by the inestimable Bernard Herrmann. Bernie outdoes himself with this soundtrack, providing a truly sensory experience that makes you feel your down in the water with the divers. Third, is the presence of two great actors in the cast. Roland and Boone provide the anchor for this film, giving it a weight its two fledgling co-stars simply didnâ€™t have. Enough cannot be said about Roland, who never fails to give his characters a sense of â€œstatureâ€ as he so eloquently put it in â€œThe Lady and the Bullfighter.â€ Boone as Rhys has the authority needed to play a man who all the Conches look up to.\n\nThe fourth thing that makes â€œBeyond the 12-Mile Reefâ€ so entertaining (and I may never be asked to write another review for Cinema Retro for saying this) is that it includes an underwater octopus fight scene. Iâ€™m not giving anything away here. The poster for the movie shows Robert Wagner battling the eight-tentacled menace. I have to admit Iâ€™m a sucker for any movie that includes an underwater octopus fight scene. There have been quite a few movies featuring a fight with a giant octopus in case you werenâ€™t aware of it. Who can forget Johnny Weissmuller battling one off the diving cliffs of Acapulco in â€œTarzan and the Mermaids?â€ And what about Buster Crabbe battling the Octo-Sac in the â€œFlash Gordonâ€ serial? Of course we must not forget â€œ20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,â€ where Kirk Douglas fought off a giant squid attacking the Nautilus (squids count). And I bet you didnâ€™t know that even Humphrey Bogart found himself in an octopusâ€™s garden in â€œIsle of Fury,â€ a potboiler set in the South Seas. Thatâ€™s right. Bogie battled an octopus. (Click here to read more about it.) The octopus fight in â€œBeneath the 12-Mile Reefâ€ has more creepy atmosphere (thanks to Herrmannâ€™s music) than action, but it qualifies.\n\nTwilight Timesâ€™ limited edition Blu-ray is a gem. The 1080p High Definition /2.55:1 is practically flawless, rich in detail and color (color by Technicolor). The audio is 5.1 Dolby, and the old four-track recording system used in those days provides an ambient, highly-directional sound stage. The special features provided by Twilight Time are an audio track for listening to Herrmannâ€™s luscious score separately, a documentary on Robert Wagner and informative liner notes by Julie Kirgo provided in a booklet that comes with the disc. And did I mention itâ€™s got an octopus? Recommended.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER\n\nJohn M. Whalen is the author of \"Hunting Monsters is My Business: The Mordecai Slate Stories\" .
