        "text": "575\n\nWelcome to paradise–not.\n\nLast month, Horror News Network reported that RLJE Films and Shudder teamed up to bring The Reef: Stalked to theaters and the streamer July 29, and now a trailer and poster have dropped to keep horror fans from dangling their feet in the water this summer. Check out the video–courtesy of firstshowing.net–on this page.\n\nThe deep-sea horror film– a sequel to 2010’s The Reef and a return for writer/director Andrew Traucki–follows Nic (Teressa Liane), who travels to a tropical resort with friends for a kayaking and diving adventure “in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder,” according to the synopsis.\n\nOf course, things go way wrong soon into the vacation, as the women “are stalked and attacked by a great white shark. To survive, they must band together–and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.” Really?\n\nThe film also stars Ann Truong (Cowboy Bebop), Saskia Archer (Ghosted), Kate Lister (Unhinged) and Tim Ross (Harrow).\n\nThe original The Reef–praised for its real-life shark footage–was a hit at the box office, raking in $4 million on a budget of just $125,000.\n\nKeep reading Horror News Network for any further updates on The Reef: Stalked."
