        "text": "The Reef (Shark Bait: The Reef in the UK, Australia and North America, Pi's Story in South Korea) is a 2006 South Korean-Canadian-American computer animated film. The plot revolves around Pi and his attempt to win the heart of Cordelia while dealing with a tiger shark that is terrorizing him and the reef's inhabitants. The film was a critical and commercial failure. It was largely criticised for borrowing heavily and ripping off from other films such as Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo, DreamWorks' Shark Tale and despite the talented actors and comedians involved in the voiceover work, was a box-office bomb.\n\nA direct-to-DVD sequel, The Reef 2: High Tide was released in 2012.\n\nPlot[]\n\nPi (Freddie Prinze Jr.) lives in a part of the ocean that is controlled by big and powerful sharks who prey on the fearful. After he suffers a great loss, Pi moves to a new town to start over and he falls in love with a beautiful fish named Cordelia (Evan Rachel Wood), angering the local shark bully who has a thing for her. Pi barely escapes becoming a snack and sets out to learn as much as he can about the reef with his cousin Dylan (Andy Dick) and when he is ready, he returns for a showdown."
