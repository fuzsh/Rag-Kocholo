        "text": "A Lackluster Sequel That Takes No Risks\n\nUnlike a majority of the press, I was in the minority who actually found the original The Reef (which was based on a 2006 South Korea film, Shark Bait) enjoyable. Maybe because even the major studios haven’t fully convinced me that underwater CG films are their strongest (Pixar’s Finding Nemo and DreamWorks’ Shark Tale for example) or maybe it’s because the grade B attempts (Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer, Sea Level & Legend of the Sea to mention a few) have demonstrated just how bad it can get… All I can say is that considering Shark Bait wasn’t even designed to be a North American release, the finished product that was The Reef managed to deliver.\n\nThe Reef 2: High Tide went about things a little bit differently: This time it wasn’t just an English script dubbed atop a foreign film but rather a piece designed from the onset to serve as a direct sequel to The Reef. It was animated again in South Korea and released to American audiences in October of 2012.\n\nThe film makes a rather unfortunate assumption that you’ve seen The Reef and are quite familiar with the events that unfolded. If you are not, the rather straight forward narrative and flow of this one is easy enough for even a young child to follow though do expect many references to events that took place in the original.\n\nAt its core The Reef 2 is simply a revenge story. The bully shark of the original film (who gets his tail handed to him in the end) decides it’s time to pay back the occupants of the reef; particularly the small fish Pi who gave him the business.\n\nOddly enough, though rumors abound that suggest the sequel had a bigger budget than the original film, a majority of the solid vocal cast was swapped out this time around. Gone is Freddy Prinze Jr. as Pi and in his place Drake Bell, Evan Rachel Wood goes bye-bye for Busy Phillips as Cordelia, Fran Drescher gets replaced by an impersonator for the role of Pearl and John Rhys-Davies is MIA entirely. Fortunately Donal Logue returns as the villainous shark Troy as does Andy Dick as a bit part and Rob Schneider as the wise (and surprisingly non-comedic) sage sea-turtle Nerissa. About the biggest disappointment comes in the form of new character Ronny as Jamie Kennedy seems to have been determined to create the most annoying voice humanly possible for the character.\n\nPacing is pretty decent and kids will surely delight in the beautiful color pallet. The film’s textures look surprisingly decent, especially on the high definition Blu version. Parents should certainly appreciate the fact that there is a (oft times heavy handed) lesson present and the values of team work, believing in one’s self and smaller doesn’t necessarily mean weaker are all reoccurring themes here.\n\nAdults expecting the type of cleverness studios like Pixar have been spoiling us with for the past 20-years will be slightly disappointed with the fairly straight forward nature of the plot. To put it another way, The Reef 2 doesn’t really commit any major crimes of storytelling so much as it doesn’t present anything particularly new or thought-provoking to the formula either. The producers of this one were clearly interested in playing it safe and simply continuing on with the dynamic established in the first film rather than getting fancy and risking failure.\n\nIn all kids will likely enjoy this colorful romp and decent vocal performance. The plot, though predictable and formulaic, is certainly passable and may even elicit a smile or two from the adults being forced to watch it over and over. IMDB users collectively rated the first film a 4.2 (out of ten) and this a 3.0 at the time of the writing of this review. Perhaps a bit harsh, the comparison is fairly indicative of the lack of originality or cleverness found in this one. In short you can do better if a good CG romp is in order but as I attest in the beginning of this review, you can certainly do worse!\n\nStronger of the Indie Underwater CG Pieces\n\nA very good argument could be made that of all the genres of computer generated feature film, none are as popular as the underwater/ talking fish angle. Sure you’ve heard of Finding Nemo and maybe Shark Tale but what about Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer, Legend of the Sea, Sea Level, A Turtle Tale: Sammy’s Adventure or this, The Reef? I can’t say I’ve made it through all of the “Grade B” underwater titles mentioned above, I can safely state that The Reef may be the strongest of the lot and contrary to common belief, not just because the others are so bad.\n\nFor starters The Reef isn’t your average second-rate CG feature right from the get-go just in the fact that it is an original American film (co-produced by South Korean animators) rather than the much more common (and annoying) trend of importing a foreign CG film and slapping a hackneyed English script atop the mismatched mouth flaps.\n\nAdditionally, The Reef is unique in that though it was designed right from the get-go for an American release, it never made the big-screen rounds; instead arriving as a direct-to-dvd piece back in 2007. Obviously this tells us not to expect inflated budget Pixar magic right out of the gate, but even with a modest bankroll and limited distribution, The Reef manages to succeed on many levels.\n\nThe story certainly won’t dazzle in terms of originality, but it’s decent enough to carry the film: Pi (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), lives happily with his parents in the heavily polluted waters of Boston Harbor, until a boat harvests many of the area fish in a net. Pi’s parents manage to help him escape the net, but cannot themselves get free. Orphaned, Pi is then taken in by some kindhearted porpoises and escorted to the distant reef where he is to stay with his aunt Pearl (Fran Drescher) and cousin Dylan (Andy Dick).\n\nWith a much richer color pallet and rapid decrease in pollution, Pi’s new home looks like the type of place for a fish to kick back until Cordelia (Evan Rachel Wood) comes into the picture. A model with her eye on the Pi, things could be reef-tastic for these two fishies if not for Troy (Donal Logue), a slightly unstable tiger shark who not only gets his kicks tormenting everyone on the reef, but is also scheming on Cordelia himself.\n\nFortunately Pi learns about Nerissa (Rob Schneider), a reclusive wise old turtle who dwells in the wreck of an old pirate ship. Under Nerissa’s tutelage, Pi hopes to win over Cordelia without becoming shark bait in the process.\n\nSo while this certainly feels like “been there, done that” territory, The Reef is surprisingly solid thanks to a script laced with humor and just enough cleverness to appeal to the adults while the little-ones clamor to the bright colors and crisp visuals. The cast, which on paper looks like a virtual train wreck (I mean Andy Dick and Fran Drescher in the same film… with Freddie Prinze Jr in the lead? Eeks!), manages to bring a surprisingly enjoyable flavor to the formula. Prinze delivers his least monotone repertoire to date and Donal Logue brings a wonderful bully to the character of Troy with hints of early Travolta thrown in for good measure. A perfectly cast John Rhys-Davies handles both narration duty as well as brings his A-game to the role of the tale-telling walrus Thorton and the character’s name eludes me now but the simple-minded eel lackey of Troy’s who comes off as a subdued Christopher Walken is especially memorable.\n\nI have noticed many critics slam The Reef for its lack of originality and there is some validity to such concerns but to my way of thinking, treading proven ground is far more forgivable than creating an original film that stinks of its own volition (watch Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer for more on this phenomenon).\n\nIn closing my research for this review has revealed Weinstein Company’s plans of releasing a sequel to this film for 2012 (The Reef 2: High Tide)- proof that occasionally films with more heart than budget get recognized for what they are."
