        "text": "Australian filmmaker Andrew Traucki is back in the water, and you better be afraid, with The Reef: Stalked set to be released later this year.\n\nFollowing his sequel to Black Water (last year’s Black Water: Abyss) Traucki is back with more shark action with a follow up to his 2010 nerve shredder The Reef.\n\nIn an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, Nic, her sister Annie and two close friends travel to a remote Pacific island for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a massive Great White.\n\nTo survive the women will need to band together, and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay a monster.\n\nHere’s what Andrew could tell us about the project –\n\nTell us when you first considered doing a follow-up to The Reef?\n\nWell I never thought I’d do another shark film, you know done that what’s next, but then I had a thought that I really liked, one that for me elevated this film to a higher level and once I had that thought in my head the challenge was irresistible I had to write this script! That was in 2017.\n\nDid the experience on Black Water Abyss give you more motivation to revisit another of your previous films?\n\nIt kind of did, you known I have lots of other projects one of my favourite being Melodica Vampire Slayers, think Spinal Tap meets Dracula, it’s a horror comedy. Although everyone loves the script I can’t seem to get it financed because it’s cast dependent. But BWA should that there seems to be a market for my animal survival thrillers, so yeah that was motivating.\n\nWhy do you think audiences love shark films so much?\n\nIt’s in our genes, from way back when animals still ate us on a more regular basis, the fear of being eaten alive is deeply imprinted in our genes. Plus anyone who goes in the sea, and that’s most of Australia can possibly encounter a huge fish that might eat you ie a shark, so although it’s highly unlikely they still pose a threat well at least in people’s minds\n\nThe approach in The Reef of using real shark footage made for some incredibly intense scenes, is this also the plan for Stalked?\n\nYep, I like a realistic “villian” and you can’t get more realistic than using the real animal.\n\nWas there any real-life inspiration for the script you wrote?\n\nNot directly but the sinister fact that on average one woman a week dies in Australia due to domestic violence was one of the inspirations for writing the script (you’ll have to see the film to find out what that really means)\n\nWhat can you tell us about the shoot?\n\nIt’s in water- it’s going to be hell\n\nHow do you compare making The Reef and Stalked?\n\nWell they are both in water so they’re both going to be difficult, but yeah I haven’t shot Stalked yet so I’ll let you know after I’ve done it\n\nIs the plan for a Summer 2021 release?\n\nI think so you need to talk to the distributors\n\nWhat is your next project following The Reef: Stalked?\n\nMelodica Vampire Slayers would be fun but I also have a several other scripts I’d like to make.\n\nLook out for The Reef: Stalked later in 2021."
