        "text": "Andrew Traucki’s The Reef is one of the best shark attack horror movies ever made, a simple tale of friends stranded in shark-infested waters that’s made all the more terrifying due to Traucki’s insistence on using real sharks rather than animatronic or computer-generated ones.\n\nThis summer, a brand new sequel titled The Reef: Stalked is swimming to theaters, VOD and Shudder on July 29, and with that, we have an exclusive look at images from the film that turns a great white shark into a stalker.\n\nIn the sequel…\n\n“Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”\n\nWritten and directed by Andrew Traucki (Black Water) as a follow up to his 2010 film, The Reef: Stalked stars Teressa Liane (“The Vampire Diaries”), Ann Truong (“Cowboy Bebop”), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (“Clickbait”) and Tim Ross (“Wonderland”).\n\nAhead of writer/director Aviv Rubinstien’s Lizzie Lazarus debuting at Popcorn Frights this weekend comes a new poster with an ominous tagline.\n\nCheck out the new poster below from artists Kaitlin Ronduen and Travis Neal.\n\nAbout Lizzie Lazarus: “Summer Solstice, 1990, two strangers carry a corpse through the woods looking for a mythical zone they believe will bring the dead body back to life. But what secrets will come back with it?”\n\nIt’s the type of setup that instantly calls Jud Crandall’s warning from Pet Sematary to mind: Sometimes dead is better.\n\nThe film stars Omar Maskati and Lianne O’Shea.\n\nFilmmaker Aviv Rubinstien said in a statement, “This film was a labor of love born out of getting a little ‘cabin fever’ in covid and reevaluating all of my life decisions. What Lianne (O’Shea, who plays Bethany) and I developed was a story about grief, loss, and guilt, cults and witches, and the question of how far you’d go to bring someone you loved back from the dead. We set it in 1990, not just because that was the year of a real occult disappearance on the summer solstice, but we wanted to pay homage to 90s independent films that take place all in one night, like Before Sunrise, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and Gerry (which is 2002 but you get the picture!) with a Wicker Man twist.”\n\nLizzie Lazarus is set to premiere at the festival in person on August 11 and virtually."
