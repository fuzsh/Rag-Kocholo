I ask for some privacy at this time to grieve and to wrap my head around this turn of events, and this surreal loss.\" As of this writing, no cause of death has been announced, but the Worcester newspaper \"Telegram & Gazette\" reported that \"freezing temperatures, a malfunctioning furnace, a temporary space heater and a home in need of repairs may have contributed to the deaths.\"\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nWitt won a Special Jury Recognition award at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival and a Best Actress award at the 1995 Gijón International Film Festival for \"Fun.\" The film also earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance.
