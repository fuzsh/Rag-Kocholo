        "text": "This logo was inspired by the hologram stickers that was used on most VHS releases from MGM before this logo came out.\n\nSometimes, this logo is absent either at the beginning or end of tapes.\n\nStarting in 2003, this logo is only seen at the end of tapes.\n\nVariants:\n\n1989-1992 releases show the copyright stamp in a slightly different font, arranged to the left.\n\nSome late '90's-2000 releases had a screen freeze of this logo.\n\nThe beginning of the U.S. VHS of Tea With Mussolini has the logo almost entirely freeze-framed and only starts moving three seconds before it cuts to black!\n\nOn the 1992 VHS of Fiddler on the Roof, this logo used a 1992 copyright at the beginning of the tape, but a 1990 copyright at the end of the tape. Fiddler on the Roof was probably released on videocassette originally in 1990; when they reprinted it in 1992, they changed the copyright info at the beginning, but they forgot to change the copyright info at the end.\n\nThe size of the logo and the color changing arrangements varies.\n\nOn rare releases, there's a rare extended version (with the ending part in place either at the beginning or end of the tapes) where we see the colors: rose pink, golden yellow, violet, and navy blue in place.\n\nFX/SFX: The changing colors, and the scrolling of the \"MGM/UA HOME VIDEO\" text.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nAvailability: Common. It can be seen on MGM/UA movies of the VHS era (excluding LaserDiscs) at both beginning and end of their videos such as All Dogs Go to Heaven and all the 007 VHS releases of the era. However, starting later in 2003, it was only used at the end of tapes. One of the first tapes to use this logo was the original VHS release of Leviathan, and some of the last tapes to use this logo were the 2005 VHS releases of Be Cool, Hotel Rwanda, and Beauty Shop.\n\nEditor's Note: For some reason, there was never a copyright stamp with the years 1991, 1994, or 2005 on it. 1991 VHS tapes had the 1990 copyright stamp, 1994 VHS tapes had the 1993 copyright stamp, and 2005 VHS tapes had the 2004 copyright stamp. Plus it's weird that this was used into the MGM Home Entertainment days, with the name changes.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(August 4, 1993-January 27, 1998)\n\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Home Video (Opening, DVD Quality)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/St9w1s1se4Wyu5xz7E0lJA261316/GW200H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Home Video (Opening, DVD Quality)\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993) Laserdisc Quality\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/f5cd2d28b0653251f6d213dc7c5638e5/GW202H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993) Laserdisc Quality\" width=\"202\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Home Video (Closing, DVD Quality)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/uD6QW5dwJyjEdSiCqN_43Q356208/GW200H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Home Video (Closing, DVD Quality)\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993, Closing) Laserdisc Quality\" height=\"149\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/f5d0f0880fd259c1ae61d8acef1cc304/GW202H149\" title=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993, Closing) Laserdisc Quality\" width=\"202\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Presents (1995)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/23a2a40c03ebd84f37fdcb74b213eaf3/GW198H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Presents (1995)\" width=\"198\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM Greats (Late '90s)\" height=\"149\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/94d4d6f74ded36b664555e002e91a890/GW198H149\" title=\"MGM Greats (Late '90s)\" width=\"198\"/>\n\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Coming Soon To A Theater Near You Bumper (1993)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/_bABPaUYooUELpfpWu1K3A351607/GW200H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Coming Soon To A Theater Near You Bumper (1993)\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo (Now Playing at a Theater Near You)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d1b55ff38f6d821386dab789cdd6f47c/GW200H150\" title=\"1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo (Now Playing at a Theater Near You)\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Now Available On Videocassette\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/AkRBjTCxxuy5gokV-xPGLA229254/GW200H150\" title=\"MGM/UA Now Available On Videocassette\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo (Coming Soon on Videocassette)\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/7eb586b4ca2dc7e166b7b517059abaeb/GW200H150\" title=\"1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo (Coming Soon on Videocassette)\" width=\"200\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993, Theatrical Trailer) DVD Quality\" height=\"151\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/bab74ae89bb9a683d21f4a6a5ad67266/GW204H151\" title=\"MGM/UA Home Video (1993, Theatrical Trailer) DVD Quality\" width=\"204\"/>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"134\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/5004912df2e9b05f83913f79809c3be37cd0eb0c\" width=\"240\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"134\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/832dbe640be22175e293252e7f9c575eb3d51bc5\" width=\"240\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"134\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/6908e181e4e72ce860fd8e8bc5bd930ac75de2dd\" width=\"240\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"135\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/954c5a5e609763ccf5bb21afb8f6bca76e1202df\" width=\"240\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion IV\", \"Gold Leo the Lion\", \"The Rollercoaster Filmstrip\", \"Gold Ribboning IV\", \"CGI Gold Ribboning\", \"MGM/UA Roaring Lion II\"\n\nLogo:\n\nOpening: On a black background, a golden 3D CGI filmstrip swerves in the screen, and the camera pans down, around, and then upwards on it in a rollercoaster-style fashion. While panning upwards, the 1928 MGM logo with Jackie the Lion slowly fades onto the frames of the filmstrip, as Jackie roars once. Blue rays suddenly appear around the filmstrip, and it then suddenly pans down, revealing the then-current MGM logo, redone in a lusher, CGI style (including the drama mask with the reef surrounding it) with Leo the Lion in it. The blue light rays are all around the logo's ribboning, and the \"Metro Goldwyn Mayer\" and \"TRADE MARK\" texts are still intact around it all, as well as the \"(R)\" symbol, (this time, in yellow gradient coloring). The logo turns and zooms out as the light rays dim out. As the logo makes its way to its normal position and when Leo roars the second time, the logo flashes, causing Leo and the drama mask to turn gold, and the texts around him and the reef to dissolve into dust. The dark blue letters of \"MGM/UA\" then rotate letter-by-letter underneath Leo, followed by a blue line, and then \"HOME VIDEO\" in Century Gothic. The entire logo then shines.\n\nClosing: The completed logo, with Leo in it, the drama mask already in gold, and without the text, flies in from the left side of the screen with the light rays all around it. After making its way onto the screen, the words \"MGM/UA HOME VIDEO\", line and all, animate in the same style as the opening variant. Leo roars throughout the variant and does not turn gold.\n\nVariant:\n\nOn several earlier DVDs with the logo, the DVD quality version has a minor VHS-like graphical glitch on the left seen on part of the filmstrip animation with the 1928 MGM logo. The Laserdisc quality, which is also seen on some DVDs, has this cropped off and re-positioned a little. Other minor changes to these from the original DVD quality has the opening logo brightened and the sharpness of the logos are minorly fuzzy. The closing and the trailer logo do not have the minor color re-adjustment, but they were re-positioned.\n\nAt the end of The Pebble and the Penguin, the logo cuts to black near the end before it fades out.\n\nOn MGM Greats releases, after the sparkle effects fade out, the words \"MGM GREATS\", in red, wipe in (instead of the normal \"MGM/UA HOME VIDEO\" text) without the spotlight gradient effect. It has been spotted on a 2001 UK VHS of The Great Escape. The logo also fades out slower than usual at the end.\n\nOn an infomercial for James Bond which was broadcast on KLGT-TV 23 in 1995, the specular highlights for \"MGM/UA\" were lightened up, and \"Presents\" fades in instead of the home video text that is normally in place. Also, the logo doesn't shine.\n\nTrivia:\n\nOn the 1999 VHS release of National Velvet, this logo comes after the MGM Home Entertainment logo at the beginning of the tape. Likely a a result of MGM forgetting to erase the logo when making new masters.\n\nOn the 1996 VHS release of Rocky, both the opening and closing variations of this appear at the beginning of the tape. The opening variation appears before the previews, while the closing variation appears after the previews.\n\nTrailer Variants: There is a bumper that precedes trailers with a still of the end logo, replacing \"HOME VIDEO\" with one of these below:\n\nCOMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU\n\nNOW PLAYING AT A THEATER NEAR YOU\n\nNOW AVAILABLE ON VIDEOCASSETTE\n\nCOMING SOON ON VIDEOCASSETTE\n\nTHEATRICAL TRAILER\n\nFX/SFX: The zooming ribbon and pan outs. A big improvement over the first logo done in quite advanced CGI for the time.\n\nMusic/Sounds: An orchestral fanfare based off the opening theme of The Wizard of Oz, which starts dramatically and then ends in a majestic fashion. During the fanfare, we hear Tanner's roar, and then Leo's 1985 roar. The closing variant has a shortened version of the opening fanfare's ending.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant:\n\nOn the retail VHS release of The Pebble and the Penguin, the fanfare has weird stereo mixing due to a video processing error.\n\nA different version, with completely different music and different roars, is seen on Mexican Spanish tapes until 2000-2001.\n\nAvailability: Common. It debuted with the August 1993 home video release of Untamed Heart, and can be found on VHS and Laserdisc releases of this era, such as The Pebble and the Penguin, Get Shorty, All Dogs Go to Heaven 2, and the 1996 release of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. Earlier DVD releases also have this logo such as Red Dawn (which has the MGM Home Entertainment logo on the cover), The Wizard of Oz, Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky IV, The Black Stallion, Leaving Las Vegas, Rob Roy, GoldenEye, A Christmas Story and Poltergeist. It is also seen on UK releases until at least 2002, on titles such as Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Child's Play. Even though this logo officially ended in 1998 with the DVD releases of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Moonraker, Hoodlum, and the aforementioned Leaving Las Vegas and Red Dawn, the trailer bumpers were still used into the MGM Home Entertainment days, and the logo itself made a surprise appearances on the 1999 VHS releases of When Harry Met Sally..., National Velvet, The Cutting Edge, and Moonstruck. Also seen on The Golden Age of Looney Tunes on Laserdisc. The closing variant makes a surprise appearance at the end of a behind the scenes featurette on the 2000 DVD of Spaceballs (this was likely sourced from a 1996 Special Edition Laserdisc release).\n\nEditor's Note: The CGI animation, Wizard of Oz music and paying homage to the classical era by including Jackie definitely makes this a candidate for one of the best video logos of all time.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nMGM Home Entertainment\n\n(January 27, 1998-2005, still used in South Pacific Asia)\n\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM Home Entertainment late 90's\" height=\"157\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/BbDI48Qwz5lmi6q5wYcoZg24167/GW210H157\" title=\"MGM Home Entertainment late 90's\" width=\"210\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM Home Entertainment (1998, DVD Quality)\" height=\"157\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/rMrsgWSE8dtpG8dStuiMhw266466/GW210H157\" title=\"MGM Home Entertainment (1998, DVD Quality)\" width=\"210\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM Home Entertainment: 2000\" height=\"157\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/8XW7zup5DMH2Pqg4kR_Tnw26023/GW210H157\" title=\"MGM Home Entertainment: 2000\" width=\"210\"/>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"167\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/23ac62fb462105082f0f4c8f8490a52b697fd1ec\" width=\"207\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion V\", \"Gold Ribboning V\"\n\nLogo: Just the standard MGM logo of the time with Leo the Lion roaring. Underneath the logo are the words HOME ENTERTAINMENT in Trajan Pro which are separated by two lines.\n\nClosing Variant: At the end of the animated feature Tom Sawyer, a still image of the MGM logo scrolls up and the text \"HOME ENTERTAINMENT\" is shown below the logo in a white Roman text. Strangely, the lion is not in its correct still image.\n\nFX/SFX: Leo the Lion roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The 1995 lion roar.\n\nAvailability: Found primarily on VHS releases, VCDs and later Laserdiscs such as the Special Edition Laserdisc of The Spy Who Loved Me, as well as on the 2000 VHS of Never Say Never Again (despite no MGM logo appearing on the packaging). One of the first releases to use this logo was the 1998 VHS of 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (the demo VHS used the 1990 Orion Home Video logo). This makes a strange appearance on the TV spots for Platoon on its 2001 MGM DVD. Doesn't appear on the 1998 THX remastered Laserdisc of Singin' in the Rain, despite showing the print logo on the cover. Some of the last uses of this logo, like the 3rd logo, were the 2005 VHS releases of Be Cool, Hotel Rwanda, and Beauty Shop. Strangely enough, VCDs released in Asia still use this logo.\n\nEditor's Note: It's generally considered a letdown, especially considering the effort of the 1st and 4th MGM/UA logos, since this is just the plain old MGM logo with a Home Entertainment suffix below.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nMGM DVD\n\nBackground: MGM DVD is the DVD brand from MGM Home Entertainment.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(1998-2003, 2005, 2012)\n\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM DVD (2003, fullscreen)\" height=\"172\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/ZQP0scczyd3BNTxg3XoQ6A46416/GW230H172\" title=\"MGM DVD (2003, fullscreen)\" width=\"230\"/><img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM DVD (2003, Widescreen)\" height=\"172\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/oiUsjIb12lrdyr0OF4uwTQ13863/GW306H172\" title=\"MGM DVD (2003, Widescreen)\" width=\"306\"/>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"165\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/08237d6c6b2f99545e9c4961eb15cf482f5074b7\" width=\"294\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion VI\", \"Loud Lion\", \"Gold Ribboning VI\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a red oval rotates onto the screen. A small red circle with the MGM logo in it fades in, and we hear Leo roaring loudly in it. The golden letters \"MGM DVD\" zoom out onto the oval one-by-one. The oval and circle disappear in a flash of light, and the remaining text move closer to each other.FX/SFX: The lion roars once. As the logo fades out, the lion's growling can be heard.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A whoosh and a different but very loud roar sound effect. 6 cello notes are heard as the letters come in, as well as an orchestral hit at the end, and synth chimes.\n\nAvailability: Common. Seen on all 1998-2003 MGM Home Entertainment DVDs such as Overboard, UHF, Fluke, The Care Bears Movie, Legally Blonde, Spaceballs, Mr. Mom, The Terminator, The Secret of NIMH, SpaceCamp, It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas and the Rocky 25th Anniversary DVD box set. This is also seen on the 2012 James Bond 50th anniversary box set, and also makes a surprise appearance on the 2005 DVD of The Last Waltz.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(2003- )\n\n<img align=\"bottom\" alt=\"MGM DVD (2003, Widescreen)\" height=\"167\" src=\"http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/zaJQV3HtBK8B6QQrsCX2kQ131520/GW299H167\" title=\"MGM DVD (2003, Widescreen)\" width=\"299\"/><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"167\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/eabf3d56117a67ca0dd2a907a36c2da7da221217\" width=\"297\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion VII\", \"CGI MGM DVD\", \"Gold Ribboning VII\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a flash of light emerges from the screen and circles showing clips from MGM-owned movies (in order: Pierce Brosnan from GoldenEye, the titular characters of Thelma & Louise, Raymond and Charlie Babbitt from Rain Man, Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs, Steve McQueen's motorcycle jump from The Great Escape, Marilyn Monroe from Some Like It Hot, Willem Dafoe's death scene from Platoon, Frances McDormand from Fargo, Reese Witherspoon from Legally Blonde and Rocky's victory pose after running up the steps in Rocky) fly toward us. As the last circle flies towards us, two golden rings appear in the center rotating and collapse into the MGM DVD logo (in gray), surrounded by a red aura and a yellow outline. Leo roars once in it, and after that, the logo quickly zooms into the screen before cutting to black.\n\nFX/SFX: Clips of MGM-owned films flying, Leo roaring, and the logo zooming.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A commanding orchestral fanfare ending with a triumphant finish, which is a snippet of the stock musical piece \"Ultimate Glory\" by Anthony DiLorenzo. The appearance of the MGM logo is marked with a loud explosion sound, and the 1995 roar is heard when Leo is seen."
