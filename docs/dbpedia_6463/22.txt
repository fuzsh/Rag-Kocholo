The Gawler Central line is a suburban commuter line in the city of Adelaide, South Australia.

History

The Gawler Central line was constructed in 1857-58 to connect the new colony of Adelaide with copper resources at Kapunda and Burra, as well as to provide passenger and freight services to the new Town of Gawler. Originally running through rural land, the route developed over many years into the commuter route of today.

When delivering the 2008 South Australian State Budget, Treasurer Kevin Foley announced a $116 million dollar plan to re-sleeper the Gawler line as part of the Governments 10 year $2 billion plan to revitalise Adelaide's public transport network. The line would then be electrified later in the next decade. This was in addition to plans for the electrification of the Outer Harbor and Noarlunga rail corridors and the extension of the Glenelg Tramline.

Route

The line runs from the Adelaide Railway Station north via the suburbs of Mawson Lakes, Salisbury, Elizabeth and Smithfield to the satellite city of Gawler on the outer northern metropolitan fringe. The line is approx 42.2 kilometres in length and is currently the longest of the Adelaide suburban railway lines.

Like the rest of the Adelaide Network, the line is broad gauge (1600mm) for its entire length. The ARTC mainline (standard gauge) runs parallel to the route from the Gaol Loop as far as Salisbury, then divulging north west towards Virginia and Two Wells.

Services

All suburban passenger services are provided by TransAdelaide and the average service takes about 50 minutes to run the entire length.
