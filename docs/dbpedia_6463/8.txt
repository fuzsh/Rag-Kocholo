TransAdelaide will decide today if a pay dispute affecting maintenance workers should go to arbitration.

The Electrical Trades Union has asked that the Fair Work tribunal get involved.

The union says it is prepared to call off a strike planned for Thursday.

Union official Simon Pisoni says workers want their wages moved into line with state public servants.

"Negotiations have been going since August 2008. We agreed that the offer that TransAdelaide was willing to make could go to the vote. It was voted down 35 to 13," he said.
