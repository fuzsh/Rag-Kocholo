Tonsley railway station is the terminus railway station on the Tonsley railway line, which is located in the southwestern Adelaide suburb of Mitchell Park. It is located 13.0km by railway from the Adelaide Railway Station. There is a small toilet facility but it has been locked for a few years due to the lack of patronage.

Trains operate hourly Monday to Friday only. It branches off the Noarlunga Centre line at Woodlands Park on to a single track to Tonsley.
