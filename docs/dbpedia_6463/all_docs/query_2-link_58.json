Originally running through rural land, the route developed over many years into the commuter route of today.\n\nWhen delivering the 2008 South Australian State Budget, Treasurer Kevin Foley announced a $116 million dollar plan to re-sleeper the Gawler line as part of the Governments 10 year $2 billion plan to revitalise Adelaide's public transport network. The line would then be electrified later in the next decade. This was in addition to plans for the electrification of the Outer Harbor and Noarlunga rail corridors and the extension of the Glenelg Tramline.

The line is approx 42.2 kilometres in length and is currently the longest of the Adelaide suburban railway lines.\n\nLike the rest of the Adelaide Network, the line is broad gauge (1600mm) for its entire length. The ARTC mainline (standard gauge) runs parallel to the route from the Gaol Loop as far as Salisbury, then divulging north west towards Virginia and Two Wells.\n\nServices\n\nAll suburban passenger services are provided by TransAdelaide and the average service takes about 50 minutes to run the entire length."
