        "text": "Location: Metro Adelaide\n\nJust 8 kilometres from Adelaide, in the most attractive part of the Adelaide foothills, sit two old tunnels, which have had pasts as colourful and romantic as any ancient monument in the history of South Australia.\n\nSleep’s Hill Tunnels & Viaducts – An Adelaide Engineering Feat (1879 – 1914)\n\nThe building of the Adelaide-to-Melbourne railway line, of which the tunnels and 31m high viaduct were an integral part, was heralded as one of the greatest achievements of South Australia at the time.\n\nThe first part of the hills line to Aldgate commenced construction in 1879 and included the building of two viaducts and eight tunnels.\n\nThe Sleep’s Hill Viaducts comprised two sections, one being 92m long and 23m high, while the other was 90m long and 31m high.\n\nThe tunnels at Sleep’s Hill were constructed 5m high and 4.5m wide with sandstone arches & piers and infilled with red brick. The longest tunnel of 377m (Tunnel No. 2) sits at the brink of the viaducts, while a 193m shorter tunnel (Tunnel No. 1) sits half a kilometre to the north.\n\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century, the South Australian Railways and the Victorian Railways were extended. The Adelaide line was extended from Wolseley and connected into the Victorian system at Serviceton in 1887. It became the first inter-colonial railway link in Australia.\n\nMost of the traffic is freight but twice a week the well-known passenger service The Overland takes passengers to and from Adelaide and Melbourne.\n\nThe line continued to give satisfactory service until ~1914 when heavier engines began to be used. It was felt that the viaduct at the mouth of tunnel No. 2 would not support the increased weight.\n\nAbandoned (1919 — ~1932)\n\nAfter World War 1, the old line was closed and the rails removed. The last train to ever use the tunnels was on August 11, 1919.\n\nThe two tunnels at Sleep’s Hill were superseded on 16 April 1919 when a wider tunnel was built a little to the east.\n\nThe viaducts were dismantled in June 1920.\n\nWhen the line became abandoned, the tunnels became an exploration area for locals. Each year thousands of hikers, picnickers, families and explorers visited the tunnels. School holidays saw children tripping through their dark interiors. Manholes, black with soot and cut at intervals along the tunnel walls were said to echo ghost sounds of 40 years of rumbling trains. (Source: The Advertiser, June 14, 1947)\n\n“When I was a kid … I used to play in one of the Sleep’s Hill tunnels. I remember walking through the tunnel … which was scary because it was so dark…” – Wayne Rosser\n\nWorld War II — Secret Storage Vault & Ammunition Bunker (1942 — 1945)\n\nAfter the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese early in 1942, the South Australian Government decided to take no chances and sort a likely hiding place for the states treasures. The Sleep’s Hill Tunnels suited perfectly.\n\nTunnel No. 1 was cleaned and drained. Electric lights were fitted along the arched roof and ventilators installed. Thick brick walls were built at the entrances and an iron door with security bars placed at the western end.\n\nUnder heavy security of the Defence Corps, truckloads of valuable State possessions were stacked onto specifically built jarrah platforms that ran the length of the tunnel. Newspapers dating from the first editions of South Australian journals (now out of existence), as well as valuable rare books from the Archives and Public Library were piled inside.\n\nAfter having ensured the tunnel was bomb-proof, the Art Gallery of South Australia sent priceless pictures from its early South Australian collection into the tunnel.\n\nThe priceless vice-regal treasures from Government House were also included.\n\nElaborate precautions were taken against fire and the interior was constantly patrolled for outbreaks of damp and pests.\n\nTunnel No. 2 became an arsenal storage facility holding shells and ammunition. It was kept secret and heavily guarded.\n\nMushroom Cultivation — S.A. Mushroom Company (1965 — 1992)\n\nAnn Spiel, using her savings and money from a land sale, purchased the faltering Panorama Mushroom Co. in December 1965, with her husband Craig, and partners Dirk & Mien Ravenstein. The Ravenstein’s walked out of the partnership at the end of 1968, and in 1969, with a new loan from the bank, Ann and Craig started a new company: S.A. Mushroom Co. Pty. Ltd.\n\nDuring January 1966 through to 1970 it proved difficult to grow mushrooms inside the tunnels – often crops would be decimated by disease. Through innovation and refining their techniques it wasn’t until 1970 that the business became financially successful.\n\nIn 1976, a stall was opened in the Central Market to sell mushrooms directly to customers.\n\nIn 1978, Craig and Ann’s son, Ron Spiel, took over the business and he started laying the foundations for the future. Ron expanded the business and by 1982, both tunnels were filled with mushrooms producing about 1.5 tonnes per week. S.A. Mushroom Co. had now become the second largest producer in the state."
