It is located 13.0km by railway from the Adelaide Railway Station. There is a small toilet facility but it has been locked for a few years due to the lack of patronage.\n\nTrains operate hourly Monday to Friday only. It branches off the Noarlunga Centre line at Woodlands Park on to a single track to Tonsley.\n\nReferences\n\nee also\n\n*List of Adelaide railway stations\n\n*List of suburban and commuter rail systems\n\n*Railways in Adelaide\n\nExternal links"
