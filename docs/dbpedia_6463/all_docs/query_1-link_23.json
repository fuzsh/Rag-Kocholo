The document discusses the rejuvenation of the Port Adelaide Viaduct in Adelaide, South Australia. The 95-year-old viaduct was in critical need of repair and upgrade work to extend its lifespan another 30 years. The project involved repairing structural steelwork, renewing corrosion protection, upgrading the track structure, and renovating Port Adelaide Station. A partnering approach was used to complete the work during a 5-month closure of the viaduct railway line. Major risks addressed included completing work on time and minimizing community disruption during construction.",
