        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nChapter Twelve Beyond Polish Moral Realism The Subversive Cinema of Andrzej Żuławski Michael Goddard Introduction: Żuławski versus Polish Realism When Andrzej Żuławski’s debut feature film, The Third Part of the Night (Trzecia część nocy, 1971) was released, it could only be received as a major scandal. Even in the relatively open and experimental context of “third generation” Polish cinema at the time, Żuławski’s film was an affront to the most “sacred” period of both Polish history and its cinematic representation—namely, the Polish experience of World War II. This was, of course, a preferred subject of Polish school filmmakers such as Andrzej Wajda and Andrzej Munk, whose representations of Polish martyrdom, whether romantically heroic or ironic, were no preparation for the delirious, brutal, and expressionist presentation of these events in Żuławski’s film. By the time of his third Polish feature, On the Silver Globe (Na srebrnym globie, 1977/1988), Żuławski could not have been further removed from the dominant tendencies toward realism evidenced by the Cinema of Moral Concern, of which he was a particularly severe critic.1 Eventually production was halted on the film and was only able to be resumed, in a truncated form, eleven years later. Meanwhile, the director had initiated another series of films made in France, beginning with L’important c’est d’aimer (The most important thing: Love, 1975), which, while aesthetically and contextually very different, nevertheless can be seen as a continuation and development of this critical escape in the necessarily transnational context of making films in another European country. This chapter will look at these two strands of Żuławski’s cinematic career as related attempts to escape the limits of “moral realism” via expressive excess and argue that from the start this trajectory had transnational dimensions. Even in the case of productions taking place entirely within Poland, the films of Żuławski can be productively seen in terms of “accented cinema,” to use Hamid Naficy’s term, in that they Beyond Polish Moral Realism 237 transgress the borders of Polish national cinema, even if this is as much in stylistic as geographical terms or refers as much to internal as external exile.2 This chapter will therefore examine key films of this director, both those made in Poland and those made abroad as strategies against and beyond the dominant aesthetic and political tendencies of Polish cinema. National and Transnational Dimensions of Żuławski’s Cinema Contextualizing the work of Andrzej Żuławski within Polish cinema is problematic. Recent attempts have tended to view his work through a variety of lenses including the Polish New Wave or surrealism, whereas critics at the time of his first films tended to see his as representative of the “third generation,” or “third Polish cinema.” The first generation were the immediate postwar filmmakers like Wanda Jakubowska and Aleksander Ford who embraced the prevailing doctrine of socialist realism; the second was the Polish school filmmakers like Wajda and Munk whose debuts took place in the 1950s; and filmmakers Jerzy Skolimowski, Krzysztof Zanussi, Żuławski, Witold Leszczyński, and others like them whose debuts were in the 1960s belonged to the third generation. Tadeusz Lubelski argues that these directors shared “a manifestation of the author’s identity and a tendency to poetic stylization.”3 However, such common traits are fairly vague and only point to the general idea of an auteurist art cinema, less obviously engaged with history or social issues than were earlier filmmakers. Nevertheless, the idea of “generations” is a persistent one in Polish cinema not only in terms of its filmmakers but as a cinematic theme beginning from Wajda’s debut feature, A Generation (Pokolenie, 1955). The fact that Third Part of the Night directly references both this film and, in its title, the idea of third Polish cinema, not to mention the idea of generations in its being based in part on Żuławski’s father’s memoirs, means that the idea of generations in and of Polish cinema cannot be easily dismissed. At the same time, it must be remembered that in addition to these national influences, there were already transnational dimensions of Żuławski’s career even prior to his making films outside of Poland that stemmed from his training at the French L’Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC) rather than the more usual route of the Polish film school. Even before his career began, therefore, there was already an aesthetic..."
