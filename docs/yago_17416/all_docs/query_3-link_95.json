But that all changes when a gorgeous stranger (Joanna Sienkiewicz) appears in town. She's a schoolteacher with plenty of modern ideas, which quickly take hold of Kaziuk -- who is more than a little smitten. Overcome by heated fantasies about the fetching newcomer, Kaziuk lashes out, defying hallowed cultural traditions. Coming out of the blue, his actions cause an uproar among the villagers.",
