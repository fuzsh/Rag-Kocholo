        "text": "18th Chopin and His Europe Festival\n\n14-31 August 2022\n\nWarsaw, Poland\n\nThe Year of Polish Romanticism\n\nThis year, there will be over 30 concerts, and among them piano recitals by masters of piano, including Bruce Liu, the winner of the 2021 Chopin Competition. World-famous orchestras and chamber players will give as many as 16 concerts. We did not forget about vocal music: outstanding soloists will perform with recitals, and opera lovers will be given opportunity to listen to the concert performance of Un giorno di regno, ossia il finto Stanislao by Giuseppe Verdi.\n\nProgramme of the Festivalin Detail\n\nhttps://festiwal.nifc.pl/en/2022/kalendarium/\n\nMost of the concerts of the Festival will be available to watch via free streams on the YouTube channel of The Fryderyk Chopin Institute. Selected concerts will also be broadcast by Polish Radio Channel 2 (Dwojka)\n\nThe programme book and extensive notes on musical works and musicological essays by renowned experts in the field is remarkable in itself.\n\nView of Warsaw from the Terrace of the Royal Castle by Bernardo Bellotto (1722-1780) called Canaletto from the collection of the National Museum. Photo: National Museum in Warsaw\n\nIntroduction to this Extraordinary Festival\n\nunique in its European scope\n\nby\n\nStanisław Leszczyński\n\nArtistic Director\n\nThe 18th Chopin and His Europe Festival will open with three great artists of Polish Romanticism: Chopin, Mickiewicz and Moniuszko. At the outset, we will hear Widma by Stanisław Moniuszko, a cantata which is a musical version of the second part of Dziady. It is a very clear gesture towards this epoch – rather special for our Polish culture and celebrated this year.\n\nThe work, created in the mid-19th century, is an example of the fascination with the text by Mickiewicz, the essence of the Polish interpretation of Romanticism, its realization in non-existing, but vivid national identity of Poles – both in Polish lands and in exile. It exemplifies force and longing, it brings mystery and an element of mysticism, originating from traditional ritualism. But primarily, Widma, tells a story of one of the iconic texts of Polish literature (and at the same time one of the most distinctive Polish Romantic texts) with great music. The work is a priceless treasure of Polish cultural heritage.\n\nIn August 2022 this work will be performed, together with another cantata by Moniuszko, Nijoła, under the baton of Fabio Biondi, who – fascinated by this composition – is shocked how Moniuszko remains a greatly underappreciated artist on international stages and in the concert halls of Europe. After the enthusiastic reception of his operas, he will perform and record Widma and Nijoła with the soloists of the Podlasie Opera and the Philharmonic Choir and the Europa Galante Orchestra.\n\nThere will be much more Moniuszko in the festival programme: we have planned two concerts with his songs, performed by Olga Pasiecznik with Ewa Pobłocka, Mariusz Godlewski with Radosław Kurek (both as part of the promotion of The Institute’s new records) and Dorothee Mields with Tobias Koch; a very interesting element connected with Moniuszko will be also present in the programme with the concerts by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, performing the Overture to Paria, and Sinfonia Varsovia, which is going to perform Moniuszko’s Pearls by Zygmunt Noskowski, i.e. symphonic orchestrations of Moniuszko’s songs.\n\nThe programme axis of the Festival is traditionally based on the music of Fryderyk Chopin whose work is the essence of Polish Romanticism, emotionally being its essence. His works will be performed by outstanding pianists and great ensembles on contemporary and historical instruments; there will be fascinating contexts as well. Etudes and Nocturnes will be interpreted by Jan Lisiecki, Preludes by Aimi Kobayashi, Bruce Liu will perform the ‘La ci darem la mano’ Variations from Don Giovanni, which were so enthusiastically reviewed during the Competition and – together with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton Vasily Petrenko – the Concerto in F minor Op.21. The Concerto in F minor Op.21will also be performed by Kate Liu, but also… for the first time in the version for guitar, by Mateusz Kowalski and the Collegium 1704 under Vaclav Luks. Cyprien Katsaris will present works by friends and pupils of Chopin together with extensive fragments of Don Giovanni by Mozart arranged by Bizet, recorded in a complete version for The Fryderyk Chopin Institute. We will also hear – performed by the Orchestra of the Polish National Philharmonic under the direction of Andrzej Boreyko – Fuego Fatuo by Manuel de Falla, a work for the stage entirely based on orchestrated music by Chopin. The piano concerto by Andrzej Panufnik will find a new interpretation by Alexander Gadjiev. The Beethoven Academy Orchestra under Jean-Luc Tingaud will perform works by E.T.A. Hoffmann, Cesar Franck and Feliks Nowowiejski. And these are only selected fragments of the rich programme…\n\nUndoubtedly, everyone – the audience as well as we, the organisers – is waiting for the performances of the most interesting personalities of last year’s Chopin Competition, the new elite of world pianism. In addition to the already mentioned winner Bruce Liu, Alexander Gadjiev and Aimi Kobayashi, there will be performances by Kyohei Sorita, Martin Garcia Garcia, Leonora Armellini, Jakub Kuszlik and J J Jun Li Bui – all with highly interesting programmes, featuring, in addition to Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, Debussy, Rameau, Liszt... We will also welcome the 2010 winner, Yulianna Avdeeva, and the talented Ukrainian pianist Dinara Klinton. Alim Beisembayev, the winner of last year’s piano competition in Leeds, will also perform – for the first time at the Festival.\n\nOther highlights of the Festival will certainly be the concerts by Maria Joao Pires (with the Basel Chamber Orchestra conducted by Trevor Pinnock) and the European Union Youth Orchestra conducted by Gianandrea Noseda and Francesco Piemontesi as well as performances by the Belcea Quartet (together and separately) and the Apollon Musagète Quartet...\n\nThe magical world of authentic sound and ‘historically informed’ musical interpretation will be brought to us this year by pianists Kristian Bezuidenhout, Tobias Koch, Dmitry Ablogin, Tomasz Ritter, Aleksandra Świgut, clarinetists long associated with the Festival: Lorenzo Coppola and Eric Hoeprich as well as violinists Alena Baeva and Chouchane Siranossian. Internationally renowned orchestras will play: our leading ensemble of historical performance, {oh!} Orkiestra Historyczna, Europa Galante, Collegium 1704 and – in a very special way – the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century, which has accompanied the Festival since its first edition. We will hear Henryk Wieniawski’s Concerto in F-sharp minor and Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major in its original version, with Jan Lisiecki sitting at the historic piano for the first time.\n\nAnd a few words about Polish music, especially one that is still little recognized, the best presentation of which is always our mission and a privilege at the same time. This year, the programme will focus on Polish Romanticism: Józef Władysław Krogulski’s Miserere (Collegium 1704), Karol Kurpiński’s Clarinet Concerto (reconstructed in a different way than last year, this time interpreted by Eric Hoeprich and The Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century), August Fryderyk Duranowski’s Violin Concerto and Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński’s Duo for Clarinet and Piano. There will also be Romantic music from Germany (Winterreise with Matthias Goerne and Leif Ove Andsnes), France (Gounod and Franck, whose 200th anniversary of his birth is celebrated this year), the Czech Republic (Reicha, Dvorak), Scandinavia (Sibelius) and England (Elgar).\n\nAs part of this year’s edition of the Festival, over 30 concerts are planned to take place in the most important halls of Warsaw. We hope that this time the pandemic will not limit the number of the viewers and listeners that we can invite for the events. Regardless, most of the concerts will be streamed and broadcast by Channel 2 of Polish Radio.\n\nThe Fryderyk Chopin Institute\n\nReviews\n\nPhotographs by Bartek Barczyk\n\nFinal Symphonic Concert of the Festival\n\nThe hall was excitedly overflowing to capacity on this much anticipated final concert\n\n31.08.22\n\nWednesday\n\n20:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPerformers:\n\nBruce (Xiaoyu) Liu piano\n\nVasily Petrenko conductor\n\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nProgram:\n\nStanisław Moniuszko (1819-1872)\n\nOverture to the opera \"Paria\" ('Pariah' - The Outcast)\n\nIn this performance of an outstanding Overture, the drama was highlighted from the outset. Petrenko is a visionary musician and presented us with passionate writing of anguished social exclusion. Solitary soloists played as if individual voices in the opera. However, I could not help reflecting on the complete absence of any Indian 'flavour' to the music! Charming solo passages, unashamedly cosmopolitan, followed depiction of the severe social drama and harassment of being deemed a 'pariah' in traditional Indian society. This faultless construction of the piece was clear from its ideal length and the balance maintained between drama and lyricism.\n\nI offer some insight into this fascinating but unaccountably neglected opera.\n\nThe year 2019 was the 200th anniversary of the birth of Stanisław Moniuszko (1819-1872), the greatest operatic composer in nineteenth century Poland. There were musical celebrations throughout country and the resuscitation of his long forgotten works in performance. The seemingly impossible dream of the independence of the country as a sovereign nation and accession to the European Union means that at last what one might term the 'Cultural Iron Curtain' has been split apart to reveal formerly unknown artistic treasures of this valiant nation to the wider European continent. In no domain has this been more obvious than in music, but also in art, architecture, theatre and literature. The Polish language does present a difficult barrier in a way that English, French and Italian do not in the West. This remark does not assume a forest of undiscovered composers of genius, but certainly many of enormous talent and significant musical gifts to augment the European musical canon.\n\nStanisław Moniuszko was born into a family of Polish landowners settled in Ubiel near Minsk in present day Belarus and showed the customary precociousness of genius. He studied composition and conducting with Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen in Berlin in 1837 and later worked as an organist in Vilnius. He traveled often to St. Petersburg where he met the great composers of the day (Glinka, Balakirev, and Mussorgsky) and also Weimar where he met Liszt and then Prague where he made the acquaintance of Smetana. His first recently discovered (2015) comic opera in two acts composed in Berlin was entitled Der Schweizerhütte (the Swiss Cottage).\n\nIn 1848 he visited Warsaw and met the writer, actor and director Jan Chęciński who became the librettist of arguably Moniuszko’s greatest operas, Halka and Straszny Dwór (The Haunted Manor), both infused with the fertile theme of Polish nationalism. Halka was premiered with great success in Warsaw in 1858 (10 years after the concert version performance in Vilnius!) and then later in Prague, Moscow and St. Petersburg. Moniuszko became an oversight success in the manner of Lord Byron after the publication of Childe Harold. He then began to concentrate on operas that eschewed Polish themes.\n\nThis exotic opera is set in the Indian city of Benares (now Varanasi) on the sacred Ganges, perhaps the most important religious city in India for ritual cleansing and bathing in the waters of the river and the construction of ceremonial burial pyres for the dead. It is the tragic story of an impossible love that cannot overcome the deeply entrenched caste system of Untouchables and Pariahs in India.\n\nThe significance of the exotic and culturally mysterious plot seems to have been undervalued in Poland and elsewhere on the continent and the West since its premiere. This ornate tale would not have been considered minor and impossibly far-fetched in Great Britain under the hegemony of the British Raj. The cruelty and dramatic consequences of love struggling vainly against the caste system of Untouchables and Pariahs was well understood by the English as a result of colonialism and later even neo-colonialism in India. Many great works of English literary art continue to deal with this fertile subject.\n\nThe superb masterpiece The Raj Quartet by Paul Scott towers above the rest for a profound understanding of British colonial India and the concept of the pariah. In 1984 the quartet was made into a magnificent television series called The Jewel in the Crown. If you want to understand the British in India this must be seen - such a series of this quality is no longer made.\n\nAnother more modern novel The God of Small Things (1997) by Arundhati Roy, which was awarded the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997, deals in part with the still savage exclusions of casteism among other social tensions in modern India.\n\nUntil at least 1989, this 'iron cultural curtain' effectively concealed the existence of Stanisław Moniuszko and his operas for directors, producers and audiences in the West. However I feel sure that more imaginative, fully costumed, opulent staged production of his more obscure or forgotten operas (rather than concert performances) with fine soloists of world renown would at least partially fulfil and validate all of Moniuszko's own immense and deserved hopes for an international reputation. Italian arias dominate traditional opera and French arias follow closely behind which leaves those composers writing and setting libretti in less common languages with a distinct sense of inferiority. Moniuszko remains central to a full understanding of Polish culture which is finally reaching its deserved place in the European world picture. He wrote 14 Operas, 11 Operettas, some 90 religious works in addition to over 300 songs, piano pieces, orchestral music and chamber music.\n\nPerhaps now as a result of this fiercely competitive vocal competition (which is mounted every three years), this fine composer and his works will reach a wider more international audience.\n\nI was only able to attend the opening Gala, Grand Finale and one session of the competition as I was involved in filming. However, I believe there is a true Renaissance in Polish music taking place at present as the country celebrates 15 years of European Union membership and a return to the European cultural fold. For me as a 'foreigner' it has been a revelation of fine music never before heard. Naturally, not all of them are 'undiscovered masterpieces', perhaps only a few, but many are musically extremely eloquent and deserve comparison with works in the conventional Western repertoire. We certainly need new fertilizing material in the repetitive concert fare.\n\nIn the West the Italian and French 19th century aria swept all before them but I am coming to understand musically the different style, timbre, harmonic world and melodic invention of the Polish sensibility, moulded as it is by military invasion, cultural destruction, genocide, theft and political domination. The lamenting nature of death, loss, disinheritance, yearning and nostalgia is contained within so many arias and songs by Moniuszko and others. Carl Jung would have referred to this as the musical collective unconscious of the nation which is a challenge for the Western melomanes to absorb fully and understand creatively, let alone respond to emotionally, in any profoundly meaningful sense.\n\n30.08.22\n\nTuesday\n\n20:30\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nCorina Belcea violin\n\nAxel Schacher violin\n\nKrzysztof Chorzelski viola\n\nAntoine Lederlin cello\n\nAndrzej Boreyko conductor\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nProgram:\n\nA most unusual programme to be sure but with a predominantly English flavour\n\nBenjamin Britten (1913-1976)\n\nDouble concerto for violin and viola (1932)\n\nThis rarely performed work in short score was completed by the brilliant 18-year-old RCM student Benjamin Britten by early autumn of 1932. In the summer of that year he also composed his Op. 1, the dazzling Sinfonietta for ten instruments. I had never heard the work before.\n\nCompositions for violin, viola and orchestra in the classical music repertoire are uncommon pace the Sinfonia Concertante of Mozart. Britten’s concerto has clearly been formally influenced by this work in a performance of the work that Britten had written as being ‘the most marvellous musical thrill of my life yet’. Another influence is possibly Walton’s Viola Concerto, which he had admired on another occasion.\n\nThere are three movements in the Double Concerto:\n\n1 Allegro ma non troppo\n\n2 Rhapsody: Poco lento\n\n3 Allegro scherzando – Tempo primo (Allegro ma non troppo)\n\nThe first movement, completed in two days, has interesting and rather exotic orchestration. The soloists are dominated by brass and timpani with a heartbreaking and yearning violin solo. Britten was however already displeased with the work saying he had written a ‘fatuous’ slow movement, and that ‘I shall tear that up soon’. Needless to say the work soon fell into obscurity.\n\nThe concerto survived in short score, and was prepared for performance by Colin Matthews, who noted that it was ‘complete in practically every detail’. It was performed complete for the first time in the 1995 Aldeburgh Festival, and recorded by the conductor Kent Nagano with Gidon Kremer and Yuri Bashmet as soloists.It is a lively piece that possesses fine melodic lines and dense dialogue between the soloists. John Bridcut, the English documentary filmmaker of works concerning Britten, observed ‘Britten’s true orchestral personality flowers for the first time’.\n\nIn the Rhapsody: Poco lento we were presented with a melancholic flight on the solo violin, a bird transcending the azure. I found the string writing almost neurotic in its agitation. The double bass was as if the heart was pumping blood and hovering over the strings. The texture was quite extraordinary with kettledrums and flutes. As we moved into the final inventive final movement, power and momentum began to build. I heard folk music elements and huge dynamic contrasts were rendered in the percussion and timpani.\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833-1897)\n\nDouble Concerto in A minor for violin, cello and orchestra Op. 10 (1887)\n\nOrrin Howard writes illuminatingly in a programme note for the LA Philharmonic of the immensely personal gestation of this piece.\n\nAlthough Brahms lived for twelve years after completing his Symphony No. 4 in 1885, he produced only one more orchestral work, and that one not a symphony but a concerto. And no ordinary solo concerto, either, but rather a composition which united for the first time in the form the violin and cello.\n\nWhy a concerto for this unusual combination? It has been ventured that the work was meant as a peace offering to the composer’s dear, but at-the-time alienated friend, violinist Joseph Joachim, understandably hurt that a letter of Brahms which was sympathetic to Joachim’s wife was brought as evidence in the couple’s divorce proceedings. When their mutual friend, cellist Robert Hausmann, asked Brahms for a concerto in 1887, the composer apparently saw a way to satisfy the cellist and win back the friendship of the violinist. Brahms’ instincts were right. Joachim was receptive to Brahms’ concerto overtures, and after Joachim, Hausmann, and Brahms had tried out the piece for friends, Clara Schumann wrote in her diary, “The Concerto is a work of reconciliation. Joachim and Brahms have spoken to one another again.”\n\nThe Allegro had a majestic yet vehement opening with significantly oceanic forces at the conductor's command. The rich Lederlin cello solo was in elevated dialogue with the superb Belcea violin, eloquent echoes of each other. The cantabile on the cello was deeply moving in this magnificently rhapsodic music. The inspirational Brahms melodies in the hands of these expressive soloists was both masculine in nature and powerful in impact. The immense experience in orchestral writing that Brahms had accumulated by this period in his life was overwhelmingly persuasive.\n\nThe Andante opened with a sublime melody which convincingly emanated directly from the heart and what a poignant heart it had become. Such a love song lies here it prompted me to sing in ardent devotion myself. The cello was profoundly eloquent in its emotional weight in this magnificent movement.\n\nThe Vivace has a fabled theme for excellent reasons. The duo of violin and cello are here in inspired melodic symbiosis. One must also mention the outstanding orchestral soloists who have been infected by the high-flown musical sentiments that filled us all with devotion and romantic elevation, lifting us out of the mundane and depressingly brutal reality of our times.\n\nEdward Elgar (1857-1934)\n\nIntroduction and allegro for string quartet and orchestra Op. 47 (1905)\n\nThe Introduction and Allegro was suggested to Elgar by August Jaeger -the Nimrod of the Enigma Variations - who suggested that he compose something for the recently founded London Symphony Orchestra. He described 'a brilliant, quick scherzo' which Elgar took to heart.\n\nElgar composed by writing themes in a sketch book as they came to him, even if he did not immediately use them. The Introduction and Allegro contains what Elgar referred to as the 'Welsh tune'. It had been plated in his mind in August 1901 when the Elgars were on holiday in Cardiganshire, West Wales. Folk tunes may have inspired it.\n\nThe work was not an instant success and took to achieve its present popularity. Perhaps the string virtuoso requirements dissuaded performances.\n\nThis performance was poignant yet grand and the fugal polyphony quite brilliantly handled.\n\nUnusually the four soloists of the Belcea Quartet gave an encore at this point in the concert despite it not being actually complete. They played a desperately moving account of the Cavatina from the Beethoven String Quartet No. 13 in B♭ major, Op.130, dedicating it to tortured Ukraine.\n\nMark Steinberg writes movingly and poetically of this movement in a note for the Brentano Quartet:\n\n'Beethoven’s Cavatina indeed deals with the folly of human conceits, the frailty and vulnerability of our love and our tenuous ability to communicate it, indeed our deep lack of any true model of our inner states. And it touches on the richness of the human capacity for love as well as the loneliness of isolation in the chasm between feeling and expression.'\n\nOf one passage he writes: 'The gap in expression is palpable. The incongruity of the utterances opens a space for one of the most unsettling passages in all of music, with the first violin left in desperate isolation. Beethoven marks the passage beklemmt: oppressed, anguished, stifled.' [...] 'Exquisite paradox: Music is inadequate to express what pleads to be expressed; this failure is flawlessly expressed by music.'\n\nThe inner pulsation put me in mind of irrepressible human heartbeat. In view of the present barbarous horrors meted out on the innocent people of that benighted country, I was moved as never before.\n\nEdward Elgar\n\nVariations on his own theme \"Enigma\" Op. 36 (1899)\n\nThe performance of this work at this point of spiritual anguish was a welcome balm. Anecdotally, Elgar, after returning from giving debilitating violin lessons, relaxed into an improvisation at the piano. His wife, Caroline Alice, Lady Elgar, thought one melody had distinct possibilities.Elgar wondered aloud how various friends of theirs might envisage it. Miraculously emerged the concept of the Enigma Variations, the work that established Elgar as a serious national and international composer of note.\n\nIn all, fourteen people and that most British of gifts, a dog, are featured in the variations:\n\nFirst Variation - C.A.E.\n\nElgar's wife, Alice, lovingly portrayed\n\nSecond Variation - H.D.S-P.\n\nHew David Steuart-Powell, a pianist with whom Elgar played in chamber ensembles\n\nThird Variation - R.B.T.\n\nRichard Baxter Townshend, a friend whose caricature of an old man in an amateur theatre production is captured in the variation\n\nFourth Variation - W.M.B.\n\nWilliam Meath Baker, 'country squire, gentleman and scholar', informing his guests of the day's arrangements\n\nThe Leaping Horse (1825) by John Constable (1776-1837)\n\nFifth Variation - R.P.A.\n\nRichard Arnold, son of the poet Matthew Arnold\n\nSixth Variation - Ysobel\n\nIsabel Fitton, an amateur viola player from a musical family living in Malvern\n\nSeventh Variation - Troyte\n\nArthur Troyte Griffith, a Malvern architect and close friend of Elgar throughout their lives - the variation focuses on Troyte's limited abilities as a pianist\n\nEighth Variation - W.N.:\n\nWinifred Norbury, known to Elgar through her association with the Worcestershire Philharmonic Society - the variation captures both her laugh and the atmosphere of her eighteenth century house\n\nThe Hay Wain (1821) by John Constable (1776-1837)\n\nNinth Variation - Nimrod\n\nA J Jaeger, Elgar's great friend whose encouragement did much to keep Elgar going during the period when he was struggling to secure a lasting reputation - the variation allegedly captures a discussion between them on Beethoven's slow movements\n\nTenth Variation - Dorabella\n\nDora Penney, daughter of the Rector of Wolverhampton and a close friend of the Elgars\n\nEleventh Variation - G.R.S.\n\nGeorge Sinclair, organist at Hereford Cathedral, although the variation allegedly portrays Sinclair's bulldog Dan paddling in the River Wye after falling in\n\nTwelfth Variation - B.G.N.\n\nBasil Nevinson, an amateur cellist who, with Elgar and Hew Steuart-Powell, completed the chamber music trio\n\nThirteenth Variation - ***\n\nprobably Lady Mary Lygon, a local noblewoman who sailed for Australia at about the time Elgar wrote the variation, which quotes from Mendelssohn's Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage. The use of asterisks rather than initials has however invited speculation that they conceal the identity of Helen Weaver, Elgar's fiancée for eighteen months in 1883/84 before she emigrated to New Zealand\n\nFourteenth Variation - E.D.U.\n\nElgar himself, Edoo being Alice's pet name for him.\n\nThere are two enigmas and some mysteries underlying the variations. The variations are the most widely performed of all Elgar's works while the ninth variation - Nimrod - is arguably the most moving and best loved excerpt in the whole of the classical repertoire. During my long career as a lecturer in British cultural studies, I often played Nimrod to accompany paintings by John Constable, Turner and Gainborough as well as the great English country houses of say Longleat and Blenheim and the landscaped gardens of Stourhead and Rousham.\n\nHere was a fine, spirited, musically enlightened and at times moving performance of an iconic British symphonic work by Edward Elgar - the Warsaw Philharmonic under Andrzej Boreyko.\n\n30.08.22\n\nTuesday\n\n17:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nMaria João Pires piano\n\nTrevor Pinnock conductor\n\nBasel Chamber Orchestra\n\nProgram:\n\nMaurice Ravel\n\nLe tombeau de Couperin\n\nThis work is poignant for me (being both harpsichordist and pianist). I remember graphically the leading role Trevor played in the revival of so-called 'Early Music' in London in to 1970s. His early vinyl recordings of Rameau keyboard works remain unequaled in their energetic drive, detail and refinement. These profound musical qualities now enhance and inspire his conducting.\n\nIn Le Tombeau de Couperin each movement of the Baroque style suite dedicated to friends massacred in the fetid horrors and stinking trenches of the Great War. Such a contrast within human nature is laid out for us. 'The dead are sad enough, in their eternal silence' he commented in response to criticism.\n\nThe music of Francois Couperin has always remained for me one of the great touchstones of a high point in human creative civilization. I play a great deal of it on the harpsichord. In this work Ravel fused his modern sensibility with the expressive gestures of 18th century France. He described the suite 'directed less in fact to Couperin himself than to French music of the 18th century.' Ravel melded rhythmic, melodic and cadential forms of the time of Couperin with modern times. The work expresses the present through the mirror of the past.\n\nThe elegance of the composer is surely expressed in the graphics of the cover Ravel designed for the keyboard version of the music himself. The work was originally written for piano (1914-1917).\n\nI\n\nPrélude In memory of First Lieutenant Jacques Charlot (transcriber of Ma mère l'oye for piano solo)\n\nII\n\nFugue In memory of Second Lieutenant Jean Cruppi (to whose mother, Louise Cruppi, Ravel had also dedicated L'heure espagnole)\n\nIII\n\nForlane In memory of First Lieutenant Gabriel Deluc (a Basque painter from Saint-Jean-de-Luz)\n\nIV\n\nRigaudon In memory of Pierre and Pascal Gaudin (two brothers and childhood friends of Ravel, killed by the same shell in November 1914)\n\nV\n\nMenuet In memory of Jean Dreyfus (at whose home Ravel recuperated after he was demobilized)\n\nVI\n\nToccata In memory of Captain Joseph de Marliave (musicologist and husband of Marguerite Long)\n\nThe elegance of the composer is surely expressed in the graphics of the cover Ravel designed for the piano music himself.\n\nThe orchestral version we heard this evening was arranged by Ravel in 1919, by ut only four movements as he regarded the final two as too pianistic (Prélude, Forlane, Menuet and Rigaudon). As there have been many other orchestrations of this work I was rather unsure which version we were listening to. I found the whole work charming melodically and the energetic dance rhythms exciting under Trevor Pinnock. Many orchestral soloists were outstanding such as the lyrical and poetic oboist.\n\nThe inscription reads:\n\nFamiliar with Lyons and its forest, Maurice Ravel composed in this house\n\n'Le Tombeau de Couperin' (1917) and orchestrated here the 'Pictures at an Exhibition' suite (1922)\n\nLyons-la-Forêt, Eure, Normandie, Franc\n\nMaria João Pires piano\n\nTrevor Pinnock conductor\n\nBasel Chamber Orchestra\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nPiano Concerto in A major, K. 488 (1786)\n\nThis concerto was among three that Mozart offered to Sebastian Winter in a letter to Prince von Fürstenberg for the use of the court orchestra at Donaueschingen. It is doubtful it was ever performed in Vienna as few people knew of it, unlike many of his other concertos. Such vivid charm, expressiveness, nuance and musical refinement lie in this magnificent work, sublime in its simplicity of structure.\n\nIn the opening Allegro Pires immediately expressed a glowing tone and refined touch, two qualities for which she is renowned and illuminate her Chopin playing. She maintained an intimate and close connection with both conductor and orchestra during the blithe, enchanting and lively phrases of this straightforward movement, brimming as it does with refinement and bon goût. Stylish yet restrained. Her cadenza for the first movement was finely phrased, elegant and graceful yet not lacking in internal energy.\n\nThe Adagio brought me close to tears. This is one of the most poignant movements Mozart ever wrote for the piano. He expresses from deep within and extremely soulful and heartfelt yearning for love or anguish over the loss of it. Her phrasing was superb in the expressive manner of an operatic aria. F sharp minor is my favourite key which always rends my heart with its tragic tonality. It is the only concerto movement he wrote in this dark key. The movement was divine in its sensitivity and tragic, emotional desire – such a moment of heightened existence and meditative thought during the travails of life. The orchestral support was subtle and delicate, luminous to the soul. The tragic mood is all pervasive – simple yet profound in depth – one of the great utterances of Western civilization on the nature of mortality, despair and grief.\n\nThe clouds of melancholy are dispersed with the winds in the Allegro assai. Pires Pinnock and the orchestra brought such a rush of welcome joy and refined elegance to this movement. A life enhancing return to life. The piano confines itself here to elaborating orchestral themes and detail. There was exquisite orchestral detail within the ensemble which led to a complete symbiosis of soloist and orchestra. Perfect intonation in the strings and as if the dynamics were wrapped in velvet.\n\nThe movement was simply a delight of panache felt during the Viennese course of life, not being 'too serious’ as the inevitable obstacles to human happiness arise. Her control of variation in dynamics evoked a kaleidoscope of colours drawn from the instrument with style, panache and élan. No phrase was repeated in the same manner of articulation. The movement blows away the moody old clouds with supremely effective intention and energy.\n\nKohlmarket Vienna 1786\n\nA deeply satisfying performance if occasionally lacking in spontaneous creative gestures in real time which gave the impression of slight over-familiarity with this score.\n\nCharles-François Gounod (1818-1893)\n\nSymphony No.2 in E-flat major (1855)\n\nThe French temperament is not conducive to mahogany philosophical speculation or disturbing metaphysics. Perhaps this is the reason the nineteenth century French symphony is not riding high in the expressive heavens. The Symphonie fantastique of Berlioz in 1830 had scarcely any progeny. Although the composer Gounoud is beloved and popular as an operatic composer, I find his orchestral music rather undistinguished on any spiritual and philosophical level. I felt in some ways this finely wrought symphony was akin to the raising of Lazarus - a miracle certainly but not an attractive proposition\n\nThe opening Adagio - Allegro agitato was tuneful but for me not much more than this in its implications. I could, however, feel Beethoven's Eroica lurking in the shadows. The Larghetto ma non troppo failed to touch my heart with its melodies although the orchestra has a finely honed sound which touches the emotions given the most evocative music. Charming French melodies fell gracefully on the ear but for me a symphony must have a degree of metaphysical depth and existentialist angst. The alluring melodies fly like the birds and butterflies. The Scherzo. Allegro molto was not as exciting as I had hoped but the extraordinary musical cohesiveness of this orchestra was well in evidence. The memorable tunes remain just that, memorable and joyful. The Finale. Allegro leggiero assai danced along with a delightfully light French touch. Clearly this symphony is a fluent musical composition but ....\n\nThe orchestra are a remarkably self-disciplined ensemble. As an encore they performed La Poule by Rameau arranged for orchestra. This was a truly marvellously galvanizing arrangement and fabulously executed.\n\n29.08.22\n\nMonday\n\n18:00\n\nRoyal Castle Concert Hall\n\nChamber concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nLorenzo Coppola - clarinet\n\nChristina Esclapez - historical piano\n\nProgram:\n\nIgnacy Feliks Dobrzyński (1807 -1867)\n\nIgnacy Feliks Dobrzyński (1807 -1867)\n\nThe Polish composer and teacher of Fryderyk Chopin, Jozef Elsner (1769-1854), had another pupil of near genius (if I may be so bold) Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński, a school friend of Chopin. Elsner wrote in a report of Chopin 'special ability - Genius etc' and of Dobrzyński 'rare ability'.\n\nUnlike Frycek, he came from a professional musical family and was in many ways more precocious and wider in orchestral instrumental adventurism and skill than Chopin who concentrated so single-mindedly on the piano as a vehicle for his expressive soul. Many of his fine works are being resuscitated in Poland during this Polish musical renaissance, especially his symphonies, cantatas, songs, chamber works, a piano concerto, piano pieces and perhaps in the future, his opera Monbar. His first published work, a Polonaise in A major, was dedicated to the Polish pianist Maria Szymanowska. When Chopin left Warsaw for Paris on the eve of the November Uprising of 1830, avoiding the brutal Russian occupation, the Polish composer Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński stayed on and satisfied the intense demand for patriotic music. He seems condemned to labour under the cloud of his compatriot of genius, Fryderyk Chopin.\n\nDuo in A-flat major for clarinet and piano (1847)\n\nThis was one of his last works in the chamber music genre, composed in the 1840s. It was first performed in 1853 but not published for a hundred years. The Buchholtz copy piano (a Polish manufacturer from Chopin's day) and clarinet (a copy of a period 1820 instrument) were well matched in timbre and sound texture.\n\nThe keyboard of the Buchholtz piano\n\nCoppola gave his highly entertaining and knowledgeable introduction to the work, indicating the significant influence of opera in its composition.\n\nThe Agitato opening movement clearly has an operatic aria base with the male and female 'voices' (piano and clarinet) of the duo 'arguing' in lively arabesques. There are touches of militarism in the march theme. The Adagio doloroso and molto espressivo opened with an extraordinary dark 'rumbling' cloud of sound from the piano with the clarinet floating above this threatening sea like a soaring bird. Charming, melodic and effective. The final Allegretto mosso e animato features a blithe melody on the clarinet. Again we eavesdrop on a 'conversation' between piano and clarinet. Esclapez rendered the piano most attractively, semi-detaché articulation with a singing melody. There is much humour, charming wit and the carefree joy of youth in this music.\n\nFerenc Liszt\n\nBallade in B minor, No. 2 (S. 171) (1853)\n\nThe Paul McNulty copy of the piano by the great Viennese maker Johann Baptist Streicher (1796–1871)\n\nEsclapez chose an 1868 piano by the great Viennese maker Johann Baptist Streicher (1796–1871). She loved the colours, timbre and sound of this instrument a great deal.\n\nHero and Leander (1798) by Jean-Joseph Taillasson (1745-1809)\n\nThe distinguished pianist Claudio Arrau was a student of the Liszt pupil Martin Krause. His embedded tale is of the lovers Hero and Leander who lived separated by the Hellespont. Each evening Hero would light a lamp and Leander would swim to him and gather in the oblivion of love. However one stormy night the lamp was blown out and Leander lost his way in the pitch black of night and cold waters. In the morning light Hero spied the body of her beloved Leander dead on the shore. In despair she committed suicide. The music of the Ballade clarifies this myth and the scenes leading up to the tragic drowning are aesthetically and poetically depicted.\n\nThe refinement of touch by Esclapez extracted a superb colour spectrum from the different registers of this instrument. The evocation of love in the theme was both lyrical and aesthetically beautiful. She created an 'oceanic' sound from the Streicher, a feeling of storm tossed emotional seas. The contrast of registers in sound, textural exploration, was like a beacon had suddenly been illuminated on a dark night. One had a profound expression of tragic events not unlike a Chopin Ballade but more 'programmatic' in the best sense.\n\nIt is clear that Liszt had studied the structure and emotional landscape and its development in the Chopin Ballades (often the lineaments of a coherent dream realized in sound). He, in fact, dedicated this work to Chopin. However, in some ways he distanced himself from the Chopin form and liberated it. Obsessed with literature, as so many nineteenth century composers were, he was obviously aware of written folk and poetic literary ballads. He made a definite contribution to and development of the genre in this work.\n\nEsclapez wonderfully did not present it as simply another large, predominantly virtuoso work by Liszt, but rather as a narrative poem of many scenes. In many ways Liszt opened up new musical avenues to explore by later composers although the Ballade he wrote has few direct imitators it such a daunting keyboard masterpiece.\n\nThe Paul McNulty copy of the 1868 Johann Streicher piano\n\nFortepiano Streicher, 1868\n\nJohann Baptiste Streicher (1796 — 1871) was the son of Nanette Stein and Johann Andreas Streicher. He was part of a piano making dynasty, already one hundred years famous in 1870, when the Streicher company gave Brahms a grand piano (Serial No. 6713, manufactured in 1868), which he used for the rest of his life.\n\nBrahms described his relation to his piano in a letter to Clara Schumann: “It is quite a different matter to write for instruments whose characteristics and sound one only incidentally has in one’s head and which one can only hear mentally, than to write for an instrument which one knows through and through, as I know this piano. There I always know exactly what I write and why I write one way or another.” He also advised her, in another letter, to buy a Streicher. When Clara Schumann visited Johannes Brahms for the last time in 1896, together with her children, they gathered in his apartment around his Streicher piano, and she played, reading through his latest, probably intermezzos, with tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nThis particular instrument realizes a beautiful, confident design from a unique dynasty in piano building. The impulse to reproduce Brahms’s favourite piano came from prominent Australian Professor Neal Peres da Costa, the author of “Off the Record: Performing Practices in Romantic Piano Playing” – Oxford University Press. The project was hugely aided by Paul McNulty’s owning two contemporaneous pianos, opp.6747 and 6932, which functioned as a priceless technical resource, controlling every feature of construction and refinement (taken from the Paul McNulty fortepiano website).\n\nJohannes Brahms\n\nClarinet Quintet in B minor Op. 115 (arrangement by Paul Klengel for clarinet and piano)\n\nThis transcription of the 'heavenly' quintet for piano duo was made in 1892 by Paul Klengel (1854-1935). He was a violinist, pianist and conductor at the Leipzig Conservatoire. Amazingly, it was only rediscovered a few months ago when a private music collection was donated to the library of the Haute école de musique in Geneva.\n\nEsclapez once again chose the Streicher piano and Coppola played a copy of a clarinet originally used by the inspired clarinetist friend of Brahms, Richard Mühlfeld.\n\nThe opening Allegro was brimming with colours, timbre and many variations in dynamic. The clarinet sculpted flowing arabesques of melody. The Adagio was most affecting in its lyrical theme which was transformed into a rhapsodic mood at times. The colours that Coppola caused to emerge from the clarinet were kaleidoscopic which worked in perfect companionship with the piano. The yearning for the remembered nostalgia for happier days was intense as Brahms approached death. A passionate forte section required a high degree of virtuosity in the clarinet which Coppola accomplished without limitation. His wide range of dynamics moderated the emotions to a high degree of eloquence\n\nThe short Andantino was as if the composer took a pausing breath in an Intermezzo. The final Con moto movement possessed a lively forward movement. The piano and clarinet were here in a perfect symbiotic relationship. They moved through the glorious variations in a manner both alluring and at times even humorous. I followed Hungarian folk elements and perhaps Yiddish motifs too. One deeply melancholic variation prefigured death. Overall a brilliant and inspiring performance which one is unlikely to hear often in life. A treasure.\n\n28.08.22\n\nSunday\n\n20:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nPiotr Alexewicz piano\n\nAlexander Gadjiev piano\n\nAndrzej Boreyko conductor\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nAndrzej Boreko and Alexander Gadjiev\n\nProgram:\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nNocturne in A flat major Op. 32 No. 2\n\nThis orchestral arrangement of Chopin’s Nocturne in A major Op.32/2 commissioned from Stravinsky by Diaghilev for Les Sylphides by the Ballets Russes at the spectacular premiere saison russe of ballet at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris in 1909. I fond it interesting rather than nocturnally reflective, elegaic and romantic. The passionate agitation towards the conclusion was enhanced by the orchestral dynamic. Alexewicz is a fine young Polish pianist of enormous promise.\n\nPiotr Alexewicz\n\nFantasy in A major on Polish Airs Op. 13\n\nAndrzej Panufnik (1914-1991)\n\nAndrzej Panufnik\n\nPiano concerto\n\nI had never heard this concerto by the great Polish composer. I quote him and his posthumous website, by far the best authority on its true nature.\n\nAndrzej Panufnik’s Piano Concerto has had a long and interesting history. It has been accepted that the original version of the work is a two-movement work, because for years the concerto indeed functioned as a composition comprising two parts – the contemplative Molto tranquillo and the virtuoso Molto agitato. The Piano Concerto received its current, three-part form only in the mid-1980s, when the composer added the introductory Entrata.\n\nEntrata – despite the fact that it slightly resembles the musical material from the earlier first movement of the concerto – is markedly shorter (lasting only about 4 minutes) and is more of an introduction and preparation for the main, slow movement of the work. For the contemplative middle movement is undoubtedly the main part of Panufnik’s Piano Concerto – its most important element, marked by piano sounds of extraordinary beauty, full of poetry and gentleness, subtly and tastefully embellished by the sounds of the orchestra.\n\nIt was in the three-part version from the early 1980s (the composer modified the Entrata again in 1985) that Andrzej Panufnik’s Piano Concerto functions today.\n\nIn May 1983 the Piano Concerto was recorded for the BBC Radio by John Ogdon and the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the composer’s baton; the first studio recording was not made until 1991, barely a few months before the death of Panufnik, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra with Ewa Pobłocka as the soloist.\n\nMy purpose was to compose a virtuoso work for the pianist which would give him the chance to demonstrate his capacity for poetic expression as well as his technical skill and bravura. I wanted also to exploit and explore the sonoric range of the piano, from sustained, singing notes to very dry, percussive sounds. In addition, I wanted to make the orchestra's participation one of real significance, with a powerful role to play. The Concerto has two movements: Molto tranquillo (very slow) and Molto agitato (very fast) – each of which imposes upon the performer and listener a definite climate and character.\n\nThe first movement is an extremely quiet, contemplative dialogue between soloist and orchestra (while within the orchestra there is a further dialogue between the wind instruments and the strings). I made constant use of the palindromic form creating a kind of lyrical geometry in order to emphasise meditative and reflective feelings. As regards the musical material, I imposed upon myself a strict discipline, this movement being based on the intervals of one minor and one major second as a 'basic sound' within the framework of the mirror construction.\n\nThe second movement follows attacca, with a violent outburst from the orchestra. This movement again is based on only two intervals: this time a major third and minor third. By the persistent repetition of these intervals, I wanted to create an urgent sense of agitation, even turbulence. However, the middle section of this movement is in contrast quite lyrical in character and based on the material of the first movement (minor and major seconds), in order to achieve some unity and firm binding together of these two deeply contrasted blocks: Molto tranquillo and Molto agitato.\n\nI found the orchestral timbre absolutely fantastic in its variety. Gadjieff expressed the Larghetto with ultra subtle pianissimo. I entered an extraordinary dream world of great strangeness that was extremely introspective containing what one might term 'minimalist emotion'. I felt this pianist to be outstanding in such a contemporary work, when at times during the Chopin competition I was plagued by doubts. His view was reflective and religious in tone and contemplative meditation on the spiritual nature of life. The Presto agitato resembled a dynamic explosion. Boreyko the conductor was deeply and magnificently engaged with the orchestra. He conducted with excellent exactitude, the percussion extremes led towards almost nineteenth century harmonic resolutions. Gadjieff was simply overwhelming in the massive virtuosic cadenza (if I may call it that).\n\nPressing personal reasons unfortunately prevented me from returning for the Manuel de Falla after the intermission.\n\nManuel de Falla\n\nFuego fatuo\n\nThe composer's beautiful surviving wife, Lady Camilla Panufnik (left), represents for me another world of civilized refinement and graceful sensibility to the present day.\n\nShe was seated in the audience with the Artistic Director of the Festival, Stanisław Leszczyński and the great pianist, winner of the 2010 International Chopin Competition and profound interpreter of modern piano compositions, Yulianna Avdeeva\n\nLady Camilla Panufnik and Alexander Gadjiev\n\n28.08.22\n\nSunday\n\n17:00\n\nRoyal Castle Concert Ballroom\n\nRecital of Songs\n\nPerformers:\n\nOlga Pasiecznik soprano\n\nEwa Pobłocka period piano (Erard 1849)\n\nProgram\n\nStanisław Moniuszko\n\nThe most beautiful Moniuszko Songs (2)\n\nAn extraordinarily graceful and moving recital of much refinement. I will give the songs their English translations as they are evocative of the nature of love and poetic in expressiveness. Both artists performed perfectly together in symbiosis, the subtle, discreet accompaniment of Pobłocka to the glorious, emotionally rich voice of Pasicznik. A truly uplifting concert of the most eloquent beauty.\n\nTo the bud - such an alluring sentiment\n\nThe girl and the bird - poetic wisdom cradled in lovely simplicity as a girl sings to a bird of her l love\n\nIf someone could love me truly - again a delicate and simple sentiment couched in a delicate melody\n\nKittie - a apparently carefree, tuneful even joyful song which conceals a girl married against her will\n\nThe goldfish - a melancholic song which contains Moniuszko's best loved lyrics\n\nPasiecznik then Turned to the Ukrainian tragedy which she supports intensely and gave us a Ukrainian folk song unknown to me but emotionally devastating\n\nPodolian elegy (Attachment) was an attractive song with rather melancholic reflections but tripmphant optimism at the conclusion. It declares love for the motherland to words by Tymon Zaborowski from his Podolian elegies under Turkish rule (1830).\n\nMatchmaking - as one might expect a jolly song to a mazurka rhythm\n\nThe spinstress - a perpetuum mobile in the piano part which swirls endlessly like a spinning wheel - superlative keyboard writing and playing by Pobłocka\n\nNaja's Song - a girl talks to a bird about her beloved. the piano art is complex and rich in harmonies\n\nMenacing girl ­- the rather threatening aspects of this creature are slightly smoothed away by the krakowiak rhythm\n\nDumka (Elegy - Come my darling) - is a gloomy song of unrequited love, a girl longs for a young man who loves another.

Franck was at the peak of his creativity and much influenced by Wagner. He began to break new tonal ground and was once more attracted to chamber music composition. The result was this remarkable, deeply sensual Quintet. Frank was much romantically and physically attracted to his pupil Augusta Holmès (1847-1903). Saint-Saëns, to whom the Quintet was dedicated by Franck, was lamentably suffering from a condition of unrequited love for the same lady. The unconcealed sensual passion expressed in this quintet upset him greatly during the first performance on the 17th January 1880 where he played the piano part. He allegedly stormed off the stage after the performance in a blue funk.\n\nKholodenko opened the Molto moderato quasi lento in a highly passionate and magnificent manner with the quartet. We encountered great psychological agitation of an existentialist kind. The work emerged as almost symphonic in impact. The theme of this movement is deeply expressive of sensual yearning and desire, perfectly understood by all these remarkable performers.\n\nThe Lento con molto sentimento again sang in soulful and heartbreaking yearning for love. The theme was affectingly poignant with much ardent feeling, yet with haunting fears and premonitions of betrayal. Many unresolved fears lay here ....\n\nThe Allegro non troppo ma con fuoco apportioned marvellous and eloquent string writing for each member of the quartet. Corina Belvcea was sublime, ardent and impassioned in this movement. Kholodenko was equally possessed by the musical spirit in the repeated phrases - in many ways a call of despair in a potentially hopeless cause. I found it almost fantastically symphonic and building tremendous drama of erotic anticipation in the unresolved harmonies. As Stendhal once observed, the power and intensity of love lies in the anticipation not in the fulfillment of desire. In the heart can lurk a painful degree of anticlimactic satisfaction.\n\nMieczyslaw Weinberg (1919-1996)\n\nPiano Quintet in F minor Op. 18 (1944)\n\nWeinberg was born in Warsaw into a highly musical Jewish family at the close of the Great War. His training at the highest level as a pianist was rudely interrupted by the Second World War. They fled to the USSR but his parents died in a concentration camp and he alone survived. It marked his psyche deeply which can be heard in his magnificently tortured and troubled quintet. He considered composition a 'duty' to those who had perished. One can hear the influence of Russian, Polish and Jewish cultures in his music. Autobiographical memories of World War II and the loss of the innocence of childhood suffuse his compositions.\n\nModerato con moto A rather symphonic texture that was not in the lest seductive, rather arrestingly realistic. Lyricism alternates with militarism. The Allegretto opens with a violin and cello duo leading to monumentally florid piano solo with fantastic driving forward rhythms, irresistible. Avdeeva was musically taken over and charismatically convincing in idiom, the intense quartet in companionship with effective pizzicato interludes. The movement has a magically varied sound palette and many references to Jewish musical idioms. In this Presto - scherzo third movement, Avdeeva was simply phenomenal and overwhelming in pianistic commitment and virtuosity. The ensemble playing was spectacular in this movement, a type of flaming energy was set alight. Sudden explosions of piano sound filled the hall with gunpowder. Avdeeva betrayed incandescent passion in this movement.\n\nThe Largo was possessed of a remarkable massed ensemble sound in the opening. It contained within it all the spiritual and physical horrors of the holocaust. Cries from the earth as the hand of death reach out to us from the grave. The string pianissimo sections were quite transporting into another realm of soul experience. The violin lament is taken over by the powerful solo piano. Here the composition was intensely expressive in the overall abstract construction of the movement. One heard a 'piano clock' ticking which together with the cello obligato was unique, disturbing yet elevating. The pizzicato became deeply unsettling in view of the current murderous events in Ukraine. The ultimate and profound sadness of loss in the heart of the Jewish race evolved into a desperately moving elegy.\n\nThe final impassioned Allegro agitato movement featured sharp, repeated phrases on viola, second violin and cello embodying fractured, cruelly broken Jewish folk dancing. Avdeeva never dominated here despite the opportunity but merely added discreetly to the deeply unsettling atmosphere. I could not help reflecting on the nobility and monumentality of this ensemble in this great work. I heard the ringing of a dislocated and disinherited mind in this movement. The piano cries are the echoes of the condemned. One is aware as the work concludes of the rise of protecting life forces that in many ways work to redeem the fatalism. Yet life ultimately fades in the profoundly affecting dynamic fading away of the conclusion to this movement.\n\nAn awe-inspiring performance of a chamber masterpiece by masterly musicians who understand the nature of foreign oppression, war and summary execution to its core.\n\n27.08.22\n\nSaturday\n\n17:00\n\nRoyal Castle Ballroom\n\nVocal recital\n\nPerformers:\n\nMariusz Godlewski baritone\n\nRadosław Kurek period piano (Erard 1849)\n\nProgram:\n\nStanisław Moniuszko\n\nThe most beautiful of Moniuszko Songs (1)\n\nThis was a rather traditional recital which I found rewarding in many ways and on many different musical and personal levels. The baritone Mariusz Godlewski is popular in Poland I think because he approaches these songs in a powerful yet vulnerable masculine style with a supremely masculine sensibility (if one can say such things without offense in this time of controversial gender questioning).\n\nI will mention songs that I found most meaningful with a few words of reasoning. The titles will be in English. One really requires the detailed guide to the festival for this concert that gives on the poetic story by great Polish poets lying at the heart of these songs. For me this is all part of the present Polish Musical Renaissance. The musical and literary qualities (poems by Mickiewicz par example) of the songs were of prime importance.\n\nCoversation (1) The attention of Polish emigrants is drawn nostalgically to their homeland\n\nOn The Nida - Deeply moving song and music - the words are poetically transporting\n\nMigrating Bird - pervaded by the most beautiful imaginable imagery\n\nMother You are No More! No compulsion to indicate the loss of mother love here\n\nThe Village Chief - Charming rather rustic songs. The often affecting poetry is simple but lifted onto another plane by the music.\n\nDitty (above the river's placid waters) - A charming and passionate song\n\nAngel-child - Such a tragic story and poem lies here. A mother is working in the fields during the heat of the summer harvest and places her baby on a grassy bank whilst she works. The baby tragically dies of heat stroke but nature transforms her into an angel.\n\nA Ball on the Ice - A strong and powerful song\n\nThe Alderman's Song - Such a jolly song!\n\nMatty - a song of resignation to fate.

He prepared the ground for Polish music of the Romantic period but is a largely forgotten figure\n\nThe opening Allegro of this clarinet concerto is a masterpiece of composition for the instrument comparable to the clarinet concertos of Weber or Mozart. In keeping with the 'Polish syndrome of incompleteness' (Marcin Król) the final two movements are lost but replacements were here reconstructed by Michał Dobrzyński\n\nThis evening the work began with the Andante and finished with the Allegro. This movement is both charming and melodious with interesting melodic changes. The Rondo. Allegretto struck me as the very finest of Bath Spa or Bad Kissingen infinitely charming but quite inconsequential music. The clarinet blended seamlessly with the orchestral music. The Allegro first movement undoubtedly composed by Kurpiński was a lively and tuneful statement. The historic period clarinet was highly successful in this context. The virtuoso playing was so civilized and elegant in the atmosphere he created.\n\nTumultuous applause from both orchestra and audience for Hoeprich\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)\n\nPiano Concerto in E flat major K. 482 (1785-1786)\n\nThe Love Letter (1770) - Jean Honoré Fragonard\n\nThe composition of this concerto was completed during Mozart working on La Nozze de Figaro. he was at the height of his Viennese popularity. Michael Kelly, an Irish tenor who pioneered the roles of Basilio and Don Curzio in this opera left a lively description of Mozart’s performance 'His feeling, the rapidity of his fingers, the great execution and strength of his left hand particularly, and the apparent inspiration of his modulations, astounded me.'\n\nMozart performed this concerto possibly three times or more during his brief life. The colourful woodwind writing, rather appropriately for this particular concert, utilizes clarinets in place of the oboes of an orchestra of this time.\n\nThe opening Allegro pursues a drum-roll figure and the orchestra, which is rather festive and melodically undemanding, passes through different keys with the soloist. Mozart seems to have been returning to entertaining 'social' music to please his Viennese audience. Ritter playing the exceptional McNulty Graf was delightful with finely controlled dynamic contrast, balance and attention to detail in his 'conversational' exchanges with the orchestra. He possesses a fine sense of Mozart phrasing and rubato with an excellent cadenza.\n\nThe melancholy Andante of song and variations on the other hand is deeply moving with its sense of despair and resignation. Mozart’s father Leopold wrote that it was much appreciated by the audience: 'the Andante had to be repeated (something rare).' The alternation of major and minor keys anticipated the coming Romantic movement and was popular.\n\nThe Finale is an Allegro in the form of a Rondo which dispels the gloom. The sun emerges from behind the darker clouds of threatening destiny. Ritter added some discreet, graceful and tasteful ornaments with a fine rather elaborate cadenza. A wonderful theme lies embedded here and the joining of full orchestra with soloist was so uplifting. Ritter has a highly developed sense of one and touch on the earlier instrument. On occasion I felt a lack of that eighteenth century affectation, social artfulness and guile that takes us incontrovertibly into the period.\n\nGraf, Vienna c.1819 (2007)\n\nJoseph Haydn\n\nSymphony No. 98 in B flat major Hob. I/98\n\nA portrait of Joseph Haydn from 1785 was discovered in an antique store in the US city of Savannah, Georgia. The work - one of three versions by Christian Ludwig Seehas, dating from Haydn’s stay in Vienna - was identified by Dr Walter Reicher, secretary general of the International Joseph Haydn Private Foundation Eisenstadt, which has now acquired the painting.\n\nThe work opens with a pleasant Adagio which serves as a gentle introduction to the energetic Allegro. The conductor Marek Moś and the rejuvenated Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century made much of the complex internal polyphonic and contrapuntal detail.\n\nThe renowned musicologist and composer Donald Tovey suggested that the beautiful cantabile Adagio was Haydn’s requiem for his friend Mozart, who had died the previous December. It has a supremely civilized, elegant and graceful Viennese theme. Certainly the echoes of the ‘Jupiter’ Symphony’s Andante are clear in this exquisite movement, in full sonata form. In the recapitulation, Haydn seems to have modelled the hymn-like main theme on ‘God save the King’.\n\nThe Menuetto Presto charms one inexorably as rather a celebratory, festive movement. The Finale Presto is replete with eloquent, short phrases possessing inspiring energy, sparkling wit and humour. The many changes of instrumentation in the orchestral writing is extraordinarily effective.\n\nA magnificent symphony with a fine, eminently suitable orchestra and idiomatic conducting. The concertmaster of the orchestra was particularly extravagant in gesture and musical involvement.\n\nAlexander Janiczek the flamboyant concertmaster of the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century\n\nWas it a celeste I heard that decorated the conclusion - certainly Haydn wrote a solo piece for himself for the harpsichord or fortepiano that would have galvanized the audience no end!\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nVariations in B flat major on a theme from Mozart’s ‘Don Giovanni’ (‘Là ci darem la mano’) Op. 2\n\nTwice in the same evening and on a modern and period piano ! Also with the same outstanding artist who is rather a master of the style brillante, eminently suitable for this early work of Chopin. I have written about the genesis and character of this work in my criticism below. I found this piano sound spectrum in balanced tandem with the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century perfectly satisfying.\n\nI thought the whole tonal landscape, texture and atmosphere perfectly in period and with the brilliant technique of Liu, both exciting and joyful at once. He seems to have a natural gift for accommodating to the Erard and extracting a variegated colour palette from it. The timpani was rather overwhelming in impact at times but is added a rather exciting, expressive and dramatic impression lifting the work into unexplored realms. The entire performance was impressive in an utterly different way to earlier in the evening.\n\nWild and tumultuous applause which led to an encore of Rameau - Les Sauvages\n\nErard, Paris 1858\n\nThis instrument (serial no. 30315) was built in Paris in 1858. It is veneered in rosewood, inlaid with ormolu frames.\n\nThis instrument (serial no. 30315) was built in Paris in 1858. It is veneered in rosewood, inlaid with ormolu frames. It has a composite frame connected with screws, consisting of an iron pinning table and six stress bars, a predecessor of today’s full cast iron frame, with a bar brace in the treble. It is single-, double- and triple-strung, with wound bass strings and una corda and damper pedals. The keyboard compass covers seven octaves (A2–a4), as in modern instruments. The piano is equipped with a typical Erard action, a prototype of the double repetition English action generally used today. This instrument was bought in 2010 and renovated in the workshop of Grzegorz Machnacki.\n\n26.08.22\n\nFriday\n\n18:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nPerformer\n\nBruce (Xiaoyu) Liu piano\n\nFirst Prize at the 18th Fryderyk Chopin International Piano Competition in Warsaw 2021\n\nProgram\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau\n\nLiu did not attempt to imitate the harpsichord by over articulation of Rameau on the piano, a 'fault' that even Grigory Sokolov is prone to despite the overwhelming impact he makes in this work. Liu gives a subtle and judicious touch of the pedal which softens the attack and takes the Rameau into an additional tonal realm.\n\nLes tendres plaints\n\nCharming playing for the reasons outlined above\n\nLes Cyclopes\n\nExcellent 'period feel' but could have been slightly more detached for my taste\n\nMenuets I and II\n\nRefinement of touch and approach. A French, even impressionistic, feel was given to the piece by Liu\n\nLes sauvages\n\nLively and definitely pagan\n\nLa poule\n\nTrue to title, Liu humorously and impressively created a work tremendously reminiscent of a chicken\n\nGavotte et six doubles\n\nHe made charming, melodious and judicious use of the pedal. He was not tempted, as are too many, to over-virtuosity. He perceptively and musically revealed the embedded counterpoint and polyphony but overall I was looking for slightly more emotional expression. As a harpsichordist I must admit to preferring this work on the instrument for which it was written!\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nVariations in B flat major on a theme from Mozart’s ‘Don Giovanni’ (‘Là ci darem la mano’) Op. 2\n\nChopin composed the ‘Là ci darem’ Variations in 1827. As a student of the Main School of Music, he had received from Elsner another compositional task: to write a set of variations for piano with orchestral accompaniment. As his theme, he chose the famous duet between Zerlina and Don Giovanni from the first act of Mozart’s opera Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni. In this opera overwhelming power and faultless seduction meet maidenly naivety and barely controlled fascination. (Tomaszewski)\n\n'Là ci darem la mano' Walter Richard Sickert (1860–1942)\n\n(National Trust, Fenton House)\n\nIn his famous first review of Chopin's variations on Mozart’s 'Là ci darem la mano', Schumann gives us a striking description:\n\n“Eusebius quietly opened the door the other day. You know the ironic smile on his pale face, with which he invites attention. I was sitting at the piano with Florestan. As you know, he is one of those rare musical personalities who seem to anticipate everything that is new, extraordinary, and meant for the future. But today he was in for a surprise. Eusebius showed us a piece of music and exclaimed: ‘Hats off, gentlemen, a genius! Eusebius laid a piece of music on the piano rack. […] Chopin – I have never heard the name – who can he be? […] every measure betrays his genius!’”\n\nChopin’s ‘Là ci darem’ variations are classical in form with an introduction, theme, five variations and finale. They are a marvellous example of the style brillante and clearly influenced by Hummel and Moscheles.\n\nLiu gave us a pleasant sotto voce opening as correctly indicated and a deliberate tempo marked Largo that opens the work without the over-declamatory virtuoso energy many pianists adopt. Possibly it slightly lacked an undertone of beguiling seduction. It is well-known Chopin was obsessed with opera all his life, a fascination that began early. Liu applied phrasing that was uncannily as if the aria was being sung with vocal intonation and alluring and charming cantabile.\n\nHe applied winning dynamic variation in repeated phrases with a fine variety of tone and touch in developments that were light, elegant and stylish. Each variation had an individual character and the feeling of carefree and enjoyable improvisation. Liu never presented this work as simply a piano display piece although occasionally charm fell victim to irresistible and tempting virtuosity of youth. Liu brought a feeling of the late 18th century in his style and artfulness. Waterfalls of glittering notes cascaded around us as in the original descriptions of jeu perlé.\n\nClara Wieck loved this work and performed it often making it popular in Germany. Her notorious father, who had forbidden her marriage to Robert Schumann, wrote perceptively and rather ironically of this work: ‘In his Variations, Chopin brought out all the wildness and impertinence of the Don’s life and deeds, filled with danger and amorous adventures. And he did so in the most bold and brilliant way’.\n\nMaurice Ravel\n\nMiroirs\n\nFerenc Liszt\n\nRéminiscences de Don Juan, S 418\n\nDon Giovanni and Zerlina Duet\n\nThe performance of this work in Warsaw so soon after Duszniki Zdrój was not radically different so I offer my rather similar review to that of 5 August 2022 without apology.\n\nI have always considered the 'reminiscence' to be as defined by the Oxford Dictionary as 'A story told about a past event remembered by the narrator.' In this case the spectacular virtuosic display we heard from Liu was more like a recreation of the opera itself than a past event remembered through the filter of time. Then again when the Russian critic Vladimir Stasov, attended a Liszt recital of this work in St. Petersburg in 1839 he wrote:\n\n'We had never in our lives heard anything like this; we had never been in the presence of such a brilliant, passionate, demonic temperament, at one moment rushing like a whirlwind, at another pouring forth cascades of tender beauty and grace. Liszt's playing was absolutely overwhelming...'\n\nOne cannot help but apply precisely this judgement to the Liu performance of this Fantasie Dramatique. Ferruccio Busoni adored the work, preparing five separate editions if memory serves me correctly. It was the most amazing feat of sheer virtuosic pianism imaginable. He commandeered an orchestral sound from the instrument one rarely, if ever, encounters in the concert hall.\n\nSacheverell Sitwell in his uniquely perceptive book Liszt comments: 'The Don Juan Fantasia has an indescribable and sinister virtuosity which is strangely in keeping with the cynical romanticism of its subject....so many expressions of mood and atmosphere.' (p.149)\n\nI felt that the sinister nature of Liu's performance was not as evil-haunting as it might have been, submerged as it was in this incredible technical display. Fortunately for them, many young pianists have not yet had a 'sinisterly blighted love affair' that upends the soul and heart. This is particularly true if a feeling or the experience of juanesque manipulation of the heart has entered the romantic picture. The Liszt Mephisto Waltz and Faust Symphony are similarly replete with guile and deceit of the most malicious kind. To penetrate to the absolute core of List's sulphurous recreations of the metaphysical, it is useful not only to have keyboard command but the also a strong personal sense of sinful, lustful and erotic excursions of the soul.\n\nI have never particularly liked this work but in many ways last night was rather physically and pianistically overwhelming and altered my opinion. I believe that Liu was also compelled to redefine it for himself, or so a little bird told me. Again as mentioned before, he brought a compositely different sound palette from Ravel to this composer. The interpretation was full of humour, delightful changes of mood and ironical comment as well as hints of the 'punished reprobate' and hellfire - all this quite apart from the overwhelming pianistic technique that was on display. The interpretation is rather lighthearted in parts as Liszt certainly was in his personality. But on the other side of the human coin, the L.H. bass was largely effective as a growling existential threat to existence that hovers permanently over Don Giovanni.mastery of the keyboard and chords as solid and indestructible as granite.\n\nCertainly what I heard tonight was brilliant and the articulation and energy contained in the Champagne Aria quite magnificent. The insidious and cynical 'seduction' of Zerlina by the worldly Don was wonderfully accomplished and based purely on sexual allure leading to an erotic climacteric of enormous proportions in the musical score.\n\nThe hall erupted into a tumultuous standing ovation and wild cheering which lasted for many minutes.\n\nAs a first encore, a piece from the Album de Mai by Paderewski. Then a Chopin Étude followed by the Lento con gran espressione which could not have been a greater contrast in sensibility to Liszt\n\n25.08.22\n\nThursday\n\n21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nKate Liu piano\n\nJanusz Olejniczak piano\n\nAndriy Yurkevych conductor\n\nSinfonia Varsovia\n\nProgram\n\nValentyn Silvestrov (b. 1937)\n\nMoments of Memory II (1954-2003)\n\nBorn in Kyiv in 1937, the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov made his name in the 1960s with avant-garde scores that challenged Soviet aesthetic norms by composing between austere modernism and eclectic polystylism. As Russia’s escalated war against Ukraine enters its seventh month, Valentin Silvestrov, Ukraine’s best-known living composer, has become a musical spokesman for his country. 'I don’t know how we lived to see this' he said. Silvestrov’s sudden soaring global reputation has caused him some unease. He said he feels strange, even irritated, 'that this misfortune needed to happen for them to begin playing my music.'\n\n'It’s very obvious that this is not a problem of Ukraine and Russia. It is a problem of civilization.'\n\nOne has to listen to Silvestrov in a completely different way to the usual in that his music 'balances on the edge of silence', the sound teetering at times on the edge of existence. In view of current events in Ukraine I found this remarkable minimalist piece deeply unsettling, movingly nostalgic and evocative.\n\nMoments of Memory II\n\nJanusz Olejniczak used his command of rounded tone and refined touch to concentrate on producing a carrying sound overcoming all the difficulties of being completely exposed.\n\nNo. 1 Serenade of Childhood\n\nHarmonically simple and minimalist.\n\nNo. 2 Elegy\n\nShadows of memory cross the mind.

Hopefully it will be better known through new National Chopin Institute recordings. Here we experienced much exuberant and masterful orchestration in the Polish national spirit. Excellent panache shown by Sinfonia Varsovia under Andriy Yurkevych.\n\nWitold Maliszewski (1873-1939)\n\nOverture in D major Op. 11 (1902)\n\nAnother undiscovered Polish composer of true talent! This renowned orchestra made much of this bucolic work and its skillful and expressive orchestration. I was enamored of the humor in the work and a lovely fugal pastiche. However, the main quality that impressed me overall was the powerful, driving energy.\n\nThe soloist Kate Liu was awarded Third Prize in the17th International Fryderyk Chopin Competition, Warsaw, 1-23 October 2015\n\nShe was also awarded the Mazurka Prize\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810-1849)\n\nPiano Concerto in F minor Op. 21 (1830)\n\n‘As I already have, perhaps unfortunately, my ideal, whom I faithfully serve, without having spoken to her for half a year already, of whom I dream, in remembrance of whom was created the adagio of my concerto’ (Chopin to his friend Tytus Woyciechowski , 3 October 1829).\n\nThe work was written 1829-30 This concerto was inspired by Chopin’s infatuation or was it youthful love for the soprano Konstancja Gladkowska. It is rumoured the blue-eyed Polish soprano possibly inspired the romantic emotions contained within this concerto, preferred the attentions of two splendidly uniformed and dashing young Russian cavalry officers. Chopin loved her voice (as he loved the voice and opera throughout his life), the most beautiful of the young female music students at the Warsaw Conservatory. He met her when he was 19 and she sang at his farewell from the country. They exchanged rings but their correspondence faded away after a year. Strangely the concerto was published a few years later with a dedication to Delfina Potocka.\n\nThe work followed the Mozart model and was directly influenced by the style brillante of Hummel, Kalkbrenner, Moscheles and Ries. It is hard to reproduce this intimate yet fragile glittering tone on a Steinway or Yamaha. Here again Chopin magically transforms the Classical into the Romantic style.\n\nNadia Boulanger was once asked what made a great as opposed to an excellent performance of a piano work. She answered 'I cannot tell you that. It is something I cannot describe in words. A magical element descends.'\n\nI wrote of Kate Liu and her performance of the E minor concerto during the 17th International Fryderyk Chopin Competition, Warsaw, 1-23 October 2015, the lineaments of which I have no reason to alter:\n\nHer phrasing was supremely and naturally musical in the deepest sense of that word. It moved through so many moods of varied colour, a journey through a chiaroscuro tonal palette. The effect was as if the young Chopin, hopelessly in love, was thoughtfully wandering during a Polish golden October through a sun-dappled birch forest of his beloved Mazovian countryside. The phantoms of Hummel, Ries, Mozart, Field, Moscheles and even Paganini all stood modestly at Kate Liu's shoulder, she being aware of them with perfect taste and understanding - the gestures of Chopin's musical expression at that time accurately placed within their historical context. At one moment poetical with subdued refinement yet at another strong, powerful and masculine.\n\nHearing her open the Maestoso of the concerto was rather an emotional moment for me. The magic remains in the sheer poetry she manages to express from the outset of this first Chopin concerto. As it progressed we were ensnared once again by her web of poetry - glowing tone, sensitivity of touch and majestic elegance of conception. Her phrasing and rubato are unforgettable in the musical meaning she brings to the work. Each Chopinesque life uncertainty expressed is answered with a struggle towards confidence in destiny.\n\nA singing full bel canto tone in the affecting Larghetto was full of poetry and taken at just the right tempo. The piano’s entrance is described by the Polish poet Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz as if it ‘sounds like the opening of a gate to some haven of love and peace’. In many ways you could say that the whole work revolves around this movement. The emotions of love rising and falling away express a degree of sensibility quite beyond the range of words and language to engage. Here was the true nature of adolescent love, cloudless and illusioned before the tigers of sexual experience and betrayal begin their feast. The breath of young idealistic love is here unsullied in its nature.\n\nI always think of the sentiments contained in the 1820 poem by John Keats La Belle Dame Sans Merci when I hear this music with its occasional passionate interjections\n\nI met a lady in the meads,\n\nFull beautiful—a faery’s child,\n\nHer hair was long, her foot was light,\n\nAnd her eyes were wild.\n\nI made a garland for her head,\n\nAnd bracelets too, and fragrant zone;\n\nShe looked at me as she did love,\n\nAnd made sweet moan.\n\nI set her on my pacing steed,\n\nAnd nothing else saw all day long,\n\nFor sidelong would she bend, and sing\n\nA faery’s song.\n\nFrom this dreamscape emerges the river of life, tremendous joy, energy and drive in the Allegro vivace final movement, a Rondo, written in the exuberant style of a dance of kujawiak provenance. How Chopin must have loved the bucolic nature of the Polish countryside and its music!\n\nThe Chopin extension of the Hummel piano concerto is here fully realized. Melody and bravura figuration wonderfully and authoritatively brought off by Liu with great balance of formal structure. This composition that lies between Mozart, Hummel and the style brillante was wonderfully executed, as were the masculine gestures towards the concertos of Weber (following the cor de signal for example). Liu gave us cascades of pearls, the true le son jeu perlé characteristic of the style brillante, lightness, delicacy, charm, sonority, purity, precision and rippling execution.\n\nThis was an immanent musical experience by the pianist lost in her own world of dreams. Oh yes, far indeed from Chopin's dreaded 'exhalations of the crowd'. The silence as she played indicated she communicated these tenuous and subtle feelings deep into the heart of every member of the audience.\n\nNever forget the myth of Orpheus. The making of music is the cultivation and creation of magic not simply a series of beautiful sounds strung together.\n\nA satisfying performance in every way expressing the dreams, melancholy, illusions and delights of youth.\n\n25.08.22\n\nThursday\n\n18:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nPerformer\n\nSzymon Nehring piano\n\nWinner of the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition 2017 and a laureate of the International Fryderyk Chopin Competition in Warsaw in 2015\n\nProgram\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nNocturne in E flat major Op. 55 No. 2\n\nThe music of the Chopin nocturne, even if derived from the mood of John Field, has fascinated and continues to seduce the listener over the passing decades. The Paris critic, composer and musicologist Hippolyte Barbedette (1827-1901), one of Chopin’s first biographers wrote in 1861: ‘Chopin’s nocturnes are perhaps his greatest claim to fame; they are his most perfect works’. This was the conception of them in France in the mid nineteenth century. ‘That loftiness of ideas, purity of form and almost invariably that stamp of dreamy melancholy’.\n\nI did not feel Nehring approached this work in quite the spirit of improvisation and meditation on change. I felt it rather too certain and declamatory as the internal life of it rose and fell, although emotionally affecting poetry did emerge towards the conclusion.\n\nPolonaise-Fantasy in A flat major Op. 61\n\nHere we were given a lovely improvisatory feel to the opening of a piece marked maestoso and written in what has become known as Chopin's 'late style'. The work gave the composer endless difficulties and he made multiple sketches. This work in the ‘late style’ was written during a period of great suffering and unhappiness. He labored over its composition and what emerged is one of his most complex works both pianistically and emotionally. There is a curious feeling of harmonic examination in the search for certainty in life.\n\nNehring built an increasing feeling of direction and focus until we entered fully on a remarkable journey across Chopin's dream landscapes, passing through endless key changes. Nehring used the power of silence most expressively from the subdued to the agitated. The work rose on riverine waves of nostalgia and doubt until the shores of reality and certainty were achieved through willpower, yet these victories were scarcely celebrated.\n\nPublished in 1846, the work was not well received. Jan Zdzisław Jachimecki, a Polish musicologist, musical critic and composer wrote: ‘the piano speaks here in a language not previously known’. It took years for the work to be accepted as significant rather than pathological. The English musicologist Arthur Hedley spoke of the ‘spirit that breathes’ in Chopin’s polonaises: ‘pride in the past, lamentation for the present, hope for the future’. I felt all these qualities in Nehring's fine performance\n\nMazurka in B major Op. 56 No. 1\n\nMazurka in C major Op. 56 No. 2\n\nMazurka in C minor Op. 56 No. 3\n\nThese three Chopin Mazurkas were performed with rich polyphony and counterpoint that raised their conception to a rather magnificent status and dimension. They were idiomatically Polish which clearly emerged as Nehring explored the adventurous harmonic modulations, applied perceptive phrasing and rubato. Often they were quite Sarmatian in atmosphere, redolent with the perfumes of Sarmatia. This notion is not well understood by 'foreigners' but is of great importance in understanding Polish culture.\n\nhttps://www.wilanow-palac.pl/sarmatism.html\n\nAndante spianato and Grande Polonaise Brillante in E flat major Op. 22\n\nCertainly the Andante was spianato (smooth) but could have been a little more overtly expressive for this romantic soul. However, there was great deal of beautiful singing legato and cantabile in his playing. Chopin often used to perform this work alone in a notably expressive manner.\n\nThe Grande polonaise brillante could have been far lighter and more 'sparkling'. I felt it slightly dynamically exaggerated and somewhat rushed rather than balanced with panache and élan.\n\nThe 19th century poet and critic Casimir Brodziński described the polonaise:\n\nThe polonaise breathes and paints the whole national character; the music of this dance, while admitting much art, combines something martial with a sweetness marked by the simplicity of manners of an agricultural people…….Our fathers danced it with a marvellous ability and a gravity full of nobleness; the dancer, making gliding steps with energy, but without skips, and caressing his moustache, varied his movements by the position of his sabre, of his cap, and of his tucked-up coat sleeves, distinctive signs of a free man and a warlike citizen.’\n\nThis work is a great challenge for pianists. I found his account somewhat over-pedalled although it certainly carried the energetic spirit of this national dance. In the day of say Hummel, this style was characterized by lightness, delicacy, charm, sonority, purity, precision and a rippling execution resembling pearls – le son perlé. This work could only have been composed in a state of happiness and youthful ‘sweet sorrows’ living in his native land. Nehring could have communicated these sound qualities a little more. A triumphant conclusion of power and strength elicited cheering and applause from the enthusiastic audience.\n\nOne of the greatest performances I have heard was by the young outstanding Polish pianist Wojciech Świtała for Katowice Radio many years ago now.\n\nClaude Debussy (1862-1918)\n\nPreludes Livre 1, No. 1-6 (1910)\n\n1.

Nehring performed this work in as seductive and sensual a manner as you could wish.\n\nEvening Harmony\n\nNow is the time when trembling on its stem\n\nEach flower fades away like incense;\n\nSounds and scents turn in the evening air;\n\nA melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness!\n\nEach flower fades away like incense;\n\nThe violin thrills like a tortured heart;\n\nA melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness!\n\nThe sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place.\n\nThe violin thrills like a tortured heart,\n\nA tender heart, hating the wide black void.\n\nThe sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place;\n\nThe sun drowns itself in its own clotting blood.\n\nA tender heart, boring the wide black void,\n\nGathers all trace from the pellucid past.\n\nThe sun drowns itself in clotting blood.\n\nLike the Host shines O your memory in me!\n\n— Geoffrey Wagner, Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire (NY: Grove Press, 1974)\n\n5. Les collines d'Anacapri: Très modéré\n\n(The Hills of Anacapri)\n\nAnacapri - such marvellous colour contrasts in his performance. Of course, Anacapri was utterly different when Debussy visited it before the mass tourism of 2022.\n\n6. Des pas sur la neige: Triste et lent\n\n(Footsteps in the Snow)\n\nSuch an effective creation of a bleak, snowy landscape with solitary footsteps was created by Nehring.\n\nI felt Nehring's performance of Debussy to be impressionistic and very fine in its control of colour, timbre and the creation of illusion.\n\nHerman Nehring\n\nPrelude in E flat minor No. 1\n\nPrelude in A major No. 2\n\nPrelude in D major No. 3\n\nThe biggest riddle of that evening, Herman Nehring's Preludes , turned out to be a high-quality collection of compositions. If the announcer presented these works as a lost cycle from Szymanowski's early works, I would rather believe him. The stylistics of these works could reach, on the one hand, Central European expressionism, and on the other ... the coasts of Andalusia? [Igor Tobicki in Ruch Muzyczny May 2022]\n\nThese works, unknown to me, are by the the highly talented great-great grandfather, Herman Nehring, (also unknown to me), of this pianist Szymon Nehring. They are interesting and diverting compositions that become winningly lyrical at times.\n\nKarol Szymanowski\n\nA wonderful photograph of the young\n\nKarol Szymanowski, Paweł Kochański and Grzegorz Fitelberg, 1910\n\n(Photograph with dedications to Zofia Bernstein-Meyer.

There were extreme contrasts of mood and atmosphere here, exploited fully by Nehring in this marvelous piece of music.\n\nHe clearly has a very particular creative affinity with the music of Szymanowski and is exceptionally persuasive emotionally with it in performance.\n\nEncore\n\nAn incredibly spectacular, fiendishly demanding, entirely unexpected and virtuosic Mendelssohn/ Liszt/ Horowitz/ Volodos Wedding March. Tumultuous and wild cheering, immediate standing ovation and applause.\n\nA fine end to a musically very rewarding recital that indicates such promising artistic development in Szymon Nehring.\n\n24.08.22\n\nWednesday\n\n21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nRecital of Songs\n\nPerformers:\n\nMatthias Goerne baritone\n\nLeif Ove Andsnes piano\n\nProgram\n\nFranz Schubert\n\nWinterreise Op. 89, D 911\n\nWinterreise (Winter Journey) was composed within two years of Schubert's death in 1827. Many regard it as the greatest song cycle of all. In this work, at that time, Schubert was pushing the bounds of harmonic adventurism to a degree that made acceptance of the cycle troublesome to contemporary ears.\n\nDer Lindenbaum, one of the most folkloric and lyrical songs, was, however, well received. The sensitive poems are by the German lyric poet Johann Müller (1794-1827). He is known as the author of the great Schubert song cycles Die schöne Müllerin (1823) and Winterreise (1828). The poetry is deeply moving in its sense of nostalgic loss of love, anger at infidelity, the power of Nature to regenerate, sensual passion and existentialist anguish. The melodic line is focused almost exclusively on declamation as Schubert sets one note per syllable throughout almost all the 24 songs.\n\nIt is impossible to do justice to such a masterpiece as Winterreise in this type of critical assessment, suffice to say that in Schubert's day in public these songs would have been more likely to be performed individually that in complete cycles. Certainly Schubert performed the complete cycle for intimate groups of his friends. Their effectiveness as a philosophical, poetic statement is immensely enhanced when performed as a cycle of songs.\n\nMatthias Goerne is a very popular baritone in Poland. He brought a (dare I say in 2022) a deep vein of masculine maturity, experience and German seriousness of purpose to this performance. This voice, so rich in timbre and his mild theatrical acting, held the audience attention almost hypnotically. The dark despair, alienation and disillusionment of the last songs was courageously confronted and movingly presented. The anguish of the soul, punctuated by oh so pregnant silences, was deeply unsettling to the heart. Leif Ove Andsnes provided an understated, illuminating and communicative piano support to the point of achieving an uncanny symbiosis of emotion with Goerne.\n\nThe haunting message in the final song Der Leiermann is one of alienation and the derangement of sanity. The young man of Die Schöne Müllerin embraces death whilst the poet of Winterreise must continue with life and barefoot survival even on icy paths. He turns to the ominously melodic, utterly deprived hurdy-gurdy man and joins him in a type of distorted ghostly melodic euphoria. I felt these performers expressively captured the nature of the disinherited human mind, a vision that pervades Winterreise and that surely was Schubert's intention to communicate.\n\n24.08.22\n\nWednesday\n\n18:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nPerformers:\n\nAlena Baeva violin\n\nDmitry Ablogin period piano\n\nJan Lisiecki period piano\n\nMarek Moś conductor\n\nOrchestra of the Eighteenth Century\n\nProgram\n\nHenryk Wieniawski (1835-1880)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 1 in F sharp minor Op. 14 (1852)\n\nHenryk Wieniawski (1835-1880)\n\nHenryk Wieniawski was a Polish virtuoso violinist, composer and pedagogue who is regarded as one of the greatest violinists in history. He wrote two highly technically demanding violin concertos, the second of which (in D minor, 1862) is more often performed than the first we heard this evening (in F-sharp minor, performed on October 27 in Leipzig in 1853).\n\nBaeva and this orchestra produced a marvelously burnished and cohesive sound form the outset of the Allegro moderato. Baeva launched into this formidable opening movement with passion and total commitment. The tempo allowed the theme to sing and take flight. Her phrasing always speaks so intelligibly and musically quite apart from the sheer visceral excitement she manages to communicate.\n\nShe overcame any technical challenge effortlessly and her deeply expressive playing (with the support of this revivified orchestra and conductor) was always most affecting to the heart and soul. The cadenza to the first movement was superb and the love song she sang for us, quite unforgettable, moving and seductive.\n\nAn eloquent lyricism where the heart reaches out to encounter the loved one infused the Pregiera (prayer).Larghetto with its rich violin texture and colour.
