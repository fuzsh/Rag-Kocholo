The title character, played by Ewa Bandrowska-Turska, is a mountain maiden who spurns her childhood sweetheart in favor of a worldly nobleman. Seduced and abandoned by the aristocrat, Halka tries to return to her old boyfriend, but he will have nothing to do with her. Left alone with an illegitimate child, Halka has no choice but to end it all, which she does after one of her periodic ramblings across a huge mountain valley (which appears several times in the film, perhaps symbolically). For its American premiere, Halka was screened at the Belmont Theater, New York City's showcase for Polish-language films."
