        "text": "Stories told in a portrait – Elżbieta Towarnicka\n\nOn April 27, 2017, as part of the photographic series ‘Stories told in a portrait’, we were implementing a portrait session of the world-famous Polish soprano Elżbieta Towarnicka in Krakow.\n\nA portrait is a recording of human energy during a photo session. When portraying Elżbieta Towarnicka’s stars, it’s always imperative for me to take pictures efficiently. In general, everything is planned down to the smallest detail.\n\nIt was so this time, so the photos went very smoothly. We easily established a thread of agreement, and at the scheduled time we were already after the session. Ms. Elżbieta Towarnicka has experience in working with a lens, but how many people do not believe that you can go out beautifully in the pictures. I have a different opinion. The effects of our work can be seen below.\n\nImmediately after the pictures were finished, it turned out that the next session was delayed, which gave me a chance to have an interesting conversation with Ms. Elizabeth. Diva turned out to be a very warm and available person. It was difficult for us to end the conversation. Such moments during which I have the opportunity to talk to photographed people is a great bonus in my work and something that drives me to continue working.\n\nThe session accompanied the memorial meeting dedicated to Piotr Skrzynecki on the 20th anniversary of his death, to which he invited Artists and Friends from “Piwnica pod Baranami” to the Vis-à-Vis cafe on the Main Square to sing the song “Lilies of the valley, or a pet” written shortly after his departure (Jan Kanty Pawluśkiewicz – music, vocal; Jan Nowicki – words, vocal; Grzegorz Turnau – vocal; Elżbieta Towarnicka – soprano).\n\nThe session took place near Vis-à-Vis in a mobile photo studio at Cafe Europejska Restaurant in Krakow.\n\nMake-up performed by: Zuza Zakrzewska.\n\nOrganization of the session: Monika Muracka.\n\nWe especially thank the artist’s manager, Wiktor Czajkowski, for his assistance during the project.\n\nBiography\n\nElżbieta Towarnicka (soprano) was born in Wrocław. She comes from an artistic family, her grandfather, Piotr Towarnicki was an organist, her sister, Alina Towarnicka-Niedźwiedz, worked for years as a ballerina of the Krakow Opera, and Eugeniusz Towarnicki (a distant relative) is the author of the textbook “School for Flute” known among flutists. Gifted with absolute musical ear while studying at the State Higher School of Music (now the Academy of Music in Krakow) began cooperation with the Krakow Opera (then operating under the name Krakow Music Theater and Opera and Operetta in Krakow), were soon began to create the main soprano parts in such operas such as “La Bohème”, “Tosca” by Giacomo Puccini, “Pearl Hunters” by Georges Bizet, “Traviata” by Rigoletto Giuseppe Verdi, “Freelancer” by Carl Maria von Weber, “King Roger” by Karol Szymanowski, “Orpheus and Euridice” by Christoph Willibald Gluck, “Dydon and Aeneas” by Henry Purcell.\n\nEven before obtaining her diploma in Krakow, PWSM was the laureate of the 1st Polish National Competition Adam Didur in Bytom (3rd prize and the prize of the Main Board of the Association of Polish Musicians for the best performance of works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). She has made numerous recordings for the needs of Polish Radio and analog records. Twice nominated for the Fryderyk Polish Phonographic Industry Award.\n\nCurrently, Elżbieta Towarnicka cooperates with all philharmonics in Poland, regularly gives concerts in the largest halls of England, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Spain, Japan, Canada, Lithuania, Macedonia, Germany, Russia, the United States, Sweden, Ukraine and Italy (including the legendary La Scala). She has made many recordings of contemporary music while working with outstanding composers: Krzesimir Dębski, Henryk Mikołaj Górecki, and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Wojciech Kilar, Eugeniusz Knapik, Zygmunt Konieczny, Michał Lorenc, Jacek Ostaszewski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Zbigniew Preisner and Others.\n\nA wider audience, however, knows Elżbieta Towarnicka primarily from film music – performance of music for the films: “Avalon” (dir. Mamoru Oshii), “De Aegypto” (dir. Jolanta Ptaszyńska), “Decalogue”, “The Double Life of Veronica”, “Three Colors – Red and Blue “(dir. Krzysztof Kieślowski),” Prominent “(dir.

Terrence Malick), “Ono” (dir. Małgorzata Szumowska), “Papusza” (dir. Joanna Kos-Krauze and Krzysztof Krauze), “Great Beauty” (dir. Paolo Sorrentino). An important place in the artist’s repertoire is also occupied by the works of Jan Kante Pawluśkiewicz [among others: “Apimondia Mater” (1987), “Nieszpory Ludźmierskie” (1992), “Harfy Papusza” (1994), “Amat vita” (1998), ” The Road, Love, Life “(1999),” Josaphat’s Gardens “(2002),” The Lord Has Crossed This Earth “(2005),” Venetian Tales of Hell and Paradise “(2008),” Joy of Mercy “(2009) and Others ].\n\nAlbums with her voice are sold in thousands of copies around the world, which puts the artist at the forefront of the best and most successful singers.\n\nMore information about the artist, news about concerts with her participation and publications can be followed at Towarnicka.com and on the official Fanpage facebook.com/etowarnicka.\n\nBy sending a link to the official music video of the song “Lilies of the valley, lilac or pet” (CLICK),, I invite you to view portraits of other Artists taken that day in Krakow:"
