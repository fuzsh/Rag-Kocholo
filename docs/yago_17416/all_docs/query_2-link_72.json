        "text": "For this series, which starts on 1 January 2022 and replaces and continues the “Legendary Shorts” series, we searched the web for all the films that were screened in Oberhausen since the first festival in 1954 and are now presenting our finds in chronological order: Films that may not have been so much in the limelight, but that have also marked both our festival history and the history of short film.\n\nThe animated film ZUCKERKANDL by the legendary animators’ couple John and Faith Hubley (USA 1968) is a profile of the fictitious philosopher Alexander Zuckerkandl which can easily be interpreted as a parody on Sigmund Freud. It was made into a comic book in the same year and screened in Oberhausen in 1970.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: This film contains stroboscope effects that can trigger epileptic seizures!\n\nAn early experiment with computer-aided animation, AROUND PERCEPTION by Pierre Hébert, produced in Canada in 1968, was screened in Oberhausen in 1970. It shows a succession of geometric forms in vivid colour, with sound effects created by registering sound shapes directly on the soundtrack. Hébert worked at the National Film Board of Canada from 1965 to 1999 and is known for his cross-disciplinary and experimental approach to animation.\n\nTHE BALLAD OF CROWFOOT from 1968 is a montage of photos, etchings and newspaper clippings from archives documenting the history of the First Peoples of Canada and the legendary Chief Crowfoot. It’s set to a ballad written and performed by Mi’kmaq singer and songwriter Willie Dunn. Dunn also directed, working with a crew of Canadian Indians. In 1970, it was screened in Oberhausen. Thanks to the National Film Board of Canada for making it available on YouTube!\n\nHungarian filmmaker Zoltán Huszárik is considered one of the greatest visual poets of Hungarian cinema. CAPRICCIO from 1970, produced at the famous Béla Balázs Studios, is a poetic and experimental narrative of a rural winter, but also an allegory on life and death as embodied by snowmen, not without an element of tongue-in-cheek humour. It was screened in Oberhausen in 1970.\n\nJiří Brdečka was a Czech writer, animator and film director. His animation METAMORFEUS from 1969 is a retelling of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice which looks as if ancient murals and mosaics had come to life and was indeed based on frescos from Pompeii. The film was screened in Oberhausen in 1970.\n\nThe Dutch production A FAN by Franz Zwartjes from 1968, screened in Oberhausen in 1969, was one of the forerunners of the emergence of so-called experimental cinema in the 1970s. Zwartjes produced a large body of work that is rarely remembered today, dealing with his traumas and obsessions. His rapid, repetitive editing style is very marked in this short black and white piece and creates a minimalist and haunting portrait of his protagonist.\n\nJohn Whitney Sr. was an American animator, composer and inventor, widely considered to be one of the fathers of computer animation. He made a number of versions of PERMUTATIONS, including the 1969 version which was screened in Oberhausen in 1969. Among his most famous works were the animated title and dream sequences from Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film VERTIGO, which he collaborated on with the graphic designer Saul Bass. In 1960, he founded Motion Graphics Incorporated, which used a mechanical analogue computer of his own invention to create motion picture and television title sequences and commercials.\n\nJan Švankmajer was a frequent guest in Oberhausen with his surrealist short films. BYT (The Flat) from 1968 was screened in 1969 and won the Grand Prize of the International Jury. BYT is one of his darkest shorts, showing a man trapped in an apartment where the objects revolt against him. In a bleak ending, the man resigns himself to defeat.\n\nThe British production DARLING, DO YOU LOVE ME? by Martin Sharp and Bob Whitaker from 1968 stars a pre-“Female Eunuch” Germain Greer, who parodies her media persona as a terrifying woman who alternately cajoles, pursues and assaults a mild little man with cries of \"Darling, do you love me?\" until he succumbs to her strangling hands. The directors were well known for their work in graphic design: Sharp for his ferocious cartoons in the satirical magazine Oz, Whittaker for his photography on various Beatles album covers. The film was screened in Oberhausen in 1969.\n\nA DANCE PARTY IN THE KINGDOM OF LILLIPUT, a Japanese production from 1964 by Takahiko Iimura, was screened in Oberhausen in 1969. This absurd experimental comedy featuring Sho Kazakura was inspired by Franz Kafka and consists of a number of short scenes and chapters – “an anthology of discontinuous happenings and events”, as the director put it.\n\nThe Polish production SCHODY (Stairs) by Stefan Schabenbeck from 1968 was screened in Oberhausen in 1969. It’s a clay animation showing a man who gets lost in a labyrinth of stairs that grows more and more reminiscent of the paintings of M.C. Escher. Schabenbeck is an independent Polish animator who made a number of shorts in different animation techniques.\n\nAfter a short festival break, Oberhausen Revisited returns with Hayashi Seiichi’s short animation KAGE (Shadow) from 1968, which was screened in Oberhausen in 1969 – a film about the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, eerily and disconcertingly combined with a rather happy-sounding pop song by The Peanuts. Hayashi was a comic artist for the magazine Caro and became well-known for his manga series Red Colored Elegy, published in Japan from 1970 to 1971 and released in North America in 2008.\n\nDeath as an opponent in badminton, bird droppings as a bad omen and savior, and dialogues in a fantasy language. The short film DE DÜVA (The Dove, 1968) by the American filmmakers George Coe and Anthony Lover is a humorous, absurd parody of some of the best-known films by the Swede Ingmar Bergman, including SMULTRONSTÄLLET (Wild Strawberries, 1957) and DET SJUNDE INSEGLET (The Seventh Seal, 1957). DE DÜVA was screened in Oberhausen in 1969.\n\nIn PIONIRI MALENI (Little Pioneers), Serbian filmmaker Želimir Žilnik, one of the major representatives of the Yugoslavian Black Wave of the 1960s, portrays children in former Yugoslavia in the 1960s, contrasting the life socially neglected children with a TV show full of happy children. The film was shown in Oberhausen in 1968, the year of production.\n\nA restless car ride that ends in a heart attack: In ZAWAŁ SERCA (Heart Attack, 1967), the film character's racing heart seems to communicate itself directly to the audience. The film was shown in Oberhausen in 1968. Wojciech Wiszniewski is considered one of the most interesting representatives of the creative movement in Polish documentary film. One of his best-known short films - ELEMENTARZ (ABC Book, 1976) - was kept under wraps by the Polish censors and only released after his death.\n\nAn early short film by Claude Miller, who later enjoyed success with feature films such as THE LITTLE THIEF and GARDE À Vue (also known as THE INQUISITOR). In JULIET DANS PARIS (Juliet in Paris, 1967), he tells the story of a young student who finds herself in strange and bloody situations in Paris. The leading actress Juliet Berto also played in Jacques Rivette's fantastic CÉLINE AND JULIE GO BOATING from 1974. JULIET DANS PARIS was shown in Oberhausen in 1968.\n\nWhy is fortune so capricious? asks Danish filmmaker Jørgen Leth in his cult film DET PERFEKTE MENNESKE (The Perfect Human, 1967). For 13 minutes a Danish couple performs everyday rituals – as a model of an illusory perfect human being. In 1968, the film won a main prize of the International Jury and the Prize of the City of Oberhausen at our festival.\n\nUNA VITA IN SCATOLA (Life in a Tin), Italy 1967, by Bruno Bozzetto packs the whole cycle of life into six minutes of animation. Bozzetto is a cartoon animator and director whose shorts were often of a political and satirical nature, though he is best-known for creating Mr. Rossi, a hapless little man who appears in a number of his short films and three feature-length films. This film was screened in Oberhausen in 1968.\n\nThe Polish experimental animation CZAR KÓŁEK (The Charm of the Wheels, 1966) by Kazimierz Urbański uses cut-outs on a background of non-camera effects, accompanied by music by Krzysztof Penderecki. A swarm of locusts teases a herd of horses, a wheeled vehicle arrives, shapes change into motorcycles, images of industrial production appear, while the film becomes more and more dynamic. Urbanski was an animation filmmaker, theorist and educator who was particularly interested in studies of movement.\n\nTHE POP SHOW from 1967 is one of Fred Mogubgub’s best-known films – a quick collage of pop icons of the late 1960s, featuring Gloria Steinem, who starts off drinking Coca Cola and goes on to more and more bizarre beverages. It was screened in Oberhausen in 1967 and won a Main Prize of the International Jury.\n\nMUHA (The Fly) by Aleksandar Marks and Vladimir Jutriša (1967) comes from Zagreb Film and was screened in Oberhausen in 1967, where it won the Grand Prize of the International Jury. A man is irritated by a tiny fly and tries unsuccessfully to squash it. Eventually the fly grows so big it shatters the scene and the film almost turns into a horror movie. Finally, the man and the fly start to negotiate.\n\nTHE GREAT SOCIETY by Fred Mogubgub from 1967 is a beautiful example of 1960s pop art – a parade of consumer goods set to the “Battle Hymn of the Republic”. It’s produced in Mogubgub’s typical style of quick jump cuts and works almost like a subliminal commercial – and indeed Mogubgub was not only close to the New York pop art movement but also a successful advertiser. This film was screened in Oberhausen in 1967.\n\nA prisoner and a guard interact in KLATKI (Cages) by Mirosław Kijowicz, a Polish production from 1967. It’s an allegory about captivity and freedom, animated in simple lines and with a beautiful jazz soundtrack. The film was screened in Oberhausen in 1967 as part of the Polish programme, which won a Special Mention from the International Jury.\n\nThe year ends with LES ESCARGOTS (The Snails) by René Laloux and Roland Topor from 1966, a multiple award-winning animation in which a hapless farmer on a distant planetoid strives in vain to make his vegetables flourish. The film was screened in Oberhausen in 1967. Laloux is best known for his 1973 surreal classic LA PLANÈTE SAUVAGE (Fantastic Planet), another collaboration with Topor.\n\nCHRISTMAS CRACKER by Norman McLaren is the perfect fit for this holiday – a short animation in three differently animated segments that take a playful look at Christmas: a rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" in which paper cut-out figures dance, a dime-store rodeo of tin toys, and a story of decorating the perfect Christmas tree. This film received multiple awards and an Oscar nomination and was screened in Oberhausen in 1966.\n\nTONARI NO YAROU (The Man Next Door) by one of the pioneers of Japanese experimental animation, Yoji Kuri, was produced in 1965 and screened in Oberhausen in 1966. A man is disturbed by the noise from the other side of the wall, and his solution does not work out – a black comedy in Kuri’s typical cartoonish style.\n\nRUKA (The Hand) from 1965 was the last short animation released by Czech sculptor and animation filmmaker Jiří Trnka. A powerful metaphor of repression, which was aimed by Trnka at the communist oppression, it won a Grand Prize of the International Jury in Oberhausen in 1966, but remained banned in the Czech Republic until the end of communism.\n\nTHE SECRET CINEMA, “a paranoid fantasy” by Paul Bartel from 1966, is about a woman who is manipulated by people around her so a director can film her to screen the results in a theatre. Shown in Oberhausen in 1967, it’s the debut film of the director who went on to make, among others, EATING RAOUL (1982) or SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS (1989).\n\nAND MILES TO GO by S. Sukhdev, an Indian production from 1967, is a propaganda film “dedicated to all the forces of rationalist thought that are opposed to the path of violence” and a call to the citizens of India to be active participants in the future of their country.\n\nMOSAIC is a wonderfully simple and yet complex experimental animation by Norman McLaren and Evelyn Lambart from 1965, which was screened in Oberhausen in 1966. A single square multiplies and goes through ever more complex movements and variations, to a precise and spare score by the master himself.\n\n\"This is the story of a ship and of a sports delegation whom the ENEMY tried to stop from participating in the Tenth Central American and Caribbean Games.\" In his 1966 documentary CERRO PELADO, Santiago Álvarez pays tribute to Cuba’s sporting triumphs despite US attempts to prevent the Cuban athletes from participating in the games.\n\n60 CYCLES by Jean-Claude Labrecque, a Canadian production from 1965, tracks the Tour du St. Laurent bicycle race.

It was his first completed work; at the time, Cahiers du Cinéma called it “one of the most beautiful films of this festival […] Mamoun Hassan has succeeded in creating a world in which the feelings of solitude and sadness – but also of joy and love – become tangible.” Hassan’s career later led him away from directing to become Head of the BFI Production Board in the 1970s, Managing Director of the NFFC in the 1980s and Head of the Directing Department at the National Film and Television School.\n\nWalerian Borowzcyk’s LES JEUX DES ANGES from 1964 is widely regarded as his masterpiece.

Gross is perhaps best known for his adaptations of children’s characters from books and films but maintained an interest in experimental film throughout his career and established several awards for young filmmakers in this field.\n\nSkyscraper (USA, 1959) is another experimental short film by Shirley Clarke, documenting the construction of a new skyscraper, the Tishman building on prestigious Fifth Avenue. The film was nominated for an Oscar and won the Venice Film Festival award and several other awards. This film was also shown at our festival in 1960.\n\nBridges-Go-Round (USA, 1958) by Shirley Clarke is an experimental work, consisting of a montage of images of New York’s various bridges. With two different soundtracks the film gives the bridges either the image of an urban jungle (jazz version by Teo Macero) or an alien landscape (electro-acoustic version by Louis & Bebe Barron). Screened in Oberhausen in 1960. This link shows both versions.\n\nFLEBUS (USA, 1957) by Ernest Pintoff and Gene Deitch and narrated by Allen Swift is about Flebus, whom everyone likes, but who grows desperate when he meets the one person who can’t stand him. The film was screened at our festival in 1959.\n\nWith FREE RADICALS (USA, 1958) Len Lye participated in our festival in 1959. This black and white animated short film is said to be one of Lyes best works. The film won second prize at the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels and in 2008 Free Radicals was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress as a “classic film” that it would “preserve for all time.”\n\nTHE JUGGLER OF OUR LADY (USA 1957) by Al Kouzel and Gene Deitch is an animated adaptation of the eponymous book by R.O. Blechman, narrated by Boris Karloff, about a juggler who decides to become an ascetic and then a monk. Kouzel worked at Terrytoons and directed the film, while Deitch was known for his illustrations and animations, including for Tom and Jerry and Popeye.\n\nUNDER NIGHT STREETS (GB 1958) by Ralph Keene is a documentary film about the track workers and track cleaners who maintain the London Underground system every night, while the trains are not running. Keene, a well-known documentary filmmaker, won the Special Mention of the International Jury at our festival in 1959.\n\nHARLEM WEDNESDAY by Faith and John Hubley (USA 1959) was screened at our festival in 1959, showing the paintings of Gregorio Prestopino, which convey the sights and sounds of a day in Harlem to the music of Benny Carter. The Hubleys were known for their experimental film works and won several Oscars for their short films.\n\nHIGHWAY 1958 by Hilary Harris (USA 1958) was screened at our festival in 1959 - a fast moving Road Movie, shot from a moving car. Harris, who is regarded as one of the pioneers of time-lapse film, won a Bronze Medal for his work at the International Experimental Film Festival in Brussels in 1958.\n\nWe screened Joan and Peter Foldes’s ANIMATED GENESIS from 1952 for the first time in 1959. This short, a rough outline of the story of creation and evolution, is often abstract and almost psychedelic. It received the ‘Prix pour la couleur - court métrage’ at Cannes in 1952 – a prize for the best colour short.\n\nPeter Burness’s PINK AND BLUE BLUES from 1952 was screened in Oberhausen in 1959. It is one of the many productions centering on the cartoon figure of Mr. Magoo, a short-sighted elderly gentleman whose misfortunes largely stem from his poor eyesight. This short was nominated for Best Short Subject at the 1953 Academy Awards.\n\nContinuing after our festival break with Kenneth Anger’s FIREWORKS from 1947, screened in Oberhausen in 1959, is a milestone of gay cinema. This dream-like, experimental short which is “widely regarded as the first gay narrative film ever made in the U.S.” (Matthew Hays) stars the director himself as the main character. The film contains strong homoerotic imagery, coupled with elements of surrealism and horror.\n\nKarel Zeman’s PAN PROKOUK VYNÁLEZCEM (Mr. Prokouk, the Inventor), originally from 1949 and screened at our festival in 1958, is one of several films about the titular character created by the director. The strikingly detailed and fluid depiction of small machinery stands out in this black-and-white stop-motion film.\n\nIon Popescu-Gopo’s film SCURTĂ ISTORIE (A Brief History) from 1956 is a humorous and, indeed, brief animation that tells a story of natural and human history. We screened this film in 1958, one year after it won a Palme d’Or at Cannes for the best short film.\n\nAnother live-action film directed by Norman McLaren and animated by Evelyn Lambart, A CHAIRY TALE from 1957 is part pixilation, part reminiscent of puppet animation. The film tells the story of a man who tries to sit down on a chair that repeatedly dodges his attempts. Reminiscent of silent-film era slapstick, this short was screened at our festival in 1958, and was nominated in the category “Short Subject (Live Action)” at the Oscars that same year.\n\nAn unusual festival entry, Ward Kimball’s MAN IN SPACE from 1955 is an episode from the television show ‘Disneyland’ and was shown at our festival in 1958. Walt Disney himself addresses the viewer, as does the director. The film, made even before Sputnik 1 was launched, explores the topic of manned space travel and explains scientific concepts and technological advances through animation. Not only does the film strive for credibility by interviewing pioneering engineers; our contemporary knowledge gleaned from years of manned space travel makes this film and its predictions also an intriguing watch, one that was nominated as Best Documentary Short at the 1957 Oscars.\n\nA little known fact about our festival is that there simply was no edition in 1957. Therefore we are now continuing our journey through our festival years with an entry from 1958: Max de Haas’s MASKERAGE. Filmed at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, the film shows the museum’s extensive collection of masks from colonised nations. Through the use of lighting and sound, the masks appear as objects of terror - an act of Othering other cultures’ means of artistic expression that contemporary viewers may find insensitive. Nevertheless, the film may function as a foil contributing to the current discourse of repatriation of cultural artefacts.\n\nBřetislav Pojar’s film O SKLENIČKU VÍC (A Drop too Much) from 1954 was screened at our 1956 festival. The stop-motion film, which won the Prix du film de marionettes at Cannes in the year of its release, boasts an astounding level of realism. The sets believably mimic the outdoors as well as interiors, an effect that is enhanced by carefully measured depths in the cinematography.\n\nWe screened Hans Fischerkoesen’s DER SCHNEEMANN (The Snowman) from 1944 for the first time in 1956. Often dubbed the ”German Walt Disney”, Fischerkoesen worked under Hitler, who hoped to build an animation industry rivalling America’s. This film is a product of that period in Fischerkoesen’s career, and indeed one can recognise Disney’s influence on Fischerkoesen in the titular character’s expressively animated physicality.\n\nNorman McLaren’s NEIGHBOURS, screened in 1955, is a brightly coloured, bizarre piece of pixilation. Created with an anti-war message in mind, and twice nominated at the 1952 Oscars (both as Short Subject and documentary Short Subject), the film proved controversial: both for its politics and for being a fictional film that won the documentary category.\n\nToday’s film, Norman McLaren’s A PHANTASY, from 1949 and screened at our 1955 festival, is another entry from the prolific animator’s vast oeuvre. In this film, McLaren layers analogue and synthetic sound over a fluidly animated, liminal dreamscape; creating an elegant piece of animation that is both soothing and unnerving.\n\nAnother wonderful documentary by former Honorary President of our festival, Bert Haanstra. In THE RIVAL WORLD from 1955, screened in Oberhausen in the same year, Bert Haanstra's portrays insects as a complex, disease-bearing species, and the ways in which people across the world try to protect themselves – cutting-edge science in 1955.\n\nToday's film is Roger Blais's CANADA'S ATOM GOES TO WORK, screened at our second festival in 1955. A document of a time when nuclear energy and radiation were not yet primarily associated with environmenta hazards, but World War 2's nuclear attacks were still fresh in the minds of many.\n\nNot many films from our first festival year have been digitized and made available online - and some already featured in the \"Legendary Shorts\" series; so today's film is both the second and final entry from 1954 that we are able to present here. In Norman McLaren's A LITTLE PHANTASY, Arnold Böcklin's famous painting Isle of the Dead is brought to life through animation.\n\nToday, we are kicking off our new series OBERHAUSEN REVISITED. Our Festival History in Shorts, presenting films from our almost 70 years long festival history that we have not previously shared online. Our very first find is Norman McLaren's DOTS, which was screened as part of the programme \"International Avant-garde\" in 1954, our first festival year. In this award-winning film, McLaren employs a fascinating technique of \"painted\" synthetic sound production that was also used in his film LOOP, and thoroughly elaborated on in PEN POINT PERCUSSION; both of which we screened alongside this film."
