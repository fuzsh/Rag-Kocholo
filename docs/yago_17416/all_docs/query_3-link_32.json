        "text": "8:30 pm\n\nPhone content HQ6s02 BERLIN CAMERAROLL, Michel Auder, 2016, Germany, 9 min.\n\nShot on his phone in 2016, Michel Auder’s latest work delves into stasis and acceleration at the same time: a compressed pack of digital memories indiscriminately flickering across the screen in rapid succession, separated by glimpses of nothingness.\n\n8:50 pm\n\nRewizja osobista (Body Search), Andrzej Kostenko and Witold Leszczyński, 1973, Poland, 75 min.\n\nWeaving snippets of Western European commercials into surreal idiosyncrasies of the Polish way of life in the 1970s, this psychological drama (or a psychedelic comedy) is set in and outside a customs office building in the Polish mountains. Five protagonists embark on a cruel journey of self-discovery.\n\nFinal Cut is a documenta 14 film program that takes place at Filmladen Kassel, a small arthouse cinema, during the final week of the exhibition. Daily from September 11–17, beginning at 8:30 pm, it presents a selection of riveting yet seldom-seen films compiled by Artistic Director Adam Szymczyk.\n\nIf not stated otherwise, all screenings show original versions with English subtitles.\n\nEntrance fee: 7.50 € / reduced 7 €. Tickets for the screenings can be purchased from September 7 or on the day of the screenings, daily from 5 pm at Filmladen Kassel. Reservations are not possible."
