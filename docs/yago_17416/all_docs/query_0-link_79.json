        "text": "Photo-conductance of a single Quantum Dot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZimmers, Alexandre; Wang, Hongyue; Lhuillier, Emmanuel; Yu, Qian; Dubertret, Benoit; Aubin, Herve; Ulysse, Christian; LPEM Collaboration\n\nOne promising strategy for the development of nanoscale resonant spin sensors is to measure the spin-dependent photo-current in Quantum Dots (QDots) containing spin-dependent recombination centers. To reach single spin sensitivity will require measurements of the photo-conductance of single QDots. We present here an experimental study of the conductance and photo-conductance of single HgSe QDots as function of drain and gate voltage. The evolution of the differential conductance dI/dV spectrum with the gate voltage demonstrates that single HgSe QDots are forming the junction. The amplitude of the gap measured in the differential conductance spectrum changes with the occupation level. A large inter-band gap, 0,85eV, is observed for the empty QDot, a smaller intra-band gap 0,25eV is observed for the doubly occupied QDot. These gap energies are consistent with the values extracted from the optical absorption spectrum. Upon illuminating the QDot junction, we show that the photo-conductive signal produced by this single QDot can be measured with a simple demodulation method.

This progress report shall treat PL blinking and photo-bleaching both as photochemical events, namely, PL blinking as reversible and photo-bleaching being irreversible ones. Most studies on single-molecule spectroscopy of QDs in literature are related to PL blinking, which invites us to concentrate our discussions on the PL blinking, including its brief history in 20 years, analysis methods, competitive mechanisms and different strategies to battle it. In terms of suppression of the PL blinking, wavefunction confinement-confining photo-generated electron and hole within the core and inner portion of the shell of a core/shell QD-demonstrates significant advantages. This strategy yields nearly non-blinking QDs with their emission peaks covering most part of the visible window. As expected, the resulting QDs from this new strategy also show substantially improved anti-bleaching features. Â© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Low intensity resonant optical excitation of the quantum well was observed to induce an additional forward current at constant forward diode bias, in contrast to the usual sense of the photocurrent in photodiodes and solar cells, as well as an increased electroluminescence intensity. The presence of an electron blocking layer only slightly decreased the magnitude of the photo-induced current at constant forward bias. Photo-modulation at constant forward diode current resulted in a reduced diode bias under optical excitation. We argue that this decrease in diode bias at constant current and the increase in forward diode current at constant applied bias can only be due to additional hot carriers being ejected from the quantum well as a result of an increased Auger recombination rate within the quantum well.\n\nElectrical control of single hole spins in nanowire quantum dots.\n\nPubMed\n\nPribiag, V S; Nadj-Perge, S; Frolov, S M; van den Berg, J W G; van Weperen, I; Plissard, S R; Bakkers, E P A M; Kouwenhoven, L P\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe development of viable quantum computation devices will require the ability to preserve the coherence of quantum bits (qubits). Single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum information processing, but controlling decoherence remains a considerable challenge. Hole spins in III-V semiconductors have unique properties, such as a strong spin-orbit interaction and weak coupling to nuclear spins, and therefore, have the potential for enhanced spin control and longer coherence times. A weaker hyperfine interaction has previously been reported in self-assembled quantum dots using quantum optics techniques, but the development of hole-spin-based electronic devices in conventional III-V heterostructures has been limited by fabrication challenges. Here, we show that gate-tunable hole quantum dots can be formed in InSb nanowires and used to demonstrate Pauli spin blockade and electrical control of single hole spins. The devices are fully tunable between hole and electron quantum dots, which allows the hyperfine interaction strengths, g-factors and spin blockade anisotropies to be compared directly in the two regimes.\n\nOn-chip electrically controlled routing of photons from a single quantum dot\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBentham, C.; Coles, R. J.; Royall, B.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nElectrical control of on-chip routing of photons emitted by a single InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dot (SAQD) is demonstrated in a photonic crystal cavity-waveguide system. The SAQD is located inside an H1 cavity, which is coupled to two photonic crystal waveguides. The SAQD emission wavelength is electrically tunable by the quantum-confined Stark effect. When the SAQD emission is brought into resonance with one of two H1 cavity modes, it is preferentially routed to the waveguide to which that mode is selectively coupled. This proof of concept provides the basis for scalable, low-power, high-speed operation of single-photon routers for use in integratedmoreÂ Â» quantum photonic circuits.Â«Â less\n\nQuantum interference of electrically generated single photons from a quantum dot.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Raj B; Bennett, Anthony J; Cooper, Ken; Atkinson, Paola; Nicoll, Christine A; Ritchie, David A; Shields, Andrew J\n\n2010-07-09\n\nQuantum interference lies at the foundation of many protocols for scalable quantum computing and communication with linear optics. To observe these effects the light source must emit photons that are indistinguishable. From a technological standpoint, it would be beneficial to have electrical control over the emission. Here we report of an electrically driven single-photon source emitting indistinguishable photons. The device consists of a layer of InAs quantum dots embedded in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode. Indistinguishability of consecutive photons is tested in a two-photon interference experiment under two modes of operation, continuous and pulsed current injection. We also present a complete theory based on the interference of photons with a Lorentzian spectrum which we compare to both our continuous wave and pulsed experiments. In the former case, a visibility was measured limited only by the timing resolution of our detection system. In the case of pulsed injection, we employ a two-pulse voltage sequence which suppresses multi-photon emission and allows us to carry out temporal filtering of photons which have undergone dephasing. The characteristic Hong-Ou-Mandel 'dip' is measured, resulting in a visibility of 64 +/- 4%.\n\nElectrically driven polarized single-photon emission from an InGaN quantum dot in a GaN nanowire.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeshpande, Saniya; Heo, Junseok; Das, Ayan; Bhattacharya, Pallab\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn a classical light source, such as a laser, the photon number follows a Poissonian distribution. For quantum information processing and metrology applications, a non-classical emitter of single photons is required. A single quantum dot is an ideal source of single photons and such single-photon sources in the visible spectral range have been demonstrated with III-nitride and II-VI-based single quantum dots. It has been suggested that short-wavelength blue single-photon emitters would be useful for free-space quantum cryptography, with the availability of high-speed single-photon detectors in this spectral region. Here we demonstrate blue single-photon emission with electrical injection from an In0.25Ga0.75N quantum dot in a single nanowire. The emitted single photons are linearly polarized along the c axis of the nanowire with a degree of linear polarization of ~70%.\n\nPhoto-induced intersubband absorption in {Si}/{SiGe} quantum wells\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoucaud, P.; Gao, L.; Visocekas, F.; Moussa, Z.; Lourtioz, J.-M.; Julien, F. H.; Sagnes, I.; Campidelli, Y.; Badoz, P.-A.; Vagos, P.\n\n1995-12-01\n\nWe have investigated photo-induced intersubband absorption in the valence band of {Si}/{SiGe} quantum wells. Carriers are optically generated in the quantum wells using an argon ion laser. The resulting infrared absorption is probed with a step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The photo-induced infrared absorption in SiGe quantum wells is dominated by two contributions: the free carrier absorption, which is similar to bulk absorption in a uniformly doped SiGe layer, and the valence subband absorption in the quantum wells. Both p- and s-polarized intersubband absorptions are measured. We have observed that the photo-induced intersubband absorption in doped samples is shifted to lower energy as compared to direct intersubband absorption. This absorption process is attributed to carriers away from the Brillouin zone center. We show that the photo-induced technique is appropriate to study valence band mixing effects and their influence on intersubband absorption.\n\nSingle photon sources with single semiconductor quantum dots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShan, Guang-Cun; Yin, Zhang-Qi; Shek, Chan Hung; Huang, Wei\n\n2014-04-01\n\nIn this contribution, we briefly recall the basic concepts of quantum optics and properties of semiconductor quantum dot (QD) which are necessary to the understanding of the physics of single-photon generation with single QDs. Firstly, we address the theory of quantum emitter-cavity system, the fluorescence and optical properties of semiconductor QDs, and the photon statistics as well as optical properties of the QDs. We then review the localization of single semiconductor QDs in quantum confined optical microcavity systems to achieve their overall optical properties and performances in terms of strong coupling regime, efficiency, directionality, and polarization control. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent progress on the fabrication of single photon sources, and various approaches for embedding single QDs into microcavities or photonic crystal nanocavities and show how to extend the wavelength range. We focus in particular on new generations of electrically driven QD single photon source leading to high repetition rates, strong coupling regime, and high collection efficiencies at elevated temperature operation. Besides, new developments of room temperature single photon emission in the strong coupling regime are reviewed. The generation of indistinguishable photons and remaining challenges for practical single-photon sources are also discussed.\n\nPhoto-induced electronic properties in single quantum well system: effect of excitonic lifetime\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatwari, Jayita; Ghadi, Hemant; Sardar, Samim; Singhal, Jashan; Tongbram, Binita; Shyamal, Sanjib; Bhattacharya, Chinmoy; Chakrabarti, Subhananda; Pal, Samir Kumar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn the present study, we have established a correlation between the photo-induced electronic phenomena and excited state lifetime of the photo generated carriers in double barrier Al0.3Ga0.7As\\\\GaAs quantum well (QW) structures. The excited state lifetime was measured experimentally by picosecond time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy for two samples with different well widths (5.3ânm and 16.5ânm). The faster nonradiative decay time of the narrower well can be attributed to the facile escape of electrons from well to barrier due to lower associated energy compared to that of the thicker well which resembles the simulated results of the energy level distribution. The proposed mechanism of carrier escape is further proven from the higher value of unconventional excitonic capacitance value in the thicker well, measured by impedance spectroscopy. The dependence of photo-induced capacitance on well thickness is explained by the lifetime of the excited carriers in this study. Dependence of the photo-generated capacitance (C) on externally applied bias voltage (V) was also studied to quantitatively establish a proportional relation between the carrier holding capacity of the well and the excitonic lifetime. The higher accumulation of charge and lower ground state energy of the thicker well is evident from the higher tunnelling current found for the same in the photocurrent (I) versus voltage (V) measurement. Thus the escape of electrons from the well to barrier is the key factor affecting the photo generated charge accumulation and its holding capacity which in turn influences the device performances.\n\nElectrically injected GaAsBi/GaAs single quantum well laser diodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Juanjuan; Pan, Wenwu; Wu, Xiaoyan; Cao, Chunfang; Li, Yaoyao; Chen, Xiren; Zhang, Yanchao; Wang, Lijuan; Yan, Jinyi; Zhang, Dongliang; Song, Yuxin; Shao, Jun; Wang, Shumin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe present electrically injected GaAs/GaAsBi single quantum well laser diodes (LDs) emitting at a record long wavelength of 1141 nm at room temperature grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The LDs have excellent device performances with internal quantum efficiency of 86%, internal loss of 10 cm-1 and transparency current density of 196 A/cm2. The LDs can operate under continuous-wave mode up to 273 K. The characteristic temperature are extracted to be 125 K in the temperature range of 77Ë150 K, and reduced to 90 K in the range of 150Ë273 K. The temperature coefficient of 0.3 nm/K is extracted in the temperature range of 77Ë273 K.\n\nInfluence of surface states of CuInS2 quantum dots in quantum dots sensitized photo-electrodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeng, Zhuoyin; Liu, Yueli; Wu, Lei; Zhao, Yinghan; Chen, Keqiang; Chen, Wen\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSurface states are significant factor for the enhancement of electrochemical performance in CuInS2 quantum dot sensitized photo-electrodes. DDT, OLA, MPA, and S2- ligand capped CuInS2 quantum dot sensitized photo-electrodes are prepared by thermolysis, solvethermal and ligand-exchange processes, respectively, and their optical properties and photoelectrochemical properties are investigated. The S2- ligand enhances the UV-vis absorption and electron-hole separation property as well as the excellent charge transfer performance of the photo-electrodes, which is attributed to the fact that the atomic S2- ligand for the interfacial region of quantum dots may improve the electron transfer rate. These S2--capped CuInS2 quantum dot sensitized photo-electrodes exhibit the excellent photoelectrochemical efficiency and IPCE peak value, which is higher than that of the samples with DDT, OLA and MPA ligands.\n\nStudy on symmetry forbidden transitions in an InxGa1 - xAs/GaAs single quantum well by temperature dependence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, D. P.; Chen, C. T.; Kuan, H.; Shei, S. C.; Su, Y. K.\n\n1995-06-01\n\nThe photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy of the single quantum well InxGa1-xAs/GaAs system has been measured at various temperatures. The selection rules for the interband transitions are În=0, where n is the quantum number of the nth subband in the quantum well. The symmetry forbidden transitions (Înâ 0), such as 12H (where mnH denotes transition between the mth conduction to nth valence subband of heavy hole), were often observed in the experiments and it was attributed to the existence of the built-in electric field in the quantum well. In this work, we change the strength of the built-in electric field by varying the temperatures of the samples. By varying the temperatures of the samples, the strength of the field can be changed by the effect of photo-induced voltages. The measured ratios of the intensities of 12H to 11H transitions decrease as the temperatures are lowered. Therefore, the existence of the built-in electric field may account for the observations of the symmetry forbidden transition 12H in the experiments.\n\nElectrically driven quantum light emission in electromechanically tuneable photonic crystal cavities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetruzzella, M.; Pagliano, F. M.; Zobenica, Å½.; Birindelli, S.; Cotrufo, M.; van Otten, F. W. M.; van der Heijden, R. W.; Fiore, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA single quantum dot deterministically coupled to a photonic crystal environment constitutes an indispensable elementary unit to both generate and manipulate single-photons in next-generation quantum photonic circuits. To date, the scaling of the number of these quantum nodes on a fully integrated chip has been prevented by the use of optical pumping strategies that require a bulky off-chip laser along with the lack of methods to control the energies of nano-cavities and emitters. Here, we concurrently overcome these limitations by demonstrating electrical injection of single excitonic lines within a nano-electro-mechanically tuneable photonic crystal cavity. When an electrically driven dot line is brought into resonance with a photonic crystal mode, its emission rate is enhanced. Anti-bunching experiments reveal the quantum nature of these on-demand sources emitting in the telecom range. These results represent an important step forward in the realization of integrated quantum optics experiments featuring multiple electrically triggered Purcell-enhanced single-photon sources embedded in a reconfigurable semiconductor architecture.\n\nField-induced inversion of resonant tunneling currents through single molecule junctions and the directional photo-electric effect\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuperman, Maayan; Peskin, Uri\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIt has been known for several decades that the electric current through tunneling junctions is affected by irradiation. In particular, photon-assisted currents by asymmetric irradiation of the two leads was demonstrated and studied extensively in tunneling junctions of different compositions and for different radiation wavelengths. In this work, this phenomenon is revisited in the context of single molecule junctions. Restricting the theoretical discussion to adiabatic periodic driving of one lead with respect to the other within a non-interacting electron formulation, the main features of specific molecules are encoded in the discrete electronic energy levels. The detailed level structure of the molecule is shown to yield new effects in the presence of asymmetric driving of the leads. In particular, when the field-free tunneling process is dominated by a single electronic level, the electric current can be suppressed to zero or flow against the direction of an applied static bias. In the presence of a second electronic level, a directional photo-electric effect is predicted, where not only the magnitude but also the direction of the steady state electric current through the tunneling junction can be changed by a monotonous increase of the field intensity. These effects are analyzed and explained by outlying the relevant theory, using analytic expressions in the wide-band limit, as well as numerical simulations beyond this limit.\n\nResearch on Electrically Driven Single Photon Emitter by Diamond for Quantum Cryptography\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-03-24\n\nby diamond for quantum cryptography 5a.

This approach includes single- and two-qubit gates that are protected against low-frequency electrical noise, due to an operating point with a narrowband response to high frequency electric fields. Furthermore, existing double quantum dot advances, including robust preparation and measurement via spin-to-charge conversion, are immediately applicable to the new qubit. Finally, the electric dipole terms implicit in the high frequency coupling enable strong coupling with superconducting microwave resonators, leading to more robust two-qubit gates.\n\nElectrical injection Ga(AsBi)/(AlGa)As single quantum well laser\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLudewig, P.; Knaub, N.; Hossain, N.; Reinhard, S.; Nattermann, L.; Marko, I.

The phase manipulation is performed and quantified in a Ramsey experiment, where ultrafast transient detuning of the exciton energy is performed synchronous to double pulse Ï/2 ps laser excitation. We are able to demonstrate electrically controlled phase manipulations with magnitudes up to 3Ï within 100 ps which is below the dephasing time of the quantum dot exciton.\n\nDynamics of Single-Photon Emission from Electrically Pumped Color Centers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhramtsov, Igor A.; Agio, Mario; Fedyanin, Dmitry Yu.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nLow-power, high-speed, and bright electrically driven true single-photon sources, which are able to operate at room temperature, are vital for the practical realization of quantum-communication networks and optical quantum computations. Color centers in semiconductors are currently the best candidates; however, in spite of their intensive study in the past decade, the behavior of color centers in electrically controlled systems is poorly understood. Here we present a physical model and establish a theoretical approach to address single-photon emission dynamics of electrically pumped color centers, which interprets experimental results. We support our analysis with self-consistent numerical simulations of a single-photon emitting diode based on a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and predict the second-order autocorrelation function and other emission characteristics. Our theoretical findings demonstrate remarkable agreement with the experimental results and pave the way to the understanding of single-electron and single-photon processes in semiconductors.\n\nHigh power, electrically tunable quantum cascade lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSlivken, Steven; Razeghi, Manijeh\n\n2016-02-01\n\nMid-infrared laser sources (3-14 Î¼m wavelengths) which have wide spectral coverage and high output power are attractive for many applications. This spectral range contains unique absorption fingerprints of most molecules, including toxins, explosives, and nerve agents. Infrared spectroscopy can also be used to detect important biomarkers, which can be used for medical diagnostics by means of breath analysis. The challenge is to produce a broadband midinfrared source which is small, lightweight, robust, and inexpensive. We are currently investigating monolithic solutions using quantum cascade lasers. A wide gain bandwidth is not sufficient to make an ideal spectroscopy source. Single mode output with rapid tuning is desirable. For dynamic wavelength selection, our group is developing multi-section laser geometries with wide electrical tuning (hundreds of cm-1). These devices are roughly the same size as a traditional quantum cascade lasers, but tuning is accomplished without any external optical components. When combined with suitable amplifiers, these lasers are capable of multi-Watt single mode output powers. This manuscript will describe our current research efforts and the potential for high performance, broadband electrical tuning with the quantum cascade laser.\n\nMultifunctional semiconductor micro-Hall devices for magnetic, electric, and photo-detection\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGilbertson, A.

An infinitely deep potential is used to describe effects of quantum confinement due to conduction band offsets at surfaces where quantum dot and surrounding materials meet. Single donor ground state total and binding energies in presence of electric field are determined via two-dimensional finite difference approach and Ritz-HassÃ© variation principle. For the latter method, attractive coulomb correlation between electron and ionized single donor is taken into account in the expression of trial wave function. It appears that off-center single dopant binding energy, spatial extension and radial probability density are strongly dependent on hemisphere radius and single dopant position inside quantum dot. Influence of a uniform electric field is also investigated. It shows that Stark effect appears even for very small size dots and that single dopant energy shift is more significant when the single donor is near hemispherical surface.\n\nUltrafast single photon emitting quantum photonic structures based on a nano-obelisk.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Je-Hyung; Ko, Young-Ho; Gong, Su-Hyun; Ko, Suk-Min; Cho, Yong-Hoon\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA key issue in a single photon source is fast and efficient generation of a single photon flux with high light extraction efficiency. Significant progress toward high-efficiency single photon sources has been demonstrated by semiconductor quantum dots, especially using narrow bandgap materials. Meanwhile, there are many obstacles, which restrict the use of wide bandgap semiconductor quantum dots as practical single photon sources in ultraviolet-visible region, despite offering free space communication and miniaturized quantum information circuits. Here we demonstrate a single InGaN quantum dot embedded in an obelisk-shaped GaN nanostructure. The nano-obelisk plays an important role in eliminating dislocations, increasing light extraction, and minimizing a built-in electric field. Based on the nano-obelisks, we observed nonconventional narrow quantum dot emission and positive biexciton binding energy, which are signatures of negligible built-in field in single InGaN quantum dots. This results in efficient and ultrafast single photon generation in the violet color region.\n\nFabrication of green dye-sensitized solar cell based on ZnO nanoparticles as a photoanode and graphene quantum dots as a photo-sensitizer.\n\nPubMed\n\nZamiri, Golnoush; Bagheri, Samira\n\n2018-02-01\n\nZero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consist of single- or few-layer graphene with a size less than 20â¯nm and stand for a new type of QDs with unique properties combining the graphene nature and size-resulted quantum effects. GQDs possess unique optical and electronic properties, and in particular possess a band-gap less than 2.0â¯eV because of quantum confinement and edge effects. In this study, we investigated the performance of DSSCs using different thicknesses of ZnO nanoparticles as a photo-anode and GQDs as a green photosensitizer. The current voltage (I-V) test results indicate that the performance of DSSCs is improved by increasing the thickness of the photo-anode and the thickness of 40â¯Î¼m shows the highest efficiency for DSSC device based on ZnO nanoparticles photo-anodes. The DSSC using ZnO nanoparticles as a photo-anode with thickness of 40â¯Î¼m shows almost same efficiency when we replaced N-719 with GQDs which is confirmed that using GQDs as an alternative to ruthenium based dyes is a new approach for DSSCs.

We showed during irradiation these substrates can interact uniquely with such quantum dots, inducing distinct forms of photo-induced processes when they have different cores, shells, or ligands. In particular, our results showed that for certain types of core-shell quantum dot structures an ultrathin layer of a metal oxide can reduce suppression of quantum efficiency of the quantum dots happening when they undergo extensive photo-oxidation. This suggests the possibility of shrinking the sizes of quantum dots without significant enhancement of their non-radiative decay rates. We show that such quantum dots are not influenced significantly by Coulomb blockade or photoionization, while those without a shell can undergo a large amount of photo-induced fluorescence enhancement via such blockade when they are in touch with the metal oxide.\n\nProbing the structural dependency of photoinduced properties of colloidal quantum dots using metal-oxide photo-active substrates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatty, Kira; Sadeghi, Seyed M.; Campbell, Quinn; Hamilton, Nathan; West, Robert G.; Mao, Chuanbin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe used photoactive substrates consisting of about 1ânm coating of a metal oxide on glass substrates to investigate the impact of the structures of colloidal quantum dots on their photophysical and photochemical properties.

We show that our coupled atom-cavity system can be used to generate single photons in a controlled way. With our long trapping times and high single-photon production efficiency, the non-classical properties of the emitted light can be shown in the photon correlations of a single atom. In a similar atom-cavity setup, we investigate the interface between atoms and photons by entangling a single atom with a single photon emitted into the cavity and by further mapping the quantum state of the atom onto a second single photon. These schemes are intrinsically deterministic and establish the basic element required to realize a distributed quantum network with individual atoms at rest as quantum memories and single flying photons as quantum messengers.

S.; Okazaki, R.; Taniguchi, H.\n\n2013-11-07\n\nWe report the observation of photo-Seebeck effect in tetragonal PbO crystals. The photo-induced carriers contribute to the transport phenomena, and consequently the electrical conductivity increases and the Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing photon flux density. A parallel-circuit model is used to evaluate the actual contributions of photo-excited carriers from the measured transport data. The photo-induced carrier concentration estimated from the Seebeck coefficient increases almost linearly with increasing photon flux density, indicating a successful photo-doping effect on the thermoelectric property. The mobility decreases by illumination but the reduction rate strongly depends on the illuminated photon energy. Possible mechanisms of such photon-energy-dependentmoreÂ Â» mobility are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nEnhancing the brightness of electrically driven single-photon sources using color centers in silicon carbide\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhramtsov, Igor A.; Vyshnevyy, Andrey A.; Fedyanin, Dmitry Yu.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nPractical applications of quantum information technologies exploiting the quantum nature of light require efficient and bright true single-photon sources which operate under ambient conditions. Currently, point defects in the crystal lattice of diamond known as color centers have taken the lead in the race for the most promising quantum system for practical non-classical light sources. This work is focused on a different quantum optoelectronic material, namely a color center in silicon carbide, and reveals the physics behind the process of single-photon emission from color centers in SiC under electrical pumping. We show that color centers in silicon carbide can be far superior to any other quantum light emitter under electrical control at room temperature. Using a comprehensive theoretical approach and rigorous numerical simulations, we demonstrate that at room temperature, the photon emission rate from a p-i-n silicon carbide single-photon emitting diode can exceed 5 Gcounts/s, which is higher than what can be achieved with electrically driven color centers in diamond or epitaxial quantum dots. These findings lay the foundation for the development of practical photonic quantum devices which can be produced in a well-developed CMOS compatible process flow.\n\nLigand removal and photo-activation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots for enhanced optoelectronic devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoyen, Eric; Kanwat, Anil; Cho, Sinyoung; Jun, Haeyeon; Aad, Roy; Jang, Jin\n\n2018-05-10\n\nPerovskite quantum dots have recently emerged as a promising light source for optoelectronic applications. However, integrating them into devices while preserving their outstanding optical properties remains challenging. Due to their ionic nature, perovskite quantum dots are extremely sensitive and degrade on applying the simplest processes. To maintain their colloidal stability, they are surrounded by organic ligands; these prevent efficient charge carrier injection in devices and have to be removed. Here we report on a simple method, where a moderate thermal process followed by exposure to UV in air can efficiently remove ligands and increase the photo-luminescence of the room temperature synthesized perovskite quantum dot thin films. Annealing is accompanied by a red shift of the emission wavelength, usually attributed to the coalescence and irreversible degradation of the quantum dots. We show that it is actually related to the relaxation of the quantum dots upon the ligand removal, without the creation of non-radiative recombining defects. The quantum dot surface, as devoid of ligands, is subsequently photo-oxidized and smoothened upon exposure to UV in air, which drastically enhances their photo-luminescence. This adequate combination of treatments improves by more than an order of magnitude the performances of perovskite quantum dot light emitting diodes.\n\nSingle colloidal quantum dots as sources of single photons for quantum cryptography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPisanello, Ferruccio; Qualtieri, Antonio; LemÃ©nager, Godefroy; Martiradonna, Luigi; Stomeo, Tiziana; Cingolani, Roberto; Bramati, Alberto; De Vittorio, Massimo\n\n2011-02-01\n\nColloidal nanocrystals, i.e. quantum dots synthesized trough wet-chemistry approaches, are promising nanoparticles for photonic applications and, remarkably, their quantum nature makes them very promising for single photon emission at room temperature.

However, progress in silicon technology has shown that these phenomena can be harnessed and exploited for a new class of quantum-based electronics. Among others, multi-layer-gated silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology can be used to control single charge or spin confined in electrostatically-defined quantum dots (QD). These QD-based devices are an excellent platform for quantum computing applications and, recently, it has been demonstrated that they can also be used as single-electron pumps, which are accurate sources of quantized current for metrological purposes. Here, we discuss in detail the fabrication protocol for silicon MOS QDs which is relevant to both quantum computing and quantum metrology applications. Moreover, we describe characterization methods to test the integrity of the devices after fabrication. Finally, we give a brief description of the measurement set-up used for charge pumping experiments and show representative results of electric current quantization.

When perturbed either electrically or optically by an input signal above a certain threshold, the optoelectronic circuit generates short electrical and optical excitable pulses mimicking the spiking behavior of biological neurons. Interestingly, the asymmetric nonlinear characteristic of the RTD-LD allows for two different regimes where one obtain either single pulses or a burst of multiple pulses. The high-speed excitable response capabilities are promising for neurally inspired information applications in photonics.\n\nIndependent tuning of excitonic emission energy and decay time in single semiconductor quantum dots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHÃ¶fer, B.; Zhang, J.; Wildmann, J.; Zallo, E.; Trotta, R.; Ding, F.; Rastelli, A.; Schmidt, O. G.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIndependent tuning of emission energy and decay time of neutral excitons confined in single self-assembled In(Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots is achieved by simultaneously employing vertical electric fields and lateral biaxial strain fields. By locking the emission energy via a closed-loop feedback on the piezoelectric actuator used to control the strain in the quantum dot, we continuously decrease the decay time of an exciton from 1.4 to 0.7 ns. Both perturbations are fully electrically controlled and their combination offers a promising route to engineer the indistinguishability of photons emitted from spatially separated single photon sources.\n\nQuantum electric-dipole liquid on a triangular lattice.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Shi-Peng; Wu, Jia-Chuan; Song, Jun-Da; Sun, Xue-Feng; Yang, Yi-Feng; Chai, Yi-Sheng; Shang, Da-Shan; Wang, Shou-Guo; Scott, James F; Sun, Young\n\n2016-02-04\n\nGeometric frustration and quantum fluctuations may prohibit the formation of long-range ordering even at the lowest temperature, and therefore liquid-like ground states could be expected. A good example is the quantum spin liquid in frustrated magnets. Geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations can happen beyond magnetic systems. Here we propose that quantum electric-dipole liquids, analogues of quantum spin liquids, could emerge in frustrated dielectrics where antiferroelectrically coupled electric dipoles reside on a triangular lattice. The quantum paraelectric hexaferrite BaFe12O19 with geometric frustration represents a promising candidate for the proposed electric-dipole liquid. We present a series of experimental lines of evidence, including dielectric permittivity, heat capacity and thermal conductivity measured down to 66âmK, to reveal the existence of an unusual liquid-like quantum phase in BaFe12O19, characterized by itinerant low-energy excitations with a small gap. The possible quantum liquids of electric dipoles in frustrated dielectrics open up a fresh playground for fundamental physics.\n\nVertical electric field induced suppression of fine structure splitting of excited state excitons in a single GaAs/AlGaAs island quantum dots\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGhali, Mohsen; Laboratory of Nanophotonics, Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Kafrelsheikh University, 33516 Kafrelsheikh; Ohno, Yuzo\n\n2015-09-21\n\nWe report experimentally on fine structure splitting (FSS) of various excitonic transitions in single GaAs island quantum dots, formed by a monolayer thickness fluctuation in the narrow GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, and embedded in an n-i-Schottky diode device. By applying a forward vertical electric field (F) between the top metallic contact and the sample substrate, we observed an in-plane polarization rotation of both the ground and the excited state excitons with increasing the electric field. The polarization rotations were accompanied with a strong decrease in the FSS of the ground as well as the excited state excitons with the field, untilmoreÂ Â» the FSS vanished as F approached 30âkV/cm.Â«Â less\n\nSingle-Photon-Triggered Quantum Phase Transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ¼, Xin-You; Zheng, Li-Li; Zhu, Gui-Lei; Wu, Ying\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe propose a hybrid quantum model combining cavity QED and optomechanics, which allows the occurrence of an equilibrium superradiant quantum phase transition (QPT) triggered by a single photon. This single-photon-triggered QPT exists in the cases of both ignoring and including the so-called A2 term; i.e., it is immune to the no-go theorem. It originally comes from the photon-dependent quantum criticality featured by the proposed hybrid quantum model. Moreover, a reversed superradiant QPT is induced by the competition between the introduced A2 term and the optomechanical interaction. This work offers an approach to manipulate QPT with a single photon, which should inspire the exploration of single-photon quantum-criticality physics and the engineering of new single-photon quantum devices.\n\nThree-party Quantum Secure Direct Communication with Single Photons in both Polarization and Spatial-mode Degrees of Freedom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, LiLi; Ma, WenPing; Wang, MeiLing; Shen, DongSu\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe present an efficient three-party quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol with single photos in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom. The three legal parties' messages can be encoded on the polarization and the spatial-mode states of single photons independently with desired unitary operations. A party can obtain the other two parties' messages simultaneously through a quantum channel. Because no extra public information is transmitted in the classical channels, the drawback of information leakage or classical correlation does not exist in the proposed scheme. Moreover, the comprehensive security analysis shows that the presented QSDC network protocol can defend the outsider eavesdropper's several sorts of attacks. Compared with the single photons with only one degree of freedom, our protocol based on the single photons in two degrees of freedom has higher capacity. Since the preparation and the measurement of single photon quantum states in both the polarization and the spatial-mode degrees of freedom are available with current quantum techniques, the proposed protocol is practical.\n\nPhoto-generated metamaterials induce modulation of CW terahertz quantum cascade lasers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMezzapesa, Francesco P.; Columbo, Lorenzo L.; Rizza, Carlo; Brambilla, Massimo; Ciattoni, Alessardro; Dabbicco, Maurizio; Vitiello, Miriam S.; Scamarcio, Gaetano\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPeriodic patterns of photo-excited carriers on a semiconductor surface profoundly modifies its effective permittivity, creating a stationary all-optical quasi-metallic metamaterial. Intriguingly, one can tailor its artificial birefringence to modulate with unprecedented degrees of freedom both the amplitude and phase of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) subject to optical feedback from such an anisotropic reflector. Here, we conceive and devise a reconfigurable photo-designed Terahertz (THz) modulator and exploit it in a proof-of-concept experiment to control the emission properties of THz QCLs. Photo-exciting sub-wavelength metastructures on silicon, we induce polarization-dependent changes in the intra-cavity THz field, that can be probed by monitoring the voltage across the QCL terminals. This inherently flexible approach promises groundbreaking impact on THz photonics applications, including THz phase modulators, fast switches, and active hyperbolic media.

The Hanle curves with an anomalously large width and hysteretic behavior at the critical transverse magnetic field were observed in many single quantum dots grown in the same sample. In order to explain the anomalies in the Hanle curve indicating the formation of a large nuclear field perpendicular to the photo-injected electron spin polarization, we propose a new model based on the current phenomenological model for dynamic nuclear spin polarization. The model includes the effects of the nuclear quadrupole interaction and the sign inversion between in-plane and out-of-plane components of nuclear g factors, and the model calculations reproduce successfully the characteristics of the observed anomalies in the Hanle curves.\n\nAnalysis of photogenerated random telegraph signal in single electron detector (photo-SET).\n\nPubMed\n\nTroudi, M; Sghaier, Na; Kalboussi, A; Souifi, A\n\n2010-01-04\n\nIn this paper, we analyzed slow single traps, situated inside the tunnel oxide of small area single electron photo-detector (photo-SET or nanopixel). The relationship between excitation signal (photons) and random-telegraph-signal (RTS) was evidenced. We demonstrated that photoinduced RTS observed on a photo-detector is due to the interaction between single photogenerated charges that tunnel from dot to dot and current path. Based on RTS analysis for various temperatures, gate bias and optical power we determined the characteristics of these single photogenerated traps: the energy position within the silicon bandgap, capture cross section and the position within the Si/SiO(x = 1.5) interfaces.\n\nPhoto-ionization cross-section of donor-related in (In,Ga)N/GaN core/shell under hydrostatic pressure and electric field effects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl Ghazi, Haddou; John Peter, A.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHydrogenic-like donor-impurity related self and induced polarizations, bending energy and photo-ionization cross section in spherical core/shell zinc blende (In,Ga)N/GaN are computed. Based on the variational approach and within effective-mass and one parabolic approximations, the calculations are made under finite potential barrier taking into account of the discontinuity of the effective-mass and the constant dielectric. The photo-ionization cross section is studied according to the photon incident energy considering the effects of hydrostatic pressure, applied electric field, structure's radius, impurity's position and indium composition in the core. It is obtained that the influences mentioned above lead to either blue shifts or redshifts of the resonant peak of the photo-ionization cross section spectrum. The unusual behavior related to the structure radius is discussed which is as a consequence of the finite potential confinement. We have shown that the photo-ionization cross section can be controlled with adjusting the internal and external factors. These properties can be useful for producing some device applications such as quantum dot infrared photodetectors.\n\nSingle photon quantum cryptography.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeveratos, Alexios; Brouri, Rosa; Gacoin, Thierry; Villing, AndrÃ©; Poizat, Jean-Philippe; Grangier, Philippe\n\n2002-10-28\n\nWe report the full implementation of a quantum cryptography protocol using a stream of single photon pulses generated by a stable and efficient source operating at room temperature.

We implement a downconversion quantum interface, where the single photons emitted from a semiconductor quantum dot at 910 nm are downconverted to 1560 nm using a fiber-coupled periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide and a 2.2-Î¼m pulsed pump laser. The single-photon character of the quantum dot emission is preserved during the downconversion process: we measure a cross-correlation g(2)(Ï = 0) = 0.17 using resonant excitation of the quantum dot. We show that the downconversion interface is fully compatible with coherent optical control of the quantum dot electron spin through the observation of Rabi oscillations in the downconverted photon counts. These results represent a critical step towards a long-distance hybrid quantum network in which subsystems operating at different wavelengths are connected through quantum frequency conversion devices and 1.5-Î¼m quantum channels.\n\nTraceable quantum sensing and metrology relied up a quantum electrical triangle principle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFang, Yan; Wang, Hengliang; Yang, Xinju; Wei, Jingsong\n\n2016-11-01\n\nHybrid quantum state engineering in quantum communication and imaging1-2 needs traceable quantum sensing and metrology, which are especially critical to quantum internet3 and precision measurements4 that are important across all fields of science and technology-. We aim to set up a mode of traceable quantum sensing and metrology. We developed a method by specially transforming an atomic force microscopy (AFM) and a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) into a conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) with a feedback control loop, wherein quantum entanglement enabling higher precision was relied upon a set-point, a visible light laser beam-controlled an interferometer with a surface standard at z axis, diffractometers with lateral standards at x-y axes, four-quadrant photodiode detectors, a scanner and its image software, a phase-locked pre-amplifier, a cantilever with a kHz Pt/Au conducting tip, a double barrier tunneling junction model, a STM circuit by frequency modulation and a quantum electrical triangle principle involving single electron tunneling effect, quantum Hall effect and Josephson effect5. The average and standard deviation result of repeated measurements on a 1 nm height local micro-region of nanomedicine crystal hybrid quantum state engineering surface and its differential pA level current and voltage (dI/dV) in time domains by using C-AFM was converted into an international system of units: Siemens (S), an indicated value 0.86Ã10-12 S (n=6) of a relative standard uncertainty was superior over a relative standard uncertainty reference value 2.3Ã10-10 S of 2012 CODADA quantized conductance6.

The required optical quantum memory must be able to receive and recreate the photonic qubit; additionally, it must store an unknown quantum state of light better than any classical device. So far, these two requirements have been met only by ensembles of material particles that store the information in collective excitations. Recent developments, however, have paved the way for an approach in which the information exchange occurs between single quanta of light and matter. This single-particle approach allows the material qubit to be addressed, which has fundamental advantages for realistic implementations. First, it enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon by means of state detection; this can be used to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies. Second, it allows for individual qubit manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum information. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a quantum memory, by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out of a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is tested with weak coherent pulses and analysed using full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is measured to be 93%, and low decoherence rates result in qubit coherence times exceeding 180 âmicroseconds. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent prospects for applications in optical quantum gates and quantum repeaters.\n\nLithium niobate single-crystal and photo-functional device\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGopalan, Venkatraman; Mitchell, Terrence E.; Kitamura, Kenji; Furukawa, Yasunori\n\n2001-01-01\n\nProvided are lithium niobate single-crystal that requires a low voltage of not larger than 10 kV/nm for its ferroelectric polarization inversion and of which the polarization can be periodically inverted with accuracy even at such a low voltage, and a photo-functional device comprising the crystal.

The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si/SiGe quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from a local micromagnet, and the spin state is read out in the single-shot mode. Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in silicon, a Ramsey decay timescale of 1â Î¼s is observed, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic timescales in GaAs quantum dots, whereas gate operation times are comparable to those reported in GaAs. The spin echo decay time is ~40â Î¼s, both with one and four echo pulses, possibly limited by intervalley scattering. These advances strongly improve the prospects for quantum information processing based on quantum dots.\n\nControlling the Properties of Matter with Quantum Dots\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKlimov, Victor\n\n2017-03-22\n\nSolar cells and photodetectors could soon be made from new types of materials based on semiconductor quantum dots, thanks to new insights based on ultrafast measurements capturing real-time photoconversion processes. Photoconversion is a process wherein the energy of a photon, or quantum of light, is converted into other forms of energy, for example, chemical or electrical. Semiconductor quantum dots are chemically synthesized crystalline nanoparticles that have been studied for more than three decades in the context of various photoconversion schemes including photovoltaics (generation of photo-electricity) and photo-catalysis (generation of âsolar fuelsâ). The appeal of quantum dots comes from the unmatchedmoreÂ Â» tunability of their physical properties, which can be adjusted by controlling the size, shape and composition of the dots. At Los Alamos, the research connects to the institutional mission of solving national security challenges through scientific excellence, in this case focusing on novel physical principles for highly efficient photoconversion, charge manipulation in exploratory device structures and novel nanomaterials.Â«Â less\n\nAn all-electric single-molecule motor.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeldenthuis, Johannes S; Prins, Ferry; Thijssen, Joseph M; van der Zant, Herre S J\n\n2010-11-23\n\nMany types of molecular motors have been proposed and synthesized in recent years, displaying different kinds of motion, and fueled by different driving forces such as light, heat, or chemical reactions. We propose a new type of molecular motor based on electric field actuation and electric current detection of the rotational motion of a molecular dipole embedded in a three-terminal single-molecule device. The key aspect of this all-electronic design is the conjugated backbone of the molecule, which simultaneously provides the potential landscape of the rotor orientation and a real-time measure of that orientation through the modulation of the conductivity. Using quantum chemistry calculations, we show that this approach provides full control over the speed and continuity of motion, thereby combining electrical and mechanical control at the molecular level over a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, chemistry can be used to change all key parameters of the device, enabling a variety of new experiments on molecular motors.\n\nElectrical tuning of a quantum plasmonic resonance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Xiaoge; Kang, Ju-Hyung; Yuan, Hongtao; Park, Junghyun; Kim, Soo Jin; Cui, Yi; Hwang, Harold Y.; Brongersma, Mark L.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nSurface plasmon (SP) excitations in metals facilitate confinement of light into deep-subwavelength volumes and can induce strong light-matter interaction. Generally, the SP resonances supported by noble metal nanostructures are explained well by classical models, at least until the nanostructure size is decreased to a few nanometres, approaching the Fermi wavelength Î»F of the electrons. Although there is a long history of reports on quantum size effects in the plasmonic response of nanometre-sized metal particles, systematic experimental studies have been hindered by inhomogeneous broadening in ensemble measurements, as well as imperfect control over size, shape, faceting, surface reconstructions, contamination, charging effects and surface roughness in single-particle measurements. In particular, observation of the quantum size effect in metallic films and its tuning with thickness has been challenging as they only confine carriers in one direction. Here, we show active tuning of quantum size effects in SP resonances supported by a 20-nm-thick metallic film of indium tin oxide (ITO), a plasmonic material serving as a low-carrier-density Drude metal. An ionic liquid (IL) is used to electrically gate and partially deplete the ITO layer. The experiment shows a controllable and reversible blue-shift in the SP resonance above a critical voltage. A quantum-mechanical model including the quantum size effect reproduces the experimental results, whereas a classical model only predicts a red shift.\n\nHigh-performance semiconductor quantum-dot single-photon sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSenellart, Pascale; Solomon, Glenn; White, Andrew\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSingle photons are a fundamental element of most quantum optical technologies. The ideal single-photon source is an on-demand, deterministic, single-photon source delivering light pulses in a well-defined polarization and spatiotemporal mode, and containing exactly one photon. In addition, for many applications, there is a quantum advantage if the single photons are indistinguishable in all their degrees of freedom. Single-photon sources based on parametric down-conversion are currently used, and while excellent in many ways, scaling to large quantum optical systems remains challenging. In 2000, semiconductor quantum dots were shown to emit single photons, opening a path towards integrated single-photon sources. Here, we review the progress achieved in the past few years, and discuss remaining challenges. The latest quantum dot-based single-photon sources are edging closer to the ideal single-photon source, and have opened new possibilities for quantum technologies.\n\nSingle-server blind quantum computation with quantum circuit model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xiaoqian; Weng, Jian; Li, Xiaochun; Luo, Weiqi; Tan, Xiaoqing; Song, Tingting\n\n2018-06-01\n\nBlind quantum computation (BQC) enables the client, who has few quantum technologies, to delegate her quantum computation to a server, who has strong quantum computabilities and learns nothing about the client's quantum inputs, outputs and algorithms. In this article, we propose a single-server BQC protocol with quantum circuit model by replacing any quantum gate with the combination of rotation operators. The trap quantum circuits are introduced, together with the combination of rotation operators, such that the server is unknown about quantum algorithms. The client only needs to perform operations X and Z, while the server honestly performs rotation operators.\n\nCoherent manipulation of quantum spin states in a single molecular nanomagnet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWernsdorfer, Wolfgang\n\nThe endeavour of quantum electronics is driven by one of the most ambitious technological goals of today's scientists: the realization of an operational quantum computer (http://qurope.eu). We started to address this goal by the new research field of molecular quantum spintronics. The building blocks are magnetic molecules, i.e. well-defined spin qubits. We will discuss this still largely unexplored field and present our first results: For example, using a molecular spin-transistor, we achieved the electronic read-out of the nuclear spin of an individual metal atom embedded in an SMM. We could show very long spin lifetimes (>10 s). Using the hyperfine Stark effect, which transforms electric fields into local effective magnetic fields, we could not only tune the resonance frequency by several MHz, but also perform coherent quantum manipulations on a single nuclear qubit faster than a Î¼s by means of electrical fields only, establishing the individual addressability of identical nuclear qubits. Using three different microwave frequencies, we could implement a simple four-level Grover algorithm. S. Thiele, F. Balestro, R. Ballou, S. Klyatskaya, M. Ruben, W.

The prolarization-independent device works on an input state of up to two photons, whereas the polarization-preserving device works on a superposition of vacuum and single- photon states. The overall function of the device would be to probabilistically generate a unique detector output only when its input electromagnetic mode was populated by a single photon, in which case its output mode would also be populated by a single photon. Like other QND devices, the proposed devices are potentially useful for a variety of applications, including such areas of NASA interest as quantum computing, quantum communication, detection of gravity waves, as well as pedagogical demonstrations of the quantum nature of light. Many protocols in quantum computation and quantum communication require the possibility of detecting a photon without destroying it. The only prior single- photon-detecting QND device is based on quantum electrodynamics in a resonant cavity and, as such, it depends on the photon frequency. Moreover, the prior device can distinguish only between one photon and no photon. The proposed interferometric QND devices would not depend on frequency and could distinguish between (a) one photon and (b) zero or two photons. The first proposed device is depicted schematically in Figure 1. The input electromagnetic mode would be a superposition of a zero-, a one-, and a two-photon quantum state. The overall function of the device would be to probabilistically generate a unique detector output only when its input electromagnetic mode was populated by a single photon, in which case its output mode also would be populated by a single photon.\n\nViewing videotaped identification procedure increases juror sensitivity to single-blind photo-array administration.\n\nPubMed\n\nModjadidi, Karima; Kovera, Margaret Bull\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe investigated whether watching a videotaped photo array administration or expert testimony could sensitize jurors to the suggestiveness of single-blind eyewitness identification procedures. Mock jurors recruited from the community (N = 231) watched a videotaped simulation of a robbery trial in which the primary evidence against the defendant was an eyewitness identification. We varied whether the witness made an identification from a single- or double-blind photo array, the evidence included a videotape of the photo array procedure, and an expert testified about the effects of single-blind identification procedures on administrators' behaviors and witness accuracy. Watching the videotaped photo array administration sensitized mock jurors to the suggestiveness of the single-blind procedure, causing them to be less likely to convict a defendant identified through single-rather than double-blind procedures. Exposure to the videotaped procedure also decreased the favorability of mock jurors' ratings of the eyewitness, irrespective of whether the lineup was conducted by a single-blind administrator. Expert testimony did not sensitize jurors to administrator bias. Thus, videotaping identification procedures could serve as an important procedural reform that both preserves a record of whether the lineup administration was suggestive and might improve jurors' evaluations of eyewitness evidence.

S.; Li, G.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nBased on the optical activity of liquid crystal, a new approach for the stealth of \"cat's eye\" targets is proposed in this paper. It imitates the physiological close reaction of human eyes when strong light irradiates eyes. With this approach, the \"cat's eye\" effect will vanish, which is applied in restricting photo-electric equipments being detected and located by active laser detection system. The structure and working principle of the design are presented. The drive circuit is given to control the optical switch automatically. Feasibility of this design is demonstrated by experimental method. The measured data illustrate that the proposed approach is effective to eliminate the \"cat's eye\" effect, so as to enhancing the viability of photo-electric equipments on the battlefield.\n\nElectrically-induced polarization selection rules of a graphene quantum dot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Qing-Rui; Li, Yan; Jia, Chen; Wang, Fu-Li; Zhang, Ya-Ting; Liu, Chun-Xiang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe study theoretically the single-electron triangular zigzag graphene quantum dot in uniform in-plane electric fields. The absorption spectra of the dot are calculated by the tight-binding method. The energy spectra and the distribution of wave functions are also presented to analyse the absorption spectra. The orthogonal zero-energy eigenstates are arranged along to the direction of the external field. The remarkable result is that all intraband transitions and some interband transitions are forbidden when the absorbed light is polarized along the direction of the electric field. With x-direction electric field, all intraband absorption is y polarized due to the electric-field-direction-polarization selection rule. Moreover, with y-direction electric field, all absorption is either x or y polarized due to the parity selection rule as well as to the electric-field-direction-polarization selection rule. Our calculation shows that the formation of the absorption spectra is co-decided by the polarization selection rules and the overlap between the eigenstates of the transition.\n\nElectrically Tunable Terahertz Quantum-Cascade Lasers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGunapala, Sarath; Soidel, Alexander; Mansour, Kamjou\n\n2006-01-01\n\nImproved quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) are being developed as electrically tunable sources of radiation in the far infrared spectral region, especially in the frequency range of 2 to 5 THz.

The large-scale practical application of battery electric vehicles may not be realized unless lithium-ion batteries with self-charging suppliers will be developed. Solar cells offer an attractive option for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the use of perovskite solar cell packs with four single CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells connected in series for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries assembled with a LiFePO4 cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 anode. Our device shows a high overall photo-electric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80% and excellent cycling stability, which outperforms other reported lithium-ion batteries, lithium-air batteries, flow batteries and super-capacitors integrated with a photo-charging component. The newly developed self-chargeable units based on integrated perovskite solar cells and lithium-ion batteries hold promise for various potential applications.\n\nEntanglement and quantum superposition induced by a single photon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ¼, Xin-You; Zhu, Gui-Lei; Zheng, Li-Li; Wu, Ying\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe predict the occurrence of single-photon-induced entanglement and quantum superposition in a hybrid quantum model, introducing an optomechanical coupling into the Rabi model. Originally, it comes from the photon-dependent quantum property of the ground state featured by the proposed hybrid model. It is associated with a single-photon-induced quantum phase transition, and is immune to the A2 term of the spin-field interaction. Moreover, the obtained quantum superposition state is actually a squeezed cat state, which can significantly enhance precision in quantum metrology. This work offers an approach to manipulate entanglement and quantum superposition with a single photon, which might have potential applications in the engineering of new single-photon quantum devices, and also fundamentally broaden the regime of cavity QED.\n\nHybrid quantum-classical modeling of quantum dot devices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKantner, Markus; Mittnenzweig, Markus; Koprucki, Thomas\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe design of electrically driven quantum dot devices for quantum optical applications asks for modeling approaches combining classical device physics with quantum mechanics. We connect the well-established fields of semiclassical semiconductor transport theory and the theory of open quantum systems to meet this requirement. By coupling the van Roosbroeck system with a quantum master equation in Lindblad form, we introduce a new hybrid quantum-classical modeling approach, which provides a comprehensive description of quantum dot devices on multiple scales: it enables the calculation of quantum optical figures of merit and the spatially resolved simulation of the current flow in realistic semiconductor device geometries in a unified way. We construct the interface between both theories in such a way, that the resulting hybrid system obeys the fundamental axioms of (non)equilibrium thermodynamics. We show that our approach guarantees the conservation of charge, consistency with the thermodynamic equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations of an electrically driven single-photon source based on a single quantum dot in the stationary and transient operation regime.\n\nRealization of a Cascaded Quantum System: Heralded Absorption of a Single Photon Qubit by a Single-Electron Charged Quantum Dot.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelteil, Aymeric; Sun, Zhe; FÃ¤lt, Stefan; ImamoÄlu, Atac\n\n2017-04-28\n\nPhotonic losses pose a major limitation for the implementation of a quantum state transfer between nodes of a quantum network. A measurement that heralds a successful transfer without revealing any information about the qubit may alleviate this limitation. Here, we demonstrate the heralded absorption of a single photonic qubit, generated by a single neutral quantum dot, by a single-electron charged quantum dot that is located 5Â m away. The transfer of quantum information to the spin degree of freedom takes place upon the emission of a photon; for a properly chosen or prepared quantum dot, the detection of this photon yields no information about the qubit. We show that this process can be combined with local operations optically performed on the destination node by measuring classical correlations between the absorbed photon color and the final state of the electron spin. Our work suggests alternative avenues for the realization of quantum information protocols based on cascaded quantum systems.\n\nMicro-Hall devices for magnetic, electric and photo-detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGilbertson, A.; Sadeghi, H.; Panchal, V.; Kazakova, O.; Lambert, C.

F.\n\nMultifunctional mesoscopic sensors capable of detecting local magnetic (B) , electric (E) , and optical fields can greatly facilitate image capture in nano-arrays that address a multitude of disciplines. The use of micro-Hall devices as B-field sensors and, more recently as E-field sensors is well established. Here we report the real-space voltage response of InSb/AlInSb micro-Hall devices to not only local E-, and B-fields but also to photo-excitation using scanning probe microscopy. We show that the ultrafast generation of localised photocarriers results in conductance perturbations analogous to those produced by local E-fields. Our experimental results are in good agreement with tight-binding transport calculations in the diffusive regime. At room temperature, samples exhibit a magnetic sensitivity of >500 nT/ âHz, an optical noise equivalent power of >20 pW/ âHz (Î» = 635 nm) comparable to commercial photoconductive detectors, and charge sensitivity of >0.04 e/ âHz comparable to that of single electron transistors.

Dynamics of the RHEED patterns in the process of Ge hut array formation is investigated at low and high temperatures of Ge deposition. Different dynamics of RHEED patterns during the deposition of Ge atoms in different growth modes is observed, which reflects the difference in adatom mobility and their 'condensation' fluxes from Ge 2D gas on the surface for different modes, which in turn control the nucleation rates and densities of Ge clusters. Data of HRTEM studies of multilayer Ge/Si heterostructures are presented with the focus on low-temperature formation of perfect films.Heteroepitaxial Si p-i-n-diodes with multilayer stacks of Ge/Si(001) quantum dot dense arrays built in intrinsic domains have been investigated and found to exhibit the photo-emf in a wide spectral range from 0.8 to 5 Î¼m. An effect of wide-band irradiation by infrared light on the photo-emf spectra has been observed. Photo-emf in different spectral ranges has been found to be differently affected by the wide-band irradiation. A significant increase in photo-emf is observed in the fundamental absorption range under the wide-band irradiation. The observed phenomena are explained in terms of positive and neutral charge states of the quantum dot layers and the Coulomb potential of the quantum dot ensemble. A new design of quantum dot infrared photodetectors is proposed.By using a coherent source spectrometer, first measurements of terahertz dynamical conductivity (absorptivity) spectra of Ge/Si(001) heterostructures were performed at frequencies ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 THz in the temperature interval from 300 to 5 K. The effective dynamical conductivity of the heterostructures with Ge quantum dots has been discovered to be significantly higher than that of the structure with the same amount of bulk\n\nQuantum State Transfer from a Single Photon to a Distant Quantum-Dot Electron Spin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Yu; He, Yu-Ming; Wei, Yu-Jia; Jiang, Xiao; Chen, Kai; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei; Schneider, Christian; Kamp, Martin; HÃ¶fling, Sven\n\n2017-08-01\n\nQuantum state transfer from flying photons to stationary matter qubits is an important element in the realization of quantum networks.

Here, we develop a method to coherently and actively control the single-photon frequency bins in superposition using electro-optic modulators, and measure the spin-photon entanglement with a fidelity of 0.796 Â±0.020 . Further, by Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type state projection on the frequency, path, and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon, we demonstrate quantum state transfer from a single photon to a single electron spin confined in an InGaAs quantum dot, separated by 5 m. The quantum state mapping from the photon's polarization to the electron's spin is demonstrated along three different axes on the Bloch sphere, with an average fidelity of 78.5%.\n\nCircular dichroism in photo-single-ionization of unoriented atoms.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeagin, James M\n\n2002-01-28\n\nWe predict circular dichroism in photo-single-ionization angular distributions from spherically symmetric atomic states if the ionized electron is detected using two-slit interferometry.

Generally speaking there are two classes of mechanism for photocurrent generation: those involving separation of electrons and holes, and thermoelectric effects driven by electron temperature gradients. Here we introduce a new member in the latter class: the photo-Nernst effect. In graphene devices in a perpendicular magnetic field we observe photocurrent generated uniformly along the free edges, with opposite sign at opposite edges. The signal is antisymmetric in field, shows a peak versus gate voltage at the neutrality point flanked by wings of opposite sign at low fields, and exhibits quantum oscillations at higher fields. These features are all explained by the Nernst effect associated with laser-induced electron heating. This `photo-Nernstâ current provides a simple and clear demonstration of the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation in a gapless material.\n\nSingle-step fabrication of quantum funnels via centrifugal colloidal casting of nanoparticle films\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Jin Young; Adinolfi, Valerio; Sutherland, Brandon R.; Voznyy, Oleksandr; Kwon, S.

This powerful method has yet to be deployed in the context of nanoparticlesâyet sizeâeffect tuning of quantum dots is among their most distinctive and application-relevant features. Here we report the first gradient nanoparticle films to be constructed in a single step. By creating a stable colloid of nanoparticles that are capped with electronic-conduction-compatible ligands we were able to leverage centrifugal casting for thin-films devices. This new method, termed centrifugal colloidal casting, is demonstrated to form films in a bandgap-ordered manner with efficient carrier funnelling towards the lowest energy layer. We constructed the first quantum-gradient photodiode to be formed in a single deposition step and, as a result of the gradient-enhanced electric field, experimentally measured the highest normalized detectivity of any colloidal quantum dot photodetector.
