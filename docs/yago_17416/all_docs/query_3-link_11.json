        "text": "Andrzej Wajda is an Academy Award-winning director. He is the most prominent filmmaker in Poland known for Das gelobte Land (1975), Der Mann aus Eisen (1981), and Das Massaker von Katyn (2007).\n\nHe was Born on March 6, 1926, in Suwalki, Poland. His mother, Aniela Wajda, was a teacher at a Ukrainian school. His father, Jakub Wajda, was a captain in the Polish infantry. Wajda described his childhood as a happy pastoral country life before the Second World War. In 1939, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. In 1940, Wajda's father was killed by Stalin's agents in the Katyn massacre.\n\nYoung Wajda survived the Second World War with his mother and his brother in Nazi-occupied Poland. In 1942, Wajda joined the Polish resistance and served in the Armia Krajowa until the war ended in 1945. In 1946 he moved to Kraków. There Wajda went to Academy of Fine Arts. He studied painting, particularly the impressionist and post-impressionist painting, and was especially fond of Paul Cezanne. From 1950-1954 he studied film directing at the High Film School in Lódz under directors Jerzy Toeplitz and Aleksander Ford. Later, Wajda described the influential and eye-opening experience from seeing French avant-garde films, like Ballet mécanique (1924) by artist-director Fernand Léger.\n\nIn 1955 he made his debut as director of full-length Eine Generation (1955), about the generation of youth coming of age during the Nazi occupation of Poland. His award-winning Der Kanal (1957) and Asche und Diamant (1958) concluded the trilogy about life in Poland during WWII. Although he was under pressure from the Soviet-dominated Polish authorities, Wajda positioned himself as an artist who was above the conflict. He still managed to show the undeclared civil war between two anti-Nazi Polish forces, which were divided by political ideology: the Polish communists and the partisans - folk heroes of the Home Army.\n\nHis Oscar-nominated Das gelobte Land (1975) was a work of multi-layered allegory and Symbolism. Wajda's witty depiction of the 19th century capitalism in Poland actually alluded to the contemporary Communist politics. The shooting of workers in the final scenes was actually unmasking of the official politics of killing workers in the Soviet Union in 1962, under Nikita Khrushchev, and in Poland a few years later. The story of a film student who traces the life of defamed \"hero\" in Der Mann aus Marmor (1977) was a deconstruction of the false impressions that official propaganda was using to brainwash the public. The same main characters in Der Mann aus Eisen (1981) continued unmasking the Communist regime's manipulations against working class people. In 1981, Wajda joined the \"Solidarity\" labor movement of Lech Walesa.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991 Wajda was elected Senator of the Republic of Poland. From 1992 to 1994 he was Member of Presidential Council for Culture. In 1994 he founded the Center of Japanese Art and Technology in Kraków, and was awarded the Order of Rising Sun in Japan (1995). Wajda was President of Polish Film Association (1978-1983). He was Member of \"Solidarity\" Lech Walesa Council (1981-1989). He won an honorary Oscar (2000) for his contribution to cinema, and an honorary Golden Bear (2006) at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nWajda's Das Massaker von Katyn (2007) was nominated for Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2008, and received many other awards and nominations. The film shows historic events in Katyn during WWII, where Wajda's father was among thousands of Polish officers killed by Soviet communists under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. Wajda's film was well received by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, who initially opened the facts about Katyn to help people understand each other and overcome the tragic past.\n\n\"We never hoped to live to see the fall of the Soviet Union, to see Poland as a free country\", said Andrzej Wajda.\n\nRoman Polanski is a Polish film director, producer, writer and actor. Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he is considered one of the few truly international filmmakers. Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933.\n\nHis parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began. On Germany's invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were all sent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent to two different concentration camps: His father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz where she was murdered. Roman witnessed his father's capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at first wandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives. Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating which left him with a fractured skull.\n\nLocal people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed little concerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find. Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war's end in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen another career. In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda's Eine Generation (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School. His early shorts such as Zwei Männer und ein Schrank (1958), Der Dicke und der Dünne (1961) and Ssaki (1962), showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships. His feature debut, Messer im Wasser (1962), was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme. It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France. While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, Gérard Brach, who eventually became his long-time collaborator. The next two films, Ekel (1965) and Wenn Katelbach kommt... (1966), made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Rosemaries Baby (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974).\n\nIt seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. It wasn't until Der Pianist (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award.\n\nHe still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in Eine reine Formalität (1994).\n\nWojciech Wiszniewski was a son of a lawyer Wlodzimierz Wiszniewski, who died when the boy was only five. In order to make ends meet his mother Irena Czajkowska decided to rent rooms in their apartment to the students of the Film School in Lódz. Thanks to that her two sons got acquainted with a lot of future renowned film directors, such as Roman Polanski, Andrzej Kostenko, Stefan Schabenbeck or Henryk Kluba. The two brothers got so fascinated with cinema and carefree lives of film-makers that they decided to make their living in the same way. And they both succeeded in it. Wojciech became a director, while his elder brother Wlodzimierz Wiszniewski started his acting career.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1969 Wojciech Wiszniewski was a student at the world-famous PWSFTviT (Polish National Academy of Film, Theatre and TV in Lódz). The first two years he spent in the Department of Cinematography and then moved to the Department of Directing due to various health problems (bad eyesight, heart failures). Wiszniewski was one of the school's best and most promising students. His fellow students on the same year included Marcel Lozinski, Tomasz Zygadlo and Maciej Wojtyszko.\n\nHe managed to make merely 12 films (6 student shorts, 5 documentary short subjects and 1 TV feature) before his premature death of heart attack at the age of 34. In spite of this Wiszniewski has been considered one of the most outstanding personalities of his generation and without a doubt a classic of Polish documentary cinema. Although his shorts made him a master of innovative documentary film-making, most of them were shelved by the government censors, who also disabled him to eventually make his own feature debut. The last years of his life he spent fighting for making an adaptation of the novel \"Królobójcy\" ('King Slayers') by Jerzy Lojek about the kidnapping of King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski by the Bar Confederates. Wiszniewski died suddenly a few days before the shooting was scheduled to begin.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, painter Joanna Milobedzka-Wiszniewska, and their son Mateusz.\n\nHaving graduated from FAMU in Prague film (1971), Agnieszka Holland returned to Poland and began her film career working with Krzysztof Zanussi as assistant director, and Andrzej Wajda as her mentor. Her first feature film was PROVINCIAL ACTORS (1978), one of the flagship pictures of the \"cinema of moral disquiet\" and the winner of the International Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980. Subsequently, she made the films FEVER (1980) and THE LONELY WOMAN (1981). In 1981, just before the declaration of the state of emergency in Poland, Agnieszka Holland emigrated to France.\n\nShe directed ANGRY HARVEST (1985) which was nominated for a foreign-language Oscar. Her film EUROPA EUROPA (1990) also received a U.S. Academy Award nomination (best screenplay) and IN DARKNESS (2011) was again nominated as best foreign-language film. She also collaborated with her friend Krzysztof Kieslowski on the screenplay of his trilogy, THREE COLOURS (1993).\n\nHolland's other films include TO KILL A PRIEST (1988), OLIVIER, OLIVIER (1992), THE SECRET GARDEN (1993), TOTAL ECLIPSE (1995), WASHINGTON SQUARE (1997), THE THIRD MIRACLE (1999), SHOT IN THE HEART (2001), JULIE WALKING HOME (2001), COPYING BEETHOVEN (2006), IN DARKNESS (2011), BURNING BUSH (2013), SPOOR (2017), MR. JONES (2019) and CHARLATAN (2020). She also directed several episodes of many notable TV series, including THE WIRE, JAG, COLD CASE, TREME (for the pilot of the latter she was nominated for an Emmy) and HOUSE OF CARDS. Agnieszka Holland has also written or co-written screenplays for films made by other directors and directed plays for Polish television. She was elected chairwoman of the Board of the European Film Academy in 2014 and was elected as its President in 2021."
