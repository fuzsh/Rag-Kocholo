        "text": "A well-to-do woman, and what I presume are her daughter and son are smuggling clothes, food and beauty products in their Fiat from Italy back into Poland. They are stopped at the border and initially everything appears to be going well and then the titular intrusive act is demanded.\n\nA weird one this, it flits between being dreamy and being gritty and is made even disparate by occasional TV adverts for the products they are trying to smuggle. I'd file it under odd but worth a poke.\n\nWeird Frankenstein of a movie, combining commentary on Polish consumptionist tendencies in a vacuum of border control. However, the setting of the movie is ugly and unsettling but not in an interesting way.\n\nThe film tries to be hip and avangarde with editing advertisements into the movie but it comes off as very pretentious. As topping, let's add obnoxious music and annoying child actor giving a terrible performance.\n\nThe role of the child is annoying even in the script. Additionally it's also very questionable and uncomfortable, borderline pedophilic.\n\nAlso, Leszczy≈Ñski has an obsession with putting random naked women in his movies. And in this instance, the unnecessity of it is very jarring and aggresive.\n\nEven Maklakiewicz and Mazurkiewcz cannot help the film with their somewhat solid performances."
