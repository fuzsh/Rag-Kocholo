        "text": "POLISH SHORTS AND ŁÓDŹ FILM SCHOOL IN CLERMONT-FERRAND\n\n30.01.2018\n\nThis year's edition of the festival in Clermont-Ferrand, Europe's biggest short film festival, will begin on February 2nd. Three Polish films entered the festival competition this year. The festival will also host a special screening of the films made in the Łódź Film School. The latest Polish short productions will also be presented during the film market organised with the festival, where POLISH SHORTS stand will open for the twelfth time.\n\nThree productions will represent Poland this year in the competition sections in Clermont-Ferrand. Two short fiction films were selected to the international competition: \"Jerry\" by Roman Przylipiak and \"Tremors\" by Dawid Bodzak, as well as one short documentary \"Dust\" by Jakub Radej.\n\nDuring this edition of the festival the audience will be able to see the Carte blanche to Poland’s National Film School of Łódź programme, prepared by the Łódź Film School to celebrate its 70th anniversary. It will be a retrospective of the films made in the School, which will present both productions from the last few years and school projects from the renown filmmakers like Andrzej Wajda and Roman Polanski.\n\nIn the retrospective we will see:\n\nProgramme 1:\n\nTwo Men and a Wardrobe, dir. Roman Polański\n\nEcho, dir. Magnus von Horn\n\nZabawa [A Game], dir. Witold Leszczyński\n\nErotique, dir. Jerzy Skolimowski\n\nBirthday, dir. Jenifer Malmqvist\n\nSquare, dir. Zbigniew Rybczyński\n\nRogalik, dir. Paweł Ziemilski\n\nKirk Douglas, dir. Feridun Erol, Marek Piwowski\n\nProgramme 2:\n\nWhile You're Asleep, dir. Andrzej Wajda\n\nThe Egg, dir.

Renata Gąsiorowska\n\nAs every year POLISH SHORTS stand, prepared by the Krakow Film Foundation, will open at the Short Film Market that takes place next to the festival. Accredited professionals and guests from around the world will be able to learn about latest Polish short productions, become familiar with the festival market and make connections with Polish producers, sales agents and festival representatives. Apart from the KFF Sales & Promotion, in Clermont-Ferrand we will be able to meet representatives of the Łódź Film School, New Europe Film Sales, Munk Studio and Running Rabbits Films. The filmmakers whose films were selected to the festival programme will also be present.\n\nApart from that, the market will host a premiere of the POLISH SHORTS 2017/18 publication, which offers an online access to Polish films including seven short fiction films and seven animations.\n\nAdditionally, 107 Polish titles will be available in the market's video library.\n\nThis year's Polish finalist of the co-production forum EURO CONNECTION is Michał Poniedzielski's project \"Practical Man” ."
