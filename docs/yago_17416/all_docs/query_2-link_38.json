        "text": "The Filmladen Kassel opened in the converted interior of a former storage building in Goethestrasse in the summer of 1981. Its programming offers a counterpoint to mainstream cinema, focusing since its inception on independent productions, film d’auteur, and experimental and documentary film. Dedicated to a critical and open approach, the association supplements its screenings with discussions and workshops. In 1982, just one year after its founding, the Filmladen Kassel hosted a “travelling documentary film festival” featuring films against fascism, environmental destruction, and nuclear power, as well as films about house squatting and pacifism, thus launching what would eventually come to be called the Kassel Documentary Film and Video Festival. In 2017, the festival is presenting its 34th edition.\n\nDuring the final week of documenta 14 in Kassel, Filmladen Kassel presents Final Cut, a selection of riveting yet seldom-seen films chosen by documenta 14 Artistic Director Adam Szymczyk."
