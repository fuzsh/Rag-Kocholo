        "text": "We offer only authentic and original Polish posters, occasionally official reprints. On the website, in the description of each poster, the year of printing is given (if the year of printing is 1964, it means that the poster is 60 years old). The number of posters is limited; information about the edition is often included in the printer's footer. Posters are also copyrighted. We do not make reprints or copies upon request.\n\nCondition of Posters is usually very good. In the case of older prints, some imperfections, small tears on edges or slightly visible folds are acceptable. We inform you in the case of considerable defects. On request, we provide a detailed description of particular poster. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us→"
