        "text": "If you've been reading TFE for any length of time, you already know we're obsessive about Oscar's Foreign Language Film race, last year retitled to Best International Feature Film. Normally we've long since begun talking about the submission list, but 2020 remains an unruly unusual beast. But we do have two pieces of news to share regarding our favourite non-actress based category.\n\nFirst, we've neglected to mention that Oscar's longer-than-usual release eligibility period has also affected Best International Film...\n\nThat's a category that doesn't actually follow the January 1st to December 31st calendar to begin with in a normal year. Films that are submitted to represent a country in this category generally have to be released in that country between October 1st of the previous year to September 30th of the year of Oscar submission. For the 93rd Academy Awards, that period has been extended. The eligibility period will be October 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2020.\n\nEven though each country now has three additional months of releases to consider -- so we'll be hearing the official list much later than usual -- one country has already selected.\n\nPoland will be sending Never Gonna Snow Again, a comedy about a masseur who develops a cult following that is premiering at the Venice Film Festival on September 6th. Ukranian British actor Alec Utgoff (Stranger Things, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation), who generally works in English language cinema, headlines. It's from the female director Malgorzata Szumowska (The Other Lamb, Elles) here co-directing for the first time with her frequent collaborator Michal Englert, who is also the film's co-writer and cinematographer. This is the 5th time Poland has submitted a film directed by a woman to the Oscars. The four previous female-helmed submissions were: Copernicus (1973, co-directed by Ewa Petelska and her husband Czeslaw Petelski), The Welts (2004, Magdalena Piekorz), In Darkness (2011, Agnieszka Holland), and Spoor (2017, Agnieszka Holland).\n\nHere's the teaser...\n\nPOLAND'S OSCAR STATS\n\nSubmitting since 1963\n\n52 Total Submissions\n\n12 Nominations\n\n1 Win\n\nKnife in the Water (Polanski, 1963)\n\nPharaoh (Kawalerowicz, 1966)\n\nThe Deluge (Hoffman, 1974)\n\nThe Promised Land (Wajda, 1975)\n\nNights and Days (Antczak, 1976)\n\nThe Maids of Wilko (Wajda, 1979)\n\nMan of Iron (Wajda, 1981)\n\nKatyn (Wajda, 2007)\n\nIn Darkness (Holland, 2011)\n\nIda (Pawlikowski, 2014) WINNER\n\nCold War (Pawlikowski, 2018)\n\nCorpus Christi (Komasa, 2019)\n\nMost frequently submitted directors\n\nAndrzej Wajda (9 submissions, 4 nominated films, Wajda also received an Honorary Oscar)\n\nJerzy Kawalerowicz (3 submissions, 1 nominated film)\n\nKrzysztof Kieślowki (3 submissions, 0 nominated films, Kieślowski was also nominated for Best Director/Screenplay for Three Colors Red, which was not eligible for this category)\n\nKrzysztof Zanussi (3 submissions, 0 nominated films)\n\nPawel Pawlikowski (2 submissions, 2 nominated films, 1 winning film, and Pawlikowski was also nominated for Best Director once)\n\nAgnieskza Holland (2 submissions, 1 nominated film)\n\n[TIE] Witold Leszczyński, Kazimierz Kutz, Feliks Falk (2 submissions, 0 nominated films)\n\nMost Oscar-honored Polish artists\n\nJanusz Kamiński, Cinematographer (6 nominations, 2 wins)\n\nRoman Polanski, Director (5 nominations across 3 categories, 1 win for Best Director, plus a Foreign Film nomination)\n\n[TIE] Anton Grot, Art Director and Rudolph Maté, Cinematographer (5 nominations each)\n\nBronislaw Kaper, Composer (4 nominations, 1 win)\n\nAnna B Sheppard, Costume Designer (3 nominations)\n\n[TIE] Lukasz Zal, Cinematographer and Kryzsztof Kieslowki (2 nominations each)\n\nZbigniew Rybczyńsky (1 nomination and win for animated short)\n\nPawel Pawlikowski, Director (1 nomination for Best Director, plus a Best Foreign Film win out of 2 Foreign film nominations)\n\nAgnieska Holland, Director (1 nomination for Screenplay, plus two Foreign Film nominations... one from West Germany)\n\nAnd a special honorary case. Did you know that Samuel Goldwyn, of Old Hollywood production fame, was born in Poland? He produced silent classics like Tonight or Never and Ben-Hur, and later sound classics like Ball of Fire, The Best Years of Our Lives, The Little Foxes, and Wuthering Heights among many more. He received 3 Honorary prizes from the Academy (two Thalbergs and one Jean Hersholt)\n\nFellow Pole, here. Thank you for this article! Pola Negri was Polish as well but I know she was never nominated.\n\nI think the best Polish films submitted for Best Foreign Language Film were actually included, especially 1970s classics. I just wish at least one of them won back then. My only regret is that not one of 3 submissions of Krzysztof Kieslowski was nominated. He deserved it.\n\nI was afraid \"Corpus Christi\" will be among 5 pre-qualifiers snubbed (that must suck) so it was a very welcome surprise to see it announced.\n\n\"Never Gonna Snow Again\" has also A-list of Polish actors: Agata Kulesza (Ida, Cold War), Maja Ostaszewska (Katyn, Body), Andrzej Chyra (Katyn, In the Name Of), Katarzyna Figura (Pret-a-Porter, Kiler) and Weronika Rosati (True Detective, Luck)."
