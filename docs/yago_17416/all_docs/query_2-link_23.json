        "text": "MATTHEW'S DAYS\n\nSymposium\n\nPlagued by premonitions and nightmares and fear of loneliness, the oversensitive Matthew lives with his sister by the side of a lake deep in the forest. One day his sister comes home with a man – reason enough, for Matthew, to leave the world of humans for good. A purist study of two siblings in which the inner turmoil of the hero who gives the film its title is reflected in intense landscape images. Inspired by the powerful visual lyricism of Swedish silent films, and counterpointed with the baroque music of Arcangelo Corellis, the film has something of an antique drama. The debut feature screened at Cannes in 1968, and also received a foreign-language Oscar nomination.\n\nPreceded by Bogdan Dziworski´s SKIING SCENES WITH FRANZ KLAMMER (21 min).\n\nProvided by: Filmoteka Narodowa\n\nSales: WFO Lódz\n\nPlagued by premonitions and nightmares and fear of loneliness, the oversensitive Matthew lives with his sister by the side of a lake deep in the forest.
