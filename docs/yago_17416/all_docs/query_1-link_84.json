        "text": "An excellent example of such a thoughtful, deep, professional analysis is the book by film critic Alexander Fedorov “Polish Album: Movies Notes”, which reveals the theme of Polish cinematography and its reflection in the mirror of Soviet and Russian film criticism. This book continues the series of film studies publications by Professor Alexander Fedorov on Soviet and foreign cinematography. Some of these books have already been talked about in the film and media press, and some of them have won awards from the Guild of Film Critics and Film Critics. The material of this book might be of interest for higher-school teachers, students, graduate students, researchers, film critics, cinema scholars, journalists, as well as for the wide range of readers who are interested in the history of cinema art, problems of cinema, film criticism and film sociology. In connection with the publication of the monograph Alexander Fedorov gave an interview to Professor Marina Tselykh.\n\nNo longer a trivial entertainment: Popular cinemain Poland after 2000This article discusses two types of popular films produced in Poland after 2000, a subgenre of romantic comedy, which I label “sexual comedy”, represented by the films of Andrzej Saramonowicz and Tomasz Konecki, and “popular arthouse film”, represented by Dzień świra Day of the Wacko, 2002 by Marek Koterski. To understand the specificity of Polish popular cinema in this period, the author locates it in the postwar history of filmmaking in this country, arguing that making popular films was met in this country with great resistance. The situation has changed after the fall of state socialism, when cinema had to be more receptive to the audience’s demands. The films discussed in this article reflect both this pressure and the difficulties involved in making such films.\n\nThe idea for this book originated in our observation that while there is a growing body of innovative work dealing with transnationality in world cinemas, studies devoted to this phenomenon tend to omit Eastern European cinemas, including Polish films, an area of special interest to the editors of this volume. For example, Transnational Cinema does not include even one chapter devoted to films or filmmakers from Eastern Europe. They are also typically omitted from the studies of “world cinema”. Equally, histories of Polish cinema, irrespective of whether they are written by Polish film historians working in Poland, Polish émigré authors or non-Polish authors, tend to ignore transnational phenomena or do not account for their difference from films made within Polish borders. Arguably Paul Coates’ consideration of the “temporary exile” of filmmakers like Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Zanussi, and the more permanent exilic condition of filmmakers like Jerzy Skolimowski and Agnieszka Holland in one of the chapters of The Red and the White is an exception to this rule. However, at best this is only a start, since ultimately all of these examples are seen in light of the national cinema problem of whether “prolonged absence may sap the will and – more importantly – the ability to speak for one’s countrymen.” Despite the promise of a consideration of Polish cinema post-1989 and “the question of co-production”, such considerations are only secondary preambles to the main focus of the chapter on the cinema of Kieślowski. But even here, the transnational dimensions of his work are de-empahsized, authorized by a reading in terms of Kieślowski’s supposed “demotion of politics.” Ultimately, this points to the need to expand the consideration of transnationality, co-production and exile beyond the limits of their current articulations in relation to Polish cinema."
