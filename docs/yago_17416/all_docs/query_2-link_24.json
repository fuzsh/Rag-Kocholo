        "text": "This review was originally published on April 15th, 2023.\n\nNow here’s a film I have to share with you. I stumbled upon this film when going through the list of horror films released in 1969. I first read the title as The Man Who Taught Life, and seeing that it was another obscure European film, I really believed I was in for another arty-farty snoozefest.\n\nBut then I started watching the film. It's actually titled The Man Who Thought Life. No, that is not a typo, and yes, it actually holds significance to the film's plot. I didn't even know what country it was from. Was it Swedish? Norwegian? Turns out it was Danish, written by Jens Ravn and Henrik Stangerup, based on a 1938 novel by Valdemar Holst, and directed by Ravn. I'll have to keep these names in mind.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was how gorgeously shot the film is. The man responsible for these images is Witold Leszczynski. He utilizes a lot of symmetrical framing and 90-degree pans. I know it’s the obvious comparison, but the main person that comes to mind is Wes Anderson (and his cinematographer Robert Yeoman). He must have seen this film at some point, and possibly early in his career. The films of Peter Greenaway, like The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, might also spring to mind.\n\nOur main character is a Dr. Max Holst (subtle, Valdemar), who encounters a patient named Steinmetz in the psych ward who has inexplicably snuck in some cognac and a box of cigars. When the doctor confronts him about this, Steinmetz refuses to answer, before going on a tirade about how humanity has not realized the full potential of the mind. Later that night, Steinmetz escapes and leaves a note telling the doctor to meet him at a discrete location.\n\nThe two meet and Steinmetz takes the doctor back to his lavish mansion. The interior design is strikingly reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, with the elegiac antique furnishings sitting atop a bright, luminescent white tile floor.\n\nSteinmetz agrees to tell the doctor all his secrets, if he vows to keep his mouth shut, and give him a brain operation. The doctor agrees, and Steinmetz explains how he is able to conjure living beings with his mind, but he can only concentrate for so long before the beings dissolve. He wants the doctor to operate on the basis cranii, in order to unlock the power to create and maintain a living creature for as long as he likes. He intends to create human beings. It's at this point that Dr. Holst pulls out of the agreement, and from then on, his life spirals out of control.\n\nI don't want to spoil what happens afterwards, but it explores a concept that I had seen before in a few films, but done in a way that felt fresh and exciting. This is the most impressive film I've seen in a long time.\n\nThis is just the kind of film I want to see more of. I love the way it’s photographed, scored, paced, and scripted. It creates such a great atmosphere and builds the tension perfectly. This may damn well be a near perfect film, I can’t think of any real flaws.\n\nIt does seem to take some cues from recent Hollywood films, like the previously mentioned 2001, as well as The Graduate, with a thrilling chase towards a wedding chapel. I'm not even sure if these were intentional homages, but nonetheless, they don't distract from the film's unique and engrossing nature.\n\nIt's always such a delight to discover a film that you'd never heard of before, and had such low expectations for, and be totally taken aback by it. If only more genre cinema of the time was as stimulating as this."
