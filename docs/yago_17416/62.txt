It is really a pity for Polish cinema that extraordinary films directed by its relatively lesser known directors have been superseded by the towering influence of famous figures of Polish cinema. In many ways, this trend has deprived serious cinema fans to acquaint themselves with other remarkable films made in Poland. Zywot Mateusza/The Days of Matthew by Witold Leszczynski (1933-2007) is one such ideal film which should be seen by more cinema enthusiasts as it gives them a chance to explore the films directed by him. He is best remembered as one of those rare breed of film directors who believed that the form is more important than the content. This is something evident in most of his successful films namely Konopielka (1981),Siekierezada (1986) and Kolos (1993) which have all emerged as true portrayals of 'rural life'. The days of Matthew is based on "The Birds" written by famous Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas whose works about rural people are known for their tremendous psychological insight. Witold Leszczynski made some minor changes in the book in order to direct a film which would appear to be more authentic in its Polish settings. One of leading women directors of Polish cinema Wanda Jakubowska served as this film's artistic adviser.The film is about the relationship which rural people share with nature. It is an intimate tale of a simpleton who gets affected by most ordinary things for which most people would not even bother to bat an eyelid namely shooting of a bird or felling of a tree. Matthew's role is played with great aplomb and maturity by leading Polish actor Franciszek Pieczka who has appeared in Kieslowski's films such as Blizna (1976). The Days of Matthew was awarded on several occasions most notably at Cannes Jeunesse and Semana International De Cine De Valladolid.
