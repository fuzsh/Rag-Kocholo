Best Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Founded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant organization that has grown from one original chapter to nearly 3,000 chapters worldwide, positively impacting the lives of over 1.3 million people with and without IDD. Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 states and in 45 countries around the world.

The Inaugural Seneca Valley Best Buddies Walk will be a wonderful opportunity to come together at a fun event to celebrate our students and individuals with special abilities, while raising funds for Best Buddies. Please join us for a morning of friendship, music, face painting, crafts, gift basket raffles, light refreshments, and a special appearance by the SV Unified Bocce Team. The event begins at 9:00 and we will walk together at 10:00, followed by more time to relax and enjoy activities until the conclusion at 12:00.
