Best Buddies International was founded by Anthony Shriver, son of Eunice Shriver(founder of Special Olympics) in 1989 to help promote the inclusion of people with IDD through three areas- friendship, jobs, and leadership development.

Best Buddies International develops programs through middle schools, high schools, colleges, and corporations to help support our mission of inclusion for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities(IDD).
