        "text": "Cambridge, MA – April 25, 2024 — Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT), the world’s leading telematics service provider, today announced that Anthony Shriver, the Founder & CEO of Best Buddies International and advocate for road safety, has joined its Road Safety Advisory Board. Shriver is renowned for his dedication to creating meaningful relationships between individuals with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) through Best Buddies International.\n\n“As an avid cyclist, road safety isn’t just a professional concern for me, but a deeply personal one. Every time I hit the road on my bike, I know the risks involved, not just for cyclists but for everyone who shares the road,” said Anthony K. Shriver, Founder, Chairman & CEO of Best Buddies International. “CMT’s mission and the goals of the Road Safety Advisory Board resonate deeply with me. By leveraging technology and data to understand driving behaviors, we’re protecting people and their families from the devastating consequences of car crashes.”\n\nShriver established Best Buddies International in 1989, aiming to bridge the gap between people with and without IDD through one-to-one friendships. Leveraging the energy and commitment of university students, Shriver has expanded the organization into a globally recognized non-profit with a presence on six continents, promoting integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living opportunities for individuals with IDD.\n\n“We’re thrilled to welcome Anthony Shriver to the CMT Road Safety Advisory Board. At Best Buddies International, his leadership has built the organization to be a global force for good, mobilizing communities in 45 countries,” said Ryan McMahon, CMT’s Road Safety Board Executive Sponsor. “Anthony’s experience and passion for road safety will be invaluable to the Road Safety Board and expanding CMT’s mission. His insights and experience in community engagement will play a crucial role in advancing our initiatives to improve road safety globally.”\n\nCMT’s research reveals the driving behaviors that lead to crashes, giving road safety officials the data they need to implement new policies and plans. The board’s primary goal is to advise the CMT team on how to grow the impact of our life-saving technology, preventing crashes and minimizing their impact on society.\n\nBest Buddies now operates 11 programs, positively affecting people in every US state and 45 countries. Shriver, a Georgetown University alumnus and recipient of numerous international awards and honorary degrees, also shares a personal commitment to road safety as an avid cyclist.\n\nAbout Cambridge Mobile Telematics\n\nCambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) is the world’s largest telematics service provider.
