        "text": "Mission:\n\nBest Buddies International is an international nonprofit dedicated to establishing a global movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nWho we serve:\n\nThe IDD community that Best Buddies serves include, but is not limited to, people with Down Syndrome, autism, Fragile X, Williams syndrom, traumatic brain injurty and other undiagnosed disabilities.\n\nPrograms:\n\nBest Buddies is the world’s largest organization dedicated to ending the social, physical and economic isolation of the 200 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Our programs empower the special abilities of people with IDD by helping them form meaningful friendships with their peers, secure successful jobs, live independently, improve public speaking, self-advocacy and communication skills, and feel valued by society. Join the UW chapter today, and help to make a difference here in your community!\n\nLevels of Involvement\n\nThere are two levels of involvement in UW Best Buddies: peer buddy or associate member. As a peer buddy, you are matched in a one-to-one friendship with an adult in the community with IDD. You are responsible for attending bi-weekly meetings and hanging out with your buddy at least once a month, as well as making regular contact with your buddy via text, phone call, etc.\n\nFor students that would still like to be involved in Best Buddies but cannot commit to being matched in a one-to-one friendship, an associate member is the commitment level for them! There are no requirements for being an associate member; students may come to meetings and socialize as they wish. We will meet you at any commitment level!\n\nIf you have any questions about getting involved with Best Buddies at the University of Washington, email uwashingtonbestbuddies@gmail.com"
