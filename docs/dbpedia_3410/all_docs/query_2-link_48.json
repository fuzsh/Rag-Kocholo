Sign up to be a mentor today!    Have questions? Email us at: international.buddy@mcgill.ca The Buddy program pairs new international students with current students who provide a friendly face, helping hand, and first Montreal friendship that can make a world of difference for new arrivals. Buddies can also offer linguistic support, cultural guidance, and information about life at McGill. Now celebrating its 36th anniversary, the Buddy Program has helped thousands of international students settle into McGill and Montreal. Typical \"buddy\" activities might include: online face to face meetups using any platform (i.e. Zoom, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Google Meet or Houseparty) email or meet online to talk about courses, professors, campus life, clubs, etc. online karaoke, Zumba, or videogames chatting online over a cup of coffee or tea Volunteers and new students are paired on a rolling basis during the summer, allowing new fall students to be in touch with their buddies over the summer. There is no hard deadline for signing up, although it's important for both volunteers and new students to sign up before the term begins in order to ensure a smooth pairing. Student testimonies- “I talked a lot with one of my mentee and I love the relationship that we had. It was great being able to advise him on campus. I think we were well matched and the resources provided by the buddy program were really useful. ” - Winter 2023 Buddy volunteer “My buddy was super friendly and helpful. She made me feel at ease even before I arrived in Canada. She was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions I had. She reached out often and invited me to social events, she made the buddy system seem very natural and informal. She was eager and bubbly and didn't make it seem like buddying was a chore to her, which I appreciate. Thanks :))”- Winter 2023 New Student “It provided a friend when I was moving to a new place, not knowing what to expect. I definitely made the transition to McGill easier. ”- Winter 2023 New Student",
