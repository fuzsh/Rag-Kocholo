        "text": "Best Buddies Turkey was established in 2011, and Turkey became the 50th country to join Best Buddies International, the organization founded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver. For over a decade Best Buddies Turkey has implemented the Project by mainly focusing on initiating School-Based Friendship Programs. Best Buddies Turkey supports nationwide programs, and its ultimate goal is to create more inclusive communities for people with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD). We, Best Buddies Turkey, are contributing to the global impact on supporting those with IDD. Best Buddies Turkey has completed the year 2022 by reaching more than 100 educational institutions together with a project management team who continues the operation. We achieved this success by establishing a system based entirely on national volunteering.\n\nThe Social Good Association/SGA (In Turkish GİD – Güzel İşler Derneği) an NGO based in Bergama/Izmir/TURKEY is accredited by Best Buddies International to run Best Buddies in Turkey. The Social Good Association is a workshop and experience-oriented association that carries out activities aimed at production, development, and sharing with social good."
