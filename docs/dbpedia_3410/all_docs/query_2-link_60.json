        "text": "Have you ever heard someone say \"Happy Friendship Day!\"? You might wonder what it is. For easy understanding, it is a day to celebrate your friendships.\n\nInternational Friendship Day acknowledges the significance of harmonious friendships, ultimately helping in promoting peace and love among human beings.\n\nFriends are people we can share our joys and sorrows with. They are the ones that guide us through the ups and downs in life. Thanks to the Friendship Day celebration, we can honor these individuals who are a crucial part of our life.\n\nFriendship Day is celebrated in many ways, from exchanging cards, gifts, friendship day bands, or hanging out with friends, to honor the friendship bond. So, when is friendship day? Let's find out the answer and other information about this event in today's article.\n\nHistory Of International Friendship Day\n\nWhen did International Friendship Day originate? We will cover the history of this day.\n\nOverview\n\nWe all live in a challenging world. Between cultural discord, discrimination, lack of trust, mistreatment, and miscommunications, prioritizing peace tends to be less present in our society. There is no reason for our world not to live in several harmonious forms.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) was born to help remind us there is always some good in life. This organization first introduced the official International Friendship Day in 2011, aiming to connect people and build connections among countries, cultures, and ideologies.\n\nConnections and Friendship are identical to bonding. Establishing these common bonds goes beyond sharing a favorite pastime or a trait with another group or person, yet includes understanding inclusion and diversity and promoting a global commitment.\n\nWe can still find common ground even in the differences. Physical appearances, political views, music, tastes, opinion differences, and more are not the reason to separate us, people.\n\nRelationships are more important than that, and the United Nations wants to enhance togetherness and kindness every July. Celebrating friendships via simple things such as a coffee hang-out, taking a trip together, or a brief, meaningful note on greeting cards.\n\nOnce again, we, have more common things than we think. Any idea minimizing the amount of disdain and hatred spread throughout our world is the kindness we love to share.\n\nBefore the United Nations officially introduced the International Friendship Day, this idea was proposed in the year of 1958 by a global civil organization named World Friendship Crusade, aiming to boost the peaceful culture via friendship.\n\nFriendship Day's Timeline\n\nFor a summary, we have compiled a timeline of World Friendship Day as follows.\n\n1919: This year, the United States participated in an unofficial Friendship Day before the official designation of the United States.\n\nThe 1930s: Hallmark introduced greeting cards of Friendship Day. Many acknowledge their important relationships via a note or a card.\n\n1958: Paraguay became the first nation to celebrate World Friendship Day across the country in July.\n\n2011: The United Nations officially sets the International Friendship Day to encourage all communities in the world to celebrate this day.\n\nWhen is National Friendship Day?\n\nWe will dive into the time to celebrate the National Friendship Day in the world and the dates of the World Friendship Day.\n\nInternational Friendship Day All Around The World In 2022\n\nHere are some countries to celebrate International Friend Day in the world in 2022.\n\nDates Of The World Friendship Day\n\nThis topic has remained in debate since the inception of Friend Day. Hallmark initially intended to celebrate this day on 2 August. For a while, it was celebrated on the first Sunday of August.\n\nThat said, the organization World Friendship Crusade convinced the UN to change to 30 July. The UN General Assembly ultimately acquiesced on 27 July to make 30 July the official International Day of Friendship date.\n\nNevertheless, this date has remained to change in the United States from year to year. In particular, the 2016 International Friendship Day was celebrated on 7 August.\n\nOne year later, it was organized on 6 August. Countries, including the United States, might use different days to celebrate among regional communities and states.\n\nThe Tradition Of The International Friendship Day\n\nFriends who are always there for us, sacrifice their time with us, and call us out on every stubbornness are those we need to appreciate. People say a friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\nThe meaning of friendship is varying for everyone. And its bond is also different. There are people we have only known for a short time, but they become our best friends. Meanwhile, those we have already known for a long time might not be close to us.\n\nThat's why celebrations and traditions are varying among people. We can use many low-key ways to honor this date, like hosting parties, gift exchange, or simply sending a friendship quote.\n\n1.
