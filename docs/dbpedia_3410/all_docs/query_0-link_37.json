The event was hosted by Best Buddies celebrity supporter Vanessa Hudgens and her mother Gina and Liane and Ava Weintraub.\n\t \n\tThis Mother’s Day Brunch celebrated the incredible mothers of Best Buddies participants and mothers all around the world, paying homage to the gifts of love and friendship that mothers give to their children, especially the mothers of Best Buddies participants.\n\t\n\tThe Brunch included live musical performances by the Hip-Hop Musical, Marlana VanHoose, actress Olivia Culpo and her mother Susan, family-friendly activities and a special awards ceremony honoring the Best Buddies’ Mother of the Year -- Diana Mayor --- the mother of Jack Mayor, who is a Best Buddies Global Ambassador and advocate for others with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\t \n\t“Best Buddies gave my son Jack his best friend, Josie. Best Buddies in turn gave me HOPE! Hope for a better future for all kids like Jack,” said Diana Mayor. “Words cannot express how thankful we are to Anthony K. Shriver for his vision back in 1989, a vision that led to one of countless stories like Jack and Josie’s. Best Buddies is changing lives.”\n\t \n\tSeveral of Best Buddies’ celebrity supporters attended this year’s event including Best Buddies Global Ambassador Cindy Crawford and her daughter Kaia Gerber, actors  Minnie Driver, Lisa Rinna, Lauren Potter,  Kevin Dillon, John Stamos, Greg Germann, and Darren Criss,  among others.\n\t \n\t&quot;Across the globe, mothers act as pillars of love, friendship and strength for their families. Mothers are an invaluable source of encouragement, and above all, they understand us like no one else can,” said Anthony Kennedy Shriver, Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO of Best Buddies International. “My mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, will always be my hero. I would be nowhere without her unending love and guidance. My mother guided me in everything I did. She believed relentlessly in the power of friendship and without her, Best Buddies would not exist. I thank her for her love, passion, leadership and faith in our cause. I am so thankful for her enduring spirit which guides me in the work that I do today on behalf of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.”",
