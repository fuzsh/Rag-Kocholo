        "text": "by Cassie Mattia\n\nBest Buddies International, a groundbreaking nonprofit founded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver to establish a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), has announced that the Best Buddies Friendship Walk will take place April 22, 2023, at Marcum Park in Hamilton for the second time in Southwest Ohio.\n\nSince 2009 more than 250,000 participants have walked in over 60 cities and raised more than $24 million for Best Buddies.\n\nThe Friendship Walk is coming together out of a need for funding in Southwest Ohio. Program numbers have grown significantly, creating a need for more support.\n\n“Our Friendship Walks are one of Best Buddies’ most celebrated events, bringing communities together where they can experience our mission in action and engage with our program participants,” said Anthony K. Shriver, Founder, Chairman & CEO of Best Buddies International. “I am beyond grateful that the important work of this organization will continue, thanks to our participants, volunteers, partners, and the entire community. I am confident that we will continue empowering people with special abilities, connecting advocates, and mobilizing our supporters to create a more inclusive world.”\n\nBest Buddies in Ohio anticipates more than 100 participants lacing up their shoes to walk for inclusion, all working to surpass the 2023 fundraising goal of $35,000. Registration begins at 10:30 AM, and the Walk commences at 11:15 AM at Marcum Park, 116 Dayton Street in Hamilton.\n\nFollowing the Walk, please join Best Buddies for a day of fun, family, wellness, and friendship.\n\nProceeds from the Friendship Walk are fundamental in supporting state programs that provide one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living. These programs can be found in all 50 states and will create promising opportunities for more than 350,000 people this year.\n\nWalk for inclusion. Walk for friendship. Walk for a better Southwest Ohio!\n\nABOUT BEST BUDDIES INTERNATIONAL:\n\nBest Buddies® is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nFounded in 1989 by Anthony K.
