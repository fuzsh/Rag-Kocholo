        "text": "Celebrating Inclusion Figures\n\nTony DeBlois weighed less than 2 pounds, became blind within days and was later diagnosed with autism, but ignoring conventional wisdom, his mother’s love uncovered his musical genius. Tony now plays 20 instruments and knows more than 8,000 songs.\n\nCelebrating Inclusion Figures\n\nSarah Gordy is a British actress, model and dancer – who happens to have Down Syndrome. Gordy made history in 2014 when she played a key role without a handicap in “Crocodiles” at Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre.\n\nCelebrating Inclusion Figures\n\nPranav Bakshi was two years old when he was diagnosed with autism. But his mother, Anupama Bakhshi, decided to not let it become a hurdle in the way of achieving his dreams and so, one day when Pranav expressed his interest in modelling, his mother knew she had to help her son explore fields of his interest."
