        "text": "About Us\n\nBest Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nMembers Benefits\n\nWe are an on-campus organization that promotes friendship between Bentley Students and those with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities in the Waltham area. Typically, we host monthly in person \"pizza party\"-style events where we catch up with friends and play games. Not only is this a great opportunity to meet Waltham community members, but get to know fellow Bentley students. This semester we will be hosting virtual events such as trivia nights and other social events with our buddies."
