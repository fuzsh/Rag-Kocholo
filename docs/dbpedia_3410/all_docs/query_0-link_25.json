        "text": "Miami, FL, March 7, 2024 — This March is Best Buddies Month, where we celebrate the Best Buddies’ mission of inclusion and our friends with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). While this is also the 35th anniversary of Best Buddies, where it was officially founded by Anthony K. Shriver in 1989, the first iteration of Best Buddies was actually created by Shriver in 1987, in a program he created called “Big Buddies.”\n\nClick here to read an article, published in The Hoya, the Georgetown University student newspaper, in 1987, to learn more about the program that would later become the world’s largest international nonprofit organization dedicated to providing friendship, employment, leadership and inclusive living opportunities to people with IDD."
