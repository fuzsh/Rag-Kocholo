        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (June 25, 2024) – Eurest and ESFM, Compass Group USA’s foodservice and facilities management divisions for business and industry, today announced a partnership with Best Buddies International, a nonprofit dedicated to creating opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, inclusive living, and family support for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This new partnership will foster meaningful job opportunities and enhance workplace inclusion for individuals with IDD.\n\nThe partnership focuses on connecting candidates in the Best Buddies Jobs program to a range of entry and mid-level roles across hospitality, food service, administration, janitorial services and facilities management, ultimately creating pathways for individuals with IDD to secure meaningful stable employment and contribute positively to their communities.\n\n“By embracing diversity and providing equitable employment opportunities, we believe we can build stronger, more inclusive communities where everyone feels valued and empowered,” said Natacha Jacque, Eurest/ESFM Senior Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. “Our partnership with Best Buddies is especially meaningful as it allows us to change people’s lives in real and tangible ways.”\n\nThe goals of the partnership include providing opportunities for qualified, dependable talent, creating pathways for stable employment, expanding the partnership’s reach, offering education and resources to team members and supporting community engagement to promote inclusion locally.\n\nEurest and ESFM are piloting the job placement initiative in six markets this year, including Seattle, Phoenix, Des Moines, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte. In addition, Eurest and ESFM will support the Best Buddies Friendship Walk events in select markets, enabling the companies to engage their associates and client communities in a larger way through Best Buddies Friendship Walks.\n\nThe partnership builds upon the longstanding relationship Compass Group has cultivated with Best Buddies across several other food service divisions.\n\n“Currently, an estimated 84% of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities do not have a paid job in the community, and this is why the Best Buddies Jobs program is so important,” said Anthony K. Shriver, Founder, Chairman & CEO, Best Buddies International. “For people with IDD, having a job is life-changing and creates a pathway that provides talented, qualified candidates the ability to secure financial independence and contribute to their communities in a meaningful way.”\n\n###"
