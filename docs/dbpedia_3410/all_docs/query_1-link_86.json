        "text": "What is Best Buddies?\n\nBest Buddies International is a non-profit aimed at fostering connections between intellectually and/or developmentally disabled people and non-disabled people and improving the quality of life of people with disabilities of this nature. Their mission statement reads, “Best Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD)”.\n\nHow did I find out about it?\n\nAfter struggling to find suitable clubs on campus, I stumbled upon a post about the organization in one of the disability-oriented Facebook groups I am a member of and decided to see what they had to offer. I also have dreamt for a while of a platform where disabled and non-disabled people teach about each other’s cultures in the tandem partner-like format I enjoyed so much while learning German. I saw that my school had a chapter and met at a convenient time for my schedule and figured it couldn’t hurt to go to at least one meeting. The name seemed a bit off-putting and euphemistic to me, but I didn’t want to judge a book by its cover.\n\nThe application process\n\nThe application was pretty straightforward and not too time-consuming. I was pleased to see that I was not forced to choose “decline to state” when asked about my gender identity, nor was I forced to pick a lane as a biracial person when it came to describing my race. I do wish they’d update their class level dropdown menu to include graduate students though since, according to staff, we are in fact welcome. I also asked myself what they do with the information provided by applicants when one is asked about prior convictions, but I didn’t get to find out since I have a clean criminal record. After submission, one promptly receives a confirmation email and can then be admitted into chapter meetings.\n\nThe first chapter meeting\n\nThe structure of the meeting gave me a bit of pause. I was lead to the back of the food court where the meeting was being held by two staff members wearing Best Buddies swag directing new members as to where to go. I then checked in, got a name tag and sat down at a table with the other attendees, some of whom were in the middle of playing board games or Jenga and some of whom were drawing or coloring. Overall, I experienced middling rapport with other attendees.\n\nThere was a curious and nearly homogenous divide between the other students at my school and the developmentally disabled people present. As far as I could tell, I was the only person who fit into both demographics and staff was not prepared to assign me a buddy match because they told me that they “don’t get a lot of people who are both”. I was told that I’d get to choose whether to be matched with a “student” or “someone from the transitional program” and to notify them of my decision. The other developmentally disabled people present came from a local day program for young adults who are not on track to earn a high school diploma by age 22.\n\nMy fellow classmates appeared to all be undergraduate women studying to enter very public-facing and people-oriented fields like journalism and psychology. Largely, they gave me budding Nice Lady Therapist vibes. In a couple of them, I sensed some level of savior complex, especially when one gave misplaced praise of one man’s impromptu drawing of himself and his uncle and another kept letting her assigned buddy go first during games.\n\nAfter I played a little bit of Jenga and Connect Four, we moved onto a game of Bingo. This activity just seemed to feel the most natural for all of us out of the ones chosen for us and lended itself to a relative automaticity in generating conversation. Following this, we engaged in more rigidly structured game playing “rotations” where we would switch between tic tac toe, Pictionary, and charades. I can be a kind of competitive person, so playing games a little bit was quite fun. During this portion of the meeting, I also subtly got a sense that some felt in some way separate from or “above” their buddy in some way.\n\nDuring my assigned subgroup’s game of charades, after everyone at the table struggled at length to recognize my pantomime of soldering, one of my classmates suggested that a guy standing a few feet away from the table, who appeared to very visibly and fervently stimming with a green plastic bead necklace, “come give us an easy one”. Later, as the subgroups reconvened into one larger group, I sensed rather intense discomfort coming from one of my classmates as soon as the same man mentioned that he was dating a woman from his program. There was also a woman who did not participate in the second half of the meeting and appeared to be allowed very little personal space by her assigned buddy.\n\nAfter a brief coloring and Jenga session, we were dismissed. Nobody really stuck around afterwards to hang out besides the staff members in charge of cleanup.\n\nTakeaways\n\nI’m on the fence about whether I want to go to another meeting. Part of me wants to be a part of the unglamorous, vulnerable, and difficult work of planting seeds to help people overcome their biases little by little. Part of me also wants to see the extent to which I could help mold the chapter or perhaps come across someone I experience better rapport with at a meeting I have not yet attended. This particular chapter of Best Buddies also provides an experience better than this one. I also might quite simply be having some snobbish feelings about coloring. It wouldn’t be the first time in my life that I initially felt in some vague way that something wasn’t “sophisticated enough” for me and then looked back on my former opinion and cringed. If only I could go back and convince my 13-year-old self that Justin Bieber is just as much of a musician as Béla Bartók ever was and that getting some portion of your fans to buy your music mainly because they think you’re hot is a sign of effective marketing, but I digress.\n\nThe other part of me is alarmed by an unsavory gut feeling that I struggle to fully describe (thanks alexithymia!) paired with multiple concrete red flags that in my opinion, point pretty overtly to a culture of benevolent ableism, infantilization, and cherry picking of members, whether consciously or not, to promote a certain power dynamic and narrative concerning how disability relates to post-secondary education. I also question the extent to which my observations are accurate and am not sure if I’m just gaslighting myself in my usual way when I’m not yet able to give a convincing deposition on the evidence supporting said gut feelings, even though I can’t recall a time my gut feeling has been wrong despite being unable to describe them well.\n\nFurthermore, I am not sure if, with everything else on my plate, that it would be healthy for me to repeatedly show up to a space where I feel like I’m under so much pressure to filter myself and present a highly sanitized, vanilla, and toned-down version of myself to neurotypicals in order to fit into the presentation of disability they find most palatable and unchallenging of their worldview (or make sure they can’t tell I’m not one of them), and where I more or less single handedly take on all of the labor involved in making the space more hospitable. I already felt my impostor syndrome really creeping back up a bit for the first time in a while, which also has something to do with how well living on my own paying my own rent for the first time while freelancing and studying full-time has gone so far (more on that at a later date), but I think the meeting contributed to it somewhat. I can also recognize a lot of feelings of holding back petty demand avoidance in a similar way to when I felt forced to sacrifice any progress I could make academically for the sake of standardized test scores and strictly obey authority at all times. It’s a lot like when I would use the bathroom at school during my pre-college years in the most button-pushing way possible to make a point that no teacher or administrator could put themselves in charge of my body in that way.\n\nNext steps\n\nI emailed one member of staff suggesting a wider variety of games and meeting places while giving some examples that would make those more prone to infantilizing disabled people clutch their pearls (Cards Against Humanity at the school’s bar anybody?) and I got told that they struggle a lot with funding and securing other resources, like almost anything that has to do with disabilities that disabled people don’t pay through the nose (at leas not monetarily) for, but they seem open, at least for the time being, to examining ways to make the experience a bit different. For now, I guess I’ll see how some more meetings go."
