Last week, 9 students joined Best Buddies in Virginia & DC Manager of Transitions Erin Ijzer for a Transitions Workshop. Students learned skills in positive self-talk, self-advocacy, how to present an elevator pitch, and what you want to include in a resume. Topics covered vocational interests, SMART goals, and independent living. \"A fun fact about me is that I have a twin\". These students had a great time engaging with the content covered in the Transitions workshop with Best Buddies! \"I loved learning how to give an elevator pitch and having the opportunity to present my pitch to my peers\" said one twin. \"I really enjoyed learning about what my options are after high school - I didn't know there were so many!\" said the other twin. The Best Buddies Transitions Program aims to support students as they explore their next steps after high school. Are you interested in attending other Transitions workshops? Contact Manager of Transitions, Erin Ijzer at erinijzer@bestbuddies.org.\n\n💚 A huge thank you to Paycom for volunteering with us last Friday! 💚 Their #volunteer work was truly exceptional. They brought incredible energy and dedication, packing chapter welcome bags, rolling t-shirts, writing motivational notes, and more. Their teamwork and organization were wonderful, and the assembly line at the end was spectacular! Our wonderful State Ambassador, Kaitlin Andersen, joined the group to share her experience with Best Buddies in high school and, most recently, at the Best Buddies Leadership Conference. She encouraged everyone to check out their local Best Buddies chapter and join a Friendship Walk in the spring! The efforts of the dedicated volunteers will make a significant impact on our chapter presidents as they start the new school year, encouraging them to create wonderful one-to-one friendships at their schools. Best Buddies is dedicated to ending the social, physical, and economic isolation of the 200 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. On Friday, Paycom brought our mission to life. Thank you! Are you interested in volunteering with us?

Over 2,000 Best Buddies leaders, volunteers, and community advocates from around the globe united at Indiana University Bloomington for a transformative 3-day leadership conference. ✨ High school students, jobs participants, ambassadors, and inclusive living residents from Best Buddies in Virginia & DC came together to imagine, create, lead, and empower the future of the disability rights and inclusion movement. 💃 This dedicated and compassionate group of young individuals is ready to change the world. Highlights included dancing at the opening and closing ceremonies, competing in the Inclusion Olympics, and celebrating at Festival of Friendship. We were motivated by keynote speakers Annette Addo-Yobo, M.A., Mia Armstrong, Mickey Rowe, Kelsey O'Connor, and Kennedy Garcia. Performances by Michale Housefield, Marlana VanHoose, Larger Than Life, Jensen Gering, the Indianapolis Colts Cheerleaders, and Cory Singer added to the excitement. 💛 Over the past 30 years, the Best Buddies Leadership Conference (BBLC) has inspired thousands of leaders to advocate for inclusion and bring about social change in their communities. As Best Buddies in Virginia & DC jobs participant Alex P. says, “Be all you can be.” 💖 Ella N. from Bishop O'Connell High School shared, “My favorite part of LC was being surrounded by individuals of all abilities and getting to come together to support the same cause.” 💙 Adam B. from Meridian High School also shared, “My favorite part of LC was meeting everybody and making new friends. The thing I’m excited to bring back is all the fun activity ideas I got from other members of our delegation. The biggest thing I learned was how to be more inclusive, how to make things more accessible, and to think more in that mindset.” 🙌 Thank you to everyone who attended and made this event possible. Let's continue to advocate and lead for a more inclusive world! #Leadership #SelfAdvocacy #Inclusion #Friendship #InclusiveLiving #IntegratedEmployment\n\n🗣 \"I want to change how people see adults and children with disabilities because we can do things that other people can do. I want people to see what we’re capable of even though we have disabilities and how we do things differently than other people as well.\" 👑 Meet the newest Best Buddies in Virginia & DC Ambassador, Naia Grace. She got started with Best Buddies at the University of Virginia, located in her hometown of Charlottesville, VA. She graduated from Charlottesville High School in 2017 with a standard diploma and was crowned homecoming queen! 🏊♀️ Her favorite hobbies include taking hikes with friends and family, food photography, swimming, reading, and playing with Groovy Girls. Naia’s current favorite television shows include The Hunger Games, Master Chef, and WWE. 🎓 Naia recently moved from Charlottesville to the DC/NOVA area. She is looking forward to taking on this new leadership role and getting further involved with Best Buddies programs. 📣 “By getting more people involved in Best Buddies, I would like to change Best Buddies for the better,\" she said. \"I want to change how people see adults and children with disabilities because we can do things that other people can do. I want people to see what we’re capable of even though we have disabilities and how we do things differently than other people as well.” 💚 Naia attended her first Ambassador training at Deloitte’s annual Impact Day. 🙌 Best Buddies Ambassadors gives people with and without IDD the opportunity to gain the public speaking skills, self-esteem, and confidence needed to successfully advocate for themselves, their peers, and Best Buddies in communities, workplaces, and government. The program aims to educate and empower generations of leaders, public speakers, and advocates for inclusion. ➡ Read more about Naia and the Best Buddies Ambassadors program here: https://lnkd.in/dbw5Hhcd #DisabilityAdvocacy #IDD #Leadership #DeloitteImpactDay\n\n🇺🇸 July 26th is the 34th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (#ADA), which affirms and protects the rights of people with disabilities to participate in public life and ensures that all people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. 🌟 Best Buddies in Virginia & DC is proud to support the #ADA and celebrate inclusion every day! 🔎 We've gathered a small list of resources to help you learn more about the impact and significance of this landmark legislation. 💜 How the ADA Changed the Build World: https://lnkd.in/dZXna5Wf 💛 The ADA Explained: https://lnkd.in/db6yaJSd 🧡 Judy Heumann: The Mother of ADA: https://lnkd.in/dTnu8S5f ❤️ A Disability History of the United States by Kim Nielsen: https://lnkd.in/dn6cWPNu 💙 Demystifying Disability by Emily Ladau: https://lnkd.in/gCGBhpC9 📜 Americans With Disabilities Act: https://www.ada.gov/ ❓Why do you support the ADA?
