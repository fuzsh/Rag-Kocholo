        "text": "About Us\n\nFounded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver with one original chapter at Georgetown University, Best Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Best Buddies is the worldâ€™s largest organization dedicated to ending the social, physical and economic isolation of the 200 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Our programs empower the special abilities of people with IDD by helping them form meaningful friendships with their peers, secure successful jobs, live independently, improve public speaking, self-advocacy and communication skills, and feel valued by society.\n\nEstablished in 2003, Best Buddies Rhode Island (BBRI) is one of 21 state affiliates of Best Buddies International with its headquarters in Cranston. Our mission is carried out through six programs: Best Buddies Elementary Schools, Middle Schools, High Schools, Colleges, Ambassadors and e-Buddies. Best Buddies RI currently has programs in 35 schools across the state.\n\nFor more information or to get involved, please visit our website: www.bestbuddies.org/rhodeisland"
