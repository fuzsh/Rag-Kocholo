More than 2,000 people are expected to participate in the Challenge – a charity ride to benefit Best Buddies International – on September 8.\n\n“I take great pride and pleasure in welcoming the Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle presented by Pepsi-Cola back to Hearst Ranch and I am honored to serve as the Honorary Co-Chair for this year’s festivities, said Steve Hearst. “The Hearst Corporation and I maintain an overwhelming sense of community as we welcome Best Buddies to the Ranch again this year. We greatly enjoy our partnership with Best Buddies International and we salute and celebrate all of their milestones and achievements. Best Buddies International’s global volunteer efforts exemplify humanity, unity and dignity, making a positive difference in communities around the world, embodying the true meaning of the word Friendship. I am pleased that year after year, the Ranch has proven to be the perfect venue for this spectacular event. Let’s make this the best and most successful year yet.”\n\n“It is truly an honor to serve as the 2018 Event Chair for the Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle,” said Carl Guardino. “I am incredibly passionate about Best Buddies’ mission of empowering people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, helping them form genuine friendships with their peers, secure successful jobs, and become advocates for themselves and others within the IDD community. I hope that my role will help bring an even greater awareness to the infinite abilities people with intellectual and developmental disabilities possess, in addition to the resources needed to further expand the organization’s presence throughout the state of California and beyond.”\n\nThe Challenge kicks-off with the Official Opening Ceremony of the Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle presented by Pepsi-Cola on Friday, September 7 at the Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, CA.

Open to all ages and athletic abilities, participants and supporters ride, run or walk side-by-side with celebrities, professional athletes and notable guests. The Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle presented by Pepsi-Cola will be capped off with a gourmet barbeque, awards ceremony and live musical concert by California’s Soulville Band.\n\nDuring the event, Best Buddies will honor E. & J.
