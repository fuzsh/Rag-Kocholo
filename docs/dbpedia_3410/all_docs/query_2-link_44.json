        "text": "Celebrating Stories of USCB Student Success\n\nIn Spring 2024, we find ourselves reflecting on the journey we’ve taken during Fall 2023 and the milestones we’ve achieved. With each passing year, our community at the University of South Carolina Beaufort grows stronger, driven by the relentless pursuit of knowledge and the unwavering commitment to excellence. Our students’ academic pursuits are not confined to lecture halls and textbooks; rather, they extend far beyond, into the realms of real-world challenges and meaningful solutions. With every project, every endeavor, they demonstrate a profound understanding of the power of knowledge and the responsibility that comes with it. Despite the obstacles encountered along the way, our students persist, fueled by a shared passion for making a difference. Join us in honoring the spirit of Fall 2023 and the remarkable individuals who embody its essence. Together, let us celebrate the brilliance, the resilience, and the boundless potential of our USCB community.\n\nAngela Simmons\n\nVice Chancellor for Student Development\n\nEric Skipper\n\nProvost & EVCAA\n\n———\n\nIn October 2023, Celeste Cruz-Reyes (Elementary Education) and Evan Calabrese (Secondary Education – English) were selected as the two student participants for USCB’s South Korean and Asian Literacy (SKALE) project. This project, funded by Fulbright- Hayes and the U.S Department of Education, is one of many steps that the university is taking towards preparing the local community for the current and continuing influx of Korean culture to our area, including the development of a Hyundai EV facility in Savannah and a Korean EV battery facility just a short distance away. The participants have been dedicating countless hours to learning Korean language and culture, and will be traveling to South Korea for 4 weeks starting in June to immerse themselves in Korean life. The goal of this project is for participants to create a lesson plan that can be used for current/future students that will educate their students. Congratulations to Celeste and Evan! Link\n\n———\n\nThank You to Our Student Workers\n\nThe University of South Carolina Beaufort Facilities Management Department is very lucky to have such outstanding student workers. Day in and day out they strive to make USCB a better place for students, faculty and staff. These kids are highly motivated, truly dedicated, romping stomping, name-taking and very intelligent. They work well as a team or on their own. With or without supervision. It is more than an honor to run a crew like this. Fins Up! To the Facilities Management student workers. Anna Crider, Caleb Freeman, Aiden Driscoll-Sadusky, Shishir Nath, John Leland and Michael Corrales.\n\n———\n\nUSCB Helping the Community\n\nIn December, USCB student organizations teamed up for a campus-wide toy drive! The competition amongst the organizations was vigorous as they tried to be the team with the most donations! All 400+ toys were donated to Bluffton Self Help for local children. Thank you to Student Life for sponsoring this. Link\n\nFrancie Gaskin (Public Health) raised $10,000 for Best Buddies, an international nonprofit that aids individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) with employment, leadership skills, inclusive living, and friendships. Francie is the President of USCB’s Best Buddies organization, and was named a 2023 Best Buddies Champion of the Year for her dedication to the growth of the USCB Best Buddies organization as well as her desire to aid those with IDD. Story Link\n\nAlternative Fall Break was an opportunity for our USCB community to use their free time during Fall Break to provide assistance to those in need. For Fall Break 2023, USCB students Emma Carrington, Kylie Doto, Shannon Richardson, Kataya Reese, and Catherine Parnell volunteered with Habitat for Humanity in Bluffton. Thank you all so much for using your time away from classes to support those in need in our local community! Link\n\n———\n\nInternational Students on Campus\n\nUSCB welcomed over 50 new and returning international students — representing 24 countries (in 6 continents): Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Ghana, Honduras, Iceland, India, Italy, Jamaica, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Our biggest groups are from India (12), Norway (6), and the United Kingdom (6). In 2017, USCB organized the “India Summit” with guests from universities in India, paving the way for our international students from that country to study at USCB. Story Link.\n\n———\n\nCommunications Internships\n\nSummer 2023, Alexis Herc (Communication Studies, Class of 2023), and Communication Studies senior Kaylea Winebrenner completed internships at ClearWave Fiber’s Savannah, GA headquarters. They gained hands-on work experience while supporting the telecommunications company’s mission to provide faster internet for customers. Story Link.\n\n———\n\nSCNRI’s First Funding Recipient\n\nBeaufort and Jasper Counties are currently at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to hiring nurses, creating critical gaps in our healthcare system. We are proud to see one of our BSN graduates, Krystal Maldonado, become SCNRI’s (South Carolina Nurse Retention Initiative) first funding recipient and discuss this challenge with WJCL. Story Link.\n\nView the full interview here.\n\n———\n\nHilton Head Hospital Auxiliary’s Gift of $21,000 for Scholarships\n\nExpanding Horizons\n\nMembers of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) toured The Boeing Company in Charleston! Alongside them was USCB alum and current Boeing Employee Levi Arencibia. These students were learning that the sky is truly the limit in regards to their professional pursuits. Link\n\nSTEM Career Fair in Columbia\n\nDr. Ron Erdei and Dr. David Fusi took members of student organization ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) to USC’s STEM Career Fair in Columbia. They spoke with potential employers and found that their skills are very much in demand! Story Link.\n\nHistory & Culture of the Low Country\n\nStudents from Dr. James Shinn’s “History & Culture of the Low Country” course visited Parris Island Marine Museum and toured Spanish and French settlement sites on the island to expand their knowledge from the classroom beyond campus grounds! Link\n\nThey also visited the Altamaha Town Heritage Preserve in Okatie, the site of one of the primary settlements of the Yamasee. This Native American nation played an important role in the Lowcountry’s history in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Archaeologist Hannah Hoover led a walking tour, shared some Yamasee artifacts and demonstrated how to do archaeological fieldwork.

State Fair about their national TV show “By The River.” Story Link.\n\nSCETV’s By The River Crew - National Season 3\n\nDanielle Cobb - Social Media Producer\n\nAaliyah Newman - Production Assistant\n\nMaria Saccani - Digital Producer\n\nAbigail Vining - Associate Producer\n\nTyler Yates - Assistant Editor\n\nCDC Museum and Emory Graduate School Visit"
