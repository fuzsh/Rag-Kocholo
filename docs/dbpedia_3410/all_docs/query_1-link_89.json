Best Buddies is an amazing organization which is dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nThis year, Best Buddies is doing a Virtual Walk on May 29, 2021 at 11:00am EST. You can tune into the Best Buddies Friendship Walk Facebook page or Instagram account for a celebration of inclusion. Make sure to share your Walk for Inclusion videos and images by using #MyWalkForInclusion.\n\nMTG has created a Team Page where you can either make a donation and/or register for the Virtual Walk. If you would like to Register, you can also get your friends and family involved to make donations or register as well. Best Buddies has some amazing fundraising incentives this year for individuals who reach certain milestones, so letâ€™s get this ball rolling to help a fantastic cause.\n\nThe link to our Team Page is: https://www.bestbuddiesfriendshipwalk.org/global/supporting/#TeamMTG\n\nThank you all so much in advance for helping MTG CARES and Best Buddies International!"
