        "text": "Park Street Companies became a partner and sponsor of the Best Buddies International, a global nonprofit dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that raises awareness and creates opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The organization offers mentoring, education and career development, and personal improvement for individuals with IDD to become more independent members of society.\n\nIn addition to providing a donation to the cause, Park Street has employed a member to its team through the integrated employment initiative, which matches a qualified Best Buddy with a company seeking enthusiastic and dedicated employees. By participating in community events such as the annual Best Buddies Friendship Walk, Park Street hopes to raise awareness and funds to support inclusion for individuals with IDD.\n\nFounded in 1989, Best Buddies has more than 2,400 chapters worldwide with participants in 50 countries and in each of the 50 states of the US, positively impacting the lives of more than 1.2 million people with and without disabilities around the world. Best Buddies partners with companies like Park Street to secure employment for people with IDD so they can gain valuable career knowledge and independently support themselves.\n\nTo get involved with the program or to donate, please contact the Park Street team at (305) 967-7440 or clientdevelopment@parkstreet.com or Amber Coffman at Best Buddies at 410.302.9077 or AmberCoffman@bestbuddies.org."
