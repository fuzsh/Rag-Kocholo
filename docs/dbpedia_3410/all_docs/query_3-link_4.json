        "text": "Providing support for an individual with a disability will look a lot like the support you provide for all of your employees. Best Buddies Jobs will assist with training initially and then natural supports within the workplace will be identified. Natural supports are employees or supervisors that are available to answer questions and model problem solving and new tasks. Just like when any new person starts, your employee will find a person that they feel comfortable asking for help.\n\nBy joining Best Buddies, you will become part of a growing movement of people with and without disabilities, dedicated to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to have a friend. Students with and without disabilities are invited to serve as chapter leaders who plan events and engaging opportunities for members. At least four group activities are held each year both in school and outside of school. Some examples are pizza parties, bowling outings, kickball games, and ice cream socials. Each chapter determines their own activities based on availability of the members. Most importantly, members will be “matched” in a one-to-one friendship with another student from their middle/high school or peer-aged participant in the community at the college level.\n\nAt the middle school and high school level, students who attend schools without a special education program on campus participate in order to gain the opportunity to interact with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and learn about inclusion, the disability rights movement, and acceptance. At the elementary level, the Promoters program introduces the ideals and goals of the Best Buddies mission to students with and without disabilities on the same school campus through group events and inclusive activities. The Promoters program engages a variety of students in elementary, middle, and high school and community members with IDD who interact with these chapters.\n\nChapter activities and events address four areas of focus: awareness, engagement, empowerment, and interaction. Awareness to educate chapter members, peers, and the community on the disability rights movement. Engagement to get peers in the school and members in the community involved in Best Buddies. Empowerment to provide people with the opportunity to be a leader and a voice for Best Buddies. This includes chapter members serving as advocates of Best Buddies and getting Ambassadors to attend and speak at promoter chapter events. And interaction to provide opportunities for interaction with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Planning events with these areas of focus in mind ensures each chapter makes the greatest impact possible in their school and community.\n\nThere are a few steps in order to be matched in the Citizens program.\n\nMembership Application – all participants (peer buddy, buddy, and sponsor) must complete a membership application at bestbuddies.org/join.\n\nBackground Check – all peer buddies and buddies must consent to a background check.\n\nPhone Screening – the program manager will conduct a phone screening to get to know the participant and determine if they are appropriate for involvement in the Citizens program.\n\nHome Interview – the program manager will go to the potential participant’s home to conduct an in person interview and provide an introductory training. *Sponsors should be present at the home interview for buddies.\n\nMatch Meeting – once the program manager has found a peer buddy and a buddy who will make a good match, they will host a match meeting to introduce the buddy pair to one another. If both parties feel comfortable with the match, this meeting marks the beginning of their friendship!\n\nThe Best Buddies Jobs staff sources and pre-screens candidates from a large talent pool that is referred by multiple organizations. Best Buddies Jobs’ highest priority is to identify candidates that are an excellent fit for your company’s needs and culture. The Best Buddies Jobs staff will determine if there’s an outstanding fit in the Best Buddies Jobs’ internal talent pool. If there is not an immediate fit, Best Buddies Staff will source for the specific position to find the right candidate. Best Buddies Jobs staff will work with businesses to determine the time sensitivity of the company’s needs in order to fill the staffing need within the required timeline."
