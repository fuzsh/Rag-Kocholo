        "text": "Nazareth's Best Buddies Named Outstanding Chapter at International Conference\n\nPublished August 01, 2017\n\nBest Buddies International has recognized Nazareth College as an Outstanding Chapter for New York State for 2016-17, a big success to finish out the Naz Best Buddies program’s inaugural year.\n\n“Best Buddies gratefully recognizes the incredible impact the Nazareth chapter has made to develop opportunities for inclusion and acceptance in the Rochester area community,” said Best Buddies Founder and Chairman Anthony Kennedy Shriver. “Best Buddies International thanks Nazareth's chapter for sharing the mission of friendship and leadership and for making the world a better place for friends with and without disabilities.\"\n\nThe award was presented recently at the Best Buddies International Leadership Conference at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind.\n\n\"Our chapter is beyond grateful for being recognized by Anthony K. Shriver, Best Buddies International, and Nazareth College for not only for winning the outstanding chapter award, but for our overall hard work and achievements in just our first year as a chapter at Nazareth,” said Naz Best Buddies Chapter President Nancy Bauter. “Our success would not have been possible without the inclusive environment our college campus had already created. We are lucky to have the opportunity to continue extending our mission of inclusion for not just Nazareth College, but the entire surrounding Rochester area.”\n\nA Golisano Foundation grant in 2016 helped to expand the Best Buddies friendship program in Western New York, including Best Buddies Rochester and the Nazareth Chapter. Best Buddies mission of friendship, inclusion, and leadership for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) compliments the Foundation’s ongoing efforts to help people with IDD reach their full potential and be provided with pathways to self-sufficiency and the best possible expression of their abilities and talents throughout their lifetimes.\n\nBest Buddies is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Founded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant, international organization that has grown from one original chapter to more than 1,400 college, high school and middle school campuses across the country and internationally. Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 United States. Best Buddies has accredited international programs on six continents with additional country programs under active development.\n\nFor More Information\n\nJulie Long | Chief PR Officer | 585-389-2456 or jlong2@naz.edu\n\nBest Buddies"
