If not, feel free to set me straight.\n\nBest buddies is a 501(c)3 nonprofit. So you can count the time as volunteering, assuming again, that you were giving your time to support another person (your buddy) in the community.\n\nBe sure to accurate track your hours, and describe your impact. You can even request a letter of recommendation from the advisor or family of your buddy.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."
