        "text": "On the morning of September 6, 2008, Pembroke Pines teenager Michael Sayih teamed up with his brothers Adam and Joey and father Jim Sayih, who will join hundreds of cyclists to take the starting line at Chteau Julien Wine Estate in Carmel, California, for the Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle. They have committed to ride for Best Buddies. They will ride for different reasons, some for the thrill, some to fulfill months of preparation, and others purely for the cause; to support Best Buddies International, a nonprofit that provides opportunities for one-to-one friendships and integrated employment to people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle Friendship Ride is a 100-mile cycling event that takes participants along a scenic route on the Pacific Coast Highway from Carmel to San Simeon. First Lady of California Maria Shriver will serve as Honorary Chairperson and will ride in the Challenge, which also includes 62 and 15 mile courses. And, for the first time this year, cyclists will share the road with walkers and runners, who will be participating in the Carl Lewis Challenge, a five kilometer run/three kilometer walk option, which will be led by the Olympic gold-medalist himself. These events will be followed by an exclusive celebration at the Hearst Ranch, featuring a barbeque and private concert by the Black Eyed Peas for all participants and special guests.\n\nFounded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant, international organization with more than 1,400 chapters in 40 countries. Best Buddies is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by providing opportunities for one-to-one friendships and integrated employment. Their six formal programs Best Buddies Middle Schools, High Schools, Colleges, Citizens, e-Buddies and Jobs positively impact more than 350,000 individuals annually.
