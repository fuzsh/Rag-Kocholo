        "text": "To support student journalism and the content you love, become a member of The Daily Orange today.\n\nBest Buddies, an international nonprofit organization with chapters established in 49 countries across the world, strives to provide inclusion and opportunities to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Our mission is defined through four pillars: one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development and inclusive living.\n\nEunice Kennedy Shriver, an American philanthropist and founder of Special Olympics, published an article in 1962 regarding the misunderstandings surrounding people with IDDs. Her advocacy for disabled populations eventually led to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act’s passage, a bill ensuring all public schools provide equal access to education for individuals with IDDs. From this, Best Buddies officially became the first national, social and recreational organization for people with IDDs in 1989. These developments throughout history have brought inclusion to where it is today, but the fight is far from over.\n\nAt Syracuse University, lots of students with IDDs are achieving incredible things as well, from marathon runners to TV anchors. By practicing inclusion and looking to engage with Best Buddies, SU students can help give everyone the opportunity to have unique experiences that better the community as a whole.\n\nOther organizations on campus work with Best Buddies to provide students with IDDs an inclusive college experience that prepares them for the workforce. InclusiveU works closely with Best Buddies throughout the year to create fun and unique events. Best Buddies also partnered with Orange After Dark on Sept. 14 for a night of ice cream and board games.\n\nBy collaborating with Best Buddies, these organizations are taking steps to increase their inclusivity. One of the goals of Best Buddies is to make every club on campus a safe and welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds and all abilities. But there are still more ways to be involved.\n\nOn Oct. 14, SU’s Best Buddies Chapter will host a Friendship Walk as an opportunity for the campus to come together and pledge to support inclusion. The walk will be one mile around campus and feature music, performances, speakers with disabilities and lots of other fun activities for students to participate in.\n\nThe Friendship Walk is the foremost walk supporting people with IDDs, with more than 150,000 people choosing to walk since 2009. Best Buddies at SU seeks to raise $5,000 which will go towards Best Buddies International and local organizations in the Syracuse area that provide similar support and advocacy for individuals with IDDs. Gigi’s Playhouse, an international nonprofit seeking to provide family support, interactive learning and activities for individuals with Down syndrome, is just one of the local organizations Best Buddies hopes to support.\n\nBest Buddies will also partner with First Year Players, APO, SONY and other potential organizations for both the Friendship Walk and future events. If you can’t attend with an organization, you can sign up to walk anyway.\n\nIf you are interested in joining Syracuse University’s Best Buddies chapter and our Friendship Walk on Oct. 14, please visit this page or email us at [email protected].\n\nHannah Murphy, Buddy Program Director.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article mistated Katarina Sako’s name in the caption.
