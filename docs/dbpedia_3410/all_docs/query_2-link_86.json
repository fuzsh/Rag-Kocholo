        "text": "Homestead High School is proud to announce that seniors Nathan Moldavsky and Anastasia Raykova, both members of the National Honor Society (NHS), have been selected as NHS Scholarship semifinalists. National Honor Society membership is one of the highest honors that a high school student can achieve. To be eligible for consideration for National Honor Society membership, candidates must have an unweighted cumulative grade point average of 3.7, be of junior or senior class standing, and have attended Homestead for the equivalent of at least one semester. Recipients are chosen based on their demonstrated work to support the four pillars of NHS: scholarship, service, leadership, and character.\n\n“At Homestead, both Raykova and Moldavsky epitomize a commitment to the four pillars, both in and out of the classroom,” said Mrs. Tracy Grace, Homestead High School science department chair and NHS Advisor. “Their individual drive and determination have consistently resulted in the highest levels of academic success, and their commitment to their respective service activities is on constant display. I have come to know Anastasia and Nathan as strong and determined individuals who are willing to put forth significant effort in any environment to better themselves and others, and the world in which we live. These two close friends have tremendous potential, and I am counting on them to eventually become future visionary leaders in their chosen fields.”\n\nSince 1946, more than $21 million in scholarships have been awarded to outstanding NHS senior members to support college access and student success. The scholarship program is supported by the parent organization of NHS, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). The NHS Scholarship recognizes the most exceptional of student leaders.\n\nRaykova is involved in several clubs, activities, and leadership positions at Homestead High School and is active in both girls’ tennis and track and field. This school year she served as the Captain of the Varsity Tennis Team, the Vice President of the Homestead Student Council, Secretary of the National Honor Society, President and founder of the Neuroscience Club, a board member of Girls Exploring Math and Science (GEMS), and Co-Assistant Concertmaster Violinist in the Homestead Chamber Orchestra. Outside of school, she teaches violin lessons, serves as the President of the Mequon chapter of the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, and volunteer weekly at Ascension Medical Center in the Day Surgery and Pharmacy units. Upon graduation, she plans to double major in Public Health and Chemistry in order to pursue a career within the healthcare field.\n\n“I am honored to have been selected as a National Honor Society Semifinalist,” said Raykova. “The NHS scholarship will help me in pursuit of my education to make a lasting impact on our community. I am excited to pursue my educational journey and career.\"\n\nMoldavsky serves as the Co-President of the HHS Best Buddies Chapter, Co-President of the HHS Rotary Interact Club, President of the HHS Chinese Club, and Principal Violist for the HHS Chamber Orchestra. Outside of school, he works as an intern at Healing Harmonies Music & Art Therapy, serves as the Co-Chair of the Best Buddies Wisconsin Student Advisory Board, and represents Wisconsin on the Best Buddies International Young Leaders Council. Moldavsky is also the Founder and CEO of the non-profit organization Piano for Change, which supports people with disabilities through music. He plans to double major in Psychology and Neuroscience in hopes of becoming a neuropsychologist for individuals with disabilities.\n\n\"I'm super excited about becoming a National Semifinalist for the NHS Scholarship,” said Moldavsky. “This program will alleviate some of the financial burden of college and help me explore a wide variety of academic opportunities and community service projects.\""
