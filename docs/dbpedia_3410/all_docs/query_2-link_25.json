RI Kickball is a non-profit 501(c)7 sports league that has been a positive point of social and athletic connection for locals residing on Aquidneck Island.\n\n“Over the past 11 years and 20 seasons of RI Kickball, I have had the privilege of making many lifelong friendships and partnerships with local businesses because of RI Kickball,” said Turowski. “I am forever grateful that I took the plunge and started this league with the help of my husband Carson and my friend Valerie Mey-Altenburger all those years ago.”\n\nThe brainchild of Carson and Lindsey Turowski, kickball is being played on Monday nights in Morton Park and Toppa Field throughout the spring and fall. The idea came to the couple in 2011 after seeing how popular the game has become in Washington, D.C., which has thousands of players participating in leagues across the city.\n\nEver since founding RI Kickball in 2011, the league has been at max capacity with 12 teams and approximately 220 players per season. Over the years, RI Kickball has had 36 different teams play from a variety of backgrounds — including the Newport Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Naval War College, the IYRS School of Technology & Trade, Marine professionals and more.\n\n“In the past, league leaders have thanked me with a small gift or just a mention of thanks to the whole at the season awards party,” said Turowski. “This time they had been working behind the scenes to have the key to the City of Newport awarded to me …. To think that they planned this for me and went to the city is really meaningful.”\n\nKickball is a great sport for a variety of people to play, according to Turowski. Anyone with some athletic ability can play and participate in it, and it’s also a sport that allows for multiple genders to be good players.\n\n“These folks are now my friends for life thanks to kickball,” Turowski said. “When you are awarded something like this, you remember it forever.”\n\nFor more information on the league, go to RI Kickball’s website.\n\nAshley Koffink ’22, a psychology major from Holbrook, Massachusetts, will be pursuing a master’s degree in social work at Boston College. She will be specializing in clinical social work with children, youth and families. She then will be ready to become a License Independent Clinical Social Worker (LICSW).\n\nAfter Koffink begins pursuing her professional career, her longterm goal is to open her own private practice working with children and adolescents with mental illness and PTSD.\n\n“Many faculty members at Salve had a tremendous impact on me personally and academically,” said Koffink.\n\nKoffink specifically pointed out Laura Kcira-Barry, disabilities services coordinator, and Dr. Paula Martasian, associate professor in the Department of Psychology. Koffink explains that these faculty members pushed her to believe in herself when she was having doubts about personal or academic endeavors.\n\n“I credit them for getting me where I am today heading for Boston College,” she said. “Their words and encouragement will help me continue to be a success in both my academics and my future career as a social worker.”\n\nOne of the most important things that Koffink learned during her studies at Salve Regina is the diversity that exists in the world and how necessary it is to analyze the bigger picture of a person and situation. She believes this knowledge of diversity will directly impact her future career as a social worker.\n\n“We are not all the same, and we come from different cultures, religions and backgrounds,” she explained. “Taking the time to get to know a person, where they live, what their family is like, etcetera, can help you be a support system.”\n\nAfter her experience as an undergrad at Salve, Koffink urged incoming students not to worry so much about declaring their major. She explains that she started off as a biology major, but she quickly became intrigued by her psychology classes. Even though some of the classes she took were intimidating, the professors she worked with made her experience enjoyable.\n\n“My experience at Salve Regina has been life-changing,” she concluded. “I have grown as a person academically and spiritually. I walked into this beautiful campus with hopes of finding new friends, experiences and knowledge, and I am leaving with so much more.”\n\nArticle written by student writer Taylor Majkowicz ’22\n\nSalve Spotlights is a series of people-centered stories periodically featured on SALVEtoday. Check out the tag Salve Spotlights for more stories.\n\nAnne McDermott, director of financial aid at Salve Regina, has recently been appointed as the president of the Eastern Association of Financial Aid Administrators (EASFAA).\n\nMcDermott has been an EASFAA member ever since she began her financial aid career in 2007, and she has held a leadership position since 2017. Her first volunteer leadership position was as the president of the Rhode Island Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, and she worked within EASFAA in this role from 2017-2020.\n\nIn 2019, she was awarded the State Representative of the Year award. In 2020, McDermott served as one of the EASFAA conference co-chairs, and her committee was awarded Committee of the Year by offering a robust virtual conference during the pandemic.\n\n“What I noticed most during those difficult times was the bond that people had to our association and to one another,” said McDermott. “Absolutely nobody was leaving a colleague out to dry. Every difficult decision that was needed during that season felt just a little lighter because we were part of a team.”\n\nIn early 2021, McDermott was elected as president elect of EASFAA for 2022, and she started her official presidential year at the EASFAA conference in Baltimore, Maryland, in May of 2022.\n\n“The benefits of my EASFAA volunteerism have been far greater than I could have ever imagined,” said McDermott. “Having a network of people who understand the industry and are there to support one another has been a gift. Because of the EASFAA network, financial aid administrators are never alone. I have found not only that EASFAA has helped me grow professionally, but I have also made some lifelong friendships.”\n\nEASFAA aspires to be a leader in the development of empowered financial aid professionals. It promotes and supports the advancement of its members in higher education utilizing training, advocacy, education and leadership development opportunities.\n\nEASFAA fills the unique role of providing professional services to both its individual members and state associations, and it also acts as an advocate for regional policy positions with the United States Congress and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA).\n\n“Having worked for many years at a Catholic Sisters of Mercy institution with a strong connection to mission, I often find myself thinking about the importance of mission statements and how mission statements can be put into practice,” said McDermott. “One of the biggest priorities of the association will be to bring new people in, help them to improve their skills and provide the support they need … to keep them in our industry as better, stronger, more confident aid professionals.”\n\nMany of Salve Regina’s sports teams are hosting a variety of clinics and camps this summer in June, July and August.
