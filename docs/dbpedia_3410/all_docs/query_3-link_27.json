        "text": "LA NHRA was created to give back to the Senior HR community and our roots have grown long and deep as our community has grown.\n\nWe realized we needed to do more, that it was time to branch out and serve our community in different ways. To that point, we launched our DEI Council which is thriving and offering crucial resources in the DEI space to our community.\n\nBut we also feel the need to give back philanthropically, and are excited to have Best Buddies as our official partner. So how can you help as an LA NHRA member.\n\nBelow you can find information on Best Buddies, their mission, and our goals for the LA NHRA community:\n\nBest Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nThe Best Buddies Jobs program represents one of our organization’s four key mission pillars, Integrated Employment. This program secures jobs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), allowing them to earn an income, pay taxes, and continuously and independently support themselves.\n\nThe Jobs program places focus beyond the typical jobs in which a person with IDD might be placed. Best Buddies focuses on finding work that matches the job seeker’s interests and talents.\n\nPlease help NHRA LA and Best Buddies by partnering with Best Buddies, and contact AmberCoffman@bestbuddies.org should you have interest, or any questions.\n\nSecures jobs for people with IDD, allowing them to earn an income, pay taxes, and continuously and independently support themselves.\n\nBESTBUDDIES® Jobs Matches skilled, qualified individuals with IDD with businesses seeking enthusiastic and dedicated employees. Through the Jobs program, Best Buddies develops partnerships with employers, assists with the hiring process and provides ongoing support to the employee and employer. An estimated 81% of adults (18+) with developmental disabilities do not have a paid job in the community. The Best Buddies Jobs program strives to place participants with IDD in supported employment, with the potential to receive benefits and earn a total income upwards of $900K over 30 years. In turn, these individuals will contribute $153K in taxes back into the economy, rather than receive nearly $895K in Federal SSI and Medicaid benefits during that time period.\n\nEmployees want benefits, and businesses need to save while delivering value to hard-working teams. What if you had experts in health insurance, wellness programs and other benefits at your fingertips?\n\nIMA offers a comprehensive suite of value-added services. We work closely with Human Resources Professionals to analyze current plans and identify coverage needs, then leverage relationships with underwriters to design terms and coverage for disability, vision, dental and health insurance.\n\nIMA’s clientele represents annual premiums of more than $500 million, and we serve many sectors, with education, nonprofits and social services being best represented.\n\nIn every relationship, we rely on these fundamentals:\n\n✔ People-first: Our style is consultative, and clients think of us as an extension of their team\n\n✔ Beyond Insurance: We offer expertise in loss-control, ergonomics and more\n\n✔ National and Global Resources: IMA is licensed in all 50 states\n\n✔ A Culture of Engagement: A happy staff translates to happy clients\n\nOur internal approach to your business is collaborative and allows us to be proactive, to stay on track and anticipate the needs of your growing business. IMA is unique in its approach to fielding client inquiries before and after plan implementation.\n\nWe’re honored that the Insurance and Brokers of the West (IABA) named IMA a top five broker and Agency of the Year.\n\nIf I can help you review coverage and create a custom employee benefits plan, reach out to me.\n\nNicole Ramirez\n\nAssociate Broker, Employee Benefits\n\n(626) 507-1029 direct\n\n(626) 922-7465 mobile\n\nSpecialties:\n\n✔Employee benefits and HR support\n\n✔Compliance services\n\n✔Property and casualty insurance\n\n✔Personal risk management\n\n✔Alternative funding solutions\n\n✔Talent acquisition services\n\n✔Wellness programs\n\n✔Industry specialists\n\n✔Risk management and loss control"
