        "text": "ESFM’s Technical Services & Energy Solutions team achieves ENERGY STAR Industrial Service and Product Provider (iSPP) status, a first of its kind distinction for a facilities management provider.\n\nAs a client partner supporting sustainability targets, including energy conservation measures and improving building performance, ESFM has been recognized by ENERGY STAR as an official Industrial Service and Product Provider (iSPP).\n\nThe designation recognizes the significant energy and cost savings ESFM has identified for clients through Energy Treasure Hunts as part of its self-performed energy management solutions.\n\nAs an official, trusted ENERGY STAR iSPP partner, ESFM has proven its commitment to:\n\nPromote a comprehensive and strategic energy management approach.\n\nDemonstrate the financial value of energy performance improvements.\n\nAssist clients with measuring, managing, and improving commercial building performance with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.\n\nESFM can also guide clients through the ENERGY STAR certification process for their buildings without consulting a third party.\n\n“We know our clients have a sharp focus on how their buildings contribute to their business performance,” ESFM Vice President of Technical Services & Energy Solutions John Ramsden said. “This partnership is a testament to the way our self-performed energy management solutions add value to clients by decreasing facilities-related costs, increasing building system efficiency, and reducing the carbon footprint of the built environment.”\n\nESFM has successfully identified significant utility savings through Energy Treasure Hunts since launching the program in 2023. As an example, ESFM identified approximately $550,000 in annual energy savings — an emissions equivalent of 2,860 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) across two client sites totaling nearly 800,000 square feet. Read the Partner Teaming Profile on the ENERGY STAR website to learn how ESFM helped a medical device manufacturing client uncover $385,000 per year in potential savings.\n\nEnergy Treasure Hunts are three-day events facilitated by ESFM subject matter experts and involving a team of client employees from various departments. Participants are trained to identify where energy is being wasted around a building, quantify observations in cost and emissions saved and present a summary of energy conservation measures (ECMs) to client stakeholders.\n\nThe exercise creates energy ambassadors among client employee teams who have a vested interest in supporting their employer’s energy-saving targets.\n\nWhile renewable energy and other major capital investments dominate sustainability headlines, Energy Treasure Hunts prove there’s a lot of opportunity for savings through energy efficiency and behavior change of occupants\n\n“It’s very rewarding to host Energy Treasure Hunts and watch how people light up as they realize the significant impact they can make through simple solutions, like identifying air leaks or helping those around them be more mindful of habits that waste energy,” ESFM Senior Director of Sustainability & Energy Solutions Gary Williams said. “I’m proud of the work we are doing through these events to make a lasting difference for a cleaner, more sustainable future.”"
