In this time of heightened social and emotional development that can be difficult even for teenagers without IDD, the Best Buddies friendship program helps break through social barriers at an important time in a young person’s life.\n\nThe Best Buddies Jobs program represents one of our organization’s four key mission pillars, Integrated Employment. This program secures jobs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), allowing them to earn an income, pay taxes, and continuously and independently support themselves.\n\nBest Buddies Leadership Development programs represents one of our organization’s four key mission pillars. The programs educate and empower people with and without IDD to become leaders, public speakers and advocates. Best Buddies passionately believes that its program participants can lead the effort within their community and beyond to build a more inclusive world for people with IDD."
