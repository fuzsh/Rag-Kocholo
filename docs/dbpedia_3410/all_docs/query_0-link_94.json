        "text": "BEST BUDDIES IN PALM BEACH ANNOUNCE ITS 2023 CHAMPION OF THE YEAR GALA IN SUPPORT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES\n\nThe organization is excited to announce its Co-Chairs, Lynsey Kane and Jena Sims Koepka, both long-time advocates for inclusion with Best Buddies International, and also it recognizes its inspiring Champions\n\nBest Buddies International, a nonprofit founded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver to establish a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), is excited to kick-off its Champion of the Year fundraising drive to support its 2023 Champion of the Year Gala, hosted by Best Buddies in Palm Beach County, FL.\n\nThis year’s Gala also features a star-studded array of Champions, a group of leaders who are currently raising funds with their Mission Partners “Best Buddies” to support their local Best Buddies programs. The impact of these programs currently covers 47 chapters and 1,250 participants in five counties (Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Okeechobee and Indian River), however more schools are needed. This year’s Champions include Christine Chase Simmonds, Adriana Fini, Bree Gordon Lukosavich, Warren Kirschbaum, Mike Kneuer, Mackenzie Norton, Julianna Priddy, Melissa Taylor and Karina Yanez.\n\nThe 2023 Champion of the Year Gala, which celebrates the Champions and their Mission Partners, will take place at the unique Cox Science Center & Aquarium in West Palm Beach, on Friday, November 3rd. from 7:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. The popular gala will feature both Silent and Live Auctions with several one-of-a-kind items up for auction, including amazing gifts of travel, sports, art, spas, golf and much more, dinner, cocktails, dancing, a keynote address from a Best Buddies Ambassador, a pageant performance by girls from Pageant of Hope and a special awards ceremony.\n\nTricia Williams, Area Director for Palm Beach stated, “We are thrilled to have two Chairs, Lynsey Kane and Jena Sims Koepka, who are both such devoted supporters of the Best Buddies Mission of inclusion.” Lynsey calls Best Buddies her favorite organization that promotes friendship, love, acceptance, independence and inclusion. And Jena, the 2022 Honorary Chair, continues to support Best Buddies since 2007, after being crowned Miss Georgia Teen USA. She is all about empowerment. Jena is the founder and President of HBBQ’s, Inc., the 501c3 organization that puts on the Pageant of Hope. She started this inspirational event after winning her first pageant in 2005, seeing the confidence it gave her- she had to pass this same winning feeling along to kids and teens that need it most. And this year once again, the Best Buddies Gala will include a pageant performance by the girls from Pageant of Hope.\n\nNot only will this be a fantastic evening, you will also be a part of Best Buddies’ goal to expand more opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with IDD in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast of FL. And, this year’s Emcee of the event is another long-time supporter of Best Buddies, CBS 12 News Anchor Matt Lincoln.\n\nThis event is expected to sell out.
