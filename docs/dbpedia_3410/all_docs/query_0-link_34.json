        "text": "Team SVB to Participate in the Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle for the Eighth Consecutive Year\n\nPalo Alto, CA – April 8, 2011 – Best Buddies International, a groundbreaking nonprofit founded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, is pleased to announce that it will award Ken Wilcox, the CEO of SVB Financial Group and Silicon Valley Bank, with the \"Spirit of Leadership\" award.\n\nThe \"Spirit of Leadership\" award is Best Buddies' highest accolade, and is presented to individuals who have shown great leadership, generosity and spirit in supporting the Best Buddies mission. Past honorees have included Muhammad Ali, David Caruso, Senator Tom Harkin, David Maxwell, Sally Pederson and Sargent Shriver.\n\n\"Best Buddies applauds Ken's dedication to our mission of friendship, employment and leadership training for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities,\" said Anthony Kennedy Shriver, Founder and Chairman of Best Buddies International. \"We are proud to honor him with our \"Spirit of Leadership\" award and sincerely hope that his efforts inspire other individuals and companies in Silicon Valley to follow in his footsteps.\"\n\nUnder Wilcox's direction, SVB has directly engaged in the Best Buddies mission by employing two people with intellectual disabilities. Additionally, Team SVB has committed 407 volunteer participants to the Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle since 2004, raising over $723,190 in total donations in support of the organization. No other individual or company has done more for Best Buddies in Silicon Valley.\n\nWilcox joined SVB in 1990 when he co-founded Silicon Valley Bank's East Coast Technology Division. Upon his promotion to Chief Banking Officer in 1997, Wilcox moved from Massachusetts to California. In 2000, he became president and CEO, and successfully pursued a strategy of expansion and diversification, while remaining focused on the company's core niches of technology, life sciences, venture capital and premium wineries.\n\nOn April 21, Wilcox is stepping down as CEO to become the Chairman of Silicon Valley Bank and focus exclusively on the company's operations and expansion in China. Wilcox is a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Asia Society, Equilibrium Capital Group, Bessemer Venture Partners and the Young Adult and Family Center at UCSF. He is also an executive committee and board member of the Bay Area Council and a contributing speaker at the Stanford University Entrepreneurship Corner. In 2008, Wilcox was named Banker of the Year by American Banker, earned the distinction of \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" in Northern California by Ernst & Young in 2009, and in 2010, the Yangpu District of Shanghai honored Wilcox with an \"Innovation Contributor\" award.\n\nBest Buddies is also pleased to welcome back Team SVB to the Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle, which will take place on September 10. The Challenge is a charity walk, run and ride from Carmel to San Simeon, CA, benefitting Best Buddies International. Maria Shriver will serve as Honorary Chairperson of the event, which features 100, 62, 35 and 15-mile cycling routes, a 5K run and 3K walk, celebrity tandem races, and a barbeque and private concert at Hearst Ranch. Wilcox will be presented with the \"Spirit of Friendship\" award during the Challenge.\n\nThis year, Team SVB comprises SVB employees and their families, clients and business associates, and hopes to recruit 75 participants and raise $175,000. In order to kick-off these efforts, Wilcox, Team SVB and Anthony Kennedy Shriver, will host a breakfast and practice ride on Friday, April 8.
