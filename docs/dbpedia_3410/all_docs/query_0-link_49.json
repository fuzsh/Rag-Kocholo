These friends connect on the phone, do things together in the community, and get together for group activities such as dances, movies and local races.\n\nFounded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant, international organization that has grown from one original chapter to almost 1,500 middle school, high school, and college chapters worldwide. Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 United States, and in 50 countries around the world."
