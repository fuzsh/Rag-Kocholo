Section 1010.25,Florida Statutes (F.S.), requires the Inspector General of the Department of Education (DOE) to annually inspect or audit at least 5 percent of the total number of gifts from a foreign source disclosed by or gift agreements received from institutions of higher education during the previous year. The purpose of this audit was to determine the level of compliance with the statutory reporting requirements with respect to the sampled foreign gifts and gift agreements. In general, we determined the IHEs submitted their foreign gift reports timely, but we identified instances where some IHEs did not report certain gifts in full compliance with the statutory reporting requirements as noted in the audit results section of this report.\n\nAudit Results:\n\nWe reviewed 10 of 162 (6%) foreign gifts and foreign gift agreements totaling $50,000 or more to determine if the gift disclosures complied with section 1010.25(3) F.S. Specifically, section 1010.25(3)(a-c) requires the IHEs to provide the amount of the gift and the date it was received, the contract start and end date if the gift is a contract, and the name of the foreign source and, if not a foreign government, the country of citizenship, if known, and the country of principal residence or domicile of the foreign source. Our review of the ten sampled foreign gift disclosures determined that all ten gifts reviewed complied with the reporting requirements.\n\nOur initial review determined seven of the eight IHEs included in our sample submitted copies of the gift agreements at the time they reported the foreign gifts. However, only one of the eight gift agreements submitted by those seven IHEs contained all of the statutorily required information. The other seven gift agreements were missing signatures by either the foreign source or the respective college designee (5), contained an incomplete copy of the gift agreement (1), or failed to identify the beneficiaries of the gift (2). The Florida Institute of Technology submitted the one fully compliant gift agreement at the initial submission. The University of Miami reported two of the ten foreign gifts included in our sample but did not initially submit a copy of the gift agreement.\n\nUpon reviewing the additional documents from the IHE’s to support the nine sample gift submissions that partially met the statutory requirements at the time of the initial submission, five of the nine gifts became fully compliant with the statutory requirements. Four of the ten gifts remained partially compliant due to missing signatures by the college administrator or respective designee or by the foreign source.\n\nGifts from Beacon College and Valencia College were partially compliant for not providing a signature from the chief administrative officer or their respective designee due to college practice and procedures.\n\nOne Florida Institute of Technology gift agreement remained partially compliant for not providing a signature from the chief administrative officer or their respective designee; however; FIT indicated that a change in process should ensure compliance going forward.\n\nThe University of Tampa remained partially compliant for providing sporadic signatures by the foreign source and no signatures by the chief administrative officer or their respective designee.\n\nEnterprise Audit of Cybersecurity Controls for Incident Response, Reporting, and Recovery\n\nReport Number: A-2324DOE-004\n\nIssue Date: 06/24/2024\n\nThe OIG completed an Enterprise Audit of Cybersecurity Controls for Incident Response, Reporting, and Recovery. This report has been classified as confidential in accordance with Section 282.318(4)(g), Florida Statutes and is therefore not available for public distribution. Copies of the report should be delivered only to individuals appropriate to the activity reviewed. All individuals wishing to view or obtain the results of this report must submit a written request to the Office of the Inspector General, including contact information and a detailed explanation of the reason for the request.\n\nFlorida Center for the Blind, Inc. (FCB) (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2223DOE-018\n\nIssue Date: 06/06/2024\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS), Transition Services (TS), and Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VR) Contract 21-533 between the Division of Blind Services (DBS) and the Florida Center for the Blind, Inc. (FCB). The purpose of this audit was to determine whether FCB met the requirements of the agreement with DBS, and whether DBS effectively monitored adherence to the agreement. During this audit we noted that FCB partially met their contractual requirements, and DBS effectively monitored adherence to the agreement. We noted two instances where improvements should be made to strengthen certain internal controls. We noted that FCB did not meet all required contract deliverables, and FCB did not maintain proper fiscal oversight.\n\nWe recommended DBS:\n\ninclude a review of service deliverables in their monitoring activities to ensure compliance with the contract terms and its service deliverables and make appropriate adjustments to performance funding when service deliverables are not met;\n\nreview the contract with FCB and consider making appropriate revisions to better align the contractual deliverables with the contractor’s business model;\n\ninclude a review of expenditures as part of their monitoring efforts; and\n\nmaintain records to support a cost analysis, including the agency’s documented review of individual cost elements from the submitted budget for allowability, reasonableness, and necessity.\n\nWe recommended FCB:\n\nenhance their controls to ensure all service deliverable requirements are met;\n\nreview the contract with DBS and consider making appropriate revisions to better align the contractual deliverables with the contractor’s business model;\n\nenhance its controls to ensure expenses funded through DBS’s contract are allowable, appropriately reflected by funding source in the general ledger, and correlate to invoices submitted to DBS for payment for services rendered;\n\nsubmit a budget to DBS in accordance with statutory requirements; and\n\nenhance its fiscal oversight to ensure compliance with internal policies and procedures, including Board of Director oversight of the President/CEO position.\n\nBureau of Family and Community Outreach – 21st Century Community Learning Center Grants – 6 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2324DOE-010\n\nIssue Date: 05/09/2024\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-2122DOE-019, Bureau of Family and Community Outreach (BFCO) – 21st Century Community Learning Center Grants.

(PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2223DOE-013\n\nIssue Date: 12/21/23\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the Adults with Disabilities grant #50F-90560-2Q001 between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and the Palm Beach Habilitation Center, Inc. (PBHC). The purpose of this audit was to determine if the PBHC has sufficient internal controls to provide services to adults with disabilities in compliance with grant terms and ensure DVR is effectively monitoring the grant. We noted the program provides services to adults with disabilities who are not seeking competitive employment. The needs and goals of the participants are individualized through the Adult Individual Education Plans (AIEP). The participant and the PBHC identify two benchmarks on the AIEP. Participants attain a set percentage of the required tasks or goals in order to complete the selected benchmarks. The benchmarks vary based on participant needs and ability. The teacher monitors each participant’s progress towards their goals and documents the benchmark percentage when complete. During this audit, we noted there were instances where improvements could be made to strengthen some controls. For example, we cited instances where DVR did not provide effective oversight of the grant; PBHC could not provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate they achieved the required performance funding benchmarks on their quarterly invoices, but DVR paid the invoices despite the lack of supporting documentation; PBHC could not provide documentation to support the employee salary expenditures they submitted on invoices to DVR; PBHC could not demonstrate that those employees actually worked with grant-funded participants nor how many hours those employees worked on grant related activities; neither DVR nor PBHC retained evidence of invoice submission dates to demonstrate that PBHC submitted invoices in accordance with grant terms and DVR inspected, approved, and paid those invoices in accordance with statutory requirements; and PBHC did not perform background screenings on all PBHC employees associated with the grant.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nconduct monitoring in accordance with the risk assessment and monitoring plan. Should DVR identify any deficiencies through its monitoring efforts, we recommend DVR promptly provide the monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to PBHC and ensure they complete corrective action on noted deficiencies;\n\ninclude a review of expenditures incurred and the supporting documentation as part of their monitoring efforts to ensure expenditures are supported, allowable, allocable, reasonable, and necessary to the performance of the grant and align with the approved budget;\n\nreconcile and verify all funds received against all funds expended in accordance with statutory requirements;\n\ninclude a review of the AIEPs in their monitoring activities to ensure consistency and compliance with the grant terms and its performance measures and make the appropriate adjustments to performance funding when benchmarks are not achieved;\n\ninspect, approve, and pay invoices in accordance with statutory requirements;\n\nensure that appropriate evidence is retained to demonstrate compliance; and\n\ninclude a review of service provider background screenings as part of their monitoring efforts to ensure they are being conducted in accordance with statutory requirements.\n\nWe recommended PBHC:\n\nensure all benchmarks recorded in participant AIEPs are completed in accordance with grant terms;\n\ndocument and report progress towards benchmark achievement as outlined in the grant. If benchmark goals change through the course of the grant year, we recommend PBHC amend the AIEP to correlate with the new goals and clearly report progress towards the amended goals in the quarterly invoices;\n\nenhance its procedures to ensure expenses funded through DVR’s grant are allowable and appropriately reflected by funding source in the general ledger and correlate to invoices submitted to DVR for payment for services rendered;\n\nretain employee timesheets and personnel activity reports, including a time worked allocation by funding source;\n\nsubmit invoices in accordance with grant terms;\n\nensure that appropriate evidence is retained to demonstrate compliance; and\n\nconduct all employee background screenings in accordance with statutory requirements.\n\nCoalition for Independent Living Options, Inc. – 12 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2324DOE-005\n\nIssue Date: 12/20/2023\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-2021DOE-026, Coalition for Independent Living Options, Inc. DVR and Coalition for Independent Living Options, Inc. management have both indicated corrective action has been initiated for each of their reported deficiencies.\n\n21st Century Community Learning Centers (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2122DOE-019\n\nIssue Date: 09/22/23\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC) grants within the Bureau of Family and Community Outreach (BFCO). The purpose of this audit was to determine if 21st CCLC subrecipients provided services in accordance with grant terms and applicable laws. During this audit we noted that BFCO and 21st CCLC are subject to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The U.S. Department of Education approved a set of five new GPRA measures for the 21st CCLC programs starting in the 2021-22 school year. The two 21st CCLC subrecipients selected for this review, Broward County School District and Orlando After School All Stars (OASAS), generally complied with the grant expenditure reporting requirements. However, we noted instances where improvements could be made to strengthen some of the monthly deliverable controls. For example, some OASAS deliverable submissions did not include all required reporting elements, and BFCO approved invoices for payment despite the missing deliverables. We also cited instances where the subrecipients did not submit all deliverables in a timely manner, and BFCO did not approve all deliverables in a timely manner.\n\nWe recommended Orlando After School All Stars (OASAS):\n\nsubmit all required deliverable reporting elements to BFCO in accordance with grant terms; and\n\nsubmit all required deliverables by the agreement due dates.\n\nWe recommended Broward County School District:\n\nsubmit all required deliverables by the agreement due dates.\n\nWe recommended Bureau of Family and Community Outreach (BFCO):\n\nwork with OASAS and the Orange County Public School District to ensure data necessary to comply with all deliverable reporting requirements is available to OASAS for future grant periods;\n\nreviews all submitted deliverables in accordance with the Monitoring and Compliance Unit Standard Operating Procedures and ensures all deliverables are satisfactorily completed prior to authorizing payment;\n\nensures that subrecipients submit all required deliverables timely and send reminders until they receive all required documentation;\n\ndefine the “participant data update” deliverable as behavioral referrals and in-school suspensions in the RFA and add the quarterly report card grades deliverable and the associated due dates in the RFA; and\n\nenhance its controls, including supervisory review of deliverable approval dates, to ensure staff reviews deliverables within the timeframe outlined by the grant terms.\n\nEnterprise Audit of Cybersecurity Continuous Monitoring – 12 Month Status\n\nReport Number: F-2223DOE-016\n\nIssue Date: 08/03/2023\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-2122DOE-002, Enterprise Audit of Cybersecurity Continuous Monitoring.

Section 1010.25, Florida Statutes (F.S.), requires the Inspector General of the Department of Education (DOE) to annually inspect or audit at least 5 percent of the total number of gifts from a foreign source disclosed by or gift agreements received from institutions of higher education during the previous year. The purpose of this audit was to determine the level of compliance with the statutory reporting requirements with respect to the sampled foreign gifts and gift agreements. In general, we determined the IHEs submitted their foreign gift reports timely, but we identified instances where the Florida Institute of Technology did not report certain gifts in full compliance with the statutory reporting requirements.\n\nAudit Results:\n\nWe reviewed fifty-five sampled foreign gift disclosures totaling $50,000.00 or more, from the 1,100 foreign gifts and foreign gift agreements reported for fiscal year 2021-22, and determined that all but four gifts reviewed complied with the reporting requirements. We noted four gifts disclosed by the Florida Institute of Technology had no gift received date on the disclosure form. Our review determined that three out of the seven IHEs that reported foreign gifts submitted complete copies of the gift agreements at the time they reported the foreign gifts. Those three IHEs reported six of the fifty-five foreign gifts included in our sample. Four of the seven IHEs failed to submit required copies of gift agreements at the time they reported the gifts. During the course of the review, the OIG contacted the IHEs with missing gift agreements and requested copies of the agreements, including the information required in statute. Each of the four IHEs were subsequently able to provide copies of the gift agreements and additional documentation. After reviewing all submitted supporting documentation for the selected samples items, we noted:\n\nForty-four of fifty-five gifts reviewed complied with the statutory requirements.\n\nEleven of fifty-five gifts partially complied with statutory requirements as follows:\n\nFour gifts reported by FIT had no date received on the disclosure form as mentioned above;\n\nFive gifts reported by FIT were confirmed payments for individual students for tuition payments, student card deposits, and flight tickets. Other than a receipt or invoice, there are no other types of documentation provided for these reported gifts; and\n\nTwo gifts reported by FIT were for student financial guarantees, but the agreements contained no signatures or a detailed description of the purpose of the gift.\n\nThe Florida Endowment Foundation for Vocational Rehabilitation, Inc., dba The Able Trust (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2223DOE-001\n\nIssue Date: 02/15/23\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the Memorandums of Understanding, SA-519 and IA-865, between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and the Florida Endowment Foundation for Vocational Rehabilitation, dba The Able Trust. The purpose of this audit was to determine compliance with the MOUs; Section 413.615, Florida Statutes; and any other policies or procedures established by the Division. During this audit we noted that The Able Trust generally operated within statutory compliance and adhered to the MOUs with the Division. However, we noted that The Able Trust Board of Directors has not conducted annual formalized evaluations of its funded programs as required by statute, although it has conducted extensive monitoring for its High School High Tech program.\n\nWe recommended The Able Trust:\n\nBoard of Directors conduct an annual evaluation of funded programs pursuant to Section 413.615(9)(g), Florida Statutes.\n\nInternal Control and Data Security Audit\n\nReport Number: O-2223DOE-003\n\nIssue Date: 2/15/23\n\nThe OIG conducted an Internal Control and Data Security Audit that involved reviewing the data exchange memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the department’s School Transportation Management Section and the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV).

(CILO). The purpose of this audit was to determine if CILO’s internal controls ensure effective delivery of program services to individuals with disabilities and determine if DVR effectively manages and monitors the contract for compliance. During this audit, we noted that DVR did not provide effective monitoring, CILO did not maintain proper internal controls and sufficient financial management systems, CILO could not sufficiently demonstrate that they met all contract deliverables, and invoice submission and approval did not meet statutory and contractual requirements.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nConduct monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan and risk assessment;\n\nPromptly provide any monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to CILO and ensure corrective action has been completed on noted deficiencies;\n\nInclude a review of expenditures incurred and the supporting documentation as part of their monitoring efforts to ensure expenditures are supported, allowable, allocable, reasonable, and necessary to the performance of the contract and align with the approved budget;\n\nSample and review CSRs during its monitoring activities;\n\nPeriodically request and review supporting documentation from CILO’s financial management and CSR systems for the service hours and funding sources submitted by CILO through the invoices; and\n\nStreamline its invoice gathering, inspection, and approval procedures to ensure timely approval of invoices.\n\nWe recommended CILO:\n\nNotate the funding allocations on the individual invoices or expense categories to support expenditures incurred;\n\nEnhance its procedures to ensure expenses funded through DVR’s contract are allowable and appropriately reflected by funding source;\n\nObtain prior approval from DVR before deviating from the approved budget;\n\nEnhance its financial systems and records to ensure deliverables provided are in accordance with contract terms;\n\nEnhance its procedures to ensure they maintain all required documents in the CSRs including ILPs, eligibility determinations, and termination of services;\n\nEstablish and maintain ILPs with consumers that are consistent with contract terms and federal regulations;\n\nEnhance its procedures to record service hours in accordance with contract terms; and\n\nSubmit invoices in accordance with contract terms.\n\nApplication Development and Support (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2021DOE-028\n\nIssue Date: 08/29/22\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an Application Development and Support Audit. The purpose of this engagement was to determine the effectiveness of Division of Technology & Innovation (DTI) internal controls for change management processes and procedures, from the initial request to project completion. During this audit, we noted that DTI generally provided services in accordance with the established change management processes and procedures in place. We recommended DTI strengthen internal controls for emergency change management procedures and communication of testing requirements with customers. The Audit Results section below provides additional details noted during our audit.\n\nAudit Results:\n\nWe determined that DTI generally adheres to the change management policies, procedures, and Information and Technology Governance Frameworks and maintains proper documentation of the change requests and testing efforts in accordance with policies and procedures. DTI provided 22 completed change management requests for applications within our scope. We sampled 6 change requests and reviewed the corresponding Application Development Request forms, test case documents, User Acceptance Testing documentation, and technical manuals. We determined that DTI properly conducted and documented impact assessments, authorizations, tracking, testing, and customer communication for each of these change requests. As stated above, we recommended DTI strengthen internal controls for emergency change management procedures and communication of testing requirements with customers.\n\nJobs for Florida’s Graduates – 12 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2122DOE-020\n\nIssue Date: 08/17/2022\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-2021DOE-019, Jobs for Florida’s Graduates.

The purpose of this audit was to determine whether USF is meeting the requirements of the agreement with BESE, and whether BESE is effectively monitoring adherence to the agreement. During this audit, we noted that USF-St. Petersburg generally provided services in accordance with Cooperative Agreement Number 291-2621B-1C005 and had sufficient internal controls in place. We also noted that BESE provided effective oversight of the agreement.\n\nAudit Results:\n\nWe determined that BESE provided effective monitoring of the agreement, USF-St. Petersburg achieved performance targets and deliverables, and payments and expenditures were made in accordance with agreement terms. Furthermore, we surveyed all nineteen local SEDNET projects, with thirteen of the nineteen responding to our survey. Results of our survey suggest that twelve of the thirteen respondents indicated their overall relationship with the contractor was either excellent or good. We also noted that a small number of local SEDNET projects identified an issue relating to the vetting of training and presentation materials at the State level. This resulted in delays for delivering this service. One respondent indicated schools had little time to pivot in their planning for meeting these deliverables given changes in State law.\n\nDivision of Blind Services (DBS) Independent Living Older Blind Program – 18 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2122DOE-021\n\nIssue Date: 07/11/2022\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-1920-032, Independent Living Older Blind Program – Division of Blind Services.

(PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2021DOE-029\n\nIssue Date: 04/21/22\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the agreement between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and Best Buddies International, Inc. The purpose of this audit was to determine if Best Buddies’ internal controls ensure effective delivery of employment services to DVR customers; ensure benchmark payments are made in accordance with the Provider Manual; and determine if DVR effectively manages and monitors Best Buddies’ compliance with the Provider Manual. During this audit we noted that, in general, Best Buddies is meeting the requirements of the Provider Manual, and DVR is effectively monitoring adherence to the Provider Manual. However, we noted instances where DVR and Best Buddies could improve some internal controls. For example, DVR did not approve all invoices within statutory timelines. Best Buddies did not include required supporting documentation for all invoices for completed benchmarks, and DVR approved those invoices without the proper supporting documentation. Finally, internal controls could be strengthened to ensure policies, procedures, and other provider related guidance are consistently and effectively communicated to providers.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nStreamline its invoice gathering, inspection, and approval procedures to ensure timely supervisory approval of invoices for payment;\n\nReject invoices submitted for benchmark payment if all required supporting documentation is not included in the invoice submission; and\n\nStreamline its notification process to ensure up-to-date policies, procedures, and other provider related guidance are consistently and effectively communicated to providers and remain available on the DVR web site for future reference.\n\nWe recommended Best Buddies:\n\nEnhance its internal procedures to ensure all required supporting documentation is maintained and provided to DVR with the submitted invoices.\n\nSuncoast CIL – 30 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2122DOE-016\n\nIssue Date: 04/19/2022\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-1819-027, Suncoast Center for Independent Living (CIL).

This audit satisfies the requirements of House Bill 1079, passed during the 2020-2021 Legislative Session, which amended section 287.136, Florida Statutes, to require a periodic risk-based compliance audit of all contracts executed by a state agency to identify any trends in vendor preferences.\n\nAudit Results:\n\nAs required by section 287.136, Florida Statutes, we found no trends in vendor preference by DOE for the review period. We concluded the procurement function has implemented internal processes and procedures sufficient to ensure compliance with state purchasing laws and found no material instances of non-compliance with procurement laws for the period reviewed.\n\nCenter for Independent Living in Central Florida, Inc. – 18 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2122DOE-015\n\nIssue Date: 04/13/2022\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-1920DOE-021, Center for Independent Living in Central Florida, Inc.

The purpose of this audit was to determine whether Miami Lighthouse is meeting the requirements of the agreement with DBS, and whether DBS is effectively monitoring adherence to the agreement. During this audit we noted, in general, the Miami Lighthouse provided services in accordance with the agreement and had sufficient internal controls in place. However, we noted that DBS could improve certain internal controls. We cited that DBS did not properly conduct on-site or desk review monitoring of the Senior Group Activities Program for Fiscal Year 2019-2020.\n\nWe recommended the DBS:\n\nConduct on-site or desk review monitoring of the Miami Lighthouse, Inc. Senior Group Activities Program in accordance with contract requirements; and\n\nDevelop a risk assessment tool and monitoring plan for each monitoring period to aid its monitoring requirement to more strategically review CRP-based blind services programs.\n\nApprenticeship Program (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2021DOE-009\n\nIssue Date: 11/10/2021\n\nThe OIG conducted an audit of the Apprenticeship Program overseen by the Apprenticeship Section within the Division of Career and Adult Education (DCAE). The purpose of the engagement was to ensure the Apprenticeship Section had sufficient internal controls over the registration of apprenticeship and preapprenticeship programs and monitored the programs in compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. During this audit we noted that, in general, the Apprenticeship Section had sufficient internal controls for the registration of apprenticeship and preapprenticeship programs. However, we identified opportunities for strengthening controls associated with the State Apprenticeship Advisory Council (SAAC) and monitoring of apprenticeship programs. For example, we noted the SAAC is not in compliance with the requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). During the scope of the audit, all appointed members served beyond their original four-year terms, and the SAAC did not meet at the frequency required by the CFR. We also noted the Apprenticeship Section did not conduct Provisional Quality Assurance Assessments and Quality Assurance Assessments at the frequency outlined in the CFR. Additionally, the assessment documentation maintained at headquarters was incomplete and inconsistent.\n\nWe recommended the DCAE:\n\nContinue to seek to fill all positions in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations and the Florida Statutes and document its efforts;\n\nSAAC resume meeting bi-annually and maintain publicly available minutes of each meeting in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations;\n\nConduct Provisional Quality Assurance Assessments and subsequent Quality Assurance Assessments in a timely manner as required in the Code of Federal Regulations. To assist the section in ensuring the timeliness of assessments, the section should develop an internal log to track quality assurance activities. The log, at minimum, should include all the registered programs, date of registration, length of training cycle, date of the completed PQAA, date of the last completed QAA, date of the completed EEO Compliance Reviews, and the next QAA due date. This practice would allow for continuity of work if there is a change in personnel;\n\nConduct a comprehensive assessment of their programs to document the dates of the last completed assurance reviews and ensure quality assessments are conducted in the timeframes required by the CFR;\n\nEnsure the documentation of assurance and compliance reviews submitted to headquarters is consistent, as this serves as the program’s official file. The quality assurance assessment file maintained at the department should, at minimum, include a copy of the RAPIDS entry page; the Apprenticeship Program Quality Assessment form, the QAA-Final outcome letter, and documentation of any required follow-up. The records for EEO Compliance Reviews, at minimum, should contain the EEO checklist, the completed EEO Compliance Review Guide, and a final outcome letter, if separate from the QAA-Final Outcome Letter; and\n\nUpdate the ATR manual to require the ATRs to submit assessment documents to the department.\n\nCenter for Independent Living in Central Florida, Inc. – 12 Month Status (PDF)\n\nReport Number: F-2122DOE-004\n\nIssue Date: 10/14/2021\n\nThe OIG followed-up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in report #A-1920DOE-021, Center for Independent Living in Central Florida, Inc.

The purpose of this audit was to determine if JFG is providing services in accordance with the contracts and whether DVR is effectively monitoring adherence to the contractual terms; determine if the Jobs for Florida’s Graduates is providing Pre-Employment Transition Services in accordance with contract terms; and determine whether payments are made in accordance with contract terms and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. JFG delivers Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) to students who are eligible, or potentially eligible, to receive Vocational Rehabilitation services. The services provided under these contracts shall only include Work Readiness Training, Self-Advocacy, Postsecondary Educational Counseling, Job Exploration Counseling, and Work-Based Learning Experiences. During this audit we noted that, in general, JFG is providing services in accordance with contractual terms; however, we noted instances where DVR and JFG could improve internal controls. For example, DVR did not provide effective monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan and risk assessment; DVR did not inspect and approve invoices timely; contractual payment terms and financial consequences did not align; students served were not in the VR or Student Transition Activities Record (STAR) system in an active status at commencement of services; internal controls to track service hours for students in non-credit classes need improvement; and certain instructors provided Pre-ETS services without required credentials.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nComplete monitoring plans in accordance with the risk assessment and reflect sufficient activities to monitor medium risk providers;\n\nConduct monitoring in accordance with the risk assessment and monitoring plan;\n\nProvide any monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to JFG and ensure corrective action plans have been created and initiated on noted program deficiencies;\n\nUpdate monitoring plans as necessary to accommodate for changing circumstances;\n\nStreamline its invoice gathering, inspection, and approval procedures to ensure timely approval of invoices;\n\nEstablish a plan to address staffing changes to ensure they continue to receive documents, review submittals in a timely manner, and verify achievement of deliverables;\n\nClarify contract language to specify the supporting documentation to be included with invoice submittals;\n\nConsider updating the payment schedule and ensure the contract language meets the intent and desired deliverables of the program;\n\nConsider restructuring the payment schedule in the contract to require payment to JFG for services provided each month, as reflected on the monthly Model Service reports, rather than equal monthly payments that require a reconciliation in the final month of the contract;\n\nModify the contract language to require that services commence after DVR refers the student to JFG;\n\nShould work with JFG to develop a more efficient process to record and track all student referrals;\n\nProvide additional training to the DVR Youth Techs to ensure all staff are consistently following the new process for student referrals;\n\nShould ensure all students have appropriate referrals prior to approving payment for services to those students and ensure that contractual caps on student hours are not exceeded;\n\nRequest the referred students prior to the start of the school year, review their status in the VR or STAR system, alert JFG to those students who are approved for services, and deny payment for any student that is not in an active status;\n\nImplement internal controls to require additional evidence of services rendered to students outside of the public, for-credit courses. This could be accomplished by requiring sign-in sheets for the students as well as notations on the monthly service reports that reflect the unique status of the students;\n\nRequest a copy of the Professional Educator’s Certificate or a current Temporary Certificate during their monitoring process to ensure compliance with contractual language; and\n\nRequire JFG to provide a list of the teachers providing Pre-ETS services under the contract periodically throughout the school year to ensure that teacher contact information is accurate and the teachers possess the required certifications. If the parties mutually agree to allow otherwise qualified individuals to provide services, the contract language should be modified accordingly.\n\nWe recommended JFG:\n\nWork with DVR to develop an efficient and effective student referral process that allows both parties to identify and track which students are eligible for services;\n\nEnsure that students are eligible prior to billing for services;\n\nComply with the contract language requiring all individuals hired to provide services under this contract hold either a current Professional Educator’s Certificate or a current Temporary Certificate; and\n\nObtain copies of the certificates for their records and provide the certificates to DVR upon request.\n\nThe Family Café (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: A-2021DOE-018\n\nIssue Date: 7/28/21\n\nThe Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of the agreements between the Bureau of Exceptional Education and Student Services (BEESS) and The Family Café (Cooperation, Advocacy, Friendship, and Empowerment), Inc. The purpose of this audit was to determine whether BEESS effectively manages and monitors the agreement; whether the Family Café achieves its performance targets and deliverables in accordance with the agreements; and determine if payments and expenditures made through the agreement are made in accordance with terms and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. During this audit we noted that, in general, BEESS monitored the agreement and The Family Café met the majority of the deliverable targets. However, there were instances where improvements could be made to strengthen controls. For example, we cited The Family Café did not submit, nor did BEESS require, a modified budget narrative for changes to the project budget for agreement #37F-90745-9Q001. We also noted that The Family Café submitted, and the department paid for, vague invoices and invoices without adequate documentation. Finally, we determined The Family Café did not achieve one deliverable in 2018-19 related to providing scholarships to conference attendees and could improve the tracking of the conference scholarship awards. We further reviewed internal controls surrounding the awarding of contracts in which The Family Café staff or board members have an interest. In the case of the Audio/Visual contracts, we confirmed that The Family Café obtained quotes from other vendors and awarded the contract to the lowest vendor, who was also a family member of a board member. We noted that the bylaws in effect during the scope of the audit did not include a conflict of interest clause. The bylaws were amended on February 26, 2021, to include an article stipulating what constitutes a conflict of interest.\n\nWe recommend BEESS:\n\nRequest and review The Family Café interim and final disbursement reports throughout the agreement period and ensure modified narrative forms are required as necessary in accordance with agreement terms;\n\nConsider clarifying the agreement language and include a percentage variation, or a combination of a percentage variation and dollar threshold per budget line;\n\nRequest and review invoices submitted by The Family Café during the agreement term to ensure invoices are appropriately detailed and align with the approved budget narrative;\n\nReview these invoices when conducting programmatic monitoring;\n\nAdd a conflict of interest statement in their grant language that requires disclosure of conflicts of interest and additional safeguards for employees;\n\nUtilize their project liaison enhance their monitoring of project deliverables by periodically ensuring a sufficient number of scholarship program families utilize the conference hotel; and\n\nEnsure the cost per unit in the Schedule of Deliverables are proportionate to the deliverable in the event a payment reduction is required.\n\nWe recommend the Family Café:\n\nSubmit a modified Budget Narrative Form (DOE 101) and a written justification for all changes to the project budget in accordance with agreement terms;\n\nInclude details in the submitted invoices to adequately depict the services billed and ensure all supporting documentation accompanies invoices submitted for payment;\n\nRefer decisions related to expenditure approvals between The Family Café, Office of the Comptroller, and BESE be documented in writing;\n\nEnsure achievement of the deliverable to support families attending The Annual Family Café; and\n\nEnhance their tracking mechanisms to better account for families and individuals awarded scholarships and utilizing the conference hotel while attending the annual event.\n\nJackson County School Board Adults with Disabilities Program – 6 Month Follow Up (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: F-2021DOE-033\n\nIssue Date: 7/30/2021\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations in Report #A-2021DOE-004, Jackson County School Board Adults with Disabilities program. DVR and Jackson County School Board management have indicated corrective action has been initiated for each of their reported deficiencies. We will need to check back in 6 months to ensure the new grant was signed and put into effective timely, but as this grant has not been published yet, we will close the project.\n\nAudit Reports Issued in Fiscal Year 2020-2021\n\nCreative Action, Inc (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: A-2021DOE-021\n\nIssue Date: 6/22/21\n\nThe OIG conducted an audit of the pre-employment transition services Contract #19-190 between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and Creative Action, Inc. The purpose of this audit was to determine if Creative Action, Inc. has sufficient internal controls to provide effective delivery of pre-employment transition services and whether DVR is effectively monitoring the contract. During this audit, we noted that Creative Action, Inc. generally provided services in accordance with Contract #19-190 and had sufficient internal controls in place, and DVR provided effective oversight of the contract. However, we noted instances where DVR could improve certain internal controls. For example, we cited instances where DVR did not approve invoices timely. We additionally noted that DVR could strengthen its monitoring process by reporting monitoring results to the Contractor.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nStreamline its invoice gathering, inspection, and approval procedures to ensure timely approval of invoices;\n\nProvide the monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to Creative Action, Inc. and ensure corrective action is implemented for noted deficiencies; and\n\nUtilize the DVR 2018 Provider Monitoring Guidebook or develop new procedures specific to monitoring practices for contracts.\n\nTechnology Contracts (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: C-2021DOE-008\n\nIssue Date: 6/23/21\n\nThe OIG conducted a consulting engagement of the DOE technology contracts or agreements. The purpose of this engagement was to determine whether technology contracts conform to enterprise standards, applicable frameworks, and legal and regulatory requirements and effectively manage risk related to the provision of Information Technology (IT) services. During this engagement, we noted that, in general, the department’s technology contracts appropriately addressed security and risk management requirements. We reviewed information security language including the confidentiality of data, breaches, change control, and background screenings. We additionally reviewed the contract templates and selected IT contracts and agreements to determine whether they included the appropriate risk management requirements, language regarding the management and ownership of data, and language detailing what occurs when service is not fully rendered. Upon review of the contract templates and sampled IT contracts and agreements, we identified areas of improvement in the areas of background screenings, retrieval of data, and destruction of data. We additionally provided recommendations to the Division of Technology and Innovation and the Office of Contracts and Procurements.\n\nWe recommended the department:\n\n• Add a section to the contract template and applicable procurement instrument that specifically states background checks should occur prior to the contractors or vendors beginning work if the contractor or vendor will have access to department IT environments;\n\n• Establish policies and procedures related to background screenings, which include the identification of disqualifying criteria for individuals who will have access to the department’s environment;\n\n• Add a placeholder to the template and applicable procurement instrument regarding the ownership and retrieval of data;\n\n• Add a placeholder to the contract template and related to the destruction of data upon the conclusion of the contract or when there is no longer a need to store the data;\n\n• Following the termination of any contract in accordance with the provisions of said contract, require the contractor to:\n\na. Return promptly to the department all physical copies of confidential data in the contractor’s possession or in the possession of its representatives; and\n\nb. Destroy all electronic copies of such confidential data, information, and notes including electronic copies prepared by the contractor or any of its representatives, in a manner that ensures the same may not be retrieved or undeleted; and\n\n• Consider creating and implementing a contract template specific to IT which contains the recommendations above and conforms to enterprise standards, applicable frameworks, legal and regulatory requirements, and effectively manages risk related to the provision of IT services.\n\nFlorida Alliance for Assistive Services and Technology, Inc.

The audits were combined into one report for streamlining and clarity purposes. The purpose of these audits was to determine whether BEC has appropriate internal controls over the educator certification process; ensures compliance with state regulations and department policies and procedures; and has effective information technology controls in place. During this audit we noted that, in general, BEC operated in compliance with the change management procedures documented in the Versa Technical Operational Manual. We determined BEC operated in compliance with the Information Technology Systems Disaster Recovery Plan and is appropriately backing up the Versa data. We determined the teacher certification applications flowed through the Versa system as designed, and batch processes ran in accordance with the manual. For the sample of applicants reviewed, we determined for those applicants that received a certification, all requirements were met in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations. We further confirmed that those applicants that did not receive certifications were missing required elements needed for certification. We additionally determined there is an appropriate separation of duties and controls in place to ensure mailed payments are processed securely. We also identified instances where improvements could be made to strengthen some controls associated with the certification process. For example, we cited that current queries and calculations return inconsistent data and reports; the Versa Analytics function is not operational; the Versa system lacks certain needed functionality; BEC did not process all applications within statutory timeframes; and security controls related to user access need improvement. We additionally provided recommendations to the Communication Sections to enhance their processes and monitoring.\n\nWe recommended BEC:\n\nDetermine the required calculations and subsequent queries based on the needs of the program office, validate the calculations, and maintain documentation of the calculations and queries for future use;\n\nCross-train team members on the Versa system and the certification process in the event a team member departs from the agency and is no longer available to perform the needed functions;\n\nPartner with DTI to develop custom reports based on select original Logi reports, which then could be provided routinely to BEC to assist them in tracking production on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis;\n\nEngage in discussions with the Versa vendor regarding the inability to use the Versa Analytics tool purchased as part of the contract;\n\nConduct a cost analysis for enhancing the Versa system in order to make key dates visible to users;\n\nConsider continuation of the previous request for quote to procure the services of an Information Technology professional to assess the Versa system and BEC business processes and produce a gap analysis to identify areas where system enhancements could better support the business processes and ensure competent, reliable data and reports;\n\nEnsure all applications are processed in the time frame allotted by the Florida Statutes and decrease the time between the date the applications are eligible for evaluation and the date assigned to a specialist;\n\nConduct a cost analysis for enhancing the Versa system in order to assign applications more efficiently and timely;\n\nCross-train team members on the certification process in the event additional staff is needed to process applications timely when application numbers surge;\n\nConsider moving District Issue Requests without associated background screening results to the release queue until the background screening results are appropriately provided and the application can be processed; and\n\nImprove security controls related to user access to ensure the continued protection of confidential data.\n\nConsulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc. (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: A-2021DOE-003\n\nIssue Date: 3/9/21\n\nThe OIG conducted an audit of the employment services agreement between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and Consulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc. The purpose of this audit was to determine if Consulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc., has sufficient internal controls to provide effective delivery of employment services and whether DVR is effectively monitoring the agreement. During this audit, we noted that, in general, Consulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc., provided services in accordance with the Employment Services Provider Manual and had sufficient controls in place. We determined DVR provided effective oversight of the agreement, as demonstrated by well-documented monitoring efforts. We additionally determined DVR appropriately made benchmark payments upon confirmation of achieved benchmarks. However, there were instances where improvements could be made to strengthen controls. For example, we cited instances where Consulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc., did not submit quarterly staff reports in accordance with the provider manual.\n\nWe recommended DVR ensure all required reports are submitted within the timeframe required by the manual. We recommended Consulting Services by Tami Sparks, Inc. report quarterly staff reports timely to DVR, as defined in the Provider Manual. Should there be no event changes from a previous reporting quarter, a current report should still be submitted for the next defined reporting quarter.\n\n21st Century Community Learning Center Grants– 18 Month Follow Up\n\nReport Nbr: F-2021DOE-020\n\nIssue Date: 1/26/2021\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations contained in Report #A-1819-015, 21st Century Community Learning Center Grants.

The purpose of this audit was to determine whether DBS effectively manages and monitors the Independent Living Older Blind Program and whether the Community Rehabilitation Providers (CRP) are delivering services in accordance with contractual terms. During this audit we noted that, in general, the CRPs met the contractual requirements for initial intake, assessment, and timely rendering of services for older blind clients; and DBS effectively monitored the CRPs to ensure they met contractual standards and service delivery requirements. However, there were instances where improvements could be made to strengthen some of these controls. For example, we cited instances where Comprehensive Functional Assessments (CFAs) occurred after the client’s individualized plan was developed and signed. We additionally determined DBS could enhance the CRP Risk Assessment and subsequent monitoring.\n\nWe recommended DBS:\n\nClarify requirements for the recording of CFAs through its program manual and its contracts to better direct CRP case managers completing the CFAs;\n\nMonitor the CRPs to ensure the needs assessments are completed prior to the plans;\n\nConsider conducting training and technical assistance following these adjustments to ensure services rendered to older blind clients are offered through consistent application of assessment tools;\n\nIn future monitoring, finalize the monitoring reports and provide the reports and results to the CRPs;\n\nModify the risk assessment to include a numerical score for previous monitoring;\n\nClearly define the type of monitoring that should be conducted based on the risk category; and\n\nConsider developing a monitoring tracking system that displays the timing of its monitoring process to include scheduled visits, summarized results of visits, findings identified, and the dates corrective actions were implemented and completed.\n\nJackson County School Board Adults with Disabilities Program (PDF)\n\nReport Number: A-2021DOE-004\n\nIssue Date: 1/29/21\n\nThe OIG conducted an audit of the 2019-20 grant agreement between the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) and the Jackson County School District Adults with Disabilities (JCSD AWD) program. The purpose of this audit was to determine whether JCSD has sufficient internal controls to provide services to adults with disabilities in compliance with grant terms and whether DVR is effectively monitoring the grant. During this audit, we noted that JCSD met DVR’s grant expectations and met the required annual deliverables. In addition, we noted the sampled Adult Individual Education Plans (AIEPs) met the grant requirements, included detailed and measurable deliverables for achievement of the educational and functional goals, and were well documented. However, we did note instances where improvements could be made to strengthen internal controls for both DVR and JCSD. For example, we cited instances where DVR did not conduct effective monitoring of the grant; grant language was unclear and inconsistent; JCSD did not meet all quarterly grant deliverables; and a lack of communication and sense of urgency related to this grant led to delayed execution of the grant, inconsistent submission and review of quarterly reports, and insufficient opportunities for program improvement throughout the grant period.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nComplete monitoring plans in accordance with the risk assessment and reflect sufficient activities to monitor high risk providers;\n\nConduct monitoring in accordance with the risk assessment and monitoring plan;\n\nPromptly provide any monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to JCSD;\n\nEnsure corrective action plans have been created and initiated on noted program deficiencies;\n\nInclude a review of expenditures incurred and the supporting documentation as part of their monitoring efforts to ensure expenditures are supported, allowable, allocable, and necessary to the performance of the grant;\n\nReview the grant language and ensure the deliverable requirements are consistent throughout the grant;\n\nDetermine the intent of the grant and desired deliverables and modify the grant language accordingly to clarify the requirements for quarterly and cumulative benchmark attainment;\n\nIf the grant language remains unchanged, ensure deliverables are met on a quarterly basis through review of AIEPs, short term objectives, and other documentation that support benchmark progress and achievement;\n\nIf quarterly deliverables are not met, require JCSD to complete a corrective action plan;\n\nExecute the AWD grants in a timely manner;\n\nEstablish a consistent method of submittal and document receipt of the required quarterly documents, either by requiring JCSD to uploading documents to a secure online portal or mail the documents as a hard copy;\n\nShould hardcopy be the preferred method of delivery, use a tracking system to verify when DVR receives the documents; and\n\nEstablish a plan to address staff turnover during a grant term to ensure they continue to receive documents timely, review submittals in a timely manner, and verify achievement of deliverables.\n\nWe recommended JCSD:\n\nEnsure that all expenditures align with the approved original budget narrative form;\n\nEnsure the DOE forms and 301 forms submitted to DVR are accurate, supported, and align with the final 399 form;\n\nSubmit corrective action plans in the event quarterly deliverables are not met;\n\nInclude a summary of the number of participants who have achieved benchmarks 1 and 2 in the quarterly document submittal;\n\nEnsure that documentation submitted to DVR is complete, accurate, and supports the achievement of quarterly deliverables; and\n\nIn the event documents are mailed, retain documentation to demonstrate the date the items were mailed and ensure delivery of the documents to DVR.\n\nPayroll Process- 6 Month Follow-up (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: F-2021DOE-014\n\nIssue Date: 1/14/21\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations contained in Report #A-1920-006, Payroll Process.

The purpose of this audit was to determine if the CIL’s internal controls ensure effective delivery of program services to individuals with disabilities and determine if DVR effectively manages and monitors the contract for compliance. During this audit, we noted that the CIL’s internal controls could be improved and DVR could strengthen oversight of the contract. We noted instances where the CIL did not maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate appropriate allocation of Contract #19-103 funds; consumer service records (CSR) did not include all required elements and documentation could be strengthened; and DVR did not provide effective monitoring in accordance with the monitoring agreement.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nConduct monitoring in accordance with the risk assessment and monitoring plan;\n\nPromptly provide any monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to the CIL and ensure corrective action has been initiated on noted deficiencies;\n\nInclude a review of expenditures incurred and the supporting documentation as part of their monitoring efforts to ensure expenditures are supported, allowable, allocable, reasonable, and necessary to the performance of the contract; and\n\nInclude a review of CSRs in its monitoring activities and ensure consumers have been deemed eligible for services in accordance with the federal regulations.\n\nWe recommended CIL:\n\nNotate the funding allocations on the individual invoices or expense categories to support expenditures incurred;\n\nEnhance its procedures to ensure expenses funded through DVR’s contract are allowable and appropriately reflected by funding source;\n\nImprove disability verification practices and documentation by including an eligibility determination statement in the CSR; and\n\nEstablish Independent Living plans with consumers prior to rendering services.\n\nSuncoast Center for Independent Living – 12 Month Follow Up (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: F-2021DOE-007\n\nIssue Date: 10/26/20\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations contained in Report #A-1819-027, Suncoast Center for Independent Living (CIL).

The purpose of this audit was to determine if the department has effective internal controls over the payroll process, maintains appropriate separation of duties related to the payroll process, and securely maintains access to personally identifiable information related to the payroll process to protect against unauthorized access.\n\nDuring this audit, we determined that the department generally had sufficient internal controls in place over the payroll process and the security of personally identifiable information related to the payroll process. We identified one instance where improvements could be made to strengthen the security of personally identifiable information. We cited instances where Bureau of Personnel Management did not follow the guidelines set by the Department of Management in regards to the storage of Social Security Numbers.\n\nWe recommended the Bureau of Personnel Management:\n\nRemove all copies of social security cards from the department’s primary personnel files and store them in a separate confidential file, such as the I-9 file; and\n\nProvide guidance to personnel liaisons instructing them that social security cards should not be stored in individual personnel files and ensure copies of the social security cards are removed.\n\nAudit Reports Issued in Fiscal Year 2019-2020\n\nSeclusion and Restraint Data Collection and Reporting Process (PDF)\n\nReport Number: C-1920-019\n\nIssue Date: 6/24/20\n\nThe OIG conducted a consulting engagement to review the department’s seclusion and restraint data collection and reporting process. The engagement included the Bureau of Exceptional Education and Student Services (BEESS), the Division of Technology and Innovation, and the Division of Accountability, Research, and Measurement. The period of this engagement was from July 1, 2018, through February 28, 2020. The objective of the engagement was to determine whether the department has an effective process in place to collect and report seclusion and restraint data in accordance with laws, rules, and regulations. During this engagement we noted that, in general, the department complies with the statutory requirements to collect information regarding incidents involving seclusion and restraint for students with disabilities. The department is also reporting the required information to the federal Office for Civil Rights. Through this engagement we identified areas of improvement for the seclusion and restraint data collection and reporting process, including identifying the recommended option of one collection point utilizing the BEESS data system.\n\nWe recommended:\n\nBEESS add a data field in the BEESS data system to record the date districts prepare incident reports and the date the final reports are sent to parents or guardians. We additionally recommended BEESS periodically review the data to identify areas of possible noncompliance and identify districts who many need technical assistance or additional monitoring.\n\nThe department create one collection point for seclusion and restraint data using the current BEESS system which would include both ESE student and non-ESE student incidents. We additionally recommended the BEESS system utilize the student’s Florida Education Identifier number and import the student demographic database table into the BEESS system.\n\nFlorida Endowment for Vocational Rehabilitation, Inc., dba The Able Trust - 12 Month Follow-up (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: F-1920-0031\n\nIssue Date: 6/25/20\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations contained in Report #A-1819-021, Florida Endowment for Vocational Rehabilitation, Inc., dba The Able Trust.

The purpose of this audit was to determine if Nassau County School Board has sufficient internal controls to provide effective delivery of WBLE services in compliance with contractual terms and DVR is effectively monitoring the contracts.\n\nDuring this audit, we noted that the Nassau County School Board generally had sufficient controls in place, and DVR generally provided effective oversight of the WBLE contracts. However, there were instances where improvements could be made to strengthen some of these controls. For example, we cited instances where DVR did not provide effective monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan, tier level determinations in the contract were vague, Plan & Agreement WBLE goals did not always align with WBLE experiences, and the Nassau County School Board did not report WBLE service hours in the final reports.\n\nWe recommended DVR:\n\nConduct and document monitoring activities in accordance with the risk assessment and subsequent monitoring plan. We recommend DVR provide the monitoring results and recommendations for improvement to Nassau County School Board and ensure corrective action has been initiated on noted deficiencies. We recommend DVR conduct semi-annual Rehabilitation Electronic Billing Application (REBA) data analysis, conduct sample case reviews, and conduct full monitoring semi-annually for the duration of the Nassau County School Board WBLE contract based on the risk evaluation. We further recommend DVR utilize the DVR 2018 Provider Monitoring Guidebook or develop new procedures to include monitoring practices for contracts.\n\nClarify and strengthen the contract language regarding tier level determinations for students. We additionally recommend DVR provide training to all Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors who provide WBLE guidance to ensure tier levels are consistently and accurately determined, correlate with the IPEs, and align with the mission of the program.\n\nEnsure the WBLE goals align with WBLE experiences in the Plan & Agreements, and if services do not align, ensure the provider has provided a valid explanation of the variances prior to payment. We additionally recommend DVR provide training to all Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors who provide WBLE guidance to ensure communication with the providers is consistent and aligns with the mission of the program.\n\nRevise the WBLE final report form to include a data reporting field for WBLE service hours related to the contract. We further recommend DVR ensure the minimum service hours have been met by Nassau County School Board prior to issuing the final payment.\n\nWe recommended Nassau County School Board:\n\nEnsure the appropriate tier level for WBLE services that correlates with the students’ IPEs and IEPs.\n\nEnsure that all students participating in WBLE services are placed in WBLE experiences that align with their WBLE goals through the Plan & Agreement process. If WBLE services differ from the goal, we recommend Nassau County School Board provide a detailed explanation on how the desired work experience relates to targeted WBLE goals or expected outcomes in the student’s Plan & Agreement.\n\nReport WBLE service hours, including supporting documentation, in accordance with the contract. In addition, we recommend Nassau County School Board maintain WBLE timesheets for student service hours in accordance with the WBLE start and end dates reflected in the rating forms.\n\nUniversity of South Florida - 18 Month Follow Up (PDF)\n\nReport Nbr: F-1920-025\n\nIssue Date: 5/15/20\n\nThe OIG followed up on the status of corrective actions required in response to findings and recommendations contained in Report #A-1718-017, University of South Florida.
