        "text": "Aspen School District opened the week with new initiatives aimed at elevating academic achievement and building on long-standing traditions.The 2024-2025 school year opened with a single-start time. All students in all schools begin at 8 a.m. The move back to a single-start time benefits parents of children in multiple grades and allows athletic teams to start and end after-school practices earlier.Congratulations, Aspen School District!“As we wrap up the first week of school, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to our incredible staff, students, and parents,” said ASD Superintendent Tharyn Mulberry. “Their dedication and hard work have set a strong foundation for what promises to be an extraordinary year.“And to our parents, their support is invaluable. We couldn’t do this without their partnership, and I’m grateful for the trust they have placed in us.“Here’s to a year filled with learning, growth, and success for everyone in our school community. Let’s continue to strive for excellence and make this an unforgettable year!” **The week’s highlights:**Building upgrades: Teachers and students walked into school buildings and classrooms with fresh paint and carpet and electrical and plumbing upgrades. Aspen High School students saw their gyms polished and restriped and new floors throughout the school that brighten up the hallways.“Our rooms are looking great!” said AES fourth-grade teacher Katie Fox. “A fresh coat of paint and the new carpet have made AES look fresh. Joe (Waneka, Facilities Director) and his team really went above and beyond helping with the move and refresh. It has been a fabulous start. Best start in a decade! Outdoor Education: Teachers and students are preparing for their Outdoor Education trips that for some grades begin next week. This year, ASD is excited to announce that its Outdoor Education program, under the direction of Katherine Gleason, is the first and only school district to earn accreditation from the Association of Experiential Education (AEE). To earn AEE accreditation ASD showed how it met more than 150 minimum standards assessed by the organization as being essential to providing quality, well-managed outdoor and experiential education. “Our program is unique. Outdoor Ed is for every single student in our district,” said Katherine Gleason, Outdoor Education Coordinator. We make accommodations as necessary, as we do with all students, so they can have their best opportunity for success. It’s a really special opportunity for teachers to have lasting connections with their students.PYP: AES teachers and staff hit the ground running with their IB Primary Years Programme, which makes Aspen School District an IB World School - the only one in the state of Colorado - that provides a fully integrated IB curriculum from Pre-K to 12th grade for all students in the district.Fourth-grade teacher Fox said: “We cannot wait to inquire with our students. The transdisciplinary approach of PYP allows us to grow in each unit of inquiry (UOI). Our current UOI will dive into the form and function of the figurative and literal heart and our government! The unit culminates with a fabulous trip to Denver to share inquiry at the Capitol.”CTE: Career and Technical Education (CTE) teachers start the new school year with CTE teacher Anita Moose spearheading the AHS Information Technology (IT) pathway at Aspen High School. The IT pathway will be our 8th pathway offering for students (others are Aviation, Business, Culinary, Media, Outdoor Leadership, Woodshop and Engineering). CTE is also happy to announce that teacher David Clark has rejoined the CTE team this year and returns as the Hospitality and Culinary Arts teacher. He will bring ProStart back and prepare Aspen's next generation of professional chefs. (He also will still teach history). “Great things are happening around CTE are happening at Aspen High School.” said Sheri Smith, CTE Director and Business teacher.\n\nDear Community Members,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. We are writing to provide an update on the Maroon Creek Trail project and to inform you of some important measures we are implementing to ensure the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists during this work.\n\n**Traffic Impacts: **\n\nDue to the construction, the intermittent single-lane traffic on Maroon Creek Road will continue during all days except for the first day of school, August 21, 2024. We understand this may cause some inconvenience and appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work diligently to complete these necessary improvements. There will be no impacts to the bus stops or bus routes on Maroon Creek Road.\n\nMaroon Creek Bridge Closure and Pedestrian Detour Information:\n\nThe Maroon Creek bridge is currently not accessible to pedestrians or cyclists as we are facilitating construction work. Please refer to the attached map for detailed directions on alternate pedestrian and bike paths. To ensure safety, a flagger will be stationed at the detour to assist pedestrians crossing Maroon Creek Road.\n\nRevised Work Hours:\n\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on traffic during school days, we will revise our construction work hours for work impacting Maroon Creek Road. Work impacting Maroon Creek Road will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. This adjustment is intended to reduce congestion and ensure smoother traffic flow on Maroon Creek Road during the peak times of school and commuter traffic.\n\nOngoing Communication:\n\nWe will continue to monitor the construction schedule and make any necessary adjustments to the detour and work hours as needed. Your safety is our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding as we work to construct the Maroon Creek Trail.\n\nIf you have any questions or require further information, please feel free to reach out to me or visit our project page: https://www.aspen.gov/1406/​Maroon-Creek-Trail-Project\n\nThank you for your cooperation and continued support.\n\nAspen School District is the first district in Colorado authorized to offer IB from Pre-K to grade12 IB, in their \"IB For ALL\" academic program.\n\nAspen Elementary School has been authorized to offer the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme - an educational framework that aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.\n\nThe PYP authorization makes Aspen School District an IB School District - the only one in the state of Colorado - that provides a fully integrated IB curriculum from Pre-K to 12th grade for all students in the district.\n\nIn the authorization letter from International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) Director General Olli-Pekka Heinonen said: “We commend your school’s educators, administrators, students and families for their active roles in choosing to offer the PYP.”\n\nLast summer, Aspen Middle School was authorized as an IB Middle Years Programme. Aspen High School has offered the IB Diploma Programme since 2001.\n\nSuperintendent Tharyn Mulberry, who led the IB teams through the curriculum development and implementation process, said a fully aligned Pre-K-12 educational program is transformative.\n\n“We believe that a high-quality curriculum should be given to every student and they should have access to that,” Mulberry said. “We are very excited that we will be one of the first school districts in the country to be a fully integrated and aligned IB school district.”\n\nAES Principal Ashley Bodkins said the journey students, staff and families have taken to become an IB Primary Years Programme has been incredible.\n\n“All participants have put in a great deal of time and effort learning the framework, developing units, writing policies and understanding what it means to be a PYP school,” she said. “The most rewarding part of the process is the outcomes for our students. They have fully embraced the Learner Profile (attributes of a successful learner) in their everyday language in the classroom, on the playground and at home. Students take ownership of their learning through inquiry based units.”\n\nASD Director of IB Continuum and Student Learning Harpreet Mehta explains that PYP, the last piece of the ASD IB puzzle, offers an inquiry-based, transdisciplinary curriculum framework that builds conceptual understandings and knowledge and develops the skills and values as a connected whole.\n\n“It is a student-centered approach to education for children,” she said. “Every learner in a PYP school will always have some of the IB Learner Profile traits at one time or another. This makes learners see themselves as successful and adept - therefore having self-efficacy.”\n\nThe IB curriculum provides opportunities to inquire into human commonalities through units of inquiry and daily practice to build international mindedness, Mehta said. The assessment within this framework is rigorous and celebratory; and at the same time it is also taken to inform instruction instead as a measure of teacher and student success.\n\nMehta said that research has now proven that PYP students have excellent outcomes in national assessments (Key findings from global research on the impact of IB Programmes) because there is increased use of inquiry, student voice, global perspectives, open mindedness, individualization in instruction, celebration of diverse student accomplishments, student engagements-relationships-agency-ownership of learning, teacher and parent engagement and reflections.\n\n“We have great teachers who are passionate about what they do in the classroom,” she said. “Aspen Elementary School teachers are really caring and really involved and they create and trigger that curiosity of students. Our students have the right conditions to be able to prepare themselves for the new global economy and the evolving canvas.”\n\nVisit ASD’s IB page for more information."
