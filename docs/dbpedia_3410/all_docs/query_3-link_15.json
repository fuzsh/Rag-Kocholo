        "text": "Best Buddies envisions a world where people with IDD are so successfully integrated into our schools, workplaces, and communities that our efforts and services will be unnecessary. Until that vision becomes a reality, the organization will continue to educate students, community members, corporations, and employers about the emotional, functional, and natural needs and abilities of people with IDD.\n\nBest Buddies long-term goals are to:\n\n• Increase contact and inclusion of people with IDD in all aspects of society.\n\n• Increase the level of interest and understanding of IDD.\n\n• Increase comfort levels around people with IDD.\n\n• Increase social support and decrease reports of peer victimization and loneliness among participants with IDD.\n\n• Increase opportunities and resources for people with IDD to achieve self-determination.\n\nThe Buddies Buddies 2020 Initiative aims to open offices in all 50 states by the end of 2020. The initiative also includes plans to train 4,000 Buddy Ambassadors, develop 1,000 jobs for people with IDD around the world, and increase the number of school-based chapters to 2,500. As a result of these ambitious efforts, Best Buddies hopes to become a household name by the end of 2020.\n\nBest Buddies achieves goals through our three program pillars – One-to-One Friendships, Integrated Employment and Leadership Development. Best Buddies Middle Schools, High Schools and Colleges create an inclusive school environment for students with and without IDD during times of social and emotional development. Best Buddies Citizens helps adults with IDD develop meaningful friendships and become more involved in their local communities. e-Buddies offers an e-mail program, in which participants with IDD communicate online with a friend without IDD. Best Buddies Jobs secures integrated employment for people with IDD, allowing them to earn an income, pay taxes, and continuously and independently support themselves. Best Buddies Jobs matches skilled, qualified individuals with IDD with businesses seeking enthusiastic and dedicated employees. Through the Jobs program, Best Buddies develops partnerships with employers, assists with the hiring process and provides ongoing support to the employee and employer. Best Buddies Leadership Development programs educate and empowers people with and without IDD to become leaders, public speakers and advocates. Best Buddies Ambassadors offers people with IDD the opportunity to gain the public speaking skills, self-esteem and confidence needed to successfully advocate for themselves, their peers and Best Buddies in communities, workplaces and government. Best Buddies Promoters empowers youth to become advocates for people with IDD and help open new Best Buddies chapters and programs by organizing special events that promote awareness to the disability rights movement.\n\nSome of our strategies include:\n\n• Expanding on-boarding and learning management systems to recruit and retain staff.\n\n• Creating and improving online resources for staff and volunteers to streamline access to materials.\n\n• Refining our database and constituent management systems to raise funds and communicate more effectively.\n\n• Producing a high profile annual report to provide funders with accomplishments.\n\n• Creating an alumni association to continue involvement of volunteers.\n\n• Increasing media and social networking presence to reach new audiences.\n\n• Advancing nationwide partnerships to advocate, educate and mobilize people to join the inclusion movement.\n\n• Growing the number of state offices to serve more people nationwide.\n\nBest Buddies is a nationwide leader in the inclusion and peer mentoring movement. More than 200 staff members deliver hands-on services and an increasing number of our student volunteers are coming to work for the organization after graduation.\n\nThe power of mutually rewarding mentoring relationships has always been recognized by Best Buddies as well as our supporters. The agency is capable to sustain and expand programs because the Board, staff, volunteers and business/community supporters understand, appreciate and embrace the importance of the mission statement. Best Buddies has worked diligently with funders to establish relationships through our network of professional athletes, celebrities, and other supporters including the thousands of cyclists who raise funds at our premier events: The Best Challenge Hearst Castle, Hyannis Port, Washington, and most recently Miami.\n\nSince its inception, Best Buddies has engaged more than 400,000 young participants who have now graduated and are pursuing careers. Each year an estimated 75,000 participants will complete their participation in the Best Buddies high school and college chapters. We are currently conducting research on this group and have discovered that many of our alumni have proven to be leaders in and advocates for the disability rights movement and have pursued careers in the health field, as attorneys, in special education and many other sectors. Our hope is that this network of volunteers will work with civil society organizations, governments, donors and other agencies to advance the inclusion of people with IDD .\n\nMr. Shriver said, \"The great thing about Best Buddies is there's something for everybody. You can be a volunteer in some shape, form or fashion - whether your son or daughter is involved in their school program, whether you want to be a mentor yourself, whether you want to get an online Buddy, or whether you're an employer and want to hire someone with a disability. If you've got any sense of motivation and determination and want to give back, there's a role for you at Best Buddies, which I think is pretty unique.\"\n\nThere are currently 25 Best Buddies State offices and new offices have recently opened in North Carolina, Missouri, and Ohio. The Best Buddies Jobs (BBJ) program is now offered in 17 locations. Starting in 2015, we launched Best Buddies Jobs in eight new domestic locations including Broward County, Orlando and Palm Beach County, FL; Baltimore, MD; Dallas, TX; Indianapolis, IN; Nashville, TN; and New York City, NY. In addition, we also expanded the international Jobs program to five sites: Lima, Peru; São Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; and Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Leon, México. BBJ is scheduled to launch in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Moscow, Russia in fall 2017. BBJ served nearly 1,200 participants around the globe this year, a significant increase from previous years.\n\nAs of January 2017, nearly 600 Ambassadors have received training and dozens of new trainings will occur in 2018. Increasing our geographical presence in the Caribbean and Latin America are in planning stages at this time."
