        "text": "Latest News\n\nBest Buddies Launches Eunie’s Buddies: A Lifeline for Families with Children with Special Needs\n\nWhen a family receives the earth-shattering news that their child has an intellectual or developmental disability, the whirlwind of emotions can feel devastating. In the span of a few minutes, dreams shatter while questions and fears multiply rapidly. An experience that was supposed to be filled with joy and anticipation pivots sharply to confusion and grief. But what if amid that swirling chaos, a fellow parent who had walked this path showed up simply to listen and say, “Me too - you are not alone”?\n\nLeaders From Around the World to Unite in the Name of Inclusion at the Best Buddies International Leadership Conference in Bloomington, Indiana\n\nNearly 2,000 student leaders, volunteers, and staff from Best Buddies International’s programs around the world, will participate in the event July 19-21 at Indiana University in Bloomington. The conference will prepare the organization’s students leaders to be strong, passionate forerunners as they promote the mission of Best Buddies in their local schools and communities and inspire the world one person at a time."
