        "text": "On Thursday, Oct. 12, Anthony Kennedy Shriver, the founder, chairman & CEO of Best Buddies International, was joined by friends and supporters for a heartwarming reception at Hotel Jerome, co-hosted by Ken and Michelle Stiller, Larry and Marla Butler, Ricky and Drita Rosin, and Nicky Ufkes. The evening began with cocktails, appetizers, and conversation, along with a brief program featuring a piano and singing performance by Global Ambassador Marlana VanHoose and a second piano and singing performance by Colorado State Ambassador Shivam Talwar. The spirit across the ballroom and Antler Bar was infectious, as the Best Buddies community is a close-knit one – filled with love, care, and consideration.\n\nBest Buddies was founded in 1989 to foster one-to-one friendships between people with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), and it continues its important work in establishing a global volunteer movement that serves those with Down syndrome, autism, Fragile X, Williams syndrome, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and other undiagnosed disabilities.\n\nAs the world’s largest organization dedicated to ending the social, physical, and economic isolation of the 200 million people with IDD, Best Buddies’ programs help to form meaningful friendships with peers, secure successful jobs, live independently, improve public speaking, self-advocacy, and communication skills, and feel valued by society.\n\nShriver noted his dream to hold a Best Buddies prom in the very same ballroom at Hotel Jerome in the spring of 2024, which was met with a joyous response as he painted the picture from the podium."
