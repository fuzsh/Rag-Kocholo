        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nCUTX recently announced its partnership with Best Buddies International to expand the CUTX Greeter Program, which employs individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), across all of its branch locations in North and East Texas.\n\nThe program, which CUTX launched in 2021, is expected to triple in size and add over 20 new greeters throughout the coming year with the new partnership.\n\nALLEN, Texas, Sept. 8, 2023 –Credit Union of Texas (CUTX) recently announced its partnership with Best Buddies International (Best Buddies), to expand the CUTX Greeter Program, which employs individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), across all of its branch locations in North and East Texas. Best Buddies is a nonprofit organization that creates one-to-one friendship, integrated employment, leadership development and inclusive living opportunities for those with IDD. The program, which CUTX launched in 2021, is expected to triple in size and add over 20 new greeters throughout the coming year with the new partnership.\n\n“We’re proud of the job opportunities we’ve provided to individuals through our greeter program, and our greeters are an instrumental part of our team who welcome members into our branches and assist them during their visits,” said President and CEO of CUTX, Eric Pointer. “We’re excited to partner with Best Buddies to increase our reach and impact, and their expertise will only strengthen our ability to equip greeters with the tools and resources they need to be self-sufficient and set them up for future growth and development.”\n\nThrough the Best Buddies Jobs program, which helps individuals with IDD achieve meaningful employment and is active in 20 states, Best Buddies has helped program participants in Texas gain employment with companies including Michaels Stores, Albertsons Companies, Accenture and Gucci.\n\nAs part of the partnership, Best Buddies employment coaches will train CUTX staff members to work and engage with individuals with IDD, focusing on teaching diversity and inclusion, establishing workplace expectations and creating a successful work environment.\n\nBest Buddies employment coaches will also work with the credit union to identify program applicants for potential future employment. Once admitted to the program, participants will receive support from Best Buddies employment coaches and CUTX staff to ensure their readiness for their roles. This support includes training with periodic check-ins to ensure participants meet expectations and feedback on performance and interaction suggestions.\n\nCUTX’s relationships with local school districts will also continue to play a vital role in the program. Students with IDD will also be selected from area schools to serve as greeters and provided with job skills needed for future employment. Upon graduation, participants will work directly with the Best Buddies team to determine potential job opportunities. CUTX currently employs students from Frisco, Wylie, McKinney and Rockwall independent school districts (ISDs) as special needs greeters.\n\n“We’re thrilled to work with CUTX to enhance their already great greeter program,” said Cheyenne Jock, director of jobs for Best Buddies Texas. “Creating integrated employment and leadership development opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities is at the core of what we do and our partnership with CUTX will be key in carrying out that mission in North and East Texas.”\n\nAbout CUTX\n\nFor almost 100 years, Credit Union of Texas has provided financial services to members throughout North Texas. Living out its vision to deliver an unexpected experience, CUTX has grown to over $2.5 billion in assets. Most Texas residents may qualify for membership. In the last year, CUTX was recognized with the Communities Foundation of Texas “Be in Good Company” Seal of Excellence, voted the Best Credit Union in DFW by the readers of The Dallas Morning News, and named the winner of the Torch Awards for Ethics from both the Better Business Bureau Serving North Central Texas and the International Association of Better Business Bureaus.
