        "text": "Best Buddies Leadership Conference (BBLC) unites Best Buddies leaders, volunteers, and community advocates from around the globe to connect, engage and lead our inclusive movement. Over the past 33 years, BBLC has inspired thousands of leaders to be advocates for social change in their communities. We are in need of 90-100 volunteers to join us at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN, this July 21st through the 24th for this transformative experience.The volunteer role is serving as a speech coach, working with 2-3 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, who come to the conference with a speech, or at least an outline, and then work to perfect and deliver it by the end of the weekend. Volunteers need to make a commitment to the entire weekend. Ideally, weâ€™re looking for anyone who might be involved in academia, or studying to be a teacher, etc., as the role involves teaching, coaching, instructing, advising, etc., or anyone who might be pursuing a field in the disability arena.Attendees have the opportunity to connect with global leaders who are passionate about creating a more inclusive world for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Attendees will have the opportunity to experience inspiring speakers, educational workshops, interactive roundtables, networking opportunities, epic performances, inclusive activities, and fun and engaging events.Please contact kathydirusso@bestbuddies.org with any additional questions."
