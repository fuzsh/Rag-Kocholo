        "text": "Anthony Kennedy Shriver is the Founder, Chairman & CEO of Best Buddies International, which he created in 1989 to foster one-to-one friendships between people with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Recognizing the tremendous volunteer potential of university students, Shriver first inspired his college peers to personally collaborate in expanding the realm of opportunities that people with IDD should experience.\n\nToday, through Shriver’s stewardship and entrepreneurial spirit, Best Buddies® has grown into a leading nonprofit entity with increasing international reach across six continents, establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with IDD.\n\nBest Buddies is comprised of nine programs that positively impact more than 1.3 million individuals with and without disabilities worldwide. The organization is active in each of the 50 states and operates accredited international programs in 56 countries and territories.\n\nA graduate of Georgetown University, Shriver has been recognized for his work on behalf of Best Buddies with diverse international accolades and honorary degrees. He is the father of five beautiful children and resides in Miami Beach, Florida."
