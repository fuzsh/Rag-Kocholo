        "text": "Cold Stone® is a proud partner of Best Buddies®!\n\nCold Stone Creamery® National Fundraiser\n\nCold Stone Creamery proudly supports Best Buddies® and their mission to end the social, physical and economic isolation of the 200 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Best Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\n\nDuring the month of August 2019, Cold Stone Creamery is hosting a nationwide fundraising promotion to raise money for Best Buddies International. Customers who donate $1 or more to Best Buddies at participating Cold Stone® locations receive double My Cold Stone Club® Rewards points!\n\nBest Buddies® Jobs Program Launches at Cold Stone Creamery®\n\nDid you know that an estimated 81% of adults over the age of eighteen with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) do not have a paid job in the community? The Best Buddies Jobs program helps close the gap by securing jobs for people with IDD giving them the opportunity to earn an income, pay taxes, and continuously and independently support themselves. The program expands beyond the typical positions in which a person with IDD might be placed and instead focuses on finding work that matches the job seeker’s specific interests and talents.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Cold Stone Creamery launched a nationwide Jobs program with Best Buddies. Shortly after the launch, the Cold Stone Creamery store in Astoria, New York hired their first participant, Marcial. He is excelling in his position and lights up the store with his vibrant smile.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nAbout Best Buddies®\n\nBest Buddies International is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).
