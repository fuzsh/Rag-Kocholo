        "text": "Last school year, Decatur High School students founded a chapter of Best Buddies International as an expansion of the existing club Fast Friends. Best Buddies International is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). While Fast Friends also provides opportunities to build strong friendships between neurotypical and neurodivergent students, Best Buddies is focused on deepening these friendships through one-to-one connections.\n\nAs part of the DHS Best Buddies chapter, some members are matched with a “buddy” whom they communicate with weekly and meet with twice monthly. Other students help with fundraising and event planning. “It is a great opportunity to celebrate our commonalities and our differences and learn from each other, while having the support of Best Buddies International,” said Mara Ferent, the chapter’s co-founder.\n\nThe international organization encourages its chapters to host a monthly group event or excursion. While the club was successful in raising $2,400 last year, Mara wrote a DEF Student Innovation Grant to ensure that every Best Buddy who wanted to participate could be included.\n\nThe DHS Best Buddies Chapter currently has around 50 members. Through the grant, DEF is helping fund some of the group’s planned events. In October, the Best Buddies pairs took advantage of the beautiful fall weather and held a picnic at McKoy Park to dress up for Halloween and paint pumpkins. And in the coming months, they plan to visit the Fernbank Museum and the rooftop at Ponce City Market and attend Teen Night at the High Museum.\n\nThis project aligns closely with the City Schools of Decatur’s mission of creating a space where every student feels included as well as ensuring equity for students. These values are at the core of Best Buddies.\n\n“I have learned so much from my experience and am super excited to expand our chapter and support the establishment of our second chapter in City Schools of Decatur at Beacon Hill Middle School,” commented Mara. “I hope others will join us in celebrating the beauty of friendship and spreading the positive message of inclusion.”"
