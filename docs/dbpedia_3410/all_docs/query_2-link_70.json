        "text": "Katie Meade has done a lot in her life. Now just 32 years old, she's competed as a gymnast and as a basketball player in the Special Olympics, survived heart surgery, and become the first model with Down syndrome to be involved with a beauty campaign. Last week the world exploded with joy over the news that Meade is the face of a product for the new hair-care company Beauty & Pinups. Meade's beaming face can be seen on the package for the company's Fearless Hair Rescue Masque. She looks awesome.\n\nFor Meade, the milestone is meaningful in ways that go beyond the pride she feels in her own achievement. As the spokeswoman for Best Buddies International, she wants to totally break down any barriers people with Down syndrome may feel they face. \"I'm so much more than that. I have abilities, not a disability, and this is true for everyone with Down syndrome,\" says Meade. \"We can chase our dreams and inspire others, just like everyone else.\" She also wants people who don't have Down syndrome to let go of any preconceived notions about those who do have it. \"I want them to see that I'm just another girl who loves hair and makeup,\" she says.\n\nMeade has always had a strong affinity for beauty. When she was growing up, her older sisters would do her hair and makeup for school and dances. \"They'd always show me cool new brands,\" she says.\"Now when I get my hair and makeup done, I send them pictures because they live across the country, in Maine and Texas.\" (Meade lives in Des Moines.)\n\nAs for her beauty icon? None other than Jennifer Lopez. \"I watch her on American Idol, and she always looks so good,\" says Meade. \"Her clothes and makeup always look amazing.\" No arguments here. With an upcoming guest spot on the new makeup competition show, Global Beauty Masters, Meade says she's been working on perfecting her makeup game. And her most prominent makeup struggle is one most of us can probably relate to: \"I love wearing false eyelashes, but I need a little help putting them on,\" she says."
