Christopher Koch, 81, an Australian author whose 1978 novel

The Year of Living Dangerously

was the basis of the award-winning film about intrigue in Indonesia, died Sept. 23 in Hobart, Tasmania.

He had cancer, according to Australian news reports. His agent, Margaret Connolly, confirmed his death to news agencies.

Mr. Koch published two novels and worked in radio before embarking on The Year of Living Dangerously. The novel, which takes place during a political uprising in Indonesia in 1965, was well received when it was published. But it captured international attention only after it was made into a film by Australian director Peter Weir in 1982.

The memorable title, first uttered by Indonesian leader Sukarno in the 1960s, became a catchphrase denoting any prolonged period of danger, intrigue, or personal risk.

Mr. Koch, who published seven other novels, had mixed feelings about being identified so strongly with just one of them.

"If a book is made into a film, they hang it around your neck forever," he told the Weekend Australian newspaper last year. "I've written other books since that I think might be better, but people always come back to that one and it's because it was a film. That's how much film dominates our culture."
