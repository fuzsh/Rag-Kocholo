        "text": "This spring, Maine lawmakers endured bomb threats to the State House and their homes after a public hearing on the “shield bill” for providers of reproductive and transgender health care.\n\nAttorneys general from 16 states that have banned abortion care, health care for transgender people, or both, threatened our lawmakers for even considering the bill. Lawmakers also contended with harmful disinformation about Maine’s current laws, abortion care, care for transgender people and the people who seek that care, from outside and from inside our state, including from some elected officials.\n\nYet faced with all of that, a majority of Maine’s elected leaders stood up to violent threats, harmful rhetoric and attempts to disrupt policymaking and passed legislation to protect Maine’s health care providers from laws in other states that target access to safe, legal care in Maine. Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund applauds those state legislators along with Gov. Janet Mills for signing this essential measure.\n\nLD 227 will take effect on Aug. 9. At a moment when reproductive liberties and LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly under attack, this achievement is a reminder that Maine remains a safe harbor and beacon of hope in the national storm.\n\nRight now, 22 states have enacted bans or near-total bans on abortion care. At least 26 have passed laws banning access to safe and effective gender-affirming care for adolescents, and some have moved to restrict access to gender-affirming care for adults.\n\nThese discriminatory and dangerous policies have devastating consequences for providers, patients and their families. Yet, extremists who peddle these laws continue their assault on our fundamental freedoms, and are even attempting to reach beyond their state borders to interfere with safe, legal health care in other states.\n\nThat’s where Maine’s new law comes in. Maine joins at least 17 other states and Washington, D.C. in enacting this type of law to protect medical experts who provide legal, essential health care.\n\nMuch of the debate around this law focused on transgender health care and, unfortunately, much of the rhetoric deployed by people opposed to safe, effective medical care for transgender people relied on false, dishonest and malicious narratives. We saw just how far extremists both inside and outside of our state – elected officials included – were willing to go to stoke fear, misinform the public and put personal beliefs ahead of evidence-based medicine and patient care.\n\nAnd no matter how they spin it for upcoming elections, the politicians who chose to spread those lies share the ultimate goal of banning this care, as well as abortion care, here in Maine and nationwide.\n\nThe truth is, politicians are unqualified to make decisions about our health care. We should all be free to make private, personal and deeply complex medical decisions in consultation with our trusted medical providers and without interference by politicians. LD 227 adds a layer of protection for Maine’s providers and reaffirms that we as a state trust providers and patients to make these decisions.\n\nThis month we can celebrate that LD 227 takes effect in Maine. But we must remain vigilant. The vile attacks we witnessed relative to LD 227 – threats of violence, political attacks and flat-out lies – are clear and present evidence that extremists will not stop their assaults on our rights and freedoms. The goal is total control over our bodies and our futures.\n\nAbortion is health care. Transgender health care is health care. Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund won’t stop fighting to ensure everyone has access to the health care they need, when they need it. We are grateful to be in this fight with all of the Mainers, all of the patients, all of the advocates and all of the lawmakers who worked to pass LD 227 into law. And we urge all Mainers who value reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights to hold their elected leaders accountable at the ballot box."
