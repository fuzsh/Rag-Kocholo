        "text": "The long list of Yellowstone spinoff series is growing with a new contemporary series, and Michelle Pfeiffer is set to take on a leading role in the forthcoming story.\n\nThe new spinoff, Madison -- previously announced as 2024 -- is a \"heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.\" Pfeiffer will also serve as an executive producer on the series.\n\n\"Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace,\" said Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global Co-CEO and President/CEO, Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios in a statement announcing the new show. \"She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the Yellowstone universe, Madison, from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan.\"\n\nThis will mark the three-time Oscar nominee's second television role in 40 years, after she previously starred as Betty Ford in the anthology series The First Lady in 2022.\n\nAlongside Pfeiffer, Deadline previously reported that Kurt Russell was also in talks to join the series, as well as Suits star Patrick J. Adams. The Good Doctor's Beau Garrett is also reportedly set to sign on.\n\nProduction is slated to begin soon in New York, Montana and Texas, and the spinoff is expected to premiere in 2025, after the finale of the franchise's main series, Yellowstone -- which kicks off season 5B on Nov. 10.\n\nTaylor Sheridan's Yellowstone franchise has been wildly popular and expansive since it first began, sparking a number of well-received spinoffs that have attracted A-list talent. 1883 was the first prequel series, starring Sam Elliot, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, followed by 1923, starring Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren.\n\nApart from Madison, there is also another planned prequel series in the works, titled 1944. The series has gotten the green light, but no details have yet been released.\n\nFor more on the final season of Yellowstone, check out the video below."
