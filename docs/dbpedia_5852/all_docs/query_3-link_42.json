        "text": "WENDELL—Lila Marie Koch, 84, a resident of Wendell, Idaho, passed away on Wednesday, October 21, 2020 at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Twin Falls after a short illness.\n\nLila Marie Martindale was born on September 4, 1936 in Burley, Idaho, the daughter of Harold and Onda Martindale of Burley. Lila was the third of seven children. She had five brothers – Harold Jr., John, Joe, Frank, Jerry and two sisters – Ida and Karen.\n\nShe was raised and educated in Burley. She met her future husband – Seymour Koch in Paul, Idaho. Lila married Seymour on July 3, 1953 at the Lutheran Church in Rupert, Idaho. While Seymour served in the Korean War, Lila worked at Woolworth’s in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nLila and Seymour had six children of their own – Mickey, Keri, Danny, Joyce, Jana and Kelly. They helped in raising Christopher Koch, Jesse McKean and Dustin McKean.\n\nLila worked at the Wendell Manor for years and went to the College of Southern Idaho for Nursing. Lila later worked for Thousand Springs in Buhl, as well as the specialty department at Clear Springs Foods. She worked at both places for many years until she retired. During her lifetime, Mom stressed to her children, “It’s all about family.” She would host Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve dinners every year until her daughters got the honor of continuing the tradition. It was especially important to Mom and Dad to have family over every Sunday for dinner.\n\nMom made sure that family was a big part of our lives. Mom and Dad took us on trips to Yellowstone and every year we would have a family reunion camping trip in the North Sawtooth’s. Where all of us would meet and occupy a campground and have the times of our lives. We always had “terms of endearments” such as “Tootle Loo, my Buckaroo” and nicknames for all of us kids.\n\nShe is survived by: three sons – Keri (Terrie) Koch of Gooding, Dan (Janice) Koch of Wendell and Kelly Koch, also of Wendell; two daughters – Joyce McKean of Jerome and Hana (Olin) Mink of Wendell; five brothers – Harold Jr (Sue), John (Elsa), Joe (Ellen), Frank, Jerry (Mary) and two sisters – Ida (Elmer Essig) and Karen (Larry Haskin); 25 grandchildren; 39 great grandchildren; and 16 great great grandchildren.\n\nShe was preceded in death by: son – Mickey Koch; grandson – Christopher Koch; parents – Harold and Onda Martindale; sister – Ida Essig; and two brothers – John Martindale and Frank Martindale.\n\nA viewing for family and friends will be held on Thursday, October 29, 2020 from 4:00 to 7:00 pm at Demaray Funeral Service – Wendell Chapel. Please following social distancing recommendations.\n\nA graveside service will be held on Friday, October 30, 2020 at 2:00 pm at the Wendell Cemetery in Wendell.\n\nCondolences, memories and photos can be shared with the family by following the obituary link at www.demarayfuneralservice.com."
