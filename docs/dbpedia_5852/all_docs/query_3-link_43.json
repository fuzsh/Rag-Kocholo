Koch\n\nKevin Christopher Koch (57), husband of Linda (Reinschmidt) Koch, passed away peacefully at home on Saturday, October 1, 2022 with his family by his side after a long battle with cancer. Kevin is survived by his children Brittny Koch Blaha, wife of David and mother of Jacob, Kevin Koch II engaged to Nicole Trusa, and Joseph Koch. Kevin was born to Jeannette (Reidinger) Koch and Harry Koch on January 29, 1965, in Dover, NJ. Kevin was predeceased by his brother Harry Koch and Harry’s three sons. He is also survived by his sisters Beverly (Koch) Niehls, and Rosalie (Koch) Lefurge.\n\nKevin attended Sussex County Technical School with an emphasis in auto mechanics, and worked in the construction field throughout his career doing home remodeling. He was generous with his spare time and often did remodeling projects for his family members. He took great pride in his work.\n\nKevin loved the game of baseball and was a lifelong Yankees fan. He also enjoyed watching NASCAR and went to many races with his friends and family. Roses were Kevin’s favorite flowers, and he planted them in the gardens around his yard every year.\n\nKevin’s life positively impacted many, and his memory will live on in the hearts of his family and friends. In lieu of flowers, Kevin requested donations go to St. Jude Children’s Hospital.\n\nFamily and friends may call Wednesday, October 5, 2022 from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM at MacFadden Funeral Home, Belvidere, NJ with Funeral Services to be held at 11:30 AM.
