        "text": "C.J. Koch (born July 16, 1932, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia—died September 23, 2013, Hobart) was an Australian novelist whose sensually detailed works often explore the relationship of illusion with reality.\n\nKoch was educated in Hobart at the University of Tasmania and worked for the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio producer before devoting himself to writing in 1972. His most famous and acclaimed novel, The Year of Living Dangerously (1978), follows radio journalist Guy Hamilton as he arrives in Indonesia on the eve of a coup intended to topple the dictator Sukarno. The character Billy Kwan exemplifies a motif in Koch’s work, the individual who pays a mortal price for another’s self-discovery. Koch later wrote the screenplay for a film version (1982) by Australian director Peter Weir."
