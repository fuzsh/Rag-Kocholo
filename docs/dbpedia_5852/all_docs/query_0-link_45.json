        "text": "In Christopher Koch’s The Boys in the Island, Hobart is described as ‘a city, but only just’. That novel is set in the 1950’s and Hobart has grown a lot since then. Other capital cities have grown proportionately more, however, so maybe the epithet still applies. But only just.\n\nIn Search of Hobart is a collection of personal essays about living in Hobart by Peter Timms. The collection is introduced by his life partner and fellow author, Robert Dessaix and is part of the lovely City Series published by NewSouth Books a decade ago, where well-known local authors described/explained/enthused about their city for the edification of the rest of us.\n\nAs I am want to do, I read Peter Timms’ homage to Hobart whilst holidaying in Hobart.\n\nI started reading the night before departure, then read another couple of chapters on the flight over to Tasmania. But the majority of it was read in situ, in Hobart. Either in bed at night or in cafes over breakfast. It was a fabulous way to immerse myself in all things Hobart.\n\nDessaix clearly shows which side of the green divide he is on by the second paragraph of his Foreword, ‘with pathetic eagerness to be profitable, Tasmania has shown itself willing to chop itself down and pulp itself, if that’s what it takes to be of ‘use’….Tasmania doesn’t want to be merely beautiful. In fact, Tasmania is ready to disfigure itself in ways that will never heal.’ Timms is more circumspect throughout his book, but obviously of the same opinion.\n\nThings I learnt:\n\n1. The reasons why a smallish city has so much much traffic.\n\nIt’s due to the big mountains that dominate the Hobart skyline and long narrow shape of Hobart as it spread around the harbour rather than go up into the surrounding hills and the ‘inadequate’ public transport (bus is the only option currently available). As a result you can drive and park almost anywhere you want – with no toll roads, but terrible peak hour traffic!\n\n2. The conflict between new and old.\n\nLocals dislike of the Hotel Grand Chancellor (where we were staying!) is part of the ongoing ‘heritage battlefield’ in a city with more listed buildings than any other Australian capital.\n\nCertainly older localities like Arthur Circus, Battery Point and Salamanca Place have a great deal of street appeal and attract the tourists, whilst the outside of our large hotel is rather unattractive and imposing – it does not blend into its surrounds at all. It also dominates the harbour skyline. But inside it is lovely. Tastefully decorated with stunning views on Constitution Dock and a central venue for travellers to explore the city.\n\nThe building I disliked the most was around the corner at 1 Franklin Wharf – a brown brick block, or ‘shamelessly insensitive cack-brown box’ built in 1972, with miserly windows that stands out like a sore thumb.\n\n3. The views.\n\nThanks to Timms I was keen to check out all three lookouts he mentioned as soon as we collected our hire car a couple of days into our holiday. The impressive kunanyi/Mount Wellington lookout lays Hobart out before you from a breath-taking height.\n\nThe ‘less awe-inspiring but more engaging view’ from the Mount Nelson Signal Station is all but gone due to the growth in surrounding vegetation since 2012, but the Signal Station was interesting along with its views off to the other side towards Bruny Island. It also has a lovely cafe nearby.\n\nAcross the River Derwent is Rosny Lookout which was a great excuse to drive across the Tasman Bridge and genuinely has ‘the most picturesque perspective,’ especially of the aforementioned bridge.\n\n4. Why Hobart spreads out around the bay.\n\nHobart grew around the bay, hugging the base of the mountains ‘it snakes along the shores of the River Derwent, following the accessible contours.’ As a result, Hobart is ‘very long and narrow’ by design. It was also planned this way. As each successive group of immigrants arrived in Tasmania post-WWII, the government would create a new suburb for them.\n\nThe unintended consequences of this social housing approach led to ‘stigmatised…welfare suburbs….[and] a huge social divide.’ And disadvantaged, disaffected teenagers with not enough to do.\n\nIt’s a problem that many towns and cities face, but one of the ways it expresses itself in Hobart is hoons in hotted up cars. Every night we heard them racing noisily along Davey St and when we went up to kunanyi/Mount Wellington there was plenty of evidence of circle work and burnouts in the car park areas.\n\n5. The appeal of The Retro.\n\nMr Books spotted this cafe on one of our walks, then I read about it in Timms’ final chapter. It was the first cafe to appear in the new/old Salamanca district.\n\nWe were blessed with gorgeous weather the whole time we were in Hobart. Sitting outside The Retro under an umbrella, watching the passing parade was a tremendous thing to do.\n\nOpposite is Parliament House and their pretty gardens. The Retro (and other nearby cafes) have become favourite meeting places for politicians, but with a State election due soon they was a hive of political meetings and we spent our time trying to pick out familiar faces. On our last day in Tasmania I was thrilled when I realised that Bob Brown (former leader of the Australian Greens party) was waiting in line behind me to order his morning coffee.\n\n6. The MONA phenomenon.\n\nTimms’ devotes several pages to David Walsh and the creation of MONA. It had only been open a year by the time he wrote this piece, so he couldn’t know just how big an attraction this would become for tourists travelling to Tasmania. It might still best be described ‘as a gigantic private folly’ but it is tremendous fun, vibrant and dynamic. Walsh has created an experience that you’ll either love or hate, but you’ll never forget.\n\n7. First Nations names.\n\nThis is one of the areas that has changed a lot in the 10 years since publication. Timms’ laments that ‘Aboriginal terms are still notable for their absence’ however twelve years later palawa names are being used regularly in signage and place names. Many historical references also include the Indigenous perspective alongside the colonial narrative.\n\nWoven throughout the essays is Timms’ commentary on Hobart’s convict heritage, Aboriginal massacres and the various businesses and industries that ‘made’ Hobart what it is today. Many of these issues turned up in my reading of Richard Flanagan’s novel, Death of a River Guide and reread of Robbie Arnott’s Limberlost. I really enjoyed how all three books worked together.\n\nHobart was a little bit of history; a little bit of sociology; a little bit tour guide and a little bit personal reflection. In some places the 2012 pub. date showed its age but mostly it felt like chatting with a knowledgeable friend over a leisurely coffee in The Retro.\n\nIn the end I totally agreed with Timms that Hobart encapsulates the best of being ‘a big country town with capital-city infrastructure.’\n\nBibliofile:\n\nSydney | Delia Falconer\n\nAdelaide | Kerryn Goldsworthy"
