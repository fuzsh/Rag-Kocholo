        "text": "In The News\n\nTributes are paid to Australian author CJ Koch\n\nTRIBUTES have been paid to the Australian author CJ Koch, who has passed away at the age of 81.\n\nChristopher John Koch, who was born in Tasmania, wrote eight novels during his 55-year career. He will be best remembered for The Year of Living Dangerously, which was published in 1978, although the author believed some of his later work was better.\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously, which followed a reporter after the fall of the Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965, was made into a film starring Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson, released in 1982 (see below).\n\nThe young Koch had trained as a journalist, but was apparently working as a waiter in London when his first book was accepted by publishers in 1958. The book, The Boys in the Island, was the coming-of-age story of a young man from Tasmania who dreamed of moving to mainland Australia.\n\nBut it was to be 1972 before Mr. Koch decided to become a full-time writer. By that time he had been living back in Australia and working as a producer for the broadcaster ABC.\n\nHis later works included The Doubeman (1985) and Highways to a War (1996), both of which won Australia’s prestigious Miles Franklin Award. Much of his work explored Australia’s relationship with its Asian neighbours.\n\nWhen Mr. Koch was diagnosed with cancer in 2012 he was given just weeks to live, but he survived to see his final novel, Lost Voices, published in September that year.\n\nHe passed away in Tasmania.\n\nTo view the trailer for The Year of Living Dangerously, click here.\n\nView previous In the News items: Actress Jane Connell passes away, Photographer Harry Goodwin passes away, Tributes are paid to singer songwriter Jackie Lomax, Former car company chief Eiji Toyoda passes away, Tributes are paid to singer Joan Regan, Audio engineer Ray Dolby passes away, Tributes are paid to Susan Fitzgerald, Cancer remains the number one killer, Appeal to find grave in China, Broadcaster David Jacobs passes away, Funeral takes place of poet Seamus Heaney, Tributes are paid to broadcasting legend Sir David Frost, Former rugby international Cliff Morgan passes away, Tributes are paid to comedian Mike Winters, Actress Julie Harris passes away, Furniture designer Charles Pollock passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Lee Thompson Young, Dispute over burial plans for King Richard III continues, Rugby centre to be named after tragic young star, Tributes are paid to stuntman Mark Sutton, Drummer Jon Brookes passes away, Singer Eydie Gorme passes away, Tributes are paid to actress Karen Black, Wizard of Oz munchkin Margaret Pelligrini passes away, Webcam is set up at the grave of Andy Warhol, Broadcaster and music critic John Amis passes away, Businessman Berthold Beitz passes away, Actress Eileen Brennan passes away, Singer and songwriter JJ Cale passes away, Fracking pioneer George P Mitchell passes away, Security to be increased at City Cemetery, Tributes are paid to former boxing champion Emile Griffith, Actor Dennis Farina passes away, Tributes are paid to former Welsh footballer Phil Woosnam, Olympic medalist Todd Bennett passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Paul Bhattacharjee, Acouostics pioneer Amar Bose passes away, Tributes are paid to TV legend Alan Whicker, Actor Joe Conley passes away, Tributes are paid to computer mouse inventor Douglas Engelbart, Work still to begin on planned crematoriums, Photographer Bert Stern passes away, Tributes are paid to new wave drummer Alan Myers, Science fiction author Richard Matheson passes away, Blues singer Bobby Bland passes away, Tributes are paid to author Vince Flynn, Country singer Slim Whitman passes away, Funeral takes place of tragic Newry man, Former tennis champion Gene Mako passes away, Jazz flautist Sam Most passes away, Tributes are paid to pioneering chocolate maker, Champion racehorse trainer Sir Henry Cecil passes away, Former athletics star Donna Hartley passes away or Swimming movie star Esther Williams passes away"
