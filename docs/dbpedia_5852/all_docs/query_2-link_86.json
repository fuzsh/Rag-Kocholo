        "text": "Australian novelist, born in Hobart, educated at the University of Tasmania. His work, which draws on his experiences in Europe, America, and Asia, reflects a preoccupation with the political and cultural relationships between Australia and the Far East. His first novel, The Boys in the Island ( ; revised ) was acclaimed for its sensitive account of growing up in Tasmania and Melbourne. Across the Sea Wall ( ; revised ) was set in India and Australia and centres on the relationship between an Australian man and a Latvian girl. Its visionary quality and its themes of disillusionment and the corruption of idealism characterize subsequent works. The Year of Living Dangerously ( ) was widely admired for its complex and dramatic evocation of Jakarta in on the eve of Sukarno's fall; a film based on the novel appeared in . The Doubleman ( ) vividly evokes the spirit and landscapes of Tasmania. Crossing the Gap: A Novelist's Essays ( ) showed him to be a perceptive social and political observer and offers an illuminating account of his Tasmanian background."
