        "text": "George Russell Koch Sr., a man of great courage, intelligence, and selflessness, passed away peacefully at his residence in Headland, Alabama on September 24, 2023. Born on March 9, 1939, in Pennsylvania, George lived an incredible life that spanned 84 years, touching numerous lives with his service, dedication, and love for his family and country.\n\nHe was a man of many roles - a loving husband, a dedicated father, a proud grandfather, and an esteemed public servant. George was married to his loving wife, Dolores E. Koch, for 55 years since 1968. He was a proud father to George Russell Koch Jr., Barbara (John) Cerklefskie, Carrie (Olin) Walters, and Ashleigh (Nicholas) Gulick. He also held a special place in his heart for his 14 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. George was predeceased by his son, Christopher Michael Koch, and is survived by his sister, Martha Miller, along with numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nGeorge's dedication to his country was evident in his career choices. He served in the US Marines for seven years, a testament to his bravery and commitment. His service didn't stop there. George went on to work as a Federal Park Ranger and served in the Valley Forge Park Police for six to seven years. His diverse career also saw him serving as protection detail for several presidents and being a part of Harvest Church and the Gathering the Troops Ministry. Notably, he trained horses to be on the helipad for President Reagan. George lived in Lakewood, NJ for several years and later served as a Fish and Wildlife Inspector in Newark, NJ.\n\nGeorge was a man of diverse interests. He loved the great outdoors and was an avid fisherman and hunter. His love for nature was not only reflected in his hobbies but also in his work as a park ranger. As Albert Einstein once said, \"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.\" This quote seemed to embody George's philosophy of life.\n\nIn his private life, George was known for his intelligence, courage, and selflessness. He had a big heart and was always ready to lend a helping hand. His family and friends will remember him as a man who lived his life with honor and kindness, always putting others before himself.\n\nA celebration of George's life will be held at a later date."
