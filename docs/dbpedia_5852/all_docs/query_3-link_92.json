        "text": "Richard A. “Dick” Koch, 67 of Jefferson, passed away on January 18, 2024, from a snowmobile accident in Ridgeway, WI. In the midst of this significant loss, comfort should be found in knowing that Dick died while doing what he loved most—snowmobiling with family and friends.\n\nDick was born in Fort Atkinson, WI on July 24, 1956, to James “Jack” and Adela “Toots” (Jeske)\n\nKoch. He graduated from Jefferson High School in 1975. On April 16, 1984, he married Rita Clark at St. Mark’s Lutheran Church in Jefferson. Dick and Rita had two daughters and were married for 31 years until her death in 2016. Dick was a skilled metal machinist and foreman who contributed his expertise to several companies. In 2021, he retired and spent his time camping, golfing, snowmobiling, and watching Wisconsin sports teams. He was a long-time member of the Thursday Night Men’s Golf League in Jefferson and was active in the Jefferson SnowStormers Snowmobile Club. While camping, Dick was well-known for his homemade donuts and campfire popcorn.\n\nHe is survived by: daughters Sarah (Ben) Skretta and Jody Koch both of Jefferson; his mother Toots Koch of Fort Atkinson; brothers Dennis Koch of Sun Prairie, Darryl (Ingrid) Koch of Fort Atkinson, Gary (Roxanne) Koch of Fort Atkinson, and Mike (Julie) Koch of Jefferson. Dick is also survived by his nieces, nephews, in-laws, other family, and many friends.\n\nDick is preceded in death by his wife, Rita, and his father, Jack.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 7:00PM on Tuesday, January 23, 2024, at the Olsen-Gibson Funeral Home with Rev. Christopher Raiford of St. Mark’s Lutheran Church presiding. Visitation will be on Tuesday from 4:00PM until the time of service at the funeral home.\n\nThe Olsen-Gibson Funeral Home is caring for the family.
