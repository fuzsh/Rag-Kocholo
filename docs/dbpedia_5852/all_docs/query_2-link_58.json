He twice won the Miles Franklin Award and in 1995 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for contribution to Australian literature.\n\nHis novel The Year of Living Dangerously, set in Jakarta during the fall of the Sukarno regime, was made into a film directed by Peter Weir and starring Sigourney Weaver, Mel Gibson and Linda Hunt.The book was loosely inspired by his brother's (Philip Koch) experience as an Australian Journalist in Indonesia during that period."
