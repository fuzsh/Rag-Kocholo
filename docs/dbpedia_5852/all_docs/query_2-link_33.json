        "text": "Dr. Diane Koch is a board-certified Chiropractic Physician. At nine years old, her own diagnosis of scoliosis (an S-curve of her spine) placed her in a back brace for four years. When this medical treatment failed, she went to a chiropractor, and the positive results motivated her into the chiropractic field! She combines her passion for healthy living and nutrition for all of us in the office.\n\nDr. Diane Koch was born in Torrance, CA and moved to Arizona when she was three years old, and she considers herself a native Phoenician!\n\nShe attended Deer Valley High School and went on to attend Yavapai College on a basketball scholarship. She earned her Doctorate in Chiropractic at Life College in Georgia where she met and married Dr. Chris Koch.\n\nDr. Diane is the Vice-President of a Christian-based women’s mentoring group. She also enjoys exercising, eating healthy and spending her free time with family!\n\nDr. Ian Krutsinger is a board-certified Chiropractic Physician. Happily married to Emilie since 2021, they have an adorable fur-baby named Norman. He is NOT much of a lap-dog- he is a St. Bernard! Norman likes taking Dr. Krutsinger and his wife for walks through the neighborhood!\n\nHaving received his doctorate at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, he finished his education with very high honors- Magna Cum Laude! Along with his Doctorate, he is also a board certified Athletic Trainer. This degree was received at The University of Northern Iowa where he gained experience in high school and college sports like football, basketball, track and field, soccer and junior hockey. During his time at Palmer College of Chiropractic he worked as the head Athletic Trainer for the men’s and women’s rugby team traveling with the team and assisting them with on field injury assessment, as well as creating rehabilitation plans for the athletes. Prior moving to Arizona, he was practicing Chiropractic in a successful wellness clinic in Iowa while also working with a local high school as the team Chiropractic and Athletic Trainer.\n\nBorn and raised in small town Iowa, with small town Midwest values, he was modeled care and compassion by his parents and younger sister. In his free time, you’ll find him staying active by finding the best biking and hiking trails, cheering on the Iowa Hawkeyes, going to concerts (he is a country music fan!) and traveling.\n\nDr. Krutsinger’s true health journey began as a child, when his parents brought him to the Chiropractor! This is where his interest in Chiropractic started. He saw the relationships their family Chiropractor made with his patients, as well as the difference he made in their lives when it came to not only pain management, but their overall quality of life. He knew as soon as he started high school that he wanted to pursue a future in Chiropractic."
