Carly Announced this week that she will be performing at Treasure Island Resort & Casino Island Event Center in 2025.\n\nCARLY'S COMING BACK TO MINNESOTA IN 2025\n\nCarly will be performing at Treasure Island on Thursday, March 20th, 2025. Tickets will go on sale this Friday, August 9th at 10 am. You can click HERE to get your tickets or go to TIcasino.com.\n\nCARLY'S CAREER\n\nCarly Pearce is one of the hottest new country stars out there. Her latest single \"We Don't Fight Anymore,\" features the smooth voice of Chris Stapleton, which gave her a second Grammy nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance this year.\n\nCarly has an interesting musical background, growing up performing with bluegrass groups. Her first big hit was \"Every Little Thing\" which landed her a number 1 spot on the Billboard Country Music Charts in 2017.\n\nHUMMINGBIRD REVIEWS\n\nIf you are a lover of Carly Pearce's music, you can grab her latest album Hummingbird before you head to the show at Treasure Island, so you can learn all the songs before next year and sing along.\n\nHer album 'Hummingbird' is getting some great reviews. Highwayqueens.com had this to say:\n\n\"By choosing to start her new album with the killer line: 'country music made me do it and I'll do it til I die' followed by the sound of a fiddle, Carly Pearce is making it clear to country fans: She's in this genre for the long haul.\"\n\nCARLY'S SWEET SPOT\n\nCarly produced 'Hummingbird' herself which features a mix of bluegrass, pop, and 90s country. According to the article, Carly has found her sweet spot with the return of a more traditional country music style returning to the genre.\n\nSome stand-out songs include \"Heels over Head,\" and the closer 'Hummingbird' has 'moments of darkness, inspired by her bluegrass roots.'\n\nI'm looking forward to listening to Carly's album. What is your favorite Carly Pearce song to date? Let me know at kelly.cordes@townsquaremedia.com.\n\nThese people from the St. Cloud area have competed at the Olympic Games\n\nSee Minnesota's State Bird like you've never seen it before -- through the lens of Canadian photographer Chris Whitty"
