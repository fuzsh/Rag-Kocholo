        "text": "Chris Koch, Renowned Motivational Speaker, Canada\n\nChris Koch doesn’t let limitations or obstacles stand in his way. Despite being born without arms and legs, Chris grew up like any other small-town kid — playing road hockey, causing mischief at school, and helping out on his family farm. Neither he or his family treated his disability like a tragedy, and instead used it to fuel his dreams. Today, Chris is a motivational speaker who inspires his audiences to continually challenge themselves and build the life they dream of.\n\nBorn in Lethbridge, Alberta, Chris was raised in the small farming and ranching community of Nanton, Alberta. Early on, he learned that he would not be raised with pity or sympathy. Sure, he had to do things a little differently and some tasks took him a little longer to complete than others, but he was determined to be just like the rest and was always treated just like the rest. After all, he still had a good head on his shoulders and with that, anything is possible.\n\nChris loves sharing his story and spreading his message of, “If I Can…” An avid traveler, marathoner, and farmer, his presentation reflects his full life. Simply put, Chris says, if I can do what I’ve done so far in my life, what’s stopping others from doing the same?"
