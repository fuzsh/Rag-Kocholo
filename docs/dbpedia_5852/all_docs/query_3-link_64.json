        "text": "Dwayne Dean Koch was born August 3, 1964 in Pueblo, Colorado. He passed away Wednesday, January 18, 2023 in Caldwell, Kansas.\n\nDwayne was the oldest son of Russell Lee Koch and Darla May Adam Koch. He and his younger brother Randy loved spending summers in Westcliffe, where they worked hay fields with their family. They also got to spend time there with their older brother Pete and sister Gail Ann. Growing up Dwayne enjoyed riding horses, fishing, hunting, and playing cards (cheating at every game). Dwayne cherished the time he was able to spend with his grandpa Koch driving him to all of his cancer treatments. He also had a special bond with his grandma Adam who lived right across the street from them. Dwayne was definitely her favorite.\n\nDwayne graduated from East High in 1982 and went on to earn his Associates Degree in Construction Science from Pueblo Community College.\n\nDwayne accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior at the age of 19. He faithfully attended church and made sure his boys were there as well. He spent many Sunday mornings “meditating”.\n\nDwayne was always a hard worker. Throughout his life he has been a construction worker, custodian, even a Dominos delivery man. The last few years he enjoyed doing many construction projects for a variety of friends. There was always a honey-do list from Debbie, Bam, Chris, RyRy… His favorite job though was being a father and a papa.\n\nDwayne met Debbie Browning in 1983 while picking up his then girlfriend from school. They soon began dating and their first date was at the Colorado State Fair with some of his cousins. On date number three they shared their first kiss and were together from that moment on. They were married on November 24th, 1984. One day shy of their first anniversary they welcomed their first son Christopher Lee. James Dwayne joined the family March 9th, 1987 and Steven Joseph December 9th, 1988.\n\nDwayne and his father-in-law Jim Browning had a great relationship. When Jim asked the young couple to leave Colorado and move to Kansas it was Dwayne’s decision to do so. In January of 1988 Dwayne left his home of Pueblo to move to Caldwell, Kansas which was tough for the Colorado kid. He was always the first to go to the basement when the tornado sirens went off even leaving his children if necessary.\n\nWhen Dwayne was 24 the father of two young boys and one on the way his father-in-law died. Dwayne stepped up as a father figure to Jenny and JT. More than just a brother-in-law, eventually walking Jenny down the aisle and was J.T.’s best man.\n\nDwayne was an amazing father to his sons and a proud PaPa to his grandchildren. He was always there cheering them on. He was their biggest supporter. Knowing nothing about sports did not keep him from attending every single game. Dwayne and his brother-in-law Ryan took JT and the boys on the fishing derby each year. Something they all looked forward to.\n\nSeveral times a year Debbie and Dwayne took the boys to Colorado to spend time with their grandparents. Dwayne and his dad would go hangout in the garage away from the kids and the chaos. The boys loved going to the basement to play with all of Dwayne’s toys that his parents had saved in perfect condition.\n\nHe was a unique character. Drinking nothing but Pepsi (and occasionally buttermilk), he was a hoarder, accordion player, bowler, and thought he was funny even if no one else did. To say he was thrifty was an understatement, possibly the cheapest man we’ve ever known. He had a list in his wallet of what his children owed him and if Debbie left a tip he deemed too large, he would take it.\n\nDwayne was a quiet man but to those who were fortunate enough to know and love him, he was everything. When we lost him suddenly the comment “I’ve never heard a bad word about Dwayne Koch” was made multiple times.\n\nDwayne was preceded in death by his mother Darla May Koch; grandparents Helmeth and Esther Koch, Paul and Ellen Adam; in-laws Nancy and Jim Browning; and many beloved aunts and uncles.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 38 years Debbie Koch; sons Chris, James, and Steven; father\n\nRussell (Barbara) Koch; grandchildren Aliya Davis, Jayd and Charlotte Koch, Dallas Koch; siblings Pete (Priscilla) Koch, Gail Ann (Don) Jerow, Randy Koch, Jan Cohee, Jennifer (Ryan) Sturm, Jaques Williams, James (Bethany) Browning; and a host of other family and friends.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 10:00 a.m. Friday, January 27th, 2023 at the Hope Church in Caldwell, KS. The family is also planning to have a memorial in Colorado at a later date."
