        "text": "Koch, Albert W. Jr, “Chip” Of Burlington, passed away after a long illness on Thursday, March 1, 2018. He was 55 years old. Beloved father of Christopher Koch and his wife Tayla of Woburn and Kelly Koch and her significant other, Nicholas George of Chelmsford. He also leaves his former wife and friend Dolores Koch of Groton. Chip was the beloved son of the late Albert and Marjorie Koch. He was the proud “Grampy” of Avery Maguire and Ryan George. Brother of Robert Koch of Lowell, and Sharon Lunetta of Hanover. He was also survived by many nieces and nephews. Chip grew up in Burlington, after graduating high school, he went to work with his father, who owned Suburbanite Cesspool Service. He learned the business from the ground up, eventually taking over the reigns. He was a skilled heavy equipment operator. On his own he started a portable toilet company called “Athrone”, because they were “fit for a king”. He was never afraid of hard work and excelled in any business venture he put his mind to. Chip’s greatest love was his children and cherished any time spent with them and his grandchildren. Chip was the definition of “heart of gold”, and what made him happiest was being able to make others happy. Anywhere Chip went, he made an impression and had a personality that was not easily forgotten. It was Chip’s request that his funeral services would be private. Memorials in his name can be made to Burlington’s People Helping People charity, P.O. Box 343, Burlington, MA 01803."
