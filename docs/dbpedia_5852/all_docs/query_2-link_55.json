Koch’s writing has its finger on the pulse of today’s changing society. Not only does his work fall within a universal stream but it also stands out as a production of its own, built like a puzzle with distinct pieces. Through fiction, Koch explores other genres – the fairy tale, drama, poetry – to the point of producing multi-faceted works which challenge classification. In spite of the constant renewal of his settings for action, one notices the presence of a main thread which runs through Koch’s fiction: the antipodean and ambiguous relationship between illusion and reality.\n\nThis theoretically-informed monograph provides a book-by-book analysis of the novelist’s œuvre and gives a full picture of his Weltanschauung. It is valuable reference for scholars in Australian Studies, as well as those researching postcolonial, psychoanalytic and literary theories.\n\nThis book is also winner of the Excellence Award 2009 by the THESE-PAC jury (le prix THESE-PAC, Prix Jean-Pierre Piérard) in the South Pacific-Australasia category for his PhD dissertation on Christopher Koch, the subject of his Cambria Press monograph.\n\nRegarded as one of Australia’s leading novelists, Christopher Koch wrote seven novels set in his native Australia and in Asia, all characterized by an adventurous and nomadic protagonist yearning for another land.

Despite his Asia novels, Koch may be thought of as a Caucasian writer clinging to the idea of a White Australia pining for Europe, as attested by Out of Ireland and The Many-Coloured Land. This chapter analyses Koch’s literary representations of Australia by questioning his whitewashed hybridity. The novelist’s Eurocentric fantasies liberally sprinkled throughout his Asia novels could be taken as evidence of a lingering Empire at the forefront of his mind while fostering and publicising imperialistic ideologies that may well rekindle colonial tensions and revive interest in the “dying colonial world”."
