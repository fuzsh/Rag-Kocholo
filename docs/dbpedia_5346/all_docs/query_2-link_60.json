        "text": "No, she is not a lesbian. This all got started when she was campaigning for her mother in the Democratic Presidential Primaries in 2008. Chelsea went to gay bars to solicit support for her mother, against Senator Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nI can remember when the late Texas governor Ann Richards, when she was campaigning for governor of Texas (she was State Treasurer) made several visits to Austin and Houston gay bars to ask for votes.\n\nThis is nothing new. Politicians try to get votes from any and all voters, no matter what."
