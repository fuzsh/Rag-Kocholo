        "text": "What might have the Chelsea Clinton wedding cost? Take a wild guess or google or, better, read.\n\nWhat might have the Chelsea Clinton wedding cost? Take a wild guess or google or, better, read.\n\nChelsea Clinton, only daughter of former US President Bill Clinton and current US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, married Marc Mezvinsky on 31 July at Astor Courts, a 50-acre Rhinebeck estate that is now up for sale for $12 million. Chelsea was attired in a Vera Wang gown, which, Daily News said, was ‘a classic A-line strapless gown made of silk organza with a tulle bodice draped on the bias. All the froth was weighted with a beaded belt. For a rustic touch, the silk organza skirt was layered and raw at the edges, crafted with a trendy technique called laser cutting.’ Marc, a 32-year-old investment banker for G3 Capital, wore a simpler Burberry tuxedo.\n\nA rabbi and a Methodist minister officiated the wedding, which cost some $2-5 million. While the event was mostly celeb-free, a no-fly rule was brought into effect for half a day due to ‘VIP movement’ in the area, and blockades were in place too, which inconvenienced another wedding. Over $200,000 was reportedly spent on security.\n\nSuppliers were prohibited from talking about the wedding. One of Chelsea’s ex-boyfriends attended. But another, who her parents were so fond of that they hosted him for his book launch after he broke up with Chelsea, was not around.\n\nThe bride’s father looked slimmer. Clinton had lost over 15 pounds after his daughter issued a threat. He ate cabbage soup, according to Daily Mirror. The groom’s father, the controversial Ed Mezvinsky—a former Congressman who was earlier jailed for five years for fraud involving $10 million—did the hora (a dance in Israel) with his wife Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was not invited."
