        "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter has married her long-time boyfriend in the picturesque New York village of Rhinebeck in what has been dubbed America's royal wedding.\n\nChelsea Clinton - the only child of the former United States president and the US secretary of state - wed Marc Mezvinsky at Astor Courts - a historic 20-hectare estate on the Hudson River, about 160 kilometres north of New York City.\n\n\"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends,\" Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement.\n\n\"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family.\n\n\"On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day.\"\n\nThe statement, sent just after 7:30pm (local time), did not indicate exactly when the nuptials took place.\n\nOn Friday night, Bill and Hillary Clinton waved to crowds of onlookers as they arrived at Beekman Arms Inn in Rhinebeck for a late-night cocktail party for some of the wedding guests.\n\nApart from the parents of the bride, the only other high profile guests seen in Rhinebeck have been Bill Clinton's former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen and fashion designer Vera Wang.\n\nThe guest list was reported to be between 400 and 500 people, but did not include a very understanding president Barack Obama.\n\n\"Hillary and Bill properly want to keep this as a thing for Chelsea and her soon-to-be husband,\" Mr Obama said on The View talk show on Thursday.\n\n\"It would be tough enough to have one president at a wedding. You don't want two presidents.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton, 30, and Mezvinsky, 32, have known each other since they were teenagers.\n\nMezvinsky is an investment banker, whose parents Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky were once Democratic US House of Representatives members."
