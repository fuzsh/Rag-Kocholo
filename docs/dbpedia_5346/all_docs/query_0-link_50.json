        "text": "There's a new member of the Clinton family — just in time for Father's Day.\n\nChelsea Clinton, daughter of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, announced Saturday she had given birth to a boy named Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky.\n\n\"Marc and I are overwhelmed with gratitude and love as we celebrate the birth of our son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky,\" Chelsea, 36, tweeted Saturday morning.\n\nAidan is the second child for Chelsea and Marc Mezvinsky, an investment banker. Their first, a daughter named Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born on Sept. 27, 2014.\n\nHillary Clinton had no public events Thursday or Friday, and has none on the calendar for this weekend, either. Her daughter, who lives in New York, stopped traveling far distances for the campaign about a month ago, but was still appearing at fundraisers in New Jersey before the state's primary on June 7.\n\nHillary Clinton frequently mentions her granddaughter, Charlotte, at campaign stops, often saying, \"FaceTime was invented for grandparents.\"\n\nAt an event in Santa Barbara, California, earlier this month, she said becoming a grandparent is \"truly like falling in love all over again.\"\n\n\"I just adore children. But until it happened to me, I just could not understand the impact. It is truly like falling in love all over again. There is nothing like it. And to see your child, whether it is a daughter or a son, become a parent, is so incredible,\" she said.\n\nHillary and Bill Clinton said in a statement Saturday that they were \"overjoyed to be grandparents again.\"\n\n\"We are all over the moon as Chelsea and Marc welcome Charlotte's little brother to the world and grateful for our many blessings. Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together,\" they said.\n\nChelsea is the vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit her father started to improve health and wellness around the world.\n\nShe generally keeps her family life private. Last September, she posted a rare photo of Charlotte on her first birthday, writing:, \"Marc & I are so grateful every day to be her parents.\"\n\nChelsea married Marc Mezvinsky in 2010. Hillary made no secret of her desire to become a grandmother after they wed, and was open about wanting more grandkids, too.\n\n\"We thought maybe we'd have a little bit more time, but she already talks about wanting more grandchildren,\" Chelsea Clinton told TODAY last September.\n\nHillary isn't the only candidate to welcome a new grandchild while on the campaign trail: presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump had her third child in March."
