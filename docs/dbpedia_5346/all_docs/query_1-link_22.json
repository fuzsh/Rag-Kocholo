WikiLeaks has released more than 50,000 of the stolen emails over the past month.\n\nHe also complained in other emails that Chelsea Clinton had divulged potentially damaging information to an unnamed member of the Bush family.\n\nThe new emails have no connection to the investigation into whether Hillary Clinton improperly used a private server for her emails during her time as secretary of state.\n\nFBI chief James Comey rocked the presidential race 10 days ago when he announced that he was examining thousands more emails uncovered in yet another separate probe of disgraced ex-congressman Anthony Weiner. Comey conceded Sunday that the new trove did not affect his decision that there was nothing criminal in Clinton’s actions."
