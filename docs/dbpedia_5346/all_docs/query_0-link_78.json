        "text": "Wikileaks has been releasing hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign boss. What do they say?\n\nThe anti-secrecy website says it will release tens of thousands more emails between now and election day.\n\nClinton campaign chairman John Podesta, whose emails were hacked, has claimed the Russian government was behind the leak and the Trump campaign knew about it in advance.\n\nHe has refused to confirm or deny the emails' authenticity, suggesting some could have been doctored, without so far pinpointing any of the correspondence as fake.\n\nThese messages are different from the other Clinton email controversy, when she was found to have and broken government rules by exclusively operating a private server from her upstate New York home while secretary of state.\n\nEmail leak shows Clinton aides infighting\n\nWhy the US fears Russia hacking the election\n\nSo what has the Wikileaks dump told us?\n\nIn a 12-page memo, external written by Doug Band, a longtime aide to Bill Clinton, he describes using his consulting firm to raise money for the Clinton Global Initiative as well as direct personal income for the former president.\n\nMr Band rallied clients of his firm, Teneo, to contribute directly to Mr Clinton for \"in-kind services for the President and his family - for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like\" referring to that fund as \"Bill Clinton Inc\".\n\nSeveral companies directly paid the former president for his speeches or advice, as well as making contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative. Republicans have criticised this, saying it allowed corporations to pay for access to the former president.\n\nOne client, Coca Cola, received a face-to-face meeting with the former president at his home in 2009, after contributing millions to the non-profit foundation.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted a link, external to the Washington Post article about this with his anti-corruption mantra #DrainTheSwamp\n\nOn the same day that news of a private email server broke, John Podesta, who later became her campaign chairman, emailed Neera Tanden, who worked for the Clinton campaign in 2008 and has remained a close adviser, to complain about Mrs Clinton's \"instincts\".\n\n\"We've taken on a lot of water that won't be easy to pump out of the boat\", he wrote in September 2015 as Clinton staff feared that Vice President Joe Biden would join the Democratic primary race.\n\n\"Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts,\" he wrote, to which Mrs Tanden responded: \"Almost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.\"\n\nIn the email exchange, Mr Podesta also complained that Clinton's personal lawyer David Kendall, and former State Department staffers Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines \"sure weren't forthcoming here on the facts here\". Mrs Tanden responds \"Why didn't' they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.\"\n\nShe later answered her own question saying, \"I guess I know the answer. They wanted to get away with it.\"\n\nWhen President Barack Obama told an interviewer that he first learned of Mrs Clinton's private email server at the \"same time everybody else learned it, through news reports\", the Clinton campaign emailed each other to say that the president was not telling the truth.\n\nThe evening after the interview aired Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin emailed, external to say \"it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news\".\n\n\"We need to clean this up\", Clinton's former chief of staff Cheryl Mills responds.\n\n\"He has emails from her - they do not say state.gov\", she wrote, implying that Mr Obama was aware that Clinton was using a private email server rather than her State Department-issued email account.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest later clarified to say that the president had exchanged emails with Clinton but that he \"was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up\".\n\nMrs Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, usually known for her unflinching loyalty, was blunt in her criticism of her boss over a Clinton Foundation summit in Morocco.\n\nAt the time of the meeting in Marrakesh, in May 2015, Mrs Clinton was no longer secretary of state but about to announce her campaign for president. But four months before it took place, Abedin voiced concern about her pulling out. \"If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter,\" she warned. \"She created this mess and she knows it.\"\n\nThe implication from the leaked emails is that a $12m donation from the king of Morocco was dependent on Mrs Clinton attending the summit.\n\n\"Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,\" Abedin wrote to campaign manager Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email.\n\nIn the end, Mrs Clinton decided not to attend and sent husband Bill and daughter Chelsea instead. There is no record of a $12m donation.\n\nMr Mook on Sunday said there was no evidence of wrongdoing or \"quid pro quo\", and that his emails with Abedin showed he simply did not want any scheduling distractions for Mrs Clinton.\n\nThe Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to a month later, so as to make it less likely that a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries.\n\n\"The Clintons won't forget what their friends have done for them,\" future Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the November 2014 email to Mr Podesta.\n\nBut Mr Mook said the vote would be difficult to reschedule because Illinois Democrats \"feel forgotten and neglected by POTUS\", a reference to President Obama.\n\nThe primary was ultimately held on its original date, 15 March this year.\n\nAccording to the latest leaked emails, Mrs Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria.\n\nShe made the remark in answer to a question from Lloyd Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, in 2013 months after she left office as secretary of state.\n\n\"My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,\" she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech.\n\nMrs Clinton - who is accused of being a war hawk by liberal critics - added: \"We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves.\n\n\"They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it.\"\n\nMrs Clinton said in emails that she had told Chinese officials if they were not able or willing to control North Korea's aggression then the US would be forced to put up missile defences in the region.\n\n\"So China, come on. You either control them or we're going to have to defend against them,\" she purportedly told a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013.\n\nShe also remarked that the US would send additional warships to the region to counter the North Korean missile threat.\n\nAs secretary of state, Mrs Clinton visited China seven times and helped develop Washington's \"pivot\" to Asia, which has long been viewed with suspicion by Beijing.\n\nA 2011 exchange between Mrs Clinton's now-communications director Jennifer Palmieri and liberal think tank fellow John Halpin mocked a magazine article describing media mogul Rupert Murdoch raising his children as Catholics.\n\nMr Halpin, a self-described Catholic, writes that many of the \"most powerful elements of the conservative movement are Catholics... they must be attracted to the systematic thought and [severely] backwards gender relations\", adding that \"it's an amazing bastardisation of the faith\".\n\nMs Palmieri responds that those people must think it is \"the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion\". Ms Palmieri recently said she doesn't recognise the emails, external, adding that \"I'm a Catholic\".\n\nIn excerpts from one of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street bankers, she said: \"Politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be.\n\n\"But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\"\n\nShe introduced this comment by saying that she had just watched Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln, which shows the political negotiations the US Civil War-era president undertook to pass the 13th amendment to the US constitution, abolishing slavery.\n\nBernie Sanders, who campaigned against Mrs Clinton during the Democratic primary season, had called repeatedly for Mrs Clinton to release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches.\n\nDonna Brazile, the former CNN contributor, notified the Clinton campaign in advance of a question she would be asked at a town hall-style event hosted by the cable network in March, according to the leaked emails.\n\n\"From time to time I get the questions in advance,\" Ms Brazile, now chair of the Democratic National Party (DNC), wrote in the subject line of a 12 March email to Clinton aides.\n\nShe went on to paste the text of a question about the death penalty that Mrs Clinton would be asked. The question, with very similar wording, ended up being posed to the White House hopeful at the event.\n\nHours after WikiLeaks broke the news of the alleged collaboration, Ms Brazile wrote in an statement: \"I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.\"\n\nThe leaked email has also caused embarrassment for CNN, which Donald Trump has mockingly referred to as the \"Clinton News Network\".\n\nMs Brazile took over at the DNC when its former chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz over hacked emails which revealed the party establishment's favouritism towards Mrs Clinton.\n\nThe DNC was meant to be neutral in the contest between Mrs Clinton and her Democratic primary season challenger, Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhile serving as DNC vice-chair in January 2016, Ms Brazile forwarded to Clinton's staff an email revealing the Sanders camp's plan to court African-American voters.\n\n\"FYI,\" Ms Brazile wrote to campaign spokesperson Adrienne Elrod, who responded: \"Thank you for the heads up on this Donna.\"\n\nIn a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Mrs Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey \"can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees\".\n\nTrump supporters seized on these remarks to criticise her call for the US to accept 65,000 refugees per year, an increase on President Obama's plan to allow 10,000 per year.\n\nMany refugees from Syria transit through Jordan, Turkey, or Lebanon on their way to the West.\n\nDonald Trump has called for a ban on all Muslim immigration, but said in the second debate his plan had \"morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world\".\n\nMrs Clinton's newfound opposition to trade deals contradicts remarks she made in a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau.\n\nShe said: \"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\"\n\nCritics seized upon those remarks, pointing to Mr Trump's frequent talking point that \"without a border, we just don't have a country\".\n\nMrs Clinton reportedly earned over $26m, external for speeches she gave after leaving the State Department.\n\nSeveral Clinton aides discuss what political opinion their candidate should take on the controversial energy pipeline known as Keystone XL.\n\nIn May 2015 Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook pointed to a report that the Clinton Foundation had received money from one of the project's backers, emailing that \"the enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone?\"\n\nHe also asks if they should wait until after President Obama vetoes the pipeline, which he did in November 2015. Mrs Clinton announced her opposition in September.\n\nWhen she was asked in 2010 about when the pipeline would be approved, the then-secretary of state said the analysis was not yet complete, \"but we are inclined\" to approve the project.\n\nCritics said her subsequent opposition to the pipeline was a \"flip flop\".\n\nDoug Band, a long-time personal aide to Bill Clinton, complained that Chelsea Clinton was meddling in his consulting firm, where the former president served as a paid adviser, and also interfering with his work at the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn a 2011 email, he wrote \"she is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life\".\n\nChelsea Clinton, 36, had recently taken a role at the Clinton Foundation, and had complained in emails that Mr Band's consultancy was contacting members of the British Parliament \"on behalf of President Clinton\".\n\nThat's the subject line of an August 2015 email sent by Mr Podesta to Hillary Clinton and one her closest aides, Huma Abedin.\n\nMr Podesta's email suggests that Mrs Clinton reach out to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and former Energy Secretary Federico Pena to ask for their support during her primary campaign.\n\nMr Podesta also uses a profane term to refer to Gov Richardson, who had implied in an earlier email that he would require a phone call in order to provide his support."
