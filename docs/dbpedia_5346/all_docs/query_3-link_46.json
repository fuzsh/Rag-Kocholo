        "text": "Hillary Clinton will have one more grandchild to brag about on the campaign trail in the run-up to November. Chelsea Clinton, announced on Saturday via Twitter and Facebook that she had given birth to her second child. “Marc and I are overwhelmed with gratitude and love as we celebrate the birth of our son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky,” she wrote. Clinton and husband Marc Mezvinsky had their first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, in September 2014.\n\nCharlotte has yet to make an appearance on the campaign trail but Clinton has not been shy about publicly rejoicing in her role as grandmother. “Until it happened to me, I just could not understand the impact,” Clinton said at an event in California earlier this month. “It is truly like falling in love all over again. There is nothing like it.” Clinton also often talks about how “FaceTime was invented for grandparents,” saying she makes a point of keeping up with her granddaughter despite the hectic campaign schedule.\n\n“We are overjoyed to be grandparents again with the arrival of our grandson, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, born on Saturday, June 18, 2016,” Hillary and Bill Clinton said in a statement. “We are all over the moon as Chelsea and Marc welcome Charlotte’s little brother to the world and grateful for our many blessings. Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together.”"
