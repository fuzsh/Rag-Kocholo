        "text": "Chelsea Clinton married her longtime boyfriend Saturday night at an exclusive estate along New York's Hudson River.\n\nBill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced in a statement that their daughter wed investment banker Marc Mezvinsky after weeks of secrecy and buildup that had celebrity watchers flocking to the small village of Rhinebeck for the evening nuptials.\n\n\"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends,\" the Clintons said.\n\n\"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton, wearing a strapless white gown with a full skirt and silver beading around the waist and carrying a bouquet of white flowers, was escorted down the aisle by her father. The former president and the groom wore dark suits, while the mother of the bride wore a fuchsia dress.\n\nIt is estimated that hundreds of guests gathered at the historic estate near the end of a near-perfect summer day of warm temperatures, blue skies and cottony clouds. The ceremony was conducted by a rabbi and a reverend as Chelsea Clinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewish, and included a poem by Leo Marks titled, The Life That I Have, according to the family.\n\nDetails of the wedding were kept fanatically close to the vest, with shopkeepers, innkeepers, vendors and restaurateurs sworn to secrecy.\n\nThe wedding took place at Astor Courts, a secluded estate along the Hudson River built as a Beaux Arts style playground for John Jacob Astor IV more than a century ago. The estate features 20 hectares of buffer space to shield the party from prying eyes and the sort of commanding view that once inspired Hudson River School painters.\n\nOfficials restricted airspace over the estate, and the area will remain a no-fly zone until 3:30 a.m. local time Sunday. Roads were also blocked off and inconvenienced neighbours were soothed with a complimentary bottle of wine.\n\nSome of the celebrities spotted in Rhinebeck for the event included actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, fashion designer Vera Wang and Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state during Bill Clinton's second term as president.\n\nShortly before 5 p.m., dozens of men in black-tie attire and women in gowns boarded shuttle buses in the village for the short ride to the estate.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a motorcade of three black SUVs and a sedan sped through the checkpoint on the road that leads to the historic estate.\n\nChelsea Clinton and Mezvinsky were friends as teenagers in Washington, and both attended Stanford University. They now live in New York, where Mezvinsky works at G3 Capital, a Manhattan hedge fund. He worked previously at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker.\n\nClinton completed her master's degree in public health this year at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nMezvinsky is a son of former U.S. representatives Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania and Ed Mezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons. His parents are divorced."
