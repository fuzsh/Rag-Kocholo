        "text": "In case your invite to Chelsea Clinton's wedding got lost in the mail, don't feel bad. Same thing must have happened to ours.\n\nBut last weekend's interfaith wedding of the former first daughter (who married a Jewish Wall Street investment banker) and the 2009 wedding of Ivanka Trump (who converted to Judaism for her husband) got us to thinking about the challenges that these - and other - couples face when merging their divergent religious beliefs.\n\nRabbi Sheldon Harr, of Temple Kol Ami Emanu-El in Plantation, and Cantor Debra Ballard, of mypersonalcantor.com, are well-versed in officiating interfaith weddings and counseling interfaith couples.\n\nHarr attended Cincinnati Hebrew Union College with Rabbi Jim Ponet, who co-officiated at Clinton's wedding. He explains that only Reform rabbis will even consider partaking in an interfaith wedding. \"I'd estimate 50 percent at most would be comfortable doing it,\" Harr says.\n\nOrthodox rabbis, Harr says, \"are strictly bound by Jewish law\" and thus forbidden from sanctioning interfaith coupling; Conservative ones \"try to straddle the fence between Reform and Orthodox\" and also are disallowed from being involved in such ceremonies.\n\n\"Even for a Reform rabbi, it's a highly personal decision,\" Harr says - one that he makes only after much introspection.\n\n\"I have certain strictures that the couple must adhere to in order for me to officiate an interfaith wedding,\" Harr says. They include the non-Jewish party taking an \"introduction to Judaism\" class for 15 weeks - \"not to be coerced into converting, but rather so that he or she is exposed to our beliefs,\" Harr says.\n\nKey issue: Kids' religion\n\nIn addition, the couple must participate in private counseling sessions with Harr and, perhaps most important, \"must agree to raise their children Jewish,\" he says.\n\nAt the ceremony, Harr recognizes the \"need to be sensitive to the non-Jewish attendees.\" That's why Harr makes a point of being more explanatory about certain rites, as well as \"changing a few Hebrew words during certain prayers.\"\n\nHowever, unlike his former classmate Ponet, Harr wouldn't have agreed to do one thing at Clinton's wedding: \"I won't co-officiate an interfaith wedding with a clergyman of another religion.\"\n\nBallard, a cantor raised in a strictly Conservative Jewish home, knows about the rewards and challenges of interfaith marriage: \"I was in one for 17 years,\" says the mother of two adult children.\n\nIf Reform rabbis such as Harr brought Judaism into the 20th century, Ballard, who's trained in musically leading prayer, has an all-inclusive approach for the new millennium.\n\n\"Diversity in our population has made us a mostly secular society. Therefore, it's more likely than ever that you'll meet and fall in love with a person of a different faith,\" Ballard says.\n\nBallard's Judaism is the foundation of her religious beliefs - and professional approach - but she incorporates aspects of all religions into her work.\n\n\"As long as it helps people feel warm and good, I'm all for it,\" she says.\n\nAnticipating challenges\n\nWhen officiating interfaith weddings, Ballard has a simple, overriding goal: \"I want us to celebrate what unites us - and not concentrate on what divides us.\"\n\nTo that end, Ballard is open to incorporating almost all aspects of other religions into her interfaith ceremonies. \"The New Testament, the Lord's Prayer - I've done them all,\" Ballard says.\n\nIn fact, there's only one thing Ballard won't do: \"Invoke the name 'Jesus Christ.' I'm afraid we can't invite him,\" she says gently and without a trace of hostility.\n\nBallard advises couples to \"not impose anything on each other and anticipate the challenges of an interfaith marriage.\"\n\nThis includes seemingly mundane matters such as what, if any, religious articles will be displayed in the home. Ballard's experience has been that \"the real problems don't arise until that first child is born - unless they've been hashed out ahead of time.\"\n\nAnd while she's not insistent that interfaith children be raised Jewish, she's adamant that \"parents must pick a single religion for their children. It's not healthy or fair to make it the child's choice.\""
