        "text": "It's official…Chelsea Clinton's hitched! Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement saying their daughter officially wed her long-time beau, Marc Mezvinsky, in front of 400 family members and friends in a ceremony at the Astor Courts Estate in Rhinebeck, N.Y. July 31. We've already dished about the dress, so here are 14 more things you need to know about the new Mrs. Mezvinsky's lavish wedding:\n\nGuests had to wear special wristbands to board the bus to the ceremony and reception, which went until 4:30 am. They were forced to hand over cameras and cell phones for the evening to ensure no photos were taken.\n\nThe star-studded guest list included Mary Steenburgen, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (who was reportedly last to leave the dance floor!), actor Ted Danson, film producer Steven Bing, and a handful of congressmen and other prominent Democrats, reports People. Chelsea's dress designer, Vera Wang, was also in attendance as were Burberry designer Christopher Bailey and Tribeca Film Festival head Jane Rosenthal.\n\nBill, as had been mentioned, did indeed lose the weight his daughter asked him to, shedding what some say is as much as 25 pounds.\n\nHillary was in one of her favorites, Oscar de la Renta, and DC hairdresser Isabelle Goetz did her softer and blonder locks for the evening. Her dress is estimated to have cost around $15,000.\n\nAs for the men, they all wore Burberry. In following with tradition, Marc wore a tallit (Jewish prayer shawl) and yarmulke. Two of Marc's brothers, Andrew \"Drew\" Mezvinsky and Vu Pham were his best men.\n\nThe interfaith ceremony was conducted by Rabbi James Ponet and the Reverend William Shillady. Chelsea is Methodist and Marc is Jewish. The flower covered chuppah (the traditional tent under which they were married) is estimated to have cost between $35,000 and $45,000.\n\nBill gave a toast saying that ever since his daughter had been old enough to formulate a thought, he had \"been outnumbered\" in his household, two to one. Now, with a son-in-law, he said, \"the playing field is even. I have someone else on my side.\" Marc also gave an emotional speech about his love for Chelsea and at the end looked directly into her eyes ignoring the rest of the room. Even Bill was brought to tears.\n\nOne guest told the New York Post, that for the first dance, Chelsea and her dad danced to the Frank Sinatra ballad \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" noting that the former president was \"teary-eyed\" throughout the dance. Chelsea and new husband Marc meanwhile took to the floor and performed a choreographed version of \"At Last.\"\n\nThe dinner, catered by the St. Regis Hotel in New York, included short ribs, Atlantic char, a vegetarian option, and gluten-free rolls.\n\nThe vegan cake from La Tulipe Desserts in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. was apparently chocolate, though an actual photo has yet to be released of the creation. It was 11 tiers and is said to have cost around $11,000.\n\nThe flowers were roses and hydrangeas, in a purple/pink/blue color, and were designed by Jeff Leatham, artistic director of Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris.\n\nGuests walked away with a gift bag that included a bottle of wine from the nearby Clinton Vineyards as well as a box of chocolates, pastries from the local Wild Hive Farm Store, and Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment.\n\nGuests attended a family style brunch Sunday morning before heading out of the scenic town.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that the newlyweds spent the night at The Pierre hotel in New York City on Sunday night before departing for their honeymoon.\n\nCould this wedding have been more luxe?
