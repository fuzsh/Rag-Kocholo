        "text": "Chelsea Clinton has eyes on an ambassadorship if Kamala Harris becomes president, according to sources.\n\n“Chelsea really wants to be the ambassador to the UK,” said a Clinton source. “There’s a reason why Bill and Hillary came out in the first five minutes to support Kamala’s presidential bid — they were currying favor.”\n\nThe source said the Clintons have been “working on this idea for a long time.”\n\nThe former first daughter, who is vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, would also love a gig in France, the source said.\n\n“I can well imagine that the UK ambassadorship is an aspiration for Chelsea, although she is a bit junior still — and London usually goes to a massive donor or fundraiser,” a longtime British embassy official, now based in London, told The Post.\n\nAdded the Clinton source of Chelsea’s UK dream: “It is, of course, fantasy land.”\n\nAnother person in the know noted that Chelsea, 44, would be open to ambassadorships in other countries, adding, “I’ve heard for a long time that Chelsea has been hopeful for an ambassadorship.”\n\nBusinesswoman Jane Hartley, 74, has been the ambassador to the UK since 2022, after Michael Bloomberg reportedly turned it down. She was formerly ambassador to France and Monaco during the Obama administration and has been a major campaign “bundler” for the Democratic party, reportedly helping raise a half-million dollars for Obama.\n\nUnder Trump, the UK position was held by New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who was a top Republican fundraiser during the 2016 campaign.\n\n“Foreign countries love high-profile people as ambassadors because it brings them more attention,” the person in the know said. “They would rather have someone more famous and less rich.”\n\nChelsea, 44, who has three young children with husband Marc Mezvinsky, does have ties to the UK.\n\nLike her father, she attended Oxford University. She got her Master of Philosophy degree in international relations at the prestigious school in 2003, followed by a doctorate degree in 2014.\n\n“She is 44 and has a long-held ambition for this. It’s important for her to have her own legacy,” the person in the know said. “She has always wanted to spend more time abroad, much like Caroline Kennedy” — who is the current ambassador to Australia and was ambassador to Japan under Obama.\n\nAs for the suggestion that Bill and Hillary Clinton endorsed Harris quickly to curry favor for Chelsea, a rep for Hillary told The Post, “Among stupid things said by clueless people, that’s pretty high up there.”\n\nA longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton also denied the couple endorsed Harris for any reason other than defeating Donald Trump.\n\nA rep for Chelsea added: “There is no truth here. Chelsea is proud to support Vice President Harris and is committed to doing everything she can to ensure she is elected in November.”\n\nThe Foreign Office source confirmed there is a “lot of competition” for ambassador roles in England and France.\n\nHowever, with her background, the person in the know noted, Chelsea could do good work in South Africa. “She cares so deeply about public health. South Africa is high profile enough and highly sought after.”"
