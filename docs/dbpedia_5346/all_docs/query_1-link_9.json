        "text": "On a cold night in late February, Marc Mezvinsky made sure no expense was spared to celebrate his beloved’s 30th birthday. Nearly 70 of Chelsea Clinton’s friends — plus her political rock-star parents — ventured out to Mari Vanna, an upscale Russian bistro near the couple’s place in the Flatiron District. Bill, Hillary and the rest of the crowd filled up the cozy space, noshing on an elaborate spread of caviar, pierogi, oysters and infused-vodka cocktails.\n\n“We had to cancel all of the prior reservations, almost 200 of them,” says Tatiana Brunetti, a partner at the restaurant, who adores the couple and worked with Marc to organize the event. “He threw the party, and paid for it. I think that makes the best gift!”\n\nChelsea and Marc are regulars at the Russian-kitsch eatery, where they’ll often linger for hours at the corner table, deep in conversation, either with friends or on their own. “You see the chemistry between them,” says Brunetti. “They have a lot of things to talk about. They’re very intelligent, both of them. You can tell they have a great relationship. They seem perfect for each other.”\n\nPHOTOS: CHELSEA CLINTON & MARC MEZVINSKY\n\nThey say girls always marry their fathers, but Chelsea’s bucking the trend: She’s settling down with a nice Jewish boy who brings home the bacon and lives a quiet life in New York. She and Marc have been friends since they were teens; they share lots in common — not least, their dads’ political scandals — and by all accounts, they’re poised for a successful marriage. “I think she’s found true love,” says a close Clinton observer.\n\nIn what many are calling “the wedding of the century,” the former first daughter will marry Marc, 32, who grew up in suburban Philadelphia and is one of 11 children of two former members of Congress. The couple will marry at the John Jacob Astor estate in upstate New York on July 31. Social observers, political wonks and old-fashioned romantics are claiming it is the closest event the United States will have to a royal wedding.\n\nBut there’s a darker side to the connection between the couple — they’ve bonded over the very public misdeeds of their political dads. “I think the scandals involving Marc’s father, and the scandals involving the Clintons, gave them a kind of connection,” says the Clinton observer. “They both grew up with those dark clouds that hung over them.”\n\nThe couple first met in 1993 at Renaissance Weekend, a Democratic networking retreat in Hilton Head, SC. Their parents were already friendly — Marc’s mom, a U.S. Congresswoman from Montgomery County in Pennsylvania, cast the vote that pushed Bill Clinton’s hotly debated tax package through the House of Representatives. When the two reuinited there three years later, a photo of the two shows a bookishly handsome Marc next to a plainly adoring 16-year-old Chelsea, who looks as if she might be nursing a crush.\n\nThe following year, she was a senior at Sidwell Friends HS in DC, when her tour of Stanford University led to a reunion, as he was already a sophomore there. Marc appointed himself Chelsea’s official guide to the university in Palo Alto, even bringing her to a frat party.\n\nChelsea enrolled at Stanford, and she and Marc were friendly there, a pal of the couple’s says, but they didn’t date or even see that much of one another. She was busy pursuing a degree in history, while Marc got a degree in religious studies and philosophy.\n\nAfter graduating, Chelsea went to Oxford University in 2002 to study international relations, and to transition out of her awkward phase. She started blowing out her corkscrew curls, attended a Versace fashion show in London, and for the first time in her life, was actually seen as a bit of a rebel. When she posed for photos for Vanity Fair without her parents’ permission, she remarked, “I’m a big girl.”\n\nWhile at Oxford, she also met her first serious boyfriend, Ian Klaus, who was a Rhodes Scholar there. Like Mezvinsky, he’s a dark-haired, bespectacled athletic type with academic chops.\n\nIn 2003, she and Klaus both moved to New York, with Chelsea taking a job at McKinsey and Co., a management consulting firm, where — for a reported $120,000 salary — her focus was health care. She and Klaus were together for two more years; when the relationship ended, witnesses reported a rare sighting of a drunken Chelsea being helped out of Marquee after drowning her sorrows.\n\nMarc, meanwhile, was also in NYC, working as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. He reappeared on Chelsea’s radar after her breakup with Klaus, and the new couple started popping up around town. Their first formal appearance as an item was at Tao nightclub in Las Vegas in October 2005, although they had been spending time together before then, friends say.\n\nSince the official outing, the whip-smart, geeky-cute couple has become a regular fixture around New York. You’ll catch them brunching at the Nolita Lounge, having cocktails at Meatpacking club Avenue and dining at Flatiron restaurant Bar Breton. Marc now works at 3G Capital Management, a hedge fund, while Chelsea’s at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, enrolled in a master’s program in health policy and management.\n\nLike Bill and Hillary, the two share a love of impassioned debate. Friends say they enjoy nothing more than arguing about obscure facts and then looking up the answers to prove who’s right. They’re both big shoppers — at least when it comes to reading material. A friend of the couple says that they’ll go into a bookstore and come out loaded down with tomes “on everything from foreign policy to mineralogy.” They even named their tiny dog, Soren, after Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.\n\nWhen they’re not busy conquering the world, Marc likes to stick close to home in the $3.8 million Flatiron apartment he bought in 2008. She, meanwhile, has turned into a bona fide social butterfly, honing a talent for working a room clearly woven into her DNA. The two balance each other out, and friends say they are cute and affectionate together.\n\nBut the unique experience the two share is their dads’ dramatic political downfalls. Bill Clinton, despite the legacy of his presidential achievements and global charity work, will forever be dogged by the twin 1990s scandals of “Lewinsky” and “Whitewater.”\n\nMeanwhile, Marc’s father, Edward Mezvinsky, was embroiled in a much more bizarre, and overtly criminal, scandal. From 1995 to 2000, the former Iowa Congressman was both a perpetrator and a victim of large-scale Internet fraud. Shockingly, Edward was suckered by a Nigerian e-mail scam that offered big cash returns to investors willing to lend immediate funds. (His crazy entanglement even led to a shady Chicago warehouse and a wooden chest full of fake money.) At the same time, Edward was scamming friends and colleagues with his own promises of get-rich-quick investments.\n\nBut perhaps most damaging for his son was Edward’s habit of dropping the Clintons’ names as he bilked friends, family and supporters out of millions of dollars.\n\nIn 2003, the ex-congressman was sentenced to 80 months in prison for 66 counts of bank, wire and mail fraud, despite his insanity plea. He was released in April 2008.\n\nEven though Marc seemed like an upstanding guy, some posited that Hillary disapproved of her daughter’s new boyfriend due to his convict dad. But Bill has always seemed supportive, and in photos is shown being affectionate with his future son-in-law.\n\nBy all accounts, Marc is a mensch. According to restaurant manager Brunetti: “He’s the type of guy who will open the door of the car when you get out. Not many guys still do that!” Known for being confident with a snappy sense of humor, he pulls down a hefty salary at 3G Capital. He’s conservative Jewish, but not overly so; he won’t expect Chelsea to keep kosher.\n\nWhile Marc remains youthfully dashing — wavy hair, glasses, lanky frame — Chelsea’s look has undergone a notable evolution since she met her fiancé 14 years ago. Her hair is now tinted golden, and where she used to hide in baggy clothing, she now chooses pieces with clean lines that accentuate her lean, athletic figure.\n\nShe’s a longtime regular at downtown spin studio Soul Cycle, says a founder. “I remember when Chelsea took my class for the first time,” says Ruth Zukerman, current owner of Flywheel studio. “She quickly started coming five to six times a week. She is incredibly focused and determined. She got leaner and more defined and looked great.”\n\nIn some ways, Chelsea and Marc are like any other modern couple. Their engagement announcement, for example, arrived not on expensive paper, but online: “We’re sorry for the mass e-mail,” they wrote to friends and family, “but we wanted to wish everyone a belated Happy Thanksgiving! We also wanted to share that we are engaged!” The sizable diamond engagement ring didn’t appear until April, when Chelsea wore it out to a performance of — appropriately enough — the musical “Promises, Promises.”\n\nOver the past months, prenuptial activities have been ramping up. Chelsea has been attending the occasional Shabbat dinner to learn more about Marc’s religion, and accompanied him to services at the Jewish Theological Seminary on the Upper West Side last year. A friend says she’s continued to go to temple with him now and then, although she’s not likely to convert. (Chelsea’s parents are Methodists, as she officially is, as well.)\n\nThere hasn’t been any word on whether Edward Mezvinsky, two years out of prison, will attend the wedding. But, unsurprisingly, Bill and Hillary have been hands-on with the preparations, micromanaging the guest list (and possibly the flower arrangements, which Hillary has reportedly been perusing on her BlackBerry in between negotiating treaties).\n\n“Hillary is totally overbearing, and so is Bill,” says the Clinton observer. “They’re control freaks, and that’s why the issue came up with them wanting to have a lot of say on who’s on the guest list.” Chelsea put her foot down, saying everyone invited had to be someone she personally knew — though, given the names emerging now, like Oprah and Steven Spielberg, one wonders how successful she really was.\n\nOnce married, perhaps Marc and Chelsea will be able to escape the shadow of their parents. “They’re probably going to keep their distance,” the observer says. “I think they’ll probably feel more secure as a [married] couple.”\n\nAnd yet, an American “royal” will always have her duties. “I do know,” the observer says, “that Bill and Hillary really want to see grandkids.”\n\nThe V.I.P. guest list\n\nWho will watch President Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton give their daughter away? Despite reports that President Obama and First Lady Michelle would attend, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said yesterday that the first couple would not be among the 500 A-list guests.\n\nHowever, queen of daytime TV Oprah Winfrey reportedly will attend, as will media mogul Ted Turner, according to RadarOnline. Steven Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw are likely to be there, too, along with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and socialite Denise Rich, the Web site reported. President Clinton adviser Harold Ickes, Terry McAuliffe — campaign manager to both Bill and Hillary — and former British Prime Minister John Major are also expected to attend."
