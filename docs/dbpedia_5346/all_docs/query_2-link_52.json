        "text": "Sunday Independent\n\nJul 25 2010\n\nThe afterlives of White House children are not always happy ones. John F Kennedy Jr died tragically young in a plane crash, as did Teddy Roosevelt's son, Quentin, in World War One.\n\nFD Roosevelt's five children divorced 14 times between them. Amy Carter was arrested for protesting against the CIA, although she was later acquitted. Patti Davis was the 'Renegade Reagan', who took her mother's name as a gesture of disgust at her father's politics, smoked pot, married her yoga instructor in a fit of defiance, divorced him six years later and then posed nude for Playboy at the age of 41, before returning to the family fold.\n\nIn fact, statistics governing the outcome of former presidential children tell a story of extremes. On the one hand, they tend to become unusually high achievers, while on the other they are more like to be divorced, to die prematurely and to struggle with alcoholism. What makes the difference in outcome is how much time, and how formative were the years, they spent in the White House.\n\nGiven that Chelsea Clinton was 12 when she became the First Daughter, and spent the next eight years in that role, not to mention the hard time she seemed to have adjusting to her position, there was every chance she could have succumbed to the latter, grimmer set of stats. Instead, on the eve of her top-secret wedding to Marc Mezvinsky, the formerly awkward Chelsea has morphed into a confident young woman, glowing with health and vitality, a high-flying investment analyst-turned mature student and low-key but clever media operator.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton and Al Gore won their first term in office, in 1992, they did what American presidents and vice-presidents do -- they brought their families on stage to celebrate. On one side were the three Gore children: pretty, preppy and cheering enthusiastically. In contrast, Chelsea, sandwiched as usual between her parents, seemed gawky and unsure; chubby and toothy, with wild hair, braces and dreadful dress sense. She managed a half-wave to the crowd, followed by an agonising blush.\n\nHer underwhelming performance led Saturday Night Live to draw scathing comparisons with Gore's daughter, Sarah, and one US TV critic satirised her cruelly as 'the White House Dog'. Chelsea also had to weather the absurd, lurid rumours that Bill was not her father, that he is sterile, that Hillary is a lesbian, and that her parents have never slept together. For a girl launching into the insecurities of adolescence, Clinton's election couldn't have come at a worse time.\n\nBut Chelsea's secret weapon has always been the remarkable relationship she has with her parents. Since she was tiny, she has been the glue in their marriage; two ill-suited people held together by their love for a much-wanted child. She is the one pure and uncomplicated relationship of Bill's life and the primary emotional focus of Hillary's.\n\nIn 1988, Clinton had decided against running for office, because he felt that Chelsea, then eight, was simply too young to handle the pressure. Once he launched his bid, both Clintons prepared her well for what lay ahead -- role-playing at the dinner table in Arkansas the kind of nasty comments and slurs they could all expect -- and protected her as far as possible from the media circus once they won.\n\nOne of Hillary's priorities as First Lady was to pay a social call on Jackie Kennedy Onassis, then still the doyenne of all things White House, to ask her how best to protect Chelsea from the inevitable stress of her position. Jackie seemingly warned Hillary \"not to let adults -- no matter how well-intentioned -- become Chelsea's handmaidens\" and to \"be ruthless about keeping the public from the private\".\n\nIt was advice Hillary took to heart. In fact, she greatly outdid even Jackie in her resolute seclusion of her daughter. Not since Edith Roosevelt had any White House matron been so rigorous. Chelsea was quite simply off limits to reporters. Requests for interviews or comments, no matter how innocuous the topic, were firmly turned down.\n\nEven now, Chelsea doesn't speak to reporters. During the 2008 presidential election, during which she loyally canvassed for her mother, Chelsea was asked a question by a nine-year-old Cub reporter, which she brushed off, saying: \"I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute.\" That said, she was often the last of her mother's entourage to leave a rally, shaking hands and signing autographs to the bitter end, quietly encouraging voters: \"I hope you'll support my mom.\"\n\nHillary's determination to protect Chelsea from public exposure was a logical extension of the quite intense, even controlling, way in which she was brought up -- Hillary was a classic 'helicopter mom', hovering anxiously over her child's development, despite her own role as family breadwinner for many years. She frequently left messages at Chelsea's primary school -- \"just tell Chelsea that Mommy loves her\" -- and encouraged Chelsea to write back to her, so as to practise her language skills.\n\nShe steered Chelsea clear of any interest in make-up and clothes, instead concentrating on her intellectual abilities and sense of achievement, and wouldn't let the little girl wear Velcro-fastening shoes until she had learned to tie her own laces. She even taught Chelsea, when she was in sixth grade, the rudiments of stock market investment. And Chelsea rewarded all these efforts. She was a precocious child who turned into a steady, achieving adult, by-passing all teenage indiscretions along the way.\n\nAs far as possible, Chelsea was exposed to some version of normality during the White House years, made to tidy her own room and sweep up the popcorn after movie screenings for her friends. More important, her parents made time for her. Bill tried to breakfast with his daughter every day, and Hillary would routinely pause her own schedule for an hour or so after Chelsea came back from school to catch up with her day. In all of this, Chelsea seemed wonderfully acquiescent and biddable, passing up the temptation to sew any wild oats at all, or even indulge in the kind of innocent high jinks that would be normal for a teenage girl. She has only been seen drunk once in public, and that was after she moved to England, where she was papped staggering out of the Embassy Club in Mayfair, propped up by then boyfriend Ian Klaus.\n\nThe contrast with her successors, the Bush twins, couldn't have been more marked. Between sticking their tongues out at reporters, falling around at frat parties, posing for Vogue shoots and falling foul of the police for underage drinking, Jenna and Barbara regularly made headlines, whereas Chelsea took centre stage only ever as a result of her parents' doings.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that, for all her model behaviour, and despite her father's best efforts to lay claim to the Kennedy fairy-dust, Chelsea never captured the public imagination the way Caroline or John-John did. Her exemplary conduct earned her indifference rather than affection, probably because her initial awkwardness soon gave way to something poised and rather formal. There was no appealing vulnerability or openness with Chelsea -- the kind of thing that often gets stars such as Princess Diana into trouble, but gets them loved as well. There were no real dramas in Chelsea's life, even though she weathered one of the greatest scandals in American public life, suffered the public humiliation that being Bill Clinton's daughter brought for a time, and played a pivotal part in the unfolding of the family reconciliation. Through it all, she maintained a poise and discretion that impressed, but never affected.\n\nThe day after Clinton owned up to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, it was Chelsea who seemed to be holding her parents together, walking between them, holding hands with both, as they left for Martha's Vineyard aboard Air Force One. At the time, she was 18, a student at Stanford College, and all her parents' devoted protection seemed to have paid off in the way she handled that appalling situation.\n\nShe was, inside sources said, furious with her father, but resisted the temptation to make a bad situation worse by taking sides. Instead, she kept both parents close, supporting each in their different requirements. She took holiday time out with Hillary and accompanied Bill on his next international tour when Hillary refused to. \"Chelsea somehow separates the difficulties her parents have suffered from her relationship with them,\" said one White House correspondent. \"And if Bill had one last friend in the world, it would be Chelsea.\"\n\nEven the burden of being your father's best friend and your mother's proudest legacy (for all her protectiveness, Hillary frequently cites Chelsea as an example in her child-care book, It Takes a Village) doesn't seem too much for her. Whatever desire for revolt she may have had has been very well sublimated. At Stanford, her undergraduate thesis was her father's role in the Northern Ireland peace process. Then she followed his footsteps to Oxford, and even picked the same college. At one stage, she unveiled a sleek new bob at the Paris couture shows that was very close to Hillary's trademark style, causing one paper to dub her as her mother's 'Mini-Me'.\n\nOxford, away from the heat of the American media, was where Chelsea really started to shake off her gawky teenage self -- the neat, good 'child of her parents' she had been for so long was replaced with a version more sleekly groomed, stylish and highly social. She attended Wimbledon and Elton John's summer ball, and engaged a PA to deal with her endless invitations. Ten years after being dubbed the 'White House dog,' her metamorphosis caused Vanity Fair magazine to gush that she was \"the new John F Kennedy Jr\". Tatler, never slow to cop a new society queen, weighed in and described her as \"one of the most over-invited people today\", and put her on a list of It Girls, along with Zara Phillips and Sophie Dahl.\n\nKnown as a good conversationalist rather than a wit or raconteur, Chelsea, despite the deliberately low-key image, clearly likes to associate with celebs. Drinks with Bono, seats next to Destiny's Child, hanging out with grunge queen Courtney Love after a London show, dinner with Pierce Brosnan and his wife, Chelsea even interviewed Jake Gyllenhaal for Interview magazine and clearly feels at home in the company of others for whom the media is a constant, intrusive presence.\n\nAlong the way, there have been boyfriends, such as Klaus, fellow Oxford student, a Rhodes scholar with political interests and bouffant hair, with whom Chelsea split in 2005, because they didn't get to spend enough time together. Before that, there was Jeremy Kane, a fellow student at Stanford and a White House intern, who was so keenly political it caused Chelsea to wonder what his real interest in her was. But fiance Marc Mezvinsky, an investment banker, could just be a match made in political (and operatic) heaven.\n\nMarc and Chelsea have known each other since they were teenagers. Both went to Stanford, and Marc's mother even ended her political career -- she was elected to Congress in 1992 -- by voting for Clinton's 1993 Budget, which included a tax increase for the wealthy. Hers was the deciding vote, and this was used against her in the next election cycle, leading to her defeat.\n\nMeanwhile, Marc's father, Ed Mezvinsky, has had a career even more colourful than Clinton's. Elected to Congress from Iowa, he lost on his third bid for re-election, then moved to Pennsylvania where he tried, and failed, to make it as Senator, then attorney general and finally lieutenant governor. By early 2000, Ed's mansion had been raided by the FBI and he was charged with 69 counts of fraud. He argued mental disorder and diminished responsibility, but the court turned down his plea and sentenced the former congressman to 80 months in prison. He was released in 2008 but declared bankrupt.\n\nHe and Marjorie, who had raised 11 children, most of them adopted from overseas, then divorced. It's not exactly a mirror image of dysfunctional families, but clearly both Marc and Chelsea have experience of weathering scandals and keeping their heads high despite tumult and heartache around them.\n\nThe wedding, a fast-leaking secret, is expected to take place on Saturday in Upstate New York, with an attendance list of some 400 friends. Chelsea's stipulation, in order to get round the very many donors, advisers, acquaintances and hangers-on among her parent's entourage, is that she should have personally met every one of the guests. Bill is well on the way to losing the 15lbs that Chelsea has requested, and has said he will try his hardest not to cry -- or trip -- as he walks his daughter down the aisle, lest attention be taken away from her. The bride will wear Oscar de la Renta, while her mother, when asked which is harder, negotiating peace in the Middle East or planning her daughter's wedding, discreetly replied: \"I'd probably call it a draw.\"\n\nThere is some speculation over whether the marriage celebration will take account of both faiths -- Marc is Jewish -- or even if Chelsea will convert, unlikely as that seems for a young woman whose identity is very clearly forged.\n\nChelsea may not be 'America's Princess', despite the best efforts of Vanity Fair, but there is plenty of quiet pride in her achievements and admiration for the way in which she has steadily, gently, managed her own destiny.\n\nIf the subterranean rumours of an eventual career in politics can be believed, she may just be the best part of Bill Clinton's legacy, and an enduring testimony to her mother's principles of child-rearing. For the sake of symbolic continuity, both Bill and Hillary should walk her up the aisle, one on either side, just like the old days.\n\nhttp://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/celebrity-news-gossip/chelseas-secret-weapon-2271861.html\n\nWedding Is Talk of the Town, but Nobody’s Talking\n\nBy LISA W. FODERARO and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY\n\nPublished: July 25, 2010\n\nAs the date for Chelsea Clinton's nuptials neared, Paper Trail, a stationery shop in Rhinebeck, N.Y., displayed a wedding dress.\n\nRHINEBECK, N.Y. — This small town in the Hudson Valley is thrilled that the wedding of the year will be happening here on Saturday. Thrilled — even though no one can talk about it.\n\nIndeed, you can practically feel the shopkeepers biting their tongues, wishing they could share details of Chelsea Clinton’s wedding, which, according to wedding planners, will inspire many copycat choices among brides in the coming year.\n\nRhinebeck residents are proud that their town, two hours north of New York City, was chosen by Ms. Clinton and her fiancé, Marc Mezvinsky, and are quick to tell you that this town is not at all like the Hamptons. No Tiffany on Main Street, no weekenders in high heels. But when it comes to the wedding, talk they cannot. Anyone who has agreed to supply anything, from gift bags to appetizers to the location, signed a confidentiality agreement.\n\nWord is that the serendipitously named Clinton Vineyards, in nearby Clinton Corners, will provide some of the wine: perhaps its award-winning dessert wine called Desire, which is made from blackberries, or its raspberry wine, Embrace. A stricken-sounding employee who answered the phone at the vineyard said, “We cannot comment on anything to do with the wine and whatever is going on with that.”\n\nIra J. Gutner, who owns Samuel’s of Rhinebeck, a coffee bar that sells fine chocolates, knows people who are contributing in some way to the wedding and who have signed confidentiality agreements. But he is not divulging anything. And despite a few leaks here and there about local involvement, for the most part the agreements are being honored.\n\n“It’s her wedding, and it’s his wedding,” Mr. Gutner said. “We want to respect their confidentiality.”\n\nThe Clintons have not confirmed that the wedding is being held in Rhinebeck. But its convenient location makes it logical. For the mother of the bride, or M.O.T.B., as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has jokingly referred to herself in State Department memos, the appeal of Rhinebeck is plain. The town is 54 miles north (as the crow flies) of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., allowing for quick dashes to check on details.\n\nThe Clintons are trying hard to keep it from being a circus, and so far the people of Rhinebeck are trying to oblige. The local police have already arrested two Norwegian photographers for trespassing on the Astor Courts estate, which is assumed to be the location of the wedding.\n\nDesigned by Stanford White in 1902 for John Jacob Astor IV, it is a sumptuous Beaux-Arts house on the outskirts of town. The estate’s owners, Kathleen Hammer, a generous donor to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Arthur Seelbinder, a real estate developer, bought it in 2005 for $3.2 million and spent years on renovations. They put it up for sale last year for $12 million, but took it off the market this month. The two men arrested, Thomas Bjorn Nilsson, 43, of New York, and Kjersti Sortland, 41, of Norway, disregarded “no trespassing” signs near the gates to the property, and face 15 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $250 if found guilty, according to Maj. Michael A. Kopy of the New York State Police.\n\nResidents who live close to the presumed ceremony site have been calling the police to complain about trespassers. “The media are entering on private properties all along the area,” said Sgt. Peter Dunn of the Village of Rhinebeck Police Department. “Some of the residents have had multiple reporters on their property on more than one occasion. We advise residents to ask them to leave, and everyone so far has left when they’re asked.”\n\nThe Rhinebeck Area Chamber of Commerce, in the meantime, has been flooded with calls from people looking for places to stay. “There are people who are genuinely happy that Chelsea’s getting married and that she found somebody, and they want to be part of that in some way,” said Nancy O. Amy, the chamber’s executive director. “There are curiosity seekers. There are people who want to be part of history.”\n\nBut most hotel rooms were snapped up months ago. On a single day in the spring, someone took all 31 rooms at the neo-Classical Belvedere Mansion in nearby Staatsburg. The Beekman Arms, the largest hotel in the village, is fully booked.\n\nCari Meltzer, the owner of Looking Glass Bed & Breakfast, which has only four rooms, said she was contacted by someone before Easter who asked for several rooms but declined to give the names of the guests. “She said, ‘We’ll call two or three days before and give you the names,’ ” Mrs. Meltzer said. “It’s very mysterious.”\n\nBut all the media attention on local purveyors is just reminding some of them that they have not made the cut. Although it has been widely reported that the restaurant Terrapin will be catering some wedding events, its publicist, Paul Shiavo, denied that. “We are not involved in any way, shape or form with regard to this wedding,” he said. “It was rumor and hearsay, and that’s the most I can say about that.”\n\nAnd, clearly, Mr. Shiavo was disappointed. The Clintons, he said, should have reached out to more local vendors.\n\n“If there’s a wedding of this magnitude there, it’s going to be a pain,” he said. “We would have hoped that if there was a wedding there that they would have used a few more of our local businesses for some of their needs.”\n\nStill, shopkeepers hope the influx of 400 guests and countless journalists from around the world will leave a lasting impact on the town’s economy, which has had its fits and starts through the recession.\n\n“The wedding has put the word ‘Rhinebeck’ into people’s minds,” said Suzanna Hermans, a co-owner of Oblong Books, who drove to work Friday while hearing the flutter of helicopters she said she believed were associated with the wedding. “Money is still tight around here,” she said. “One week to the next is completely different. We’re hoping in the long run this will bring people to Rhinebeck.”\n\nCelebrities including Bette Midler, Liam Neeson and Annie Leibovitz have weekend houses in the area, which is filled with horse farms and wineries. “It’s very laid back, but it’s a civilized laid back,” said Gail Saucier, a real estate agent and former bond trader who moved here from Manhattan a few years after 9/11. “I always joke that I’ll stay here until there is a Tiffany on Main Street. Then it will be time to go.” She and her fellow agents at Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty ordered up a cream-and-teal banner with the message “Congrats Chelsea and Marc” for their storefront on East Market Street. “Let’s welcome them to town,” she said, “and hopefully we’ll get some sales.”\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/nyregion/26rhinebeck.html?src=mv\n\nGetting into the spirit: Local businesses have started to erect\n\ncongratulations messages ahead of the big day\n\nChampagne toast: Shop windows bear notes wishing the happy couple well\n\non their wedding day\n\nLaurie Bathrick and Gary Kiernan, who live in Rhinebeck, N.Y., wore Clinton masks while walking\n\nin the town.
