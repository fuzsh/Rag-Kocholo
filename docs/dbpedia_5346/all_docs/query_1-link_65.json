        "text": "While Chelsea Clinton typically remains low-profile, her Saturday nupitals will be quite the opposite.\n\nChildren of presidents are as close to royalty as we get in the United States and for an estimated $3 million, Chelsea will get quite the fairy tale wedding.\n\nAlthough the Clintons aren't confirming anything officially, the secret-wedding details are no longer so secret. It's become widely known that the former first daughter will marry Marc Mezvinsky on Saturday in Rhinebeck, NY.\n\nThe town of 3,000 along the Hudson River seems quite excited for the weddingâ€”many local businesses are sporting signs of congratulations in their storefront windows.\n\nThe reported wedding location is fit for a princess. Astor Courts is the palatial, 100+ year-old mansion originally built for John Jacob Astor IV and modeled after the Palace of Versailles. The 13,000 square feet building should certainly accomodate the expected 400-500 guests. (According to Hillary Clinton, every one of them is acquainted directly with Chelsea or Marc.)\n\nPresident Obama revealed Thursday on \"The View\" that he was not invited.\n\nSo how exactly does a wedding cost $3 million? Experts are speculating about some the expenses. Here's the consensus:\n\nWedding Dress: $20,000\n\nThat's the going rate for a custom-made Vera Wang wedding gown. (Chelsea was spotted leaving the designer's showroom earlier this week.)\n\nWedding Cake: $12,000-$20,000\n\nPossibly prepared by Sylvia Weinstock and sure to be intricately detailed.\n\nFlowers: $250,000\n\nRumored to be Casablana lilies and orchids. (By comparison, Donald Trump spent $500,000 on flowers when he wed Melania.)\n\nCatering and Beverages: $780,000\n\nMultiple vendors have reportedly been hired to properly feed the guests.\n\nTents: $600,000\n\nThe white tents have been seen from aerial footage of Astor Courts (flyovers will soon be halted; details below.)\n\nPortable toilets: $15,000-$20,000\n\nFor this price, you can expect air conditioned, high-end bathroom facilities complete with bathroom attendants and flowers.\n\nEntertainment: $40,000\n\nNo word yet on the band, although TMZ.com claims it has obtained the playlist of songs.\n\nSecurity: $250,000\n\nSome of the cost of security is expected to be paid for by the Clintons, though the government will foot the bill for the Secret Service agents covering the former president and his wife, the Secretary of State. Additionally, the town of Rhinebeck is shelling out $2,500 for extra police.\n\nThe FAA has confirmed that the airspace over Astor Courts and along the banks of the Hudson River has been deemed a \"No Fly Zone\" from 3pm on Saturday to 3:30am Sunday for a \"VIP Movement\".\n\nI think it's safe to say everyone knows who this unnamed VIP is: Chelsea's gettin' hitched!\n\nSlideshow: Richest Members of Congress\n\nLarry Kudlow's 'Money and Politics' Blog\n\nWedding Gift Anxiety: What Everyone Should Know"
