        "text": "It was high society inside and high security outside as Chelsea Clinton wed her longtime boyfriend at an elegant estate in a Hudson River village.\n\nDespite the veil of secrecy, several details about the lavish ceremony, which was located at a riverside estate in Rhinebeck, New York, began to leak by Monday morning.\n\nDuring the reception, Bill Clinton toasted his son-in-law, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, joking that he was \"looking forward to having some company because I'm outnumbered,\" Women's Wear Daily.\n\nThe former president then turned to a more serious tone about raising Chelsea with Hillary Rodham Clinton. \"Despite the fact that we have had interesting careers, we still consider the most important job we ever had to being the parents of Chelsea.\"\n\nHe made it through the toast without shedding a tear, but choked up while dancing to Frank Sinatra with Chelesa, multiple sources reported.\n\nThe reception included a menu of farm-fresh salad, risotto, beef short ribs and grilled fish, multiple sources reported.\n\nAfter dinner, it seems the Clinton's threw quite the party. The gluten-free cake — which was made by La Tulipe Bakery in New York City — wasn't cut until after midnight and the reception lasted until 3 a.m., People magazine said.\n\nAs reported earlier, Chelsea Clinton, wearing a Vera Wang strapless white gown with a full skirt and silver beading around the waist and carrying a bouquet of white flowers, was escorted down the aisle by her father. The former president and the groom wore dark suits, while the mother of the bride wore a fuchsia dress by Oscar de la Renta.\n\nIt is estimated that hundreds of guests gathered at the historic estate near the end of a near-perfect summer day of warm temperatures, blue skies and cottony clouds. The ceremony was conducted by a rabbi and a reverend as Chelsea Clinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewish, and included a poem by Leo Marks titled, \"The Life That I Have,\" according to the family.\n\nThere's been no word yet on where the newly married couple plans to honeymoon.\n\nConsistent with Chelsea Clinton's desire for privacy, the family had released no details of the wedding beyond the date before the ceremony. They issued only a short statement announcing that their daughter exchanged vows, and a few photographs were later released to media outlets.\n\n\"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends,\" the Clintons said. \"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day.\"\n\nDespite the privacy, the scope of the event became apparent when more than a half-dozen busloads of wedding guests — men in black tie, women in dresses — were transported from a hotel in the village to the riverside ceremony as gawkers looked on.\n\nThe road to Astor Courts was blocked off Saturday — neighbors received bottles of wine for their troubles — and the sky above was declared a no-fly zone by federal aviation officials. Police and security guards fanned out around this usually sleepy town.\n\nSpectators spot celebritiesCelebrities spotted in Rhinebeck for the event included actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen; fashion designer Vera Wang; Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state during Bill Clinton's second term as president; and Terry McAuliffe, former Democratic National Committee chairman. The former president's half brother, Roger Clinton, was spotted early Saturday afternoon with his son Tyler, picking up food at a restaurant.\n\nReporters, who had been searching for celebrities in vain for most of the day, quickly zeroed in on Danson and Steenburgen, prompting Danson to ask, \"Are we the only celebrities in town?\n\nCelebrity seekers jockeyed with reporters for sidewalk space over most of the day too. Donna Vena drove 50 miles to Rhinebeck from her home of Mount Kisco, N.Y., in the hopes of spotting a celebrity.\n\n\"Why not?\" she asked Saturday morning, a camera slung over her shoulder. \"Big story. Maybe see Oprah.\" Nearby, two young women passed out slices of pizza with \"I do\" written in pepperoni.\n\nMeanwhile, a longtime Clinton family friend denied that the wedding would cost more than $1 million. The friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with the family's desire for privacy, said the cost will not exceed six figures. Wedding experts said on TODAY that the wedding could cost $2 million to $5 million.\n\n'We love it here'On Friday, there were sightings of Bill Clinton and his wife, a former U.S. senator from New York and current secretary of state.\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the hotel where many of the guests stayed were rewarded Friday night when the pair exited a van arm-in-arm outside the Beekman Arms Hotel.\n\nShortly before 11 p.m., the former first lady, wearing a long green dress, waved to the cheering crowd waiting behind metal barricades and quickly went into the hotel. She left with the former president about a half-hour later.\n\nEarlier Friday, Bill Clinton made an appearance around lunchtime, popping out of a car and walking a few blocks, greeting people on his way to a restaurant. Looking fit and relaxed in blue jeans and a black knit shirt, he gave easy answers to questions shouted by well-wishers and reporters.\n\n\"We're all fine. We love it here,\" he said, when asked how he was. \"Chelsea loves the area as well.\"\n\nAnd what do you think of Mr. Mezvinsky, Mr. President, someone asked.\n\n\"I like him very much,\" Clinton said. \"I really do. I admire him. Hillary feels the same way.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton and Mezvinsky were friends as teenagers in Washington, and both attended Stanford University. They now live in New York, where Mezvinsky works at G3 Capital, a Manhattan hedge fund. Mezvinsky worked previously at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker.\n\nClinton completed her master's degree in public health earlier this year at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nMezvinsky is a son of former U.S. Reps. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania and Ed Mezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons. His parents are divorced."
