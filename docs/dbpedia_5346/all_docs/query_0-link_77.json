        "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton are grandparents. The couple’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, has given birth to her first child, a daughter named Charlotte.\n\nChelsea Clinton announced the baby’s birth on Twitter early Saturday, saying she and husband Marc Mezvinsky are “full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.”\n\nClinton spokesman Kamyl Bazbaz said the child was born on Friday but did not immediately provide additional details. The couple live in New York City.\n\nThe baby arrives as Hillary Clinton deliberates on whether to run for president in 2016, a decision that could put her on a path to become the nation’s first female president. Clinton is the leading Democratic contender to succeed President Barack Obama, her 2008 campaign rival, and has said she expects to make a decision around the beginning of next year.\n\nSee more Team Hillary Clinton: Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen and Her 2016 Supporters\n\nThe baby has been eagerly anticipated as Hillary Clinton considers her political future — she has called the prospect of becoming a grandmother her “most exciting title yet.” She has even picked out the first book she intends to read to her granddaughter, the classic Goodnight Moon.\n\nThe former secretary of state has said she didn’t want to make any decisions about another campaign until the baby arrived, pointing to her interest in enjoying becoming a grandmother for the first time. If Clinton does decide to run for president, her campaign would coincide with the baby’s first two years.\n\nThe former president has made it clear that he is eager to become a grandfather. During an event with former president George W. Bush in September, Clinton’s cellphone rang when he was onstage and he joked that only two people had the number “and they are related to me,” musing that he hoped he wasn’t becoming “a premature grandfather.”\n\n“Every day I get up and I say, ‘You have to remember whose child this is. Do not interfere. Be there when you are welcome. Be loving but not judgmental,” Clinton said to laughs in an interview with CNN at his annual Clinton Global Initiative, only days before the baby’s arrival.\n\nSee more Hollywood’s 100 Favorite Films\n\nEven Obama got into the act. Addressing the annual Clinton confab, Obama quipped that if Chelsea Clinton went into labor during his speech, “she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic.”\n\nThe 34-year-old Chelsea Clinton said in an interview with Glamour magazine last year that she and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, had hoped to make 2014 “the year of the baby.” She announced her pregnancy in April at the end of a forum in New York on female empowerment.\n\nChelsea Clinton grew up in the public eye as a teenager in the White House, later graduating from Stanford and Columbia universities. She worked in finance in New York and in public health, earning a doctorate from Oxford University while taking on a prominent role as vice chair of her family’s foundation. She recently departed NBC News, where she served as a special correspondent.\n\nThe new parents, who married in 2010, were friends as teenagers in Washington and both attended Stanford. Mezvinsky is a hedge fund manager and the son of former Rep. Marjorie Margolies of Pennsylvania and Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons."
