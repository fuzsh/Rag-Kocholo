        "text": "I accidentally became an expert on Presidential progeny and their nuptials in 2007. I happened to have a picture of Jenna Bush's boyfriend on my Bush Twins page along with a fleeting mention of his name (a Karl Rove aide named Henry Hager.) When the news broke, mine was one of the highest ranking pages on Google when surfers searched on his name, and I got about 18 months's worth of hits in one day. The reason I had a Bush Twins page in the first place was originally as a war protest.\n\nJenna Bush got married in May 2008, apparently happily. And now another Presidential child, Chelsea Clinton is getting married.\n\nI am not going to pompously bloviate about how I am not interested in the upcoming Clinton-Mezvinsky wedding, although I do have more pressing concerns to worry about. I certainly wish the young couple well.\n\nI would like to make a small complaint. Not about the price. The cost of the wedding has been variously estimated at $2 million, $3 million and even $5 million. Whatever the cost, the usually sensible and unselfassuming bride is uncharacteristically going on an orgy of conspicuous consumption, featuring three caterers, multiple $15,000 portapotties and much much more. Maybe I should say \"conspicuously inconspicuous consumption\" since the ceremony will be strictly private, and limited to 400 or 500 of the ex-President and current Secretary of State's closest family friends. The rest of us will only see a few selected photos, but we will be encouraged to imagine the rest of the event.\n\nLike I said, I am not complaining about the price. Bill Clinton makes about $15 million a year from his speaking and consulting fees. Hillary and Chelsea make good money themselves, even they are both on salary. This family, even though it comes from humble roots, can afford to blow $2 million or more on a party. I can think of better ways to spend a few million, but I can also think of worse ways. If nothing else, a wedding party is a highly labor intensive project, so this will provide an economic stimulus.\n\nI am complaining about the venue. The Clintons are renting some other family's ancestral manor house for the weekend: Astor Courts, one of the estates of the 19th century robber baron family by that name (Astor, I mean, rather than Court.) The setting is often described as Gatsby-esque, which signifies glamor--- even though Gatsby was a sad man who died an early and tragic death.\n\nIronically, the setting was chosen in part for its natural beauty: the estate sits on a hillside overlooking the Hudson River... but the guests will not be able to fully enjoy the setting. The wedding will take place under tents and there will be helicopters overhead as part of the heavy security.\n\nI am not complaining about the venue because it's Astor Courts. I am sure it is a perfectly lovely place. I am complaining because it is in New York State. New York is one of the states which has not embraced marriage equality. Its state Senate rejected marriage equality last year after some very ugly political wrangling. If Chelsea had wanted to marry Marcia instead of Marc, she would not be able to do so in New York State. (Ditto if Marc wanted to marry Sheldon instead of Chelsea.)\n\nI think Chelsea and March should officially say their vows and sign their marriage contract in some other state. They can still have the party as scheduled in Columbia County, New York, but the actual marriage should be contracted elsewhere. I recommend my home state of New Hampshire. I have several friends who are justices of the peace who would be delighted to be Chelsea and Marc's officiant. It is not too late for the happy couple to do the right thing."
