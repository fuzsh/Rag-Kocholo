        "text": "Multiple media outlets have reported that the Clinton Foundation paid for Chelsea Clinton’s lavish $3 million wedding.\n\nThe facts: Doug Band, formerly a top aide to President Bill Clinton, complained to John Podesta, another former top aide to the president and recent director of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, about the former first daughter’s spending in a Jan. 4, 2012, email leaked by WikiLeaks.\n\nThe email references Chelsea Clinton using foundation money to pay for her 2010 wedding to Jewish investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, as well as living expenses and taxes on cash she took from her parents, the media reports said.\n\nBut no more information about the accusations has come to light. No one in the Clinton family has commented. We couldn’t find any follow-up to the story.\n\nThe story went viral days before the 2016 presidential election when Fox News published a story on Nov. 6 under the headline, “Clinton Aide Says Foundation Paid for Chelsea’s Wedding, WikiLeaks Emails Show.”\n\nBand wrote in 2012 that he had received a call from a close friend that Chelsea, identified in the emails as “cvc,” told “one of the bush 43 kids” that she is “conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation.”\n\nIn a second email, Band wrote, “The investigation into [Chelsea] getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents … I hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road …”\n\nThe email also stated that a top foundation donor was responsible for “killing” unfavorable media coverage — all as an internal foundation audit uncovered numerous conflicts of interest and “quid pro quo benefits.”\n\nBut TruthOrFiction.com points out that it’s not clear exactly what “investigation” Band was referring to, or what, if anything, it concluded about foundation “resources” supporting Chelsea’s wedding.\n\nThe allegations are unproven, but we will do an update column when more is revealed."
