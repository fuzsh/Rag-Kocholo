        "text": "The pair reportedly first met at a Renaissance Weekend in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in 1993. They both attended Stanford University as undergraduates (Marc graduated a year ahead of Chelsea) and both did graduate work at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe wedding was at Astor Courts, an estate overlooking the Hudson River in Rhinebeck, New York. Secretary of State Madeline Albright and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe were in attendance, and Vera Wang designed Chelsea Clinton's dress. According to estimates, the event cost between $2 and $5 million, including $750,000 for catering, $500,000 for flowers, and $15,000 for toilets.\n\nTheir daughter Charlotte was born in 2014 and their son Aidan came two years later, in June 2016.\n\nMezvinsky was born in 1977 to Conservative Jewish parents Edward Mezvinsky and Marjorie Margolies. (UnlikeIvanka Trump, Chelsea has not converted to Judaism, she has attended Yom Kippur services with him.)\n\nMezvinsky worked at Goldman Sachs and 3G Capital before launching the hedge fund Eaglevale Partners in 2011 with with two former colleagues from Goldman Sachs. According to the New York Times, Eaglevale closed its Greece focused Hellenic Opportunity fund in May after losing nearly 90 percent of its value over two years.\n\nBut that's according to celebritynetworth.com, so take it for what you will.\n\n\"He is great,\" the former president said of his son-in-law. \"He is a great human being.\" A source told People that Mezvinsky is \"the son he didn't have\" and that their connection is \"the relationship Bill didn't have with his father.\"\n\nBoth his parents were Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Here a young Mezvinsky is with his mother, Marjorie Margolies.\n\nWhile Clinton was impeached, Mezvinsky's father actually went to prison. Edward Mezvinsky pleaded guilty to 31 counts of bank fraud, involving almost $10 million, in 2001. He was released from federal prison in 2008. According to Politico, records show that he asked Bill Clinton for a presidential pardon. The pardon was never granted and it is not clear where Clinton himself ever saw his now in-law's request, Politico reported."
