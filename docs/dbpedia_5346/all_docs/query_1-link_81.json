        "text": "Fifteen years after her father left the White House, Chelsea Clinton will take the stage tonight to make the case for her mother being elected president of the United States.\n\nChelsea Clinton, 36, will introduce her mother tonight at the Democratic National Convention as Hillary Clinton makes a speech accepting her party's presidential nomination. The Clintons are expected to take the stage around 10 p.m. EST (9 p.m. CST).\n\nThe evening's theme is \"Stronger Together.\"\n\nChelsea Victoria Clinton\n\nChelsea Clinton is the only daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her parents famously taking her name from the 1969 song \"Chelsea Morning.\" She was born in Arkansas during Bill Clinton's first term as governor and joined her parents in Washington D.C. in 1993 when her father became president.\n\nIn Washington, she attended the Sidwell Friends School, a private school later attended by President Barack Obama's daughters. A national merit semi-finalist, she went on to Stanford University where she majored in history, graduating in 2001. Clinton received a master's degree and later a doctoral degree from Oxford.\n\nAfter completing her education, Clinton went to work for a New York consulting firm and then at NBC as a special correspondent. She left NBC at the start of her mother's 2008 presidential campaign, joining her mother on the campaign trail and then introducing her at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nSince 2011, Clinton has taken on a lead role in the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, where she is a board member.\n\nIn 2010, Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky. The couple lives in New York and has two children: Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, born in September 2014, a son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, born in June 2016."
