        "text": "RHINEBECK, N.Y. — Imagine spending $250,000 on flowers. Or $20,000 on a gluten-free cake. Wedding experts say that when Chelsea Clinton, 30, who earned a master’s in public health in January, marries investment banker Marc Mezvinsky at a private New York estate Saturday, the tab could hit $3 million or more — a canape or two above the average $24,000 most American newlyweds shell out.\n\nThen there’s the air-space closure from 3 p.m. Saturday to 3:30 a.m. Sunday — a status granted only to the highest of government officials, which would include Clinton’s parents, Secretary of State Hillary and former President Bill. The Associated Press\n\nOriginally Published: July 29, 2010 at 3:36 p.m."
