Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.\"\n\n\"And I certainly feel all the better, whether it’s a girl or a boy, that she or he will grow up in a world with so many strong, young female leaders,\" she said.\n\nThe daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton also took to Twitter to spread the news.\n\nAnd the grandfather-to-be also tweeted his congratulations.\n\nChelsea Clinton wed husband Marc Mezvinsky, a hedge fund trader, in 2010.\n\nProbable 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made no secret of hoping to become a grandmother soon.\n\nIn an interview last year with Glamour magazine, the younger Clinton said she hoped to make 2014 “the Year of the Baby.”\n\n“And please,\" she added, \"call my mother and tell her that. She asks us about it every single day.\"\n\nAfter daughter Chelsea revealed the news Thursday, Hillary Clinton said she is \"really excited\" about Chelsea's pregnancy."
