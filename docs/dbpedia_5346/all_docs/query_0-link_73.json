        "text": "While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton might be at each other's necks amidst the political drama during the 2016 Presidential Election, let's take a trip down memory lane and remember their prominent daughters, Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton, who were the center of attention as they stole all eyes at their fabulous weddings.\n\nIvanka married financier Jared Kushner in 2009. Chelsea married her husband, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, in summer 2010. The women, who were previously friends before the election, both had stunning weddings and their nuptials remain some of the most prominent events in many social circles.\n\nNaturally since there's a showdown on the political front, we had to take this opportunity to compare the future first daughters' (again in Chelsea's case) A-list nuptials to decide who was the ultimate bride.\n\nThe Dress\n\nIvanka: The bride dazzled in a detailed A-line Vera Wang gown, overlaid with three different shades of floral ivory lace. The dress had sheer lace sleeves to the elbow, and a moderate train.\n\nChelsea: She opted for not one, but two Vera Wang creations and went with a strapless, silk, organza gown with a glittering beaded waistline belt, and pleated tulle across the bodice for her ceremony. Her second was Grecian-inspired frock with a black ribbon belt and criss-cross strap detailing across the back for the reception.\n\nWinner: Ivanka stole the show with her immaculate detailing. Her conservative, yet stunning gown is the clear winner here, not to mention her beautiful diamond-studded jewelry completed the look.\n\n10 Perfect Hairstyles for Summer Weddings\n\nHair and Makeup\n\nIvanka: She maintained a minimalist look. She wore her hair down in soft, polished waves and continued her classic look throughout her makeup. She did a nude lip, light blush, a slight smokey eye and full gorgeous lashes.\n\nChelsea: Hersleek up-do highlighted her distinct facial structure, but she really brought the drama in the makeup department. She kept her base makeup toned down, then added the oomph with rosy pink lips with some extra shine, a bold eyeshadow and a set of serious lashes.\n\nWinner: Ivanka's subtle yet sultry style lured us in, and did just the trick to keep all eyes on her on her big day.\n\n16 Prettiest Dresses from Bridal Fashion Week\n\nVenue/Location\n\nIvanka: The entire wedding took place at the luxurious Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The traditional Jewish ceremony was held outdoors under a chuppah filled with an array of flowers, while the reception was moved to a larger, even more elegant area on the property.\n\nChelsea: The bride spared no expense at the breathtaking Astor Courts Estate in Rhinebeck, New York. Guests were provided wristbands and transportation to the luxurious wedding, which was held outside. Chelsea walked down a white runner aisle and recited her vows under a flower-covered chuppah.\n\nWinner: Both ladies opted for an all-in-one location, but Chelsea's pick had the whole town in a glossy-eyed frenzy. She definitely wins this one!\n\nFlowers/Decor:\n\nIvanka: The bride used a white and gold theme throughout her lavish decorations with accents of crystal and a variety of gorgeous flowers including roses, hydrangeas, and a 13-layer cake bedecked with an array of flowers on top.\n\nChelsea: Details of Chelsea's nuptials were kept under wraps, but a few aspects were accounted for including plenty of roses and hydrangeas of purple, blue, and pink hues, and a 9-tiered white cake with silver accents and edible white sugar flowers.\n\nWinner: Ivanka takes the cake here with the perfect blend of opulence and extravagance that wasn't too over the top.\n\nCelebrity Attendance:\n\nIvanka: Ivanka's day was star-studded with Barbara Walters, Regis Philbin, Natalie Portman, and Russell Crowe, as well as several high profile politicians and New York power players, in attendance.\n\nChelsea: The dance floor was packed with many high profile attendees ranging from actor Ted Danson to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\n\nWinner: Ivanka is the clear winner here as she really invited dozens of stars and influential guests. The guest list was anything but ordinary.\n\nOverall Winner :Ivanka somehow amazed us all with a classy and absolutely stellar wedding that still remained somewhat down to earth. Both ladies definitely impressed, but Ivanka with her soft colors, gorgeous venue, and amazing guests, scored the win for the best wedding. Everything screamed lavish, yet sophisticated. It was definitely one for the books!\n\nBy: Bryanna Wallace\n\nMore From AOL:\n\nNewly engaged Pippa Middleton can't stop smiling as she jogs through London\n\nPippa Middleton's fiance James Matthews spotted running ... with the royal dog?\n\nKate Hudson and Goldie Hawn's tributes to Garry Marshall will bring you to tears"
