        "text": "It's a good day for the Clinton family! And no, for once it isn't political news. Chelsea Clinton gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Saturday, her second child with husband Marc Mezvinsky. Momma announced the birth of Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky on Twitter Saturday.\n\nTwice-over grandparents Hillary and Bill Clinton issued a statement celebrating Charlotte's little brother, also noting that both mother and son are doing well after the birth. It seems that the whole family is there to join the growing Clinton Mezvinsky family:\n\nWe are overjoyed to be grandparents again with the arrival of our grandson, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, born on Saturday, June 18, 2016.\n\nWe are all over the moon as Chelsea and Marc welcome Charlotte’s little brother to the world and grateful for our many blessings. Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together.\n\nI'm sure this has been a welcome break from the campaign trail for Clinton, who has been, you know, furiously campaigning for president of the United States, particularly now that she is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Of all of the \"where were you when I was born?\" stories, I think little Aidan will have one of the best from his Grandma Clinton.\n\nAidan is the second grandchild born to a presidential candidate on the campaign trail this election season. In March, Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka gave birth to her third child, Theo. Like Chelsea, Ivanka's pregnant belly was on prominent display on the campaign trail until right up before she gave birth.\n\nThis could be the first presidential election in which the two candidates have had new grandchildren while on the campaign trail, at least in recent history. At the very least, if Clinton becomes president, her grandchildren will be the first to say that both of their grandparents have been president of the United States.\n\nNo doubt that Clinton will dote on little Aidan as much as she does with nearly 2-year-old Charlotte. During public speeches, Clinton often mentions her first grandchild, saying, \"FaceTime was invented for grandparents.\"\n\nIt's only a matter of time before people start to talk about Clinton's ability to balance her campaign duties with her role as a grandmother. Even before she had announced her campaign for president, when Chelsea was pregnant with Charlotte, there was talk about whether being a grandmother would prevent her from running for president. Obviously it hasn't, and I'm sure that Clinton can be both a great grandmother and Democratic nominee."
