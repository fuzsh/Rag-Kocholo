Her second child, son Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born in June 2016.\n\nChelsea Clinton married Mezvinsky, the son of two former members of Congress, in 2010. The family lives in Manhattan.\n\nAfter their daughter's wedding, Bill and Hillary Clinton applied good-natured public pressure on her to start a family.\n\nShe has regularly said her parents were \"unapologetic\" in their pleas for grandchildren. \"(They) are not shy about saying that in public and private,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in 2013.\n\nHillary Clinton has often mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, at political events."
