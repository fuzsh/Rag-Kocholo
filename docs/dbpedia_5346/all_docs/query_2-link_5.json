        "text": "Chelsea Clinton outshone her parents last night as she wed her long-term boyfriend, Marc Mezvinsky, in Rhinebeck, New York state.\n\nSome of the wraps finally came off the high-security event as the family released photographs of the ceremony. The bride wore traditional white, a strapless gown designed by family friend and wedding guest Vera Wang.\n\nChelsea, carrying a bouquet of white flowers, was escorted down the aisle by her father. The groom and the former president wore dark suits, and the bride's mother wore a fuchsia dress.\n\nA statement from Bill and Hillary Clinton said: \"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends.\n\n\"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day.\"\n\nThe ceremony was conducted by a rabbi and a minister, as Chelsea Clinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewish. It included a poem by Leo Marks titled The Life That I Have.\n\nA no-fly zone was imposed over the event and the road to the exclusive estate was blocked off. Neighbours received bottles of wine for their troubles.\n\nThe busloads of wedding guests included the acting couple Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen; Madeleine Albright, secretary of state during Bill Clinton's second term as president; and Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic national committee chairman.\n\nThe happy couple were friends as teenagers in Washington and studied at Stanford University. They live in New York, where Mezvinsky works for a hedge fund, G3 Capital. He is the son of the former Democrat politicians Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Ed Mezvinsky, a long-term friend of the Clintons.\n\nChelsea Clinton recently completed her master's degree in public health at Columbia University."
