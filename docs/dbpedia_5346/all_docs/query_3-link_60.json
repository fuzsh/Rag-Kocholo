        "text": "A few of the Trump kids may have their eye on Chelsea Clinton’s old room in the White House. In the event they don’t get there (which is looking more like a chance than a given, at this point), they luckily still have an opportunity to move into the former First Daughter’s former digs.\n\nThe 10th-floor, three-bedroom, 1,922-square-foot condo on Fifth Avenue where Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, lived is back on the market. The couple, who are expecting their second child, bought the sprawling space for $4 million in 2008, according to the New York Post. As their family started to expand and Clinton started raking in more money from speaking engagements, they sold their starter home for $4.75 million in 2013 and upgraded to a 5,000-square-foot, $10.5 million apartment in the building where Jennifer Lopez also reportedly owns.\n\nThat they left for greener pastures in the same neighborhood doesn’t mean their onetime home leaves anything to be desired. The condo, on the market for just about $6 million, opens to 10-foot ceilings and overlooks Madison Square Park. The only heir to the Clinton throne cooked in its open kitchen, slid across its rich hardwoods, and unwound in the marble-lined master bath filled with a steam shower, double sinks, and a soaking tub."
