        "text": "REMEMBER THE old Joni Mitchell song, \"Chelsea Morning\"?\n\nIn the Clinton/Mezvinsky household, it may be changed to \"Chelsea Morning Sickness.\"\n\nFormer first daughter Chelsea Clinton announced yesterday that she is pregnant with the first grandchild of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year,\" said Chelsea, referring to her investment banker husband, Marc Mezvinsky, the son of former area congresswoman Marjorie Margolies.\n\nTalk about great photo ops for Hillary on the campaign trail. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz better buy a cute puppy.\n\nSitting with her mother in side-by-side armchairs on a stage at an NYC event on empowering women, \"Girls: A No Ceilings Conversation,\" organized by the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, Chelsea delivered the news with a broad smile. The audience broke into applause and cheers.\n\nNo shoes were thrown. Not even bronzed baby ones.\n\n\"I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in a world full of so many strong young female leaders,\" said Chelsea, who works for the family foundation and is a correspondent for NBC News, the official news home of former first daughters (Jenna Bush works there, too).\n\n\"Thank you for inspiring me and thank you for inspiring future generations, including the one that we'll be lucky enough to welcome into our family later this year,\" she told the audience.\n\nBill Clinton tweeted: \"Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio . . . grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!\"\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton tweeted: \"My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child.\"\n\nDirector abuse?\n\n\"X-Men\" franchise director Bryan Singer was sued in a federal court in Hawaii Wednesday by Michael Egan III, with Egan claiming he was sexually abused by the director in the late 1990s when he was 17 years old.\n\nEgan, a former child model and aspiring actor, says he reported the molestation to L.A. police and the FBI but nothing was done about it.\n\nLos Angeles Police Commander Andrew Smith said the department is looking into whether a report was made. A phone message left for an FBI spokeswoman was not immediately returned.\n\nSinger's attorney, Marty Singer (no relation), said that Egan's claims are absurd and defamatory.\n\n\"It is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity at the time when Bryan's new [\"X-Men\"] movie is about to open in a few weeks,\" Singer the lawyer said.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Egan was lured into a sex ring with promises of auditions for acting, modeling and commercial jobs. He was paid as an actor for a digital entertainment company, but forced to have sex with adult men at parties notorious within Hollywood, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit says that Bryan Singer attended several of the parties and forced Egan into sex, giving him drugs and threatening Egan when he resisted advances. It does not accuse the director of luring Egan into the ring.\n\n\"Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children,\" Egan's lawyer Jeff Herman said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit does not specify a total dollar amount, but says Egan is seeking more than $75,000 on each of four accusations: intentional infliction of emotional distress, battery, assault and invasion of privacy.\n\nAlthough it does not typically name victims of sex abuse, the Associated Press named Egan because his suit was filed civilly, his lawyer identified him and Egan plans to speak publicly.\n\nThe suit is possible in Hawaii because of a state law that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations in sex abuse cases.\n\nHerman has made a career of representing victims of sex abuse, filing suits against the Roman Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. In 2011, he won a $100 million verdict against a priest who was accused of molesting dozens of boys.\n\n* TheWrap.com reports that a scene promoting 20th Century Fox's \"X-Men: Days of Future Past,\" directed by Bryan Singer, will appear during the end credits of Sony's \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\"\n\nTATTBITS\n\n* America may not be popular all over the world, but Captain America is.\n\n\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" has topped $500 million in global box office (more than $335 million of that coming from overseas).\n\nAccording to TheWrap.com, the movie has taken in more than $80 million from China alone.\n\n* The Hollywood sequel train is leaving the station again and this time on board is: \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\"\n\nRobin Williams will again star and Chris Columbus will again direct.\n\nNo plot details were given, but it doesn't take a genius to guess the story.\n\n* As a follow-up to yesterday's lead item, TMZ.com reports that doctors at L.A.'s Cedars Sinai Hospital were unable to reattach rapper Andre Johnson's penis after he cut it off before a botched suicide leap from a second floor balcony.\n\nAndre, however, is miraculously in stable condition.\n\nBut dang if the nurse isn't having a tough time with the catheter.\n\nOther rappers present when Andre cut and jumped stated that there were no drugs on the scene at the time (although he's sure going to need drugs now). The rappers blamed a possible mental issue.\n\nGee, ya think?\n\n- Daily News wire services\n\ncontributed to this report\n\nPhone: 215-854-5678"
