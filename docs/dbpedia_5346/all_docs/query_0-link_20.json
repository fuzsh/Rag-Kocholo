        "text": "Appearance: The Democratic Nuptial Convention.\n\nMeaning? Chelsea Clinton's getting hitched.\n\nTo whom? Marc Mezvinsky.\n\nOh, Marc Mezvinsky! He's a great guy. Is he now? And what does he do for a living?\n\nHe's a . . . tree surgeon? Close. He's a banker. Now please stop pretending you've heard of people.\n\nFine. So who's this Chelsea Clinton? She's Bill and Hillary's daughter, of course. You remember them, the ultimate power couple? They were nearly the first couple in history to both become first lady of the US. Chelsea herself, on the other hand, is media-shy, reserved and frankly a bit dull.\n\nAnd this Marc Mezvinsky guy? Is he a good match? They certainly have some things in common. Just like Chelsea, Marc grew up in the shadow of political parents, although in his case mum and dad were merely Congress members. Their fathers even have matching political scandals: Marc's dad Ed was jailed in 2001 after pleading guilty to 31 different counts of fraud. Prosecutors in the case called him a one-man crime wave.\n\nDoesn't that bother people? Not really. It's only fraud. It's not like he punched someone. Commentators seem far more incensed about the fact that Mezvinsky is Jewish. The big question is whether or not she's going to convert.\n\nPlus of course he'll want to smash a bottle over her head. That's christening a boat. Jewish weddings is stamping on a glass.\n\nOh. So who's going to this wedding? There are rumours the 400-strong guest-list includes Oprah Winfrey, Barbra Streisand and John Major. Given that Chelsea has insisted she must know every guest personally, these are almost definitely false.\n\nWhat do we know about it? It's scheduled for 31 July and, while the location's officially a secret even from the guests, the smart money is on a private estate in the small town of Rhinebeck, to the north of New York.\n\nI'll book my ticket now. Go for it. Although obviously you're not invited.\n\nDo say: \"I do.\""
