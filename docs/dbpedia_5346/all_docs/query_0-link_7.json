        "text": "In the end, Oprah Winfrey was a no‑show. In fact, the occasion was notable for its relatively modest sprinkling of celebrities, in tune with the family event that the woman at its centre had wanted it to be.\n\nNot that the wedding of Chelsea Clinton on Saturday was low-key. Beaming in a veiled Vera Wang dress on a gorgeous day in upstate New York, she was led down the aisle by her father Bill, the former president, who kept his promise not to cry and certainly looked as though he had also lost his pledged 15lbs judging from the set of photographs given out by the family.\n\nHillary Clinton wore a dress by Oscar de la Renta.\n\nThe groom, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, who was a childhood friend of Chelsea's and who shared some of the peculiarities of her upbringing by being the son of Democratic politicians, wore a yarmulke and a tallit prayer shawl.\n\n\"Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends,\" the Clintons said in a statement. \"We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family.\"\n\nThe celebration went off amid tight security, with a no-fly zone over the Astor Courts estate on the banks of the Hudson river – which was patrolled by police boats to foil any paparazzi hoping for waterside shots. The little town of Rhinebeck nearby, where most of the guests stayed, was overrun by Clinton tourists hoping for a sight of the famous family and any celebrity guests, though they were largely disappointed.\n\nClinton's half-brother, Roger, was in town, as was his former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Terry McAuliffe, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The Obamas had not been invited.\n\nActor Ted Danson was one of the few stars to be spotted. \"Am I the only celebrity in town?\" he said."
