        "text": "“At the eleventh hour Maxwell’s lawyer informed plaintiff’s counsel that Maxwell’s mother was very ill and that consequently Maxwell was leaving the country with no plans to return,” the filing states. “Maxwell was photographed at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York, confirming the suspicion that she was indeed still in the country and willing to say anything to avoid her deposition.”\n\nAs Chelsea emerges into the public eye after photos of Maxwell at her wedding have surfaced across the internet, we take a look at what she’s been up to lately.\n\nChelsea Clinton has been investing in healthcare\n\nWhile she’s been relatively off the radar, Clinton, 43, has reportedly been investing in healthcare. Per an article published late last year by Fortune, Clinton has put money into Summer Health, a start-up paediatric telehealth platform, and the company’s new model, Everyday Care. “There are so many challenges facing kids and carers and families in our country,” she told the publication.\n\nShe’s been a busy parent\n\nThe former first daughter has been a busy parent of three. According to Hello!, she shares daughter Charlotte, and sons Aidan and Jasper, with her husband Marc Mezvinsky. Last year, she was photographed with a walking boot in New York City, after she “broke her toe in a race to bath time with kids”, her rep told People.\n\nReliving her Saturday Night Live portrayal\n\nIn August last year, former SNL cast member Julia Sweeney shared on the Fly on the Wall podcast that Hillary wasn’t happy about the show’s portrayal of her daughter, Chelsea. Sweeney, who played a teenage version of Chelsea in the 1993 episode, said Chelsea’s mother personally “wrote a letter” to the showrunner at the time.\n\n“People were saying how unattractively I was playing Chelsea, and all I did was not wear make-up and put braces on,” Sweeney said. “If you say that, you’re saying I’m unattractive!”\n\nShe added, “I understood what Hillary was saying, especially now that I’m a parent. It’s like, yeah f*** off. I mean, don’t play kids. That was wrong. She was right, that was wrong.”\n\nWho is Chelsea Clinton’s husband?\n\nAccording to Town & Country, Chelsea met her husband Marc Mezvinsky in South Carolina in 1993. The same source reports that they began dating around 2005, and got married in 2010. He reportedly worked at Goldman Sachs and 3G Capital before starting the hedge fund Eaglevale Partners in 2011.\n\nHowever, like Chelsea’s parents, his own family has been embroiled in controversy in the past. Per Town & Country, when Bill was impeached, Mezvinsky’s father went to prison after pleading guilty to 31 counts of bank fraud. The same report states that the scandal involved at least US$10 million in 2001. Per Politico, Mezvinsky’s father asked Bill for a presidential pardon, though it’s unclear whether this went through.\n\nWhat’s Chelsea Clinton’s relationship like with Ivanka Trump?\n\nBut in a 2022 interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, it was clear things have since soured, with Chelsea stating that Ivanka had “[gone] to the dark side”. When asked if the Clinton women would be reading Ivanka’s husband Jared Kushner’s memoir, Hillary replied, “We missed that,” with Chelsea adding, “And we’ll keep missing it.”"
