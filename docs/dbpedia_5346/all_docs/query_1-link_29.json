        "text": "Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, is the banker son of two ex-Congress members.\n\nBy JOSEFIN DOLSTEN/JTA\n\nChelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky are expecting their third child. Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, made the announcement Tuesday on Twitter. “Marc and I have loved watching Charlotte be such a wonderful big sister and we’re excited to watch Aidan become a big brother!” she wrote. “We cannot wait to meet our newest addition later this summer.” Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, is the banker son of two ex-Congress members. Clinton serves as the vice chairwoman of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Clinton and Mezvinsky were married in late July 2010 under a traditional huppah, or Jewish wedding canopy, and recited the traditional sheva brachot, or seven wedding blessings. A rabbi and a Methodist minister officiated at the wedding. The couple signed a ketubah, or Jewish marriage contract."
