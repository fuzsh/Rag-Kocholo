        "text": "While some voters may view Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as dishonest, her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, says there's no one she trusts more.\n\n\"With my husband, there's no one I trust more than my mom,\" Clinton said Friday during an appearance on The View. \"If, God forbid, anything were to happen to Marc [Mezvinsky] and me, my mother would take care of my children. There's no greater vote of trust and faith and love than that. So as a daughter, it doesn't make sense to me\" that polls show some voters find Hillary Clinton untrustworthy.\n\nThe former first daughter made similar comments about her mother in a rare interview with the press on Thursday, saying, \"I don't trust anyone more than my mom.\"\n\n\"If anything were to happen to me, my mother would take care of my children,\" the 36-year-old said, according to CNN. \"I couldn't imagine a better sign of faith or trust than that.\"\n\nClinton, who married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010, has two children â€“ Charlotte and Aidan.\n\nThe couple met when they were children in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. They began dating in 2005 and confirmed their engagement to PEOPLE in 2009 after they sent a mass email to their loved ones.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hillary and Chelsea Clinton's Lucky Charms"
