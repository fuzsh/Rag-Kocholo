        "text": "Her entire life, the world has known her as former President Clinton’s daughter, but on July 31, 2010, it was Chelsea Clinton’s time to shine. Planned by Boston-based event planner Bryan Rafanelli, Chelsea tied the knot with Marc Mezvinsky in an interfaith ceremony at the Astor Courts estate in Rhinebeck, NY. Though many speculated the event would be littered with high profile guests like President Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg, the couple kept their nearly 500 person guest list to close friends and family. Known to be daddy’s little girl, Chelsea was certainly all grown up as she walked down the aisle in a strapless Vera Wang dress. The reception consisted of a first dance choreographed by Dancing with the Stars’ Maksim Chmerkovskiy, an $11,000, 500-lb. guten-free wedding cake decorated with almost 1,000 sugar flowers, and ended with a nightclub tent.\n\nTIP 1: A TOUCH OF UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE\n\nWant to turn up the heat on a simple wedding dress? Try a wedding belt. Chelsea requested a crystal belt be added to her gown, but today brides are selecting belts not only sparkle, but also for a pop of color. This Fuschia and Hot Pink Wedding Sash/Belt made by 5eizen is available on Estsy.com for $140.00 and is an easy way to add a bit of spice to a gown.\n\nTIP 2: SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE?\n\nChelsea and Mark tangoed through Etta James’ “At Last”, but you can choose whatever song or dance style you like! Dance lessons are very popular these days, as countless couples look to plan a special number to kick off their reception. Many note the lessons are a fun way to spend intimate time with their partner and release a bit of stress as they plan their big day. Here a couple dances in the Madera Ballroom at our Villa location.\n\nTIP 3: ANIMATED AFTER-PARTIES\n\nWho wants to end a fun night? Chelsea kept her party going until 4 a.m. after she moved her guests to a nightclub tent at the strike of 12. Here the guests were able to party into the wee hours of the morning, dancing up a storm and snacking on sliders and tacos. To make your after party a reality, you don’t have to go over budget. A DJ and simple candy buffet, like the one we created below, will keep your guests lively for hours."
