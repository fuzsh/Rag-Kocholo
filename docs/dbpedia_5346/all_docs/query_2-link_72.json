How does $15,000 to $20,000 for toilets sound?\n\nSounds like the first Wedding of the Century.\n\nWedding industry experts say that when Chelsea Clinton gets married Saturday at a private estate in upstate New York, the tab could hit $2 million, $3 million or more  a canape or two above the average $24,000 that most American newlyweds will shell out this year.\n\nMost weddings host about 150 guests; the Clinton-Mezvinsky nuptials are expected to have 400 to 500.\n\nDetails have been notoriously scarce, but Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides, said industry insiders have gathered enough intelligence to sketch out roughly what sort of shindig the daughter of President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will put on when she marries her longtime boyfriend, investment banker Marc Mevinsky.\n\nSome estimates put the cost at close to $5 million, but Kilbridge said Chelsea Clinton won't let it get too extreme.\n\nI'm going to say 2 to 3 million,\" Kilbridge said. \"Just because I don't know if they will go that over the top when it comes to every little item of the wedding, and possibly because it's not really Chelsea Clinton's style.\"\n\nKilbridge estimated costs for some of the higher-profile items:\n\n Gown by Vera Wang, whose New York store Chelsea was photographed visiting: $20,000  not off the rack, obviously.\n\n Cake, possibly by Sylvia Weinstock: $20,000. Expect intricate, fabulous designs.\n\nFlowers: $250,000. \"It's going to be glamorous with a capital G,\" she said. (And this isn't even that much, she said: Donald Trump laid out $500,000 for flowers when he married Melania.)\n\nCatering: $750,000. Add another $30,000 for beverages.\n\n Tents: $600,000. These, she joked, guarantee it will not rain.\n\n Portable toilets: $15,000-$20,000. These will not be construction-site facilities. Think air conditioning, attendants, flowers.\n\nEntertainment: $40,000.\n\n\"It's obviously a large wedding,\" said Darcy Miller, editorial director of Martha Stewart Weddings. \"But knowing what we do about Chelsea, she seems to be understated, someone who has tried to stay out of the crowds, someone who has tried to have her own life.\"\n\nMiller also brought up the logistics and realities to confront.\n\nA $3M Clinton wedding?
